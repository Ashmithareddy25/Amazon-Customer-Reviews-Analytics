0201626632|5.0|This is a succinct, pleasurable read that will help academics in the sciences pick an advisor, choose a research project, give excellent presentations, land a post-doc position, decide whether to go into industry or academia, and eventually get tenure.  Wow! <BR>Feibelman packs a career's-worth of tips and tactics in his slim volume and makes it entertaining at the same time.<br />Feibelman's suggestion that all research should tell a compelling story.  This is advice that any academic -- even those in the humanities and social sciences - would be wise to follow.<br />I am a professional counselor and coach to academics and this is the first book I advise for grad students and junior faculty in the hard sciences -- especially those who work in labs.<BR>My professor husband is a microbiologist and epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina, and after reading the first section of the first chapter of this book, I ran to my husband and insisted that he buy a copy for every student who comes near his lab.<br />My one complaint (and it is significant) is that Feiblelman is sexist.  He presents 6 vignettes in the beginning of his book about career mistakes made by academics.  Five of the stories are about men who make tactical career errors.  One story is about a woman -- her mistakes are personal, psychological difficulties -- she tries too hard to please her father and ends up becoming a workaholic who doesn't have time to bear children.<BR>Men are allocated work difficulties while the sole woman's problems are emotional in nature.  I find this to be an inexcusible example of stereotyping from an otherwise saavy and helpful sage. Shame on you, Feibelman.

B00005ATQM|5.0|My first DVD-Audio disk! The only thing I can say is - terrific! DVD-Audio is the future, or atleast it would be if it were more widely available. The audio on this CD is of great quality, with deep rich bass and very clear treble. The DVD plays in my regular DVD-Video player for those of you who don't have a dedicated DVD-Audio player.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|The bros. obviously spent too much focus on fx and not enough on script.  Caye needs to watch a real movie and see what a wonderful balanced combination of fx AND script can do.  Being in the buxiness I can say that a lot of reviewers here are correct in their thinking.  <br />The restarting of the heart did not need to be there nor did the overly graphic content of the dance and sex scene.  All of those could have been done more tastefully.  The plot was quite thin.  I would have given this a lower rating but for the fact that I really enjoyed the scene where Smith decided he needed more copies.  The presence of Smith greatly added to the movie and I can hardly wait to see more of him.  Yes.... I hope the next movie has more script to go with the FX.  Then... and only then will it truly be a good movie.  A movie is nothing without a good script.

0385504209|1.0|I keep telling people: it's a work of fiction. Gladly, the author never claims to be anything else but fiction. He confuses a lot of historical elements and passes them for facts by using the lecture style of the character. For example, all he says about the Gospels is completely inaccurate: he gives the impression that the 4 Gospels known to all and all others were written at the same time and then the &quot;church&quot; selectively chose the four. History doesn't agree. We have no proof. He even claims that Jesus wrote &quot;Q.&quot; This document, &quot;Q&quot; is hypothetical (it's mostly a scholarly construct). As for the &quot;Da Vinci&quot; stuff, I am not learned enough to respond. For crying out loud: let's keep in mind that IT IS ONLY FICTION, poorly written, but still fiction.
B00008X5J3|5.0|This is a fantastic musical. From the beautifully designed sets, to the period costumes, to the show-stopping song and dance numbers, it will simply razzle-dazzle the viewer. The director  and his singing and dancing troupe of stars simply pull out all the stops in this brilliantly executed musical.<br />The film, which provides a cynical and satirical look at fame and fortune, centers in nineteen twenties Chicago around two murderesses, Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger). Velma, who together with her sister, was a dance hall success, killed her husband and her sister when she caught them together en flagrante delicto. True to the maxim, however, that the show must go on, she goes on stage immediately after dispatching the two lovers, where she is promptly arrested.<br />Roxie Hart, an admirer of Velma Kelly, is married to Amos Hart (John C. Reilly), a good-hearted, regular Joe, but she longs for tabloid fame and fortune. She begins to have an affair with a man who  promises that he could get her a stage gig only to find that he lied just to get her in bed. So, she ends up killing him. Her long suffering husband stands by his little woman as she is trundled off to jail to await trial. There, she meets her idol, Velma Kelly, who finds her hero-worship annoying.<br />In the jail, Matron \\"Mama\\" Morton (Queen Latifah) reigns supreme over the inmates, accepting bribes for favors. Velma Kelly, represented by star defense attorney Billy Flynn (Richard Gere),  is in tabloid heaven. Roxie Hart, longing to be in tabloid heaven as well, gets her husband to retain Billy Flynn on her behalf. Before she knows it, she, too, is in tabloid heaven, playing the media like a violin.<br /> The legal profession also gets a cynical slap in the guise of the slimy, fast talking Billy Flynn, who looks for the best selling point rather than for the truth. He understands the thirst of the media for the perfect sound-bite and he gives it to them. Guilty or not guilty, it doesn't matter.  What matters to him, as a hired mouthpiece, is the media mileage he can get for his client, as well as for himself. To that end, he is the ventriloquist, and his client is no more than his dummy.<br />The razzle-dazzle musical numbers move the story along. Catherine Zeta-Jones is terrific, looking impossibly beautiful and showing off her musical theatre background to great advantage with \\"All That Jazz\\" and \\"Cell Block Tango\\". Queen Latifah is outstanding as the sly and voracious Mama Morton, who goes whichever way the wind is blowing. She also has a show-stopping musical number, \\"When You're Good To Mama\\" that is simply memorable. Renee Zellweger, though not a professional singer or dancer, shows that she can sing and dance with the best of them.<br />The men also shine in this musical. John C. Reilly, as Roxie's long-suffering husband, also has a terrific number, \\"Mister Cellophane\\", that is truly heart rending and poignant, as well as metaphoric. Richard Gere gamely rises to the occasion in his first musical, making the slick Billy Flynn character an integral part of the film with his \\"Razzle Dazzle\\" number and his tap dancing.<br />I love this top notch, clever film, finding it hugely entertaining. It deserves every one of its six Academy Awards, including that for \\"Best Picture\\". Director Rob Marshall deserves kudos for this brilliantly directed, seamlessly edited, musical masterpiece. While it is a fairly faithful screen adaptation of Bob Fosse's Broadway musical, it has Rob Marshall's contemporary imprimatur on it. It is a film of which he can be justly proud.

B0000C23DO|4.0|I have been a Deadhead for around 25 years. Any respectable Deadhead knows that you don't buy a Dead \\"best of\\", yet in this case I did. I own a nearly complete Dead collection. I am only missing \\"best ofs\\" & a couple of titles I just didn't care for. I have complete \\"Dicks Picks\\", \\"Vault collections\\" Hours of boot legs...why would I want this? I ignored it when it was first released and then realized that it contained exactly what I play when I am trying to turn \\"newbies\\" on to the band. Granted they are not the superior live versions, but the studio versions (which must be respected because they serve as the Skelton for the live body of work...OK, you can groan now). Anyway, I have found through the years that people not familiar with the band seem more accepting of the studio work when they are 1st adjusting to the Dead sound.<br />The collection itself draws largely from \\"American Beauty\\" (5 songs)which is the Studio Dead at it's acoustic best. Add \\"Eyes Of the world\\", \\"Fire on the Mountain\\" \\"Sugar Mag\\", \\"Franklins Tower\\" and \\"the Music Never Stopped\\" and you can't go wrong. Yes, there are numerous songs that could have been put on this, but this serves as a sample from which to grow from. As w/ any Rhino release, the sound and package are exquisite. If you like what you hear here then it's time for you to start exploring the many live releases.
B00005JKZV|1.0|Oh boy. I was looking forward to seeing this movie since I read the trilogy (it was my favorite of the three books), and was so let down by Peter Jackson's imitation of what this movie should have been. He focused too much on the battle of Helm's deep, and there were PLENTY of scenes that simply never happened in the book that they just crammed into this movie. Now I know that this makes me sound like a nerd- &quot;stuff that was never in the movie,&quot; but it's true- the stuff that Peter Jackson stuffed into this movie not only didn't flow with the context of the movie, but contradicted the entire thing. Frodo NEVER went to Gondor in the Two Towers. They totally left out the part where he and Sam go to Shelob's lair, and, oh man I can't even go on. I urge anybody with a brain to keep this poor interpretation of the Two Towers in Amazon's warehouse.

B0000025C0|5.0|I have to agree with some of the reviewers here.  This IS Boston's best album, imo, and has always been extremely underrated.  Yes, I own all 6 of their albums, and I love them all for what they are worth, but this one is worth its weight in gold.  <br />From 'Don't Look Back' to 'Don't Be Afraid', every song on this release is excellently done.  I find it ironic that Tom Scholz has been quoted as saying that this is the least favorite of all his releases, but he was also quoted as saying that his favorite Boston song is on this album:  'The Journey'.  <br />This album might as well be called 'Boston II', for several reasons.  All of the music carries the same spirit as the first album, and with good cause.  This was the last album in which the original members played (Delp, Scholz, Sheehan, Gordreau and Hashib), and it was the last album in which Scholz used the old Marshall/tube amps and power soak technology.  <br />5 out of 5 stars.  I recommend this album as required listening for any Boston fan.  If you can get it on vinyl, the older, rawer sound or the original release before Scholz remastered it for CD is even better.  I have this album on both formats.

0783225849|5.0|First let's get a common misconception out of the way; \\"Psycho\\" is no more a horror film than \\"Jaws\\" is. It's a suspense/thriller film with two horrorfying moments. Yes, the use of black and white photography, Bernard Herrmann's brilliant score and Hitch's imaginative camera angles do echo what we've come to expect from horror films. That's because the genre had borrowed from Hitchcock and made it their own. Hitch's suspensful style had been stolen so-to-speak by others and he was stealing it back and upping the ante. It's lessened the impact of Hitch's film in many respects but such is the fate of great films that influence a generation.<br /><br />OK, now that I've gotten that out of the way--how's this look? Brilliant. \\"Psycho\\" appears in its first aspect ratio when it was shown in 1960--widescreen. Yes, it has been presented in full screen before but it was shot that way with the intention of matting the film for theatrical widescreen later. Detail is sharp and the film retains it's \\"look\\"--Universal hasn't over processed this to try and make it look like a modern film.<br /><br />Special features include ALL of the special features from the previous DVD edition. We also get a new digital 5.1 mix for the film. It sounds nice. I personally prefer the original mono soundtrack but that's me.<br /><br />Is this essential? Yup. A brilliant suspense thriller that uses the shocks of the horror genre to further allow Hitchcock to investigate his themes of guilt, isolation and the traps that we often find ourselves falling into.<br /><br />I suppose the difference between a horror film and a suspense film is best described as follows; someone jumps out of the shadows and yells \\"boo!\\". We, the audience, weren't aware that they were in the shadows at all. Seeing the twisted wreckage and gore. Suspense, on the other hand, is walking into an eerie room knowing that someone is watching you but not able to confirm it. It's that sense of being uncomfortable. We the audience know that someone is there and can actually SEE them. Our fear for the character and what will happen generates the suspense. One lasts but a moment but the other (suspense) has a much larger pay off. Sure, there's moments of horror in \\"Psycho\\" but two moments don't make a horror film.<br /><br />It's everything that surrounds those two scenes that make it a suspense film. Why is that important? Because everyone is judging the film (and some find it wanting) as a horror film. As a horror film (slasher films are much more closely related to John Carpenter's terrific Halloween than \\"Psycho\\"). As a horror film, it's ultimately a failure but, well, that's because we're judging the film on an inaccurate reputation.<br /><br />Hitch's film deals with many of his personal themes--guilt, murder and the psychology of the human mind. Hitch had first ventured into this area in the 40's. This film, along with \\"Frenzy', is his most penetrating into that latter theme.<br /><br />The plot is well summurized and anyone that doesn't know it has probably been hiding under a rock for the last, well 50 years. I'm not going to discuss the plot. Analysis? Robin Wood does the ultimate analysis of this film. In many respects Psycho features ultimate con job; the audience is lured into thinking that the film is about one thing and then, suddenly, Hitch switches gears. He had tried a similar experiment (unsuccessfully but brilliantly) with Stage Fright and had it down by the time he and Ernest Lehman dreamed up North by Northwest.<br /><br />Fans will want to pick this up and those of you who haven't seen it (is there anyone?)need to give Hitch's film a chance.

B00006V9A0|4.0|Nirvana is simply the greatest band of all time.  This greatest hits compilation doesn't even begin to do them justice.  Missing were the tracks &quot;Love Buzz&quot;, &quot;School&quot;, &quot;Blew&quot;, &quot;Polly&quot; &quot;Serve the Servants&quot;, and &quot;On a Plain.&quot;  &quot;Love Buzz&quot; was the first released on the Love Buzz EP, and was their first official single.  It deserves to be on the Greatest hits.  Kurt Cobain has never written a bad song, and he has been a musical inspiration to all rock bands since the release of Nevermind.  In Utero is also an inspired record.  I recomend that you get the other Nirvana cd's as well.  Kurt never wrote a bad song, and he would likely be angered that so many people call themselves Nirvana fans when they own only this cd.  The Greatest Hits could've and should've been better, by better I mean that they should've included some other tracks as well.  It's too bad that the final record from the greatest band of all time is a disapointment.
B00009RDG9|4.0|i like the movie.<br />now for my speech:<br />i don't eat meat and i don't even kill bugs. i try to live my life as much as possible without killing other things that are doing no harm to me. as the powerful animals we are on earth, we should be the first to not kill others even though evolution made us that way. what i mean is, although in nature it is survival of the fittest, since we don't have to kill to survive anymore, we should rise above our primal instincts and be kind to animals. THAT IS A TRUE MODERN MAN.<br />i have no problem with a lion hunting a giraffe in africa. it's doing what it has to do to survive. it probably doesn't have the capacity to feel bad for other animals--but we DO.<br />i don't care what the bible says, everything on earth is NOT HERE FOR US. religion is crap.<br />don't hunt.

B0000942HV|4.0|I had lost my original copy of TB, so when I saw this, I figured, &quot;Why not?&quot; I was not disappointed. I popped it in the CD player and it immediately made me smile, because it wasn't a &quot;remake,&quot; &quot;remix,&quot; or &quot;rehash.&quot; It was like hearing the original the way I wished I could have heard it, in full audio glory. The most significant difference, which I don't mind because it also makes me smile, is the use of John Cleese to narrate the &quot;roll call&quot; section... sweet! :o) All of the quirky guitar, bass, and synth sounds you remember are here... you just hear *more* of them. The original was sonically groundbreaking in its time... but thank God for modern recording technology! Nicely done, Mike!
B000005IRG|5.0|With this album Tom Verlaine and co. not only created a benchmark in late 70's rock history,but they were also the first band to hint at the New Wave mowement to come by adding to their compositions an extra touch of colour absent from their peers work.Highlights are evidently frequent in this recording,though 10 minute long track Marquee Moon is the first to grab attention one cannot overlook the sheer perfection of Elevation,the playful mood of Prove It or the gut wrenching emotions that ooze from Torn Curtain(which is definitely in my top 10 songs ever).You can't possibly regret having bought this album.
B00005J4HH|5.0|Simply fabulous. Very &quot;real&quot; music, unlike anything you will hear on the radio. It's very original and the variety ranges from one end to the other. The last track is a perfect album end. NO complaints, whatsoever. I don't believe I've heard the bonus tracks, but I could be wrong. I'm sure they're just as fabulous as all the others.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I stumbled across some of the songs from this album the Internet back in 2000 and was blown away.  I immediately zipped to Iron Maiden's website for details as they had kind of dropped from my radar when Bruce Dickinson left the band.  Much to my surprise he was back as was Adrian Smith and they still had Janick Gers.  I then immediately ran out and purchased the CD and it hasn't seen the CD jewel case since.  The band and arrangements are tighter than ever.  The complexity of the music is amazing yet not over the top which could be considered one of the greatest achievements of this album.  Bruce Dickinson's voice is better than ever shows more range and polish without losing that trademark edge.  Blood Brothers, Ghost of the Navigator, Nomad and The Thin Line Between Love and Hate are 4 of my favorites, but there isn't a stinker in the bunch.  The more I listen the more depth I find.   From the brilliant drum work in Nomad to the beautiful counterpoint bass parts in Blood Brothers all I can say is that it's all good.  The bottom line here is that no band other than Iron Maiden has the talent, chemistry and the sense of self to even attempt much less pull off something this groundbreaking.  If you liked Somewhere in Time, 7th Son of a 7th Son, No Prayer for the Dying and Fear of the Dark then you'll LOVE Brave New World.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This album simply defies the laws of music.  Hybrid Theory proved to be an incredible debut album, and somehow, Linkin Park has followed it with an album of even more incredible sound.  Meteora bears a resemblance to Hybrid Theory in some of the song structure, but when you break down the album song by song, you can see why Meteora is vastly superior to its predecessor.<br />1.  Foreward:  This track is merely a 13 second intro, but the beat blends perfectly into the second track.<BR>2.  Don't Stay:  9/10 alone; 10/10 with Forward intro.  This song proves to have some similarities with One Step Closer, but the song is refined to an extraordinary amount.  The layers of multiple sound make this song one of the best on the CD.<BR>3.  Somewhere I Belong:  10/10.  The first single, Somewhere I Belong, is a standout on the album.  It contains much more melody and lyrical poetry than any of the songs on Hybrid Theory except for In the End (That song is God).  Somewhere I Belong is a clear sign of LP's foreward progression.<BR>4.  Lying From You:  10/10.  This song is a perfect blend of the three elements that make up LP:  Rock, Hip-Hop, and Electronica.  The song has an electronic bounce with a hip-hop beat, and Brad chimes in typically incredible guitar riffs.  Amazing!<BR>5.  Hit the Floor:  7/10.  Not a bad song, but the sound seems relatively underdeveloped compared to the first three.  Reguardless, it is not nearly bad enough to hinder the album.<BR>6:  Easier to Run:  8/10.  Another standout track, Easier to Run, is very melodic and harmonious.  It is fitted with somewhat of a dark feeling that makes the entire song unique.<BR>7:  Faint:  10/10.  Anoth single, Faint, is arguably the best song on the album.  The pace is fast, the rap is swift, and the chorus is elevating.  This song is essentially a perfect alternative rock song.<BR>8:  Figure .09:  8/10.  This track is quite good, but, like Hit the Floor, this song seems somewhat underdeveloped.  It still sounds good, but it can't compete with some of the other songs on the album.<BR>9:  Breaking the Habit:  10/10.  Any and all knowledge of Linkin Park's initial sound should be thrown out the window before listening to this incredible song.  It simply blows listeners away with its excellent lyrics and profound melody.  This song is perhaps the most intriguing song on Meteora.<BR>10:  From the Inside:  7/10.  My least favorite song, From the Inside, just lacks melody to me.  It may possess good lyrics, but other parts just don't flow properly.<BR>11:  Nobody's Listening:  10/10.  This song is pretty sweet.  It uses a flute for the base sound, and Mike's signature rap just carries this song.  Chester's addition in the chorus doesn't hurt either.<BR>12:  Session:  9/10.  An incredible instrumental, Session, may not be as good as Cure for the Itch, but it has a certain dark atmosphere to it that makes it very listenable and almost danceable.<BR>13:  Numb:  10/10.  I don't see how anyone could dislike this song.  It has such intricate melody and great vocals.  This is great song to use for the conclusion.<br />All in all, this is a must for all:  LP fans, modern rock lovers, and music lovers.  This album runs at a tight 36:41, but you will listen to this album dozens of times.  I sure have.  Besides, it's quality, not quantity.  This album is a perfect 36:41, and the songs flow smoothly from one track to another.  Purchase of this CD is not just recommended, it is demanded!
B0000AXE8I|3.0|If I were to review The Matrix Reloaded based purely on its action, this would be an easy **** 1/2. But there's a story here, tons of filler in-between the martial arts battles and car chases, and rather than pushing forward the momentum, it actually drags the film down. Hard to believe a plot about the surviving human race duking it out with their A.I. \\"masters\\" could turn out so boring, but there you go.<br />When we last left off, Neo (Keanu Reeves) had proven himself to be The One destined to free the human race from the Matrix, an artificial intelligence that has most of the population unknowingly trapped in a dream world. Those who escaped the fantasy settled to a city called Zion, where they're in preparation for a war against the invading machines.<br />Neo still has his doubts over his purpose, but none are shared by his lover and companion, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), nor Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), the man who discovered him. But Neo, curious to discover what further action he should take, heads into the virtual world to search for the Oracle, who tells him to search for the Keymaker. Meanwhile, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), formerly one of the Matrix's prime enforcers, has become a rogue program, slowly taking over the system with an interesting reproducing technique.<br />For me, the original The Matrix hasn't held up so well over the years. I still argue that movie failed to achieve its potential, given such a rich and fascinating premise (which wasn't fulfilled here, either)(this series exists for the action, through and through), and its action sequences were somewhat overrated, similar styles having been accomplished (albeit with less slick and polish) from earlier Hong Kong pictures. That, and Dark City (a movie which The Matrix borrowed from) beat it to the punch with the concept of memory manipulation.<br />But the movie succeeded enough to at least make me look forward to the prospect of a sequel and that's where Reloaded comes in. And unfortunately, as fun as the plot may sound, too much of it is shaky and pretentious. That philosophy would be presented as a major theme is not unexpected, but for it to come across as so dull and uninteresting makes its inclusion heavy-handed. The scene where Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity debate with the Merovingian drags for far too long. Unless these characters have something truly interesting or vital to say, they should shut up and get moving (in case these people forgot, there is a countdown to the possible destruction of the only remaining human city).<br />Too much of this series is easy to rag on. In the virtual world, the Zion humans easily bring attention to themselves with their tight, dark attire and sunglasses. The Matrix is capable of manipulating the virtual environment (like blocking the exits in a building with brick walls, which is what happened in the original), but rarely does so even when its use would prove helpful in defeating Neo (and such further obstacles would have made the action even more fun).<br />But complain as I might, the action saves Reloaded and makes this otherwise strictly mediocre film worth watching. The most popular setpiece appears to be the highway chase, a fourteen-minute long spectacle that, for the most part, lives up to its reputation. It's not the best chase ever (Terminator 3 boasted an even more frenetic and exciting setpiece and Raiders of the Lost Ark still has the most rousing on-screen chase), but it is one hell of a thrill ride. Coupled with the preceding martial arts battle set in the castle, the non-stop fun lasts about twenty minutes. Not since Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom has a movie delivered non-stop creative and thrilling action for such a long period of time (but Temple actually did it twice, in the beginning and end). <br />Best of all is Neo's battle with the Agent Smiths, who quickly grow in numbers and have our superhero surrounded from all sides and angles. The sequence is a total blast and one of the more entertaining fight scenes I've seen all year.  All of Reloaded's action put together adds to about thirty or so minutes, not even a fourth of its running time, but the quality of it is enough for me to recommend the film, even if most of the rest of it is a bit of a bore.
B000092ZYX|1.0|Nothing catchy, nothing interesting, nothing remotely redeeming about this.  Like the title of the CD implies...Radiohead robs you of your time and money.<br />Just because it's Radiohead, doesn't mean it's any good.  Bland background muzak is cutting edge compared to this album.  A poor and pretentious excuse for an album at that.
B000002U8G|5.0|Okay .Wish you were here is over rated, and so is dark side of the moon. The general public needs to discover this album. Its the most diverse work that Floyd ever put out. The whole cd is almost worth buying just because of the magnificent tripped out &quot;echoes. Each song differs from each other like a punk differs from puff daddy. BUY IT NOW!!! go.
B000002N3J|5.0|Most people remember Madonna for her great dance tracks. However, this album shows her softer side, compiling most of her ballads on one disc. The album begins with a new track, a remake of Marvin Gaye's &quot;I Want You&quot;. Very nice and different from Madonna's other work. We then get gorgeous hit ballads, including &quot;I'll Remember&quot; and the timeless smash, &quot;Take A Bow&quot;.Then comes the beautiful new (at the time)hit &quot;You'll See&quot;.<BR>After this we are treated with &quot;Crazy For You&quot; and &quot;This Used To Be My Playground&quot;. They are followed by the haunting &quot;Live to Tell&quot; and the &quot;remix&quot; of &quot;Love Don't Live Here Anymore&quot;.  The album bogs down a bit with &quot;Something To Remember&quot;, &quot;Forbidden Love&quot;, and the new &quot;One More Chance&quot;.  All are listenable but oddly sequenced.  The album renews with the nice &quot;Rain&quot; and the sad &quot;Oh Father&quot;. It closes with an orchestral version of &quot;I Want You&quot;.<BR>Overall, the songs on here are first-rate ballads. This album proves why Madonna has such mass appeal. This album is a nice companion for &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; and &quot;GHV2&quot;. Buy it today!
B000099T2L|5.0|This cd is so cool i like all the songs more i like the song Daddy and Crazy in love, naughty girl, and baby boy and the others too.It is so beautiful this CD.
0451169514|5.0|I adored this book from cover to cover. The complex psychological satire that surrounded the power of confrontation and united individuality against cowardice and society. A beautifully sculpted story that follows a group of children in Derry, Maine. Each an outcast in his (or her) own right, they come together against what could be described as simply, Evil Personnified. This evil, takes the shape of Pennywise the clown, which reflcts the inner-personal-fear of each person. He targets children in particular as their fears tend to be less complex... vampires, corpses etc. The tale revolves around the loveable and 'real' characters, and follows their battle with the creature both as children, and as adults. I did find that 'Michaels' sections were often dreary and windingly long, but I was always glad when I stuck with it, as the final lines would really sock a punch. Also, the final pages maybe left a little bit to be desired... but the reader was given the artistic lisence to paint in (to a degree) what they wanted. Besides, the journey itself was really what the book was all about (and an amazing journey at that), not so much the conculsion.<br />A gripping tale, which reflects upon fear, innocence, love and friendship, and deals with the very real power of confrontation. A magical read that had me spellbound. I highly recommend it to everyone. You'll get as much out of it as you put in!!!<br />Enjoy! :)
0385302320|5.0|First of all, this 3rd book in the Outlander series introduces Major Lord John Grey who is the main character in Diana Gabaldon's new trilogy.<br />I am not a &quot;romance&quot; reader but am completely hooked on this series.  The Outlander Series was recommended to me 10 years ago and when I read the discription of the story, I thought, &quot;noooo, not for me&quot;.  Then it was recommended by another person who just raved about the book.  So I picked up a copy of Outlander almost a month ago, then Dragonfly in Amber, now Voyager and haven't put the series down.  I absolutely loved reading the historical detail, the growth of respect and love between Claire and Jamie, and the fascinating characters introduced in each book in the series.  Who couldn't fall in love with Jamie afterall?<br />It is seldom when an author can make me unconsiously smile and then a few pages later tear.  I liked this book more than I did Dragonfly because the intimatcy between Claire and Jamie was left more to the imagination of the reader.  This made the story flow more smoothly in my opinion.  In addition, this book answered a number of questions left from Dragonfly.<br />This is more than a story of Claire returning to Jamie.  It explains what happened to the clansmen during and following the Battle at Culloden.  In addition, we find out what happened to Claire and Jamie during the twenty year separation.  I felt sad to think that Jamie had not survived after Claire stepped through the stones, even though I knew better because he appears in the next book.  Now that's good writing!<br />There is only one issue, just how many more whippings, stabbings, hits over the head, rapes, and shootings is Jamie going to be able to take?
B00000DHR0|5.0|From traditional songs to new, like &quot;Don't Save it All for Christmas Day&quot; which was co-written by Celine, this is a diverse selection of Christmas music that will appeal to those who appreciate Celine's talent and the many colorations of her agile voice.<br />Starting with my favorite Christmas song, &quot;O Holy Night&quot;, which is here given a lovely rendition, my other top choices would be:<br />Track # 3, &quot;Blue Christmas&quot;, with a superb jazzy interpretation, Celine using her smooth, smoky voice, and Diana Krall adding a lot with her piano magic. I would love to hear Celine record an entire album in this quiet style; though it does not have the powerful top notes many expect from her, it is the &quot;Celine voice&quot; I enjoy the most.<br />Track # 6, the &quot;Ave Maria&quot; by Charles Gounod (adapted from a prelude by J.S. Bach), is heavenly. Exquisitely gentle and tender, this familiar and beautiful melody is always a pleasure to listen to, and is sung in English and Latin.<br /># 9, &quot;The Prayer&quot;, by Carol Bayer Sager and David Foster has meaningful and moving lyrics, and makes an ideal duet for Andrea Bocelli and Celine, and the pianissimo ending is perfection.<br /> # 13, the John Lennon/Yoko Ono &quot;Happy Xmas (War is Over)&quot; is poignant and marvelous, and the final track, sung by the Dion family, is a joyous Brahms waltz, &quot;Les Cloches du Hameau&quot;.<br />Though everyone will have tracks they will like more than others, the overall production and musicianship is top-notch, making this a very satisfying CD, and one I do not mind hearing any time of the year. The enclosed booklet has most of the lyrics, extensive recording info (many different arrangers and musicians are involved in this CD), the sound excellent, and total time is 68'28.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This album, whereas may be more mellow throughout overall than most of Maynard's past works, sometimes it's ok to do a laid back more calm album.  However if you slam a little &quot;pet&quot; or &quot;the outsider&quot; you will understand that APC has lost non of it's edge.  This album is a great buy for any music lover, no one can deny Maynard's voice, Howerdel's innovative guitar and now with james iha and jeordie white joining the ranks APC is moving up on the chart of great bands. . . If you are looking for a slam metal edge this may not be the APC album for you, but if you like real deep meaningful lyrics, and great general flow buy this one!
B000099T2L|1.0|I used to think Beyonce was a classy woman when she did that cd with Destiny's Child called The Writing's On The Wall. Now i think she went and slutted up her appearance as much as possible to sell cds. The photo of her on her solo cd looks like the coverbox of a porno movie. I don't think any of the hits off her new cd are remarkable at all. If the songs Crazy In Love and Baby Boy are supposedly the best songs on the cd then that's not saying much. Once again we have another example of an artist who used to be good as part of a group who went solo and came up with a big disappointment.  Skip this one.
0694013889|5.0|This book is adorable.  Yes, it uses words like \\"wee wee,\\" but you can simply substitute \\"your\\" words for those.  And, honestly, at 2 or 3 how sophisticated do you expect your child to discuss her bodily functions?  I think it's sweet, the illustration is wonderful.  My daughter loves it.  It explains body parts in a simple & suitable way.  All in all, a very loving, cute, & charming book.
B000084T18|1.0|I'm so sick of ex-cons and ex-drug dealers and crackheads getting recording contracts. This is only more proof of the sleazy state of the music industry today.  I wouldn't give you one cent for this cd. I can't stand this guy's droning voice. That &quot;In Da Club&quot; song has been played to death by pop radio stations and on every booming car stereo driven by 16-25 year old males who think the song is cool. Anyone who thinks 50 Cent is cool needs to seek therapy at once. Why are we worshipping and idolizing lowlife thugs who should never have been released from prison where they belong?? Oh, and that's really intellegent to bring your own son to your concert and endanger his life by putting him up on the stage in a bullet-proof vest. Really smart there! In ten years when they start releasing compilation cds of rap songs from the early 2000s, they'll put a song by 50 Cent on it, and people will be saying, &quot;Oh yeah, 50 Cent. Remember when everyone thought he was so great?&quot;In two years from now he'll be all but forgotten while the next rap star of the moment will come along to replace him. 50 Cent is only popular now because of MTV, pop radio, and marketing. I'd rather listen to Celine Dion...and i HATE, HATE, HATE her music. That's how badly i dislike 50 Cent. Anyone who would spend money on a 50 Cent cd is stupid.
B00006JDVV|2.0|Another Summer movie, another rip-off. This adheres blindly to the Bruckheimer rob-'em-blind formula - come up with a cool concept (check), a great poster (check), a cool cast (not quite, but at least Bale tries), shoot it entirely through an unattractive unnatural lens filter that bleeds out selected colours (triple check), pay yourself a s***load of money and then resolutely refuse to deliver because by the time they find out that there are no dragons in the film, they'll have already handed over their cash. This flick is the Holy Grail of false advertising. <br />Well, there are dragons - in extreme long shot for a few frames at a time - but put end-to-end, their total footage is barely two minutes. Dragons destroy the world! So what do we see? Newspaper headlines (astonishingly, there are no dragons at all in the end-of-civilisation-as-we-know-it montage). Skydivers attack dragon! So what do we see? A lot of cranked-up shots of clouds. Dragon attacks castle! So what do we see? A couple of brief long shots before cutting to people running around in cellars while the hero rides back just in time to see it leaving. Are you detecting a pattern here? <br /> <br />Instead, we get a non-script with a great back story (which would have made a much better film and has some pretty decent ideas in it) shot in a grotty disinterested fashion by a director who really doesn't seem to want to make a dragon movie at all. And as for the action scenes - what action scenes? Where the money went is anybody's guess, because it sure ain't on the screen: rarely has anyone spent so much money making a movie look so cheap. And what's with the sound mix? Between the cast's mumbling and the 'atmospherics,' half the dialogue was almost completely inaudible. <br /> <br />This could have been one of the coolest dragon flicks ever, but Bowman and co have ruined it for anyone else in the business with this dull, lifeless fire extinguisher of a movie. Still, maybe it's my own fault for ignoringthe fact that Gerard Butler was in it - his presence in a movie is as much a guarantee of a stinker as Virginia Madsen's was in the 80s. <br /> <br />See 'Dragonslayer' or even 'Dragonheart' instead - dragon movies which actually have dragons in them. If only this one could claim the same.  <br /> <br />The DVD offers a so-so package that's still better than the film (despite some excessive edge enhancement that gives characters a constant halo), although only one of the featurettes offers more than promo guff, while the interview with the curiously self-satisfied director makes you wonder if he's talking about another movie. Personally, I'd really, really like my money back. <br /> <br />
B000068OCS|5.0|I was 14 years old when I first watched the film. It has been a year now. Only now after watching the film a hundred times do I truly understand it. For some one to say that they dissliked the film, they would be very wrong. Did you watch the film, or did you lisen? Perhaps that is why no one speakes in the film. You have to put it in your own words and not just sit there like a puppet and have someone tell you what they what. This is the whole point of the film. Koyaanisqatsi shows how mankind is starting to destroy the world. Buliding bombs and having people work like robots. This is how we live day-to-day. I want to thank the author for such a great job on the film. This film truly moved me. I think that this film should to given to high schools to show students what the world is becoming, and how it is up to them to make a difference.
B00008PW2E|5.0|I LOVE SFU, this show gripped me from episode one.  It's quirky, clever, original.  The acting, writing and  direction...everything about it is fantastic. I have every episode taped, I got SFU season one immediately when it came out.  I just checked in here to see if it was available to put on my Chistmas list and was dissapointed to see it hasn't even been produced yet?  Well....put me on the list of people who are &quot;dying&quot; for it to come out.  I'm in withdrawals on Sunday nights until God knows when it's coming back?  ALSO...sorry just my opinion BUT, WHEN is Peter going to win an Emmy?  His portrayal is always excellent.  But this season his character grew as a person and showed so many more facets of his personality and ran the gamut of emotions.  FIVE STARS! Every episode is good, not a bad one in the bunch.  PLEASE RELEASE Thank you....
B00005JLRT|4.0|This explains it all:<BR>Even people I have talked to that are DEFFINITLY NOT Star Trek fans LOVED this movie!<br />I (as well as all of my &quot;NON-Star Trek Fan&quot; and &quot;Star Trek Fans&quot; friends) recommend this movie!
B00002ND77|5.0|The reviewer who writes below &quot;no,no,no!&quot; is being simplistic and stupid. This film paints the most balanced picture of malcolm ever produced. Please stop the muslim sensitivity here. Do you think Spike would defame the legacy of malcom purposely! Lighten up! This is America! Malcolm was human! He did right, he did wrong, but to shout &quot;no! no! no!&quot; is ludicrous! This movie is one of the best films ever made, and it is a tribute that is balanced, fair, and truthful! STOP BEING SO SENSITIVE!
B000001FO4|5.0|This album is by far Tom Keifer's best songwriting.  It's got just enough metal (Gypsy Road) mixed with a bluesy/southern thingy (Bad Seamstress Blues, intro to The Last Mile).  Although, I'll admit he went overboard with the bluesy/southern thingy on Heartbreak Station, but this album is up there with Back In Black and Appetite For Destruction, if you ask me.  It doesn't get much better than Bad Seamstress Blues/Fallin' Apart At The Seams or Last Mile or Gypsy Road or Don't Know What You Got 'till It's Gone...great from cover to cover.  Even the slide work on Take Me Back is brilliant.  I've read where Tom says he knows this is their best work and he wishes he could write another like this.<br />Stay away from Heartbreak Station or Still Climbing--the only decent songs on these discs are on the greatest hits album.<br />The only band to make the transition so far is L.A. Guns.  Their 'new' CD, Waking The Dead is great, by far the best 80's metal album since the 80's--from any band.
B00005JLKB|5.0|&quot;You should consider rounding those corners thats wont actually brake the sound barrier&quot;<br />AWESOME, anyone one who is a smallville fan should own this set
B00009APK1|2.0|You know, I really loved The Lord of the Rings, and thought the animation and special effects enhanced the storytelling in a truly amazing way. But for me, the special effects, animation, and computer manipulations took center stage to story telling in The Twin Towers and (the retelling of) the story suffered from a lack of imagination. After awhile, it was just one battle scene after another until I really didn't care any more.
0385504209|1.0|Probably the expectations were too high. The book came with rave reviews as being an intelligent religious thriller. It's probably intelligent, if you are seven years old. It starts off pretty well but then it is downhill all the way. Gaping holes in the plot, puerile puzzles, twists and cliches dampen any enthusiasm you may have. The characters are boring. Brown's enthusiasm in explaining concepts like the golden ratio is like that of a child who's just got a new toy and can't wait to show it off. While Brown insists on referring to his male characters by their last names, why he prefers to use the name Sophie and not Nevue is puzzling. All in all, you'd be better off re-reading Foucault's Pendulum.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Every once and a while, there's an band that I listen to that will take my breath away, and The Mars Volta is one of them. I can't even begin to describe the sound of Mars Volta, it's just so complex and beautiful. I would definatly reccomend this album to anyone.
B000002J0P|4.0|A solid debut release by Crosby, Stills, and Nash.  These three guys feed off each other very well.  Marakesh Express, Long Time Gone, and Wooden Ships are the three stand out pieces.  Marakesh Express features a joyful vocal performance by Nash accompanied by a cutesy organ passage.  Long Time Gone and Wooden Ships have compelling hooks around the chorus passages.<br /><br />This is not to undermine the other songs on the record.  Pre Downs Road features a stunning guitar and keyboard passage that Steely Dan would later on borrow.  Helplessly Hoping and Guinnevere both feature gorgeous vocal harmonies.  And the other unmentioned tunes certainly feature some ear catching elements.<br /><br />I am kind of intrigued by David Cosby's contributions the most.  His tunes captured the turbulent times of the 60's.  I kind of wish he had a little moe vocal time and Stills a little less.  Nonetheless, all three are talented.
B00005JKZV|3.0|First of all, I will not read over 1100 reviews to see if anybody else mentions these two problems, so I will state them for what they are worth and hope to appeal to those who do not confuse &quot;helpful&quot; with &quot;he agrees with what I think.&quot;<br />I realized half way through the first episode that I could not understand or hear more than half of the dialogue. This recent trend of whispering lines has reached nonsensical proportions in all films today. It was only an hour into Two Towers that I noticed I could bring up English subtitles. Now, that I should need them at all for a film that is supposed to be in English is disgraceful. Perhaps in a theatre, this problem would not be as acute; but a DVD should at least be audible, despite the Director's attempts to make it otherwise. (If an animated character like Gollum is utterly incomprehensible, then that is the fault of the Director also, not of the DVD.)<br />The second problem is that films like these become a matter of &quot;Look what my computer experts can do!&quot; rather than relying on human actors and ingenious directing. It is all very imposing for a few moments and then you realize how little STORY is being told while long sequences of obviously computer-animated individuals or armies are trying to make you feel you are getting your money's worth.<br />I know this will interpreted as an attack on beloved child by many readers who have never known what magic films like &quot;Casablanca&quot; and &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; can accomplish with purely human resources, squares screens and black and white film. They would be wrong. I am only trying to point out how much BETTER these Ring films would be without the concept that More is Better.
0316779237|5.0|I limit my reading of Mr. Sedaris's works to the privacy of my home, as the involuntary bouts of snorting laughter his works produce in me prove too disruptive in public.
B000084HAJ|4.0|This inspired version of Monteverdi's \\"Vespro della Beata Vergine\\" by John Eliot Gardiner I first saw on Christmas 1989 as a BBC simulcast. So many years later, as a DVD, its innovative rendering is as fresh as ever and the picture quality is holding up reasonably well too. For me this performance is still the best version of Monteverdi's master work.<br />John Eliot Gardiner researched this work thoroughly. There is no gimmickry in his rendition, but it feels as if in his mind's eye he had collaborated across the centuries with the ancient composer to produce a truly outstanding performance. We are all familiar with Gardiner's masterly use of early instruments and the careful selection and balancing of soloists voices and this performance makes full use of all of this.<br />The obvious choice of the location for this performance was Venice's San Marco, where Monteverdi spent much of his career. But it is far from obvious how John Eliot Gardiner used the near perfect acoustic space of this church. Every voice and instrument is placed just right to render a superb sound picture. The \\"Vespers\\" ranges from powerful full sound of orchestra and singers to intimate love songs. In support of the need of this diversity Gardiner makes the singers change positions to the various balconies and alcoves throughout the performance. This is a truly memorable performance.<br />I deducted one star of my ratings for the regrettable omission of the subtitles from the original BBC telecast.
B00006GFAB|2.0|I'm sorry KISS fans, I can't take no more. Yes I am a KISS soldier in the KISS Army. In fact I have probably been promoted to Lieutenant General by now. But enough is enough already!<br />Can you believe the promotional sticker on this album says 'Featuring Rock n Roll all Nite as heard on That 70's Show'? Run that by me again? Is there no end to this? Hey I love that song as much as the next KISS fan, but how many times do you have to purchase that song? Let's see.....<br />1. Dressed to Kill<br />2. Alive!<br />3. Double Platinum<br />4. Killers<br />5. Smashes, Thrashes, and Hits<br />6. The Kiss Box Set<br />7. 20th Century Remasters<br />8. ALIVE III<br />9. ALIVE IV<br />10. The Very Best of KISS<br />11. KISS Greatest Hits<br />I'm sure I missed one or two, but I've made my point. If you're a KISS fan, why bother buying this? No doubt in your CD collection you probably have every one of these songs at least three times over.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer is a CD of pure beauty.  Each CD shows Radiohead as a more mature band, and this CD was no exception.  The leap from The Bends to OK Computer is astounding, the thought and creativity that went into this album is seen in very few albums to date.  Like all Radiohead CDs, a few listens are needed to pierce its cold exterior.  Once you find your way in, be prepared for an insightful journey that will make you think twice about the not so distant future we live in.
B00008LOS1|5.0|This album has it all - rock anthems, themes, incredibly progressive music that still stands the test of time. The remastered disc one sounds great, and disc two is a gem - the legendary concert from the Young Vic theatre that was supposed to be the genesis of Lifehouse is incredibly crisp. Since there are not a lot of live releases of The Who from this era, that makes this release even more essential. Overall, this is simply the best rock and roll album ever made.
B00005JLKB|5.0|That's how fast I became addicted to the series that I, amongst others, referred to as &quot;Superman's Creek&quot; upon first learning of the premise. I jumped in midway through season 2 at the urging of a roommate. Now I'm visiting the episodes from season 1, complete with all the original music in tact (commercial-free!) and loving every minute of it.<br />The first season falls victim to what we'd call the &quot;monster-of-the-week&quot; syndrome, in which most episodes contain a villain who used to be a normal Smallville citizen until they were exposed to some form of kryptonite. Once exposed, the villains either go mad or want some sort of revenge and it's up to Clark to save the day.<br />So there's the formula... but about a third of the way into the season, we come to realize there's so much more going on. For instance, Lex Luthor's obsession with figuring out what makes Clark so special begins to eat away at him. Clark just can't figure out what he really wants from Lana... or Chloe. And he keeps discovering new abilities.<br />Even beginning with the first episode (and look at the cover of this DVD, for crying out loud!), the creators surround us with so much symbolism regarding what the Superman legend will become (although it will likely never go too far in this series), tantalizing us with lines like this one from Lex to Clark: &quot;Our friendship will be the stuff of legend.&quot; Just watch the Pilot episode and that will reel you in. It got me hooked and I'm plowing through this whole season in only a couple of days.<br />I'm a diehard fan of &quot;The West Wing&quot; and even I have to admit this is fun and entertaining television that's more than just something the kiddies can enjoy. Indulge. Now.
B00009W0WM|4.0|Finally we have a serious 2 disc set with interesting material gathered for the true fan of this classic movie. This is the most perfectly cut movie ever made. Every scene is memorable and no film is wasted. If the film has a weakness, it is that too many drinks are served to characters who never drink them!Included in the special DVD are musical cuts of &quot;Sam&quot; working on tunes to be used in the movie and also a few that were not included. There is an interesting commentary by Roger Ebert but incredibly he blunders during the &quot;Flashback&quot; as he can't correlate Ilsa's husband being discovered in a railroad car still alive with her strange behavior toward Rick in &quot;Le Belle Aurore&quot;! Either he has not been around women enough to recognize the symptoms or it went over his head. (I am not sure which)He is too engrossed with Ilsa when she appears again in Casablanca and requests Sam to play &quot;As Time Goes By&quot; and the facial expression that Rick displays upon laying his eyes on her again. (He mentions this at least twice and perhaps a third time) We also get a good dose of the children of the stars and Lauren (bogey's real wife,well at least the last one)Bacall gives us a nice introduction. The art on the DVD's are great! Also exposed at last is that the advance info of Ron Reagan for the role was FICTION. The deleted scenes are a disappointment. There is no commentary and only two of the same scene are shown. Namely, the prison set-up of Lazlo with Rick agreeing on the money for the highly sought papers. Good for advocates of this movie and if you have the time to delve into the special Disc it will be an interesting experience.
B00005QCYC|3.0|This is more a review of the box set. My room-mate has the 2disc box set (before JIII came out) and I have the DTS edition of Jurassic Park. The difference between the DTS 5.1 on mine and the Dolby Digital on his is astounding. Remember that Steven Spielberg pioneered DTS (Digital Theatre Sound) and this was the first movie to have it. Do yourself a favour if you have a home theatre system and make sure you buy these movies separately with the DTS track on them. It's unbelievable. And with Spielberg signing on to direct Jurassic Park IV and Michael Crichton possibly writing it I would suggest staying away from box sets for the most part unless, like Godfather, you can be sure another sequel is impossible.<br /><br />EDIT - FEB 2011 - of course with the trilogy now available on Blu-ray there's really no reason to try and track down this item anymore.<br /><br />Blu-ray listing - [[ASIN:B0057R5XRG Jurassic Park Ultimate Trilogy (Blu-ray + Digital Copy)]]
B00006RCLQ|5.0|Carnival of Souls aka \\"Corridors of Evil\\", is a crowning jewel in American Cinema. Despite the low budget and poor film quality, this 1962 masterpiece stands as a cult more than 40 years after it's release. Candice Hilligoss' fine performance will overwhelm you as she portrays a character caught in a purgatory between life and death. Her beauty alone will strike the viewer in a way few actresses can. Her physical acting, facial gestures, and line delivery will leave you wondering why this woman did not become a household name like Marilyn Monroe or Raquel Welch.<br />The story is as simple as it is complex. A woman is an innocent passenger in a car that gets into a drag race with some teenage thugs. The result is her car going over a bridge into a fast running, sandy river. As she crawls out of the wreckage covered in mud, the viewer thinks she has survived, but has she?<br />Ms. Hilligoss' character is a musician, an organist to be exact who takes a job as a church organist in Salt Lake City, Utah. As she begins her journey she is terrified of images of a phantom of sorts who seems to be seeking her out. Anyone who has driven for an average of twelve hours straight can tell you that driving can take its toll, and the mind can play tricks on a sleepy driver. However, after she checks into her room, she finds the same phantom lurking in the window, then in the hallway. Who is this creature, what does he want, where is he from?<br />The main point of the film is not horror, but human nature. Are we all alone in this world? Is everyone an island unto themselves. The lesson is thrown upon our character by a minister, a psychologist, and a would be male suitor. They all try to help her in their own way (except the suitor who is only interested in her for a chance to have sex). But our character waves a hand at them all, convinced that she can do it her own way. She is an independent woman who needs no man or companionship; a view that may have gone against society's thinking in 1962.<br />The male suitor (or `just your normal guy' as he likes to call himself) is an obnoxious oaf to say the least. His headstrong pursuit of her is only his own selfish desire to have her. He's not an alcoholic he claims, yet he drinks at dawn. He quit college because he doesn't like to learn. This is not an ideal resume for a long term relationship for her or any other woman. When she is truly frightened by the visiting spectre, and she reaches out to him as a last resort for help, he runs. Not wanting to get involved, he was only interested in her for her body and his own sexual desire. Yet another lesson in this film for all the young ladies who care to pay attention.<br />As the story goes on Candace's soul seems to deteriorate. She slips in and out of reality and a strange sort of parallel world. This dimension looks the same as real life, but she cannot be seen or heard. The department store dressing room for example, shows how the lost spirit must learn that she is no longer of this world, but now belongs in the spirit world, where yet another companion awaits her.<br />Who is this man that haunts her in visions? We see at the end of the film that they are to be together forever. In the final seen where we see Candace's peek at her after-life. She screams in horror as the ghosts dance eternally as the haunt the carnival. She is finally captured by the ghosts and is spirited away. The police and minister are confused and baffled as her footprints and final body print leads nowhere. The minister gives a knowing look as if he has known all along, but says nothing.<br />The minister must have known there was something wrong with his new organist when he first met and eventually fired her. She had not the soul of a musician, she only had a knowledge for music. She was told this too by the organ builder in the beginning of the film. When she is possessed in the church and her true musician ship comes out as she plays without control, that is her truespirit, but the misinster fires her for `blasphony'.<br />This film cannot be watched once and dismissed. It deserves to be watched over and over again. It is a timeless movie where something seems new every time you watch it. I applaud you `Carnival of Souls'. One of the greatest movies ever made.spirit, but the misinster fires her for `blasphony'.<br />This film cannot be watched once and dismissed. It deserves to be watched over and over again.

B000002J1U|5.0|Led Zeppelin III continued the band's maturity and versatility. Where their first album relied more on blues and their second release was filled with songs based on excellent guitar riffs, Led Zeppelin III added folk and country to their ever expanding musical melting pot. These influences would stay with the band throughout their career and would lead to their most enduring track \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" on Led Zeppelin IV.<br /><br />Although this is clearly their most acoustic album, there are still strong influences here from their first two albums. \\"Since I Have Been Loving You\\", the album's best track, is one of their best blues tunes ever and features a great vocal performance from Robert Plant. \\"Out On The Tiles\\" and \\"Immigrant Song\\" are both solid heavy rockers with killer riffs. \\"Celebration Day\\" is also a strong rocking track. But it's the acoustic fare that makes up the bulk of the material here and it's all performed well. \\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\\" is a great acoustic rave-up. \\"Hats Off To (Roy) Harper\\" is an acoustic blues with Plant's vocals sounding like they were recorded on an old 78 record. It's screwed up, but it adds to the album's diversity. \\"Gallows Pole\\" starts out with Plant's vocals over Jimmy Page's acoustic guitar and grows in tempo and volume as the track goes on. \\"Tangerine\\" and \\"That's The Way\\" are both great folk songs. \\"Friends\\" is most emotional track with its passionate lyrics, great acoustic riff, and its string accompaniment. This is a great album that's rarely mentioned among their best but deserves to be. Highly recommended.
B0000C8AW7|5.0|Bob Dylan is back. And after a five year wait; so are we. His new album entitled &quot;Love and Theft&quot; has been recieving high acclaim from all around the continent. His astoundnig lyrics and vibrant melodies are stunning. This is the perfect follow up to his previous album, &quot;Time Out of Mind&quot;- the darker, less laidback studio album. When we listen to the music on the new remastered SACD's, one can only realize that the time to listen is now. It's way more rewarding than one would ever imagine. Surround Sound is featured on this particular album. (Alike five others in the fifteen album re-release series). Pick it up for sure if you're into Bob, or if you think you may like to hear some of his stuff. It's a great place to start. So why not?...
B00005YXZH|5.0|A truly incredible album. Yankee Hotel Foxtrot finally shows that there are still bands out there worth listening to that are still great bands that aren't hip, post-ironic blatant retreads of rock's history. Lyrically, this album is pitch-perfect- one only needs to listen to &quot;Poor Places&quot; to realize that- but the total idea of this album, formation and disentegration, is so brilliantly pursued in the &quot;noise&quot; aspect that it is difficult not to realize the symphonic genius of Wilco. Buy it today.
B00005QXDD|4.0|Tenacious D's self-titled album is great. The band is two strong -- Jack Black and Kyle Gass. Black is the best known of the two, famous now as an actor, with big roles in the films _Saving Silverman_, _Orange County_, and _Shallow Hal_ (in which Gass had a brief comic appearance as Black's square co-worker). (At this writing an upcoming movie starring Black, _School of Rock_, is drawing uniformly outstanding reviews.) The album features twenty-one songs, and it's a triumvirate of rock, humor, and tale-telling. The rock is aggressive, like Dio; dark, like Black Sabbath; ambitious, like Rush. The humor is universal, seeking and destroying targets nearly anyone could relate to, like the annoyance of having a fast food worker offer you some food automatically, regardless of what you've just ordered (a delightful sketch indeed when Black tells a fast food worker who has just offered him special curly fries, \\"Don't offer me anything! I'll tell _you_ what I want!\\"). And the tale-telling is fantastic -- in one remarkable tale, Black tells how he and Gass were waylaid on a lonely road in the dark of night by a demon, who ordered them to play the best song in the world, which, much to their happiness, they found themselves able to do. All of which is enough to sell some albums, sure, but not enough to garner the tremendously devoted following Tenacious D has, described by some even as cult-like. To this reviewer, to gain such a following an additional ingredient is needed, on top of the rock, the humor, and the tale-telling -- earnestness. Kind of an outdated term, the adjective \\"earnest,\\" but indeed this quality is, to this reviewer, that which gives Tenacious D the devoted following it has (and likewise Black as an actor -- as his turn in the film _High Fidelity_ has drawn more talk of \\"scene-stealing\\" than perhaps any other turn in recent memory (when in fact Black didn't as much steal a scene or the movie but pick up and walk away with the theater)). Websters defines \\"earnest\\" as \\"serious in intention, purpose or effort.\\" And what's important to note is that that \\"intention, purpose, or effort\\" can be to make one laugh, to make one be amused, to make one be entertained. But what \\"earnest\\" implies is a real passion and intensity behind the action. So to this reviewer, \\"earnest\\" is a marvelous and grossly underused word to describe someone who plainly believes in himself, who pours his guts into what he does, who will not yield to convention if he believes convention to be wrong, who is respectful of another but really does not care what opinion another might hold of him -- he knows what he wants to do, and he will do it with no apologies to anyone or anything. That is earnest. That is what Tenacious D has in spades -- plain to any observer. And this \\"earnestness\\" contrasts richly with today's dominant mode of humor -- irony.  Indeed, today irony rules the roost.  If there are doubts, the reader can perform an experiment.  Gather together a group of twenty-somethings.  Screen the film _Some Like It Hot_. Observe the twenty-somethings' reactions when Jack Lemmon tells Joe E. Brown that he's a man, and Joe E. Brown says, \\"Nobody's perfect.\\" What will you have? A roomful of bitter scoffs. Why? Certainly not because the line isn't funny. It's maybe the best line in any movie ever, to this reviewer. So why would twenty-somethings today not laugh? Because the line is an earnest joke. And because today the roost is ruled by irony. If it's 110 degrees outside and someone sweltering in the heat says, \\"I see the cold front came in,\\" maybe that will get some laughs today. But such laughs are cheap and with little value, and, at their heart, negative, as irony destroys the language used to deliver the irony, and, eventually, the user of irony himself. (If you destroy your language, how long can you last as \\"yourself\\"?) Thus irony is precisely the opposite of \\"earnest.\\" But yet while Tenacious D is earnest -- passionate, intense, plainly believing in themselves -- the band is not serious, as serious implies lack of humor. And all of this -- this apparent problem of trying to decide how to describe the band, what terms to use -- suggests that Tenacious D may have blazed a trail into unmapped artistic territory. It calls to mind Claude Monet exhibiting his painting \\"Impression: Sunrise\\" and a critic dismissing Monet as an \\"impressionist.\\"  The point is, just as Monet broke with the Realist painters, Black and Gass have broken with standard music by incorporating humor into their act -- and now critics are unsure of what to call the band, how to describe the band. Indeed, it would seem you can see critics' uncertainty on how to describe the band in even the questions they ask Black and Gass, the critics asking Black and Gass if the band is \\"sincere\\" or \\"serious\\".  Surely, the band is far from ironic, and another frequently applied term \\"satirical,\\" seems off as well, as satire is a form of irony that seeks to destroy its object through ridicule. (Not that Tenacious D doesn't destroy with its humor -- it's just that there's nothing ironic about verbally incinerating a fast food worker for his robotic-ness.) So often labeled \\"ironic\\" or \\"satirical,\\" Tenacious D is the opposite precisely -- the band is entirely earnest. Earnestly funny -- and earnestly rocking.  And so in times such as these of hesitation before speaking one's mind, in times of such irony, Tenacious D is a refreshing rebellion. It works to prove a point. If you believe something with enough force, soon others will believe it too, and before long you may realize you've started a movement no one can stop. A delightful album. Have a listen.

B000002H97|4.0|Metallica, also known as The Black Album, is one of the biggest selling albums of all time and made them the biggest band in the world. Starting with this album, the band concentrated on shorter tracks which were less adventurous than their previous work. The album spawned several hit singles which comprised of  both simpler tracks based on in your face riffs and memorable ballads. It also had an outstanding production which was sorely missed on their previous album ...And Justice For All. This was also the first album that the band made that wasn't excellent from beginning to end and would point to the band's creative downward spiral.<br />Metallica also showed a maturity in James Hetfield's vocals as he began singing in a more evil and raspier tone reminiscent of Southern rock on the heavier tracks and in a mellower tone on the slower tracks. &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, which has become their most popular song, was based on a simple yet effective riff and still sounds fresh. &quot;The Unforgiven&quot; is one of their better ballads, with some of Hetfield's most heartfelt vocals during the chorus. &quot;Sad But True&quot;, &quot;The God That Failed&quot;, and &quot;Wherever I May Roam&quot; are all excellent tracks based on riffs that groove rather than the chugging riffs of their previous albums. &quot;Holier Than Thou&quot; and &quot;Through The Never&quot; shows that the band hasn't forgotten their thrash roots and are both strong tracks. &quot;Nothing Else Matters&quot; would be the first ballad they'd record which was slow the whole way through and didn't feature an outro which relied more on thrash like &quot;One&quot; or &quot;Welcome Home (Sanitarium).&quot;<br />Unfortunately, this album was their first to have any filler and would lead to the overall lackluster songwriting of their next studio albums Load and Reload. Tracks such as &quot;Of Wolf And Man&quot;, &quot;My Friend Of Misery&quot;, and &quot;Don't Tread On Me&quot; were not up to par and never grabbed your attention. Nonethless, the high points clearly outweigh the low ones here and they haven't made an album this good since.grabbed your attention. Nonethless, the high points clearly outweigh the low ones here and they haven't made an album this good since.
B000089RVX|5.0|I first listened to &quot;Bring Me to Life,&quot; &quot;My Immortal,&quot; and &quot;Going Under&quot; in that order. Amy Lee's voice is truly amazing. Each song on Fallen is different, in my opinion. With songs like &quot;Going Under&quot; that just literally gets you up on your feet and songs like &quot;My Imortal&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot; that makes you feel good when you are in a sad mood. This is one of my favorite bands. Buy this album. All the songs are good.<br />My personal favorites on the album are &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot; and &quot;Hello.&quot;
B00006LLNU|5.0|The idea that these brilliant artists are anything less than God's gift to the otherwise nearly dead genre of decent music would leave anyone who has heard their work aghast.  These people raise the bar for all musicians who have heard their work.
B000002H97|5.0|What an amazing album! Believe it or not, I just listened to it tonight in my friend's car, and I am hooked! I read the lyrics while we drove along, and in an instant I grasped the essence of this album, and of Metallica. The ego. The self. Inidividualism. The human spirit. Freedom. Liberty. Capitalism. America. A bold statement against neo-liberal fascism. The sanctity of the individual.<br />No wonder the Russian youth went berserk when Metallica played in the USSR shortly before the demise of the evil Soviet Empire. The Russians were the longest-suffering people on earth, and being at a Metallica concert, hearing songs that affirmed freedom, the natural and proper state for man to live in (but sadly so few of us do, and it will all be over within 50 years), must have had a shocking impact, like throwing ice-cold water over the face of someone just waking up from a coma.<br />I hope all Metallica fans truly realize the life-affirming philosophy that drives their music. It has been a positive influence on teenagers for 20 years. This is a musical masterpiece, and although it took me 12 years to find it, I'll never be without it again. I just wish Ayn Rand could have had the chance to hear it.
B00006SFBD|4.0|When I first heard Deliverance, I thought it was definitely good, but not up to Opeth's standards.<br />I was wrong.<br />After nearly 10 months of listening to this album on a surprisingly regular basis, I only just now realized that it's my favorite Opeth album, and quite possibly their best. Why? Because it's coherent. This music isn't simple by any means, but they just make it seem that easy. All of the separate parts of their music have finally fused together absolutely seamlessly and created Deliverance. It may not seem as complex as Morningrise or My Arms Your Hearse, but it's just because they've done a better job at hiding the complexity.<br />Two comments about the album...<br />1.) Deliverance, the title track, is worth the $15 dollars you'll pay for this album. That's not exaggeration. If this CD was 13 minutes long, and only contained that one track, I'd buy it in a heartbeat. A previous review mentioned how &quot;hypnotic&quot; the final repeated riff is. I can truthfully say that when I first heard it, I nearly fainted. No joke. I heard the riff, and started laughing joyously at how great it was. Then it kept going. And KEPT GOING. And GOT BIGGER. AND BIGGER. And I kept on lauging (in awe) so hard for three whole minutes that I basically lost bloodflow in my head and fell over. Thankfully I was in my bedroom and just fell onto my bed. Either way, &quot;Deliverance&quot; is THAT good.<br />2.) The only thing on this album that disappoints me is the beginnings to most of the songs. For the most part, they all seem sort of mediocre until a minute or two into them, when they get REALLY good. That's the only thing keeping my review at 4 stars instead of 5.<br />Anyhow, while the follow up &quot;Damnation&quot; is the only recent Opeth album I'd refer to as &quot;just pretty good&quot;, I wait in anticipation and a bit of fear for the next &quot;real&quot; Opeth album (read: heavy). I can't wait to hear what they have to offer next,  but I fear it just won't be able to live up to Deliverance's expectations.
B000006OS2|1.0|A very bad copy for a DVD, my VHS copy is much better. Some scenes are out of focus. Some frames are off center. I'd look for a better edition.
B00003CXB4|5.0|The Lion King is another Disney movie that people of all ages will enjoy.  It has a wonderful story (which all the other reviews will go into detail about), music by Elton John and such hits as \\"Circle of Life,\\" \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight?\\" and \\"Akuna Matata\\", this is a movie everyone should keep in their DVD collection!  Don´t miss out on buying it before it´s too late.
B00005OAIE|5.0|I have listened to this album a number of times and I think it is absolutely amazing!! John Mayer is a very talented musician. The thing I like most about the album is that I can relate to his songs. He is an amazing performer and artist and I can't wait to listen to his next CD.
B000002LFU|3.0|Even though this album had some great songs, I would argue that it was greatly inferior to the work this band had done earlier. It became clear to those of us who had revered the music from the IRS years that REM would sell out and go commercial. Indeed, this is exactly what happened. REM changed their direction and became increasingly rich but more and more irrelevent. Ahh, a sad old story...
B000000WJZ|5.0|Although I beleive that Adore is the best Smashing Pumpkins album, I also need to give Siamese Dream second. From the opening drum roll to the last chord, it is a masterpeice. And although it is true that Billy Corgan recorded every guitar and bass part on the album, the band wouldn't have been anything without the unrivaled ethereal guitar playing of James Iha and the rhythmic bass of D'arcy Wretzky. This album may have been made by two people, but tracks like &quot;Soma&quot; and &quot;Mayonaise&quot; (some of the best on the album) would not have been made if it weren't for James Iha. The album takes you through many stages of musical enjoyment, whether it be the angst filled lyrics of &quot;Quiet&quot; or the joyous sounds of &quot;Today&quot;. Whether it be the sorrow of &quot;Disarm&quot; of the punk rock revival of &quot;Geek USA&quot;, this album is a must have for any Noise Pop enthusiast. The Smashing Pumpkins are the kings of rock and roll.
B00008H2LE|1.0|i wasted 16$ on this cd do not make the same mistake don't even waste your time downloading it
B00006RU5B|5.0|You have to get this cd it really is just top of line work. They have very inspiring lyrics and its just truely beautiful. Do yourself a favor and buy this cd because its like looking at god and having him smile with greatness at you.
B00004YW6I|5.0|I have been waiting to actually pick up this CD for a little over year, and still have not untill yesterday. And I am so sorry that I just didn't buy it ASAP. This CD is amazing !! I dont know how much more I can express how excellent this CD is. And I love the fact, that it revolves around New York (which I love). Every song on this album is beautifully written and is quite refreshing to listen to. If you love PJ Harvey, and you dont have this CD. Buy it Now !! This album totally blew me away, and has made my 4 Top CD's I own list. Go get it, and blast the volume on each track.
B00009ATIX|1.0|Being a philospher and a working artist myself I was really excited about this film. This story has so much potential, it brings together all sorts of interesting questions about love, afterlife, grief, time etc.  But the film does a really bad job of handling these questions.  First of all the underlying philosophy never seems to surface in a real way, meaning that it vaguely brings out the questions and does not try to bring out the argumentation.  Because philosophy is not just questions or perspectives it is an argumentation of some sort of an issue or a question.  If you don't have the argumentation you loose the philosophy.  And that does not mean that questions have to be answered either.  <br />George Clooney does an OK job of being the main character, he does not have the acting skills or the necessary strong presence to carry out this film all by himself.  Natascha McElhone does even a worse job then he does.  I don't know if it is their poor skills to blame or poor directing.  Their love is the core of the whole film and not once does the audience sense their love or any chemistry between them for that matter.  They are totally unbelievable and Natascha never gives you the feeling that there is something under her cool surface.  She is just like a beautiful photo reading out the script slowly and always avoiding changing her tone of voice.  <br />The directors choice of making the film, cool and slow paced does not automatically make it artistic or interesting.  I have never been impressed by Soderbergh's so called artistic talent because I have never witnessed it.  He doesn't handle the project of Solaris and should stick to things he is good at like doing regular mediocre films like Erin Brokovich.
B00006879E|5.0|all i have to say is 5 StArS
B00009TB5G|5.0|Without doubt, the Two Towers ranks among the most accomplished epic films ever produced.  It is a superb achievement, and watching the DVD is pure enjoyment.  Despite the movie's many departures from the book, overall the high quality of the production still does justice to the story.  We all know the technical limitations of bringing such a complex and intricate literature to the screen, and a movie is a different medium from a book. The changes highlight the more dramatic parts of the tale, and most can be forgiven (except perhaps a few silly melodramatic moments like the two peasant kids from the Westfold being parted from their mother, that the movie could do better without).  The inner details may be changed, but the broad outlines of the painting remain faithful.<br />Like the Fellowship of the Ring, everything about TTT is first-rate, down to the last detail, with spectacular cinematography and special effects, and great acting.  The winning performance, interestingly, is that of Gollum: the CGI is almost perfect, and the facial expressions, voice and acting (by Andy Serkis) impressively portray the creature as the ultimate addict, and his struggle to redeem himself.  In contrast, Elijah Wood's performance of Frodo is disappointing: his portrayal of the gradual corruption of Frodo's spirit by the ring is limited to looking stressed-out and rolling his eyes up.<br />The movie is very fast-paced with three story lines, and unlike the Fellowship, which has more charm, there isn't much opportunity for character development (especially and unfortunately for Faramir).  But the focus is no longer on Frodo, thus allowing more chance for the other characters to shine.  More speaking parts for Legolas (to the delight of his fans), making him less aloof and more \\"human\\" (such as his despair before the battle) hence more intimate.  Similarly with Gimly, Merry, and Pippin, we see more of their characters coming out than in the first movie.  <br />The battle scenes are abit prolonged and may be too violent for younger viewers, but well done.  Peter Jackson balanced the intense battle actions with emotionalism, such as the despair of facing impossible odds, in Theoden's monologue and his question, \\"what can Men do in the face of such reckless hate?\\" (a question that is all the more present in these days of terrorism).  The involvement of the elves is another departure that has often been lamented, but one that is actually not too far from the book: in preparing for the battle at Helm's Deep, Legolas had wished for 100 archers from Mirkwood to help with the defenses.  Tolkien meant the war of the rings to be between the race of men and evil forces, without the interference of the elves, who are no longer concerned with the affairs of humans as they're leaving Middle Earth.  But there are exceptions, as when Elrond sends his two sons to fight alongside Aragorn in the last battle.  The movie version expands on this, with Elrond sending elves to aid in the battle of Helm's Deep.  It is a touching addition, but not without a sense of futility.  Haldir's death is particularly poignant, as he fell wondering why the sacrifices of so many elves, otherwise free to leave Middle Earth.<br />The theatrical version of the DVD is certainly worth watching and owning.  However, with the upcoming extended version that promises to be richer and more enjoyable, it is a difficult decision whether to suggest purchasing both versions or waiting for the extended version.
0385335482|5.0|If you are addicted to shopping, but an avid reader, this is the book for you!  I have read every book in the series, and am waiting somewhat impatiently for the fourth book to come out in March 2004. I love every book by Sophie Kinsella, what a great author!
B0000DBJDM|5.0|This is a fantastic look at the early Floyd, right before they became the musical juggernaut that defined them for the rest of their career. This is the band as they were refining their musical prowess with the turning point track \\"Echoes\\", from their forthcoming album \\"Meddle\\" at the time of filming the live sequences that encompass this opus. This track paved the way for their musical direction from then on. It also focuses on the recording of the \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" album which would change them forever and eventually lead the way to their disillusion and disintegration. But here, the band is still happy with the direction they are heading and everyone is on the same page musically. It is interesting to see the naivete of the band in the interview sequences of the band in the Abbey Road Studios canteen while recording \\"Dark Side\\", especially in anticipating their future. Little did they know that things were about to change for better and worse. This film is the last glimpse of the innocent, little cult band that was about to change the musical landscape of the world.
B0000BYM3K|2.0|I've been listening to Maiden since 1980 when DiAnno and Burr were in the band, and truly this is one of the worst.  Maybe it's the state of music today, I don't know.  But this is crap like anything Brittany Spears puts out.  I haven't found a song I would go back and listen to again and again.  I was hoping for a better performance.  It is a desparate day when Nikko McBrain is brought in to help lyrically; there is a first for everything!  Jannick Gers what the are you doing in this band?<br />All in all, a poor showing.  No more galloping bass lines from Steve Harris, no more soaring solos from Adrian Smith, and Bruce Dickinson, to his credit, came prepared for this production.  Nikko is a great drummer but I think he is a sleep on this one.<br />The sound quality is junk.  Kevin Shirley you blessed this recording?  Shameful.  Why do you insist on three guitarists?  There is no distinction between them.  Who's who?<br />And RIAA wonders why people download songs for free when $15.00 gets you a ONE song CD!
B00008NRLX|5.0|Hi Folks,<BR> I woke up on September 28, 2003, to a show on the &quot;Arts and Entertainment&quot; Channel to first hear the &quot;The Jayhawks&quot;. They are great, they remind me of &quot;Cat Stevens&quot; and the &quot;Gin Blossoms&quot;, who if memory serves me took awhile to get noticed as well. After hearing the band, I ran out to get the CD, &quot;Rainy Day Music&quot;. My favorite songs on the album are &quot;Stumbling Through the Night&quot;, and &quot;Save It For A Rain Day&quot;. I have had a feeling about quite a few bands before they hit the big time and I feel that, &quot;The Jayhawks&quot; are right on the edge of something big. No one liked the &quot;Gin Blossoms&quot; when I did or &quot;U2&quot;. So I hope the rest of the country gets with it soon. This is a great album and a great band. Good Luck Guys.
B000063DI9|3.0|The first impression you get of a band is usually the one that sticks with you; the way they present themselves early in their career is what we can assume to be their preferred artistic style. I officially came onboard in 1983 after hearing 'Flight of Icarus' and thinking it was the greatest thing: heavy but melodic, with excellent musicians and great vocals. And I mean HEAVY. Fabulous. I was hooked. The liner notes to 'Piece of Mind' stated &quot;No synthesizers or Ulterior Motives.&quot; Great, I thought, these guys believe in true metal! Then came 'Powerslave', which was more of the same. Awesome! <BR>Suddenly, we get 'Somewhere in Time'. Hmmm....guitar synthesizers. I approached it with caution and found that, despite the muddy production, it still kicked some ass. The synthesizers weren't THAT intrusive, so I dealt with it. I was a little worried about 'Wasted Years' and it's overtly commercial tone, but Adrian's solo was so good that I quickly forgot my concerns. <BR>Then we get 7th Son. Hmmm...even more synthesizers....even more commercial songs...what happened to the guitars? I think I hear them but I'm not quite sure.....permy hair-dos....oh crap!!! This can't be! Fancy new stage outfits! AAAARRRGGGHHH!<BR><BR>The praise this album gets mystifies me. It represents Maiden at it's most commercial and most lightweight. For someone who got into them with Piece of Mind, thinking that was how they wanted to sound, this was a nightmare. It sounds nothing like their previous albums, and therefore sounds nothing like the style they became famous with, which is what attracted the original fans anyway. You don't get into a band thinking &quot;well this is good, but I hope they mellow out and get all prissy after a while.&quot; And all the arguments of &quot;progession!&quot; can't possibly mean that they should &quot;progress&quot; into radio-friendly music and lighten up their tone, can they? This album has very little musical progression, just musical softening.<BR>Storywise it's Steve Harris at his most pretentious. Of course, he thinks he's being clever because this album is the 7th album from the 7th line-up of the band or something, but must we be subjected to this barely intelligible concept of some mystical kid who will be, as far as I can tell, either the anti-christ or the new messiah, depending on which side converts him? More religious garbage. &quot;Infinite Dreams&quot;...there he goes with more of his dream crap again. <BR>Musically it introduced his outlandish belief that beginning a song with a bass line (The Clairvoyant) was interesting to anyone other than himself. That technique hasn't worked since 'Wrathchild'. Sure, Adrian's true love for commercial songs had a lot to do with the poppy sound, but Steve's name is on both of those singles as well. If it hadn't been for Adrian and his superb compositional talents ('Icarus', 2 Minutes', '22 Acacia Ave.',' The Prisoner'), many of Maiden's best songs wouldn't exist, but Steve just put too much trust in him this time around. However, Adrian's solos are some of his finest here.<BR><BR>The production is dismal. Perhaps Martin Birch realized that the album's content did not deserve anything better. The guitars are pathetically low in the mix and have no clarity or definition, whilst the keyboards/synths are up front and blaring. Even with the cover art it was obvious that Derek Riggs didn't care much anymore, either. Maiden was hard pressed to design a stage production around that piece of insanity.<BR>The only songs I find myself attracted to are typically considered 'filler' by most fans. &quot;Only the Good Die Young&quot; has what I consider one of Dave's best guitar solos, and &quot;The Prophecy&quot; really stands out as an anomaly in Maiden's repertoire due to its blatantly classical chord progression and 'greensleeves-ish' harmony section. Now THAT's progressive. The rest of the album is progressO!
B00000G3AZ|5.0|What more can I say about this movie than that it portrays and honors Jane Austen's literary masterpiece so superbly that Jane Austen herself would truly be proud of the movie? Wonderful directing, scenary, portrayel of characters by a wondeful cast, and just overall greatness make this a movie that should not, repeat should not, be missed!
0066620996|1.0|If I were giving out stars for book titles I'd give this five - it's perfect. The content however is far less than that. The &quot;research&quot; is at best questionable and further, there is nothing new here. If you are among the many looking to move from good to great (and aren't we all) and hope to find the answers in this book you will be disappointed.  Pop management books are easy to find and even easier to sell - do your research, there are better resources out there.
B00005MP58|5.0|Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is my favorite novel that I've ever read.  It is truly a book which contains something for everyone; romance, comedy, action and satire.  <BR>  So, of course, when I was looking to buy a DVD version of the book, I was a bit skeptical about how a DVD version of it could possible stand up to the greatness of the book, but after buying this version and viewing it, I can truthfully say that my doubts have vanished and that I have found my new favorite DVD.  <BR>  The makers and actors behind this movie are geniuses, in that they have created a wonderfuly movie that contains all of the elements of the book.  All of the actors and actresses have done excellent work in portraying the character, especially Colin Firth's performance as Mr. Darcy.  <BR>  The beautifuly scenery, marvelous acting, and excellent directing, along with the extra features and special booklet, have made this DVD one that should not be missed.  Because even if you're not a Jane Austen fan, or even heard of her for that matter, you WILL love this movie and anyone, yes, even macho lovers of war flicks and haters of romance or chick flicks, will enjoy, even if not admittedely, this movie.  So if you are reading this review because you are actually considering buying this DVD, stop reading and go buy it! Have a nice day
B00005YW4H|5.0|Her sound is soulfull and sultry.  And yet, its got this great sweet red wine on a rainy night, or even favorite pair of blue jeans feel to it.  There is nothing that invigorates or relaxes me more.  I can't wait to hear what she comes out with next
0800141660|5.0|Jane Austen's Sense and Sensiblility is literary masterpiece which I, knowing this and loving the book, thought would be impossible to be matched a film version, but I was wrong.  This DVD is absolutely excellent.  THe acting is wonderful, the story and elements involved is breathtaking and the directing and overall smoothness makes this a film that should not be missed.
0440237688|5.0|After having read The Giver by Lois Lowry, I find it an excellent book. When reading this book, I found it hard to put down because of how different Jonas's society was. The community, where Jonas lived in reminded me of Utopia, an ideally perfect place where people in the mid 1800s were seeking. They were unsuccessful because they could not start over. For in the book, the community was able to start over by giving up suffering, color, and meaningful words such as love.<BR>     I also found this book interesting because Lowry takes the reader through process of Jonas's thinking, which led up to his major decision, a decision he made himself, not by the society's conforming rules and regulations. I especially loved the ending, where Jonas, the Receiver of Memories, was able to seek the life he hoped for. His life changed the community's Utopian society. <BR>     This short book brought me into an entirely new world as I was reading the novel, and left me with a whole different perspective on Utopia. The perfect place in society is not everything; there are some losses. The most important lost is the meaning of love.
B00004Z459|4.0|The first song That i ever heard by LInkin Park was &quot;one step closer&quot;,which was in early 2001.I later bought this cd,and i have to say its one of my favorites of my collection.Despite peoples hate for Linkin Park because of their pop sounds,heavy rotation on Mtv,and thier so called &quot;back street boys with guitars&quot; image,i still have to give it up to them.Lets move on to the tracks..<BR>1.Paper cut 4/5-after hearing this song i was instantly in love with it and its a great opnener for the album<BR>2.One step closer 4.5/5-this was the first single by Linkin Park and is a really great song.I love the lyrics and the guitars in this song.One of my fav's by Linkin Park.<BR>3.With you-4/5-sweet intro with some sweet vocals by shinoda and chester.And just a great song over all!<BR>4.Points of athourity-4.5/5-This is another one of my fav's and it really kicks ass!The begining is a rap and the verses are soft,and then a hard chorus,and to top it off a kick ass rap in the middle of the song.This is another highlight of the album.Also this song has a great video.<BR>5.Crawling-5/5-This was probebly Linkin Parks biggest hit.It has great lyrics,a great video (one of the reasons i  liked it so much was because of the beatiful girl!)And this is probebly everybody's fav song by linkin park.<BR>6.Guilty by association-3.5/5-This is probebly one of weaker songs off of the album.Dont get me wrong this song is great,it has a great melodic verse and the middle is heavy and a great chorus.but compared to the other songs of this album this song doesnt exactly match up to them.<BR>7.By myself 4/5-I like this track.The intro is pretty heavy for being a linkin park song and the singing by shinoda and chester is great.and the guitar riff in the middle of the song during the little interlude my shinoda is real sweet.<BR>8.In the end 6/5-Ok.I think this is the greatest song by linkin park ever.Its one of the coolest songs i have ever heard.I love the piano intro.Alot of people can relate to the lyrics in this song.Also the abstract video for this song absoltutly rules!oh yeah mr.hahn is a kick ass video director.<BR>9.A place for my head 4/5-Another song with great raps by shinoda and i love the guitar intro its unique.I wonder what kind of effect that is..but anyways lets move onto the next track.<BR>10.Forgotten 4.5/5-This is a really ggreat song!The song will keep you banging your head right from the start.And the chorus is cool just like the other songs in this album.I would have like to seen a video for the orignal version of this song.<BR>11.A cure for the itch 4/5-This song is a cool intrumental by mr.hahn.cant explain it.it has some cool synth,cool piano's,and mr.hahn goes off whihc is cool.<BR>12.Pushing me away 3/5-I can never get around to this song because of all the addictive songs off of this album.But its a good song.Chester mainly sings in this song,you dont hear much of mike shinoda.Also this song has more emotion.<br />Basicly this is a must have album with a bunch of catchy songs.If you like real metal..like metallica,slayer,iron maiden..i dont think this is for you,im serious.But if you like more listenable music with pop sounds and still has some rap and rock this is for you.The ultimate pop/rock/rap album...i dunno if thats a good thing or a bad thing..its up to you to decide.Personally i think its ok i listen to this album sometimes.Also this is not real metal and the musicians arent as talented like other musicians and this was basicly a really over produced album made for mtv an for the mainstream,the mass media.
B0000C7PSW|4.0|Want One is the follow up to the 2000 classic Poses, which was literally the most underrated album of that year. On Want One Rufus revisits the chamber styled ballads of the first album but there are some lush orchestrations like the quote of Ravel's Bolero on Oh, What a World. The more allusive/poetic lyrical writing of Poses is replaced with a straight forward pop language characteristic of Rufus' Dad Loudon. Fans will love this album. It is honest and autobiographical, a rarity in today's pop world. Others should listen and take notice of an artist who has remained true to his fan base.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|I should hate Scarface.  It's about a character who kills people to become king of the Miami drug world.  And yet Scarface is one of the most entertaining, audacious and satisfying movies of the last 20 years.  <br />Why?  For one thing, it is directed by Brian DePalma, who gives the film a kinetic energy that only he can give.  Secondly, it has a great cast including Al Pacino as the lead character, Steven Bauer in a charismatic supporting role, and Michelle Pfeiffer and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio giving fine, early career performances as the women in Pacino's life.  Finally, it has stunning cinematography by John Alonzo and a fine music score by Giorgio Moroder which perfectly captures the seductive world of Miami night life.  <br />Scarface is a fascinating look at crime life.  It is a crime film/film noir, but Alonzo's cinematography is bright and colourful, not the typical dark and elusive cinematography of traditional film noir, which makes the violence in the film (and there is plenty) more shocking.  <br />It also features unapologetic filmmaking from its director.  DePalma never compromises - he makes the characters unlikable, there is lots of violence, and he does not shy away from showing the uglier side of drug life.  He does not make Al Pacino's Tony Montana a character who we should admire, or even like, but Pacino does bring some charm and humour to the role, which helps, since the film is almost three hours long.  <br />There are also some great little joys in Scarface:<BR>-the tragic love story between Bauer and Mastrantonio's characters<BR>-Bauer trying to show Pacino how to pick girls up (and doing it badly)<BR>-Pacino trying to impress Pfeiffer in his car by wearing her hat<BR>-the stunning art direction (Tony's mansion, his bathtub, the Babylon club)<BR>-Debbie Harry's &quot;Rush Rush&quot; single which can be heard in the first Babylon sequence; one of the better 80s movie songs.<br />The DVD extras are good, including documentaries, deleted scenes (which are actually outtakes never used or edited).  Best of all is an interesting documentary about the influence Scarface has had on hip-hop performers.  It's too bad it's too short because it would have been nice to have DePalma, Pacino, Oliver Stone (the writer) and Martin Bregman (the producer) to comment on this subject as well. <br />But this DVD is worth buying.
0060930187|5.0|I just read the Bell Jar, and I was shocked at how much I could relate to the main character. Esther is 19 years old, and at that age I was feeling and experiencing so many of the same things. The time was different, the specifics were different, and our genders are different, and yet this book hit so close to home that it was uncomfortable, and yet cathartic, to read it. This book perfectly depicts the feeling of being a very young adult in our society, and looking at the world around you and seeing absolutely nothing that appeals to you. It depicts the confusion, pain, isolation, and even insanity that can be the result. I would recommend this book to anyone, but especially to young people who are struggling to find their footing in a society that can be cold, frightening, and overwhelming.
B0000AXM3N|5.0|The latest CD from A Perfect Circle is 10X better than there last album. The album is strong from beginning to the end. <BR>If you like the first album, you will love this album. It is not as heavy but it still rocks!!!It was worth the money. <br />The only thing I didn't like about this album was the problems that came along with  the copy control. I didn't have any problem with it myself but people with older cd players and computers might have some trouble.
B00000JCOV|5.0|this is one of my favorite cds. one of the greatest metal bands ever. corey taylors voice can change from screaming to singing in seconds and both sound amazing. the drums are sick and this is just one of those cds u have to listen to really loud. if u dont have this cd and ur a fan of hardcore then go out and buy it!
630460288X|5.0|This is a good movie that I keep watching. I liked the <BR>society where they ban smoking cigarettes. I can't stand it when other people are smokers. That would be interesting to have comics on people like Denis Leary's character or any of the cops not shown who pursue Simon Phoenix in a city wide manhunt. I have seen this movie a countless number of times. Especially there it is illegal to crack gum. Now that's rude and annoying. It's even illegal to chew gum in this society. One thing is that they never showed Sylvester Stallone vs. Jesse &quot;The Body&quot; Ventura just like we saw Arnold Schwarzenegger take on Jesse Ventura in the Running Man. They should have prequel and sequel books and comics.

0385491026|5.0|CAT'S EYE by Margaret Atwood<br />In CAT'S EYE, Margaret Atwood tells the story of Elaine Risley, an avant-garde painter who finds herself reflecting on her tumultuous childhood when she returns to her home town of Toronto for a retrospective art exhibit.   It has been many years since she set foot in Canada, where she grew up moving from place to place, due to her father's career as an entomologist.  The story is told in flashbacks, as the story of her current life as a painter, on her second marriage, is told in-between the story of her childhood. Two plot lines run parallel to each other, until the very end when both the past and her present collide.<br />Elaine's first years were spent travelling with her family, never having a best friend.  It is all she yearns for, to have a real girl friend.  All she had during those early years was her brother, who as he grew older drifted away from her, leaving her alone to fend for herself.  When her father finally settles down and buys a house, she begins to make her first set of real friends.  However, how does one define a friend?  Elaine becomes part of a group of girls that seem to be living under the steel hand of Cordelia, the ringleader.  Cordelia treats them all as if she was a dictator and they were her subjects, but her treatment of Elaine is totally unforgivable.  Elaine is tormented to a point where her own mental health is jeopardized, and at one point one wonders how she ever survived.  <br />But survive she did.  As Elaine tells her story, we see how she developed from a very insecure and needy young girl to a woman who understands why she made the choices she did as a child, and became a very successful painter, secure in who she was and where she had come from.  The key to her understanding is her friendship with Cordelia, the young girl who treated Elaine like dirt, yet towards whom Elaine felt a type of longing for, years after she had last seen Cordelia.  It is a psychologically themed book, as usual,layered upon different levels of plots and subplots and characters.  Margaret Atwood is the queen of this form of novel, and it is no wonder she is one of the best storytellers today.  This was my fourth Atwood novel, and I will not hesitate to read my next.  Although not as complex as THE BLIND ASSASSIN, nor as prophetic as THE HANDMAID'S TALE, CAT'S EYE stands alone as a great book that is a must-read for any fan.  I give this book 5 stars.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Chicago is DA BOMB! After seeing the movie, I swear, I couldn't wait to get the soundtrack. I begged my mom and finally we got it! Ever since, I've memorized EVERY SINGLE SONG. The songs are well done and cool, so I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS CD TO ANYONE WHO LIKES OR LOVES CHICAGO. It is now my favorite movie (and CD!)!!!!
0385504209|5.0|As a reader of at least one book every week, I found this book to be one of the best that I have read in a long time.  It was so packed with information and new ideas that I had to take rest breaks to take it all in!  Definitely worth the time to read and re-read it.
B000002IQW|5.0|This CD still remains in my top 5 of all time! Rarely does a group have such talent as these 5 guys. No one can scream like Sebastian Bach and his vocals on Quicksand Jesus, and Darkened Room send chills up my spine.  The guitar playing of Scotti Hill, and Dave Szabo are unbelievable as well, and if this doesn't make you roll down the windows and turn it up to 11, nothing will!!

B00002Z88D|5.0|How should one start to discuss this album? This is definitively the first album ever made which combines a heavy metal band (the best...) with a symphony orchestra (the best..this one I don't know for shure...) that WORKS, i.e. the balance between the two elements is so good that it is simply amazing. Thanks to Michael Kamen for the arrangements, they are stunning. The album is for me the best EVER MADE. It doesn't pay off to go into more details about individual pieces of music since even the weaker parts are so good I would not want to miss out on them. If I could rate one album more than 5 stars, it would be this one. <BR>As many other reviewers, I also would have liked to see The Unforgiven I &amp; II and some other pieces of music, but hey, maybe we'll be surprised with that in a future follow-up (I hope!!!)<BR>My personal favorite parts are Fuel-The Memory Remains-No Leaf Clover(!!)-Hero Of the Day-Bleeding Me(!!)-For Whom The Bell Tolls- -HUMAN - Wherever I May Roam-Outlaw Torn (!!!!)-One(!!)-Enter Sandman. <BR>If you didn't get this one, just buy it. Don't play it just once, please try more times. The music has so many layers, contrapoints and melodies that you'll only get the true depth in time. AND ALL THIS IN A LIVE CONCERT. I only wonder how this would sound in a studio recording...
B00009V7RF|5.0|This album is GREAT, and all you morons out there: if you actually listened to the lyrics of &quot;lets get retarded&quot; then you would understand that it isn't about your mentally disable son, so just shut up. But, I do feel like making a song calling it &quot;you are retarded&quot; bc that person with the review was simply retarded.
0385504209|3.0|I have to give Brown credit as a mystery writer--he does keep the pages turning; however, the Da Vinci Code is one of the most overrated books of the year, and certainly not one of Brown's better efforts.<br />One of the most disappointing features of this book was his repeated representation of fiction as fact. Was he deliberately misleading or was this simply the result of sloppy research?  The only reason I suspect the former was that, in his conclusion, he seemed to accept the veracity of the &quot;sacred feminine&quot; nonsense, along with all of the other attendant (and unoriginal) puerilities.
B0000AC8N4|5.0|Here is a very very essential album.One of Blue Note's most essential records.Paris,May 23,1963: Dexter Gordon,ts,Bud Powell,p,Kenny Clarke,dms and top french jazz bass player,Pierre Michelot,the only survivor of this outstanding quartet;or Dex meets the &quot;Three Bosses&quot;,as the Bud/Klook/Michelot trio was called.Initially,Dexter should have recorded with Kenny Drew a set of tunes of his own;but it was decided to hire Bud,who was living in Paris the last years of his very short life,and logically,Michelot and Clarke followed.The bunch of new tunes written by Dex were forgotten,and everybody chose to play standards.Bud,among several troubles,could hardly learn new things at this time;but he was a giant when he was asked to play his repertoire,and the proof is here.Put together one of the most magnificent disciples of both Pres and Bird,the most awesome pianist with Hines and Tatum,and the father of modern jazz drumming,son of Jo Jones,add one of the best french musicians on bass,and you'll get some sublime music.Here may be Dexter Gordon's most magnificent album;his Lesterian roots meet some Golson and even Rollins' and Coltrane's influences (&quot;Night in Tunisia&quot;);<BR>his swing is purely incredible;Kenny Clarke's drumming is simply out of this world,so simple and yet so hardly swinging;maybe the most essential jazz drumming with Jo Jones' and Sam Woodyard's.And Pierre Michelot's bass support is really a very great one.<BR>What about the tunes ? Here are essential versions of Bird's &quot;scrapple from the apple&quot;,Dizzy's &quot;Night in Tunisia&quot;,here is a sublime version of the incredible Ann Ronnell's evergreen,&quot;willow weep for me&quot;,including superb solos by Bud and Pierre,here is the old &quot;Broadway&quot;,in which Bud salutes Basie (the final notes),here are wonderful ballads,&quot;stairway to the stars&quot;,&quot;our love is here to stay&quot;,and finally here is a trio track by the &quot;Three Bosses&quot;,&quot;like someone inlove&quot;,one of Bud's favorites.<BR>Listening again to this album,it seems almost incredible to me to think that this music was recorded 40 years ago.It sounds more and more younger than most of today's jazz records.Here is not only Dexter's best effort,here is one of the most essential records of the history of jazz; a mixture of classical,Kansas City oriented music (Dexter's blowing will reminds you of Lester,Hershell Evans,Illinois Jacquet,Buddy Tate) and post-bop music (shades of Golson,Trane);Kenny Clarke,one of the monuments of jazz drumming with the Father,Jo Jones,and the disciples,Woodyard,Haynes,Blakey,Elvin J.,Butler,Lenny McBrowne,Roy Brooks,Ed Thigpen,Roach,etc,Kenny Clarke is at his most magnificent playing.Here is a gem in Blue Note's amazing catalog.Something you have to listen to !!!
B000089RVX|2.0|Oi, where to begin! First of, the extra star is due to the fact that Amy Lee has one of the best voices i've heard in a long, long time. And if she was backed by a better band this would have worked. Sadly though her voice is the ONLY thing good about the album. Take generic nu-metal (as if it wasn't bad enough) and repeat for 11 songs and you have Evanescence.<br />The guitarist (if he even deserves that title) is absolutely horrid. And to show you i know what i'm talking about he plays a Jackson SLMG with EMG active pickups in the &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; video. His playing is the worst example of tuned down, overly distorted, simple, one finger power chord riffing there is. And God what an awful tone! The only solo he plays is 5 seconds long and he uses the Kirk Hammett &quot;I can't play so let's use my wah pedal to impress people&quot; theory.<br />The bass and the drums aren't much better. On most songs they lock into the basic 4/4 pattern and don't move. The piano driven ballads though are surprisingly good. The best moment on the album comes with My Immortal. Without a doubt the best song on the album. <br />In conclusion i would like to beg Amy to find herself a better band. She can do better than a below average talent band with absolutely no song-writing abilities to speak of.
0151008116|1.0|I have not even finished this book and do not intend to.  Having read up to the point where the reader must endure descriptions of suffering animals in minute detail, I decided that there is no message that the book could possibly deliver that would make me want to continue on.  <br />I am reading The Life of Pi for a book club and normally finish the selection whether it speaks to me or not.  I waded through the beginning chapters with the author's rambling views of various religions to discover his &quot;deep&quot; philosophical point that all religions - gasp, never thought of THAT before - are rooted in the same love of God and are sometimes characterized by the same small-minded prejudices.  I skimmed through the dull descriptions of Pi's Canadian family life. But when I reached the lifeboat I gave up.  There was nothing in the early chapters that gave me hope that if I continued reading I would gain anything other than a growing nausea.  I am completely puzzled by the adulation this book has received. <br />If you want blood and guts, rent Men in Black - at least it's entertaining.  If you want a gripping tale of survival, there are countless others that are better. If you do want to try the book, borrow it from the library.  At least you will not have wasted your own money.
B000003TAR|5.0|the above lines were the first lines from nirvana's dark, angry &amp; sad final studio album In Utero. as i put the album on for the first time. i knew things were not going so good for cobain (you could just tell. he sounded so tried, hurt, angry &amp; maybe even a little confused). the album was so much different from nevermind (or for that matter Bleach or Incesticide). this nirvana was alot more raw &amp; alot more loud. the pop was all but gone here. there sound had changed. in between all the loud rawest was some very nice acoustic songs as well (dumb, all apologies, pennyroyal tea). it's really a shame about the passing of kurt cobain. this album is a very interesting listen. i have no doubt in my mind that if he could have got his act together he could have continued to make great albums like this.
0688163173|4.0|With \\"Shutter Island\\" Dennis Lehane departs radically from the blue-collar, noir fiction of \\"Mystic River,\\" and the Boston PI series that initially marked him as a superb storyteller. As always, Lehane's prose is powerful and well crafted, but \\"Shutter Island disturbed me in a way that his other novels did not. Lehane explores the dark side of man in his fiction, the suppressed brutality lurking beneath the civilized surface. I somehow always knew where I stood while reading his other novels, although he frequently traveled new terrain, I had no problem staying with him. I found myself disoriented, at times, reading \\"Shutter Island.\\" This is no dark mystery thriller from Boston's working class streets, nor is it the powerhouse masterpiece that is \\"Mystic River.\\" This is a disquieting, multilayered, psychological thriller that deals with mental illness in a way that makes the disease palpably real. Lehane takes us on a journey into the heart of psychopathology, and the feeling of total disorientation is so strong that it is most disturbing. I was left with a downright creepy feeling when I finished the book, but I believe this is exactly what the author intended.<br />U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule, take the ferry to Shutter Island, one morning in late summer, 1954, to investigate the disappearance of an inmate of the Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane. Ashecliffe, the island's only facility, has a long and dark history. It is almost a gothic presence, looming over the island. Rachel Solando, a WWII widow who murdered her three children during a major episode of depression, has been a longtime patient at Ashecliffe. She somehow vanished from her locked and well guarded cell during the night. Daniels and Aule investigate the mysterious disappearance, with very little cooperation from the hospital staff, and decide that Rachel Solando must have had assistance in escaping, since she obviously couldn't make herself invisible and walk through a locked door. Lehane's tense, minimalist narrative, combined with the plot's twists and turns, leave the impression that no matter what evidence the marshals turn up about the patient, or about the hospital itself, nothing is ever really discovered. There is a feeling of foreboding that the investigators are not in charge of the case that brought them to the hospital, but are rather being led through a series of scenarios, planned in advance for their benefit. Then a violent hurricane breaks over Shutter Island, prisoners escape, and Mrs. Solandos is discovered during the chaos. The men are free to return on the next ferry out after the storm. But Teddy Daniels is not ready to leave. What has been a mystery now turns into a psychological thriller.<br />Daniels lost his wife in an arsonist's fire two years before and still mourns her deeply. The arsonist who caused his wife's death, Andrew Laeddis, is imprisoned at Ashecliffe Hospital, and Daniels has known this for a long while. He had been waiting for the opportunity to travel to Ashecliffe and meet Laeddis face-to-face. And this investigation provided him with the ideal opportunity. He is not sure if he will kill the man he believes murdered his wife, or if he will just accuse him, but Daniels does not want to leave the island without resolving the issue that has plagued him for so long. He knows in his gut that something is seriously wrong at the hospital. He mistrusts the hospital's administrators who have behaved in a suspicious manner since he and Aule arrived. He has doubts about the veracity of all the information they have been given. Daniels also believes that illegal surgery and experiments are being conducted on the most violent patients - experiments reminiscent of those performed on the concentration camp prisoners he saw during the war. He feels the hospital administrators may view him and his partner as a dangerous threat to their operation. Then Chuck disappears and Teddy Daniels realizes that he may never leave the island alive.<br />This is a superbly constructed novel that is filled with suspense and dark turns at almost every corner. The entire narrative is told from the point of view of Teddy Daniels. A sympathetic and well fleshed-out character, Daniels is an intelligent man, who appears very much in command and in control of himself. He has suffered much, during the war and with the death of his wife and the life he hoped they would have together. His dark dreams are vividly depicted and provide more clues to the mysteries on Shutter Island than do all the codes and pieces of evidence acquired during the four day duration of the story.<br />This is a novel that haunts, long after the last page has been read. It is, at times, chilling and definitely not for the faint of heart. Dennis Lehane proves, yet again, that he is one of America's best living novelists, who long ago surpassed the title of genre writer. Highly recommended!<br />JANAs that he may never leave the island alive.<br />This is a superbly constructed novel that is filled with suspense and dark turns at almost every corner.

B000002UJQ|5.0|this is the album that really put radiohead on the map right here. this is the album they are best known for. and it's a great listen from front to back. the stuff that would follow this classic is IMO hit &amp; miss (doesn't matter thou. hit &amp; miss or not. they are one of the best bands in the world). a classic album that had great singles with great videos to back them up. the album before this was also a classic i think. it's kinda too bad they don't do stuff like this anymore. but it's cool that they want to expertment with new sounds so i can hardly complain about that. this shows a great band at the peak of their powers.
B000068FWC|2.0|To make a long story short, if you want a great sounding version of this, seek out the Mofi Gold version.  That version sounds absolutely incredible with a super-smooth high-end, punchy bass, and incredible dynamics.  This version has a very harsh high-end, muddy bass, and is compressed beyond belief.  Use the title track and compare both versions above; you will not believe how lame this remaster is.  The EITQM remaster is even worse! (Strangely, the &quot;Crisis? What Crisis?&quot; remaster was acutally very well done!)  If you like recordings whose dynamics have been chopped off at the knees or will solely be playing it through a boom box, by all means order this CD.  Audiophiles need not apply...
B00004XONN|4.0|radiohead's third best album (after ok and bends) is an expertment that works out great. this album is a really nice surprize. very good from start to finish. it's way better than amnesiac (how they got away with droping that one i'll never know). kid a is filled with great tracks. national anthem, how to disappear completely and idioteque are stand outs. but everything else is great too. i really like the title track alot (one of their best &quot;weird&quot; tracks i think). this album is very well put together (which i like). there's no doubt that these guys and their producer know what they are doing. a must have i think and 'almost' as good as the 2 that came before them.
B00004XOWM|4.0|Dude...u guys kick ass but i expected more,u can do better then that.
B00006F7S4|5.0|this is of course the sad beck album. an album of heartbreak and lost. to tell the truth i didn't think beck could do an album like this (and i'm a giant fan of his) but wow this one really surprized me (something he has done before but not like this). this may or may not be beck's best album. it's really hard to say. there are to me two beck hansen's. one is beck the entertainer. and the other is beck the songwriter. you can guess which one this is. this is beck the songwriter's best album. beck the entertainer's best album would be odelay of course. very nice album, indeed. lots of great hooks. lots of mood. very great from start to finish. here beck really does make the gentlemen cry (inside joke). i have no idea where this guy will go from here. but one things for sure i will follow and be happy with whatever he whats to do. call me a crazy fanboy if you want but i can't think of any other artist who should be followed more (in fact i never had). been down since loser and never did give up on the guy and never will.
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown is amazing!! His writing is very easy to follow and the story completely consumes you!! The reality of the story was so scary!! Makes you think twice about life in general!
B000002LRX|5.0|this was one of the first albums i ever owned. i've always been poor so i've never been able to buy everything i ever wanted. hey thank god for the internet. wink, wink. anyway this is faith no more's best album right here. and what a wild album it is. it's heavy, loud, mad and wonderful. Mike Patton of course really shines on here. i've never really liked metal but this album rocks.
0790729628|5.0|5 stars for the film only...  2 stars for the DVD presentation from Warner Home Video.  <br />For being the studio that launched the DVD revolution (the DVD format we know and love today is a product of the combined research and development between Warner Home Video and Toshiba electronics), Warner Home Video/Warner Bros. could seemingly care less about the fans and the home cinema experience.  Typical of the neglect they shower upon consumers of DVD's is \\"Blade Runner.\\"  Warner's pretty much sums up their attitude with their (sub)-standard packaging: cardboard and a wee bit of plastic... There are no booklets (as usual on early Warner's DVD releases), no image on the DVD itself (since this DVD offers full screen on one side and widescreen on the other, it's a negligible problem for this release), and nary an extra to be found.  Warner Bros. has an AMAZING back catalog of films in their archives... and they certainly don't mind releasing them in droves to unsuspecting consumers;  however, except for the rare DVD release of a great Warner's film in a well presented DVD package (\\"Citizen Kane's\\" DVD release is a good example of what they can do when they kinda sorta care) the studio seems, for the most part, to just toss 'em out there without extras (or limited extras), and very often with no commentary from the technical team or the actors. Furthermore, the awful, cheesy packaging they foist upon the average consumer (Criterion they ain't) just makes their DVD packages pale compared to other studio's home video releases (even MGM finally cleaned up their act a bit, and now release special editions of popular films and critical classics).  \\"Blade Runner\\" MORE than deserves a proper DVD release, and a re-release should include (on a seperate disc): the full script (NOT in a CD-ROM format thank you very much (for those of us that own Macs)), the full production notes, behind the scenes archival material (of which there is tons), any deleted scenes, a seperate version ofthe original release (with the awful Deckard voiceover and the \\"Shining\\" ending... film geeks, you know what I'm talking about) and anything else they could graciously put in there for the fans (like a background-bio on Phillip K. Dick and \\"Do Androids...\\").  The first disc, of course, should be a proper, 16X9 enhanced widescreen presentation with a completely remastered soundtrack in DTS, Dolby 5.1 (at least) and 2.0 Surround.  Commentaries from Scott, the cast, and the special effects technicians (including Syd Mead) should dominate this disc on separate tracks... and, though Ridley Scott's films on DVD are notorious for very small letterboxing (the image often looks like the opening slit on a box of Kleenex) they could spruce it up for 16X9 at a higher resolution, with few compression artifacts (a nasty DVD affliction common to all DVD's) and STILL offer a full screen version!  A three-disc set is not out of the question for a film of this caliber.  But, alas alack, Warner's continuously screws the pooch and feels content to release crappy DVD presentations in order to do what they do best: grab your cash before you know how worthless the product is.<br />Shape up Warners!  Live up to the video trend you started, and give as much care to your films as the fans do when watching them!
B00000DLVA|4.0|i've heard many mixed reviews on this one over the years. but to me it's a really good one that gets better with each listen. yep this one has a more electronica feel to it. but i think the expertment worked more often than not. i like it and i'm glad they tried something new. i like to hear people try new things out and not stick to the same thing over and over again. i think that's the best way to play music. the cardigans alreadly did a great mellow pop record (life) so why would they just keep doing that over and over. expertments are hit &amp; miss most of the time. but i think this hits more often than it miss's.
1401200613|5.0|Jim Lee.<br />He's the reason I am giving this book five stars.<br />Over the past year this story has kept comic books readers fascinated. It has almost held the #1 spot for the 11 months that it has been on sale. And this is due to Jim Lee's spectacular art work. In this book Lee pays  a true homage, to my favorite comic book character.  He is the reason I bought four copies of the book at a time. And he is the reason I bought this trade.<br />The story on the other hand is something else. Jeph Loeb's sense of storytelling is more of a &quot;tell&quot; than a &quot;show&quot;.  Most of the story is driven forward by the narration in Batman's head. The premise of Hush is supposed to be someone manipulating Batman's foes to get at him.  But the truth of the matter is, with the exception of Killer Croc' (who is supposed to be too stupid to stage a kidnapping) it really isn't shown.<br />And of course there is Batman's \\"romance\\" with Catwoman.<br />Words can not express how put off with this part of the story. It's purely contrived and annoying.  Catwoman comes on to Batman in one of the most sexually agressive moves I have seen in a mainstream comic book. And by the next issue he is in love?<br />Please<br />In other Batman books (including Dark Victory and The Long Halloween-also written by Loeb)  he would have spurned her advances. To tell you the truth it is the portrayal of Catwoman that has ruined the book for me. The portrayal of Catwoman has to be the most annoying portrayal I have ever seen of the character. For the entire arc Catwoman behaviour alternates from bimbo to vixen. When she's a bimbo she comes across as comic relief in a tv sitcom. When she's a vixen, she comes across  like the Baroness in the Sound of Music.  I don't know what Jeph Loeb was doing as he's portrayed her excellently twice before. Her dialogue just grates on my nerves.<br />Still I must praise Loeb for giving such a great profile to Huntress. Another vigilante who gets along with Batman, like oil gets along with water. He portrayed her excellently , the fighter she is and how she will still do the right thing, no matter how badly she is treated by others.<br />Still I would recommend this book to Batman fans and collectors. Jim Lee's art work is worth every penny.Batman, like oil gets along with water.

B000002TQV|5.0|man oh man. what a great album this one is. when i first hear creep i didn't think much of it. but when they dropped this album i knew they had made good. the singles off here were getting heavy airplay on mtv here in the states and all the singles were great and of course the videos were as well. i remember seeing the my iron lung video on mtv's 120 minutes and loving that one. it was first put out on a ep of the same name. but i couldn't find the ep. so i was like &quot;huh&quot;. cause i really wanted to get it. a couple of months later. i remember seeing the video for high and dry and loving the song and the video. i went out and got the album. and the whole album was nice. i was really surprized i must say. a great album that's almost as great as ok computer. again great singles and great videos on here. it's no wonder radiohead has became the giant band they are today. they really know what they are doing.
B00005614M|5.0|In his professional life, Miles Davis was an agent of change and a permanent self critic. Also, he would always surround himself of the best possible musicians (he said, &quot;I'm hiring a [musician] to play, not for what color he is&quot;) to help in materializing his musical vision. Leaving behind the enviable position of musical director of Charlie Parker's group, Miles assembled a nonet (several of its members coming from the ranks of Claude Thornhill's Orchestra), Gerry Mulligan and John Lewis among them, and with their help gave birth to the new sound in jazz at the time: the Cool, an attempt to sound like a big band with a significantly smaller ensemble (a nonet, in this case), by means of a collective writing approach.<br />The album, recorded throughout three sessions between January of 1949 and March of 1950, marked the beginning of a series of outstanding works of Miles along with musical mentor and genius arranger Gil Evans. Its slower and softer sound resonated throughout the jazz world, taking jazz to a new level and influencing musicians all over the place, mostly in California it would help give shape to a mellow sound that would later be called West Coast Jazz (Dave Brubeck, Gerry Mulligan, Chet Baker, etc.)<br />It is hard to pick favorite tracks in such a brilliant production. Four different arrangers and a rich assortment of composers, from Davis and Evans, to Mulligan, Lewis, Bud Powell and several others, along with the assorted lineup of musicians (only Davis in trumpet and lead, Mulligan in baritone, Lee Konitz in alto, and John Barber in Tuba were part of all three recording sessions) allow the careful listener to see tunes from a number of different points of view. For example, how does a pianoless Gerry Muligan tune sounds like (&quot;Rocker&quot;), how does a song arranged by John Lewis sound like when it's also a composition of his (&quot;Rouge&quot;) as opposed to when it's someone else's (&quot;Move&quot;) or how does Max Roach sound on drums with a bunch of other musicians vs. how does Kenny Clarke sound with the same (well, almost) bunch of guys.<br />There are so many possibilities to the album that the best favor you can do to yourself is to get it and incorporate it into your musical collection and language from now on. If you are a bit more serious about it, then get a copy of the COMPLETE Birth of the Cool. It's a bit more expensive, but it carries live versions of a number of the tracks, something of a rarity, considering the nonet did a very small number of live dates.on drums with a bunch of other musicians vs. how does Kenny Clarke sound with the same (well, almost) bunch of guys. <br />There are so many possibilities to the album that the best favor you can do to yourself is to get it and incorporate it into your musical collection and language from now on.

B000000WCA|5.0|this album right here really did shake up the music scene. i'm not saying that's a good thing. it's just a fact. the album is very slick and well put together. it's fun and has great hooks everywhere. it's really a great album and some of you folks really need to lighten up :) however make no mistake. the damage this album did on the music scene is really the only bad thing i can say about it. after this album will get a bunch of really lame teen pop superstars britney, nsync, backstreet boys, and all the other crap. but the spice girls did it right. there's just enough tongue &amp; cheek on here to make it work. this is not serious music but it was never hyped as such. in 97 some guy cloned a sleep. lol. in the music world some guy cloned the spice girls. too bad the clones weren't as entertaining as the original. a must hear album i think. it's fairly insane trust me :) just let yourself go and fall in love with the madness.
B000002IWH|5.0|Watching &quot;The Crow&quot; and listening to its soundtrack will live in my mind an experience that marked my late college times. Its dark appeal, the fascinating theme of love beyond death and Brandon Lee's enticing performance prior to his death while shooting the picture could not have been better framed musically. The soundtrack provided a perfect background against which the scenes that evolved on the screen were simply perfect, as if choreographed.<br />But three songs did the most for the movie and transcended it: Jane Siberry's fascinating &quot;It Can't Rain All The Time&quot; along with the final credits, Nine Inch Nail's &quot;Dead Souls&quot; and The Cure's &quot;Burn&quot;. Years later, I can still see Lee on my mind, putting on make up, crashing mirrors, and trashing everything around him and as his transformation was under way with The Cure in the background, sounding at their best: one vibrant moment in movie history!
B000003TBP|5.0|beck's follow up album to mellow gold was another classic. produced mostly by the dust brothers. except for minus done by the man himself. a very fun and fresh album from start to finish. beck had a bunch of hits off here with great videos to back them up (where it's at, devil's haircut, new pollution &amp; jack ass). it was the happiest time i ever had as a music fan. my man was blowing up and living large :) not much to say about this album that others haven't i guess. the only problem i have with this album is it didn't win album of the year at the grammy awards but hey you can't win them all :(
B000008LNS|4.0|&quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot; is a lost treasure in Toto's large body of work. Released in Europe in 1992 and in the U.S. one year later, this album was only in print for a relatively short period of time. This is rather unfortunate because &quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot; is quite a strong effort and shows an edgier side to the band that's not always present in their other works.<br />After a short-lived disastrous stint with South African singer Jean-Michel Byron as their front man, Toto temporarily disposed of having a lead vocalist and carried on as a solid four-piece group consisting of drummer Jeff Porcaro, his brother Mike on bass, keyboardist David Paich and guitarist Steve Lukather who handles all the lead vocals on this album. The absence of a front man brings out more of Toto's solid musicianship and extended instrumental passages (only two of the album's 12 tracks are under five minutes with the rest being between 5 and 7 minutes long). Lukather's guitar work is at its best here and he proves to be no slouch as a vocalist singing both the ballads and the rockers.<br />Standout tracks includes the metal-rocker &quot;Gypsy Train&quot;, &quot;Never Enough&quot;, &quot;Two Hearts&quot;, &quot;Wings Of Time&quot;, &quot;The Other Side&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Jake To The Bone&quot; which combines elements of jazz, improvisation and odd-progressive rock time signatures. This is a showcase for drummer Jeff Porcaro's precision-based playing and David Paich's dexterous keyboard work.<br />Although it is out-of-print, &quot;Kingdom of Desire&quot; is worth searching for especially if you're a Toto fan. This album has personally grown on me since I first heard it 10 years ago. I used to think that this was the band's worst album. Not so anymore. There really isn't anything on this album that sounds like &quot;Rosanna&quot;, &quot;Hold The Line&quot; or &quot;Africa&quot; however, the tight musicianship and solid group playing is extraordinary.<br />Sadly, &quot;Kingdom Of Desire&quot; wound up being Jeff Porcaro's final album with Toto. In the summer of 1992, Jeff died of a chemically-induced heart attack. He is still missed by many but his drumming as well as his band live on. This final album includes what is arguably his best drumming - another reason to seek out this album.m Of Desire&quot; wound up being Jeff Porcaro's final album with Toto.

B000001FI7|5.0|i loved the single Sour Times (Nobody Loves Me) alot. so much so that i broke down and got this album. and what i hear would really something new and fresh. i played it over and over and over and over until i got sick of it. there really was nothing like this getting alot of mtv airplay back then. the beats are some really dark hip hop beats over beth gibbons soulfull singing. it was such a fresh listen went i first hear it. there was nothing like this getting major airplay (at least in the states). a classic without question and the follow up was just as good IMO. after those 2 albums it's no wonder why portishead have not tried to follow them up. it's just so hard to follow up on stuff like this.
B000008LOV|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I own , and if you can find it I suggest you buy it right away! With a line up like Roy Orbison , Bob Dylan , George Harrison , Tom Petty , and Jeff Lyne , how could you go wrong. Many true gems in this disc , all the songs are great in there own right , my personal favorite would have to be &quot;Handle With Care&quot; very good guitars , Tom Petty at lead vocals , and Roy Orbison at some times. I really enjoyed Roy Orbison's performances on this disc , as his voice stands out from the rest , especially on &quot;Not Alone Anymore&quot;. If you can find this CD buy it right away you will not regret it.
0790729725|3.0|As an Italian-American, let me tell you why folks like Scorsese and Coppola make mob movies. It's because those of you who are not eat this garbage up like a big dish of baked ziti! It makes them rich, so why not! Sure it happened, but the mob life represents a razor thin sliver of the whole Italian experience in America. In my opinion Goodfellas is somewhat overated.  I found this film somewhat boring and depressing at the same time, like \\"Boogie Nights or Casino.\\"  I didnt feel there was enough tension because you dont care who got whacked next. Who do you root for? Ray Liotta's character \\"Henry Hill\\" is as close to being the one protagonist in the movie but he has too many bad traits -infedelity, drug abuse, murder ect. that you are not endeared to him. And his wife becomes transformed into the very type of mob wife she originally despised.  Pesci's charachter Tommy is compleatly despicible and deserved what he had comming to him. I did think the scene where he goes on about \\"do you find me amusing?!!\\" pretty funny though. I didnt think the film very entertaining untill Liotta's charachter was franticly trying to evade the narc helicopter that was trailing him. If you like mob movies and are looking for escape from a mundane life, you would probably like this one, so eat up-Mangia!
B00008NG5V|5.0|Jack Johnson's follow up to &quot;Brushfire Fairytales&quot; is just as good as its counterpart. A Bit more mellow , but thats not a bad thing. Highlight songs on this album include &quot;Taylor&quot; , my personal favorite , &quot;Symbol In My Driveway&quot; , and &quot;Traffic In The Sky&quot;. There is not one bad song on the album , and its worth every penny. I do suggest you buy brushfire fairytales along with this album. Jack Johnson never fails to impress
B00005JLSE|1.0|After being treated to last year's aural and visual treat, \\"Moulin Rouge\\", I must say that \\"Chicago\\" is a huge letdown.  The only ray of light in this dismal production is Catherine Zeta-Jones in the role of Velma Kelly.  She can sing, she can dance and she looks fabulous!     Please beware of the reviews claiming that this is the greatest musical of all time.  That's just flat-out ridiculous.  As far as modern musicals go, both \\"Hedwig and the Angry Inch\\" and \\"Moulin Rouge\\" run circles around \\"Chicago\\" for sheer energy and entertainment.    How this film won Best Picture is beyond me.
0140277447|4.0|World War II has produced one of the most savagery and disastrous events in human history.  Of those, the Nanking Massacre showed the most ruthlessness of humankind, in which uncountable number of torture, incineration, mutilation, and rape were committed by the Japanese.  However, despite of its scale and degree of cruelty, the Japanese invasion of Nanking is concealed and unknown by most of people in the world.  Hence, the author of \\"The Rape of Nanking\\", Iris Chang unveils the event with well-detailed information and individual stories as a massage to people in the world, making it unforgettable to those who receive the massage.  She succeeds to expose the fact of the Japanese inhumanity seen by civilians in Nanking.
B00005RFQ5|2.0|I love Prince, no matter what his name has been, but this CD was the last straw for me--i'll now always listen to one of his CD's before buying it.  The CD has a boring confused preaching theme with a Kenny G vibe...and believe me, where i come from, Kenny G ain't a good influence.  So, in the words of Jesse Johnson (and a prince bootleg), \\"Do yoself a favor, walk on by...\\" and instead buy the excellent Prince DVD, Live at the Alidden Theatre-Las Vegas...which is pretty good even though it is contemporary Prince.

B00003CXB4|5.0|Until recently, when displaced by another Disney effort, this was the most successful animated film of all time, and with good reason. This was the first Disney animated film that came from an original script, rather than a book or short story. It still relies on what has been called the \\"Disney formula,\\" in that there are certain plot features in this film that echo back to prior Disney efforts (Mufasa's death bring to mind the tragedy of Bambi's mother, and Simba's odyssey into irresponsibility harkens back to Pinnochio). Does that diminish this film? Absolutely not. <br />What makes \\"The Lion King\\" timeless are its universal elements, played out so perfectly. The love of family (the lion pride), the sense of belonging to a community, to a greater whole (the \\"circle of life\\"), are things that people worldwide can relate to, which is part of the reason it was a huge success across the globe. The \\"circle of life,\\" the interconnectedness of all things, has even more resonance these days as our world shrinks. The lessons of responsibility, of loyalty, of friendship and the strength of family make this a cut above other kiddie fare; there's no patronizing or moralizing in its messages. It's nearly ideal family viewing, except for one thing: This may be the most intense film Disney has ever created. The death of Mufasa, the menacing hyenas, the confrontation with Scar; there's a lot here that may terrify or upset smaller children. So far, my 3 1/2-year-old has handled it pretty well; we've watched it four times since our preview copy arrived. But if your children have not seen it, I recommend that a parent be present when it is viewed. <br />One of the biggest criticisms of Disney is the company's tendency to overmarket and overproduce its videos. When one sees \\"Special Edition\\" on a Disney film, one may wonder if it's just another marketing ploy. Not this time. A great film like \\"The Lion King\\" deserves a first-rate DVD treatment, and it gets one. You get two versionsof the film: the original theatrical release, and the new version with an extra song, \\"Morning Report,\\" which, once you see it, will become the standard. The song (though short) is a blast, with some hilarious comedy at the expense of poor Zazu, and a great father-son moment between Simba and Mufasa. The original print has been cleaned up and the animation has been given a gorgeous new digital treatment, which when coupled with the remastered sound makes this a glorious experience. In addition to the film, there are games for the kids (Timon's \\"grab a grub\\" is a load of fun), a new \\"Circle of Life\\" music video (redundant, but it features many Disney channel favorites, including Hilary Duff and Raven), a sing-along segment (how many times will you hear \\"I Just Can't Wait to Be King\\" belted out by the little ones in your life?!?), some funny deleted scenes (bug football, anyone?), three good segments that detail the inspirations for the story, music, and characters, and much more. (Parents, be warned: This DVD may prove to be an addiction to the little ones in your life!) In my opinion, this is tied with \\"Snow White\\" and \\"Pinnochio\\" as the greatest Disney film, and is highly, highly recommended.
B00002E233|5.0|This film is increadible, mainly because it has no respect for it's cast. Anyone can die in this film. Someone who's the main character one minute is shark food the next. Although Renny Harlin took the 'special effects' option instead of building up real suspense, it works. There are some real shock moments in this film.<br />Basically it's Genetic Modification gone bazerk, super intelligent sharks, modified for the purpose of curing a disease, turn against their creators in a frenzy of snapping jaws and red-water scenes. I know, it's not the most in-depth plot review but that's it really, which doesn't matter because the great content makes up for the barely existant story. <br />The cast is great. Saffron Burrows shows that she is more than just cleavage as the meddling scientist who went too far, while Thomas Jane succeeds as the action hero (Even though he falls down about 50 times) and LL Cool J is surprisingly good as the comic relief/chef. Although he's playing the token 'cowardly character' Michael Rapaport gives a good performance, Stellan Skarsgard and Samuel L Jackson are both very talented actors who are good in any film and Jacqueline McKenzie gives more than just a creadible performance, watch the deleted scenes to see her at her best.<br />I would reccommend this film to anyone who likes a high tension thriller with plenty or guts'n'gore, but it belongs in anyone's DVD collection. It's in mine ;).<br />Sweek!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Keep in mind, that I listen to a lot of very heavy bands with the quick, destructive guitar riffs and pulse pounding drums. Seeing this, why would someone like me say that &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; is the best CD of 2003? The music is, literally, heart stopping it is written so well. We all remember the prior effort &quot;Mer De Noms&quot;, right? Much more alternative sounding, more written with a commercial flare, and that one catchy tune. Well, this one is better on so many levels.<br />  First, the music sounds like there was a lot of effort to grab a very artistic and technical sound. The atmospheric effects that were used in the background on this CD gave it such an ethereal feel that one couldn't help but become engrossed with each song from beginning to end. The one surprise track, that kind of snuck up on me, was &quot;The Package&quot;. When you first hear it, it just sounds like this light-hearted tune that doesn't have much punch to it. Then, about four minutes into the track you get kicked in the face by these heavy guitars that just blast in out of nowhere. It left me shocked, to tell the truth.<br />  Second, the artists have got to be some of the best in the world at the present time. Although Troy Van Leeuwen wasn't around for the whole recording, give him and his back-ups major credit for smoking this piece of creativity out along side band mate Billy Howerdel, whom I think is one of the most creative musicians on the planet for making this CD the way it is. I know, no Paz but give Jeordie his due because he was just a miracle on this effort. The bass lines were heard much clearer this time around, which means better sound balance (hmm...). Josh Freese, what can I say but he has immense talent and great flare to be able to do such magnificent work. Finally, what can I say about Maynard that hasn't already been said. Need I say more?<br />  Better music and better musicians to put it out there for us, what other reasons do I need to stress? An awesome tracklist...YES!!! Although, this may end up the most underrated album this year it does boast one of the best lineups ever. The whole list stands out, with a few standing higher than others. Like &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot;, &quot;The Noose&quot;, &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot;, &quot;The Outsider&quot;, and &quot;Pet&quot;. I list them in this order because they show the slow and light to heavier aspect of the CD. This album covers all bases and is well worth the money one will spend to hear it, regardless of what naysayers will try to say about it.

B0000C7PSW|5.0|I have been waiting for the new Rufus CD for quite a long time. And all the fears about its quality were erased at once as soon as the first hummings from &quot;Oh what a world&quot; kicked in. Everything in Want one is exquisitely covered with symphony and that Rufus trademark, that magical resemblance to a music forgotten in the past and gladly rediscovered. The hightlights are the aforementioned opening track, &quot;Beautiful child&quot;, &quot;Dinner at eight&quot;, &quot;Vicious world&quot;, and of course &quot;Go or go ahead&quot;. Although, if you want to get the complete experience, you shouldn't slice the album down to pieces, take it as a slow caress of wind filling up your lungs and involving you with beauty. I think we can all survive with Want one until part two comes out. Hopefully very soon.
055357342X|5.0|Martin did it again! In this third installment of what has turned out to be the greatest fantasy work of our times, he continues the dynamic and captivating tale of the wars in the Seven Kingdoms, and in doing so creates yet another masterpiece to the pleasant surprise to his audience. <br />I will be honest: it was hard to believe in the beginning that such a voluminous work as The Song of Ice and Fire can keep fascinating its readers at all times: it was only natural that it will have its peaks and downfalls. Martin, however, has exceeded all expectations in creating his saga: from the tiniest details and the most intricate twists to the greatest plot sets, he keeps creating this wonderfully believable world with the precise calculation of a genius. The depth and scope of his imagination and literary mind seem unfathomable. But then, maybe this is the reason why each installment takes so long to produce-to ensure that each detail is well placed and all actions are perfectly timed. <br />In this third part of the beloved saga, the number of contenders for power has actually dwindled, but the war and bloodshed go on as alliances are made and broken. In the mix of loyalty and betrayal, love and hatred, cruelty and mercy, too many good characters die-in this respect A Storm of Swords surpasses the first and second parts. Martin kills off good and bad guys with an equally steady hand as serves the purpose of his grand plot, and thus creates more complications and seemingly no-way-out situations, just to offer the most unexpected solution a couple of chapters or a few hundred pages later. More than once have I put the book down in dismay, not quite used to having some of my favorite characters killed in impossibly graphic scenes or, in other cases, with as much as line to describe their demise, and then seeing how the author continues his narrative as if nothing has happened and throws you back in the whirlpool of action. Winter is coming, and you can almost feel the chill coming from the pages. Strange and inexplicable things happen, unexpected and sudden twists of plot make you gape with surprise, and the intense narrative makes you hold your breath as suspense builds up. Magic has now returned to the Seven Kingdoms-magic believed to be long dead-and the prospect of it is more dire than positive. It's not necessarily a conventional type of magic with wizards and spells, but more of a mystical magic out of legends, with dragons and black sorcery, living dead, and clashes between powerful gods (a little spoiler: as some of you may have already guessed, the power of old gods does gradually return). The political element is stronger than ever, and the moral dilemmas and questionable actions of some of the characters further complicate the plot. The inter-personal relations and feelings of the characters are just as important as in the previous parts, which brings about a marvelously realistic reading, despite its fantasy setting. Sex scenes, on the other hand, are even more abundant and graphic than before.  In addition, the book offers some great action and battle scenes, which, if filmed, will surely challenge those in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. <br />This is indeed an awesome book, and if you haven't yet read it, then most likely you haven't started the series at all: otherwise, you would be desperately hooked. My advice is hurry up to the nearest bookstore and pick all three published books of the saga right now. For those like me who are now anxiously awaiting the next installment-it will be a lo-o-ong wait until June 2004 to finally get A Feast for Crows. Rarely have I read a series so addictive and so utterly irresistible, and at the same time so unpredictable and inexorably real. Martin is the literary genius of modern fantasy; of this I have no doubt.
B000099T2L|3.0|I applaud Beyonce for her work but this cd seems rushed and a lot of songs seem out of place
B0000029GA|5.0|I had originally rated this cd a biased 3 stars for 2 reasons.  To get people's attention, and out of spite because I was tired of hearing everyone talk about it and comparing all of his work to Illmatic.  Illmatic is indeed a classic debut by Nas, no one can deny that.  With the quick story-telling delivery in \\"One Love\\" and \\"Memory Lane\\" his gifted lyricism shows.  At first when I heard \\"One Love\\", I just loved it for the beat and the quick flow.  But when I actually paid very close attention to the lyrics, I realized it was a letter to his friends in jail (cormega) and it made the song even that more enjoyable. <br />And although it is only 9 songs, (the intro also had a nice beat) it still shines through.  Nas comes with fire on my favorite track \\"Represent\\", which is my favorite beat on the album and it gets torn to pieces.  \\"Life's a Bitch\\" and \\"World is Yours\\" were decent enough tracks, but not my favorites on the album.  The beats were a little on the slow and soft side.  The album closes with the very hot track \\"It ain't hard to tell\\", another song where Nas just kills it.  There was no denying his amazing story-telling ability on this album.  But he has obviously moved out of this phase and everyone needs to adjust to that.  My unbiased 2 cents.
B00005JM1F|5.0|Excellent movie! I put it on the same level as Office Space. I went searching on the net for sound files and couldn't find any, so I made a site: interactivetrainingcd.com/oldschool<br />I have to go, I have a big day planned. Going to Home Depot to pick out some flooring and then who knows, maybe Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, I don't know if they'll be time.<br />t
B00005B1EX|5.0|Rob Halford surprised me with his &quot;Resurrection&quot; comeback. But even more surprising is this live album from his solo band. Even though some of its &quot;liveness&quot; can be put in question like Unleashed in the East, it contains some of his best singing EVER!<br />The album runs the gamut from Stained Class era Priest, to Fight and of course his recent material. The songs from early Priest are old favorites of mine Priest haven't even played for years.<br />The playing is tight and smooth, but the highlight is of course Halford himself. He sings with a renewed intensity not seen on the originals themselves even. This album is probably the best album for someone wanting to delve into Halford AND Priest in general - Highly recommened.
B00007KWHN|5.0|I've heard the The Yes Album's major works presented on other CD collections -- like their earlier non-Rhino box set, but Rhino's careful remastering has taken the songs to a new level of clarity. Everything -- voices, guitars, drums, keyboards, and especially Squire's bass -- sounds more detailed and at the same time more meaty, rich, and beautiful. More subtle harmonics unmasked for all to enjoy -- the sounds of fingers on strings, the Sting-like breathiness of Anderson's voice. The band's musicianship is revealed as better than previously heard -- tighter, more harmonious. Well, except that Howe's guitar solo at the end of Starship Trooper is still completely lacking in elegance and vaguely out-of-sync with the background drone of the band. Oh well, everyone has a bad day. <br />In a word, the new Rhino remaster of The Yes Album is glorious.  Probably this is the most that can be wrung out of the old master tapes. In a year they will probably try to sell you another copy of The Yes Album in SACD or DVD-Audio format, but I doubt it will improve on this. If you love The Yes Album, do not hesitate to buy the Rhino edition, which makes the old fresh as new.
B00006RU5B|5.0|I suspect that people who are disappointed with Audioslave's debut album are those who were looking for a pastiche of Soundgarden/RATM's 1990s work. This album is not that, it's new rock, made by a band of awesome musicians who are actually working *as* a band, rather than as the wreckage of two bands.<br />'Grunge' always seemed like a marketing label for a bunch of Northwestern rock bands that otherwise didn't have a lot in common: vocals that had some loud-to-quiet dynamics, and guitars? Yes, that would be the technical definition of 'rock'. ;) Soundgarden in many ways always seemed to me like the best 70s rock band of the 90s (I mean 70s rock in the vein of Rainbow).<br />Rage Against The Machine was undeniably a rocking and innovative band, and their beats and tunes and hiphop inflections defined a genre (unfortunately, one that has since fallen to the much less worthy hands of the numetal mavens). For me, De La Rocha's voice always kind of spoiled it, because it was so stylised, and his lyrics were in the 'dumb politics' and repetitive field for mine. Yes, politics is crucial, but yelling mindless slogans from the left doesn't really counter mindless slogans from the right: some actual discussion, thought and engagement are required. (I realise I probably just lost all the RATM faithful with that para - sorry guys, calling 'em as I see 'em.)<br />The legacies of grunge and hiphop/metal have both fallen into patheticness: the 'whine-rock' of Creed, Nickelback, et al (pity me, I'm so dysfunctional) and the numetal morons ( F****** pity me, I'm so f****** dysfunctional and I'll f*** you up). <br />Audioslave redeems both legacies, in a way, in that the lyrics deal with relationships, and particularly spirituality and meaning, in much more sophisticated and nuanced ways. And the music just plain rocks: Morello is an amazing guitarist, who can distinguish every loud song from every other song perfectly, and the rhythm section is rock-solid and funky.<br />Bottom line, for an aging rock-metal guy (like Chris Cornell, I'm pushing 40), is that this album is smart, floor shaking rock, drawing on the best of the last 4 decades and avoiding the worst. It's loud music that is more like to make you smile fiercely and bang your head than to cry, whine and slit your wrists. Can't make a better recommendation than that!
B000001IPL|4.0|Offspring is one of those bands that took three albums to make anything decent, had one more okay effort, than came out with a lot of crap.  As other reviewers and anyone who listens to thier music knows, they have tried to go more commercial and radio freindly in thier later albums and for the most part they stink!<br />This album however is spectacular and it really can be attributed to two things.  First the songs are filled with energy and gusto.  They are all catchy and the guitar work drives the music.  They are very singable and fun and a good number of them saw serious radio play in the mid 90's.  The second winning characteristic of the album is that it is consistent.  Almost every song is great and you don't really need to skip any of them.  Their later albums had a couple of good songs and a couple of stinkers and this led to mediocre albums.  <br />Bottom Line:  A great album that fans of current Offspring won't even recognize.  If you missed this the first time around then go out and rediscover a classic.
B000002JPA|5.0|Dream Theater's second album stands the test of time as a great record and the perfect introduction to DT. Petrucci's pyrotechnics, Kevin Moore's moody soundscapes, and James LaBrie's vocal workouts are all present and accounted for. The first track, &quot;Pull Me Under&quot; is a rightful classic, and sounds like a missing link between Slayer and Rush. The lyrics are intelligent, and the music is unforgettable. &quot;Another Day&quot; is an 80's style power ballad that would be average if not for the extremely cool touches of soprano sax. &quot;Take The Time&quot; is simply badass, one of the FUNKIEST songs DT has ever recorded and has some great lyrics. Now, on to &quot;Metropolis, Pt. 1&quot;. Pure genius. This ten minute masterpiece has heartfelt vocals, an astonishing solo section, and all the quirks later found in Scenes From A Memory. &quot;Under A Glass Moon&quot; is a cool metal song with a chorus that'll stick in your head for days. The brief piano ballad, &quot;Wait For Sleep&quot;, is simply beautiful. However, the absolute MONSTER of the disc is the eleven minute juggernaut &quot;Learning To Live&quot;. Alternating 7/4, 4/4, 6/4, and other meters seamlessly, and constantly reusing themes form &quot;Wiat For Sleep&quot;, &quot;LTL&quot; is breathtaking. Kevin Moore's performance is nothing short of astounding, and bassist John Myung contributes some killer bass lines and thoughtful lyrics about the AIDS crsis. Other highlights of the tune are Moore's first solo and Petrucci's supremely cool &quot;Spanish guitar&quot; section. The live version on Live Scenes From New York is even cooler, adding a bitchin' REGGAE section! There only 3 flaws with the disc. First, Myung doesn't give the stellar performance he showcases on the band's later efforts. Second, Mike Portnoy's drums are mixed WAY too loud. And third, the track &quot;Surrounded&quot; is boring and stupid. However, this album is still heartily recommended, and I gladly give it 5 stars.
B0000B3FCX|5.0|I know that when it comes to rock albums these days, people will whine about it sounding the same and some will complain that the band sold-out because they change their style.  My motto is if it works then go for it.  Nickelback doesn't need to change their style, what they're doing is just fine.  If you liked Silver Side Up, you should love this.  I think it's way better than that album.  It also has a wide range of topics on it.  They talk about religion, bar-fights, anger issues, trying to move on in life, etc. It's definately my favorite rock album of this year.
B00004RFFS|5.0|This is absolutely my favorite movie of all time- the pictures it paints are mind-blowingly beautiful. The only movie I truly love Tom Cruise in, the first movie that got me to really notice Brad Pitt, and the first time I fell in love with Kirsten Dunst. Not to mention Antonio Bandaras... *melt* For anyone who loves the book and is hesitant to get the movie- If it makes you feel any better, Anne Rice wrote the screenplay, and therefore the dialogue and narrations are as fluid and beautiful as they are in the novel. Of course a few things are cut short- but there is a time-constraint when making movies... I would definitely consider it a horror movie, but the psychology of the vampires and their lifestyle is much more frightening than someone jumping out of the dark to scare you suddenly. <br />If you are anything like me, with a love of vampires, Anne Rice, and the Chronicles, you will love this movie undoubtedly.
B00008MLSH|4.0|I have encountered this exciting singer twice in the opera house, both at Covent Garden, both in Mozart. Her Servilia, I felt, was miscast; the voice was too large, the presence too strong for this young character. Her Donna Anna was a different prospect altogether. A surprise, for starters - she was a replacement for Alexandra von der Weth - but a very welcome one. Vocally, she stole the show, with &quot;Non mi Dir&quot; the peak of this achievement, with impeccable control and very, very subtle phrasing. The house loved her.<br />So now she makes her debut recital disc. She is marketed well by DG - a beautiful woman, there is no shortage of glamour shots on the sleeve. Further, this is a disc from an already experienced artist with an element of maturity that makes her much more interesting than others making their first foray into the recording studio.<br />The voice sounds healthy, bright, not exactly even, but has a rich palette of colour from a smoky lower register to a bright top that never sounds shrill. There is a resiny edge and darkness that draws the listener in. She isn't afraid to take risks, and will employ an acrobatic pianissimo here and a breathy low note there to give her singing dramatic point. She lacks a real trill and, whilst generally accurate, some of the coloratura is smudgy (especially in the Somnambula excerpt) but this is singing that goes a long way beyond a show of technical prowess. She is a serious artist who thinks before she vocalises.<br />The choice of repertoire is interesting. Nothing Russian, some well-trod Bel Canto and French repertoire and some off-the-beaten-track Berlioz and Mozart,with Musetta thrown in. Her Lucia is most compelling and I loved her Manon, and her Anna did not disappoint. I can't quite see her as a Bel Canto singer, though - to me she sounds like a singer headed to Gilda, Violetta (already in her repertoire), Amelia Grimaldi and Desdemona with a long view to Trovatore and Don Carlos. French repertoire does suit her (if she could work on the pronunciation) and she is a fine singer of Mozart. Her sound is dark and brooding enough for Puccini - what a Liu she would be! - but I suspect Butterfly and Tosca are beyond her for the foreseeable future.<br />Accompaniments are perfectly fine (a bit swift in some of the coloratura numbers)m the chorus sounds intermittently coarse, but all in all this is an exciting debut and shows Netrebko off to her advantage. She is clearly going places, and I very much look forward to hearing more.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|There are nearly 80 minutes of music on this CD so it's really a double album &amp; a great deal to Mac fans at single album price (sometimes selling as low as 8 bucks like-new). All the songs are good to excellent, nothing weak here. However, there is a difference between good songs, excellent songs &amp; masterpiece songs. Fortunately, two of the greatest songs ever written by anyone, outright timeless pop-rock masterpieces for the ages,  are also on here: &quot;RED ROVER&quot; &amp; &quot;SAY GOODBYE,&quot; both penned by the amazing Lindsey Buckingham. If only those 2 songs had been on here &amp; the rest was interesting filler, this album would still rate 4 stars; with all the other good to excellent material &amp; no weak tracks to speak of, it goes up to an easy 5.
B000002H33|5.0|This is THE BEST metal album you'll ever hear. This is THE must have Metallica or any metal band album. If you appreciate bottom heavy rythms, lightning fast solos and screaming lyrics this is the album of your dreams... Theres nothing better than this...

0676974554|5.0|&quot;Atonement&quot; isn't the &quot;type&quot; of book I usually enjoy.  I'm much more prone to choose a very interior, almost claustrophobic book that takes me deep into the heart and soul of the main character.  I found &quot;Atonement&quot; so engrossing, however, that I read the entire book in one day, something I usually don't do.<br />While most books can be described as either plot-driven or character-driven, I think &quot;Atonement&quot; achieves a wonderful balance between the two.  While &quot;Atonement&quot; is definitely not a &quot;page-turner,&quot; plot never takes a backseat to character in this book.  And, conversely, character never takes a backseat to plot, although, in keeping with the book's cool and formal style, we are kept rather distanced from the characters.<br />&quot;Atonement&quot; spans sixty-four years, from 1935 to 1999, yet the book is seamless and flows perfectly.  McEwan chose to write &quot;Atonement&quot; in a very elegant and formal style and I think his choice was perfect.  Subject matter such as that dealt with in &quot;Atonement&quot; could so easily slip into melodrama.  McEwan, however, always keeps everything perfectly controlled and definitely understated.<br />While I thought the understatement in &quot;Atonement&quot; to be a perfect choice, it did create a barrier that kept me from empathizing fully with Briony or any of the other characters. I didn't find them unlikeable, I just felt I couldn't get to know them.  I never really became a part of their world, yet for me, that did nothing to detract from the book.<br />I've heard several people complain about the ending of &quot;Atonement.&quot;  Some felt cheated or tricked.  Personally, I loved the ending of this book and can't imagine McEwan writing it any other way.  What I disagree with is the fact that the book is &quot;multi-layered.&quot;  If pressed, I don't think many people could explain what they mean by &quot;multi-layered.&quot;  This book definitely wasnot &quot;multi-layered.&quot;  We are given Briony's story and Briony's only.<br />I have to applaud McEwan for not judging his characters; for not using his book as a forum from which to make moral judgments.  This choice left the book a little more open-ended than some readers would have liked, but it added a poignant, fatalistic quality as well that I found lovely.<br />&quot;Atonement&quot; is a beautiful book.  It's elegant, formal and very highly polished.  I think it's definitely McEwan's best and most ambitious work to date.
B0000549B0|5.0|I owe my introduction to Harvey, and Jimmy Stewart, to my dad who's turning 50 this winter. He wasn't even alive when this movie came out, but it's one of his all time favorites. I'm buying it for him for Christmas and I was so pleased to see that it had come out on DVD. This is such a heartwarming and hilarious film. It's definately one of my favorites. <br />It tells the story of a man named Elwood P. Dowd who loves to drink, but it doesn't affect his friendly personality. Meanwhile, his sister and niece find him an embarrassing nuicance who is standing in the way of his niece, Myrtle May's, introduction into high-class society. However, Elwood seems oblivious to their behavior towards him and never has anything but a kind word for anyone. Everyone outside his family seems to adore him and his family would love him too if it wasn't for his best friend. A best friend that no one can see. Except Elwood. A 6-foot-tall white rabbit named Harvey. As Elwood goes throughout his day, inviting bums from bars back to their fancy home for dinner, buying people he doesn't even know countless drinks, and giving them his card before introducing them to Harvey, his sister finally decides that that's the last straw and she decides to get rid of him. So she goes to a mental institution to begin the process of having him admitted. And that's where all their problems really begin...<br />This is a wonderful movie that my entire family makes a ritual of watching at least a couple times a year. My little sister who recently turned 8 right up to my parents adore it and laugh and cry with the characters. I hope you'll love it too.
1400049628|1.0|Jeez.<br />From reading the reviews, and looking at the covers, I was expecting a good laugh or two out of this book, and perhaps some chuckles about bad zombie plots.<br />Be Warned!  This dude is SERIOUS!  This book is written AS IF zombies were real, and were ACTUALLY ATTACKING people.  I couldn't believe it.. so I kept reading and paging through it.. and nowhere do you see the tongue-in-cheek!<br />Its not funny, mildly amusing in a few places, and that's about it.  Print off a copy of the back cover, and save your money.

B0000AZJXQ|1.0|It's weak and powerless, what do I've to say more?
0800141806|4.0|This movie features heroic performances by Denzel Washington, Antonion Banderas and, of course, Tom Hanks.  Jonathan Demme's direction is brilliant and each time I see the movie, I discover something new about Demme's method of telling this story.<br />The movie is not perfect.  Some of the pacing of the courtroom scenes misses somehow.  While Tom Hanks's character's family is movingly supportive and loving, the movie would have been still more realistic if it had somehow portrayed some tension in the family, sadly more characteristic of the situation of gay men and their families.<br />As a DVD, it is pretty much barebones.  I would have treasured some extras.<br />This movie probably did a great deal to bring AIDS awareness to mainstream audiences.  It is a fine work and everyone should see it.
0385504209|3.0|Many unexpected twists, turns, and curves made The DaVinci Code interesting at first, but as these surprises continued relentlessly, I grew tired. With mysteries, I as the reader,  at least like a chance to try to figure out &quot;who dunnit&quot; -- but even the most astute could not have in this plot, I believe.  I also had trouble with discerning fact and fiction, and that bothered me - especially considering the substance of the plot.  Disclaimers on a lead-in page of the book lead one to believe that information regarding secret societies and their practices are factual. But the obvious question then becomes, &quot;If they are secret, how do we or the author know about them?&quot;  The end was a little too soppy for me, also.  Starting out, it was a real page-turner, and all in all, it was not a bad read, although putting it down became easier from the middle on.  Generally speaking, it was all just a little too much for my taste.
0066214122|2.0|I used to really like Michael Crichton, and I still *want* to like Michael Crichton. Unfortunately, _Prey_ is not his comeback novel. It feels like he is in such a hurry to get the books out these days that the parts of them are just sketched into place.<br /><br />The idea of the nanotechnology baddie in the book is timely and clearly well-researched. The ending, chase scenes, and all the associated stuff aroudn the relationships, could all have been left out. Too bad.
B00003CXB4|5.0|A wondrous film.<br />A top-notch DVD.<br />Disney's new Special Edition of \\"the Lion King\\" is both.<br />I was fortunate enough to receive an advance copy, and can say that it's one of the best DVDs in my collection, right up there with \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" and \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\\"<br />First off, my favorite part: they give you the choice of watching the movie with a new song, or (for the purists) the original theatrical version. I think that every special edition should offer that option!<br />Both are presented in stunning, crystal-clear DVD quality--and the film itself has been cleaned up to make you feel like you're seeing \\"the Lion King\\" for the first time.<br />The sound is incredible (especially if you have a decent audio setup), making you feel like you're right there on Pride Rock with Simba, Zazu and the rest. Elton John has never sounded better (unless you've actually been to one of his concerts), and it's thrilling to finally hear James Earl Jones on DVD as one of his most memorable characters.<br />It's always tough to decide whether or not to replace a VHS copy with DVD, but \\"the Lion King\\" Special Edition makes the answer obvious.<br />(\\"Yes.\\")<br />- cousinpaco
B00008AWOD|5.0|Placebo went in more Trip-hop and electronic areas after releasing &quot;Blackmarket music&quot;.their new album is another part of their evolution - hard crunchy guitars are still existing but are also powered by samples,synths and lot of electronic.<br />Brian Molko's vocals are still melancholic and full of despair,lyrics are depressing as well.all tracks are great,&quot;Special needs&quot;,&quot;Plasticine&quot;,&quot;English summer rain&quot; are only few diamonds from this album.<br />anyway,it is propably their best album bacause of perfect mix of electronics,avantgarde and rock.Somebody told that Placebo is the best band in the world - well,now they are not but another album like this and they will be!
B00005RFQ5|5.0|If \\"emancipation\\" was to \\"Sign \\"O\\" the times\\" then \\"the Rainbow Children\\" is to \\"purple Rain\\". i was very surprised when i first heard this Cd. it was very breath taking. For many years ive been thinking prince was losing his thunder but this basically shut me up for the second time! the first time was Sign O the times!. Prince is an amazing artist with lots of potential. But This is Gospel Funk so it might offend people so my advice is if your religious your gonna like this album if your not Listen to Prince's groove and listen to the melody and i promise your gonna like it. And if this Review doesent help go to apple music store or press play and Download \\"the Sensual Everafter\\" for 99 cents and then see! cause his guitar solo in that song sounds like he stole Hendrix's Guitar and barrowed Santana's Strings! Unbelievable!
B00002Z88D|3.0|on &quot;S and M&quot; metallica became polished,balanced and rawless...<BR>i loved Metallica for their brutal and agressive trash metal songs and even for solid heavy-rock from their latest albums.here in orchestral arangments all tracks are loosing power and emotions and are becaming blank.i am telling about &quot;Fuel&quot;,&quot;Until it sleeps&quot;,&quot;the thing that should not be&quot; and some others.luckilly &quot;One&quot;,&quot;Human&quot; and &quot;Outlaw torn&quot; became much more stronger and monumental after filling it with Michael Camen's orchestra.the sound gets much more dream-like and you can just flow with music...<BR>anyway - get Metallica's regular albums.&quot;S and M&quot; is kind of experiment,surely it's interesting but not really great.This group works better without orchestral power!

Key songs are Anna Stesia and alphabet Street!
B000083E79|5.0|Cher does not have a traditional voice in any sense of the word: it is darkly colored, slightly nasal, rather bombastic, and of limited range.  But Cher also has the ability to translate her limitations into assets, turning them into a uniquely personal style.  And in an age when popular music seems to generate one cookie-cutter singer after another, her uniqueness is a breath of fresh air.  You will never mistake Cher for any other singer.  She is always unmistakeably herself.<br />Most compilations present the obvious hits in sequence or in no sequence at all--but THE VERY BEST OF CHER begins with her most recent mega-hit and then by and large tracks backward through the decades.  The format serves the artist very well, giving us an aural portrait of how she has reinvented herself time and again over the decades even while staying true to the basic nature of her earliest sound.<br />The opening track, of course, is &quot;Believe&quot;--and on it Cher offers one of her finest vocals.  But she also takes advantage of production, funneling her vocal through a synthesizer that gives her a remarkable series of tones.  &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time&quot; follows, and it is easily the best of her &quot;power rock&quot; efforts, a good piece of music flawlessly performed.  Her disco sound is represented by &quot;Take Me Home,&quot; and the earlier 1970s offers such standards as &quot;Dark Lady&quot; and &quot;Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves.&quot;  Ultimately we arrive at the earliest Cher of our memories: the hippie-esque chick with lank black hair and twitchy body posture who swayed beside her much shorter husband Sonny Bono on such songs as &quot;The Beat Goes On&quot; and &quot;I Got You, Babe&quot;--the songs that originally launched her career.<br />Some of the music is weak, and now and then a selection doesn't really show Cher's voice at its best, with &quot;All I Really Want To Do&quot; a true miscalculation: the song is clearly beyond her range.  But even when the music itself is weak or even just flat-out wrong for her, Cher herself is always dead on the money: she gives everything she has to give, there are no halfway efforts, no hiding behind the tricks that other singers so often use.<br />The masters here are very good, and while there is always a quibble over what should or shouldn't be included in a &quot;Best Of&quot; release--I myself miss &quot;The Way of Love&quot;--this is pretty much the essential recordings.  Whether you're a hardcore fan or just looking for the best possible overview compilation, this is the one you want.<br />--GFT (Amazon Reviewer)--music itself is weak or even just flat-out wrong for her, Cher herself is always dead on the money: she gives everything she has to give, there are no halfway efforts, no hiding behind the tricks that other singers so often use.<br />The masters here are very good, and while there is always a quibble over what should or shouldn't be included in a &quot;Best Of&quot; release--I myself miss &quot;The Way of Love&quot;--this is pretty much the essential recordings.

B000002JA8|4.0|Again the Pet Shop Boys played their little trick on their fans. The album Very was released in 1994, and didn't do very well commercially or critically, and while the Pet Shop Boys shortly thereafter toured, it had the feeling (partly due to the rumour mill) that this was in fact a farewell series of performances. The next year, when the dual-disc set Alternative was released, the question was largely, 'Alternative to what?' -- a real album, a continuation (Alternative was made up of all the non-album b-sides that had been released during the Pet Shop Boys career, once again fueling speculation that this was a tying-up-of-loose-ends at the end of a career).<br />Then, in 1996, the album Bilingual was released, again following the by-then-well-established pattern of releasing a single, then follow-up with the album. This was an 'out' album; while most people always knew the alternative sexuality of the group, it had never been made explicit in the group's official publicity. Now, it had been. No surprise to anyone really (does anything coming from any band from the 80's really surprise anyone?).<br />The Pet Shop Boys managed to release an adequate album, alas, not their best work, and indeed some commentators, remembering the speculation that they were ready to retire, opined that retirement would have been better than this.<br />Not so, to be sure -- this is a perfectly serviceable album, good in many respects; the first single, Before, was released with a CD-movie of the video (very useful for those without Euro-MTV, American MTV long since having left the genre of the Pet Shop Boys behind and thus unlikely to carry their videos even when they win Euro-MTV awards). This song included many of the classic Pet Shop Boys elements -- poppy dance tune, double-edged lyrics, sample heavy feel, and toe-tapping rhythm.<br />The rest of the album is influenced obviously by the groups adventures in Latin America and Latin Europe during their concert tour, as well as holidays in the sun. Songs such as Discoteca and Se a vida &eacute; contain in their titles the influence; peppered throughout with almost spoken lines in Spanish (&iquest;Hay una discoteca por acqui?), almost as if they had simply lifted lines from their Berlitz travel phrase book. But, in the traditional quirky Pet Shop Boys way, these fit in nicely with the tune.<br />The transitions on this album are interesting -- for the first time, the Pet Shop Boys didn't have their songs as isolated bits, but many instead flowed together--Discoteca and Single being two prime examples, which bleed together musically and lyrically, the end of Single being also the first line from Discoteca: (&iquest;Hay una discoteca por acqui?).<br />Songs in the much more traditional upbeat, lyrically-cynical and clever, electronically pop include To step aside, A red letter day, and Saturday night forever. Tennant begins to allow himself some more direct social commentary in songs like The survivors, which can be understood on many levels. Of course, Tennant's lyrics on the album Behaviour poked fun at those celebrities who, because they have fame, suddenly start taking themselves seriously as experts on social concerns, so he is understandably cautious and understated in his own observations, which are usually very much rooted in his own, direct experiences.<br />As with many Pet Shop Boys albums, Bilingual had a follow-up single, Somewhere, which was not included on the album, but was on the special edition, limited release of the double-CD Bilingual. This second disc includes in addition to Somewhere remixes of several of the album cuts, as well as an additional b-side.<br />The songs Before, Single, and A red letter day charted variously around the world, but didn't catch hold and take top honours anywhere. Alas, the Pet Shop Boys looked like they were past it. But history has proven differently.<br />This is an essential album to anyone who wishes a complete Pet Shop Boys collection -- the special album only for those die-hard collectors who can spend extra on auction sites or some such to track it down, but one gains little musically from it. However, this album is for the most part a placeholder in the overall history of the Pet Shop Boys (for the historically inclined, perhaps it is the 'James Polk' of their albums, adequate but undistinguished, often forgotten, but still on the books).for those die-hard collectors who can spend extra on auction sites or some such to track it down, but one gains little musically from it.

B0000C7PRY|5.0|I have been a Spock's Beard and PROG fan for years. But more importantly I've been a Christian for 22 years and have always wished,prayed, and searched diligently for better Christian music. It is so hard to find the marriage of good musicianship,lyrical content, and genuinely moving music in one group or artist. Well, that marriage is finally complete!!! Let me make myself clear-I would love this album for it's incredible performances/songwriting/production-if it had nothing to do with Neal's conversion to Christ-but it is exactly that which makes it so powerful and genuine. As he says, &quot;everything on this album is true.&quot; He might not have all of the &quot;Christianease&quot; language and spiritural references down-his is an innocent,genuine,and exciting experience-which constantly harkens to the cries of the psalmists-&quot;&quot;God,why have you forsaken me&quot;,&quot;I am another heart w/o a home&quot;,&quot;I need you, not just emotion&quot;. There are so many powerful lyrics, that I can't do justice in this review, but my fav is from &quot;Oh to feel Him&quot;=&quot;I waved goodbye to my past and into the kingdom&quot;-which is the true testimony of all believers! This album is everything I hoped,dreamed,and prayed for. Mike Portnoy is as incredible as ever on drums,as all of the studio guests are(it was great to hear Kerry livgren again)-but what is most impressive is the job that Neal does playing so many different instruments so incredibly well-even electric guitar!!! I too was disappointed with the new SB cd, but what do you expect with such a talent gone(they've done the best they can), and the greatest part-this is just the beginning of a new career for Neal and all of us fans-&quot;In the land of beginning again&quot;. Way to go Neal, our thoughts,prayers, and support are with you!!!
0060012358|5.0|This is one of Pratchetts best!  While set on Diskworld, the novel stands alone.  Being familiar with characters and events from other Diskworld novels does slightly enhance the reader's experience, but isn't at all necessary to understanding and enjoying the story.  Buy it, read it, enjoy it!  FIVE STARS!
B00005221M|5.0|It's hard to describe the feelings this picture inspires. James Fenimore Cooper's book was one classic I read a couple of times when I was a teenager. The archaic English and the possible improbability of the story never interfered with the basic beauty of the book, the story it was telling of the inroads of Europeans on the territory and very existence of Native Americans. As I continued in historical advanced placement classes and in my own research, I found that many of the fears demonstrated by Cooper in his novel, concerning the decimation of many tribes, the greed all too present in those nations fighting for territory and the natural wealth of that territory, the misuse of the land, and the death of the rich wilderness that was America came true.<br />I don't usually watch or purchase R-rated movies. Just a particular quirk of mine not to fill my mind with mindless junk. Yet, I saw this movie on the television (where it had been cleaned up), and I'm absolutely sure that if it were made today, it would have been given a PG-13. It is violent, but then so was life on the American frontier.<br />The scenery is awesome, the acting superb. My first introduction to both Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeliene Stowe who were the embodiment of what Cooper intended. The screenwriting kept to the intent of Cooper's writing. The supporting actors were incredible...all of them. The part where Uncas dies in protecting a white woman who was more of a child and in psychological stress never fails to bring me to tears. <br />The final lines spoken by Russell Means that life would go on, but the Native Americans and their cultures would not be there to see the future, but that their imprint on the world would still be there, even if it was just in their respect and appreciation of nature.<br />As always, the widescreen enhanced version of the DVD is the smartest buy for those like me who are hearing-impaired, and watch with the captioning. Only in the widescreen versions can we enjoy the movie without having our necessary captioning being done over the picture and interfering with our enjoyment.<br />Karen Sadler
0375703764|4.0|It's enjoyable. I'm not sure why, but it really crawled under my skin and creeped me out. I don't scare easily, but this book did put me in quite the state. Definitely not for those who are annoyed by the breaking of standard literary conventions.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|This recording is excellent, from the amazing opening track, which Dylan himself has called his best song, right through the &quot;desolate&quot; ending. As always, Dylan's stream-of-consciousness lyrics are bizarre, dizzying and most of all, breathtaking. As a classical singer who's usually singing pieces whose melodic and harmonic complexities often overwhelm the most beautiful lyrics, i really appreciate the lovely simplicity of his tunes. Not only do they allow for singing along, one of the best ways to bring people together in my opinion, but the spare musical lines allow the poetry to shine through. Critics may use this simplicity to claim that the album is musically too basic, but in my opinion this only lends it a more elemental emotional force.<BR>And to the Vanilla Ice fan a few reviews back - are you aware that this album was recorded long before you were born, and that it was a heavy influence on almost all of the &quot;artists&quot; you mentioned as being superior? I'd advise a bit of reading on the history of rock before you write another review.
0345457684|4.0|Noir sf. Lovely, lovely prose. Dark and moody. And original. Mist falls on the city &quot;like sheets of muslin.&quot; Clone pods are &quot;lozenges.&quot; &quot;The young men in silk watched us go with the dead-eyed concentration of snakes.&quot; &quot;...a soft silk bouse settling over her torso like dark water.&quot; Beautiful. Plus violence and sex retold so graphically as to elicit sharp intakes of breath. <br />Cool concepts, too. It's a very coherent, fully fleshed future world, with histories, technologies, mythologies, revolutions, countercultures hinted at. Much fodder for more books from Morgan, I hope.
0446677450|2.0|Not sure about the readers, but the writer surely is getting rich. One thing I learned from this book was how to sell anything with eye-catching phrases like the title itself \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money--That the Poor and Middle Class Do Not!\\" or any of Mr. Kiyosaki's other titles. A poor/middle class dad/mom (most of us) will buy this book out of emotions. This guy has setup companies, selling seminars, books, audio-tapes, games all at exorbitant prices ... All of them beat the same drums. There is a saying in east: if you give turmeric powder to a monkey, he will paint it all over your butt. Somebody told this author buying real-estate is good and he is painting it all over his books, tapes, games... everywhere. Its so boring. All the concepts in the book could be written in couple of pages. Some of the concepts are pure (junk) - for example: \\"Don't buy home, put your money in real-estate\\". Well, I always thought home IS real estate. Mr. Kiyosaki wants us to believe home is a liability. VERY poorly written book and just fills up pages of useless coversation between author and his fictional rich dad.
B00006ZSAD|2.0|It's possible that I haven't given &quot;Out of Season&quot; enough of a chance, but after 2 listens through I'm a bit disappointed. Gibbon's voice is interesting and emotive, as always, but the lyrics seem to lack edge, and music isn't especially interesting- piano and orchestral mainly. I understand that artists want to experiment and not be pidgeonholed and whatnot, maybe Beth Gibbons didn't want to spend the rest of her life as a Trip-Hop Goddess, but this album seems like a sort of ordinary use of her extrordinary talents. Her voice is good, but not enough to carry the album for me. &quot;Tom the Model&quot; is the only track that stands out in my mind.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|Dance of Death is Iron Maiden's return to their classic eighties sound. It far exceeds anything they released during the 90's, especially Fear of the Dark, the God awful X Factor and Virtual eleven. If you stuck with Maiden through those dark years, then you will love DOD. If you are stuck on the classics, then you will probably be a bit dissappointed.While DOD has the greatest elements of the classic albums, many of the songs come off as filler. The album often seems to go through the motions but misses the mark.The album seriously suffers from rehash and slow bass intro syndrome.There are many guitar solos, but they sound off the cuff and improvised in the style of Dave and Janick. I really did not notice Adrian who usuall has very well thought out solos. All in all, this is a decent album, far better than most music out their and belongs in every Maiden fan's collection. Here is a break down of the songs.<br />Album Cover 2/10 This is one ugly cover.The worst Maiden ever. I recommend getting a better one off a fan site.<BR>Wildest Dreams 8/10 Straight forward rocker. Memorable. Don't know why people rate it so low.<BR>Rainmaker 9.5/10 My favorite. Another memorable straight forward rocker.<BR>No More Lies7/10 Starts a with an extremely reshashed slow bass intro.Don't like the chorus. The song is kind of generic and definately way too long.<BR>Montesgur 8/10 Sounds like a cross between Powerslave album and Bruce's Chemical Wedding. Don't like the &quot;post chorus&quot; with the melody. Overall a pretty good song<BR>5.Dance of Death 8/10 Another long, slow, bass intro. Sounds like another Bruce solo song. Finally picks up and has a classic Maiden sound. A bit flat and has a terrible sounding single guitar folk lick that kicks off the middle section. Great lyrics. Overall a decent song.<BR>Gates of Tomorrow5/10 I really do not like this song. Starts off with a Man on the Edge type riff. The first sung vocal lines sound like something from Spinal Tap. It picks up, but is overall really generic.<BR>New Frontier 8/10 I liked this song better the second time I heard it. Memorable verse and chorus.<BR>Pachendale8/10 I am really surprised that this is most people's favorite song. It starts with a hideous single guitar tapping pattern.I absolutely hate it. It is replayed several times later.The song picks up and gets heavy and rocking during the verse. I think there is another folkish typer guitar in the middle that i really dislike. A bit proggish.<BR>Face in the Sand 7/10 Yet another slow bass intro. Heavy song, but filler.<BR>Age of Innocense7/10 &quot;Aarghh&quot; Another slow bass intro. Very mediocre song with upbeat chorus.<BR>Journeyman 7.5/10 Maidens first clean tone and acoustic song. Good in some parts, flat in others.

B00008BXJ6|5.0|This is the American debut of AC/DC, and from the moment this record was released, rock and roll as we knew it would forever change.  The last line of that sentence may sound a bit corny, but anyone who's familiar with the AC/DC story knows it's also true.  However, &quot;High Voltage&quot; wasn't initially greeted with love in America. As the liner notes state, it got a scathing review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in 1976, when Billy Altman dismissed the record as an exercise in &quot;calculated stupidity.&quot;  Well, not only has this record gone multiplatinum, but it also helped secure the band an esteemed place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Not bad for &quot;stupidity,&quot; huh?  Anyway, &quot;High Voltage&quot; is really a compilation of the group's first two Australian albums and it's one of the essential AC/DC recordings of the Bon Scott era.  The essence of &quot;High Voltage&quot; and AC/DC is pretty much summed up in the infectious &quot;Rock and Roll Singer,&quot; which is nothing more than a carefree tribute to having a good time and dodging responsibility.  Other highlights are &quot;TNT&quot; the bluesy drive of &quot;The Jack,&quot; and the excellent &quot;Live Wire.&quot;  The production has a somewhat raw and bluesy feel; it sounds like the band recorded the album right in your own living room.  &quot;High Voltage&quot; has been remastered by Sony, and the booklet has interesting liner notes and great photos of the band.  Along with &quot;Powerage&quot; and &quot;Highway to Hell,&quot; &quot;High Voltage&quot; is one of my favorite pre-&quot;Back in Black&quot; AC/DC albums and should be one of your first purchases, even if you already have the original pressings of the LP, cassette or CD.
0385504209|2.0|I am amazed that no other reviewer has even commented on the shockingly incongruent battle scene involving Langdon, Sophie and the sinister Father Fabrizio Canteloppi, the nunchuk wielding Bishop of Barcelona.<br /><br />Why did author Dan Brown include this highly unusual battle sequence in the first place?  It serves no purpose, it is quite confusing and there is absolutely no resolution or further mention of it at the novel's completion.  A loose end that was never tied up in this reviewer's highly qualified opinion.<br /><br />During a break in the novel's action, Langdon and Sophie are hastily consuming common American food fare and American champagne (Coca-Cola) in one of their ubiquitous golden arched restaurants that spoils our otherwise pristine city of Paris.  They are suddenly, savagely and quite inexplicably attacked by Canteloppi, nunchuks a-flying.  How revolting.<br /><br />Did Brown really need to write nearly six pages of mind-bogglingly detailed descriptions of the ensuing carnage?  Pickles flying, people screaming, battered lettuce strewn everywhere, abused condiments staining patron's clothing and several innocent bystanders being horrifically pummeled by flying fried potato slivers?  Was this all necessary?  I think not.<br /><br />Had this been a film, no doubt the sinister Father Fabrizio Cantelloppi would have had mismatched American dubbed dialogue over his sonorous Italian voice.  The residents of the forty-eight contiguous states of North America will read anything apparently.<br />Two stars for featuring our gorgeous city of lights as the bastion of superior culture that it truly is.
B00008973Q|5.0|When Ran was released 18 years ago I remember seeing it at a small art house and not really following the story too clearly but being impressed with the sheer magnitude of the affair. The previous video version of the film did little to dispel my doubts. The film was too foreign for a mainstream audience to fully grasp.<br />Today after having viewed the Masterworks Edition of Ran I can finally say that I understand where the great master was trying to take his audience with this his last great epic. Ran in this edition is truly spectacular. The colors pop off the screen, every instance of ambient sound is enhanced in a 5.1 Dolby soundtrack and finally the subtitles (while still not perfect) have been set onto the film in such a way that they are a joy  to read.<br />Ran is one of those great films that becomes better as its audience ages. On a basic level this is Kurasawa interpreting Shakespeare's King Lear in a Japanese fuedal tradition. But it is much more also. This film deals with Buddist philosophy, the impact of war on society and family disintegration. The title can be roughly translated as &quot;chaos.&quot;<br />Some of the special features on this disc need to be mentioned. The commentary by Stephen Prince is easily woth the price of the disc. Turn off the subtitles and listen to Mr. Prince's shot by shot analysis for one of the truly great commentaries on Kurasawa's work. Also the more sparse commentary by Peter Grilli is worth a  listen for its anecdotal information on the great director. The disc is finished with two theatrical trailers and a short restoration demo.<br />All in all this is a difficult and important film that is well worth the time it takes to view. Do yourself a favor and see one of the great films by a true master of the cinematic art.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|Bowie has always been accused of possessing a chameleon like persona, but the 'reality' is that he simply has the courage to explore every aspect of music that he takes a fancy to.  \\"Reality\\" is no exception.  Just a shade further towards inventiveness than \\"Heathen\\", Bowie pulls together a full album set that possesses his entire creativeness with no filler.<br />Featuring Tony Visconti as an effectual producer of famed renown, the songs surpass what most expect of Bowie.  \\"New Killer Star\\" piles on the guitars with a goofy synthesized background loop and \\"Never Get Old\\" succeeds with an upbeat rhythm destined to be a dance hit and a radio favorite.  The range of song moods is large, with \\"The Loneliest Guy\\" harkening back to the Fripp-Eno age with space guitars and synthesized over samplings, while \\"Days\\" is reminiscent of the \\"Hunky Dory\\" period with it's happy, pop ditty silliness. The biggest surprise is \\"Bring Me The Disco King\\", a slow piano lounge lizard song with multiple Bowie over-dubs.<br />Two big numbers here are \\"Fall Dog Bombs The Moon\\" and the title track, \\"Reality\\" which have the same driving chords and strong beat Bowie used so effectively in his \\"Let's Dance\\" era.  But make no mistake.  Despite the similarities to previous work, Bowie has brought out some wonderfully new music - music that has matured smartly.
0380715430|1.0|I am an undergraduate student in linguistics, and as a gramarian, as well as someone who has a genuine interest in languages, of any sort, I must say that this book represents the lowest and least informed type of linguistic literature to date. Bryson has no concept of science, meticulous research, or humility. Besides his overly glaring inaccuracies about the languages of some Alaskan peoples (they aren't called Eskimos anymore, Bill), there are numerous other, smaller slipups which harm the book's credibility as a well-researched treatice greatly. Most notable among them, for me, was when Bryson glibly stated that the language, Irish Gaelic, has no words for &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, so its speakers must resort to expressions such as &quot;I think not&quot;. On the contrary, the words, &quot;ta/&quot; and &quot;ni/l&quot; are as often used as not for these expressions. And was I the only one who noticed that in deliniating the list of words Shakespeare gave us, Bryson used obseen twice? Also, much of this information is not only inaccurate, but hopelessly dated (Australians hardly use expressions such as &quot;cobber&quot; anymore). In short, I was so disgusted with the book that I only read about half of it before becoming thoroughly unable to continue. This is rubbish; read something by Stephen Pinker if you want something not only based in scientifically proven fact, but presented by a professor with degrees in the subject.
B000002H72|5.0|Ever heard of alternative rock?  Well, that was basically the Pixies' idea.  Along with the likes of Husker Du, The Replacements, and R.E.M., this Massachusetts band paved the way for Nirvana and laid the cornerstone for the sound that has dominated rock ever since.  With searing guitar work, punkish aggression, and addictive pop melodies, the Pixies (for better or for worse) directly or indirectly paved the way for just about every modern rock band you hear today.  And &quot;Doolittle&quot; is one lovably weird album.  I just got it a few months ago, but even fourteen years after its release it still packs a wallop.<br />In the form of Frank Black and Kim Deal, the Pixies were fronted by undoubtedly one of the most formidable one-two punches in recent memory.  Black, aka Black Francis, is definitely one of the most unique vocalists these ears have had the pleasure of hearing.  Possessing a range that has to be heard to be believed, he could go from singing to demonic howling literally without warning.  Kim's vocals were far more subdued than Frank's, but her ethereal, often haunting voice was the perfect counterpart to his maniacal vocal stylings.  She could also drop some amazing basslines, as tracks like &quot;Tame,&quot; &quot;Monkey Gone To Heaven,&quot; and &quot;There Goes My Gun&quot; attest.  The other half of the band wasn't too shabby either.  Joey Santiago's amazingly fluid guitar leads were models of efficiency, and David Lovering is a severely underappreciated drummer.  Although he was no Dave Grohl, David was certainly a lot more skilled and creative than the glorified metronomes you'll hear on the radio today.<br />If there's a problem with this album, it's that it reaches its high water-mark too early.  On the very first song, in fact (in my humble opinion of course).  The raucous opener &quot;Debaser&quot; is like caffeine, adrenaline, and Red Bull all converted into three minutes of music, propelled by jagged guitars, frenetic drumming, and Frank's ear-piercing shriek.  The bizarre lyrics even include some Spanish just for a little extra craziness.  Listening to this song and looking back through a decade and a half of history, it's easy to see where the origins of the alternative movement came from.<br />&quot;Doolittle&quot; doesn't scale such lofty heights again after the opener, but it's not for lack of trying.  Not only is this album full of great songs, it's full of great songs that don't sound anything like each other, which is an incredibly difficult feat to pull off.  Not content to settle into one niche, the Pixies bent genres with a vengeance here.  Pop, rock, and punk were all thrown into a blender on &quot;Doolittle&quot; and what came out was undeniably the band's own creation.<br />After &quot;Debaser,&quot; &quot;Tame&quot; throws a bit of a curveball by starting out quiet and eerie, but then out of nowhere Frank unleashes a pulverizing scream that's roughly comparable to a sucker punch in the gut.  &quot;Wave Of Mutilation&quot; and &quot;Monkey Gone To Heaven&quot; are studies in dynamics: loud-to-soft, slow-to-fast, male vocals to female.  &quot;Crackity Jones,&quot; the band's demented take on Latin music, features some insane vocal riffing from Frank that brings to mind the great Mike Patton (Faith No More, Mr. Bungle, etc.).<br />The joyous surf-pop tune &quot;La La Love You,&quot; the ominous &quot;There Goes My Gun,&quot; and the twisted pop of &quot;I Bleed&quot; all manage to be simultaneously trippy, unpredictable, and wildly catchy.  And while &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot; may be basically straightforward pop, its melody is so irrestistible I think only the most joyless snob could claim not to like it.<br />Now I should note that initially this album can be a bit much to put together.  I wasn't too impressed with it on first listen, but after a while I realized that some of the songs kept bouncing around in my head for days.  Eventually the drastic changes in the music, which seemed somewhat arbitrary at first, just started to make sense until I realized how brilliantly odd &quot;Doolittle&quot; was.<br />I still wouldn't go so far as to say this is my favorite alternative album.  That distinction would have to go to Jane's Addiction's &quot;Ritual De Lo Habitual&quot; and Faith No More's &quot;The Real Thing,&quot; as I find those albums to display somewhat stronger musicianship and a bit better production.  However, &quot;Doolittle&quot; is still an essential part of a good music collection.  Not many albums can maintain legitimate alternative credibility while being consistently fun and catchy, but this is definitely one of them.  It's just too bad I didn't get a hold of it sooner.emed somewhat arbitrary at first, just started to make sense until I realized how brilliantly odd &quot;Doolittle&quot; was.  <br />I still wouldn't go so far as to say this is my favorite alternative album.

B00005U11Z|3.0|Steve Augeri cannot (or chooses not to) hold the notes for as long as steve perry can, and that is a major part (trademark) of journey's sound. The rest of this DVD is pure journey.
B000002MG1|5.0|This album is just great.  This is how I remember the 90s.  I love every track on this CD.  Really good stuff, and not just the popular tracks.
0684833395|2.0|'Catch-22' is a pretty famous book, so you might think you need to read it to be &quot;well read&quot;. Don't. If you read more than 20 pages you will just be wasting your time. You get the idea by the time you finish the first couple chapters, and after that it's just the same stupidity over and over again. Save yourself some time and trouble and just skip the entire thing.
B000002LOE|5.0|Too bad Nirvana's Nevermind had to come out at the same time and overshadow this cuz this CD's truly a lot better.  I love every track on this album.  Even if it didn't have Losing My Religion (which is one of their worst songs - too poppy), this CD would be awesome.  The second half of this album just flows.  And there's guest vocals, and Michael doesn't do all the singing.  Good stuff.
B000092T6M|4.0|Some movies are intended as entertainment only, and &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves&quot; certainly fills that bill. It's a &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;-style adventure movie, which means it has an old-school attitude toward physical stunts and special effects. It was made back before digital effects started replacing actors and sets, and today, in its wonderful new DVD incarnation, feels like a breath of fresh air. This isn't &quot;Godfather II,&quot; but man, I love this movie.<br />People gripe about Costner's accent, or lack thereof. Get over it. He's a movie star here, coming off &quot;Dances With Wolves&quot; and &quot;Field of Dreams.&quot; Robert De Niro might have done a wonderful British accent; he also probably would have wrecked the movie far worse than Costner is accused of doing. What this movie needed was a likable, positive, magnetic star in the lead role. Costner had the goods then, and I think he still does.<br />In addition to Morgan Freeman and the luminous Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (whatever happened to her?), this version of &quot;Robin Hood&quot; has Alan Rickman, who's just a hoot as the Sheriff of Nottingham. I am willing to forgive his anachronistic behavior because he elevates the movie to another level of escapism, providing great fun and humor just when things might be getting a little too uppity with Costner's Robin of Locksley. Together, Costner and Rickman provide a contrast in showmanship that's just plain enjoyable to watch.<br />The action sequences are well-staged, energetic, quick, brutal, and (again) fun. And the production design is excellent -- grubby without looking cheap. A great-looking movie on the big screen that holds up well after all these years.<br />I'm pleased with the new 2-disc DVD. I bought it essentially for the commentary with Costner and director Reynolds; their remarks are almost as entertaining as the film itself. (I've listened to Costner on quite a few commentary tracks, and he's loose and candid, not just about his own work, but the Hollywood system in general. Wish he'd lay down one for a new &quot;Waterworld&quot; disc.)<br />My only complaint about the DVD is that the sound quality is sorely lacking; the dialogue tracks are muted and muddled, while the music drowns out everything else.<br />Is &quot;Robin Hood&quot; perfect? Nope. But you gotta accept each movie on its own terms, and for what it is, &quot;Robin Hood&quot; still rocks.
B00005JLTN|4.0|The Matrix Reloaded was a huge hit that I looked forward to intensely. I had thoroughly enjoyed the first installment and thought that the second would take the story to new dimensions. In some ways, the sequel far outdid the original. In terms of sheer adrenaline and eye-popping action, for instance. The patented bullet-time special effects return, but there's plenty of new eye-candy. The movie also offers even more insight into the Neo mythos. Nevertheless, the movie fails colossally in other areas. One need only mention the Neo-Trinity Romantic Chemistry (I am being ironic, of course: there was no chemistry) and the general self-importance of this more dark and stark film. In any case, what results is a mixed-bag that twists and turns unevenly to its enigmatic (and improbable) denouement.<br />'Reloaded' was a sequel that was destined to be made, and there are many parts of it that sparkle. The car chase scene, which pits Morpheus, Trinity and Co. against a duo of dreadlocked cyber-twins as well as a plethora of agents simultaneously on the 101 highway is one of the most jaw-dropping pieces of film that I have ever had the pleasure to see. It could quite possibly take the mantle as the most intense car chase scene ever. Bullitt, French Connection, I'm sorry, but your days on the throne are over. The sequence goes on for over 15 minutes, but it doesn't drag at all (unlike other parts). In fact, I would have liked plenty more. Another highlight is Anthony Zerbe's small role as a civil administrator in Zion. He added a nice bit of introspection into a movie that sometimes lacked it. The film had a number of fascinating secondary characters, including the keymaker, the mirolyngion (I have no idea how to spell it), the Architect (\\"God\\") and others. Speaking of the architect, his scene was the movie's most intriguing. He spoke so fast in some sort of mathspeak but he had a magnetic presence on the screen and his character remained a delightful mystery. Hugo Weaving wasonce again wonderful as renegade Agent Smith (although the much advertised fight scene with Neo against an army of Smiths was too long).<br />That seemed to be the central problem with this film. The Wachowskis, who had created a perfectly-paced action film in The Matrix, seemed to lose focus in some of the fight scenes. Most of them, while plenty mesmerizing, go on for far too long. The pacing of the film itself is uneven, the movie starts, then stops for exposition, then starts up again. The Zion sequence is much too long (seeing a pattern?) and the 'rave' scenes are repetivive and gratuitous. Trinity and Neo are not at all convincing as a couple, perhaps less convincing than that venerable couple from Star Wars, episode 2: Darth Vader and the Queen; even less convincing than Hemingway's duo in A Farewell to Arms. At least in the other two they said that they loved each other, however unconvincingly. I never for a second believed that Neo, with all his responsibility for his race, would give it all up for the girl, and this greatly hurt the film in my mind. Speaking of Neo, Keanu Reeves loses the tolerability, okay, likeability that he had in the first installment. He is cold as ice all the way through, no emotion or passion evident. And even more annoying was his continued flying. He became a deus ex machina whenever anyone was in peril, spending more time in midair than spouting meaningful dialogue. Too bad. All the way up to the supposedly cliffhanger ending he just seemed like he had lost touch with the character.<br />In short, this is a film that took some risks, some of which worked out and some of which didn't. The movie was entertaining, of course, and philosophically interesting (albeit less so than its predecessor), yet its characters don't quite come alive the same way. The producers just didn't know when to say when throughout the film, and as a result the movie seems somewhat bloated. It does, however, work as a film and as a sequel and is definitely worth checking out.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I pull this DVD collection out every 6 months or so, cook some pasta, and watch the entire set again. The entire process takes several days. Here's why: each film has a running commentary by Francis Coppola that runs the length of each film. The three films runs about 9 hours, but the commentaries double even that long running time. On top of that there are even more extras. Coppola talks a lot about all three films, and it's a very engaging listen. (Yes, he talks about Sofia's performance in III).<br />So, putting aside the fact that I and II are among the greatest American films of the 20th Century, it's actually pretty cost efficient entertainment investment, too.<br />For trivia buffs, I offer the following: In III, there is a montage of newspapers covering the death of the Pope, the Immobiliare, etc. Freeze the picture, and look at the newspaper text under the headlines. You'll see news copy referring to the 1990 invasion of Kuwait, and even some text from a word processing manual! Time must have run out in the editing room. Coppola's great, his attention to small details....he's not Stanley Kubrick.<br />Recommended (before any other DVD I can think of).

B0000C8AVE|5.0|First of all, this is one of the best Dylan albums available. The remastered sound is fantastic.  While many remastered CDs often sound too clean, this cd has be able to grasp the spirit of the original recording, so much so at times it feels as if one is standing in the studio with Dylan.   To address some criticisms, first, while this is an SACD release, it is a Hybrid which means that it has the capability of playing on a standard CD player.  Second, while I'm sure a previous reviewer will disagree...Justin Timberlake will long be forgotten in 40yrs, unlike Bob Dylan; &quot;Freewheelin&quot; was released over forty years ago and is still great.  If you are a fan of Dylan, this is a must have!

It's the type of music that lacks nowadays. Music with feeling. Music that made a difference. I miss these types of records. Oh sure there are the rare birds(i.e. Norah Jones, Alicia Keys, Josh Groban) but they are few and far between. This is only Elton John album you will ever need. Elton John is simply a musical genius, and I'm so glad that this album....OF ALL HIS HITS is one here. All THE HITS. So many tiems, Record compnaies will leave off just one or two to make you buy those albums(generally the ones that didn't seel the most). Not here!!!!!! This collection is perfect for the muscian, or anyone with Good taste in music. What a wonderful collection of songs.
B00009XITP|4.0|&quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; is supposedly a remake of 1958's &quot;The Reluctant Debutante,&quot; although really the only thing in common is the idea of a young American girl (Sandra Dee) having to enter prim, proper, and priggish British society.  Besides, most teenagers will be convinced &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; is ripping off &quot;The Princess Diaries.&quot;  Anyhow for this 2003 film there are some additional complications.  Once upon a time dashing Englishman Henry Dashwood (Colin Firth) hooked up with American hippie Libby Reynolds (Kelly Preston).  While the legitimacy of their Moroccan marriage is in doubt there are two things we do know.  First, that Henry's family found a way to send the American misfit packing.  Second, after her return to the States Libby gave birth to a daughter, Daphne, who grows up to be Amanda Bynes.<br />Of course Henry does not know about Daphne.  Of course Daphne manages to leave her apartment over the Chinese restaurant and get to England where she is able to surprise her father.  Of course Henry is about to marry a snobbish Englishwoman (Anna Chancellor) who has an equally ambitious and even more conceited daughter (Christina Cole) and neither of them can stomach Daphne's surprise arrival.  Actually, there is pretty much nothing in this film that is not a surprise, which is really something we should have known going into this one.  If Daphne has been dreaming all of her live of a father-daughter dance at a formal occasion then you can take a wild guess at to which scene in &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; is supposed to make you cry.<br />These stories are all pretty much totally predictable.  But Kenneth Burke defined &quot;form&quot; as the creation of an appetite in the mind of an auditor and the satisfying of that appetite, which explains why this film is enjoyable for its targeted age and gender group (i.e., teenage girls for already adore Amanda from Nickelodeon).  Beyond that there is the charm evidenced by daughter and father in this film.  Bynes gets to have scenes where she is sassy and those where she gets to play dress up in a big way, while Firth gets to play a most reasonable British politician who has an inner free spirit just waiting to break out and start dancing in front of a mirror.<br />There are some funny moments, usually as the expense of Daphne's father's future daughter-in-law, which usually involve putting some life into a series of stuffy British affairs.  Then there is Amanda's newly discovered grandmother who explains, &quot;No hugging, dear, I'm British.&quot;  It is clear the old lady is one of the few people in the film with her heart and her brains both in the right place and you wonder why she does not cut through all the nonsense and stop everyone from delaying the inevitable.  But &quot;What a Girl Wants&quot; knows not only how this story is supposed to be told but exactly what its true source is when Daphne tells her nemesis: &quot;My evil step sister, you've seen Cinderella, right?  Let me clue you in. I win.&quot;<br />Which, of course, she does.ghter and father in this film.

B0000399WI|5.0|This movie is an instant classic, an amazing story with flawless performances by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman.  One review below said they laughed through the whole movie.  Well, I laughed all the way through Titanic which was a disaster in filmmaking and an embarrassment of DiCaprio's career.  If you prefer a thoughtful, well-acted, well-written story, this movie is for you.
B0000041TD|5.0|A few years ago, opera aficionados on a panel during a Metropolitan Opera broadcast were asked which opera was their first love. Each panelist said La Boheme, and each could remember a particular cast that made the opera magical. One panelist said \\"I think we all remember our first Boheme.\\" I do not recall the cast, but I do remember the first time I heard this opera. I was a senior in high school and I purchased a budget recording of the work. The fact that the quality was sub par did not matter, because I did not know the difference anyway. I had to listen with headphones since my siblings did not appreciate opera the way I did. At the beginning when Marcello sings about his masterpiece to be, a painting of the Red Sea and Rodolfo spoke about his writing, I knew they were both geniuses in the making. Even though I had yet to fall in love, I knew that Rodolfo meant every word he sang when he \\"O Soave Fanciulla\\" to Mimi, he meant every word. I understood the struggles between both parts of lovers in Act III even though I had never struggled to keep a rocky relationship alive. When Musetta prayed before Mimi's death, I believed the sincerity of her intentions. And I shared Rodolfo's grief when Mimi breathed her last. After the recording was finished, I recall feeling so moved I could not speak. I can still recall these feelings when I hear the opera performed, or listen to a recording, and Karajan's version of this magnificent work can do it to me all the time.<br />What can anyone say about this recording that has not already been said? Luciano Pavarotti, Mirella Freni, and Nicolai Ghiaurov were all in their prime at the time this recording was made, and it captures the magic that each vocalist offers. Even though neither Pavarotti nor Freni are the appropriate age for the young lovers, listeners will excuse this because of the beauty of their voices. The passion and tension that defines the relationship between Marcello and Musetta comes alive with the singing of Rolando Panerai and Elizabeth Harwood.

B00008J4P5|5.0|a work of art. although a true fan knows the sound of the real white stripes..comes from their previous albums.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I'm guessing you all have been waiting for a new cd from APC, me too. Now its in stores and online, so go and buy it. Compared to the last album it is more mellow, but still as good, if not better. So all I have to say to all the die-hard APC fans: If you dont have the album, buy it, you wont regret it; and if you dont have the first, get that too. I'd say you cant have one without the other. Live hard and Rock on!
158234082X|2.0|I was really looking forward to this book because I heard it would tell me everything I DIDN'T want to know about what was going on back in the kitchen of most restaurants.   I was looking for the book to relate to ME and tell me about things I am interested in. <br />Instead, I got a bunch of choppy stories that won't name names or places and seem to be hazy at best in their recollection.  I'm not saying Tony is a bad writer; I think he's pretty darned good at writing.  It's just that in order to protect the not-so-innocent, he has to blur our all the details.<br />He seems to be fixated on fish, which I can't stand and most of the first part of the book only offers advice on what sort of fish you should stay away from in restaurants and when.  I did like the chapter on Bigfoot, but everything else about the book was a bore.
0385512104|5.0|Although it's not mentioned in the book our narrator and hero, Christopher Boone, has ausperger's syndrome - a form of autism. Remarkably Mark Haddon never did any real research into this condition; instead he took experiences of other kids he had worked with, and some of our more extreme personality traits, and used them to create a marvellous, whole, emotionally challenging boy. His starkness and simplicity strangely give the writing a warmth that could so easily be missing.<br />This book is Christopher's account of his investigations into the mysterious and brutal death of his neighbor's dog. One of Christopher's favorite characters is Sherlock Holmes and he attempts to use his instincts to guide him - facing terrible fears such as talking to strangers along the way.<br />Christopher's world is both simple and highly complex. He is a savant - extremely gifted numerically; he enjoys telling us of his math puzzles and other such ideas. Somehow Mark Haddon manages to introduce all of this without boring or alienating us. He employs Christopher's care-worker at school, Siobhan (for Americans like my wife who don't know how to pronounce that, it's kind of like shove-aun) as a pseudo-editor. 'Siobhan told me that would be boring and to put it in an appendix' kind of idea. Every now and then he says something that surprises us and then we learn that Siobhan told him to put it in. This is an extremely interesting a powerful device to employ - luckily Haddon uses it sparingly though.<br />In Christopher's world there are some things he can never do. He cannot tell lies. He will not break promises. However, the total logic can sometimes give him an out. He knows about &quot;white lies&quot; which he terms not telling the full truth - e.g. when his dad tells him what he did he knows to tell him about math problems, not about his detecting. When his dad makes him promise to give up investigating the case he stores this as five distinct promises and when something comes up that we would immediately say is connected, he rationalizes as not one of those five things.<br />At times during the book we feel an incredible empathy with Christopher. There are a number of these but I will relate one particularly poignant episode where he sits on a tube platform in total shock as swarms of people fill the platform, wait for a train, get on it and the cycle repeats. He cannot move, he cannot think, he just sits and sits until the cycle dies down as nighttime falls and he can finally summon the courage to move.<br />Christopher &quot;solves&quot; the case, unexpectedly and also finds out that his Dad has been hiding important things from him. The book, rather like the famous film about autism &quot;Rainman&quot;, comes a little full-circle at the end - Christopher has moved on, emotionally, but what sort of life will he end up leaving. We've moved on, too, and have experienced a wonderful, thought-provoking journey - one that will stay with me for a long time.
B0000A2ZO1|2.0|I am a bigtime Trek fan, so bear with me. I've seen every TNG episode multiple times, and the final TV episode ranks up their with the best television I've ever seen.<br />But this film, despite moments of excellence, is a turkey. I rented the DVD, and was so peeved at various parts, including, in particular, the ludicrous (and unfaithful to longtime viewers) ending, that I immediately rewatched several extremely annoying scenes with the director's commentary with my wife. Our mutual thought: What were they thinking?<br />Fans have invested a lot into these characters, and it would not be a bad trek move to kill them off -- if it meant something. This end was so lame that it had us wondering &quot;he died for that?!&quot; It was as if a garden-variety blown fuse had electrocuted Geordi. And, it invalidates the final TV episode (Arggh!).<br />The movie does get two stars, only because the basic plot itself is simply brilliant -- that a clone of Picard, with a far different childhood -- turns into a monster capable of ultimate evil. It could have been high concept Hollywood at its best. The actor who plays Picard's clone gives a fascinating, poignant and very cool performance that nearly rescues this wreck of a movie. Picard, as always, is superb, but he's stuck with C-grade lines too much of the time. All of the other characters are in some sort of fog, including Data. Many of the named cast (Dr. Crusher, anyone), are nearly written out of the script. And, in the worst Trek tradition, the cheese factor on some of the special effects and fight scenes is simply Velveeta. The scenes on Romulus include laughably bad sets...<br />Bottom line: There is a reason why this Trek is so cheap on DVD and the TV episodes so pricey. Go buy &quot;All good things...&quot; on DVD, and revisit the magic that has so tragically gone out of this series that had been so dear to me, and let this turkey lie.
B000020617|3.0|i agree that this is not a bad album but it is far from good as well.  (i also agree that i dont think Dave and  co. could make a bad record)  the foo fighters 2nd album, the colour and the shape was a great record filled with enough melody and yet plenty (and i mean PLENTY) of raw edges and emotion to make it a masterpiece.  <BR>    the foo's third outing , there is nothing left to lose has way too much sweetness in sound.  there is not enough raw edges.  the opener (called stacked actors) sounds like something from hell with that great groove that kicks off the album.  (it also sounds like something kurdt cobain migh thave used via in utero)<BR>     but there are few songs like it.  the album is far too overproduced and ends up being such a disappointment for me but that does not  mean it is a bad album.  songs like next year and M.I.A really hit a nerve with me.  they are so beautiful and dave has one of the best voices in rock, if you ask me.  for me i prefer the anger and emotion and utter rawness(both in music and lyrics) of the colour and the shape.  the raw emotion that bleeds through is so wondeful and that, to me, is what is missing on this album.  there has to be a blend of sweet and sour and this album has too much of the former and not enough of the latter.
0385504209|5.0|As a member of a secret society similar in structure and intent to the Priory of Sion, an organization pivotal to the plot, I heartily recommend this book to all students of the Mysteries.  Under the guise of writing a detective novel, Dan Brown explores the mysteries of the uncanny role played by Phi and the Fibonacci number series in organizing Western conceptions of art and nature, the dominance of authoritarian patriarchal religious systems such as Judaism, Chrisitianity, and Islam during the last millenia and a half, and the re-emergence of feminine  conceptions of the divine in an age of transnational corporations and nuclear weapons.  Guaranteed to shake up your world view.  To shake it up even more, read The Christ Conspiracy by my friend, archaeologist, historian, mythologist, and linguist, Acharya S.  Her book assembles an enormous amount of startling evidence to demonstrate that Christianity and the story of Jesus Christ were created by members of various secret societies, mystery schools and religions in order to unify the Roman Empire under one state religion.
B0000028RR|5.0|part black sabbath, part led zep, part punk fury, part hardcore and part public enemy, this album is diverse and amazing.  tom morello is such an exquisite guitar player.  his manipulation of the guitar re-invents the instrument and its sound.  (eddie van halen eat your heart out)  he is tasty and brilliant.  he strums, his guitar screams,  he plays his guitar at times like a DJ sctraching.   <BR>     the rhythm section is incredible.  Y.Tim K on bass and Brad on drums dropping the dope beats and funking it up like old school funk meets new age hip hop.  Front and center is the eye of this hurricane.  Zach De La Rocha.  (his lack of presence in music in 2003 is felt very hard)  he is intense, intelligent, creative, angry, focused and exploding.  this is, undeniably, the best rock rap band ever.  and this album from &quot;bombtrack&quot; at the begginning (which will blow you out of your seat) to the feedback drenced &quot;Freedom&quot; to close , unimpechably, one of the best hard rock records ever made.    <BR>    each member is ingenious in their own way.  tom is the new guitar master as zach is a hand grenade always exploding.  in the background but by no means are they taking a backseat is the rhythm section.  brad on drums is amazing.  simple, powerful and down to the beat (or point) Tim is such an amazing bass player.  different, inventive and oddly familiar.  <BR>   no one member is central.  it is the combining of the four memebers of RATM that make the group so dynamic and extraordinary.  their demise is tragic
B00005YW4H|1.0|this girl sounds too old, is just too young, and has meaningless music. Her music is something someone would kill themselves to, because it is just too damn depressing. she needs to come up with something slightly better, cuz for one thing, she's ugly as hell, her voice is too thick, and she sounds like someone has just killed her and she's gonna share her depression with all of us. thanks but no thanks, i'll pass. too critically acclaimed, she's not good yall...people need to see what real music is...and that is not norah jones....
0743424425|5.0|When I first picked up THE SHINING I had a feeling it would be good. I was 14, and just starting to get into the whole horror genre. Not the suspense, I had already gone through all the Crichtons. But horror, the things that evoke some of the most primitive emotions from within you.<br />It took me 6 months to finally finish THE SHINING. It started off with the first 100 pages being awesome. THen, with parts like &quot;The Wasps Nest&quot; and &quot;Checking In&quot; it bogs down and isn't as interesting. This is were I switched to other books, and truthfully I dropped SHINING for a while. 3 months, I believe. What brought me back? This was not the first book that I had gotten 300 pages into and dropped. I made a resolution to finish all the books that I had dropped in this way. Damn, I'm glad I did.<br />UNMASK!<BR>THE SHINING gets good in Part 5: Matters of Life and Death. That is were Jack is completely turned by the spirits of the hotel and turned on Wendy and his son. Aweseome. The entire ending, you guess at who will die, and who will live, that is, if anyone lives. Jack is torured, cannot control himself and still tries to fight it. You don't know about him. Wendy risks her life (a bit stupidly at some times) to protect her son, and in doing so shows a strong bond that only this type of situation could bring about. ANd then there's Danny. Whether or not the boy will live is the biggest question. He isn't exactly innocent. And the hotel wants HIM. The last part of the book I read very quickly. And just right. The horror of this novel is momentous, the scariest thing I've ever read. I mean, THE SHINING is much much more than the average spook story. The charcters are so real they could show up at your house and knock on your door (or in some cases, knock it down with a mallet.) All in all, SHINING is reccommended to anyone with enough imagination to believe that such a thing is possible-a man turned against himself and his family.<br />Some scenes are touching,some funny, some boring, and some delve deeper into fear than any other author has ever done. This book is awesome. Anyone who likes thrillers or hell, ANYONE would like this book, I think.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I bought the album the day it came out and I've got to say,APC You rock!!! Sweet, mellow, jagged and angry all intertwined to create an album that is highly addictive tugging at your emotional strings and pounding your soul with every drumbeat! Maynards voice tears through the listener like a sharp knife at times then caresses you      and licks your wounds. A truly inspiring album that I am proud to own!
6305127638|5.0|Star Trek: First Contact is the most searching, driven, smart, and watchable of the Star Trek movies.  The character development is mostly even-sided, and we can see the actors having fun with their characters in ways that they had not done in the TV show. <br />There are humorous scenes: an exasperated Riker trying to talk with a 21st century Zephram Cochrane while a drunken Troi passes out; a blearly-eyed first warp-drive mission accompanied by Steppenwolf, a Captain jealous of Mr. Data's ability to turn off his emotions when frightened, and a angry Klingon telling a Borg precisely what he can assimilate.<br />There is increadible action and suspense: a fight against the (nearly) unstoppable Borg as they colonize the Enterprise, a race to protect humanity's past and secure its future.<br />There is real character conflict.  Captain Picard gets angrier than ever as he faces his own consuming drive to destroy the Borg.<br />A smart movie, and a fun one, too.  It seems that Star Trek always succeeds when it takes its cues from Melville.  <br />Sail on.
B00000AFFI|5.0|Its been almost 5 years since I've purchased this CD, and I still listen to album everyday(especially when I study or just feel lonely). This is one of the most intriguing, compelling, mind-bodling, spellbound displays of musical brillance by PJ Harvey. The music alone is absolutely captivating, creating a moody and romantic atmosphere that is undescrible to someone who hasn't heard this masterpiece. Every song creates a different ambiance, with PJ Harvey's voice rising over the music to create a perfect combination. Her voice is definitely much more powerful, seductive, and well improved from her previous releases. Critics may argue that her best recording may be To Bring You My Love, but this Cd certainly dismantles the melocholy mood of To Bring You My Love. To Bring You My Love has a few great songs, but it is not a Cd that you can listen to from top to bottom without skipping a few tracks. On the other hand, Is This Desire is one of those rarities that can be played from beginning to end. It is the perfect Cd to play in the background with a romantic candlelight dinner at your apartment with the lights really low. My favorite songs are The River, The Sky Lit Up, A Perfect Day Elise---who am I kidding---they are all perfect!!! This is an absolute masterpiece!!
B0000AR8NK|5.0|This album continues what his last album started--what seems to be an infusion of new energy and creativity into Bowie's work.  While the last album was more inward (addressing god at times) the new one is definately focused outward; it rocks, is often upbeat and a bit more electronic.  I hope that he plays this straight through on tour, it would easily work.<BR>The first three songs (new killer star, pablo picasso and never get old) are great songs, as are &quot;fall dog bombs the moon&quot; and &quot;reality&quot;.  There is not a single song on the disc that doesn't rate four stars and there are a number of five star tracks.  Bonus tracks are excellent.<BR>Normally, one would expect an artist who was active in the late sixties and early seventies to rely on old music, and not play much new material.  (In most cases that is a blessing).  Not with Bowie.  The thing which amazes me is that if this was Bowie's first album, people would think he was an incredibly talented young artist.<BR>And indeed, he is.
B00000811N|4.0|A great companion disc to Atom Heart Mother on which Ron Geesin also collaborated. Songs range from sound effects to songs like &quot;Sea Shell and Stone&quot; similar to grantchester meadows (on Ummagumma studio album). &quot;Body transport&quot; is very amusing.<br />Highly recommended for anyone who liked Atom Heart Mother
B000089RVX|5.0|When I first heard Bring Me to Life i didnt like it. But then I heard it again and fell in love with it so the next day I went out and bought the cd.  Just about everysong on this cd I like except for the piano ones which are ok but I dont really listen to stuff like that.  My favorite songs are Bring Me to Life, Everybody's Fool, and Going Under.  All the other songs are awesome as well but those are my favorites. If you dont own this cd go and get it now.
0446605409|5.0|Ok, I have to sound sexist here, but I don't mean too.  I enjoy DeMille's works a lot more than I do the several mystery books I've reviewed by women authors.  Perhaps it is a point of view thing.<br /> 'Plum Island' wasn't as good as &quot;The General's Daughter&quot; and &quot;Up Country&quot; in my opinion, but it is a very good mystery and very well written.  Are men just better writers for men and women just better for women?  Or is DeMille just a master and some of the others I've read just plain good?  I don't know, but I know that I can't get enough of this guy's writing, and I've been sharing his paperbacks with my mother, who burns through them as well.<br />If I have any complaints about this book, and where I found it fell short of being as good as the others, is that the ending had a little too much violence.  I don't mean this in the way of description, I just found the antagonist's actions to be too much over the edge.  He wasn't developed enough as a character for me to believe he'd act as he did.  However, the skill at with which DeMille handles the protagonist is enough to keep this book at a &quot;5&quot; and it still comes with a strong recommendation.<br />If you enjoy mysteries, cop/detective novels and suspense, this book will not disappoint.
B00004Z459|5.0|Ok when I first heard Crawling I was hooked. I loved that song to death and it could never get over played.  So i said maybe I will by the cd. Now then I hardly bought cds because I would only like a couple of songs and listen to them once in a while so the cd was wasted but I decided what the hell and bought it.  One of the greatest decisions i ever made. Everysong on this cd is awesome.  Everytime I listen to this cd it still sounds fresh and new as the day I bought it.  None of the songs on it suck.  No skipping of tracks should be done of this cd.
0671015206|5.0|Knowing and doing are two entirely different beasts.  Doing is vastly more important, talent always taking second fiddle to persistence and action.  However, it is always good to increase knowledge and this book gives some simple information that should strike most readers as obvious.  If only knowledge lead more easily to action.<br />There are probably better books on the market that deal with how to obtain and keep wealth, however, this one lays out the simple formulas that lead to becoming a millionaire and how  too many us ignore them.  It is not a &quot;how to book&quot; so much as it is a &quot;this is how it is&quot; book.<br />I highly recommend this work.  It is especially encouraging to those that perhaps had a tough start in life or had little or no higher education.  I also recommend other works by this author to those in that work in a selling environment or are considering a career in that field.
6304712499|2.0|Oh dear. Spawn certainly falls short of everything that made the comic such a big hit. The action sequences are good, yes, but who cares? It's all show and no substance. More could have been done to: show the effect Spawn has on those around him; show his inner conflict, the 'whatever he does is bad' theme present in the comics; make Cogliostro less an interfering Yoda-figure and more of a mentor, the only one who gives a rat's ass about Spawn; make Malebolgia more convincing, and fix the Hell scenes; cut out the random elements which spoil it, such as the Clown's face on the spade, the way the Violator turns into a bookshelf and back again, the way Spawn's cape never seems to know whether it's coming or going.<BR>It was a good idea, the opening sequence is fantastic. The hell vortex? Then the example of Simmons in action? Excellent. You know he's a good guy straight away. But a crap script, horrendous miscasting of Leguizamo as Clown, and a dumbing down of the major themes turned this potential blockbuster into a B-movie nightmare.
B0000B3FCX|2.0|After reading so many reviewers saying that The Long Road is the best CD by Nickelback yet, I was slightly disappointed when I got it home.  Too many of the songs sound the same.  Actually, I think the best song on the album is their &quot;cover&quot; of Elton John's Saturday Nights Alright (for fighting).  Now that song rocks!<br />And I must agree with the reviewer that said the packaging sucks.  It does. Who the hell wants packaging like that?<br />So in my opinion, Silver Side Up is still (by far) Nickelback's best album.  The Long Road and The State are OK albums but, song for song, they just can't compare to Silver Side Up.<br />But HEY... if you haven't checked out the DVD of Nickelback in concert, THAT is what you need to get.  It is absolutely first rate.  The filming, the playing the song selection... everything is just stellar. (There is some cursing on it but who the f#@k cares!)  So if you like Nickelback, buy that next. <br />Franco<BR>Pennsylvania
0553579908|5.0|Let's get a few things straight. If you liked the first book then you will like this book, if you didn't like it, then don''t bother. This books progresses in the same manner as the first and is just as good, maybe even better. You must read the first book before getting this. So jump on board one of the best fantasy series in the making, and continue with this book. It does not disappoint.
B00005AQGH|4.0|Makaveli - The Don Kiluminati: The 7 Day Theory (The New and &quot;Untouchable&quot; Death Row Records, 1996)<br />We all heard about the supposed relevance of 2Pac's &quot;Makaveli&quot; alias and the album title, so I won't start this review with those theories. But this album was 2Pac's last real album: &quot;real&quot; meaning as opposed to those all those mediocre posthumous albums that were released after this one, and &quot;real&quot; meaning that he really poured his heart out on this one.<br />The &quot;ready for war&quot; 2Pac is on here, dissing all of your favorite New York rappers like Jay-Z, Mobb Deep, and of course, Nas (&quot;God don't like ugly/It was written/Hey Nas, your whole damn style's bitten&quot;, from &quot;Against All Odds&quot;). How Nas became 2Pac's foe is anyone's guess (perhaps because that 'Pac's &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot; and Nas's &quot;Street Dreams&quot; had the same beat) but the story was that beef was squashed through a mutual friend but the news never made it to Death Row Records, who rushed this album out.<br />So we have to sit through that beef as well as critcism to Dr. Dre for leaving Death Row. See &quot;Toss It Up&quot; where Makaveli's questioning Dre's sexuality. This record serves as a double-diss: Aaron Hall is singing on this record and as you remember, at the time he had beef with former Guy bandmate Teddy Riley, who created &quot;No Diggity&quot; with his new group BLACKstreet (featuring Dre rapping). This is why the beat to &quot;Toss It Up&quot; is similar to that of &quot;No Diggity&quot;. The disses don't stop there as EDI Amin of the Outlawz embarrasses himself on &quot;Bomb First&quot; dissing fellow West Coaster Xzibit: &quot;Got a little question for that [expletive] that made 'Paparazzi'/If you ain't in this rap game, for the [expletive] cash, man/ then what is your [expletive] purpose?&quot; None of the other Outlawz rap any better on this album, but I never expected much from them, anyway.<br />When The Don tackles other issues, he shines. &quot;White Man'z World&quot; is the best track as he talks about society getting down on the brothas. And he uses metaphors wisely as he treats his gun as his girlfriend on &quot;Me and My Girlfriend&quot; (Nas did the same thing that year with &quot;I Gave You Power&quot;, describing himself as a gun; another reason for the 2Pac/Nas beef, perhaps?).<br />Though you can tell this album was rushed in some places, especially in the filler track, &quot;Just Like Daddy&quot;, The 7 Day Theory is still, as Makaveli said, the realest ish he ever wrote. While Pac's best album is still Me Against the World, this album is a classic just like that one. -EJR
B0000025H6|2.0|This CD has to rank as one of the most overrated CDs of all time. Overproduced, pretentious, and depressing Roger Waters' arrogance permeates throughout the work.  <br />This 2-CD set could easily have been condensed into one CD. It has exactly four good songs:  &quot;Another Brick In The Wall Part I&quot;,  &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot;, &quot;Young Lust&quot;, and &quot;Run&quot;. <br />There are far better Pink Floyd CDs than &quot;The Wall&quot; including &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot;, &quot;Animals&quot;, &quot;Meddle&quot;, &quot;Pink Floyd&quot;, and &quot;Echoes, Best of Pink Floyd&quot;. <br />If you want excessive, pretentious CDs that are well done, buy something like Queen's &quot;A Night At the Opera&quot;, Yes' &quot;Close To the Edge&quot;, Emerson Lake and Palmer's &quot;Brain Salad Surgery&quot;, or Rick Wakeman's &quot;Journey To The Center Of The Earth&quot;.  If you want two CDs of Roger Waters whining, then &quot;The Wall&quot; is for you.

B00005YUNY|5.0|This is truly exceptional. If I had to chose one recording to give to someone either unfamiliar with Yes, or someone on the fence about them, this would be it.<br />Jon's voice has never sounded better, to my ears. Steve Howe's guitar tone? Sounds excellent to me, I don't hear what others have been critical of. His lack of animation? So what. Watch the master at work. And it's all the more fun when he does bust out a little move here and there. When he jerks his head a bit, you know it's part of his musical experience, not put-on.<br />The classic epics benefit tremendously from the orchestra. The editing is just about perfect. The mix, well I've only listened through little TV speakers so far but even that way it sounds superb, especially for a live performance of such complexity.<br />You don't have to be a Yes fan to enjoy this. And if you are a fan, then you simply must have this. If you are a &quot;backslidden&quot; Yes fan and don't know they've truly come back to form of late after all these years, then this is a great place to start getting caught up.
B00005JLO2|3.0|Shekhar Kapur's follow-up to &quot;Elizabeth&quot; has already gathered so much expectation.  The result is not bad, but still disappointing partly because of its comparison with Zoltan Korda's classic version.  The newer one sufferes from modern politically correct climate of film-making, giving the whole film quite unnecessary aspects.  Still, the actions are good, and its sweeping story with romance is not to be missed.<br />The story is based on AEW Mason's 1902 book, but as you expect, changes are made.  Heath Ledger's character Harry resigns his commission just before his army is sent to the Sudan, and his friends sent him three feathers as a symbol of cowardice.  To make things more humiliating, his finacee Ethne also gives another, refusing him in the face.  So to disprove the four feathers, Harry goes to Africa alone, where the native warriors rise up against the British army there.<br />The main plot is left intact, but here and there you see some modernized parts that attempt to side-step any pro-British empire nuance.  So, Harry should doubt his own mission because he doesn't care Her Majesty's land in Africa.  This is meddling business, for though director Kapur might resent some patriotic tones of the previous films, the original book is free from any jingolistic tone, so all he had to do was to stick to that source, and then to give us the good story about courage, friendship and romance.  I simply don't know why he has to apologize for the empire's deed now when what we need is not that apologia which only slows down the film.<br />Another mistake is the casting of the main characters.  It is impossible for me to imagine Kate Hudson as middle-class Victorian lady no matter how she is taught by dialogue coach.  The same goes to Wes Bentley who got famous in his portrayal of youth in &quot;American Beauty.&quot;<br />Having said that, the film's actions and photography are astonishing.  The grand scale of the Sahara is beautifully realized, and the battle scenes are as rousing as that of &quot;The Gladiator.&quot;  And Heath Ledger even shows one great stunt, jumping upon the rushing horse, which is simple breath-taking.   I hope insurance company doens't see that.<br />The film is not a total failure, and always good to look at.  But somehow in the middle of the film we imagine something better, something wonderful is hiding and crying to be rought to the forefront.  And that is exactly the older version of the film.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|Overall, this album is a disappointment for me. The only good thing is that it was quite different from the first album. I am a huge Tool fan and love 98 percent of their music, but I really think Maynard is not giving its full potential on his side project. Perhaps is the other band mates that didn't deliver the right set up for him. Thirteenth step had songs where I actually have to skip, because it was so dragging and uninteresting. APC didn't have the amazing drummer (danny) and creative guitarist (adam) and Maynard didn't sing hard at all. It was the same mood throughout the whole album. I hope this CD will grow on me through time. So far, I've listened to the album 5 times and I can honestly say, there are only 5 songs I like. Not a good album compared to other maynard's work.
0790730960|4.0|Tim Burton's first Batman film was, despite it's flaws, a masterpiece and helped set the standard for comic to film adaptations.  This eagerly anticipated follow up was an instant hit, and saw the return of director Tim Burton and star Michael Keaton.  The fantastic set design and costumes are some of the many highlights here, but the standout performances from Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito as Catwoman and the Penguin respectively help make Batman Returns a more than solid sequel.  Keaton is terrific as usual as the Dark Knight in what would prove to be his last performance in the series.  There is a much darker vibe here than in the first film, and despite some of the film's flaws, it's still one of the better comic inspired films of all time.
B00005JLXE|1.0|This was the worst movie I've ever seen. Don't get it, it sucks!!!
B00006ZCFH|4.0|Erykah Badu has always been a head-turner.  Her exotic beauty, unique outfits, neo-soul song stylings and distinctive singing voice have garnered popular attention for over half a decade.  The latest musical opus from Badu, the EP \\"Worldwide Underground,\\" confirms what Badu fans have known for years:  this woman has serious talent.<br />\\"Worldwide Underground\\" encompasses many of the familiar themes that listeners have enjoyed on past Badu releases, but adds on a layer of freedom and confidence not present on more serious-minded efforts like 1997's \\"Baduism.\\"  This new layer leads to extra long compositions like \\"Bump It\\" and \\"I Want You\\" that explore more complex musical ideas than typical neo-soul songs, including extended percussion solos on the former, and flashes of rock guitar on the latter.  Both are excellent, reliving the fun parts of `70s and `80s R&amp;B without sounding dated.  Songs like \\"The Grind\\" and \\"Danger\\" are harder-edged and focus on street life, but smartly avoid hip-hop clich&eacute;s and over dramatization.<br />One track on this very brief CD is likely to be a hit if released as a single, the remixed \\"Love of My Life Worldwide.\\"  This track uses Badu's 2003 hit of the same name as a base, and layers on a retro party beat and several guest vocalists, including Queen Latifah, Angie Stone, and Bahamadia.  Even if the rest of \\"Worldwide Underground\\" seems too bohemian for some casual listeners, this track will hit home.<br />Buy this album without hesitation.
B000069AUI|5.0|Coldplay, to put it simply, is an amazing group.  I had heard &quot;Yellow&quot; years ago when it came out, and I liked it well enough...but I never bought Parachutes.  I didn't realize how powerful of a band they really were because &quot;Yellow&quot; did not really display that power.<br />I was flipping channels in TV one day and I came across the VMA awards, and a band was on playing a song with a full orchestra, and it was amazing!  I found out that that song was &quot;Politik&quot; and that band was Coldplay...and after that I was completely hooked.  I first downloaded the album Rush of Blood to the Head not knowing what to expect...but I found pure beauty.  All of the songs (every single one) are amazing and intriguing, with unbelieveable vocals and songwriting.  I'm sure everyone has heard &quot;The Scientist&quot; somewhere, or seen the video perhaps...but that is only one facet of this album.  To really understand you have to listen to it all...<br />If you are looking for something new, or if you are simply looking for a good musical experience that is enjoyable in every way, look to A Rush of Blood to the Head and Coldplay.  Oh, and don't forget to listen to Parachutes as well...it is just as good as its follow up!<br />&quot;Blame it upon a rush of blood to the head...&quot;
B0000B3FCX|5.0|I just picked this up an hour ago, and love the CD.  Chad is a great songwriter, I can hear improvement in their sound and lyrics, and all around this CD rocks.  Sophomore albums are always a hard one to nail, but Nickelback did it.  I make music myself and am in the music business, and Nickelback is doing it right.  You want a great album, here you go!
B0000AXE8I|3.0|I thought the film was very entertaining, and I did enjoy the special effects as well as the fight scenes. I am a little confused and completely in the dark as to what the next one could possibly hold. I would have rated this a two, except that it gives you a bathroom break 1/4 th of the way through (dance scene)which worked great the second time I saw it.
B00008OWZC|5.0|I DIDNT KNOW THERE WAS RECORDINGS THIS GOOD STILL AROUND. AS A MUSICIAN YOU ONLY DANCE IN YOUR HEAD AND WITH YOUR FEET WHEN SOMEONE IS AS GOOD WITH YOUR MIND AND BODY AS YOU HEAR YOURSELF. MEMPHIS MINNIE, THE BOOM OF THUNDER,  MASTER OF 6 STRINGS AND NOISE,  JOHN BONHAM
B00006AG5N|5.0|When your friends, parents, and *especially* children ask you &quot;what the hell is this?&quot;, you must tell them &quot;It's Elvis F'n Presley&quot;.  Get them out of the Britney Aguilera mold and introduce them to the indie-rock godness of Elvis.
B000002MIF|5.0|Every Smiths compilation has it's highs, my personal favorite is World Won't Listen but there are songs on here you won't get on that one or on Louder than Bombs. Some of their best work, actually, earlier raw versions of some fantastic songs. Must have.
0670033049|5.0|What can I say about East of Eden.  This book is a masterpiece.  This book made me love reading.  I have never in my life become so envolved in a story.  I recommend this book to everyone.  If you pass this book by you will be denying yourself a truly wonderful experience.  The story is timeless and thrilling.
B000089RVX|5.0|Refreshing.  That is all I have to say.  Evanescence is basically comprised of Amy Lee on vocals and Ben Moody on guitar.  I bought this album the day it came out and have not stopped listening to them since.   They are amazing.  Their music has a gothic punk rock sound about it.  It is amazing.  I just don't know what to say to express how much I love Evanescence and everything they stand for.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I agree with people that this is a headphone CD for sure.  Yes, it's great thru the speakers too, but musically (including vocals) it's a multi-dimensional production created by a multi-talented band and you'll be amazed at how deep it truly is!!  Under the headphones it magically unfolds like a rose, deeper and deeper into a universe of sound and rhythm.. and as for Maynard's voice? Well, what can I say, right when I thought it couldn't get any better it has; it's now reached pure perfection!!  So, even if you enjoy this incredible CD thru the speakers (which I do) please get under your headphones, kick-back and lose yourself for awhile...a most beautiful place.
6300163601|3.0|Lovely Bo Derek embarks on an awkward, sensual quest to lose her virginity in the roaring 20's.  Armed with a huge inheritence, her trusty chauffer (George Kennedy), an adventurous college friend (Ana Obregon), an extravagant wardrobe and a seemingly endless supply of black eyeliner, Mac (Bo) travels around Europe looking for a sheik like Rudolph Valentino. Director John Derek, once again, focuses more on his wife's magnificent beauty than the outrageous story. By this point in her career (1984) we've already seen Bo exhaust the \\"innocent virgin\\" role (Fantasies 1974 and Tarzan, the Ape Man 1981). The script is completely ridiculous (which is really o.k. because most of the actors have thick accents that are incomprehensable) but the scenery is gorgeous! Bo tangles with an opium-addicted sheik, a jealous gypsy, and a handsome bullfighter (Andrea Ochinpinti) who wins her heart and her virginity. After he is gored by bull in the privates(!), Bo becomes a bullfighter on horseback and eventually proves that \\"love conquers all\\" when it comes to mending a broken, er..heart! Despite the raging controversy that followed this film, the love scenes are all beautifully photographed and not the least bit pornographic. But this IS a Bo Derek film, which means lots of nudity(!!!). For me, the best scene is when Bo fights the bull in the film's slo-motion climax.  Her skill as an equestrian and \\"humane\\" approach to bullfighting are the most interesting part of this film. Campy and unintentionally funny in some parts, BOLERO is a great choice for a cheesy midnight movie at home. Bo didn't score a \\"10\\" with this silly film, but she seems like she had fun making it. You'll never look at \\"milk and honey\\" the same way again...
B00008BXJG|5.0|And also the second best rock album of all time ever. Bon Scott's last ever. All the evers. Don't listen to me, listen to Phil Rudd on the drums (especially his fill just before the second verse in the title track).
B0000C7PSW|5.0|Every since the album came I have not been able to take it out of my CD player. Rufus's voice goes from soaring to heartbreaking and you can feel what he is feeling in every song on this album. I am already looking forward to Want 2!!!
B00005QY5Y|3.0|Ryan Adams certainly thinks he has a lot to say. To the credit of &quot;Gold,&quot; which I bought after seeing him perform &quot;New York, New York&quot; on some TV show, there are some brilliant moments of songwriting here. &quot;Firecracker&quot; also sounded like I was on the brink of listening to a five star album. But then the songs became meandering, unfocused (like &quot;Sylvia Plath&quot; or &quot;Wildflowers&quot;). His attempts at &quot;rock&quot; are thoroughly unconvincing. The Stones should sue over &quot;Tina Toledo,&quot; and &quot;Enemy Fire&quot; is just a drudge.<br />Like far too many young artists of the CD era, Ryan has yet to learn that your album doesn't have to squeeze into every minute of a disc's capacity. If he can figure out the benefits of self-restraint, Ryan Adams may still pull a brilliant solo effort out of his bag of tricks.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The album is very beautiful and is dynamic.  The psychological side draws you in along with the melodic overtones and drum evolvements.<br />P.S.<BR>This album is NOT Maynard.  He is a part of it and I feel that the rest of the band influences the sound very much.  There's 3 other EXtREMely talented guys. :)
6302816580|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever.I think everone should<BR>see this movie.I am waiting for my sons to get old enough to watch it.It is a very clean movie for the whole family.They need to make more movies like it.
B0000C7PRY|5.0|This album joins Spock's Beard's &quot;Snow&quot; as music that defies labels and stereotypes. Greatness.
B000002A3T|4.0|This album is really different than other pink floyd's albums. More than 20 years separate this album and the Pink floyd's beginning. The division bell is a really calm album with a really smooth ambiance. &quot;Don't listen to this album doing something else. You have to let the whole melody take place in your mind&quot;. Every instruments in this album as a very harmonic emotional presence. Note that the emotional part is not as powerful than Dark side of the moon or animals for example, the division bell is played with in a spirit of an ending legacy: the feeling of letting something really important behind.<br />&quot; This album take place in your mind when you start to feel that there's much behind than ahead. Where a light summer wind feel through your hair and tells you you've done well&quot;<br />Lyrics of the division bell are really easy and light compared to waters his reign.<BR>&quot;But I think that the division bell was build this way, to satisfied and old ear that had enough to hear Vinyl Static sound, by serving a great sound quality, from what pink floyd members were able to do mixed with a wave of new age. To say that pink floyd fans who listened pink floyd in the 70's are now turning 50 years old.&quot;<br />I've listened to all pink floyd album and I appreciate this one in particular 'cause there's nothing like waters and barrett twisted stuff in it &quot;The wall, Dark side of the moon&quot;<br />I'd like to put a particular attention on the last album's song and maybe the last studio song from pink floyd: High Hopes...<BR>&quot;That's the song. A song where you really feel that we're getting old day after day and there's no way to escape. Trough a beautiful ending guitar solo you end the album between reality and dream thinking that you're happy of what you accomplish in your life. With very a nostalgic perspective, you hope there's still something ahead &quot; high hopes&quot;. That's the new age part<br />I rated this album 4 stars over 5. As objective review<BR>Compared to what pink floyd did and what music standards produce.<BR>Top 5 best album pink floyd<br />1- Dark side of the moon<BR>2- Animals<BR>3- The division bell<BR>4- The Wall<BR>5- Meddle<br />But this album is a very 5 ... Relaxing, delicate, musical..<BR>This is the one &quot;I&quot; prefer to listen<br />Enjoy
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Just the simple fact that A Perfect Cicle is like nothing I have ever heard, makes this album just as good as the last. Maynard should be considered of the top ten artists in music, soley because of his amazing voice, and next of kin, the style in which he performs.  This &quot;style&quot; that I speak of, cant even be classified, or catergorized. Cant possibly be compared to any of the exsisting bands that  hoard the radio. Chilling lyrics, carried out by beautifully controlled and soothing vocals, amidst  an array of talent- stricken instrumentals. The first song had me scarred, but when I listened more into, it soon convinced me they hadnt changed into a hippie jam band. Track 2,3 and 7 are particular to me, these songs have already been put on repeat in my car. Great CD, just as I thought. Maynard is incredible.
630280082X|5.0|i dont really have to say anything about it. if you like blues, you like this movie, if you dont like blues, you dont like this movie.
B000084T18|5.0|Aftermath/Shady has really hit the jackpot on this album.  Finally getting his chance to show himself to America, 50 Cent bust out some hot rhymes provided by sweet beats from Dre and Eminem.  They really bring out the dark, methodical beats and 50 Cent's voice blends in perfectly with them making a great trio.  The trinity of them creates an amazing collaberation of some of the top names in the rap industry today.<br />It's kind of odd, however, that the singles \\"Wanksta,\\" \\"In Da Club,\\" and \\"21 Questions\\" aren't even close to the top songs on the album, with the exception of \\"In Da Club.\\"  Also, with the later singles in \\"Many Men\\" and \\"P.I.M.P\\" are very strong songs although only \\"Many Men\\" makes my top 5 songs.  This just shows how deep the lineup is on the album with all 16 songs plus the 3 bonus ones just dominating, as there isn't a weak song on the album.  There are no filler songs, just all pure quality insured by Aftermath/Shady.<br />It is also to note, that 50 Cent really doesn't have a lot of guest support, like Dre's \\"2001\\" or Obie Trice's \\"Cheers.\\"  This is a testament to how he can just hold his own by himself, not needing special guests to drive the quality of the album.  All it needs are some great beats and top notch rhymes.<br />Top 5 Songs:<BR>1) Patiently Waiting (featuring Eminem)<BR>2) Many Men<BR>3) Life's On The Line<BR>4) In Da Club<BR>5) If I Can't<br />Dre and Eminem have really found a rap prodigy in 50 Cent, and thanks to the combination of their production and 50's great rapping ability, a great force in the industry has been discovered and unleashed.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|To all of you who wrote reviews bashing this movie -- look at it again. And I mean, really, just look at it. This movie is beautiful. Maybe we've been numbed by the horrible Star Wars prequels, and other movies almost entirely crafted of CGI, but really...some of this movie is astonishing. Yes, there are times when Neo looks like a video game character, complain all you want. But my feeling, first of all, is that this movie is visually mind-boggling.<br />  The plot is fine. The dialogue isn't. While it's not horrible, Reloaded certainly could have benefitted from another once-over from the Wachowskis before being put to film. Reloaded tends to become more preachy than it needs to be, unlike its' superior predecessor. <br />  Finally, the fight scenes are good, but they take too long. The whole movie is too long. The fans are right -- chop the dancing in Zion, chop the sex scene or at least cut it down a little, the movie doesn't need it. The highway scene is great, Neo's fight sequence in the foyer isn't so great. Lose two to five minutes of it, and the audience will be more wowed. <br />  Overall, Reloaded is a bit of a let-down. But I'm sure once people have gotten over the hype, on home video and DVD, Reloaded's virtues will be better appreciated, maybe people will be able to stop picking at all of the parts that aren't as good as the first film's. And, as a final note...the trailer for Revolutions is astonishing. Visuals of the machine world are mind-boggling. Don't count this series out yet -- something is in store. And whether or not it's perfect is really irrelevant when we can see sights like the Wachowskis have dreamed up. The Matrix is the sci-fi series of the 21st century.
B000023VR6|5.0|Dr Dre, one of the most influential figures the rap industry for the past decade has unleashed a masterpiece that rivals \\"The Chronic\\" as one of the greatest rap albums ever put together.  Dre brings out a host of guests onto this collaberation, such as Xzibit, Snoop Dogg, Hittman, Kurupt, Eminem, Knoc-turn'al, and a nice visit by Mary J Blige in \\"The Message.\\"  This amazing cast really brings the album to life, with Dre's simple yet amazingly deep beats truly make this album a classic.<br />This album is so deep it is incredible.  22 tracks make up the mammoth of a project, with a few interludes scattered here and there.  Besides the unnecessary \\"Pause 4 Porno,\\" they are all relevant and really express on the gangsta theme that is somewhat lightened up from \\"The Chronic.\\"  No filler songs are present, as they are all of extremely high-quality.  It is a testament to how much work was put into this when it could be said that the album would still be a great album even without the top 5 songs on it.  Amazing job by Dre.<br />Top 5 Songs:<BR>1) Still Dre (featuring Snoop Dogg)<BR>2) The Next Episode (featuring Snoop Dogg)<BR>3) Forgot About Dre (featuring Eminem)<BR>4) Let's Get High (featuring Hittman, Kurupt, and Ms Roq)<BR>5) What's The Difference (featuring Eminem and Xzibit)<br />All in all, an incredibly feat brought forth by one of rap's all time greatest.  Dre has created a masterpiece, one that will stay in the halls of rap's finest.
B00008DDSC|5.0|This movie maybe a little bit too much for some people to handle, but if you can get over any conservative ideas about sex then you can truly appreciate this movie.  The story is brilliant, and the actors do a great job.  Dont think this is some cult film for the BDSM community, even though im sure it will become one, this is one of the best love stories ever written.

B0000A02TZ|5.0|The only thing I had against the Double Secret Probation Edition was the extras were too short. It was so much fun watching the actors in the Reunion documentary. They could hardly keep from laughing. Bless 'em! Were we really that young? We loved it!!!!!!
B0000C7PSW|3.0|I waited with much anticipation for \\"Want One\\" and Annie Lennox's \\"Bare.\\"  I've been disappointed with both...  I have always loved Rufus' cynical perception of the world and his place in it.  Songs like \\"April Fools\\" and \\"Poses\\" say more in twenty lines than all of the songs combined on \\"Want One.\\"  <br />The quick wit, obscure rhymes, and cheeky orchestrations of Wainwright's first two albums were amazing.  \\"Want One\\" made me feel as if Baz Luhrman had gotten ahold of the score for \\"Chicago\\" and had Burt Bacharach revamp it, with minimum emphasis placed on the vamp.  What happened to the gothic marimba of \\"Matinee Idol\\"?  It's been replaced by melancholy piano (not necessarily bad) ballads interrupted by selections that should be staged Off Broadway with a chorus full of actors waving jazz fingers.<br />...  Obscure references to Tosca and other tragic opera heroines were much more pleasurable to me than listening to him confess that he doesn't want to be Jane Curtin?  <br />I am giving this album 3 stars because of the arrangement of several songs.  Almost all of the songs' lyrics warrant a single star.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|a perfect circle.....a perfect album....a little on the lighter side, but we can all appreciate the time and talent that went into this project.....Maynards voice is amazing.
B0000B3FCX|4.0|This is their greastest cd, that they have put out. I love this CD so much!  This Cd totally rocks!  The songs are totally great, and the band has become so much better!! Nickelback is the greastest band every!!!
B00008NG5V|5.0|I was actually looking for another CD when I went into Borders, and then I luckily stumbled across this one.  I listened to it from the end rack of the &quot;check these out,&quot; and I ended up loving it.  It's rare for me to find a CD where I really like listening to every single song on it.  This CD is definitely a winner (it's just too bad that the radio seems to be overplaying his songs now - Ugh!).
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Unjustly cancelled by Fox, this phenomenal space western by Joss Whedon has guts and grit and is highly reminiscent of classic themes of the American west and colonial struggles. We have been waiting for it's dvd for so long! I was so excited when I heard that this fantastic show was finally available for preorder--but it was out for two months. But now it's available, and well worth the wait.
B0000C7PSW|2.0|Was &quot;Miss&quot; Wainwright intoxicated when he recorded this album; or did he spontaneously develop a lisp and buck teeth. Who can understand anything he sings? HE SLURS. And Oh God!, it must be so hard to be &quot;Miss&quot; Wainwright. Such a tragic life is documented in these lyrics that I read in the liner notes (God knows you cannot understand them when they are slurred). If you like music that makes you want to slash your wrists open then this one's for you. Just make sure your drunk, have a lisp, and buck teeth when you listen so you may understand.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I have never SEEN so much whining about a film! Come on, people, this movie is freaking amazing. There's nothing out there today that even compares to the Matrix/Matrix Reloaded! ... The Matrix Reloaded is another addition to what promises to be a phenomenal trilogy. Enjoy the music, enjoy the action, enjoy the ride.
B000089RVX|4.0|Where should I begin? This was one of those might-as-well-try-it purchases at the local Wal-Mart. I'd heard &quot;Bring Me To Life&quot; on the radio a few times and it definitely sounded good among all the Staind and Limp Bizkit crap the radio usually plays. So I bought it. The heavy tracks are great, the singer/piano songs are okay, nothing is truly bad. &quot;Tourniquet&quot; has proven to be my favorite song on the record. Some call the guitarist untalented and relying on single-finger power chords, pedals, and distortion, but I say &quot;So What? It works doesn't it?&quot; Indeed it does. I'd recommend this to anyone tired of the same old song and dance.
B000003RCY|5.0|Their first official release is hard, heavy, and should be played very very loud! Industrial? Metal? Techno? Who cares??? All great songs!  Enjoy!
0446608955|5.0|Always wanting to read a book before seeing the movie, I read A Walk To Rememeber before renting the movie. <BR>I finished the book within 24 hours because it was one of those that I just couldn't put down! Being a high school senior, I related the story of HS cliques and homecoming dances. <br />Fromt the book, I thought about my outlook on others and how I treat others who may not be in my &quot;inner circle&quot;. There are great people outthere that we need to meet, regardless of what they wear or who they hang out with. <br />A week ago I would have told you that Message In a Bottle was my favorite love story, but I think Sparks newer novel has won me over. If you're looking for a sweet and fast read, try this one!
B000002HJA|5.0|I beg to differ with most Kyuss fans on this one, in that this album rivals Sky Valley as a desert island pick. While Sky Valley is amazing, it sticks to one mood and one style, which are admittedly incredible, but only one facet of this band's great sound. This album is Kyuss at their most diverse and eclectic. Josh Homme introduces an Arabic-style guitar sound here on &quot;El Rodeo&quot; and &quot;One-Inch Man&quot;, while &quot;Catamaran&quot; and &quot;Phototropic&quot; show a softer musical side, with some nice guitar work. Homme has to be the most underrated guitar player around. &quot;Size Queen&quot; shows them expanding within their sound. It's hard to describe this track. Kinda funky, with a slow, reggae-type tempo, but with a much too choppy riff to describe as reggae. Like I said, indescribable. There's some classic Kyuss rumbling bass on &quot;Hurricane&quot; and &quot;Gloria Lewis&quot; and the jam called &quot;Spaceship Landing&quot; is a fitting end. The song breaks off into 4 different parts that intertwine well, never deviating from it's dynamic, but revealing a band that wasn't afraid of using excess jamming to their utmost advantage. All in all, the band was much tighter on this album, drifting from the loose jammy style of Sky Valley. Both albums rule for different reasons. Most bands don't even have ONE classic album that you can recommend, Kyuss has TWO. Their breakup is a mixed blessing, producing some great offspring in Unida, Slo-Burn and Queens of the Stone Age. You can see how the Queens sound developed from this album; it was like a guide to where Homme was headed. KYUSS, like The Stooges, will be recognized as a truly great band 20 years from now, when it's too late. Consider yourself lucky if you knew them while they were around.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Disney's The Lion King is finally available on DVD.  Considered the cream of the crop of all the Disney animated features by many, it is definitely worth owning.  I don't think I'll go into the story, which I'm sure most of you know.  Chances are you've already seen the movie and are just waiting to own it on a piece of media that won't rot like your VHS tape that probably fell apart by now.  Even if Disney released a sub par release of this movie, you'd buy it.<br />Luckily, this is one of the best releases ever.<br />Video and Audio is supreme in this release.  Especially vibrant is the 5.1 sound.  Of all the older Disney releases, this one benefits the most I think, with the powerful music and sound effects present in this release.  Hearing James Earl Jones as Mufasa blaring  in thunderous 5.1 sound is quite amazing.  Likewise the excellent music, such as the opening Circle of Life.  Present in this release is the original theatrical version as well as a version with new music/song.  I actually didn't care for the new song, but some may.  The extras are quite numerous, contained on a second DVD and are mentioned in Amazon's product details...I haven't had the time to go through them yet, so I cannot comment on the extras.  I just watched the movie again.  To be honest, the movie would be worth it as a single disc release so I'm happy as it is.<br />Some interesting trivia for some of the people who are not aware of it is that The Lion King seemed to be heavily \\"influenced\\"  by an old Japanese anime, Kimba The White Lion.  Those wishing to see the \\"similarities\\" would do well to check out that series as it has also been released on DVD.  Carbon copying aside, I do love the Lion King.  It still manages to grab you whether you are 4 years old or 40.  Two thumbs up!!
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Godsmack continues to progress toward the sound of Metallica and away from the sounds of their contemporaries. Their sound has barely changed, but their formula still works, so there's no reason for them to. Some say all Godsmack songs sound the same, but they're all good, so what's the problem? &quot;Re-Align&quot; does bring back memories of &quot;Keep Away&quot; and &quot;I Am&quot; of &quot;Forgive Me&quot; and &quot;Make Me Believe&quot; of &quot;Vampires&quot;, but they're all Killer tracks. &quot;Changes&quot; is the best song on the record, while the interlude &quot;The Awakening&quot; has no purpose, in my opinion. &quot;Serenity&quot; is an awesome acoustic song with a heavy dose of tribal rhythms and there's nothing wrong with that. Godsmack is the AC/DC of today, they've found a formula that works and they're sticking with it.
B00008DDSC|5.0|I never have considered myself to be &quot;into&quot; S&amp;M. But I could not pry myself from this movie. It is hot,sexy,stirring and strange. James Spader is excellent in this role,it was made for him.You love and loathe him at the same time. I found this movie strangely  exciting and very erotic. It's 9 1/2 Weeks with a kick,and a much happier ending.I will watch this again and again.
B00005JM02|5.0|It seems as though rated \\"G\\" movies are often under-advertised and never really make money or are even worth watching. Generally they're made specifically for children and any humor in the movie is lost on those over the age of seven. Pixar, in the past, has defied these common sentiments with movies like Toy Story 1, Toy Story 2, A Bug's Life, and Monster's Inc. Pixar continues to defy standard Hollywood practices with the release of Finding Nemo.<br />This movie is, by at least a little bit, the best rated G movie I've ever seen. Monster's Inc comes in a little behind in second place. The animation in this movie is incredible, the water, the fish, the particles of dirt floating in the water...there were many points when I would watch the movie and could definitely not be sure whether I was looking at a real or animated sea-scape.<br />The story...the story wasn't anything particularly groundbreaking other than the setting...father loses his son, will do anything to find him. In this case, anything includes taking on sharks, jellyfish, pelicans and other random sea monsters. The father, Marlin, is a clownfish that defies his name by being particularly unfunny...luckily he picks up a sidekick early on with a short term memory problem - a little memento-esque.<br />Nemo, the son, is captured by divers and put in an aquarium in Australia, where he meets several psychotic fish including \\"Gills,\\" another fish from the open sea - whose voice belongs to William Dafoe (in a non-bad guy role!).<br />Of course, being a comedy, the movie does have a happy ending, but the ending isn't nearly as much fun as the trip taken to get there. The movie is great, I went along with indie rock dave and Mike, and they both laughed as much as I did. If a kid's movie can make three college students laugh as hard as we did...it is definitely worthwhile seeing. The movie is genuinely funny and worth watching with the entire family. The movie is safe for small children, though there are a couple of potentially scary scenes that might frighten *really* young children.<br />I have very little to say against the movie, except that the first ten minutes or so drag on a little and the drama seemed a little out of place in the film. Other than that, the plot, animation, characters, voices and jokes make this movie hilarious and fun to watch.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|Well, I've not seen what they've done to restore this treasure trove of Classic Who footage, but I'm sure The Who is finally getting the treatment they've deserved all these years.  It was a great loss to the band to lose the OX,  but he's up there with Moonie jamming away still trying to keep up with the runaway train!<br />For anyone who hasn't seen this film, you owe it to yourself to pick up a copy if you call yourself a rock fan.  No Who fanatic should be without this movie; simply the best documentary of the rock group for all time.  I can't wait to see all the extra stuff that's been added, plus the new Version of Tommy in 5.1 surround that's also coming out shortly.<br />Run to the store tomorrow and get a copy for you and yours...<br /><br />FHC<br /><br />Addendum to previous review:<br />I should have added this years ago after I bought the disc... heheheh...  better late than never...<br />Finally they got it right.  Everything is cleaned up and restored,  even the objectionable stuff they excised out of the VHS remaster years before this release.  Plus extras galore with a triva quiz I believe ( I seem to remember being surprised at how little I got right on it, myself being a die-hard WHO fan...)<br />As I said before,  no collection is complete without this one.  The definitive Rockumentary!!!  Five Stars!!!

B00005A46T|4.0|I only got to track 12 (New Abortion), but this was awesome, especially compared to the debut. My advice is skip the intro, listen to 1-12, then program tracks 2,3,4,and 6 to repeat. They're awesome tracks among a quite decent record.
B000089RVX|1.0|i'll be completely honest and say that there is no good side to this piece of crap. linkin park is gay and kittie is gay too....put this \\"band\\" together and all you will get is a boat full of fecies....yes, i said fices, as in crap, poo, and dung! i liked bring me to life the first or secont time i heard it, but after that, i hated it....same with theyre new single \\"going under.\\" how many nu-metal bands ar useing this chlche of \\"oh im hated by people and i hate the world\\" bull crap? it is about time for a revolution in rock music, and this band WILL NOT be anywhere neer it. the bottom line is that whomever buys this garbage is wasteing theyre money on over played pansys with a chick lead singer so they dont look totaly gay, while they could buy the cd of the band that is busting they're balls (keyword: BALLS) to make it on radio because they have the passion, they have the talent, and most importantly they have something to say....this cd is horrible. THIS BAND WILL NOT BE ARROUND IN 3 YEARS I GAURENTEE IT!
B00005JLXE|1.0|I'm not really familiar with comic book superheroes. The only superheroes I can think of I've read about in comic books are SpaceMan Spiff and Stupendous Man from &quot;Calvin and Hobbes.&quot; I never got into Marvel Comics and that whole genre...I only read the funnies. With that in mind, I'm going to try to review the new movie &quot;Dare Devil.&quot; Bear in mind that I know practically nothing about the whole &quot;Dare Devil&quot; comic strip, and I don't know the background or anything like that. I went into the movie as a practically blank slate (except for my predisposition to not liking Ben Affleck). <br />The movie started out sort of interesting, with the opening credits starting out as Braille. I could easily see the irony of watching Braille on the screen as the opening for a movie about a blind man. The movie went downhill from there. <br />I flat out didn't really like this movie. Yes, there were a few funny one-liners that I found amusing but possibly offensive to blind people...but basically everything else about the movie I didn't like. I'll just list the things I didn't like first, and then list the thing(s) I did like so we'll end on a positive note. <br />The dialogue (which reminded me of Spiderman), was horribly cheesy. The acting matched the dialogue (though there were a few good performances mixed in the bunch). I'd have to say that Affleck actually did a half decent job with the character he was given, despite the skin-tight leather outfit he wore. <br />In action movies like this, generally the action is the redeeming part of the movie...the part that makes up for the poor dialogue and plot (I can't complain about the plot...it was based on the comic books...). Unfortunately, in this movie the action seemed to be direct copies of Spiderman...just a different outfit and Dare Devil had to do the same stunts without web...instead he used a cable that he could shoot out and retrieve at will. Basically the action was just your basic fluid CG action that defied gravity...and my attention span. The worst part of the fight scenes was the weird pseudo crucifixion scene in which &quot;Bullseye&quot; (played by Colin Ferrel...the same guy that plays the Detective in Minority Report), gets shot through both hands and stretches out his arm while in a large cathedral. Yeah, it was a little weird. <br />Walking back from the movie, the guy accompanying me (we'll call him &quot;Dan&quot; to allow anonymity) made several remarks on the simplicity of the soundtrack and how it really had no depth. I'm not the music diehard he is, but I agree that the music never really seemed to fit the scene...but the lyrics that I heard seemed to sort of fit (A few lines I caught included &quot;Open your eyes&quot; and &quot;Can't you see&quot; etc). I'd probably have to watch it again and pay more attention to that portion to give any real clues on what that was about (but I'd rather not see it again...).<br />I don't really want to give away the plot...but it does mostly fit into the plot of most superhero movies (good guys vs. bad...), and fits even closer into the plot of Spiderman (I guess Stan Lee wasn't as creative as we thought). Anyhow, I don't really want to complain about the movie anymore, so I'll mention the good point(s). <br />The good points: Ummmm...I thought it was really amusing that Joe Pantoliano played the reporter in the movie. I sort of enjoyed his character (he's Cipher from &quot;The Matrix&quot;). Also...KingPin was sort of interesting...I would never, ever, EVER fight that guy. Man, he was HUGE. I'm not sure whether that's a good point or not, but I had to make it. Oh...and the whiz bang special effects were neat-o. Basically, I walked out of the theater thinking that I had just enjoyed the movie. Then I realized I paid money to see it and I realized I really didn't enjoy it that much.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|thank you APC, everyone involved with APC, and the fans of APC. together we have made it possible to push our way through the flock of weak musicians that are finding their way to our eardrums by way of commercial, hit radio, and the bad taste of our peers. i live in a place where the best radio station is a classic rock station that would be better dubbed a southern rock station, with an income that doesn't provide too much extra money for the music i do like. 20 dollars, however, is totally worth squandering on the new APC album Thirteenth Step. It makes me a feel a little better about the world and the idiots in it knowing that there is a cd out like this.

B00000JCOV|2.0|Slipknot breaks out of the box running, with tracks 2-6 being flat out awesome. Then they break a couple legs. Nothing else on the album compares to the first 5 songs. Nothing.
0399103422|5.0|This is one of the greatest novels ever written. If you enjoy reading in the slightest bit, you'll love this book. Some of the greatest characters ever created in literature are right here in this book. Michael, Sonny, Freddie, and Vito Corleone, all amazing characters who are gentlemen as well as members of the Mafia. As the story unfolds, showing the nice college boy Michael Corleone trying to resist the Corleone Family, yet being pulled in him, you'll be right with him the whole time. In the very first part of the book, you'll be dying to learn more about the Corleone family and its past. Believe me, you won't put this book down until you've read the very last sentence of the very last page.
B00005JKZV|4.0|This movie was very different from FoTR, in many ways. First of all, the movie and book is mostly battle. The battle of Helm's deep is probably the focal point of the entire movie, so the movie is significantly more violent than the first. If you're faint at heart, and don't like seeing orcs die, then you might want to consider watching &quot;Bambi&quot; or something else instead. <br />The cinematography in the movie was...once again, astounding. One particular shot that runs in my mind is when Aragorn retraces the steps of Merry and Pippin...the flashbacks between Aragorn (present) and Pippin and Merry (past) are excellent. A few other notable shots include when Aragorn picks up the Lorien Leaf that the hobbits leave behind; when Aragorn walks through the double doors, and (this one is incredible) when Frodo attacks Samwise (watch his blade..this shot is incredible). Of course the landscapes and the battle scenes are great too, those are just a few particular shots that I remember. <br />There are several things that I really loved and enjoyed about the movie. I'll make a brief list of them here: <br />-The introduction starting outside the mountain hearing what is going on inside and then Gandalf falling/fighting the Balrog <BR>Grima Wormtongue. Perfect casting..you couldn't get any slimier than that!<BR>-The Wargs (though they sort of looked too cute...)<BR>-The ents...oh my..the Ents were spectacular.<BR>-The destruction of Isengard! I just wish they would have shown more of it. <BR>-The battle of Helm's deep. I know this is like half the movie...but it was great! <br />There were a few changes from the book, but I won't mention them (I don't want to spoil the movie too much). I'll back up every (almost) change that Jackson made...even what Jackson did to Faramir. <br />There weren't too many things I didn't like..but the first and foremost is probably the Entmoot...that is the one change that I think Jackson shouldn't have made. Also...we didn't get to see Treebeard's &quot;house.&quot; That was a shame. I really wanted to see the table and the Ent draught. I also didn't like the dwarf tossing joke (yes..*another* dwarf tossing joke...sheesh!) and I didn't like what Frodo saw in the Dead Marshes. <br />Peter Jackson (even he admits this), took more creative liberties with this movie than any of the Lord of the Rings films (released and unreleased). Knowing this before I saw the movie, I was a little worried. I figured he had cut something big out...or added something stupid in. But, in the end, I can appreciate almost all the changes he made (with the possible exception of the entmoot), and I think this movie was once again a winner! Thanks to everyone who made it! It was great!
B00008K9Z6|5.0|Meteora was amazing. I got it the first day it came out, and once I put the cd into my cd player, just hearing the foreward, I knew it was going to be perfect. The songs have a variety of different instruments such as violins etc.. and it's cool how they sort of connected all the songs so it's like one whole long song. The booklet impressed me the most. Every page was full of different designs all made/thought up of by the band. And beside the song lyrics, they'd have a little &quot;NOTE&quot; thing that tells you about information about the song. This is defnitely the best cd of the year.
B00009NOF4|1.0|Terrible Terrible Terrible. Makes you feel like there is no hope for mankind or at least this band, which is true.
B00000637V|3.0|There are a few albums that have some dreary songs I might recognize, but one that is so important, having the CD is the obvious way to get it.  &quot;Berlin&quot; starts with a small cafe, `Oh Honey' kind of song that might be a relief for people who can't rock hard all the time.  But this is a Lou Reed album, and the music starts pounding a bit more with, &quot;I said No No No, Oh Lady Day&quot; in the second song.  Then the songs start to sound better and even intellectually interesting.  &quot;Men of Good Fortune&quot; is a historical sociological study with a &quot;Me, I just don't care at all&quot; attitude, but with an inviting melody.  &quot;It takes money to make money, they say. . . . Anyway, makes no difference to me.&quot;  Schopenhauer fans ought to understand this attitude toward beauty.  When the music gets good, other elements of life might lose their significance.  This is not the most convincing song on the album.  Mostly it is a contrast between men of good fortune and men of poor beginnings who might mess things up just as much.<br />Pointy headed intellectuals spouting off on the obvious are sure to be the main grabbers of attention in the media which dominate a world in which every problem has an answer which is clear, direct, and wrong.  Rock 'n' roll is just as bad.  Lou Reed is a perfect example.  People who want to know what the music on this album is like might be typical, superfluous superficialities produced by a nation of shoppers in a world of global spectators.  &quot;Caroline Says&quot; is about some dramatic queen, with poor Lou Reed singing, &quot;But of course, I thought I could take it all.&quot;  Then she says she can't continue to be only mine, &quot;but she's still my queen.&quot;  I'm not rating the music very high on this song.<br />The song that makes this CD worthy, for me, is &quot;How Do You Think It Feels&quot; which asks, &quot;And when do you think it stops?&quot;  Popularity in the media is obtained by the ability to communicate feelings, but this song takes its feelings to extremes, &quot;when you've been up for five days.&quot;  Desire is the feeling that this song exudes, and lust seems to be the feeling that gets the biggest workout, as &quot;always make love by proxy&quot; must be about relying on the media for fulfilling fundamental desires.  Those of us who have devoted so much of our lives to evaluating the things a consumer society can offer ought to ask ourselves if Lou Reed gets out in front of our questions once in awhile by asking how we dare to evaluate so much that is fundamentally at loose ends.  &quot;Oh Jim&quot; might be a sincere attempt to supply some answer about how people are coping, or failing to cope.  The next song, another &quot;Caroline Says&quot; asserts &quot;This is a bum trip.&quot;  So she put her wrist through a window pane, it's so cold in Alaska.  There is razor that cuts a wrist in a later song, and you might not want to listen to anything that ends this way.  It must be &quot;The Bed,&quot; in which &quot;I said Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, what a feeling!&quot;  Then the song gets spooky.  This might be freaking people out before &quot;Sad Song&quot; at the end, which is a relief.communicate feelings, but this song takes its feelings to extremes, &quot;when you've been up for five days.&quot;  Desire is the feeling that this song exudes, and lust seems to be the feeling that gets the biggest workout, as &quot;always make love by proxy&quot; must be about relying on the media for fulfilling fundamental desires.

0780629450|5.0|I've seen several different screen adaptations of Shakespeare's Hamlet, and I can unequivocally state that Branagh's is my favorite. From start to finish, this four hour film stunned me with incredible acting, beautiful sets, and creative cinematography. However, the film didn't exactly match my original interpretation of the play. <br />Probably the greatest thing that disappointed me in the film was the play within the play. No matter how much I enjoyed the acting, I didn't like the interpretation that Branagh chose. After several readings of Hamlet, I still can't understand why Branagh chose to have Hamlet yell so much during the play. I suppose on one hand it reinforces the idea of Hamlet going mad, but it also seems to degrade the cunning that went into planning the play and the trap for Claudius. I always imagined that scene to be a little more subtle, working its way into the mind of Claudius and creating doubt...not screaming \\"bloody murder\\" the way Branagh seems to portray it. If I was directing this film, I would probably have Hamlet talk under his breath a little more and possibly brood in his seat, watching every move that Claudius makes. Luckily, this is probably the most major thing that confused and disappointed me about this film version (besides Rosencrantz and Guildenstern riding in on the little train). <br />Other than the play within the play, I think I agree with almost everything Branagh does, but a few of his choices stand out more than others for me. The thing that I liked the most about Branagh's version is Ophelia's falling into madness. I thought the way Ophelia carried on in the large, mirrored room was fantastic. The flowers being a construct of a deranged mind and her method of getting right into the face of Claudius was great! I thought Kate Winslet's acting was amazing. That certainly isn't the only thing I liked about it, but it is probably the thing that stood out the most to me. <br />I've seen this production several times, and Ieven own a copy on VHS, and the thing that I remember most about the movie is the indeterminate era in which it is set. From the sets and the costumes, it is very difficult to pin-point an exact date on this production. There are many seemingly modern devices in the palace, from Hamlet's fencing garb to the amazing mirrored rooms, but there isn't any electricity or computers. Branagh seems to be making the point that Hamlet is a timeless masterpiece and choosing a specific timeframe for the play puts it in a box, which is a point that I can't agree with more and is probably the most memorable part of the movie. <br />Overall, I enjoyed the Branagh production a lot. In fact, I've noticed that other movies often attempt to mimic this production! One recent example is the remarkable similarities of the sword fight in the most recent James Bond film: \\"Die Another Day\\" to Branagh's Hamlet. The fact that large film franchises are trying to mimic Branagh's work proves to me that his production is nothing short of spectacular and worth every minute of the four hours.
B000000OPZ|4.0|Whitesnake's self-titled album was one of the better ones of the hair metal era and it's easy to see why. Most of the songs have something positive to offer as lead singer David Coverdale and guitarist John Sykes molded Whitesnake from a classic rock band with a bluesy edge to a hard rock band which balanced songs based on memorable riffs with heartfelt power ballads with equal aplomb. And this album, while very good, is one of its era: very slick and tailor made for radio. Having said that, I do favor this album's versions of \\"Here I Go Again\\" and \\"Crying in the Rain\\" as they have a passion and energy that was lacking on the originals that were on the Saints & Sinners album. The aforementioned \\"Here I Go Again\\" and the ballad \\"Is This Love?\\" would became huge hit singles and deservedly so. \\"Still of the Night\\", while representative of Led Zeppelin, was a killer and songs like the riff heavy track \\"Bad Boys\\" and \\"Give Me All Your Love\\" were nearly as good. The closing ballad \\"Don't Turn Away\\" is another strong power ballad that was better than \\"Is This Love?\\" and would have been another hit single if released. The remaining tracks, \\"Children of the Night\\" and \\"Straight from the Heart\\", were okay but suffered from clich&eacute;d lyrics. All told, Whitesnake is a strong album that brings back a lot of memories and has a lot of great songs. Newcomers who want to hear them at their best might want to pick up Slide It In, an album with better songs overall and a sound that has aged more gracefully.
B00000720W|1.0|Now to start with, I am not at all against black metal music. It was until a very short time ago my favourite genre but I have NEVER had any time for this abjectly dismal effort.<br />Lets start with the woeful under produced drumming of Manheim. He sounds like he's has had one drumming lesson and has decided he's brilliant. I would say that one of the better ideas that Euronymous had was removing his useless bum from the drum stool and employing (the drum god) Hellhammer.<br />Maniac's vocals are hideous, not in that good Varg Vikerenes kind of way. They manage to render the entire 17 minutes of this MCD unlistenable (apart from the opening instrumental, which is funny).<br />Necrobutcher and Euronymous seem very much in the infancy of learning their instruments.<br />As for the songs, the title track excluded, there is not one worth bothering with, DeathCrush (The song) just about passes for music live these days.<br />I would like to also make the point that anyone who says this album is their favourite of all time must have the worst record collection in history possibly consisting of only 3 more CD's (all probably by Countess).<br />I have warned you.
0812550706|5.0|First of all, this is a very intelligent and sophisticated book. I have been reading the 1 star reviews, and have found that the reason they hate the book is because they say it is 'stupid and juvenile, only for dumb teenagers'. Allow me to object.<BR>Please accept the following statements:<BR>a) I am an intelligent teenager. <BR>b) I loved the entire Ender series.<BR>c) I found the series to be neither stupid nor juvenile.<br />You're going to have to take my word for statement a. <BR>It is true that while I would not reccomend this book to children, I very strongly suggest that teenagers and adults with an interest in SF, politics, military strategy, child geniuses or what the world might be like in a few hundred years read this book. If you only like flowery prose and metaphors and romantic plotlines, then the odds of your liking this book are not very good.
B000002KXO|3.0|After the bloated, experimental &quot;Tusk&quot; album the Mac get back to the Rumours sound, which was once again with mixed results but at the same time more uniform than the previous outing. <br />Although this album has its fair share of duds there are just as many songs that are fantastic and of Rumours caliber.   Stevie contributes a couple of her most memorable tracks with the potent &quot;Straight Back&quot; and the unforgettable hit single &quot;Gypsy.&quot;  Christine McVie is also in fine form (ever expect anything different from her?) with her jumpy, joyous &quot;Love In Store&quot; and her lovesick ballad &quot;Only Over You.&quot;  She also contributes the most memorable track from the album, which was the smash hit single &quot;Hold Me.&quot;  When that chorus hits it's like a ray of sunshine.  <br />Sadly, Mr. Buckingham misses the boat here, who contributes the worst tracks on the album.  They aren't just your average songs like the couple of less-than-stellar McVie and Nicks tracks here that are, they are completely agitating and you should program your CD accordingly to skip over them.  They are the bland &quot;Book Of Love,&quot; his annoying 50's pastiche &quot;Oh Diane&quot; and the just plain annoying &quot;Eyes Of The World.&quot;  They are a little less irritating than &quot;Not That Funny&quot; but not by much.  It should be noted that his other two tracks on the album are stellar.<br />If you're just getting into the band, start with one of their more consistant efforts like &quot;Mystery To Me&quot; or &quot;Rumours&quot; before you get this one.  If you already have a few Mac CD's you like this will be a good one to add to the collection.  Overall, the album isn't the best but the songs on it that are good are really good.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|Ok, here's how it is, I don't know why Amazon is only putting the bad reviews on top. ALL (not most, ALL) of the &quot;confirmed&quot; or &quot;in-depth&quot; articles/rumors on t.A.T.u. are based on tabloid reports. The one of them reportedly breaking upand having problems is from a tabloid talking to Lena's (fake) Grandma, who talks about their sex life... why would Lena tell her GRANDMA about her lesbian sex life???<br />Anyway, although a bit repetitive, this is a very nice CD. NOT kiddie porn, and not only owned by middle-aged men. The by-far best track is How Soon Is Now, crisp, melodious, and a great remake.<br />BTW, the alleged &quot;boyfriends&quot; they have been seen with, are the guys from the russian group Smash. All of them were past members of the child group Nesdeposi (forgot if that's the right spelling), all right?
B0000B3FCX|5.0|When I bought the cd, I was expecting a similar to Silver Side Up(their previous cd which I enjoyed very much). What I got blew me away. The music alone is more heavy(which I prefered), and when I listened to it for a second time, I found myself entranced by the lyrics. And whats best is that no two songs carry the same beat so you get a refreshing sound. Overral I believe this is their best work so far.
B000063DFN|5.0|The thing that made Iron Maiden great was that they wrote songs that no other band would touch. Bruce and Co. used such an amazing and wide range of influence on which to write about. Powerslave is the perfect example of this. We have fighter pilots during the Battle of Britian, a poem over 200 years old, and the misery of being a slave in ancient Egypt. I mean c'mon no one else did stuff like this. Well OK maybe once in a while like Metallica's Creeping Death, but no one did it as consistently or as successfully as Iron Maiden. Seriously, could you imagine Motley Crue, Twisted Sister, or Guns n Roses performing a song on which the subject was the execution of Marie Antoinette?<br />Powerslave was, as just about everyone here agrees, Iron Maiden's peak. `Live after Death' released after this album was perfect timing to show Maiden at their zenith both musically and as a live band. The show from the LA Forum is unbelievable. It could be argued as one of the greatest shows ever.<br />Powerslave is the fourth studio album by Iron Maiden, and everything fell into place. Losfer Words, may be the only weak point, but every Maiden album has a dud or two. However `Ace's High', `Powerslave', `Two Minutes to Midnight', and the epic \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner' more than make up for `The Dualist'.<br />Rime of the Ancient Mariner has always been and possibly always will be my favorite Maiden song. To see them perform it live was even more amazing. The story, the galloping bass lines, and twin guitar attack make The Mariner a must have in any metalheads collection. I was always disappointed that the band never had an Eddie portrait to go along with it. It would have been so cool to have a painting of Eddie on a ship with a crossbow in his hand and an albatross around his neck.
B00005JLSE|3.0|THE OLD GRAY GERE'S BACK TO WHAT HE USED TO BE!!!  In the late 1980s and early 1990s Richard Gere became the most successful gray haired leading man since Cary Grant with movies like INTERNAL AFFAIRS and PRETTY WOMAN, but then for some reason someone must have told him to die his hair brown in a series of flops like KING DAVID, CAPE FEAR, and UNFAITHFUL--which only made him look like an old man trying to look young--Richard Gere is back at the top of his game--with a terrific looking head of gray hair!--as Lawyer Billy Flynn in CHICAGO.  Not only does Gere look as good as ever, not only does Gere play a lawyer better than most lawyers play lawyers, but Richard Gere steals the show in CHICAGO with his scenes with Renee Zellweger, especially in one on a stage where he has her on his lap like a puppet, with himself as the puppeteer!!!<br />    Renee Zellweger is terrific as the out of step female she always plays, Catherine Zeta-Jones is a surprise as a singer and dancer, and Queen Latifah is Queen Latifah, but it's Richard Gere who makes this slow musical better than average.<br />    THE OLD GRAY GERE'S BACK TO WHAT HE USED TO BE!!!<br />                         Chari Krishnan RESEARHCKING

B00006CXXU|3.0|Christina's 2nd attempt at her music career brings out a lot of interesting elements.  Good lyric writing, good formated songs, but, not always the best.<br />1. Intro- Unrated<br />2. Can't Hold Us Down feat. Lil Kim- Cool song.  One C.A.'s never done before.  Very unique.  The lyrics are a little repetitive in some cases, but the song is an obviuos single.  *Stand out track* 4.5/5<br />3. Walk Away- I think that this is one of the best ballads on the album.  Its very laid back and haunting.  Very cool, not a single however. 4/5<br />4. Fighter- My favorite of the tracks.  This is another stand out track being the only rockish song on the album.  Everything in the song falls into place very easily. 4.5/5<br />5. SKIT- NOT RATED<br />6. Infatuation- Cool beat.  This song is one that will make you want to dance.  I am a little fond of it, but, its not a single. 3.5/5<br />7. Loving Me For Me- SKIT- NOT RATED<br />8. Loving Me For Me- The lyrics spark intrest, but, the song is boring.  I dont think you will like it.  Its a &quot;filler&quot; track. 2/5<br />9. Impossible feat. Alishia Keys- Alright track.  It is another stand out track, but, not a single.  I think that this is a kind of music Christina shoul stay away from.  Not that bad, Not that great. 3/5<br />10. Underappreciated- The only thing I can think of to describe this track is, stupid.  Its so dumb that its mind filling.  You wont like this track.  Another album filler. 2.5/5<br />11. Beautiful- I used to like this track.  It was cool, but it got old real quick.  You will probably like it, for the first couple times around.  Then, it gets old. 3.5/5<br />12. Make Over- This is an alright track.  It barely stands out amongst the entire album.  I like it, but, its not a single.  You might like it if you like upbeat, rockish type tracks. 3/5<br />13. Cruz- This and Soar kind of blend in with each other.  I wouldnt call this a single, and i wouldnt listen to it over and over again.  Not too stunning. 3/5<br />14. Soar- I like this better than Cruz, but, still not to great.  Its alright, but, again, not a single.  3.5/5<br />15- Get Mine Get Yours- I like this track.  Its seducing, and it stands out amongst the upper album tracks.  Its a good dance track. 4/5<br />16-  Dirrty- I love this song, thats why I bought the album.  You probably have heard it.  I let you decide if you like it or not.  5/5<br />17- Stripped 2- SKIT- NOT RATED<br />18- The Voice Within- This isnt that bad of a track.  Its lyrics are a little like Soar, but i like it.  Its very laid back and mellow, and i love the middle part of the sing.  3.5/5<br />19- Im O.K.- This is a haunting song, and i think it will grab your attention, if you can make it this far through the album.  The song is slow, chilling, and magnificent.  I like the song. The lyric content is very strong as well.4/5<br />20- Singing My Song- Awful.   I wish she would stop singing this song.  Its what, 6 min. long, and its so boring it will put you to sleep.  Dont listen to it in your car, it will cause narcelepsy (NOT REALLY, ITS AN EXAGGERATION)  Not cool, very stupid, and not worth the time.<BR>1.5/5
B000063COX|5.0|This is album that started it all. Paul Dianno was the original Maiden frontman and though Bruce Dickenson is a better singer by leaps and bounds, I could not think of anyone but Paul singing on this album. When Paul sang, Iron Maiden sounded much more brutal, like a biker gang or hardened criminals. It's a shame `Women in Uniform' never made it onto this disc. But at any rate this was a great debut by one of metal's all time best and most popular bands. The classics are here like the title track, `Sanctuary', and `Runnin' Free'. Also check out the all but forgotten gem written by Dave Murray `Charlotte the Harlotte'. Lift up a pint and remember those great days when the New Wave of British Metal Invasion first began.
B00000K0E5|4.0|In 1995, action fans rejoiced.  James Bond was back and just as fun as ever in GOLDENEYE.  This time around, 007, played by Pierce Brosnan, is filled with shame over the death of his counterpart 006 (Sean Bean), believing he was responsible for 006's demise.  Suddenly Bond is wisked into a war involving a stolen Russian missile launcher named Goldeneye, meanwhile being pitted once again against the Russian general (Gottfried John) that killed 006.  Brosnan is arguably the greatest thing to happen to Bond since Roger Moore; he's every Bond in one, combining Sean Connery's strategy with Roger Moore's humor, George Lazenby's human side with Timothy Dalton's dark side.  Brosnan is truly what the Bond franchise was looking for.  The film also features a very nice score by Eric Serra; adventurous directing by Martin Campbell; and an action-packed script by Jeffrey Caine & Bruce Feirsten which also features plenty of humor.  GOLDENEYE goes beyond the standard Bond flick, and ranks highly among the most entertaining well through it's 130 minutes; action/Bond fans will not be disappointed!<br />END TITLE: May not be gold, but action fans won't want to miss it
0385504209|4.0|Once again, Dan Brown has spun a great story with lots of twists and turns.<br />It was hard to believe that Langdon's friend Tebring was actually playing the other side of the line.  I never would have guessed it.<br />I wasn't sure initially about Sophie at the beginning (and neither, I might add, was Robert), but she turned out to be a &quot;very cool customer&quot;.  She knows her job, does it well, and manages to stay personal and emotional throughout the book.<br />I definitely recommend this book to anyone.
B000000HZT|4.0|Not much to say about this albums brilliance except that the nut who thought that Kim Beacon was the sad element on this album probably needs a labotomy, their ears syringed or get a new brain. Kims vocal is as close as you can get to being soul without being black. My single criticism would be a general lack of punch throughout.
B00006L90T|5.0|Carnival of Souls aka &quot;Corridors of Evil&quot;, is a crowning jewel in American Cinema. Despite the low budget and poor film quality, this 1962 masterpiece stands as a cult more than 40 years after it's release. Candice Hilligoss' fine performance will overwhelm you as she portrays a character caught in a purgatory between life and death. Her beauty alone will strike the viewer in a way few actresses can. Her physical acting, facial gestures, and line delivery will leave you wondering why this woman did not become a household name like Marilyn Monroe or Raquel Welch.<br />The story is as simple as it is complex. A woman is an innocent passenger in a car that gets into a drag race with some teenage thugs. The result is her car going over a bridge into a fast running, sandy river. As she crawls out of the wreckage covered in mud, the viewer thinks she has survived, but has she?<br />Ms. Hilligoss' character is a musician, an organist to be exact who takes a job as a church organist in Salt Lake City, Utah. As she begins her journey she is terrified of images of a phantom of sorts who seems to be seeking her out. Anyone who has driven for an average of twelve hours straight can tell you that driving can take its toll, and the mind can play tricks on a sleepy driver. However, after she checks into her room, she finds the same phantom lurking in the window, then in the hallway. Who is this creature, what does he want, where is he from?<br />The main point of the film is not horror, but human nature. Are we all alone in this world? Is everyone an island unto themselves. The lesson is thrown upon our character by a minister, a psychologist, and a would be male suitor. They all try to help her in their own way (except the suitor who is only interested in her for a chance to have sex). But our character waves a hand at them all, convinced that she can do it her own way. She is an independent woman who needs no man or companionship; a view that may have gone against society's thinking in 1962.<br />The male suitor (or 'just your normal guy' as he likes to call himself) is an obnoxious oaf to say the least. His headstrong pursuit of her is only his own selfish desire to have her. He's not an alcoholic he claims, yet he drinks at dawn. He quit college because he doesn't like to learn. This is not an ideal resume for a long term relationship for her or any other woman. When she is truly frightened by the visiting spectre, and she reaches out to him as a last resort for help, he runs. Not wanting to get involved, he was only interested in her for her body and his own sexual desire. Yet another lesson in this film for all the young ladies who care to pay attention.<br />As the story goes on Candace's soul seems to deteriorate. She slips in and out of reality and a strange sort of parallel world. This dimension looks the same as real life, but she cannot be seen or heard. The department store dressing room for example, shows how the lost spirit must learn that she is no longer of this world, but now belongs in the spirit world, where yet another companion awaits her.<br />Who is this man that haunts her in visions? We see at the end of the film that they are to be together forever. In the final seen where we see Candace's peek at her after-life. She screams in horror as the ghosts dance eternally as the haunt the carnival. She is finally captured by the ghosts and is spirited away. The police and minister are confused and baffled as her footprints and final body print leads nowhere. The minister gives a knowing look as if he has known all along, but says nothing.<br />The minister must have known there was something wrong with his new organist when he first met and eventually fired her. She had not the soul of a musician, she only had a knowledge for music. She was told this too by the organ builder in the beginning of the film. When she is possessed in the church and her true musician ship comes out as she plays without control, that isher true spirit, but the misinster fires her for 'blasphony'.<br />This film cannot be watched once and dismissed. It deserves to be watched over and over again. It is a timeless movie where something seems new every time you watch it. I applaud you 'Carnival of Souls'.

B000002B30|2.0|Although this is a greatest hits collection, Bruce always poses a problem for compilations of this kind.  Namely, his songs are alost universally better live.  And his &quot;Hits&quot; are not close to his Greatest songs.  <BR>There are exceptions:  Thunder Road, Born to Run The River come to mind immediately.  But this leaves out too many of his staple great songs to be worth a purchase.  If this is your only Bruce purchase, your understanding of his music and why his fans are who they are will never come to be.  Without Rosie, Jungleland, Sandy, Incident, and others, you are missing the Bruce mythos.<BR>Spend more money, go buy Live 1975-85, or buy Live in New York City.  You will get a better overall picture of The Boss, and those albums are just magical.
B000002KHH|5.0|Without a doubt, this album can lay claim to the `Granddaddy of all Metal' albums. While their debut `Black Sabbath' was excellent, it was much more blues oriented. `Paranoid' however is darker, heavier, and has riffs that are a must to learn for all rock guitarists. Can anyone imagine the metal world without the songs `War Pigs', `Paranoid' or `Iron Man'? This is where metal began folks. Tony Iommi is a true master when it comes to writing heavy riffs. Considering the fact that the man has no fingertips and cannot feel the strings is even more amazing. For those who do not know, Tony suffered an accident while working in a factory, resulting in the loss of his fingertips. He plays with plastic coverings. That's why in most photos, he usually hides his hand.<br />Anyway, `Hand of Doom', `Electric Funeral', and the infamous `Fairies wear Boots' (what were they smoking when they wrote that one?), even the album out to make it a listening pleasure. I never understood what the heck `Luke's Wall' was though. There is nothing between War Pigs and Paranoid. And to this day I still have no idea what Ozzy is singing about in Planet Caravan. I could find the lyrics, but that would take away from the mystery of the song. Geezer's bass playing is top notch on this disc. His is probably the most under-rated bass player on the planet. Ozzy's vocals are haunting and lurk behind the music just enough to make the patented Black Sabbath sound.<br />I still remember being broke and living on my own for the first time. Without a TV, I would just play `Paranoid' over and over again playing solitare on the floor. I would eat cold cuts without bread and wait for my girlfriend to come over, she rarely did. Those were some great times though. This is one of Black Sabbath's and Heavy metal's best albums. It's the Holy Grail for guitar players and will be a jewel in your CD collection.
B00008MNYS|5.0|I have never bought a cd of Robbie Williams, but I completely fall in love with his single \\"Feel\\", so I decided to take de risk. I must admit that I absolutely LOVE \\"Escapology\\" it's a great album. I used to think that he didn't have a good voice, but all of that change when I heard \\"Angels\\", and even then I did not purchase the album \\"Ego has Landed\\", that song (Angels) really open a new window for me to his music. \\"Escapology\\" is a must have, it is different from what others pop singers offer. Buy this album it won't disappoint you. I must have heard it a million times!!! My favorites are \\"Feel\\" (of course!!!!), \\"Come Undone\\", \\"Something Beautiful\\", \\"Monsoon\\", among others equally well written. Now I am going to buy his previews albums and really enjoyed his amazing talent!!!

0060523794|4.0|Some books sweep you off the feet by their accurate narration of larger-than-life issues and of the results that sweep people off their feet... This book is in the same league, and does a lot if you are blessed with a lot of imagination... Organized into five parts: (1) Gerstner's beginnings at IBM, (2) Strategy, (3) Culture, (4) Lessons Learned, and (5) Observations, the book is a racy description of IBM's flirt with history-rubbish, and of the slow and painful recovery. Spanning IBM's history from 1992 to 2001, the book provides a perfect view from the hot-seat and is especially relevant if you are aspiring to become a CEO of a fortune 500 company.  The last section contains Gerstner's views on society, industry etc, and provides an even better glimpse of the man himself. The book is especially relevant if one wants to understand the IT industry and the source of all its problems and virtues, but only to a certain extent. The insights are available in bits and pieces only, and one has to connect the dots oneself. Another problem with the book is that the thoughts in various places aren't really fully developed, and one has to look someplace else for all the answers. `Big Blues, the Unmaking of IBM (by Paul Carroll, Jim Wade) provides a much better description of the firm, is what I think. <br />Overall, it's a good buy, and will make for a good weekend read.
B000092ZYX|3.0|Overall, not that great and kind of hard to listen to in spots.  However, There There (Track 9) is one of the best things they've ever recorded and the best song on this disc by miles.
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I don't care what others negative thoughts are about the group t.A.T.u. The truth is, they are different? I mean come on how many other artists have two girls singing together, with totally different personalities, singing these songs in which some dont' make entirely any sense? The truth is I don't want to see any other little Britney's, or Christina Aguilera's. That's just the view from Americans and t.A.T.u. is unique, and they have something different that other artists don't. That is why I like there music...Secondly who says in the year 2010 we won't be listening to chipmunks? Things change in time.
0790736233|3.0|Contact was a film that interested me from the get go.  I loved the idea, and I guess I still do: a chance to make contact with Alien life and making it come across as real.  There is no question that this film provides a realness, an authenticity of plot mixed in with good acting.  What Contact lacks however is some contact with originality and general audience appeal and satisfaction.  Now what in the world did I just say?  Well let's analyze this movie:<br />Arroway played by the supberb actress Jodie Foster is a scientist who goes out of her way to be the first to make contact with recent Alien life that eventually becomes national, meaning it becomes obvious to the public.  Now two good things here that I liked:<br />1. It pretty much avoided the cliche of the big \\"government conspiracy\\" that so many sci-fi films feel they must have (until the end).  The government and public are just as surprised by the sudden alien contact as any one else.<BR>2. You don't get to see Aliens, they are left up to the viewers imagination.  Another words, you don't know what this out of space life is.  This maintains interest and suspense.<br />Now, here's where it lacks originality.  Arroway is not an original character.  She's a scientist, a believer in new life out there, explorer, etc.  This is the character \\"we\\" as the audience would expect to be the main character.  Although it may be what we expect, that doesn't make it original.  What makes Close Encounters of the Third Kind better is that the main characters were ordinary people, with no expertise, learning and changing and developing as the film progresses.  Arroway changes hardly at all, because practically the film is about everything changing for HER.  Everything opens up to her from opportunities to beliefs.  We don't sympathize with her because she doesn't grow, only the plot grows around her.  And it should be the other way around.  <br />Another cliche is Skerritt's death.  I'm sorry, you knew that was going to happen.  You knew some accident was going to take place to keep him from going up so Arroway could go in his place.  This plot is good, but it is at the same time predictable.  And because it's predictable, some of suspense goes down the drain.<br />Now the worst of all worst cliches in the movie is when she makes actual \\"contact\\" with a being that's in the shape of her father.  How utterly stupid.  How many films have I seen now that have this?  Visited by an image of her father, a ghost like figure, so many films do this.  They have to ruin this film by making the \\"contact\\" turning out to be a relative of hers.  There is no satisfaction to this, all the suspense during the whole film of wanting to know WHAT is trying to make contact is answered by adaptation of her father?!  What a waste.<br />That costed it one star, the cliches and the wasted suspense of this movie.  What costed it another star was that I really did not like the political/religious bias and slams and cliches in this movie.  I'm sure Athiests love this movie, because religion is dissed big time in this.  Half this movie was not about the contact from another life form, but rather the struggle between theoretical differences (Athiests vs. Religion).  This did create drama and friction between characters such as between Arroway and Palmer (Matthew McC.).  However, it came across as if this film had another objective in mind.  As if it was on a mission to show up religions and make it appear as if \\"religion is the doorstopper in progression.\\"  <br />I'm not the only one who thinks this, who was a little offended by how someone who believes in God is represented.  Sorry, Palmer didn't make a very convincing religious person.  He basically shies away from Arroway when the topic comes up, as if \\"he knows she's right.\\"  And naturally for villains, the director has it be these religious wackos.  Then when Arroway is being interviewed by world leaders, they make it appear as if she's being persecuted for not having a religious belief.<br />Again, these are all slams and cliches against religion, and some of us like to see better representation in movies if it's going to be an essential element of the movie.  Not that the issue has to be ignored in movies, but create a balance not a bias.  Otherwise, leave the subject alone if you can't accurately or fairly represent the other side.  Because quite clearly there was an anti-religious agenda in this movie and I felt it uncalled for.<br />Other than the biasness and the lack of originality in climax and character, this film has a good storyline.  It has great acting, it is a very believable film.  And if not for these blackmarks, I would've considered among my top favorite sci-fi films.  But the director made a classic mistake in dividing the audience by slamming a belief system rather than telling a story without the anti-spiritual agenda.<br />Grade: C
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This cd is not what i expected. I loved the first perfect circle cd and almost all of tool's work. This cd is unlike any of it. I was really kinda upset when i popped it in my cd player and listened to it. It wasn't what i expected but by the third listen i knew it was a special body of work. If you listen to the radio these days you will hear mostly crap and this is a refreshing change. Wonderful lyrics and melodic music, much better than any of the rock radio mainstays such as Cold, Staind, or any of the other commercial metal bands.
B00009V7RF|5.0|Oh my god! What some reviewers wrote here made me wonder how stupid and narrow-minded one can get. So, in your opinion, &quot;Let's get retarded&quot; is offensive to disabled people? Yeah, sure. This is just a goddamn party song, great in deliberately being silly, just a freak-out-and-sing-along type of  rap/funk-track!!! NO ONES TRYING TO OFFEND ANYBODY HERE!!! If you think different, then... you're just narrow-minded and probably haven't really laughed for half your life.<BR>Apart from that, this record is fantastic in bringin a lot of upbeat, funk and party tunes, yet managing to make them all different and in their own way enjoyable. And this comes from a long time BEP fan. All you screamin for &quot;real hip hop&quot; (geez, I hate that expression) don't understand what this is about. BEP bring the funk and the fun back into hip hop, and you should be grateful.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Great cd and ill recommend it to anyone who loves rock music, but i will probably recommend white blood cells and the rest of thier cds before this one. Great cd, should be bought for seven nation army alone.
B00005N9CV|5.0|After the first listen to this album, I was a goner.  It was on a romantic weekend with my wife, and the luxury hotel we stayed at had put the disc in the room, a wise choice for both their business and the guest's contentment.  The fluid, sensual flow of Diana's croon sweeps you up, gently massages away thoughts of the hard world of concrete and clocks, melts your anxieties and woes, and lulls you on its gentle, swaying stream of steamy, lush vocal waters into a soft and sultry place in your heart.  One classic song after another is made fresh, each one so delicious that at the end you're thinking, &quot;More, I want more.&quot;  The only possible complaint about this disc is that is finally does come to an end.  After the last smooth, lazy note has stopped vibrating in your mind, your next thought is &quot;I hope she has more albums.&quot;  Luckily, there are some -- and I made sure I got them too.  This album is a charmer, a favorite, a &quot;can't-possibly-go-wrong&quot; musical purchase, an enduring pleasure, and a classic in its own right.
B00005JLYW|5.0|Hey, being a guy, what more can you ask for in a movie?  Hot chicks, hot action, corny humor, and some more hot chicks.  I agree, like the first one the story and the acting isn't award winning or anything, but the fun part is always there.  So if anyone wants to buy the movie, I would recommend it.  However, do not buy it thinking it's great movie that'll be talked about 50 years from now.  Buy it as a movie that can be watched over and over again just for fun.
B000002UDD|5.0|Let's face it--if you are going to listen to Megadeth, you are already slumming it, heh?  That said, you could do worse than this CD.  This CD is the shortest, fastest that MD ever produced.  All of the others (even the earlier efforts, which suffer from poorer production) are a little heavier and slower.  That emphasis on crunch and not speed tends to make things sound more pretentious and similar to the other bands of this era (Overkill, Exodous, etc.)<br />&quot;So Far...&quot; is, however, their most consistent swipe at brillance.  The album sprints by at a breakneck speed and doesn't lag for a minute.  This is as good an example of 80s metal as Slayer's &quot;Reign in Blood.&quot;  No, Megadeth doesn't make &quot;serious music&quot; in any critical sense--that's why these other reviews sling a little mud at this disc.  What they do make is quick and angry metal tunes that are custom-engineered for driving or weightlifting.  Considering this, &quot;So Far...&quot; is one of the best cheap thrills you'll find the next time your girl leaves you alone and you want to slum it.  Guaranteed.
B000002L68|3.0|I know i just commited some kind of musical sin for giving this album 3 stars but i promise i can back it up! All in all this is a very promising album filled with lots of potential.But Face it this was a Comercial Album for a Comercial Film. The only reason it did well because it was showing prince as rather \\"Macho\\" since everyone thought he was \\"Gay\\" But if you look at the facts Prince has Done Much more promising stuff then this. In paticular 1999! but lets break it down the key tracks on this album were \\"lets go Crazy\\", \\"Take me with you\\" probably the only songs that were ground breaking in my opinion including when does cry which is very impressive since it doesent even have a bass musical line. He goes a bit far with his messianic messege in the beautiful ones. Darling Nikki is just a weak version of Little Red Corvette. All in all if your a REal prince fan get this. but if your new to prince and wan't to hear what he is really made off check out 1999 or Sign \\"o\\" the times cause im sorry this isnt prince at his best or try a compilation album.
0385504209|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.<br />I was done in less than two days.<br />I liked the chapter being short as one has to cook and tend to the kids as well.<br />It is amazing what da Vinci left behind. It is amazing what this novel reveals.<br />One is tempted to stop the read and start doing research immediately .If there is only half of the facts described real facts, it is simply unbelievable.<br />I am debating to give up another weekend for another Dan Brown.
B000063Y8F|5.0|[[VIDEOID:16819321]]I've had a Zeiss, which is probably the simplest, but the hinges are weak, and a Henckels which is cool because it has two strainers (but then I only use the larger holed one) and then I gave this one to my mother. It beats mine hands down. The double action hinge has better leverage, the basket is easy to clean, it's all one piece, so no fishing around in the junk drawer for the basket. Top of of the line with a price to match. I would recommend still peeling the cloves though, it makes it easier to use.<br /><br />Here is a short video using it to press out a single clove of garlic. Notice how easy it is to flip open and clean out. You still have to scrape the garlic off but it's easy. Essential? No, you can always mince your garlic with a good chef's knife, but this is way faster. Would make a good gift.
B00005JLKB|5.0|This the best thing that could have happend I love smallville we dont have the WB here in Alaska so I am happy that they have finally it on DVD. I use to watch this all the time when I was stationed in the lower 48 but I cant wait fot the second season to come out now thanks Amazon.
B00008EY9G|4.0|I completely loved this movie! As the movie progressed, I loved how so many things connected.<br />I have been to the message boards for this movie and it is apparent that many people don't get the movie or are upset by the numbering of characters (have to see the movie)... this is all easily explainable in my opinion. I think the concept of what is really going on allows there to be descrepencies in the numbering... when watching this movie remember some of the people might not be important enough to have made themselves known.<br />The ending to this movie while almost perfect was disappointing in the sense that you expected a hero or heroine, but you might not get exactly what you expected.<br />Also the movie lets you in on what is really going on a bit too early for me... I kind of hoped they had waited for the very end to let you know what was really happening... I don't know how they could do that but they should have tried. I can't say anymore... watch it!<br />Oh, if you get the special addition with the alternate ending... FYI.. NO alternate ending. They extended a few things with the killings at the end... in total it probably makes for an extra fews seconds (literally).... you can watch the Theatrical Version but I watched the other just to see these extra few seconds.... I watched the endings to both versions and didn't notice the difference.... pay attention to who is doing the killing. And yes the &quot;different endings&quot; will be disappointing... but the movie wasn't.
0425173739|4.0|Death on the Nile was not Christe's finest work, or her most well crafted. The murder itself was wonderfully done, but the method in which  the aforesaid murder was rather unlikely. The engineering of such a plan as the murder(s) carried out was not something a normal person, or, for that matter, most any person would be able to do effectively. Few, if any, human beings would have the mental stamina necessary to carry out murders. Several things were done by the murderer(s) that normal human beings are simply not capable of. I cannot give examples here without breaking to the reader the end of the novel, but I will say that such events as take place in the novel are hardly likely in the real world.
B000001F9E|5.0|This is Lizzy at Their Best!
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Well, being a maiden fan from the early eighties, I'm always curious about a new offering. I generally disliked anything without Adrian and Bruce, so their coming back to the fold of the band was fabulous. I think this is an excellent album. They are trying some new things while still being distinctly Maiden. The sound is great and they've done a great job splitting up the guitars to allow the fans to hear them seperately. Moreover, once again, Adrian Smith proves himself to be the secret weapon in this band. Bruce sounds great. I give it four stars for the cheesy album cover and the repetitiveness of some of the lyrics on the choruses i.e. No More Lies. A great song, but I don't really know why they say the title ad nauseum. Highlights in my opinion are many, but I like Wildest Dreams (fun song, great riffs), Paschendale, Montsegur, and New Frontier. Like I said, it's a great album with lots of enthusiasm and FOR ONCE IN A LONG TIME, it sounds fresh and new. A great job by a great band!
B00005JKC3|2.0|Maybe the hype for this movie was too large, because I was expecting to see the best movie of the summer.  This movie however, did not come anywhere close to reaching this plateau.  The beginning immediately grabbed my attention but as the film grew longer I began to wonder if the movie would ever end.  The film was just entirely too long.  Great action scenes can only get you so far in Hollywood, and in this movie, it just wasn't far enough.  However, I thought the actor selections for Bruce and David Banner were a perfect fit for the film.  I also thought that the action scenes were amazing, but you can only take so much of a giant green freak jumping around in the desert.  I can even remember saying to myself, \\"catch and kill him already, please!.\\"  This however was not the case, and The Hulk seemed to jump and jump and jump and jump.  The reason people love comic books so much is because they are a quick and entertaining read.  The director Ang Lee should have taken this into consideration when he decided to recreate The Hulk.  Unless your looking for a huge adrenaline rush followed by the best nap you will ever have, I wouldn't suggest to see this dud.
0670032506|5.0|No, it's not one more planner, organizer, PDA or assistant that will rescue you from the chaos of your mind.  It's David Allen.<br />He clearly leads the reader to understand the thinking behind the organizing, the process before the processing, that is required to maximize effectiveness and creativity.  Once I grasped the underlying concepts and began to implement them , I got right to work with a clearer head and a more relaxed body.  What immediate benefits! <br />Not only are David Allen's principles and insights invaluable, he writes in a style that demonstrates his love of language.  So, two things in one when you buy this book--a good read and all you need to turn up your creativity and effectiveness.<br />As my company is called Optimize! Life Now, this book will be on my recommended reading list for my audiences and seminar participants.  My coaching clients will definitely benefit from my having read this book and David's other, Getting Things Done.
B0000062Y2|3.0|Jesus Christ Superstar is definitely one of the greatests musical masterpieces of modern times. It is a Must-have for any appreciator of good music. The question is not whether to buy GCS or not; rather, it is: <br />Which version of GCS is most worth buying?<br />This is very hard to answer, since each cast has its own beauty. JCS-appreciators must have as many versions as possible.<BR>This is what I recommend to the connoiseur. To the general public, my advice is to listen to the Original Cast first. In what follows, I present a short comparison of these two (mostly well known) versions.<br />As an accomplished speciallist and connoiseur of JCS, I would rather recommend the Original Cast (Gillan/Head) than this version. From musical point of view, it is certainly better: the sound quality in the Soundtrack album is by far not the best.<br />In my opinion, Jewison's film is too commercial. Ted Neeley sings in a much too pathetic manner, and this is somewhat annoying. Although I like his performance, I claim, in contrast with many other reviewers, that he is not at all suitable for the role of Jesus of Nazareth -- at least from musical point of view. Rather, Ian Gillan's interpretation of Jesus is much more original. Considering, in addition, the richness of his voice, he is the ideal Jesus.<br />Both Carl Anderson and Murray Head have great voices -- everyone accepts this. Anderson sings even more attractively in some places. Murray's interpretational skills, however, are unique. It is Head that set the standarts for a good Judas.<br />Yvonne Elliman (Mary Magdalene) and Barry Dennen (Pontious Pilate) participate in both casts. In my opinion, their performance in the Soundtrack album is even more powerful. However, the obvious difference in the sound quality, together (most of all) with the better rendition of the leading roles in the case of the Original Cast, would definitely make me recommend the Original Cast. My advice for the general public is: listen to theOriginal cast first; if you like it, then buy this version, and/or the Broadway cast.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Just when I thought music had really died, an album of this caliber comes along. From beginning to end, Elephant is full of great lyrics and music. If everyone had this album, the world would be a better place!
B000088E6D|5.0|Wow!  That is how I felt after leaving his Long Island show last night!  The CD is awesome but in person, he blows all the other new &quot;crooners&quot; out of the water! I have been to many jazz concerts that literally put you to sleep.  But, Michael Buble is outgoing and appreciative and funny!  Plus, the eight young hot studs backing him up were so talented.  I cannot wait for the next CD!!!  I now know what it was like for my Mom back in the 50's when she swooned over Sinatra and Darin and Anka!!
0345428064|4.0|Andy McNab's Nick-the-SAS-guy character makes an impact with Remote Control. It's obviously an earlier Nick, and written by an obviously less-experienced Andy McNab, but it's chock-full of tradecraft and suspense. I started reading this series with Crisis Four, the second most recent book, and decided that I enjoyed it enough to go back in time.
B0000B3FCX|5.0|I really liked Silver Side Up, but this CD is so much better.  The guitar, bass and drums all really stand out on all of the tracks, especially Because of You! Awesome! Just try to listen to that song and sit still!  But my favorite is Figured You Out, great lyrics.  And trust me it is difficult to pick a favorite song out on this.  This is just a great &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot;...real rock &amp; roll CD! This is a CD that you DON'T download!  Why?  Because it is that good!  They did such an awesome job on this, it really deserves and is worth every penny that you pay for it. I hope that makes sense.  And I am so picky when it comes to music, but this is truly a great CD!  This is a little harder than Silver Side Up! If you ever wondered if Rock and Roll still existed, buy this CD!  I am serious EVERY song is really good!  Don't download it, this is not crap, it will be money well spent!  They deserve it for this masterpiece!
0385493622|5.0|Didatic, calm, interesting, complete, all these are some of the adjectives regarding Singh's style of writing. If all math teachers were like him - or at least the like the way he wrote \\"Fermat's enigma\\" - many more little kids would be interested in math.<br />Fermat's last theorem is, to math, what the holly Grail is to christians. To prove that a seemingly simple equation, x^n + y^n = z^n has no solution if n&gt;2. Before dying, Fermat wrote on the margins of a book: \\"I have reached an amazing demonstration, but there's not enough space in this page for me to paste it here!\\" This irritating, carelessly written note has been the nightmare of mathematicians for the last 350 years.<br />In this book, Singh tells how Andrew Wiles finally demonstrated that Fermat was right, but, more than that, Singht throws in a very concise but utterly interesting history of math, from Pytagoras to the newest techniques of the XXth century. Singh uses very little math-talk, and sometimes that made me feel there was something missing. I wanted to fully understand how Wiles broke up Fermat's enigma, but, of course, Singh is the wise one and I'm the dumb one, because very few people alive are able to completely understand this level of mathematics. Wiles' final report on the solution is 200 pages long and deals with much more than simple numbers.<br />This book is the best math lesson I've ever had, and I recommend it to everybody who wants to have a wider horizon on various subjects.<br />Grade 9.4/10
B00008PBZW|1.0|Like many of the reviewers here, I did not like this movie. When the Navajo Code was declassified, I was eager to learn more about these unsung heroes of WWII. When this movie came out, I was just as eager to see it but when I finally did, I didn't even finish watching it. I was so disgusted about how the movie was advertised to be about the Navajo, but instead it concentrated on the two &quot;stars&quot; of the movie. <BR>Sure the movie could have been good if it weren't for the lopsided advertising.
0393057658|3.0|The author's contempt for traditional baseball wisdom and leadership and his hero worship of Billy Bean the GM of the Oakland team distorts the few insights the book offers. Sure there is far too much \\"conventional wisdom\\" and old-time, seat of the pants flying in the game. And what game doesn't have that? The stock market? The attribution of genius to the number crunchers who figured out that on base percentage was more important than batting average and the few other items of this nature certainly doesn't justify a book. In many cases the author grudgingly admits that a lot of people had kind of figured these things out anyway - like that luck plays a big part in any single game's outcome. The liner right at the first baseman, the bloop single... Casey Stengel and Connie Mack knew that. <br />The book is also disfigured by a certain intellectual snobbery. The new age wizards are all from Yale or Harvard it seems. If you want to irritate baseball people that's a good way to start. The story about the release of a veteran player days before he qualifies for a pension by the hero Billy Bean is mentioned coldly, factually. One can't tell whether this is to illustrate Billy's admirable ruthlessness in pursuit of victory or his bad side which the author couldn't quite condemn out of gratefulness at being allowed inside the clubhouse. It could make a non-A's fan hope they lose.<br />The book also has page after page of \\"filler\\" anecdotal stories about ballplayers which I enjoy as an old-time fan but which have little relationship to the theme of the book.<br />Verdict:  as a baseball book, fair. On a personal basis, kind of nasty. I wonder if Billy Bean liked it?<br />I might add that it is obvious why the book virtually ignores the three star pitchers obviously responsible for the A's recent success, Hudson, Mulder and Zito. It is because they were not selected on the new, miraculous, computer-analysis basis but presumably by the old time \\"good face\\" scouting demonizedso acidly in the book! The book is very selective in this area.
B000006TRV|5.0|(...) Now about the album.<br />The Wall is a smart portrayal of politics and current events taking place in the world at the time of it's release. Roger Waters, the main writer of The Wall, coproduced an incredible concept of the story of an unhappy boy (Pink) who grows up without a father, goes to a school where teachers torment the students, becomes a depressed rock star, has a bad relationship with his wife, and so on.<br />\\"Another Brick in the Wall (Parts 1, \\"Happiest Days of Our Lives\\", 3, and 4)\\" is one of the biggest hits on the album, and tells about Pink's school. \\"We don't need no education\\" is from \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" in case you're wondering, since it is a Classic Rock radio station favourite. \\"Mother\\" is a nice song, which tells about Pink's parents. \\"Goodbye Blue Sky\\" is also a nice song, but pretty gloomy. \\"Empty Spaces/Young Lust\\" is my favorite song on The Wall, and is sung by David Gilmour. \\"Hey You\\" and \\"Is There Anybody Out There?\\" are creepy songs that I like. Note: CD2 is the best CD of The Wall, and has more complete songs than CD1. \\"Comfortably Numb\\" has a great guitar solo by David Gilmour, who co-wrote the song. \\"Run Like Hell\\" is excellent. \\"Waiting for the Worms\\" is creepy. And finally, \\"The Trial\\" concludes everything in Pink's life when everyone who made Pink's life miserable and tormenting all come to Pink's trial. This song's lyrics are very \\"crazy\\".<br />Overall, The Wall is one of Pink Floyd's Top 5 albums. It is arguably not the best one, though.<br />One con about The Wall is that you can't select shuffle or random on your listening source because most tracks are not complete songs. In other words, most tracks converge into each other. There is a way to help this, though. Put The Wall into your computer, use certain types of music software, and converge multiple tracks from The Wall into a single track. One thing you can do is combine Another Brick in the Wall Parts 1, 2, and 3, and Happiest Days of Our Lives, thereforecreating Another Brick in the Wall complete version. This can go for all Pink Floyd albums. You can even combine every track in progression on The Dark Side of the Moon and make it as one file (make one file with every song of the album on it in order).<br />The Wall gets 5 stars, and rightly so, being the well-written, complex, and musical-genius of an album it is. (...)<br />I, personally, hope that whoever is reading this review buys The Wall, or already has it. It is a very good album to own.<br />I hope you liked my review.<br />BOTTOM LINE: The Wall, a near-masterpiece, is an album that should be in every household, especially if you are a rock enthusiast or Pink Floyd follower.<br />-Tabucky
B000026OHN|5.0|I have just finished listening to the first disc of this four disc set.  This CD included the preludes of fugues numbers 1-14.  I have also finished returning to Glenn Gould for this set of Bach's masterpieces.    If Gould, whom I love and admire greatly, performs these works greatly, then there is no exaggeration in stating that Richter's performance is from beyond this realm.      It's not so much of a surprise, anyhow, since so much of what Sviatoslav has left us with is definitive; he is such a monumental and ethereal performer that there seems to be little if any interpretation going on here...he is so spiritual this guy!  A Pisces!    Mr. Richter plays with surety and humility.  He is a worker in the name of these divine works.  There is no sense of self here.  He is not making any personal statements or proclamations.  He is simply playing the music, becoming the music.    This is no longer intellectual music to me, a simple excursion into the world of the fugal art form.  No, this is spiritual music.  After listening to this CD I put Gould's interpretation in the disc player, and finally uncovered an terrible element in his performing style - when he hums, he is patronizing the music.      Rosalyn Tureck is also very good!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I would have to say that I havent stopped listening to this album for very long since I purchased it. I listened to it four times at work today<br />I'm totally mesmerized by it.<br />My personal favorite seems to be the noose. Its so beautifully sorrowful, when the chorus begins I'm immediately taken in to this stream of consciousness, like water, I feel myself drowning in beauty and sorrow at the same time; the two intertwined as one. An emotion I have only felt in extreme spiritual times in my life, the song echoes upon those moments in a way.<br />I also find the pet to be an extremely power song. I find a very political and yet personal message within it.<br /><br />The songs are in good relation to each other when considering the album as a whole. It has a storyline and I like that. That to me says the artist really explored the feelings and expressions during the process of creation and went far enough in, that a relation was given to the chaos of feeling.<br />I was fortunate to see some of these songs played live before I bought the album. I was really interesting to see the way the crowd reacted...a lot of people just stood there totally immersed in the moment.<br />If you have not bought it yet I recommend that you do,,,,,youv'e never really heard anything like it before.
1400034779|5.0|Hurrah! This witty, moving, funny, brilliantly well-written, superbly characterised novel is back in the top 100 again. (It ought to be no.1). The author , who must be one of the nicest people ever to grace a bestseller list, also paints a much more accurate, hopeful picture of Africa than we often see on the news - Botswana is one of the real success stories of post-independence Africa. Read it, buy it for all your friends and then buy a whole load more for Thanksgiving and Christmas presents - and make sure you do it not just for this one but the whole brilliant series as well.

I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read good stories.<BR>-Robbie
B00008DDXC|5.0|Ron and Hermione were great characters from the get go in the first one - now in this one Harry really comes into his own and you can see why he is the lead character, rather than either of his two friends.

B0000C8AVR|4.0|Having owned several releases of this classic album (mono LP, stereo LP, 180gm vinyl LP, CD, gold CD), I was somewhat leary about shelling out $$ for yet another copy. I found the original mono LP and the 180gm to be fantastic, but I just couldn't resist! And am I happy I succumbed to temptation.<br />That now famous opening drum thwack to &quot;Like a Rolling Stone,&quot; the rock shot heard 'round the world is now literally a crack...a rifle shot.  I jumped out of my chair.  From then on, it was an amazing journey through a classic album.  <br />From the opening snap to the closing ringing cords of &quot;Desolation Row,&quot; the production is crystal clear.  I can hear Dylan breathing, as if he were on a stage right in front of me.  The strum of the plectra against the guitar strings, always audible, is now as clear as if he were in the room.  It is amazing, almost eerie, how close he seems, and how enveloping is the sound.  <br />I do not have a SACD player, but believe me, the sonic improvement with a regular &quot;redbook&quot; cd player is worth it!  I'll be getting them all, one at a time.<br />My reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is that the mix seems a little too bright (unlike &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;).  I don't know if this is a reflection of the original master tapes, or the way the SONY engineers fancied it should sound.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I first saw this film when I was around 17 (though it had come out a few years earlier) and instantly fell in love with it.  One of the most beautiful and endearing of the Disney films, and an absolute must-have DVD.  Say you are getting it for the kids, but you know you are getting it for yourself!  : )
B00006CXXU|4.0|Many analogous cases could be adduced, but here is the real deal, folks. \\"Christina Aguilera\\" (born Kishori Kreuzfeld, the only child of a Hindustani nurse and a German-Jewish oncologist) offers us, in this, her sophomore effort, a malum prohibitum for the ages. It is NOT, as previous reviewers here have averred, a \\"prelapsarian prologomena suppurating with exponentially divisitory desultorata\\". As if! No, what we must reconcile, and ultimately admire, is Kishori's tendency, latent though it may be, to enforce an almost Palestrinan monody on a genre dominated, to a tyrannical degree, by exuberant polyphonic elaboration. What courage to defy the image-makers! What chutzpah to flout the expectations of the hoi polloi! What je-ne-sais-quoi to so resolutely resist the zeitgeist and give us what we need, not what we want! Kudos and Huzzahs to her, I say. <br />To those who need convincing that Kishori is indeed the defiant genius of our age, I say: Listen, O Fools! Listen to the recapitulation of the secondary theme in her heart-rending lament \\"Squirm, Queenie V.\\" (track 26) in which the vain fantasy of pudendal superiority is delicately, almost subliminally, suggested through a series of eerie descending parallel fourths that melt, thaw, and finally resolve themselves into the subdominant. Goosebumps, man, friggin goosebumps. Now compare that with \\"Kegel Kave\\", a similar ballad off \\"Bait\\", her debut album. Here is where we see Miss Kreuzfeld's development at its most salvific: What had earlier been a terrigenous exercise in sacerdotal sardonicism has become, in the hands of this burgeoning young genius, a full-blown tumescent glory, throbbing with threnodical eloquence, erupting with seminal sequelae that will sire a thousand epigonoi. <br />Simply put, this is the most astounding act of musical creation the world has ever seen, or ever will see. Buy twenty thousand copies of it now.
B00005JKDR|5.0|This has to be one of the greatest films ever!  My children and I have watched this film so many times that we nearly have it memorized, and still we slip it into the DVD player a few times a week!  The laughs are non-stop, Mike and Sully are unbelievably lovable, the character Boo is adorable, and the ''monster world'' is a place you will want to visit time and again.  BUY THIS MOVIE!  It will be money very well spent.
B000002J0B|5.0|Forget number 4. This is the best album by one of the greatest bands ever. Every song on this record falls into place perfectly and no song ever gets boring. If you have for some reason never picked this album up do so now.
B00001QEE6|5.0|There is just something magical about this movie!  So many times, when I put this film on for my children- ages 4 and 2- to watch, I am drawn to sit down and watch along.  And not many of their films have that effect on me (only other, Monster's, Inc.!). The characters are all highly endearing, the artwork beautiful, and the story classic in every way.  A MUST HAVE film for any family!
B000002C25|4.0|If you are a fan of Oasis this is a must, but if you are new to the fold do not start here. This album has some of the bands greatest moments, but the album as a whole is a tad long. While it is true this record is slightly underrated it is defnitly not a masterpiece.
B000059Z8M|5.0|My children- ages 4 and 2- are absolutely, totally in love with this movie, and would willingly sit and watch it over and over and over again.  They actually much prefer this sequel to the original Toy Story, which seems to scare them a bit (they don't like the scenes in Sid's room with the scary-looking toys, or the when he is blowing up his toys).  All-in-all, this is a perfect film, and one which children and parents alike will enjoy together for many years to come.
B0000584V3|5.0|By far the best record by Opeth. Everything in this record just seems to click. If you are intrested in Opeth this is the place to start. You will NOT be sorry.
B00000J2KT|3.0|The &quot;acting&quot; of R. Lee Ermey is not &quot;acting,&quot; it's 1000% authentic!  He makes the film!!
B00006SFBD|5.0|This was the very first record by Opeth I owned. I had heard many great things about this band and found myself doubting they would live up to the hype. Boy was i wrong. Powerful, engaging, dynamic, inspirational, never before has anything that seemed like metal on the surface struck so many chords within me. Pick this up and start your journey today.
B000002AS3|4.0|Oasis has made an awesome debut. I love this CD. It isn't the best that Oasis has made, but it's not the worse. It contains hit like Rock N' Roll Star, Live Forever, Up in the Sky, Supersonic, Digsy Diner, Slide Away, Married with Children, and on some cds the single Sad Song.<br />Supersonic is probaly my favorite song on the CD. It's guitar is catchy and will have the melody stuck in your head.<br />Married with Children is another one of my favorites off of it. I love the acoustic guitar in the set. It's beautifully written and sung.<br />Live Forever is another great song. It's a ballad that will last forever.<br />Noel Gallagher is an awesome songwriter. I'd say he is the best in the music business. I wish Oasis spent more time in the U.S. I honestly believe these guys could be a modern day Beatles, if they did like the rest of the music world and sold out to MTV. I'm glad they haven't. Come listen to the roots of Oasis. They are a lot more than Wonderwall, Champagne Supernova, and Don't Go Away. Go and buy Definetly Maybe. If your an Oasis fan, you'll Definetly like it.
B000068QY7|5.0|I have always been a fan of Oasis, just not one of their most devoted followers. With Heathen Chemistry I feel that might change. I didn't go into this album expecting much, which could be why I loved it so much. If you are an Oasis fan of old who has drifted away pick this up and see what you have been missing. If you are new to Oasis pick up Morning Glory first, then work up to this.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I've read the J.R.R. Tolkien books. I've seen the two movies. I've enjoyed all of them greatly so far. Peter Jackson had made another hit to add to his resume, in one of the best movies of this new century.<BR>The Two Towers continues the journey to destroy the ring that was started in the Fellowship of the Ring. The movie is basicly three stories happening in one. You have Mary and Pippin who were captured by Orcs in Fellowship. They are now traveling across middle earth with the Ents(Giant Walking Trees). You have Aragon, Leoglas, and Gimley who go to Helms Deep to help the people of Rohan fight off the army of Isengard. Then you have Frodo and Sam making there journey to Mordor where they pick up another traveler Gollum.<BR>Thats a basic overview of the movie made in three short sentences. <BR>The action scenes are my favorite part of the movie. The fight at Helms Deep is fantastic. Peter Jackson and his special affects team WETA are outstanding. The fight is so realistic looking between the 10000 orcs and 300 men and elves. It's hard to believe half of that was all digitally made.<BR>Gollum is another highlight of the movie. His split-personality will leave you in laughter. It's superb acting.<BR>The music is great in the movie. Howard Shore has made a beautiful soundtrack for this movie. It's good enough that you'd think it was done by John Williams.<BR>I can't really say more except I love this movie. I'm looking forward to Return of the King. Don't miss out on owning this movie. It would be a great addition to your movie collection
0385504209|5.0|This is THE must read book. I fell in love with it right from the start, and it is now my favorite. If you are only going to buy one book, this is the one to get. It perfectly combines just the right amount of intellect, danger, and history in one fantastic novel. I have not a single bad thing to say about it, other than the fact that it doesnt continue for eternity. I absolutely loved this book, and would recommend it for anyone.
B00005JM09|4.0|I'm going to try to make this review short and sweet. I loved the movie. I don't want to release much of the story, because I don't want anydody that hasn't seen it, to miss out on it. <br />This was a well made movie. It had a lot of anticipation. The special affects are great, the action is great, the acting is great.<br />I'd have to say what I was really disappointed with in the movie was the T-X. They just didn't do enough with her. In Terminator and T2 the Terminator's have this swagger. You just never though they'd kill those suckers. When they did you almost had a sense of relief come over you. The TX never has that swagger. You don't ever really think she's gonna get them. Your more pre-occupated on wether they will stop Judgement Day from happening. <br />Thats my only knock on the movie. I did enjoy this movie a lot. Arnold once again shows that he's the greatest action hero of all time. If you liked the previous Terminator movies, you'll like this. If you like science fiction or action movies, you'll like Terminator 3. If you like arnold you'll definetly like it. It's just a good movie. Not much else I can say.
B00006AFUR|5.0|I came to this CD purely by accident when I was surfing the net for info on Jared Leto,(since he's co-starring in Colin Farrells next movie &quot;Alexander&quot;.) and I must say that I was very pleasantly suprised. This album really kicks some major ass!!!! Usually when actors have their own rock-bands, they suck. (Keanu Reeves in Dogstar.) This album is brilliant from beginning to end. There's not one weak song on it. My favorites are ; Edge of the earth, Capricon(a brand new name).Jared Leto is one fine singer and guitarist. He really suprised me. I have to say that this album hasn't left my cd-player since I received it three weeks ago. This album nd band is definitely here to stay!!!!!!
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is a great cd in many ways. I won't give each song stars, because it seems to be done too much. Meteora is a great album. It has great sounds, great lyrics and is nice in every way. Meteora is maybe too short, but who cares? It's so great, that I could listen to it over and over again! I think, that it's too short, but that only makes me love the songs even more than if I was to listen to more songs!<BR>Conclusion: Meteora is a great album with great songs and great lyrics. It's not superior to Hybrid Theory, but that album was also the greatest album of all time in my opinion. Meteora is a great follow-up to Hybrid Theory and I can only advise everyone, who's into Nu metal to buy it.
B000000OSE|5.0|Many say Use Your Illusion II is much more emotional but I beg to differ. Even though Use Your Illusion II may have more heavier songs. It doesn't mean The first can't be heavy too!
B000002UVX|5.0|I can't understand why people on't consider this to be hendrix's best album. People are ignorant and associate hendrix with &quot;purple haze&quot; and &quot;foxy lady&quot;. These are both perfectly good songs, but they lack the passion hendrix puts into his playing on this album. This is a much more funky soulful album which is kind of an abandon of the psychadelic early albums of his. These are more long, drawn out jams. &quot;Who Knows&quot; is probably my favorite Hendrix song. I have to admit also, the new rhythm section completely puts the old one to shame. The bass playing plus the drummers backup vocals are excellent. If you like hendrix, buy this. You won't believe how good it is.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This CD is AMAZING!  I love it!  It's one of the few CD's that I can play the entire way through without skipping a song.  There is so much acion and drama in the music that it makes you want to go on a swashbuckeling adventure yourself.  I have purchased many movie soundtracks within the last year and I can truely say that this one tops them all.
0393057658|5.0|How do you rate an amature baseball player? Up until several years ago, scouts would look for the &quot;good face,&quot; or the lean body, or the fastest footspeed, or the 90 mph fastball. How about Statistical analysis? How about how well these high school and college kids actually play the game? Michael Lewis shows how the Oakland A's have been looking at the statistics of amature players in order to determine how they will perform in the future. The Result? The A's continue to win their division year after year with one of the lowest budgets in baseball.<br />This book is a great read that incorperates usefull statistical analysis with a wonderful story. You'll be routing Billy Bean and his Oakland A's on even if you're not an A's fan. But don't worry, the new statistical way to play the game will soon reach all of baseball. Be ahead of the game and pick up this book, and you'll wonder why no one ever had the common sense to think of this before.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This soundtrack is AMAZING!  I can listen to the entire thing without ever getting bored or having to skip a song.  There is so much drama and power in the music that it makes you want to go out on a swashbuckeling adventure yourself.  I have purchased many soundtracks to movies that have come out within the last year and I can say for sure that this on tops them all.
B00005AQF7|5.0|Truthfully this is Snoop's best and only good CD. But it's classic, the beats are amazing, kurupt's rhymes are crazy. Buy it, It kicks some serious G funk ass
0743216458|3.0|BOB is not a bad book, but still I was disappointed. Though I believe the 506th to be regular airborne infantry, respectfully (no more-no less) I don't believe he did these men justice. Ambrose never reached within to learn of their true insight and left a hole by not allowing the men to tell a more gripping tale, one that was no doubt gripping but...Ambrose doesn't put it across as such. <br />I feel I must add something else about good books. Having read Ambrose's BOB I take issue with other readers that believe it to be the finest book on small unit actions. While in Baghdad several months ago my platoon leader found a loose copy of The Black Devil Brigade by Joseph Springer. Unlike BOB it covers the history of the 1st Special Service Forces in the words of the men themselves. I bet it's still somewhere in Baghdad teaching someone else to survive.
B00005AQF7|5.0|Doggystyle is a pure classic. Whatever douche said snoop ripped the beats off from george clinton is stupid as hell. 1. GC and Snoop are dawgs 2. It's called the funk man, it all sounds the same. Every track on here kicks ass, Dre's funky beats are tight and the DPG tears it up. Classic, buy it.
B00005ATQF|5.0|first of all, let me say, that anyone who doesnt like this movie is a complete goddamn moron.  Only someone with no brain in their head could dislike a stanley kubrick film.<br />Next let me pose the question:  &quot;WHY THE HELL ISN'T THERE A WIDESCREEN VERSION OF THIS MOVIE ON DVD!?!?!?!?!?  WHAT THE F@#*K?&quot;
B000002KY8|5.0|Even at a mere 11 cuts (many of which are well over 7 minutes) &quot;1999&quot; comes off like a funkier varriation of Prince's &quot;Purple Rain&quot; sound without the tight pop songs of the latter.The tital track,&quot;DMSR&quot;,&quot;All The Critics Love U In New<BR>York&quot;,&quot;Automatic&quot; and the pulsing electronica of &quot;Let's Pretend We're Married&quot; pretty much fit into that catagory.A few delicious additions are the more diverse selections such as the<BR>the modern-ish 50's-style rock n' roll of &quot;Delirious&quot;,the radio classic 80's rock number &quot;Little Red Corvette&quot; and the totally<BR>James Brown funk of &quot;Lady Cab Driver&quot; and of course &quot;Free&quot; and<BR>&quot;International Lover&quot; present us with Prince-the love man.his most fully realized album this is a sonic treat for the sences.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I enjoyed this Movie very much - But like most Books-made-into-movies It differs greatly from the books.  Just sit back and enjoy the Movie for what it is - a movie about a book, not an exact duplicate of the words in a visul format.
B000002KMV|5.0|&quot;Controversy&quot; is an EXACT transitional album between &quot;Dirty<BR>Mind&quot; and &quot;1999&quot;-the musical style is far closer to that of it's<BR>predecessor but it's production has everything to do with what was to come.The sly tital song,one of Prince's top 5 funk jams is<BR>here in it's majectic,primal best as is the complete &quot;Head&quot; rip<BR>off of &quot;Let's Work&quot;.Overall it has the same flavor as the Time's<BR>debut on such dancable pop/funk-rock as &quot;Private Joy&quot;,&quot;Jack U Off&quot; and &quot;Sexuality&quot;.Most unusual is a minimal new-wave rock<BR>number called &quot;Annie Christian&quot;,a chilling account of murder,fear<BR>and gun conrtol issues.The smootchy ballad &quot;Do Me,Baby&quot; is great<BR>bedroom fodder and the only track we'll try to forget<BR>is the silly,pointless &quot;Ronnie,Talk to Russia&quot;.But this,&quot;Dirty Mind&quot; and &quot;1999&quot; are essencial early Prince and everything on these three albums have tunes that won't quite quit the memory.
0156012197|5.0|That it is written at a children's vocabulary and comprehension level is just one more reason why it is such a classic.  You can read it when you're 10 and get a valuable lesson from it, and then read it again when you're 30 and find something new.  It is a book that should probably be read once every couple years--just to find out who you are and whether you're getting too old.
B000002KLP|5.0|Blend these two styles together with a delicious DIY ethic and you've got 'Dirty Mind'.One of Prince's less produced albums<BR>it brims with synth-heavy new-wave such as the the tital song,<BR>&quot;Do It All Night&quot;,the disturbing &quot;Sister&quot; and the wonderfully<BR>Beatlesqe &quot;When You Were Mine&quot; highlite this collection.Of course<BR>&quot;Uptown&quot;,&quot;Partyup&quot; and the deep groove of &quot;Head&quot; that point the<BR>way to Prince's best era soon to come while &quot;Gotta broken Heart<BR>Again&quot; is classic Stax/Atlantic Records Soul balladeering.<BR>&quot;Dirty Mind&quot; is as such a VERY hard album to overrate!
B000003TSP|5.0|i can't remember how many years we had to wait for the follow up to dummy (my brain is kinda messed up. 25 years of living on planet earth does this to a guy). anyhow the follow up came after years of waiting. and it was much different than most people were thinking it was going to be. but it's ever bit as good. the beats on here are alot more dark and a little weirder. i swear the beat on Seven Months sounds like a duck horn. lol. my dad had one and that's what one sounds like. also love the little guitar work in that song. beth's voice is amazing as always. the beats are great. there is a little filler on here like Half Day Closing &amp; Over (never did like that track). but when they're on the top of the game (which they are for the most part) it's very good. i would rather give it a 4.5 but since i can't i'll have to go with 5 just because there really is some great stuff here. the last track on here is about as good of an ending track as you will get. the fake sample with the guy singing is classic stuff :) it's to bad they couldn't keep hitting us with albums but the 2 we did get are classic.
0790729628|4.0|Blade Runner is one of those movies that made an impact on us viewers of its original theater run.  However, over the years it was discovered by millions more and now stands as a sci-fi masterpiece, due to its stunning visuals, storytelling, acting and ambience.  Unfortunately, when it was rereleased as the director's cut, and as much as I regard Ridley Scott as a master of his craft, I considered that the elimination of the voiceover was one of the biggest mistakes ever made in cinema history, as most of the storytelling and mood that made it a classic, was gone.  Regarding the different endings, either are OK as to me the climax of the movie was really in the final scene between Batty and Deckard. <br />I am one of many fans that will love to see the original BR restored for DVD, as companion to whatever other version Ridley wants included, which I understand will be the so-called Director's Cut and a new Definitve Cut,that, if made right and honest to its many fans and not solely to the director's ego, should reinsert the voice-over along any other new scenes and edits.<br />Let me emphasize that I have been a longtime fan of Mr. Scott since the groundbreaking Alien, and really hope he brings back the movie that convinced millions that Alien was not a one time stroke of luck but rather the indication that a legendary career was on the making.
B00000K0T8|5.0|ghostface killah's debut album is a nice one for sure. rza throws down some funky &amp; soulfull beats (some of his best IMO). this album has great tracks all over the place. lots of surprizes. one of them being the beautiful ghostface/mary j track &quot;All That I Got Is You&quot; (you don't even have to like rap to love that joint right there). other favs are Iron Maiden (with a great verse from Cappadonna), Fish, Daytona 500 &amp; After the Smoke Is Clear. sadly this album i heard had the track The Soul Controller cut off on the new versions cause of the sample it uses (that's a damn shame). i would say you should try and hurt down the original version of this album :)
B000089RVX|5.0|evanescence gave me a taste of new music and got me away from the candy coated pop. they are the new face of gothrock in the music buisness. Their music inspired me to try other variations of rock. ROCK ON EVANESCENCE!
B000002BE9|5.0|this is a very beatuiful &amp; underated album right here from that wacky fiona apple girl. sadly fiona had to go thru what alot of young talented music makers have to go thru. i.e. being throw into the spotlight and hyped to the moon. this can hurt an artist no doubt (and i see it happen all the time). fiona is cool thou. and the singles and videos on here were a great change of pace from what was getting heavy mtv play at the time. it's a great piece of music from start to finish. she has an amazing voice!!! and lets face it she's a nutcase and that's always cool :) people with problems seem to make the best music but sadly they also seem to get burned :(
B00009ATKS|2.0|This Mogwai -- all of whose albums I somehow ended up with -- are pretty boring. A weaker Sigur Ros, and nowhere near as strong as GYBE!. Maybe it's the constant guitar wash many people worship. The strings are welcome here for variety. You get the idea that any melody is from luck, otherwise it's just noodling. And emotion? Yeah, maybe the same one, really more a celebration of a muddy state of mind. If their thing is to build, then build! The thing I find most enjoyable about this band are the song names. However, they did make one work that does build well, and shines above the rest (besides a track or two here & there): the EP \\"My Father My King.\\" That one's a keeper.<br />NEW (May 2006): I do get it a bit more nowadays. A good listen overall.<br />UPDATE (much needed): I get it, I get it now...! I play this a lot. Along with ROCK ACTION.

0811806405|4.0|All woodworkers are perfectionists, but those who make musical instruments live in a special place in hell.  For them, each step, no matter how small can have a huge, and unexpected effect on the final result.  Even if they follow the same plans and use the same materials, two guitarmakers can have significantly different results.<br />Developing the techniques that will give the craftsman both consistency and control over the final result can often take a lifetime of experimentation.  This excellent book, by Cumpiano and Natelson, helps to bridge the gap between novice and journeyman.  It will enable most aspiring luthiers to produce something special.<br />The writers focus on the practicalities of guitarmaking - the tools and techniques used.  The arrangement is functional and step-wise, the explanations clear, with a sufficiency of illustrations and photographs.  Little attention is paid to the more exotic equipment that appears in professional workshops.  This is a book for the hand-craftsman, not someone intent on starting a business.<br />I confess that I did not by the book with the intent of making a guitar.  Instead, I was on the verge of having one made for me, and I wanted to understand the process enough to talk intelligently with the makers (in my case, the luthier, the tuning machine maker, and the inlayer).  As such, this book bridged an important gap.<br />What is missing from the book is any detailed discussion about material choice and the effect of certain design decisions (materials, bracing, etc.).  Since these are the things that can make the difference between an OK instrument and a work of the luthier's art, I would have liked to see much more information.  For that, unfortunately, one must seek elsewhere.  But for everything else, this volume will do.
B00009TB5G|1.0|I am astounded that with all of the resourses at his disposal, with all of the amazing hard work that was put in to getting the sets, costumes, props, etc right (and at least visually, I think just about everything is very faithful to the books), this is the best Peter Jackson can come up with. Setting aside the creative license for a minute, this movie is a rather dreary compilation of sweeping, brooding wide-angle landscape shots, coupled with some rather goofy dialogue that never gives you more than a surface glance at the characters. Oh, and the battle scene. Sure, it looks good. That's really all one can say about it. Truth be told, this movie rather reminds me of \\"Willow\\" with computer graphics.<br />But I don't want to set aside the creative license, because I am also a flag-nailed-to-the-mast purist. I will grant you that some editing has to be done to fit 1500 pages or so of close text into a screenplay. Fair enough. But Jackson didn't just edit the story, he changed fundamental parts of it. And he certainly seems to have found room to add a lot of things. Other reviewers have catalogued these edits pretty well, so I won't repeat them. I will simply say that, on a deeper level, Jackson either doesn't understand or else doesn't care about the things that make Tolkien's story unique and separate it from any other fantasy/adventure.  Jackson might just as well have produced a movie based on a Dungeons and Dragons game.  That way, he could have used all of his whiz-bang special effects and Maxfield Parish-meets-Enya production stunts without dragging poor old Tolkien's name into it. Feh.
038572179X|2.0|I picked up this particular book, because one of my favorite novelist, Chris Bohjalian, recommended it at a book signing. I found the book difficult to get through and considered abandoning it altogether at times. I kept waiting for an unforgivable crime to take place, and when it did, it was hardly unforgivable, as it was committed by a 13 yr old girl.  As such, the &quot;atonement&quot; failed to live up to the title. Although the book has literary value, I would not recommend it.
B000002UAR|2.0|The following Beatles albums are better than Revolver:<BR>Abbey Road, The White Album, Let It Be, A Hard Day's Night, Help, Meet the Beatles, and Beatles for Sale.  The only albums worse are Sgt. Pepper, Mystery Tour and Rubber Soul.<br />This album has a few good songs, but a lot of mediocre songs.  I am surprised to see this on so many &quot;best of&quot; rock album lists.
B000002BPS|3.0|The follow up to group's breakout album (Smash) was highly anticipated when it finally came out.  Would they be able to produce a album of the same quality which would understandably be hard because of how great Smash really was.  What we have is here is yet another album that has some great songs on it but some bad ones as well.  Thank god for the invention of the CD player so we can pre-program our CD's otherwise Im not sure I would own this is days of the audio cassette.<br />Amazed is the sleeper of the album.  This fast paced rocker stil rocks 8 years later and gets your adrenaline pumping every time.  It is one of those songs that if you listen to while driving, you suddenly find yourself speeding with white knuckles.  Cool to Hate, Change the World, and Gone Away are all great as well and the perfectly embody the classic Offspring sound.  Mota is pretty funny and always brings a smile to my face.  Besides those you have some really annoying titles that you will soon find yourself constantly skipping.  Me and My Old Lady is repetetive and festers like a bad wound.  Way Down the Line and Don't Pick It Up are just as bad and most of the others that I didn't previously mention are just as forgetable.<br />Bottom Line:  An alright album that could of been better.  A must have for serious new fans that don't have but casual fans can stay away.  Definitely not in the same genre transcending category as Smash was.
B000002KHB|5.0|Classic CD!<BR>If you've never heard it, you're in for a treat. <br />If you want to hear 21st century Deep Purple, <BR>order their new album Bananas (Oct. 7, 2003), <BR>you're also in for a treat. <br />God bless DP!
B00000DHRZ|1.0|All I can say is avoid this horrble mess AT ALL COSTS!!!!!!!!!!  This album is so bad its dissapointing to listen not only because the music is stinks but because I used to like Offspring.  All the songs are bad.  Offspring has gotten away from the guitar driven rocking ways into whatever mess you want to classify them as now.  This album is pop meets rap meets reggae meets I don't know what and it is unlistenable.<br />Pretty Fly For A White Guy is the ultimate example of what is wrong with this album.  The song is almost a rap song that is not funny and barely makes sense.  It gets really annoying quickly (just like it did on radio) and only got as much airplay as it did because of the video and the nation's delayed reaction to the fact that Offspring had started to write crap!  The saddest thing is that PFFAWG is actually one of the better songs on this album!!  Here is a quick rundown:<br />1)  Welcome - even in nine seconds it will drive you to pull you hair out!!  <br />2)  Have You Ever- heard crap as bad as this??  actually this is the best song on the album that reminds us what good Offspring was about.<br />3)  Staring At The Sun - which is what I would rather do than listen to this.<br />4)  Pretty Fly - already discussed this catastrophe.<br />5)  The Kids Are Alright - probably beacuse they just wasted 14 bucks on garbage. The first 20 sec of this is stolen from TWO previous Offspring songs.<br />6)  Feelings- the lowpoint of the album.  Feelings ..whoa.... feelings....insane, angry, frustrated, outraged, and constapated are a few that come to mind.<br />7)She's Got Issues- a) especailly after listening to this<BR>                    b) NO, the band is the one with issues<br />8)  Walla Walla- this album sounds like a university fight song- fun in a drunken state at a football game otherwise Ill pass.<br />9)  The End Of The Line- I think its the end of the line for Offspring...actually one of the few listenable songs.<br />10)  No Brakes- A good guitarline ruined by vocal showboating<br />11)-13)  By this time I have turned off the album every time so I couldn't even tell you how bad they are.<br />It seems that Offspring has just gotten lazy and sold out.  I saw them in concert after this album came out when they played in Berkely with Lit.  After making us wait like 40 mins they come out and play a 60 minutes set!!  They were the headlining band and they couldn't even play for an hour!!  Like I said they have just gotten lazy.<br />Bottom Line:  I would rather have a rotting cadaver in my CD player than this.
B0000BYM3K|2.0|Yes, i am a huge maiden fan and always will be, but i am also honest.<br />this album is nowhere near as good as &quot;brave new world.&quot;<br />it does have a few good moments, like all maiden albums(they don't write a bad album), but the album is mostly filler.<br />the first 4 songs could all be combined into one, because the riffs and time signatures are all the same.<br /> on the title track, the music is quite good, but the strings are so loud in the mix, it sounds more like jethro tull then maiden.<br />lastly, bruce needs to rest his voice a bit more, because this album shows a very weary voice.<br />I'm sure the tour will be quite fun, and the  live songs are always better than the album versions, but this album should not have been rushed to print.<br />maiden should really take more time recording. it shows in the lyrics and in the music. this is a 2 star maiden album, but hey! they had a great 25 years didn't they?
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|Scary movie makes the most of those ridiculous slasher movies that just make me want to scream.  They Wayon brothers deliver non stop hilarious fun and make this a great movie to watch over and over.  One of those slapstick comedies that if you love Airplane, The Naked Gun, you will love this.  A 98/100 points five star movie.

I admit, the first time I heard this album I didn't think that I liked it.  The more I listened to it though, I came to love it.  It really is quite brilliant.  The title track opens the album and kind of sets the tone for what is ahead.  Hearing this song brings all kinds of mental images to my head of the crazy state of not just Europe, but of the whole world.  It is really quite profound.  The second track, &quot;Babyface&quot; and track 5, &quot;Stay&quot; are the most classic U2 sounding tracks on the album and are both good songs, but the experimental sound is what this album really is about and therefore these more traditional songs are a bit lost and out of place.  &quot;Lemon&quot; is a masterpiece showcasing Bono's famous falsetto.  The opening to &quot;Daddy's Gonna Pay for your Crashed Car&quot; is an absolutely glorious combination of fanfare and pop tech.  God help me, I love that song!  &quot;The First Time&quot; is a profound track and a statement on the band's Christianity and the struggles they have in their belief and faith.  A great song and true to U2.  The album ends with the unmistakeable glorious voice of Johnny Cash singing of a possibly post apoctalyptic world in &quot;The Wanderer.&quot;  It is a great blend of the new techy U2 sound and a folky sort of pop sound.  Cash's vocals are perfect for this song and just the image that the song conjures and the icon that is Johnny Cash could not be a more perfect if unexpected match.  It is brilliant and the perfect finale to this incredible album.
0140366997|5.0|Conan Doyle's Hound of the Baskervilles is the best known Sherlock Holmes story.  It's an excellent novel, and the only Holmes story where the creepy plot overshadows the great detective.  It is by far the best of the 4 Holmes novels, and only a handful of the 56 short stories rival it in literary quality.  For a curious reader wishing to aquaint him or herself with fiction's most famous detective (and one of the 3 or 4 most famous characters in all of literature), this is a perfect start.  You'll be hooked like a happy trout on a mountain stream.  An odd metaphor perhaps, but once you read it you'll agree.  And you'll then hungrily grab all the other lures too, all 59 other stories.  Then someday looking back, you'll see that the diabolical hound that haunts the moors was Doyle's masterpiece.

020530902X|5.0|When I first learned about this book I was slightly wary. After all, how much information could there be in such a slim book? A smart friend of mine told me that it was a good book that elucidates the technique of writing.<br />I decided to start reading this pithy book and finished reading it in one sitting. The book is easy to read and gives writers many excellent suggestions. It explains some commone grammar mistakes. It shows how a writer should use the active voice. It explains many commonly misused words like effect, lay, nature, and character. Every part of the book was useful, and I enjoyed reading it. If there was one book that a writer should read it would definitely be The Elements of Style.
B00009TB5G|5.0|first off i'd like to clear some stuff up<br />all of the people that are complaining about not seeing shelob's lair in this movie obviously dont know anything about drama. shelobs lair would work a lot better as an opening scene of the third film than the last scene of the second film. i also realize jackson put in a lot of stuff that wasnt in the books. SO WHAT. it may have not done justice for tolkien but they were good enough as they were. <br />remember these 43 minutes added were intended to be in the theatrical release....but whose gonna sit in a movie theater for 3hours and 42 minutes?<br />the movie was great......<BR>all the acting performances were outstanding.<BR>the special effects and cinematography were awesome.<BR>but i have to say the movie belongs to andy serkis as Gollum.<BR>that was my favorite thing of the whole movie.<br />to all of you people on the movie set...<BR>make the third movie as long as needs to be to fit all the book in because EVERYTHING in that book is essential.<br />cant wait to see the third one and see the extended version of this one.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|&quot;Wainwright could be singing lists of names out of the phone book and it would still be more exciting and inventive than 99 percent of the other albums out there.&quot; - Zac Johnson<br />Rufus Wainwright is by far my favorite musician and his newest album is no less excellent than his phenomenal first two albums.  This album may in fact be the most accessible for those who did not instantaneously fall in love with his previous songs.  The key is to listen to the songs multiple times allowing them to become familiar to you, like reading poetry, every time you listen the lyrics and music become richer and reveal their exquisite layers of beauty, emotion, and greatness.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|This is definitely a good selection of Beatles chart toppers especially singles like &quot;I want to hold your hand&quot;. But there are lot of hits like &quot;Michelle&quot;, &quot;Strawberry Fields forever&quot; etc. are missing. Anyway at this price I couldn't ask for more. For Beatles starters, this is a good one to get engulfed in &quot;Beatle Mania&quot;
B00008BRB5|5.0|'Synchronicity' is one of those albums that any serious music lover should own. The Police were at the height of their popularity in 1983, but more importantly at the height of their musical powers. This was the album they had in them, and were working towards. Sting's lyrics had evolved from punkish, and somewhat immature songs about blow-up dolls and youthful angst, to complex psychological character studies and social commentary (built on from their previous, 'Ghost In The Machine'). Andy Summers and Stuart Copland were just as equally important as Sting in creating the sound of the group; Summers was quite the unsung guitar hero, rarely taking an overblown amp-shredding solo, but always playing interesing harmonies for the good of the song.<br />'Synchonicity' is a totally different beast from the early white-reggae 'Outlandos D'Amour' singles. The two title tracks are upbeat, dark, complex, yet very tuneful, while 'Tea In The Sahara' is a slow, atmospheric end to the album. ('Murder By Numbers' is a b-side which was added on to the cassette and cd issues, while a very cool, catchy song, it sounds a bit odd at the end, and I'm not one too picky about that kind of stuff.) The hits on the album get the most attention, especially 'Every Breath You Take', but the album works best as a unified work and not a platform for a big hit single. The Police went out on top, but it would be interesting to see how they would have continued as a group when looking at Sting's solo career.
0345440900|5.0|I recently had my second baby and read this book. I wish I had it with my 1st!  I honestly did not know how to take care of a baby the first time around and was frazzled half the time. Her advice on &quot;training&quot; a baby to sleep on their own really work. Granted this takes a ton of time, but it is worth it in the end. I am not opposed to rocking, nursing, etc to sleep, but in my experience, it never works. I would rock, nurse, etc. for 1+ hours and lay the baby down, only to have the baby's eyes pop open and start to cry.  She does not advocate letting your baby cry which is very different from Babywise. <br />Although I breastfeed, I am not opposed to her section on formula. How you feed your baby is not how you love your baby.  I would take her advice on the intervals of feeding with a grain of salt. If you think your baby is hungry, feed her! But not all cries are for food which is a wonderful lesson. <br />This book is not for you if you follow Attachment Parenting or Dr. Sears methods but want more of a middle of the road approach.<BR>As with all parenting books, use her lessons that you like and throw out the rest.  Parenting is about using common sense.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|The Matrix opened my mind up to new things. The Matrix Reloaded continued that, in a way i'll never forget. I loved this movie, and i honestly don't see why so many people didnt like it, because of particular scenes, (Zion, Fight Scenes) which i just guess i felt were powerful or meaningful in certain metaphorical depths, whereas some people felt empty for some reason. I think that the fight scenes were incredible, and the fact that they were long, made me like them more than the few in the first movie, since those weren't as long, but still good. I only tell those who see it to be prepared for the cliffhanger ending of this film to The Matrix Revolutions, which is coming out in November.<BR>If you want to enjoy this movie, view it as its own movie, continuing from the same story-line, not the same storyline itself. I think too many people expect the same things over and over again, yet when they get THAT, are they really happy?<br />if you are too much of a critic about certain things, this may not be for you, but it has been my favorite action/sci-fi movie this year. (Revolutions may change that however)<br />Sorry no-one else saw the same movie i did. lol
B0000C7PRY|4.0|ACTUALLY 4 1/2 STARS.<br />Neal Morse's first solo effort since leaving Spock's Beard is a tremendous outing from one very talented man. Testimony comes right off the heals of Morse's Spock's Beard concept album, SNOW. You can see that he had SNOW in mind when writing and recording Testimony. It's the same double album, and although not a concept than a autobiography, it tells a story in a simlar vein, about one indivudual's struggle. The music evolves the same way, and you can tell that there are some numbers here that sound as though they may have been written during the SNOW days. The songs interconnect by the five parts, staying true to the prog/concept thematic that we all love so much. But what of the music?<br />Well, well, it's spectacular. Neal is perhaps one of the most talented musicians out there. He can play guitar with the best, and some of his leads are amazing. His keyboard playing is up there with the best too. He even plays bass here just as well as his former bandmate, Dave Meros. His singing is on as well, and the orchestral arrangements he's written (which are abundant on this album) are genius. Listen to California Nights, The Prince Of The Power Of The Air (which reminds me of Devil's Got My Throat, from SNOW), Ready To Try, Sing It High, and the AMAZING Storm Before The Calm.<br />Now, the only quibble I have here are the lyrics. I don't mind a man singing about his passions. But the Jesus/Christian tone is a bit too overt, making listening to these fine songs a bit distracting. The tones were there during SNOW, but less in the open and more discreet, for example, in Wind At My Back: &quot;My soul has been kissed, just because you exist&quot;. But, in Testimony, we have full-fledged Christian lyrics: nearly every song contains overt references to Jesus &amp; God (the song sleeping Jesus is really awful, lyrically and musically). Again, not griping against it, it's perfectly okay for Neal to sing what he wishes, it's just a bit distrcting to this long-time Prog listener. I feel that I would've given this album 5 stars if it were the new Spock's Beard album with the same music and different lyrics. I will say that the music itself makes up for the 'light' lyrics.<br />Good job Neal...continued success to you.this long-time Prog listener. I feel that I would've given this album 5 stars if it were the new Spock's Beard album with the same music and different lyrics. I will say that the music itself makes up for the 'light' lyrics. <br />Good job Neal...continued success to you.
0316096199|4.0|After reading this book, I really do feel like I was given a bit of a gift, of hope. No, I haven't been raped, but just to know that someone who went through such a horrible thing and has come out on top, though struggling still I'm sure, is wonderful! I think it gives us all inspiration to move beyond the things that have held us down or hurt us. This book was a bit more than just Alice's rape- it was about her life, her family, her friends. It didn't overwhelm you with too much dialogue or pure reflection on the rape. This book is really a story. It's simple and pure. A read that I think I'm a bit better for.
B00009RGBS|2.0|Awarded an Oscar for best picture, I really expected much more-perhaps that is why I was so disapointed. Keep in mind I didn't see this in the theater, and when it came to video I didn't see it right away either. So I had to hear about how great it was for eight months, and when I finally watched it last week, as you can imagine I was highly disappointed!     I suppose the days of those fabulous, heart-warming musicals, that you can't help but love, and when no one is listening, sing along with, are over. Recently, however, there was a more than pleasant revival of the musical age with the release of \\"Moulin Rouge\\" which, by the way is one of my favorite movies, and one that I will be giving due credit to in an upcoming review.     I really do wish that I could do the same for \\"Chicago\\". I really wanted to like it. But.... I just could'nt. besides tolerably good acting from Renee Zellwegger, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, I really don't think Jone's Oscar was deserved. she is good, but the actual \\"acting\\" is cut very short by her song and dance sequences, and her limited role. Richard Gere was Richard Gere. In reality nothing could really be expected of him, but foolishly I thought that this would be his coming-of-age, so to speak, performance. It was not, his acting was but a mere trifle, and there is no other way to describe his musical numbers, than by the words annoying and intrusive. The other musical sequences were good, but very much short of phenomenal. In short they were entertaining, but I'm terribly sorry that that wasn't enough.
B00005JLRT|2.0|I consider myself a true Star trek fan. I have followed to evolution of the series ever since i started to watch television (about 25 years ago). I always have seen it as more than an entertaining show but as a way of projecting my mind into the imagination. I have found this in every episode, some more than others. Even Insurrection is very exciting although poor in some aspects. But Nemesis is the worst possible contribution to the whole experience. As a Star Trek fan I can't help but watching it over and over again, and to look for something that will change my mind but I always come back to the conclusion that it is the most stupid story of all. There is no subplot, unless you consider B-4 a new story. The Picard revealing of his innerself is so weak and boring that I feel regret of ever admiring the man. There are so many plot sequences that are completly irrelevant that slows the story and action sequences that are plain dumb. I give it a second star because of the visual effects but I would prefer Star Trek V anytime.<BR>About the DVD edition, you can enjoy more the plot after watching the deleted scenes, especially about the Reman and Romulan alliance and their plans. But the audio commantary is only informative in a technical level and it doesn't enhance your perception at all about the story. And the interviews are too positive and fake.<BR>Nemesis ultimatly kills TNG and dosen't give me any hope about new Star Trek devellopments. It seems that Star Trek has become a buraucratic empire who doesn't offer more than American Junk culture and is out there just to try to compete with those horrible new Star Wars movies and to make a few bucks.<BR>I wonder what happened to Ronald D. Moore, Michael Piller, Branon Braga and those who brought an ounce of vision to Star Trek.
6300208591|3.0|It lacks a plot.  I almost fell asleep during the first half.  It picked up during the 2nd half when the main character ran into his father.  That was interesting for me, for personal reasons.  But, having just watched it, all I can say is that it left me with an emtpy, hollow feeling.   If that was the point, then the movie is quite successful.  Mind you, I'm not the usual \\"simplistic\\" movie watcher.  But that was my feeling...
B000002KOO|4.0|I purchased this when it was released ... way back when vinyl ruled - but the CD hasn't got the crackly bits in the silent parts of &quot;Oh Well&quot;. <BR>This was recorded when Fleetwood Mac was still a band of integrity rather than a slave to pop. Sure, some people find a couple of these tracks an acquired taste - but they grow on you... Personally I never had that problem - this is a wonderful album - musical, exciting, nostalgic. <BR>It reminds me of pool games and pork chops in the old Morning Star Hotel (alas, long since a victim to the demolition ball), and long drives in my old side-valve Humber ... But more than that, it reminds me of an era of good, honest music. Buy this one - you can't go wrong!
B00007L4LL|5.0|This is a fantastic movie about a Duke from another Century and an Executive who cross the barriers of time and find each other.<br />It makes you realize how different people from other centuries act compared to today's society.  Kate and Leopold are inseparable and find meaning to their lives after finding each other.  Leopold is graceful, polite and well dressed and enters a society that has become too laid back as far as dress and manners are concerned.<br />This is a very good romantic comedy.  A must see for anyone!<br />It is definitely a movie that we needed in our time to take us back to a more simpler, slower time.  Everything is so fast paced in today's society, that we do not have time or take time to really enjoy life to its fullest.<br />I wish they would do a sequel to this movie.  It is definitely one that deserves to get a lot of praise for its costumes, acting and music.  I have the soundtrack.  The music is wonderful to listen to.  It takes you back in time.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I'm a big Maynard James Keenan fan. Tool is one of my all time favorite bands. When I heard he was creating a new project called A Perfect Circle I won't lie to you I was somehow a little leery of it. I was mainly just hoping it wouldn't be another Tool or something like that. Thankfully it wasn't and Mer De Noms was a beautiful, dark and mind blowing masterpiece of an album. almost 3 years later, they have released the follow-up, Thirteenth Step...and....well I'll just be blunt with you on this; if you loved Mer De Noms and thought it couldn't be topped...well you're dead wrong my friend. This album is somewhat of a step forward, as they have definitely expanded on their sound and are still very much experimental on this record. The sound quality alone is godlike. Everything is just right where it should be, drums, bass, guitar, vocals, etc. And sounds great if you have a high quality stereo with some nice subs in it because the bass on this cd will shake your f***ing walls like no other. Bottom line, if you love MJK like myself and so many others, go buy this cd NOW.
B00005KHJM|5.0|Many of the reviews have detailed the plot, so I won't.  I haven't even received the DVD yet, however, I often rented this film, until the tape broke and no other rental store had a copy.  If you are used to the blood and gore, slice and dice 'em  movies, you won't see that here.  It is pure suspense, clever twists, subtly erotic, psychologically compelling, and great story-telling.  Wicker Man is cagey as it pulls you in, haunting your memory for years to come.  Truly a classic.
B00005QW5X|1.0|This is, without a doubt, the worst movie I have ever seen.  Aside from lacking completely in worthwhile dialogue and storyline, this movie is blunt and disturbing for the sheer sake of it!  I don't understand why this movie ever go past step pre-production.  Unless you feel the need to be horribly repulsed and to enjoy pissing away your money, do not even consider this horrible excuse for a movie!

B00005JL78|4.0|&quot;Minority Report&quot; is a gripping drama about preventing murder before it happens. Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, a police captain who works for the &quot;Precrime&quot; division of the police department in Washingto D.C. in the year 2054. Because of the Precrime experiment/department, there has not been one murder in D.C. in six years. Three humans who are kept in liquid called &quot;precogs&quot; have visions of crimes that are about to happen. Anderton and his collegues then use that information to prevent murders all over the city. This procedure seems foolproof until Anderton realizes that he is next in line to murder someone. The tables turn.<br />&quot;Minority Report&quot; is a futuristic film that doesn't bore you with a lot of scientific jargon or far-fetched ideas. The thought of murders being prevented alone draws you into this film. Steven Spielberg does an excellent job of showing a futuristic Washington D.C. without it looking fake and silly. The story will also keep you glued. There is the obvious story of the precrime division, a backstory regarding Anderton's son who was kidnapped and has been missing for the past 6 years, and the story of Anderton trying to figure out why he is going to kill someone he has never met. Believe me, this movie will keep you glued to the screen!<br />I would highly recommend this film. Not only is is visually interesting, but the story and performances are incredible!
0553801511|5.0|this book immediately swallows me up into the six duchies. Even if I only ready 5 or 10 minutes in traffic, I am overwhelmed and interested. However, I want to shake Fitz and tell him not to be so damned negative. Perhaps it is being an assassin makes you so. I have not met such a frustrating character since the leprosy-ridden hero of samuel donaldson's and I read all 6 of those books. Please solve the problem and finish this trilogy. Why can't he meet Nettle and bring Swift to court as a friend to Dutiful. Why is everything wrong? Is the fool a woman or what?  I am reading it the third time very slowly but am still confused. Why won't he talk to the dragon-man?  Maybe he would learn something. Idiot - see how angry it gets me - it must be excellent
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This album is very interesting and alluring.  To me, it's the kind of album that grows on you fast because you don't know where it's going to turn and that satisfied me greatly because that proves that Maynard still has plenty of tricks up his sleeve.  It also tided me over until the next Tool album is released, whenever that will be since Tool and APC make music that are in the same strain of consciousness.  It was better than &quot;Mer de Noms&quot;, but not as good as &quot;Lateralus&quot;.  In my opinion, &quot;13th Step&quot;, &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; by Radiohead, and the Underworld soundtrack are the best albums that have been released in the past few months, and I hope to see APC in concert sometime soon, if I can beat the damn scalpers!
B0000AMRJC|3.0|..who are wondering what &quot;Gangsta Rap&quot; has to do with Scarface..<BR>  <BR>First of all, when many critics and the public slammed this movie when it came out in 1983, it seemed to enjoy a massive cult following on video in the late 80's, mainly with young, urban rap and hip-hop fans. One of my early jobs years ago was in a popular video store, and we couldn't keep Scarface in the store. In my opinion, if this movie DIDN'T enjoy a second life through video<BR>cult-status, this re-issue wouldv'e NEVER happened (or at least the hype and buzz wouldn't be this large) <BR>Regardless of what many think of the rap/ hip-hop community, Mr. De Palma, Mr. Stone, and Mr. Pacino owes a great deal of gratitude to them.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|This is Maynard, so I knew to expect a departure of style, however i was not anticipating this.  This album is in no way, shape, or form going to rock your socks off, and it is not in my opinion as good as Mer de Noms, but it is very good.  The soft style of this album is a pleasant change, it was, however, not what i was expecting.  I plunked this CD into my car stereo and turned it up ready to listen to maynard rock, but instead got the funky intro beat of &quot;the package&quot;.  &quot;okay, this is kinda cool&quot; i thought, then the guitar kicked in and everything was good.  Weak and Powerless rocks, and is what i was expecting for the rest of the CD, but it is far from it.  The vocal style is the most obvious change, as well as the song transitions, which are good, but not as good as Mer de Noms (in which the transitions were awesome, i still cant listen to a singular song off that album without listening to the rest of it).  The cahnge from Mer de Noms to Thirteenth step is much like Aenima to Lateralus.<br />So to sum up my horribly disorganized review for this CD: you must throw away your expectations, sit down in your rom with the lights low, put on your headphones and just listen, this CD is awesome, and i a pleasant departure of style.

0375703764|4.0|This book has an incredible ability to get inside your head.  I spent many nights (because the book is long..and sometimes ponderous) staring into dark corners wondering could be hiding there.  The story moves along steadily and has only a few dragging chapters.  Read this one when you have some time to devote to it.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Very haunting music that stays in your head. Their music is like a big secret....you gotta listen to more and more to find out what the secret is...but the thing is, when the song is comming to an end...they don't reveal anything... it's f-ing crazy...and hard to explain....this is a great CD and everything they have is great...so go and buy it and also go see them live...they are EXTREMELY GOOD
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Perfect Circle..truely is a perfect band..if your a maynard keenan fan this is a must have.
0375757295|5.0|Persuasion is a very good book.  It's slower than the contemporary novel, which is to be expected (it is nearly 200 years old, after all).  Like all of Austen's other novels, it is of course a social commentary.  It's a story of delayed love and patience.  It's been called her 'most romantic.'  The idea of the old love, Captain Wentworth, coming back after years apart and both parties still being in love IS very romantic, but I disagree with it being her most romantic.  It's a very sweet story, and also pretty straightforward.  It was a lot of fun to read, and a good story.
0452282152|4.0|A friend recommended to me that I read Girl in Hyacinth Blue, another book about a Vermeer painting.  I was very disappointed.  Unlike the latter, Girl with a Pearl Earring is a treasure.  I was captivated by the characters in the novel, and could actually visualize the paintings as Griet, ( the main character) was describing.  For anyone that has read this book, and loved it as much as I did, or are interested in reading it, I have a suggestion:  GO TO CHEVALIER'S WEBSITE!!!  All the Vermeer paintings mentioned in the novel are shown.  It was so amazing to see the paintings that were described so brilliantly in the novel.  Chevalier's novel has not only made me a fan of her writing, but also Vermeer's paintings.  Please read this, your won't regret it.  Oh... and try and read it before mid November, because then you will be able to see it on the big screen!!!
B0000C7PSW|5.0|I've been a diehard Rufus fan for a while, and I'm constantly amazed at his ability to perfect and perform so many styles of music. <BR>There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said, except that if you buy this album and let it grow on you, you will be forever grateful. <BR>This album makes me laugh, cry, and smile. I adore it.
B000002GFC|4.0|This is good intro to the band but once you have this &amp; you know you dig the band, either burn a copy and sell it off, keep it as a compilation sampler or give it to a friend because you need to get all their essential albums: Fresh, Disraeil Gears, Wheels of Fire plus Live Cream volumes 1 &amp; 2 &amp; Live at the BBC(Goodbye is the weakest album &amp; the only one you may skip, but hey if you're getting most of them, you might as well complete the colleciton). This is because, though you'll get a lot of repeats, any one great song of Cream in its famous 2 year late '60s heydey is easily worth the price of 2 albums &amp; there are more than enough of these on the original albums. For example, the awesome live Drum solo &quot;Toad&quot; on WOFire. How can anyone who likes Cream do without that? Impossible! Or the incredible Live version of &quot;Sleepy Time&quot; with Clapton's best solo ever. forgeddaboutit! You gotta have it, it rules! Or the mind-fizzling live version of NSU with that amazing jam in the middle? Or the 3 great songs &quot;World of Pain&quot; &quot;Dance the Night Away&quot; &amp; &quot;Outside Woman Blues&quot; on DGears, not on this comp? Gotta have it, they're each 3 minutes of the kind of musicianship &amp; magical inspiration hardly ever duplicated by anyone else for 35 years.<br />Also, once you're done with the Cream albums, check out the solo Jack Bruce stuff which sounds a lot more like Cream than post-Cream Clapton. &quot;Songs For A Tailor&quot; has many awesome songs such as &quot;Rope Ladder to the Moon&quot; &quot;Theme For An Imaginary Western&quot; &amp; &quot;He the Richmond&quot; that were written originally for Cream albums. &quot;Harmony Row,&quot; Jack's masterpiece from 1971 sounds like a more progressive &amp; folksy Cream album minus Clapton. I am amazed that all these Cream fans have not turned on to &quot;Harmony Row&quot; as great as that album is! Even as late as 1978 Jack was writing awesome Cream-like songs on his solo albums with Pete Brown: &quot;Jet Set Jewel&quot; &amp; &quot;The Best is Yest to Come&quot; come to mind. Check all of those out, you won't be sorry.<br />As for Ginger Baker, his best post-Cream albums are a collaboration with Fela Kuti called Africa '70 &amp; the great jazz fusio album &quot;Going Home&quot; with Bill Frisell &amp; Charlie Haden.<br />peace outsolo albums with Pete Brown: &quot;Jet Set Jewel&quot; &amp; &quot;The Best is Yest to Come&quot; come to mind.

B000067JBN|2.0|It would be refreshing to see a movie that honored its literary heritage.  This is not that movie.<br />It's surprising how many people think that this production follows the general storyline of &quot;The Time Machine,&quot; by H.G. Wells.  If anything, it maintains the *skeleton* of the novel's story.  And a rotted and broken skeleton at that.  It's also ironic that there's a slight resentment toward the movie for 'preaching.'  What this movie 'preaches' is paltry compared to Well's indicting social commentary.<br />Make a movie without the Time Traveler having a love interest - how about the genius inventor travels through time solely because of intellectual curiosity rather than sentimentalism?  Give subtitles for the Eloi's speech, and let us watch the Time Traveler learn it.  Better yet, don't give subtitles *until* the TT learns it.  This story was originally meant to primarily convey a social message, not an attempt at a love story set in a sci-fi setting with a dash of, of all things, ethnic mumbo jumbo.  <br />Rigidly adhering to the novel might not provide quite enough material for a feature length movie, so why not (as this version did do) expand upon the TT stops throughout time?  We don't need new subplots, just brief glimpses into other worlds.  <br />Maybe such a movie wouldn't sell.  Oh well.
B000002H33|5.0|Listening to Master of Puppets it is very sad to see where Metallica and metal music in general went from here. This is the height of 80's metal. This is the only Metallica CD I own, although Ride the Lightning and Kill em all were very good. I burned out on those albums, but this one never gets old. Orion may be the greatest instumental ever. Not only did metallica die when Cliff Burton died, but the evolution of metal turned to de-evolution and now we're left with garbage like St.Anger and the other nu-metal. It makes anyone who grew up in the 80's metal days very sad.
B00008DDHZ|5.0|Lets keep in mind this was done by a British film crew, and financed by British money, but I did find the story to be extraordinarily even handed and historically accurate.  This message board is not supposed to be a debating forum for Unionists vs. Republicans it is to review the movie and judge it on its merits.  And anyone attacking the movie on any other basis is doings so purely out of political motivation.  This movie is extremely accurate and does convey the conditions, despair and sentiment of the time in Derry and the whole of Northern Ireland in the 70's.  It masterfully tells the tail of 800 years of British presence in Ireland in the limited confines of a 2 hour DVD.  <br />The movie hardly serves as a rallying point for the Republican cause as some reviewers here wrongfully assert, the act itself took care of that.  The movie merely depicts that specific moment in time and tells it's tale in an extremely unbiased and even handed way.  Bravo.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|This movie was far better then the movie gross makes you think.  I saw it twice thanks to going with two different friends.  I didn't mind one bit, I'll be buying the DVD the day it comes out.  The nice range in actors and the great performances they gave made you care about the movie and plot more.  Seth Green gave a standout performance compared to the Austin Powers movies.  I look forward to seeing it again.
0385504209|5.0|Having read Holy Blood, Holy Grail and other similar books, I found The Da Vinci Code vastly entertaining.  Dan Brown built a story around a theory that I liken to a legend or myth, or even a consider to be a conspiracy theory.  Dan Brown gives it more academic credit in the book than I think the theory deserves, but that's part of the story.  Some readers discredit him for not having his &quot;facts&quot; right, e.g. YHWH and &quot;Q&quot;.  For those readers I suggest, either they redo their homework or realize that &quot;facts&quot;, especially historical &quot;facts&quot;, have an innate illusory element to them.<br />I enjoyed the wild ride in this book, and I recommend it to others who like mystery, action and a little mental candy.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|I'm only 16 and it amazes me how many people my age of never heard of Judy Garland, who is my favorite actress.  I love this movie!  I have watched it ever since I was little.  Me and my Grandpa would always sing the meet me in st louis song.  It is an awesome movie and I would love to have it on DVD!
B00008X5J1|5.0|Scorsese's \\"Gangs of New York\\" is a sweeping epic of historic fiction as well as a magnificently crusty film. The recreation of the mangy Five Points sector of old New York coupled with the authenticity of costumes, makeup and other sets offers a genuine smorgasbord for the eyes. A smorgasbord that has been dumped in the dirt and stepped on a few times - but an undeniable visual delight none the less. Aside from this amazing attention to detail the film also offers a stellar cast with excellent performances by one and all. Daniel Day-Lewis, however, is by leaps and bounds the obvious standout in this group. His portrayal of the despicable and bloodthirsty Bill \\"The Butcher\\" Cutting is one of the most bone chilling I have seen on film since Anthony Hopkins' first gave us the shark-eyed Hannibal Lector. This epic gives us a peek into a very dark and desperate time in the city's history - a time I am very happy not to have lived through. Set before and during the Civil War, it tells the tale of the effects of poverty on both downtrodden immigrants and the so-called \\"native born\\" American citizens. We see their struggle to keep their heads above water as they daily deal with the effects of pig-headed prejudice and injustice in world that is so violent, bloody and squalid that it makes most of our lives look like life in a palace. Though it is based on actual riots and problems of the time, the story probably had as many facts involved as the tales found in \\"Titanic\\" and \\"Braveheart\\". But, since my main purpose for going to the theater is to be entertained, like the two above mentioned films, \\"Gangs of New York\\" certainly did not disappoint.
0671027344|4.0|I'll admit at first I was a bit put off by the overall &quot;sweetness&quot; of the main character, who I felt was created as a &quot;sympathetic&quot; movie-character fabrication (he loves his mom, loves his dad, loves his sister, loves his brother...it made me roll my eyes, seeing how &quot;good&quot; and &quot;nice&quot; this boy was; not since Leave It To Beaver have I seen such a &quot;goodness&quot; portrayed), but in the end the book won me over -- and I was moved by it. And that's what counts. The novel works! The only other book to affect me this way, despite my early misgivings, was The Losers' Club by Richard Perez. In much the same way the protagonist of that book was portrayed as a &quot;good guy,&quot; a hapless loser -- and I couldn't get into it until the last half. There, too, I was finally affected by the main character -- and the book as whole. So you never know until the end. I say this to anyone reading The Perks of Being a Wallflower  -- hang in there. I guarantee you'll be moved by this novel!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A few days back I posted my intial reactions to the new album. This review here is to give my thoughts on the album as a whole and how it affects and effects me. This album surpases my expectations. I have been longing for an album for sometime (Since Tool's Lateralus) that would conjur up images and feelings the way Thirteenth Step has. At times tragic, and other times hopeful, I feel that Thirteenth Step will set a precedent. The album takes me to a place deep within my soul and captures feelings that barely break through the surface. Like a vampire's kiss, this album leaves you with the desire for more. It's like a sweet drug that provides you with a high that cannot be compared. It takes you on a ride into your soul only to emerge hopefully. It takes you past this level and onto the next step, the Thirteenth Step. The one that will push you beyond
B00000K19E|5.0|I really like this movie. When it first came out it was like nothing else. Especially since alot of the movie was set in virtual reality. But even though it was a very technical movie it also had a lot of human elements. It had Neo dealing with becoming The One, Trinity dealing with her love for Neo, and the whole human race dealing with slavery (although most didn't know it). Even my friends who do not like science fiction, like this movie.
B0000AZJXQ|2.0|Got it this morning. I thought it might be as good as the last one but instead I nearly fell asleep. (at work)<BR>Not impressed. I hope it grows on me!
079284632X|3.0|&quot;Last House On The Left&quot;, is grim, violent, and depressing. The way in which this movie was filmed, along with the acting, and the events which is supposed to be taken from true events, left me sick. A film like this one is called a &quot;Snuff Film&quot;, and not a Slasher Flick, like &quot;Nightmare On Elm Street&quot;.<br />I remember this movie when it first came out. I don't want to ever see it again. If you love your family members and have a queasy stomach for sadistic, violence and seeing no hope for your family to fight and survive, then pass this booger up.
B00008NG5V|5.0|Great disc for chilling out with friends, hanging alone thinking, partying... in other words it really is anytime feel-good music.  I love it!
0385504209|1.0|The first half of the book is well-written and very interesting.  Beyond that, I couldn't finish what I thought was a great thriller.  In good conscience, I couldn't keep reading beyond the blasphemy of Christianity and my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.  I sent my copy to the dump.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|A new Enigma record has finally arrived.  But this one is unlike any other you've ever heard.  Enigma has evolved past using samples and chants.  And the result is incredible!  This could easily be the best album Enigma has done.  It defines Enigma, setting them apart from other ambient bands.  The new sound is fresh and modern, sounding nothing like new age and more like electronica.  As the first album since the greatest hits package, you'd expect it to open a new chapter to Enigma's music.  Here's a track-by-track.<br />FROM EAST TO WEST - Opens up with a piano.  Very peaceful sounding.  The piano part then ends beautifully with the familiar Enigma intro.  But that intro very quickly fades into a haunting trance song that sounds very reminiscent of Michael Cretu's side-project, Trance Atlantic Air Waves. Here it becomes clear that you will not hear the Enigma we've grown used to.   A great beginning to this voyage.<br />VOYAGEUR - This is the album's first single.  An aquatic guitar gently begins this track before a funky bassline takes over.  You hear Cretu sing, although it's unclear whether he's actually saying something or not.  Then Sandra's whispers take over &quot;Viens chez moi, Voyageur&quot;.   There's a short break, then begins again.  Very chic sound.<br />INCOGNITO - Very unusual track.  The intro sounds like something from Jean-Michel Jarre, then hard beats take over with Cretu's vocals deep in the background. There is a heavy electronic sound to this.  This is more reminiscent of Cretu's early solo work. Again, very modern sound. <br />PAGE OF CUPS - This is a very peaceful song.  Soft beats and a tiny distortion encompass the entire track.  Sandra comes in a few minutes in with some French whispers.  It's a little repetitive, but the beat will undoubtedly hook you.  <br />BOUM-BOUM - I love this song.  Probably my favorite on here.  It starts out with a nice beat, followed by Ruth-Ann's sultry vocals.  After she sings, Andru Donalds takes over andthe fierce beat begins!  I adore the lyrics!  I'd love for this to be the second single.  This is such a great song!<br />TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE MOON - A short sweet track.  Vocals by Michael Cretu and nothing but synthesized strings accompanying his voice.  Two short verses and it's over.<br />LOOK OF TODAY - This is a perfect club track.  Enigma has never done a song like this before.  It's wonderfully put together.  The vocals kick in, and I wish they weren't so distorted.  Another classic moment in Enigma's history.  <br />IN THE SHADOW, IN THE LIGHT - A very sweet song.  The tender lyrics really need to be heard! The music is nice though and the beat sounds like the one on &quot;Enigmatic Encounter&quot; by ATB and Enigma. Andru Donalds voice is great. <br />WEIGHTLESS - Ok, this song took me a couple of listens, but I finally find it fascinating.  It's very short and very abstract.  But the seemingly random notes in the background balance this track perfectly with Cretu's vocals.  If I had to compare it to another track, it'd be &quot;The Voice and The Snake&quot; from MCMXC a.D., only a bit more musical.   <br />THE PIANO - This track is so beautiful it gives me chills just thinking about it.  It's an instrumental chillout track with a piano as it's main instrument.  This song lifts you up and down.  It's amazing.<br />FOLLOWING THE SUN - This is a PERFECT ending to this record.  Ruth-Ann's vocals are mesmerizing, then Cretu jumps in with a chant for the climactic chorus.  The song finishes and is taken over with a creepy, mysterious ending that quietly fades away into nothingness.   Awesome!<br />    All in all, an Enigma fan will love this record.  Causal fans might be disappointed because it's clear now that Enigma is a new band.  Gone forever are the familiar chants and pan-flutes.  In fact, the only sample (besides the intro) from previous Enigma music is a meek &quot;Sade, dit moi. Sade, donne moi&quot; thrown in there for good measure (on &quot;Incognito&quot;). A great album!  Enjoy!!!
B000089RVR|5.0|Very cool. Life for Rent represents a new statement in electronica and global music. The second release from DIDO.
B00005U11Z|4.0|I am a Journey fan since 10-15 years ago, so I really looked forward to this DVD. The sound and picture is great, and Steve Perry's replacement mr. Augieri does a fine job, doing all the classic songs justice. The new songs are good, too. The band itself plays ok, but Neal Schons soloing is not as strong as on for instance Captured, he often looses his way and ends up in pointless blurry &quot;too fast for his chops&quot; w**king on his PRS. His guitar used to sound clearer too, it's quite muddy here.<BR>The saving grace is Deen castronovo, who breathes new life into the songs, his drumming is quite sensational, those favouring Steve Smith in other rewievs here must be getting nostalgic, as Deen blows him away, no question about that.<BR>Anyway, well worth the money and a must for all journey fans
B0000CABJ1|5.0|Universal has released an updated Greatest Hits package from the Queen of Dance, Donna Summer. Even though in my opinion other collections such as &quot;The Donna Summer Anthology&quot; and the upcoming &quot;Ultimate Collection&quot; are far more complete, this is a nice collection to have since it includes a retrospective of her work from Love to Love You to her Grammy nominated song from 1999 &quot;I will go with you&quot; (this is the dance version of Bocceli's great song &quot;Com te partiro&quot;).<br />This collection also features a bonus disc with the 12&quot; versions of some of Donna's great dance floor hits PLUS three new songs: &quot;Dream a lot's theme&quot; which is a great dance song showcasing Donna's powerful vocals, &quot;You're so Beautiful&quot; the great dance anthem of the summer, finally available on CD and a great new song &quot;That's the way&quot; in which Donna appears both sexy and playful with a reggae style rhythm which is delightful to listen to.<br />This album is a must for serious Donna fans since it has new songs and for everyone else, it's a great compilation that will keep the party going. All songs are remastered editions, which is an added treat for the fans. In my opinion, &quot;That's the way&quot;  is a great song that is very radio-friendly and should put Donna Summer back on the spotlight.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I live for music. While on my never-ending search for good tunes, i came across an E.P. by this band, several years before of the release of 'is this it', to say the least, it blew me away. When the album came out i immediately purchased it and have been listening to it ever since. New York-brorn The Strokes have a great sound and the producing on this record is excellent!!!
0312305060|5.0|I LOVED this novel, not only for its beautifully interwoven stories, but for the depth of its writing.  The title is subtle and curious, yet so specific to the book. Michael Cunningham truly has captured \\"moments in time\\"-those instantaneous thoughts which often pass through the mind too quickly to acknowledge, that minute world between the semi-conscious and recognition. As with Ms. Woolf's writing, life is fully realized, and the reader is left with eyes open and senses acute.  Unique and thought-provoking!
B00008PW2D|2.0|The 5th series was fun and short but will not be in my DVD collection at this price.  Seems a bit steep for such a short season in contrast to other offerings.
0385491026|5.0|Never before has the pain and laughter of childhood been illustrated with such unique and yet accurate detail, at least for this reader.  Atwood's writing is impeccable as she weaves a past-and-present story with fluidity and style, and ingeniously blends dark humor into serious themes.  The novel is both poignant and bitingly funny, thanks to Atwood's insight, wit, and her ability to create characters who are hauntingly alive.  An outstanding reflection on the consequences of human behavior.
0060245867|5.0|Our little boy is absolutely in love with all of the \\"If you\\" books! He wants to read all of them every night before bed. He is having a great time memorizing the next item or action that the story presents! If you buy a child this book, he/she will probably want them all!  PS: My husband loves this book too...I think he enjoys reading it to our son more than the boy loves hearing it!
078681859X|4.0|I read this book as a pre-pub and haven't stopped talking about it since.  If you are looking for a book that has some of the charm of the Harry Potter series and some of the wonder of the  Pullman (His Dark Materials) series you could do no better than this book.  It offers readers (young and old) a very refreshing bit of fantasy mixed with a liberal dose of humor.  The first character you meet is a deliciously dramatic dijin named Bartimaeus. His \\"take\\" on events is delightful (and occasionally disgruntled) and offers a very nice contrast with the \\"human\\" voice.  I highly recommend this book.  I look forward to the future installments.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|This album blew me away. I bought it because I thought it was funny how &quot;metal!!!!&quot; they were trying to be and it was cheap because I bought a complimentary copy. But I'm so glad I bought it. It's such an amazing mix of hardcore, guitar metal, speed metal, nu (sucky) metal and punk. It's just amazing.<br />I never thought it could be this good.
B000089RVR|5.0|After a long wait, I finally got to listen to this incredible CD on the way to work today. Outstanding is the word to describe it. &quot;Life for Rent&quot; is one of the best songs on the CD and in my opinion, will be the next single :) Dido's music is such a breath of fresh air from the music heard today...
0805017445|5.0|It's no wonder this book is a children's classic. It's got a wonderful rhythm that makes it easy for children to learn their colors. The artwork is beautiful, too. This is one of my children's favorite books.
B00000IAU3|5.0|This album is super; it couldn't be any better. Every song is good, and you won't want to skip over any of them. If your thinking about buying this album, you deffnately should!
0060930187|5.0|One of the reviewers here stated &quot;Plath should have spent a little more time working out the ending.&quot;  The ending of the book was, of course, dictated by her own circumstances.  The ending of Plath herself, however, is indeed something one wishes she had spent a little more time working out.
B00006RU5B|3.0|I like this band fine, don't get me wrong.  The instruments all have that distinctive rage against the machine quality that everyone can recognize.  Unfortunately, this gets taken away from by the vocals of Chris Cornell (formerly of soundgarden).  The guy has a good voice, but it just isn't THAT good.  Sometimes he is singing with a very listenable almost aaron lewis mixed with kurt cobain quality.  However, other times, the man sounds like he has a freaking cat lodged in his throat.  This is some good grunge and i listen to it every now and then, but it doesn't give me the same thrill that rage against the machine did (i was never much of a fan of soundgarden).  Oh well. buy it. or don't.  Some standout tracks on here are &quot;like a stone&quot;, &quot;show me how to live&quot;, and &quot;gasoline&quot;. have fun.
B000089RVX|4.0|I got this CD from a friend on my birthday last summer and as soon as I looked at the cover I was filled with uneasiness. The cover scared me a little, I have to admit. But as soon as I started listening to the songs I was hooked! I listen to it whenever I can, though some lyrics and songs are a little strange.  My favorites are &quot;My Immortal&quot; &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; &quot;Going Under&quot; and &quot;Hello.&quot;
B0000C8AVX|5.0|A nice improvement over the original cd release. Good packaging for a landmark album. The first seven tracks are electric, followed by four acoustic tracks. An oustanding album.
B000005IU1|5.0|I love this album. It is the crudest, most raw sounding disc on the planet next to the first Bathory record. I bought this album in 1968 or early 1969 right after it came out. Ron Asheton is one of my guitar heroes. His sound, at least on this album, is crackly, distorted, and simplistic. He admitted in an interview he was still learning how to play when they made this but that is part of the &quot;charm&quot; of this recording. The names of Ron Asheton, Scott Asheton, and Dave Alexander have haunted me for years and it was only recently I was able to come up with any information on them. They ended up like the original Alice Cooper group in that Iggy went on to fame while Ron, Scott, and Dave were pushed aside and basically ignored by all but their hard core fans like me. I only wish Dave had survived for the reunion Ron and Scott had with Iggy recently. This album was not like anything else at the time and I can see where it influenced punk. This record could be considered amateurish by the music snobs but it did exactly what rock and roll should do. Slap you in the face! If you are into the sixties era roots of metal and punk, this album is a ground breaker along with Blue Cheer (among a select few). Highly recommended. Ron, wherever you are, thanks!
B00000F6LQ|5.0|This DVD is great worth the money it is. Bring out your dead. Bring out your dead.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|this album just gets better with time. At first listen, I was a little disappointed that the songs didn't seem to have the musical variety of Poses, BUT after listening to it the second time, and a third, I am haunted by its melodies. I can't wait to get home and listen once again. I can only imagine what it would be like to see him perform live! Rufus is amazing!
B00005JM02|5.0|Seriously, though. Although many movies have been declared (most wrongfully) to be entertainment for the whole family, Finding Nemo delivers. It's funny, entertaining, warm and a heck of a lot more engaging than some of its fellow productions (Disney and otherwise). I saw this film in theaters with several friends (all of whom are over 18) and I can say that we all enjoyed it. Heck, we never agree on anything.<br />Finding Nemo is the story of a clownfish's (Albert Brooks) epic quest to find his son. He traverses a jaw-dropping undersea world that never ceases to amaze visually. Along the way he encounters many colorful characters: a fish with short-term memory loss (Ellen Degeneres) who helps him on his quest, a trio of fish-addicted sharks (the twelve-step program was hilarious), a school of fish voiced by Cheers alum John Ratzenberger (who, ironically, is staying true to his old character as a source of information), whales, seagulls, albatross, and many more. His son, meanwhile, is the latest acquisition of an Australian dentist who bonds with the community of fishes in the aquarium (including Willem Dafoe, Brad Garrett, Eric Bana, Allison Janney). <br />In terms of creating an impressive and convincing landscape, Pixar steps up to the plate once again and hits a home run. Also, there is a rich variety of characters in the film, most of whom are voiced by celebrity talents (most of whom are listed above). The story is standard, but the Pixar team makes it seem fresh and vital. In short, this is one of the 'kiddie' films that I have seen that I would very much like to own on DVD. The extras ought to be impressive too. Highly recommended.
B000002LIX|5.0|I bought this album when it came out. I was living in LA at the time, and this album became my personal soundtrack of the City de Diablos.<br />I would say my favorite part is &quot;Side Two&quot;, if we can still use that term in the age of CDs. It reminds me of something from a lost side of Zeppelin's Physical Graffiti. It's a heavy, slow grind; where each song builds on the previous tune. Except for &quot;Of Course&quot;. That songs seems out of place and quite annoying. Side One has great songs. &quot;Obvious&quot; stands out for me, with that full on wall of sound .&quot;Been Caught Stealing&quot; was the 'hit', but I could take or leave it.<br />Anyway, buy this one for sure. Strays just came out and it depresses me with its lack of substance. But this is a gem; a full bodied, light as lead (or Led) masterpiece.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|3.5 stars, really<br />The Matrix Reloaded was a huge hit that I looked forward to intensely. I had thoroughly enjoyed the first installment and thought that the second would take the story to new dimensions. In some ways, the sequel far outdid the original. In terms of sheer adrenaline and eye-popping action, for instance. The patented bullet-time special effects return, but there's plenty of new eye-candy. The movie also offers even more insight into the Neo mythos. Nevertheless, the movie fails colossally in other areas. One need only mention the Neo-Trinity Romantic Chemistry (I am being ironic, of course: there was no chemistry) and the general self-importance of this more dark and stark film. In any case, what results is a mixed-bag that twists and turns unevenly to its enigmatic (and improbable) denouement.<br />'Reloaded' was a sequel that was destined to be made, and there are many parts of it that sparkle. The car chase scene, which pits Morpheus, Trinity and Co. against a duo of dreadlocked cyber-twins as well as a plethora of agents simultaneously on the 101 highway is one of the most jaw-dropping pieces of film that I have ever had the pleasure to see. It could quite possibly take the mantle as the most intense car chase scene ever. Bullitt, French Connection, I'm sorry, but your days on the throne are over. The sequence goes on for over 15 minutes, but it doesn't drag at all (unlike other parts). In fact, I would have liked plenty more. Another highlight is Anthony Zerbe's small role as a civil administrator in Zion. He added a nice bit of introspection into a movie that sometimes lacked it. The film had a number of fascinating secondary characters, including the keymaker, the mirolyngion (I have no idea how to spell it), the Architect (\\"God\\") and others. Speaking of the architect, his scene was the movie's most intriguing. He spoke so fast in some sort of mathspeak but he had a magnetic presence on the screen and his character remained a delightful mystery. Hugo Weaving was once again wonderful as renegade Agent Smith (although the much advertised fight scene with Neo against an army of Smiths was too long).<br />That seemed to be the central problem with this film. The Wachowskis, who had created a perfectly-paced action film in The Matrix, seemed to lose focus in some of the fight scenes. Most of them, while plenty mesmerizing, go on for far too long. The pacing of the film itself is uneven, the movie starts, then stops for exposition, then starts up again. The Zion sequence is much too long (seeing a pattern?) and the 'rave' scenes are repetivive and gratuitous. Trinity and Neo are not at all convincing as a couple, perhaps less convincing than that venerable couple from Star Wars, episode 2: Darth Vader and the Queen; even less convincing than Hemingway's duo in A Farewell to Arms. At least in the other two they said that they loved each other, however unconvincingly. I never for a second believed that Neo, with all his responsibility for his race, would give it all up for the girl, and this greatly hurt the film in my mind. Speaking of Neo, Keanu Reeves loses the tolerability, okay, likeability that he had in the first installment. He is cold as ice all the way through, no emotion or passion evident. And even more annoying was his continued flying. He became a deus ex machina whenever anyone was in peril, spending more time in midair than spouting meaningful dialogue. Too bad. All the way up to the supposedly cliffhanger ending he just seemed like he had lost touch with the character.<br />In short, this is a film that took some risks, some of which worked out and some of which didn't. The movie was entertaining, of course, and philosophically interesting (albeit less so than its predecessor), yet its characters don't quite come alive the same way. The producers just didn't know when to say when throughout the film, and as a result the movie seems somewhat bloated. It does, however, work as a film and as asequel and is definitely worth checking out.
B0000542DJ|1.0|Oh my goodness this is a bad film. There aren't any gnomes. What in the world!?!?!?!? Show me the money! watch jerry miguire instead. It is more truthful to the jfk assassination than this movie.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I normally don't read reviews and never thought I'd be writing one because what I like is a matter of my own experiences and is a very personal thing. I definitely don't expect to influence anyone's decision to buy the album, however I believe in supporting musicians who I feel have a lot to offer to everyone.  A Perfect Circle's message is a strong one (especially backed by Maynard's powerful lyrics), I hope there are many people out there who are open to receiving it!
B00005B36H|5.0|when i became a tool fan, it was when before Lateralus came out.  i had the others and thought that aenima was the greatest and could never be surpassed.  when i got lateralus i was impressed, by the music and lyrics alike, but thought it was nothing compared to aenima.  after listening to it over and over, i realized that lateralus blows aenima out of the water. it's lyrics are smarter and more intricate, while its music is crisper and fresher.  especially the song lateralus.  i could listen to that song nonstop for the rest of my life and not get bored.  without a doubt lateralus is better.  sadly, however, chances are tool will never top it (if they even make another record) becaue it was so unbelievably great and centuries before its time.
B000066JES|1.0|After song number one, I thought this will be a good album... ahah! it's a joke, the worst album ever. From song 2 to 8, it's kind of a joke, is it heavy metal, I don't think so! Don't by this album, unless your never heard this band and you like opera. I can't even think how a true fan can give this album a 5 stars. I gave 1 star and if I had the choice, I had choose 0 star, or 5 tomatoes. NEVER BUY THIS ALBUM, PLEASE!
B000089RVR|5.0|What a beautiful record! And how nice it is to know that Dido has survived the sophmore curse.<BR>Once again blending an incredibly hushed vocal style, well mixed acoustic and electronic instrumentation, and aggressive yet ethereal lyrics, Dido has achieved hitmaker status with a smart, well conceived and executed project. <BR>Dido knows her strengths - mid-tempo dance ballads dominate this disc. Yet the tunes maintain an air of originality, especially when you consider there isn't a lot of variation to the beat. It's some incredibly twisted lyrics, brilliantly clear production, and the best use of electronic elements (sorry, Bjork and Tracy Thorn) by a female artist.<BR>Every song is excellent, but don't miss the wry lyrics of &quot;Mary's In India&quot;, the great beats used in &quot;See You When You're 40&quot; and some awesome rhythm and effects in &quot;Sand In my Shoes&quot;.
0385504209|1.0|I haven't read Dan Brown before, suspecting that there was little substance vs. style in his writing. However, after seeing this book on the best seller list for so long I gave it a try. Darn it, I was right the first time. As I read, three issues stood out. First, all the research could have been done in two days on the internet. If the author spent more than that, it was not apparent. Second, character development was cartoonish at best. You could not feel sympathetic or engaged in these shades. A cryptologist who can't recognize an anagram? Bah! And finally plot development,as if you could find it. This book is similar to so many others that believe that excessive description will make up for a lame plot with overworked and trite devices. No doubt, Mr. Brown will make more money in the future, try not to let it be yours.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|What a phenominal piece of work!  Rarely do albums come out that completely move me but Thirteenth Step certainly did.  I was not surprised at that, though.  This is a band that i would expect nothing less from.  All the songs have a message and theyre introspective and dark which is a refreshing break amidst the light and happy sounds of the redundant pop world.  If you enjoy songs with cleverly and intelligently written lyrics and uniquely and masterfully composed music, you need this album!
B000000WG4|3.0|None of my friends really like it, but i find this a very inspiring album if you're a musician yourself, and/or interested in recording, due to it's imperfections.
B00001OH7U|5.0|Bowie had one of the longest stretches of creativity, and this album is another in a long line of genius. You'd be hard pressed to find a bad Bowie album after Hunky Dory and before Scary Monsters.<br />Station to Station has got to be one of the coolest things out there. &quot;The return of the Thin White Duke, throwing darts in lover's eyes,&quot; what a line! Every song on this thing is amazing. Word on a Wing and his version of Wild Is the Wind are so heartfelt. Stay, TVC15, and Station to Station just make you want to dance, notice I haven't even mentioned the big 'hit' Golden Years (which is just a great tune).<br />It's always difficult to decide my favourite Bowie album, and it ch-ch-changes from time to time, but I seem to come back to Station to Station. &quot;Said I believe I've been stricken, does my face show some kind of glow?&quot;
B00005N9CV|4.0|I thought The Look of Love was a good c.d.  Personally, I don't believe it was as good as When I look in your eyes but it was still enjoyable.  The title track was a nice rendition of The Look of Love and The night we called it a day was also one of my favorites.  I think Diana Krall is an extraordinary artist and I always enjoy hearing her music.
B00001IVOF|1.0|Anyone that likes this group has missed the boat. Just a bunch of frog heads looking for someone to follow. Get a life instead of filling our prisons up.
B000069AUI|5.0|A beatiful blend of mellow drums, catchy piano tunes, and soft vocals. well worth buying. it makes you think...
B0000C7PQK|4.0|Its been almost 4 years since the last Enigma Album (The Screen Behind The Mirror) so has it been worth the wait?  The answer is yes.<br />Although quite a departure from the past albums Voyageur is true Enigma.  This album has a much more edgy, hard feel to it sometimes but it also has very soft sensual aspects to it as well.  This album is definitely electronic but it is so much different than any other music out there.  The sounds, the vocals, the mixing its all very Enigma and only Michael Cretu could pull these new sounds off and still keep the heart and soul of his baby, Enigma.  Some will dislike the album most will love it.  The sounds are rich, fresh, and innovative.  Enigma broke the mold 13 years ago with the first album (MCMXC aD) and this new album has again raised the bar for music in this decade.  <br />Also the streaming audio samples don't do the songs justice.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|I am not a real &quot;fan&quot; of Ms. Badu, but this is one of the best CD's I have listened to in a while!  I haven't been able to take it out of my rotation and even find myself listening to it at work.  Track 4 is especially captivating.  A wonderful purchase for anyone looking for something new that hasn't left behind what works from back in the day...
B0000AR8NK|3.0|Bowie has always made me realize that personal growth can be a tiring, neverending, sometimes laborous, most times grossly over-rated constitution of life. On 'Reality,' the musical chameleon adapts himself according to fashion and trends once again and brings us his latest reinvention of a musical persona. To my Bowie-loving mind, this album should have been a lot better than it turned out, but that said tracks like &quot;New Killer Star,&quot; &quot;Fall Dog Bombs the Moon&quot; and &quot;Looking For Water&quot; stand out like a house on fire! So to does the inspired cover of the Jonathan Richman song, &quot;Pablo Picasso&quot; which seems to propel Bowie to another level of vocal ability. Personally, my fav recent Bowie album was the engrossing 'Earthling', an album heavily influenced by techno and drum'n'bass, but therein lies my point with regard this new album - it's not influenced by anything and therefore doesn't seem to be able to breathe on it's own. Overall, a great new album from the musical master, but one that begs the question: Where does he go from here and have we got to wait much longer?!
B00006AUIG|4.0|Very few movies disturb me to the point of actually making me too uncomfortable to turn off the lights in my house. This is one of those movies.<br />I have always felt the truly scariest of movies, are the ones that leave a lot up to the viewers imagination. It's most often what you DON'T see that ends up being the most frightening .<br />This movie tells the story of a group of 4 men, hired to remove hazordous material from an abandoned insane asylum. Each of these men have their own reasons for being there, and the first half of &quot;Session 9&quot; goes about explaining what they are, through various subtle and not so subtle clues. There's the failed lawyer who becomes obsessed with listening to old tapes of therapy sessions with a woman named Mary and her 3 alter-personalities. Then there is the lottery-ticket obsessed Hank who thinks he's found his &quot;escape plan&quot; buried deep inside the tunnels of the asylum. David Caruso's character is hard-working, but you can't help but think he's hiding his own secrets. Gordon...the leader of the group is the hardest character to figure out. You are shown flashbacks that make you suspect that something horrible has happened in his life recently, but you're not sure exactly what until very near the end.<br />The plot is a bit slow-moving at first, but it succeeds in drawing you in, and making you want to know what exactly is driving these characters. and there is the asylum. The aspect of the film that disburbed me more then anything else...without giving too much away...is what ends up happening to the Hank character. The scenes of him running down the shadow-filled tunnels, and subsequent re-emergence of his character later in the film left me feeling incredibly uneasy. that is the one thing that will end up staying with me more then anything else.<br />The performances and the intriguing style of storytelling...but above all, the entire eerie atmosphere is what makes this one of the best horror movies to come around in quite some time.ound in quite some time.
B0000B3FCX|4.0|It's rare to find a CD where MOST songs are not just good but great. The only one I do not like is the first one (Flat on the Floor) - love all the other ones. This is one of those rare gems of a CD where you can listen to the whole thing over and over again and not get sick of it. LOVE it and highly recommend it! And then there is Kroeger's voice ... wow. Personal favorites include &quot;Figured you out&quot; and &quot;Should've listened&quot;. Turn it up loud and sing along, baby!
B0000C7PQK|4.0|Cretu wanted to move on from the other Enigma albums and start something new and thats exactly what he did with Voyageur. It's missing all of the monk chants and what not so it's nowhere near Enigma 2-4. It's closer to Enigma 1. Some songs sound jazzy. Overall it's good. If your a true Enigma fan I feel you'll like this. It will take time to get used to the new Enigma since we're all used to the old Enigma, but you still won't be let down from this album.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|I've had this CD for a couple of weeks now and it has really grown on me. If you liked Brave New World I'm sure you'll love this album. The sound of the songs are a lot like those on BNW but a little more epic. Best tracks would have to be Paschendale, Dance of Death, Rainmaker and Gates of Tomorrow.
0316666343|4.0|The Lovely Bones is a very sad and disturbing novel about a 14 years old girls murder. She watches from Heaven as her family deals with the situation. <BR>The novel dealt in a very realistic manner with the facts surrounding Susie's murder and the events in her family afterwards. It was sad to see how her family and the detectives dealt with the murder. But the whole thing with Susie being in her own Heaven and the descriptions of it were just to far-fetched. I guess we all have our own views of what Heaven will be like, but to read the author discribing it in this manner just took away from the realism that Susie's family was going through. <BR>But it is a griping story, and I could not put the book down. I read through this faster than any other book I have read. I just had to find out what happened in the next chapter. Very interesting and very sad.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I don't understand why so many people didn't like this movie. I think \\"Reloaded\\" is far better than the 1st. A lot of the ideas and theories were so interesting. If you like to think, which I would recommend to most of you, then this film will appear refreshing and enlightening. I loved \\"The Animatrix.\\" After seeing \\"Spirited Away,\\" my mind has never been the same. I would encourage people to open their minds and universe to another way of thought.
B000089RVX|4.0|A friend recommended me this band late last winter, and played me some samples.  I had bought the album within a week.  They're extraordinary--a mix of just the sort of hard rock I like and quieter ballads, with gorgeous vocals and harmony, and an abundance of anger and passion without the need for an &quot;explicit lyrics&quot; sticker.  I have less patience for rock angst than I used to, and a couple of these songs go a little over the top with it, IMHO, but Evanescence does it so well that I don't mind.  HIGHLY recommended; the only reason it lost a star is that I found a couple of the tracks rather disappointing.<br />1. Going Under - 5/5 - Gets the album off to a strong start--harsh verses leading into a chorus I can never resist singing along with (especially the counterpoint, since I'm an alto and Amy's soprano is a bit beyond my range sometimes.)<br />2. Bring Me To Life - 5/5 - Six or so months of frequent listening and I'm not tired of this song yet.  It has the most compelling intro on the album, and this is another one I have a hard time not singing with.  <br />3. Everybody's Fool - 5/5 - Another wonderfully strong track, forceful and nicely cathartic to belt out along with the CD, vocals--as usual--flawless.<br />4. My Immortal - 3/5 - I wasn't as impressed with this one as everyone else seems to be.  It's pretty, and I can't really fault the vocals or the instruments; it just steps too far over the edge of romance into being maudlin, and the piano and strings that work so beautifully on other tracks don't help.<br />5. Haunted - 3/5 - Appropriately eerie, and the weird background vocals work here as they work at the end of &quot;Everybody's Fool&quot;, but the chorus would be more interesting with a little more variety.<br />6. Tourniquet - 5/5 - This song grew on me.  It's a little heavy on the angst, but the intro is compelling, as is the buildup from the hollow-sounding first couple of lines to the powerful chorus.  The instrumental transition between this track and &quot;Imaginary&quot; is one of my favorite features of the album.<br />7. Imaginary - 4/5 - The transition into this song from &quot;Tourniquet&quot; and the dream-world theme of the lyrics in this song are its main draw for me.<br />8. Taking Over Me - 4/5 - The lyrics are compelling, and the soft bridge chorus is especially beautiful.<br />9.  Hello - 4/5 - Another hard-to-resist intro, and this has to be one of the most haunting songs I have ever heard.  The low strings on the bridge work especially well.<br />10. My Last Breath - 4/5 - Another one that grew on me.  Heavy on the angst, but a strong chorus, and irresistible harmony on the final bridge and choruses.<br />11. Don't Turn Away - 2/5 - The only truly disappointing track for me.  The chorus and the instrumental are good, but the verses are less interesting, and the creepy vocals that worked on &quot;Haunted&quot; are way overdone and just come out sounding cheesy.<br />Overall, though, a terrific CD.
B000002UJQ|5.0|People think that this is an overrated album. People think that people who like it are just pretending. People are WRONG!!!!! This album (to say the least)is a masterpiece. I would agree with people if you had caught me a couple weeks after I bought it. But after about a month or two it grew on me. And i realized how wonderful of an album it really was. Every single one of these songs has been my favorite song at least once. If you are a people and you think this album sucks, listen to it some more over a period of time, and if you still don't like it after a few months then I suggest taking your pulse.<BR>   I know people that love this album so much that they have passed out from listening to it. I don't know about you but I think that you'd have to be pretty weird to pass out from listening to an album you didn't really like (unless it was duran duran, just kidding). And another thing, I strongly suggest people not to listen to this unless they have an open mind. You have to be very patient to listen to this album. If you think it's slow, it is. If you get tired of slow then listen to paranoid android.<BR>   Do not pretend to like this album (if you people exist). Either you like it or your not patiend and/or have a closed mind. Or you just plain don't agree with me.
B000089CJI|5.0|(1/3 Moby + more lyrical content) + (1/3 Depeche Mode - the gloom) + 1/3 Something completely original and beautiful = The Postal Service<br />This CD creates a beautiful world of sound and lyrics..you can just let this play in the background while you are doing almost anything, and the sound will simply meld around you..if that makes sense. The songs are layered thick with sounds, and intricately create beautiful soundscapes. There isn't one point that this CD seems to drift off track. From start to finish, it retains the same beauty in each song, and makes the autorepeating feature on your CD player worth  its weight in gold. Its hard to pick a stand out track, but if I had to, it would be \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\"..catchy beats, beautiful music, and fantastic lyrics.<br />If you find Moby interesting, but wish there was more lyrical content on his CD's and find his music to get too bluesy/funky, then this is the perfect CD for you. One of the most beautiful sounding CD's I have heard in a while.

B000062YB1|5.0|This is hands down the best metal CD ever released. It blew away everything that came before it, and has blown away everything released after it. Some of the heaviest guitar and drums you will ever hear. Fantastic social and political lyrical content..unlike so much of the Nu Metal out there these days. I really wish Slayer could somehow turn their sonic damage towards the likes of Disturbed and Godsmack..and perhaps destroy the whole Nu Metal fad in one speed metal spiral to hell. But anyways..if you think of yourself as a true metal fan, and you do not own this, then maybe you need to rethink your position as a metal fan. Burn your Disturbed CDs, cut up your Godsmack shirts, listen to this CD, and kick Santa in the belly.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|Errol Flynn was born to play Robin Hood.  A PERFECTLY cast film.<BR>You couldn't ask for anything better.  Let's hope it's not too<BR>long before Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk find their way to DVD.
B000066NW0|5.0|like everyone in the world you either love Avril or hate her.  Though there's not much reason why could hate her.  She co-writes her music which she has admitted (watch diary of Avril Lavigne - mtv).  She has an amazing voice, her tv appearances have never done her justice, just go see her live like i have and you will understand what i mean, her voice is truly incredible, best female vocalist at the moment by far.  Can she play the guitar? perhaps she's not brilliantly but she does play at live performances believe me i've seen her!!   <br />Her album is an outstanding debut album, perhaps a bit more polished than she would have hoped but none the less it is a joy to listen to.  Even myself who enjoys much heavier music finds myself reaptedly listenin to this album, there's something about her voice that is extremely captivating.  Lyrically this is the albums weak point, however one must understand she was 16/17 when the album was put together, the songs are from the view point off a teenager.  Songs such as my world and mobile are lyrically poor, but she sings it so convincingly that you can't help but admire it.  The strongest songs on the album would have to be, losing grip, sk8er boi, too much to ask and i'm with you.  <br />Overall this is a solid album that never falls short of brilliant, there are amazing lyrics followed by quirky lyrics.  The album is honest and never tries to be anything other than what it is.<br />I only hope she can improve further upon this with her next album, which i'm led to believe is written enitrely by her and her band and apparantly will have a more rocky edge to it.  The future looks bright for Avril, so all you Avril haters better better get used to it because you'll only end up falling victim to the catchy lyrics and melodies.<br />GO AVRIL!!!! come back to Britain next year!!!
B00005QGAZ|5.0|This great re-release is worth owning for the bonus material alone. While the LP itself hardly needed remastering (technically &quot;Thriller&quot; has always been one of the most impeccably produced albums ever released) the new clarity on these tracks will amaze even the most jaded listener. The crown jewel here is the voice-over session with the late, great Vincent Price, his 'rap' at the end of the title track and the newly restored second verse are a true revelation! A Classic made even better!

B000001Y42|4.0|basically this is more of a rock record than anything else.  there are bits of funk and rap and hip hop to flavor the soup but ultimately this is a rock record.  as i have stated in other reviews by this band, i think the music is the foundation of the band.  one really extraordinary drummer is the heart and soul of this band, one groovin bass player to hold the madness together and one amazing guitar player who whips out some heavy riffs and great chord progressions.  <BR>     on top of all that you have fred durst who is a unique frontman.  he is not singing or rapping or covering any new ground but then again neither is the band.  it is the conviction and intensity in which this band explodes that makes them great.  it is the coming together of all the pieces that makes this puzzle worth your time.  there are a lot of people who do not like this band and alot of reviews which simply say they suck.  i wish they would give me reasons why they think they suck because while LB is not the greatest band ever they still are one of the best in their genre.  call it rapcore or nu metal or whatever, LB are one of the first (although not the first ever) to unite rap and rock in the ninities.  some metal bands throw in some rap or whatnot but never with the groove LB have.  they have one of the finest rhythm sections ever, an amazing guitar player and a charasmatic and unique frontman who drops phat raps over phat beats, can sing and scream and writes lyrics that make you think.  <BR>     COUNTERFEIT is the standout track.  it is the heaviest track and one of the heaviest songs they ever wrote.  fred sings (and at the end screams) with such emotion.  of course, there is the punkified cover of FAITH by george michal which is an interesting choice of cover.  not something you would predict.  nice execution as well.  my favorite is INDIGO FLOW, a short half ballad half rocker in which fred thanks everyone from korn to god for his life.  <BR>    this is the begginning of one roller coaster of a career of the bizkit and a great start for a great band.  definitely worth your time, your money and an HONEST listen
B00008J4P5|4.0|Where to start, where to start?  Let's start from the very beginning because after all it's a really nice place to start.<br />&quot;I'm going to Wichita.  Far from this opera for evermore.&quot;  &quot;Seven Nation Army,&quot; with it's guitar toned down bass line and pounding drums and howling guitar is perhaps the most memorable song to hit radio since &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit,&quot; and before that &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; and before that...dare I say the Beatles' &quot;Eleanor Rigby.&quot;<br />With that said, the album is plenty compelling with talent in spades among the dynamic brother sister wife husband ex...whatever...duo.  Jack White's musical range is pretty amazing and about three-quarters of the album is sublime.  How much the two can convey with two instruments (sometimes three) is pretty phenomenal.  More is not always necessarily better.  Jack's guitar work is pretty elevated.  Meg's drum style is pure pounding, not so much as an axe chop but a bludgeoning assault.<br />However, it's the one-quarter of the rest of the album that drags.  &quot;Black Math,&quot; though it shows off some solo guitar heroics is repetitive and droning, unimaginative and fairly unlistenable.  There's a few other tracks like that as well.<br />As for the rest of the album, well it's fairly amazing.  The word on the streets on the Stripes is that they are a flash in the pan, gimmicky no-talent sib kissers and that they are the saviors of all rock as we know it.  Well the truth is in between the extremes, but I'd lean towards musically gifted somewhat above the rest, but there's plenty of talent out there to save rock, just don't look at what conglomerate radio is trying to shove down our collective throats.<br />Believe for yourself the Stripe hype.  As in &quot;Elephant,&quot; there's some substance behind the hype.  Listen for yourself.
B00000JCB2|4.0|from the florida based rap meets funk meets elctronica meets metal band we arrive at their second offering.  filled with guest appearances from johnathon from korn, wu-tang clan's method man, and scott weiland from STP, this cd is much heavier than anything they have released to date (including the new one Results may vary)  <BR>   I think this album defies categorization.  it varies from head banging metal to straight ahead rock to hip hop/rap.  my favorite song is NO SEX with its introspective lyrics and haunting melody.  Wes Borland, a quite inventive guitar player, did some experimenting with sound on his axe.  it gave this album some dark and brooding tones that are positively evil.  i still think the gem of this band is drummer john otto.  his beats are solid (and \\"in the pocket\\" as the phrase goes) and still busts out some phat beats and mad fills to vary up the playing to make it great.  <BR>    love them or hate them, this band deserves respect.  although they are treading territory that is not at all unique or new, they do it with  such conviction and angry cathartic abandon that you have to give them props.  <BR>     Cant forget bass player Sam Rivers either who holds it all together.  Together with Wes Borland (who cranks out some really great riffs and some beautiful chord progressions)  the band is a solid rock wrecking machine.  <BR>    Fred Durst is a unique front man.  introspective and still angry and a decent rapper.  he has been criticized for being a \\"whiner\\" but thats just the way fred writes.  he writes for people like me, the disaffected.  he simply writes about the problems and things he sees and experiences.  <BR>    while 3 dollar bill was more of a rock record and choclate starfish was flawless performance and overproduction choclate starfish is convincing emotion and menancing, brooding evil music filled with something for everyone.  there is rap, funk, electronica and modern rock.  if you buy ANY LB album then this is the one that risesabove them all.  <BR>     do not listen to all the naysayers.  there are plenty of reviews who say Limp Bizkit sucks yet they list no reasons why.  dont tak emy word for it.  rent, beg, borrow or steal it and listen for yourself.  read the over one thousand reviews and anyone who does not give
B00005QDW1|3.0|No Doubt is a great band, but this time around I'm not sure what went wrong. Some songs are great, some are pretty bad. I give them credit for having tried something different, but in a way this is just too much mumbo jumbo mixed into one cd. I have to agree with others when they say that if you really want great No Doubt music, buy anyone of their cd's but this one. It's a little dissapointing but I give them 2 thumbs up for several songs that made a difference like: rocksteady, running, don't let me down and in my head other then that, the rest of the cd is silly. I gave them three  stars because they are my favorite  band and I'm hoping this cd was just a &quot;once in a blue moon&quot; thing and that their next cd will show their real potential.
B00004XOWM|4.0|i liked this cd.  songs like HOLD ON, TAKE A LOOK AROUND and my favorite song MY WAY all breath a sincerity and realistic vibe on top of that PHAT guitar sound. Wes Borland is amazing.  I think the two standouts in this band are Wes, the guitar player and the drummer, John Otto.  i read he played jazz before the bizkit.  he is amazing.  not all bash and pop but tasty little things and really intelligent beats that enhance the music so much.  <BR>     Then there is Wes Borland who has an incredible sound and throws off some really cool riffs and chords.  evil and pretty and all in between.  Sam Rivers plays bass and i give him credit for holding the chaos together.  the band is tight and then there is Fred.  Some of his lyrics i find to be right on the money and others are just...well...others lyrics are just there.  <BR>    the band is saying nothing new but they say it better than the rest but the music is what makes this band great.  the haunting riff of mission impossible in \\"TAKE A LOOK AROUND\\" is a prime example of the power this group has musically.  <BR>     this is a good cd full of anger and rage and yet still capable of subtle gestures.  the band throws off some rap, some funk and some rock all in a slick, flawless effort of the evil beauty (or beautiful evil) of what is essentially music for the disaffected.  one complaint i had with this band is the DJ.  i am not a huge DJ fan and so on songs like MY WAY, i think DJ lethal ruins a great song.  the catch is that without him LB would sound like every other band so i guess i am .
B00006BS6T|4.0|This film has some of the best flight sequences I have ever seen. The cinematography is superb, and one gets a glimpse into the speed a pilot experiences as he tries to outmaneuver an oncoming missile; it also shows the &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; of the ejection seat process, which I found fascinating.<br />Having fairly low expectations for this film, I was amazed at how entertaining and visually stunning it actually is, and am surprised it did not receive greater success in its theatrical release.<br />It takes place in Bosnia during an imaginary time, with US forces under NATO command, and though fiction, it uses captions at the end, telling the audience what happened to the characters, as if it were a true story.<br />Filmed on the USS Carl Vinson, and in Slovakia, with the beauty of the Carpathian mountains as a backdrop for the horror of a war zone, director John Moore keeps the pace of this film constantly pumping. Though some characters are somewhat cartoonish, and the script at times silly, much of the acting is good. Gene Hackman can always be depended upon for a solid performance, and Owen Wilson does well as the main protagonist, who starts out as being a rather shallow, whiny fellow, and grows with his extreme experience, as he plays a cat and mouse chase with a Serbian &quot;tracker&quot;, played by Russian actor Vladimir Maskov. Gabriel Macht is excellent in the smaller part of the fighter pilot Stackhouse.<br />Yes, there are times the plot is contrived and not altogether believable, but this is more than made up for by the dazzling cinematography by Brandan Galvin, a fine score by Don Davis, and astounding visual and sound effects...and if you like jets and choppers the way I do, you are guaranteed to like this film.
B000075BFK|4.0|Don't get me wrong... Editorial reviewer Dalton Higgins is quite correct when he proclaims 2PAC's genius and mastery. Shakur is one of my favorite MC's and definitely had more flow than most rappers. Nevertheless, Dalton's analysis of the relationship between Death Row and Bad Boy is nothing more than an embarrassing perpetuation of the media hype/creation dubbed  \\"the East Coast/West Coast Rap War\\"... <BR>It's all a bunch of BULL !!!<BR>I'm a musician/dj/rapper/producer who grew-up in San Francisco (for 18 yrs.) and presently living in NYC (for 15 yrs.). I've been actively involved in the Hip Hop Movement since it's inception. I've never seen/heard of any \\"war\\" or \\"beef\\" (or ANY significant animosity for that matter) between these two coasts other than that created by the (white) media. <BR>What's a shame, is that black and latino journalists, performers/entertainers and rap fans alike have engaged themselves in this farce; devouring the hype... adding fuel to the fire. Maybe it's because they're scared to fight the power... or more specifically, their (white) bosses.<BR>The goal of these corporations is to sell newspapers/magazines... and so,  many things happened to escalate. Sadly, 2pac & Biggie are gone... <BR>We do NOT know why they were killed and the true motive.  <BR>What I DO know, is we don't need these suckas in the media to translate the life we're living.<BR>REMINDER :  When you're reading about the revolution, choose your media sources wisely. And remember, it doesn't necessarily HAVE to be televised!<BR>Don't believe the hype!<BR>True dat -<BR>\\"D\\" $ooch  aka  I, Storm<br />P.S.<BR>I gave the compilation 4 out of 5 stars because I, like some of the other customers, and not too fond of some of the tracks they created behind his vocals.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|I think for the past 5 months I've been intensly listening to Rufus. When I first heard Poses, I couldn't beleive what I was listening to. It had automatic appeal. This album doesn't do that. There are a few songs that start and just don't seem to get off the ground like they're supposed to. On the other hand, &quot;Go or Go Ahead&quot; has one of the most IMMACULATE climaxes I've ever heard. It's like watching lightning. You hear the spark of his voice then the music claps behind it like an awesome multi-staged delayed echo boom. That one song is worth the $14.00.<br />Although it doesn't really compare to Poses, it's still outdoes anything else out there right now. I give it 5 stars
B00004XONN|5.0|It's just beyond description! Anyone with a open mind would see how beautiful these songs are.<br />RH keeps adopting some of great experiments of post-rock bands but never forget what they are making. They are not like other premuture bands who are apt to get lost in their vague experiments. RH has a tight hold on every sound you hear on this album. This album is a very scrupulously manipulated crystal.
B00000099Y|5.0|I've had this album for about six months now, and I've listened to it every day since I've had it. This album is extremely well thought out, and to my surprise they've received a lot of negative criticism because of their 10 minute songs or &quot;filler&quot; tracks. Take the song Third Eye for example; there is no way the band could've made this song with depth without making it 13 minutes long. As for their &quot;filler&quot; (such as useful idiot and message to harry manback) tracks, they're there for a purpose, I won't give it away, but Tool put them there for a reason. Some people say the band-members in Tool have no talent. Well, I beg to differ. The lead singer, Maynard, has one of the best voices in modern rock, and to those who say he sucks, listen to that guy from Creed or Limp Bizkit, then tell me Maynard sucks again. Go ahead, I dare you. The guitarist, Adam Jones, I'm not going to say he's the best guitarist since Hendrix, but his simple yet intricate guitar riffs suit me fine. The bassist, Justin Chancellor, is pretty much the driving force in Tool, with his again, simple riffs. Now, the drummer of Tool, Danny Carey, is definately one of the best drummers ever. His unique style, and the way he can just hammer it like no other astounds me. Sadly, he is often overshadowed by the other band members. Now, on to the actual music. The lyrics are so beautiful, their songs have almost made me cry. People interpret Tool's songs in different ways. Every song of theirs means something different to everyone who hears it. They never say in interviews what a song means, rather they just give it to the fans for them to decide for themselves. Also, I've read some other reviews, and people said this is just for angst-ridden teenagers. Just a little background on myself, I listen to everything. Everything from Mozart to Shostakovich and Dave Matthews Band to The Beatles. So don't think I'm some dumb teenager who doesn't give a damn about music. Tool has talent, on so many different levels. I recommend this album to fans of Pink Floyd and Led Zepplin, and pretty much everyone in general. However, when you listen to this album, listen to it in small doses. Then, look up the lyrics for their songs, and go to a Tool web board or something. Just buy this album.
0060512806|5.0|I bought this book because I saw Quicksilver in the store and it looked amazing, but it was only hardback and I wasn't about to spend the money.  I had let the size prevent me from getting this book in the past, but I figured, same author, I'll give it a shot.  That was yesterday.  I'm on page 300 today.  Amazing read, and now I'm REALLY looking forward to Quicksilver.  Especially since I found out that, apparently, Enoch Root is a character in both books.  Wow.
6301976061|5.0|Question:  How can 12 ANGRY MEN be such an exciting and compelling movie when it has only twelve characters, one set, a relatively brief running time, and little physical action?  Answer:  Because it has a deftly written script and superb acting by the entire cast.  I won't summarize the story, as you probably know it already.  Let me just say that each actor is perfect in his role, but that the great Lee J. Cobb truly stands out as the juror who, by repeatedly voting \\"guilty,\\" is really trying to punish his own son, who abandoned him.  As explosive as Cobb's performance is, I cried at the end when he suddenly breaks down weeping and says, \\"Not guilty.\\"  One feels that Cobb's character is finally \\"cleansing\\" himself of the pain that he has suppressed for years.  This is just one of countless memorable moments in this brilliantly written, directed, and acted film.  12 ANGRY MEN is a great drama from start to finish.  You MUST see it.
B0000640VO|1.0|At what specific age should my pubescent development have been stopped short for me to adequately enjoy this film? Can it be that I, as an adult, am meant to be charmed by the hijinks of a moron who interferes with any lives she has suddenly taken it into her pea brain to manipulate? Are we meant to hope that our lives were as storybook-colorful as those in the film who fall prey to her nearly terrifying in its ignorance meddling? The asinine antics this baby-talking idiot performs, such as with the grocer whom she so easily edges toward insanity, are hijacked from the world of Bugs Bunny and Elmer Fudd. And her own preposterous ploys to arrange it so that she is left all but sucking her thumb and pining for her--we suspect--slightly less retarded would-be beau while he emotionally snaps his fingers at just missing her and is left holding something that gives the time for their next annoyingly cute and predictably unconsummating rendezvous are ponderous, so ponderous. And yet apparently such drivel will never fail to captivate the herd.
B0000C8AQE|3.0|No new liner notes, no real change to the packaging besides a nifty blue inset. Even as a fan I feel cheated. If you own the DVD and the CD, there's really no reason to buy this. If you own neither, this is an economical way to have a double shot of the Once and Future Queen of Soul. Most of us crazy Tina fans will probably buy it anyway- love is pain after all. But what's love got to do with it? Someone had to say it.
B000089RVR|5.0|I have been patiently waiting for her return and finally it has arrived, and it was worth the wait. The style hasn't moved on considerably but dido has returned with reliable, but moving songs that are a pleasure to listen to. There is a good mixture of songs on the album and it flows a bit better than No Angel. Standout tracks Life For Rent, Don't Leave Home and Sand In My Shoes are excellent, and with no dud tracks on here, its an album you can listen right the way through without having to skip. Thank God Dido has returned and saved us from some of the music thats been on the radio's lately.
0440237688|4.0|The Giver, by Lois Lowry, is a well written novel with an exceptional insight into the future.  I personally enjoyed how the author created her characters to live and function in a normal society, without the many luxiouries that we enjoy today.  The idea of not being able to see color was an interesting detail that really made me enjoy the fact that people have not tried to make humans all the same.  I could not imagine going through like without ever sliding on a sled, or feeling the warmth of the sun, or the frigid of snow.  It must be hard for Jonas to receive these memories now that he has grown up in a well protected community.  Lois Lowry did an amazing job describing her characters reaction through this brilliantly written story.
067165991X|5.0|This is a wonderful book. I especially love his winning descriptions on the William of Orange. Brilliant stuff. Too bad Kissenger is a liar and a war criminal. How can you reconcile the blood upon his hands and his obvious erudition, his wit, his intelligence? God knows.
0375703861|2.0|White Teeth is an exploration of race, genetics, belief and family set mostly in the eighties and early nineties with flashback to WWII and the seventies.<br />Zadie Smith has a pungent, comic style that is readable but not moving.  I was intrigued by Millat, Samad and Joyce but didn't really care about them.<br />The book displays deep knowledge of race and of being nonwhite in England but I found its forays into &quot;science&quot; murky and unconvincing.<br />As a whole, the book fails to provide a convincing narrative or to develop its characters.  Archie, whose attempted suicide opens the book, is sadly neglected.<br />However, there are some wonderful moments such as Archie's  discovery of his future wife, Samad's struggle with lust and Joyce Chalfen's obession with Millat.<br />I can't recommend the book but I wouldn't be surprised if the author improves with age and ends up writing a book I heartily recommend.
0452282152|5.0|I finished this book in one day.  It was easy to read and also easy to get lost in the lives of it's characters.  After I read it, I thought about it enough to go look at a book of Vermeer's work.  I strongly suggest that anyone reading this have a collection of his work handy because of the references to specific works throughout the book.  That Vermeer's paintings serve as another dimension to the work make it all the more pleasing.
0743243153|5.0|The most important thing I learned reading this book was the definition of real love.  I could define here what Peck gets across, but I'd rather just recommend the book.<br />Just this aspect of the book is worth the time and the price of admission.  If you ever wondered about love, real love between people, read it.<br />Peck does go off on some tangents.  Not all of this book is well written in the sense that it is easy to read or flows well, however, the insights gained are worth the effort.  There are a few things here that I don't agree with and I'd imagine, most likely, that over time, Peck has changed some of his early held positions.  But what he says will cause you to think.<br />Another good subject is the idea of religion. Anyone that thinks there are not religious is simply wrong and Peck makes a strong argument as to why.  Are you an atheist?  Well don't be so quick to think that means you are not religious, you may be more religious than you think.<br />There are case studies and stories and some position statements.  It is a book worth reading if not because it was a best seller for a long time when it was first published but because Peck is simply able to explain in an understandable fashion why people often need help in life and how life itself is simply hard.<br />&quot;Life is difficult&quot; is how the book starts.  It is a strong recommendation from me.  Life is about loss.  See my review of &quot;My Losing Season&quot; by Pat Conroy, another master of reading into the heart and soul of man, for another good book dealing with the difficulties and trials of life.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|Oh god oh god OH god OH GOD! THIS IS IT! A dream come true. Here they are - in all their irreverant, dangerous, harmless, colorful, immature maturity - the music - the great, great music remixed in 5.1 or DTS the way it was meant to be heard.  My 14 year old son has just discovered The Who - but nothing else comes close to capturing this group in its full blown majesty. From their naive mod pop, to the overblown superstar level final performance with a sadly bloated and off beat Keith, this DVD set captures The Who in all their glory. If you want to recapture the pure joy, exhiliaration, and innocent danger of rock and roll BUY THIS DISC! If this disc doesn't give you goosebumps, go check out the review of the Cowboy Junkies. For the rest of you - - - - PLAY THIS DISC LOUD! Long Live Rock! Long Live The Who!
630280082X|5.0|I haven't seen this movie since 1986 in an empty movie theater with a beautiful woman, but why isn't it on DVD?  It shows that we have idiots running the movie business.  The acting is tolerable, the video is decent, but the theme and the music is special...thank you, Joe, for being profound yet realistic.  My casette is worn out.
B00006690G|1.0|Los Angeles, California<br />80% + of all rap music listens are white, hence the Eminem phenomenon.  There is nothing more to it than that.<br />Rap should be effortless, and Eminem is trying way too hard.  Take &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; for example.  He uncoordinatedly flops out into the opening lines as usual, and then half way through the track, I'm not sure if he's going to crap his pant, or suffocate.  He starts gasping out lyrics in the finishing <BR>lines, towards the end of the song, I was wiping sweat from my forehead.<br />The guy has the physical flow on stage of the tin man from the wizard of Oz.  Tupac could fart, and it would have more rhythm then Eminem's entire musical career.  <br />When enough Eminem fans get hemorrhoids from singing along to &quot;Lose yourself in music&quot;, hopefully we'll finally see the last of this cardboard corporate star.
B0000542DJ|5.0|The Lunar Landing. The Hindenburg. Stock market crash of 1929. Titanic. Martin Luther King's &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech and finally JFK's assassination in 1963. What do these things have in common? They're moments in history that everyone remembers, researches and studies. So much has happened in the past 100 years but these events and others just like it actually happened and they're part of American history. The difference between the assassination and the rest? It's a controversy, it's a mystery. It's something that can't be explained unlike the others.<br />November 22nd, 1963. Dallas, Texas. Dealey Plaza. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in his motorcade during a visit. The suspect: Lee Harvey Oswald. The main investigator: Jim Garrison. The film follows Garrison and his investigation into the assassination and what proves to be the mystery of all mysteries. <br />This film will make you think. Why? Because the explanation by the government(called the Magic Bullet Theory, your first clue that the government had something to do with it) is wrong, and they explain why. Why Oswald could not have performed the shooting alone and they explain why. Director Oliver Stone delves deep into this and literally rips things apart. A lot of it is speculation and theories but that's the whole point, to keep you thinking and to raise questions. <br />All in all, a controversial but brilliantly constructed attempt to show that what happened that day near 40 years ago is deeper and more complicated than what you were told by the big boys in Washington

B000002H2H|5.0|This is definately a metal classic. Anyone who is into metal should get this. This is Metallica's old album before they became the old rich a-holes they are today. If you want to listen to some awesome metal forget their new sh*t like Load, Re-Load, and St. Anger and get their old stuff like this one and MAster OF Puppets.
0440237688|4.0|\\"The Giver\\" is a story written by Lois Lowry that conveys what human life would be like if no thought or feelings were involved.  Life just goes on as normal with people never asking any questions on why such activities are done the way they are in the town.  The story begins to pick up when Jonas is selected as to be the Receiver of town (the most respected position).  As this happens, a whole new story is unfolded to the reader.<br />Overall, this is a wonderful story that brings the reader on a roller coaster ride of emotions as Jonas begins to receive memories that everyone takes for granted.  Due to the variety of emotions the reader feels, it becomes very hard to put the book down, because the reader feels the need to find out what happens to Jonas.  This is a very good story that keeps the reader interested throughout the entire story and still keeps the reader wanting more at the end.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|I'm with the guy who said this is a must for any real fan.  As pure rock film goes, this is to The Who what &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; is to The Beatles.  In other words, a film that truly captures the spirit of the band.  Also recommended are &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; and &quot;The Wall&quot; as the other great rock films.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|I haven't seen Scarface since it was released in 1983. Now, at 35 I bought this dvd and it's a whole new experience for me in  terms of superior image, sound quality and of course powerful acting by all the actors and actresses in this movie. As you watch the 2nd dvd, you might conclude the success of this movie : Brian Depalma directing + Oliver Stone script + Al Pacino, Michelle Pfeiffer, Steven Bauer, Rober Loggia and F. Murray Abraham + Giorgio Moroder in music+ John Alonzo in Photography. What can I say about Al Pacino : literally he transforms into Tony Montana. Besides Pacino, few actors can transform into their characters, fine actors like Robert Deniro ,Daniel Day Lewis, Dustin Hofman, Harrison Ford and Russel Crowe. Great movie experiencie. It should belong to your dvd collectibles. And about the ultraviolence......It's the real world man !!!.
B00003CXD5|5.0|I have little to add to the reviews posted here in terms of praise for this great film.  I would point out, however, that there is an underlying structure of Left politics that is too often overlooked by reviewers.  Such an oversight passes over a richness of intellect and of historical/biographical parameters which help us situate this film as a wotk of art.<br />B. Traven was a member of the Communist Party and John Huston's politics were of a similar nature -- so much so, that he was forced to live abroad for a decade or more in order to escape the madness of McCarthite witch hunters. The radical left politics of the film are nowhere better seen than in Walter Huston's brillinat monologue in the Los Ossos flop house when he holds forth on the value of gold and why it is so dear. The minute of so of his monologue is the most compact, deepest and brilliant summary of Karl Marx's Labor Theory of value of which I know. There are even snippets of thie monologue taken verbatim from Marx's &quot;Capital&quot; and inserted into the old miner'speech. Ending, as I recall, with &quot;I know what gold does to men's souls ...&quot; the film is more than an a-historical fable of greed and tragedy. It is a story of what can happen to the proletariat (Dobb's) once it begins to accumulate and get its hands on &quot;capital -- i.e., gold. If I am not mistaken, the politics of this film allow us to reinterpret many other motifs contained in the film.<br />Of course whether this interpretation is correct or not makes little difference in the long run. As Left parable or as classical tragedy, the film deserves its ranking and reputation.<br />One last interesting fact, I have been through Traven's book several times and cannot find Walter Houston's monologue. I suspect that is because John Houston inserted it into the script on his own as the film was being shot.
B00008J4P5|4.0|I'm 43 and basically new to the White Stripes,but after hearing this cd I'm hooked!! Even though there's only 2 in the band,they rock like 2 bands put together...Don't pay any attention to anyone that gives this cd only 1 or 2 stars...There's a different type of song for everyone..there are ballads and blues and punk..The last song could been done by the Mamas and the Papas..kind of country/folk..a fun/silly song.Buy it now!!
B00008S2VG|5.0|I have been a Madonna fan since I was a little girl in the eighties.  Her brand of catchy, yet meaningless pop was very fun and I enjoyed it throughly.  As a matter of fact, I still buy pop music like that from the likes of Britney Spears and NSync.  But my tastes have matured and I prefer music that speaks to me.  For years Madonna kept saying that she had something important to say, but no one ever heard it.  Her music continued to be about nothing more than love and sex.  However, the album Ray Of Light changed that.  When she re-emerged from her pregnancy with that album I finally heard the Madonna that had been promised to me from the beginning.  However, when Music came out she seemed to have abandoned that format and had gone back to simply doing catchy pop songs.  Although I did like that album, I was a little disappointed.  I thought evidently she didn't have enough to say.  Needless to say, I was proven wrong, much to my delight, with this album.  While Ray of Light was more personal, American Life focuses more on Madonna's ideas about the world around her.  The first track \\"American Life\\" sets the mood by telling it's listener about the futility of the commercialism of life that is often seen in this country.  The next track, \\"Hollywood,\\" is a comment on the constant search for fame that turns out to be an illusion, as Madonna will well know.  Other stand out tracks on the album include \\"Intervention,\\" which talks about how love saves us from the pain and suffering that life often gives; \\"Static Process,\\" which speaks about the struggle between religious teachings and learning to love yourself; and \\"Nothing Fails,\\" which is about destiny.  There are also more personal songs on this album including \\"Mother and Father\\" and, my personal favorite, \\"Easy Ride,\\" which talks about the road that Madonna has traveled and the road that lies ahead.  All in all this is a wonderful album that makes you think and gives you a look inside the thinking processes of this musical and marketing genius that has intrigued us for twenty years.  Despite what her critics may have thought, she is not just another pop making machine; she really did have something to say.
0446530891|4.0|Armed with an advanced copy of Split Second that had been distributed for marketing and promotional purposes, I was fortunate to get a sneak peak at Baldacci's latest effort.  Thankfully the opportunity to get the book one week before broad publication coincided with a trip that afforded me ample airport and airplane reading time that allowed me to plow through the book.  I was not disappointed.  Split Second is clearly a page turner that grabs the reader early and keeps him guessing.  Prepare for some level of sleep deprivation as you stay up too late in order to read \\"just one more chapter.\\"<br />Split second chronicles the saga of two Secret Service agents, Sean King and Michelle Maxwell, who are both disgraced in seemingly separate events that take place years apart.  As the mystery unfolds, King and Maxwell are brought together to follow a trail of clues (and dead bodies) as they pursue the unknown antagonist.  Although not as good as Total Control or Absolute Power, which I think were Baldacci's best efforts, Split Second is able to hold a reader's attention with the hallmarks that have become his trademark:  action, suspense, and plot twists.  Any eccentricities in the storyline are made up for with solid character development.  There is romantic tension among King, Maxwell, and King's former lover.  The broad set of characters presented by Baldacci possess a variety of personal motivations that expose the gamut of human frailties.  Split Second should be a hit for those who have liked Baldacci's previous works-especially his early novels.
B0000C8AVE|5.0|In general, I'm against censorship. But if I read all those reviews by this guy who calls himself &quot;cranky reviewer&quot;, I begin to think that amazon should sort out some reviews and not print everything that is sent to them (maybe they won't publish this one...). This guy wrote over a hundred reviews and they're basically all the same (consisting of stupid phrases like &quot;Janet Jackson or Justin Timberlake is much better than this&quot; and so on...) and are telling the reader nothing about the record itself (like this review, I know...).<br />BTW: &quot;Freewheelin'&quot; is an undisputable classic of course, which everyone should own...
B000025SJ8|4.0|Black Metal before black metal was cool.  Everything fit, the vocals are great, and the atmospheric beats almost make you feel like you're there....wherever there is.  Anyone who listens to &quot;black metal&quot; like Dimmu Borgir and COF should check this out, because this is what metal is.
0316666343|4.0|Lovely Bones won the Horror Writers Association (HWA) Bram Stoker Award for best First Novel.  Certainly the award was well-deserved but surpising since you'll never find Lovely Bones in the Horror section of any bookstore, and few readers of the book must think of it as Horror.  <BR>The fact that the HWA gave this award to a book with the quality of Lovely Bones should do much to elevate the reputation of the Stokers which are known to be given by a vote of HWA active members heavily influenced by internal politicking.<BR>In this book Alice Sebold took on an enormous challenge using a dead girl as her main character and heaven as a setting.  For the most part she succeeded admirably.  The story is deeply absorbing, although some of the digressions into the hearts and souls of her characters became tedious.  And she certainly lets the murderer off easy.  <BR>I for one think the book deserves all its popularity and sales, which is saying a great deal when you consider the books on the bestseller lists and the ones major publishers hype.
B00005JKZU|5.0|wonderful and excellently made movie with great scenery footage and powerful performances all around. It shouldve one best picture, boo hoo for Chicago(sucked the ass of the movie critics). Viggo rocks as Aragorn and so does Orlando as Legolas. Andy Serkis has a standout voice performance as the skitzo Gollum who looks like he could hit the gym(no offense im sure Gollum is dynamite with the ladies in the sac). also Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd kicked as Merry and Pippin as well. thought Cate Blanchett, Hugo Weaving and Liv Tyler should of had some what of a bigger part(im just saying they should of). but the real surprise is to see Brad Dourif in this movie, I mean he's done some pretty horrible movies in the past and some pretty good ones as well, but he really was evil and nasty in this one. PEter Jackson did a great job and im leaving it at that. oh and Elijah Wood and Sean Astin kicked too. bye. LONG LIVE BILBO!!!!
0783225970|3.0|First of all, I would like to say that this movie is very educational.  It teaches us about the dark aspects of human nature that lie deep in our minds--'the American dream' as it puts it.  We may not be able to live it, but seeing it the way Mr. Montana does it gives a certain thrill.    Now to my review of this Anniversary Edition dvd set.  Contrary to what you may think, I disapprove of its layout (which is why I didn't buy it).  I really can't stand the fact that the DVD makers had to put a bunch of illiterate rappers on such a great film.  I would have to say that this is a travesty to what the movie really stands for.  Maybe if they added Al Pacino or Oliver Stone commentaries... I wouldve understood... but a bunch of idiotic ganja-smoking rappers.  This takes my vote down 2 whole stars.
B000069AUI|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've ever heard! There is something about the way the music just flows. The emotions run high as the lyrics are soulfully pumped out. I highly recomend this cd!
B000099T2L|2.0|When I first heard Beyonce was doing a solo album I thought &quot;Cool it should be cool&quot; so I bought it a couple of weeks after it was released and when I heard it I went half way through the songs and changed it to &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; The only good tracks on this album are &quot;Crazy In Love&quot;,&quot;Thats How You Like It&quot; and &quot;'03 Bonnie And Clyde**&quot; There arent good songs on this album only 3 or 4 but they dont stand out I cant really imagine most of these being singles because the songs arent good.Gosh Even &quot;Baby Boy(Featuring Sean Paul&quot; Isnt good Seans voice just annoys the crap out of me and the up-beat song with Beyonce's sleepy voice isnt really great 4 me.I think the world is fussing alot over Beyonce because she is beautiful and thats it.I say this is an album to listen to but not to buy unless you are one of those Beyonce-Fussers.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The ultimate super group, A Perfect Circle is back and as amazing as ever. True, the feel of the album is different than what we've come to expect, but that's not such a bad thing. The lyrics are angrier, more emotional, more vindictive, almost, and the music, while softer than what we're used to, edges the raw emotion of Maynard's voice in velvet covered razorblades. Muted and beautiful, this is the kind of album you can't classify. You just have to listen to it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was by far by favorite show of last season. Joss is a genius. The fact that it won an Emmy after only half a season proves that this show was destined for greatness. But alas, it was not meant to be. Well at least we have this DVD set to marvel at what could of been..
B0000BWVCM|5.0|forget the 1st one. this one is great and it has more indepth story telling and much more wonderful filled characters including NightCrawler, Pyro, ICeMan, DeathStyrke and others. The first one was really not that bad and I liked Hugh Jackman a Wolverine and hes excellent in this one as well as he trys to find out who made him the way he is. I just hated that Famke Janssen(Jean Grey) dies in this one(hope I'm not spoiling anything for anyone here). one thing I hated though is that James Marsden(Cyclops) seemed like he had little screen time in this movie. He dissapeared and then way minutes later he pops on the screen again. anyway. check it out. action and stunts galore. a slam banging good time
B00008EY9G|4.0|Superb acting and direction make this an intense thriller. We aren't aware of who exactly the killer is until the very end of the movie and then it is to late to change. Suffice it to say what you think is killing these people is not a ghost or monster from the Indian Buriel grounds. No they are in fact intelligent, cunning, insane, and very much alive.<br /><br />John Cusack and Ray Liota are exceptional and the rest of the cast and very good. The sets are erie and makes one harken back to thrillers like &quot;Psycho&quot;. The rainy flooding storm that brings a group of travellers to a motel merely starts the chain of events that make you question fate and coincidences.<br /><br />When you finally realize how all the traveller's will meet and deal with their fate you are shocked and thrilled. When you begin to realize what the motel keys mean and who hasn't been accounted for you may find it a little hard to believe. Even so it is not the personality, but what they are capable of doing you must remember. Then the unravelling of events as they really happened will astound you.<br /><br />Any fans of thrillers like &quot;Bone Collector&quot;, &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;, or &quot;The Hitcher&quot; should enjoy it. It is not for all tastes since it gets bloody. Not recommended for kids.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is one of the most amazing records I have ever heard.  Anyone who says that they sound just like Tool needs to open their ears, mind and expand their horizons.  You can hear how the songwriting and producing goes the next step when looking back to the debut release &quot;Mer de Noms&quot;.  The vocal stylings of Maynard are so intense and catchy.  I don't know the words yet to the songs, however I find myself whistling the melodies.  It's too much.  I am curious to hear how this stuff sounds live.  If there is any doubt to buy this record, forget about it.  If you listen to it once and it doesn't click, take a break and try again later.  Pet, The Nurse, and Blue are some awesome tracks, but then again, the entire CD is awesome so just listen to it and enjoy the journey.
B00006V9A0|2.0|This is the worst excuse for a greatest hits album I have ever seen (except, possibly, the one from Alice in Chains). Only ONE track from Bleach, ONE from Incesticide, ONE from Unplugged (two on foreign releases), and an alternate version of an Incesticide track (Been a Son), plus You Know You're Right, the leak of which on the internet caused the hurried release of this collection. The tracks on this album were &quot;remastered&quot;, which usually means made to sound better, but all of these songs were recorded less than 15 years ago and Bleach has already been remastered before. The sharp, biting guitar tone of Nevermind has been compressed and &quot;warmed&quot; to the point where it sounds like trash, and the rest is (fortunately) mostly unnoticeable. To add insult to injury, this compilation only has 14 tracks, not even hitting the one hour point...this time could have been used to include such staples as Dive, Floyd the Barber, Drain You, On a Plain, Negative Creep, Blew, Aneurysm, Lounge Act, Radio Friendly Unit Shifter, Sappy, etc. etc. etc. Inexcusable. This is on par with the bargain bin $8.99 releases at the CD store, but costs the same as a full album.<br />In closing, there are three reasons I give it two stars:<br />1) I can't give it 0 stars.<br />2) It's Nirvana, and despite the shortcomings listed above, the songs that do appear are great.<br />3) There is SOME value to the collector, as it is the only official release (as of writing) with You Know You're Right, and you also get the version of Been a Son from the long out of print Blew EP, and finally the remixed Pennyroyal Tea, which only appears on the censored Wal-Mart/K-Mart copies of In Utero and the mega-rare Pennyroyal Tea single.<br />So if you're a new Nirvana fan, just buy Nevermind instead, you'll be much happier. Then if so inclined, get In Utero, Unplugged, Incesticide, and Bleach in that order. If you're a collector...buy this used, not new. Don't reward Courtney Love for this kind oftripe.
0783226063|4.0|Oil planets, rubber suits, flying Buicks and lots of industrial images and soot...<BR>Who else could come up with a vision like this for the Frank Herbert novel other than David Lynch?<BR>This so-called box office disaster has to be one of the most controversial sci-fi films to ever grace the silver screen, and though it has been repeatedly bashed by sci-fi buffs and Dune purists, the two-hour-plus feature always manages to surface either on television (in a hastily- and carelessly-edited extended cut), in conversations among admirers of sci-fi or cinema, as well as in personal movie collections worldwide.<BR>So why was it scorned during its initial release?<BR>Expectations of the film adaptation were high. The film hardly captured every facet of the novel. But how could it?<BR>Also, many theatergoers and sci-fi fans were expecting, well, more of a futuristic approach to Dune as opposed to Lynch's industrial vision. A spaceship with plush leather interior lacking any flashy computers just didn't do it for the Star Trek/Star Wars crowd.<BR>However, Lynch's script remains faithful to the story and its characters. The first-rate casting, combined with (undeniably) Lynch direction, pack enough flair to make the film more than worthwhile viewing and certainly worthy to own on DVD.<BR>The entire cast give first-rate performances, most notably Kenneth McMillan, Jose Ferrer, Sian Phillips, Francessca Annis and, of course, Patrick Stewart.<BR>Toto, the 80s rock band that proved to everyone that musicianship isn't everything, contribute a worthy score, though it steers toward a Flash Gordon-esque style in the film's finale.<BR>In sum, Lynch - like a true visionary - leaves us with more fantastic impressions of the enigmatic Dune world than he does comprehensive storytelling. The impressions, however, are lasting. They are the key to why this sci-fi flop survived the relentless criticism and has proved, repeatedly, to be in demand among consumers.<BR>Note: Lynch withdrew his screenwriting and director's credit from the extended TV version of the film, and for good reason.
B00005JKC3|3.0|last years spider-man didnt really grip me. though x-men 2, daredevil and this one right here did. Eric Bana(Black Hawk Down and Chopper) is great as the green man. Connelley is sexy as always and Nolte is well, he needs a new hairduo is all im saying. but I really liked this movie and I ignored my friends opinions on it as well. great visuals by Ang Lee and also great direction as well. sorta played like a comic book splitting the scenes in half and all and the hulk visuals are spectacular. one more note. They coulda done without those damn mutated dogs, what the (beep) was that all about. Inject Fluffy with the crap and Fluffy turns to Spike, anyway.
B00005RHGL|5.0|If you haven't seen this one, you must!  Target store has very same 2-disk Vista set for $14.95.
B00003CXA2|5.0|This is the best movie I've ever saw. Is absolutely perfect in all way. The story is amazing, the Tom Hank's performance is perfect, the music is perfect. Nobody can lose this fine piece of art. Wonderful movie.
B000096I9G|5.0|Very impressive.  I was never a big fan of the Pornography album, though I tried to be.  I think this DVD projects the sound and feeling of this album Robert Smith wanted to share which makes it enjoyable (or depressing, however you see it).  The other two albums sound terrific.  Jason's drums sound better here than on the albums.  If you don't like this DVD you probably don't really like the Cure, go find some U2.
B00005K9LN|5.0|You can devide the Judas Priest(halford)-era in three periods of four albums. You got the silver period:Rocka rolla,Sad wings..,Sin after sin and Stained class that's characterised by searching for a sound, vague experimentation and a bluesy feel to it. You got the bronze period:Defenders..,Turbo,Ram it down and Painkiller that's charaterized by different moods on each of the albums and trying different things out. And then you got the golden period:Killing machine,British steel,Point of entry and Screaming.. that's charaterized by raw agressive riffs, flashy solos, short songs, sing-a-long choruses and a meaty sound. Too many people this is classic Priest and it is the sound that defines the band and also heavy metal in general. British steel is a Priest-gem. It's short,sharp and deadly.The first song on it is the anthemic Breaking the law, a real classic. No wonder that Beavis and Butthead sing it. Rapid fire is one of Judas Priest's fastest songs ever. and Grinder proves that mid-tempo songs can also sound very agresive as does Metal gods with it,s machines destoy the eart fantasy-text. United is an infectious football style sing-a-long tune and ofcourse the catchy yet heavy sounding Living after midnight. If you're a metalfan you must have this album.
B0000B1OFI|5.0|if you havent seen the original, check this one out at video stores. I loved everthing about this movie. The chases, the action, the heists the characters. even the credits. There's no denying that Seth Green is the one that stands out in this movie. He is frickin awesome. The story is perfect and its a knockout script filled with the leads and the colorful supporting team(leads-Mark Wahlberg, Eddy Norton, Charlize Theron. supporter- Seth Green, Jason Statham, Donald Sutherland, Mos Def and Franky G). I wasnt bored and I defently believe you wont and if you are then your weird. weirder than I am
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is by far the best album of the year.  A must have for any prog rock fan, or rock fan for that matter.  I have listened to it nonstop for the past two weeks, and I can't get enough.  Let Maynard take you on a journey now.
B00006BTCA|4.0|Wow, I like this album a lot. It is almost as if Joy Division has returned except with a little more technology. The music is great and really allows you to become absorbed with the lyrics and beats. Now I must get out Joy Division's &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; I haven't heard it in a while and it should be played after this in the cd stack.
0140067477|4.0|This is just a reply for James LeMay. I have not yet finished the book but what I have read has been very helpful. It wasn't so much the book that caught my eye, it was more Mr. LeMay's  review. His review was very well written, I will give him that, but what his apparent bashing of the book seems to be as a result of his offense he has taken to it. I picture Mr. LeMay as one of those up tight, concerned with nothing but logic, takes thing in a way too literal manner kind of of &quot;intellectual&quot; people that is just ticked off because he is being bashed ,and outshined as a decent human with a happy life, but a dumpy, stuffed teddy bear. But then again that's just my opinion and he is entitled to the same right to express his but people shouldn't really take him seriously. This book is wonderful for some one looking for inner peace as opposed to an attempt to liberate and widen the horizons of toddlers.
B0000AMRJC|4.0|For those that have not seen this film and are fans of the gangster/crime genre should see it at least once. I predict that most of the people that will be reading this already know how violent, contraversial, quotable, and great this film really is; so the majority of the review is about the DVD itself. First off, the dust sleeve the DVD comes in is beautifully designed. You'll probably try your hardest not to get any smudges or fingerprints on it...which is pretty easy to do. It is odd that there is no booklet with even a scene selection index. Even the cheapest DVD's I own have some sort of printed out scene selection index. Needless to say, this is a small gripe but I would have rather have had I nice booklet than  an ad for DefJam Recordings stuffed in. Most of the extra features are fairly well done. All the documentary features give some good insight into how the movie came about and the censor problems they had to overcome. Although, even Pacino wouldn't give up the secret of what he really snorted in the movie. Even the number of deleted scenes are good. Although not all of them are that exciting it is nice to see before and after &quot;action!&quot; is called. The biggest blemish on the DVD is the DefJams Origins of a Hip-Hop Classic. In my opinion, it sort of cheapens the movie. Yes, most rappers lives of excess are reflected in this movie but...so what! I don't need to know what P.Diddy thinks of this movie. It is just another marketing ploy in my eyes. The widescreen version of the movie looks and sounds beautiful otherwise. If you have a previous widescreen version of the film on DVD it may not be worth your while to get this version since the extras aren't too essential. For those of us that love the movie and never had a good widescreen presentation of it should definately get this version.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|There is no star rating that can describe this cd. It is a work of art. Whether you are a johnny cash fan or not this cd is essential. I loved it before the man passed away but know it has risen to a level that can not be touched. This is the last will and testament of a dying man. If you take the cd and apply it to the time in his life when he wrote it, the album is extremely prophetic. Its scary,awesome,inspiring and a work of art that is essential. Thanks Trent for letting johnny cover your song and allowing him to reach out to a whole new audience.
B000056N8X|1.0|With a good series and a good movie (the first one...I don't touch the other two with a ten foot pole) behind them, you'd think they could have gotten this one right.  Nope.  This was just wrong.  The villian was a total wanker and one dimensional at best and Christopher Lamber just looked old...he looked like he wasn't even trying this time around.  At least Adrian Paul made it somewhat worthwhile.  I have two other beefs with this movie: In the movies, it's obvious that Connor is supposed to be the last one standing.  Since this point was made in the third movie, I really don't mind the fact that they ignored this.  The second problem bothered me in the fact that if you watched the show, Duncan was never supposed to get married (thank the reruns on Spike TV for that bit of info) thanks to some sort of gypsy curse of some sort.  What made it worse was the fact that I didn't even care for the storyline.  <br />So why am I giving it one star if I didn't like it so much?  Simple...three reasons.  Methos, Joe and Donnie Yen.  Ten minutes of joy in a film worth of crap.
B0000004V2|5.0|I bought this album 11 years ago and it still finds it's way into steady rotation on my cd player. I hate most of the stuff that comes out of the UK, but these guys were unique. They wrote the most beautiful melodies, heaped on soaring choruses and the interplay between musicians was outstanding. They played the most uplifting happy music but never sounded sappy. It wasn't embarrassing to say you dug these guys. Everyone I know who has heard this album has LOVED it. Somehow, they managed to squeeze 30 years of pop music into one majestic piece of work. From the distant clicking train tracks that introduce \\"I Wanna Be Adored\\" to the final tambourine shake at the end of \\"Fool's Gold\\", the Stone Roses' debut inspires awe and adoration. I'm running out of superlatives here. It's as if they took every good element of indie-pop, folk-rock, funk, house and psychedelia and somehow made it click. \\"She Bangs The Drums\\" is pure grandeur. Not one hook or melody is wasted. \\"Waterfall\\" takes it's cue from a propelling shuffle beat and a pulsing bass line that raise the shimmering guitars to heights way beyond your standard UK jangle guitar bands. R.E.M. only wish their guitars could chime like this. \\"This Is The One\\" is a the most uplifting cynical song ever and \\"Shoot You Down\\"'s soft brush drumming and gentle arpeggios create a magnificent ambience. \\"I Am The Ressurection\\" sees the band start off in a Merseybeat pop style only to morph into a monstrous psychedelic jam that includes 12-string and countrified slide guitar, maracas, tambourines, bongos, funk-derived basslines and frenetic drum soloing. It's as if all the 60's had been compressed into one eight-minute power pop jam. In truth, there is not one bum track on the whole album. John Squire's guitar playing is the unholy bastard child of Hendrix, Page, Johnny Marr, Paul Simon and Roger McGuinn. Reni is the best drummer to come out of Britain in a generation. Not since John Bonham and Keith Moon had their been a limey drummer with such a distinctive style. Mani's bass playing is functional, but, because he's surrounded by virtuosos, somebody has to keep it simple. Ian Brown was tone-deaf live, so his vocals must have been run through heavy harmonizers and sequencers because he sounds good here. At their peak the Roses could do no wrong. Their b-sides could have easily been saved up and used as a second album, and it would have still been better than most bands' best outputs. Oasis copped their attitude, the Verve borrowed their jam-heavy stylings, Blur took the art-school feyness and Radiohead even nicked their producer. The Roses have to be the most influential and inspirational cult band in the world. Unfortunately, they frittered away all their potential by delaying their second album, losing Reni's powerful drumming, by abandoning the sound that made people love them and by playing awful live shows. Their aloofness turned into laziness and killed the band. At least they can be proud of this one gem they bestowed upon the music world. I was lucky to come across something this sublime at the moment it was unleashed upon the world. God Bless.
B000002UB6|5.0|If you have read Gordon Overshine's review, you will know that Phil Spector's Wall of Sound or rephrased Phil Spector's Wall of Confusion is all about.  We will see Gordon Overshine's re-do on 17 November.  Let It Be - Naked will give the world what only the Beatles could do.
B000089RVR|4.0|I very much like the new album.  The songs carry Dido's trademark laid-back acoustic/chill sound.  Dido deserves credit for being a very good songwriter.  Her melodies are always pleasing and her lyrics are witty.  That said, I find that the songs on LFR are much more similar in style to each other than the songs on NA.  The music here just isn't quite as diverse.  For example, there are really no harder-hitting songs like &quot;don't think of me&quot; or &quot;take my hand.&quot;  Still, the music on LFR certainly has merit.  &quot;who makes you feel&quot; is incredible with its tight and original instrumentation and swanky chorus.  I think I'll always love Dido.
B00006RINF|5.0|A bit heavier than &quot;In A Reverie&quot;, but still addictive.  Fans of Evanescence will LOVE Lacuna Coil.
B000002UB6|5.0|lets face it no matter what the beatles do its great. just wait untill let it be naked comes out. best song on the album is two of us. buy it and enjoy semi
B0000C23DO|5.0|if you are just getting into them get this. it covers the deads entire career. remember though this is the dead at its most radio friendly. always with a hits collection it misses some songs plus only one live song for a band at its best when live. a few songs that were hits but rarely performed live are here, TOUCH OF GREY, GOLDEN ROAD. still where is ST. STEPHEN, CHINA CAT SUNFLOWER, DARK STAR, the modest hit GOOD LOVIN', TERRAPIN STATION, and anything from the deads final studio album? if you only want 3 albums of studio material get this, WORKINGMANS DEAD and AMERICAN BEAUTY then get all the live stuff for full effect of the greatest jam band of all time.
B00005CDNK|4.0|The Visitors is ABBA's finest moment.  When it was released in 1981, interest over the band had waned, and this album was overlooked.  By 1992, the ABBA revival was in full swing and it was once again ok to like ABBA.  Well, I never stopped loving this group and grabbed this LP upon its release in 1981.  Like another reviewer said, it's the sort of album which doesn't make much of an impression on you the first time.  As an adult, I have now come to fully appreciate this album for the sheer brilliance that it is.  Regarded as the mature ABBA sound, it is an album that really leaves their earlier songs looking rather lame in comparison.<br />From Agnetha's beautiful voice on &quot;Soldiers&quot; to Frida's incredible &quot;Like an Angel Passing through my Window&quot; this album will make you appreciate ABBA on a different level.  Sure, there are a couple of duds on the album (eg. One of Us and Two for the Price of One) but worth grabbing a copy.
0671510991|4.0|Diplomacy conveys the history of international relations from the 1600s to the 1990s. Concepts of Reason d'etat, Realpolitik, Containment and the reasoning of nations' behaviour with one another are introduced and their implementations are clearly illustrated.<br />Historical lessons are provided from French Expansion, German unification, the World Wars, and the Cold War.  The American policies of the 20th Century are the focus of this book.  The personalities involved are very detailed I enjoyed the sharing of Dr. Kissinger's personal stories with the likes of Truman, Nixon, Ford and Reagan.  <br />I did however notice the basic omission of Jimmy Carter's term and Carter's work towards peace between Israel and Egypt.  Some may be disappointed because this book only covers up the the early 1990s(written in 1994) but other books like Huntington's \\"Clash of the Civilizations\\" should fill that gap.
B000066NW0|5.0|I speak for atleast half of my daughter's school alone, not including anywhere else when I say......Avril ROCKS!!!!! I dare anyone who says Avril isn't good to say that they aren't lying........because it's impossible to-unless you're like 80 or something....then I understand. Avril DOES write  her own songs-most of them just didn't get on her first album because her record producer thought that no one would like her.But he was wrong. I can promise everyone who is reading this that she will have her own songs on her next album. So all you Avril  haters.........smell my stinky feet!!!!!!!!!!  (And hers)
B00006FDCJ|5.0|Unforgiven is a modern classic and the best western in the last 30 years and perhaps one of the top five ever made. It ranks with Shane, Ford's calvary triology, Red River and The Searchers as a classic of the genre. All of Eastwood's experience in the genre, of which he is the last great star and this generation's John Wayen, comes to fruition in this beautiful realized film. It is classic in the manner of a Greek tragedy, of a man whose past has unleashed furies that cannot be ignored.<br />If there was a higher rating than five stars, I would give it to Unforgiven. Do not miss this film.
B00005CDNF|5.0|If there is one ABBA album to get (besides THE VISITORS) then this is it.  Not only does it contain the hit singles which really put them on the map (ie. SOS, MamaMia and I Do, I Do), it contains some gorgeous ballads (ie. the outstanding &quot;I've Been Waiting for you&quot;).  And who could forget &quot;Tropical Loveland&quot;.  This song was used as the background music for an &quot;ABBA in Australia&quot; special in 1976.<br />Remastered on CD and sounding even better, buy it for the bonus tracks previously only available as b-side vinyls (eg Crazy World).
B000003C2S|5.0|I think if maybe Death as a metal band wasn't made their appearence in the metal world 20 years ago, the Death Metal genre couldn't be existed. I heard a lot of bands who tried to give an extreme cooperation, as like in its moment could did Possessed, Slayer, Celtic Frost, Venom, Dark Angel or Sepultura (in the earlies 80's of course), but the real Death Metal was created by the late guitar virtuoso, lyrics genius and all time frontman, why we can call him as Death for himself? I'm talking about Chuck Schuldiner. This incredible musician did a lot of stuff who was the true inspiration for all the Death Metal bands that are now playing around, this raspy and deepest voice and his riffs and fast solos are unique in its genre. Another great musicians are now playing and giving the best of them but in this album are four metal monsters. Chuck in first place, with their vocals and guitar playing, James Murphy who is another incredible guitar master (his contribution to the metal genre can be heard in Obituary, Cancer, Testament and Disincarnate)makes the competition between Chuck and him, Terry Butler is one of the most powerful bassists in the underground world and Bill Andrews beats their drums fast but accurate. Spiritual Healing is one of the best Death Metal albums and their songs are the same. &quot;Defensive Personalities&quot;, &quot;Killing Spree&quot;, &quot;Spiritual Healing&quot; for example are one of the well done songs of all times. I have all the official Death stuff and I've heard the Control Denied and Voodoocult proyects in that Chuck puts his musical art. In a few words, this album rules and Death is not Death, Chuck always live in our hearts and runs in our minds!!!
B00005NWM3|1.0|as many people mentioned before me - it lacks of any originality and emotions.a perfect rock album for screaming girls and whole stinking popculture.enjoy it.<BR>will chad Kroeger will become another half-naked pop hero just like Chester Bennington from Linkin Park? i am scared to think about it...
B000022TSH|5.0|Chinatown is a superb film noir and one of the landmark films of the 1970s. The script by Robert Towne (winner of the Oscar for best original screenplay for 1974) is justly famous as perhaps the best screenplay ever written in Hollywood. This is not only a superior detective story but one of the most incisive studies of the morality of the American ruling class ever committed to film. Truly, Roman Polanski's best film with great performances by Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway (both Oscar nominated) and John Huston in a memorable turn as the face of evil.<br />If you have lived in Los Angeles, you will not want to miss this film as it details the machinations that brought water, and the Valley, to the city of angels. Hell -- if you have lived anywhere in the world you will not want to miss this film. A masterpiece.
6305342768|3.0|The crew of the deep-space exploration vehicle \\"Palomino\\" is returning to earth after a fruitless search for alien civilizations when they stumble across a once lost ship hovering at the edge of a huge black hole in this 1980 flick that Starlog magazine billed as Disney's $25 million gamble.  The gamble did not pay off for reasons that become quickly clear and are reinforced throughout the flick - dated special effects and a thin plot that's an obvious pastiche of \\"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\\", \\"Frankenstein\\" and \\"Moby Dick\\".  <br />The ship turns out to be the \\"Cygnus\\" a one of a kind mammoth wonder designed by the equally enigmatic Hans Rheinhardt (Maximillian Schell).  Though a huge ship, Rheinhardt is mysteriously the only surviving member of the crew - never a good sign in sci-fi.  In place of the crew, Rheinhardt appears to have built an army of androids - militant sentries, faceless androids who give the ship the air of a medieval abbey, and Maximillian (no relation) a silent, floating enforcer with whirring blades where his hands should be and a single unblinking eye that seems fixed in an evil stare.  Rheinhardt fetes the Palomino crew (which quickly gets over its apprehensions of the reclusive master of the Cygnus) and invites them to witness his planned entry into the nearby black hole.  Rheinhardt has pioneered a type of gravity engine which he believes will allow him to enter the black hole safely and learn of its mysteries.  As they poke around however, our heroes of the Palomino only find disturbing clues as to what Rheinhardt has been doing all those missing years (the most ominous appears to be an elaborate funeral held by the androids) and even begin to wonder if they will be allowed to escape the Cygnus.<br />\\"The Black Hole\\" doesn't turn up on cable that often, so it's worth at least a rental.  The effects are so dated, it's pointless to even try comparing them to anything of our CGI age.  Instead, they have their own unique quality which keepsyou from dismissing it.  The look of the Cygnus seems very un-spaceship like (wide halls and sweeping spaces, unlike the claustrophobic corridors and cloistered nooks of Nostromo) which makes the flick look even more interesting, but only as an extremely expensive episode of \\"Dr. Who\\".  The problem with the look is that the film has no frame of reference for the state of technology in the future age in which the story occurs.  How much of the Cygnus and its robot crew is supposed to amaze us?  Are hordes of monkish androids an unsurprising thing to find?  Who knows.  They could have handled that better by making Roddy Macdowell's character V.I.N.CENT an android, which would have given the Palomino (and us) a better frame of reference.  The dialog won't win any awards, but it's not the hokum that others have called it (though with the talent available, the script was bound to fall short).  The flick's biggest hurdle is that it's unclear who its for - too violent and ambiguous (especially at the end) for kids, but not exciting enough for adults or teens (like the lasergun battles - no teen would buy robot-sentries who manage to stand still while humans blast them).  Schell is great as the sinister Rheinhardt (I don't think he's that overplayed) while Tim Bottoms is also great as the Palomino's resident hot-head.  Anthony Perkins seems underplayed as the Palomino crewman who actually buys into Rheinhardt's fantasies, while Ernest Borgnine gets some laughs as the Palomino's journalist who alternates between snooping and cowering (but always thinks of himself).  Though it's easy to see what went wrong, I still like to catch this flick when its on.  When it came to decide between financing either this flick on one hand or 2 more Herby movies, a sequel to \\"The Apple Dumpling Gang\\" and, another remake of \\"Parent Trap\\", \\"The Black Hole\\" was still the better idea.
B000002IGP|5.0|Ratt was one of the first hard &amp; heavy rock bands that I've heard in my life, at this moment I'm a heavy metal fan who has a lot of tastes, since this kind of soft, posser and glam metal to the extreme sounds as death metal or grindcore (Please don't get surprised about it, as a 38 years old man, I'm an open minded rocker for all the genres). But I remember the first time I've heard Ratt, I enjoy 'till now it's sound. The guitar duo with the late Robbin Crosby and Warren De Martini give me a fact as how can did they sound in an acid metal strings tapping or licking mode. Stephen Pearcy have an unique and &quot;trademark&quot; voice so powerful and Crucier &amp; Blotzer did the complete end, a real glam metal machine with all its gears so solid and perfect in sound or motion. &quot;Back for more&quot; is a real power metal piece of work and technic melodic with nice riffs and beats, &quot;wanted man&quot; is the &quot;lone far west&quot; metal song and &quot;round and round&quot; was the high term of the commercial 80's metal. I respect a lot another bands as Motley Crue, Dokken, Quiet Riot, Hanoi Rocks and Poison, I enjoy heard them too as well, but Ratt is Rock. Don't look their looks, just heard their noise and get on!!!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Okay, First of all, if you are going to see this movie, see the first one. Second, if you are going to see the movie, watch it on a big screen TV. <br />The movie starts out with an awesome scene with Trinity. Then a fight scene with Neo. Then there's this long boring part in Zion that is probably the worst part because it is so long.  But then, Neo has a huge fight with Smith. I mean. This is awesome.  Then a Great Hall fight, then the best chase scene ever (which is tied with the T3 chase.) Then the climax.  The action is like 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 times better than in The Matrix. Even though it is confusing in some parts... but it will all be cleared up in The Matrix Revolutions.  I hope you rent/buy it cuz it rocks!!!
0783225725|4.0|High Plains Drifter is a superior Eastwood Western that takes &quot;The Man With No Name&quot; characterone step further into the realm of myth. Is Eastwood's character the returned spirit of the betrayed sheriff or an avenging angel? You'll have to make up your mind yourself. <br />An impressive tale of revenge and atonement. Four stars.
B0000CG9N8|5.0|This cd.......what can i say its simple just amazing all i can say is that if you dont like it at first listen watch the dvd and if you dont have the dvd listen to it again and if you dont like it after the third listen just stop listening to music all together.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|APC does it again, intricate lyrics, Maynards haunting voice, incredible instrumental artistry from all involved, and while Paz will be sorely missed, the new members have more than taken up the torch.  Unparalleled production quality, APC will reach into everyones soul, take hold of it, and put it right in your face for you to study in depth.  If you don't have their first release, buy it.  If you do, buy a second copy just to let this band know we need more.  If your local DJ's don't have the nuts to play this on their own, request the hell out of it, tell them we need intelligent music, not more of the current boy bands thinly disguised as punk, rock, and/or alternative.
B00004TRD8|5.0|After a stream of hits that peppered the '80s, Writer/Director James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger reunited after almost seven years to work on the long-awaited sequel to the ground-breaking &quot;Terminator.&quot;  They did that and far more.  &quot;Terminator 2: Judgement Day&quot; succeeds not only in terms of white-knuckle action sequences, but it also deeped the mythology of the Terminator Saga to greater depths than almost anyone thought possible.  Arnold returns to his best role by far as the Terminator, a cyborg in this film sent to protect John Connor (Edward Furlong) as a teen from a superior liquid-metal morphing machine (Robert Patrick) sent by Skynet in the future to kill Connor.  Also added to the rag-tag team of Connor and the Terminator is his Connors' mother Sarah (a terrific Linda Hamilton) buffed-up and ready for the impending holocaust.<br />The film kicks off with the one of the most breath-taking opening sequences ever.  Set in the future, the machine armies and the human armies advance on one another in  lazer-filled combat.  Even though the scene is far grander than the low profile hit and run missions of the original, it still maintains the intimacy that made those secrets all the more engaging.  From there, the film transplants itself to 1992 Los Angeles, where Sarah Connor is locked up in a mental hospital and John Connor is held up with foster parents.  Out of nowhere, two terminators from the future show up, both with different intentions about what to do John.  After giving the seemingly unstoppable T-1000 the slip, the T-101 and John go after his mother and later mount a daring, and damn near sucidal attempt to alter the nighmarish events of the future by trying to derail the progress of the computer company Cyberdyne.  <br />What also makes &quot;Judgement Day&quot; such a great movie is the well-formed relationships between John Connor, his mother and the T-101.  John rocky relationship with her mother is played out as is the growing attachment they both feel towards the particular machine that is protecting them.  The relationships germinate throughout the film, growing and blossoming as the plot thickens and boils over in a tense and spectacular in the Cyberdyne building and a metal refinery.  So much credit is due to writers William Wisher and of course James Cameron.  Cameron also provides quick, fluid and often intense pacing over the films' near 150 minute running time without letting down on the story or mythos, which is what makes the Terminator Saga so enduring to begin with.
B00003CWRX|5.0|Michael Mann's The Insider is one of the most important films made since the 1970s. It is a superb dissection of the corporate amorality that is rampant in America and is a seminal film in that it shows the collaboration of the media with the corporate state. <br />Russell Crowe is outstanding as the tobacco company executive turned whistle blower who is betrayed by the powers that be in the media world. Al Pacino is at his best (and least hammiest) as the 60 Minutes producer who tries to break Crowe's story. (Christopher Plummer also is fine as 60 Minutes correspondent Mike Wallace.) <br />Mann has a through understanding of the paradoxes of the modern capitalist society. 60 Minutes will not run the story of the whistle blower due to its fiduciary responsibility to its own stock holders since it cannot do anything negative that will adversely affect its own financial portfolio and hurt the investment position of its own corporate officers. The only morality, ultimately, is money. This is a world far removed from the Hardy Boys ethos of All the President's Men.<br />An important film with a great performance by one of the outstanding new talents of the cinema.
B0000CD5I6|5.0|In spite of the fact that this is a Christmas album (i typically loath christmas music), this is still hands down some of the best Tull since Heavy Horses.  I've heard the phrase \\"return to form\\" applied to some of their efforts since the mid eighties, but here, it actually can be said.  The whole disc has that same shimmering, woodsy, seventies feel that Songs from the Wood and Horses had, those two albums being my favorite Tull discs and I get the impression I'm not the only one.  Besides the great arrangments, one other thing is shockingly apparent - Ian has regained almost all of the timbre and range of his younger days.  His unique qualities as you may know were robbed by throat problems around '84.  Well, it's almost back to full steam here.  There's even some of the great layered vocal arrangments with Ian harmonizing with himself, as he did on the late seventies albums, from bass to tenor.  This produces a very original effect, one I personally find mesmorizing.  I think I speak for legions of Jethro Tull fans when I say, thank god, and hopefully this is a signpost of things to come.  I would love to see a couple more albums in this vein (not Christmas, but this style), it has the sound that made me love Tull to begin with. A whimsical, hypnotic disc. If you like Jethro Tull, pick it up - I can't understand how you could be dissapointed.
B00000FCBC|5.0|For all you guys who think that this is a bad album, I think your all full of sh--.  Metallica pays tribute to their roots and shows everybody that they havn't forgotten where they came from.  Although this album does sound like the Loads, it isn't as soft or bluesy.  This album contains the heavy sound that is heard on the old albums.  Jason Newsted's bass is easily heard and sounds awesome.  This album belongs in Metallica's elite category.
6304698682|3.0|Pale Rider is worth watching, but unfortunately, it draws too heavily on George Stevens's classic western Shane, which just might be the greatest western ever made. It is well-acted and nicely shot, but it really can't hold a candle to Shane.<br />Three stars.
B0000029AP|5.0|This classic album is the link between the subtle and elegand Get Your Wings to their hard boogie-rockin' Rocks, and it has the best qualities of both albums. Every track on this album is unique and is a perfect song all by itself, and yet unique. I think that in spite of the presence of some of their greatest hits (Walk This Way, Sweet Emotion), every song is a peak by itself.<br />The only downside is that there are no bonus tracks on the CD edition. But the album by itself is a perfect album that puts Aerosmith at the top of the music worlds for generations to come (to this day its their best selling studio album- 8M in the US alone)
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Russell Crowe gives another outstanding performance in this wonderful movie from director Ronnie Howard. Based upon the biography of mathematician John Nash, A Beautiful Mind makes the inner logic of mathematics comprehensible to the average film maker while not stinting on the real-life drama of the schizophrenic Nash and his long-sufferingt wife, played by the beautiful and talented Jennifer Connolly.<br />This is a film that should not be missed. It is ingeniously made, and not just in showing mathematical concepts (to say anymore might ruin the film for you).<br />Five stars! A worthy winner of the Best Picture Oscar.
B000063S6Z|5.0|Despite what other, less patient reviewers thought (one called everything but Jam for the Ladies mind-numbingly boring drivel) I thought that 18 was a great follow-up to Play. I own both albums, and there is more of what made Play innovative and new on this album. &quot;We Are All Made of Stars&quot;, &quot;In My Heart&quot;, &quot;Great Escape&quot;,&quot;Signs of Love&quot;, &quot;Extreme Ways&quot;, and &quot;Rafters&quot; are all very nice songs. I recommend this album if you like songs on Play like Porcelain, Rushing, or Inside.
0783228007|2.0|Joe Kidd is not one of my favorite Eastern westerners (and Eastwood is my favorite, hands down, when it comes to films, and the Western is my favorite genre), but it does feature a good performance by Robert Duvall as the heavy. Clint's character is a little too reigned in in this one for my taste, until at the end he runs a steam engine through the town in order to extract some vengeance from Duvall's baddie.<br />A good supporting cast (as is typical in an Eastwood flick), also featuring John Saxon and Don Stroud.
B00008H2LB|2.0|I have to say I liked the first CD. It was shamefully &quot;popy&quot;. OK, call &quot;INSYNC Metal&quot;, but it was good and edgy. This one just made me yawn. Much like Korn, Rage Against the Machine, Limp Bizkit etc..., their first CD is the most memorable and certainly their most fresh and innovative. I guess does go to your head, too bad it doest improve thier music!
B0000AR8NK|5.0|REALITY seems to be one of the most important records Bowie has released up to-day and not to-morrow...<br />In terms of production, engineering and music arrangements, it goes beyond the new and clearly emblematizes a new statement in sound and lyric definition. <br />If LOW was for some what it is now, then REALITY is what it is not...the follow up to HEATHEN or a bridge between DIAMOND DOGS and ALADIN SANE. It just sits there in the speakers with one of the most luxurious grooves and three-dimensional beats ever created by any artist. <br />In fact, never heard any one define what Bowie cleary states in BRING ME THE DISCO KING. Its one of the most conspicuous and ponderous works of art ever created under the Bowie trademark and a meaningful sign that Bowie stands for what he is: the first nobel prize in music.<br />REALITY is profound, alive, crisp, an absolute zero and those earthling bombshell guitars.<br />Produced by David Bowie and Tony Visconti<BR>Mastered by Emily Lazar
B0000CABJ1|4.0|The folks at Universal have seen fit to release yet another compilation that looks back on the career of Disco's only true superstar, yet also manages to look ahead to possible forthcoming projects.  All the disco-era hits are represented in remastered glory here, albeit in shortened single edit form.  Donna's eighties transition into pop/funk/dance is briefly visited as well.  The selling point for die-hard Donna fans is the inclusion of two brand new recordings reuniting her with long time collaborator Giorgio Moroder, who along with Pete Bellote created the disco masterpieces for which she will always be remembered.  &quot;Dream-A-Lot's Theme (I Will Live for Love)&quot; is the showier of the two tracks, showcasing a full throated anthemic Donna vocal against an unstoppable Euro/NRG beat.  The other new song &quot;That's The Way It Is&quot; is breezy mid-tempo pop embellished with reggae percussion, featuring Donna in a more playful, seductive mode.  <br />Worth noting is that the first pressing contains a bonus disc of remixes including 12-inch mixes of &quot;I Feel Love,&quot; &quot;Hot Stuff,&quot; &quot;This Time I Know It's for Real,&quot; along with a Chris Cox remix of &quot;Dream-A-Lot's Theme&quot; and the elusive Tony Moran collaboration &quot;You're So Beautiful&quot; which circulated on the internet and in various clubs earlier this year.<br />Hopefully 2004 will see the release of an all new album...until then this set will have to serve as a reminder of glories past and a taster for things to come.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|For those who say &quot;not much thought was put into this album&quot; or where was she trying to take us&quot; I can only say that these are probaly the same ones who think 50 Cent is what music is about. Ebadu's new cd is truly about witnessing the growth and progression of an artist..not an entertainer who concentrates on producing formulaic hits, but an artist devoted to advancing a creative tradition that she aspires to one day be a part of. Although my opinion is that with this album and Mama's Gun she has secured her place. The album is a moody experience almost a creative journey that forces you to listen and think about what you are listening to.  No one mentioned how much of Chaka Khan's influence is all over the vocal phrasing..especially the way each syllable is sang like a song and stretched out as far musically as it can go. Did anyone catch that are have we been so doped up by hits that we've forgotten what music is about? Great album.
B000068TPN|3.0|\\"American Heroes\\"   ... guess that sums it up.  this movie tries to celebrate the blood spilled in this pointless struggle.  I see the war as a wound we refused to let close.  How many NVA soldiers died horrible, slow, bloody painful deaths?  How many of them had families?  In this film, they mostly all die offscreen.  When they're on screen, they usually perish while jumping from a huge explosion.  The Vietnamese commander is about as distant and trivial as possible.   More time is spent trying to establish an emotional connection with the CO's Wife.  What? And that's where this movie goes wrong.  It conveys chaos, maybe, but not fear.  The Thin Red Line, despite it's long running time (similar to this film) is much more effective in letting the audience develop a connection with the main characters and in showing why they act.  We Were Soldiers simply shows men getting slaughtered and trying to remain patriotic/hopeful until the end of the flick.  and what a TERRIBLE score.
B000003TAR|5.0|yes yes i know your thinking what about Nevermind?? But this CD has everything Nirvana was. Kurt Cobain practically venting all of his anxiety, anger, and fear. You get an intimate look at Kurt's damaged physce.  I feel that Rape Me, Heartshaped Box, Milk It, Very Ape, tourettes, and all apologies could possibly be some of the greatest rock songs EVER. This was a great way for Nirvana to sadly go, and on the 10 year anniversery of its release in '93, every Rock fan should have this CD in their collection.
B00008PBZW|1.0|I couldn't be more disgusted.  a single well-trained soldier would survive just fine.  Apparently someone working on the film told all the actors to charge and never take cover.  The military advisor to this film must be as frustrated as myself.  John Woo has really fallen far.  Windtalkers, Face Off and Mission Impossible II don't even come close to his more famous HK films made with Chow Yun Fat.  They're contrived, but not enjoyable.  Woo has gone too far.  This movie makes films like Battle of the Bulge or Anzio look GOOD in comparison!!
6304712936|5.0|An old and senile Salieri sits at the piano playing some of his tunes to a young priest.He asks him whether he recognises any of the melodies he is playing. With a polite smile and a blank expression, the priest responds that he did not.Then Salieri stops for a second, and then asks, what about this tune? He plays another, and suddenly the priest's eyes light up in instant recognition and shouts: oh yes I know this one, is this yours?<br />Salieri with a very bitter sigh responds: this is Mozart!<br />What a way to start a film and what a scene to introduce that masterpiece that is Amadeus.<br />A genuis child prodigy that was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart took Europe by storm, and success,fame,admiration,sponsorship and financial protection was the natural result.But there was a  darker side to that fame: the excesses, the gossip, the conspiracies, the politics of the court, Mozart's own inner demons, and his peculiar relationship with his father, respect that hides fear. And of course there was Salieri!<br />A veteran at the royal courts, a mediocre composer who has found a secure place for his limited talent,only to find its very foundations threatened by this newcomer..Jealousy and  bitterness were the natural outcome, but carefully hidden by the guise of friendliness and protective wisdom, while Mozart still retaining a trusting naivity that would eventually hasten his downfall.<br />This is the story of THE best musical biography ever filmed(Period!), from a director who is no 'hired hand' but an artist in his own right. It is a very ambitious film, very lush, beautiful to watch and hear, an epic of dramatic and musical propotions.<br />There are good music biographies,like Ken Russell's Music Lovers (Russell has a life long passion for classical music), his own unique version of Tchaikovsky's life, in addition to Lizstmania and Mahler. Beethoven had an excellent and underrated biography in Immortally Beloved, but still Amadeus remains in a league of its own.<br />This status comes from the fact that the director and writer successfully manage to give an equal treatment to the music,the genuis of Mozart, and to the human drama, the essence of Mozart.

B00005JL78|3.0|A respectable attempt, tainted by clean sets and clean clothes and clean actors.  where are the drugs?  The scene with the typecast creepy doctor is just not enough.  this should be remembered as a TOM CRUISE FACIAL ACTING action suspense flick not a PKD movie.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|first off let me just say: rufus is a complete genius.<br />so it's no surprise to me that this record is fantastic. <br />i won't go into a long description because every other review does that, but i'll just say that this record is a combination of the eclectic, whimsical sound of the debut with the polish of poses.  <br />in response to several comments in recent reviews about rufus' lyrics being too simple and not poetic, keep in mind that this album, like most good albums, takes several listens for the songs to grow on you and come together completely.  I promise you that these songs get more and more complex with each listen, and there are layers and layers to delve into and linger in.  ESPECIALLY the lyrics.  i must admit at first that i thought they sounded quite simple, but with repeated listens it all comes together and the complexity of it hits you.  i advise you to read several recent articles (ie new york times, paste) to understand just what inspired this record before you dismiss the lyrics.  Part of rufus' genius is his ability to deliver his message with such a smooth and carefree feel, but don't let this apparent simplicity fool you.  The record captures a hell of a lot that has been going on in rufus' life as of late.  There is passion and inspiration in every line.<br />buy the record now.  then buy the debut and poses and get lost in the way of life that is rufus wainwright.  i'm not even exaggerating...he gives you a new outlook and an appreciation for beauty in everything. &quot;i like the make the mundane fabulous whenever i can&quot;.  my life is about 10x better because i have rufus.  he is that amazing.
B00003CXE7|2.0|A predictable &quot;ride&quot; as maximus, the big strong, chisel-jawed hero, climbs his way up the ladder of opposition and difficulty, defeats his enemy, and gets to see his wife, in slow-motion, to some cheesy music.  The universally evil and reprehensible Emperor sure made a good villain.  No reason to sympathise for him at all.  The best scenes, in my opinion, were such simply because of the difficulty of the production.  For example, the battle bewteen Germanic tribes and Roman Legionnaires.  Amazing battle. The scene amazed me, simply because i have not witnessed anything of that nature.  <br />If hollywood can't make something original, or believable, then it shouldn't make anything at all.  there are plenty of fine films that have already been made.  <br />Good set design and costume dosen't make a good movie.  Case in point: Titanic. Oh, but it makes money, i forgot about capitalism.<br />The movie was so incredibly tedious, it's very very hard, to give it a second viewing without simply fast forwarding to the action sequences..... which would belabor the question &quot;why did i pay for all the scenes i don't want to watch?&quot;<br />Want to see a good movie with elabourate sets and costume?  Barry Lyndon.  Want to see a good 'journey of the hero' movie?  see lawrence of arabia.  Don't waste your money patronizing Ridley Scott.  He's fallen very far and in the process ended up dumbing down his &quot;art&quot; so far that every single Macho Man enjoys it.  Watch ALIEN or the APPLE 1984 commerical and do scott a favor.
B000063DI8|2.0|I did give this album a chance...I really did, but there was a musical vacancy in the band that could not be filled. The guitarist position was filled (*ahem*), but the musical vacancy was not.<BR>I just didn't \\"feel\\" it this time. You know, that spark that hits you when a really inspired piece of metal hits your ears.<BR>I think that Bruce was doing his humor book \\"Iffy Boatrace\\" about this time period, and transferred some of that humor into his lyrics here. Some folks don't seem to recognize the tongue-in-cheek nature of 'Holy Smoke', but I think the hammy video they made for this explains their point: not to be taken seriously. 'Tailgunner' did absolutely nothing for me....'The Assassin'...ugh....'Bring Your Daughter' has more of Bruce's perverted humor, but 'Hooks in You' is a great rockin ditty with some S & M lyrics, and pretty much has the most energy out of any of the other songs. 'Run Silent Run Deep' is probably the best song on offer here, though. And 'Mother Russia', Comrade Harris's tribute to Communism or Marxist philosophy or whatever it is, has some dramatic music, but he did it better in 'To Tame a Land'. Davey shines on his solos for 'Holy Smoke' and 'Public Enema', I must say.<BR>I just wasn't catching a vibe from this music, but I honestly tried. There are a few good moments, but not enough for me to keep this in my collection. As a HARDCORE fan of their heavier, pre-synth days, even the lack of synthesizers on here didn't warm me up to it enough. I'd rather have synthesizers and a melodic guitar player than no synthesizers and some noisy wannabe. The absence of Adrian's melodic riffs and solos is painfully palpable.
B00005JKEZ|4.0|\\"The Adventures of Robin Hood\\" was the second film to be made based on our hero in green tights. The original silent version starred Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and, although in this version Errol Flynn lacks something of Doug's viceral masculinity (he does look a tad feminine in those tights), Flynn more than makes up for this shortcoming with bravado, charm and dialogue! The film concerns Robin?s (Flynn) attempt to steal from the rich and give to the poor. His run ins with the law, of course, immediately brand him an outlaw to the temporary aristocracy helmed by the evil Prince John (Claude Rains) and his diabolical henchman, Sir Guy of Gisbourne (Basil Rathbone). Olivia DeHavilland - long a Warner stock romantic lead, costars as Maid Marianne. At first she abhors Robin?s bravado to which she associates deception, but later learns of his charitable work and succumbs to his sexy good charm. From that point on it is all sword-fights and high comedy in this effortless and masterful swashbuckler from director, Michael Curtiz.<BR>Unfortunately, Warner's transfer is a mixed bag. After a beautiful main title sequence we get several opening shots that are excessively grainy. Here and there the grain structure crops up - particularly in long shots. Because it's not consistent it tends to look glaring when it does show up. Although the negative looks better than ever before there continue to be chips present throughout. Also, there's NO EXCUSE for the aliasing and edge enhancement that crops up every now and then - once again, particularly in long shots. Extras include documentaries, audio commentaries, featurettes, musical outtakes, trailers and oh, just too, too much to discuss herein - almost 4 hours worth. You really get your money's worth with this disc! Bravo!<BR>Considering the vintage of the film elements and, in considering how bad the film looked before, Warner Brothers has achieved a monumental restoration effort. If they could get a handle on the digital mastering they'd really be off to the races! Still, A MUST HAVE for any classic film buff!
B000063DHL|3.0|After the highly successful `World Slavery Tour' Iron Maiden had their work cut out for them for a follow-up. `Somewhere in Time' is not a bad album, in fact it has some great songs on it, but I don't think it stands up well against the likes of `Piece of Mind', `Number of the Beast', or `Powerslave'. The cover also portrays one of the strangest incarnations of Eddie. From a skeletal mummy, he now appears to be a human without skin.<br />The title track starts off promising as does `Wasted Years' made famous by their MTV video. It was great to see the band jamming in a recording studio and having Eddie's six year history flashed everywhere like subliminal messages. The other single, and my favorite track is `Stranger in a Strange Land'. I think it was about the Neanderthal that scientists had found in an icy wasteland a few years earlier. They found his weapons, equipment, and clothes fully intact. But the song can have so many different interpretations. I have found myself to be a `Stranger' in many places I've been.<br />`Sea of Madness' is not bad, neither is `Heaven can Wait'. But the rest of the album has it's share of clunkers. I think that Steve Harris is the kind of writer who will pick a subject or topic to write about and instead of letting it go will force it instead to make it work. `Deja'vu' is possibly one of Maiden's weakest tracks ever, though it was a good idea. `The Lonliness of the Long Distance Runner' is another example of a forced idea. Maybe a U.S. Marine or marathon runner has a special connection with that song, but for most of Iron Maiden's fans, the song is not something we can relate to.<br />Lastly we have `Alexander the Great' it is far too obvious that Maiden was going back to the well for another `Rime of the Ancient Mariner' from Powerslave. Alexander doesn't work though. It's a rambling account of ancient battles and cities. Forcing rhymes like Mesopotamia and Alexandria and squeezing as much as they can into this musical biography is just to much pushing and not enough flowing.<br />Not recommended for the first time Iron Maiden buyer. For a first album I would suggest `Live after Death'. That album should have done for Maiden what ALIVE! Did for KISS. It was their greatest moment as they were at the height of the creativity.y is just to much pushing and not enough flowing.<br />Not recommended for the first time Iron Maiden buyer.

B00003CXD5|4.0|&quot;The Treasure of Sierra Madre&quot; is a story of greed, deception, murder and adventure - and that's just for starters. It stars Humphrey Bogart as Fred Dobbs, a reprobate who eschews the work ethic at every turn for a handout or the prospect of getting rich quick. Naturally, a prospect from an old codger, Howard (Walter Huston) - that Dobbs and another greed driven young hopeful, Bob Curtin (Tim Holt) steak out their claim for gold in the mountains ? suddenly appeals to Fred?s cynical quest for untold wealth. But the journey to rich rewards is marred by Fred?s paranoia that everyone is trying to steal from him. This fear ultimately leads Fred to mistrust both his compatriots and actually attempt to kill Bob in the middle of the desert. The betrayal backfires for all those involved with the treasure remaining an elusive mirage that none of the principle players ever get their hands on. John Huston masterfully directs and costars in a cameo, in this masterful, gritty and thrilling action/adventure/drama!<BR>Warner's gives us a cleaned up but very inconsistent transfer. There are a few problems worth noting, including aliasing and shimmering of fine details that crops up and detract from the visual presentation. There's also a bit of pixelization and some edge enhancement. The gray scale has been nicely balanced. Fine details are beautifully rendered. You won't believe this film is over 60 years old! One aside: approximately two thirds into the film, at the point where Fred almost kills Bob in the desert, the image quality suddenly spirals into a third generation looking print quality that is totally out of sync with the rest of the video presentation. There?s an incredible amount of excessive film grain and age related artifacts. This poor video quality is never explained on either the film?s audio commentary track or the documentary that is included on the making of the film so I, in turn, am at a total loss to explain it myself. At best I have to assume thatno first generation print master was available for this portion of the film, hence other film sources were considered and ultimately utilized to make the film whole again. The audio is mono but well balanced.<BR>Extras include documentaries on both the film and the career of John Huston, featurettes, audio commentaries, trailers and a stills gallery. Very handsomely mounted and very thoughtfully put together. My hat off to the good people at Warner Brothers!
B000063DI9|2.0|Some still say to this day that 7soa7s is Iron Maiden's crowning achievement. I never understood why. I remember in high school there was a kid I knew who wore this tape out on his walkman because he was so obsessed with it, he couldn't stop listening to it. The day the tape finally wore thin and broke, we went out that day to buy a new one. Folks will claim that this is Maiden as a sophisticated, articulate, and composing geniuses. Well........ I disagree.<br />This album, from the first day I heard it, sounded like a commercial cop-out. `The Evil that Men do' is the same lyrics going over and over and over. `Can I Play with Madness' is definitely not Maiden at their best, musically or literally. Both these songs were played on MTV so much I found myself sick of Iron Maiden for awhile (egad, just kill me now for such blasphemy). Alas it was true. How I longed for the videos `Number of the Beast' or `Aces High'. Instead Headbanger's ball assaulted me with Adrian Smith's bleach blond mullet, glacier stage sets, and weak, commercial, SYNTHESISER pop metal.<br />Over the years I've tried to get into this album as I put it on every now and then, but it just doesn't work for me. It's too bizarre, too popish, and is missing all the things I love about Maiden. Mainly Steve Harris's galloping basslines.<br />Said to be Iron Maiden's `concept' album. I never cared to know the story behind this thing. So a 7th son of a 7th son has special powers, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know KISS tried the same thing with their album `The Elder'. You see where that went.
B00004SZWD|5.0|Every Musical Genuis Has his Masterpiece. With Prince it was Sign &quot;O&quot; the times. With Michael Jackson it was thriller and with stevie wonder its songs in the key of life.

My Advice with Songs in the key of life is Buy it! i promise you will dance , sing and Cry with this perfect piece of musical HIStory. God bless steveland Morris
0385504209|1.0|I do not like the premise of this book.  It casts doubt on Christianity and the true nature of God.  It disturbs me that this is on the best-seller list, and that millions of people are being exposed to this rubbish.  Your time would be much better served by reading The Purpose-Driven Life by Rick Warren.  He describes the truth of Christianity with such wisdom that your life will be transformed forever.
B000002I4S|5.0|With 'Giant Steps' Coltrane takes a historical plunge, by recording the first album containing only his own compositions. After years picking up the best from the best (Dizzy, Davis, Monk) he brought into the studio some of the musicians that had accompanied him in the 'Kind of Blue' and 'Milestones' sessions a couple of years before (Paul Chambers on bass, Wynton Kelly on piano and James Cobb on drums), among others, to complete a set of songs that would show the world a bit more of what Coltrane's work was made of: a mix of honey and thunder, a balance between bliss and a certain degree of pain, when he delivers his powerful &quot;sheets of sound&quot; (as in the case of the title track or &quot;Mr. P.C.&quot; -dedicated to fellow musician P. Chambers-) alongside a delicate ballad like the beautiful &quot;Namia&quot;, lovingly named after his wife. Complementing the original works in this remastered version are alternate takes of five of the seven original tracks.<br />Coltrane would deliver a sound that would become synonimous with musical genius and exploration, spiritual sense and purpose, and inner struggle, in a sense. When you are in the presence of his music, you can't remain indifferent: it is bound to move you and if you let it creep inside your soul, it will change it inside out forever. Later down the road would come 'My Favorite Things', 'A Love Supreme' and many other incredible musical creations that took on a life of their own. Come take the step into Coltrane's solo works, with 'Giant Steps'.
B0000062GE|5.0|I started to listen to this band shortly after their second album (Wither Blister Burn + Peel) and I immediately loved every minuted of it.  Then, when I thought that they couldn't release anything better, they came out with this.  Absolutely amazing!  At the time, I was going through a tough breakup, and believe it or not, listening to it made me feel much better about myself.  The brilliant lyrics touched me in a way that is almost indescribable.  But, on a good note, this CD also rocks.  Its a must have!
0394873742|5.0|I first found this book at the library, then had to have it for home.  My children love to look at it-even the littlest would crawl over to sit on it.  I've bought it as a gift for more children than I can count!!
B000059XXZ|5.0|Batman was really the first of what would turn out to be a decade and a half blitz of superhero movies taken right out of the comics.  The following movies have sprouted as a result to the snappy success of Batman: Spider man, The Hulk, X-Men, the Rocketeer, Daredevil, and of course its three pathetic sequels.  What the movie Batman did was bring to life superheroes, take them out of its animated comic book form or simple-minded tv series and try to make them believable.<br />Let me say first off that Batman is in no way the perfect film out there.  There are some things about this film I would've done differently.  Such as some corny scenes and useless characters who are more decorative than important.  However, these are quite minor errors when you look at how big this film is, and I don't mean length or size.  Big as in depth.  The plot is intriguing, engaging, exciting to viewers.  The character of Batman/Bruce Wayne is so very believable combing darkness with sophistication.  The villain the Joker is the ultimate bad guy, combing violent humor with unimaginable insanity.  This film is ENTERTAINMENT, with serious depth in plot and character.<br />I know that Michael Keaton has unfairly gotten some heat for playing too dark a Batman.  But these people who say this apparently don't know jack about the comic \\"The Dark Knight\\" and don't understand the character of Batman himself.  Batman is supposed to be a dark superhero.  I mean, he's a \\"Batman\\", bats are dark creatures.  Michael Keaton who is among the most underrated actors ever, can play the perfect Dr. Jackyll and Mr. Hyde character with the dark, forboding Batman to the brainy, social Bruce Wayne.<br />I'm sorry but Val Kilmner and George Clooney played two pathetic superheroes in replacement of Keaton with the sequals.  They were more Bruce Wayne than Batman.  While Keaton makes a great balance between the two.<br />Jack Nicholson is phenominal as the Joker.  And it makes sense for him to be casted as this for those of us that have seen \\"The Shining.\\"  He makes a good psycho, who knows how to laugh at all the wrong moments, and makes the character believable.  I can't think of too many other movies that take the time as this one did attempting to create a serious amount of character development and explanation on why the villain became the way he did.  This made the depth of the film complete and the showdown between the Joker and Batman worth watching till the end.<br />Unfortunately, the love interest Kim Basinger plays Vicky Vail, who is a worthless character in a lot of ways.  Other than being fascinating with \\"bats\\" and being stalked by the Joker, she plays no huge role.  It would've been great if her character had been this assertive reporter, torn between whether Batman is a villain or hero, than be this dame in distress and lusted after by the main villain.  Although her character is hesitant over Batman, she is all too willing to share a bed with Wayne, thereby this strength in her character is lost.<br />Other characters like Grissom (played by Jack Palance) had a minor role that makes sense on why it was so minor.  Then you have a dufus like Alex Knox, another reporter, who is what Vail needed to be: assertive.  But he's annoying as hell and not funny.  Again, this film isn't perfect, but it's still great.<br />Overall Batman is a superhero form of Dr. Jackyll and Mr. Hyde.  Only neither side of Bruce Wayne is clearly bad.  Dark, yes.  Bad, no.  I think Batman is a unique superhero, because he is a no nonsense, dark character.  He's not like a Superman or Spiderman who make witty remarks and are kind and caring towards all.  He's a loner, a survivelist who has seen horror in his life that changes him forever.  This film does such a great job pointing this out, explaining again and again why Batman is the way he is.  Only the dense would miss it.<br />I recommend Batman to anybody who wants to see a great movie with a good storyline and good characters.  It'sentertaining, it's dark, and it's worth the experience.<br />Grade: A+ntertaining, it's dark, and it's worth the experience.<br />Grade: A+
B00005Y6YB|1.0|This version is only 2/3's the original.  While I don't consider Lonesome Dove to be as great a film as The Unforgiven, consider The Unforgiven being cut down to 2/3's it's original length.  Would you consider it to be worth considering over the original.  I doubt it. Major character development and plotlines would have to be cut.  <br />Lonesome Dove, in my opinion, is one of the greatest, if not the greatest mini-series to ever play on television.  Robert Duval and Tommy Lee Jones give Academy Award deserving (if it was on the big screen) performances.  <br />However, everyone should wait for the original, full length version to come out on DVD. I know I will. <br />If this DVD had been the original, it would recieve 5 stars.
0671027387|3.0|This was an excellent book marred by chapters full of what I would call &quot;filler&quot;. The plot of the book is moving right along, when everything comes to a sudden halt with an entire chapter full of background info on one of the character or interrupted with seemingly useless interaction among other characters in the book. As an example, the main character can be at death's door on an iceberg when the story line suddenly switches to what politician had sex with which assistant on who's desk in Washington D.C. I found myself skimming page after page to get back to the &quot;action&quot;. Again, this was a very good book with a great plot, but it should have been about one-third shorter.
B000002KOO|5.0|This album was a quick creative pinnacle for this group of post-Clapton Mayal alums. A record that was a great jump in confidence, sophistication, imagination, over the band's second album- released in the US as `English Rose' and which bore the Fleetwood Mac originals &quot;Albatross&quot; and &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot; (popularised by the Santana cover). English Rose (called, If memory serves, `Mr. Wonderful' in the UK) was in turn a strong forging ahead from the band's self-titled debut (yes Virginia, there are two albums called &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot;) of 1968 which was pure sad-and-funk blues.<br />If Then Play On could be imagined as a movie, then it would be considered a `fish-and-chips' western. Peter Green would be the singer-songwriter with the voice with no name; because several of the tracks have a deep, stark evocation of the Old West. In my personal case, this impression may have been amplified by the fact I was living in Desert Hot Springs, California (often visited by Hollywood crews in a bygone age when filming background footage for flicks like Showdown at the O.K Corral) in 1970 when I picked up this disc at a Woolworth's in nearby Palm Springs. This southwestern blues feeling is deepest on the magnificant track &quot;Oh Well.&quot;<br />I wish they would release someday the outtakes for this record, because the tracks &quot;Searching for Madge&quot; and &quot;Fighting for Madge&quot; were obvious sectioned edits from what must have been a most intensive, glorious jam. On the finished album, the jam segments are broken up by beautiful orchestrations.<br />This CD release also contains two extra tracks, one of which is a very fine instrumental, called &quot;My Dream&quot; and goes well when placed next to the lovely &quot;Underway&quot; which to this day feels like a sequel to the band's classic `Albatross.'

B00006ZCFH|5.0|Ever spend time at a listening booth in one of the big record stores and stumble upon a CD you would never consider buying? If not, try it sometime.  Sometimes you'll stumble upon something so beautiful. \\"World Wide Underground\\" was my beautiful discovery. Although pretty indifferent about Badu's past projects, I was blown away by this one, at first listen.  Ever hear a track so hypnotic you wish it would last longer than the standard 3-4 minutes?  Well my favorite track, \\"I Want You\\" clocked in at 10. Love that! I also love how Eryka Badu flips the script, changes the rules and offers something remarkably different.  And this philisophical, spiritual diva surely lets you know there's no need to be deep ALL the time.  On this project, she lets her hair down and simply has fun.  No big message here, just a musical roller coaster ride that takes you on dips so funky, you'll be snappin' your fingers and tappin' your toes in no time.  Give \\"World Wide Underground\\" a chance to lead you and it will.

B00005Y228|4.0|Yeah, it's nothing but cheesy, throw-away pop, but it's GOOD cheesy, throw-away pop.  There is no denying the Cathy Dennis penned &quot;Can't Get You Out Of My Head&quot;.  It's just too damn catchy.
0385504209|3.0|I will not deny that this was an engrossing read--I, like many other readers, was unable to put this book down.  Nevertheless, I was somehow expecting something more.  I don't really know what, but as fascinating as this story was, something fell short.  Maybe it was that the villain wasn't very villanous (and indeed his aims were arguably admirable).  Or maybe it was that the book wasn't long enough.  The Da Vinci Code is the type of thriller with a masterful exposition that quickly fizzles into 200 pages of less-inspired but still intriguing writing.  I don't know.  But it's a good read, even if it isn't perfect.
B00006LSM3|4.0|The second Beatle to leave us and this is his final album; finished right before he passed away.

B00008EY9G|5.0|I can't help but notice that a many of the reviews on this movie were not complimentary. Some totally bashed it, which I can't see at all. There are plenty of real stinkers around to write about without unfairly trashing this excellent movie.<br />Maybe I'm easier to please, though I don't think so. Occasionally I do find some of the immensely popular movies disappointing but overall I don't think my tastes very from the norm.<br />I may have had an advantage because I had no expectations. I had not seen any clips or trailers (is that the right term?) and hadn't even heard of it. I just saw numerous copies of it in my local Blockbuster and figured it must be at least popular if not good, so I watched this movie with a clean slate - no preconceived ideas.<br />Now I won't get involved in how artsy or well directed or how good the acting was or the cinematography or any of the plethora of facets of movie making for which they give awards. To me, what I rate a movie depends strictly on how much I enjoyed the movie. Of course, all elements of movie making would come down to how well I enjoyed the movie but I not going to try and dissect this movie into components and analyze them.<br />Did I enjoy this Movie? Yes, thank you, In Spades! Five stars worth, so lets talk a little about the movie. I'm going to start with the end.<br />I'm positive, even the most vociferous detractor of this movie did not guess the end of Identity. I can tell you, it came out of left field and was a total surprise. Perhaps one of the all time most surprising endings.<br />Setting<br />Identity was pretty much set in central Nevada at a run down Motel in a chronic rainstorm. When it wasn't set at the Motel it would flash to an eleventh hour appeal meeting for a convicted multiple slasher/killer, between the Governor and defending and prosecuting, counsel. The purpose for this is at first unclear and I'm going to leave it that way.<br />Plot<br />Several travelers get stranded because of the weather and are forced to check into a remote motel in the middle of nowhere, when all of a sudden one of the travelers, a b'tchey, semi-has been movie actress, gets murdered, Then another and another.

B0000039LE|5.0|It's a rarity when critics and horrorphiles can agree that a horror film is pretty good, but they certainly did for this film and Halloween is the greatest, in my opinion.  The sequels can't come close; though H20 was good, it wasn't even remotely as frightening, and part 8?  What the hell were they thinking?  Busta Rhymes?!  Aaaghh!!!<br />This great film is a prime example of the phrase &quot;often imitated, never equalled&quot;.  Amen to that!  &quot;The Shape&quot; lives on!
B000001EAQ|4.0|Im not sure what I like most of this cd.The parts of bonos voice<BR>I can hear clearly over the instuments or the voice I cant hear <BR>because of the instruments.This is surely due to the fact that I<BR>have not listened closely to it lately because I dont have it I threw it out the window one day and did not replace it.When I find it in a music store I say Bono what are you asking for Im not paying 18.00 for that.Bono if you articulate yourself better I may do whatever and give you the 18.00 dollars because I miss that music mostly the songs that lull one into a false sense<BR>of security and make one daydream and if you fall asleep with it on your taking a chance of dreaming about bono that hidden meaning and mixed messages change the brain chemistry and one can always slide out from under his music the problem is when one doesnt want to.
B00005LC6Z|3.0|Critics bashed this film when it came out in theatres.  Yes, it's vastly inferior to the first, but Michael Myers (played well here by stuntman Dick Warlock) is still a creepy presence.  Forget that the hospital is poorly lit and ridiculously understaffed; forget that the killer breaks windows by simply walking into them; forget that his scalpel can support a nurse in mid-air, without her sliding off it; etc.  The music is altered slightly at times, but is still creepy.  And the ending certainly looked liked the door to any other sequels was slammed shut; unfortunately in this day and age we know better.  Good fun.

B00002MZ4W|4.0|Because of her self-protective attitude and refusal to exploit her looks (the exception being the &quot;Criminal&quot; video), Fiona Apple's second album didn't get nearly the attention it deserved. &quot;When the Pawn&quot; shows lots of growth from her already remarkable debut &quot;Tidal&quot;. This time multi-instrumentalist Jon Brion handles the production (taking over for Andrew Slater, who produced &quot;Tidal&quot;) and the results are fantastic. Exotic instruments and percussion beautifully back up Fiona's husky, evocative alto and piano playing. Lyrically, her songwriting is even stronger (although even more dark). The album seems to be a self-portrait of a young woman trying to take responsibility for her own pain and pathos, and having trouble relating to others as a result. Standout tracks include &quot;Limp&quot; (which makes Alanis' &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; seem tame and contrived in comparison), &quot;Fast as you Can&quot; (a hyperkinetic warning to a would-be lover), &quot;A Mistake&quot; (an ode to the growth that comes from taking the wrong path) and &quot;Paper Bag&quot;. It's been almost four years since this album now, and I'm hoping Fiona hasn't given up on the music industry. Because whether or not Fiona needs the attention of performing, we desperately need real talent like hers.
B000002JSR|1.0|Don't buy this Led Zeppelin  Coda C.D.  They needed gas for their jet and made it quick . They had to have been on drugs and it is the worst Led Zeppelin  C.D. . Don't waste your money. You have never heard any of these songs and there is a reason why.  If your between 35 and 50 and don't have it in your collection; there is a reason why.<br />Don't Buy Coda. You're wasting your $$$$$$$$$$$$ .
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna is an enigma. She's a pop star who also happens to be a real artist, a flash in the pan that's lasted 20 years, and a pinup with the shrewd mind of a CEO. So it's no surprise that her 10th studio album, American Life, is full of contradictions. Musically, it juxtaposes folky acoustic guitars with abrasive techno beats and synths. Lyrically, Madonna uses her position gained by 20 years of brilliant marketing to preach, strangely, about the evils of the media, and the emptiness of fame and materialism. This is either a bold, sincere move or a load of crap. I think it's the former. Standout tracks on this CD include &quot;Hollywood&quot; (a song that's not about the specific place so much as everything in our world that's phony and illusionary), &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; (one of the most beautiful love songs she's ever written), X-Static Process (an acoustic lullaby about the dangers of losing yourself in a relationship) and Die Another Day (a misunderstood song about destroying your ego).
B00006JDVV|4.0|Matthew McConaughey should have lost the tattoos and the vacant stare, and maybe this tidy little sci-fi thriller would have worked better.  And Christian Bale looked so much like James Brolin and turned out to be rather wimpy vs. McConaughey, so that didn't help either.  And why waste Alice Krige in such a small, if significant, role?  Ah. but that great Isabella Schoppora (or something like that?) was beautiful and turned out to be the &quot;heart&quot; of the movie.<br />The effects are mindblowing and the best dragons to ever hit the silver screen---wish we'd have had more of them, too.  But overall, it's a fairy tale, replete with sacrificial heroes and tense plots, but somehow the final showdown seemed a little rushed and anti-climactic.<br />But I enjoyed watching it and entering without too great expectations, find it a movie worth seeing.
0156027321|1.0|This is a coming-of-age story.  Pi realizes that in order to survive in the world he must overcome his own demon (represented by the tiger) and get control over himself.  He must learn when to assert himself and when to yield, etc. <br />Some passages are beautifully written but they are not enough to compensate for the gore and violence in the other parts of the story. I am disappointed that this is such a popular book.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I LOVED THIS MOVIE!  I'd never seen it in the movies, and when my wife bought it for me for a Christmas present, I wasn't sure how I'd like it.  IT IS A WONDERFUL AND CHARMING MOVIE.  What's amazing with the Pixar animation is how great it uses its characters as if they were really human.  I even found myself thinking it was a real cast!  Just the way they used Billy Crystal's Mike &quot;eye&quot; is amazing!  With so little to work with, they captured the many moods of this delightful little rogue.  Goodman was terrific as Sully; Mary Gibbs is so much fun as the little girl, Boo, whose many moods are presented in such childlike wonder, you can't help but shed a few tears at the end.  Also effective are James Coburn as the nasty spidereman boss; the inimitable Steve Buscemi was devilishly evil as Randall; I don't know who voiced Roz, but she was great.  The movie has so much going for it:  clever scripting; generous doses of satire; and a song that deserved its Oscar.<br />This is one fine family film and I highly recommend it!
B00005JL78|5.0|I loved Minority Report. The movie had me hooked early and took me on a fantastic ride.<br />The story is complex but in one short paragrah I'll tell a little bit about it. John Anderton(Tom Cruise) is the chief of Pre-Crime in Washington D.C. and is accused of future murder. The movie then goes on a wild goose chase where he is trying to prove he didn't do it.<br />Tom Cruise is outstanding in the movie. This is one of his greatest performances of all time. He plays the character well. You feel for John Anderton as you see the movie unwind. You feel for him because of the fine acting that Cruise does.<br />Colin Farrel is good in the movie aswell. He plays Danny Whitmore a federal agent is trying to see if pre-crime works. He ends up chasing Anderton in the movie. He plays the character so well. Farrel does such a good job of making you hate him. I love that kind of stuff.<br />The special effects in the movie are some of the best all time. They bring out some scary ideas in the movie that could be possible some time in the future.<br />Roger Ebert said &quot;Minority Report reminds us of why we go to the movies&quot; and I couldn't agree any more. This is a cinematic masterpiece and a must own to any DVD collection.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This must one of the best CD of the year. Well I may not be unbiased because I alredy loved the first album. This one is different from the first one, more quiet, but so rich. Each song is full of treasures of sounds which you don't hear in the first time. Maynard, the singer keeps singing so well... I needed to listen to it many times to love it like Mer De Noms. Even if you don't like alternative rock or metal, I recommend you this album, because I think anyone can like it.<BR>And I saw them live last saturday... Never seen such a good band live...
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I loved it, fun, imaginative and Not predictable. I have missed the days of good theme albums and it wasnt untill I heard Greendale I realized how much I missed them. Thank You Neil.
B000089RVR|5.0|I've played this collection over and over, its so beautiful in<br />so many places, the words, her vocals just chill right through me. One of the stronger efforts this year, she refined her<br />best assets and touches on some trendy stuff without overduing,<br />justs makes it abit more accessible to radio. Its been a while<br />since her debut but I know I will be listening to this and finding new things along the way.  She really has the most underrated vocals out there, she doesn't have to scream, she<br />just opens her mouth and takes you places. Great second effort!<br />Its nice when one of my favorites on this is also the last track. Nothing forced about this just beautiuful, mellow, magic<br />music.
B000089RVR|5.0|Dido is one of the most talented artists to come out in a long time. I really enjoy her music. I bought her CD No Angel and i couldn't believe how good ALL HER SONGS were. It was really worth the money. I cant wait to get her new CD.<BR>I wonder if she's ever going to come to concer in the SF Bay ARea
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I liked Mer De Noms, but I wasn't ecstatic about it. I am quite honestly disappointed with much of the music being released these days and cannot name many bands that have captured my attention.<br />However, &quot;Thirteeth Step&quot; far surpasses my expectations of the new APC CD. I am simply blown away by the emotion in this music. I captivates me and holds me through the entire album. The Noose is by far my favorite, and is spooky in a way of its own.<br />My friends who I have had listen to this have mostly not heard of or not had any interest in APC. Now I have changed their minds. One just wrote me an email to say she was buying &quot;Mer De Noms&quot; because of the &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; album.
B0000B1OFL|2.0|I just saw the new 'The Italian Job'. I never walk out on movies, but, man, this one tempted me. After about 15 mins I asked my wife was she enjoying it, and she replied that she was. She doesn't often surprise me but this time she did. <br />The only good things about this movie were the minis, and the villains (I love a well-played cad). On the downside, nearly every frame contained an advertisement for some product ...headsets, TV's, cars, stereos and computers (the brand name sticker on laptops cannot usually be read upside down!). The dialogue was rubbish, the characters were sterotypes, and the plot laughably predictable. I could not sympathise with any of the characters. <br />This movie has none of the wit and charm of the original. I would give it 1 1/2 stars if I could, so 2 is being generous. ...
B00005176F|5.0|Depending on your point of view and musical philosophy, &quot;Best Of&quot; albums are either disastrous wastes of money not intended for 'true' fans (because they remove a song from its original intended context); or, they're great for the everyday music lover of modest income (because they provide the quality material from $100 worth of CDs on a singe disc).  Without disclosing my financial situation, let's just say I fall in the latter category, and as such I love his record. (And I am just as true a fan as someone who has every Blur album, import and B-side (on limited edition vinyl).)<br />I find that listening to &quot;Blur: Best Of&quot; always puts me in a joyous, fun-loving mood.  In an age when musicians still insist on inundating us with depressing and/or overly intellectual songwriting (from the dead dog songs of country to the dead pimp songs of rap), Blur are a breath of fresh, inventive, fun air.  (This isn't to say they don't explore darker themes from time to time, but that when they do it's just... well, more fun to listen to.)  I can't really explain it (which probably makes me a bad reviewer), but something about the record just lifts my spirits when I listen to it, makes life a little lighter.<br />The strongest tracks, in my opinion, include:<br />Beetlebum / The Universal / Coffee and TV / Tender / Girls and Boys / Country House / This Is a Low / Music Is My Radar.<br />I want to give props to &quot;For Tomorrow,&quot; because I have not seen it mentioned in any other reviews, and I have never heard it before.  A great, unique song with a fantastic medley of sounds in the last few minutes: horns, a chorus of female singers, and Damon Albarn chanting about &quot;holding on for tomorrow.&quot;  Brilliance.
B000005DQR|5.0|I've owned this CD for about a year and half now, and it's still one of my favorite CD's I listen too - I have it in rotation right after Bazooka Tooth. <br />It's so dark - It's so listenable. I mean, you don't even have to like DJ or Hip-Hop music at all - But somehow, this CD will touch you. I let my dad listen to it, (he hates anything to do with hip-hop or techno) and he even appreciated it.<br />This is music to the ears... anyone can get down to this CD, and his newest one (private press) is even better, in my opinion.<br />Excellent CD. 5 stars.
B0000CG9N8|5.0|As usual with Muse songs, some numbers are pretty heavy, but all numbers on this masterpiece contain so much creative ideas and contain so much refinement that with no doubt : Muse is a rock group that writes history .....  <BR>Chris and Dominic are excellent musicians, Matthew is a genius : excellent songwriter, top guitarist, and somebody who plays piano very well...<BR>Contains an interesting DVD with \\"the making of\\" Absolution.
B00000IP4H|4.0|4.5 stars. From the very begining, a countdown ensues then the listener is bombarded by memorable riffs, excellent drumming, and Chuck Billy growling like never before.  At first, I was hesitant to purchase this album, having read a lackluster critical review.  What a misstep that would have been?  This death metal/thrash hybrid was just what I needed as an encore to my first purchase, \\"The Gathering.\\"  I was an early fan of Testament back in the 1980s, but only ever bought \\"Souls of Black.\\"  As of now, I am not interested where these guys have been, only where they are headed. Let the New Millenium begin!!!  \\"Three days in darkness in two-thousand-twelve!!!\\"
B0000CG9N8|5.0|From the first time I saw the \\"Time is Running Out\\" video on their official website, (......), I knew this album would be killer.  I was right, this album is INCREDIBLE!  There aren't any bands out there that can be soooooo heavy and so melodic at the same time.  It's a shame this isn't being marketed in the U.S., we need songs like these on the airwaves!  This band has showed progress with every release, and have definately shrugged off the Radiohead comparisons.  BUY THIS ALBUM!  It's worth the extra money as an import!  Rock on...<BR>Standout tracks include Time is Running Out, Sing for Absolution, Stockholm Syndrome, Interlude, Thoughts of A Dying Atheist.  U.S. Customers be warned... the bonus DVD is in PAL format and will not play in a US DVD player!
B0000DBJDL|5.0|I owned the VHS of this show, but the tape's gone all bad & I'm eagerly waiting for the DVD...The absence of spectators adds to the overall haunting effect...though this is pre-Waters domination time, one can strongly feel the Waters influence in the music, though everyone plays marvellously, the improvisations reaching a fantastic high never before seen with ANY other band...the concert(yes, concert)makes me rate Gilmour as one of the best guitarists of all times, if not THE best...Mason on the drums during \\"Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun\\" & \\"One Of These Days\\" is breathtaking...the choice of location just adds to the magnificence of the spectacle...I rate this as an immortal classic. I wish the guys get back together...split apart, though good, they cannot recreate the magic without each other. YES!A Must Buy!
B0000013GT|5.0|With so many artists (I mean rappers because they take the word artists for granted) lacking depth, subject matter, and quite honestly intelligence, I still have OutKast and a few others to hold on to.  In this repetitive game of rap (formerly known as hiphop), these two cats continue to set trends and explore uninhabited terrains in everything from rhyme patterns, beats, and substance to music videos and album covers.  True, Southernplayalistic is a personal favorite of mine.  But at the end of the day, I have to go with ATLiens for top billing.  If you sit down and \\"listen\\" to this album, you'll understand what hiphop was and should be.  Every cut on this album is special, but give a special listen to 13th Floor/Growing Old.  Also for all of you rap fans who can't seem to think out of the box, check out some Talib Kweli, Nas, Goodie Mob, Common, The Roots, and Gangstarr to get you started on the road to true hiphop.  Right on to the real.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|Donnie Darko is a gem with many flaws. The flaws reflect a little light, giving rise to the mistakened belief that the gem is more complex than it would appear. But when you look closer, the gem is just cracked. Nothing more or less.<br />This is as true for the movie as it is for the lead character. Jake G. has three basic looks he gives the camera--the puppy-dog, the creepy-as-hell snear, and the arrogant/confused/drunken teen. These he does well; but these do not a brilliant actor make. I wish him the best, though, and imagine he has better in him.<br />!Spoilers follow!<br />The rest of the characters are paper thin. There is no nuance--each one is a cardboard cut out. Except for the giant time-traveling killer rabbit. Now there's something you don't see every day! My hat's off to whoever thought that up.<br />I kept putting up with undeveloped and cliche characters and an oddly paced plot (that kept me interested, though) for some sort of payoff. And when it came, I was disappointed. A simple Christological metaphor does not a movie make--in this case, Donnie apparently dies so that an alternate time-stream can be inacted, one that does not involve the death of his family and girlfriend.<br />This movie is not 5 stars, nor 4, but is regretfully an average movie because of its flaws. Perhaps you can dig into it and watch it 5-6 times and become more accepting of the trite conversations, potty mouth humor, cardboard characters, and did I mention bad lighting, but that does not change the fact that they are there.<br />Nevertheless, give it a watch. It's worth a rental, but because of the language, it's not for kids or anyone bothered by foul language.
B00005JMCT|1.0|I saw this in theaters and I just KNEW there'd be an extended dvd coming. Many scenes seemed to be intentionally cut short. There's a number of scenes where it just appears to be cut badly. On the plus side, the parts that were supposed to be funny were in fact funny. Unless you're a die hard fan, not imperative to own it.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Great effort by the Maiden boys. Better than Brave New World. I do agree with some of the reviewers that the songs could be cut down a bit. Some of the intros just go on too long. But, thankfully Maiden sounds like Maiden. In this world of hip hop and pop garbage that's a good thing. Up the Irons!!!
B00005JKEZ|5.0|At Last....what every classic movie DVD package should be. The BEST looking version ever of this great movie, tons of awesome extras, two of the best Looney Tunes ever and lots more! Let's hope that Warner Home Video will do the same with unreleased titles such as \\"The Bandwagon\\", and \\"Easter Parade\\". We're still waiting............................
0743201140|2.0|Self-help or not, as I read this book I felt that I was being &quot;talked down to&quot;. The author probably would make an excellent kindergarten teacher, because only there is teaching by repetition considered an option. I feel that all the \\"advice\\" could have been said in about 10 pages or so. <br />I understand, however, that there are some people who enjoy reading such books and perhaps my opinion is tainted by the fact that I have not read that many \\"self-help\\" books. But I am a regular \\"inspiration book\\" reader, and I have been more inspired by \\"Jack: Straight from the Gut\\", \\"A Passion to Win\\", etc. <br />I probably would have finished reading this book had I not gotten tired of the redundancy. This may be a good read if you have recently broken your leg and need something to pass the time. For me, I have a better source of nagging: my wife.
B00008X5J1|4.0|I consider this to be one of the better films of 2002, a list which possibly might also include \\"The Pianist\\", if you ignore the violence, and even the stylish World War II thriller \\"Enigma\\", a (relatively) unusual choice.  It comes close to being a Hollywood Epic, perhaps falling a little short. It is highly dramatic. In its emphasis on the impoverished living conditions in New York's Five Points district and on the gang warfare between Nativists and Irish immigrants, it resembles a Charles Dickens novel.  It has the quality of an expose or of muckraking;it appears to be a film with a social conscience, a fact which may be lost to the viewer because 1)it is also an expensive Hollywood film that seems to glorify in its excesses of violence and expensive sets and costumes, which presumably also give it greater entertainment value. Bill \\"the Butcher\\"Cutting's collection of knives, which he carries on every part of his body, and which he uses to kill his victims and to frighten pretty girls,is another example of Scorcese's willingness to bow to the dictates of mass appeal. Cutting's personality which I would describe as \\"WASP\\"(White Anglo-Saxon Protestant) may be historically accurate. 2) The script also contains considerable quantities of racism and prejudice,including lynchings (not only of blacks but also of other ne'er- do- wells), which presumably give it historical authenticity. Based on #1 and #2 above, I would say this is not a serious film, certainly not a documentary about squalid living conditions, though the film has plenty of that, too. It's more like a musical, a historic \\"West Side Story\\", perhaps.   The rich only appear rarely in this film, and usually in an unfavorable light, to provide contrast with the life of the common man and of the immigrant. In its no-holds-barred, masculine approach to political corruption and to the Draft Riots of 1864,when poor young men were sent to the Civil warfront like pigs to the slaughter, it almost resembles a Hollywood Western, perhaps \\"The Wild Bunch\\". It is ostensibly the story of one man's personal vengeance for the death of his father, but the sights and sounds and violence of this film paint on a larger palette, which really detract from the social message, if there is one. DeCaprio might be considered somewhat miscast in this film as a boy trying to do a man's job.  The film, in the final end, is quite entertaining and also instructive about an important if sometimes ignored aspect of American history, and is quite closely related to the excellent novels of Caleb Carr: \\"The Alienist\\" and \\"The Angel of Darkness\\"
B0000033OZ|5.0|ELP was a prog band, but they had a distinct heavy metal edge to their music. In 1970, Black Sabbath, Uriah Heep, Deep Purple, and Led Zeppelin were the top heavy bands of the day. ELP's debut was filled with lush music, and instrumental magic. It was also very heavy. ELP was quickly linked to the infant heavy metal genre, as well as the prog style. The best prog-metal band out there was ELP, until Rush came along later in the decade.
B00006BTCA|5.0|I don't hear the Joy Division influence as much as some people, and in fact I think it sells Interpol a bit short. I LOVE Joy Division, so don't get me wrong, but Interpol sounds more like the best of Chameleons UK, Factory Records and 4AD mixed together.  However, there is nothing derivative or cover-esque about this band.  If you don't know the Chameleons UK, think Posies, Dead Can Dance, Poster Children, Wedding Present, Swans, Joy Division, Smiths, the better stuff from Stone Roses, some Railway Children, Kitchens of Distinction and The Jesus and Mary Chain all rolled up in one.  As I listen to this album (I got it yesterday and am finishing my 4th time through) I am continuously reminded of more and more bands and sounds from the 80's and 90's -- with modern twists and turns.  It's an absolutely wonderful album.
B000099T2L|5.0|This cd was a great experimental project for Beyonce. Her sound encompasses everything from pop to authentic R&amp;B music and on each track she changes her singing flow, so that every song sounds differently and NOT just like the one before it. (There are many artists who haven't quite accomplished this yet!!) It think this is  a wonderful solo effort by Beyonce...I recommend this to anyone who enjoys good music.
1559408855|2.0|Perhaps over the years this movies strength has faded, after reading all about it I decided I must see it and after over a year of searching I got my hands on a copy.  I was extremely dissapointed by the sloppiness of this movie, and being accustomed to bottom of the barrel b-movies and slasherflicks that's saying a good bit.  I didn't see anything remotely artistic in the way the story was presented and saw hardly anything disgusting in the movie other than the way it was handled.  Awful story that had me hating fascists no more than I hated them to begin with, and horrid plot structure that left many loose ends with no, believe me, no ending whatsoever.  Perhaps left up to the viewers interpretation one might see more than I from this picture.  I was just expecting so much more, in sense of gore, hardly believable though pretty gross, offensive nudity/rape scenes?  Once again fake looking and very staged, only a few scenes stuck with me, such as the young man being shot for having engaged in a willing act of sex.  His death scene was powerful, but the rest of the movie was bland cannon fodder for exploitationalists, much in the same vein as the Ilsa pictures, (I thought Ilsa had alot more going for it though). I would still recommend this as a one timer watch and you may see alot more in it than I, and I hope so.<br />I cannot reccomend the used DVD price for this picture whatsoever and can only see it's worth in the bargain bin.
B000002H97|5.0|Okay, let me start off by saying that this is probably the 2nd best album from metallica(master of puppets being the 1st). Now, some people say that metallica became too commercial, and that ...and justice for all was the last good album. This was the last good album. The songs are just great.<br />Enter Sandman-This song is a great song, i love the part where james hetfield sings &quot;hush little baby, dont say a word, and never mind that noise you heard. it's just the beast under your bed, in your closet, in your head.&quot; A true classic. 10/10<br />Sad but True-This is an awesome song. Very heavy guitar riffs, and great lyrics. The 3rd best song from the band(battery being the 1st and master of puppets being the 2nd), and the best on the album. I love to blast this awesome song. 10/10<br />Holier Than Thou-A faster-paced, underrated song. This is the song that is cool, but is underrated. Should get radio play, because it's just a great song. 9.5/10<br />The Unforgiven-A great, slower song. People say this song is too soft. Well... don't listen to them because obviously they are not true metallica fans. Melodic metal at it's finest.10/10<br />Wherever I May Roam-Great lyrics and some heavy guitar playing. Another underrated song. 10/10<br />Don't Tread on Me-A pretty good song.9/10<br />Through the Never-A good addition to the album. But nothing spectacular. 8.5/10<br />Nothing Else Matters-More melodic metal, a great ballad. Although ozzy osbourne writes the best ballads. 9.5/10<br />Of Wolf and Man-Another song that is nothing spectacular, sort of a mediocre song. 8/10<br />The God that Failed-Well... an o.k song, maybe a little more than o.k. 8/10<br />My Friend of Misery-A pretty cool song, a very nice addition to the album. 9.5/10<br />The Struggle Within-A great, fast paced song. 9/10
0446677450|3.0|I read this book in a string of books about &quot;fiscal responsibility&quot; and wealth.  I heard rave reviews and was very excited about this book.  Unfortunately, I don't think it lives up to the hype, at least for that segment of the population (me included) that does not have the entrepeneural spirit.  It's very uplifting for those who dream of being their own boss and making their fortune &quot;their way&quot;.  That's all fine and dandy.  However, for those of us who actually enjoy having a steady income without the stresses of owning our own business, this book doesn't really do anything.  It talks about investment options and the like, but it assumes you already have the money to invest.  On the contrary, the reason most people aren't wealthy is not because they aren't entrepeneural enough or savvy enough in their investment choices; rather, it's because they do not live within their means.  That's the first crucial step, and a step I feel this book overlooks entirely.<br />I much prefer &quot;The Millionaire Next Door&quot;.  Although many millionaires are indeed entrepeneurs, the Millionaire Next Door also notes that many millionaires are just regular working folks who are fiscally responsible with their money, a possibility entirely ignored in &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot;.  <br />So, for you entrepeneurs out there, this book will pump you up and give you the motivation you need to take the next entrepeneural step.  However, for you regular working folks who actually don't mind having an employer (me included), I say skip this book and read the Millionaire Next Door instead.
0385504209|4.0|The book has so many twists and turns, I just couldn't put it down once I began reading it. Dan Brown gets you involved in the story right from the beginning. Admittedly, the author draws on theories and concepts that have been written about previously by other people, but purely as a thriller, this book is very good. It is also evident that a fair amount of research went into this book. If you remember that this is after all, a work of fiction, you can really enjoy it.
B00009RGBS|1.0|This movie completely sucked. For it to win the academy award is beyond me. Kathereen zeta jones who has no talent whatsoever won best supporting actress? Oscar has become a joke. Save yourself the time and watch a football game instead.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|When I first bought this CD and popped it into my CD player, I was a little disappointed.  I did not think that it measured up to &quot;Mama's Gun&quot; (probably my favorite CD).  It seemed to lack that funky vibe that usually accompanies her work.  Don't get me wrong, &quot;Worldwide Underground&quot; is still one of the best albums this year.  E Badu still dropped some tight tracks with sick beats, but I couldn't get into it like I was able to with her previous albums.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is by far one of the most musically talented bands on the market today. They're incredible composition skills blend broad dynamic changes and unique melodies with incredible vocals. The CD manages to be soothing, and at the same time, exciting. It takes a few listens, and its NOTHING like Mer de Noms, but well worth the fifteen bucks!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I had very high expectations while waiting for the band's second album, Thirteenth Step, and after listening to it, it had exceeded my expectations greatly. Every song on the album was flawless; this band is definately one of the most talented ones i've come across. Each song blew me away, and by the end of the album i was speechless. anyone who liked Mer de Noms would bot be disappointed with this follow up.
0440237688|5.0|The book the Giver by Lois Lowry is a book that is set up in the future.  It is a Utopian Society where everybody is equal and everything is the same.  There the people dont have choices they dont even know what choices are.  There are no colors, music, and everything else is the same like the weather and the land.  <BR> There is a tradition in the community that when a child turns 12 there is a ceremony where they will get their job assignment.  There is a boy name Jonas and he receives the assignment of being the next Receiver.  He is going to receive all the memories from the old times.  Jonas and the Giver are the only ones in that society that know what change and choices are, but it is too much to handle for just two people.  So they have do make a decision on how theyll make the society with choices and freedom of decision.  By reading this wonderfully creative story youll find out what happens in the end.  Do the people get the memories back or not?  To find out youll have to read the Giver.
B000003S0I|5.0|On Larks' Tongues in Aspic, King Crimson (KC) juxtaposes sections of virtual silence with passages of bone-crushing volume that makes for an interesting study in contrasts.  This is most effectively demonstrated on Larks Tongues in Aspic (Pt. I), which is a piece of music that could very easily knock you out of your seat with the louder passages if you concentrate too hard on the quieter sections!  The rest of the cd features soft, mellotron-soaked songs (Book of Saturday and Exiles); a punchy and aggressive Easy Money; an exercise in percussion-based minimalism (The Talking Drum); and the quite nearly violent Larks' Tongues in Aspic (Pt. II).  The musicianship is of course, stellar and the arrangements are exceptionally good.  Bill Bruford details throughout why he is one of the top drummers in progressive rock and rock in general.  On the heavier pieces, John Wetton thrashes his Fender bass with the treble all of the way up and slightly distorted, making for a very percussive playing style that meshes perfectly with Bruford's playing.  During the lighter moments, he contributes some very clean and understated counterpoint and his vocals are also really good too!  In addition to the dizzying speed with which he cross-picks, Robert Fripp unleashes a range of sounds on the guitar, sometimes anguished, occasionally mellifluous, but always to the point.  In amongst all of this chaos, the delicate and wavering violin of David Cross adds a very nice acoustic element to the music, some of which can be overbearing at times.  This is excellent stuff!!  Also recommended from this period of KC is Red (1974).
B000089RVR|5.0|this CD is fantastic<BR>DIDO did it again with this unbelievable album<BR>all of the tracks have a single potential especially &quot;stoned&quot;<BR>highly recommended,really worth it<BR>buy it.
B000069AUI|5.0|A beautiful album from a talented band that has only begun to amaze us with their gifts.  No song on the album is to be missed, but 2 in particular (besides the singles already released) grabbed my attention:  the title song-simple, clear, fantastic.  But track 8 'Warning Sign' blew me away.  Soulful, rich, powerful and expansive in its ability to catch that particular heart-clenching feeling that comes from missing what you no longer have.  It makes you want to cry, knock back a shot, and pick up the phone and call an old lover.  Everyone should have this album, period.
0790733226|5.0|Form the majestic opening of silence to the meditative ending, this is a powerful portrait of human desire for knowledge. The intelligence of this film - especially compared to the garbage shown daily - is just stunning  Jodie Foster has said about the heroine that it was the closest any character had gotten in representing her spirit. That is an outstanding compliment considering the main character is based on a real-life scientist and the movie shows her as skeptic, searcher and explorer. <br />The movie and the book have been compared both favorably and unfavorably but that should not be the case.  Both are excellent representations of their particular genre. The best one can say about their relationship is that the movie effectively captured the spirit of the book - if not exactly following the storyline.<br />CONTACT has been called science-fiction for &quot;thinkers&quot; and it is void of much of what is seen in current films of this type - no action-packed space shootouts, no morphing monsters, no aliens using ESP or advanced technology.  No, it is instead a quiet demonstration, as the main character states, that we as a race are so small and so insignificant and so precious when viewed in the background of the Universe. It is continually surprising, the plot consistently logical, the characters always &quot;in character&quot;.  It is one of the best portrayals of scientists and their work with all the bickering, fighting, jealousy and in the end, awe upon discovering Nature's secrets.<br />Philosophically, it asks many questions.  The book deals more forcefully with the role of superstition and religion as it relates to scientific ventures.  Indeed, both the book and movie go to great lengths to explain that science does not demand blind obedience and is constantly challenged and tested in its assumptions and theorems.  Whether or not one believes that other alien civilizations exist, this film makes one wish that it were true.  <br />Added kudos to the cinemtography and music.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|Johnny Cash has a pretty dark CD here, Which is why I like it. Johnny's vocals are just a shell of what it use to be. It's still a joy to listen to. Most of his songs are pretty dark, even the more up tempo songs are about people dieing. And this music is coming from someone near death when he made the CD so you can kinda see the Johnny was seeing his ultimate end near. I suggest this CD for anyone.
B0000C8AVM|5.0|I discovered Bob Dylan a few years back and grew a heavy liking to his 1960s material (especially the electric albums). I was delighted to hear about his back catalogue being remastered and quickly bought 'Highway 61 Revisited' and 'Blonde On Blonde', then about a week later decided to change things up and buy 'Blood On The Tracks'. I knew 'Tangled Up In Blue' and 'Shelter From The Storm' from the retrospective discs I had, but then discovered other gems on the album (my new favorite might just be 'Buckets Of Rain' for just its sheer depressive emotional quality). Musically this is a simple album, somewhere in-between 'John Wesley Harding' and 'Highway 61 Revisited', mostly jangly acoustic guitars with organ backing. Lyrically, this is a very personal outing, mostly based on his recent, at the time, divorce. There's nothing much to say that hasn't been said before, this is just as good as any other Dylan release from his mid-1960s prime. 'Idiot Wind' wouldn't sound out of place on 'Highway 61 Revisited' and 'Rosemary And The Jack Of Hearts' is a folk ballad epic (almost 9 minutes) much like something from 'John Wesley Harding'.<br />Sonically, the cd's audio quality is just as good, if not a little clearer than the other releases I've gotten, and is a definite improvement over the 'Essential Bob Dylan' disc I bought a few years back. The vocals aren't quite as separated and centered as on 'Highway 61', but the clarity of Dylan's acoustic guitar is crystal and his harmonica fills are balanced perfectly, and not overpoweringly, into the mix. After this, I definitely want to give 'John Wesley Harding' a try despite the bad reviews on the site. This is a five-star release all the way.
B000089RVR|4.0|i actually got my hands on this album before the release, and haven't put it down one single day. I have never been a strong Dido fan but this album has made me one.<br />dido is a very creative singer. her lyrics are awesome.. my favs include &quot;do you have a little time&quot; which is so catchy, well written and sung, along with &quot;sand in my shoes&quot; and of course the title track &quot;life for rent&quot; that is filled with more CREATIVE cliches. least favs are &quot;see you when you're 40&quot; and Mary's in india&quot; don't like em.. hence, why the 4 stars.. <br />but regardless.. this IS an album you'll want to buy a legit copy of. bravo
0060977493|1.0|Fortunately, unlike her non-fictional rantings, fiction is one medium in which her ravings do not need to possess any internal coherence; after all, if I could convince readers merely through my power of prose, to read 350 pages about why I choose to wear red shoes to work everyday, I must have done a great job writing the damn thing. <br />I presume this must be the case for this book having pleased so many readers into the enthusiastic recommendation as one finds here. In my case, however, the experience of reading this book was frightfully irritating. Compared to some current and earlier Indian writers (for e.g., Mistry or Narayan), Ms Roy has little - if any - story telling skills, she does a very shoddy job stylistically (in particular, I find little merit in trying to compare her effort to the work of Rushdie or - again - Narayan), and this is beside the fact that there is little of quality originality here (you will find her stylististic antecedants, not equals, in Joyce, Hemingway, and other major modern English writers).<br />While most Indian writers in the English, seem to exhaust what they have to say (their life so far), in a single book which sometimes turns out to be fairly readable (for e.g., Chatterjee or Vakil), I am afraid Ms. Roy has not been able to go even that distance.
B00005JKL8|4.0|I was concerned that this movie would either be influenced by the continued backlash from Viet Nam or would be so incredibly over-the-top as to be completely unbelievable.  I was pleased that the movie combined a bit of political intrigue with generally realistic military action to yield a very enjoyable movie.  There are a few moments where the movie is unbelievable, but those moments are few enough to get you to the end.<br />Lt. Chris Burnett (Owen Wilson) and his friend and partner Stackhouse (Gabriel Macht) are flying a routine mission over Bosnia.  They fly into territory into which they are not permitted.  During their flight they see something on the ground that causes them to take a closer look.  Using their new digital image recording system they take high-speed pictures of an area that incriminates Serbians in aggression towards Bosnians.  The Serbians shoot down the F-18 with SAMs, later blaming the incident on rebel Bosnians.<br />Once the plane is shot down the two vulnerable pilots are quickly found by Serbian forces.  Stackhouse is quickly executed, causing Burnett to yell in anguish and anger, which of course was a serious mistake because Stackhouse's executioner hears Burnett, and the chase is on.<br />This movie is all about the chase.  Burnett runs for his life, trying to reach an extraction point.  The Serbian executioner that murdered Stackhouse chases Burnett almost to the end of the film.  During the chase there are several incidents that were very creative, though incredible in their coincidence.  One example happens when Burnett has a large group of Serbians on his heels.  The chase is being watched from Burnett's aircraft carrier, the Carl Vinson.  When Burnett trips and falls according to the infrared image, the anxious crew of the Carl Vinson are sure he is dead, yet the chasing Serbians miraculously do not find him.  You'll have to watch the movie to see why.<br />Burnett tries continually to make his way to the rendezvous point for extraction, and is continuously stymied.  Eventually the Serbians convince NATO that Burnett has been killed by the rebels, and the Carl Vinson prepares to head for home.  But, as we all know, Burnett is still trying to get out.  I'll not spoil the ending, which is the one portion of the movie that is really over-the-top, more reminiscent of James Bond than the military.<br />While the movie contains flaws in how the action is portrayed, for entertainment and patriotism it is a good bet, particularly if you enjoy military action movies.raction, and is continuously stymied.

B000031WD9|5.0|This movie was the first movie to REALLY start the image of the real teen (okay, perhaps a little exhaggerated, but...) Really, guys DO all think about sex. Here are the characters:<br />JIM is a slightly timid guy who's confidence and faith in his lady skills are LIMITED. He wants more than anything to score with Checz exchange student NADIA, but just when he gets closest, he screws it up. He just may find a solution in MICHELLE, a &quot;band geek&quot; who has more to her than people think... a LOT more.<br />KEVIN is an all-American virgin, who has been trying like mad to get his girlfriend, VICKY, into bed. Vicky, though, has an image in her head of the perfect moment, perfect setting, and the perfect three words from Kevin: &quot;I love you.&quot; But Kevin needs those three words to be perfect as well.<br />OZ is the jock of the group, who thinks he can coast through life without effort for anyone else. But he takes some advice and goes for a sensetive angle, working over the innocent, but definately not naive &quot;choir chick&quot; HEATHER. But the moment is in danger of being ruined by STIFLER, another jock, who is not exactly Mr. Sensetive. He's HOTTTT and knows it.<br />BTW, his mom is quite the &quot;MILF&quot; although she only actually appears once... and FINCH, a new-age ladies man, goes nuts for her... and WITH her.<br />Other characters include JESSICA, Vicky's &quot;experienced&quot; best friend who gives advice to EVERYONE, Chuck &quot;Sherminator&quot; Sherman, and Jim's Dad.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is how you write an excellent album. If anyone has ever suffered from any kind of addiction this album will leave you happy that you are still alive. I'll admit it took a few listens to get into this album but if you can get past the fact that this isn't a hard rock album and realize that the hard rock is in the message. This album has some of the most powerful lyrics and the music definitely compliments the mood. After listening to this album the only addiction you'll have is listening to this album non stop!
B000089RVX|5.0|Buy this CD immediately! There is nothing about Amy Lee that won't give you wood.
B00001QEE7|5.0|I absolutely Love the little mermaid! When I was a wee bit of a baby, my mom had to buy 2 videos because I'd watch them over and over. Actually I still do, I still have the 1989 video tapes, and are still in good condition!!!! It's so great, I think this is defenitely disney at it's best!<br />I can't wait for Disney's Platinum Edition for this movie. All the special features, I just keep counting the days. I just hope, they make it as spectacular as the Original Release!!! The generation of kids right now, may only know LILO AND STITCH, but they will know later of the Real Classics, like THE LITTLE MERMAID!
0440539811|4.0|This book was the strangest thing I have ever read.  Hands down.  And I've read some weird stuff.  That said, I slogged through the first 100 pages not understanding what was going on.  After another 100, I was having fun - I still didnt know what was going on, but I was warming to it.  By the end I was absolutely hooked.  I dont know why, its not really well written, its not really deep or philosophical.  Its a fun read, and will keep you wondering about stuff until you're sick of it.  But then you'll pick it back up and keep reading because you want to know what ridiculousness happens next.  Not for close minded folk.  That said, this book will always have a place of honor on my bookshelf.
0062502182|5.0|I happened to read &quot;The Alchemist&quot; 4 years ago. I finished the entire book in one sitting. Such was the message that made me so engrossed. In the last 4 years, I read this book 8 times and still reading whenever I need to pep myself up. The core message in this book &quot;When you want to achieve something, the whole world will help you&quot; can become a really if you are committed to your dreams. <br />I bought 6 copies of this book and gifted them to some of my friends who are committed to their dreams. Go ahead, grab this masterpiece and Read it. Who knows, this book can make the difference to you and help you keep fighting for what you believe in.
0312319517|5.0|Don't miss this one. It's an education about warfare, and specifically U.S.methods of operation and our intelligence services and why they don't work.  It is a compelling story at every level, and there are many.  With few words the author defines the characters by their defining moments in life.  I can't say enough about it.  Many years ago, I, along with thousands of others, became addicted to thrillers thanks to the author's Odessa File and Day of the Jackal.  He certainly hasn't lost his touch.
B00009RDG9|1.0|This is a nonsensical movie that is salvaged only through some great cinematography and decent action scenes.  I won't rehash the plot as you can read about it in the other posts, but will pose my questions.  First off, Benicio is a covert hero in Sarajevo who suddenly becomes a murderous lunatic in Seattle?  It clearly shows that he is troubled, yet doesn't explain why he would snap, especially when he is so sane and lucid during his interactions with Jones and the mother/daughter.  And is Jones a hero or antihero?  Nice how he shirks any pleas for help from his protege, but comes in to clean up the mess.  And who were the two hunters at the beginning?  Did they have some type of ulterior motive to being there?  Were those some type of special scopes on their rifles, and how many deer hunters hunt on foot versus a stand?  And would your average hunter actually try and engage an apparent lunatic in the woods or would they high tail it out of there?  There were more to these guys then ever explained, especially when the men in overcoats take Benny away from the FBI and try to give him a nasal labotomy.  Is there a conspiracy that has driven him to taking &quot;innocent&quot; lives?  Who knows because the idea is simply teased with and then dropped.  And once you hit the chase scenes, it becomes totally laughable.  Whenever Jones loses Benicio he seems to stop, smell the air, and turn around right at the split second that he can catch him rounding a corner, or going into a doorway, or crossing the street.  But just that split second.  Somehow while the FBI is bumbling around Benny manages to rig two pendulum like logs that barely miss smashing Jones who one minute before was right behind Del Toro.  Huh?  And let's not even mention the fact that towards the end the chase is suspended long enough for Benny to actually blacksmith a metal bar into his ultimate killing weapon while Jones is off chiseling a stone to create his counter weapon.  What a joke.  Everyone talks about how tough Jones character is, and he proves it by removing a foot long, two inch wide stake that has been driven into his thigh, without suffering the slightest ill effect from the injury.  Heck not only is his leg totally stable, he doesn't even limp.  And that's after removing himself from a class 5 raging river that he rode down with, once again, no ill effect.  So obviously as Del Toro slices Jones across the abdomen not once, but twice with bloody glee during the climatic final battle, Jones winks to the audience and says &quot;just a flesh wound&quot;.  Not really, but probably should have.  Actually now that I am done rating this movie, I am lowering it to 1 star.  Friedkin says this movie has &quot;no message&quot; but be prepared because it also has no plot, no connection to reality, and no redeeming value.
B000026CZJ|5.0|This is a truly wonderfully played CD, each month of the year is granted with such a character. Vladimir Ashkenazy was the man, he has put such a lively romatic touch to the music, especially to the months of January and June. Give the CD a try, you won't be disappointed.
B000062Y98|5.0|It has been said about the album that it is a flawed masterpiece.  If this is true then A Night At The Opera's (ANATO) flaw is that it's overproduced. It has lot of sounds together and it is technically heavy too,thus fans who like things as straight as possible may find it tiring. However the album features very good and inspired songs and the band's abilities are evident. There is heavy use of choirs and almost constant use of lead guitars in the album and at least technically speaking the guys seem to be on top form.<br />If your favorite Blind Guardian album is Somewhere far Beyond or an album before that most probably you won't enjoy the album. If your fave is Imaginations From The Other Side or Nightfall In Middle Earth you should give a listen to the album to see if it's meant for you. Personally speaking my fave is Nightfall even a year after ANATO's release. I consider ANATO an album worth owning for most Blind Guardian fans.<br />And Then There Was Silence may well be Blind Guardian's best song to date. It is a long song with multiple guitar layers and terrific vocals. Battlefield is a more epic view into BG's music and Under The Ice and Sadly Sings Destiny will become the most asked for songs of the album. Punishment Divine and The Soulforged are inspired and catchy songs too. The Maiden And The Minstrel Knight is a ballad that IMO isn't quite on par with past ballads,unlike Age Of False Innocence which is a top notch one. Wait For An Answer is uneven as has some terrific parts next to typical ones.Finally Mies Del Dolor, the bonus song is Harvest Of Sorrow, an old unreleased till the ATTWS single came out song, sang in Spanish by Hansi and I prefer it in it's British single version. The guitar melody however shows that Marcus should be allowed to compose more often.<br />I gave this album 5 stars because it is a great album on its own,even if I prefer Nightfall... to it. It easilly blows away stuff like Kamelot,Gamma Ray,Stratovarius,Edguy etc
B0000AMRJC|2.0|I'm not going to talk about the movie since I asume all who are reading this know how good this movie already is. This is going to be a review about the quality of the Anniversary Edition dvd. To start off the video quality as compared to the original dvd has been much improved but there are some scenes where the image looks very dusty and dark. The sound??? Well that's my bigget letdown about this dvd. They advertise 5.1 surround with DTS but I just don't hear it. Most of the shootouts and explosions come from the center channel. Where is the surround sound?? As for the extras, besides the Def Jam segment, they are the same as the original dvd. The only impressive change to this disk are the animated menues. I LOVE SCARFACE but I expected so much more from this dvd. I would hope for future posts about dvd reviews focus on the quality of the disks and extras that are contained in them.
B0000C7PQK|4.0|I wasn't really planning on buying the new Enigma cd right away. I was hoping to buy the new Dido cd today but Target was out of her cds. When I came across &quot;Voyageur&quot; on my break during work today, I just flipped over the unique packaging and immediately bought the cd. It is good to hear new album from one of my favorite ambient/new age groups. I must confess that I was slightly disappointed in &quot;Voyageur&quot; in the sense that the music lacked the haunting, symphonic sounds of the group's previous albums. I was also a bit turned off by the silly lyrics of &quot;Boum-Boum&quot;. I still don't care for the lyrics of the song but Ruth-Ann's vocals makes listening to the song more pleasant. Former Olive vocalist Ruth-Ann sings lead vocals throughout the cd. She definitely has a beautiful, if not enchanting voice. I have been a fan of her's since her days in Olive. Now that I have listened to &quot;Voyageur&quot; for a second time, the songs are starting to grow on me. The standout tracks for me on this entire cd has to be &quot;Following the Sun&quot; and &quot;Total Eclipse of the Moon&quot;. The haunting melodies reminds me of why I love Enigma so much. Although I am not quite as taken with this cd as I have with their previous efforts, I am still glad to have bought &quot;Voyageur&quot;. It is always good to hear new music from this enchanting group.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|X2, free of the burden X-MEN had of having to introduce all of its giant cast of characters, is a better movie than its predecessor. It takes all of its characters, throws them into a life-or-death plotline that makes sense within the guidelines of the X-Men universe, keeps the action on high throughout and even provides its actors a chance to showcase their individuality.<br />Watching it, it feels like a comic book. Someone's out to take over the world, and chaos seems to put our heroes in some new danger every few minutes. As Wolverine and Magneto, Hugh Jackman and Ian McKellan once again get some choice lines, and the discrimination-against-mutants parable gets addressed nicely, complete with a mutant \\"coming out\\" scene.<br />The final battle is thrilling. The villain is fascinating. Of the major new characters, only Deathstrike doesn't make much of an impression. Pyro is interesting and well-developed, and Nightcrawler's multifaceted and compelling.<br />And the ending is one of the most daring, promising and cool popcorn-movie endings ever committed to film. You half expect the film to flash \\"To be continued ...\\" across the screen.<br />X2 is great stuff.

B00005JLYW|4.0|This movie was silly, dumb, an unnecessary sequel to a fluffy, ridiculous film. CHARLIE'S ANGELS: FULL THROTTLE gives its viewers an excuse to ogle Cameron Diaz, Drew Barrymore, Lucy Liu and Demi Moore in revealing, tight costumes while barely supplying its viewers with a plot and forcing us to watch a film so freakishly edited together that it feels like a two-hour music video. The stunts are so fake that you start thinking, \\"Hey, the green-screen appears so often it should get a screen credit and percentage of the gross.\\" It's a ludicrous film.<br />That said, damn if the thing isn't occasionally lots and lots of fun.<br />Like its predecessor, FULL THROTTLE gives us hot chicks, hot guys, loads of fun action and ridiculously contrived situations. The jokes, though they fly as often as they did in the first movie, aren't as funny, but you still get to see Cameron Diaz dress as a really, really butch lesbian AND dance to MC Hammer, so who cares?<br />The DVD is unrated. I don't know exactly how exploitative this new version of the film is going to get, other than through adding more dumb sex jokes. But if there are more scenes added where the sweaty, buff and bad-accented Justin Theroux or any of the Angels go shirtless, then I hate to admit it ... but I'm so there.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|ok. first things first...this is a great album. seems short at only 47 minutes, but it is very good. and as an album it flows very well. you can listen to it from start to finish. as a huge Enigma fan, i dont mind that michael cretu hasn't strayed far from his formula. i think that his albums have become less and less commercial. unfortunatly, i dont see any american hits in here. but thats not entirely because of the mucic here. it has a lot to do with america's pathetic taste in music. to my ears and i'm sure others, i don't see why &quot;boum boum&quot; and &quot;following the sun&quot; cant be huge hits. these songs are brilliant. but my fave is &quot;the look of today&quot; it is a catchy and original song for enigma. however, does anyone else hear the similarity to ABC's &quot;the look of love&quot;? if i can only make one suggestion to Michael Cretu, it would be to include his wife Sandra as featured vocalist instead of Ruth-ann. I have followed Sandra and Michael Cretu's careers since the mid 80's and I think that Sandra will always be the voice of Enigma to me, as she was for the first couple albums.and as an established solo artist in europe-Sandra deserves recognition in america.So buy this cd and definetly listen to it twice from begining to end. you'll love it. as long as your not expecting the gregorian chants, you will not be dissapointed
B0000CABJ1|5.0|One may hesitate picking up this particular compilation, as there have been many, many Donna Summer compilations released in the past decade. \\"Why would I pick up this one,\\" you may ask. \\"What's so special about this one?\\" Well, here are a couple reasons why you should.<br />The Journey is, overall, a wonderfully concise overview of Donna's body of work. Not as exhaustive as her 1993 Anthology, and not as skimpy as the 1998 Greatest Hits or 2003 20th Century Masters CDs. In a nutshell, it's basically a revamping of 1994's Endless Summer, now covering her earliest US hit, 1975's Love To Love You Baby, and her last, 1999's I Will Go With You. The songs, the majority of which are in their radio edit versions, are remastered beautifully, and have never sounded better.<br />One of the catches to this CD, are the two new tracks which reunites Donna with her long-time collaborator, Giorgio Moroder. The two last worked on 1992's Carry On, and before that, 1981's I'm A Rainbow album. Both of the new tracks, in my opinion, are in a word -- stunning. <br />I Will Live For Love is just so wonderfully over the top, terribly Hi-NRG, but just so much fun to listen to! Follows the classic Donna style -- a slow ballad intro, which then transforms into a pumping dance track, in the vein of Last Dance, Dim All The Lights and Melody Of Love.<br />That's The Way is one of Donna's best songs in quite some time. It's such an intriguing number, quite an unusual entry in the Donna Summer canon. Everything about the song works: the mid-tempo, plodding beat, the reggae-styled guitar and percussion, and of course, Donna's vocals -- very, very sexy vocals. Not to mention the rather playful spoken passage in the middle... wherein Donna does a little bit of self-promotion. \\"I wanna love you baby, like you know I'm Donna Summer\\". Indeed!<br />This first pressing of The Journey also comes with a bonus CD featuring five 12\\" mixes, including Hot Stuff, I Feel Love and This Time I Know It's For Real.All of which are basic extended versions. The real treat are the remaining two tracks on the disc.<br />I Will Live For Love appears a second time, in remixed form, a 9-minute remix done by Giorgio Moroder and Chris Cox. Speaking personally, I prefer this slightly more subdued remix than the perhaps a bit too over-busy original version.<br />Also making its public debut is the Ultimate Club Mix of You're So Beautiful. A song that made the rounds on bootlegs earlier in the year, it finally gets the public release it deserved. Rather similar to the original bootleg mix, cleaned up, slightly adulterated with more synths and effects, and lengthened by almost 2 minutes. Personally, I have issues with Donna's vocals being so buried in the mix, and I still find it much too hard a mix for my liking. Personally, I would love to hear a more poppier-sounding mix of Beautiful -- something in the vein of the Tommy Musto vocal mix of The Power Of One, for instance. <br />Overall, Donna's \\"The Journey\\" is a tremendous value, combining her classic tunes with some new ones with her old collaborator, Giorgio Moroder, bringing her full-circle. The addition of the bonus remix CD is yet another reason to pick this compilation up without delay.
B000089RVR|5.0|This latest album from dido is what we surely wanted after No Angle.

630021463X|1.0|I was amazed to read the glowing reviews of this stinker. The plot is utterly absurd. The movie was obviously planned backwards, probably as follows: <br />&quot;Hey, let's do a Star Trek movie that makes a sociological statement!&quot;<BR>&quot;Yeah, great idea! Maybe one that supports the environment...&quot;<BR>&quot;How about saving the whales?&quot;<BR>&quot;That's ridiculous! What do whales have to do with the 23rd century? Besides, they'll probably be extinct by then.&quot;<BR>&quot;Hmmm. Maybe a disaster might happen that only the whales could solve, and they'll be extinct.&quot;<BR>&quot;Whales are unintelligent, what problems could THEY solve?&quot;<BR>&quot;Yeah. Hmmm. Maybe the disaster could be averted by using whale blubber or something.&quot;<BR>&quot;No, dufus, now you're beginning to sound like a capitalist pig who wants to slaughter whales for their blubber.&quot;<BR>&lt;They break for a latte and a scone.&gt;<BR>&quot;Maybe some powerful environmentally enlightened aliens descended from the ancestors of whales show up and want to make sure their 'brothers' on Earth are being treated well.&quot;<BR>&quot;Yeah, then they find out the whales are extinct and then in a fit of rage blast the Earth into smithereens!!!&quot;<BR>&quot;No way. Then the movie would be over in what, 20 minutes? And then any sequel would have to have the Federation fighting a bunch of alien whale-oids. Ugh.&quot;<BR>&quot;OK, how about this. The spacecraft could be unoccupied. Like a probe...&quot;<br />You see my point.<br />The movie does have its funny moments, but they are spoiled by the borderline-psychotic and thoroughly annoying character played by Catherine Hicks. The low point of the movie for me happens when, after she is told by a co-worker that a whale has been moved, she snaps and viciously slaps him across the face.<BR>Ugh.<br />IMHO, here are the six Star Trek's in order of merit:<br />VI <BR>II<BR>III<BR>V<BR>IV<BR>I
B00008WG3U|5.0|All the new songs on this new album are rockin' except Whoops I Od'd wich really suck, but this record is really great, so one thing I got to say is Go buy it now!
B0000AMRJC|3.0|Let me begin by saying that the movie itself deserves 5 stars. Having said that I admit to being very dissapointed with this release. I bought this version mainly because of the remastered video and sound. The video is excellent, crisp, clear and dynamic..a definite improvement over the original dvd. The sound on the other hand..ugh! The mix done on this is just terrible, I am not exxagerating. They say it's in DTS 5.1 and they're lying...most of the time everything comes from the center channel and muffled at that...what little surround effects there are ( they are few and far between )also sound muffled. I put in my original release copy and in Dolby 2.0 it sounded 10 times better than this new version.<BR>               In closing...if you don't care about sound quality and just want an excellent movie pick it up...but if you care at all about the sound..AVOID.
B000066NW0|5.0|Seriously, FORGET what negative things other people have said about Avril. You people who are criticizing her, you probably don't even know A THING about her. You need to get your facts straight before going ahead and bashing people. Some of these things are so untrue, it's hilarious. I'm not even going to say anything about that, because the people who really know Avril know the truth, and the people who just started bashing her, don't.<BR>But anyway, the album is fabulous. I reccommend everybody order their own copy right now! Avril's lyrics are so real, and they're really quite easy to relate to.<BR>My favorites(in no particular order):<BR>\\"Mobile\\"<BR>\\"Tomorrow\\"<BR>\\"Anything But Ordinary\\"<BR>\\"Things I'll Never Say\\"<BR>\\"Nobody's Fool\\"<BR>\\"Naked\\"<BR>This really is a great album, people! You should totally just forget all that bad and mean stuff people said about Avril and the album! I think everybody should have at least 1 copy of this album. It's that great!
B000089RVX|5.0|opens with the brilliant going under and bring me to life. a mix of goth an rock an some powerful ballards, no fillers on this cd, excellent from start to finish.
0783229526|5.0|this film has been scorned undeservingly for too long. what is it with people and their unbridled hate towards the master that is Terry Gilliam. In no other hands would i have left a visual interpretation of the great Hunter S. Thompsons great novel. When I close my eyes after absorbing a sentence of this literary masterpiece and clearly see a vision that is not far removed from Terry's own. this film hit the mark just as much as any other of Terry's visual feasts. Only the uncultured could possibly misplace their scorn upon Gilliam.
B000002HNR|5.0|The Doors could play blues better than ANYONE.  Don't believe me?  Just listen long and hard to \\"Close To You\\", by far the most excellent song on this album.  To be quite honest, it makes the Muddy Waters version sound pitiful (with all due respect).  Just listen to Ray's thunderous, masculine vocals and tell me that this isn't blues at it's absolute best.  And Jim sings background vocals on this one, too.  That part where they keep wailing \\"CLOSER AND CLOSER BABY!\\" is just too awesome for me to describe in words, as is the driving beat of the song.  And listen to the way that John keeps thrashing his cymbals.  Man oh man, you'll never find a blues tune better than this one, so don't even try.  IT'S JUST TOO FRIGGIN' AWESOME!!!<BR>Okay. the rest of the album is wonderful too.  In particular, the version of \\"Five To One\\" is practically surreal in it's intensity.  And Robby throws in the most devastating solo that I've ever heard him play.  \\"Who Do You Love\\" is also great, much better than the dorky George Thorogood version.  \\"Back Door Man\\" features another blistering solo by Robby, and \\"Soul Kitchen\\" may even be better than the original version.  <BR>But none of those songs can compare to the raw, fiery, unmatched blues that is \\"Close To You\\".  That song alone is worth the price of the whole album.
B0000C8AVE|5.0|Oh, come on now.  I suspect Cranky Reviewer to have a very twisted sense of humor.  No one could write a review like that and mean it SERIOUSLY.  Look at it as a satirical piece, and it's totally HILARIOUS!  <br />&quot;Whiny voice&quot; indeed (correct, of course, but no one ever really cared if Dylan couldn't sing, he could certainly SELL a song!  No one really needs to review this album, it's obviously a CLASSIC.   I started listening to Dylan while I was in college, and once I got past the voice I became a BIG FAN. I'm just flabbergasted that everyone took Cranky Reviewer's piece as a REVIEW.
B0000AI45P|5.0|This album has never sounded better. The jazz influenced endlessly snaking guitar work of Tom Verlaine sounds like its shimmering out of the speakers specifically on Venus and the title track. God bless those fine folks at Rhino (And I thought it was exciting when the X and Ramones reissues came out). Buy this in the name of all that is holy and help yourself to remember a time when punk rock meant more than getting a pierced lip, a blink 182 tatoo, and telling your parents that you were running away. And then my child pray to the gods of the digital remaster that the Richard Hell and Stooges catalogs are soon to follow.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|well for one thing i love how the finaly introduce the other students at the acadomy and thw work they did on nightcrawler but one thing i think they could of done to make it better was add in gambit for more of a spice in that rouge and ice-man's relachionship but other then that this is a must owne dvd untill they bring out X-men 3 (whitch Gambit, Havic, Boom Boom, and the rest of the brother hood will be introduce in to the story line)
B00006L83N|4.0|Symphony X has done it again!  Those familiar with the band will recognize the heavy riffs and backup flute jams.  I gave this album only 4 starts because I felt the band did not build upon the album &quot;Live on the Edge of Forever&quot; which was just as heavy and just as hard.
B0000C7PQK|4.0|During the first few listens, it was difficult for me to suppress the question, &quot;This is what I waited three years for?&quot;  And indeed, Michael Cretu, the self-proclaimed perfectionist-genius, certainly took his time nursing this project along for the past few years.<br />However, it misses where some of his previous CD's scored big, particularly in the category of phonic revelation.  For those well-versed in Enigma music, I won't need to explain where this CD excels (it's part of the Enigma formula).  But here's why it's only worth my four stars.<br />&quot;Voyageur&quot; doesn't make any real acheivements towards Cretu's famed electronic porgression, but rather appears to enjoy some degree of complacency in the sound of 2000's &quot;The Screen Behind the Mirror.&quot;  Because of Enigma's previous milestones, &quot;Voyageur&quot; comes off as remarkably intelligent, yet unexpectedly anticlimactic.  After reading some of Cretu's pre-release interviews, I was convinced this latest CD would be spilling over with foreign sounds and an intriguing, new direction.  Not so.<br />The sound is strongly reminiscent of &quot;The Screen...&quot; with sparse, obscure hints of 1996's devastatingly genius &quot;Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi.&quot;  This is not to say that I was expecting a duplication of Cretu's past accomplishments.  To be sure, there will never be another &quot;The Child In Us.&quot;  But I was hoping for more embellishment and expansion of that same vein which was expertly tapped on Enigma's previous two albums.  Perhaps the only clear standout on &quot;Voyageur&quot; is the radio-ready &quot;Following The Sun&quot; with its creative marriage of Sandra's and Michael's vocals.<br />And speaking of vocals.  By the end of this brief CD (an insatiable 47 minutes long), Michael's digitally-encoded vox had seemed to dominate many of the tracks, and the rare exclusivity they enjoyed on earlier records was waning.  The instrumentation is another component that, to me, wasn't explored in typical Enigma fashion.  For example, the programmed beats were disappointingly contemporary.  Though this aspect was modified from prior recordings, it provided a surprisingly commercialized sound that I wasn't prepared for (and am still trying to accept while listening to the new CD).<br />This CD, for its few predictabilities, is still leaps and bounds ahead of at least 80 percent of the other leading brands of electronica out there today.  Michael Cretu remains a musical player (if not an icon) to be reckoned with, and to a large extent he will always possess a certain midas touch when it comes to synthetic recordings.<br />Bottom line: This is still a landmark in musical evolution, and &quot;Voyageur,&quot; though not entirely different from other Enigma CD's, should still be required listening for those interested in electronic composition.to me, wasn't explored in typical Enigma fashion.

B0000B3FCX|4.0|I bought the CD the very day of it's release and was not disappointed. Though unsure quite how to take the album at first, I thought the songs, as always, were enjoyable to listen to. In Silver Side Up, more of the songs were generalized enough so that the listener could incorate their own life experiences while listening. Meanwhile, some of the other songs (i.e. &quot;Never Again&quot;) centered around someone elses experiences. It is evident that NickleBack has matured enough to create songs with a story to them. I particularily enjoy track #2(the title currently escapes me at the moment), as Chad  seemingly describes a  very one-sided relationship. <BR>  Though I enjoy the album, I don't care for any of the bonus tracks at the end of the album. Aside from that, I believe other NickleBack fans won't be royally disappointed.
B00005NGZX|5.0|i love converges amazing distortion effects, their drummers insanly unhuman playing, their bassists kicks ass, and their signer has an unbelievable scream and beautiful voice, also another plus is their perfectly poetic story that incorporates Jane Doe, thats all i have to say :)
B0000C7PSW|5.0|I discovered Rufus upon the release of his self titled debut album, and ever since then, it's been love at first listen with each cd he releases.  With \\"Want One\\", he proves that he is at the top of his form; this album is in turns uplifting, beautiful, sad, meditative, alive with the pure joy of making music for music's sake.  I can't really pinpoint a favorite song in particular to choose from, as they are all tremendous in their own right-however, stand outs are \\"Oh What A World\\", \\"I Don't Know What It Is\\", \\"Beautiful Child\\", \\"Vibrate\\", \\"14th Street\\", and \\"Pretty Things\\" actually makes me want to cry (not that that's a bad thing).  Rufus proves that he is more than multi-talented on many levels, with lush orchestrations, vocals, and lyrics that make you think and touch your heart...he truly pours himself completely into his craft, and the results are never short of gorgeous. \\"Want One\\" shall also grace my top picks in music for 2003, although I am not surprised that it should do so; I would expect nothing but the best by a true maestro of the genre.  With his flair for the theatrical, dramatic, and melancholy, Rufus Wainwright stands alone...and for those of you who are about to discover his musical genius, that really IS a wonderful thing.
B00008PW2D|1.0|This was the worst season of all. Even with Sarah Jessica's pregnancy, the stories were bad and seeing only 8 episodes for this price? I'll skip right to Season 6 when that comes out, since you don't have to watch Season 5 at all to continue with Season 6.
B00005Q45W|5.0|I loved the songs on this cd the minute I heard it.  Is it possible to fall in love with a cd?
B00009MGQL|4.0|The same gut-grabbing guitarist that first caught my attention so long ago returns in his latest foray into melody, trance and technology. <BR>At fifty years old and I still love this man's playing as much as I did at fifteen with \\"Truth\\", at eighteen with \\"Rough and Ready\\" and at twenty-two with \\"Blow by Blow\\". <BR>In the 1970's I was fortunate to catch Jeff and John Mclaughlin on tour together. They, along with Robert Fripp are my three favorite guitarists of the past thirty or so years. <BR>I consider myself, and the music world, lucky indeed that Jeff Beck is as alive and vibrant as ever.<BR>I love this new CD. Techobeat, sampling, studio wizardry and all. Jeff Beck is as hard, delicate and melodic as he's even been. More so, I think.<BR>(Apparently, he's also been tearing it up on tour with drummer Terry Bozzio...)
B0000AXE8I|5.0|This is the second movie of one of the best epic trilogies of all time.  Sure this movie isn't as magical or amazing to most of you and thats because its the second movie and the graphics that amazed you from the first has been done.  The graphics have been improved some and the third i believe will blow you away.  the real problem  though is that most of you only liked the first because of the graphics and you never pay attention to the plot or you don't understand it.  You put down the middle movie of the trilogy because the plot is to complex for you and tells to much.  Its this way because the second movie is the main plot movie and it sets the third film up like all epic trilogies.  Such as Star Wars(No I'm not a computer nerd the matrix trilogy is just my favorite movie)! Now go and rewatch the first and pay attention learn the plot and philosophy of it and it will stun you then watch the second as it sets you up for the final movie.  Also think about a few things for the upcoming one such as:  what if Neo goes bad? they are in another Matrix?, Neo can control all the machines, or Neo is the ultimate agent made to kill the surviving Zion citizens?
B00007M5CO|5.0|The fusion of Tango Music and Techno does create a nice Chill Out Vibe.  I purchased this CD down in Buenos Aires at the end of August 2003 and this album was still in the Top 30 Sales Chart.  Not bad for a CD almost a year old.  But don't take my word on how great this CD is (strongest tracks are #3 and #12), this CD was just recently the recipient of the 2003 Latin Grammy Awards for Best Pop Instrumental.  I am a little surprised that Amazon does not flag award-winning albums in their search but should do so in the future!  Give this album a try--you won't be disappointed!
B0000029DD|5.0|This music is poetry bathed in a heavenly plain.  I feel like I'm listening to Morrissey or Hope Sandoval (of Mazzy Star) in that I'm hearing a desperate cry of a true musician who is often imitated but never duplicated. The desperation and heart of this music is what makes it sheer brilliance.
B0000AUHPB|5.0|\\"Self-preservation-society\\" Ahhh,, the delightful tune stays in your head as you remember the times when a Mini Cooper was a Mini Cooper (British and all) and England's footballers were on top of the World. I remember this movie as a child, and as I got older, my love affair with it blossomed as did my love affair with the Mini. Michael Caine at his ultimate \\"Cockney\\" best and a cast assembled to perfection. Benny Hill as the technical genious behind the gold plot, with his love for \\"BIG\\" women, was a classic role for this much missed comic master. A fantastic plot, stunning scenery, the best car chase sequence EVER in a movie, and an ending that defies logic, make this movie a classic amongst classics. The new remake may have the big star cast, the multi-million dollar production team and the new (dare I say it?) German Mini Coopers, but the original will never be matched for it's wonderful piece of 60's nostalgia. The Mini Cooper, sharp suits, mini skirts, Vespa's, England World Football Champions ...sigh... where did it all go? Bring it all back with this MUST HAVE crime caper Classic. Finally on DVD in America ...Thank You!! Thank You!! Thank You!!
B00003CXD5|5.0|I received it yesterday, and it's a nice set.  There's nothing to complain about in terms of picture quality and sound, and the second disc contains a rather ordinary and predictable feature about making the movie, with the usual interesting asides and tidbits.  The same comments also appear in the audio commentary, which is pretty good.  The only objection about the side feature is that Leonard Maltin pops up frequently in it, and his opinions he can keep to himself, as far as I'm concerned.  There's a Bugs Bunny cartoon that apparently was intended to accompany the picture, but it's not very good.  It's too bad they didn't include more outakes, but maybe they didn't survive.<br />Anyway, all the extra stuff in any of these sets is something you watch once and forget, so it's not all that important.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|Rufus Wainwright's &quot;Walk One&quot; follows on the heels of the exquisite &quot;Poses&quot; and is another excellent milestone for this young artist.  Slammed by some professional reviewers for a looser, more experimental feel, Rufus produces a sound complex with various levels in lush arrangements filled with classical and pop influences.  My favorite track is &quot;Go Or Go Ahead&quot; with its wall of glorious background vocals and quirky lyrics that question love, &quot;So I will opt for the big white limo, vanity fairgrounds and rebel angels.&quot;  On the web site commentary Rufus confesses that the song was written while under the influence of a bad drug experience, advises the audience not to try it and cites Debussy for the closing vocals.  Levon Helm from The Band contributes drums with Jenni Muldaur and sister Martha on background vocals on the Tin Pan Alley influenced &quot;14th Street,&quot; &quot;Why'd you have to break all my heart; couldn't you have saved a minor part?&quot;  The opener &quot;Oh What A World&quot; is addictive while on the title track Rufus confesses, &quot;I don't want to be John Lennon or Leonard Cohen; I just want to be my Dad with a slight sprinkling of my mother.&quot;  Rufus' work is made distinctive because of a voice like velvet, the complexity of his lyrics and melodies, and his use of the studio as another instrument.  Not since the Beatles used the studio almost as another band member has anyone so effectively made use of the technology to transform his vision into sound.  &quot;Walk One&quot; is entrancing.  Enjoy!
0684857219|4.0|This book is an excellent reference manuel. The lifts are described in detail and illustrated. The book shows a variety of lifts for the same muscle group so that a person will have a variety of options. THis book is for bodybuilding though, it is not a reference book football programs, powerlifting programs or anything of the sort. This book is simply a great research tool to help vary your lifting program and outlines a variety of programs.
0671027573|5.0|I think by just saying that I am reading this book for the 3rd time is plenty. Even though I know the ending, it still makes me smile and laugh out loud. I have bought this book for other people as gifts and have recommended it to others. I have read many Lind Howard books but so far this is my true favorite. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B000089RVR|4.0|I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this artist's sophomore release. For most musicians, it's tough to follow up a first effort with something more impressive (unless the first relase blew chunks). This album is just wonderful to listen to. Dido's voice is gentle, haunting, and sweet all at once. &quot;Don't Leave Home&quot; evokes a sense of powerful comfort, while &quot;White Flag&quot; exudes a confidence in the midst of what appears to be a tormented relationship. Though the lyrics are not necessarily multi-layered in meaning, their simplicity communicates much more than just the typical commercially manufactured trite words of many of today's artists. The entire album is a pleasure to listen to.
B00009ATIX|4.0|Luckily not having seen the original Solaris, I could watch this film with an open mind. And two things came immediately to mind: 1) this is NOT as bad as the one-star-review folks have implied and 2) this is a philosophical, contemplative slice of sci-fi/drama - high on substance. I liked it (and I`m quite picky when it comes to sci-fi). The plot - which, has anyone noticed, bears a striking resemblance to the movie Sphere - is basically about relationships reconstructed with the benefit of hindsight.  The pacing is admittedly slow, but it wouldn't really have worked otherwise. You still get sucked in, believe me. George Clooney pulls off the non-hunk role admirably, although personally I would have cast someone a little less well-known. In any event Clooney is upstaged by Natasha McElhone, who is beautiful, strange and frightening and...just amazing. This is a great, lavish work of cinematography. The camera lingers lovingly on the flickering lamps and sterile, minimalistic environments of the spaceship interior (Stanley Kubrick`s influence is unmistakable). To sum up, this is a great sci-fi movie that is more about love than slimy, malevolent beings (your girlfriend will enjoy it as much as you will), and there are plenty of moral and ethical insights that crop along the way, making this hugely enjoyable viewing for amateur philosophers, sci-fi buffs and coffee-table intellectuals alike. I only hope the original matches up to it.
B000002HEP|5.0|Those are the instructions given in the liner notes of this album. I suggest you follow them.<BR>Kyuss were one of those bands that helped invent a genre but their sound is so unique that it ultimately has nothing to do with anyone else. Much like Sabbath invented heavy metal, but were not heavy metal, Kyuss invented stoner rock and were definately not stoner rock. <BR>Not to say you can't get stoned to this record. I have, almost on a daily basis. Welcome to Sky Valley is an altered state in itself. The bass heavy grooves pummel your body while the melody and soloing will lift your mind to places its never been. There was something mystical about this short lived and criminally underrated band and its awesome that kids are now starting to realize it. This album is more of an experience than a collection of songs. Its the musical equivalent of staring straight into the sun and never, ever blinking. <BR>If you decide to buy this record, I recommend listening to it properly. Find some place very hot, and very dusty and smoke till you begin to see patterns in the sand. And then, and only then, put this on at a dangerous volume. Lay back, relax, prepare for the trip.
B000009ED0|5.0|This album is probably the best album I own (out of about 50 CDs).  I feel so for several reasons. One is the lyrics.  He has really great rhymes and rhythm.  He mixes so many different types od music together in an excellent blend.  These include country, hip hop, heavy metal, southern rock, and just kick ass hard rock.  Some people don't like Kid Rock but I think he kicks ass.  This album is DEFINETLY well worth your $13.99 and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone.
0385504209|5.0|I have read most of the reviews on this book, and I am glad I did so AFTER reading the book myself.  I found this book EXTREMELY interesting and entertaining.  It is fun to read a book that gets the ole juices flowing in the brain again.  Like other reviews have said, I found myself putting down the book and running to the computer constantly to do research.  It made me WANT to learn more about art, Christianity, history, etc.  So what if a few of the facts are not 100% correct?  I looked up on the computer what was important to me, and am enjoying all the new information and theories. It will be a fun topic of discussion and debate with my friends who are Christians, Buddists, Athiests, Agnostic, etc.<br />It is a novel, not a faith deciding textbook.  If you don't agree with facts, go look it up yourself and find what YOU think is true!  If that bothers you, then go read in the non-fiction department.<br />Don't get me wrong, I am a Christain, and am very comfortable in my faith.  I think reading The Bible cover to cover can be more disturbing!  Talk about contradictions...To all the people who gave it a one star vote, thanks for your reading suggestions of &quot;The Purpose-Driven Life&quot;,&quot;Gospel&quot;, etc. I look forward to reading those too.  An open mind is a happy mind.
B00006JDVV|3.0|I put off having my say on this movie, after multiple viewings, because frankly it leaves me with mixed emotions.  A boy, visiting his mother in underground works, see the awakening of a myth - very much now reality and suddenly, England suddenly is toast.  The performances are strong, yet shallow...actors doing the best with what they are given to work with, and I think that is the core of the problem with ROF...no HEART.  You don't really care about this people, it's basically an eye-popping special effect show.  So much of what could have been an engrossing story comes across as it wow look at the dragon.<br />There is no doubt the Dragons are believable.  They can make you think dragons are real.  But while Special Effects are amazing, you need to hang them on a story of people to engage the audience.  Compare either versions of The Thing, The Terminator, or the Classic Invasion of the Body Snatchers, the horror works because you CARE about the people.<br />As it is, sit back and route for the Dragon....I was really looking forward to this one, and just feel it really missed the target.  Shame....
B00006879E|5.0|This is one of my favourite cds that I have in my collection, so I think everyone should go out and get it! That said, I would like to review the songs:<BR>Harder to Breathe-5/5 The single that was first released.  Really great song!<BR>This Love- 5/5 I really like this song because it has a really good background beat, good lyrics<BR>Shiver-5/5 Has kind of a harder sound, but really cool<BR>She Will Be Loved-5/5 A slower song, but really pretty<BR>Tangled-4/5 Has kind of a ska sound<BR>The Sun-5/5 I really like Adam's voice on this song<BR>Must Get Out-3/5 Not my favourite, but I still listen to it<BR>Sunday Morning-4/5 A different song, I really like the mood that the piano sets<BR>Secret-5/5 Another slow one, its also a really nice song<BR>Through With You-4/5 Hard to describe, just a good song<BR>Not Coming Home-4/5 I don't really like songs that have screaming audiences, but its a good song<BR>Sweetest Goodbye-5/5 Kind of slow again, but I love it.  A good way to end the cd.<BR>So I hope this helps, and I hope after reading this you'll want to buy the cd!
B0000A1RJI|4.0|Ah - yes!<br />Another thick action soundtrack from Hans &quot;Long John&quot; Zimmer! And he didn't show up alone this time, for he has brought along his German shipmate Klaus &quot;Bowsprit&quot; Badelt!<br />And when I say thick action soundtrack, I really DO mean thick action soundtrack! Hans Zimmer's most famous film-score to date must be 'Gladiator', which featured two 'thick action soundtrack' pieces. If you enjoyed those particular ones, be sure to check out this gem of a soundtrack: it pales 'Gladiator' in that respect.<br />The entire soundtrack breathes humor, energy and companionship. It has little resemblance to classic pirate film music (apart from boasting a swashbuckler, sailor's tune of a main theme) - probably disappointing those who were looking forward to that kind of soundtrack. This is deep, driving orchestral music with much synthesizer to it. It does not stop to breathe often, and it does not even attempt jerking a tear.<br />In addition, you will be happy to know there is some additional music by Nick &quot;The Admiral&quot; Glennie-Smith, Ramin &quot;salty Dog\\" Djawadi and Mel &quot;Black Spot&quot; Wesson; that the orchestra was conducted by Blake &quot;Blackstone&quot; Neely. And I must not forget to credit faithful orchestra contractor Sandy &quot;Smooth Sailing&quot; DeCrescent!<br />Concluding: it's not very original, this soundtrack - seeing that it leans fairly well on Zimmer scores like 'Crimson Tide' and 'The Gladiator', and attempts nothing new. However, it certainly has a whole hold of fun to make up for it. It doesn't stop with the music itself: the album has a great design (nice picture disc!) and these \\"harhar Jim-lad\\" nicknames throughout the credits really made me laugh aloud.<br />Gore &quot;Cap'n&quot; Verbinski and Jerry &quot;The Hook&quot; Bruckheimer can be proud of this.<br />Four sparklin' gem-gleamin' stars to this here banner.<br />Bram &quot;Uncle Dawg&quot; Janssen<br />The Netherlands

B000007T1M|5.0|but, when I herd P.L.U.C.K., I found it very addictive, so I decided to check this out, and now I listen to this CD on the road or when I'm playing Video games.<br />1. Suite-Pee:Nice intro, I believe there talking about a woman thats name is Jesus 9/10<br />2. Know:Now I found this track addidictive, and a very catchy hook as weell 10/10<br />3. Sugar:The first time I saw this was on MTV.  I found the song to be very addictive, and the ending kicks in hardcore 9/10<br />4. Suggestions:I like this song as well.  I really didn't understand it, but what the heck. It's good 10/10<br />5. Spiders:This is my favorite track.  I didn't understand it, until I saw the video.  Video was a little creepy, but I like it 10/10<br />6. Ddevil:It's a bit of a fast paced song, and it's talking about the devil(And aren't these guys christians?) 9/10<br />7. Soil:Not really singing in this song, it's more of talking in a hardcore song  9/10<br />8. War?:Systems first music video.  Didn't look high bugeted, but hey I like the song non-the less 10/10<br />9. Mind:I like this song.  It's the longest track on the whole CD, and the singer is screaming his head off  10/10<br />10. Peephole:Sounds like a bit of circus music, well until the metal kicks in  9/10<br />11. Cubert:Sounds like a cellphone for a minute, then The main part of the song kicks in.  One of my favorite tracks  10/10<br />12. Darts:Just explodes with hardcore, then gets calm, then explodes with more  10/10<br />13. P.L.U.C.K.:The first track I listened to.  The singer is talking about a whole race genisied(Ok I don't know how to spell it)  10/10<br />I don't understand most of these songs, because I'm not into metal, so 77% of the time I'm listening to it for the rush it gives me, while I'm on the road, when I'm walking around, or playing videogames.  So I'm sure Metal fans have this by now, but if not, you should get it.<br />Peace
B0000AFQS0|5.0|Nearly every DVD released these days screams &quot;Special Edition&quot;, only to prompt a puzzled &quot;And this particular edition is 'special' because...?!&quot;  reaction about 95% of the time. On occasion, however, the movie studios slip up and actually make good on the full promise of digitized audio/video restoration. The 2003 DVD version of director/superfan Jeff Stein's labor of love rockumentary about the Who, &quot;The Kids Are Alright&quot; is a perfect example of &quot;promise fulfilled&quot;. If you are only familiar with the once-in-a-blue-moon VH-1 screening, with its tattered print, muffled audio and 600 commercial interruptions, you are in for a real treat. Fans of the film won't notice a lot of difference on the early archival footage; you have to consider the source (usually fuzzy b&amp;w T.V. kinoscopes), although audio on these clips has been noticably upgraded. The restoration shines brightest on the late 70's footage that Stein staged and photographed exculsively for the film; image and sound are breathtaking, particularly for the performances of &quot;Baba O'Reilly&quot; and &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot;. With the passing of John Entwistle, this footage has become even more of a precious document, showing the original classic lineup in majestic performance probably only months before Keith Moon's unfortunate demise. A plethora of extras on Disc 2 will please the hardcore Who devotee. A must-have for classic rockers.
0312995423|1.0|Like his other books, Dan Brown works suspense and twists like a master, unfortunately he knows a lot more about religious history and symbolism than he does about technology.  Much of his discussion about computers and encryption, unfortunately the subject of this novel, is badly off-base.<br />The book is about a copmuter called \\"Translator\\" which is able to magically decrypt any message in the world in minutes using, presumably, good ju-ju.  Our heros come up against a competing wizard who has better code-fu and who has written another magic encryption program.  Yes, yes, you'll say, it's based on fact and there really are people researching encryption just like in the book, but as was said nicely in the beginning: encryption is just mathematics, negating the existence of Translator, and dramatically altering the behavior of the programs.<br />Dan Brown asks us to accept the impossible, and makes an entertaining book out of it, but it makes all of the (frequent) discussions into mathematics all the more laughable and embarassing.<br />Stick to his other books.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|A standing-O to the team that brought this DVD to be released properly. The performances are as incredible and powerful as the first time I had seen the movie or even heard their music.<br />Buy, steal or beg for a big widescreen TV, find a stereo system that goes to 11...play it large and loud.
B00005YXZH|2.0|I read all the great reviews.  I've had a copy Wilco's &quot;Being There&quot; for years and still play it.  So I was really surprised at how little I enjoyed &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot;.  To me, it just &quot;missed&quot;.  I don't really know how else to describe it.  A lot of the songs seemed to have promise, but none of them seemed to fulfill it.  I tried replaying it many times, over a period of months, but just couldn't find any reason to keep it in my player - I didn't like it at all.  Finally had to sell it.
078322947X|5.0|I agree with most that this is a underlooked classic.....extremely intense, with scenes that really make you wonder...how did they do that??? Way before special digital effects were ever used...this stuff was staged to make your jaw drop......I always loved this movie, have the Laserdisc copy....and am going to get the DVD...it was framed at 1.66:1 on laserdisc, which was how Mr. Friedkin wanted it shown (according to laserdisc), so a full frame version is not missing very much picture.....buy this movie if you liked the original it is based on &quot;Wages of Fear&quot;, or just want to be rivetted to your seat for a few hours.......this is great storytelling, done my a master......
B000059MEK|5.0|I don't know where to classify this album, but damn the genre, this is just fantastic music. I find this record thoroughly enjoyable everytime I put it in. Anyone who needs an album to put them in a good mood has come to the right place. If I was a good dancer, I would cut the rug all night to these tracks. They're just so driving and upbeat you can't help but at least start to nod your head. And the more relaxed songs like Nightvision and Something About Us are smooth as butter. I recommend this album to anyone looking for a good time. Give Discovery a try, it's a very rewarding cd.
B0000C8AUO|3.0|when Led Zepplin would be the background music for Cadillac ads and Ziggy Stardust and Rebel, Rebel would be the bumper music for the local network TV news!!!<br />Like most of the reviewers I love Bowie, but I must explain my Bowie Star rating scale.  Five stars would be Bowie in his prime with ground breaking material and/or his latest re-invention.  Ziggy, Diamond Dogs, Lodger or Let's Dance. One would be Tin Machine 1&amp;2 which still makes my skin crawl when I think of it.  In Reality this is a three-star effort.  <br />I guess it is fitting that Bowie include a couple of covers to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the release of Pinups, an album of covers, and the first Bowie album I ever owned.  I enjoyed the idea of Pablo Picasso, but like the original Repo Man soundtrack version better.<br />Loved hearing Mike Garson's Aladine Sane piano again after all these years.  Bonus track of Rebel, Rebel just goes to show what an anthem it really is.  The energy elevates to a higher plane than the rest of the CD.  I can't wait to see this rendition performed Live at the upcoming Reality tour. Maybe it trails off at the end in homage to the Chant of the Ever Circling Skeletal Family bro-bro-bro-bro-bro...
B00006M183|4.0|It amazes me how many people I know go on how great Pearl Jam were, and that Ten and Vs were awsome albums. Many seem to forget the band have since released 3 classics and 2 top quality records in the past 7 years. pearl Jam create music for the love of it knowing their small but faithfull following will warm to new material.<BR>Riot Act sees a small return to the straight hitting hard/classic rock of earlier days, however the experimental side has not been eluded.<BR>Opener Cant Keep istantly flashes back to their No Code (96) sound. I am Mine reminds me of mid 90's R.E.M while Half Full is classic rock at its very best.<BR>Thumbing my way to Heaven is a beautiful acoustic ballad and is actually the softest sound I've heard by the band.<BR>Riot Act is a diverse upbeat melodic album, anyone wishing to rediscover this band should start here.
B00005JLT5|3.0|Let me get this out of the way, first and foremost, and say that I don't believe \\"The Pianist\\" is a BAD movie, per se. If I said that \\"The Pianist\\" was BAD, I'm sure I would be labeled a Nazi sympathizer and be sent to a leper colony somewhere in Luxembourg. Now, let me get another thing out of the way and say that \\"The Pianist\\" isn't really a very good movie, either. Yes, Adrien Brody delivers a good performance in the film, and the cinematography adequately captures the violent environment that was Poland in the early 1940's. Now, let's talk about some things that \\"The Pianist\\" DOESN'T do, such as presenting anything new or relevant to the pursuit of portraying the Holocaust in film. I'm not sure why more people didn't see this, but \\"The Pianist\\" follows the typical NBC movie-of-the-week Holocaust format almost to a T: happy Jewish family enjoys life, happy Jewish family hears about the war, happy Jewish family begins to suffer discrimination, happy Jewish family gets pushed out, happy Jewish family gets sent to camp, one gets left behind, rest of movie follows him. I think I might have seen something like this on \\"Lifetime\\" a couple of weeks ago. Now, is it a CRIME that Roman Polanski chose to be so completely ordinary in his rendering of the Holocaust (even though he went through it himself and could have really brought some needed emotional depth to the film, one thing it lacks badly)? Not really. His film isn't hurting anyone by being the complete antithesis of something fresh and important such as \\"Schindler's List.\\" What happens to \\"The Pianist\\" in its prodding, typical narrative, is that it becomes simply an \\"Okay\\" movie, something that a person as talented as Polanski shouldn't create. The Holocaust DID happen and has been etched in time, but movies have done a fantastic job of rendering historical events in a fashion that brings new light to them. \\"Schindler's List\\" was so groundbreaking because it was spare, raw, and mainly from a Nazi's perspective. \\"The Pianist\\" may be well-made, but that doesn't mean it's great by any means. It's a book of Holocaust cliches poured into a grossly overlong film. There is a touchy ground that is broached when it comes to critiquing a film about such an important time in world history - one that demeans a Holocaust film looks unpatriotic, or unsympathetic. I'm simply rating a film here, and Holocaust-or-not, \\"The Pianist\\" is hopelessly ordinary and didn't deserve any of the three Academy Awards it received.
B0000027RL|5.0|Nirvana may have been the band that broke grunge, but Ten is the alternative record of the past ten years. With it classic rock sound combined with intricately arranged guitar textures and immense harmonic range, Ten was and remains a masterpiece. <BR> Vedders highly distinctive trimbre voice fits perfectly into the album that is full of warm, rich sounds. From the rocking Even FLow, Alive and jeremy, to the hauntingly beautiful 'Black' ( a truly amazing song) and Oceans ( u will play this track over and over). Ten is flawless, a really solid hard rock, but melodic masterpiece.
B00006879E|5.0|Dont be decieved by their single and first song on the cd, Harder to Breathe. The rest of the cd is less boy-bandish and more mellow rock. I love it! I listen to it whatever mood i'm in. It's great.

B00008WG3U|4.0|Anyone who compares The Strokes with a no-talent ass clown band like Good Charlotte needs a serious beating. Get your head straight or I'll do it for you.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I COULD sum it up with one word, Amazing.  It is even more than that though.  Its beautiful, intense, addictive, in a class of its own, the list could go on and on.  It is a rarity to find an album with such talent and musical harmony.  This puts probably 99% of today's music to utter shame.  This album hits every aspect of what I call excellent music.  From the melodic guitar riffs to the extreme intensity of Maynards vocals.  It can be like being in a calm soothing dream, one instant, and the next complete chaos.  I was listening to it while my girlfriend was sleeping.  She said it gave her nightmares.  How cool is that?  Everytime I listen to the album, the hairs on my body stand on end.  Definitely the best album to hit the stands in 2003.
B000002GLE|5.0|This is a great CD.  I play it during cocktail parties or when we've gathered folks on the patio.  The songs blend well, and it has some classic live moments.  If you've seen the movie of Bring on the Night, it makes this soundtrack even better.

B00003CXI1|3.0|We love the movies and the books.  We were very disappointed in this DVD though, becaue it comes in a paper holder.  We really prefer the nice plastic DVD holders.  My husband was so disappointed that I think he's going to order another one so that he can get the plastic holder.
B0000630BT|5.0|Painkiller features priest's best sound ever. productionwise, their latest two albums still dont hold a candle to this one, while in terms of musical quality, this is JP's greatest<br />album to date. a new producer and a new, very innovative drummer helped the band welcome the nineties with style! the lyrics are like always...er...lousy at best! but we dont buy<br />Priest albums, in search for spiritual enlightenment, do we, boys? the dual guitar attacks in here reign from high above, in the heavy metal universe. fast, furious, neat, screaming-<br />for-vengeance, frosted cheeseball metal never sounded better.
B000005RTG|5.0|What a great album is this one! You can listen to the energetic enthusiasm here and how much they are enjoying recording the songs. This is one of Purple's finest albums. The Coverdale vocal trademark on &quot;Lady Luck&quot;, &quot;I Need Love&quot; &amp; &quot;Drifter&quot;, the great &quot;Gettin' tighter&quot;, the awesome &quot;Love child&quot;, the beautiful &quot;This time around&quot; with the usual great Glenn Hughes vocals, and the finest tune in here &quot;You keep on moving&quot; which is sometimes left out of DP compilations. Unbelievable. This album has no waste. Enjoyable from beginning to end. Tommy Bolin fits perfectly well with the band. Comparing him with Ritchie Blackmore is unfair, like BK from Philadelphia does. Yes, Ritchie may be better guitarist, but thinking that Tommy Bolin is not that good 'cos of comparations?... well then I will mention Jimi Hendrix and then Ritchie can go to wash dishes ;-)  So what I mean is, not because of the &quot;not being as good as&quot; it means is not a valid effort. Tommy Bolin does a great job and on the writing of songs, Ritchie is not missed at all. Neither on the performance of them. And again, for those who glorify Ritchie Blackmore, just take a listen to the album he did in DP with Joe Lynn Turner on vocals :-S  Certainly the worst DP album ever and HE WAS THERE BUDS! So people, move on, Deep Purple with or without Blackmore still rocks and it's on great shape !!!! DEEP PURPLE KEEPS ON MOVING!! Also VERY RECOMMENDED the Live CDs of this line up: &quot;LIVE in TOKYO 1975&quot; and &quot;LONG BEACH ARENA 1976&quot;.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|i listen to a lot of black metal so i wont be too demanding here, in terms of production. a lot of people said dickinson's voice sounds 'muffled' compared to brave new world. i agree, but still the sound does in no way entitle me to slam this album down.<br />the thing is: maiden has now 3 guitarists. 3 really talented ones, but the guitar work i'm hearing here, could be easily covered by 2 axemen. this is a 'gap' the band should be working on in order to better exploit the effect out of 3 guitars.<br />The artwork... is gut wrenching... is eddie envying children of bodom that much to imitate their mascot's stance??? and what's with the Poser 3-D imagery?? very very bad. but oh, well...what we're reviewing is the music, not the artwork.<br />the song structure is beginning to sound 'kitschy', with this annoying bass-driven melody lines that start every other song on &quot;dance of death&quot;. the band is in need of exploring new musical formulas.<br />i love the way how 'wildest dreams' starts: very 'Priestian' indeed but the track soon becomes a sludgy mire of sound and the hook of the intro is wasted. enough criticism! my favorites on that album are undoubtedly: &quot;rainmaker&quot;, (the second half of)&quot;Dance of Death&quot;, &quot;new frontier&quot;, &quot;paschendale&quot; and &quot;gates of tomorrow&quot;. 5 REALLY awesome songs here. these tracks would comfortably fit between &quot;aces high&quot;, &quot;tailgunner&quot; and &quot;2 minutes to midnight&quot; on a live album.<br />i dont remember i could pick up 5 favorites from Brave New World (although the album was very good and coherent over-all). so here you are now. if you're a maiden fan you probably are the happy owner of that album already. new fans will definitely love it too. the tracks mentioned above are  worth the price of admission alone and make the album as good as &quot;fear of the dark&quot; (in other words, better than Brave new world, virtual XI and No prayer for the dying). just put a black piece of cardboard over the artwork and enjoy this fine maiden release!k piece of cardboard over the artwork and enjoy this fine maiden release!
0441009425|5.0|Heading into this book I had heard a lot of good things about it...but none of it firsthand...so even though I was fairly sure I would like this book I still had some doubt.  Very early on all doubt was squelched.  This book is fantastic.  A space opera in the truest sense of the word...spanning across light-years of space.  I've read quite a bit of SciFi and there are several ideas in this book that are, if not totally unique, used in ways that I've never seen before.  This book is definitely worth the time spent on it...you'll come away eager for more of Alastair Reynolds's work.
B00005JLKB|4.0|I love Smallville. When I heard that the first season was coming out so soon, I knew I had to get it the first day it came out. My first expectations was that I just get just that, the whole first season. Watching it from beginning to end really makes you engulf in the whole storyline of and making you want to watch a lot more of what goes on in the town of Smallville. The dvd delivers, with all the episodes in animorphic view, which I think is great. All of the episodes are so crystal clear making it better than watching the broadcast. Sound is great too, that is if you have a great system. The extras is a little bare. Commentaries on only 2 episodes, deleted scenes on the same 2 episodes, and a mini tour around Smallville. Thats about it. A little more couldn't hurt. O'wells, maybe season 2. All in all, a great DVD compilation.
B0000AOV85|5.0|Man this DVD is a fantastic thing for any fan of Pink Floyd. I was especially glad to see Richard Wright here. He was always the quiet one in the background.In my opinion his contributions to the band were enormous. He got pushed out of the band by Roger Waters, who had become quite a tyrant. But all these years later it was great to hear Roger speak fondly of Rick - and even of David Gilmour, for that matter. I wonder if the four Floyds each watched this DVD and maybe wondered...maybe a reunion might not be so impossible after all! Please! Before it's too late! ( Update: well the lads DID reunite after all, playing four songs together at Live 8. Thank you!!!)<br />  This DVD is definitely worth buying. It may be the closest thing to a Pink Floyd reunion we'll ever get. But I hope the positive vibe created by this DVD will get them back on stage again - with Roger this time! And just the four of them, none of this \\"army of session musicians\\" up there with them.<br />  Anyone at all optimistic about this? (Again: they went and did it, against all odds. So thanks to Roger, David, Rick and Nick for giving us all the next best thing to a Beatles reunion, the coming together of Pink Floyd.)
B0000033IR|5.0|I was a 13-year-old kid when I first picked this one up in the record store in February of 1968.  Then, it was enough for me that it contained two established solid hits of Aretha's, \\"Natural Woman,\\" and \\"Chain Of Fools.\\" A third, \\"Since You've Been Gone,\\" was quickly on the rise itself coinciding with the release of this LP. Since, by then, we knew how well (thanks to \\"Respect\\" and her version of the Stones' \\"Satisfaction\\" on `Aretha Arrives') she could take songs others had already done and make them into something stunningly new, \\"Niki Hokey,\\" \\"Groovin'\\" and \\"People Get Ready\\" held great promise. They delivered.  I was a bit young yet to understand the deep angst Aretha addressed in her sister's \\"Ain't No Way,\\" but enough time and enough listens worked in that instance. (As \\"Since You Been Gone's\\" B-side, it charted as a single in its own right, too.)<br />However, one song would have to wait until seasoned adulthood for me to fully appreciate.  `Seasoned,' in the sense of having been on both the winning and losing sides of love.  \\"Good To Me As I Am To You,\\" lyrically, is of the identical mind-set of \\"Respect,\\" but this time Miss Franklin authored her own.  It doesn't try to be any dance-jam like her signature hit, and in that sense, it comes off perhaps even more startling. Leslie Gore's \\"You Don't Own Me,\\" was one thing, this was something ELSE.  It's astonishing to realize how daring a thing it was then for a female singer, to lay it on the line like this:  \\"Starting today, tomorrow, and forever more - If YOU can't find it in your heart to DO for ME, then, baby, just don't darken my front door!\\"  On this song, Lady Soul wonders out loud to herself and her lover, if he'd be willing to lend her any portion of his last dollar, as quickly as she'd turn over her last dime to HIM. Aretha was sending two signals to her audience here, I think.  First, she was telling us that whatever `heartbreak' song she'd sing in the future, she'd never sing of being anyone's doormat. Secondly, she sent a from-the-pulpit message to us that, when you've surrendered self-respect in a relationship, it's no longer one that can be called `love.'<br />I don't know how to recommend this album highly enough.  Like the very best book you've ever read, it could very possibly change your life.<br />Let me concluded with nuts &amp; bolts info, then.  \\"Lady Soul,\\" originally Atlantic LP 8176, was Aretha's third for Atlantic, and the last that was released in both mono and stereo versions.  \\"Aretha Now\\" would show up in June of '68, and they'd all be stereo only from that one forward.  Her original Atlantic 45's, with one or two exceptions, would remain in mono until the end of 1972.  Get this album.mat.

6305949980|5.0|this movie is pretty good has great stop motion animation. most stuff I've seen that's stop motion isn't as good as this. everything moves smoothly. i think it has a good storyline too  I really like the character design. It's a good family movie or if you want to see something with actually great animation it's a good movie to get too.
B00006690G|3.0|Just like every other slim Shady album, this is a combination of great hooks, great beats, but completely wack rhymes.  Its not that he isnt talented, its that he has the mentality of a 10 year old when he rhymes.  It gets three stars for the production (which is mostly handled by em) but when he's actually rapping it's nothing but nasal rantings.(example my dad's gone crazy)  I'm waitng for a Eminem album that lives up to his potential, i might be waitng a long time...
B00005JKL8|2.0|To me this movie has a weak story and is boring. Gene Hackman's talent is wasted. Owen Wilson should be in comic movies only.
B000084T18|4.0|The production of a Shady record combined with a quality rapper.  My only beef with this excellent album is the fact that 50 dumbed down his rhymes as compared to his unreleased material.  I later read in an article he did this on purpose since south side rap is quite popular right now(Ludacris, Lil Jon, Mystikal, Cash Money etc...) so he incorporated in his style to get a east meets south feel to his rap; which is all good and fine but 50 had much more complex rhymes.  Oh well, simplicity is what people want just listen to the radio.
B0000B3B95|4.0|The special effects as Eric Bana changes into The Hulk are outstanding. It definately is the best part of the movie. The plot is very good and kept me interested. I just didn't think there was alot of romantic sizzle between Eric Bana's and Jennifer Connelly's characters. They are supposed to be in love, but it seemed kind of cool. But then again, this isn't a love story, its sci-fi. And if you are a sci-fi fan who loves special effects you will really enjoy this movie.
0440214041|3.0|Besides The King of Torts and The Runaway Jury, this is one of my favorite Grisham books.  I just think that this one could have been a bit shorter.  There was a lot of unnecessary information that could have been left out.  It was a great book nonetheless.  After three judges are murdered, a young female law student writes a short brief suggesting who committed the murders and why.  The brief is passed around to too many people and now some of those people want her dead.
B0000B1OFN|5.0|This was one of the best movies I have seen. The cast is incredible, the acting is outstanding, and the plot really holds your attention. And the chase scenes with that little car down in the subway are amazing. I told alot of my friends to go see it, that it was a great movie.
B00005QGAX|5.0|I think that any music recording and performing artist nowdays would have chocked under the inmence success of an album because thats what Thriller was inmencely successfull. Bad was a complete turnaround both physicaly and musicaly for Michael Jackson, however it could have easily been his complete letdown or failure and not live up to his reputation of a real superstar but not only do I think Bad is better than Thriller but I felt that Michael shows more emotion and charecter, more personality and strength through his lyrics and performences in the Bad album, songs like; &quot;The Way You Make Me Feel&quot;, &quot;Liberian Girl&quot;, &quot;Speed Demon&quot; and &quot;Dirty Diana&quot; just to name a few that captured everyone everywhere. Bad showed Michael's determination, his anger, his class and grace. Michael Jackson is like a wishing tree he has got different aspects and Bad shows that. Though troubled by personal issues he still was able to reache a higher level both in performence and presence, many people can say whatever they want about the Bad album or Michael for that matter but I see the Bad album as Michael's personality in some way, he's never content and after 5 years of having done Thriller he evolved with time and his life became music again and as a huge and very loyal fan for 9 years now from Peru, I have faith that he'll continue to do so. He sends out a message that he will be back wether in success (Thriller) or in failure (Invinsible) not that it was but for his standards i think even the King-of-Pop will agree. Bad is just that, it was and is invinsible.
B000001TVD|1.0|....but something about this LP continues to repel me. After spending some more time with it and listening very closely to the whole affair, my opinion has not changed. Eddie Hazel's guitar work just doesn't appeal to me. The title track always depresses me and sends me running for some Beatles, Parliament or Nick Drake. Anything.....is better than this mess of an album. I can't explain it, but &quot;Maggot Brain&quot; remains one of the worst releases I've ever heard. Maybe it's a mental thing, but to me, this shouldn't even exist, let alone be called a masterpiece, just my humble opinion. I will never listen to this again....it just has a weird, unnerving effect on me. Strange.
B000089RVR|5.0|What can one say about Dido, she has the perfect smooth voice and clever songs that not only make you want to hear her music but really listen to her songs. Her songs of love and relationships have incisiveness that makes you identify with all her characters. Maybe it is her literary back ground, that make her want to weave a story into every song.<br />There are some outstanding tracks on her, of course White flag is great as is See the Sun and the title track Life for Rent. My favorite is Sand in my Shoes, a great song and takes me back to my youth. Anyone who has listened to Faithless can't help but hear the influences of her brother all through the album, though that may be a bit disingenuous to Dido. This is a fantastic CD, and may even be better than No Angel.
0394716787|5.0|This edition does not feature Poe's complete works, but his complete tales and samples of his other writings. This is not a scholarly edition: among other things, the dates of composition are not included, and the tales aren't presented chronologically. But at least they're all here. I don't have a problem with the overall presentation - most 'collected works' books carry small writing, and this one is very readable. Typos are few and far between. What more can be said about this book's tales? They benefit at least as much from re-reading as any fiction writing around, and all offer multiple levels of interpretation for those interested in crypted messages (the religious dimension of the works remains underrated to this day). From 'William Wilson' to 'The Man of the Crowd', from 'The Power of Words' to 'Hop-Frog', there's something for everybody here. This collection is a great starting point for those intrigued by this misunderstood genius.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I had actually first come to like Linkin Park through an FF8 music video that featured &quot;Runaway&quot; and I was instantly hooked forever.<br />I downloaded many of their songs from Hybrid Theory and spent several consecutive weeks listening to their songs. It wasn't until a month or two later that I bought Reanimation and loved it!<br />After a long time without Linkin Park on the radio, I started to wonder if they would ever come back. Then, I heard &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; on the radio while I was learning to drive. The song was incredible. After school one day, I walked to the closest Best Buy and bought the CD and have never looked back.<br />I can't decide which of the three CDs I liked better. Linkin Park has outdone themselves with 2 absolutely incredible CDs. My favorites include &quot;Faint&quot;, &quot;Numb&quot;, &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot;, &quot;Easier To Run&quot; and &quot;Session&quot;.<br />I highly recommend anyone who likes rap-rock, alternative, their previous CD, anyone...BUY THIS CD NOW! I guarantee you won't regret it!
0380002930|4.0|Reviewers before me, both professional and amateur, here on Amazon and elsewhere have written with greater eloquence than mine the original and majestic brilliance of this book.  I will just mention that the allegory of rabbits in exile is very relevant today.  A wonderful read for all ages!<br />Adams equals and perhaps exceeds George Orwell's \\"Animal Farm\\", Rudyard Kipling's \\"The Jungle Book\\", Kenneth Grahame's \\"The Wind in the Willows\\", and E.B. White's \\"Charlotte's Web\\" in the animal genre of fiction.  He even locates the story in a real enough place, the downs of Berkshire.
B000089RVR|5.0|Outstanding voice, music, songwriting, everything.  I have been anticipating the release of this CD for over a month now and I was not disappointed.  I can relate to every song in some way, and I especially love &quot;See the Sun&quot; and the bonus song that follows behind it.  Other favorites are &quot;Sand In My Shoes&quot;, a great song about going on vacation, finding love, and returning home never to see that person again but longing to; and &quot;Mary's in India&quot;, a song that strangely reminds me of Sinead O'Connor's &quot;The Last Day Of Our Acquaintance&quot;.  This is by far the best CD I have purchased and listened to all year.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|in short this is the closest to funk the band gets although this album is quite diverse.  SLEEP NOW IN THE FIRE is as pure rock as one can get, while BORN OF A BROKEN MAN has a nice chorus, quiet and seductive as Zach, in complete contrast, paints a dark picture for us and then all hell breaks loose on the chours as the band literally expldoes one thousand times over.  brilliant and beautiful.  TESTIFY, the first single, is classic rage and a great begginning to a great album.    <BR>    Tom Morello is one of the most innovative and uniqe guitar players to ever pick up the instrument.  (eddie van halen..eat your heart out) and brad and Y.Tim.K are the rhythm section of perfection.  drums to hold the music with simple phat beats and mad fills and yet exude the emotions to enhance the music.  it is hard to exude emotions on drums and he does it well.  they all do. all of them do an awesome job.   the four of them together is pure flammable candy.  <BR>    never have i been so content to swallow fire.  Zach is as unrelenting and even more posessed and exploding with intensity than ever.  Tim hold it all together on bass and i love this band.  they are a finely tuned machine in which no member outshines any other.  it is the combination of this agressive hip hop meets rock quartet that gets me thinking as im moshing which puts them way ahead of their time and the pack.
B00005JLZN|5.0|I don't need to tell you what THE LIFE OF DAVID GALE is about, there are plenty of other reviews that do just that.  I would, however, like to explain to people why they should see this movie.<BR>I should first start by saying that I am for the death penalty, even after seeing this movie.  But, for me the thing that was most compelling was that someone would actually let themselves die when self-clearing evidence exists. It makes sense that Kevin Spacey is a professor of philosophy in this movie, for, this movie is at times very philosophical. It is intriguing to me that with the growing number of suicide bombers and martyrs in the world, that this movie did not gain more attention based on the American ideal that life is too precious to die for.  But does that mean that if life is sooo precious in the U.S. that we should abolish the death penalty?  I don't know.  That is a question to ponder.  <br />On the lighter side, I found it kinda cheesy that Kevin Spacey plays a modern day martyr.  But his acting is superb, and I don't normally care for his work.<br />My review is a bit scattered I know, but I hope that you will take into consideration the quality of the movie and not the quality of my review.  As I mentioned earlier, I am for the death penalty, but, this movie expanded my horizons and allowed me to &quot;see the other side.&quot;  It did not change my opinion, however it did make me think, which is why I believe that Kevin Spacey and Kate Winslet took their roles. I intend to purchase this DVD and show it to all my friends so that they too can be shown the &quot;other side.&quot; And I think you should too!
0440237688|4.0|Louis Lowry's the Giver is offers an extremely interesting look at a possible future in a Utopian society that is both well written and philosophically interesting.  Of these positive aspects the most significant are the philosophical problems and ideas suggested by the work.  Most notable of these is the balance of safety and elimination of the negative aspects of the world with the elimination of the truly beautiful and wonderful things exist as well.  These along with other musings on individuality form a novel that is intellectually stimulating as well as simply enjoyable.  The book is plainly written and should be easily accessible to anyone over the age of twelve or even eleven (although they may not quite grasp the full implications of the novel).  I would recommend this book to readers of all ages.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|Ok, this is an EP release so my comments will be brief as well.  I had to speak on the half-a** reviews I've been reading and obviously these people a) don't get it; b) are not over the age of 25; or c) just don't understand real soul music.  This CD is not for \\"youngins\\", its \\"grown-folks music\\" and not in the same vein as her previous releases such as \\"Mama's Gun\\". I was a little taken aback when seeing only 50 minutes of music but again, this is an EP and most albums 20-25 years ago were only 35-45 minutes long.  This is a true R&B underground mixtape and not meant for the commercial-at-heart.  If you want to hear real music, folks jamming, and 70's/80's funk and early hip-hop stylings, buy this CD.  If you want the same ol booty-shaking radio gunk, get gone!  I felt like I picked up one of my older cousins vinyl 33's back when I was a kid while listening to this.  Track 4 is definitely the most expansive song on the CD, but don't listen to me totally, check it out fo' yo' self.
B00009NH5W|5.0|I hate to sound trite and repetitive of the other reviewers, but this C.D. is damned good.  Sananda Maitreya has absolutely outdone Terence Trent D'Arby's past recordings.  The first cut, &quot;O Divina&quot; is as close to a masterpiece that I'll ever hear (gosh, I hope aforementioned egocentric artist isn't reading this).  His voice goes from sweet and melodic to rough and gritty with such grace that it gives you chills and tightens the chest (I swear, it wasn't the McGriddle from this morning).  Get this C.D. just for the vocal and musical arrangements.  There's no funny business going on with equalizers and computer layering and coating his voice .  This man, no doubt, can SANG! &quot;My Dark Places&quot; is sung with such raw emotion that you can feel his  the breath and spit spraying out of his mouth when he asks &quot;will you help me bring a candle into the liiiight?.&quot;   With &quot;Ev'rythang&quot;, when he's stating &quot;the view from the mountains is the same as the view from the shore&quot;, you're anticipating that he wants to be one with nature, but he wants to be one with &quot;EVRYTANG EVRYTHANG EVRYTHANG...&quot; just truly amazing.  Every song is truly special and is riveting in its own way.  He is a thoughtful, insightful poet and it translates beautifully into the music.  Buy this C.D. for all of your friends that enjoy good &quot;sangin'&quot;, funky beats and outstanding songwriting.
B00004YA0T|5.0|Not so much a review, but a recommendation: these excellent recordings are now available for the price of only one fullprice cd on Brilliant Classics.<br />Buy this box, I would say.<br /><br />Well allright, a small review.<br />Compared to Gunther Wand and Haitink, Jochum is much more dramatic and highlights the contrasts in the music.<br />It is somewhat less natural than Haitink's and Wand's approach, but to my ears it works well with Bruckner's somewhat \\"naked\\" structure: large and heavy symphonic moving blocks in an empty space.<br />Mahler's music for instance is already richly shaped by the composer, the music is filled with ideas and variation and therefore I usually dislike a personal interpretive reading, the music itself is already strongly structured.<br /><br />With Bruckner's music a conducter's guidance works very well.<br />Jochum is powerful, dramatic and lyrical at the same time and listening to his performances I often get the impression that the music cannot be played differently. But to be honest: I have the same impression with Wand and Haitink, when listening to them.<br /><br />\\"In general I rate Wand's and Haitink's readings higher, for a more natural approach of the music: Jochum can be too measured in the slow movements where he at times slows down too much at the cost of the music's flow, but these are minor complaints.\\"<br /><br />This I wrote at first and has been unchanged for a few weeks, luckily one is able to edit a review at Amazon.com and I can claim with confidence that Jochum's readings top those of Wand and Haitink.<br />Jochum phrases the music better and lets the orchestra better articulate.<br />With Wand the music is more or less undefined, I still like it that way, but Jochum's approach I like much better.<br /><br />The playing is excellent, although the brass can be a bit rough in tuttis and sometimes they sound out of tune.<br />The sound good too: nice depth and clarity allover, maybe a bit aggressive at times in the higher registers.
B000089RVR|3.0|Life for Rent is pretty.  They are lovely songs, in the smokey, folky, electronic pop that Dido does very nicely.  But this album is full of songs in the laid-back pop, subtly bouncy vein of &quot;Thank You&quot; and &quot;Isobel.&quot;  It's not broken up with &quot;bigger&quot; songs...nothing approaching &quot;Here With Me,&quot; &quot;Take My Hand,&quot; or &quot;Hunter&quot; on this album, unfortunately.
B00005JKZV|5.0|this film is brill a great adaption by peater jackson of J.R.R Tolkin i recomend this to everybody.
B00004Z400|5.0|&quot;Around the Fur&quot; may be the Deftones' best album, but &quot;White Pony&quot; comes pretty close to that category. Unlike the previously mentioned album and their debut &quot;Adrenaline&quot;, &quot;White Pony&quot; finds the band getting more melodic with their sound while still maintaining a heavy edge. Less rap/rock sounding than their previous releases and with slicker sounding production, &quot;White Pony&quot; is a treat for the ears. Standout tracks include &quot;Digital Bath&quot;, the Grammy winning &quot;Elite&quot;, &quot;Rx Queen&quot;, &quot;Korea&quot;, &quot;Teenager&quot;, &quot;Pink Maggit&quot;, and the album's big highlight &quot;Passenger&quot; which features Deftones voice Chino Moreno singing with Tool/A Perfect Circle frontman Maynard James Keenan. That song is worth the price of admission alone, and is incredibly haunting.  This is the re-released version of &quot;White Pony&quot; which includes an extra track entitled &quot;Back to School (Mini Maggit)&quot; which is pretty much the same as &quot;Pink Maggit&quot; albeit a bit more rap/rock flavored and fast paced. All in all, consider this essential listening, even if your not a hardcore Deftones fan.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park is by far the greatest band ever created. I have all three of their albums and i also have the limted &quot;hybrid theory EP&quot; which is great. Most people say that lp is just a mtv teeny band but screw you people. sure they are on mtv but they are everywhere these days. My favorite track on Hybrid theory is &quot;points of authority&quot; chester has one of the greatest voices i have ever heard and mike can rap like no other. so if your gonna come on here and diss LP have a better reason then what most other people write..its gonna be hard.
B000002LK1|4.0|To all but their fans (a very large and devout bunch, granted), until this album, many regarded Depeche Mode as a 'one hit wonder' (at least in the US).  Sad, but true, most people only remembered the band for their mid 80's hit 'People Are People', which, while a very subversive pop track, was not even the best track off of the stellar &quot;Some Great Reward&quot; album.  The doubters and neighsayers must've been truly surprised when this album was released and went on to spawn several hit singles, not the least of which was &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;, which holds the record for the best selling CD single of all time.<BR>While certainly not the band's best work, it's hard to fault this album as a pop album.  Sure, the band flirted a little bit more with mainstream sensibilities, but never without sounding like themselves, and ultimately, not without losing the dark edge that appealed to so many of their fans.  This combination turned out to be a winning one for the band, as it went on to become their best selling album.<BR>If you're a newbie trying to break in to the world of Depeche Mode, this might be a good place to start... but regardless, it is in all ways essential and will not disappoint.
B00005J4HH|5.0|I heard Muse for the first time during vacation in Europe on MTV2 (that's how I also discovered Music, another great european band), they were playing &quot;Newborn&quot;. The song grabbed me from the very first piano note. I love the combination of soft piano, hard riffs of guitars and haunting voice of Matt. I bought both OOS and Showbiz, I play them every day and discover something new every time. It is unusual music, difficult to categorize- there is enough of hard rock to satisfy &quot;harder sound&quot; fans, enough melodic arrangements for your softer side and everything is blended with great skill. This is no background music, it will force you to listen. I am looking forward to their new projects,  I am sure I will not be dissapointed.
B0000C7PRY|5.0|I have been waiting a long time for a CD like Testimony.  Most of the &quot;christian music&quot; I hear does nothing for me.  This CD has the progressive style that I love and good lyrical content.  Neal Morses song writing in tight while telling his story of his search for faith in Christ.  This is a CD that will get heavy play time in my CD player.
6305090564|3.0|Jeff Shannon can't say it any better about writer/director Stephen Sommers than he does in his review, but you've got to admit that the director of The Mummy and The Mummy Returns sure does know how to entertain.  Deep Rising doesn't aspire to be anything special, and it certainly isn't, but thanks to the solid (if underachieving) cast and gruesome special effects, Deep Rising manages to be better than most of the slew of derivative Aliens knock offs that it is associated to.  Treat Williams plays the typical hero role as he and his group of mercenaries arrive on an ocean liner to find most of the crew slaughtered by a huge leviathan like creature with a taste for blood and guts.  The special effects are nicely done for the most part, but the film's biggest flaw is that it is entirely too predictable.  The rest of the cast includes the gorgeous Famke Janssen (X-Men), Kevin J. O'Conner (The Mummy), Anthony Heald (Silence of the Lambs), Cliff Curtis (Training Day), Djimon Hounsou (Amistad), and the late Trevor Goddard (Pirates of the Caribbean).  All in all, if your looking for a half decent way to kill an hour or two, this isn't such a bad choice.
B0000B3FCX|5.0|After a major sucess with Silver Side Up, Nickelback does it again with The Long Road. This album is great because it mixes so many things toether. There are songs that are pretty much heavy metal, but some of the songs(Someday, Feelin' Too Damn Good)are softer. They are all good songs with  great bonus tracks. Nickelback does a remake to &quot;Saturday Night's Alright (for fighting) by Elton John which s great. They stick to the song and do a great job of using the same words. They also put in the song from the Scorpion King soundtrack. There are many good things about this album. It is a must have.<br />                 NICKELBACK DOES IT AGAIN!
B00006879E|3.0|I was at a taping of the Ellen DeGenerous Show (great show by the way, check it out) and Maroon 5 was the musical guest. By hearing their name I had no clue who they were until they started playing &quot;Harder to Breathe&quot; and then I recognized the song. At the end of the show they handed out free CDs so I played it on the way home. I don't have much to say about this band other than they are good. Not great. There are two problems. The main problem is the song lyrics. They're good but all of the songs could use some more work. Often times the lyrics are either silly or don't make sense and throw the song off track. The other problem is the lead singer. He's got a unique voice. Hard to describe. He sounds like a Sesame Street Muppet. But it's enjoyable. It's just that his voice is so weak and he thinks he's Celine Dion or something and tries to go for this powerful notes and it sounds more like rejects from American Idol. He either needs vocal lessons (AND LEARN HOW TO NOT SING OUT OF HIS NOSE) or he needs to lay off the big notes. I give this album a C-. It's good but for a debut album it should have been cleaned up a bit.
B000089RVR|5.0|I have to say that Dido's Freshman album &quot;No Angel&quot; is one of those CD's you just never get tired of. I literally have worn it out and am sure to do the same with her Sophmore album &quot;Life for Rent&quot;. More subdued songs this time, but same great voice. I agree with the other reviewers Dido is underrated. She stands out among today's artists. Even Eminem thinks so!!!!Perfect CD for work, home, car and where-ever!!! Hope we don't have to wait four more years for another great Dido album!
0790729628|5.0|Ridley Scott's chilling vision of the future has become so revered and so inspiring over the years that it is a crying shame that Blade Runner can only be found on a lackluster DVD like this.  The only saving grace for the Blade Runner DVD itself is that it is Scott's original cut of the film minus the happy ending and Harrison Ford's over explanatory voice over.  Any sci-fi fan knows the impact Blade Runner made since it's release over 20 years ago, but for God's sake this film is in desperate need of a re-release.  Warner Bros. has a dubious track record for first releasing some of their best films on lackluster extra-less DVD's, and then years later re-releasing them on 2 disc mostly extra filled sets.  Just look at One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest, True Romance, and Unforgiven to see what I mean.  If Blade Runner ever does get re-released (and we all know eventually it will be) it should come with a much better picture resolution (the picture on this DVD is terrible), commentaries from Scott, Ford, and Rutger Hauer, the theatrical version and the director's version of the film, full production notes, behind the scenes footage, trailers, and everything else that this film deserves.  All in all, Blade Runner is a sci-fi classic, but if you want to buy I would wait a while for it to be re-released.
B00009RGBS|5.0|I was unsure how much I loved this movie until i came on here and read all the knucle-draggers condemning it.<br />Make no mistake. Chicago is a work of art. And not unlike most works of art, it is beyond the comprehension and enjoyment of most of simpletons among us. If Forest Gump is your idea of the way the world really works, then you will HATE Chicago.<br />Chicago is rough, brutal and unflinching in it's cynacism. It is also brilliant and enjoyable beyond imagination. It is mesmerizing. If you have a brain in your head and are unafraid to see the world and society and humanity for what they all really are. Then you will LOVE this movie. The music, the characters, and above all the songs -- All of it are simply outstanding.<br />Only grown-ups can enjoy this type of film, and sadly, there are very few of those in are society today.
B0000AM6K2|5.0|After twenty listens, and this record deserves them and much more, &quot;1972&quot; reveals a masterpiece. Who could expect that with a concept about a musical period that could have become nothing but kitsch? It's definitely not. This is just Mister Josh Rouse paying a subtle, nice tribute to the year of his birth and a musical period he always especially liked as a fan of music as you and me. And this doesn't keep him from offering a perfect collection of songs - all of them being excellent. First, Brad Jones' arrangements are superb, not to speak of Josh's personal delivery, that never was better (hear how he leads the vocals on &quot;Come Back&quot; to the end!). Secondly, it's his most immediately pleasant and enjoyable record by a mile. The three previous ones were more moody. This one is mostly upbeat and sunny. And the few melancholic tunes are too beautiful to be skipped: &quot;Flight Attendant&quot; (a jewel) and &quot;Sparrows Over Birmingham&quot; - intimate vocals at which Josh excells, ballads that remind of Wilco (Rouse and Tweedy are close in style). I bet this record will be Josh Rouse's best-seller, and may even be a best seller in the years to come. Yes, a breakthrough, as we say. <BR>On this edition, a DVD that lasts near 30 minutes, plus the &quot;Love Vibration&quot; video. While you're at it, you should purchase the single as well, as it has two great B-sides not included on the album (&quot;Princess On The Porch&quot; and &quot;Knights Of Loneliness&quot;). Caps off.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|Thirteenth Step is one of those rare sophomore albums that manages to step away from a band's debut and take hold on a new sound. With their second album, APC has taken a step away from its melodic core with the departure of two original members. However, in the process of gaining two new influences, the band has lost much of its musical soul. <BR>Paz Lenchantin's departure has robbed the band of its delicate, vulnerable femininity. Songs like \\"3 Libras,\\" \\"Brea,\\" and \\"Orestes\\" from Mer de Noms have been left behind for the new, heavy sound of \\"Pet,\\" \\"Weak and Powerless,\\" and \\"The Outsider.\\" The only fragments of the original soul can be found in the haunting ballad \\"Noose\\" and the album ender \\"Gravity.\\" \\"Noose\\" is a masterpiece of the new line up, expanding on the sound of Mer de Noms and gently adding the heaviness of Thirteenth Step. \\"Gravity\\" is a leftover from the old line-up; beautfiul but unfortunately sounding like a throw-away track left off Mer de Noms. <BR>With the line-up change, APC has become entirely male, causing the band to become beefy and heavy. Paz has been replaced by the loud dull bassist from Marilyn Manson, Jeordie \\"Twiggy Ramirez\\" White. Her violins have been pre-empted for synthesizers and generic guitar. This is a huge leap toward the masculinity of Mer de Noms' first single, \\"Judith,\\" a generic formulaic pothole in the flow of Mer de Noms. <BR> Songs with the potential to be peaceful art rock masterpieces are weighted down by droning guitars and heavy bass that are more painful than pleasurable. In \\"Pet,\\" even singer Maynard James Keenan, of Tool fame, has changed left behind his beautiful crooning and leaned toward ravaging Tool styling. <BR>This leaves much to be desired from the songs on this new album. Though obviously musically lacking, even the lyrics of this new CD have taken a step down. Once haunting, the lyrics have become more obscure than though-provoking. Deep lyrics should inspire thought, but lyrics like \\"someone feed the monkey while I dig in search of China, white as Dracula as I approach the bottom\\" from \\"Weak and Powerless\\" are more silly than entertaining.<BR>In addition, the album is reminiscent of Mer de Noms in that it has a sudden change with an out-of-place track. In place of Judith, this album has \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me,\\" a cover of a Failure track. This song has some of the most laughable metaphors even included in a song. Instead of being drawn into the echoes of Maynards vocals, a listener is going to fall backwards giggling at the line \\"Say hello to the apples on the ground. They were once in your eyes but you sneezed them out while sleeping.\\" <BR>Though it clocks in at 50 minutes, this album feels exceptionally short due to the disappointing lack of ballads. APC is heading in the wrong direction. Instead of moving toward an enhancement of the ambience of Mer de Noms, APC is taking a strong step toward a mainstream bastardized version of Tool.
B0000AMJED|3.0|I would have to say the glamour and glory of this film was great, flashy cars, fast women, drugs, money, etc.  Besides Paul Walker, the rest of the cast was 2 lack of acting and screen friendly.  Should have knitted a sweater instead of watching the movie
B0000AMJED|5.0|this movie is definitely a must! the first was definitely one was the best films ever!, and with all the many hot actors/actress' this films kick @$$. I love it! I like this movie so good that I actually bought the same car as Brian has in the movie...the Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution 2003. There are so many cool cars and the plot is good. There is one part where Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and Roman Pierce (Tyrese) are trying to escape from the police and they go into a garage...before you know it thousands of cars flee from the 20 door garage! It is definitely one of the most thought out movies. You might thinks its a guy flick considering the hot girls and cars, but my friends dig Paul Walker and Tyrese. Did i mension that Ludacris and Eva Mendes are in it to. Well ludacris doesn't race, although, he is definitely TIGHT! The first movie was great, although, it gets boring once you watch it about 20 times, believe me. This movie definitely doesn't. The many cars, the setting, and the coloring are amazing. I see a lot of movies! I'm talking a lot. I see probably 9 out of 10 movies playing in theatres every time one comes out. I am telling you whoever is a Fast and the Furious fan will love this, and if u havent seen the first see it and then watch this one! its awesome! When this came into theatres on June 6th, 2003 and its now October 1st, 2003, I went right from school with two of my friends and saw it. I get out at 2:10 and i saw a 2:45 show. Believe it or not the theatre was still packed at 2:45 with school kids and everything. Iv'e only been to a couple of movies besides star wars and the lord of the rings where people clapped, they certainly clapped straight through this one, and to you ladies Tyrese rips his shirt off, just for a little change of heart which i can't believe somebody would have anything to say bad against this film anyway. Director: John Singleton has true talent. This movie is a must. 5 STARS! 10 OUT OF 10! TWO THUMBS UP! FIRES ON ALL CYLINDERS!! BUY IT TODAY!! 2 FAST 2 FURIOUS 2 DAY!!!
B00000JCOV|3.0|I was told to listen to this album by a friend. I'm a fan of Slipknot,but I'm not a big fan (and pretty much never have intentions on being one) and expected this EP to be horrible. Horrrible as in Avril Lavigne. Horrible as in TRL stereotypes trying to mosh at a concert. Horrible as in watching Kathy Bates getting naked in \\"About Schmidt\\".<BR> Instead, it was just bad. You know...bad as in hearing your parents make whoopie in thier bedroom while you were trying to sleep. Bad as in hearing your uncle trying to sing \\"Loving You\\" by Minnie Ripperton in the shower. Bad as in pulling up your brother's Instant Mesasage screen only to find that he had been having cyber-sex with some girl that lives in Pummis,Montana. I, unlike most of the reviewers that have negative reviews on this album, LISTENED TO IT and had this to say about it: <BR>  The beginning was good...not too shabby. but then \\"Eyeless\\" came on. I didn't like this, nor did I like \\"Spit It Out\\", \\"Me Inside\\" , \\"Liberate\\", \\"No Life\\", and \\"Dilluted\\". \\"Only One\\", sounds alot like \\"No Life\\" but had more depth to it. The one's I didn't name are pretty okay. If you're a big Slipknot fanatic, I recommend it. Otherwise, I don't. Peace!
B000002MZ6|5.0|An immensely talented musician, Mike Oldfield could arrange just about any composition from plainchant to hiphop (well, maybe not THAT extreme) and make it his own. It's music that will be played and played and played. Thank goodness for CDs that don't wear out.<br />By the way, The Songs of Distant Earth is the title of a story by Arthur C. Clarke, hence the science fictional coloring of this collection from Oldfield.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I don't usually get into these types of movies, I wasn't allowed to play dungeons and dragons as a child.  But let me tell you, after seeing the first one, I was in great anticipation for seeing the second one.  I didn't want it to end! I am on the edge of my seat waiting for the 3rd one to release.
B00008NRI9|5.0|This is a great movie with Hugh Grant and Sandra bullock. Sandra Bullock roll in this movie is yet another great roll. Her acting skills are superb as is Hugh Grant. In this movie I found the lead comedy roll was played by hugh Grant more so than Bullock. <BR> Many have written poor reviews about this movie but I say watch it and then write your review. <BR> Anyone who watches this movie will find the both Grant and Bullock plays a great roll in this simple story
B000005JA8|5.0|this cd is genius crazy hilarious. if you don't like it try britney spears or take a philosophy of fine art class. if you do like it try AMM for incredible underground avant-garde SOUND (read about them on allmusic.com, never met a real person who has heard of them), or karlheinz stockhausen or iannis xenakis for electronic avant-garde classical. my recommendations do not sound like trout mask replica but are beautiful and way out.
B00005B534|5.0|Some of you came here for reviews, but see &quot;Stratovarius meets Dream Theater.  nuff said&quot; and wanna laugh.  I'm here to help.  <br />Mabye I've only had the CD for 8 days, but sounding like Symphony X, it's easy to pick out how Adagio sounds.  Also, they sound quite like a particular element of Rhapsody, but I can't put my finger on it right now...  As I said before, they sound like Symphony X.  Well, combine that with... let's call it 80% Symphony X, 20% Rhapsody.  This should get you close to what you'll hear on Sanctus Ignis.  <br />Somewhere I got the impression that this band is more hard rock-ish than metal.  WRONG!  Imagine a heavier Symphony X with better, less obvious keyboards.  There aren't any abnormal sounds - just the regualar atmoshphericness the keyboards create.  The biggest problem I have with this CD is the bass on the last song.  It blisters my ears and makes them bleed!  Do you have Amon Amarth's CD &quot;Versus the World&quot;?  On the bonus disk's last 5 or so songs, the bass sounds like this.  A better way to describe it would be to say an older death metal bass sound.  That might be hard to understand for melodic metal fans.  Well, sorry, I can't think of any better way to describe it.  <br />Again, I've had this CD barely more than a week and have only listened to it twice, but I can tell you a bit about how good some of the songs are.  First of all, there aren't many lyrics - there are I think 3 entirely instrumental songs on here.  Track 5 is an 11:40 minute epic - pretty long, huh?  Like many other great epics, it changes speed a lot.  You should get into it if you like Stratovarius's epics, and even Avantasia's &quot;The Tower&quot;.  Back to the opener... it's not an intro.  Track 1 is over 6 minutes and has one of the coolest keyboard beats I've ever heard around the 1 minute mark.  That should definetely draw you into the album - dying to hear more.  The only other thing I can remember is that the epic is followed by a 4 minute instrumental song.  <br />Also, Limb Music Products includes the band's founder's life story with music.  I found that wonderfully interesting to read.  So overall, if you're deciding to buy this album, check out Odessey (by Symphony X) and think about what you think of some of the epics you have heard.  Then, tell me if my review helped you or not - other people want to know.  THEN, after that, check out my other reviews.  <br />You know, right now, I'm listening to the closer on Episode, by Stratovarius.  &quot;Night Time Eclipse&quot; is short for an epic, but displays all the characteristics for an epic you should need to be aware of to know what Sanctus Ignis's epic sounds like.
B00000K3G8|5.0|To the reviewers who pointed out that these aren't the same performances as seen in the movie:<BR>Those ARE the same ones, they just used different edits of the songs. In fact, 5(!) \\"versions\\"of \\"Stop Making Sense\\" do exist:<br />- The Vinyl-Version (9 Tracks)<br />- First CD-Version: same 9 tracks, but some songs have longer edits, most noticeable on \\"Girlfriend is better\\" and \\"Swamp\\"<br />- New expanded CD-Version (16 tracks): For total confusion, some of the songs which appeared on the original CD are different (longer) edits again, but differ also from the movie-version!<br />- Movie-Version (16 Tracks): This is the cinema-version, which is identically to the DVD-version. Some tracks (for example \\"Crosseyed and Painless\\", \\"Take Me To The River\\") are longer than on the expanded CD)<br />- VHS-Version (19 Tracks): Contains three bonus tracks (\\"Big Business / I Zimbra\\", \\"Cities\\"), which were integrated in the original movie. These appear on the DVD as Bonus-tracks, not as part of the movie, which is correct, because they DO NOT belong to the movie (which does not mean that they aren't great too...). The other tracks are the same versions as the original ones however.<br />The true fan of course needs all these different versions, \\"Stop Making Sense\\" is really THAT good!!!
B000003TAR|5.0|Most Nirvana fans and critics say Nevermind was Nirvanas best disc, but for me In Utero is tops. From begining to end this cd is strong.  A more raw and rougher listen than Nevermind, not as radio friendly. I love the opening line \\"Teenage angst has paid off well, now Im bored and old\\".  I think, and I have no way of knowing, that Kurt Cobain wanted to make a unaccessable lp to distance them from the \\"pop\\" music senne. In doing so, I feel he made a great rock and roll album. Its great in spite of its self. Still, its kind of hard to listen to without feeling some sadness for how his life ended. Also, for purely selfish reasons, its can be hard not to think of how much more great music he could have made if he hadnt died. Dispite all that, I love this lp.
B000002UAR|5.0|Interesting that this one has topped all those &quot;greatest ever polls&quot; that have come out in the last 5 years or so... it does rank with the top masterpieces of all time,thats a fact that can not be disputed. A must have!!!
0156027321|5.0|A completely unbelievable story that is so believable I Googled it halfway through to find out more about Pi...  An incredible read!  Every person I have loaned my copy to has also said it is one of the best books they have ever read.  Martel is a true genius.  And the ending...  well, don't want to spoil anything, but the book changes from a charming well written story, to an incredible metaphor with a blockbuster ending that leaves you breathless!
B00003CXTG|1.0|In addition to the historical military inaccuracies which have already been mentioned in detail on these pages, I would add the unfortunate stereotyping of Japan's military leaders as a major negative. Indeed, we are at a time in history where such silly cardboard cut-outs are no longer necessary - if they ever were - in trying to portray the psychological truths that plunged the U.S. and Japan into war with each other. <br />The director was apparently lazy or just stupid. The idiotic rendering of Japanese and things Japanese in this movie dismisses it from serious consideration as a thing of value or merit.<br />It's trash.
0805047905|3.0|I understand that Brown Bear, Brown Bear is a classic, much-loved board book, and I fully expected my daughter to love it as well.  I had a copy of it waiting for her on her shelf when I brought her home, and I tried reading it to her numerous times between her first and second birthdays.  However, she has simply never been very interested in it. She seems to get bored by the repetitiveness of the text, and usually just wants to skip to the last page where all the participating animals (and teacher) are identified.  I have tried introducing her to other Eric Carle books as well, and she has responded to all of them in this same way (in contrast, she loves Dr. Seuss, Baby Einstein, Mem Fox, and Boynton board books).  At 24 months, she is now into picture books like Olivia and Corduroy, so I think that our copy of Brown Bear, Brown Bear is destined for charity.  It is a good reminder to me that not all classic books are equally loved by all children, and it may be worth ascertaining what your own child likes before making a purchase.
B000056ULS|5.0|This is one of the CDs which you can play from start to end. Pleasure for your ears and yourself! Music &amp; lyrics are both very much to satisfy your aesthetics, but you probably know this all already. Infact, the purpose of writing this review is not-to-repeat what every one have already said.<BR>Just want to mention/warn about the content in CDs, especially if you are buying it because it is enhanced with video and other pictorial contents. A word of caution, the videos included are in QuickTime format and nearly impossible to play full screen. So unless you are a die-hard fan of dido and you want this one anyways, go for it otherwise buy the regular version.<BR>and yeah, i forgot to mention the five stars! :-)
0060507772|5.0|I won't detail the plot, too many others do that better than I, but I will say this book is just as wonderfully conceived and written as the rest.  The drawings really make the book special, esp. the &quot;portraits&quot; of the Silver Hoard.  I have gotten several people into the Discworld series just because the cover artwork is so intriguing, they have to pick the book up and see more.<br />Pratchett and Kidby are definetly at the top of their form here, it's a great buy.
0141301104|4.0|This book was wonderfully constructed & thought out and later<BR>became one of my favorite movies, starring Angelica Houston as<BR>the Grand High Witch and she plays it like no one else could! If you can't get ahold of a copy of this book, rent the movie!!!! <BR>Both are fun, a little scary and an outrageous romp. Enjoy!
B000000WG4|5.0|really amazingly cool and scary also collages of guitars,piano and other instruments.this one along with &quot;Ommadawn&quot; and &quot;Hergest ridge&quot; makes a real trilogy of albums that descrie the bst all the rush and tempo of modern world
B000089RVR|5.0|Great lyrics, beautiful voice and an emotional performing style. I wore out &quot;No Angel&quot; and I am sure I will wear this one out as well.  Life for Rent, White Flag, This Land is Mine,and See you When you Are Forty are my personal favorites, but there isn't a bad song on the CD.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I read through all these reviews and i c that its been reviewed 526 times. its got an average of 4.26. I think this says it all. <BR>Despite Paz's departure, they havent become any harder. Infact, i think theyve gone mellower. their songs now are exetremely well thought out. Much thanks to maynard for that, since his work in tool is exceptional as well. His voice has always been his selling point. When i heard Mer De Noms, I felt they cudnt do any better. I was wrong. So wrong. I listen to 'weak and powerless', 'noose' and 'vanishing' and suddenly im in limbo. Its been a long time since i was this emotionally affected by something so powerful. Like a fellow reviewer said, its so tragic and yet, so hopeful....
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Fragile yet bold, an intense dreamscape into blurred human consciousness.    APC's sophomore masterpiece effortlessly weaves sickly overdriven guitars with delicate vocal harmonies,  and ghostly off-axis drum beats, thank largely to the production work of Lohner and Howerdel.<BR>The album somehow maintains a rawness and primal intensity yet the production work is almost flawless and smooth.   It's like a glass marble, shattered on one side: you can see your reflection in its smoothness or cut your wrist on the rough edges.    In a way, the entire album is a seamless single song, complete as a whole on non-stop repeat in the cd tray.   There is a beginning and an end to each track but somehow they blur together creating an alter-reality which sets the scene for the intense and vulnerable storytelling of front-man Maynard Keenan.   <br />I love the dynamics of this album, from the subtle soft whispers of \\"go back to sleep\\" to the bone-crunching twisted riff of Pet, this is music the way it was meant to be heard.   It lulls you into unconsciousness only to shatter you back through the looking-glass.    Sometimes you can feel Maynard breathing in the room with you as you listen.    If you're a true artist you won't be able to put it down.    Thank you APC.
B00005R2IS|3.0|from when i heard of it i thought it was going to be a good movie but instead i find a medokre movie. there are some pluses the action is cool but also ther are those horrible close ups of the eyes
B000067J1H|5.0|It was dissapointment all the mixed reviews this film got on its release. I think it was a victim of its own marketing actually. A lot of goombahs expected a movie about guys scrapping it out Van Damme style and then were disspointed that it was actually about screwing with people's perceptions of power and glory rather than power and glory itself. Ed Norton is perfect as a suit and tie guy who just gets sick of his mindless consumerism. He meets Tyler, played to perfection by Brad Pitt, who inspires him to take his life into his own hands and they begin exorcizing their own demons through cathartic underground fight clubs. Soon, they spawn a revolution...from there the movie begings its mind-play with the viewer. Freedom, loyalty, courage, anarchy, obsessiveness...all are explored here in their most extreme forms. I must say that Pitt was perfectly cast as the ego to Norton's id. Who doesn't wish they had the perfect appeal that Pitt embodies? You'll see what I mean after watching the flick. And be prepared to view it again and again. An underrated gem whose cult only grows bigger as the years go on.
0440237688|5.0|I found a copy of this book last night in some of my mother's teaching supplies.  (She taught gifted and talented 5th grade for many years.)  On a whim, I opened it and began reading.  70 minutes later, I was in the exact same position I started in, in tears and completely stunned.  I devoured this book in a little more than an hour and immediately gave it to my ten-year-old daughter.  I told her it was excellent and I thought she would enjoy it.  She began it immediately and is probably reading it in class right now when she's supposed to be doing her work.  I have no words to describe this amazing work.  Lois Lowry never fails to touch me deeply!
B00003CX5P|1.0|This is a review of Star Wars 1: The Computer Animated Menace. The computer graphics used in this film looked really phony, and I think the special effects from the old Star Wars films are far better. Not only that the acting and script writing was a lot better back then. The big pod race scene looked like an effort to plug his pod race video game. Not only that what about Jar Jar Binx? Lucas stop trying to be cute and use the force for Petes sake!
B000000W5B|3.0|Wow. I just can't believe this album came after Exile! I guess it kind of makes sense. This album effectively ushered in the 70's version of the Stones- a band that just didn't seem to care ver much anymore. There's a reason why they called their 70's hits collection &quot;Sucking in the 70's&quot;. <br />Just like &quot;Some Girls&quot; and &quot;I Know It's Only R&amp;R&quot;, this album has some ok moments but overall it's pretty boring. The kind of spark that ignited &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; was gone, and the band was just kind of treading water.
B000002AVF|1.0|This album Dream was made back before Mariah Carrey decided to divulge to the world that she's actually a natural blond. A year or so later when I first laid eyes on that lustrous, soft, blond hair I had to a pinch myself to see if I was dreaming. I think this album foreshadows the phenomenon that a lot of fans like myself were going to be experiencing in the future. I took off four stars because she has black hair on this album so she's not keeping it real and everyone knows what a bad mix phoniness and R&B is.
B00005JLTN|5.0|Don't listen to the bad reviews perhaps they missed nascar or wrestling when they went to see reloaded thats why they are so angry.<BR>This is a true action film is the kind f action film you wont forget anytime soon a look at the box office if you don't believe me look around it was the second blockbuster of the year<BR>umm is like star wars we all knew what was going to happen but we saw it anyways because its been a cult phenomenon. <BR>well perhaps we know what should happen in reloaded but lets face it Reloaded is the action film of the year and here is why:<BR>Great script [although a couple\\"I don't know\\" lines annoyed me] but is just because they don't wanna give anything away for the next movie like neo can now destroy machines in the real world.<BR>Like 10000 special effects.<BR>The best fight Neo and the Agents<BR>Really cool new characters like the twins<BR>you find new stuff you missed. Every time it gets better, you'll see it again and again<BR>Okay First i have to say that the matrix is a great trilogy that defines the end of the 90's and the beginning of this new century. Just like terminator and the cheesy horror films defined the 80's.<BR>What makes this series so unbelievable great is the message the philosophical matter, is like reading Virgil or homer, it challenges you imagination in finding out what is it really, what is the meaning the message behind the story and why so many people relate?.<BR>Like the people who wrote bad reviews don't know but is just like buffy somewhat teen therapy same with matrix it has meaning behind somewhat spiritual if you don't believe me ask those guys who banned the movie for religious themes. <br /> This a very smart movie, the vocabulary is just eloquent and elegant. This like the first  matrix something you haven't seen before, it can't get any better than that people!.<BR> Like when neo meets the architect of the matrix, great piece of modern literature that was the ticket to coolsville for me lol:P, <BR>Thefirst matrix is the self discovery of the hero, matrix reloaded is about to trying to find the purpose behind being the one with loads of actions and tons of catch phrases. Perhaps this one lack a bit of mystery but it comes full force, and set the tone for revolutions.<BR>And just seeing MR smith and his awesome lines, just the greatest villain ever!<BR>The special effects are breath taking and really just get bet better after every scene, after the first scene when neo fights the upgraded agents you know is going to be a great movie. So go get it now and discover why millions of people have seen this excellent movie
B00008S2VG|1.0|Madonna, like a gaseous form, is good at change. And like some gas she stinks. Every week she's changing the way she looks, so she lingers around in headlines and tabloids but we should take notice that one place she isn't is all the music charts. Unfortunately if it weren't for the name 'Madonna' half the crap she comes out with would be found in bargain bins. She isn't consistent enought to come out with a hit record. I thought she was going to try to take shots at the Bush administration with this album, but after what happened to the Dixie Chicks she pulled back. I do see a lot of potential for her in the children book business though.
B00007E8V4|5.0|I loved this album due to the fact that this album had a different sound than other rock bands out there. They come up with different lyrics that no one has ever heard before, and a totally different sound. This has the best of likes of Toxicity which kicked ass! The best song has to be my personal A.D.D. which stands for American Dream Denied for you who dont know what that stands for out there.<BR> The rest of the album is good, and there are some more gems out there that would catch your ear, so get this, and if you are a huge SOAD fan, get this album.
B00005OM4N|1.0|Britney Spears is living proof that sex sells because outside of those blonde locks, and silicone implants there really isn't any talent. Let's face it this isn't someone that's going to get deep and heavy about E=MC^2 any time soon. Most of what she has going for her is superficial, or prefabricated by either her management or her high paid handlers. Hopefully her next album 'Zone' will have a song or two that hints at her relationship with her ex-Justin Timberflake. If not 'Zone' could have a hole in it bigger than the ozone.
B00001U03Q|4.0|Throughout the Years The Legend of clapton has been deeply forgotten from all the hypnor ythms produced by mainstream pop. now-a-days People would rather a justin timberlake backed by hundreds of producers then real musicians. Clapton Chronicles is for those of us who despise our current era in Music and Appreciate The sole honesty Of songs like &quot;Tears In heaven&quot; a soulful song that Clapton wrote for his late child that died in the early 90's. That song alone is probably worth all the money! cause it will guarente a tear in your eye. And the Unplugged Rendition of Layla a soft mellow Track! that has historicle boundaries. This is not your ordinary eric clapton! its soft mellow and takes maturity to listen too. So before you bash it &quot;take a look into yourself&quot;<BR>yours truly the prince of pop.
B000068QY7|5.0|I really have enjoyed owning Heathen Chemistry. It's a return back to the glory days of Oasis.<br />The album has songs penned by every member of the band, but Noel is still the man with songs like Force of Nature, Stop Crying Your Heart Out, She is Love, and Little by Little.<br />Force of Nature is an awesome song. The guitar is checky. Noel also sings this song. I think he has great vocals and I give him the edge over Liam. It's really one of Oasis's all time best songs.<br />Stop Crying your Heart is a beautiful song. I love the Piano in it. The vocals are great and it has a nice mix to it. It's a great love song and I've seen many a girls cry to it.<br />She is Love is another great song. It's a great acoustic set.<br />Little by Little is another great song. It shows somewhat of a spirtual side to Oasis. It's catchy and a powerful ballad.<br />Heathen Chemistry is a must for any Oasis fan. I'd reccommend it to any one trying to decide if they like Oasis. They are one of the top bands in the world and this album proves it.
B0000029LG|5.0|Ok this is the Most successful double disc album. in Other words the thriller of double albums! ANd verrrrrry underated! you need to give this C.D. a chance!<BR>the First C.D a perfect Compilation of his Number one hits! the C.D. that Everyone Loves. Then theirs the Second disc which is full of hate and turmoil. I love this side of michael but lost of people can't appreciate it cause their use to soft and sappy michael! this shows michaels most innermost thoughts With ther hairraising Scream a duet with sister janet! and the musical and lyrical &quot;The don't Care about us&quot;  which states jackson as a victim of racism and blackmail (molestation charges) cause of the color well former color of his skin! And the impeccably smooth Stranger and moscow shows jackson's genuis and a loophole through jacksons haunting yet fascinating life. i wouldnt trade lives with him his life is a sad story <BR>but this is a great album just give it a chance buy it! <BR>you'll like it!
B000002BBY|5.0|What's the Story(Morning Glory) is a musical masterpiece. Oasis has put out a rarity where you will actually want to listen to each song. It contains some powerhouse hits like Wonderwall, Don't Look Back in Anger, and Champagne SuperNova. <br />All songs were written by Noel Gallagher. He shows talent and diversity in his writing. He shows a little bit of his insides in Cast No Shadow. It's a wonderful song.<br />I just can't say enough about this album. This is a must own for any rock fan. Sample the songs and buy this CD. I garuntee you won't regret it.
B00005QGAT|4.0|What can i say about Off the Wall? The title speaks for itself the album is incredibal. Especially the Remastered version with the bonus Material. The first time i heard this C.D i was simply Blown away from the tracks. For your viewing Pleasure i will give this C.D a proper Review!<br />Don't Stop Till you get enough - LEGACY Is the word to describe this song! Michael's Falsetto is perfect and the quasi-disco/pop beat Screams HIStory. you can play this in a club everybody still grooves to it!<br />Rock With You - Depite the Cheap 24 dollar Video This song is legendary grooving RnB beat, Michael's range is top notch! Quincy jones does wonders!<br />Workin Day and night - GReat Work out song ! Exercising to this song is great The beats are way ahead of their time and michaels tone is wonderful!<br />Get on The floor - a Power song very Disco! not my style but really good! <br />Off the Wall - The title track to the album is a great song  one of my favorite's, a Mixture of RnB grooves with a slight Pop touch! make's you want to live off the wall!<br />GirlFriend - Great Song but personally i can live without it gets anoyying if you listen to it repetively.<br />She's Out of my life - the ultimate heartbreak song that has been covered trillions of times! this is a beautiful song , nothing fancy! you simple and Sweet!<br />I Can't Help it - Great Song! makes me tingly inside Michaels range is phenomenal!<br />Its the Falling in Love - Cheap Song with a catchy hook , but arent thos ethe best? lol<br />Burn This Disco Out - Probably the Song that killed Disco! a Mixture of RnB pop and Pure SOul Great Dance Song!<br />Justin Timberlake Wishes he made this album!<BR>Ok Dispite a few cheesy songs this is one of the best albums you'll buy! so my advice is... BUY IT! you will love it i promise afterall it is the selfstyled KING of POP!<BR>and im the Pince of funky pop PEace!
B0000B3FCX|5.0|Real full range raspy roaring vocals (no whiny whimpering into annoying no-talent screaming), real riffage (none of the predictable drop-D spam on the radio), good change up from song to song, fast-paced....<BR>I haven't purchased a CD in years.  Mostly due to the lack of musical talent out there (but also because of Kazaa and Napster).  This being the first one, it was worth ever penny.  Great workout CD, great for cruising, just a quality hard-rockin' album.  Chad's vocals soar as do the thick, heavy, catchy riffs and licks.  <BR>The only negative I could possibly muster up is I personally wish the solos were a bit longer and more involved.<BR>This album will stand the test of time.
B000002BVN|4.0|Yup michaels first attempts at doing a remix album! and it is already the best selling remix album of all time? The 5 new songs, cuts from the history album are phenomenal and then there are the remixes I must admit the only good remix on this album is the last track &quot;History&quot; the rest are cheap and very dated club mixes not my style! but what makes the C.D are tracks like the grungy morphine and the hip and groovy Superfly sister!<BR>Buy this C.D for the 5 new songs and if your into the club schene use the remixes thats my advice!
B000089RVR|4.0|While this isn't as good as her first album, she does an admirable job of combining good songwriting (examining love and relationships from different angles than usual) and a haunting atmosphere.  If you liked the first one, chances are you'll like this one as well.
B00005QGAV|4.0|I'll Make this short and sweet,<BR>Dangerous is a power album that was blinded by the 1993 molestation case.<BR>Their is really good stuff in here, I took off one star because it tends to get boring towards the end. But with power songs like &quot;JAm&quot; and &quot;Black or white&quot; what could be wrong? its a great C.D  especially with hits such as &quot;Who is it&quot; and almost the shockingly scary &quot;give into me&quot;  His Melodies are top notch with the help of teddy riley! and his Voice is better then Ever!<br />My advice is Buy this C.D and Give into Michaels Funk!
B0000AXE8I|3.0|At first, I thought I was the only that thought the movie was not that great.   <br />The whole orgy dancing seen was a waste of time and even though the fight scenes were cool, I got to a point to where I was asking \\"When is this scene gonna be over?\\"<br />The special effects on the highway were superb and the overall story at least left me wanting to see Revolutions (unlike the Star Wars).  Hopefully the next movie will bring it all together.

0684833395|4.0|I had seen the movie a couple of times, for better or worse, before reading this top-ten most important 20th century American novel.<br />While the book is more complete, I think in some ways the movie does a better job of illustrating the madness of war; &quot;Catch-22,&quot; the novel, does not rely so much on graphic depictions of blood and gore as it does on the unfairness of circumstance and the fear and pointlessness of men killing other men over the colors of their flags.  (How many German and Italian soldiers were facists at heart?  Most, I reckon, were young and impressionable and filled with fear over what would happen to them if they refused to fight.)<br />Of course, WWII was an unavoidable war, one we fought bravely and righteously -- Heller's novel doesn't openly dispute that.  What &quot;Catch-22&quot; does in a groundbreaking way, though, is point a spotlight on some of the absurd, from-the-top-down, morally questionable and out-of-public-view actions of war that lead to innocent men, women and children (on both sides of the border) suffering and of course dying.  Some of these actions -- repeatedly upping the required number of missions after the quota's been met, using military connections and materiel in the act of selling or trading black market goods for private profit, war-related corporate benefits, private goals of officers that involve men going in harm's way -- may be more associated with our conflicts in Vietnam and Iraq than WWII.<br />The only valor in this novel exists in the idea of getting out alive; after all, the enemies are not the Germans so much as the commanding officers.  Interpreted more deeply, &quot;Catch-22&quot; could be considered a comment on corporate structure and the use of men as pawns in the top-level games played by the players and power brokers of America.  (For more on that subject, see &quot;Life Askew,&quot; available at Amazon.com.)<br />The first 100 pages of &quot;Catch-22&quot; is a series of character sketches, some hilarious, some maddening -- there's a very stream-of-consciousness aspect to what little narrative structure exists. (Heller breaks so many storytelling rules and gets away with it!)  Madness, folks.  It's about madness.  The story, what there is of it, really takes shape in the second half -- the more satisfying half of the novel, more structured and less antic.<br />Like The Grapes of Wrath and 1984, Catch-22 is an important cautionary tale.  Read it if you would rather live on your feet than die on your knees.sketches, some hilarious, some maddening -- there's a very stream-of-consciousness aspect to what little narrative structure exists.

B0000DBJDL|5.0|...I lost interest in PF when they went bubblegum-mainstream pop with DSOTM-but between SAUCERFUL and OBSCURED they were pioneers who went against the flow and made some really great, creative uncompromising music.<BR>-after that they gave up, sold out, and wrote easily-digestible-by-the-masses pablum to make the big buck$$$<BR>which is why it is so funny to hear them write songs lamenting the life of being rich pop stars-they got into THAT predicament themselves...
B00005ATZT|5.0|One of the biggest box office smashes of the '90s, &quot;The Fugitive&quot; still firmly holds its ground as a thinking persons' action film, full of exciting story (based on the television show and the Alan Shepard murder case) and fine kinetic filmaking.  And who doesn't love Tommy Lee Jones (The Client, Men In Black) Harrison Ford (If you don't know one other movie he's in stop reading this review) as adversaries and seeming equals.  Plus the film boasts an up-and-coming Joe Pantoliano (of t.v.'s &quot;The Sopranos&quot; the new CBS drama &quot;The Handler&quot;) as a member of Jones' crack U.S. Marshall unit.<br />The film kicks off as Dr. Richard Kimble (Ford) is wrongly convicted of his wifes' murder, and escapes when his prison bus crashes and is destroyed by an oncoming train.  Soon on the scene is veteran U.S. Marshall Samuel Gerrard (Jones) to start his relentless hunt for Kimble.<br />What follows is an intense cat and mouse game, with Jones dogging Fords' every step and Ford risking almost certain recapture trying to clear his name.  Gifted Director Andrew Davis and his gifted team of editors and cinematographers take this premise and turn &quot;The Fugitive&quot; into a virtuostic piece of kinetic filmaking.  They stage one surprising and no holds barred chase after another, trying to top themselves at every turn and succeeding most of the time. A huge reason for this is Ford and Jones, the films' soul.  Jones won a deserved Best Supporting Actor oscar for his work playing a terrific hard-ass, and no one is better at playing sympathetic heroes than Harrison Ford, and he pulls out one of his best performances.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|i bought A Perfect Circle's album, &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;, the day it was released! most of my friends have since picked it up as well. i absolutely love the whole album, and it's hard to pick a favorite song. but so far my favorites are &quot;Weak And Powerless&quot;, &quot;The Noose&quot;, &quot;Pet&quot;, and &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot;. i think the entire album is so awesome! i was waiting for &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; to be released, and i'm glad i finally have it! i've been telling everyone that i can about A Perfect Circle's album, &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;. and i  will continue to tell people about A Perfect Circle and their album, &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;. i even promoted to the cashier, who asked me about my A Perfect Circle sticker that i was wearing, and said they had been selling their CD's all day, who were they? so, i gladly told her about A Perfect Circle and gave her some stickers!  A Perfect Circle rocks!  everytime i listen to &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;, i love it even more! i highly recommend A Perfect Circle's album, &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; to everyone who does not have it yet! do not miss out on an awesome album!
B00005NP04|5.0|It may seem too soon for a GREATEST HITS album from Martina, but the timing is perfect. Martina was an artist, that took a few albums to catch on with listeners. Now she's a powerhouse name in country music. The compilation includes 14 hits, from Wild Angels to Independance Day, Safe In The Arms of Love to I Love You, There You Are to Life #9, and more. It's the perfect album for fans, new and old, alike. There is a generous helping of new material though. The album's first single was the uptempo &quot;When God Fearin Women Get The Blues&quot;, which became a #1 smash almost immediately. This was repeated with the reflective uptempo song &quot;Blessed&quot;. &quot;Where Would You Be&quot; really pushes her vocals to the extremes, and &quot;Concrete Angel&quot; is a terribly sad song about child abuse. Overall a well rounded collection and the new songs were enough for fans to wait for her newest album MARTINA.

B000002KB8|3.0|Contrary to no few other reviews hung up here, Black Sabbath didn't invent heavy metal. (You can choose among whom to divide the honour, though the midperiod Yardbirds, the Blue Cheer of &quot;Vincebus Eruptum&quot; and &quot;Outsideinside&quot; - the latter album's &quot;Gypsy Ball,&quot; sonically, is all but a signpost to Black Sabbath's sound - and the earliest Led Zeppelin.) But they certainly tried to bring the doom, gloom, and ersatz Satanism up front and in your face. (On the other hand, if you don't think Blue Cheer was capable of delivering the goods on evil, you sure didn't listen to &quot;Doctor, Please&quot;...) Thirty-three years after their eponymous debut was let loose, the album seems too much more excess than success, though it doesn't lack for periodically engaging moments. <br />Probably the best song of the bunch is &quot;WASP/Behind The Wall of Sleep,&quot; in which for once Black Sabbath keep the B.S. down to a dull roar and just get down to playing the song, pounding the song, and keeping rein enough on guitarist Tony Iommi's early penchant for not knowing when to knock it the hell off. On the other hand, for all that were still trying in those days to out-Cream the recently-decommissioned and much-beloved Cream, few enough had the chutzpah to turn a piece of the &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot; riff into something as grungy and as downright silly as &quot;N.I.B.&quot; The only thing &quot;The Wizard&quot; really does is prove that, for Ozzy Osbourne as a harmonica player, Sonny Boy Williamson he ain't. And the next time anyone complains to you about someone else's metallic excesses of excess, just give them a gander at &quot;Warning,&quot; in which a pleasant enough blues cover (never mind that this band wouldn't really know the blues if it bit them in the sternum) is surrounded by one so-so and one unlistenably long exercise in just why it was that long, show-the-chops guitar solos (with or without accompaniment) became almost entirely discredited in musical terms for a long enough time. <br />Buy the premise, buy the album. In 1970, it sounded over the edge; in 2003, it sounds like its welcome is long worn out. OK, the title track was pretty fly for its intentions (though I think they should have kept the church chime in for the second verse, myself) and &quot;Wicked World&quot; isn't that terrible. But &quot;WASP/Behind The Wall of Sleep&quot; especially proved this band was capable of a little bit better. With just about all of &quot;Paranoid,&quot; most of &quot;Volume 4,&quot; half of &quot;Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath,&quot; and two cuts of &quot;Sabotage&quot; (especially &quot;The Thrill of It All,&quot; they delivered it.
B0000A02TZ|3.0|I hadn't actually seen Animal House all the way through until I bought this DVD.  It left me with a bit of an ambivalent feeling; there were a couple of instances of actual guffaws but ultimately it didn't sustain it for me.  I find the Blues Brothers, made in the same time frame more enjoyable.  The blame for the disaffection probably rests in the numerous spoofs, various homages, and references in other popular culture offerings to Animal House that have appeared over the years.  When the original is viewed with the heightened expectations it somehow pales a bit.  I well understand that this is considered a low-brow comedy cultural watermark film, but I couldn't make the connection required to love it.  Belushi's rousing speech at the end is masterful though. :)
B0000C7PSW|5.0|I can't wait for Want Two!! If your reading this, I'm sure you've already bought the album but if you haven't, you have to immediately! It's incredible. Can't stop listening.
B0000AR8NK|2.0|I didn't buy this C.D. I gave that up after the Hours C.D. My wife surprised me with it. I said why waste 11 dollars for lousy music. When I first heard this C.D. I said to myself why does he even bother. Well after about 2 weeks now I like 5 of 11 songs which is incredable for todays David Bowie. His 90's c.d.s were complete crap. This C.D. is his best music since the 80's Bowie not Tin &#34;Can&#34; Machine. Bowie was more creative in the 80's with better songs and this C.D. is Bowies wake up from his Lost Weekend called the 90's. I think he finnaly captures what he wanted the 90's to be in one song Fall Dogs Bomb the Moon. He has some real crap though like Bring me the Disco King and Looking for Water. I look at the late Junk 70's albumbs like Low and Heroes and compare these songs with them. I hope he can finnaly score a hit it's been so long in the US. But most likely Bowie will be at the local County Fairs soon.
B000089RVX|5.0|The minute I put this CD in I was blown away.  I had no choice but to get up and dance.  The haunting lead singer's voice goes perfectly with the lyrics, that sound like a guided tour of depression.  But even though the lyrics and singing are very very sad, the upbeat music makes it hopeful.  It is something to relate to, but not to wallow in.  My favorite song on the album, Tourniquet, makes me want to belt out the lyrics as if I was a Diva.  I have been telling all my friends about it and they are all suprised at how much they love it.
B00006690G|5.0|This record is a testament to Eminem's ingenious talent as a songwriter and an entertainer. Controversy aside, Eminem's power lies in his ability to sing about the gamut of events of his life to which so many out there relate. His daring, offensive lyrics resonate with the angry public out there. Some would argue that his words promote violence and intolerance. I believe that's nonsense for that we have enough Jerry Falwells out there taking care of that mission. As for Eminem's lyrics, they are harsh and offensive. They are also ingenious and peculiarly elegant.<br />This album is loaded with 20 extraordinarily melodic tracks. The music will get to you from the first listen as it varies from Hip Hop to Rap to R&amp;B. The mood can be haunting, angry and desperate. This is definitely a very energetic album with so much to offer from great listen to thought-provoking introspection.<br />I like every single track on this album. It's that good. I totally recommend adding it to your library, regardless of what your musical inclination might be. Whether you like, dislike, hate, or love Eminem, this album will make you at least say, \\"This guy has talent.\\" The flow of his words and the poignancy of his poetry will amaze you.
B0000C7PQK|3.0|This album is different.  I can't believe I spent 15 bucks on this cd.  Well, it's nice to hear engima again but i think it's time to go on to a new search for new enigma music out there.
B000002H6C|3.0|I jumped on the Metallica bandwagon a bit late. I admit I had never heard of  \\"Kill'em All\\", until after I heard their second album \\"Ride the Lightning\\" at a party. It had been released for a couple of months. By the time \\"Master of Puppets\\" was released, I was a full blown fan and thought these guys ruled the world. They kept it real, they hated MTV, they cared about two things, music and their fans. I got into Metallica somewhere around 1985, but abandoned them the day the `Black' album was released. It was a short lived but exciting ride.<br />\\"And Justice for All\\" was a great turning point for Metallica. Nowhere near as good as \\"Puppets\\" but not as bad as \\"Metallica\\". In hindsight, \\"AJFA\\" was the sign of things to come. Look at how much simpler the songs are on this album compared to Puppets. I always thought this album was a small misstep for a band that was still hurting after the death of Cliff Burton. Apparently, they never recovered.<br />I must say that I always found this album to be a bit on the boring side. Back when I had this on cassette, I thought side two was very repetitious \\"Shortest Straw\\", \\"Harvester of Sorrow\\" and \\"Frayed ends of Sanity\\" all seem to sound the same. \\"To live is to die\\" is unbelievably boring. When I learned that it was a song that Cliff had been working on before his death, I can't help but wonder what his vision for this song was, it could not have been this. The album ends on a high note \\"Dyers Eve\\", the fastest and most aggressive song on the album. It has dated over the years since my days of teenage rebellion and `blaming my parents for everything syndrome' are far behind me.<br />I hate to say it, but the single `One' is the greatest part of this album. Yes Metallica did what they said they would never do, the made a video. But when it first came out, we all accepted it, it was real, it was Metallica's video, on their terms. No one blamed them at the time for what they did, but like I said before, in hindsight, it was the sign of things to come. I never thought they would fall as far as they did, but that's another story.<br />Listen to this album and see it for what it is. It is the door Metallica walked through that got them to their present state. From speed metal pioneer kings to greedy old farts who worship the almighty dollar.sign of things to come.

B000089RVX|5.0|This is one of those CDs I pop in when I need to come back to life in myself.......the songs each seem to touch something in me that would actually make me say &quot;this CD has rocked my world&quot; in every sense.  I agree, there's not a single filler song on this CD - and that's a rare treat....<BR>I must be odd but I loved the cover as well!  Certainly fits with the style of music which draws you in completely.
B0000A98ZP|5.0|I was in high school when this movie came out, and like everybody else, I absolutely loved it. Of course back then I really had a huge crush on Molly Ringwald (like a lot of other guys). But almost twenty years later, well......<br />Either this movie hasn't aged well, or like Ally Sheedy said `When you grow up, your heart dies'. I just don't get the emotional connection to this film like I used too, I guess that's because I'm in my thirties now with a kid of my own. It is nostalgic to watch what life was like back in the 80's. I think almost everyone my age misses those days. The movies, the music, the fashions, everything was great. It was a great time to be a teen. This film just isn't realistic anymore, sure you still have the princesses, the jocks, the brains, the basketcases, and the criminals, but the times have changed. These days the John Bender would have physically attacked or shoot the teacher. The basketcase would be sitting at the back table listening to Marilyn Manson instead of looking at a Prince album. The Princess would probably be talking to her friends on a cell-phone. The brain would have found a way to sneak a laptop in and surf the net all day, and the jock would have probably, well I don't know, whatever it is that jocks do these days. I was always a cross between the basketcase, brain, and criminal anyway. Jocks and princesses never made it into my world. Which was the point of the whole movie anyway, breaking barriers.<br />If this was 1985 again, I'd be on Amazon saying this is a 7 star movie and was a feat of human accomplishment. But now in 2003, I have to say I can't sit through this movie again. Maybe one day if I'm feeling nostalgic and have an old girlfriend on my mind I'll pop it in, but that probably won't be for awhile. But on the other hand, I've probably watched this movie a million times already, so I must have thought it was good.<br />This is definitely a movie for teenagers who are trying to find themselves and have the whole world in front of them. They'll love it now, but twenty years from now they'll probably feel the same way about it as I do. There's a window of time in your life when you find this movie fascinating.le world in front of them. They'll love it now, but twenty years from now they'll probably feel the same way about it as I do. There's a window of time in your life when you find this movie fascinating.
B00008J4P5|1.0|Folks, I gotta tell you.  I don't see the hype and I can't understand why emo/indie rockers worship this band or why Rolling Stone gave this album 5 stars.  This album (as well as their previous three releases) is nothing but overrated, overhyped junk.  If you want really excellent minimalist musicianship, I recommend Robert Johnson's &quot;King of the Delta Blues&quot;, Johnny Cash's &quot;American IV: The Man Comes Around&quot;, Darkthrone's &quot;Transilvanian Hunger&quot; or Ulver's &quot;Nattens Madrigal&quot;.
B00006JDS4|5.0|This flick has what so many other great flicks have; nudity and blood. I think this is a great movie, perfect 70's drive-in camp if you will. Camille Keaton plays her role wonderfully. She played both the victim and the avenger perfectly.<br />This movie is most famous for it's bathroom scene when Camille kills one of her perpetrators. I also like when the idiot gets hung by his neck and gets dumped in the lake. The only complaint I would have with this movie is that while the first two kills were fabulous, the last two seemed rushed. While the first two were killed separately, the last two were killed together, I admit the ax in the back was great, but the boat motor's slicing and dicing was not that realistic. I mean who would climb into a boat on top of the motor?<br />You would almost think that this film was written and directed by a militant feminist. I mean the four men are just so dumb. Would they really expect a rape victim to suddenly come on to them and want their company? And why would the four men discuss rape, murder, and body decomposition in a tiny and crowded ice cream parlor at a volume where everyone can hear?<br />People can say what they want about this film, it's trash, it has no value, etc. But how many of the thousands of movies over the last thirty or forty years can claim the same? I believe it's the majority. This story could really happen I think, not in the exact way of course, but a story like this is entirely possible, and it wouldn't be pretty.
B000065BPB|4.0|I use these phones with my computer. I plug them straight into my soundcard (Epox 8rda+ w/Soundstorm audio) and they sound very good. Theere are only 2 negatives about these phones. One is they are a little bit tight for me. They have loosened up alot though and feel pretty good. Secondly, they needed to burn in for about 30 hours before they were acceptable. <P>Other than that, they sound great for listening to mp3's and playing games. The isolation is great also (I can't hear my girlfriend yelling at me at all)!<P>These are great for the price. Pick em up!
B00002Z88D|1.0|Newbie Metallica fans are hilarious. I mean c'mon they're nothing much more than sheep being lead around by a noose on their neck. They've never even seen a 'Metal up You're a**\\" T-shirt, let alone worn one. Oh brother.<br />Well at least Metallica didn't run any of their \\"Kill'em All\\" material through the mud on this debauchery. But that's probably only because they've forgotten how to play it. But to hear Master of Puppets, Battery, and For Whom the Bell Tolls played in this fashion is disgraceful. Only Metallisheep would spend their mommy's money on this garbage.<br />James is obviously trying much to hard to sing like Rob Zombie on this. Guess that was the flavor of the month when they came up with this hair brained scheme. Lars playing is ridiculously off-time, but they did what they could with studio overdubs. I wouldn't be a bit surprised if word came out that Lars did all his drum tracks over in the studio. Even the most die-hard Metallica fan has to admit (and I was a fan up until 1989) that Lars is a drummer of mediocre talent and was ALWAYS a wienie.<br />Thank goodness Cliff was cremated and released into San Francisco Bay. Other wise the spinning he would have been doing in his grave for the last ten years would have separated California from the rest of the country (hey maybe that's not too bad!).

0312319517|5.0|Fifty-one year old attorney Pete Dexter practices law on the Jersey-Pennsylvania line and runs triathlete events relatively successfully.  People who know him picture a quiet unassuming friendly fellow, but Pete has a second job as the AVENGER, a renowned bounty hunter, that he keeps secret from his neighbors.  Pete maintains a Manhattan apartment as his center of human hunting operations in which he answers ads in Vintage Airplane magazine asking for the AVENGER.<br />Billionaire Canadian mining mogul Steve Edmond hires the Avenger to kill Serbian Zoran Zilic, Milosevich's sadistic henchman for murdering his grandson.  Following the trail from Serbia to South America just like he did the Cong in the tunnels of Nam, the Avenger closes in on the kill.  However, the CIA does not wink this time, as they fear the consequences of this particular murder.  To avoid global chaos Agent Kevin McBride must stop the Avenger anyway he can.<br />THE AVENGER is a typical Forsyth tale in which the action-packed plot uses real world events as a backdrop to a non-stop thriller that deeply focuses on a specific incident.  The story line moves rather quickly forward as Pete begins his latest quest of vengeance for his client.  Pete is an extraordinary individual who feels his soul is clean though he is obviously a paid killer.  Kevin commiserates with Pete, but also knows orders and fears the outcome of a successful output by the Avenger.  A strong tale though no DAY OF THE JACKAL, fans of the author and anyone who appreciates a taut international thriller will enjoy THE AVENGER.<br />Harriet Klausner

B00004U8JV|2.0|If you're locked up in your home during a storm and you have nothing to do BUT watch a movie, The Lost World is the perfect choice.  But only under those circumstances. The film IS entertaining but for the wrong reasons. It was an insult to Spielberg and the original film.  Spielberg lost his creative genius and instead of making a sequel worthy of the first Jurassic Park, he went crazy and made a Godzilla remake that wasn't realistic or worthy.<br />Jeff Goldblum was as dry as a cracker, and though I love Jeff Goldblum I couldn't forgive him for such a pitiful and boring performance. Julianne Moore and Vanessa Lee Chester were the only two in the film who acted like the dinosaurs were real. There were too many wasted characters like Vince Vaughn and Pete Postlewaite ( sp? ). The plot was impossible to get into and I got the idea that Spielberg didn't even know what genre he was making the movie for.  It was supposed to be Science Fiction/Adventure but he turned The Lost World into a cheap horror flick. <br />Stephen needs to do more research on dinosaurs because nine times out of ten, a big T-Rex won't walk on a sidewalk and not fall through the earth! Nor will a ship be able to hold a T-Rex AND float along the water.<br />The movie seemed made only for money purposes and Spielberg appeared pressured and not at all enthusiastic. I bought the DVD collector's item and I could tell by the behind-the-scenes featurette alone he was bored and only made the movie to strap another big film to his belt.  For such a wonderful director, more was expected but I either laughed ( at the plot ) or cried ( at the same plot ) and still walked away not understanding why the darn thing was made in the first place.<br />The biggest disappointment for me was the lack of scenes between Ian and Kelly. The interracial relationship idea ( his marriage )was the best thing about the movie yet it wasn't explored at all. It would have been more exciting if his black wife had come along. Leastshe and Moore would have had some interesting catfights. Finally there would be one fight scene I wouldn't have fallen asleep during. Instead his daughter served no purpose but to whine &quot; Daddy! &quot; 800 times.<br />Spielberg should have gone through some history between Ian and Kelly's mother instead of the girl just popping out of nowhere. The audience is left with why she was there in the first place if it didn't bring anything else to the story. She and others were wasted.<br />Last but not least, the dinosaurs looked fake and the action between T-Rex and the cars and etc. was boring and rehearsed to death. The only exciting part was when Sarah and Kelly were stuck in the little warehouse with the dinosaurs eating their way inside.  Spielberg didn't leave anything to the imagination. Don't let me forget the terrible scene where T-Rex is storming through a neighborhood and no one wakes up!  By that time I had had it, unfortunately that was the end of the film.<br />Ask me why I watched it?  Because it was 1997 and blockbusters ruled.<br />Ask me why I bought the DVD? Because Jeff Goldblum looked hot in black jeans.<br />Yes, my reason was that shallow and yours will have to be too to buy this crap. You have to either be in love with Goldblum or have an intense obsession for dinosaurs, other than that don't waste your time.  Get 98's Godzilla if you want to see something big stumping around. At least with that you won't EXPECT a good plot.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I honestly can't understand what's not to like about this disc!  I've been a hardcore Maiden fan for 20 years, and this is easily one of their best.  Songs like &quot;Montsegur&quot; and &quot;Paschendale&quot; are instant classics that would fit comfortably in a live set with &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot;, &quot;2 Minutes to Midnight&quot;, and &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot;.  Another reviewer described this album as &quot;epic&quot;, which is dead-on.  Definitely stronger than Brave New World (which is also a strong album), this album belongs in every Iron Maiden fan's collection, period.  Kevin Shirley did a fantastic job juggling Janick, Dave, and Adrian without being over the top.  Nicko's drumming is perfect; he's just one of the most underrated drummers recording today.  Steve's bass is solid, as always, and Bruce has never sounded better.  Ironically, the only song I could do without is the first single, &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; (I simply hate it when Maiden attempts to be commercial), and Rainmaker is a bit weak as well.  The nine remaining tracks are simply killer, and are easily better than anything they've done in years.  This instantly reminded me what makes Iron Maiden one of the greatest metal bands of all time!
0767817478|2.0|Okay the film was called Godzilla. Which meant I expected to see Godzilla most of the movie instead I didn't see him but four times.  This was the most hyped movie of 1998 and one of the most disappointing. Everywhere you looked it said &quot; SIZE DOES MATTER &quot; and with Godzilla being so huge, there should have been more scenes concentrated on the beast instead of the bad actors around it.<br />The biggest mistake, casting Matthew Broderick as the star. You have blockbuster material from the crew of Independence Day yet you get someone as boring and bland as Broderick? The last hit movie I remember him in was Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Since the early 90's he hasn't done anything worth mentioning, so why would someone get him to star in this film?  Big name action figures like Wesley Snipes or Arnold S. would have helped this along but the film fizzled before it began. You have a blond woman no one knows and Hank Azaria ( a lame television actor ) to round out the cast. The movie needed more famous actors known for blockbusters. I would have preferred the older Harrison Ford to the sickening Broderick any day. Most of the characters were supporting and there were too many military shot scenes. Godzilla didn't even get a chance to roam around before the town was evacuated and we spend the next 90 minutes watching boring shooting scenes. Where's the fun in seeing Godzilla if he doesn't scare the hell out of people or stomp down buildings? The film turned from Godzilla to Attack of the Baby Godzillas. The second half of the movie was an insult to anyone with an IQ over two. Baby Godzillas chasing people around in an empty building?  Oh yeah, that's interesting...YAWN.<br />The plot was something I couldn't explain even today...because I don't know it!  The scenery was dark and drab simply to cover up the poor special effects. It rained throughout the entire film which seemed the only thing keeping me awake. I had to admit that this Godzilla monster rocked, but themovie didn't do him justice. I was hoping, praying that this movie would surpass the earnings of that sappy Titanic and become the biggest movie ever.  So much for wishful thinking.  Godzilla is a big boring mess and the only thing that will MATTER to you is when it's finally over. I suggest everyone watch it once, but anything more than that is suicide.
0316666343|5.0|The Lovely Bones is narrated by Susie, a fourteen year old girl who has been murdered.  From heaven, she describes her attack and her family and friends' attempts at dealing with her loss in such a simple, matter-of-fact way that the reader will surely melt into puddles of tears.<br />Plucky and wise Susie describes her heaven as the high school she never got to attend:  It has a good playground and chocolate cake, you only have to go inside for art class, and everyone's nice to you.  She watches over and visits her family and friends on earth often over the next ten years, as her life and death continue to affect them.<br />The author's writing style is friendly, chatty and irresistible; I couldn't put it down until I was finished.  It is a very quick read - the kind of book you wish wouldn't end.  I loved the first half and cried through it, liked the second half, and understood the ending (but selfishly wish it could have been different).<br />This is a book about a dead child, but it is not macabre; it is warm, loving, honest, and hopeful.  Those who have lost a loved one may well find comfort by reading The Lovely Bones.  I recommend it to those who enjoy insightful, well-written fiction.
0449000729|3.0|Covering 10,000 years of history in the Salisbury area of England in under 1000 pages is an ambitious undertaking.  Reading this book is as well - this is a book for someone who loves history or England or preferably both.  The story moves very well until the building of the Salisbury Cathedral in the 13th Century.  That section of the book was hideously long with far too much needless description of the stone working process unless the book were to be a study in masonry.  The story picked up well again and moved along until the late 15th Century when it was completely dragged down with actual historical political notes.  Normally, the author's inclusion of historical fact to support the fictionalized story was interesting - but he went over board around 1640!!!!!  I was also sorry to see the end of the stone figure carved 10,000 years ago.  It resurfaced several times along with other geographic observations in the area until after the building of the Cathedral - then the author dropped that entire story line perminently - very disappointing.  I had hoped that in 1988 the statue would have resurfaced again to wrap up the entire tale....no such luck.  I actually felt that the author got to the end of the tale by skipping great heaps of history and then just saying...&quot;so there - now the book is done&quot;.  Honestly - by the end - I had just that same feeling.<BR>Read this if you like to read history - NOT if you are looking for a story alone.
B0000AMRJC|3.0|I agree with Mr. Michael Coppolo's review below....the 5.1 mix is really bad on this DVD.  I feel like the company false advertised when they said DTS 5.1 because that sound mix doesn't sound any better than the old Dolby Pro Logic Surround mixes.  Its really too bad because this is a film where they could have really enhanced this DVD reissue and made it a true classic with a great soundtrack remastering job.  Its really unforturnate.<br />However, the picture quality is great, the extras are nice, and the film is a classic.  Three stars for that, but they lose two for screwing up the sound.
B000089RVR|4.0|Dido returns with &quot;Life For Rent&quot;, the follow-up to her debut album &quot;No Angel&quot;.  Similar to &quot;No Angel&quot;, some tracks on the new album I will listen to over and over while the others I will likely not listen to ever again.  White Flag (track 1) has been on the radio here for quite some time and definitely deserves a listen.  I also enjoy the title track Life For Rent (track 3), Mary's in India (track 4), See You When You're 40 (track 5), Sand In My Shoes (track 8), and the incredible album finish See The Sun (track 11).  Many of the tracks are an unlayered Dido singing over drum loops, accompanied by just keyboards and/or an acoustic guitar.  The lyrics express a lot of shared heartbreak (tracks 4 &amp; 11) and broken life expectations (track 3).  There is also a 'hidden' track.  See The Sun ends about 5:00 into track 11, and at about 7:04 another song begins.

1400031362|4.0|In his third book about the &quot;No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency&quot; Smith turns to a full blown analysis of Botswana Ethics and Morality.  He investigates such concepts as some Botswanians are liars.  Most tell the truth about most things, but there are still some things, that Botswanians will not tell about.  Some Botswanian women are beautiful and some are not.  Some Botswanian women play around, and are promiscuous, others are more chaste.  And again, certainly, Smith discusses the concept of Traditional Values in the Modern World and how they mesh, and how they do not mesh.<br />But what the reader notices, is these things that Smith showcases in his book, these values, these ethical standards, and the resulting mix, are not just Botswanian.  They are American, Swiss, Russian, Portuguese, Indian, Italian, Australian, in fact, they are the same types of moral and ethical issues that all societies wrestle with all over the world.<br />In this book, Smith deals less with detective stories and much more with ethics and human commonality.  He even tackles depression as a very common and treatable human illness.  And he comments on beauty contests, both the good and the bad.  And even with this change of focus, Smith still keeps us with those same characters, acting the same way, and shows us how they analyze ethics and morality of others in comparison to their own.  In addition, just so his characters are not superhuman, he also introduces some character faults within them as well.  This introduction of a few negatives, makes his characters much more real as human beings.  And after all, it seems, that what Smith's message is here, is that morality and ethics are woven into the fabric of everyday life, just as much as eating and sleeping.  No matter where one lives and who one interacts with, the issues of ethics and morality in dealings with others must be considered.  And if it be true, that no man is an island; then it also is true, that all men and women, mustcome to terms with some model of ethics and morality, that they can internally justify.<br />Smith has an uncanny ability to use Botswana as a microcosm of the world.  And even more so, a microcosm of the free and democratic countries of the world.  For Botswana is a free and democratic country, and they are a very proud people.  There are many such countries in the world.  And in most things, they can be compared, at least metaphorically to the microcosm of Botswana.
0788821075|4.0|Pretty Woman debuted in 1990 starring Richard Gere as Edward Lewis and Julia Roberts as Vivian Ward.  Gary Marshall directed the film and the run time is 119 minutes.  Julia Roberts earned the Academy Award for best actress in 1990 and the Golden Globe for best actress in 1991. <br /> This is one of the best romantic comedies ever made. The casting of Richard Gere and Julia Roberts in the starring roles is magnificent and their supporting cast is equally brilliant.  Edward is a cold-hearted executive in town to buy up a family owned shipping business and sell it off piece by piece. Edward and Vivian met because Edward is lost on the streets of LA driving his lawyers sports car that he really cannot drive. He stops and asks two prostitutes for directions and Vivian ends up driving him back to his hotel.  She goes up for the night and ends up staying all week. She accompanies him on many business outings and takes on an amazing transformation.  This is one of the best dream come true stories ever made and deserves to be watched repeatedly.
B00005RERU|1.0|Nothing equals the dereliction of those who transferred this masterpiece into a monstrosity.  Audio cacophony is coupled with video distortion.  Even my dog raised his leg over this DVD to show his disdain.  Caveat emptor!  This DVD deserves a ZERO!
B0000029GA|5.0|This is Definitely one of the best Hip Hop albums of all time.  This album is a classic.  Not Just because it's flawless from 1 to 10,  But because of what it did for Hip Hop.  This Album, along with WU Tang's \\"Enter The Wu\\",  and Redman's \\"Whut?\\",  Helped bring real Hip Hop back.  At a time where West Coast Rap a.k.a \\"Gangsta Rap\\" Had things on lock.  Illmatic caught back the ears of a generation,  Who was just caught up in the whole \\"Gangsta Rap\\" Era.  This album also helped set the stage for B.I.G's \\"Ready to Die\\",  Which ultimately led to the demise of \\"Gangsta Rap\\".<br />Now as far as the Album Itself.  Only a few artist's in the history of not only Hip Hop,  But Music itself.  Have ever constructed a Album where Lyric's and Production is Flawless,  and on the same Level.  This Album forced artist's to do there best work, and influenced alot of artist's as well,  and really what people never talk about,  Is that Nas with this album led a whole new generation of artist's like Jay-Z, DMX, Keith Murray etc...  But say what you will about this album.....  Whether you think its too short,  or you feel it's Overated,  You can't deny that this album has changed Hip Hop in some way,  and you can't deny that it is defintely a CLASSIC......
B0000004V2|5.0|Shove this one into the hands of anyone who dare says the music of the 80's was all Flock of Seagulls.  <br />A bunch of shaggy haired boys in Manchester managed to rewrite the rules on Brit-Pop and pave the way for the coke snorting Oasises of now.<br />It opens sinsterly enough- there's something nearly Satanic about &quot;I Wanna Be Adored&quot;, with its coiling, sexy guitar hooks and sultry command for well-earned adulation.<br />The darkness quickly gives way to lighter fare though- She Bangs the Drums, Sugar Spun Sister, and This is the One seem joyous to the point of revelry, meshing pysch, dance, and utter-pop wonder into a crystaline finished product.<br />It almost seems to good to be true at times.  The music is so sharp and catchy, that one could easily see it falling into the hands of a producer with visions of the Backstreet Boys dancing in his brain, but there's none of that over-worked schmaltz here.<BR>The Stone Roses is polished with rough edges and so enjoyable, so effortless in it's grace, it seems like impossible that an album could carry this much street cred and still make you smile and sing along.<br />Perfect.
1400031362|5.0|Mma Ramotswe has now surely become one of the most loved characters in recent fiction, as utterly delightful as is the author himself. This book is every bit as good as the other two - and American fans should know that there are several more to appear in the USA! This is an enchanting tale and perhaps one of the most utterly charming and delightful antidotes to the wicked world outside that one could possibly imagine. Buy 20 copies for Christmas for all your friends and see McCall Smith's fabulous creations all hit the top 100 in Amazon!

6305280762|5.0|Oh, boy... they sure as hell don't make 'em like this anymore!<br />&quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; is a nearly 3 hour epic that keeps you glued from the sweeping opening credits to the heart-stopping finale. Although some elements may seem dated (what was with the 70's and orange carpeting?), the grand daddy of all disaster flicks still holds it's place proudly as one of the greatest action films of all-time. <BR>The combination of a phenomenal cast (especially Fred Astaire), a gripping soap-opera screenplay, the beautiful San Francisco setting, one of John Williams' best scores, outstanding cinematography and editing, and dazzling special effects make this a timeless classic. It's a wonderful memory of a time when Hollywood used to pull out all the stops and make a film that gives the audience a truly worthwhile experience. <br />You can keep your &quot;XXX&quot; and &quot;Matrix&quot;, but THIS is entertainment!
1400031354|5.0|This does not merely live up to the first int the series - it is even better, as McCall Smith's writing skills have clearly improved even more. (It also lacks the terrible misprints that the British first edition of his first book had in profusion). So why not do more than enjoy this book  but buy 10 copies for friends at Thanksgiving and 10 more at Christmas and see all these splendid books, set in Botswana, on the bestseller list. They are all a joy and McCall Smith is truly a national treasure. Christopher Catherwood, author of CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (Zondervan, 2003)
B000089RVR|4.0|While lacking the range and intensity of &quot;No Angel&quot;, &quot;Life for Rent&quot; is still a solid effort.  Dido's vocals are as smooth as ever and the album has a more personal feel to it.  Best tracks are &quot;White Flag&quot;, &quot;Life for Rent&quot;, and &quot;See the Sun&quot;
B00009V7T2|5.0|Ok, I don't rate albums very often but this is so good that I have to express it a little.<br />I bought this CD for 2 reasons 1: I was a fan of At the Drive-in, not a huge fan, they weren't my favorite band or anything but I liked them enough to buy a few of there CD's; however, I still probably would not have bought this CD unless: reason 2: I was walking in the Power Zone (a military CD store in Europe) and they had De-Loused in the Comatorium in the new release section. I was amazed because they usually only have stuff like Linkin Park and Back Street Boys. And what was even more amazing was the fact that it was only $7.94 so I bought it.<br />I have been listening to this CD now for 2 months and it is still in my CD player, which is amazing, and every time I listen to it I like it better.  I have to admit it did take a few spins before I really got into it but after two months of constantly listening to The Mars Volta I have to say that this is the best CD I have bought in the last 10 years.
B0000C8AVM|5.0|I'm 25 years old and I love this album. It shouldn't make sense that someone not born when it was released should take such immense pleasure out of it, but every time I hear &quot;Shelter From The Storm&quot;, I'm taken to a warm place I don't visit often. I'm nearly nostalgic for it. Please also see &quot;Freewheelin' Bob Dylan&quot; for music to make you want to hug yourself. Dylan may not be at John Mayer's level quite yet, as a young(er) reviewer asserts, but there's definitely something to this Dylan kid.
1400034779|2.0|I give the author points for character development - the heroine is so human with all the good and bad that goes along with that but the plot is painfully slow!  Precious is clearly a 3 dimensional character as are the people she meets throughout her journey but I found myself thinking &quot;do something - anything to move this story forward!&quot;  In all, the book failed to hold my attention and I found it rather boring.
B00005YU1O|5.0|Buy this DVD, and watch it one or two chapters at a time.  I say this only because the dialogue can get really tedious, and sometimes it seems to be trying to hard to be profound.  The good thing about that is I find a new interesting thought every time I watch the movie.  Also, the animation is quite beautiful, but the constant undulating shapes can get to you after a while.

0316776963|3.0|David Sedaris is a funny man. But he's not the &quot;funniest man in America&quot; as he has often been billed during his recent speaking tour. <BR>&quot;Me Talk Pretty One Day&quot; is humorous, but not &quot;laugh-out-loud funny.&quot; <BR>The majority of problems are with the stories dealing with his family. His family members are indeed quirky, but the stories he tells are you-had-to-be-there stories. I think my siblings and parents are hilarious too, but I'm humble enough to realize that anyone who didn't grow up in our household does not find our childhood anecdotes nearly as amusing as those of us who were there. <BR>This book improves during part &quot;deux,&quot; wherein Sedaris sticks for the most part to describing his experiences as an American living in France. It is in these stories/essays that Sedaris's true gift shines through: he has quite a talent for pointing out the absurd in society. Yet, entertaining as they were, not even these stories are ones I would consider &quot;laugh-out-loud funny.&quot; I suppose I would have liked this book better had the blurbs from reviews featured on the cover not oversold Sedaris's comedic talents.<BR>All in all, this book is entertaining when Sedaris is shining a light on society's foibles. When he turns that light on himself and his own neuroses, things begin to wear thin; and when he begins to speak of his family, the book is unremarkable at best, and, more often than not, completely unentertaining. <BR>Again, I probably would have liked it better had my expectations not been set so high.<br />&quot;River Teeth&quot; by David James Duncan is in this same vein, but much, much better.<BR>If you just want to laugh, anything by Dave Barry is sure to hit the spot.

0812550706|5.0|I've read a lot of books, and many of them would easily warrant a 5 star rating on here, but I NEVER read the same book twice.  The only exception I can possibly think of to this is Ender's Game.  I read it twice in ONE WEEK. The first time through took only two days, and only about three days for the second reading.  It was THAT compelling.  <BR>After reading it just struck me as a book for the intelligent, and the reviews here seem to clearly support this notion.  Many of the positive reviewers &quot;identify&quot; with the story, and most of the negative reviews are written about very superficial characteristics of the book (&quot;What's up with having all these little kids trained for some war?&quot;  &quot;Why were the kids naked so much&quot;?).  <BR>The most impressive aspect of the story is the style of writing, which flows so easily but can be extraordinarily vivid.  And the psychological aspects are so engaging... I have never read anything so alive in the mind.
B000089RVR|5.0|Than do yourself a favor and listen to this! Dido's second album has personally been a long time coming for me. Her radio hit \\"Here With Me\\" didn't really catch on until a year after 'No Angel' was released. The show Rosewell pretty much launched her career but I've been a fan since her debut was first released close to 3 years ago so it's a breath of fresh air to hear the new material found on 'Life For Rent'. This CD took a while to grow on me but I'm hardly disappointed. At this present moment I can't really say I like this more than her previous work but I find myself enjoying this on a deeper level every chance I get to press play and have a feeling I eventually will. This sounds less commercial and more original. She seems to have found her niche and all has been improved. The inclusion of  orchestral strings adds a nice touch to songs like \\"White Flag\\" and \\"See The Sun\\" and I love her exploration for electronica on \\"Stoned\\". You can also hear traces of Faithless on tracks like \\"Who Makes You Feel\\" and \\"Sand In My Shoes\\", which should come as no surprise since a couple members from that group contribute to this album, including her brother, Rollo Armstrong. \\"Do You Have a Little Time\\", \\"This Land Is Mine\\" and \\"Don't Leave Home\\" are my very favorites though. Her gorgeous voice is always clear in pronunciation and she never strains herself. Instead she sings naturally and lets the emotions flow out of her. Screaming at the top of your lungs is not the key element to being a good, talented artist and Dido is the perfect example of that.

It's really extremely stupid.<br />The caveat to this is clearly that children of age 3-6 may find it really good, and for this purpose the movie is probably good. So I am adding for that an extra star (otherwise it would be zero)
B00006RAKP|3.0|I spent most of my life hating Elton John because I hate his over-produced, over-dramatic, Celine-Dionish 90s stuff, and The Lion King gives me hives (not that there's anything wrong with writing a Disney soundtrack). That's all I ever heard from him until recently. <BR>Even so, when a friend of mine mentioned buying this CD and liking it, I decided to come here and see if I can learn more about the songs on it from other customers' reviews. Needless to say, reading the customer reviews, I learned more about the songs that WEREN'T on it. And for that, I thank you all. Long story short, in the past 4 months, I ended up buying everything from Empty Sky to Blue Moves (with the exception of Caribou, which I just don't like overall), and have come to the conclusion that this compilation just isn't good enough. Some of Elton John's best stuff is *criminally* obscure, but what are you gonna do? His 70s albums, and a handful of 80s songs, are absolutely brilliant. I love his piano playing, I love his melodiousness, and above all, I love his interpreting skills (ie: his emotiveness, and his knack for making crappy lyrics sound good). My advice (which no one will listen to but I'll give it anyway) is to start somewhere at Madman Across the Water or Honky Chateau, and slowly check out his other early albums. This CD will immediately seem like not enough music.
B00004Z459|5.0|Linkin Park truly beholds the long awaited and much needed revolution in sound. The first album, &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot;, craftfully mixes hip hop, metal, electronic, and rock to create the style which defines Linkin Park. The other amazing qualities which set this album apart from any other CD that I have owned is how seamlessly the sounds meld from song to song, and yet, how each song sounds completley different, but they still contain the elements that make this an astounding musical experience. While &quot;Crawling&quot; and &quot;Papercut&quot; were popular tracks that were on the radio, the other 12 songs in &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; are just as intense and impressive. My favorite songs include ..<BR>1. Papercut (7/10)<BR>2. With You (10/10) this is one of my absolute favorites - Chester's voice sounds amazing with the contradicting softer notes at points in the song <BR>3. Points of Authority (9/10)the words and the end of this song definatley make a vivid impression on the listener - this song also sounds great in &quot;Reanimation&quot; (definatley listen to its remix!)<BR>4. Crawling (8/10)<BR>5. Runaway (7/10)<BR>6. By Myself (8/10)<BR>7. In The End (9/10)<BR>8. A Place For My Head (8/10)<BR>9. Session (8/10) - even though the majority of this track doesnt contain any lyrics, the songs instruments amazingly evolve throughout its 2 minutes. i typically skip songs like this, but the instruments create such an impression that there is no need for lyrics.<BR>10. Pushing Me Away (10/10) - this is my favorite song on this CD - the words are beautiful and the music creativley and artfully accompanies the sound that Linkin Park strives for.<BR>&quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; is such a refreshing sound in music - it is hard to define what style they are, which is one of the reasons why they are so popular. The talented musicans in this group have succeeded in making a revolutionary sound which will definatley blow the listener away. Definatley buy this CD!
B00005OM4N|4.0|Many would consider Britney Spears a pure sex-pop seller, but this album is good crafted pop tunes, nothing more, nothing less, as almost every album release, this collection includes timeless classic(I'm A Slave 4 U), great unfairly judge songs(Overprotected, Boys, Lonely, Cinderella, Bombastic Love), fillers (Let Me Be, That's Were You Take Me), bubble gummy songs (Anticipating), junkie covers (I LOve Rock N Roll) and bad songs (I'm NOt A Girl Not Yet A Woman) sounnd like 'nsync on &quot;What's It's Like To Be Me&quot;, this album is great to listen too, it's easy pop that you need in a daily day basis, great buy!. Check Mandy Moore's self titled album better than this one.
B000069HK2|5.0|&quot;The Used&quot; is one of the most amazing CD's that any band has ever first put out. The CD contains a large range in styles of songs, yet still retains the image, outlook and style that the members of this band are trying to portray. The songs styles range from metal to ballads to hard rock, but each one still retains their image of expressing the romantic, social and even mental struggles that people deal with. My favorite songs from this album include ....<br />1. The Taste of Ink - this is the first song that was debuted on the radio - while this is the reason why i purchased this album in the first place and it is an excellent song, but it really doesnt do the album justice<BR>2. Poetic Tragedy - instrumentally rich with powerful lyrics<BR>3. Buried Myself Alive - this is a great song - definatley pay attention to its lyrics <BR>4. Blue &amp; Yellow - Blue and Yellow is my absolute favorite song on the album - while it is a little softer than the rest of the songs, the lyrics flow along seamlessly with the rest of well preformed guitar and drums <BR>&quot;And you would have never thought in the end how amazing it feels to live again its a feeling that you cannot miss it burns a hole through everyone that feels it - shouldve said something but ive said it enough by the way my words were faded rather waste some time with you&quot;<BR>10. Noise &amp; Kisses - great song that portrays the hardships that a person faces when in a relationship in which they care more than the other does <br />This is definatley the album to add if you are adding to your music library or just want to download some music that is different than the rest of the crap on the radio. A must buy in my book -- indescribable!
B000002MUW|5.0|When I first got this cd back in 1995, I thought that maybe it wasn't that good, but now that years has pass by I realize all the songs in this cd are great, it's one of those cd that you don't skip almost any of the songs.  The blend of mid-90's R&amp;B and pure POP gave Madonna a small breathe of peace between all the sexualy oriented scandals around her.  The opening &quot;Survival&quot; it is the most tastefully popish song of the hole album including &quot;Don't Stop&quot; too, they have that upbeat feeling with positive lyrics, &quot;Secret&quot; the most intimate moment of Madonna, search for the trueness in yourself, &quot;Take A Bow&quot; wow! this song blow me away, it's one of the only few songs that Babyface wrote that I truly like, this was Babyface peek years with this and some Braxton's joints, for Madonna's &quot;Take A Bow&quot; was the longest running #1 of her career, holding to that spot 7 weeks, &quot;Human Nature&quot; she's not sorry!, how could she be!, she's the queen of controversy!, great R&amp;B-Hip Hop-Pop fution, the video was one of the best coreography by her, &quot;Bedtime Story&quot;, well a little of Bjork in Madonna wouldn't hurt, this mystic track, was a preambule of what to expect from &quot;Ray Of Light&quot; sadly it floped on the charts but gave us one of Madonna's most innovative interpretations and a great oddly looking video, &quot;Sanctuary&quot; this song creates a good vibe ambient, &quot;Inside Of Me&quot; this song is so sweetly, and so easy to go along with it, &quot;Love Tried To Welcome Me&quot; wow!, one of my fav from this album, bittersweet lyrics, and killing instrumentation, great slow jam, &quot;I'd Rather Be Your Lover&quot; if I have to choose the song that I mostly dislike, this should be the one, I don't know why?, but I just don't get this one,  &quot;Forbidden Love&quot; explains all that you feel, when you love somebody that you just can't, great lyrics and production by music genious David Foster, inoverall this album should satisfy your appetite for mid 90's pop, and great urge for love cd's, so elusive this times.  This album surely have the secret of great love songs with enough clasiness and good taste.
B000089RVR|3.0|I was struck by the beauty of Dido's voice when No Angel came out..I loved the beats that complimented her singing so wonderfully. I rushed out to buy Life for Rent expecting more of the same. I didn't get what I wanted.<BR>While not a horrible album, it's just okay. Nothing stands out, nothing repeats in my head once I've turned it off. I would definitely use it for background music, though. It is beautiful and mellow - very subtle all the way through.<BR>However, I was looking for more.
B000002N3J|5.0|This album was one of the most difficult for me to buy!, cuz I was a teenager and didn't have money for it!, so waited until xmas to get it!, and what a pleasent delight this album is!, I have cherish Madonna's career since my sister bought me &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot;, and this was a great complement, better than &quot;GHV2&quot;, this compilation came by the years when Mariah Carey and The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles(Boyz II Men) where hot, I hated that song of them so much, that this come as a relief, &quot; I Want You&quot; a cover of Marvin Gaye is a song that puts you in the mood with any of the two versions included here and what a video Madonna made for this!, &quot;I'll Remember&quot; I don't like the beginning of the song, it's to fast!, but the rest of the song is a timeless classic, &quot;Take A Bow&quot; oh! what to say about this, I love it, &quot;You'll See&quot; the obvious part II of &quot;Take...&quot;, this song as stand up for yourself song, one of Madonna's best song why I didn't went to #1?, #6(if you must know),&quot;Crazy For You&quot; longer version that the one included in the Immaculate Collection. This is a classic Love Song of the 80's, simple, no complications.  &quot;This Used To Be My Playground&quot; it's the first time available in a Madonna's album, takes you back in time, great tune, &quot;Live To Tell&quot; toooo long but great message, &quot;Love Don't Live Here Anymore&quot; so sad that the supreme version from Soulpower didn't make the collection, this remixed version on the compilation is so wrong, no good.  &quot;Something To Remember&quot; great title for the album, but this song was kind of a filler, &quot;Forbidden Love&quot; one of the best tracks on &quot;Bedtime..&quot;, of course the song is refering to imposible love ones, &quot;One More Chance&quot; Madonna's attempt to acustical territories, but sounded just like another filler, &quot;Rain&quot; wash away your worries, this song explain the difficultyof love, great song that why it didn't went to #1, well, because it came from the infamously unfairly judge &quot;Erotica&quot; album, &quot;Oh Father&quot; this is not a love song!, by bye baby!, well of course, this song tries to tale the story of anyones relationship with his or her father, great melancolic tune, forgettin' the few slumps in this album that are few, this compilation is worth buying it, because captures all the human feeling in the art of love, enough said.
B00009W0U4|5.0|If you ever wanted to watch a man's face get smashed in, in the most<BR>realistically possible way possible in a film?<br />Now here's your chance?<br />\\"Irreversible\\" directed Gaspar Noe. (French)<br />I would place Irreversible on the same level as \\"Funny Games\\" and<BR>\\"Confessions of a Serial Killer\\".<br />Irreversible is a seriously [messed] up film, but does not exploit the<BR>violence.<br />Without fail, you must watch this film, (by yourself, not with one of your<BR>fiancées, girlfriends, mothers, dates or grandmas!!!!!!)<br />Read my review below: (after you have watched it!)<br />First of all I want to thank my friend Tom, for recommending Gaspar Noe's<BR>Irreversible. This was truly a stunning film in all aspects from the story,<BR>to the visuals and much credit goes to actors for their incredible work. All<BR>credit goes to Noe for his inventive and innovative vision. Some might<BR>complain that the story structure is similar to Momento because of it's<BR>reverse stoy line but to compare Irreversible to Momento would an insult.<BR>Momento was clever where as Noe's film was dare I say, is on a genius level.<BR>This is a director who understands film and has rewritten film to his own<BR>language. The whole dizzying, spinning camera work through out the film was<BR>his language to create even more tension and anxiety rather than just to<BR>show off visually.<br />Momento is soda pop!<br />Irreversible is art.<br />The violence and the rape scene looked all too real, and that was the point,<BR>not too pretty eh folks?<br />Probably the most tense beginning I have ever seen in a film and what a<BR>soundtrack, that thumping beat went in sync with my erratic heartbeat!<br />(I loved the extras, the music extras on the dvd, \\"Outrage\\" is my<BR>favourite.) <br />A dangerous film because we could identify with the main character's sense<BR>of rage and wanting to act on revenge, but also a moral film because there<BR>are choices in the way we act and the consequences of it. I saw the ending<br />(beginning) as how life could be and should be.....such as enjoying peace at<BR>a nearby park or reading a damn good book as an alternative to violence in<BR>life.<br />Heavy with the \\"tunnel\\" symbolism, perhaps representing, life, the mind and<BR>the human anatomy?<br />Well, all I can say was \\"WOW!\\"<br />I look forward to Noe's future cinematic visions
B00004ST9Q|1.0|Whitney has a great voice, but when it comes to music videos, she should get some advice from Paula Abdul(genious video maker), her videos simply sux.
0780631684|4.0|Well, what do we have here? A horror movie that really delivers the scares. Looks like the filmmakers took one look at the mess of slasher films of the past 20-30 years and said, enough already, we'll come up with something different.<br />And they did. The story is intriguing, to say the least: six students and one teacher cheat death by getting off a plane before it takes off. Sure enough, it promptly explodes. But you see, death doesn't take too kindly to being cheated. So he goes after the seven, taking them in the order they would have gone if they had stayed on the plane. The deaths are as bizarrely creative and freaky as they come. They have to be, to drive home the point that the grim reaper himself is really after these seven. <br />Strangely, with each addition to the body count, we react with amusement almost as much as terror. Admit it, you did chuckle at these ridiculously low-probability accidents. And that's just the reaction this movie wants to elicit. This is not the jump-out-of-your-seat, screaming-good-time type of film. It's more in the way of oh-my-God-look-at-the-way-that-poor-sucker-got-done-in fun. The producers planted their tongues firmly in their cheeks and said, let's all have a gruesome good time with this. So they did. And they succeeded where few others have succeeded before: they struck that delicate balance between terror and humor. <br />That's what makes Final Destination so much fun. It can be terrifying, but in the end, it's really just a joke. A morbid one, sure, but a joke just the same. And when we're done laughing, we can smile and say, hey, that's one cool movie. And then go about our merry little lives.
B0000028P8|5.0|I have only few words to say about this album, &quot;It's one of the most beautiful albums and concert release by MTV Unplugged&quot;, it's so delightfully good, a classic, some of the live versions are way more better than the originals specially &quot;Someday&quot;. Buy It, Great.
B0000AI44Q|4.0|Some solid music from a performer who had been on a bit of a creative dip.  \\"Greendale\\" is a huge step in the right direction.  Neil Young tells a story that meanders along through different scenarios, often without a clear cohesive point; he even admits in the liner notes that he doesn't know where it's going. But the lack of cohesiveness actually works to this album's advantage.  I'd describe a little about the story, but it would be too easy to give too much away, so I won't risk spoiling it.  After the characters have been introduced, the story goes anywhere it needs to in order to create some great music and some fascinating and often insightful commentaries on the media, the government, etc.    More importantly, there is some great music on here.  \\"Bandit\\", \\"Carmichael\\", \\"Grandpa's Interview\\", \\"Sun Green\\", and \\"Be the Rain\\" all come to mind, but there really aren't any notable weak points in the album.
B00005Y228|5.0|Buy This, the sensuality of Kylie and the well crafted songs, makes this album one of the best I have ever bought, none of the tracks are skippeable, all are good. 1) More, More, More, that's just what I need more Kylie! great smooth dance track, &quot;....give it up give it up I just can't get enough!&quot; 2) Love At First Site, isn't this what music should sound like, this is my favorite track, if you can get the import version of Australia or Latin America that includes the &quot;ruff &amp; jam us radio mic&quot; get it!, both versions are supreme!, 3) Can't Get You Out of my head, a now total dance classic, could not see anyone who doesn't know the  lalalalala part, great pure art!, 4) Fever, wow! the lyrics of this song!, whoo hooo!, 5) Give It To Me, upbeat, and wonderful ending!, 6) Fragile, bittersweetly dance beat, smoothly goin' song, great message, 7) Come Into My World, why didn't this got to the #1 spot in the USA, I dunno know?, this is the peak of ecstasy!, such a pleasure to listen to this!, 8) In Your Eyes: second single in the whole world except the USA, this song explain simply what you feel when you are craving for someone, 9) Dancefloor, dance, dance, dance!, 10) Love Affair &quot;...I am over you for a little while....&quot; how to express better when you cheat on someone, great beats! 11) Your Love, this is wow!, how high a love you have can take you!, 12) Burninp Up, the end! how can I explain this song to you, it goes from slow to fast, to slow to ecstasy so nice!, this album is certainly worth it and a classic buy it now, you won't regret it, unless you are a fan of John Mayer :(
B00007AJIT|5.0|I want to be John Malkovich and this movie is killer fun. Spike Jonze is the man and by far a great up and coming director/actor(he was in Three Kings with George Clooney and later in 2002 he made Adaptation with Nicolas Cage). Cusack is great as Schwartz, the man who finds out theres a door leading into Malkovich's brain. Diaz is crazy as Cusack's pet obsessed wife who wants Malkovich's body to have sex with Catherine Keener's charcter. There's a lot of great moments including when John Malkovich goes inside his owen brain. loved it a lot
B00006CXXU|4.0|This is an eclectic album, so many tastes and sounds, it doesn't really stick to a formula, and that's why it stands out between all the lately bad music release. It's sounds like Christina wanted to release an intimate album, because that is how this sounds, nothing near to her debut album, is pure respectful tracks, with great lyrics and meanings to them.  There are so many tracks that review each and everyone of them should be to much writing and to exhausting for you to read so, in conclution, the best tracks are (Beautiful, Fighter, Infatuation, Cruz), the most upbeat danceable (Can't Hold Us Down &amp; Dirrty), the most intimate (It's OK, Keep On Singin' My Song), worst tracks 4 my taste (Impossible, Make Over), this album is a great pop survenoir buy it!.
0385504209|2.0|The book has a clever premise, but it is predictable (I figured out almost every &quot;surprise&quot; before it was revealed, and if I can do it, it must not be very surprising)and not that well written.  How many times in one book can you interrupt the revelation of an important piece of information for the sake of &quot;suspense&quot;?  It got routine and boring after a while.  Also, the characters were flat - you never really got to know who they were, but then again, I never really cared, either.
B00005Q66T|1.0|This Greatest Hits doesn't stand close to the &quot;Classic&quot; title that &quot;Immaculate Collection&quot; stands for, many essential tracks where left out, mainly ballads, if the point of not including them was because they were available in &quot;Something To Remember&quot;, well just not included &quot;Take A Bow&quot; as well, but they did?, so how come?, why this collection didn't click?, well maybe because all Madonna's 90's albums were &quot;Concept Album&quot; one album very different from the other, with different styles and dynamics. So the songs feel kind of out of their original place. The only good thing about this, is that the marketing people from Warner, placed all the radio edit of the songs, thx, because &quot;Frozen&quot; was way too long.  If You don't own any of the 90's albums of Madonna, this maybe will help you, but if you do skip this one.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Overall, I really enjoyed The Matrix: Reloaded.  It felt like watching a movie version of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series.  While the movie itself failed to live up to expectations in some places (the tribal dance scene and Keanu's \\"I just love you too damn much,\\" are good examples), the complex mix of cultures and mythology comes off pretty well.<br />I don't think that it is as obvious to most movie watchers, though.  Most of the people I went with left confused and/or disappointed.  Only in talking about the movie in context to the greater body of art out there did they begin to find it enjoyable.  It's definitely a different kind of movie.
0451147960|1.0|I love Follett books, but this is his weakest effort.  The characters are not well developed and none are endearing.  You don't find yourself pulling for or against anyone and I could care less about having a beer with any of the characters.  The plot is far fetched and the ending is worse. Pick any other Follett book and you will be better off.
0812932293|5.0|This book is a must for any dreamer. It is an honest presentation of the wonderful life of Richard Branson. Even his mistakes are revealed. It makes you think that all it takes is a dream and a small loan to make it.
B000089RVR|5.0|Dido did it again with her inmediate success 'Life For Rent'- the follow up to her smash album 'No Angel' featuring the hit single &quot;white flag&quot; plus &quot;don't leave home&quot;, &quot;life for rent&quot; &amp; &quot;sand in my shoes&quot;. An album that show us that there's still great music out there. This album really fits on the describition of &quot;beautiful music&quot;, cos it really is beautiful; from the single 'white flag' to the hidden track 'closer'. Dido keeps her basic instincs but goes one step up, with more mature lyrics and just amazing melodies.<BR>'Life For Rent' takes us in a journey through life, love, and devotion. Dido writes like nobody does, she tells us stories, like sweet poems in song which we can all indetify with. 'Life For Rent' it's definetly a must-buy for any music fans. You'll be surprise of what Dido is capable of doing.
0876852630|4.0|This is the one, folks.  Read this book before you shave your privates with a box cutter.  The rundown:  Go out, get a job, get fired, get drunk, get with the town tramp, play the horses, go out, get a job, get fired, get with the town tramp, play the horses, etc. etc.  &quot;Factotum&quot; is lots of fun for those who get a kick out of reading about bad behavior.  Softies, go read something else.
B000066NW0|5.0|I think Avril is absolutely an amazing singer and composer.  I love &quot;Losing Grip&quot;, &quot;Why&quot;, and &quot;Nothing But Ordinary&quot;.
B00000IPAX|4.0|The name says it all. The song's topics are about a girl who doesnt wear underwear and a guy named Bob who humped a dog. The melodies are catchy and scream the name pop punk. Its extremely fun to listen to and shows you can enjoy it anyday, even though you've had it in your collection for 3 years.<br />WHY YOU SHOULD BUY IT<BR>-You like sex jokes.<BR>-You want somthing funny to listen to. <BR>-The songs \\"Whats My Age Again and \\"Wendy Clear\\"<BR>-Good replay value<br />WHY YOU SHOULD LEAVE IT ON THE SHELF<BR>-You dont like swearing and the use of the word \\"penis\\"<BR>-Your postitive your parents will burn it if they find out you bought it.<BR>-All the songs kinda sound the same.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|MATRIX RELOADED, what can you say.<BR>It is definately a good \\"sequel\\". The story begins in the MATRIX with introductions, themes and motifs. The story of the series continues in the MATRIX RELOADED and the dilemma or climax is introduced. The charactors develop and you learn about the final conflict.<BR>Over-all I enjoyed the movie.<br />I have no complaints about the plot, it develops nicely into the next movie and the final conflict. It thankfully ends where the story seems to pause before the final climax and does not have one of those cliff-hanger ends.<br />The charactors for the most part were well developed and excellent. Although Neo and Trinity (and sometimes Morpheus) seem very superficial and distant. Almost like idealized caracatures. There is not intimacy or personal developement in their relationship to the audience. The supporting charactor were much more developed, even for the short time that they were on screen. (i.e. the Oracle, Seraph, Link)<br />Unfortunately, I didn't really like the extremely long scenes that seemed to last hours and hours. For example, the scene were Neo fights  the hundreds of \\"Agent\\" Smith-s was way too long. Not to mention Neo was CGI-ed for the most part. I mean it's nice to have these visual and imaginative fight scene, but a director should never get so carried away that he looses his audience. That is key NEVER LOOSE YOUR AUDIENCE. The Zion dance scene could also use some editting. <BR>At anyrate, it makes for a good restroom or popcorn break(s).<br />The script was ok, no different from the first movie. (A little cheesy but I've experienced worse.)<br />An Overall 3. An enjoyable movie, that is ALMOST destroyed by its short comings.<br />And yeah... I'll get a copy for Christmas.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I can't get over this album. Huge Neil fan. Always will be. I love it!
0767853636|5.0|I was born the year after the movie was released, and have been watching the film repeatedly since I had the patience to sit through an entire movie. In fact, I have worn out five copies of the VHS versions. This is an excellent movie for all little girls and is a great gift for birthdays and holidays. I highly recommend all children see this version of Annie, it's more realistic than the 1999 tv production remake.
B000089RVR|3.0|There are a couple songs worth listening to but I feel that there is a lack of lyrical development in the rest and the mix leaves alot to be desired.  I enjoyed See the Sun and Life for Rent but would not listen to this album over and over again.
B00009NH5W|5.0|This  CD is simply AMAZING!  ALMOST EVERY SINGLE SONG ON THIS C.D. IS A CLASSIC imho!!!  Terence's voice is so versatile and soulful and I truly enjoy and listen to this album frequently. This is creative, authentic, soul music and I am impressed with his voice and song writing ability. Wildcard is not super-popular because T.T.D. left the world of major labels moved to Italy and became a self producing true artist. I think that if more people heard this music then they might realize how fantastic he is. Buy Wildcard and Listen Heart Deep In Awe.
B00006ZCFH|2.0|This is an array of songs but the hip hop seems trite and the background music too passe in the rest of the CD.  The vocals are interesting to listen to once but just don't draw me in.  I read a review on this an was drawn here.  I don't hear what they did.
B0000C7PQK|2.0|There are only 3 songs that I kinda liked. From East to West, Page of Cups, and Following the Sun. This could have been so much better. I agree with trying a new formula, but this one comes short. It seems as if it was just thrown together compared to previous albums (material wise). However, I was totally impressed with the overall mixing and production. There just seem to be NO more magic left for this cd. Buy it and try it for yourself, you can always sell it if you don't like it.
B000009CEM|5.0|Alot of people complain about the slight change that Fear Factory did in 1998 with their Obsolete album. True, it is more experimental than Demanufacture but FF is an extremely progressive band. Soul of a New Machine was straight hardcore death metal, and then they made the transition from that to the more industrial-metal driven Demanufacture. Obsolete is more of a continuation from that album. Songs like the opener &quot;Shock&quot; and the brutal &quot;Edgecruser&quot; lay down the line for this brilliant concept album based upon Man vs. Machine. The liner notes that go along with the lyrics in the booklet (all written by Singer Burton C. Bell) is simply brilliant. Even the more melodic songs like &quot;Descent&quot; and &quot;Resurrection&quot;, which fades into the gloomy closer &quot;Timelessness&quot;, which show off Bell's true vocal abilities becoming instant classics. As always guitar work is good even though Dino Cazeras wasn't really THAT impressive of a guitarist. All the guitars are wrapped around the killer drum beats on most songs, a trademark FF sound. Along with Bell, drummer Raymond Herra shines through as always on this cd, and they are in my opinion the most talented in FF. But if you are new to them I would highly suggest either this or Demanufacture. Digimortal was good but just doesn't do them enough justice as this cd does.
B00008DDSC|5.0|Beautifully designed movie, every scene incredibly crafted. Unbelievably amazing colors and cool relationship...
B00000I8BX|5.0|For the rest of the album read my previous review. This is in regards to the bonus tracks. It kicks off with an awful version of Gary Numan's &quot;Cars&quot; mainly because they didn't change it too much and Numan still sings on it...kinda pretentious I think. The rest of this is just brilliance, mainly from earlier recordings (songs like Concreto and Soulwound etc.) but what really grabs me is their cover of Wisebloods &quot;Where Evil Dwells&quot; Great death metal song so be sure to check it out. The various b-sides that adorn this digipak are some of FF's heaviest, like the closer &quot;Messiah&quot; which is one of my favorite FF songs of all time. So just go out and buy this album and I promise you'll love it.
B00003CWLF|5.0|Everytime I watch this movie, I'm awestruck at the beauty and wonder of it. From the scenery, to the drama, to the love story, and finally and most of all, to the music, I'm drawn to watch it over and over again. So much of the dialogue between the King and Anna points to moments in my life that makes me want to return to the time and place over and over.  I loved &quot;The King and I&quot; with Deborah Kerr and Yul Brenner, but this story is so much richer without all the music and allows you to see into the souls of each character.  This story is for all of us who ever had to give up the true love of our lives.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|i think any one who likes tool or slow to fasssst moving songs should like this cd.
B0000B1OE7|5.0|I just bought and viewed this 10th anniversary edition and all I can say is..wow! The picture has never looked better, the 6.1 DTS has never sounded better. I've seen this movie countless times and they found a way to make me enjoy it even more than I had thought possible. The slipcase is also very smart looking and comes with a couple of neat little extras...I should also mention the extras on the dvd itself are pretty nifty too.<BR>                 This is the movie that made me a big anime fan and still ranks as one of my all time favorites. If you enjoy martial arts action and adventure, I implore you to buy this dvd...you won't be dissapointed.
0385335482|1.0|Being a fan of the &quot;Bridget Jones&quot; genre of books, I decided to pick this book up after a friend recommended it.  The first few chapters were interesting enough, but then the main character and her inability to control herself began to wear on my nerves.  It's not a good sign when I have to put a book down because I find myself getting physically annoyed while reading it.  I enjoyed books by authors like Helen Fielding and Jennifer Wiener because the give depth and intelligence to their characters.  I don't think the idea of someone who places value only in material possessions - (ie shopping) makes for a character worth reading .  This character is the reason why people stereotype women as flaky, shallow, and stupid, and frankly, I'm dissapointed in the book's author.  Also, the romance was pretty unbelievable.  I tried to see how this guy would find this woman interesting , but most of the men I know would just patronize her and act interested, without really being so.  I definitely won't be reading the other books and I definitely won't be recommending this book to anyone else.
044022165X|4.0|Though it was a bit slow in the beginning, in the end, I enjoyed every minute of it.  Like many of Grisham's novel's there's always something more behind it. <br />What disappointed me about the rain maker, is what disappoints me about most Grisham novels, especially this one; The protaganist (Rudy Baylor) always ends up in the same way most characters do. <br />It's a wonderful read though and I would highly recommend it.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|great album.for me its the album of the year.....but the new iced earth record has not come out yet so i dont know.theres no real filler on here.and have thought about it and if maiden had released this album back in the 80's everybody would of like it and if they just now released the album number of beast or the seventh son  in 2003  everyody would be giving out bad reviews.anytime a band comes out with new album its just instant bad reviews.its just years later do people start telling the truth saying\\"ive changed  my mind it instant classic\\".also i recommend fantomas :delerium corda,macabre:murder metal,the new iced earth record,ween:quebec,anything by devin townsend,and morbid angel:hertic(not a classic but good)
B000089RVR|5.0|I don't buy much music these days because the general crop of recordings is so underwhelming.  But when I heard &quot;White Flag&quot; on the radio a few weeks ago I was hooked by the sound.  I eagerly anticipated the release of &quot;Life for Rent&quot; if only for that song.  After having this CD for a couple of days now I can only say I'm blown away.  All the tracks here are enjoyable, but I especially love &quot;White Flag,&quot; &quot;Life for Rent,&quot; &quot;Dont' leave home,&quot; &quot;This land is mine,&quot; and &quot;See the sun.&quot;  Dido has a knack for really emotional lyrics.  I hope this one goes straight to number 1.
B00005JL3A|1.0|Why did Paul Anderson have to turn the Resident Evil series into a piece of garbage. The video game series was perfectly good but he had to write his own story to start the movie series. Are there lasers that come out of walls in the game? No. Can you kick, punch, and break the necks of zombies? No.(why would breaking the neck of a zombie kill it anyway?) Is there stupid techno music in the game? No. So why is it in the movie? The games had perfect atmosphere for a great horror movie but Paul Anderson had to change all that and put his own stupid ideas in. Why couldn't George A. Romero's scrypt be taken. He would have made such a great Resident Evil movie that was faithfull to the game.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|This is a review for all of you who think the plot line for reloaded and the character development was below par. If anybody who actually knows about the original concept by the Wachowski brothers they would know that the matrix was a huge concept for one 10 hour film. The first film in the series was approximately only 1/5 of the entire script. The character development and plot lines were decided on years ago when the brothers developed the script. To say that the characters have become like Shakespear and very monotone was anticipated more than five years ago. The plot line and the concept of Zion is was also decided long ago, this is the vision of the Wachowski brothers and if you dont like dont watch it.
B000089RVR|4.0|Life for Rent delivers just what you would expect.  12 songs (yes, there are 12, the bonus track is about 7 min into the 11th song) that are easy on the ears.  Would recommend if you liked her last album (No Angel).  Not sure there are many breakout hits on the recording (other than White Flag), just a solid album.
B00008S2VG|5.0|With her simple lyrics and what has become her new trademark sound, Madonna has pulled of the most compelling and brilliant piece of work that has ever tackled pop culture. She has made statements her entire career and once again proved that she is a woman who will always have something to say. The world evolves and Madonna always seems to be able to incorporate modern day phenomena into her art. In this case she has recognized that people will go to any lengths to reach for the American Dream even if it means exploiting themselves on a reality show for example. With this album she has addressed that money, fame and fortune are not keys to happiness, contrary to popular belief. This is a woman who represents the American Dream and irony in it's purist form. The material girl says that money and materialisic possesions do not make one happy? Who better to make that statement than her! She reflects on  her journey to stardom and faces what drove her all those years. Her main goal was to be accepted and loved and went to any means necessary to get noticed (i.e SEX). Although she has no regrets of her career moves, and has made fantastic statements along the way, she realizes that although she may have established some form of accomplishment, she realizes that her root to acceptance was a pain staking process that she could have avoided if only she had learned to love herself earlier on. The album is a deep and close look into one of the most recognizable figures in history. Although the album focuses on the accomplishments and lessons learned from it's creator, it is far from self indulgent, because this is truly an album that anyone can relate to. It made me look at who I am VS. who I was. The album is a lesson to anyone who listens to it. It takes it's focus on negative experience and turns it into a positive and refreshing look at what really matters. It is incredibly uplifting and fast paced, and, in my opinion, the most fascinating piece of poetry. From the firsttrack to the last, this is one damn good album. Her music gets better and better. And although Madonna created much of the text in pop culture from the early '80's to present, she now examines it, rather than trying to maintain her position there. Some may think that her best music was in the '80's, I however find that it only gets better. The older she has grown, the wiser she has become and the wiser she becomes the more she has to say.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|I, like many others, thought &quot;Brave New World&quot; was a massive return to form for Iron Maiden.  I was hooked after just one listen, but unfortunately &quot;Dance of Death&quot; had the opposite effect.  I've now had several listens and I desperately want to like the songs more but it just isn't happening.  For me, it is a backward step to the Blaze Bailey era - too many long, repetitive songs that probably could have been summed up in four minutes ... not seven to ten.<BR>I'm a big Maiden fan, but I'm afraid &quot;Dance of Death&quot; is a bit of a disappointment.  &quot;Rainmaker&quot; is a definite highlight though.<BR>I remain optimistic that the boys will hit top form again soon.
B00009TB5G|5.0|\\"There were more than a couple of places where Jackson could have avoided overkill just by MAKING THE CONFOUNDED MOVIE THE WAY TOLKIEN WROTE IT!!!\\"  That's what one of the reviewers wrote in his/her review.  I hate to break it to all of you out there, but this isn't a book, it's a movie.  All the one-star reviewers have been rating this as a comparison to Tolkiens books, but if they put aside the fact that this is not a book, but a movie, they might realize what an amazing film this is.<br />The visuals and acting are amazing, and the minor plot changes that Peter Jackson inserts into this movie don't hurt or harm the movie, in my opinion.  Sure, it changes your thoughts on some of the characters, maybe distorts Tolkien's original story, but without comparing it to the books, the plot is flawless.  Also, the battles, contrary to the beliefs of some previous reviewers, are not pointless fighting.  I admit, this is a very violent movie, but Rohan, Gondor, and the ex-fellowship are all fighting for a reason, and a very good one at that: the timeless struggle of good versus evil.  The battles seem to come alive, with the costumes and sets and all.<br />Also, the love story between Aragorn and Arwen is in the books, but it is in the appedices.  All in all, this is an excellent movie, as was the Fellowship, and I expect The Return of the King to be just as good.  I also expect the extended editions of the last two movies live up to my expectations.  In conclusion.... just watch the movie.
B00005Q45W|1.0|I listened to this CD in disbelief. Monotonous, dead-tired, low-frequency rasp that does not follow a melody. Might as well, since the accompanying music is annoying synthesizer twang and drum machine clang reminiscent of a seventies adult movie.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|i like a band who can broaden their minds a lil <BR>in the thirteenth step its done with nurse who loved me<BR>one of my favorite songs off of fantastic planet an album by failure <BR>perfect circle fans believe me im not that big on perfect circle until i learned they can do something like this <BR>the album is not 100 percent a must to own but if you have 20 bucks laying around id use it on a pack of gum and this record
0446677450|2.0|The book does a good job of stressing that one should use their money to make money and not fall into the trap that most people do. However, it is way, way to wordy. It could be pared down substantially. It also does not give any specific strategies for creating wealth. It is very vague.
1400049628|5.0|While most so-called &quot;zombie-survival experts&quot; explain that killing blows to the head are the best way to dispatch a zombie, the author of The Zombie Survival Guide  goes even further, describing every possible zombie attack scenario and giving the reader the best advice. How can you fight zombies under water? What's the best way to use a compound bow to dispatch the enemy? While chainsaws provide some psychological benefit in battle, are they really your best defense against the undead hordes? I find myself returning again and again to this book, examining the advice and comparing it with my own plans - invariable I find some small detail that I had overlooked in my preparation. Highly reccomended.
B000002UAU|5.0|This is my favorite Album of all time.  It was ground breaking when it was released in 1967 (I was 13) and is still fun to listen to today.  It had all the lyrics on the back cover.  It covered all sorts of styles from hard rock (Sergeant Pepper) to sitar music with George, to pop deities like Lovely Rita and Getting Better.  If you love rock/pop music and want something to make you feel alive and put a smile on your face, this is the CD to get.
6301797906|5.0|I have seen this movie more times than I can count, and it is justly included among the all-time best.  I have known people like the Joads in my lifetime, and their simple dignity is the linchpin of this story.  The depiction of how they must deal with the plight of losing nearly everything they have, which wasn't that much in the first place, should be a lesson for those of the contemporary generation who consider not having two cars and a big-screen TV to be \\"hardship.\\"  Every aspect of the production is wonderful, and the actors rise to the challenge of the story.  Many scenes are among the best ever put on film, such as Muley recounting the loss of his farm, or Pa Joad and the kids buying bread in the diner.  Truly a work of art which will continue to stand the test of time.  Highest possible recommendation.
B0000AR8NK|4.0|I didn't even know this album was coming.  It was a nice surprise at the music store.  I've still been too busy being blown away by last years' &quot;HEATHEN&quot;<BR>There isn't a single Bowie album that isn't worth the purchase, no appologies to those of you who disagree.  This album ties closely to &quot;HEATHEN&quot; and overall seems like a less intelligent sibling to it.  Certainly with a better sense of humor and being more upbeat.  This ablum isn't great, but it is really good.<BR>However, &quot;HEATHEN&quot; was a GREAT album.  It had a darker persona and more tame melodies.  And definatly had songs that stuck out more. <BR>Not many tracks from &quot;REALITY&quot; stand out much.  So the overall verdict:  Once again the album is really good, and is a good follow up to its predecessor.  But if you don't have &quot;HEATHEN&quot; yet, buy it before you buy &quot;REALITY&quot;.  Better yet, buy them together.  It's been a long time since Bowie released an album that is so similarily modeled after the one that came before it.  And that certainly isn't a bad thing.  (also, none of Bowie's music from the 90's was crap)
B000002B30|3.0|As others have pointed out, there are better tunes that should have found their way here.  The live version of &quot;Fire&quot; and &quot;Pink Cadillac&quot; to name a couple.  Yup, they're covers, but incredible covers.  And how about his version of &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot;?  It would be a real eye opener for new listeners to Bruce's cranking, rhythmic telecaster work.
B00008OWZC|5.0|.. although i have to say that you need the DVD a little more. But this set is simply fantastic, and for a fan like myself who wasn't around when they were performing, this is one of the most wonderful things i could possibly have asked for. The soundtrack to \\"The Song Remains The Same\\", like the movie, i've always found a little disappointing, and this album rights that wrong just as the DVD, which you need, rights the wrong that was the film itself. This is an awe-inspiring album and was a revelatory experience the first time i heard it. After the first few chords i had realized exactly why Zep concerts are as legendary as they've become.
0156012197|1.0|This is a wonderful book in a disappointing new translation. \\"The Little Prince\\" is one of the most beautiful, wise and significant books I've ever read. Part of the deep appreciation I have long felt towards Antoine de Saint-Exupery for writing it has now emerged, for reading this new translation by Richard Howard, as an appreciation of Katherine Woods' inspiration and insight in her (1943) rendition of the story. <br />Publicity for the new (2000) translation criticises Woods' version as \\"slightly wooden or didactic.\\" I think it could be said that, insofar as this is so, it is `wood' with a living quality, a `didacticism' with warmth, irony, understanding and humour, a care and gentleness lacking in Howard's version, which in comparison is rather metallic. It feels a bit of a shame that anyone would read a more mechanical interpretation when they could be reading the Woods version. It is saddening indeed to think that this new translation will actually replace Woods' in bookshops. <br />Howard's version being widely publicised as superior to me says far more about those standing to profit from sales than it does about the nature of The Little Prince. So I write this as a small appeal to you adults. \\" `Children,' I say plainly, `watch out for the baobabs!' \\"  Endeavouring to advise, it is easy enough to slip into fooling oneself or others in some way. Mr. Howard's own assurance in his Translator's Note to the new version, that he has surpassed Ms Woods' rendition, runs notably foul. <br />(You may think this is just a matter of opinion. You may think I am being somewhat fussy. You will, perhaps, think like grown-ups on the issue!) <br />The Little Prince is about feeling; feeling and the relationship of our energy and capacity for this to our changing worlds of perception. It's not easy to define the full extent of what I'm referring to in expressing my preference for, my valuing of, Woods' version over Howard's.  I could speak of differences in associative power in the language used, of interplay between words and how they work within, of narrative flow and persona - one can analyse and hypothesize, but the key remains something vital and tricky to formulate, as with the impact of verbal style in Hoban's \\"Riddley Walker\\" or Mitchell's \\"Hog's Wholey Wash\\". Not that Katherine Woods' tailoring of words makes for such a challenge to read; her version of The Little Prince both reads better immediately and yields more on digestion than what we are now presented with as the \\"new and improved version\\". One might simply speak of what is felt as going to depth and echoing with a ring of magic, compared to what rings with a muted industrial clank. <br />However true it may be to the letter of Saint-Exupery's original, Howard's version is, sure as eggs is eggs, not as true as Woods' to the spirit of The Little Prince.
B0000033RY|5.0|great compilation! My opinion is that you have to own all Cactus albums , if you are hard rock fan ! Songs like Evil, Parchment farm, let me swim, Oleo, Feel so good , etc. are true classics . They will never die! If some other Cactus fan read this , please e-mail me ! There is nothing more to say about this disk , you have just to sit down and enjoy!!!!!!
B00005JM4Z|1.0|One day, some brainwashed, MTV moron came up with the idea to mix rap and street racing and put it in a movie. He gave us The Fast and The Furious. Boy, that movie was terrible. Now, he decides to make a sequel(Why?) and puts more rap in it, but this time, Ludacris shows up. I hope this Fast and The Furious trend dies off along with that dumb, &quot;gangsta&quot; rap trend.
B000089RVX|1.0|I hate this CD.  Its a collection worthless, whiny, &quot;Oh poor me&quot; songs.  I don't hate all depressing songs, but this Amy Lee chick can't even sing.  It drives me insane.  I HATE THIS CD!!!!
0805053883|5.0|I bought this book for my 20-month-old daughter a few days ago because she was ready for some new books and really liked Brown Bear, Brown Bear.  Well, we've read it about 15 times each day since then.  She even took it to bed with her.  The pictures are beautiful and it introduces some new animals that we haven't normally talked about.  I would definitely recommend it.
B0000683WG|5.0|I think this is the best album from T.Rex. This is the first album I bought from them and I collected the other ones afterwords but I think that this album defines their style the best. For anyone interested in listening to T.Rex, I'd say start with this one first and if you don't like it, chances are T.Rex aren't for you. I don't know how anyone could not like it though. Good music, great lyrics and an amazing voice is totally what they delivered here. Marc Bolan's genious is totally clear on this album.
B00005JM09|4.0|To be fair, I went into the movie expecting it to top T2...That was my fault.  The movie by itself is credible and enjoyable to watch.  It has humor, suspense, intrigue and climax.  There are hero's and heroines.  Overall the movie was worth watching, and most likely I will be adding it to my DVD collection.  But I do have some knocks.<BR>1. The villan in this movie seemed to evoke this annoying quality.  The movie doesn't make you respect her power, like the T-1000 did, it's more like she is just a more advanced weapon and basically real annoying.  Take for example her weapon.  There are times where she could have used it, and for all intents and purposes the movie would have been over, but no, she stuck to hand to hand combat.  That was annoying.  Big Picture Bottom Line, the villan is not credible.<BR>2. The John Connor the actor, my God, do I need to say tree hugger.  He sounded so much like a liberal leftist agenda pusher I could hardly stand him talking.<BR>3. Claire Danes, never been particularly impressed with her work but she did alright in this movie.  I think with the budget they put in on this one they could have afforded a little more muscle in that role.  I should say the same for John Connor.<BR>4. There wasn't the love in this movie that made the other so popular and strong.  The theme of the 2nd movie was that even a machine can know what love is, even if it something he could never do.<BR>That's what makes T2 such a found memory for me, and why I continue to watch it to this day.<br />Hope this was helpful.<BR>Overall I loved the movie and would watch it again, and even pay to go to the theater to watch it again.
B00006EXDM|5.0|A number of other reviewers have done a great job addressing the songs collected in this recording, I just wanted to briefly describe the quality of the SACD layer of this hybrid 2-disc set... it's excellent.  I did some back to back listening of the CD (Redbook) layer and SACD layers for comparison.  On &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; you can hear Mick's more subtle grunts &amp; screams with startling clarity behind the percussion intro.  Detail and dynamic range is similarly impressive throughout both discs.<br />The remastering definitely produced a very good CD layer (particularly the stereo imaging), but the SACD truly shines.  A must have for any Stones fan with SACD equipment!
B00008PW3Q|4.0|This could have been awful, a cynical water-treading exercise only tarnishing the might FM's past glories. <br />What a pleasant surprise, then, to discover then that this CD is brimming with ambition and invention. For four people with nothing to prove, it's a hungry record. Most of all, it shows how much Lindsey Buckingham has been missed on the last two FM studio albums. He's the hub of this band, with his edgy vocals, virtuoso guitar playing and constantly imaginative production. <br />Whether the average record buyer will be swayed by them remains to be seen, but this CD contains several magnificent potential singles in the likes of What's the World Coming To, Say You Will, Peacekeeper and the beautiful Goodbye Baby. This is not all, though, as Buckingham in particular pushes the boat out with more challenging, less obvious radio tracks such as Murrow and Come. Stevie Nicks, whilst never everyone's cup of tea, sounds more motivated here than almost any time in the last 20 years. <br />Shortcomings? Well, this album is maybe a little too long and  could have been a real killer with only 12 tracks instead of 18, the likes of Silver Girl and Everybody Finds Out in particular being fairly disposable. Christine McVie is not as badly missed as might have been expected, but her lighter, more sunny pop would have been a nice contrast. <br />Overall the worst thing I could say about this CD is that perhaps it is a little over-ambitious. But it's a tribute to the Mac that, after all these years and millions of records sold, they can be bothered to really try. And the hunger and ambition on display shames many far younger acts out there. An unexpected triumph.
B0000AXM3Q|5.0|I liked this probably more than any since somewhere in time.<BR>Really really good. Harkens back to the old maiden
B00005JLK1|4.0|The story had the required couple of large plot holes (how come they can use 40 million on making a film, but not pay somebody to fix plot holes?), but the whole visual is quite amazing. You never really think about the fact that they could not possibly have filmed this on a real ship, so how did they do it? See the DVD extras for that answer. <br />The actor playing the ghost girl, Emily Browning, is very talented and very beautiful, I predict that we will see a lot of her in the future.
B00005T30L|1.0|I don't supposed anyone has noticed, but there are apparently so many disaffected people who don't fit into society that if you are one of these people then you are not a minority any more. You belong to a growing group of lazy losers who claim that they are too special to be forced to fit in (read: actually get a job and make something of yourself). Of course, you still need clothing and food and that sort of thing. So if you can't obtain these things for yourself legitimately you either have to steal them or get someone like the government to steal them for you. In any case if you do not make your own way in life you instead become a ward of the state or of some charity. In this case, far from becoming someone who is alienated you actually become someone who is totally dependent on the good graces of others and are in fact completely the effect of others and you have absolutely no independence at all. Sure, you might live in some self-delusory state of independence.... that is until you get hungry and show up at the welfare office.<br />This nasty reality is never picked up in these angst-ridden little indie flicks. Everyone oohs and aaahs about how disaffected Enid supposedly is when in fact she is totally dependent upon the goodwill of others. Enid is in fact a prime example of what we call a mentally ill paerson. She lives in a delusory state where she believes that she is deftly criticizing society and avoiding being pushed into one of its boxes when in fact she is a permanent resident of one of the most pathetic boxes of our society.<br />The truly independent are successful people who have learned to deal with society enough to amass control over their own lives. One usually does this by communicating well with others... not by descending into some psychotic personal mental universe where one spends most of one's time making others miserable. So unless Enid can get a job making crap movies like Ghost World she is doomed to a life of dependence on others.<br/>The bus that takes her away is probably just driving over to the set of Soylent Green.<br />I imagine that if some indie producer put a 90 minute film on screen of a steaming cow pie we would find 100 5 star reviews on Amazon.com. However calling a pile of steaming cow pie art doesn't change the fact that it is still a steaming cow pie...like Ghost World. A cowpie if there ever was one.<br />As long as people will line up to pay their $9 the Hollywood machine will continue to churn out teen-angst cowpies like this one.
B000089RV6|5.0|I have been an AC/DC fan since I first heard the album (Notice the word album) &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot; at midnight back in the late 70's.  Bon Scott had rough, raucous vocals and was rocking along at full pace when he died from alcohol in London.  The album, Highway To Hell was kicking and AC/DC had finally gotten on top.  When Bon died, it looked like the end but a little known lead man from the band Gordie was hired to continue on the head banging.  Brian Johnson was his name, and he not only continued to carry the torch, he brought his own style to the band.  Although Brian's vocals are similar to Bon's, they are also as unique and as powerful as Bon's.  This album has your typical Angus Young riffs but also has a renewed energy that was a springboard for the next twenty years of rockin.  By far, You Shook Me All Night Long, is the most popular song of this album and can also be construed as AC/DC's best song ever.  It does have a commercial feel to it but it also has the sexual raunchness that we have come to love from AC/DC.  From the moment you fire up the album with &quot;Hells Bells&quot; ringing in your ears to the final cut of &quot;Rock And Roll Aint Noise Pollution&quot; you will be completely satisfied with your purchase.  There is not a bad cut on here.  Although many people originally claimed that Bon Scott was the creator of this music and Brian Johnson just sung Bon's songs, this could not be farther from the truth.  Yes, Bon was part of this but Brian, Angus, Malcom, Phil, and Cliff made this album great.  Most bands are lucky to have a few hits here and there.  And very few bands have albums that are great throughout.  Even more rare is a band that has more than one album in which every every song on it is superb.  Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, and AC/DC are a few of those rarest of bands.  If you buy this CD, buy also their previous CD, Highway To Hell and you will have purchase two of the finest heavy metal CDs with the uniqueness of hearing Bon Scott on HTH and Brian Johnson on BIB.  You won't stop rocking to either of these classics.  I know I haven't and enjoy listening to both of them over and over.  Peace out!

B00006RIO7|5.0|I am privileged to have seen many Broadway shows and am usually a person who thinks the movies are &quot;cute&quot; but not nearly as delightful as the on stage performance.  Chicago is one of the exceptions to this.  This film is truly a gem amongst many of the other poor attempts to create a motion picture from an original on stage play!  Richard Gere and Renee Zellweger were surprisingly great for two actors who were not known before as singers and dancers.  The star of the show by far, though, was Catherine Zeta-Jones, whose singing and dancing capabilities are phenonmenal!  Queen Latifa was also spectacular and definitely showed the diversity of her talent-- the women everyone thought was solely a rap artist proved to be a talented actress and singer of another genre of music as well.  <br />I have to agree with most of the other reviews that stated that Latifa's rendition of the Jailhouse Tango did not send chills down my spine like the other numbers on the album but it is not horribly done either.  I definitely enjoyed Charm and I Move On on the soundtrack, although they were cut from the movie.  Charm is especially good, as it is a duet between Catherine and Queen Latifa, the two most talented singers in the cast.  Both of them can hold their own and really complement eachother's voices.  I Move On is also a great number, although Catherine definitely sings circles around Renee, but Renee did do a marvelous job portraying Roxy nonetheless.<br />I would highly recommend this soundtrack-- I was at Target the day after seeing the movie in the theater-- I just had to have it!!  And if there is anyone left who has not seen the movie Chicago yet, this is definitely a title not to miss!!!!
0743200748|4.0|Author Stephen E. Ambrose has made quite a career out of his historical writings.  Viewed to be one of the most, if the most, pre-eminent World War II historians, Ambrose has written many captivating accounts of the brave men who have taken up arms in defense of this country and freedom.  He has also chronicled some of lesser-detailed, though quite famous, events in U.S. history, such as the building of the transcontinental railroad, the journey of Lewis and Clark, and the parallel lives of General Custer and Crazy Horse until their fateful meeting at Little Big Horn.  What is common in Ambrose' writing, and what makes the stories so compelling and accessible to average reader, is that he understands the importance of the human emotions and common bonds produced by the strong friendships of the men whose lives are immortalized in history.  His seminal work, &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; is THE classic example of this. <BR><BR>Ambrose has chronicled these male friendships in many of his books, but has felt the need to extract some of these stories and have them stand alone in a separate volume on the strength and importance of male friendships.  The result is &quot;Comrades&quot;, a sometimes slow, but mostly compelling anthology of the power of male friendships that took place in form of fathers, sons, brothers, and colleagues for famous historical figures.  &quot;Comrades&quot; is a relatively short book, with each chapter dedicating just a brief synopsis of these friendships.  However, they serve as a primer that makes the reader want to dive deeper in the stories behind these men.  One can read the short about the relationship between General Dwight Eisenhower and his brother Milton, an academic man who was his closest confidante, advisor, champion, and friend and be compelled to flesh out the relationship further by reading the Eisenhower biography.  The stories about the Custer Brothers and of Crazy Horse and He Dog merely whet the appetite for the stories thatpermeate &quot;Crazy Horse and Custer&quot;.  The same can be said for Meriweather Clark and William Clark and &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot;.<BR><BR>It could be argued that a book like &quot;Comrades&quot; is nothing more than a marketing gimmick to get people to buy other Stephen Ambrose books.  That is a shortsighted and cynical interpretation.  &quot;Comrades&quot; is a wonderful primer that makes these stories accessible to the common reader and if it spurs them to seek out other books about these same subjects, then that is just a testament to the power of these stories and skill of Ambrose' writing.
B00005JM4Z|3.0|I give this movie 3 stars because some of the cars are cool and Devon Aoki is very hot. The things that suck about this movie are the acting, (especially Paul Walker, it makes me cringe to watch this guy act) Ludacris (what a clown) and all the moronic rap music. Isn't this garbage out of style yet.
B000001FDQ|5.0|this is one of the most influential instrumental albums in the shred genre.<BR>it popularized shred and everyone came out to release albums with mind-boggling virtuosity, and this stands as one of the best out there.malmsteen is now disliked by many and is demeaned all over the internet for being soulless in his playing and doing the same thing all the time, well maybe ... you dont have too listen too him.this is one of his albums that actually shows his amazing skill and beautiful playing in one album,take the epic icarus dream suite op.4,this has some of the most beautiful slow playing i have heard on the electric guitar ,also some heart-wrenching acoustics.this song shows he plays with feeling.<BR>as we all know yngwie has other-worldly chops and he uses them perfectly here,inconjunction with compositions that are second to none (black star,far beyond the sun,evil eye,little savage,icarus dream suite.)<BR>with this album he cemented his place in guitar history,and gave us the bible,SO TO SAY, of neo-classical guitar ,that is still praised today.<BR>an excellent neo-classical album,possibly the best there is.<BR>a true slice of guitar mastery.  ...
B00001U0DP|5.0|I can't understand the poor reviews of this movie.  It is not a documentary of the Holocaust.  It is an extraordinary story of what it means to be a father.  I know it made me want to be a better one.
B00005221M|1.0|I won't go into a story review- you can get plenty of those with the other entries.<br />My criticism is with the DVD itself. Like other people have said, this DVD isn't enhanced, it's been hacked. There are a few scenes added that when you look at them, you know why they were edited out. But what's worse, some of the dialogue and music has been cut. Some good lines were taken out, and the music excerpt from Clannad's &quot;I Will Find You&quot; towards the end is missing. Plus, there is expanded dialogue to the speech made in the end that goes on to predict moderm life with buildings and the plight of the faceless office worker- it's preachy and unrealistic.<br />The only reason I can see as to why they did this was a money making scheme- release a hacked up version of a movie that everyone loves on DVD, then when enough people have bought it and see how messed up it is, they'll re-release the original version on DVD so people will have to buy it all over again.<BR>My recommendation is to buy a legal copy of the original, unaltered widescreen version on VHS and copy it to DVD for yourself, in case they never release the &quot;good&quot; version on DVD.
B00005NWM3|5.0|This is the best rock cd of 2001. Nickelback had been scarcely heard of in the mainstream but one song catapulted them into it and the rest of the CD was just as good, if not better. Nickelback's lyrics reflect a lot on personal issues that happened to them in their life but are also vague enough for somebody to be able to relate to them. No poppy song made for the radio and Chad Kroeger's voice is great and the rest of the band, especially the drummer, are top notch.<br />Never Again - Solid opening song that sets the mood for the rest of the album.<br />How You Remind Me - The BIG hit. This one put them on the map for good. Got played out a little but still a solid track.<br />Woke Up This Morning - My personal favorite. Great lyrics and flow to this song. Really great song.<br />Too Bad - Song convinced many people to buy this CD by showing that there was more than just one hit on the CD. Good song dealing with abandonment as a child.<br />Just For - Decent song, probably the worst on the album but still a good song that would be a top track on most other band's albums.<br />Hollywood - Yet another solid track.<br />Look What Your Money Bought - One of their harder songs in the way it's played and the way Kroeger half screams the chorus.<br />Where Do I Hide - Good 30 second instrumental intro the leads into another lyrically solid song.<br />Hangnail - Another solid track. Last of the total rock out songs on the album<br />Good Times Gone - Great closer. A lot slower than most songs in the beginning but it's still a really good song.<br />The only negative about this CD is it's length. Only 10 tracks with around 40 minutes of music is not that much. Then again with more tracks we might be complaining about the quality of those songs. <br />I like how they swear in their songs but don't make it so over the top that it gets annoying and it makes them seem powerful. Great CD that is a must buy for any fan of music, nut just rock.
B00008AY3L|3.0|As a fan of Ben Harper's work from the get go this one was highly anticipated but ownership has proved a struggle.<br />It kickoff with a cracker 'With my own two hands' which is as reggae as Harper's ever been. With the title track and 'Touched by your Lust' it's a strong start. <br />Past that it's a struggle. Sure the bloke can play and play with passion. And there's no shortage of that. It's just that the latter half of the disc is melodically monotnous for my liking. <BR>The real sticking point for me is that it is lyrically far too stuck in the religous groove. I'm happy enough to have an artist get spiritual on me but not for song after song especially when a large part of it just seems to me to be 'wailing to Jesus'. And if you aren't of that mind (like me) then it gets seriously annoying.<br />I suspect the bloke is exploring grooves and themes that he feels he needs to but he lost me with this one. So far.  I'll keep working on it but I'm not too hopeful.<br />Overall it is an interesting development in Ben Harper but not one I'd wholey recommend especially if you are new to Harper. Start with 'Fight for Your Mind' and 'Burn to Shine' or even the live album. Leave 'Diamonds on the Inside' for another day.<br />The other superbly painful thing about this CD is the copy control software. A decent hifi player will have no real trouble with it but if you use a computer to play music, this CD (and most other Virgin CC efforts) sounds repellant.  Unbelieveably it sounds even worse when you use the media player that is included in the disc. I don't object to the CC concept but truely this is a godawful effort at it.
B000089RVR|5.0|I think this CD is very, very good.  I like every song on it.  I really appreciate the talent of this artist and will continue to look forward to future recordings of hers.
B00005JKC3|1.0|Hulk spend lots of time in trailer on set.   <br /> <br />Two hours and twenty minutes and we see about 18 minutes of the green guy. More realistic title: Nick Nolte as Hulk's Dad...with a brief appearance by the Hulk.  <br /> <br />Hulk want new editor!  <br /> <br />This movie is long and boring if you are new to \\"The Hulk\\" and painful if you are a fan of the comic books.  They must have spent so much money on special effect for this film that they couldn't afford an editor.  I was hoping when they released this DVD, they might reverse the concept of \\"Deleted scenes\\" and actually cut this movie down to a bearable length by deleting scenes!  In one part of the movie they transport Banner via helicopter to a military base in the desert.  I think they filmed it in real time because an actual flight to the desert would have been shorter. <br /> <br />Hulk confused, how tall is Hulk?  <br /> <br />In one scene he's 7 feet, in another 15 and in another he's 20 feet tall.  Thank goodness for his stretch pants!  <br /> <br />Hulk boring.  <br /> <br />The Hulk should be the heart, soul and nervous system of this story. Instead he is a special effect. He is never developed as a character and as a result you never care for/about him.  It's a pretty simple formula, ex. Hunchback, King Kong, etc. but Ang Lee gets lost in some demented \\"Sins of the father\\" interpretation, that just doesn't fit this storyline. <br /> <br />Hulk rent this one (maybe), not buy.
B000099T2L|4.0|This cd really is not bad, and she has some pretty good co-stars as well, such as Big Boi &amp; Sean Paul.  It didn't blow me off my feet with originality or anything, but I definitely can't think of anything negative to say about it!  Way to go Beyonce!
B00005JM09|1.0|Before i start, i would like to mention that i am a big fan of the first two Terminator films.<br />All i respect about this T3 is Arnold and the special effects.<br />1. The acting is crap, apart from Arnold that is<BR>2. The plot is too much like T2 and it contradicts the \\"judgement day\\" theory<BR>3. To many jokes overshadowed the threat of a nuclear war<BR>4. The TX was not frightening at all<BR>5. \\"you remind me of my mother\\", Save me from those silly one liners, please. The dialogue is funny.<br />6. Johnathan Mostow, you should be very ashamed, and I hope you get shot. LOL<br />No seriously the film was terrible, A big shame. <BR>I won't treat T3 as a sequel, but a \\"cash in on the Terminator franchise\\" film.<br />I'll be buying Matrix-Reloaded on DVD instead.
0385486804|5.0|Every once in while I pull this book out of the shelf and accidentally end up reading it again. If magazines like &quot;Argosy&quot; (if that's the correct name...I remember reading old issues during summer vacations because my uncle subscribed to it) still existed, it'd be filled with Krakauer's stories. He has a way of adding a dash of the mystic into the reality. Although, sometimes you wish he weren't so endearingly sensitive about a victim's relatives, friends, etc. It'd be nice to read what he REALLY thinks. As it is, I've found nothing that compares to his approach when it comes to survival-adventure stories. Truly engrossing with the added benefit or twist of making you think and wonder about the subject throughout the years.
B000002JSN|5.0|You Most to Buy This Masterpiece ,Is the Best Album of Led Zeppelin and is a Double Album with 15 songs with 11 epic songs.Its has Rock, Metal ,Blues,Acid, Dark,Funky,Country and Morroco sounds.&quot;Kashmir&quot; is the best work.
B0000666DW|5.0|This cd is probably worth the $$ just for the drumming alone but thankfully the rest of the band has enough talent to back it up with. First off, Brann Dailor is an AMAZING drummer and does an incredible job on this cd , without his drumming this cd would of just been very good and not amazing.<br />At some points Mastodon reminds of Tool a little bit(check the beginning of &quot;ol'e nessie&quot;) and a little of Isis(very dynamic,plenty of different textures,and  requires more than one listen to grasp it all). Overall Mastodon create an incredible,intense,melodic,flowing,dynamic cd that is one of the better cd's i've heard in quite awhile(and probably Relapse's best of 2002). this is a MUST BUY!!!
B000069AUI|5.0|Typically a band will put their best song or songs from their album on the radio. Such a tactic makes the listener eager to buy the CD, but horribly disappointed after hearing hastily put together pieces on the rest of the album. &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; steers clear of such a demoralizing strategy. Coldplay released &quot;The Scientist&quot; and &quot;Clocks&quot; on the radio some time ago. Both of the songs were eerie and mesmerizing. Alike these pieces, all of the other nine songs on the album are equally as good if not better. The entire album keeps the listener eased and sometimes causes occasional chills to race down his spine. &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; is a wonderful CD well worth purchasing. The listener will discover that it is one of the few CDs which can be played all the way through without skipping tracks. I recommend this CD to every one who truly appreciates music in its beautiful form.
B000003S0P|5.0|...that takes your breath then only after several seconds you realize it has been done on just ONE NOTE? Others already discussed the tracks, I would only say that this record was at the epoch so advanced that still TODAY, 30 years after, it sounds modern; incredibly beautiful music. Definitely not for the faint of heart.  Does anyone know where the title &quot;Red&quot; came out from? It came natural to the guys, since, during the recording, they were always pushing the needle of the signal level meters to the red zone (distortion). This definitely is one of the records that can't be discussed: it just needs to be heard, respected and loved forever. Not a misplaced or wrong note. It's not a case, as alreday reminded by Kyle, that for Kurt Cobain it was one of his most cherished albums  :-)
B000002I7H|5.0|This is an excellent overview of Albert King's beginning days with Stax Records and house band Booker T. &amp; the MGs, along with The Memphis Horns. What this offers is the entire landmark Born Under a Bad Sign album which is considered by many to be the definitive urban Blues album. Atlantic packaged that album with some bonus material that is just as great.<br />  King was without a doubt the most prolific Blues guitarist of his generation, and his sound spawned more imitators than even B.B. King. The remastered Rhino CD The Very Best of Albert King is the place to go to get the full effect of Albert's Blues power. His guitar doesn't stand out here near as much, but this is really a showcase for not only King's soulful string bending, but for the MGs' superior ensemble playing. It took the greatest Soul band in the world to be the most perfect band any Blues singer could ask for. Multi-instrumentalist Booker T. Jones will dazzle the listener with the most impressive technically and stylistically Blues piano work I've ever heard. And with King's producer and drummer Al Jackson, Jr. leading the way, these are some of the greatest records ever made - whatever the genre'.
B0000AUHOH|3.0|Classic \\"Star Trek\\" had its share of bad episodes.  They're part of the \\"Star Trek\\" canon.  Like the episode \\"Spock's Brain,\\" in which the lobotomized Vulcan stiffly stumbles around papier mache sets with his pals in search of his stolen brain.  (His rigid locomation is triggered by a pie plate on his noggin that Dr. McCoy wired to a garage door opener).  As the story progresses, the gang discovers the culprits: a race of bikini-clad bimbos who are almost as brainless as the post-surgical Spock.  Imagine a young, gorgeous Gracie Allen in go-go boots. (You can find this video gem at Amazon, too.).<br /><br />Like it or not, that's part of classic \\"Star Trek.\\"  And \\"Star Trek V\\" fits into that heritage.  But don't just think of it as \\"bad.\\"  Enjoy it for the classic cliches that it recycles with reckless abandon: the group of renegades that takes over the Enterprise, the waves of intense(though not particularly thoughtful) Klingon hostility, the transporter that won't work, the communications officer (Uhura) who breaks into song, the transporter that STILL won't work, the lavishly choreographed fistfights, the paradise that really isn't a paradise.  And of course, there's the cheezy special effects.<br /><br />Sound familiar, Trek fans?<br /><br />And for the first time in the history of Trek movies, you get that classic esprit d'corps between Spock, Kirk and McCoy, who were conspicuously split up (always for a different reason...or lack of reason) in movies 2-4, then again in 6.<br /><br />What you get is a new \\"episode.\\"  Not the best episode by any means, but an episode nonetheless.  Really that's what most Trek fans wanted.  What fan wouldn't have fought off a pack of Klingons to get 20 or 30 episodes added to the stingy 79 that were rerun over and over and over?  Wouldn't it be great to go off on more adventures with the crew of the Enterprise?  Not desk-bound Admiral Kirk, meloncholy about aging--CAPTAIN Kirk sitting in his chair on the bridge like that's wherehe's always been...and like that's where he'll always be.  (In fact, the key lighting on the sets is so intense and the makeup is so heavy that the aging actors look at least five years younger than they were).  And the family of characters all serving and interacting together with a chemistry you just can't get in any other incarnation of \\"Star Trek.\\"<br /><br />Sure, it's got its downside.  Probably the worst aspect is that the crew doesn't act--it always RE-acts to the mischief of the villains.  (Kirk's sole response to someone hijacking HIS ship is to send a message to Star Fleet requesting a \\"rescue ship\\"?  Not even a discussion about turning the tables on the assailants? Incredible that writer/director Shatner could play the part so long and learn so little about it).  And then there's Spock's incomprehensible refusal to shoot the leader of the renegades...the only chance any of them had to prevent the bad guys from taking over the ship.  He later claims he's afraid he'd kill the guy because the weapon fires bullets and there's no stun setting.  So wouldn't the logical thing be to shoot him repeatedly in the legs until he surrenders? (No matter how dire the wounds, McCoy can wave his salt shaker over them until they're healed)<br /><br />So, I only give it three stars because of these and a few other serious blunders (Checkov the navigator gets lost in the woods?  Scotty brags about knowing the ship like the back of his hand, then absentmindedly knocks himself unconscious on a low-hanging beam?).<br /><br />But go ahead -- enjoy it for what it has: the classic Trek essence in spades.
6303471714|4.0|I have an entire cabinet full of workout videos (several dating back to those hideous, early 80's leg warmer days!), and I must say that &quot;Shape Your Body&quot;, which I purchased several years ago, is without question my favorite, most frequently used exercise video. On days I don't make it to the gym (which unfortunately is quite often) or when the weather doesn't permit me to go jogging outside, this Cindy Crawford video has always been a reliable standby - and a nice alternative to a traditional aerobic or cardio-type workout. I wouldn't advise doing it every day, though, or even every other day - you'd probably get burned out. It is, however, a great way to crosstrain or simply incorporate more variety into your existing fitness regimen. The music is cool, the scenery lovely and relaxing to view, and although Cindy is a bit amateurish, her simple, down-to-earth, girl-from-the-Midwest personality is a refreshing change from what one would expect of most celebrities &amp; model types, which gives the video an appeal all its own. My favorite workout is #2, which to me is definitely more addicting than the first, but that's just me. I'll pop in the video while my daughter's napping, and I always feel really good after working out to it, like I've really done something. It is excellent for toning muscles and the results are always apparent soon after. No fancy dance moves - just simple, easy-to-follow (yet challenging) exercises to some good tunes. I also feel mentally relaxed and less stressed after doing the video. It's a basic, yet solid video that I highly recommend for any fitness level.
0142002038|4.0|Most of us have seen a James Bond movie at one time or another and enjoyed the outlandish antics in which he participates.  However, upon getting my hands on this edition and finishing it in a matter of hours, the movies suddenly hold no appeal. I love the literary Bond!  Sure, he's a lecherous alcoholic who smokes 60 cigarettes a day, but that's only during his downtime; when he's on the job, women and booze are secondary.  And sure, it's vastly outdated, but the Cold War is still, by far, the best setting for an espionage thriller.  The Bond in the novels is a cold cutomer who wouldn't hesitate to kill someone close to him to spare them a worse death (as in the latter part of Live And Let Die).  Also, the literary Bond's body is a patchwork of scar tissue, and his handsome features are marred only by a scar on his right cheek.<BR>     That said, Fleming's style is great--short and to the point, much the same as his days writing reports during WWII during his stint in the military.  His prose isnn't flowery, and it advances the story at a brisk pace.<BR>     Dr. No is an excellent turning point for both Fleming and Bond.  Fleming killed Bond at the end of From Russia With Love  (one report being that he'd tired of the character, but fans clammored for Bond's revival).  The events of the previous novel are touched-on briefly in the beginning of the book, but they don't have much bearing on the rest of the story.  However, the return of Quarrel (from Live And Let Die) and his loss greatly affects Bond, bringing a depth of character rarely explored by the celluloid Bonds.<BR>     Dr. No is a great read of the genre of its time, featuring a dashing secret agent hero, a capable sidekick, a beautiful seashell-hunting love interest, 5-inch tropical poisonous centipedes, flamethrowing dragons, sadistic henchmen, a giant squid (not in the movie!), and of course, Dr. No, the pincer-handed, ultra-rich, ultra-evil, guano-dealing nemesis!  Who could ask for anything more?!
B0000BYM3K|4.0|The album is typical maiden music except for 4 songs.<br />Montsegur - The chorus is classical sounding. The way the melody changes from minor to major scale is amazing in this song. But the intro is directly taken from the fallen angel.<br />Dance of Death - Ah, Dance of death. What a song. Unbeleivably beautiful. It conjures up in your mind visions of a forgotten land where all legends and dreams come true. The best maiden song.<br />Paschendale - It is different in the sense there is lots of tempo changes. But it seems too fragmented to sound good.<br />Journeyman - The keyboards are liberously used here. You can hardly hear the guitars on this one. A departure from the heavy riff laden maiden. A very good song to end it.<br />The other songs are pretty good but nothing extraordinary. Iron Maiden.<br />Buy it for Dance of death.
B000001FS6|4.0|Rattle & Hum is a second-tier U2 album.  It pales in comparision to both its predecessor (The Joshua Tree) and its follow-up (Achtung Baby), plus War, Zooropa, and ATYCLB.  That said, there is still plenty to enjoy from Rattle & Hum.<br />I find myself primarily listening to the new studio songs instead of the live material.  With the exception of \\"Pride (In the Name of Love)\\", the live songs do little to challenge the songs' original versions.  The new songs are the winners here: the haunting \\"Van Diemen's Land\\" and the singles \\"Desire\\" and \\"Angel of Harlem\\" stand with the band's best work.  This is not to mention \\"All I Want Is You\\", which is my favorite U2 song and a brilliant way to close out both the album and the 1980s incarnation of the band.  All in all, the live stuff can be overwhelmingly pretentious, but the studio material makes the album worth it for any true U2 fan.
0425188809|5.0|This book is definitely one of the BEST books I've ever read in my entire life! On second thought, it is the best book I've ever read before. This book is a must read! You shouldn't pass the opportunity to read it. Koontz imagined and came up with the best characters of all time. Lassie fans, there's a new dog in town. In the story, there was a highly intelligent dog named Einstein. And boy, he sure did live up to his name! He could read, communicate in standard English, and do just about anything you wish a dog could do. Einstein was great. He made the whole story great. Koontz imagined a wild plot that kept me on the edge of my seat from cover to cover. Do you like monsters and what not? Then you'll love The Outsider. He's the antagonist in the story. Definitely one of the best mosters of all time. Trust me, if you read this book, you won't regret it one bit.
B000002IWQ|4.0|The return of guitar-driven music by Rush is a welcome relief from the heavy synth music of the 80's. Although the 80's Rush music was good, Rush was always at it's best as a guitar, bass and drums trio.<br />Alex Lifeson finally comes back from the dark side of the control room and actually plays in the studio...through an amp! Wow! Can he do that? What a difference. For the first time since Moving Pictures, his guitar sound is deep and resonating. Because of the return to the other side of the glass, the songs have real power. That is something the last two albums (Presto, Roll the Bones) were missing desperately. Kevin Shirley, the engineer, captures the energy and power needed for this album.<br />The songs on the whole are very good. &quot;Animate&quot; is a nice start to the album and &quot;Stick It Out&quot; is known for its airplay; however, it is starting with the third track that the album really starts to take shape.<br />&quot;Cut to the Chase&quot; has a strong groove to it that is hard pounding from start to finish and &quot;Between Sun &amp; Moon&quot;, as it is with all Pye Dubois collaborations, is an amazing song and perhaps the best on the album. &quot;Nobody's Hero&quot; provides a softer counterbalance (or counterpart) between the two, showing a human side that Peart has rarely shown in his lyrics over the past 20 years.<br />The album then hits a snag. &quot;Alien Shore&quot; misses the mark due in part to the lyrics (saying \\"you and I/you and me\\" over and over gets old quickly). The melody never really feels resolved, either. Geddy Lee seems to be searching for a plausible melody and doesn't quite get it.<br />&quot;Speed of Love&quot; is just bad. I have tried to like it. I really have, but I just skip it now. It feels like someone took their foot off the gas. It feels like the band wants to play faster, but just can muster the energy to do it.<br />After that, though, Rush comes blazing back. &quot;Double Agent&quot; is probably their darkest song ever. Rush harkens back to their early days and gets down and dirty in their playing. Lee's haunting spoken vocal over the music invokes Peart's lyrics, an inner battle to decide between \\"right\\" and \\"wrong.\\"  In my mind, it is a fantastic return to those early days.<br />Following right behind is &quot;Leave That Thing Alone&quot;, a syncopated flight into instrumentals. This rivals YYZ as their best. The song practically takes flight on the beautiful guitar work by Lifeson. Lee is, of course, brilliant on the bass and the band plays with a rhythm and soul that doesn't normally come out in their music. Close your eyes and drift through the song. It is beautiful.<br />&quot;Cold Fire&quot; is exceptional, especially for anyone who has ever been in a relationship. Read the lyrics while listening to the song. It is the classic argument between men and women that will never be resolved.<br />Unfortunately, the last song, &quot;Everday Glory&quot; is a poor end to the album. The lyrics and music do not match. The lyrics talk of pain and frustration that must be overcome on a daily basis, but the music tries to be more of a \\"bright sunny day walk in the park.\\" Although it is an okay listen, it just isn't a fitting end to this power album.<br />All in all, this is a very good Rush album. Remove three songs and it is one of their best. It certainly is a more powerful album than anything they had released since Moving Pictures. Fans of pre-&quot;Exit...Stage Left&quot; will probably love this one. Fans of the 80's will be very disappointed.
B00009V7P8|5.0|This CD made it's way into my hands when a friend, an Irish singer, said if he could be anyone in the world, he would be Damien Rice. He put this album on and watched eagerly as I devoured it for the first time. Inevitable comparisons to Leonard Cohen, Jeff Buckley, Dave Matthews and Tom Waits will be made, but Rice is a genre unto himself.<br />Rice's voice is beautiful, and in it's human imperfection, convey's a world of deep emotion. The vocal style can change from song to song, but his ability to sing straight to your soul is always there. The lyrics are deep and they burn.<br />'Cold Water' made me weep, I was so caught up. The Gregorian chant at the end was a perfect emotional denouement. 'I Remember' hurt, it was so good.<br />Lisa Hannigan's vocals are woven together with Rice's in a perfect compliment. Her voice begins where his ends.<br />Cellist Vyvienne Long adds a deep, grounding tone that is haunting.<br />The acoustic guitar arrangement went from spartan to a wall of sound. The organic feel augmented the feel of the whole album.<br />As my friend watched me listen for the first time, I knew I had a problem on my hands.<br />What could I possibly do to return this favor?
0375707972|2.0|This is an easy read, I picked it up because I needed something easy to read after taking a lot of hard college courses. It moves very fast, and there's a big twist. A typical Oprah book.
B000099T2L|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by Beyonce's solo effort.  I initially had no plans to buy the CD, but after the release of the second single I decided to give it a try.  It is a wonderful mix of hip hop, classic R&amp;B, and a little reggae.  You can believe the hype on this project.
B00005AQGH|5.0|In theis cd you can hear someone say &quot;Suge shot him&quot; in the first song Bomb First...the person saying it in a low voice so you gotta listen closely..its in the beginning of the song.
B0000C8AUO|5.0|This man's like a fine wine, he keeps getting better with age.  I have listened to the c.d. twice and I already like it alot.  The tunes are strong, the production is strong and Bowies voice really comes out at you.  I love the cover of Pablo Picasso, I was pleasently surprised with it's inclusion on this five star masterpiece.
B000089RVR|4.0|I am, overall, impressed with &quot;Life For Rent.&quot; I was expecting to give the album 5 stars, but I find myself just a bit disappointed with the album. I can't quite explain what it is; all I know is something is missing. I think the stripped down music is a bit of a jolt when compared to &quot;No Angel.&quot; Nonetheless, I am pleased with the CD. Standout tracks for me are &quot;White Flag,&quot; &quot;See You When You're 40,&quot; &quot;Who Makes You Feel,&quot; and &quot;See the Sun.&quot; I am not too impressed with &quot;Sand in My Shoes&quot;--sung too quickly for my taste.  &quot;Do You Have a Little Time&quot; is MUCH better live, although it is nice here. Actually Dido live is better than any album.She should seriously consider a live album. She is a much better live performer than studio artist. The songs transform into something much more beautiful and haunting when she is on stage. Oh, the album!! I recommend it---you won't be disappointed :0)
