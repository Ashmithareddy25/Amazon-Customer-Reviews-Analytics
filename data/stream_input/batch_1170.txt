B000JLSM00|4.0|I was told that THE SEARCHERS was perhaps the best John Wayne movie ever made. Believe it or not, I'd never seen it before. So when I saw that the blu-ray was on sale at amazon for under $10 I decided what the heck, let's give it a go. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />Wayne stars as Ethan Edwards, a rough and tumble man of the west comes home after fighting for the south in the Civil War. As the film opens, we see a woman through the front door of her house, Wayne on horseback riding to the house. This is the home of his brother and his family, a home that Ethan knew before the war. As the film moves on we get the idea that there was once something between Ethan and Martha, his brother's wife, but nothing is said aloud.<br /><br />Ethan is greeted by his brother and his family, a nephew, two nieces and a young man named Martin Polly (Jeffrey Hunter) who Ethan saved as a child, the sole survivor of an Indian attack on a wagon train. But the reunion doesn't last long when the next morning a group of men on horseback show led by Rev. Capt. Clayton (Ward Bond). It seems a group of Indians have run off with homesteader Jorgensen's cattle and they're about to search for them. Ethan insists his brother remain home but Martin goes along.<br /><br />Following the trail they discover that the cattle were stolen for a reason: to get them away from the settler's homes so they could be attacked. They split when riding back to cover both places. Ethan and Martin return to find the farm ablaze and the bodies of everyone but Lucy and Debbie, the two nieces now presumed kidnapped. This ignites a search that last most of the film as Ethan and Martin head out to rescue the girls.<br /><br />It would be so easy to offer bits and pieces of the story now, to tell you who makes it when and who doesn't. But that would take away what is an effective piece of story telling done by master director John Ford. He and Wayne made many movies together and many consider this one to be their best. The way he frames scenes, the way he moves his actors is amazing and in turn presents a story that you don't realize until it finishes.<br /><br />Watching the extras also helped me see so many of the things I missed while watching. We're a movie going public used to extreme violence when watching films these days. This film offers up violent images without actually showing them. The scene where Wayne enters what appears to be a smoke house to find the bodies of his brother and sister in law is gripping. You know how he found them by the look on his face, not by seeing the actual bodies. And in some ways that's more disturbing.<br /><br />One thing I was aware of with this film was the subtle discussion of racism involved in it. Made when this was a somewhat taboo topic, Ford and Wayne brought it to the forefront here. Several characters have this discriminatory view of the Indians in the film that carries on to their captives as well. The search for the girls takes 5 years and during that time young Debbie becomes a woman. The question of whether to bring her back or to kill her since she's been touched in more ways than one by her captor is central to the film. On one hand Ethan is ready to do what he considers his duty in killing her, on the other Martin, part Indian himself, is willing to do all he can to stop Ethan.<br /><br />This film offered something different for Wayne than previous roles. Before he was the hero, the cowboy, the one guy everyone wanted to be. As Ethan he's questionable at times whether it's wondering where he got the money he gives his brother or in the way he handles various situations. As the film progresses we witness a slow change over the years as Ethan's search for vengeance causes him to do worse deeds than when the search began. He's not a nice guy but he is someone you wish was on your side.<br /><br />The entire cast does a commendable job here. Each of them plays their roles note perfect. Veteran actors who starred in numerous Wayne films present themselves here as well as they've ever done. Ward Bond is cantankerous and at the same time a viable force for the old west. Hank Worden as Mose Harper portrays the man as perhaps simple but at the same time perhaps not. Maybe it's a face he puts on to keep out of harm's way. But the best cast member is Monument Valley.<br /><br />Like almost all of Ford's westerns, this one was shot in Monument Valley. Cut off from civilization for real, the cast and crew weathered some truly dangerous moments to bring this film to life. But its worth it was you view some breathtaking scenery. As I watched I thought to myself that while Frederick Remington captured the spirit and beauty of the old west on canvas, Ford was able to do the same on film.<br /><br />Like I said when I started, the film is available in blu-ray format for under $10 at amazon.com. It's worth that and more. I may not agree with the idea that this is the best western ever made or even Wayne's best western, but I will say that it ranks up there in the top. If you've never seen this one, make it a point to do so.d Bond is cantankerous and at the same time a viable force for the old west.

0525951652|5.0|I have read all of Mr. Follett's novels.  My personal favorite was \\"Pillars of the Earth\\".  This new series (The Century Triolgy) is set in more modern times but it is just as interesting and imaginative.  I disagree with the others who say that the characters lack depth and are two dimensional.  I found myself caring about their lives and how they would turn out as World War One developed and what would happen to them after it ended.  I cannot wait for the next book in the series to come out.<br /><br />It seems quite a few people are put off by the length of some of Mr. Folletts books (I've never really understood this; if the story is great, moves along, and captures your interest why would you want it to end?) Think of it this way the price of this one book is less than what two 300-350 page novels might cost you AND you might just learn something while reading it!
B0034G4ORC|4.0|For years film makers have made movies that talked about an invasion of Earth by aliens. The most famous have included WAR OF THE WORLDS, INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS and THE THING, all made and then later remade. But while each of those films depicted an opposing force taking on our own, more often than not it was a space ship using enormous power or a one on one taking over of a human. A real look at what war with aliens might be like hasn't been seen until the just released BATTLE: LOS ANGELES.<br /><br />The film opens with Staff Sgt. Michael Nantz (Aaron Eckhart) turning in his notice. He's planning on retiring. This is in part because he's had enough but also because his last assignment went bad resulting in most of his men being killed while he survived, something that rumor mongers blame him for. Once his last group is finished training, he's gone.<br /><br />But that doesn't happen when he and his men are called in while on maneuvers. They're whisked away via helicopter to a special base and told that what was thought to be a series of asteroids hitting the Earth is now thought to be an alien invasion. The asteroids are slowing as they hit the atmosphere and as they watch news reports they witness the armed invaders, their form of grunts on foot, rise from the seaside and begin firing on civilians.<br /><br />The battle rages on but the fire power of the aliens is just too massive. With only 3 hours until they drop a ton of bombs to take out Santa Monica, Nantz and his new commander Lt. Martinez (Ramon Rodriguez) are assigned to take their men in to rescue a group stranded in a police station and to send back intel along the way.<br /><br />The men are dropped down but it isn't long before their opponent's fire on them, leaving them with initial casualties and searching for a safe haven if just for a moment. The Lt. finds himself dazed and confused (a stereotype of most war films where a college educated leader stresses under real fire only to have the 2nd in command get him on track). It's up to the Sgt. to get them moving once more and heading for the station.<br /><br />Along the way they encounter the remnants of another platoon who have been hit harder than they have. Regrouping and joining forces, they head for the police station in the hope that the survivors are still alive.<br /><br />Their hopes weren't in vain once they arrive to find a few civilians still alive. The officers there are gone but their mission continues with just a short amount of time left to rescue these people, get back and possibly provide the military with enough information that they can find a way to repel these invaders.<br /><br />All that in less than half the movie.<br /><br />Due to the aliens as the invaders, most people will view this as a science fiction film. In reality this is definitely a war picture. The heroics of the men involved, the gung ho attitude of these Marines, the stereotypes seen in characters have been a staple for years. Many of the plotlines can be found in numerous war films. In any event it just doesn't matter. Even if these ideas and characters have been seen before, they still provide an entertaining film.<br /><br />The film also offers an inspiring look at the military as well. After years of tarnishing those in the military either as post traumatic stress victims, baby killers or goofballs who violate every human right possible, we're presented here with a group of professionals who are trained to defend every person they can, to rescue those in need and to take on any hostile enemy that might attack the U.S., or in this case the Earth.  There are moments when you feel a swelling in your chest as these good men and women do their best against the worst of odds to protect and serve this country. It's rare to see in today's movies and nice for a change.<br /><br />There are no stand out performances in this film. The entire cast does a great job depicting what the possible end of the world due to invasion might be like. There is fear on their faces when confronting an unknown enemy. There is joy when they can save someone. And there is triumph when they win any small battle that they can as they try and get to a safe location.<br /><br />The effects are fantastic offering what appears to be the new look of alien spaceships and weaponry. For me these crafts seemed reminiscent of the space ship seen in DISTRICT 9. And the aliens themselves seem like a twisted compilation of the classic Predator and half a dozen robots seen of late. But it's not just these two items that offer the best effects. It's the scenes of devastation, of Los Angeles in flames, a burning relic of what it once was. That is the effect that sticks with you.<br /><br />While BATTLE: LOS ANGELES isn't quite a feel good movie it does offer hope and inspiration. And the entire vibe that surrounds the Marines in this film, as stated earlier, is one that gives you hope that should something like this ever occur, there will be someone there standing ready to take on all comers and to defend us all. This is a movie that might be too violent for children but will be an entertaining night at the movies for all others.emy. There is joy when they can save someone.

B000000I0J|4.0|Mike Oldfield released something very very different with 1979's Platinum. What we have here is a drastic departure from his previous four albums.     \\"Airborn\\" starts off with... a surfer rock riff of some sorts, before morphing into some kind of atmospheric carnival music. Very strange, and different from anything I've ever heard before so I can't complain. Mike Oldfield's trademark magic feels like it's wearing off though, I can definitely hear THAT much about it. I'm not so sure we can blame the disco movement either. I just don't feel the emotional connection in Oldfield's instrumental work this time around, and it's surprising. I still *like* the song though- I like it a lot, in fact, especially the middle section.     Alright, the title song definitely feels like it was influenced by the disco scene with the repetitive and basic beats that dominated so many disco songs at the time, and the guitar riff (along with the vocals near the end) is totally reminiscent of the Alan Parsons Project. It's a good song, but several minutes of hardly any changes whatsoever wears a little thin, no doubt. Plus it just screams of typically generic late 70's cheese metal even though it's probably not fair to refer to it as a heavy metal song since it's not *that* heavy. It is based around a repetitive riff though.     \\"Charleston\\" is darn there unlistenable in spots thanks mainly to the brass instruments combined with the cheesy disco beats. Wow this is seriously one mightily unimpressive way to begin a song, haha. Oh well. At least it gets better during the second half when some rockabilly style keyboards (or whatever they are) comes into play. I like that part. Alright I enjoy \\"North Star/Platinum Finale\\". \\"Airborn\\" is probably the best song on the album, but this... this is something special. The moody beats really work amazingly well, and I even feel some sadness in the guitar playing that builds and builds. Cool track, even though repeated listens makes it seem less impressive each time. Hey, this isn't exactly a classic Mike Oldfield album anyway so who cares?     Now we enter side two... oh boy. Actually my only complaint about side two is that \\"Woodhenge\\" fails to do anything at all. It's all about atmosphere, and nothing else. What else *is* there to like about it? Perhaps it's a nice imitation of Pierre Moerlen's Gong, but there's nothing truly noteworthy about it besides that. \\"Sally\\" contains a really good female vocal melody, but it feels out of place on a Mike Oldfield album. I like the... synth solo? It's awesome actually. \\"Punkadiddle\\" has a REALLY cool instrumental section that doesn't really resemble anything I've ever heard before. The beat of the song reminds me of something whacky like uh... Devo maybe, but there's something incredibly bouncy and enjoyable about the instrumental work. This actually wouldn't be out of place on an old NES game, such as Star Tropics, Final Fantasy or who knows what else.     The final track \\"I Got Rhythm\\" ends the album on a rather quiet note with a somber vocal melody courtesy of... the female singer, hehe. I'm too darn lazy to look her name up, and there's nobody to blame for this but myself. For YEARS I've been saying \\"Whenever I get high speed internet, I will no longer be lazy\\" but oh man, I just got high speed last month and laziness just makes life so much easier, hehe. It's easier when other people do my job for me. Anyway, I like this song. It's a surprisingly normal way to end the album though.     Overall... alright guys. I WAS going to give Platinum a 3-star rating, but it eventually won me over enough to give it 4 stars. Plus there are a few interesting ideas here and there that make it stand out from most albums released in 1979.
030746363X|3.0|I believe a lot of what he has to say in the book (since it was already written by other authors) but he lost me at the whole \\"gain 34 pounds in 28 days without steroids\\" claim.  First of all, Timothy looks like he might weigh in at about 170lbs.  So he claims he weighed about 136 pounds before his 4 hour/month bodybuilding routine?  As a life-long athlete and body builder, I've witnessed many body builders struggle to gain 20 pounds of lean muscle while ON steroids.  This claim is completely bogus.    I also find it hilarious that some people have rebuked the theory that his assistants and friends were the primary \\"positive\\" reviewers on the first day the book was released.  They claim that in order to write a review, a person first has to buy the book.  This is 100% false.  I was given the book by someone I know and came on here to write my review without ever buying it.  So...the theory that this 4-hour scam artist had his assistants and colleagues write reviews is not far fetched. In fact, it's highly plausible.     Don't get me wrong...I believe there is a lot to gain from the information Tim has stolen from credible people and put in this book.  Just don't be suckered into believing the outlandish claims.  Gaining 34 pounds of muscle in 28 days without steroids and while only working out 4 hours per month is just short of impossible...PERIOD.    The ultimate shortcoming of this book is the outlandish claims (which he obviously figured were necessary to sell books and live a work-free life on the backs of morons who buy in to his crap).      Bottom line...He is a snake oil salesman.  Borrow the book or fetch a copy out of a dumpster.  DO NOT BUY IT.

030746363X|5.0|I'd never heard of Tim Ferriss or his previous book when I chanced upon The 4-Hour Body at my local Chapters. I bought it because I'd never come across anything like it before: diet and exercise protocols, sleep coaching, a swimming lesson and a little sex ed thrown in for good measure! The diet, if you stick to it, works very fast. I'm always trying new diets and I've never seen as rapid a change in my body as I have with Ferriss's protocol. I've lost weight and put on muscle with the diet alone. Amazing! I've already bought two additional copies for friends. I wholeheartedly recommend this book.
B000Q6GUTI|2.0|This is a stylish,tight conspiracy thriller.However it is ruined by the vocal style of Mark Wahlberg who delivers many of his lines in a rapid fire mumble, making many of the plot turns incomprehensible. The audience is forced to guess at what he is saying,particularly when some of his lines contain technical jargon.  In contrast, Danny Glover delivers his lines clearly and in a deep tone and is fully audible.
B000005RRP|4.0|After the triumph of In Rock, Purple offers up the second release with Gillan and Glover in the ranks, known as Fireball. At the time, critics and some in Purple's own camp thought it to be an inferior follow up and that the band had lost momentum from the heaviness of In Rock. In hindsight, I find Fireball to be just as essential in the evolution of Purple's recorded history, and I feel it fits rather nicely between In Rock and the proceeding Machine Head. The opening title track actually starts things off rather scorching(pun intended) and fast and features the basic formula of the band's newfound elements within the ensemble, notably the power of Blackmore and Lord in their respective solo spots and the chugging powerhouse drumming of Ian Paice. No No No follows in and although it almost sounds like a holdover from In Rock, there is a great feel to this funky blues number; not to mention some tasteful playing from Blackmore and Lord, respectively. Strange Kind of Woman was culled as the big single for inclusion on the US version of Fireball and is a classic number within the Deep Purple catalogue giving Blackmore a chance to show off some incredible soloing and would provide Gillan and Blackmore a perfect foil to stretch this number out in the live shows with a \\"call and response\\" arrangement between the two.    Demon's Eye is another Purple classic that continues the almost funky vibe that permeates throughout the duration of this album and could've been a good single had it been properly promoted as such. Anyone's Daughter offers up a quirky humorous tale of a young man influencing father's daughters into temptive carnal innuendoes; musically its the most \\"outside of the box\\" number on Fireball and is refreshingly different from most Purple numbers. The Mule would later provide a spot for Ian Paice to show off his percussion skills in the live shows and is a driving number that has lyics from Gillan in the beginning, but only an introductory verse; it remains one of Purple's most unconventional numbers.    Closing out the original release are Fools which is a bit of a spacey-jam type of number that seems a bit ponderous at times, but when it gets going, it has some power and depth, and No One Came which is actually one of my favorites within this lineup of the band. This track is one of those great lost numbers that  rivals Space Truckin and Smoke on the Water as far as quality and performance goes, and it really does provide an overall statement into the closing of the original Fireball album. The remaster with Roger Glover involved, is insightful and offers up 3 tracks in the forms of Freedom, Slow Train and I'm Alone. While interesting tracks they are, these numbers provide a bit more of outside the norm of Purple's collective repetoire and remain outtakes essentially. Following In Rock's remaster, Fireball features some updated remixes of Demon's Eye and No One Came which have a heavier, up front sound for the rhythm section and also have a more sonic quality(thanks ProTools!) which does provide Glover's intents to use updated digital technology to breathe new life into these older masters.     Overall, Fireball is an essential companion piece to In Rock, and is rightfully the bridge between that album and the proceeding Machine Head, which is considered Purple's most classic album. I like the transitional feel of Fireball and it is an underrated album to my ears, because it allowed the band room to experiment and expand a bit musically, despite the lack of fan support. 4 stars.
B004H4XLRE|3.0|We just bought this this afternoon, along with 10 of the new Cars cars. First off, stop packaging these types of toys with a cheap plastic car, it's not worth anything except as a cake decoration. The launcher part of this toy is OK, doesn't really get the cars very far, but my 3 year old seems to be OK with it, and can operate it by himself - a key aspect of any toy. I think it would do better with lighter cars than the Cars cars, like Hotwheels or Matchbox. The carrying case is a great idea, as we've yet to find a carrier that can carry some of the bigger cars like Mater, so this will be nice to be able to take with us to the grandparent's houses. Not sure how durable it is as we've only had it a few hours, but it IS plastic, so there's just no telling this soon.

1594202710|4.0|Firstly, Dr. Kissinger delivers an intelligent and well-constructed review of recent Chinese history. This is an indispensable read for any China novice wishing to better understand modern China and the intent of recent US policy. Clearly the former Secretary of State understands the political and strategic issues better than anyone and he has coupled his extensive personal experiences with very solid research.  However, the author's personal involvement in the evolution of the US-China relationship and to some extent his actual responsibility for the success of the modern Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has rendered this great statesman incapable of objectively evaluating the true nature of China's ruling elite, seeing the devastation that China's abusive trade strategy has wrought on American workers, considering the environmental disaster that China is inflicting on all of Asia, or being realistic about China's regional and strategic military threats. It isn't as though he doesn't know the facts, and occasionally he cites them, he just can't get any real world perspective on them because he simply hasn't been in the real world for a very long time.  For Dr. Kissinger, history is an abstract game of strategy played across fancy diplomatic dinner tables, parlors filled with overstuffed chairs, and magnificent conference rooms. He has been to China dozens of times over a forty-year period, but I'd doubt he has ever really walked the streets of a Chinese city alone much less spoken anonymously to a normal Chinese citizen. He's never felt the mud of rural China on his legs - unless perhaps he was helicoptered into somewhere for a photo op. From his ivory tower the prisoners in China's labor camps, the women subjected to forced abortions, those beaten and tortured for their political or religious beliefs, or the unemployed workers standing outside America's shuttered factories appear as mere pawns to be traded for the attainment of bigger strategic objectives in a captivating game of geopolitical intrigue.   Dr. Kissinger remains a tragic captive of meta-ethical relativism. He is simply unable to really see evil for what it is and would never dare to call it out in the way that braver men like Churchill or Reagan have. He can casually mention the millions who died during Mao's Great Leap Forward or suffered in the insanity of his Cultural Revolution and yet still fawn on the Chairman as a congenial host. The chapter in which Kissinger glosses over the massacre at Tiananmen without counting the dead - or even acknowledging why doing so remains impossible  - was particularly disturbing. He enumerates the body count in countless wars and uprisings before June 4, but finds this event worthy of a chapter only because he is compelled to - very weakly - justify the pathetic US policy reaction.  In his epilogue, Dr. Kissinger builds a careful, amoral analysis of China's rise as a mirror of Germany in the years before the First World War. That period of classic diplomacy is a great analogy for a strategy hound not wishing to be burdened by pesky ethical issues. He has carefully selected it to accommodate his natural tendency to moral equivalency. For example in this section he asserts that in the possibly emerging US-China cold war that \\"both sides would emphasis their ideological differences\\" as though they were equally valid or that consideration of their validity is too trivial to investigate. What the good doctor fails to confront is the fact that the current Chinese ideology is simply National Socialism with Chinese characteristics. This fundamental truth suggests the much more disturbing analogy of the years before the Second World War as the more apt analogy for this analysis, complete with the goose-stepping troops on review and a showboat political Olympic games.  Nonetheless, I highly recommend the book if for no other reason than it nicely summarizes the dominant policy paradigm that is currently leading the world toward the brink of disaster. As Sun Tzu wisely teaches, it is very important to understand your enemy and America's most dangerous enemy is China and our domestic China apologists.   The essence of all this is nicely summed up by a insightful comment from Deng Xiaopeng which Kissinger offers to us without a hint of irony:  \\"Your spokesmen have constantly justified and apologized for Soviet actions. Sometimes they say there are no signs to prove that there is the meddling of the Soviet Union and Cuba in the case of Zaire or Angola. It is no use for you to say so. To be candid with you, whenever you are about to conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union it is the product of concession on the U.S. side to please the Soviet Side.\\"    Greg Autry,      Coauthor, Death by China  [[ASIN:0132180235 Death by China: Confronting the Dragon - A Global Call to Action]]
0756404738|5.0|After reading his debut hit \\"The Name of The Wind\\", I knew I simply must read whatever words Rothfuss put down. While some of the polish of the first book is missing, \\"The Wise Man's Fear\\" maintains the same level of wonderful writing and fantastic story. Perhaps the change in book two isn't for the worse, but rather an evolution in both the story and Mr Rothfuss's writing. I look forward to reading the tales of Kvothe for years to come.
B003AVPV1O|5.0|Its a splitter, nothing more, nothing less.  It does its job.  Nice heavyweight construction, pins were straight, and plastic was well trimmed (at this price sometimes those are not givens frankly).

B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I enjoy urban fantasy, but as of late, haven't been able to find any new good authors to read.  I took a chance on this book based on the reviews, and I found it surprisingly good.  Other than the usual stereotypic sex scenes, the plot was interesting and the characters were also good.  Other reviewers can give you a more in-depth look at the book, but I wanted to add my vote to the five stars.<br /><br />This is a paranormal romance novel rather than an urban fantasy and as such, I've decided in the four years since I first read it, it is probably the best paranormal romance novel I've ever read. I don't claim to have read hundreds, but this stands up as the best of those I have read. (I love both Ilona Andrews and Patricia Briggs as urban fantasy writers, but they don't really do P.R.) I haven't liked all of Harrison's novels set in this world as well, but they are all worth reading. She also does an excellent job with her short stories set in the same world.<br /><br />(Speaking of sex scenes, is there some rule in urban fantasy that the first sex scene between the main characters has to start with him pulling her hands above her head and then taking both her wrists in one of his hands so he could do various things with the other hand?  I can't tell you how many times I've read this in books.  Someone please tell urban fantasy authors to come up with another scenario.  I roll my eyes every time I read it.)
B0057URWSQ|4.0|So I enjoyed watching Suits enough to order the whole season, and it was fun and captivating, and the characters drew me into their lives.  This isn't a wholly unique show, as the characters are similar to other people we've seen on TV.  It's got the super attractive slick Harvard lawyer and the almost-was-a-deadbeat genius fighting against the corporate machine, sort of a Rags-to-Riches-to-beat-Goliath story, but it's written well enough and the actors are fantastic enough that it's worth watching.
B001PJRAUS|3.0|Concur with other reviews that the main character Amanda is rather crude (some unnecessary references with Lydia and Caroline Bingley) and should have tried to fit in more with Regency life since she was so enamored of \\"Pride & Prejudice\\". And no real explanation was given for why Lizzy was gone so long, especially abandoning Jane in her time of trial. But I found myself intrigued by the differences of the characters and kept watching to see how it would turn out. I almost thought Amanda would end up with Wickham (the not so bad guy) and of course, assumed Elizabeth would end up with Darcy so the end was kind of strange. But I admit to the guilty pleasure of enjoying the interpretation. I think it could have been better, with less crudity, more attempts by Amanda to really fit in, and a more \\"Austen like\\" ending, but it was fun nevertheless.
B00005AQE8|5.0|I grew up while rap was taking hold of the world. Like Tupac I was born in NYC but raised in Northern Cali. I was in NYC when RUN DMC was breaking out in 1983 and break dancing was breaking out in basements on linoleum in the hood. RUN DMC changed the game and pushed rap to the front of music as a truly viable format. Fast forward to 1990...rap was at a cross road. East Coast Rap was suffering an identity crisis with New Jack Swing as the main driving force of the time.<br /><br />Enter the dominance of West Coast Rap. NWA/Easy E,Ice Cube,Too $hort, Ice T and others out West were blazing trials and putting their own stamp on what originated in the East.<br /><br />Enter Tupac Shakur. His mainstream beginnings were humble as a stage hand with Digital Underground, however, he was someone that was destined for much more than that. I grew up in Santa Rosa, CA where Tupoc first got started with a group called Strictly Dope w/Ray Luv. I was able to watch first hand as Pac went from aspiring artist to becoming \\"The\\" greatest rapper of all time!<br /><br />In the beginning Pac captured his audience with gripping social commentary pieces like \\"Brenda's got a baby\\" and \\"Trapped\\" on 2Pacalypse Now. These works showed the world the mind and soul that Pac had. He wasn't just the \\"King\\" of Thug Life. He is/was the product of the civil rights movement that had been hijacked and derailed by crack cocaine and had lost it's way. His raps are/were mobilizing and teaching tools.<br /><br />Before joining Death Row Tupoc reached the pinnacle of Rap solo artist success with \\"Me Against The World\\". And, to be balanced and  fair, Biggie was re-establishing true street inspired hip-hop on the East Coast along the same lines the West had established in the early 90's. In the process, the heated East Vs. West Coast War began. The classic teacher vs. student battle was born. Both sides had their claim to the crown. With the East as the originators and the West as the progressors and game changers (Come on...say what you want but rap is still ruled by Gangsta Rap....Jay-Z included).<br /><br />As Tupac evolved he became the voice of young black males through-out America. His works became more to the point and gritty as he told the underside story of what life was like for a YBM at that time and still to this day. Unfortunately, America didn't like what it had created and what it heard from it's ghetto children.<br /><br />All Eyez on Me is Tupac's Cestine Chapel. This piece is timeless.  Every track plays it's role and while a few are sleepers amongst the mega-hits this IS Pac at his best. In fact, no matter what has happened since.....the rest of the rap game is still in awe of this album! Tupac claimed the title and crown with this album....PERIOD! He wrote the blue-print and changed the game eternally. If you don't believe me, why did Bad Boy/Biggie release Life After Death as a double album? Poc is/and was the \\"King\\". I am a true hip-hop purest and while I'm older now I'll be 21 forever when I listen to this masterpiece. While I can admit that Jay-Z is the $hizz and that he is a true \\"legend\\", nevertheless, he is reigning King by default.<br /><br />Pac is Jordan. The rest are not.<br /><br />Peace.

B0041KKYEM|2.0|As a heady topic, a journey into madness is a familiar and welcome portrait in the land of   celluoid that is Hollywood. There are many fine examples of this type of genre in which the  subject is treated with sensitivity and are well informed as opposed to those films that display   all manner of hysteria and perpetuate the pop-myths that surround mental illnesses, which,   may well be well intentioned, do more harm than good.  Then there are films which are there simply to entertain through the medium to convey what is  nothing more than a fairy story. Stories like the Swan Lake for example.  For sheer entertainment value - with the shock and the horror, with all its Gothic creepiness,   with things that go bump (and grind) in the night; with enough melodrama and pathos that   Tchaikovsky himself would have relished and applauded. I was even waiting for Freddy Kruger to  make an appearance toward the end.  Portman runs the gamut of emotions from A to B which makes for a disturbing and somewhat amusing  viewing on the (very) odd occasion; the dancing, however, was a joy.  Two stars for the ballet.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I got my 30 day shred DVD today and I was itching to try it out. I first did 45 mins of kick boxing (some other DVD) and then did Level 1 of 30 day shred. It was the best decision as my body was already warm by the time I started this and  I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed it. I am really looking forward to doing it. Best bang for the buck. My knees did not hurt, I am an intermediate exerciser, still, this was quite challenging. Love Jillian and the way she motivates us.    Here is an update!! I have been doing 30 day shred for the past 2 weeks, I have lost 2 lbs and inches off my body. One thing that I have noticed is that, even though the scale sometimes refuses to budge, you still lose inches and you can actually see your body transform in front of your eyes. I love this DVD!!
B0012IWHDW|5.0|There is probably no other Western film of the last half-century that is as fatigue-ridden as director Sam Peckinpah's 1973 opus PAT GARRETT AND BILLY THE KID.  A dark and (not surprisingly, given its director) violent take on that great New Mexico legend, filmed under terrible conditions in Durango, Mexico, the film, besides being noted for Peckinpah's typically ornery and hard-nosed approach to film and a cast willing to break down the gates of hell for him, was also known for something else: the place where music legend Bob Dylan not only made his official acting debut as the drifter known as Alias, but where he also did the film's acoustic folk/country music score.  The soundtrack album did a lot better in commercial and artistic terms than the film itself, which was unfortunately mangled by the uncaring studio execs at MGM, and which became a success only in retrospect, and only after Peckinpah had died.<br /><br />It should be said that Dylan was only bought into the film as a lark by Kris Kristofferson, who portrayed Billy in the film, and not as the one who would actually score the film itself; Peckinpah had originally intended to leave that aspect to his own choice of film composer, the terribly underrated Jerry Fielding, who had already copped two Oscar nominations for THE WILD BUNCH in 1969 and STRAW DOGS in 1971, both of which were Peckinpah films.  Apparently, though, Dylan, unaware of the veteran composer's history of being a survivor of the anti-Communist blacklist of the 1950s, rubbed Fielding the wrong way, incredibly considering the composer too \\"establishment\\"; and Fielding left the project, leaving things in Dylan's hands.<br /><br />All the same, however, and despite Dylan's lack of experience in the field of motion picture music, he was able to capture the bleak and rootless essence of PAT GARRETT as a whole, working with good friends of his like Booker T. Jones, Terry Paul (Kristofferson's bass player), and ex-Byrds front man Roger McGuinn onone of the better \\"rock\\" music scores for a movie.  Along with the jaunty and bluegrass-influenced \\"Turkey Chase\\" (in the scene where Dylan and Kristofferson chase turkeys, while a Mexican compadre of theirs [Jorge Russek] gets killed by hired gunmen), and \\"Final Theme\\", which so accurately depicts how Fate, in the form of James Coburn's Pat Garrett, is closing in on Billy, there is the never-to-be-forgotten anthem \\"Knocking On Heaven's Door\\", heard over the scene in which Slim Pickens' Sheriff Baker, having been mortally wounded in a shootout, stares out at the Pecos River in his dying moments as his wife (Katy Jurado) looks on with a mixture of happiness and sadness in her eyes.  Not surprisingly, it became a substantial hit for Dylan, reaching #12 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the late summer of 1973; and the album itself became one of Dylan's biggest selling albums, at a time when his impact was still at an all-time high.<br /><br />Though it only amounts to 36 minutes of music in all, Dylan's PAT GARRETT score remains one of the best Western film scores of modern times, and is one of those albums of its time when rootsy country and folk music had slipped back into rock after being submerged by the 1960s cultural wars.  It first helps to see the movie it goes with (in its uncut state, PAT GARRETT is an absolute masterpiece) before hearing Dylan's soundtrack on its own.  The end result is nothing short of astounding.
0316113506|5.0|\\"Spark\\" is truly a remarkable book written by an inspired author.  The connection between mind and body that this author is able to point out further reveals how the body functions in a holistic and not reductionistic way.  The only revelation that the author fails to have, is that exercise and body movement should not be viewed as any sort of \\"treatment\\" or \\"therapy\\" for those who are depressed or anxious, etc.  Everyone requires a certain amount of activity/exercise to fully express their health potential.  Viewed through the holistic lens (which is the correct one), it is easy to see that exercise or activity is not a therapy, but rather a necessary ingredient for health similar to a genetically congruent diet or sufficient social interaction/engagement.  Dr. Ratey is on the verge of seeing this reality, but ultimately falls short.  However, it is still a superb book and I highly recommend it to all.
B00006RAKP|4.0|Elton John's Greatest Hits 1970-2002 is a pretty good 2-disc collection, primarily of Elton's greatest hits, but is missing a few blaring omissions, most notably \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\", \\"Pinball Wizard\\", and my all-time favorite Elton song, \\"Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding\\", which starts most of his concerts. I'm sure the eleven minute plus running time led to the omission, but no Elton collection should be complete without this song. Also some lesser known fan favorites are missing like \\"Club at the End of the Street\\", \\"Blue Eyes\\", and \\"Roy Rogers\\". Ideally, it should've been a three-disc set, but as two disc sets go, this is pretty good (especially the first disc, which includes his hits from 1970-1976 and is track after track of good music).    Not a bad purchase, I just think it's missing some tracks that prevent it from getting a five out of five in my book.

0807014273|5.0|I don't think I have ever read a book where someone has written what is so true to me about the essential truths of life.  What makes this book so different is the background of total adversity in which it was written.  Viktor E Frankl in the face of almost certain death on a daily if not minute by minute basis still found within himself the ability to help his fellows, particularly those who had given up and were considering suicide.  In the book he said and I quote \\"When we are no longer able to change a situation... We are challenged to change ourselves.\\"    It was this quote which attracted me to this great man and I recommend him to you. As a result of reading Man's Search For Meaning I am now including this book as a mandatory read in The Sun Chi Healing course and system.
B0053Q9DHW|2.0|I have watched many versions of Jane Eyre over the years, and having read somewhere that Michael Fassbender had watched Toby Stephens' performance in the Mastepiece Theater version to help him as Rochester, my hopes were high...maybe too high. The Toby Stephens version surpassed this film by leaps and bounds and anyone who hasn't seen it should make it a point to do so.  I kept waiting to see and feel any passion between Jane and Rochester in this version...and never felt it.  It was as if they were just delivering lines and their characters were never fleshed out.  It lacked the passion and yearning that I have seen in other versions, and Michael Fassbender doesn't even come close to delivering a Rochester with  the depth and scope that Toby Stephens did.  I currently own 6 versions, and I don't forsee adding this one to my collection.  Anyone wanting to see a good version should first see the Mastepiece Theater version with Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens.  A close second, in my opinion, would be Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke, followed by A&E's version with Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds and then the previous big screen version with William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg.  I own other versions, but have never watched them more than once...and I would include this new production among those that I wouldn't give a second viewing.

0345457684|5.0|A friend and colleague recommended I pick up a copy of Altered Carbon by Richard K. Morgan.  As we talked over drinks, he described the book as a dark detective sci-fi novel, gritty in its dialogue and action.  After reading, I have to agree.  Altered Carbon ranks up there as one of my favorite sci-fi reads.  The settings and use of technology fascinated me, and I missed a number of the twists that took place throughout the story.<br /><br />The general story revolves around one Takeshi Kovacs who is hired to determine whether a person's death was a murder or a suicide.  Who's he hired by? The victim... who is very much alive.  In the 25th century, a person's consciousness can be (and most often is) stored in a memory device implanted in the body.  When the physical body dies/quits working, a person can be reloaded into a new body in a procedure called \\"resleeving.\\"  That makes for a strange definition of death, with penalties for crimes often set as a number of years where you are \\"offline.\\"<br /><br />Kovacs is a trained soldier modified for warfare, but he ran afoul of the law and is doing time offline.  He is resleeved for this investigation with the promise that he will be given a new body if he accepts the case and solves the crime.  Otherwise, back to the stack.  Kovacs quickly finds that far too many people would prefer this case remain closed and ignored, including some people very close to the victim.  Of course, all the resistance has the opposite effect on Kovacs, and he's willing to put his own life on the line to uncover the truth... or at least whatever the truth should look like to make everything work out OK for himself.<br /><br />It was probably a given that I would like this, as I normally enjoy sci-fi stories that have a strong cyber element to them.  This book certainly qualifies on that account.  There are countless examples of cyber-technology, artificial intelligence entities, body modifications, etc. The story is told in first-person from Kovacs' perspective, and his dark hard-edged personality sets the tone for everything that happens.  All the characters are complex and deep, and there are plenty of angles and edges that keeps the story moving.<br /><br />In short, Altered Carbon was a fascinating read, and an incredible effort for Morgan's first novel.  I'm pretty sure this won't be the last book of his that I end up reading...<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Library<br />Payment: Borrowedd his dark hard-edged personality sets the tone for everything that happens.

B003L20IFQ|4.0|This must be one of the cheapest movies ever made. One actor, a supporting actress in a minimal but traumatic scene, a very limited space, a cell phone, a lighter, a torch, some other light devices, a pencil, a folding knife, a flask, some sand, a snake, some voices on the phone, some other noises from the outside, there you are.<br />Is it a thriller? Sure, it has plenty of suspense.<br /><br />Is it a war movie? Sure, in the sense that it is a story in Iraq and involving war action, though there are no soldiers in it. The sole actor is a truck driver employed by a contractor. The supporting actress is a colleague of his.<br />Is it an anti-war movie? Sort of. The conversations between the hero and his captor, and also with his outside contacts have a touch of criticism of the Iraq invasion. The hero certainly doesn't know why he is there, apart from the need for a job.<br /><br />It is strongly anti-corporate. The villain of the piece is not just the captor/extortionist/terrorist, who is given some consideration of justification, but mainly the man's employer, the private contractor for services in the war zone.<br />The phone `interview' that the head of personnel does, on tape, from the US HQ, with the employee trapped in a box under ground in Iraq, is among the most cruel and sadistic scenes about corporate life that I have ever seen. Or make that `listened to'.<br />(The snake scene is stupid. No need for that. Exotic locations seem to require snakes in the script.)<br /><br />This is not an edifying film, and it will not make you sleep better.
078401020X|5.0|Basic Instinct is laced with Hitchcock influence. The music enriches the crime thriller, something akin to Psycho perhaps, certainly in the car journey sequences along that Californian coastal road. The film's sexual tension builds slowly. When it erupts, it contributes to the story rather than being a digression. Apart from murder, this movie is about obsession as well as love. An underlying theme is about friendship and teamwork in the police department. People who work in organisations witness cliques and cabals; it's part of an organization's life. Here, the core team members support each other despite some hefty disagreements and external threats. Sharon Stone is at her sultry best, not only with her body and persona but also, her voice. Michael Douglas is convincing as the unstable policeman. As in so many films, love might be the conclusion? If not seen already, watch the film and answer that question. There is a reason to pose it.  Ian Hunter.

B003VTZSFY|5.0|Something strange was afoot. A mere geographer, Jared Diamond, had had the temerity to publish a history book, upending centuries of historians' speculations about the reasons why civilization first developed in the Middle East. It was 2005, and the book was Guns, Germs, and Steel.<br /><br />Five years later an archaeologist, Ian Morris, wrote another history book (for the general reader!) called Why the West Rules -- for Now. Building on Diamond's thesis, Morris laid out his own, more comprehensive view of the course of human history, reaching back 15,000 years and venturing into the 22nd Century.<br /><br />While many historians still engaged in the stale debate about whether \\"Great Men\\" or social forces are dominant in history, Diamond and Morris convincingly laid out the case for the greater influence of the larger context in which human history takes place, delving not just into geography but also (in Morris' case) into biology, sociology, and archaeology. In fact, Morris has little patience for the Great Man Theory of History: \\"the most that any of these great men/bungling idiots did was to speed up or slow down processes that were already under way. None really wrestled history down a whole new path. Even Mao, perhaps the most megalomaniac of all, only managed to postpone China's industrial takeoff.\\"<br /><br />As you may surmise, this is not a dry college textbook. Just for example, the author advances what he calls, tongue in cheek, the \\"Morris Theorem\\" that \\"Change is caused by lazy, greedy, frightened people looking for easier, more profitable, and safer ways to do things. And they rarely know what they're doing.\\" There are times when the pace drags, as when Morris follows the endless rise and fall of Chinese dynasties, but on the whole the book is lively and eminently readable.<br /><br />Like Diamond, Morris set out to understand why what today is called \\"the West\\" has dominated the planet for at least the past two centuries. The standard historical explanation is that sometime around 1800, the Industrial Revolution caused a sharp increase in development in Europe and North America. As Morris explains, however, \\"this upturn was itself only the latest example of a very long-term pattern of steadily accelerating social development.\\" In Why the West Rules, he explores the state of society and the quality of life in both West and East since long before the onset of written history in the first millennium BCE -- in fact, since the passing of the last Ice Age 15,000 years ago. With a four-factor analytical tool of his own, Morris measures \\"social development\\" since then in each of the two broad regions a thousand years at a time, concluding that \\"the West has been the most developed region of the world for fourteen of the last fifteen millennia.\\" (His four benchmarks are \\"energy capture, urbanization, information technology, and war-making capacity.\\")<br /><br />It is that exception -- a period of about 1,200 years from the Sixth Century until the 18th, when the West finally wrested itself out of the legacy of the Dark Ages - that Morris seizes upon to refute those who assert that the West has always \\"ruled\\" and is destined to do so forever.<br /><br />As telegraphed in his subtitle (The Patterns of History, and What They Reveal About the Future), Morris's ultimate goal is to discern the shape of times to come. His conclusion is noncommittal: \\"The great question for our times is not whether the West will continue to rule. It is whether humanity as a whole will break through to an entirely new kind of existence before disaster strikes us.\\"<br /><br />To be precise, Ian Morris has been a Professor of Classics and History at Stanford for more than 15 years. However, he describes himself as an archaeologist and his interests are clearly more expansive than those of the typical college history teacher. In Why the West Rules, he draws upon insights and examples from science fiction, popular film and television shows, and from his own personal experience on excavations in Sicily.<br /><br />([...])icily.

Therefore, we exist simply because the arrangement of atoms that makes us up is a possible arrangement of the universe. The idea can be compounded on greatly, but not the way Lanza did. He takes this interesting idea in quantum physics (which is not as new as he insists), and turns it into his semi-religious \\"life created itself\\". The book is very repetitive, mostly made up of stories of him \\"connecting\\" with other life and realizing there must be some bigger picture. This is entirely a quantum-physical idea, yet he devotes just one chapter (more like half) to it. Don't buy.
B0041C8TME|5.0|I picked this up so that I could make better use of the features added in the new firmware. There's not much to say about it aside from the fact that with this housing you can now plug in the USB to charge while in use and you can also access video output without removing it from the housing. A minor side-effect benefit that I've noticed is that it seems to improve the quality of audio in all but the windiest conditions.
B000002JPA|4.0|This is of course one of their best albums if not the best. Its magical with a variety of good feelings and most importantly they know how to play music. This album is a seminar to all guitarists players. The melodies are fantastic and you really miss out if you haven't heard this album. The only disadvantage in a way is that is too technically and you may want to hear some times before you get used to it as i did.Either way just buy this album. Its a must for progressive metal fans.
1599218011|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said?! It's a cheeky book filled with inspiration and great advice. Great guide to healthy living. You may not always like to hear what she says (especially if you love your meat and dairy), but it all makes sense. I have been juicing everyday for 6 months, and just started with wheatgrass. I eat very little meat. I was already doing some of this stuff on my own, but when I stumble (i.e. start drinking java again) this is a great reminder to pick back up. I haven't tried to detox yet, but I'm getting there. She also turned me on to therapeutic grade essential oils. I haven't slept this well in years.  Thank you!!!!!!
B002KKCWN6|5.0|I bought these for my husband who has bunions on both big toes.  He has a hard time finding shoes comfortable.  These replaced a pair of Columbia sandals I bought for him a few years ago.  He wore them at the lake the day he got them and he says they are comfortable.  They look very well made - good quality sandal, especially for water.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|Super 8 began last year with a marketing campaign that provided a general idea of what to expect from the film while revealing nothing. As the trailers became only slightly more revealing, the comparisons to Spielberg began. It's no secret that Steven Spielberg produced the film, so this comparison may seem easy but it is an inarguable fact that this film would not exist without his influence. Super 8 is the offspring of films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T., and The Goonies but it never feels like a derivative cash-in and actually succeeds in taking moviegoers back to a time when the \\"summer blockbuster\\" meant something; a time when a good story went hand-in-hand with special effects and action sequences. There are two types of movies here and writer/director J.J. Abrams does a refreshing job balancing them both rather than letting the action overtake the story. Its adolescent characters, military villains, and late 70s, small town setting evoke memories of Spielberg but writer/director J.J. Abrams brings enough originality to the project that it's less of a rehash than a renaissance.     The film takes place in the fictional town of Lillian, Ohio in 1979. 13-year-old Joe Lamb (Joel Courtney in an impressive debut) is helping his group of friends make a Super 8 movie at an old train depot. To the group's enjoyment, the \\"director\\" Charles (Riley Griffiths) has convinced local girl Alice (Elle Fanning) to drive them to the depot and appear in the movie. As they're shooting, a train appears in the distance and, in moments, is derailed by a pickup truck....And, for the purpose of preserving the surprise element; I'll leave it at that.    Is the \\"secret\\" at the heart of the film really a secret anymore? Most people have enough information to deduce what's going on, but the less you know the better. It's all part of the effect Super 8 has. There are plenty of special effects and action sequences, but Abrams allows his film to build nicely before revealing what he has in store. Unlike most recent summer blockbusters, the action is never brainless; it serves a purpose and functions for the story as opposed to an excuse to show the advancements in technology. The first big special effects sequence is the train crash, which is one of the most intense, exciting sequences you're likely to come across this year. You may question the physics behind it, but you can't deny the heart-racing excitement it inspires nor can you deny the stunning special effects that made it possible.    Super 8 really succeeds where most summer movies fail by delivering strong writing, with a good story and well-developed characters in addition to all the action. While Abrams may go for easy emotional cues his story has a lot of heart and Super 8 succeeds extensively on its likable, well-defined characters and human story. The story never feels like a backdrop for the action, a practice Hollywood has inexplicably embraced recently. Abrams obviously has an eye for casting as well. The adolescent actors in the lead roles are a talented, funny, and emotive group that convincingly embody their characters and never seem amateurish or annoying. The adult actors do fine jobs too, but the adults aren't as well-defined as the children are. Joe's dad, Deputy Jackson Lamb (Kyle Chandler) is the anguished, withdrawn father who steps in when things get messy while Colonel Nelec (Noah Emmerich) is the typical stone-faced military villain. This is a minor flaw that doesn't affect the overall quality of the film. Finally, it captures the 1979, small-town vibe wonderfully adding a very \\"classic feel\\" and is a great looking film in general; moody, nostalgic, and, yes, \\"Spielbergian.\\"    Super 8 does not disappoint on any level and is what a summer blockbuster should aspire to be. It is consistently entertaining, riveting from start to finish, and a wonderful reminder of the magic that's been missing from the movies. While it may be too soon to make such a bold statement, Super 8 seems destined to become a classic of its genre. J.J. Abrams is forging quite the career. It is impressive enough that he has made a special-effects heavy, science-fiction, summer film for a remarkably low $45 million at a time when the box office is overrun with movies with triple-digit budgets and double-digit IQs. Even more impressive is that he has fashioned a special-effects heavy, science-fiction, summer film that is one of the best films of this year.    GRADE: A

B000256TD0|5.0|I am mainly writing this review to balance out some of the inaccurate statements made by other reviewers here.    First of all, you don't need a magnifying glass to enjoy this model. It is much bigger than a 'matchbox' car, although they do make much bigger BTTF models, this Delorean is about seven inches long (as stated in the product description). The detailing for a model of this size is decent.    Second, this model does not light up or make sounds (as one reviewer claimed). There is a larger BTTFII model that does these things, but this is not that model!    My only complaints about this model are as follows:    First, the Mr. Fusion component comes as an attachment (it is such a tiny piece and it never 'came off' in the movie, so I'm not sure why they would include it as an attachment and not just make it a permanent part of the car... I think the reason is based on the fact that the BTTFI model came with a detachable lightning rod; which made perfect sense because the lightning rod was an attachment in the film. I suppose the manufacturers just wanted to continue that tradition of having an attachment).    Second, the stupid license plate says \\"OUTATIME\\". This is what the license plate said in BTTF Part I, and even then it only said it until the first time we ever saw the Delorean travel through time (remember it spinning on the ground after Einstein went forward one minute through time?). In BTTF Part II, Doc gets a license plate from the future and its a barcode plate! They really missed the boat on this detail and its disapointing!    Many people complain that the wheels don't turn down on this model; that is a valid complaint, but it doesn't really bother me personally. I just accept it as a consequence of the size of this model. If you want the wheels to go down, you'll have to get the bigger model.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Love this series and the company that shipped it was great.  This TV series is a must see though by far best zombie show/movie thing ever!
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|What is it about Zomebies that makes them so appealing nowadays? As one that loves the classic monster movies, Zombies are the new kids on the block. They became a hit with the cult-classic \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" back in 1968. Back then, Zombies were reanimated dead people that had an insatiable craving for human brains. They were slow fumbling \\"simple\\" folk. As other people made Zombie movies, each writer, director, and producer added their own twists on what it was to be one of the undead. Of crouse the biggest inside joke was that in all the movies, they are never called \\"Zombies\\".     Today, Zombies have a cool factor about them. They have even starred in extremely hilarious cult movies such as Zombieland, Shaun of the Dead, and Fido. Now the cable channel AMC has brought back an entirely new Zombie story and for the first time, they are at the heart of an episodic television show. The first season of \\"The Walking Dead\\" was truly landmark TV and something TV viewers are so desperate to have. It's unique, compelling, and highly entertaining. My only lament is that the first season was only six episodes long.     So what makes it so special? Well for one, like all good science fiction, it's about the human condition and our society set in a fantastic fictional setting. A sheriff is shot in action and slips into a coma. When he wakes up, the hospital has become a wild abandoned haunted house with things that go bump in the night locked behind chained doors. When he gets up and gets out, he discovers his home town almost deserted. He makss a bee line to his home where he discovers his wife and son have packed up thier most precious belongings and fled, He then meets a man and his son that have been surviving the \\"zombie-pocolypse\\" that bring him up to speed on what's gone on. There has been a deadly virus that once it kills you, it reanimates your body into a mindless flesh-eater. The rumor has it a lot of people have fled to nearby Atlanta for sanctuary, so ourSheriff goes to his local precinct, loads up for bear, and heads for Atlanta. Once there, he meets up with a reg-tag band of survivors and this is where the great dynamic begins.     The survivors are a cross-section of Americana, complete with all its flaws. The only thing they have in common is that they want to survive. This is what makes Walking Dead stand out amoung all the other zombie stories. It reminds me of what I thought made the recent version of Battlestar Galactica so great. Its not about the Zombies, its about the human condition. The Zombies are there to present an on-going crisis that compells tha central characters on to confront their frailties and issues. The stories and scripts are so well written, I am going to be quite upset if this off-beat show is not nominated for an Emmy for its writing.     Also, it's writers are not afraid to take risks and just like Battlestar, everyone is at risk. People die and they have made it quite clear that no one, even its central characters, are safe from death or zombification. Another thing I quite liked is that so much was packed into these six episodes, it seems like a series that had twice the number of episodes. The pacing is extrordinary and while it's never overpwoering, it moves at a brisk pace. Also, when the last scenes have played out in the final episode of the season, it is a great ending that not only leaves the door open for Season 2, but it clears the slate so that anything can happen.     This is must-see TV and I highly reccommend anyone that can get past the concept of Zombies to watch this series. I can not wait until Seaosn 2 airs.
B004QK5N5W|5.0|I was giving a presentation about Google and had an accompanying slide show to use.  I bought this cord, plugged it into my iPad 2 and my portable HDTV and voila!  It worked like a charm. When I worked at the community college, I didn't need this kind of equipment.  The classroom had a complete audio-visual-high tech console. Now that I'm retired though, I give presentations in places which have no such equipment.  Many other educators have this same problem.  A portable HDTV, an iPad 2 and this cord will end those problems in an instant. This is not the sole use by any means but perhaps not one as easily seen by all those users now evaluating the iPad 2 and what it can do for them professionally.  Great buy!!!!!

B004EPYZOO|1.0|I have always regarded Nicolas Cage as  a terrific actor.  His talents are wasted in this vulgar, pointless and just plain awful attempt at a horror movie.  If you like Nicolas Cage, action flicks or well done horror plots better skip this one.
044654759X|5.0|The cover of Safe Haven proclaims that the book is an \\"epic love story\\" (I'd love to know how Nicholas took that) and I would agree with that proclamation. Safe Haven is a really brilliant love story, introducing us to Katie, a girl who has rocked up in Southport leaving people wondering where she's come from. Alex, owner of the biggest store in Southport, finds himself wondering about Katie, and the two slowly get to know each other. Alex recently lost his wife, Carly, and is struggling to bring up his two kids and Katie has a secret, something she doesn't want anybody to know. I liked that Safe Haven eschewed all of the normal love story rules. Katie and Alex's relationship progresses at a nice, steady pace and at no time during the book did they mess each other about. There are so few traditional love stories in Chick Lit that Nicholas Sparks provides a nice distraction.<br /><br />There were darker undertones to the novel, and I thought Sparks handled them sensitively. I'd guessed Katie's secret, as I suppose many will, but it's well written and it didn't necessarily bother me that I already knew. I don't want to give too much away because although I knew what was going to happen and I'd guessed it, I still enjoyed the way Sparks presented it and there were many little surprises I enjoyed learning as I was reading. The novel is probably predictable in more ways than one, but for me, I got into it easily from the first page and I constantly wanted to pick it up and read yet another chapter. It was such a really easy read, despite some of the darker moments (particularly as those darker moments were incredibly absorbing). A lot of romance/Chick Lit fans worried Sparks isn't there cup of tea should pick up Safe Haven because you will be proved wrong. I can't say that's the same for his other novels, though I'm sure I'll soon find out.<br /><br />I found the characters to be very well presented and very easy to like. Katie grabbed me from page one, with her hesitancy and her want for secrecy. Her life isn't perfect and she isn't perfect but I liked her straight away. I wanted to protect her from what she was running from and I wanted her to get a happy ever after. I also really loved Alex. It was so easy to feel sympathy to him as his wife had passed away and he found himself not only with a store to run but two small children to look after. I found his kids Josh and Kristen to be totally adorable; I'm not a big fan of children but I could have totally kidnapped those two as they were so sweet. Katie makes friends with her next door neighbour Jo and I was incredibly surprised about what we learned about her and I liked her too. I know, I know, I sound like a broken record. I do apologise. The one character I didn't like in any way was Kevin. He was an awful, awful person. Memorable, very memorable, but horrible.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed Safe Haven. The ending is very fast-paced and I found myself constantly reading, reading, reading so I could finish it and see how it was all going to end. It was frantic, hectic, and I just couldn't put it down. Nicholas Sparks is a hugely enjoyable author, I loved Safe Haven and I'll certainly be picking up more of Sparks' work. There's no shame that he's a romance author, his love stories are traditional and I can see why he's so popular and why a lot of his novels are made into movies. I can see Safe Haven becoming a movie very easily and I would certainly go out and see it should it come to fruition. Safe Haven was just a wonderful read, it made me believe in love (corny, right?) and I wanted Katie and Alex to be together forever, becoming a new, happy family. Any one wondering if Sparks is worth purchasing, my answer is yes. He's a brilliant author and I'm a convert now!or secrecy.

0756404738|4.0|Rothfuss' first novel was a brilliant read from start to finish, with pithy tight pacing, lyrical prose in poetically limited use and characters who were compelling and mysterious.  The flashback narrative juxtaposing a hopeless \\"now\\" against the powerful potential of the past kept the reader asking: \\"What happened?\\"    Unfortunately, we don't find out in a \\"Wise Man's Fear\\".  The questions of the first novel remain unresolved in the second.  \\"Wise Man\\" is the classic quest novel of the young man out to find his identity.  The book might better have been titled \\"Kvothe's Gap Year\\".  He wanders here, he wanders there, Kvothe just wanders everywhere.  First a lover, then a martial arts expert, then an avenging agent of his people.  A problem with Kvothe's wandering is that some of the characters we've come to love receive little attention and the story is poorer without their presence.    Worse yet, Ruthfuss brings in sidebar stories dismissed with offhand comments in a few paragraph; one wonders if Ruthfuss found the book too long so cut out some detail or if it will appear a decade from now as a stand alone novel of Kvothe.      Still, Ruthfuss is an good SF writer. He avoids the pitfall of introducing myriad central characters to confuse and dull the narrative.  Ruthfuss keeps Kvothe centre stage, complex and tightly written.  The author's writing style remains vivid and strong even if the plot advancement of a Wise Man's Fear tests a Loyal Reader's patience.
6302649943|4.0|This film scared the tar out of me as a child! I wasn't always afraid of clowns, even Killer Klowns from Outer Space was good...to me. Admittedly I haven't read the book, now more than ever, I'd like to. I have both formats of this film, vhs and DVD. The DVD is tolerable, except they took out Pennywise's demonic cackle at the end of part one, and with part two, the opening credits being removed wasn't really an issue, but taking out the first 5+ minutes didn't sit well with me. I hope with the remakes release that they'll restore it properly, and re-release it of course.  Now, is the film worth watching if you haven't read the book? Honestly, I don't know yet, but w/out reading it myself and doing extensive research on the book, I can say that for a tv-movie, miniseries, it was pretty well done, the special f/x are oddly convincing...for their time anyway, in the time they had, they covered what they could and added a few scenes not even in the novel. Eddie's shower scene was pretty creepy though, made me terrified of taking a shower for months afterwards! I saw it for the first time at 12 years old, thinking I couldn't be scared. Boy! I was dead wrong! Final note: the remake seems unnessasary, considering the creators are trying to cram the movie at under two hours, how can they do the book justice w/out making it at least 2 parts, 2 hours each, we'll see.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|This is an incredibly well written book. It is NOT at all for dog/animal lovers only. It is a book about humanity and the power of positive thinking and the test of inner strength. It is sad at times but this book has a beautiful and magical ending that left me in tears. Happy tears! If like me you are looking for a good engrossing book that yes, has some sad circumstances as real life does, but also has the magic that few books mention these days then this unforgettable book is for you. It is full of hope. I love Enzo!

As with this performance, there are very few who sung the role as a mezzo (which was bellini's intention). I wish that Bartoli (mezzo) and Florez's interpretation would be available in something besides audio. i would pay big time for Bartoli and Florez's presentation
B003BKZW7C|5.0|This was fantastic. The best book by King yet. It was very long but that was cool because it gave me a chance to really get to know the characters. The book spans twenty-eight years of their lives. Scary in places and brutal but unable to put down.

More like this please Mr. King.

B0012GMX3I|5.0|By the late seventies most singers were recording disco albums, and Barbra Streisand decided to join in by releasing this record called \\"Wet\\" which is a concept album where the songs all refer to water. The idea sounds ludicrous, but anything Barbra records is great, so only Streisand could get away with recording such a record.<br /><br /> The one song released from \\"Wet\\" is the blockbuster \\"No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)\\", Barbra's duet with Donna Summer that hit #1 on Billboard, a rare occurrence as Barbra has not had many #1 single's in her career despite the fact her albums sell in the millions. The album itself peaked at #7 and is today pretty much forgotten by her fan base.<br /><br /> Some other great songs here include \\"Splish Splash\\", \\"After The Rain\\", and \\"On Rainy Afternoons\\".

Along the way she is pursed by a gym teacher, tries to connect with a rich substitute, and finds a rival in a fellow teacher, the funniest and most well-developed character in the film. This is a movie that I found funny and refreshing, in that it is not laced with vulgarities and profanity throughout. This is a movie that provides laughs while not seeking the lowest common denominator. A pleasant surprise.

B0042VJ1PI|2.0|\\"Richard Castle\\" is a pseudonym used to cash in on the crossover from the TV show, Castle. I really enjoyed the first book in the series, Heat Wave. The sequel seems written by an entirely different, and inferior, author. The writing is sketchy and lacks the detail and nuance of the first book.  Where the first one clearly reflected the TV show characters, this one seems flat and disconnected, as though then author hasn't even seen the show.  I bought the first book on my Kindle and downloaded the sample of this one, fully expecting to be compelled enough to buy the whole book as soon as I was done with the free section.  Instead, I felt relieved to have dodged a bullet and saved my money. Note to the publisher: get the first author back. I'd read another one of his/her books.  This one, no.
0553579908|3.0|While there is much to like about this book, there is one HUGE problem: it's FAR TOO LONG, and unnecessarily so. Arent there any editors at Bantam Books? If so, they should meet Eddard Stark's fate for unleashing this monstrously overlong tome on the reading public. Due to all the excessive verbiage, the story really DRAAAAAGS at times. Indeed, there are WHOLE chapters that could be cut without losing even the most nuanced parts of the tale.  While the story is interesting and the characters compelling, the pacing is awful and the plot frequently drifts aimlessly. The paperback version is 969 pages. At about HALF that length, this book would be a much more enjoyable read!

This work is an excellent addition to the collection overall, particularly the Sigma series.  Rollins continues character development for the Sigma team and adds new characters to the mix that I hope to see in future reads.  I love that the stakes are building and can't wait to see where Rollins takes Sigma next.<br /><br />I am an avid reader of various genres, in each of which it takes time to find quality authorship.  Rollins has great talent in weaving history (religious and otherwise), technology and humanity in to his works.  For those who argue regarding the accuracy of historical or technological inclusions, set your expectation based on the fact that this is fiction.  If you want precision, scientific journals and history books, rather than stated fiction may be more appropriate to your palette.  The irony should not be lost however that even in those technical records one should consider the subjective position of the scribe.<br /><br />Another title devoured in an evening is evidence of a great read!  Thank you, Mr. Rollins!

B0034G4OZE|1.0|I was expecting this movie to be like Eternal Sunshine or Garden State, a youthful drama.  The lead in the movie was this entitled New York brat that checked himself into a mental hospital because he had a little stress from his prep school.  Give me a break.  I was hoping that by the end of the movie he would introspect a bit and find out that he was just being melodramatic, but instead the movie was biased to his point of view.  The movie was not believable and the characters were not developed well at all.
B002ZG976U|5.0|people seem to have forgot what this movie was about a small town girl who can sing an owner looking for help & a star that might save her night club... i rented this movie didn't thank much of it at first... not only did i watch it.... i watched it 6 times before returning it... now i have to buy the dvd...christina aguilera can sing her ass off love that girls voice... & although people have the right to voice there own opinion but jealuosy won't get you anywhere people with all that negativity can only dream about have'n that kind of talent 1-2 stars get real... to down aguilera's talents & to dare compare britney spears too her please britney wish she had a voice like hers...love cher wish she didn't plump her lips it looks funny..

1594202842|4.0|Interesting how no one on here can give this book a bad review without resorting to insulting the author's parenting technique.  That really is missing the whole point.  Of course her technique is controversial, but the way 'westerners' parent their children is also pretty controversial in asian circles.  It's all relative.<br /><br />I thought this book was amusing.  If it seemed shocking, it's only because the author was being quite frank about how she went about motivating her children.  Of course it wasn't going to focus on the warm, fuzzy-wuzzy moments.  That wasn't the point of the comparison.<br /><br />Btw, some reviewer on here pointed out the irony of her husband becoming a Yale professor despite his free-spirited upbringing.  I think we all know that pointing out exceptions only serves to prove the rule.  Even most 'american' kids I knew growing up who wound up successful as adults had some variation of the stern, disciplined environment the author champions.<br /><br />I thought this book was funny and often touching.  I laughed out loud many times.  Truly enjoyed it.<br /><br />(I am not chinese, btw.)
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I bought this as a gift and the shipping said it would take 2 weeks and it arrived at the persons house within about 4 days. So the shipping was super fast. And I have been told that the dvd quality was clear so overall I am rating a 5, fast service and a great quality product.
B003ZSJ212|2.0|I was a kid when I saw the first (Episode 4) in the movies. I loved 5 but 6 -Star Wars Muppets-... yeah, not. My brother and I walked out of episode 1 because it was garbage. I vaguely recall the following 2 which though better than the first prequel were lacking as well.     Now, I appreciate cleaning up the special effects from the first movie and in the others. I won't complain about restoration and fixing what time, technology and budget would not allow for. However, some of the deleted scenes and altered scenes not only were disappointing but truly sucked. The Solo-Greedo was the ultimate movie botch and pooch screwed not only the scene itself but also the character of Solo who later goes on to become softer. If any blaster was that random and clumsy I doubt a bounty hunter would carry it... Duh, Lucas: value NOT added.     Lucas's commentary about these being his movies and his attitude is well remembered. Word to Lucas: your success with your movies was made by legions of fans who paid to see them and bought your merchandise. Look after the fans that got you there. I somehow doubt George will read this. I hope he does. Maybe it will inspire to return of the originals as some of us remembered and loved them for what they were: part of growing up.

A tab at 51 that holds the twin rails has broken and it poking out of the rails so the ball bearing cannot go through 50 to 52. Massive disappointment for such a good toy. The Original on the other hand is very solid.  Bottom line - Very nicely design, but buy at your own risk as you may not be able to finish the game due to poor quality control.
B000PMFTCC|5.0|One of the finer contemporary recordings. Pavarotti is in strong voice in one of his best roles and is more dramatically involved than he sometimes is on recordings. Caballe and Milnes are both very fine indeed, though Milnes sometimes seems content just to stand and deliver solid Verdi baritone sound rather than add shades and nuances to his portrayal. However, his voice is so well-suited to the role that it seems rather petty to complain. Caballe captures Luisa's pathos beautifully.<br /><br />Van Allan and Giaiotti are in fine voice as Walter and Worm. Reynolds is the weak part in the cast as a colorless Frederica, especially compared to Shirley Verrett or Elena Obratsova on the Cleva or Maazel recordings.<br /><br />Peter Maag's conducting is good but does not capture the tension of the piece the way that Maazel does.<br /><br />Fans of any of the three leads will be delighted with this recording, but if I could have only one, I'd probably pick the Maazel or Cleva.
B004I3U7US|5.0|When I first heard about Anna Calvi it came from a recommendation from one of my all-time faves Nick Cave.  So obviously I was intrigued as Nick isn't exactly a public figure who recommends much.  The album is a grower and now i'm certainly impressed and really in love with the songs.  I was able to see Calvi live in Los Angeles recently and it blew me away.  I went on a whim and since then the record has been on repeat.  Her guitar playing is superb and takes her out of the 'singer-songwriter' category thankfully.  Her voice is amazing and what I found even better is that her speaking voice is high-pitched and squeaky (still pretty) like a mouse.  This is a great indie album of 2011 and I hope more people get introduced to Anna's music so in the USA we can see her more often.  Great album, pick it up and tell your friends about it.
B004EPYZUI|2.0|I highly anticipated this all-original Snyder film, and the movie is very beautiful: characters, setting, and effects are all top-notch regarding aesthetics.  However, the story leaves much to be desired, and the experience may take a heavy toll on victims of rape.<br /><br />The plot itself is simple and, at times, bears incomprehensible turns.  Without spoiling anything, there were several points where characters did things for no discernible reason (most notably during the ending).  I have no further criticism for the plot.<br /><br />The themes of rape and exploitation were laid on very thick and insensitively for what I thought should be a fun action-fantasy film.  For my part, I could not enjoy the film (particularly the very deliberately sexy cast) because of the constant reminders of rape and child exploitation.  Despite the many instances of promotion of feminine empowerment in this film, one wonders how all the female leads and Snyder's own wife had no problem with the final product.  Regardless, anyone who has been victimized with rape or childhood abuse should consider the potential impact of the film: a companion with whom I saw the film opening weekend was rigid through certain parts, and came out in tears, experiencing traumatic flashbacks.  While not universal, certainly, the trauma of those experiences can have long-lasting effects and should be considered when choosing to view this film.
B00092ZMDY|4.0|What a thrill to see the Eagles Farewell 1 tour in Australia. The special that they showed on NBC a couple of years ago did not include them doing Tequila Sunrise, but of course it is on the DVD and wonderful! The only thing I missed was the commentary between songs.

0525423273|5.0|Words cannot explain my crazy love for Anna and the French Kiss. The story is simple: girl gets shipped off to boarding school in France, makes new friend, meets a hot guy, and falls in lust with him. But there is so much more to it. The characters become real in the course of the 372 pages, as does the incredible Paris setting. I've never been to Paris myself, but after reading this, it's as if I've seen the sights, smelled the city, and tasted the food. Stephanie Perkins brings that much life to Anna's Paris.<br /><br />And to Anna as well. This is one girl I could not only relate to, but who I wholeheartedly loved. I adore Anna. She's funny, insecure, hilarious, flawed, angry, happy, sad, hormonal (obviously, as I list her emotions here...), and a teen girl. She's a character that could easily be any girl I pass on the street. Oh, and I love her. I love &Eacute;tienne St. Clair too, because I couldn't leave him out. He's as realistic as Anna, with is insecurities, his sweet gestures, and stupid actions. And his British accent and all-around gorgeousness.  That's the reason that Anna and the French Kiss is so easy to enjoy (not the gorgeousness, but a plus!); it's the characters. The characters, both big and small - no offense to the short &Eacute;tienne - are developed so thoroughly that they all leap off the page.<br /><br />The relationships between Anna and &Eacute;tienne, between &Eacute;tienne and Josh, between Anna and Meredith (I could go on, but I'll stop) all evolve throughout the book. Perkins' witty humor comes out on every page and the dialogue is sharp and quick. The book is cute, I can't lie about that, but it's not 'ooey-gooey, poke-out-your-eyeballs' cute. This is `melt into a puddle, I-want-to-live-in-you-forever,' kind of cute. It's a love story that doesn't just focus on the love. There's tension between Anna and &Eacute;tienne - and it's some yummy tension - but they start as friends and build from there. Not only that, but the two of them have issues outside of their little `I like you, do you like me?' bubble.<br /><br />Anna and the French Kiss is impossible to dislike, unless you are soulless and possibly a kitty murderer. It's sweet and real and fantastically written, with a cast of characters that you'll want to meet, know, and be BFFs with. I smiled a lot while reading it; one of those cheesy grins of pure joy. I read it one sitting because I couldn't put it down, even though I wanted to. Much like a meal in Paris, Anna and the French Kiss is a book to be savored, but is still so easily devoured. As I read the last line, I let out a sigh of pure bliss. A sigh!? That alone should make you pick this book up. Right now. What are you waiting for? GO.do you like me?' bubble.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|I bought \\"How I Sold 1 Million Ebooks in 5 Months\\" from the Kindle store, and devoured the valuable content in 2 hours straight!<br /><br />It's a guide any author (published, or waiting for it) of a book and thinking (even remotely) about selling it online as a Kindle ebook must buy and read - to get powerful insights into the process.<br /><br />What's in the ebook, along with the 'live example' posts on John Locke's blog, are a great lesson on how to sell on the Kindle store.  I especially loved the section on 'life changing blogs' - which gave me many ideas to use even outside the field of fiction writing and selling.  And the section about his \\"failed experiments\\" will save new authors a lot of money (I wish this had been available sooner, it would have helped me save a bit more!)<br /><br />This book isn't just informative - it is inspirational.  \\"How I Sold 1 Million Ebooks in 5 Months\\" revived my excitement about promoting my debut novel on the Kindle store.<br /><br />This is the first time ever I've read a John Locke book - and I'm a fan.

1594744769|5.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is one of those books that is completely unexpected and almost swathed in mystery. I had only the slightest clue what it would be about, but was thoroughly absorbed the moment I began. Jacob is a sixteen year old loner - not by choice - who spends a great deal of his time with his Grandpa, Abraham Portman; a man who escaped nazi-invested Poland as a child and moved into a peculiar home off the coast of Wales. Grandpa Portman claims the home was full of peculiar children with special gifts, but Jacob lost faith in that story years ago.<br /><br />After Grandpa Portman's death, at the hands of what Jacob thinks is a monster, he ventures - with his father - to the island where the home stands. This is when things start to get better and better. The sense of mystery, and even a little trepidation, jumps off the page. Jacob isn't sure if he's just a little crazy or if he should believe the stories his grandfather told him. He flips between the two thoughts and being a part of his uncertainty creates an eeriness. I never knew what to expect or what was going to happen. Each detail is revealed slowly and with care. Learning more about Jacob's grandpa unravels the mystery about the island and the children, but also about the person that Abraham Portman once was.<br /><br />The photos that go along with the peculiar children are creepy and help to bring the story to life. Ransom Riggs has this descriptive writing style that vividly introduces the island of Cairnholm and makes it a character all on its own. I don't want to give anything away because Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a book that screams `read me.' Like its title, it is a peculiar book, full of peculiar children, and peculiar happenings, but it is also a daring and imaginative story that will captivate the reader and fully immerse you in the dreary, rainy world of Cairnholm.<br /><br />Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is part character driven, part historical foray, and part paranormal mystery, but completely fascinating and beyond interesting. Ransom Riggs has tied two forms of art together to create quite the story. It is the perfect balance of creepy and coming of age; meaning, it may give you nightmares, but it will also make you smile. Any book that can do that cannot be bad.ical foray, and part paranormal mystery, but completely fascinating and beyond interesting.

B004BSFSTA|5.0|For those who might not know, my son \\"Das Knucklehead\\" goes through headphones and earbuds like lunch. He steps on the cords, sleeps with em in his ears or on his head, snatches or snags them on obstructions and shorts out the cables... Why does he do this? Because he's a clueless teenaged boy who's an idiot!!!! A soon to be off to college idiot but an idiot just the same.<br /><br />For his High School graduation gift I've been desperately trying to find a set of headphone that fulfill the following criteria:<br /><br />1. Complete or partial noise cancelling<br />2. Small and portable.<br />3. Comfortable.<br />4. Better than earbud sound.<br />5 Durable.<br /><br />After much searching and trial and error I think I've found the solution... Marshall Major Headphones. These badboys produced and sold by Marshall (yes THAT Marshall) have survived more'n a month of torture and still work. The key ingredient is that the cord on the Marshall Majors is partially pigtailed. This key feature has kept junior from stepping on or otherwise mangling the essential wires. They're comfortable, sound good (not Sennheiser good but good), seem well made and work. You could do worse.<br /><br />Da Worfster
0345529057|5.0|It's been a few years since I've actually took the time to read a book mostly due to the fact that it's rare to find books nowadays that can hook you for the entire duration of the series. This series truly keeps you tied into everything and leaves you guessing at what could happen next, but the true worth is the fact that you not only become hooked to the story, you get entwined with the lives of the characters that it feels as if you know them. Truly a series worth reading and hopefully worth watching on hbo.
B004GYY714|5.0|Phone: HTC Incredible<br />Location: Southern California<br /><br />The other reviews have it right: this application is good. I just wanted to add my two cents and describe specific situations where this application has benefited me, and where it might benefit you too.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />1) I was able to find my favorite radio program very easily (Motley Fool Money). I no longer have to download the podcast to my MP3 player, as I can pull it up very quickly using this application on my HTC Incredible.<br /><br />2) Easy to use interface, with access to international stations such as BBC Radio 1.<br /><br />3) Great connectivity. It is possible to get better reception for live radio using my phone than my car radio when going through areas with dodgy radio coverage.<br /><br />4) I was able to find FM HD Radio channels for my favorite AM stations (and all the FM channels available to me!). The difference in audio quality is HUGE. Of course, this only helps if you have an HD radio; otherwise, you can use TuneIn itself.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />1) The negative here is that using the radio draws battery down very quickly. In my own circumstances, I am unable to connect the power to my phone at the same time as I have audio out connected (HTC Incredible), so I have to alternate between my MP3 player and phone to make sure that my phone stays charged.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />This application is very good if you want to know the names and music that are played in your locality. It is great for finding radio podcasts, is very useable, and is all around very impressive. Highly recommended.
B001TODCII|4.0|So says the films protagonist Bryan Mills(Liam Neeson)talking to his daughter's kidnapper over the phone.If you like your action straight up,no chasers,then Taken,released in Feb.2008 and put onto DVD in /09,is THE film for you.Once the action starts,it's a hold-onto-your-seats thrill ride that never lets up.<br />The plot is pretty straightforward.An ex CIA special agent Bryan Mills is attending his daughter's birthday party.From the get go Mills we see is meticulous in his personal habits,all stemming from his background training.His CIA days are behind him but he still keeps in touch with some of his former close associates.His daughter Kim's(Maggie Grace)mother Lenore(Famke Janssen) has remarried and Bryan's relationship with her is quite strained.When Mills meets with his daughter and ex for lunch,Kim asks for his permission to go to Paris with her girlfriend.He is reluctant and he thinks about it.He eventually comes around and Kim is away,with a few stipulations her dad has made on her.<br />The two arrive in Paris and head for their rented flat.On the way they meet a nice looking young man who they arrange to attend a party with later on.While the two are unpacking some unknown men enter the apartment and Kim's friend is taken away in a big struggle.Kim has been talking on the phone with her dad and she describes to him in detail what is taking place.Frightened and barely hanging on, all due to her dad's calm demeanor/training,she hides in an adjacent bedroom under a bed.He tells her she will be taken but to leave the phone open as long as she can and,most importantly,he will come for her.<br />Kim is dragged away as Mills listens.Springing into action he contacts not only her mother but his old associates who offer some technical skills in obtaining background info on the kidnappers.Mills only positive lead is that he has heard the sound of one of the kidnappers.He flies to Paris and clandestinely enters the girls apartment.He tenders the help of an old Paris police detective which leads him nowhere.From the memory card of his daughters smashed telephone he garners a picture of one of her kidnappers.He tracks him down at the airport and just when it seems he has eluded Mills he gets killed by a passing truck.<br />Mills knows that an Albanian gang,specializing in human trafficking,is the group responsible for taking his daughter.This leads him to a construction site which also houses a brothel run by the gang.He puts a temporary stop to the place by almost completely demolishing the operation but in the process gets a lead in the form of a heavily drugged girl who has his daughters jacket.He takes her to a motel and dries her out and gets the address of the place Kim might be at.He poses as a French policeman there to renegotiate his \\"fee\\" to keep quiet about their operations and enters the den of the Albanian traffickers.While there he fingers the man whose voice he heard briefly on the phone and after some further\\"negotiations\\", leaves with his man.<br />Using some plain old fashioned torture,he gleans the info that his daughter is now in the hands of a wealthy Parisian socialite who specializes in the sale of human flesh.Mills attends that function and poses as a waiter serving champagne.While in the small room with a buyer he finally sees his daughter,which he forces the buyer to obtain.While leaving the room to get his daughter(with the buyer in tow)the security there gets the best of him and his is held downstairs to be executed.Before they can do him in he is able to get free and turn the tables.He rushes out after his daughter who is now aboard a yacht owned by a wealthy Sheik.Through a car ride to beat all car rides he tries to catch up to the boat and eventually is able to jump aboard and overcome most of the security with all the usual lightening fast moves he has so far displayed throughout the film.He finally comes face to face with the Sheik holding his daughter at knife point.At the very moment the Sheikis about to negotiate with Mills,Mills shoots him dead with precision aim.<br />Daughter Kim safely back in his arms,they both fly home.<br />Famed French writer,director Luc Besson(The Fifth Element)uses a deft hand in his control here.The editing is top notch;no filler and all meat.The action once it starts,is breathtaking to watch as Mills' former \\"training\\"/\\"special skills\\" are something to behold indeed.Neeson is right in the zone throughout which adds that much more to the believability and intensity of the proceedings.The supporting cast is great and the stunt work wonderful.<br />Technically is the film has been transferred onto DVD in its original 2:40:1 a/r,and is clear and crisp.This version has both the theatrical and extended cuts of the film.There is commentary,the trailer and a making of featurette.There is however something the buyer should be aware of and it is in the making of the DVD itself.There is a scene where Mills enters the Albanians lair(behind the red door).He presents a card to one of the kidnappers.At that moment there seems to be a layer change and the film briefly stops ans starts.This is a common thing but here the sound actually goes out of sync with the actions/mouths on screen.I have checked this on a couple of players and it does it on both.It's a manufacturers glitch and should have been taken care of but of course these things never are unless the release is successful enough to warrant a future re-release.Gotta love this industry don't you?<br />All in all a top notch effort by all involved.Neeson is the intense protagonist who you just KNOW is going to get his man,or in this case his daughter.We know the ending before it really gets going but the trick is to sit back and enjoy the ride,and what a ride it is.4 1/2 stars,recommended viewing.te with Mills,Mills shoots him dead with precision aim.

0316044407|2.0|I bought this book years ago at a co-worker's insistence. I couldn't get into it then, and only now thought I would force myself to read it. It wasn't horrible in the first half, but as it went on I hated it more and more, but forced myself to finish. I completely lost respect for this book when Susie came back to Earth in Ruth's body...WHAT?! Even aside from that ridiculous plot point, I couldn't stand her writing style. Sebold really enjoyed writing ridiculously long, confusing sentences. I honestly wish I had never bought this book and bought into the hype. Don't waste your time or money.
B001MYIXAC|4.0|I watched Let Me In last night and I have to say that I am very disappointed with the new Hollywood version. Let The Right One In (Swedish film) was so much better for many reasons. First) no matter how you could possibly feel about subtitled foreign films Let Me In did not make up for the minuses of LTROI. Second) I read the book - Wow, that was a crazy book. I watched LTROI - Wow, Swedish Hollywood did a good job for the film adaptation but they left out some stuff. I watched LMI - Wow, Hollywood watered down the story, left out some important parts and totally left the creepy horror elements out. Hollywood, you suck. Third) Character name LTROI/LMI - Oskar/Owen, Eli/Abby, and Hakan/Thomas whole relationship thing is a dark element of the story. Hakan/Thomas takes care of Eli/Abby and that relationship is creepy in many ways. LTROI book tells all, LTROI movie hints at it and shows some of the creepiness of the relationship but LMI barely hints at it. LMI just shows it as the photo of a young Thomas and the age unchanged Abby. Whereas in the Hakan and Eli relationship Eli will reward Hakan in ways that contribute to or have caused his pedophilia ways, the Thomas and Abby relationship only shows Thomas killing and gathering blood for Abby but no hints of pedophilia on Thomas part. Fourth) Am I the only one that thinks this story (be it the book or the movies) does not have a happy ending? Am I the only one that thinks that Oskar/Owen is going to grow up and become the next Hakan/Thomas? To me, LMI paints a better picture that Eli/Abby's modus operandi is to seduce a young person and mold them into a caregiver for her to use for many years if only for the scene of Owen looking at the old photo of Abby and young Thomas. I am suspicious that be it book or movie Oskar/Owen taking care of Eli/Abby is not going to be a healthy loving relationship and Oskar/Owen will grow up and be twisted in some manner. Fifth) LTROI book and movie both express that there are real monsters in the world be they school yard bullies, alcoholic abusive fathers, and adults with dysfunctional relationships but the least of concerns is the little girl vampire next door. Heck even the cats are blasé about the school yard bullies, alcoholic abusive fathers, and adults with dysfunctional relationships but once a vampire is in the house, it is Smack Down Time. LMI did not even touch on that story line. Summation, LTROI book was awesome, LTROI movie did a really good, but LMI sucked real bad. Just my 2 cents.

B004HD61KE|5.0|When taking the time to review a book, one must look at several factors: story line, plot development, depth of characters, and research accuracy. Once again this book has all of those factors and more.  As with most novels by this author, I could easily sink into the book and get lost in the storyline.  I had read the novella that was the framework for this book.  I held off till last week to do so, it did nothing but making me want to know more!  Then I turn and find a nice little teaser of the book after, it was enough to tell me this was going to be another book, with the characters I look forward to reading more of. I have stolen time during my clinicals, and reading another Rollin's book with my son (Jake Ransom & the Skull King's Shadow) since The Devil's Colony was released to read the book, it is solid.<br /><br />I was surprised to see the low ratings on here, I go to look, and saw they have nothing to do with the book, but with the pricing.  Now was I thrilled to pay 15.00 for my Kindle edition of the book.  Nope, not even close.  The price is set by the publisher, not by the Author.  The authors have no say in pricing, the publishers do.  On Amazon, the ratings have no sway with the publishing company, but it does help or hurt the author.  If you want to communicate your distaste with the pricing, add it to your review, or contact the company.  Do not penalize the Amazon standing of your favorite authors because of the pricing.  Content is what is to be reviewed here, not the price of the product.

B001POX73C|5.0|I love regency romances, and I love the traditional kind--Barbara Metzger, Joan Smith, and Mary Balogh set me on my path in the 1990s. Though I knew of Georgette Heyer, I had never read any of her novels until I got my Kindle. Within the space of a few weeks, I was able to download The Grand Sophy and Cotillion both for free. The Grand Sophy was fun simply because I liked watching Sophy's machinations; I couldn't get into the romance between first cousins. However, Cotillion was wonderful--a great farce! The reviewer who compared it to Oscar Wilde's works was spot-on!     I must disagree with the reviewer who questioned Freddy's sexuality. Really? He likes his clothing a lot, so he must be gay? Jack was immediately onto Kitty's reasons for becoming engaged to Freddy, but as the reader grows increasingly to dislike Jack, so does Kitty. While the typical regency \\"hero\\"--a womanizing gambler who is willing to fight and believes himself irresistible--Jack proves himself to be thoroughly awful. Freddy is described as stupid, and in fact describes himself so, but as the novel moves along it is clear that he is full of large amounts of common sense. It just takes Kitty a long while to realize it, and that he is the only person on whom she can depend. They each make the other a better person. Of course they are in love, so the end isn't a surprise.     By the time I had reached the last few chapters of the novel, I laughed out loud. The situation that Kitty brings about is so convoluted that it cannot be described. The gathering of Kitty and the male cousins at the rectory is a wonderful scene. This novel is a must-read for lovers of traditional regency romances!
1597801585|5.0|I hadn't visited the The Windup Girl page at Amazon before reading the book, so I was surprised by how varied the reviews are on a book I really enjoyed.  Great characters in an unusual setting and a new - to me at least - dystopian future; what's not to love?    I don't get the folks who seem to think there wasn't enough story here.  While the book is character driven and told from several points of view, there is also a very intricate plot in which all of the characters play a part.  It is the strength of the plot which stays strong all the way to the end that garnered the five star review from me.      The Windup Girl is a great SF novel for folks who are willing to pay attention and don't mind a dark, unusual setting and story.  One of the best novels I've read in past ten years.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|I had wanted to see this movie in theaters and didn't get the chance.  So I was excited to watch it when it came to dvd and blu ray.  I generally prefer to buy Blu-Rays now but try to limit them to the action movies as I feel they benefit the most from the HD.  But my Blu Ray player makes this dvd look amazing on my Plasma and I didn't notice too many problem spots while watching the movie.  The one main special feature in this collection was kind of a let down.  I was expecting a look into the real people that the movie is about and not just a look at the in's and out's of making the movie.  Jessie Eisenberg did a fantastic job of portraying a well educated prick through most of the film.  Jus teh way he was talking was a great part of the movie.  He was so quick with little comebacks and quips.    Great movie a must watch and buy if you are into collecting as I am.

B00008G8LG|5.0|This second remake of the 1946 film \\"Anna And The King Of Siam\\" (the first being the musical \\"The King And I\\" starring Deborah Kerr & Yul Brynner [reprising his role from the Broadway play written by Rodgers & Hammerstein]) stars two time Academy Award winner Jodie Foster (Best Actress \\"The Accused\\" & Best Actress \\"Silence Of The Lambs\\") and Chow Yun-Fat (\\"The Replacement Killers\\") and is directed by Andy Tennant (\\"Ever After: A Cinderella Story\\"). Mr. Tennant delivers yet another gorgeous production filled with top-notch acting, beautiful costumes, exotic locales (it was filmed in Malaysia, as Thailand officials would not permit the film to be shot there), powerful dialogue and minimal offensive content. Based on Mrs. Leonowens' diaries, the movie is accurate in its depiction of events (just how accurate, I do not know). Ms. Foster's English accent was spot-on. Not many actors these days can do an accent and remain consistent throughout (as was Harrison Ford's problem in \\"K-19: The Widowmaker\\").<br /><br />The movie should have been rated PG, as the violence is minimal and there are only two brief scenes which might be disturbing to younger audiences, and there is absolutely no profanity or sexual content. I have not yet viewed all of the special features on the DVD, but I saw the deleted/extended scenes, all of which total less than 7 minutes in length. Though all of them were really good, the director made the right decision to excise them from the movie. My only disappointment is that there's one scene that was not included as a deleted/extended scene that appears in a trailer available online. It's when Anna is walking away and says in disgust, \\"It's like talking to a brick wall.\\" I highly recommend this movie. Should have been rated PG for mild violence.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|This movie started very slow but just as I was thinking of returning it my interest started.  The acting was realy good, serious but at the same time with it put a smile on my face.  It held my interest with a good and unexpected plot.  I would tell everyone to get it but be patient for about 10 minutes.
B003B1X80Y|5.0|I fully admit it. I'm a 30 something male, and I genuinely enjoy this movie. And don't get me wrong; this isn't my genre at all. I've got a media cabinet full of movies like Gladiator, Star Wars, Braveheart, Resident Evil, every Clint Eastwood western known to man, etc. so I wouldn't say I'm just a fluke or that I'm predisposed to like \\"chick flicks\\". A lot of movies of this nature are an insult to the intelligence, sacrificing plot for the sake of obvious (and completely ridiculous) tear jerking moments (that usually inspire me to laugh more than anything).<br /><br />The Notebook, however, is a story anyone of any gender can appreciate. There is something incredibly powerful about two people loving each other for their entire adult lives, and the fortunes that can bring people together when circumstances separate. I don't think there are many that can't relate on some level to the feelings that can persist for that someone incredibly special and a desire for that reunion somewhere in the back of their mind (even if life makes that impossible). The viewer, for about 2 hours, gets to live that out vicariously through watching what becomes of these two individuals, and again, I don't care if you're male or female, something about this movie will resonate with you.<br /><br />I liked it so much, in fact, I even upgraded my DVD copy to the bluray and I revisit this one maybe once or twice a year. The ending was a bit smarmy but other than that, I got no complaints. Great script and wonderful acting; I totally fell in love with Rachel McAdams the first time I watched this. :) For the fellas, this is a movie that's good to have on hand if your movie collection is a bit too testosterone laden for your lady (or ladies) and ladies, this is a movie you'll likely enjoy and your guy (unless he has the emotional depth of a frisbee) won't completely hate watching with you.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|As a late-blooming, baby boomer starving artist, who has self-published two novels with two other books in the queue, I've been pushing myself forward on this publishing journey despite the odds. There's always been an internal belief that some level of success would eventually be possible, but there hasn't been a real-person inspiration or example to follow. And then along came John Locke and his success.    The publishing world in general has become a quicksand field over the past ten years, and when you add the word \\"self\\" to \\"publishing,\\" the quicksand field grows wider and deeper. So I do honestly feel as if Mr. Locke has extended a sturdy branch to those of us stuck out here.    The best part of what he covers in this how-to book of his involves all the things he tried that didn't work. For those writers who haven't wasted their time or money yet on those activities, Locke's counsel can truly save you. For those of us who HAVE wasted time and money, he at least lets us know that we weren't alone in our folly. And then he gives us a simple plan to follow to change our lives. What a concept!    The elements of that plan will require some time and effort. But if something actually works--and there's no quibbling that there is definitely something working for Locke--what writer wouldn't be willing to give his ideas a try? Besides, what could be worse than continuing to languish in this quicksand of publishing obscurity! What is there to lose except, perhaps, a price equivalent to a cup of coffee?    So, good luck to all the writers out there who, like me, are going to give Locke's system a test run! And a whole-hearted thanks to him for borrowing some of his Donovan Creed/western novel writing time to create a book that could prove immensely helpful to us on our own journeys!    All the best to everyone!  Cheri Laser  [[ASIN:1450232191 Separation of Faith: A Novel]]  [[ASIN:0595299733 The Truth About Cinnamon: A Novel]]

B004MPEFBE|5.0|Considering the HP books are LOADED with material, I think that director David Yates has done his best work yet, in the franchise. This is, BY FAR, my favorite HP film and makes me uber excited to see part 2.<br /><br />The HP films have always been a bit of a disappointment to me, but beginning with GoF each film has become better than the one before it. With that said there are some omissions from the book, but you can't get everything about this book into a 2.5 hour movie. I personally think each HP movie should've been at least 2.5 hours long, just because of the wealth of material in them.<br /><br />I love everything about this movie. The directing is great, the acting is superb, the cuts and visuals are wonderful. I just can't say enough about how well this movie has been done. GET IT!
0062060554|2.0|I'll immediately admit I finished this book, as the limited action and overall plot of the story are fascinating.  There are too many book reports on here already, so I'll spare you the story details (this is a page for reviews folks, not to get an A in your high school English class). I think my disappointment stems from the author's rather oddly limited vocabulary choices for this woman, who is supposed to be a WRITER for heavens sake! I get that the whole point is the repetition, yes fine it's a fascinating conceit, but once you get that point, frankly about 15 pages in, then what gets written and said by this woman becomes the only variable the author has to play with, as the action changes very little until the end.  I tired very early of the rather pedestrian language.  I felt that I was being talked down to. And frankly I found the use of the \\"f\\" word coarse. I'm by no means a prude, but this woman, who was in every other respect presented to us as a lovely creature, came off as crude and ignorant through the rather liberal placement of the \\"f\\" word.  I also felt that it was completely obvious that a man wrote the romantic/sexual passages.  The voice of the lovely Chrissy was completely set aside during those passages and replaced with something that lost its core truth.  This is an interesting book, but I do not find myself tempted to gush as others have.

B001HN691I|3.0|To be fair, Cars 2 is not a dud. But it's not a hit either. As someone who's loved everything Pixar has heretofore come up with, it pains me to say it, but I think Cars 2 will be remembered as Pixar's first miss. It's one of those films that, if you've seen the trailer, you've already seen ninety percent of what there is to see in the movie itself. The rest, unfortunately, is tedium.<br /><br />The plot, such as it is, is as follows:  Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) invites his best buddy from Radiator Springs, Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), to accompany him on an international racing event. In Japan, Mater is mistaken for an American spy by two British agents Finn McMissile (Michael Caine) and Holly Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer) who are investigating a criminal conspiracy involving oil rigs, alternative fuels and a mysterious secret weapon.<br /><br />Every now and then, a film comes out where you look at it and wonder how it got into production in the first place. You keep thinking why didn't someone in the early stages come out and say \\"You know, this is a bad idea. A really, really _bad_ idea.\\" And so many things about Cars 2 were bad ideas. Taking the story out of the intimate - and uniquely original - setting of Radiator Springs and sending it through Tokyo, Italy and London, which we recognize because they're already so familiar?  Bad idea.  Reducing all of the other residents of Radiator Springs, who were so memorable from the original Cars, to little more than cameos?  Bad idea. Making the movie an action-driven parody of James Bond spy films? Bad idea.  And last but not least, making Mater the center of everything? _Really_ bad idea.<br /><br />Everything that made the first Cars film so memorable and enjoyable is missing here.  Most particularly Doc Hudson (Paul Newman) who was part of what gave Cars its heart and gravitas. There's no character development in Cars 2, and no heart.  There's just mindless action across dazzling settings, with repeated heavy-handed beatings over the head of _message_:  \\"Friends are important!\\" and \\"Be Yourself!\\"<br /><br />If the blame for Cars 2 failing to match its predecessor in quality can be laid at the feet of anyone, Brad Lewis as co-director/writer is probably most deserving of that dubious achievement. Why he was chosen is beyond imagining as his only previous work as a director was on a short video documentary on food and he apparently has no other credits as a writer.  The original Cars, it must be noted, was co-directed and written by Joe Ranft, whose previous work as a writer includes a host of great films as The Brave Little Toaster, Oliver & Company, The Rescuers Down Under, Beauty and the Beast, The Lion King, Toy Story and A Bug's Life. And the proof, as they say, is in the pudding.  Mr. Ranft, having passed away in 2005, was unfortunately not available for Cars 2, but you'd think that Pixar would have at least tried to get someone of the same caliber for Cars 2.<br /><br />Again, Cars 2 not a bad film, not in the strictest sense anyway. On a technical level, the look is both lush and dazzling. But beneath the dazzle, there's just no 'there' there. It's not bad; it's just boring. And because it's a sequel of a very good and enjoyable film, it's also more than a little disappointing.  Recommended only for those who want to see everything Pixar and who have time to kill.d of _message_:  \\"Friends are important!\\" and \\"Be Yourself!\\"    If the blame for Cars 2 failing to match its predecessor in quality can be laid at the feet of anyone, Brad Lewis as co-director/writer is probably most deserving of that dubious achievement.

B003L77GGA|4.0|This show has changed so much over a 10 year run. The only original characters left were Clark of course and Chloe(MY FAVORITE).  The original laws of anyone who finds out he has powers dies ended long ago. Fot a few seasons It was nothing more than a night time soap opera. With everything for 1 special effect was even gone.  Still the effects of there slow motion technique, allowing us to see what happens In the blink of an eye Is well worked and Impressive.  So now the ending.  Without giving anything away, It was the most creative season In 3 years. Everything and the many many subplots were all explained or had an ending. I guess that's the good thing about knowing It was the last season the cast seemed to want to work even harder for that lasting Impression of their acting.  I'd give this 5 stars If I was rating my personal taste and if a 4.5 I would but I can't give It 5 stars. It's just not In that catagory In any way.  BUT please all you long time fans will love the season and 2 episode ending. After Zod, this was fresh and Lois of course who brought the show the best new blood of all when she arrived' Is the best of the season again. I believe her and Tess are the best actors on the show.  Get this on Blu Ray If you can, It's eye popping. The top of the daily Planet , and everything. Hope this helps at all.

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games, part of a Trilogy, is a fast, excellent read. It says, \\"Young Adult\\" but don't let that dissuade you. I am certainly not a young adult. The premise is a boy and a girl are picked from each of 12 \\"districts\\" every year to fight to the death, no-holds barred. They fight in an 'arena', which may be cold and icey to hot and sandy or a forest or jungle. There can be only one winner. The winner gets alot of perks, fame and fortune. This is a dystopian world. There is a lack of food and every little thing is a luxury. The protagonist, 16 year-old Katniss Everdeen is fighting for her family, District 12, and to stay alive.<br /><br />The story is evenly paced and an easy read. I will be waiting for a possible movie release of this book! Readers, have fun !
B0048ELDQY|2.0|I see this book has good reviews but would like to know how many math proffessors wrote them. Because after picking this book up I found that although Orzel had a great idea to make physics more understandable his gimmick of talking about it with his dog fails pretty bad for those not versed in high math.     If you have no background in math/science (I was a political science major)you will still find most of the concepts Chad presents as still completely outside your comprehension. Just because he finishes each lesson with a few cutesy quips from his talking dog doesnt mean I understand it.     I got excited about learning more about physics after reading Michio Kaku's \\"Physics of the Impossible\\" which I feel was much more reader friendly and interesting. I WANTED to like this book as I do want to learn more about Physics but just couldn't after reading...another book that to me is more readable would be \\"The Great Equations\\" by Robert Crease...its not all physics but it is much more Non-science Major friendly and because of that a better read.
B002QW7ALM|4.0|I'm not saying that this movie is a five star masterpiece, nor am I saying that if you happen to like it someone might \\"pity you\\". It falls in between, and it's a welcome addition to a genre that is increasingly running out of steam.    The tired sci-fi/horror genre gets a shot in the arm with Pandorum. You have two very good actors cast as our leads-Ben Foster and Dennis Quaid. You have a dark, dank, creepy spaceship (NASA ran short of their light-bulb budget at some point). You have rabid alien/mutant things terrorizing our protagonists.     Unfortunately, you also have a token eye-candy ninja woman; a friendly but ultimately expendable warrior-man; and your obligitory rat-fink jerk who at every turn tries to sell out our heroes but for some odd reason they still let him tag along. Had the movie been left to just Foster and Quaid, it would have been much, much better.     Bowen (Foster) is violently woken from hyper-sleep on a space ship bound for the planet Tanis. See, we humans have pretty much wrecked Earth, so we need to colonize another planet so we can wreck that one too. Bowen has no memory of who he is, why he is there and what he's supposed to be doing. Temporary memory loss is a side-effect of extended suspended animation. Right away things seem wrong. No one else on his team is anywhere to be found. The power comes in fits and starts, and the door leading to the bridge has been locked from the outside. Shortly after, his senior officer Payton (Quaid) wakes up. Memory slowly begins to trickle back. They are part of flight crew team five, and it's their two year rotation shift. But where is team four? For that matter, where is the rest of team five? Bowen climbs out a vent duct in an effort to try to unlock the door, while Payton can only sit helplessly as Bowen is forced to contend with monsters, fellow crew mates and a reactor that is ready to blow.    As if this weren't enough, there is a chance each of them has Pandorum, a psychotic disfunction that sometimes drives astronauts insane. Think of it as the bends in space.     The first forty-five minutes of the movie are fantastic. It's gloomy, intense and frightening. Bowen keeps tripping over bodies and runs into some nasty alien/monster baddies. Things fall apart a bit when Bowen meets up with other passengers on board the ship. It feels like these characters were placed there because they had to be. Another baffling issue is why the ship's armory has only whimpy anti-riot pulse guns, yet ninja woman and friendly warrior guy are wielding massive pole-arms and samuari swords. And where did they learn to use these weapons? This is not explained.     One of the best features of the movie is that it feeds us bits and pieces of information, and we're solving the mystery along with Bowen and Payton. Where did the flesh-eating monsters come from? How long has the ship been out there? Why is the ship waking people prematurely? Where is everyone? And are Bowen and Payton experiencing any of these things, or are they slipping into paranoid Pandorum madness?     A few nice twists and turns along the way builds the suspense and gives the movie more depth of plot than most films of its kind. Foster and Quaid give convincing performances as haggard, frightened men who can't trust their own sanity. The monsters are savage, ugly and utterly ruthless. The ship just feels like one giant tomb. The gloom and despair are palpable at some points.    I wasn't expecting to like Pandorum, but I was pleasantly surprised. Hopefully you will be too.

0439023521|5.0|I'm in a book club, and in the past few years we've read some outstanding books ranging from The Help and Sarah's Key to Room and Night.  So when it was my turn to host book club, I turned to Amazon to find a book to suggest. I came across The Hunger Games and was impressed that it received more than 2,000 reviews (most of them favorable). So even though the book targets young adults, I bought it anyway figuring it would be an enjoyable summer read like Twilight.     I was wrong. It was actually more entertaining and much better-written than any of the Twilight books. The plot is so unique, the imagery breathtaking, the characters extremely well-developed. I couldn't put this book down, and almost immediately bought Catching Fire and Mockingjay (the two final books in the trilogy). These books were so enjoyable that I actually felt a little blue when I finished the last one. (Note to Suzanne Collins:  Please write a follow-up! I must know what happens to Katniss!)    I highly recommend this book to anyone (young and old alike) who wants to read one of the most creative, vivid tales ever written.

0307593525|5.0|It was our first time as Amazon clients. We received our package long before we were supposed to--even when we live in a far, far away country... This was a pleasant surprise and made my wife and me very happy. Books were delivered in good shape. Its box was a little bit mashed, but we reckon it is inevitable--even if you buy locally. Prices were more than fair, too. Well done, Amazon!

159420229X|3.0|The title is rather misleading; the book contains nothing about moonwalking or Einstein.  I guess it is intended as a metaphor for the improbability of the author's winning the USA national memory championship, which is what most of the book is about.  I wish the author had enlightened us more on the actual procedures, or implementation of the memory techniques that he learned.  The only technique to receive any attention is the most popular, association with places an objects in your own house.  He does say that he had to memorize a lot of new locations to use for handling larger lists in memorization association, but doesn't say how many such locations he was able to memorize, or what the associated difficulties were.  He doesn't actually reveal the kind of associations he used for memorizing card deck sequences (which is the event that won the championship for him), but from his anecdotal descriptions it certainly wasn't locations.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Adele rode in on the wave of white British Girls worshiping at the altar of Etta James and Dusty Springfield, and seems to be the one left standing after the initial landing. \\"21\\" finds Adele discovering her own personality (primarily through a busted relationship) and pours her soul into every space available. From the bridge-burning of the first hit \\"Rolling In The Deep\\" to the torch version of The Cure's \\"Lovesong,\\" she has matured in two short years into a first class singer.<br /><br />She works out gospel in \\"Take It All\\" to a Tina Turner (ala Ike and Tina and the Ikettes) fire on \\"Rumor Has It.\\" The production ranges from the gentle and soft piano on \\"Turning Tables\\" to overblown - \\"Set Fire to The Rain\\" is way too compressed and comes off as screechy. It may be a case of too many cooks, as \\"21\\" boasts six different producers. I'd personally like to see Adele hole up with Rick Rubin (who gets one of the best performances out of \\"The One and Only\\") or Ryan Tedder, who also co-wrote a few of the songs, including \\"Rumor Has It.\\" Overall, though, \\"21\\" has the air of a timeless record, just as easily digested now as it might be in a decade. If Adele can avoid falling into the trap of trying to be trendy, her approach to music making is going to serve up some classics.
B004PHE9F6|4.0|\\"When I look back, I don't know how the hell we ever did that film.\\" - John Frankenheimer<br /><br />At 176 minutes, Grand Prix is the very definition of epic, but is so perfectly edited and shot that it never really feels that length. I'm always weary of movies with bloated running times, but Grand Prix even features the 5-minute intermission as seen in theatres, so there's no reason to feel guilty for getting up and stretching your legs a bit.<br /><br />The film follows four Formula 1 drivers as they question life, chase women, and face a crisis of confidence. It's very Day-of-Thunder-ish, but I guess there's only so much story you can shoehorn in-between racing scenes in a film like this. The documentary feel adds an authentic edge to it, which helps keep a far distance from Tony Scott's similarly-themed disaster.<br /><br />Shot in 70mm and originally projected in Cinerama (a curved screen for an immersive experience, an early form of IMAX in a way), John Frankenheimer does not hold back and thrusts the audience right into the middle of real races. Up until this point racing movies were mostly b-grade drive-in material with actors shot against a projected backdrop (think of Clark Gable in To Please a Lady) and audiences had never really seen it for real, in color, and especially not from the driver's point-of-view. Some shots are mesmerizing, especially the camera, one inch above the surface of the tarmac, hurtling down the road. Few movies have ever given you this sense of speed. And it's all done for real. I'm not saying that there's no place for CGI in movies, but if you want something to look good, you're going to have to do it the hard way.<br /><br />Grand Prix deservedly won three Oscars for Best Sound, Best Sound Editing, and Best Film Editing. It will never win awards or recognition for the story, but for sheer sight and sound it's a force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />The Blu Ray presents the film in brilliant 2.20:1 1080p with DTS HD-MA sound and a fair amount of extras. The footage of Frankenheimer is all retrospective, and there's not nearly enough of him. The man had little regard towards the end of his career after making drek like The Island of Doctor Moreau and Reindeer Games (though Ronin more than makes up for it). I always thought he was an underrated filmmaker who deserved more acclaim. If you're into racing movies Steve McQueen's [[ASIN:B004QXJZXA Le Mans [Blu-ray]]] might also be worth a look, or even [[ASIN:B001GMH8U6 Days of Thunder [Blu-ray]]] if you're the self-hating type.rankenheimer is all retrospective, and there's not nearly enough of him.

1416550550|5.0|I have loved FHB's \\"Secret Garden\\" since I could read, which is what drew me to this book. I read voraciously, but rarely feel the need to revisit stories. I have already re-read it twice. I love the story, the complexities, and the fact it is not neatly predictable.   I will look for more by this author.
1407115561|4.0|for those of you who are lovers of the julia/axel combination like we are, you might be slightly disappointed. The story is cute and promising, then is a bit of a let down at the end.........As always, the illustrations are adorable and the text and rhyme smart and clever. Just wish the story had more \\"umph\\". I still think Julia Donaldson is an accomplished author- she gets kids!!!! The highest compliments to her and I hope she keeps producing more brilliant stuff like Gruffalo, Snail on the Tail, Room on the Broom. This wasn't her best.
0441013597|5.0|Frank Herbert's Dune is simultaneously one of the most sublime and frustrating works of literature ever produced.    I gave this novel a 5/5 rating outright for two reasons: it's my favorite novel, one I never tire of re-reading; and it's a book that should be read at least once by anyone interested in science fiction, fantasy, history, political science, economics, mysticism, or narrative. Regardless of whether or not someone actually enjoys Dune, every reader can glean something from it.    That said, were it not for the latter two points, I would likely give this novel a lower rating, and here's why:    Dune sacrifices storytelling for story.    What in the name of Thor am I talking about? Let me explain.    The world-building of Dune is outstanding, and I mean, REALLY outstanding. Tolkien can't hold a candle to Herbert's work in this regard - sure, he came up with a number of artificial languages, but from a narrative perspective that's actually one of the less productive things you can do to flesh out a setting.    In Dune, every story element has relevance and connection to every other story element. The political reality of the galaxy depends on economic power, which is derived from trade, which is made possible by the Spacing Guild, who uses the spice, which exists only on Arrakis, whose administration depends upon the political climate. Paul's character is related to the mystical aspects of the story, but also brings relevance to the ecological and historical aspects. And so on, and so on. There isn't a loose thread here, no equivalent of the Fellowship of the Ring's Barrow-wights; nothing here could be removed from the whole package without substantially diminishing it. Tapping into all of these fundamental spheres of thought and creativity gives Dune the feeling of being a real history, and it gives the reader the feeling they're witnessing a change in the axis of civilization - something more subtly epic than big battles, of which we only get one (and anindirectly described one at that).    That said, because Herbert is so dedicated to giving us as much material to work with as he can, in many instances this novel misses out on what might have been effective dramatic elements. An important plot point early on in the book is the supposed presence of a traitor in the midst of the Atreides, a traitor who will make the Harkonnen plot possible. Ordinarily I wouldn't mention this for spoiler concerns, but the novel basically comes out and tells you who the traitor is from the beginning, a while before it even comes into play in the events of the story. The reason this is problematic is because in a story which is so dependent upon political intrigue, it makes the decisions of the characters more powerful when we share in the mystery of the information around them.    Another narrative problem is Paul himself. Though he is unquestionably the central character of the story as well as its protagonist, Paul starts off as a precocious fifteen-year-old and ends as a major player in galactic politics. In other words, he starts of as unrelatable and becomes less relatable as time goes by. In fact, several of my friends told me they stopped reading after a while because they didn't like Paul. This is an entirely fair criticism. In fact, the only character with whom a reader could form a true emotional connection would be Paul's mother, the Lady Jessica, whose problems are much more grounded in humanity. Now Paul's nature is basically vital to the fabric of the story, so it would diminish the story's complexity for him to become a more human character; but Dune would undoubtedly have been an easier reading experience had the novel chosen to focus on Jessica.    This should give you a taste of what I mean. Dune isn't a novel that really engages a reader on an emotional level; because it reads so much like a history, it engages you on intellectual and thematic levels - but again, not emotionally.    This is still my favorite novel,because measured against the standards of what it's trying to accomplish it succeeds beautifully; but potential readers should know what sort of undertaking they're facing when they pick this up.

B003Y5H51K|1.0|Awful! A collection of no-name actors with 2 recognizable faces. The no-name acting is terrible. Not really any great cinematography to speak of and some of the scenes are poorly shot and look very fake. Usually with this kind of movie I find myself rooting for one or more of them to \\"make it\\" out of alive, but I didn't care about any of the characters in this film. It's hard to believe an action movie where nearly every dies could be so boring! Skip this one and re-watch \\"the Cave\\" - much better.

Some of the content is really dated - and some of it is just silly, rehashed stuff from blogs and websites.
B004HZ76FQ|5.0|Can't believe how much fun this game is.  I almost passed on it because of the other fishing games that I had tried.  Saw my wife playing it for a few minutes and thought maybe I would give it a try.  After all, it was free for the day.  I am so glad I downloaded.  The only downside is that the whole family has had to fight for phone time so they can play.    As far as actual gameplay, it is fun because of the physical activity that it requires to successfully catch a fish.  I'm not really into spinning around to find a spot to throw, so swiping to move the screen was appreciated.  The game is really kind of repetitive, but you don't want to put it down 'cause the fish keep getting bigger and you want to out-do the last fish you caught, or your wife caught.  Also, the variety of fish you can catch increases as you progress through the game.    This game is fun, kids and adults will like it, and the fun lasts more that five minutes.  Thanks to the developers and to Amazon for featuring this game.    Also, going throught the tutorial makes the game much more enjoyable.  Don't skip it.    Samsung Vibrant, Android 2.2
B000T9OP7G|4.0|This version of the Terminator narrative is much more sedate, much less driven by the chase, than prior versions; yet it retains important atmospheric qualities.  It features an enemy that our heroes cannot defeat, only outlast.  It maintains T2's \\"fight the future\\" quality, yet emphasizes the original film's \\"keep one step ahead\\" pessimism.  Even Bear McCreary's musical themes utilize emotions built up from the first two films' struggle.<br /><br />But the dense atmospherics signal that this series doesn't just recycle the films.  Whereas the classic originals occur substantially at night, with a gloomy noir ambiance, this series makes contrasts between night and day, as between good and evil.  Even while characters like Derek Reese muddy moral boundaries, this series emphasizes that morality does exist, and we have an obligation to fight for our beliefs and our ethics.<br /><br />The introduction of religious themes, never used in the movies, gives this series a depth not previously plumbed.  Sometimes this gets silly, as when Agent Ellison and Doctor Silverman debate whether Sarah Connor is a prophet.  But it also gives the characters a concrete purpose; they don't just keep fighting because they must, or to prevent hypothetical catastrophe, but because they know the fight is, in itself, right.<br /><br />But this alternate to the fatally absurd T3 marks a powerful switch to the franchise mythology.  Since Terminators still drop into Sarah Connor's life, fate appears inevitable.  There really is a fate other than what we make, Sarah.  Moving Judgment Day from the T2 date to a new timeline requires some adjustment to the prior narrative, yet emphasizes that destiny can only be postponed, not overthrown.  Pretty pessimistic.<br /><br />Therefore this creates a distinct modern mythology, in which morality exists, but God only participates part-time.  Humankind fights for right, but we have only vague parameters, and we define rightness on a situational basis.  Thus different moralities, like Derek Reese's versus Charlie Dixon's, or Agent Ellison's versus Sarah Connor's, assume equal weight, and when they come into conflict, we must subjectively identify which \\"right\\" applies to which situation.<br /><br />Thus, despite utilizing prior Terminator narrative, this series creates an entirely new experience.  Instead of letting social mythology poke through excitement and adrenaline, this show's cerebral, character-driven story gives way to moments of stirring excitement.  It demands that we watch it differently than the films, which have been inconsistent at best.  And it provides rewards that will outlast the show's unfortunately brief network run.Reese's versus Charlie Dixon's, or Agent Ellison's versus Sarah Connor's, assume equal weight, and when they come into conflict, we must subjectively identify which \\"right\\" applies to which situation.

B001HN6922|5.0|Cars 2 is exciting and action-packed!  I did not expect the fast pace of the movie, but it was a nice surprise that made it even more enjoyable!  I was blown away by the visuals and Pixar's attention to detail.  As with most Pixar films, the details deliver layer upon layer of additional enjoyment.  For that reason, I will be seeing this at least once or twice more before it leaves theaters.      A note to parents: I think Cars 2 should have been rated PG rather than G due to the suspense and danger that go with films that have spy-like themes.

B004A8ZWSS|4.0|Watching this movie gave me an epiphany about Johnny Depp's career, and that is his movies, especially those in the past decade, are about individuals who use planning and smarts to defeat those who have strength and numbers on their side.  His POTC movies are great examples of this as he outwits Captains Barbossa, Davy Jones, Norrington, Blackbeard and Cutler Beckett.  He does something similar in this movie, though his antagonists now are members of organized crime and Scotland Yard.  Though the trailers bill this movie as an action thriller, it is more of a mystery movie, with some comedy, some action, and some romance thrown in.  The dialog is very good, both between the two stars, and among the lesser cast members, especially given the fact that both Depp and Jolie are known more for their action movies than anything else.  The cast also features many other big names of past and present, such as Timothy Dalton, Rufus Sewell, and Paul Bettany.  Overall, a great movie, and one that will keep you guessing towards the very end.
0880796863|5.0|This was a fun learning experience and as far as I know it is a standard deck with a little book that explains the cards.
B0041KKYEM|2.0|The movies I see basically fall into two categories.  First, there are the movies that I am genuinely interested in viewing because I found the trailer, the source material (i.e. comic book, historical character), or the previous incarnation interesting.  These tend to be science fiction films, Pixar films, and movies derived from comic books.  Then there are the movies I watch because they are highly rated by critics and have been nominated for key awards.  Examples of the latter include the various Alfred Hitchcock films, the Godfather franchise, and the film Black Swan one starring Natalie Portman.      I expected a lot from this movie seeing that it got Natalie Portman her first Best Actress award at the Oscars.  I was disappointed.  Yes, this movie's content clearly took considerable skill and talent to pull off.  But the movie itself was neither good nor enjoyable.  This film was not enjoyable to watch because there were too many disturbing scenes.  Whether it be the imagined lesbian love scene, or the scene where Ms. Portman's character masturbates, or the various scenes where she confronts her mother, all of them were disturbing scenes that made the characters revolting.  Nothing was exotic, or even lurid, just revolting.  This film was not good for various reasons.  First, it was not original; there are other movies about individuals going crazy due to an obsession or obsessions.  The Aviator is a good example of such a film.  Second, I could not empathize with any of the characters, and any good movie should generate audience empathy for one or more characters.  Third, there was no comedy, no irony, no romance, or anything else in the film to complement the emotional and physical tragedy.  Great films should hit different notes with the audience, and this one was one note only - tragedy.  And last, for a movie built around the beautiful Swan Lake, the set design, costumes, cinematography and overall visual feel was subdued.  Outside of the 5 seconds or soof the movie when the main character imagines herself transforming into a black swan, I did not find any of the scenes memorable.  Overall, quite disappointing considering the quality of the director, Darren Aronofsky.  Even more disappointing was that this film was actually nominated for Best Picture by the Oscars when other, much better films from 2010 were ignored by the Oscars, films such as Kick-Ass, Harry Potter, Shutter Island, etc...
B004EPYZU8|5.0|I'm a fantasy fan through and through and this movie surpassed all my expectations. Right from the opening scene you're gripped by an intense spectacle and an absolutely incredible sound track that carries on right till the end.     I'm not an expert who can rate acting performances but girls did their jobs and were gorgeous. What more can you ask for than four hot babes (and one-not-so-hot babe) kicking the butts of robots and monsters in one of the most imaginative settings I've seen. Well imagination is the key word, if you don't have any this movie is not for you.    If you do then pick up this movie, its made for you. Movie or not get the soundtrack!!

B000VS6P9Q|5.0|If you're a Dylan fan, I highly recommend to you this collection of various artists interpreting a wide range of Dylan songs from nearly all eras of his career.  It's not a compilation designed to \\"wow\\" you by how famous the artists are.  In fact, many of the performers are lesser known, indie rock, alt.rock, whatever term you wanna use -- they're more outsiders than insiders.  They do an outstanding job. Nearly every performer on nearly every track finds a way to get inside each Dylan song and to do it \\"their\\" way while at the same time sounding, in their own way, Dylanesque. Quite a feat, actually. The backup musicians are great as well -- just the right mix of instruments, recorded just right.  Honestly, this is the best collection of Dylan covers (other artists doing Dylan) you can buy -- though I also highly recommend the 30th Anniversary Concert and \\"I Shall Be Unreleased\\".
B001JIES4Q|5.0|Beautifully done. Lovable characters! The story-lines are funny, feel-good and touching. This is one of my all time favorites! A must have for any movie collector.
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|This movie may be set in current times, but you can tell the author grew up in the 70's to 80's.  There's the roller skating rink scene and the flash back to the Partidge Family type band.  The humor is classic and funny for all ages.
B000002MUN|4.0|This is definitely one of TPs best works. Here he uses a sparse production that works as a double-edged sword. It makes the songs easier to hear and gives them a softer feel. This works very well except in the case of the rockers on the album. They end up losing power and become diluted. YOU WRECK ME is a good example. The song is a classic, but it feels understated. The other two rockers on the album, HONEYBEE and THE CABIN DOWN BELOW suffer in comparison. They end up sounding like a bar band trying to be adult contemporary and sadly they succeed. The only other song that I wasn't that happy with is DON'T FADE ON ME. It's a great acoustic guitar piece that goes on a little too long. It would've benefited from a break into rockier territory. The rest of the songs are greatly enhanced by the production values of the album. Tom Petty had never sounded so clear and audible. The album is very Stonesy with hints of Joe Cocker and the usual 60's suspects. It sounds to me like he was already in the throes of marital woes when he was writing the material. The rest of the songs are introspective and philosophical. They are very heartfelt and deceptively intricate. There are some absolute gems here. Highlights:    WILDFLOWERS  YOU DON'T KNOW HOW IT FEELS  YOU WRECK ME  IT'S GOOD TO BE KING  ONLY A BROKEN HEART  HARD ON ME  TO FIND A FRIEND  A HIGHER PLACE  CRAWLING BACK TO YOU  WAKE UP TIME      9 perfect songs rivals the very best of his work. This album isn't for everyone though. Fans of his rockier stuff might be disappointed. This album is a more gloomy affair. There's some bright spots but his best material on this album was mostly sullen and melancholy. If you like deep, moody folk/rock you will love this tremendously.

I'm sorry to say this is slow and boring book. to many things going on, after the 13 chapter I put this kindle down, I'm sure I will finish later on after paying $13. my favorite character Monk was hardly in the book. the plot didn't work.

B0056BMK6K|5.0|As an author who writes pretty decent but unknown Action-Thriller books I was shocked after buying John's book to read about why no one knows that I'm alive.

I understand the concept of E-books but I must now somehow become savvy in getting my stories distributed. I started my first blog at Scottgrantkindle.blogspot.com thank's to John's advice and will have my own website by the end of the week. Every journey begins with the first step.

0553582038|1.0|I'd never heard of this series when my husband and I started watching the HBO version so when I learned it was based on a book series I rushed to B&N to buy all four.  I devoured those first three!  How many nights did I find myself awake, snuggled in a chair reading \\"just one more chapter\\" at 2:00am knowing I had to get up in just a few hours to deal with my children and work?  Too many! LOL  I read all three of them in a matter of weeks and loved every minute.<br /><br />Then came the fourth.  I suffered.  Holy heck did I suffer!  All these new characters that not only didn't I care about, but couldn't keep straight to save my life!  What the heck was he thinking introducing an entire new KINGDOM and all it's conflicts in the FOURTH BOOK?!  It was awful and I do mean awful.  Even the few chapters with the characters I'd grown to love and hate were confusing - how many \\"dreams\\" could Brienne have that were proved real but then a dream but then real again?  WTH?  The only remote joy I found in the entire book could be summed up in the last few pages of Cersei's chapter which I won't put spoilers in here for those who haven't read it but, seriously, those three or four pages (out of hundreds!) were the only worthwhile read.<br /><br />Horrible.  Absolutely horrible.<br /><br />If I'd read these years ago I would be done and never give it a second thought but since the next one will be out in just a few short weeks, I'll give it a go.  I have a bad feeling that I'll be disappointed in it as well. :(
B00000I41J|5.0|This is an album I've never owned(or even heard)before buying the CD. I had seen it for years on the old Bluenote record sleeves. I'd always thought it was a Cannonball album. It's not. It's a Miles 'midnight smoker' in disguise.(Midnight referring back to old station WADO-Radio (Symphony Sid),which aired at midnight.) Anyway,it opens with a strange,un-bebopish directive that had me thinking I had the wrong record. This is a facade...from behind which emerges a muted Miles and a very laid-back \\"Autumn Leaves\\". Cannonball ignites immediately following Miles theme. He's hot! Excellent supportive work here by Hank and Sam Jones and Art Blakey. Miles cooks off a hot,muted solo,followed by Hank's coolly,deliberate solo. Miles themes out. \\"Love For Sale\\" I had heard on \\"Facets Of Miles\\". A definate MONSTER!! Hank intros into a 'romp', bringing on muted Miles and the theme. Note Sam's bass work here. Cannonball slides out, jammin' all the way, encouraged by Art. The Cannon man puts down some great alto. (But,then,when has he not?) Miles themes. \\"Somethin' Else\\" is an almost open-ended jam by Miles. He jams without his mute, reminiscent of his \\"Blues By Five\\"(\\"Cookin'\\"),which both he and Cannonball quote during the track. Good solos by both Horns and Hank before Miles 'leads' Cannonball to the exit. Nat Adderley's \\"One For Daddy-O\\" is a 'stone' blues. Intro(ed) by Hank, it has a sharp,yet cool, theme, which gets right down to business; Cannonball blowin' the blues. The brother is \\"hellified\\"!! So is Miles, who has to follow him. Hank Jones, who can handle 'cool' with the best of 'em, does just that. Cannonball comes back for another solo,as does Miles and Hank before closing. \\"Dancing In The Dark\\" which is \\"owned\\" by Supersax and the L.A. Voices, is blown,here,as a beautiful ballard by Cannonball Adderley alone. Hank's \\"Bangoon\\" is my foremost track on the set. It's that old \\"Birdland\\"-type bebop that showcases why everybody got into this 'field' in the first place. It brings out great solos from all, including Art Blakey's only solo of the set. This album should come as no surprize to any fan of anyone listed on the front cover. We expect it to be just what it is ......SOMETHIN' ELSE.brings out great solos from all, including Art Blakey's only solo of the set.

B004132HZS|5.0|I loved the concept of Sherlock characters in a modern setting. It's clever, amusing, ironic, and adds just the right touch of action to make it believable. I was disappointed Season One only has three episodes. I wanted more, so I watched all the extras -- which I never do. I can't wait for Season Two. It can't come soon enough.

B004IH0TS4|5.0|I preview books that I get for my nephews (10 & 11) so read this, and the other books in this series, before giving them to them. Very age appropriate with plenty of adventure to keep them engaged and entertained.     I enjoyed them and my nephews loved the entire series. Great for all ages.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|A lot of hype has been put around a power-point slide presentation in the middle of a novel, and the discussion is worthy... a sort of climax worthy of the material and built by the material.  Excellent character studies and dialogue.  Each chapter is a short story unto itself, and while the writing keeps you turning the pages, the subtle suprises that build throughout the novel, between each chapter, will not allow you to put it down.  Laugh-out-loud at times, but when I expected a trite attempt to use power-point slides to do something unique, I was hit in the gut with a slience between the pages.  Artful and yet popular...
B000VUFJ3C|5.0|This is one of my favorite BSB albums.  The songs have the mid-tempo \\"I Want it That Way\\" feel and the lyrics reflect that the BSB are men now.  This album is great for car trips and sounds best played all the way through.  You can tell they took care with how the songs flow into each other.  As always, the singing is top-notch.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have a new found respect for Jillian Michaels. This video is by far the best full body work out I've ever experienced in all my years working out, in 20 minutes no less! I have parts of my legs that I never knew could even get sore! I'd recommend it to anyone, love it. I ordered one for my sister-in-law that just had a baby and got a few friends to get it. Tonight is day 5 and I already see some changes in my muscles as well as my endurance.
B002CPD5LM|5.0|Both the video and audio quality of this disc make it a perfect \\"show off\\" disc for any high end home theater set-up! It doesn't hurt that the performances live up to that same standard and the the list of luminaries and legends that come out to perform \\"for\\" Quincy Jones is mightily impressive as well.
0060786523|5.0|If you are looking for something that is (a) enjoyable to read, not too mentally taxing after a long, tiring day of work and/or child care, but also (b) serious and moving and memorable, this is the book for you.  If you are a Jane Austen fan, you can treat yourself to a 2000-page version set in India in the early 1950s.  If you like Tolstoy, you will not be disappointed by the forays into the politics of the Zamindari land reform.  All extremely skillfully done.  One of the best books I've read in years, and I am so sad that I have gotten to the end.  Now I will have to wait until 2013 for _A Suitable Girl_.
0307341550|5.0|I picked this up knowing nothing about the author and nothing about the book, other than its simple dark cover and a paragraph from Stephen King on the back that perked my interest in this debut novel.<br /><br />I began this novel at 10:00pm and intended to read a few chapters and head to bed, but I sat until 1:00 a.m. because I couldn't stop reading it.<br /><br />Part of the appeal is that I knew nothing of what was going to occur in the pages, this book did not have a synopsis of any kind.  I encourage you NOT to read reviews that recap the storyline, because the surprise of what this turned out to be was part of the fun for me and I will not do that in this review.  I am going to try very hard to give you a review of this book without revealing anything about the story itself.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was that the lead character and voice in this book was pretty raw (it's written in the first person; she is blunt and honest in a way that doesn't exactly leave her in the most appealing light at times.  I enjoyed this and I really enjoyed the novel, which I would describe as part mystery, part family saga.  As I said before, I don't want to give away the plot.  This book is dark, it is disturbing in that it slowly chews away at the surface of abnormality and dysfunction, leading you to the core of something unimaginable.  It is quite clear to the reader that we are getting closer and closer to the center of this dark place, but I found that I couldn't turn away.  As some other reviewers stated, the plot does reveal itself, and I believe this was the intention of the author, you are literally watching the lead character walk herself into a situation and you are powerless to stop it; that builds suspense!  These characters I found to be quite real, not cookie cutter versions of themselves presented in a way that you'd find in a Hollywood movie or some poorly presented detective series.  She is not a heroine in any true sense of the word. If you enjoy true, raw characters that are flawed, even in their best moments (as all humans are) than you might enjoy this.  The writing is very smooth, the action moves nicely, the story flows and never loses its balance and it clocks in at just over 250 pages.<br /><br />I will end with the quote by Stephen King on the back of this book, it was part of the reason I picked this book up in the first place.<br /><br />\\"To say this is a terrific debut novel is really too mild.  I haven't read such a relentelessly creepy family saga since John Farris's All Heads Turn as the Hunt Goes By, and that was thirty years ago, give or take.  Sharp Objects isn't one of those scare-and-retreat books; its effect is cumulative.  I found myself dreading the last thirty pages or so but was helpless to stop turning them.  Then, after the lights were out, the story just stayed there in  my head, coiled and hissing, like a snake in a cave.

0062060554|5.0|All I can say is WOW!!!  Started the book in the morning and could not put it down till I read the last page.  For a first book of this author; I found it engrossing and the story believeable.  The characters were real and the first person telling of the story made the events real and scarry.  I won't give away the plot, but it reminded a lot of the book;\\"Doublebind\\" by chris Bohjalian.

B004SJ3AXI|2.0|This update really bites.  Horrible choice to have one level per day.  This game gets boring quick.  I was expecting much more from this update but was unexpectedly let down.  Ads are out of control...very annoying.  Can't beat FREE though.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  After reading the book, I rented the movie and just loved it.  So I had to buy it so I can watch it anytime.  The actors are wonderful & the movie pretty much follows the book.  The dvd includes extra features.  I'm very happy with my purchase.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|This is a very addicting and fun game but it has a lot of bugs to be worked out.  if the screen goes to sleep even slightly,  you have to reload again.  The other day it lost all my progress after the low battery notification came on.  Also has frozen my phone at least three times and had to remove the battery as nothing worked.  I am using a Samsung Captivate.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This was a very good movie proving the faithfulness of dogs. I cried for the last 45 minutes of the movie and even after that just thinking about it.I'm so glad Amazon offered this terifirc movie.
B004A8ZX2I|2.0|This is a decent popcorn flick, but the story has been told before much more skillfully. The story is composed of the first 15 minutes of [[ASIN:B002ZHKZCO The Bourne Identity (Single-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)]] with a hint of [[ASIN:B001GCUO5W Shutter Island [Blu-ray]]]. In order to make this movie stand on it's own, it needed another twist. Without it, it's a predicable action romp with its only saving grace being Liam Neeson in the starring role. You'll likely know how the story will play out within the first few minutes and, unfortunately, the action has all been seen before with higher production values. Caring about the characters can turn a predictable plot into something special, but the character development in this is pretty weak. All that said, its a decent movie to rent on a boring Sunday afternoon.
B0041ON3TG|4.0|I posted earlier a review on Puritanical Euphoric Misanthropia and while cruising down Dimmu's list of vinyls, I found this one. Well, here goes a review.     As most bands typically do, Dimmu Borgir has evolved. Again. While frustrating to some, many also have kept in mind what Shagrath has said about this band, as well as his other band, Crome Division: they will always strive for a greater improvement of their ideas on how the music should sound for each album. IE no one album will sound like the other.     This would hold rather accurately when you compare their Stormblast remake with Death Cult Armageddon (ex: male choirs in Stormblast remake, much more orchestral in Death Cult, etc), their old old albums obviously were made in the times they more than likely didn't have thousands upon thousands of dollars to go to the best recording studio money could buy, as the audio would probably suggest- but here's the thing: they still did their absolute best! After all, why would they be topping charts and what not in the Symphonic Black Metal genre if they didn't do everything in their power to move up and \\"suck\\" as some people say? They seem to be doing something right, right?    For this album, granted yeah I didn't really like the female singing in Gateways... at all. I'm not kidding. I hated it. BUT there is a lot more to the song than just those few second of.. gut-wrenching screaming (if you don't know what I'm talking about, just watch the music video when she's screaming at Shagrath while he's on his throne), the very beginning explodes into what I can only describe as a conveyance of chaos and power (fast paced metal mixed with choir and an orchestral piece). It goes together so perfectly!     Their song Dimmu Borgir, well, I would assume this is a song they've been wanting to make for a long time. After all, it's the name of their band, you know? Maybe there's an underlying note about what the band is about within the lyrics? Just a thought. Still, more choirvocals and excellent use of the orchestra in this song. Powerful and grabs you inside. Least, that's what it did to me.    The other songs are just as great, but the song in the limited edition album Dead Men Don't Rape, it reminds me more of their Puritanical album with the way Shagrath's voice sounds more drawn out and warped. It's not at all like the rest of Abrahadabra, but it still holds its place well in the album.      Another note: People seriously, SERIOUSLY need to stop comparing Dimmu Borgir with Cradle of Filth. Both bands have responded to this saying they have their own unique styles and go their own directions, they're not competing with one another- so should you who compare the to. Stop trying to over-analyze when you should be, instead, enjoying an album a band busted their humps making just for you, the fan.
0553582038|2.0|The book had some important plot items... but over all I skimmed half the book. Don't want to read about Cersis experimental escapades, or how Jamie has suddenly found a halo. New characters I care nothing about or know how the will impact the final story. I just hoping the next book will be back to the old format.
1416550550|5.0|I just finished reading The Forgotten Garden and absolutely LOVED it. This story of four generations of women is so magically written that I could not put it down.

B004I2K4DY|5.0|Like many, I was a die-hard fan of the TAEC [tenth anniversary edition concert],but I kept finding myself drawn to this version time and time again.  It's visual spectacle is much more vibrant with  the cast and sets dressed and draped in much more color and depending on the actors and music to set the tone and not just wash everything in grey.  That said, the performances are also faster & a bit more alive.  But there are things missing that I found phenomenal in the TAEC; for instance, in this edition you see [and not very clearly I might add]a screen-projection of the horse and cart accident and are left to discern, for yourself, what has happened; where in the TAEC you see a wonderfully choreographed, physical acting out of the incident/accident  on stage.  Those are the little touches I miss in the 25TH AE. I can say, for me, that this is now and will probably always be my favorite.
0385333846|5.0|The Dresden Raid has been written of by numerous people and particularly by those that were neither there nor in most cases even born at the time.  Early 1945 was good for those of us on our side as it goes, who had already had more than five more than disturbing years of war.  Kurt like any reasonably deep thinker, even as young as he was at that time was pitched into the mix and emerged perhaps just a mite unhinged by it all.  He portrays that well in what we might recognise from his later works as \\"his own inimitable style\\".  Revenge it most certainly was, combined with a graphic example of \\"there you are you Ruskies, how's that then?\\"   War, to be successful is about humans killing humans, keep as far away from wars as you possibly can, ours was a fine example and it has to be said......well done us.

B000000OQF|5.0|Guns and Roses BEST work ever! it was this that they were introduced to the world.... and the world fell in love with them.  Their music is still world wide loved today! and although they are still performing -separately - I miss them together as a group.... One of the best rock groups ever!  This album is timeless. and you will listen to it over and over again.. enjoying every single moment of it.
B004KS96GW|5.0|I bought one of these 3 years ago for my Mac laptop.  This bag is awesome!  Lots of storage pockets.  Very durable.  Soft padded straps if you need to backpack it for long periods of time. The steel cable top handle is very reassuring when hauling around a $5000 piece of computer equipment.  The bag is constructed like a tank,but, with all kinds of cushion for you and the laptop & any other gear you haul in it.<br /> When my friend got a new laptop for Christmas 2010, I told her to get one.  I ordered two of them.  I don't think my first one will ever wear out, but in case I ever have a problem in the future locating this item again- I have  them in reserve :)<br />Absolutely a good buy!  If you dish out a bunch of money on your computer- don't scrimp on the quality of the gear you buy to carry it!
1400064287|5.0|Loved this book. I found it funny, insightful, a quick read & filled with great stories. It's practical & applicable to my day to day work. Really liked the concept about sticking to the core - that's where most communication pieces fall apart, so I've learned to become more aware of my core messages.
0061478784|5.0|About the Book:   In this folklore like book, Sophie has already determined she is doomed to fail since she is the eldest of three children so it seems to be only fair that she is going to be the one to be stuck with tending the hat shop. It could be much worse, and worse it becomes when the evil Witch of the Waste comes to visit the hat shop and places a terrible curse on Sophie. This curse ends up turning Sophie into a ninety year old woman, unable to tell anyone about the curse. Sophie then ends up at the castle of Howl, a wizard known for eating young girls' hearts, and there she meets Calcifer, a fire demon who has a contract with Howl. Calcifer ends up noticing the spell on Sophie and says he will remove her curse if she figures out how to break the contract between Cal and Howl, which is just the beginning of Sophie's magical journey.    Review:  I originally found this book from the Miyazaki film. Having loved the movie, I wanted to read the book, and I was not disappointed. Although I still think the movie is excellent, I found the book more wonderful. Jones did an excellent job of mixing both adventure and humour into her world. Also, the head nods toward the general fantasy genre are excellent, such as how Sophie is doomed to fail since she is the eldest. The characters are also fun, and you get a great sense of them without going into nitpicking details yet there is enough details that the character isn't bland or boring. The plot was a page turner through out, even if you have seen the movie. There are plenty of twists, some which are fairly clear to see and others that jump out at you, such as where the black portal leads. I seriously cannot recommend this book enough. It's an easy read with a punch that both kids and adults can enjoy. Jones can bet that I will be picking up more of her books in the future.
0679720200|5.0|Honestly one of the best books I have read. You might think that the first half of the book is going nowhere, but it all comes around in the end. Everything in the book has a purpose. Some may say that the main character is insane, but I actually thought his apathetic lifestyle was close to what most live today. And Parts will just make you say WOW. 5 Stars.
B000002OOY|5.0|Well...maybe not either, but both the movie and score are amazing. Perhaps I am biased by nostalgia and spent way too much time listening to my brother's cassette of this during my wonderful teenage years. I also watched the movie far too frequently. Aside from that, this is a well put together piece of music by a man that know how to put together pieces of music. Did I mention that the movie is pretty good too?
B0000VD04M|5.0|Many of you have already written great reviews and have covered a lot of ground.  For me the aspect that truly shines in the movie is Johnny Depp's performance.  The fact that he did not win an Oscar is as grave of an injustice as Al Pacino not winning for Dogs Day Afternoon.  He - and all his colleagues - were nothing short of brilliant and this movie stands - along with 8 1/2 and The Stunt Man - as the greatest film about making movies...  A must buy that I am sure to upgrade when it comes out in Bluray!!!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I didn't realize until I got well into the book how little I know about Tina Fey...never watched SNL or 30 Rock so a lot of the references to those shows were lost on me.  I really liked the insight into her struggles with trying to be the \\"best\\" at everything and how often being the best mother is truly at odds with being the best writer or actor or employee.  Given that there is still much that Tina Fey will do professionally, I hope she re-visits this topic in the next 10-15 years...it will be fascinating to see what she has accomplished and how much more success awaits her.  Note to amazon.com:  the script of her Sarah Palin scene was unreadable...please correct this.
B000006NPY|3.0|This CD is terrible and it is just a waste of money! Don't buy it (Unless you like Katy Perry, Taio Cruz, Black Eyed Peas, etc.) because all it really is, is guitar, synths, synthesized bass, and synthesized drums! Also, if you have children, keep them away from the booklet because it shows D'arcy's breasts.  EDIT : I've grown since my original review up above. Don't even bother with that review because it's really not that bad of an album. I just hated any synthetic noises which was pointless on my part.
B003LL3NOK|2.0|Coming on the back of the enjoyable and clever \\"Diary Of The Dead\\" it's sad to say that \\"Survival Of The Dead\\" is quite a weak zombie film. Which is a pity as it seemed that George A. Romero had re awoken his own franchise with 2005's highly successful \\"Land of the Dead\\". This movie just feels real weak compared to all previous entries, in fact the zombies barely play a part and there's no scenes that will have you jumping, Yes it could be to do with the budget of only 4 million but Romero's never really had big budgets before and after all \\"Diary Of The Dead\\" only had a budget of 2 million.     The movie basically picks up where the last movie ends in that a bunch of renegade soldiers rob the belongings of the cast of \\"Diary Of The Dead\\", while this is going on there's a war going on an island that is supposed to be zombie free. Of course everyone will descend on to this island and battle the zombies, but unfortunately it doesn't work that way and the story turns into who gets control of the island and the Zombies are really only in the background.     There is no extras included and the movie has a dated feel to it and if Romero's name wasn't attached to it we probably won't make it till the end. If you have seen the previous dead's then it's worth a look but if you only have a passing interest then don't bother!

B0017SWPXY|5.0|I truly enjoyed every line of this book. So well written! I was initially skeptical about a book where the narrator is a dog, but I changed my mind as soon as I started reading. Enzo the dog is an unforgettable character. Funny and touching.
B003Q6D25K|1.0|Honestly, this is one of the worst movies I've ever paid to see. The plot (or lack there of) is terrible. Absolutly nothing paranormal happens in the first hour of the movie. The scariest thing about this movie is the fact that I wasted an hour and a half of my life watching it. Do yourself a favor and save your money.
B004G5ZY7E|2.0|I bought this book at the airport bookstore leaving for a vacation. The only reason I read it all is that I did not have anything else to read. «The Snowman» could have been written by a middle school student with a love for thriller.<br />Very plain and predictable, the murderer can easily be guessed one third into the book.<br />The characters have no depth and it is one cliche after another when they open their mouth.<br />Save your money, Nesbo is NOT the next Larsson.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|An interesting book that requires some degree of patience while the main character slowly begins (and re-begins) to rediscover her life lost to amnesia.    The book is well-written and while I respect the author's skills, I was left feeling that I had just read a novel that will soon be turned into a made for TV chick-flick on the Oxygen Channel.     In short, the writing is far better than the plot.    4 Stars for the Writing + 2 Stars for the Plot = 3 Stars.

Redbreast was not as enjoyable a read for me. It was a chore.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I've seen quite a few movies this year, but none compares to this one. Not only is it a true story, but it is very well done.  I think all of the actors should have won awards as it was so very well done, and kept you interested the whole time.  It's a film that everyone should see, friends and family alike and I know you will love it as I did.
B003Y5H53S|5.0|Shrek was given a PG rating for the same reason as Rango, it's not for young(young) kids. If you want young films watch Aladdin, Gnomeo and Juliet, Tangled, Rio, or Finding Nemo. These films are given a G rating for the reason of Guidance. Shrek has hell, damn, farts, burps, and all sort of nasty things, i personally love it, but little children would not understand it, or they would immitate it. Rango is a very good film with clever humor geared towards adults, most people who go to see it should read this and then they wouldn't drag kids into a film like this in the first place and waste money. Kids usually laugh at kid jokes, the jokes here, and humor is very dry with a lot of sarcasm. The animation is beautiful, and i for one thought the movie was brilliant. Funny it's one of the highest rated animate films next to Toy Story 3, check out Rotten Tomatoes. And 90 some percent of the fans loved it to. So quit complaining about them saying hell, or damn, it's in the bible and they tell little kids they are going to hell all the time at church. Or will be damned in hellish torment. Even on sitcoms geared for kids they swear. So what. Don't like it, don't watch it, stick the kids to kid based films. I personally thought this was awesome, and will definitely get it on blu ray, looks amazing. Story isn't great but fun. The whole move is just that, fun! And Johnny Depp does excellent voice over work that you can't even tell it's him. So give Rango a watch people, and don't make your 5 year old sit through it and wait for cutsie little things to pop up, it's NOT that kind of movie, whoever told you that was on crack. GREAT FILM!! :D

It was enjoyable to listen to and has more than just a one hit wonder on it. Check it out for yourselves. I know it will not be appreciated by all but I still feel the majority will find this CD an enjoyable experience.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|I suppose this movie wasn't meant to be funny, based on how it was marketed and on the majority of reviews here. But after the first moments where my disbelief was seriously taxed (Damon's first contact with the Adjustment Bureau), I found my incredulity rising to the point of sheer hilarity and acceptance of the flow.<br /><br />I mean, it's nuts.  Note, those who believe in destiny will likely process this film differently from those who don't.  The latter, like me, will probably take a moment to swallow the absurd notion of an adjustment bureau and what it spends its time worrying about.  But once you say, okay, this is a quirky, off-kilter, bizarre love story/fantasy with the good guys at risk from perilous fate-deciders of great power, well...it becomes supremely enjoyable.<br /><br />Blunt is divine (the first time I saw that about her), and she and Damon have great magnetism.  He does a great job of someone in this scenario, and the drama and tension between them makes it easy to excuse some of the excesses. You've got two people wanting to get together, and a bureau committed to keeping them apart no matter how, and that bureau is severely more powerful (and yet weak in the most knee-smackingly, gleefulyl nutso ways).  Gosh, how could I not find it hilarious?  Its hilarity is part of its absolutely unique charm.  If you don't believe in destiny, just take this as a fun, out-there movie, and you'll enjoy the ride.  I did find my heart rate racing a couple of times.  It's fun, a zinger.  And if you do believe in destiny...there's a little more grist to it, such as the question of can you change that destiny, and if you could, would you (and should you) dare.<br /><br />A fun movie...
B004UC1WN8|5.0|J Lo hit it out of the park with this CD. She is back with avengance!  with the help of Pit Bull (everyone this guy works with goes gold)  she is fantastic with On the Floor. The entire CD was just well put together. I was not disapointed as I had been with some of her past CD's.
0385523394|1.0|This shallow \\"memoir\\" is an absolutely painful read. After reading the beautifully written \\"Fish\\" by TJ Parsell I was intrigued. What I got, however, was a ridiculous self indulgence by Kerman, who takes EVERY opportunity to remind the reader that she is educated, white and good looking (?!).... (you never once get to forget she graduated from Smith). Nearing the middle of the book it became simply laughable how she related constant examples of how popular she was and how \\"hip\\" she was with different ethnicities. Equally annoying, however was her references to how \\"different\\" she was then the typical prisoner. Some of her biggest struggles involved juggling all of her friends and family who wanted to come and visit her, getting two subscriptions to the same magazine etc.  Lacking in depth, insight and wisdom this should have stayed in her personal journal.   I would highly highly recommend \\"Fish\\" by TJ Parsell in comparison this is just a disgrace.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Is there anything this Artist does that is not good? I also own 19 and that is a great CD. Adele is an artist with the soul sounds like Jos Stone and a touch of Sara Bareilles and Amy Winehouse in her own style. I am very impressed with her work and so is everyone else who listens to this CD when I have it playing.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I discovered this gem on netflix and havent looked back. It truly is the most engrossing, engaging, and relevent show i have ever seen. Never have i ever been so eager to see another episode of ANYTHING!
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|Loved it
0385737955|4.0|Yeah. I know. That is one heck of a summary, huh? I put off reading this book for awhile. You know why? Because I was afraid to read it. I wanted it to be soooo good because of that summary and other reviews I had read. And it alllmmmoooosst met all my expectations. Don't hate me. There's a reason why there is a star missing. I'll get to that in a minute and I promise I have valid reasons. But first I want to talk about what I loved!<br /><br />Geez. The setting. It was out of this world and met every expectation I could possibly have for a setting hog like I am. It was vivid and lush and took on a life of its own. I could rave about the setting forever. The maze, the glade, the homestead, and the forest. And the grievers! Holy crap! They were so frightening and I freaked out when I was reading about them. That whole scene where Thomas gets trapped out in the maze at night. I'm lucky I didn't have nightmares from reading that!<br /><br />The author is a pro at writing suspense and the book was fantastic in that aspect. The action never stopped and it kept building and building. It was awesome. And I hear the next book may be even better than this one. I can't wait to read it, but I'm going to wait a little bit because I don't want to freak out waiting for book 3 to be released. That's another thing that was great about The Maze Runner. It is going to be stuck in my mind for a long time. The details will stay because the book and the events that took place were so darn memorable.<br /><br />Things I didn't care for. The stupid lingo. Was it seriously necessary to put in fake swear words to make the kids sound tough? I understand why he wanted to leave the swearing out, but I would have preferred he not use the fake language device either. Just have them not swear, because honestly, it took me out of the story a little bit. And for me it interrupted the flow.<br /><br />I'm also going to hate on the character development too. There wasn't enough of it. I understand there were a lot of characters, but I felt that by the end of the book, some of them were pretty interchangeable. They all felt like the same person with different names. Except for Chuck and Teresa. For obvious reasons. Chuck was a little kid and Teresa was the only girl. I just felt like the personalities could have gone in different directions instead of having them all kind of appear as one entity.<br /><br />But I cannot rave enough about the plot and suspense. What a fantastic story. And the conclusion was magical. I was afraid it wasn't going to be able to surpass the story itself, but it wrapped up even better than it possibl could have. Fantastic read. And I have a lot of love for that cover too, because it is exactly how I pictured the maze would be. And now I hear they are making a movie. I can't wait to see how that turns out and I will most definitely be one of the first in line to see it. I can't wait to see the grievers in all their special-effect movie glory. Read it!, but I felt that by the end of the book, some of them were pretty interchangeable. They all felt like the same person with different names. Except for Chuck and Teresa. For obvious reasons.

0743496736|5.0|If parents will open up a dialogue with their children about bullying, this book besides being an outstanding read, might save some children from experiencing the pain that creates. The conversation has to be both about being bullied and playing the bully role.  My children are no longer home but if they were, I would do my best to learn where they were on this activity, then I would hold them very close.  This was an extremely moving book and approached all sides of this complex issue.  Well done!
B000002KHH|5.0|This album is the breakthrough second album by British heavy metal band Black Sabbath. it was darker and more heavier and the songs would be rmemember as classics, like War Pigs, Electric Funeral, Paranoid, and of course Iron Man. Black Sabbath would go only darker and Heavier after but this one well always be a classic.
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you thought the first book of the series was good than you'll love this one as well. i found myself gasping out loud at some moments and moved to tears at others. Absolutely could not put this down. I just downloaded the 3rd and final book and can't wait to read it!  Excellent!
B004SBQAN8|4.0|The movie was entertaining and the special effects were pretty cool.  It didn't have an amazing storyline or plot, but I was rooting for the main characters at the end.
B00008O89K|5.0|I love it.  Great music from a great movie.  It is not a complete soundtrack, but does have all the major instrumentals from the movie.
0891419063|5.0|Anyone who has the notion that war is a glamorous adventure should read this book, and he or she will shortly be disabused of that notion. This is a hard-hitting, no holes barred treatment of two of the bloodiest Pacific campaigns in World War II. The author lived through them and he has spared no punches in retelling what happened on the islands invaded by the Marines, and held to the death by the Japanese.<br /><br /> It shows how ordinary American youth can be turned into hate-filled almost zombies, capable of committing the most heinous atrocities on both living and dead enemy soldiers, in retaliation for what was done to their buddies. Many times the reader winces at what he is reading, but this is war, and it's not pretty.<br /><br /> This book is recommended as being one of the best books to come out of the war, and I heartily agree. Read it and you may be changed forever in your thinking.
0425166805|4.0|enjoyed this book very much - great theory and great read. don't just listen to what society says you have to believe. read as much as you can and then draw your own conclusions.
1400052181|4.0|It is said that a window into a person's future can be determined by delving into his/her past.  This book is a prime example of that statement. You are drawn into the story by the unbelievable yet heartbreaking miracle of Henrietta's immortal cells.  Rebecca Skloot takes us through technical and sometimes tedious medical terminology to paint a clear picture of life as a black/colored person in the early 50's.  This book makes you questions the legal rights that a person has to his/her body.  You will understand how sometimes the well educated cannot communicate effectively to those less educated.  In my mind, it is a must read for all.
1932907009|5.0|SAVE THE CAT, THE LAST BOOK ON SCREENWRITING THAT YOU'LL EVER NEED may have just saved my writing. As an aspiring author, I've struggled over the years as I've grown and learned how to write fiction. I've read a handful of books on the craft of writing but none have compared to SAVE THE CAT by Blake Snyder.<br /><br />If you are a fiction writer, don't let the fact that SAVE THE CAT is about screenwriting cause you to look the other way. It has all the elements needed to write a novel. And not just any novel. One that has everything needed for a great story. It even touches on how to promote and sell your work.<br /><br />In other books I've read on the craft, they were not able to cover all the basics in such precise, easy to understand and visually pleasing ways as SAVE THE CAT.<br /><br />A few things I've learned from SAVE THE CAT?<br /><br />1) You must be able to answer the question, \\"It's about a guy who...\\"<br /><br />2) You need a great logline.<br /><br />3) A primal goal is a must.<br /><br />4) Spice up the back-story so it's not boring.<br /><br />5) An ARC in every character a must...except the bad guy.<br /><br />6) Give every character a limp or an eye patch.<br /><br />And so much more, including:<br /><br />The dos and don'ts to creating a great story.<br />A checklist for the lead characters, and<br />How to build the perfect novel.<br /><br />To date, SAVE THE CAT is the best writing book I've read, one that will have a huge impact on my writing.
B004R13U6Y|4.0|this app works great on my evo 4g. the features are great and it makes reading pdfs. on my phone so much easier. I turn my ebooks from college into pdfs and read the chapters on my phone when I'm out so having a good PDF reader on my phone is a must. I love that I can have it rearrange the words on the PDF pages so that I can make the words bigger and read the pages without having to scroll side to side.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I borrowed STEP UP from my library. I'd caught a glimpse of the trailer and liked the music with an upbeat tempo.<br /><br />What I hadn't expected was an engaging movie with great acting and a storyline that were both moving and captivating. I'd loved Channing Tatum in DEAR JOHN and SHE'S THE MAN, and he didn't disappoint in STEP UP. Who knew he could dance as well as act?<br /><br />An overachieving dancer, Nora Clark, played by Jenna Dewan-Tatum, loses her dance partner before an important performance due to an injury. Tyler Gage, played by Channing Tatum, is a rough, streetwise guy is doing community service at the school for performing arts where Nora attends. Faced without a partner, Nora takes a chance and asks Tyler to step up to the challenge. Tyler, though hesitant, steps out of his comfort zone into an unknown world. One he never dreamed he'd be a part of but now envisions.<br /><br />Take a chance and STEP UP to hope, faith, and your dreams.
0375836675|3.0|I stole this from my wife's library basket one weekend.  And it was a real page-turning story.  But it didn't cross over the line from fiction to literature--and in fact, borrowed more than a little from two other novels that do successfully cross that line.  And what is perhaps worse, this is a book that tantalizes the reader with some interesting philosophical questions, but then ends up failing to bear the philosophical scrutiny it awakens.    The plot of \\"I Am the Messenger\\" is powered by mystery: an unambitious protagonist who is wasting away his life with a circle of equally unambitious friends begins receiving cryptic messages which entangle him in the lives of needy characters.  Some of those entanglements require mere acts of kindness, others require troubling moral choices, but all of them require detective work, code-breaking, and introspective reflections on his own past--hence the mystery.  And the mystery is engrossing: who is sending the messages, what does the latest message mean, who is the person who must be helped, what consequences will it entail, and where will it all lead?  Tantalizing questions guaranteed to keep you reading.    The novel suffers from a few major problems, however.  First, Zusak rather shamelessly pilfers his plot devices from two other well-known (and much better written) works of literature: Paul Auster's \\"City of Glass\\" and John Fowles' \\"The Magus,\\" whose protagonists are similarly sent packing by, respectively, a metaphysical search and a mystery puppeteer.  Second, the most troubling of the acts Zusak's protagonist must perform turns out to have been a charade, of sorts, which retrospectively casts a questionable moral light on the whole affair.  Third, the protagonist's love interest--the object of his incessant and psychotic obsessing--purports to be uninterested in him romantically because he lacks ambition, but she works at exactly the same dead-end job he does, wastes away her time with the very same friends, and demonstrates no more ambition than he does. Which begs the question (spoiler!) of why he would remain interested in her (and she in him) after his mystery engagements manage to transform his life without transforming hers.    In the end, the book raises some very interesting philosophical questions about self-identity, human relationships, and moral choices.  Unfortunately, when the reader begins to ask those very questions about the various characters and events in the book, they all begin to unravel.  So, I would say the book is definitely engrossing, but ultimately disappointing.  (And I definitely wouldn't classify this as young-adult fiction)
B003UESJ9M|5.0|The first time I saw the ad for COUNTRY STRONG, I immediately made a mental note to see the movie. Like so often is the case, I didn't make it to the theater. Lucky for me, my library had the DVD. I'm a country lover and that was my main attraction to COUNTRY STRONG. I also like Gwyneth Paltrow and Tim McGraw. Both great actors.<br /><br />What little I knew of the movie was that it was about a country singer Kelly Canter, played by Gwyneth Paltrow, coming out of rehab for alcohol addiction. Her husband and manger, played by Tim McGraw, is driven to push Kelly to her limit to become a success in her music career.<br /><br />I didn't known Gwyneth sang, and was surprised to discover that not only does she sing, but she's quite good. But Gwyneth wasn't the only one who could sing. A second set of characters had their own storyline.<br /><br />The slow growing romance between Chilies Stanton, played by Leighton Meester, and Beau Hutton, played by Garrett Hedlund, will warm your heart as you are taken along on their compelling stories. I thought the main focus would be on Gwyneth's character, Kelly, which in part was why the added story of Chiles and Beau was such a pleasant surprise. Their back-story, their growing romance, and great voices had me wanting a story of their own. With Leighton's beautiful voice, and Garrett's unique gravely sound, purchasing the soundtrack is a must.<br /><br />COUNTRY STRONG was a great movie but what really won me over was the ending. There's nothing like a final shocker, as well as a happily ever after.

B004M9ZI0M|5.0|The final Opus of William Shakespeare was carried to the big screen with that required vision, secure pulse and distinguished visuals without lacking the spirit of the play.<br /><br />Helen Mirren is actually (Who can deny it?)one of the three best actresses in the world. She chews the whole show all the way through. But additionally the narrative rhtyhm never decays. Taymor (The Lion king and Titus, proves by far how domains Shakespeare's nerve) never abuses of the visual effects (dislike many of her colleagues).<br /><br />And the outcome could not be more succesful. One of the best twenty films of the last year. No doubt it and go for it.
B00004UB1O|4.0|Ignore the 1 star reviews. This is a live album. I've heard better sound quality but the energy and enthusiasm and love of the music more than makes up for any nit-picky technical criticisms. Why Led Zeppelin fans would want to tear down arguably one of the only relevant rock bands in the entire country is beyond me.  The Crowes are virtually alone carrying the banner of the true spirit of rock and roll. LZ fans need to stop complaining and get on board because in a world full of Katie Perrys a new Led Zeppelin for this generation has no chance.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Bar none the best mini-series I have ever seen!!!  The intricate details given to the series rivals that of the LOTR trilogy!!! The opening sequence alone got me hooked...and man are the scores very impressive.  I don't know how they did it but all of the actors are well versed and believable.  Can't wait to buy the series and add it to my movie collection!
0553108034|5.0|A Clash of Kings does a great job of continuing the story started in A Game of Thrones.  George R. R. Martin continues his epic story by keeping us guessing with what is coming next.  If you have not started reading this series, buy the first book and then buy this book.
B001DJ7PNW|5.0|First, the Blu-ray transfer of the movie is outstanding.  The images are blu-ray perfect and the soundtrack is exceptional. The five stars are for the transfer although the film itself also deserves five stars.         Second, the booklet portion of this version gave a little background info on the movie but had a lot of filler.  22 of the 34 pages of the included booklet are dedicated to actor biographies.  Of the remaining pages there is very sparse text and unremarkable photos.  If you are deciding between buying the blu-ray \\"disc only\\" version or the blu-ray \\"disc with the book version,\\" my suggestion would be just buy the disc only version. There is much more information online about the movie than you'll find in the pages of the book version.
0757302661|4.0|I really loved the book more than I thought I would.  They really should re-name the method, I think hypnobirthing throws people off, but the concept of relaxation and visualizing is so simple.  Every woman should be educated on what is happening to her body during childbirth so she can master her fears and look forward to a beautiful birth.  my one and only complaint was that although my order was supposed to be in good condition, it didn't come with the dvd so I feel like I wasted the purchase since I want it and will have to buy a brand new one anyway.

B004LQ1XBY|4.0|I've long thought that Hugh Laurie could do no wrong (although recent seasons of House have tried my patience sorely)--but I purchased this CD with trepidation. Taking on the masters of New Orleans blues is a pretty ballsy move for anyone. And yet, I was surprised.     The two pieces I thought I could never like turned out to be my favorites: Hugh does a yearning version of Saint James Infirmary that in no way attempts to compete with Louis Armstrong's 1928 recording--which is a good move, because Louis is the closest thing to Heaven on Earth. The pseudo-classical piano intro leads into a slippery instrumental run, before our first hearing of Hugh's spot on N'awlin's accent and his distinctive liquid \\"Js\\", builds nicely, with the upright bass worked wonderfully by David Piltch. We listen to many pleasantly turned songs that Hugh details in the liner notes as long-time favorites of his--all adequate, if at times overwhelmed by Allen Toussaint's horn arrangements--almost ready to dismiss the album as a marked step above a novelty, when Hugh's piano jolts several handfuls of out of place notes, and the ears perk up just in time for him to roll into a lazy version of Tipitina that distills the essence of Roy Byrd's genius without trying to duplicate the unreachable excitement of his playing. I never thought I'd write this, but Hugh actually makes that song his own, by bringing a less frantic pace to this classic.     Hugh's playing on piano and guitar is as good as I've ever heard him, the photographs in the booklet show his effortless attractiveness, and his vocals, while nothing fancy, are strong and expressive. I will return to this CD often, and would love to see Hugh try his hand at more obscure blues bits--I'd buy that!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I absolutely loved this app until I had to reset my phone. From then on I could not dl anywhere. It says that it supports 1.6 os everywhere on discussions that are older than a week or so. Literally I had the app yesterday morning an hour later I could not dl it. Customer support cannot explain why I could have it and now not. The most they can say is it doesn't support 1.6 only 2.1 or 2.2 whatever it is. I want my kindle app back!
B004HS1L9U|5.0|The Long Walk is truly a remarkable book. Slavomir Rawicz, and many other men during World War II were charged unjustly for crimes they did not commit. Slavomir was sentenced to the Gulag in Siberia. The Long Walk is Rawicz's account of the price he and other men had to pay to gain freedom. They had to suffer through the Siberian tundra, the Gobi Desert, the rugged Himalayas, starvation, and walked over 4,000 miles. While trudging through the Gobi Desert Slavomir stated, \\"In the shadow of death we grew closer together than ever before. No man would admit to despair. No man spoke of fear. The only thought spoken out again and again was that there must be water soon. All our hope was in this.\\"     This book reminded me of how often I take my freedom for granted. We are all indebted to all those men, not just American men, who have died so we could enjoy the freedoms we do today.  Rawicz stated \\"I hope The Long Walk will remain as a memorial to all those who live and die for freedom, and for all those who for many reasons could not speak for themselves.\\"    I could not put down this book once I turned the first page, it will continually tear at your emotions. I would highly recommend reading this extraordinary book!
B000FCKGPC|2.0|This book is very anticlimatic compared to the happenings in the third one. Very slow paced, we read about a bunch of new characters (too much character development) and almost nothing about the usual ones (i.e. no Jon Snow, Daenerys, Bran..)
159562015X|5.0|I recently ordered Strengths Finder 2.0 and found the information very beneficial.  Everyone in my office has taken this assessment and it is very interesting to see where each of our strengths are and how to allow each person to work in those strengths.  We are able to compliment each other quite well and the assessment has assisted in that.  I highly recommend this product and believe the workforce would benefit if employees  were given the freedom to work in their strengths.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|This runs great on my EVO. smooth, only lags barely at the ends of levels, which is no big deal. The big problem, and the reason for only 3 stars, is the progress is deleted every other time I run the app. Glad I got this for free on launch day, cuz I wouldn't pay to have a game that does that.

B0007MWZEK|5.0|I bought this product on sale at a local retailer for $10. This thing does a good job and I don't have to fiddle with a dust pan.  It is not a vacuum cleaner by any stretch of the imagination but it picks up dust and even buffs my laminate hardwood floors a bit.  I'm satisfied.
0470901071|5.0|This has been my first introduction to Lammle's literature. I have read through several related test prep books geared towards objective training for the CCNA, including Cisco's own. Todd not only correlates exam covered material needed to master objectives set by Cisco, but also outlines real day to day necessary tools needed in the work place. It is hard to find guides that reach even the most technical questions and make them so easily broken down as this one while not just \\"drinking the kool-aid\\" and regurgitating cisco related media. I highly recommend it for any test takers-to be.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|This is an excellent movie and any complaints about it can be attributed to 1 of 2 things: Failure to read the source material or, random criticism just because you have a chance. The acting is really good and once you get into the story, it's pretty fun. Although there are flaws, this is still a great movie and this is coming from a longtime fan of the original novels, and by that, I mean I own the complete series in a box set. So, check it out!
B00406UK7S|1.0|I watched this after having immensely enjoyed the 2011 film The Eagle, having been told it was similiar.    Boy was my friend mistaken.    What I found instead was akin to the Carry-On team does The Eagle of the Ninth. No respect was paid to historical accuracy, nor Roman/Pictish battle tactics. Story and character seems to have been thrown out of the window. It contains probably the shortest seige in cinematic history [why the Picts take the commander hostage, I have no idea - he would have either been decapitated or enslaved]. Basically the film is one extended chase scene, who needs a plot anyway?    I switched it off after forty minutes. If you're interested in the story of the Legion IX, I recommend Kevin MacDonald's The Eagle.    This film was made suspiciously around the same time as MacDonald's The Eagle in 2009 [which had been held back while MacDonald filmed State of Play.] I can only imagine the Marshall heard that Sutcliff's book was being optioned and decided to pump this dirge out fast.    But just as Dante's Peak outshone Volcano, MacDonald's The Eagle is far superior in every aspect. Where The Eagle carries the hallmark of a cult classic, this be quickly forgotten.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Not really sure how much of a difference it makes, but not terribly expensive, easy to use, and should last a number of uses. Temperatures were fine so I guess it didn't *not* work.
B00008BXJG|5.0|Released months before the death of Bon Scott, Highway To Hell was AC/DC's step out of being just an Australian bar band to a bonafide arena sensation.  This was cememnted with their follow up Back In Black with Brian Johnson on vocals.  Anyway, back to this album.    Bon Scott is my favorite vocalist/frontman/badass of all time.  He and Angus and the boys put out classic 70s rock that still stands the test of time.  Some people bash AC/DC for having such a long career out of what many believe is just simple rock music and suggestive lyrics filled with sexual innuendos.  Isn't that what rock and roll is all about?  Seriously; you really can't go wrong with \\"Shot Down In Flames\\", \\"Touch Too Much\\", \\"If You Want Blood (You've Got It)\\", \\"Girl's Got Rhythm\\" and the iconic title cut.    Classic in every way
B0018O4YT0|5.0|Dark City has been my favorite movie since I saw it in the theater in 1998 and this director cut version is better. Despite what is said in Jeff Shannon's idiotic review the film has plenty of substance. With Mr. Shannon saying \\"Dark City\\" has precious little heart and soul,\\" it makes me wonder if he watched the same film I have. I guess people like Mr. Shannon just are not able to comprehend this film.    I would definitely recommend this film to anyone, particularly Sci-Fi fans.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|The Foo Fighters have always been one of those bands I liked.  I never loved them.  They always seemed to be missing something for me.    I heard an advertisement for Wasting Light on TV one day and they said it was a \\"Motorhead muscle car with a Beatles engine\\".  Considering I'm a huge fan of both those bands and liked the Foos, my ears perked up.      After downloading \\"Rope\\", I got the whole album and I loved it.  The songs just spoke to me; especially \\"Walk\\".  From start to finish, this album is filled with everything a rock music fan loves.  There's heavy riffs, melody, screams, singing, poetic lyrics, and an overall great vibe.       In closing, this is the album that made the Foo Fighters one of my favorite bands.    Can't wait till they play Boston!
B0019N8P2W|4.0|It is a little sad to think how everything has changed in the past ten years. Parents with steady jobs, no one worrying about gas prices. Fashion club spends nice amount of money on useless teenage stuff. Bets with good chunks of money. It is like watching a pre-depression era movie in the midst of Great Depression.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|I wish.  This is a typical macho detective action adventure book featuring a hero that all guys aspire to be like, reminiscent of James Bond.  I've read plenty of these type of books before but I can see why Lee Child is so popular as the only author that I know that gives him a run for his money in this genre is Harlan Coben.  I went to bed at 2am last night as I just had to finish this book. I did not want to put it down.  If you like action books or action movies. Read it.
1401324029|4.0|Naked Heat turned out to be the book that I wanted to read when I picked up the first book of the series, Heat Wave.  This second book in Richard Castle's Nikki Heat series, published to tie-in with the hit ABC show Castle, was much more substantial than the first, and an all-round better read.  The plot revolves around the death of a not-much-liked gossip columnist, Cassidy Towne, and around uncovering the many layers that obscure the reason for her death.  To add to the drama, Nikki Heat and Jameson Rook have not seen each other for a while, and the way in which they reconnect at the beginning of Naked Heat sets the stage for some interesting byplay in their (re)developing relationship.  Of course, this plotline echoes the Season 3 premiere of the show, in which Castle is found with the victim of a murder, and this initial tie-in sets the stage for the rest of the book.     Many of the issues that I did not like with the first book didn't arise in the second.  Naked Heat was even more solidly plotted, with an engaging mystery and characters (suspects and victims) that were varied and interesting.  There was a much better sense of polish, with lots of attention being paid to producing a well told story, and not so much going to establishing the book as a tie-in to the show.  It certainly benefitted from this treatment, as well as possibly from the fact that the writer(s) simply may have had more time to work on this one.  Both Heat Wave and Naked Heat contain vastly entertaining, not unduly taxing, extremely engaging `whodunit' mysteries, but Naked Heat does it much, much better.     In Naked Heat, there's also a much clearer distinction drawn between Richard Castle and Jameson Rook, as well as Kate Beckett and Nikki Heat.  While the conceit of asking the reader to see the show's characters in the ones on the page still applies, Rook and Heat seem more fully drawn, with identifiably separate personalities from their television counterparts.  As much as I want to beable to `see' something of Beckett and Castle in the main characters of the books, I also want Rook and Heat to not merely be carbon copies, but to be able to stand on their own as well-rounded characters.  After reading the first book, I thought that maybe I was expecting too much, but in Naked Heat this expectation was well realized.     Jameson Rook is a more abrasive character than Richard Castle.  He's a little less likeable and so it's definitely not as easy to forgive his foibles. Additionally, Rook comes over as more self-serving than Castle and, along with some other minor differences, this serves to give Rook more ground to stand on as a character in his own right.  The same can be said for Nikki Heat, who is a little rougher, a little less tolerant, and quite a bit `sluttier' (to use the show's term) than Kate Beckett.  At the same time, Nikki is clearly seen to be working through the conflicts of what she wants in her personal life, especially as it concerns Rook, and this serves to make her as likeable and engaging as Beckett, while still establishing that she is someone different.     What didn't change between the first and second books of the series were the references to the show, which added another interesting level on which to read the book.  Once you're a fan of the TV series, you can't help but notice the not-so-subtle references to the show and it feels like you're discovering little treasures along the way.  The practice in the show to referencing other projects which the stars have done (especially Nathan Fillion's `Firefly') also makes its appearance in the book, and enhances that level of enjoyment.  There's one surprise however, that belongs purely to the book and was utterly hilarious, with the potential for lots more gags in upcoming books.  The theme in the book of people having secrets is extended to Jameson Rook having one of his own, and the results are very, very funny indeed.     I also felt that more research went into this book, as there were lots of minor details about people and especially places that was missing from the first - at least for me - and really made this book come alive.  It's those things that, as a reader, you'd never know if they weren't there unless you're an expert on the subject, but when they are included, makes for a much richer reading experience and makes the story come alive.  This is something that I tend to look for, and I'll always give kudos to an author who does this for me.     I was really surprised when I realized that I was only about ten pages from the end.  On the heels of that surprise was disappointment - I was truly sorry when Naked Heat ended, and that's a feeling a reader always wants to have at the end of a book.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book was the best book I have read all year...I read it in one night as I couldn't put it down and reread it two days later cause I couldn't stop thinking about it!!
1416596097|1.0|This book could have been so much better.  The characters were somewhat one dimensional and the moral themes have been explored endlessly (and, frankly, more distinctly) in the media since the \\"War on Terror\\" began.  This may be better than le Carre's more recent work, but it is not better than his earliest books.
0811875040|3.0|I own a great number of baking books. This one is certainly one of the prettiest, with scalloped page edges, mouthwatering photos and delicious-sounding recipes that have a tweak or two to make them different from recipes in other books. Why only 3 stars? First of all, most of the recipes call for unusual small cake pans (6-inch rounds, 7-inch tart pans, 8 x 4 inch loaf pans) that most home bakers, including me, don't have. I don't feel like buying special sizes just to be able to make the recipes in this book. Secondly, I have only tried two recipes so far but both had mistakes in them. The Banana Bread with Nutty Streusel had far too much streusel. Even half was too much. Then the Fleur de Sel Caramels call for 1/4 cup Fleur de Sel for sprinkling. To look like the illustration only requires about a teaspoon in all. I am wondering how many more errors are in the book. Highly disappointing! As a coffee table book, it deserves 5 stars but as a baking book, it does not rate more than 3.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|All I have to say is for the quality, style, and comfort of this backpack for your DSLR you won't find a better price anywhere. The cheapest backpack I found was maybe $50 and it was considerably smaller than this. Not to mention my Nikon Camera Bag was $65 at Best Buy and I hate to say that I basically paid that amount for a logo, because the bag really does nothing for my camera as far as support and safety. Great Buy
B0036T31YY|1.0|I stuck it out for the entire movie hoping something in how it ended would make it worth watching the same scene play over and over again too many times.  This was one of the most boring and meaningless movies I have ever seen.  The last part is slightly more informative than the earlier repeats, so if you decide to watch this movie, save yourself and fast forward when the same events start happening a 2nd time, and go to about 10 or 15 minutes from the end and watch from there.  You will miss nothing important and maybe you can make sense of it -- I couldn't.

B004EPYZPS|3.0|This is a good sci-fi movie, about some teenagers making a zombie movie when a huge train accident occurs and these little white cubes get thrown around everywhere.

(Hint--could be!)  \\"Do not speak of this, or they will KILL you. . . and your parents!\\"<br /><br />A Stephen Spielberg production, filmed in West Virginia.  Don't forget to watch the credits at the end for a little extra show.

B004EPZ07K|4.0|In this case, \\"good\\" is emerald green, the color of \\"will\\" vs. \\"bad\\" yellow, the color of \\"fear\\".  The intergalactic peacekeepers were the green good guys.  But the good guys were getting bumped off by the fear energy, which continued to gain strength as it sucked the life-force energy out of every green man it came into contact with.  As one of the head good guys is dying on earth, after his space ship crashes, he sets his emerald ring to seek out and find someone to take his place.  The ring finds an earthling.<br /><br />It's a cute, fun movie.  If you watch the end credits, you get the impression there is a route for a Green Lantern #2.

The sand worms, the spice, and the control of water are all here.  The book and the film are both too long to summarize here, but trust me, if you enjoyed the book, you will love the film.  You'll either love it or hate it.  Many people who haven't read the novel won't get this film.  I frankly love it and highly recommend it to all true Sci-Fi hard core fans.
B003UESJH4|5.0|It's been 24+ hours since I watched The King's Speech, and I am still smiling whenever I think about it. What a tremendous movie! Funny, touching, inspirational, richly acted, soul stirring...you name it, and any positive adjective you can think of would apply to The King's Speech.<br /><br />This movie is so much more than just the chronicle of the speech impediment of King George VI. Beginning before he ever thought about assuming the throne, Bertie (as his family called him) struggled mightily from childhood with a stammer that kept him on edge at all times. His beloved wife Elizabeth finds one more possible therapist, a Lionel Logue, whose methods are unconventional and who insists from the word go that Bertie will do things his way if he expects to see results. And there are results indeed, but a major setback strikes when Bertie's older brother David abdicates the throne. Not only must Bertie take over, he must now live his life very much in the public eye, and all this in the shadow of an increasingly volatile Hitler.<br /><br />Colin Firth has long been a favorite of mine, and he absolutely shines as the shy Bertie. His is an Oscar so well deserved, but there is not a performance in The King's Speech that is sub-par. Helena Bonham Carter is superb as the loving Elizabeth; Michael Gambon is both regal and imposing as King George V; and Geoffrey Rush is so wonderfully perfect as Lionel Logue that words simply fail me. Rush can convey with a simple look so very much and his chemistry with the stammering Firth is both touching and hilarious.<br /><br />Filled with awkward and funny moments, this movie is beyond wonderful. Even the soundtrack is perfect,with the stunning denouement both rousing and ominous. I simply cannot recommend it highly enough.<br /><br />As an aside, it is helpful if you know a little about British history, including the relationship between Edward VIII and Wallis Simpson, but it is not crucial to the enjoyment of the film. I just felt that it helped me to flesh out the relationships among the royals, but I would still have enjoyed this glorious movie nonetheless.relationships among the royals, but I would still have enjoyed this glorious movie nonetheless.

I was bored the entire movie and wishing that ends soon, the characters are simple and do not have any charm, the plot have cliches and its not original,  not a bad movie at all but i think that was a error have payed 30$ for this, i recommend save your money for better releases and better movies.

0525423273|4.0|If you're thinking that ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS by Stephanie Perkins sounds silly or trite, push that thought out of your head right now. This book is not whatever you're thinking it is--and I bet I was thinking the same thing you were when I first heard about it. After all, the book has been out for close to a year now and despite all the rave reviews I've read, I just...had no interest in reading this book. It sounded like a straight-forward romance. I mean, it has \\"kiss\\" in the title. (When sold at auction, the book was titled ANNA AND THE BOY MASTERPIECE, which isn't much better...) The cover is so light and breezy. You would think this is a straightforward romance for teens, right?<br /><br />Wrong, wrong, wrong. This book will defy every one of your expectations going into it. It's not even about French kissing. I mean, sure, there are characters that make-out, but this book is not about a girl obsessed with kissing a cute boy. Yes, it's about falling in love for the first time, but it's also so much more. I picked this book up before going to bed thinking it would put me to sleep. I was up late finishing this book and bleary-eyed for work in the morning!<br /><br />The novel revolves around a girl named Anna, whose father decides to ship her off to a boarding school in Paris for her senior year of high school. She's forced to leave her mother and brother, as well as her friends and the boy she was about to start dating. Not only that, Anna doesn't speak a word of French. She's dreading the year to come and furious at her father. Anna is fortunate in that she makes friends with Meredith, her new next-door neighbor, and immediately has a circle of people to make friends with. This includes, of course, &Eacute;tienne St. Claire, a swoon-worthy male she stands no chance with. He already has a girlfriend, for one thing. For another, he only sees her as a friend. The heart of ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS is in the way Perkins builds her character relationships, not just between Anna and &Eacute;tienne, but everyone else as well. The friendships are solid; readers will wish they had been part of such a close-knit group in school. The author has a way of creating moments that will break your heart, ones that will make you go back and re-read certain passages after finishing the book (Hands up if you did. Don't be shy! I did, too...), ones that hover as delicately as a butterfly, making you want to stay on that one page forever. The characterization reminds me a lot of [[ASIN:0061996165 Unearthly]] by Cynthia Hand, another book that took me by surprise this year. I'm a sucker for well-written characters that have me rooting for everyone, even minor characters.<br /><br />The best thing about ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS is that it has no cliffhanger ending. It's not part of a series designed to leave you hanging between books. Granted, you'll still want to know what happens to various characters, but Perkins has stated that we'll be seeing cameos in this fall's [[ASIN:0525423281 Lola and the Boy Next Door]](Sept. 29, 2011), and ISLA AND THE HAPPILY EVER AFTER (Fall 2012). I cannot wait to read both of these, as well as any other books Perkins writes in the future. I tend to like books that take place at boarding schools--and ones with boys who live next door, so these books are win/win for me!tienne, but everyone else as well.

B0051T47NQ|4.0|This film demonstrates how mockumentaries should be made. The film never takes itself too serious and is just plain fun. The trolls look like doofy monsters from the Grimms Fairy-Tales and are not like the monsters you see in animated kid flicks. As Troll Hunter explains, fairy-tales and real life are not the same. Trolls are just dumb animals and as animals they act on their instinctive behavior. And why are the trolls in the movie being hunted down? Well, you will see if you watch the movie.    Now even though this movie is just for fun, do not think it is all people trying to kill trolls. There are some clever elements thrown in for people that pay attention. I found the way things were explained how trolls are affected differently by sunlight interesting (hey, for a fake movie the logic made sense). I also like the way some classic fairy-tale elements (think of some goats and a bridge) and Norwegian folklore were brought in to explain troll behavior. I also like the fact there are different kinds of trolls instead of the same CGI creature reappearing over and over again. Each troll has a distinctive personality and level of danger. I also liked the way natural occurrences people take for granted throughout the film are explained cleverly as troll behavior.     The action scenes are well worth the wait and the acting is good for a low budget independent film about hunting down trolls. Is the film an Academy Award winner? By no means! Is it a fun movie to sit back to and enjoy? Absolutely! I would recommend at least finding a way to rent this movie. It's well worth 1 hr and 44 minutes of your time.
1594744769|5.0|The story was well written, but the characters had a very \\"forced\\" feeling to them. From the young white rapper with no skills but 20 pounds in gold around his neck, to the best friend with a broken down car, dyed hair, and a studded leather jacket, this book reeks of someone who has forgotten their youth and instead have used stereotypical teens for the filler, only the teens that were used were stereotypical about 15 years ago. It reminds me of when my father tried to fit in with me when I was in high school. Other than that, the book was well written. The story was simple. The main review speaks of plot twists and mystery, however be assured that none of this exists in this book. Don't take me wrong, I do suggest this book. It is a good read. However do not expect to read something of depth when picking it up, it is at best a book to read as you sit by the pool. A story that will be both quickly finished and quickly forgotten, similar to a high school quarterback. My advice, get it from the library as you will likely never read it again, but it is worth reading once.

B000LPS3B2|5.0|This movie is a great entry into the Thai horror market and is definately worth picking up and seeing.  The movie is atmospheric and creepy and is definately worth seeing.  This movie is phenominal condsidering how small the Thai horror market is.  So far, from Thai horror, I have not gone wrong at all, as this movie was great as was Art of the Devil as well.      The movie is shot very well, and the acting is not bad at all.  Secondly the storyline is great and is devoid of plotholes.  Once the flashbacks and the backstory start, you are in for a real treat, as that is when the real creepyness begins.  I am not going to give away the ending, but I must say the ending is absolutely AWESOME, and leaves you with your jaw dropped, secondly the 1st half is a great build-up to a turbulent, action packed, exciting second half, that you will certainly not forget.      The movie definately takes aspects of the Ringu, Ju-On and the Excorcist and masterfully melds them into one great horror movie.  While the movie is not overly original in its scares or portrayal of creepy long-haired women, the movie does add a great Thai flavor in its incorporation of Buddhism.    The basic jist of the movie follows Tun (a professional photographer) and his girlfriend Jane.  Tun starts seeing ghostly images in his photography.  Throughout the movie the hauntings by the ghost turn out to get more and more intense, culminating in a final physical showdown and one hell of a great ending with a nasty twist!  Jane in the mean time, does some investigation into the haunting and learns some pretty dark things about her boyfriend's past that certainly explain why an angry spectre is out to get him.      Definately get this movie and keep it for you collection as it is a keeper! The movie is creepy and exciting and keeps you wanting to know what is coming next.  Not to mention they gave the perfect creepy, karmatic conclusion to this movie.  I definately recommend this you will not be disappointed at all.      Please see this one before seeing the American remake.  The American remake of this movie with its huge budget and high tech camera equipment is an ABSOLUTE DISASTER!

B003TJ4YU6|3.0|Although these shows are of high historical value, I found the picture and sound on this particular release to be not much better than the original SOFA DVD issued a few years ago. There is a little more bass and less overall compression in the sound but the audience noise (screaming) is still painful. The picture displays more contrast at the expense of gray-area detail and less overall brightness.    If you already have these shows on DVD, there's not enough improvement here to justify buying them again.

I didn't find the concluding comments, entitled, \\"Meanwhile, Back on the Wall,\\" amusing. Mr. Martin wasted my time and lost me as a reader.
B001N1DPDE|1.0|Initially impressive, heavy, feels industructable, sheath is fairly nice however i found it a pain to pull it out quickly.   I was using it to de-branch a tree that was cut down with the Cold Steel Trail Boss (Five Star axe) and it worked okay, certianlly the axe helped more, but after a half dozen large trees I noticed that the handle had almost broken in two, rather the poly-ur-a-thang (Spell check, hah) part of the handle, i suspect either the vibrations of the act or it may have hit a rock and cracked, either way both of those situations should not have broken what is supposed to be a heavy-duty knife.  I hope that mine was simply defective, there are many positive reviews.
B000JSI79O|5.0|I have always enjoyed this show.  It is one of the few shows that I have ever purchased on DVD that I actually watch over and over again.  The thing I like the most is that there is a little something for everyone, both women and men will find plenty to enjoy in this series.  One of the things that I can really recommend about this show is that if you will enjoy the first episode as much as the last, they are all good.

0439023521|5.0|Now I understand the hype surrounding this book and trilogy! The Hunger Games is the perfect blend of fast-paced suspense, carefully constructed plot, and a brilliantly written main character.    At the beginning of the novel, we are introduced to 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who lives with her mother and sister in the poor, coal-mining District 12 (society in North America has been reduced to a country called Panem--with a rich, ruling Capitol and 12 scattered, mostly poor, districts). The Capitol keeps its districts in line by entering one teenage girl and one teenage boy from each district in the yearly Hunger Games, which is basically a brutal televised competition, in which competitors fight to the death. When Katniss' younger sister's name is drawn as the female Tribute from District 12, Katniss unhesitatingly takes her place in the Games. She will have to use all her wits and talents to outsmart and beat out the other competitors.    Dystopian science fiction is not my favorite genre, so I was skeptical about how much I'd like this book. I was amazed by how quickly I was sucked into the story and characters' world. Suzanne Collins is a truly gifted writer, who has imagined this world that grabs hold of the reader and does not let go! Each chapter leaves you on the edge of your seat, \\"hungering\\" for more (sorry...I couldn't help myself!). I recommend this book to anyone (13-14 years old and up) who loves a good story...you will not be disappointed!

B004UA8D2S|4.0|If you get by the first 20 min with its cheesy cliché script it does start to get much better. Granted the acting wasn't that great but never the less its an exciting film if you just let yourself imagine that you are in that situation. I don't mind tight spaces as long as there is a clear way out but if you throw water in there you couldn't pay me enough money to go down there and I think thats what draws you into this movie.    Its also refreshing to see a cave movie that doesn't have some kind of creature trying to kill them, those types of horrors like \\"decent\\" or \\"the cave\\" take away from the truly scary and very real killer that is the cave its self.    Forget those critics who have lost sight of what watching a movie is all about and just be entertained. Critics are like junkies their first film is a great high and then they spend the rest of the time trying to re live that moment but no film ever lives up to it so they just spend their time complaining.    The Blu Ray has amazing Quality in both Picture and Audio.    I will watch this again maybe not anytime soon, it is worth renting if not owning.
B001QWBM62|4.0|I gave the recorder a 4-star review because the hardware seems solid but it just created an unplayable WAV file for me.    I had a newly formatted 16GB SD memory card and fresh batteries in the recorder and adjusted the recording levels to peak at about -6dB since I wasn't sure what peaks might come along later in this live recording session. I started the recorder and let it run while I attended to other duties. At the end of the program the display on the H4n told me the memory card was full. That should NOT have been the case at all since the session did not exceed 2 hours.    Loading the memory card into the computer I was presented with a 0 Byte WAV file in Windows 7. Then I used some 3rd party file recovery software and came up with a WAV file in excess of 15 GB. I saved it on the hard drive but Windows is unable to play it. This is either a problem with the recorder or with the memory card - I don't know which. Even if it is the fault of the card, I tend to blame the recorder for not handling the error more gracefully. After all, that memory card was formatted by this very recorder and if there was any problem, it should have somehow nixed that card.

I thought I was supposed to receive a new copy. Maybe it was used and scrated?
B0007OY2P8|4.0|If you like Brit costume drama, then add this version to your colletion.  Yes, the music is lousy at points but settings, costumes and acting are great.  Overall, I think this version is better than the newer ones.  I have owned the video version of this and find the DVD copy just fine.  The sound was especially improved over my video version.  It seems all scenes were transfered intact in to the DVD.
B000SMWUPS|5.0|This is PERFECT for my Phil & Teds. It is very spacious, has plenty of room for 2 drinks, 2 smart phones, keys and even more stuff. The reason this works well for Phil and Teds is because it is collapsible, and I don't have to remove this when I fold the stroller, it just collapses along with the stroller so it doesn't take up any extra space when it is folded. One less thing to remove and put on again when folding. Also, the price can't be beat!! Great product.
0446530573|5.0|It never failed: I'd watch The Sopranos and get hungry.  Nearly every episode featured food and all the characters enjoyed it so much.  While I have very few skills in the world of Italian cooking, I have to say that my rigatoni and sausage is amazing now, thanks to this book.  It's fun to read all the little insights into the characters and recipes, as well.    Of course, this is done tongue-in-cheek, but once you taste the delicious food, you won't care.  You'll feel like Carmella presenting Sunday dinner.
B00000IQW5|2.0|I love this movie.  I love it.  But this is a bad DVD.  Technically it's widescreen, but it doesn't adapt to widescreen TVs.  This means that you'll have black bars on all four sides of your screen.  The sound is also lacking.  The planes need to be louder.  Bone rattling loud!  Anyhow, if it wasn't for me really needing an Always fix, I'd pass this one up and wait for a real DVD or Blu-Ray.  Ideally, this movie gets a really good Blu-Ray treatment.  I'd buy it.
B002U0KHMY|4.0|White Collar is one of a number of outstanding shows currently on USA Network. The premise is similar to Eddie Murphy's classic 48 Hours. Take a cop and team him up with one of the criminals he caught and see what type of fun ensues.  In this case we have Peter Burke (Tim DeKay), head of the FBI's White Collar Crime Division in New York, and Neal Caffrey (Matt Bomer) a charming, good hearted, forger, art thief, and con-man.  Burke has tracked down and put Cafferey behind bars twice but now can use the crafty crook to help him solve some of the Bureau's toughest cases.  The chemistry between the two leads is great and the supporting cast is outstanding.  All in all, a very fresh and entertaining series.

B002VPE1AW|1.0|I am sure many have bashed this movie and those who did are the most intelligent beings on earth. This is a movie plagiarized from Dances with Wolves, Apocalypse Now, Pocahontas, The New World, Phantom Menace. A failed epic in magnitude proportions.

1936594153|5.0|I first read this novel when I was in high school.  It was one among the many that we 'pseudo-intellectuals' of the 70's were reading. I enjoyed it so much, I recommended it to others, and was dumb enough to lend my copy, which I never got back.  Recently, I began to re-read Kahlil Gibran, and I get the urge to re-read this; and I was so happy to have found it.  This time, I won't be lending it out. I recommend this magnificent literary work to any who have ever had the conscious moment of 'thinking about thinking', and wondered if they were the only one.  And even if you've never had such thoughts, this novel will provide you with hours of thought provoking enjoyment. Debbie
0061134007|5.0|I really enjoyed this one.  Nesbo is a new author to me -- I picked this up a few months ago and sped through it, then ran out and bought the other two in this trilogy.  The Redbreast is my favorite.  The writing is very good and the plot is exquisite -- always interesting, never predictable.  Harry Hole, the protagonist, is lot like Ian Rankin's Inspector Rebus.  He's a loner who follows his own path and hates bureaucrats and \\"empty suits.\\"  He is an alcoholic, yet supremely competent at work, fixated on finding the bad guy no matter what.      This is the best written of the Harry Hole novels.  The three in this trilogy (The Devil's Star and Nemesis are the other titles) involve a rogue cop (Tom Waller) who heads up a pseudo-nazi clique of police officers involved in importing guns into Norway illegally.  Harry smells a rat but doesn't know what it is about Waller that makes him so unlikable.  We find out as the story arc develops through the three novels.    Nesbo excels at character development, and his talent is especially at show in The Redbreast.     Kudos to Nesbo!
B002K0WBXW|1.0|I wouldn't even give this a one star rating but I have to. Totally corny, predictable outcomes, annoying characters, totally a waste of time. If you ever appreciate this movie it goes to show how feeble your mind is. Worst choice of immigration target a Canadian! There are far worst illegal aliens than a Canadian. This is totally absurd! An immigrant officer chasing a Canadian, they could have chosen a far worse illegal alien than this. One of the worst movies of all time with Avatar.
B004G600A4|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Wasn't the best Disney flick and the songs were mostly forgettable, but I liked the characters and the story.  The banter between the leads was fun, Maximus and Pascal were adorable, and of course a happy ending helps!
B002ZG976U|3.0|I love this movie. I thought the director did an excellent job combining the show tunes with everyday life and cannot understand why the movie got poor reviews for such a feel-good musical that I equate with Victor/Victoria and Funny Girl. I wish Cher's opening number, \\"Welcome to Burlesque\\" Tango could have been included in the special features. The story lines and quotes were great and memorable. One of my favorite quotes is at Ali's audition when Sean says to Tess...\\"I couldn't take my eyes off her\\" and Tess response, \\"try harder\\". Classic. My favorite dancer was the dancer with short black hair that she could twirl just as if it was two feet long. The only part of the movie that was distracting to me was the lighting a bit too neon where it was difficult to distinguish faces and background features.

B000E97Y6A|1.0|Close to 4.30 hours long in which more than half of it were entirely useless and have no relevance to the movie specifically that bombastic CGI Lost World scene. The scenes defies logic and reality with all those acrobatic stunts of Naomi Watts by Kong even a solid unripe hard cucumber would end up mushy. It is totally incomprehensible that our heroine ended up with no bruises, no welts and unbroken bones. Another failed attempt to create a modern epic with an intended complete menu which ended up a spoiled meal.

B0052U59F4|5.0|Ana and Christian have an obvious connection, neither can deny it.  She's a wide-eyed, innocent young woman and he's a complicated, control addicted millionaire. They couldn't be more opposite, but there is one thing they have in common - they're both falling in love.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey is an amazingly captivating novel. E.L. James is a phenomenal writer, eloquent and engaging. This has to be one of the most tastefully written erotic stories I have ever read. The romantic tension between Ana and Christian is powerful, it jumps off the page!  Human vulnerability is powerful and frightening. Each of the main characters comes dangerously close to abandoning the things that they have always known about themselves, in exchange for something that will make the other happy.<br /><br />I can hardly wait to see what happens next! E.L. James I'm a new fan!
B004K4AUZW|5.0|[[ASIN:B004K4AUZW Born This Way (Special Edition)]]  This is the best album ever made ! There is nothing else I can say !
B000093OU8|5.0|\\"Wild Frontier\\" is Gary Moore's 6th studio album of the 80s, originally released in 1987. Yet another European hit, \\"Wild Frontier\\" continues in the style of its predecessor \\"Run for cover\\", mixing political/protestant hard rockers with party/glam metal tunes. In contrast to its predecessor which featured a list of session players along with two legends of rock, \\"Wild Frontier\\" relied strictly on three musicians; these are Gary on guitars and vocals, Neil Carter on keyboards and vocals and Bob Daisley on bass. Unfortunately \\"Wild Frontier\\" seems to feature drum programming instead of physical drum performance which is somewhat of a let down considering the great drummers that played on the previous releases and could have contributed on \\"Wild Frontier\\".<br /><br />Never the less, one has to agree that \\"Wild Frontiers\\" is another slice of hard rock brilliance, outcome of the enviable musical talent of Moore. \\"Thunder rising\\" is one of the most devastating hard rockers ever, the mega-emotional \\"The loner\\", the impossibly epic \\"Over the hills and far away\\", the AOR-ish \\"Strangers in the darkness\\"; and of course \\"Wild Frontier\\" which carries-dare I say- the greatest melodic guitar line ever.  From there onwards you get the heartbreaker \\"Take a little time\\", and equally enjoyable \\"Friday on my mind\\". You simply can not beat the choruses, the guitars, the harmonies and the lyricism on this album!<br /><br />\\"Wild Frontier\\" was supported by an arena tour of Europe, solidifying Moore's status amongst the most popular hard rock acts in the continent. As before Gary delivered a classic album totally indicative of his song-writing and performing abilities; A genuine `80s rocker.
B0052AC8C6|2.0|When I first saw the commercials for this movie I thought it was going to be great; the story-line looked fantastically entertaining and cute, along with the Johnny Depp bonus which made it all the more alluring. However, after seeing it in theaters I realized that the movie was still in its infancy and had not been developed enough, which made it a bit disappointing because there was a lack in the development. I don't mind so much the fact that it was definitely not geared towards young children as I do about the lack of character and story development. It seemed as though the story was just mashed together, this in part was due to the script writers not really having enough time to develop *all the characters personalities, there was just something missing as the movie ended. It only seemed to be written as to show off Johnny Depp's character, but a good writer knows that all characters are important, and therefore must be developed in order to bring the story along. Really the problem could have been solved if the movie was longer and gave more time for the characters to develop because when the film is over it makes you feel like there was something lacking but you just don't know what. I highly recommend avoiding this film for the younger children since there are mentions of some things that they shouldn't be hearing. All in all the film was good but could have been a great deal better.     PS: I do apologize for an earlier mix-up of me saying that I saw it in 3D when it didn't come out in that format, a simple mistake (it's just that everything seems to be coming out in 3D and I forgot which was which)^-^. Also after reading my review and watching the movie once more, I decided that my old review needed to be edited and changed because I realized it is not a writers fault if the story doesn't develop quite as they hoped(they just had to much to squeeze into an almost two hour movie, and it's already hard enough for an audience to remain seated for even that much time). It's all about the time and money unfortunately.
B004EPZ07U|4.0|Finally, after years of sitting on the bench as Marvel Studios churned out adaptation after adaptation for their iconic comic book characters, DC Comics is making an effort to step up to the plate. Sure, DC has had massive success with Batman and to a lesser extent Superman, but their other popular characters have been relatively absent from the silver screen. That is until now.    \\"Green Lantern\\" follows a test pilot named Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) as he inadvertently finds himself chosen to become a member of the elite, intergalactic police force known as the Green Lantern Corps. As Hal learns the ropes and begins to understand the scope of his new responsibilities, a mysterious and powerful enemy known as Parallax has set its sights upon Earth. Now, with the aid of his one-time love Carol Ferris (Blake Lively), Hal must find the courage to overcome his fears and insecurities and unleash the power of will before Parallax and his accomplice, Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard), tear our world apart.    \\"In brightest day, in blackest night; no evil shall escape my sight. Let those who worship evil's might, beware my power, Green Lantern's light!\\" Those words form the pledge by which every single member of the Green Lantern Corps live their lives. It's not a pledge the characters in this film take lightly, by any means. So, does the film adaptation do justice in bringing this character, all of his supporting cast (both alien and human), and the pledge by which they live and breathe, to cinematic life?    If you ask me to answer that question, I would say...yes, for the most part. Are there issues with the film as an adaptation or as just a movie? To an extent, yes there is, but the good and accurate portions (in relation to the comic book) far outweigh the few bits that are incorrect or need work.    Written by Greg Berlanti (TV's \\"No Ordinary Family\\") and Marc Guggenheim (TV's \\"FlashForward\\") the story for \\"Green Lantern\\" is a combination of a character-driven drama and an origin tale. Plus, the story boasts a hefty dose of science-fiction, moments of humor, and the rekindling of a romance, not bad for a character's first foray to the big screen.    In blending all of those elements together the writers did an impressive job of striking a relative balance between each of them. Thus, leaving audiences with an end result that is a thoroughly entertaining first installment in what will hopefully continue on to become another successful superhero franchise.    As I mentioned earlier, more often than not, the film works very well. The scenes set on Oa were both visually stunning and fanboy dreams come to life. I mean come on, anyone that has read a Green Lantern comic has got to admit that it was great to see so many members of the esteemed Corps up on the big screen. The action scenes were also very energetic and well choreographed and the intermixing of live-action with CGI was relatively seamless (at least 95% of the time).    As for the drama unfolding within the story, most of it was gleamed from Geoff Johns' superior retelling of Green Lantern's origin during a comic book story arc known as Secret Origin. The movie does an admirable job of conveying the inner turmoil that had consumed Hal for much of his life. Plus, the scenes shared between Hal and Carol were very nice moments that offered a quiet respite from the more sci-fi oriented aspects of the story.    Now, I will admit that there were parts of the film that didn't work as well as they should have. Chief among these issues is the handling of the film's primary villain, Parallax.    For the most part, I didn't mind the film's take on Parallax, because in the comics he's never really been given an origin tale. So, the fact that the writers, with the blessing of Geoff Johns (who served as a consultant on the film), combined the Parallax character with a fallen Guardian, although not canon, it did make sense to me.    Of course, some may cry foul at that departure from thecomics, but for me it wasn't much of an issue. The bigger problem with the character was in his appearance.    Never has Parallax appeared in the comics as a cloud-like entity (à la Galactus from \\"Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer\\"). While at various points within the film the character's face does somewhat resemble his comic book counterpart, more often than not, it looked nothing like him. However, since the goal was apparently to make the character a villain of more substance rather than merely a spirit entity, this departure while not my favorite choice, didn't ruin the movie, but it did bring it down a little bit.    Some other very minor gripes surround a few of the CGI sequences that appeared more rushed in order to get the film completed on time. And in some instances some of the scenes of Hal on Earth interacting with Carol or various other characters would occasionally feel oddly edited. As if there were bits of information either omitted from earlier in the scene or from elsewhere in the film.    Now, a major issue that some critics are citing with this film is that many of the actors and actresses in this movie are woefully miscast. If you ask me, this couldn't be further from the truth.    First off, Ryan Reynolds (\\"The Proposal\\") as Hal Jordan turned out to be a spot-on choice for the role. I'll admit that at first I was skeptical of Ryan's casting. Reason being was aside from having the proper physical appearance his typically sarcastic demeanor didn't seem to fit the character. However, aside from a few brief moments early on in the film, Ryan's trademark sarcasm was kept in check.    I think that in casting Ryan Reynolds DC and Warner Bros. made a wise decision by going with a lead actor that has star power, is young enough to build a franchise around, and has the acting chops to help the audience relate to the character and accept the more outlandish aspects of the material. Personally, I think that Ryan was a great choice in the end, and despite my misgivings early on, he ultimately wound up impressing me in the role.    Alongside Ryan as Carol Ferris, a love interest for Hal, is actress Blake Lively (\\"The Town\\"). Blake is yet another casting choice that many took issue with by saying that she never convincingly conveys the authority her character possesses and that she lacks any true acting ability.    Again, I disagree as I felt that Blake was very good as Carol. She brought strength and determination to the role. And, any perceived limitations with her character are due to the fact that her role wasn't as fleshed out as Hal's, but that's where a sequel can come in to play.    Serving as one of the film's villains (the one that is flesh and blood) is actor Peter Sarsgaard (\\"Flightplan\\") as Hector Hammond. In the comics Hector has always been very creepy and stalker-ish towards women, and as odd as this is to say, Peter really nailed this aspect of the character perfectly.    As Hector, Peter played the part in two distinct ways. The first was as a very meek and subservient individual, who was always too weak to speak out or defend himself or his ideas. Then after his chance encounter with Parallax he embraces his newfound power and lords it over everyone he can. All the while he is trying to woo Carol Ferris, albeit in the creepiest manner possible.    Now, a big gripe by many a critic, and even some comic book fans, is that the various alien members of the Green Lantern Corps show up as little more than over-glorified cameos. Honestly, this to me made sense given that this film was about Hal Jordan's journey to become a Green Lantern, and not the collective Corps at large. However, Warner Bros.' marketing department (whether instructed to or not) showcased the various other members of the Corps to such a degree that most expected to see a lot more of them in the movie.    However, what's done is done, and despite their cameo status, the various alien members of the Corps that were featured were allterrific adaptations of their comic book counterparts. Whether they were completely computer generated (for example Tomar-Re and Kilowog) or an actor with heavy amounts of make-up and prosthetics applied (Sinestro), each were convincing, living breathing versions of some of the more renowned members of the Corps come to life.    Comprising the main three members we are introduced to in the film are three very talented actors. First is Mark Strong (\\"Robin Hood\\") as Sinestro, one of the leading and most revered members of the Corps. Mark perfectly conveyed Sinestro's contempt for new recruits into the Corps. Plus, showcasing his indomitable inner strength and determination to be the best there is at what he does is Sinestro through and through.    Along with Mark Strong, are actors Geoffrey Rush (\\"The King's Speech\\") and Michael Clarke Duncan (\\"The Green Mile\\") providing the voices for Tomar-Re and Kilowog respectively. Both Geoffrey and Michael were spot-on in their vocal renditions of the characters, especially Michael whose booming bass voice perfectly complimented Kilowog's impressive stature.    Well, I suppose I've gone on about this movie long enough, and so I leave you with one last thought: despite what most of the critics have said about the film, \\"Green Lantern\\" is truly an entertaining piece of summer superhero movie fun and is easy to follow and understand even if you're not familiar with the character.    Not to mention, those aforementioned critics, most of them admit they've never read the comic book on which this film is based. Which is obvious given that much of their complaining is in regards to aspects of the film that are completely accurate to the source material. So, in that respect, I wouldn't put too much stock in their opinions of this movie.    \\"Green Lantern\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.

0817439390|1.0|Highly incoherent. I am on to page 52 or so, and I just hate how cocky the author's style is. There is too much ambiguity and invention of new terms which do not exist and confuse you more. Lots of text, just written like a disorganized story which does not connect.<br /><br />'Depth of field' is made even more nebulous with no reasonable explanation. 'Open aperture implies light scatter on sensor/film' is totally weird to me. Light scatter to me would mean, focusing is going bad. Concepts are principles should not be modified and distorted (or skipped/hidden) in an attempt to explain them to a beginner, that's just unacceptable.<br /><br />F/8 and F/11 are told to be \\"Don't care\\" apertures. You must be joking Mr. Peterson!? (please make a not whenever you crack a joke in your book)<br /><br />Some really crappy snapshot pictures along side some terrific pictures (most of which come later), makes you wonder if the author is even paying attention to the quality of photographs in a book on photography (I am not talking about quality, just terrible composition in some).<br /><br />EXCERPTS if you care to go over.....<br /><br />Understanding Exposure has critical errors, off-the-mark analogies and sometimes nonsense.<br /><br />\\"What exactly influences depth of field? Several factors come into play: the focal length of the lens, the distance between you and the subject you want to focus on, and the aperture you select. I feel strongly that of these three elements, aperture IS the most important.\\" Peterson has strong feelings -- that's nice, but they are wrong.<br /><br />\\"The depth of field in close-up photography extends one-fourth In front of and one-half beyond the focused subject, while in regular photography the depth of field is distributed one-third In front of and two-thirds beyond the subject.\\" One fourth + one half = three fourths. This is complete nonsense. In fact as you focus closer the distribution of DOF tends to even out; he's claiming the opposite, andhis statement that in regular photography the distribution of DOF is one third/two thirds is just wrong.<br /><br />\\"During the spring, the clarity of the light in the countryside results in delicate hues and tones for buds on plants and trees. This same clear light enhances the stark beauty of the autumn landscape.\\" Spring and autumn light have \\"clarity\\" that the light of summer and winter lacks?!! Mr. Peterson, your glasses might be foggy, clean them with a microfiber cloth.<br /><br />Right in the beginning!<br /><br />Also, Av, Tv, and P modes are crap right? But you are telling your readers to rely on the same equipment's metering system BUT use Manual mode. Now the 'correct exposure' that the camera shows is coming from the same metering system, which would feed data to Av and Tv modes. IF you disbelieve in technology, you would never use camera's metering system at all. It does not work better in one mode vs. the other. TL;DR The author contradicts some statements as the book progresses.<br /><br />No classic photography book tells you to take closeup shots with a wide angle lens, that's just totally bizarre to me, due to distortions, and yet Mr. Peterson recommends if you don't go that route you are missing a world of opportunities. Mind you, this has nothing to do with exposure.<br /><br />Good job making the book obscure enough (trying to make it simple?), so you SELL one on Exposure, one on Flash photography, another on Portrait photography and perhaps many more.<br /><br />It beats me how many positive reviews are there for this book, I seriously want my money back. Can anyone help me, I am out of my 30 day period, as I thought I would never have to return this. Its messing up my mindset already. :)
B002JVWR9U|5.0|It's definitely worth it to watch The Vampire Diaries on Bluray. The episodes are beautifully clear, and you really do need that extra definition to make for the best watching experience due to all the dark settings. The extras are okay--I liked the one with some behind-the-scenes footage (like about how it feels to wear those ginormous red contact lenses for the actors who have to play out blood lust) and cast interviews--but they aren't really the selling point of this product. Just get it for the episodes.    Though it starts off slow, this series is definitely interesting and is still going strong. To compare it to other popular vampire series: True Blood is for those who like campy, \\"adult\\" vampire fun, Twilight is for prepubescent teenage girls and romantics, and TVD is for those in-between. There's enough \\"activity\\" to satisfy the vampire realist, and enough romance to attract its target audience of women 18+. I do admit that sometimes you can see why it was marketed for The CW--there is hand-holding and melodramatic teenage romance and gushiness (though it is limited, I can assure you) but overall the series is pretty mature philosophically. And yeah, it's entertaining, but not from showcasing the grotesque and obscene.    And no offense to the author, but it's way better than the books.    Get it on Bluray--I assure you it's worth it.
B004SIP7VM|2.0|I really wanted to watch this movie, given the outstanding reviews.  I just could not take the relentless profanity.  I realize it's depicting a seamy environment, and I get that, but when 90% of every sentence in the bar scene is a string of filthy words, it just becomes a distraction.  No movie needs that much profanity to make its point.  Despite Affleck's other directing chops, I regard the overuse of profanity as a weakness.  I would try to watch this again if it came on on TV, where they bleep out all the distracting words, because the characters are strong and the plot is compelling.

B004ZQRJH2|4.0|Bad Meets Evil, a duo featuring Eminem and lesser know rapper Royce da 5'9,\\" presents its second (arguably its first) effort, [[ASIN:B004ZQRJFO Hell: The Sequel]].  While considered an EP, the nine track standard edition clocks in at over 40 minutes and stands alone as a proper album - if shy of Eminem's lengthy affairs as a solo artist.  Overall solid,  Hell features the best of these two creative beings, particularly raising the profile of Royce and reinvigorating Eminem's `twisted' side.<br /><br />\\"Welcome 2 Hell,\\"  features nice production work and serves as sort of an extended `intro.'  The rappers trade off verses sans a hook and the result is both beauty and foreshadowing of the greatness of Hell: The Sequel.  Eminem on this cut shows how raw he can truly be as an MC, sometimes diluted on his most modern LPs. Royce holds his own, even if he raps less here than `Marshall.'  \\"Fastlane\\" is a solid cut, featuring superb production work and finding Royce opening up the cut.  Both MCs have some great one liners throughout their respective rhymes.  Royce: \\"Leave him with his socks hard bottoms and bloomers on/and hang him by his ___ from the horn of a unicorn.\\" Eminem: \\"Now make that _____ drop like a sack of potatoes/girl I'm the crackalator/percolator of this party...\\" The chorus helps to shape the song, sung by Sly Jordan: \\"I'm living life in the fast lane, movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down/ only got a gallon in the gas tank (pedal to the metal)...\\"<br /><br />\\"The Reunion\\" is unrequited `fire' finding Eminem sampling his own \\"Bagpipes of Baghdad\\" from 2009's [[ASIN:B00192M9FC Relapse]]. Eminem, whose first verse is incredibly twisted,  goes as far as criticize his own effort.  Royce's lines are no less captivating with verse 3 possessing his most memorable rhymes: \\"...On my way to the front door takin' the scenic route to avoid this chick with a lace front lookin' like Venus's and Serena's hoofs/I'm just sayin' them chicks got horse a____ they been attractive...\\" \\"Above The Law,\\" featuring vocals from Claret Jai, is another home-run for the duo, featuring impassioned vocals from both MC's.  The chorus by Jai helps to make the cut: \\"Sometimes life seems so unfortunate/that's why I don't give a ____/ the poor stay poor, the rich get richer/its just so disproportionate/you don't know just what I go through, that's why I would rather show you/just how far that I can take it/every rule I'm breaking it...\\"  Fire, period.<br /><br />\\"I'm on Everything,\\" featuring a hilarious hook performed by Mike Epps, is superb as anything else, showing off the electric, continuous flow from both Eminem and Royce.  \\"A Kiss,\\" produced by standout Shondrae \\"Mr. Bangladesh\\" Crawford, shows now drop-off in quality.  The production is so bright, despite it's minor key - Bangladesh always has such skill in the production chair.  \\"Lighters,\\" featuring pop standout Bruno Mars is enjoyable, but slightly less exceptional than the best.  Sure, it is a great crossover hit, but the length is a bit exhaustive clocking it at over five minutes and the production grows a bit `same-y.'  The laziness of the cut is characteristic of Mars and The Smeezington's production/songwriting, but the cut does grow the slightest bit too lazy.<br /><br />Penultimate cut \\"Take From Me\\" brings Claret Jai back into the vocal booth, though the effect of the chorus here is less satisfactory than the exceptional \\"Above the Law.\\"  The low-key vibe of the track is desirable, despite the cut as a whole being second rate to the best of Hell.  \\"Loud Noises,\\" featuring Slaughterhouse is a superb way to close this overall superb effort.  The production work is creative and features a sample from ANCHORMAN - yes the movie [[ASIN:B00005JMYI Anchorman - The Legend of Ron Burgundy (Unrated Widescreen Edition)]].  Hookless, Bad Meets Evil master the art of hookless rap numbers that are just as intriguing as if they featured one.<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B004ZQRJFO Hell: TheSequel]] is a `fiery' effort (no pun intended!).  Well produced and solid throughout, this is a thoroughly enjoyable listen.  It isn't `the second coming,' but it is a solid rap effort.n intended!).

B0042RUMJG|4.0|Generally a great crisp concert but thought I had blown the tweeters in my speakers. It doesn't happen throughout the entire concert but Sting's voice distorts from time to time. No other singer or instrument. This from all 5 speakers! I'm using good equipment (Onkyo/Klipsch) and I've never had any distortion of any kind with any other album or Blu-ray concert I have ever listened to. Could be the microphone he was using though hard to believe the Germans would let something which to me seems so obvious happen.  This could be an anomaly with my equipment or brain. I'd love to hear from anyone who has had the same problem.  Sting might also want to learn the difference between a saxophone and a clarinet!
0684800713|4.0|This book is about a man, Jake Barnes and his friends, a bunch of American and English expatriates living Paris in the aftermath of the Great War.  The book begins with a Gertrude Stein quote, \\"You are a lost generation ... \\" followed an excerpt from the book of Ecclesiastes, chapter 1, which I put here:      \\"Generations come and generations go, but the earth remains forever ... The sun also rises, and the sun goes down, And hastens to the place where it arose.  The wind blows to the south and turns to the north; round and round it goes,  ever returning on its course.  All streams flow into the sea, yet the sea is never full. To the place the streams come from, there they return again.\\"      You can see where the title of the book comes from.      I think that the Stein quote, the Ecclesiastes excerpt and a little bit of a background on the existential despair that characterized Europe after WWI help us to understand the book.  All these folks, Jake and his friends are stuck in life.  They are constantly moving about and doing things, but they are all existentially stuck somewhere and cannot seem to move out.       To say it more in an Indian fashion.  These folks are stuck in a this-worldy-samsara and each is looking for one thing or another to get them out of it.*  You can see this in their daily lives as Hemingway describes it. So much of what goes on with them seems to be just a constant flitting from place to place, cafe to cafe, bar to bar, restaurant to restaurant, drink to drink, lover to lover and it never seem to end or settle anywhere. Life is a bunch of circles for them. You go here. You go there. You do this. You do that. You do this. You do that. (Is this getting dull to read?) In the end you wind up right back where you started.  What is the point of any of this? They are truly a lost generation.      And amidst all this Jake has a particular problem that affects so much of his life and which would seem to be like an anchor dropped in this dead worldmaking his escape from samsara futile. So what will happen? Will he ever escape? And what of his compatriots? What will get them out of where they are?      *In Hinduism, there is this concept called samsara.  It refers to the unending cycle of rebirth and death that we are all trapped in.  Likewise I say, even within our own life, there is a sort of a this-worldly samsara, in which we get stuck in, that is characterized by unending routines, cycles and monotony.  Its the same thing over and over again. \\"Meaningless! Meaningless!\\" cries the Teacher, \\"Everything is meaningless!\\" ~Eccles. 1.

B00338QENI|5.0|What an eye-opener to a woman who has lived a long life - I'm 80!  In the past several years I've often remarked on how \\"lucky we are to live in times when medicine has come so far\\".  Little did I know, until this book, that the living cells from one black woman are the reason.  Yes, it's horrible that no permission was given to remove those cells - but the injustices have always been awful.     This book was well-written and I feel that the instances where the author was close with Henrietta's family were a necessary part of the story.  It shows how obsessed the children were with the memory of their mother - and the anger regarding their mistreatment.  Ms. Skloot was really open with her writing, I was often reminded of that.  Only in one instance did she agree to \\"not write that word\\" - it almost felt like she truly followed her taping otherwise.      As the previous reviewers have noted so much I'll not go into the story, but I highly recommend it for anyone - in the medical field or not.
B000001GPX|5.0|Carlos Kleiber's recording of the Beethoven Symphonies nos. 5 & 7, with the Vienna Philharmonic is one of the greatest recordings I've been privileged to hear.<br /><br />The Gramophone Good Guide rates this as one of its greatest 100 recordings, and it surely ranks as that. I had been<br />reluctant to purchase this CD simply because I've heard these two Beethoven Symphonies so much over the years, yet<br />listening to these performances was like never having heard these standard pieces before.<br /><br />Whether you are new to Beethoven or these symphonies, or you are so familiar with this music that you are reluctant<br />to listen to them  again, this CD is essential for all collections,

B004EBT5CU|5.0|I keep a variety of lists.  I'm such a critic and that's what we do.  I can recommend the best foods to eat, cars to drive and clothes to wear.  I also have a \\"Best Albums\\" list.  As you can imagine, this is a very short list because while there are many great songs, and find artists, there aren't very many \\"best albums.\\" Then, along comes Adele to save the day.  I feel her music so much and her voice is so melodic and so amazing.  This is an album that you buy, insert into your cd/mp3 player and let it play because you're not going to need to skip over any of the songs since each track is ALL THAT.  I'm not heartbroken nor am I struggling to get over a past love, but there's still so much identity in her music.  Call it the human experience, call it an expression of love, call it feelings from one soul to another, or simple call it good music!  We have certainly been blessed by the presence of Adele. She oozes with talent & creativity and her album is a class act.  She gives so much of herself in each song and when she sings, you get a sense that you're listening to someone who was born to share her voice with us. Thank you Adele, we are indeed all ears.
B000000OU0|5.0|The last thing that Don Henley said after the Eagles broke up after being asked \\"When will you all get back together? He said, \\"When hell freezes over!\\" I guess hell must have frozen over. This album picks up right where they left off years ago. The only difference is that the band has gained much more experience and know how. You can actually hear it on the quality of the music and the quality of the recording. Even though they are much more laid back, they are definitely crisper and cleaner on this album more than any other. All of the songs sound better than their original recordings and the four new songs fit the bill just fine. Very few times in my life have I found an album that I liked eighty percent of the songs let alone every single one. This album definitely depicts the Eagles at their best. This is a great buy!

B0004Z33F0|1.0|Ok, I hate this movie with a passion! A black passion at that. I hate the mere thought of its existence. And, it's not for reasons that many others may hate it, like bad plot (boy does it excel there!), bad acting (awards could be thrown like crazy at it for that one!), or the abysmally bad over-the-top machismo of it all (oh, yeah, Rambo a MAN, all MAN, and he no girly-man, get it!). Yeah! Right! What crap!<br /><br />Of all the reasons to hate this film, and there are MANY, but I won't list them all here; just the one that has always bothered me the most, is the title. The first movie was called \\"First Blood\\", then the sequel \\"Rambo: First Blood Part 2\\", so how did the people who made this garbage EVER get away with the title \\"Rambo III\\"???!! There never was a movie called \\"Rambo\\" except for the subtitle of the sequel, so to me that would be as lame as calling the third sequel to \\"The Omen\\" (there were three films in that series: \\"The Omen\\", \\"Damien: Omen II\\", and \\"Omen III: The Final Conflict\\") \\"Damien 3\\".<br /><br />There never should have been a third film with the Rambo character, but if Hollwood really felt it necessary, then it should have been called by its rightful title: \\"First Blood Part III\\", NOT \\"Rambo III\\"! That is a tremendous insult to moviegoers everywhere, highly displaying the dumbing down of our nation, making it extremely blatant that intelligence can take a back seat where this is concerned.<br /><br />And, the scary thing is, well, look at all the \\"good\\" reviews on here. THAT'S scary!!! Why? You may ask. Well, in case I wasn't clear about what I was saying about the mistake in the title, let me remind you that there never was a \\"Rambo\\", or a \\"Rambo II\\". It was \\"First Blood\\" (which was an extremely good film, by the way), then the ill-conceived sequel, \\"Rambo: First Blood Part 2\\".<br /><br />This is an abysmally bad film, no matter what the title was. But, if the title had been \\"First Blood Part III\\", then I feel like I could at least insult it on a more intellectual level instead of feeling like I am reviewing something a bunch of elementary school aged kids made. Almost. To give this piece of crap one star is too generous. Save some brain cells and skip this one! :>)instead of feeling like I am reviewing something a bunch of elementary school aged kids made.

B001UV4XHY|1.0|I found this movie dreary, interminable, and boring.  Around 1/4 way through, I ceased caring about Harry Potter and the whole confusing mess and stuck it out for another 1/3 until I gave up and went to bed.  I fast-forwarded through the rest of it this afternoon while my wife secluded herself so she could watch it later.  I felt the same way about the books as the series progressed, so it's not surprising.  It's also got the darkest (literally) cinematography and lighting I've ever seen on film.  I can't recommend this movie for anyone except the most devout fans, who've no doubt already seen it and will love it no matter what I say.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|They will always make epics but they never again will make epics like they did in the 1930s and 1940s and especially Swashbuckling Epics like The Adventures of Robin Hood.  This 1938 classic epic release by Warner Brothers, staring Errol Flynn as Robin Hood and Olivia De Havilland as Maid Marian as well as Basil Rathborne as  the evil and villainous Guy de Gisborne  and Claude Raines  as Prince John  is what definitely is  an influence on the creation of all the Pirates of the Caribbean Movies as well as all the Star Wars films when dealing with Sward Fighting.   This Movie is a Fairy Tale epic with Robin Hood as the hero and Maid Marian as the girl in the tale that is smitten by the hero and who ends up with him. There is comedy when Robin and Little John as well as the Merry Men lour Friar Tuck into their group, and also when the bungling fool of the Sheriff of Nottingham is in any scene as well as in any scene where Robin's man Much is with his love interest Nurse Bess.   Sadly there is also tragedy in this Film. with pain being seen in the tortured faces and broken bodies of the Saxon people of the England of Robin Hood's time supposedly set in this tale. The cruel and evil Gisborne and the backstabbing and devilish John Lackland {as he is called in the Movie although later on in the real John the First of England's life he was called that way by his enemies} are the none comic villains in the Movie that would give anyone nightmares.   Later in history John is forced by the Nobles to accept the Magna Charta at the Field of Runnymede, but at the time that this tale is set those later on Nobles united against King John were at each other's throats. Richard Coeur de Lion {Lionheart} was the only one that in the tale is who would have all Nobles and all English united, as he was the King in the tale but he is held hostage in Austria; and that gives John the opportunity for him to take Richard's throne. Richard the Lionheart was a King who was a Warrior as well as aCrusader, with him being so absent in his reign that it was no wonder that such injustice was placed on the people in the tale, who were tortured and maimed and who lost everything because of the pact of evil, in between John and his supporters of Gisborne and the Sheriff of Nottingham.    In this Film Richard returns to England as it is told in so many Fairy Tales of him in total disguise as a Monk and Richard states to a mysterious Monk that he is mad at Richard abandoning his people, with him and all Merry Men seeing that this Monk was Richard and Richard befriending the Merry Men and their leader as loyalists to him despite Robin's long anger at Richard's not staying home.   This makes the tale a story where so many issues are mentioned when at the same time the art of fencing is so present as the action and especially when it is in the form of a Ballet. The Music is just as amazing as the Movie itself with Erich Wolfgang Korngold being such a maestro.
B004QPOVF0|3.0|If you've read the other reviews, you've read that they keep switching from camera to camera. In my opinion that's because this is not really music captured while the video was; it is video edited to follow previously recorded sessions. Otherwise you would hear the thousands of people screaming during the concert. I prefer \\"really live.\\" I enjoy watching it as it was played.     Malcolm gets much more camera time this time. I prefer the drummer from Donnington better than this guy; I really don't want to watch someone play drums with a cigarette hanging of his mouth. Not very professional in my opinion. Overall, the music is great as AC/DC always is; but not really a Live Concert in my humble opinion.

B001HN691I|3.0|Even though I think the first Cars is one of the weakest Pixar films, at least it has some really funny moments and a story with more in mind than just blowing stuff up. I don't think we laughed more than a few times with Cars 2. The plot is too complex for younger kids and there is more action than you can or will want to handle. It feels more like a Dreamworks movie than one made by the great Pixar. It's not all bad though. The spy element played like a decent a Bond flick and the animation is of high quality as expected. You know it can't be good when the 5 minute Toy Story short shown before Cars 2 is actually better than movie you paid to see.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm very picky with what I read for fun--it can't be too sappy or slow, it has to run at a good pace, it has draw me in far enough to keep my attention, etc. It's for this reason that it normally takes me almost an hour to pick out just one book at a bookstore. It's just that bad.    At first I was quite hesitant to read this, but since a free sample was available for download I thought to myself, \\"Hey, what the heck.\\" If it didn't work out, then whatever.    Boy, am I glad I did try it. I literally could not stop reading it! I was hooked by the first page. The characters are flawed and relatable, the plot intricate enough to keep me interested throughout, and the sense of a delicate balance between life and death is just irresistible. I loved it and finished it in a day! For anyone having any reservations about reading this, I strongly urge you to give this gem a try.
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|It would be a complete understatement to say that this is a GOOD album. This album is like a mix of the ('95-'99 Foos) and the ('00-'09 Foos). What I mean by that is that the songs on this record are reminiscent of the early days of the Foos, for example, White Limo reminds me of Enough Space, gritty, hard, and a song that just makes you want to head bang and rock. I'd compare Bridge Burning to Monkey Wrench because of the flowing up-tempo, never slows down, packing a sick riff awesomeness both songs share.      But I don't hear the back to basics Dave promised when originally talking about this album. It sounds very produced to me, unlike the Self Title album and The Colour and The Shape... That's what I'm referring to when I say the ('00-'09 Foos). Don't rule it out though, It still is the hardest rocking album since There is Nothing Left to Lose. It's not as repetitive as In Your Honor was, and it just feels more complete than ESP&G.     Don't Miss: Bridge Burning, Rope, White Limo, Alandria or Walk.  The other songs are GOOD, just not GREAT like these. At least not in my opinion.     I had high hopes for the Foos and they didn't disappoint. If you like the Foo Fighters at all, pick up this album and listen to it a few times through. Can't wait to see whats next from Dave and the boys.
0439023483|5.0|I understand why some people may not find this book anything but disturbing.  I couldn't disagree more.  Accusations of \\"ripoffs\\" aside, I think this book is spectacular.<br /><br />The emotional rollercoaster you feel while you embark on this journey with Katniss Everdeen is undeniable.  I feel the triumphs and sorrows accurately depict the many feelings of war.  One step forward, two steps back.<br /><br />The entire trilogy is a reminder that power corrupts, war creates death, and that one person can influence the world.  Yes, parts of this book are disturbing, but not too much to handle.  The intricate storytelling keeps the reader on the edge of their seat through the entire series.  I finished all three books in two days, unable to put down my kindle.<br /><br />Even the supporting characters have deep stories behind them, and every character has a poignant role to play.  The different \\"districts\\" and the \\"capitol\\" that the author has dreamed up are thorough, colorful, and they come to life in your mind in full detail as you read.  The details are imaginative and genius.<br />There are no loose ends left hanging as the series wraps up, and I haven't been this pleased with a series in a very long time.<br /><br />What a thrilling, horrifying, yet beautiful concept.  Kudos to the author.  I would love to see this made into a movie series.  I will be picking up her other works!
0307716511|3.0|Roughly the first half of the book is a good read, but it becomes progressively more tedious because the early promise of insights and interesting characters fails to deepen and progress satisfactorily.  The book does not achieve its initial promise and so does not transcend its genre as detective fiction. There is some mildly preachy but useful information on cystic fibrosis.  If a book makes the reader suffer, that suffering must serve some greater purpose or provide some worthwhile insight.  Consider Toni Morrison's \\"Beloved,\\" a complex, tortuous explication of the corrosive effects of slavery on the human spirit.  This book was ultimately creepy and depressing to no particular purpose.   The twist at the end of a murder mystery should leave the reader admiring the wit and ingenuity of the author.  Here, the reader was left feeling betrayed rather than fairly treated.  The resolution here lacked any depth that might have justified the ultimate deception of the reader.  It is an imitation of profundity rather than the real thing.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|I ordered it from Amazon.co.uk because I couldn't wait for it to be released in the US, and, having not seen it in the theaters, was eager to watch it (computers can play NTSC and PAL with no issues). Now before I go any further, no this isn't something that will make it into the preservation archives, nor does it have a deep intricate plot, but it will make you laugh, which is what a comedy is supposed to do. Is this an anti-religion movie? No, but it uses an exaggerated religious stereotype as a comedic point. It's also true what they say, this isn't for kids, swearing and crude sexual jokes are throughout. It's a must-have DVD to add to your collection if you also like movies such as Hot Fuzz and The Hangover, and if it does not make you laugh, you need to go get your head examined. This isn't a movie you break apart and examine from different angles like you do Star Wars (no, it's not just a movie), it's just a simple, straightforward \\"dumb comedy\\" with a bit of romance thrown in for good measure.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|This is a game I have spent over an hour on it. So it must be a good game. But it is only a ordinary game as many other games I have played.

A good game, but not deserve this much attention.
B003UESJEM|4.0|This is a sobering look at the economy as it is today, though the movie was put together in 2008 and not released to the public until a year later.     GTX is in the midst of a massive layoff session and Bobby Walker (Ben Affleck) is one of the 1st to be dismissed. Disillusioned, he tells his supportive wife Maggie (Rosemarie DeWitt) the bad news and she goes back to work. Meanwhile, the CEO James Salinger (Craig T. Nelson) keeps his high salary and plans to buy a new building, much to the voiced objections of his partner Gene McLary (Tommy Lee Jones). Walker tries acting as if he's still living the good life, playing golf with his buddies and is offered a drywalling job by his brother in law (Kevin Costner) which at 1st he turns down. Few people who've reviewed this have mentioned the character of Danny, a friendly black (I did not say African American as the actor, Eamonn Walker, is English) whom Bobby meets at the job placement center. Walker does a great job as Danny and at the job placement office exhorts Bobby to \\"do the tiger.\\" Meanwhile, Sally Wilcox (HR director, bearer of bad news and mistress to McLary) has some more names to add to the list... those of co-founder McLary who has enough money to currently survive and Phil Woodward (Chris Cooper), who's put in several years into the company and due to his age, has a harder time starting anew (\\"I suggest you dye your hair\\").     John Wells has done a great job with this movie. The language is strong and the character of Bobby Walker comes across as arrogant but likable. Wells does a good job explaining the story and how everything was put together in the commentary (he had a relative of his lose his job). Other extras include deleted scenes, an alternative ending and a special Making The Company Men (pretty generous, considering how many DVD's nowadays leave most of the extra's on Blue-Ray's, as if anyone could afford them). All in all, recommended to those of you either struggling to keep a job in danger orhave been laid off.
B0031ESW8O|4.0|Excellent read and very well written.

When someone gets 13 brains, the other players get one final turn to try and tie or beat the leading player.    There is some strategy involved. Red dice have more bombs and green dice have more brains. You ramdomly select three dice to roll on each turn. The one game I played, I needed eight brains to tie, nine brains to win. I ended up getting nine brains. So I'm living proof that it's possible to come from behind and win in this game.

030745455X|4.0|Often an author's first book introduces us t the characters, and subsequent books introduce us to more intrigue and mystery - this book actually introduces us to the protagonist in the initial half, and then delivers us to intrigue which tells us more about the protagonist, just when we thought we knew her.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander, in this novel, gets to start off with money - lots of money.  SO much money, that she will never have to worry about it again, and more.  And, from this resplendent receipt comes an opportunity which most would dream to have: travel, travel and more travel.  And, she does, and occasionally buys real clothes, reads complicated mathematical books to keep her mind in tune, gets a boob job, and let us not forget why she is in these book - she commits internet felonies by reading into the computers of her friends, most particularly Mikael Blomkvist.<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist, while she enjoys these good things, seems to again stumble upon murder, mayhem, and Swedish mafia (is there really such a thing?). And, by the time we finish, we learn the mafia - or at least this mafia -  really is German or Russian, which resides in Sweden. Phew. The poor girls they abuse are also foreign.  The perverts, like the first book, are full blooded Swedes.<br /><br />And, perverts abound. Like in book one.  Good people. Society's best.  The ones who would never do such a thing.  And, when they are about to be revealed by a good journalist and his Ph.D. spouse, they and the journalist and wife are the victims.  After all, this is about mafia.<br /><br />And, because this is a sequel, Mikael Blomkvist must prevail.  Of course, Lisbeth is not as cooperative as she was in the first book.  While all of Sweden is hot after her trail in order to arrest her for several murders, she decides to play cat and mouse with Mikael Blomkvist even though she apparently knows who is doing the bad things to the good people - a problem I have with this book.<br /><br />But, the book takes you for a roller-coaster-like ride.  And, that is why these books sell.  They are a gas to read. Good prevails in the end, with some occasional good people killed by the unfriendly's fire. Lisbeth, the most sociologically misfitted looker on the streets of Sweden, is a kitten compared to the lecherous lawyers and government officials. And, that is amazing when we discover who her father was, what he did to her in her childhood, and what the bureaucrats did to her -  because of her father's political clout - for a few years in her late teens. Lisbeth is the poster child for abuse by parents, men and society - yet she is bisexual, not homosexual.<br /><br />After reading this book, like after reading the first book, you have to read the third. And, then the posthumous fourth.like ride.  And, that is why these books sell.  They are a gas to read. Good prevails in the end, with some occasional good people killed by the unfriendly's fire.

038533348X|1.0|You either like Vonnegut or not.  This is my second novel of his that I've read, and again, he comes across as misanthropic, plotless, and pseudo-philosophical.  His characters are wooden and unlikeable. His chapters are usually one page long.  His prose and dialogue are generally quite bad.  He is not a comedian.  If this is the published novel, one wonders what the first draft or brainstorm was like.    What drug was Vonnegut doing, when the Cold War made him think up \\"ice-nine?\\"      If Vonnegut wrote to get some message across, why didn't he write an essay or a short story?  If he wrote a novel so that he could flesh out characters or tell some compelling story, then this is a utter failure.    If you want funny, read P.G. Wodehouse.  If you want an anti-nuclear message, there are at least a dozen better short stories or novels by other authors.  Some of them are near-masterpieces like Bradbury's \\"There Will Come Soft Rains\\", Clarke's \\"The Curse\\", and Miller's \\"A Canticle for Liebowitz.\\"  If atheism is what floats your boat, read some atheistic philosopher because Vonnegut can't even go toe to toe with Elijah and the bears.

1439107955|5.0|As a lay person wanting to get informed on the history, the victims, the research and researchers, the politics, the science, and the oncology behind this truly remarkable disease, I could not have picked a better book. Quite an amazing feat of presenting information in such a lucid and well-organized manner. What enhances the appeal of the book is the style of writing. It manages to achieve the fine balance between keeping it accessible for the lay reader and providing sufficient detail. This means that you can keep returning to the book for details that you may otherwise gloss over in your first reading.<br /><br />This is literally a biography of cancer. It is also a commentary on the treatments pursued over the millennia, and of the people who have spent their lives in pursuing a treatment, a cure of the disease. It is also an account of the people, outside the medical profession, who battled against cancer, by raising public awareness and leading campaigns to channel government funding into the research of the disease, to encouraging speedier trials of drugs and treatments that could then be rolled out to wider swathe of patients. This book also looks at the causes of cancer, from its genetic origins, to the factors that precipitate and increase the chances of cancer erupting in a human's body - carcinogens, among whom tobacco is perhaps the most famous of all.<br /><br />Cancer is perhaps the oldest disease to have killed man. A jawbone, dating back to 4000 BC, has signs of a \\"particular type of lymphoma\\", a cancer in the lymphatic cells. Six thousand years ago. Imhotep, the Egyptian physician, who lived in the 27th century BC,who made notes on diseases he encountered in patients, fell \\"atypically silent\\" with case number forty-five.<br /><br />     But with case forty-five, Imhotep fell atypically silent. Under the section titled \\"Therapy,\\" he offered only a single sentence: \\"There is none.\\"...<br /><br />As you read the book, you learn that people have written about this affliction for the longest time. The ancient Greek physician, Claudius Galen, writing almost two thousand years ago, was more right about the nature of cancer than was realized through most of the twentieth century as science made progress into the roots of cancer. The theory of \\"black bile\\" may not be very scientific sounding, but as the book progresses the author makes it clear that the nature of cancer is not dissimilar to this theory of black bile - it was not enough to simply remove the afflicted part of the body to rid it of cancer. Cancer had a way of flowing from the diseased portion to other parts of the body, much like the bile that Galen had described.<br />  <br />  \\"The human body, Hippocrates proposed, was composed of four cardinal fluids called humors: blood, black bile, yellow bile, and phlegm.\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\"Galen proposed that cancer was \\"trapped\\" black bile--static bile unable to escape from a site and thus congealed into a matted mass.\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\"The problem with treating cancer surgically, Galen suggested, was that black bile was everywhere, as inevitable and pervasive as any fluid. You could cut cancer out, but the bile would flow right back, like sap seeping through the limbs of a tree.\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\"The surgical removal of tumors--a local solution to a systemic problem--was thus perceived as a fool's operation.\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\"But he had uncannily captured something essential about cancer in his dreamy and visceral metaphor. Cancer was often a humoral disease. Crablike and constantly mobile, it could burrow through invisible channels from one organ to another. It was a \\"systemic\\" illness, just as Galen had once made it out to be.\\"<br />  ...<br /><br />By so describing cancer, and making it out into an incurable disease, for which no procedure or operation was likely to have any effect, Galen did a huge favor to the victims of cancer that were to follow in the coming centuries.<br /><br />  <br />  \\"Unwittingly, Galen may actually have done the future victims of cancer a favor--at least a temporary one. In the absence of anesthesia and antibiotics, most surgical operations performed in the dank chamber of a medieval clinic--or more typically in the back room of a barbershop with a rusty knife and leather straps for restraints--were disastrous, life-threatening affairs.\\"<br /><br />By the time we near the beginning of the twentieth century, the theory that cancer was actually a disease marked, more by anything else, by uncontrolled cell division, had started to take shape. As the century progressed, vaccinations, sterilization of surgical tools, and improved sanitation conditions meant that deaths because of other diseases declined, and cancer began to emerge as a killer in its own right, jostling to claim top spot as the world's foremost killer.<br /><br />  <br />  \\"Between 1900 and 1916, cancer-related mortality grew by 29.8 percent, edging out tuberculosis as a cause of death. By 1926, cancer had become the nation's second most common killer, just behind heart disease.\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\"By the early twentieth century, many locally restricted cancers (i.e., primary tumors without metastatic lesions) could be removed by surgery. These included uterine and ovarian cancer, breast and prostate cancer, colon cancer, and lung cancer. If these tumors were removed before they had invaded other organs, these operations produced cures in a significant fraction of patients.\\"<br /><br />When science stumbled on chemotherapy as a cure for cancer, and even though it took oncology several years to realize that chemotherapy offered a fairly relapse-free cure for cancer, cancer chose to dig deep to survive, away from the treatment. Deep inside the human body itself.<br /><br />  <br />  \\"Not until several years later did it strike the board that had fired Li so hastily that the patients he had treated with the prolonged maintenance strategy would never relapse. This strategy--which cost Min Chiu Li his job--resulted in the first chemotherapeutic cure of cancer in adults.\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\"The brain and spinal cord are insulated by a tight cellular seal called the blood-brain barrier that prevents foreign chemicals from easily getting into the brain\\"<br />  ....<br />  \\"The next regimen they would try would be a combination of all four drugs: vincristine, amethopterin, mercaptopurine, and prednisone. The regimen would be known by a new acronym, with each letter standing for one of the drugs: VAMP.\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\"But the same system had likely also kept VAMP out of the nervous system, creating a natural \\"sanctuary\\" for cancer within the body. The leukemia, sensing an opportunity in that sanctuary, had furtively climbed in, colonizing the one place that is fundamentally unreachable by chemotherapy [bold emphasis mine]. The children died one after the other--felled by virtue of the adaptation designed to protect them.\\"<br /><br />Chemotherapy was only one way of treating cancer. Cancer is incredibly varied. The treatment of cancer demanded a similar amount of flexibility, a realization that came only with the passage of time.<br /><br />  <br />  \\"Cancers possessed temperaments, personalities--behaviors. And biological heterogeneity demanded therapeutic heterogeneity; the same treatment could not indiscriminately be applied to all. But even if Kaplan understood it fully in 1963 and made an example of it in treating Hodgkin's disease, it would take decades for a generation of oncologists to come to the same realization.\\"<br />  ...<br />  \\"As DeVita charged ahead with combination chemotherapy, more complex and novel devastations were revealed. Chemotherapy caused permanent sterility in men and some women. The annihilation of the immune system by the cytotoxic drugs allowed peculiar infections to sprout up:\\"<br /><br />Tobacco has long been linked to cancer, even though the tobacco industry spent huge sums of money over decades and decades in denying any such links. Apart from outright denial of any causal link between smoking and cancer, suppressing and discrediting research that established such links, the tobacco industry has had access to a vast arsenal of weapons of mass obfuscation. The author is rightly indignant when he outlines just some of these vile tactics employed by the tobacco industry.<br /><br />  <br />  \\"...By the early 1950s, though, cigarette ads, and cigarette brands, were being \\"designed\\" for segmented groups: urban workers, housewives, women, immigrants, African-Americans--and, to preemptively bell the medical cat--doctors themselves.\\"<br /><br />In 1964, the FTC proposed stamping a warning message on all cigarette packages that struck a cold stab of fear through the tobacco industry.<br />This was the warning label proposed by the FTC:<br /><br />  \\"Caution: Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to Health.

Because tobacco was the economic lifeline of several Southern states, \\"Congress, it was well-known, would inherently be more sympathetic to the interests of tobacco makers.\\" because \\"the industry had bribed politicians and funded campaigns so extensively...\\"<br /><br />As a result, the the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (FCLAA) of 196 changed \\"the FTC's warning label to Caution: Cigarette smoking may be hazardous to your health.\\"<br /><br />  \\"The dire, potent language of the original label--most notably the words cancer, cause, and death--was expunged.

0316069353|5.0|I wasn't a reading person before and was introduced to John Grisham's novel  accidently. Since then I am reading his and started reading & liking legal thrillers.I was watching a trailer for 'The Lincoln Lawyer' and so bought the book to read before the movie released and from then became fan of Michael Connelly.    Have read previous Mickey Haller series and loved 'em, so couldn't wait   to put my hands on 'The Fifth Witness'. Finished it last night after having  late nights and early morning readings, this is an absolute treat from  beginning to end, hard to keep down. Keeps you guessing and usually Connelly's book would reveal the killer in last 20 pages but this was not like that ( I am not  telling when you would know:-))    Looking forward to see what Mickey Haller would do next on the other side of  the law. I would like him on any side regardless.
0767903862|4.0|Bill Bryson does a great job of writing entertaining travelogues. Here he finds boundless material for his wry sense of humor in the larger-than-life Australian landscape. Instead of dry history and descriptions, he weaves interesting facts with the fascinating characters he meets on his travels. He clearly adores Australia for its beauty, uniqueness and friendly people, and by the end I wanted to hop a plane and visit on my own.     My only criticism was his discussion of Aborigines. While he gives a general background of the harsh and unfair treatment these people have endured, he doesn't seem to give a full and fair account of their current situation. That section seems to just be a little harsh and judgmental without fully investigating all sides of the issue. I could be wrong, but if my memory is correct I don't recall him even visiting or talking with any Aborigines themselves, just white Australians talking about Aborigines. Oh well, just a minor quibble with an otherwise thoroughly entertaining book.

0756404738|2.0|I compliment the author by saying I believe only 40% of this book should be amputated (many out-of-control fantasy authors would fare worse at my hands).  PR is exceptionally imaginative, deals far better prose than most genre writers, and delivers a story that is fresh while still incorporating satisfying elements of fantasy tradition.      But he is also overly taken with his hero.  This volume reads less like a carefully composed, plot-driven novel, and more like an elaborate daydream of _being_ Kvothe.  You know when you're fantasizing about an event, and spend ages detailing the minutiae?  That's what this book reeked of to me.  Much of the time, lectures on magic/ethics/spirituality supplant exciting events, and a lovable supporting cast disappears, leaving us largely alone with a protagonist of increasingly hyperbolic perfection.    I napped between pages 600 and 850, experiencing a terrible nightmare in which I was reading a self-help tract that brought together elements of the Kama Sutra, exoticist quasi-ninjas, survivalists, morning in a Chinese park, and Ikea catalogues - all in one mystical over-explained bundle.       Given this devolution into formless rambling, I recommend the prophylactic measure of checking it out from the library first.  I will not buy - and may not finish - the next installment.  Please, Mr. Rothfuss, do not go the way of authors (*ahem* Goodkind *cough* Williams) before you, leaving my bookshelves with only the orphaned first half of a series!
B000FCKBCU|4.0|I find that I like this one the most of Kinsella books.  Maybe it is the reader, which sometimes makes a huge difference.  The more books on tape I read the more I realize the importance of the voice. This is my comfort book, when I am ill or seriously stressed  out, I listen to the  Undomestic Goddess  and I can go to sleep, calm down although it may be totally unrealistic a story.  That's what comfort books are for.  Sorry Amazon does not have it on voice for my Kindle.  Do I have to go and by a Barnes and Noble instead??????
0307716511|4.0|This was an interesting psychological thriller. I had not read any other books from this author before, and this was a pleasant surprise.  I think this book could have been even better if the author had rewritten some parts of the book. However, it was entertaining to read.<br /><br />About the plot: A sister's unexpected death causes the main character Beatrice  to start  wondering if it really was a suicide or something else.  What makes this novel an entertaining reading was the way the author tells the story: It is told  from Beatrice's  perspective but in the form of an open letter to Tess.<br /><br />If you like psychological thrillers, then this is a good summer read for you.
B004XE0P5E|5.0|Well damn, this is a changeup. Vernon has taken a huge (and very ballsy) step in releasing this record under the same name as 2008's brilliant For Emma, Forever Ago, which is more or less the polar opposite of this year's self-titled record. Where For Emma was a hushed set of crystalline dirges, Bon Iver is absolutely exploding with sounds and instrumentation and ideas. For Emma was the sound of a man and his guitar, pouring out his heart and purging the demons that haunt him, but Bon Iver is the logical follow-up: the purge was successful and now Vernon has a fresh heart and soul to express more than just the idea of pain and hurt. I get why For Emma fans are not necessarily huge fans of this record, but just as Burst Apart was the logical step forward from Hospice, so too is Bon Iver the progression from the cocoon of For Emma. You absolutely have to come into this record with an open mind and not expect for it to sound like For Emma, but if you can do that, you'll find Vernon's aggressive use of instrumentation and melody to be compelling and, ultimately, stellar. On Bon Iver, Vernon has shown us that he can do far more than make us cry, and he does it all so well it's almost hard to believe.
0765350386|4.0|I read Robert Jordan's series and ended up here.  Most of the Robert Jordan series I felt like I had been duped.  Then the last couple books came along with the promise that it would finally end so I continued.  Brandon Sanderson was the author who agreed to try and wrap up this monumental task.  I think he did a fine job with a tough challenge.  It was good enough that I wanted to see how he would do with his own ideas and in his own world.  Mistborn did not disappoint.  I would say it is not the best I have ever read but is well above average and I would recommend it to fiction readers.  I think many will think that this is a much better read than I do but I would be surprised if many didn't like Mistborn.  I look forward to reading more of his books in the future.
0425242099|5.0|Kiss of Snow by Nalini Singh is more than I could have hoped for. The tension that has been building between Sienna and Hawke in the previous books comes to a glorious consummation and the other story arcs are galvanizing to the overall plot.<br /><br />Hawke has always thought that his childhood friend who died was his mate which led him down a desolate path in his personal life when it comes to accepting a permanent, meaningful relationship. However, since Sienna entered his pack, Hawke has felt a passionate connection with Sienna that tugs at his loins and heart.<br /><br />Their relationship has been contentious from the beginning because they both have been fighting an attraction they are not prepared for. He has been resisting her allure for years since she came into his pack at a very young age. In addition to their age difference, he feels he cannot offer her a relationship she deserves if he were to get involved with her.<br /><br />In this story, Sienna is all grown-up and is tired of hiding her feelings for Hawke. She has always cared for Hawke but has been fearful of letting him know how she feels. She wages a campaign to gain his attention, affection and heart. By doing this, Sienna ignites feelings in Hawke he never thought he would feel for another woman.<br /><br />As the reader deals with the relationship between Hawke and Sienna, the Psy are ramping up their efforts to wage war against the Changelings. The situation becomes very tenuous as the Changeling packs in the area try to remain a step ahead of their unknown enemy.  To add to the drama unfolding, Sienna is also dealing with her X Psy powers that are growing exponentially. X Psy are very rare and deadly in the close knit Psy Community. So rare, there is no documentation to refer on how to handle the powers. What is known is that most X Psy die a young age from their powers burning out, literally, and they are lethal as fighters.<br /><br />Sienna's family tries to obtain a long lost document written by a human researcher to unearth any help they can get to aid Sienna in controlling her X abilities better. Meanwhile, they and the pack have to deal with the problems Sienna's powers as they come. Sienna attempts to keep the powers controlled on her own since she does not hurt the people she loves or, for that matter, give away the fact that she is still alive. The Psy community believe she and her family are deceased.<br /><br />To add to the mix, Walt and Laura's romance is a backstory to the novel. I am telling you this novel was worth the wait. It is full of drama and romance. I highly recommend this book. Nalini Singh weaves a awesome tale that will leave you panting for more. The next book is highly anticipated on my part. Before I conclude, I want to make one more recommendation to you if you have not read any books in this series. You need to start with A Slave to Sensation, the first book in the Psy/Changeling series. The emotional investment you gain will make reading this book all the more significant.<br /><br />Happy Reading from Bona Fide Reflections!!any help they can get to aid Sienna in controlling her X abilities better.

159102594X|5.0|This is an excellent read.  The author stays with scenes well, where most writers aren't able or willing to.  Very good character development.  And, strangely enough, I agree with one reviewer who said he would read the books just for the fight scenes.  Highly recommend.
B000XR4OC0|4.0|I've always been eyeing TOMS but I never had the chance to really look into them. However, I got them as a gift in the ash color, and they were the perfect fit. I needed some sole support which it comes with, they fit true to size, and were easy to walk around in without having to break them in. They're casual yet athletic and are perfect for just about any informal situation. I've gotten tons of compliments on mine, and I can't wait to buy another pair! The only downside is that I wore mine so often that in 4 months, I had ripped a hole in them :( but otherwise, I love them and their two fold benefits. :)
B00164EAC8|3.0|The 1080p Video:<br /><br />'Godzilla's 1080p MPEG-4 AVC transfer, in its original 2.39: 1 aspect ratio, is actually fairly solid. This isn't the knock-it-out-of-the-park home video presentation some might be expecting, but it's a perfectly fine transfer in its own right. (Especially of a movie I have no intention of ever, ever, EVER watching again.)<br /><br />The movie is drenched in persistent rain, which adds a blurry, oppressive look to the entire film. While there is a fair amount of grain on the transfer (more than you'd expect for a relatively recent film), sometimes it became unclear whether or not the image was muddled or grainy or if it was just the added element of rain.<br /><br />That said, other aspects of the transfer fare better. There are no wonky technical issues, skin tones look good, detail is heightened, and blacks are deep and dark.<br /><br />The only other major problem has nothing to do with the crispness of the image, but rather the newly presented high definition presentation, in which the visual effects (of which there are many) look even lousier. Watch those baby Godzillas bouncing around Madison Square Garden and you'll wish Ray Harryhausen had slapped the filmmakers.<br /><br />Now The Audio:<br /><br />On the other hand, the lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is truly impressive. Literally from the opening frame, when the dirigible in the logo for Emmerich and Devlin's Centropolis Films production shingle flies through your living room, you'll know you're in for a treat.<br /><br />This is one of those kick-ass mixes where, if you turn it up all the way, you'll probably get complaints from the neighbors, while at the same time there's enough nuance, subtlety and directionality of the mix that you'll actually be impressed, and not just for its sofa-shaking prowess.<br /><br />Literally, the action sequences spring violently to life. Rubble cascades from buildings, suspension bridges snap and sway, and Godzilla lets out his piercing roar with such lifelike force that you'll wonder if the dinosaur-ish creature is in your home. There's always so much going on, with an emphasis on bowel-rattling bass that you'll wonder if you can take it all. You do, because it's that good.<br /><br />That said, every effect is crisp and clear, the atmospherics (like that persistent rain) remain admirable and in the few sequences with dialogue, that too is crisp, clear and also well prioritized, even when competing with the on-screen mayhem. David Arnold's fantastic score, which is often overlooked, also sounds spectacular.<br /><br />This mix really is reference-quality and was almost enough for me to watch the movie again. I said almost.<br /><br />Also included are mixes in French DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, Spanish Dolby Digital 5.1, Portuguese DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 with subtitles in English, English SDH, French, Portuguese, and Spanish.<br /><br />The Bottom Line is,<br />I might just only go see this movie for it's crisp audio track.<br /><br />Video: 4/5<br />Audio: 5/5<br />Movie: 2/5f the dinosaur-ish creature is in your home.

B000EUDAWG|1.0|Cool concept ordered by mistake bad habits I have leave options in the cart and forgetting them I thought my niece might enjoy it and decided I'd try it out. I'm a big kid at heart and would ordered another for her if it was cool. The package might have been dropped the axel was bent and the wheels were broken. I might fix it sometime or though it out but for now it looks cool on my fridge not doing anything even if it sheds a little.

B0034DGPEU|3.0|This was an interesting take on the typical pre-emancipation plantation story.  Irish indentured servent Lavinia is stuck in between worlds when she's brought to a southern plantation after being orphaned enroute to America.  Adopted into a loving black family, she's still set apart by her skin color and never quite fits in.  She is witness to the strata of social organization on the plantation, not only between the blacks and the whites, but also between the house slaves and the field slaves.  When she returns years later as a lady, free from her indenture, she can't regain the place in the loving family she once held.  At the same time, she's not comfortable in the world of her slave owning husband.    I enjoyed the interesting perspective this book gave on the white indentured servants in the south during the time of slavery.  Its not a common subject for fiction.  The characters were very well developed and I enjoyed how the alternating points of view pushed the story along.    I did feel the ending was a little too easy.  It seemed like the author felt the need to tie everything up in a neat little bow and it didn't quite fit for me.
030746363X|5.0|This book is a great read with hard science to back up some truly revolutionary methods for the body you want. No cookie cutter nonsense, Tim advocates putting your plan together your own way for the specific results you want. Whether that's less fat, more muscle, better sex, a perfect bum, or anything else. He's sure to set you on the right path. I've bought 4 copies 1 for me and three for friends, highly recommended!

0307913090|5.0|THIS IS A REVIEW FOR THE AUDIO VERSION ONLY:<br /><br />I love listening to \\"books on tape\\" or CD or whatever.  I have always liked listening to someone read a story from as long as I can remember, and this book is one that I could not stop myself from listening to.<br /><br />When I opened the box, I was surprised to see that the book was 28 discs long, I think this is due in large part to the length of the book and also the pace at which it is read.<br /><br />I will not comment on the story itself except to say that it it extremely engaging and there were many times I had to sit in the truck to finish up a part of the story before getting out for home or work.  I assume that if you are looking at the audio version, you are already somewhat familiar with the story itself.<br /><br />The book is read by Roy Dotrice who sounds like an old English nobleman himself, and I believe does a good job keeping up with the different voices.  Some of them sound alike, but there are so many characters, I think that is forgivable.  The cover says he holds a worlds record for the number of characters he portrays in this book.<br /><br />One reviewer noted that his women's voices were poor, but that is because it is an old man trying to make his voice sound like a little girl.  He does notably change his inflection when those characters speak, so it is not as if he is just monotoning his way through their parts.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you have 50+ hours of commute or travel time coming up and you are at all interested in this book, I do not think you will be disappointed with what you hear.  Hearing this story really brings it to life in a way that reading it did not, and Dotrice does an excellent job of bringing Martin's characters and world to life.
1401225756|4.0|Like almost anyone who has an interest in comics, I had heard the hype for Sandman for years. I have been a fan of Neil Gaiman's work since my early teens (American Gods and Stardust are incredible, and his short stories are a must-read!), but for some reason I had never gotten around to reading what many consider to be his magnum opus. Finally, I was hanging out at Barnes & Noble one day, waiting for a ride, and I picked up a copy of Preludes & Nocturnes. What I found left me a bit conflicted. The story was decent, and the concept of the series is spectacular. Understanding that this was just an introduction to the series and the point at which Gaiman was testing the water, it was a pretty good comic-- storywise. The art, I must say, was a turnoff. The TPB I was reading was released prior to the recoloring, and it was a mess, to say the least. So, when I found out that the recolored editions were being released in TPBs, I didn't hesitate. The newly colored and remastered edition makes a significant difference.Though the pencils and inking are still not so great, we can probably chalk that up to the fact that when the series was first published, DC wasn't throwing too much money at the production. I'm now up to Volume 5, and the story just keeps getting better, and the art becomes more beautiful by the issue. In fact, as production quality had improved by the early to mid 90's, the original print TPBs are fine to buy for volumes 6-10. My suggestion is to buy this book, enter the world of Sandman, and then keep going.

1400097029|5.0|Thank you, John Banville, for your most exquisite and exquisitely slow book, \\"The Sea\\"  (which I just found out won the Booker in 2005, and is his 18th novel (!)). Because of an over zealous traveling and social schedule, it took me more than 2 months to finish TS, but I'm glad because it meant I got to live with some of the most beautiful language I've ever read (I'm taking the liberty of inserting it liberally (in quotes) in this review). The first line alone felled me: \\"They departed, the gods, on the day of the strange tide.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Sea\\" recounts the wry, sharp, lush memories of Max, a middle aged Irishman, recently widowed, who returns to his childhood holiday home to  escape and grieve. \\"The past beats inside me like a second heart.\\"<br /><br />In the vivid \\"salt sharpened light\\" and \\"the air like scratched glass\\" that imbues the book, Max remembers his summer loves, the cruel and clever Chloe and her spacy sexpot mother, Mrs. Grace, and his last love, the beautiful Anna. In between, a host of other characters are described with Dickensian/Nabakovian genius. A phrase as small as \\"a silky, sulky gracefulness\\" is as perfect as one of his longer descriptions:<br /><br />\\"She wore a sack-coloured tweed dress tightly belted in the middle, which made her look as if she had been pumped up to bursting at bosom and hips, and her short stout cork-coloured legs were stuck out in front of her like two gigantic bungs protruding from her nether regions. A tiny sweet face, delicate of feature and pinkly aglow, is set in the big pale pudding of her head, the fossil remains, marvellously preserved, of the girl that she once was, long ago.\\"<br /><br />Does it matter that Bun (her of the tweed dress) is a side character who appears only once and with no lingering pre or foreshadowing? Not when the description itself is this marvellous.<br /><br />I am also in awe of Mr. Banville's vocabulary. Some of it is archaic usage, but most is not. I cannot believe how many wordsI had to look up (thank you, iPod Touch, for your amazing touch-the-word-for-its-definition feature). Here are a few: revenant, leporine, strangury, losel, louring, proscenium, flocculent, womby, minatory, gleet, bosky, scurf, ziggurat, cicatrice, ichor, maenad, rufous, craquelured, canthus, groynes, cinereal, horrent, anaglypta, glair, cretonne, hugger-mugger, costive, boreens, catafalque, jeroboam, bombazine, cruets, scumbling, jack tar, soughing, knobkerrie, assegais, blench, anabasis, and vulgate. Now would that I remember even a fraction of those that I looked up.<br /><br />Mr. Banville's precise and lyrical descriptions extend well beyond his characterisations. After all, \\"what are living beings, compared to the enduring intensity of mere things?\\" This wondering adjoins his description of a train just arrived:<br /><br />\\"And the steam engine, of course, that had come to a clanking stop over in the station, and stood now seething and gasping and squirting jets of scalding water from its fascinatingly intricate underparts as it waited impatiently to be off again.\\"<br /><br />And this dazzler: \\"A chintz-covered sofa sprawls as if aghast, its two arms flung wide and cushions sagging.\\"<br /><br />Sometimes, he cannot even let his protagonist keep churning out these gems without comment: \\"In the porch, a pot of geraniums flourished aloft their last burning blossoms of the season. Honestly, this world.\\"<br /><br />Honestly indeed. There's everything else and nothing else to the story. It's about the human condition, and also about how none of it matters. If you like your fiction loosely narrative and densely poetic, this is your book. Meanwhile, I'll have to download more Banville rightquick. Luckily there's at least 17 more.
B002ZG9760|3.0|I gave this a fair watching and had no expectations as the cheese factor was already advertised well ahead of time. But after watching all of the supplements, I saw that there was some sincerity put into the making of this, so I put aside the bad acting (the worst I have seen for several of these competent actors) and questionable writing to just try and get some light entertainment.<br /><br />The story follows our great looking character as he is smitten with himself but is disfigured to learn the lessons of finding himself and real love. You get your spattering of high school antics being played by post-college grads and adults, culminated with a totally unbelievable love story in a forced situation. The picture quality is not benchmark but does show some strength in the daytime sequences. The DTS also has some nice moments (nightclub scene, some echoes) but most of the surround time is from that soundtrack (love or hate it). The supplements are a mixed bag though:<br /><br />* Alternate ending, 10:13 minutes. I initially saw this and thought how much better it would have been to keep this grittier and completely different ending in the film - but then the cheesy writer came through in full force to make it have to be cut. Answers the question of where those scenes went we saw in the trailer.<br />* Deleted scenes, 5 minutes. They are actually like alternate takes, with the hilarious exception of the zoo sequence as it was a verbatim piggyback-from-Twilight copy...barf.<br />* Classic Tale Retold, 10:06 minutes. A very clip-heavy interview piece about how they brought this story to screen and character analysis by the actors (almost worth the watch for the unintended humor). The clips total more than half of this.<br />* Creating the Beast, 5:01 minutes. A background on the concepts and make-up for Pettyfer's face.<br />* Music Video, Kristina and the Dolls, 3:00 minutes. I can tolerate the shaky cam thing fairly well, but when did this earthquake cam thing start (brutally fast vibrational cam)? Irritating.<br /><br />5.1 DTS English only and subs in same. I was surprised as usually Sony includes a great deal more for languages and subs.

B004Q7E0TA|5.0|Better known as \\"Ellen DeGeneres' wife\\", Portia De Rossi shares her struggle with anorexia.  The book was well-written and the author has a pleasant and honest voice on the CD.  I liked her!    I think these five factors led Portia down a self-destructive path:    1. Modeling sub-culture - not healthy.  Obsessed with weight and appearance.    2. Hollywood sub-culture - not healthy.  Obsessed with image. Terrified Paparazzi will destroy it.    3. Families and groups that pressure gay members to stay closeted - not healthy.    4. That voice in your head that tells you to lie to win approval or be successful - not healthy.    5. That voice in your head that tells you you are a loser -not healthy.  Portia thought it was ironic she was chosen to be a L'Oreal model because her true inner dialogue was \\"Because I'm not worth it!\\"    I could relate to the pressure to keep everybody happy instead of speaking the truth.  I could relate to thinking too much about food (whether it's what I want or what I can't have).  There were lots of good lessons in this book.  It also helped me understand the thought pattern of someone with an eating disorder.    So how did she find health? First: a kick in the pants. Her doctors told her the facts: you are DYING.  The prospect of dying freed her to live. She finally went public about being gay - too bad if it hurts my chances for leading lady roles - I'm dying!  She let herself eat whatever she wanted - I'm dying!  After gaining too much weight, she got sick of the junk food after awhile, cut out meat, and hit a healthy weight (too bad if it's not model thin - it beats dying!).  She finally told that negative voice in her head to shut-up.    The Epilogue gave the impression \\"and now I don't have any problems whatsoever!\\"  I doubt that.  But the rest of the book was brutally honest and intelligent. For her, I believe the lessons of TRANSPARENCY, SELF-LOVE, and DETACHING FROM RESULTS (who cares, I'm dying!) were indeed keys to healing.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|I like everything about this album. Tedeschi's singing is superb. Derek Trucks' solos are each a miniature masterpiece. Great band, great arrangements, and excellent production.<br /><br />\\"Midnight In Harlem\\" is an achingly beautiful ballad - one of the best new songs in recent memory, in any genre. This track alone repays the cost of the CD. (I must have played the live version from [[ASIN:B00428CPUY Crossroads Guitar Festival 2010]] at least a dozen times before the release of Revelator.)<br /><br />If I could, I'd give this four and a half stars; the only shortcoming being a lack of truly outstanding songs. The exultant \\"Bound for Glory\\" is a classic, as is the slow-building soul of \\"Until You Remember\\". The rest of the album is solid, and there are certainly no clangers, but the playing tends to outstrip the material.<br /><br />For mine, this is Derek Trucks' most cohesive effort in the studio, and it may be Tedeschi's as well. I don't necessarily prefer the relative economy of this \\"song oriented\\" release to the great jamming on DTB's best live recordings, but is there a need to choose? (Several reviews here make the mistake of criticising the CD for not being something else.)<br /><br />I welcome this addition to the collective Tedeschi / Trucks catalogue. It will be on high rotation at my place for months to come.
B000UR9T7I|4.0|This is one of those movies where I can't quite understand all of the negative reviews that flood the internet.  People seem upset about mostly one thing (too many villans) and retaliate with one star ratings and uninsightful reviews.      The director wanted Sandman (and I'm glad he was included) and there was pressure from the studio and fans to include the New Goblin and Venom. (Given how the second movie ended, it would have been wrong NOT to include the New Goblin.)  Given that he was trying to please everyone, I think he did a great job weaving them all into the story.    The complaints that this one isn't as funny or bright as the other two is absurd.  Part of the story is Spiderman's struggle emotionally and using his powers for the wrong reasons.  To have a happy, cheerful movie with this going on wouldn't feel right.  And this was needed because this is how Venom is created.    I thought the CGI work with Sandman was absolutely amazing.  The previous movies were nominated for visual effects, so 3 had some big shoes to fill.  The action sequences are pretty cool, though for some reason, don't seem to match up to the first two movies.    I fully acknowledge that this movie doesn't really match up to the first 2, but I do think it's also highly underrated.  Take the negative reviews with a grain of sand (intentional pun).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was a little skeptical about this book, because this isnt usually my genre of books, but i couldn't put it down... literally. I read this book in one day!

It was awesome, i'm getting ready to buy the other two because i just have to know more!
B001UV4XHY|3.0|I have to agree that this movie leaves a lot to be desired. As a hp fan, I anticipate the movies and expect them to live up to the hype. This film was moody and had little to no plot. The gang spends the majority of the movie searching for horcruxes in the wilderness. On the other hand, the production team was able to do a good job to make the movie an entertaining visual experience.
1907590250|2.0|I recently read Hemingway's memoir A Moveable Feast and quite liked it although I couldn't take it seriously.<br /><br />I then thought I would try one of his novels and chose this one which I first read over 30 years ago.<br /><br />Although fiction, it contains the kind of banal, idiotic statements that pepper A Moveable Feast e.g. \\"It was always pleasant crossing bridges in Paris\\", \\"It felt good to be warm and in bed\\", \\"It felt good lying on the ground\\" and \\"A bottle of wine is good company.\\"<br /><br />The only good thing I can say about this book is that it is mercifully short.<br /><br />It is set in France and Spain in the 1920s and focuses on the lives of a bunch of expatriates seen through the eyes of an American journalist called Barnes.<br /><br />Barnes was wounded in the war (as Hemingway was) and appears to have been emasculated and is therefore incapable of consummating his love for the main female character, a drunken Englishwoman called Lady Brett Ashley.<br /><br />The scenes in Paris consist of drunken monologues and dialogues, descriptions of eating and drinking and street-by-street accounts of walks or drives and name-dropping of sights, cafes and restaurants. Nothing actually happens.<br /><br />Things perk up when they go to the bullfighting fiesta in Pamplona and the violence in the ring is accompanied by some shouting and fisticuffs between two other admirers of Lady Brett. One is an American Jew whom we are supposed to believe is a boxer and the other a Scotsman although he talks like an upper class English twit.<br /><br />Despite this flurry of activity, much of this part reads like a leaden travelogue of the sights and sounds of bus, car, train and fishing trips with comments on every field and hill that passes.<br /><br />Hemingway's famous unsparing style which generations of Americans have been brainwashed into thinking is great reads like a parody.<br /><br />If you don't believe me, here is a sample:<br /><br />\\"They went up-stairs and I stopped to speak to Montoya.<br />`Well, how did you like the bulls?' he asked.<br />`Good. They were nice bulls.'<br />`They're all right' - Montoya shook his head - `but they're not too good.'<br />`What didn't you like about them?'<br />`I don't know. They just didn't give me the feeling that they were so good.'<br />`I know what you mean.'<br />`They're all right.'\\"<br /><br />Pure Hemingway - the great bull artist!sked.   `Good. They were nice bulls.'   `They're all right' - Montoya shook his head - `but they're not too good.'   `What didn't you like about them?'   `I don't know. They just didn't give me the feeling that they were so good.'   `I know what you mean.'   `They're all right.'\\"     Pure Hemingway - the great bull artist!

0345528581|5.0|Finally, a fitness book that doesn't blow smoke, it contains great scientifically back information on how strength training exercises are superior to straight aerobic training. This book contains a simple break down on nutrition, with enough execises to vary up your routine forever. This book keeps it simple, but if your looking for an easy workout, that is not what this book is geared towards. The exercises are strenuous, but the routines are short in duration, and the results are surprising.
B000E6ESL2|4.0|A gorgeously-shot, intricately assembled puzzle. Marc Forster's film before his delightfully original \\"Stranger Than Fiction,\\" \\"Stay\\" is full of subtle eye candy tricks that hint all along where it's going, and establishes Forster as a director with strong, visual/cinematic ideas.<br /><br />I picked up the DVD based on the cast and the cost (it was, sadly, steeply discounted), and didn't realize it was Forster's work. I'd read no reviews, had no awareness of the film from its theatrical release, and watched it \\"cold.\\" I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />I look forward to turning my movie-loving friends onto this gem -- it really is a treat for those who love a good puzzle, who like to watch good actors having fun with layered characters, and for anyone who thinks there aren't enough directors with a painter's imagination -- who treat film as a canvas and approach stories with an insightful, visual flair.

It has been a great reading experience.  Ironically, I use my Kindle app more than my sister uses her actual Kindle.  I've also read ebooks on Good Reader and iBooks.

0316069884|1.0|Why is this book the summer read for the University of North Carolina ant Chapel Hill? They start indoctrinating the kids BEFORE they even get there. This is nothing other than a rant about how awful America is. Now you will see other enlightened reviews talking about how the author is just trying to get you to think about where you food comes from and how it is produced. Don't buy it! Typical situational writing based on one persons perceived idea of Utopia without a single thought as to the rational or consequences to their opinions.
0061537934|5.0|A great book for anyone who has loved a dog.  Not just owned a dog.  You will laugh, cry, cringe and pet your own dog.  If you like race cars, it is a real bonus.  This book was shared with me, then I passed it on to two more people.  Yes, it is a little predictable, but any perceptive person was MEANT to figure out the path the book would take when they read the first chapter. Still it is sweet and charming.  A quick read.

0439023521|5.0|After reading several reviews and a lot of positive things from friends, I decided to give this book a try.  I was hooked on the first page and finished in a day!  That nevers happens with any books I read.  This book was gripping, exciting, and emotional.  Don't be fooled though, this book will have you thinking about it long after you have finished it.  There were parts that truly scared me and I found myself having bad dreams, but I wouldn't trade that for what a wonderful well written book this is.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|It is a really great book. It takes time to get used to the style of Martin and you should accept the fact that some of the characters are not of the brightest, but after that it goes very smoothly. If you want a serious reading and a book that spares no details, you should read A Song of Ice and Fire.
1935251740|5.0|I've read this book many times, not only for inspiration, but to counterbalance the stale view of life that has been around for centuries.     In his excellent book review, Michael Spiller wrote: \\"If I had to reduce this book to one statement it would be:  My perceptions are reality.  They are the only reality I can ever know because the universe is literally in my head; it was born when I was born, it will die when I die.  From the common point of view, this is outrageously narcissistic.  From the standpoint of neuroanatomy, however, it is indisputable:  In the author's words, `The animal observer creates reality and not the other way around.' This premise is fleshed out in a number of fascinating ways in the book's almost 200 pages.\\"    \\"Some of my favorite parts of the book include:      * The mind-teasing chapter \\"Where Is the Universe?\\" in which Lanza presents the idea that what we are looking at, right now, \\"out there,\\" is mind, or consciousness.  He says -- and I am forced to agree with him -- that this cannot be grasped with the logic of language.    * In this same chapter Lanza attacks our cherished notion of self-determined control.  Experiments with cognitive function have shown that the brain sometimes makes a decision to act a full ten seconds before action is taken.  His implication:  We can relax and enjoy ourselves, because we will do whatever we need to do anyway.    * \\"When Tomorrow Comes Before Yesterday,\\" in which Lanza describes some of the classic experiments that have proven the validity of quantum physics.  I find the quotation included from Nobel laureate Richard Feynman especially comforting:  \\"I think it is safe to say that no one understands quantum mechanics.  Do not keep saying to yourself, if you can possibly avoid it, `But how can it be like that?' because you will go `down the drain' into a blind alley from which nobody has yet escaped.\\"    ... I find it endlessly startling and refreshing to remind myself that the person sitting nextto me - while they might agree with me about the color of the carpet in front of us or the sound of that bird outside the window - is watching a movie that is uniquely different from mine, and one that I can never rent from Netflix. This insight, no matter how conceptual or superficial, can also serve as the starting point for personal responsibility.  If I can be aware that my universe is the only one there is, then maybe I can treat it with more care.  And that could potentially make your universe a little better.    It is astounding -- not to mention humbling -- that I appear to be doomed to forget this fact almost every moment of my waking life.  Fortunately, I do have the ability to remind myself, and to the degree that I am able to do that (which increases with my own sense of urgency to do so), I get to experience life in a more open, sane and engaging way.  In-between these tiny moments of awareness, I have people like Ta-Hui, Yuan-Wu and Dr. Robert Lanza to remind me.\\"
B004EC5IUW|3.0|I liked the original series, and I liked 1.11.  I guess this new series is touted as a 're-imagining'.  So, my fault for thinking it would keep the underlying motivations and depictions of the characters similar.    If you are a fan of the original series and thinking about buying this movie, consider this:  In this movie, Shinji's father tells him he did a good job, Asuka decides that she can't fight the angels alone, and Rei tells Shinji that his miso soup is delicious.  Need I say more?
B004XN3FHA|5.0|This an extremely bright light.  As in unpleasant to look at with your eyes closed.  It has nice heft, good feel, easy to use controls and can stand on the end cap. The Art Deco radiator fins are a nice touch.    There are a few minor cons:  There's a Caution Hot sticker on the reflector but I haven't burned myself on it.  I think the end cap is a bit light and screwing it down lacks the silky feel of my TK10.  You can stand it on the end cap but it will fall over at the slightest urging.  I prefer a somewhat more agressive anti-roll than just reflector flats.

B0049JPU8A|5.0|I liked \\"For The First Time\\" hearing it on the radio and bought this cd.  Great album.  Great band.  I like the singer's voice, very unique.

193659434X|5.0|\\"A Christmas Carol\\" represents not only Charles Dickens' most memorable work. but  perhaps the most perfectly plotted story in the history of literature. What other tale has been retold so often, in movies, cartoons, etc.? The heart warming ending never loses its charm, and even for a jaded public that now largely shuns morality plays, the timeless message always finds a receptive audience.<br /><br />Because of the brevity of this story, which is not one of Dickens' colossal novels, the deep complexity of the characters is slightly lacking, as is the terrific humor found in his longer works. Still, the master managed to create a man that everyone can understand, and give him a believable history in comparably few pages. He also bestowed an unforgettable  name upon him, that melded seamlessly with his personality.<br /><br />This story can still inspire, and lift the spirits of any reader. What more could we possibly ask of any writer?
B003XTKMBC|5.0|I've owned three of Kotobukiya's ArtFX statues top date, and this is the only one I've liked enough to keep. The problem with the line in general is that Koto uses vinyl for its statues instead of polystone like most American companies. Vinyl is lighter, cheaper, and more durable, but the flip side is that it usually doesn't look as good. In the case of the Iron Man Mark IV and Jack Sparrow statues, the vinyl just wasn't up to the task of mimicking the look of an armored superhero or a heavily clothed pirate. They looked like large action figures, not high-end collectibles.<br /><br />But with Darth Maul, Koto finally succeeded in winning me over. Maul's unusual skin tone helps offset the generally plastic-y look of these statues, and the result is that collectors can admire the statue without reservations. The pose is excellent, paying homage to the historic Japanese samurai paintings while still remaining distinctly Darth Maul. The sculpt has a real sense of energy and malice, perfect for a twisted villain like Maul. The lightsaber really adds to the effect, and the light-up function is much better than you'll find at companies like Sideshow.<br /><br />The statue is 1:7 scale, making it just big enough to fit in with the Gentle Giant statues on my shelf. I wish it were a little bigger, but the statue is a fair size for the price.<br /><br />The statue comes in several pieces, but it shouldn't take more than a couple minutes to have him fully assembled and ready to display. The box is pretty flimsy, however. I usually save all my statue boxes in case I move or sell them, but I may not even bother with this one. The benefit of a vinyl statue is that it's not prone to breaking anyway.<br /><br />Sideshow is prepping a similar Maul statue as part of its upcoming Star Wars maquette line. It may be worth waiting to see how that statue turns out. On the other hand, Sideshow will charge 2-3 times what this piece costs. If you want an eye-popping Darth maul collectible on a budget, this is definitely the way to go.the way to go.

B0000AOV85|5.0|One thing I've come to understand about the members of Pink Floyd is that they can go off on some seriously screwed up, self-important stream of consciousness rants and raves when left unchecked, but under the eye of an efficient editor they come across as unbridled geniuses. Live in Pompeii is a startling example of the former, with the drugged-out bandmates going on and on about themselves like a real-life version of Spinal Tap, while this brief almost-hour-long documentary is evidence of the latter. Interspersing the best nuggets of the band's commentary with insightful sound bytes from critics, peers and the men behind the soundboard during taping makes for a winning combination that had me falling in love with this classic album all over again. Roger Waters is especially moving in his careful explanation of the themes and lyrics behind \\"Time,\\" and there's something hypnotic about watching David Gilmour lovingly recreate the guitar solo from same song without any backing musicians. A magical, magnificent look at one of my favorite albums; my only complaint is that it wasn't any longer.
B004WPYNY8|4.0|Let's get one thing straight, while this album may not have the symphonic compositions that are found on \\"V\\" or \\"The Oddysey,\\" it is in no way, shape or form a duplication or even continuation of 2007's \\" Paradist Lost.\\" To me, \\"Iconoclast\\" is a much more raw and aggressive album. From beginning to end Michael Romeo guides you through a shred-fest of aggressive riffage and melodic solo's. While I will say that those that enjoyed \\"Paradist Lost\\" over X's previous releases will be more inclined to enjoy \\"Iconoclast\\" simply for the absense of symphonic pieces or sound-scapes, if you will. To any metal head who enjoys true and technical talent this album will be a welcome addition to your metal collection. Don't trust the reviews, give this album a test drive for yourself.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Well, that was the question some of my friends made me when my Box Set of The Beatles In Mono arrived. That was the same question when they saw me receiving a box set of Enrico Caruso. Maybe some people cannot understand why an audiophyle could be interested to hear historical recordings, specially those that marked the history of the humanity. I really wanted to live those moments. I haven't lived such fever (I was born in 1964) and is amazing for me to discover what the people of those days were hearing and why. And I am not referring about just the music, but everything that was around it to create the full atmosphere wrapping The Beatlemania of those years.<br /><br />What I normally do is to hear the music in two phases: 1) The moment were I am, and 2) the moment were it was recorded and issued. With this said, if I hear an Enrico Caruso recording today, its sound is boring, dificult to understand, badly achieved and produced, and a loss of time. If I hear an Enrico Caruso recording taking in account the time when it was recorded and issued, I hear a magnificent sound, amazing achievements, emotional, and a revolutionary way to have such a great and recognized artist in my own hall.<br /><br />Now, as for The Beatles, I see moments when humanity was still broken by a recently ended bloodroot world war, where people still remembered their dead ones, and young people were born with bombs and shoots as their atmosphere. With deep financial problems, limitation in their diets and a deep willing towards rebellion. And, then, a musical group, with the same hungry as the other teenages of their same age, came singing to love with furious guitars and thunderous drums (with a really well recorded sound, contrary to the ill recorded sound of Elvis Presley). Being in such epoch, then having the original mono recordings of the time matters so much, as Stereo versions are more suited to try to match modern recordings.<br /><br />Then, if you want to live such era, the mono recordings has much to do. That's why I bought this collection, and it took me back in time. Stereo versions don't. And this is a way to remember from where we came, and why we are now where we are. That's why is worth to buy the mono box set of The Beatles (and other artists).o. That's why I bought this collection, and it took me back in time. Stereo versions don't.

0316017922|5.0|I have just been sucked in by a book that is about statistical anomalies. That can't be right ...    This was my first Gladwell book. Excellent writer. It takes someone special to make such an interesting book about such a, at first glance, boring subject.
0817439390|5.0|I've been a serious amateur photographer for a couple years now. I have a camera that cost more than my first car, and I shoot thousands of pictures every year. It's recently become obvious to me, though, that I don't really know what I'm doing. I'm an artist, I have a good eye (I think so anyway), I know how to compose interesting shots and what to look for in lighting conditions and the like. the thing is, I never really learned to use my camera properly, so I've done the majority of my shooting in Program mode (\\"P\\" on the dial). Frankly, that's embarassing.    SO I looked around for a good, reliable book to help me learn how to take control of my camera. Again and again this came up as a recommendation, so eventually I picked it up. I wish I'd done that years ago.    This isn't the most comprehensive book. The organization is a bit random, and I swear there are times the author refers to things as if they were covered earlier in the book, only they're nowhere to be found. This is the third edition of a book that's been around for decades, so it does seem a bit old fashioned in places. The thing is, none of that matters one bit.    I don't think any piece of reading, viewing, or instruction has changed how I handle my camera more. It's a quick read, but when I finished I was playing with settings I didn't dare to touch before, and I feel like I know what I'm doing now (at least, a lot more than I did).    This might not be the flashiest book, and it might seem a little light and scattered, but don't let that fool you. This is a fantastic way to up your game, I can't recommend it enough.
B004XWLN20|3.0|I have been a Superman fan since childhood, and that is a lot because I am now 45. When Smallville was first Anounced, I was beside myself; Previews of the show in comic book conferences were fantastic, I could not wait. Then it came... And even though sometimes I would think about comic book history being erased and so on, I still watched on.. When the show became the freak of the week, I continue to hold on... And the show did not disappoint. Now is over.   I had all seasons of the show, and have a couple in blu-ray. I sold the non HD DVDs, and was ready to sell the blu rays in preparation for the complete set, but given the fact that it won't be available in bd I dnt think I'll get the set. I believe I will purchase the hd digital versions of the first seasons and keep my bds. Why would I buy a complete set if the quality will be less than what I have? Yes, the additional features are tempting, but I can always rent them, and I am sure, at some point, someone will sell their extra features copy. I would go as far as buy the entire set even if only 5 seasons are bd and the rest are not... So, WB, you are wrong. Only people who do not already own bd seasons of the show will buy it. I always sell my single seasons whe a collection comes out, and it is justifyable because is better. More features and so on... Well not this time. I would give more stars, but without bd, I won't.   Note: I am not rating the show, but the collection and my thoughts on the lack of BDs.
B0050PYNP8|1.0|I wanted to see this movie (even though I saw no previews to it) because I think Simon Pegg is absolutely hilarious. I've been wanting to see him in his other movies, as well as Nick Frost, as it is extremely apparent that they make a awesome duo.    The first half of this film, I laughed very much out-loud in the theater, as did my friend, and as did the full-house audience. We were having a really good time with it. Then the character of the one-eyed woman and her Father were introduced. From that point on, it became an over-the-top, all-out, no-holds-barred, everything-goes, Christian bashing movie. THANK GOD that the laughter from the audience was cut to nearly nothing during the second half. It was definitely not just me who was offended.    For the past couple decades I've noticed the dramatic and frightening increase of verbal attacks and intolerance against Christian's from this particular culture, and it has become so INCREDIBLY blatant, harsh and so common-ground (this movie drug it on throughout the ENTIRE later half), however, if someone so much as merely disagrees with something one of them may be doing, someone will scream \\"Intolerance!\\" or \\"Anti-Semitism!\\" Why the difference???    For those of you who may not have had a complete education in prejudism; by simply not agreeing with something or someone from a different culture does NOT mean it's prejudism. If we disagree with something our child, spouse, friend, or family member does or says, reprimanding them does NOT mean we hate or loathe them - on the contrary - it's because we desire others to use more amicable manners and methods that express respect and acceptance towards others.    How ironic that some want others to constantly remember what they were forced to suffer through, yet some want to create a Christian Holocaust in the country where Christianity WAS THE FOUNDING FAITH, AND one of the countries that went to their aid and allowed multi thousands into our own country so they could be safe. We did that from our hearts, but we didn't do that so our own country could be turned upside down and our faith could be horribly spat upon.    I would give the first part of this movie a 7, but because of the later half, a 1. I don't care how popular ANYONE gets - it just doesn't ever give a person the right to bash other people in such a horrendous manner.
0385732554|5.0|I was unsure I would like this book when I 1st got it. Because I am not really a big fan of \\"classics\\" but, this book is a Utopian, for Young Adult readers. It met all my expectations. I loved this book. I really likes Jonas. His determination, drive, his heart. He had courage, even though he wasn't given that memory from The Giver. He, had courage I could never imagine.<br />My heart broke when he found out what the release was. It was at that time, when his father said that Gabe would be released that I knew in my heart, that Jonas would not let that happen to that sweet baby, with the light eyes!<br />I had hope for Jonas. This book is full of hope. It makes you cherish your own memories. Because the life that Jonas lived in, only sameness was filled in it. No love, No hope, everything was the .. same.<br />In the end, Jonas has love, and he doesn't have to worry about hiding it anymore. For I believe that he will be ok, safe, happy and loved! He will love. He loves Gabe.<br /><br />This novel was a win for me. Please if you haven't read it. Read it. It is a fast read too. So if you have a read a thon coming up, add The Giver to your list. Add it to you TBR list anyways!

B001EN71CW|5.0|You may be asking, what is the difference between the Bluray and DVD version.    1) Picture quality, some of the scene are excellent looking, almost as if filmed in high def. Others, cleary are low resolution aka regular definition  2) Pixelation, A LOT of scenes on the DVD have pixelation (where the image gets broken up into squares),it is terrible in some scenes, Bluray does NOT have this problem    Similarities:  1) Everything else...    Is it worth it to own on Bluray? Yes, but wait for a sale. Both versions are absolutely watchable but the pixelation is horrendous on the dvd version and if you can avoid it, I would recommend you do so.

Its magical with very very good music as always and its an album you will hear many times. Its very melodic with great solos and changes in the tempo - a great piece of work in the progressive scene. I believe that Dream Theater is the best group in their scene. A must.
0375757856|5.0|Where do I start? This book kept me up at night. I couldn't wait to find out the answers to all the questions.    Some reviewers have mentioned the book's slow pace in places. There are a few slow spots, but there are far more parts where you can't stop reading.    To be fair, it took me two tries to read this book. The first time I was reading it on my iTouch, which is not a good medium for a long, drawn-out book like this. I soon lost the sense of it about halfway. Once I got a Kindle though, I started again, and ripped right through it.    People have mentioned that this is the first detective novel. That honor might go to Edgar Allan Poe's story The Murders in the Rue Morgue, but this book really is the great-grandaddy of them all. The idea of a stolen gem from an Indian idol started with this book. That alone makes it worth reading.    People have said that The Woman in White is a better book. I disagree; they are both great books. Collins' device of different narratives works well in both.    In fact, this book and its plot are so good, I had accidentally heard a spoiler (some bonehead podcaster I listened to assumed that everyone had read the book and mentioned how the Moonstone came to be stolen), but still enjoyed it (I didn't know exactly who did the deed). There is a part towards the end where you feel like you are playing the game Clue; since I got it right, I assume most readers will also.    Those of you who enjoyed this book should read The Quincunx by Charles Palliser, Michael Cox's two books, and Drood by Dan Simmons. In Drood, Charles Dickens and Wilkie Collins are the main characters, and there are many insights into The Moonstone, The Woman in White, Bleak House, and other works by them.
B000002HPT|3.0|I like Dream Theater. Most of their albums are masterpieces but this one is so different than their best material. only Peruvian skies is a good track (and its more heavy than progressive). This album is definitely for huge Dream Theater fans and collectors. If you are new start with Images and Words.
B003LSU0K8|4.0|This is one of my favorite digital wrist watch. All the functions are working just as it was advertised. I didn't have to read the user manual to set the time and other functions. I'm certain I'd keep using this watch for another 3-5 years. Although I am having a temperature reading on the watch that is not very correct. I don't know if it should be caliberated before use. Since this is my first time of using a watch with thermometer, I guess there are more things to learn.     The screen is well protected and there would be no need to fear for scratches. I really love this watch.
0316098329|5.0|Well written with a main character that is brave bold and though victimized never plays the part of the victim.  Surprising twists, but don't read the back of the book first.  It will ruin your perspective changes as you travel through the plot with the five year old main character.

B000N6TYLW|5.0|Lorelai and Rory come full circle in the show's final season's final episode where Luke arranges a graduation/farewell party for Rory in the town square despite the rain. Emily and Richard Gilmore, Lane, Taylor, Kirk, Miss Patty, Babbette and Morey and all the shows regulars make an appearance which is nice. Best of all Lorelai realizes Luke is the man for her(about time) and Rory goes on to accompany Obama on his campaign for president (after dumping Logan at Yale's graduation). The very first episode of Gilmore begins with Rory and Lorelai in Luke's diner and the final episode ends with Rory and Lorelai in Luke's diner. I only wish that the show had ended with Rory engaged to Dean (who had gone on and graduated from college but, hey his show Supernatural is still going strong).
B004AYCWY4|1.0|Firstly, the natural selection theory rests on an essay by Thomas Malthus in which he states how famine, disease, accidents keep the population down.<br /><br />The theory of evolution by natural selection is Alfred Russel Wallace and Darwin applying that to the whole of nature.<br /><br />That's it. No science, just an economics theory on population control.<br /><br />This book is a waste of time.<br /><br />Page 367: \\"We've been land animals for about 400 million years, and we've walked on our hind legs for only about the last 1 per cent of that time. For 99 per cent of our time on land, we've had a more-or-less horizontal backbone and walked on four legs. We don't know for certain what selective advantages accrued to the individuals who first rose up and walked on their hind legs, and I am going to leave that matter aside.\\"<br /><br />Page 369: Dawkins mentions human back trouble. \\"The problem, of course, is that our ancestors walked for hundreds of millions of years with the backbone held more or less horizontally, and it doesn't take kindly to the sudden readjustment imposed by the last few million.\\"<br /><br />Page 352: \\"But most mutations are disadvantageous, if only because they are random and there are many more ways of getting worse than there are ways of getting better. Natural selection promptly penalizes the bad mutations.\\"<br /><br />Well, obviously, natural selection in the case of the human back obviously does not penalize the bad mutations otherwise people would not get back trouble. Therefore, the theory is fatally flawed.<br /><br />Finally, he claims on page 62 that Darwin was not referring to races of people in the subtitle of the book On the Origin of Species or the Preservation of the Favoured Races.<br /><br />Darwin, Descent of Man, Chapter 5, Civilised Nations, contains the following:<br /><br />\\"Thus the reckless, degraded, and often vicious members of society, tend to increase at a quicker rate than the provident and generally virtuous members. Or as Mr. Greg puts the case: 'The careless, squalid, unaspiring Irishman multiplies like rabbits: the frugal, foreseeing, self-respecting, ambitious Scot, stern in his morality, spiritual in his faith, sagacious and disciplined in his intelligence, passes his best years in struggle and in celibacy, marries late, and leaves few behind him. Given a land originally peopled by a thousand Saxons and a thousand Celts, but five-sixths of the population would be Celts, but five-sixths of the property, of the power, of the intellect, would belong to the one-sixth of Saxons that remained. In the eternal \\"struggle for existence,\\" it would be the inferior and LESS favoured race that had prevailed - and prevailed by virtue not of its good qualities but of its faults.'\\"hman multiplies like rabbits: the frugal, foreseeing, self-respecting, ambitious Scot, stern in his morality, spiritual in his faith, sagacious and disciplined in his intelligence, passes his best years in struggle and in celibacy, marries late, and leaves few behind him. Given a land originally peopled by a thousand Saxons and a thousand Celts, but five-sixths of the population would be Celts, but five-sixths of the property, of the power, of the intellect, would belong to the one-sixth of Saxons that remained. In the eternal \\"struggle for existence,\\" it would be the inferior and LESS favoured race that had prevailed - and prevailed by virtue not of its good qualities but of its faults.'\\"
0061928356|5.0|Secret Daughter is the story of Somer, a white California doctor; Somer's husband Krishnan, who grew up in India and is also a doctor; Kavita, a married woman in India whose husband believes they can only afford one child and it must be a boy; and Asha, the young Indian girl Kavita gives up for adoption and always wonders about and Somer and Krishnan adopt.<br /><br />From the opening pages, I was mesmerized by the characters and stories. The novel moved through time and effortlessly shifted between narrators. I was simultaneously eager to catch up with each character and reluctant for the chapter to end. I loved following the stories of these characters who did not know their own connections to each other. I'm a huge fan of novels dealing that are stories of lives and how events shape us.<br /><br />Secret Daughter is about family and cultural identity, but Gowda blended the themes with the story beautifully. I would stop short of calling it an epic, but it does have hints of it. There were truths sprinkled throughout:<br /><br />  \\"At some point, the family you create is more important than the one you're born into.\\"<br /><br />Gowda wrote well, but I rarely found myself writing down passages. It's a novel I'll think of fondly because of its structure and story more than its language. It's a testament to the characters Gowda created that I eagerly turned the pages to see what would happen to each of them.<br /><br />Secret Daughter was unputdownable for me. I loved the pacing, story and characters. It's a novel that will stay with me for a long time and one I wholeheartedly recommend.
B00475AYJQ|1.0|I'm sorry, but really it is tripe. It's a disjointed confused convoluted tripe with no sense of direction or purpose that does not even resolve any of the loose ends in the first book. Denna is still a erm..\\"courtesan\\" shall we say, Ambrose is still a Jakis, and Kvothe still at the University with very little progress made with the main story.<br /><br />To be fair though, there is purpose in the direction of the plot, it's very obvious that the character is being shaped - he's being given a fighting prowess that few can beat and sexual skills that no mortal man can match. Sadly all of this happens without advancing the plot at all and worse yet is painfully dull.<br /><br />Problem is that from the perspective of the main character many of the actions he took in this book made no sense. He is supposed to be smart and supposed to think things through - yet many of his actions are illogical and take place for no other purpose than to force the plot in the desired direction. Perfect examples are running after Felurian, telling the Maer that he is a Ruh, going to see the Adeem when he should have been running to the Maer instead. These are all illogical actions because ultimately what Kvothe claims to want to be doing is trying to chase the Chandrian. The Maer is his best hope for that purpose, instead Kvothe wastes months meandering and when he is finally given the chance to take advantage of his connection to the Maer's power he throws it all away in a fit.<br /><br />What makes this book exceedingly annoying is that being developed as \\"Kvothe tells his tale\\" seems to give Kvothe the right to skip bits that \\"he\\" finds uninteresting and irrelevant. What makes this so jarring is that a whole chunk of river travel which involved a pirate attack that leaves Kvothe nearly drowned and penniless is completely cut out because it's \\"not relevant\\". On the other hand page after page is dedicated to a slow confused prowl through the woods with a bunch of painfully dull and disposable characters who served no real purpose. Never mid the wasted pages granted to the painfully stupid \\"romance\\" with Diaynianaa or whatever she wants to be today. If it's ok for what could have been an exciting description of a pirate attack to be narrowed down to less than a page due to irrelevance, then the whole book should have been summed up in 5 paragraphs.<br /><br />If I were the \\"Chronicler\\" I'd be throwing a fit and demanding more alcohol as there is no way a man can write this stuff down sober without cringing.sable characters who served no real purpose.

1439102724|2.0|While I enjoyed the book and the various thoughts on the topic (although sometimes too contrived), I thought the ending was much too 'hurried'.  Picoult is such a descriptive writer..yet I don't feel she described the ending of the book.  I felt as if there needs to be a sequel to this book.  For example, HOW did Liddy leave Reid?  Was it due to the fall-out of Max's decision--or did he find out Liddy's feelings toward Max?  How did Liddy make such a leap into divorcing Reid?  Both Liddy and Max were Christians who did not believe two gay parents could successfully raise a child, i.e. that the child needed a mother and a father.  How were their minds changed?      I felt very frustrated after I read the last chapter.  I felt as though Picoult had a publishing deadline and turned in what she had.  The book felt very unfinished to me.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|The 2011 Blu-ray release will NOT include the theatrical versions of the original films.  Instead they will include only the special feature versions with all of the unnecessary and distracting computer generated special effects that Lucas added years later.  If Lucas wants to re-write the films, he should re-shoot the entire movies.  Simply inserting a few minutes of special effects using the latest whiz-bang technology into a film made with older technology is completely distracting.  Furthermore the additions add nothing to the story line and are totally unnecessary.  Save your money until they sell a blu-ray release that includes the original theatrical versions.  Lucas did the same thing when the series first came out on DVD - he included only the special feature versions in the first release.  A few years later he released a set that included both the special feature versions and the original theatrical versions.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|I typically do not spend money on movies to purchase, but I bought this Blue Ray for my husband for Father's Day on Amazon.com, since it's the only thing he asked for.  Lately, I really appreciate the competitive prices and Free shipping on Amazon. I love the online survey companies that pay me through Paypal and Amazon credits, which make it easier to buy great deals through Amazon.com.  Without the free shipping, I would have bought it from Walmart for the same price during the week of Father's Day when they were on sale. Great graphics and sound quality on Blue Ray!  He loves this movie!  Will buy from this seller again, if they keep offering free(or very cheap) shipping.
B0034G4ORM|4.0|I didn't really know what to expect while watching this movie. I heard that it was special effect driven, and no character building. I would have to say that I disagree with the no character building. I was really interested in hearing the backstory of the staff sargent. I really started to wonder if his group was goning to make it out alive. I just thought it was really entertaining. It reminds me of a video game like Resistance mixed with Gears of War. The thing I've learned over time is critics like bad movies, and hate good movie. They make us believe that The King's Speech or The English Patient are good movies. They tried to say that the first Batman movie that came out in 89' was bad. If I 'd listen to what critics thought I would have missed out on some really good movies.  You just really have to judge a movie for yourself. You could always rent a movie befor you buy it.  I would just have to say that this movie reminds me of Independence Day, which I thought was good.
B0055OK2T0|1.0|Take \\"The Matrix,\\" mix it with some \\"Men in Black\\" and make it even sillier than either of them and you will have this movie, \\"The Adjustment Bureau.\\" I was stunned to see that God's workers had the power to open doors and skip to other places but only if they wore hats like Frank Sinatra. Hey, if God is called \\"The Chairman\\" why not not have them wear \\"Chairman of the Board\\" hats like Sinatra. You have not lived, in fact, until you have seen Matt Damon in his special Fedora as he scampers around Manhattan, challenging God's plan as he seeks his lady love.     Does this sound bizarre? Don't all men running for the New York senate seat run through New York in a Fedora? Don't all politicians run from beings (also wearing Fedoras) who are given the responsibility to make sure God's complicated plan (the one that makes little sense) is adhered to.     Like \\"Inception,\\" this movie is built on a created logic where anything can happen. After all, if you write the movie and create your own bizarre reality, who is to say what makes sense and what doesn't.    Wasting several good actors and a relatively sweet love story is excusable but making a drama which easily could have been a great comedy is a waste. If you want to waste time, as Matt Damon did in making this mess, watch it. You will learn to never trust anyone wearing a hat (even a yarmulke, as one of the silly characters says) and that is an essential life lesson. Another essential lesson is that bad science fiction can be mighty bad.
0920668372|5.0|I loved this book as a child, I actually would pick it up and read it, whenever I was in a store with a book section. People who find this creepy are weird unloving people. I don't think she actually drove, and climbed thru her son's window, I think it was just symbolism, of her love, what she would do for him. It was cute a sweet. I also don't think she actually rocked her soon as he got older, she just sang to him. It is a sweet book. And maybe I was a more mature child, but the thought of death wasn't scary, especially since she died when he was an adult(which is expected).
B003YOEXUM|5.0|I've got Sirius Satellite radio and it keeps me exposed to bands I might not have heard otherwise. I was listening one day and heard something that sounded familiar yet different. I looked at the display and saw Accept. After a minute I realized that it wasn't Udo singing. But it sounded great! I sampled the tracks off Amazon and ended up downloading the album. I'm glad I did. This collection is just like Balls to the Wall or Metal Heart, there's not a lame track in the bunch. A new singer definately works for this band. He sounds like a cross between Udo and Brian Johnson from AC/DC. This album won't disappoint you. It Rocks!! Buy it.

B003EYVXTQ|4.0|Jennifer Lawrence, as \\"Ree,\\" is the strong thread that weaves throughout and borders the fabric of this fine film, making it a work of art that will stand the test of time without fraying.  With the exception of Garret Dillahunt, whose play and/or direction, as Sheriff Baskin, seems too squeaky, clean, and close to the surface for the environment he faces (and who is still too much in my memory as the \\"Terminator's\\" also-remote robot, \\"Cromartie\\"), the cast is strong and perfectly rendered, from the youngest, little sister to the eldest clan leader, and Lawrence's leading performance glitters with the gold of an Oscar, as a 17-year-old girl who faces the imposed responsibilities of a lean and rustic world with both strength and sensitivity as she works her way through obstacles which any adult with smarts would find fearsome, trying to prevent a tragic loss of home and family while never losing her femininity, despite her constant work, hills-tough clothing, and the sting of a bloody beating.<br /><br />If you might be inclined to think that a story threading its way through the poverty and clan hierarchy of an Appalachian-like setting would be depressing and of little interest, with \\"Winter's Bone,\\" you would be wrong, not only because of the smart script, adapted from Daniel Woodrell's novel by the film's director, Debra Granik, and producer, Anne Rosellini, but because the human struggle for dignity and survival is there, in the dirt with most of the characters, shining throughout and to an ending that, to get to, is well worth the watching.
0786838655|4.0|This was a very entertaining start to what I hope is going to be a good series. Following Percy along on his dangerous quest, I found myself constantly curious as to what was going to happen next. What made this even better was the fact that the author thought out things in such a manner as to not provide hints of what was coming up. Riordan literally kept the reader in suspense.<br /><br />Now I will say, the book is COMPLETELY different from the movie. For one, the movie portrays Percy to be a lot older than he actually is. The characters are different, as are the bad guys. Both were great though. It was actually kind of nice being able to watch the movie first and then read the book and find that neither ruined the other for me.<br /><br />Usually, this is a major problem, when it comes to movies based on books. They always seem to be missing something or changing things that shouldn't have been changed. In this case, they did it to make the movie more interesting to a wider audience, as opposed to being mainly for kids. I can understand and appreciate it, but I did prefer the book.<br /><br />I would recommend the book to anyone, child or adult, and I definitely look forward to starting up book two in the near future. So get the book and give it a shot. Young adult books are a fun and quick way to pass the time. And when you get done, go watch the movie and enjoy some popcorn...<br /><br />Courtney Conant<br />Author of [[ASIN:B004KZORHI The Blood Moon of Winter (Land of Makayra (Volume 1))]]

B000PWIF4G|4.0|This book had some really interesting twist.  It's very based on India and it's culture but I didn't find it too difficult to understand as a foreigner.  The characters were remarkable.  Each their own real and individual person.  The story jumps around more than I had first wanted, but I quickly adjusted to it.  This quality of the book required me to be more attentive of what was going on and I soon came to love this dynamic.  By the end of the book I was breathless from all that happened.  This book allowed me to examine the small things of life and left me feeling more appreciative of their significance in this world.      I recommend this to all readers!
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|The naysayers will always mention the same things: the story is too complex, the theater isn't the right medium, film can't capture the awe of the story - all of these things have led to the Watchmen being labeled as the unfilmable movie, and none of this was helped by Watchmen author Alan Moore stating these very same feelings about it.<br /><br />The truth is that everybody wanted a Watchmen movie, but everyone was scared that it would turn out horrible. We've seen it happen to past graphic novels made for the big screen, and we've seen it happen with Alan Moore's own work. Sure movies from his past writings have been entertaining, but they also clearly missed their mark when trying to bring the majesty of Moore's stories to the big screen. In fact, many didn't even try.<br /><br />Talking about a Watchmen movie was like playing Russian roulette. It would make for an epic film, but it could also be a complete disaster. With Batman Begins showing that realism in superhero films could be accomplished, it all but sealed the fate of a Watchmen big screen debut. People were worried, but when Zac Snyder stepped up and proclaimed that if anyone was going to screw up a Watchmen movie it might as well be him - a fan - you knew, at the very least, that it wasn't going to fall completely flat. Snyder might not make the best adaption, but it also won't turn out like a Roger Corman flick.<br /><br />Zac Snyder knew that he wasn't going to make everyone happy, but in his film version of the Watchmen, if you don't come away with a sense of awe and appreciation, you're nothing more than a comic snob - nothing would have made you happy to begin with.<br /><br />Snyder did his best to make one great film about the main plot of the Watchmen, while diving into the psychology of superheroes and the tensions of the cold war. The realism was incredible, despite the often Matrix-style fight scenes. From Night Owl's self-doubt to Rorschach's steely conservativism and lunacy to Ozymandias'righteousness and god-complex to Dr. Manhattan's struggles with re-asserting his humanity, these superheroes represent a very real deconstruction of their archetypes. Even Silk Spectre's familial issues and the Comedian's parody of humanity's obsession with violence will connect with even the most detached - and superhero unfriendly - viewers.<br /><br />Despite some missing elements, missing sub-plots and minimal changes (and one major change with the ending), Snyder succeeds in capturing the essence of what made the Watchmen comic book great. In fact, Snyder is such a true fan of the comic book, that many of the visual pieces of the movie could have their frames frozen and you'd be able to match the scene with an almost identical panel from the graphic novel.<br /><br />The acting was anchored quite well by Jeffrey Dean Morgan - in the role of the Comedian - and surprisingly enough, Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach. I was skeptical of Haley upon first seeing him. His bald head and angular face didn't seem to fit well with Rorschach's under-the-mask appearance. But with the addition of red hair and freckles, Haley pulled it off visually - not to mention pouring his soul into this once-in-a-lifetime role. He truly brought Rorschach to life. Billy Crudup, meanwhile, probably had the hardest job - creating sympathy for a character who has lost his humanity. Crudup, despite the special effects managed to show just the slight amount of emotion necessary to make his character believeable.<br /><br />To add to the experience, the music for the movie was an excellence choice of songs that completely reflected the times portrayed in the film, adding a much deeper sense of realism and continuity not often felt in superhero movies.<br /><br />There were a lot of people in that theater with me, and I know many of them never read the graphic novel version of the Watchmen before. I'm hoping that seeing this movie encourages them to do so in order to appreciate Alan Moore's spectacular story on its many different levels.
0061998494|4.0|This was on my list of books to read while driving cross country as it was advertised as a comedy and I absolutely love Craig Ferguson. I figured that it would keep me occupied for hours sitting in a car. I was right! I really enjoyed this book because it was funny but also included his personal story which made it touching. Unlike some of the comedy books that are currently out, (though I do love them) this addresses some heavy topics in a humorous way without making light of them.    Ferguson starts the book with his reflections on the 2008 White House Correspondents Dinner. It is clear from this introduction that he has made it big in America despite the fact that he wasn't a citizen until recently. He then takes the reader back to Scotland where he was born and raised and mostly disliked by his peers. Growing up, he suffered through the local school system but found solace in a trip to NYC. He promised himself that he would return to America someday. Before that happened, Ferguson had a horrific descent into alcohol and drug use. It was during this time that he married his first wife and got his first divorce. After dragging himself back from this dark period in his life, he excelled and even surpassed his expectations for himself. Of course he suffered through a couple more marriages and divorces as well as some dead end jobs before he landed his position on CBS and his wife Meg. It is a contemporary twist on the American Dream/Rags to Riches story.    Though he uses humor in his writing, he is quite serious about the mistakes that he has made. I continued to laugh at his descriptions of debauchery in which he was involved but he was sure to explain that this was one of the worst parts of his life. His insights into Hollywood, the entertainment industry, and just Americans in general is right on. Sometimes it takes an outsider to truly see someone's quirks. In this case, it is a whole nation's quirks. Ferguson does an excellent job of poking fun without makingfun. I laughed throughout the book but was emotionally touched which is unique for comedies.
0596805888|5.0|I was at my local brick and mortar book store on Sunday, June 26, 2011, with my son in the children's section.  I found this book in the reference section, not in the cooking section, and maybe that's what made me pick it up and start looking at it.  While my son looked at other books, played with other kids with the Thomas Tank Engine the book store set up, I sat down and read this book, cover to cover.<br /><br />I am a web developer, and I love to cook and I love to bake.  I'm the Iron Chef type who looks in the refrigerator and comes up with an impressive gourmet meal.<br /><br />One of the things I found particularly interesting was the idea of using an iron skillet heated on the stove top to increase the temperature of a residential oven to get the crust correctly on a thin crust pizza.<br /><br />That gave me an idea - on how to make chicken tandoori without a Tandoor oven.  I have an 80 year old manually lit gas stove, that I know goes at least to 500 on full blast.  So I am going to heat an iron skillet on the stove top for about 5 minutes, then put a cake rack on it, put the chicken wings on the cake rack, and stick that very hot pan right into the hot oven, and close the door.  Hopefully, in about 10 minutes I will have tandoori chicken wings.  I'll post back later and let you all know how it goes.<br /><br />In the meantime, I highly recommend this book.

The 1st was good but that there it is WHAO, then made as me, to listen to in buckle and to go to you to like him(it)!!!
0316113506|4.0|I actually ordered the wrong book, but I found this one to be very interesting.  Wish it was a required read for all P.E. teachers and principals.  If they only understood that more exercise would help our children learn, maybe they wouldn't consider dropping recess and cutting back on P.E. time.

B003Y5H5FQ|5.0|This is an awesome movie - and - most of it was filmed on my street in Albuquerque NM , last summer!  There were film crews all over the area and I walked down a few blocks and they told me Fright Night was being filmed right here! That is so awesome! I don't know why they chose my neighborhood, but it's so cool!!  The houses you see in the main parts of the movie are on my street a few blocks down. Can't wait to purchase this on Blu-Ray!
B004SBQAL0|5.0|I found this movie to be very very interesting, entertaining and look forward to, hopefully, many many sequels.  Would buy them all.

B0000084J7|5.0|Without sounding ridiculous, I have to say this is the Greatest Album of its kind I have ever heard. Hearing it first on NPR's Echoes, I immediately zoomed up to Amazon & bought it. I have turned on other friends & will probably buy it from now on as a gift to friends & family. I have NEVER done that before. A MUST listen.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|this book captures everything and more that i enjoy reading--captivating writing, realistic characters, and plot intertwining.  this is a beautiful and poignant portrait of what exists beyond the borders of america.  this story makes me love my country and my freedom (especially as a woman), even more.  this story grabs you and ceases to let you go through to the final page.  i enjoyed the kite runner, but this book accomplishes more for me.     i can not wait for another book from this author who absolutely was born to write.  thank you for one of the most amazing stories that i have ever read.
B004RQVVGU|1.0|IN response to the previous reviewer regarding Bob Daisley's and Lee Kerslake's contributions. Their parts were removed and dubbed by other players owing to Ozzie's non payment of royalties. There may be an ongoing legal situation here. I also fully expect this review to be removed if Ozzie's people read it. However, I hope that many people read it before he does have it removed so that they are made aware of what a misery-guts Ozzie really is. Do the work, get paid what you are due. Employ the staff, PAY THEM!!! Incidentally, Bob's parts were dubbed by Rob Trujillo ... I cannot and will not ever understand what could possibly possess people to comply with a request to play overdubbed bass and drums on a piece of work which was made many years ago and was outstanding in the first place. Shame.     from Pete in Sydney, Australia.
1400052181|5.0|I loved this book, and no one is more surprised than me, since I loathe science! It was a book club assignment that I put off reading until the last possible moment, then I couldn't put it down! It turns nonfiction facts into an interesting story that reads like a novel. You can feel the years of research and obsessive commitment that went into the writing of this book. It's also a story that needs to be told. Absolutely fascinating. And very well written. My entire book club LOVED it, and we're fiction lovers, not nonfiction lovers. I guess I can stop saying I hate nonfiction. Does that make me one of the smart people?
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is not only a cool story with actors that are noticible for other great movies. The way the visual and sound effects paly with your mind takes you deep into the screen, making you feel like Scott is that boy that lives next to you, someone you know and befriended with. One of the coolest movies I've ever seen, and certainly one of the greatests.
0345529057|5.0|It's easy to see why this series was put to production. (Though I have not seen any of the series, I intend to read all of the books first.) The setting is captivating and his style of writing is easy to follow and exciting from chapter to chapter.   Enjoy!
0156027321|1.0|I was given this book by a friend for Father's Day, since he knows my interest in religion and philosophy. I'm not much of a fiction guy anymore, but I will always read gift books.<br /><br />But this book promised a good ending and belief in God but delivered neither. The muddled religious experience of Pi, reflects the liberal religious understanding of the author, who should probably read [[ASIN:0061571288 God Is Not One: The Eight Rival Religions That Run the World]] by professor Prothero. But this religious experience of Pi does little in the 2nd half of the book. I hate rabbit trails in novels, but this religious stuff was a road that practically dropped off the cliff during the castaway half of the book. Yes, it did remind me of Hemingway's [[ASIN:0684801221 The Old Man and The Sea]], and did not hold a candle to Ernest's tight and masterful writing bursting with metaphor and imagery. If only every fiction writer self-edited as tightly as the master of the short story. So the castaway stuff about survival and starvation and thirst and animal training was interesting but then it got real weird and fantastical and pretty much irritating. But I was close to the end and expected a climax to lift me out of the doldrums I was experiencing with Pi on the lonely, boring seas. But, instead I learned the real story, of murder and cannibalism and revenge. In the midst of the conclusion, Martel fears his readers won't realize the metaphor and has the Japanese investigators tell each other, who the hyena represents and who the tiger is, etc. Martel, the first rule of good writing is \\"show, don't tell.\\" I suppose the ending Martel thought as happy was having the investigation report the fantasy version instead of the real version.<br /><br />How can that be good? The story of surviving life at sea with a tiger for almost a year with a hungry tiger was fine, but learning it was a lie to cope with murders and cannibalism is somehow better? And somehow it is supposed to be an apology for faith? That sucks.<br /><br />I feel like I was served a turd pie covered in whipped cream. Thanks, but no thanks.th? That sucks.     I feel like I was served a turd pie covered in whipped cream. Thanks, but no thanks.
B0017MO10U|5.0|June 27, 2011<br /><br />I have just completed my viewing of all ten Stargate SG-1 seasons and the two movies: Ark of Truth and Continuum. Regarding the seasons, I despised the episodes that were silly and comical. Fortunately there were only a few, and therefore they should not dissuade you from watching the other episodes. Certainly Stargate SG-1 is one of my favorite TV series. It's right up there with Star Trek NG, Star Trek Voyager, Star Trek Enterprise, 4400, Battlestar Galactica, and Smallville.<br /><br />The two Stargate movies are also very good, with one important qualification. To get full appreciation of the movies, you should have familiarity with the series. I think the last three seasons--8, 9, and 10--should suffice, though of course all ten seasons would be best. Also, you should watch Stargate: The Ark of Truth after watching Season 10 and before watching Stargate: Continuum.<br /><br />Another reviewer says that Stargate: Continuum feels a bit rushed. I agree, but I neither condemn the movie nor lower my rating of it for that reason. As happened in a number of the Stargate episodes, sometimes the viewer needs to fill in details. Sometimes you get only a few words explaining what happened. But if you are attentive, if you have familiarity with the Stargate universe, and if you have a decent science-fiction imagination, you should be all right.<br /><br />Again, I think Stargate: Continuum was a very good movie. As I write, it stands as the conclusion of the Stargate SG-1 epic, and I am pleased with it.

0345479092|1.0|In my haste to acquire as much information as I could before my daughter was born, I read this book. It came 'highly recommended.' I even read it again in her first few months of life when I was figuring things out and wanting to help her adjustment into the world go as smoothly as possible. It occurred to me after discovering another philosophy (attachment parenting) that the BW ideals were not suited to me or my family. I think the book's popularity is a tragic example of popular culture influencing children's lives for the worst in the way that doctors used to tell moms to feed on schedule (vs demand) and formula-feeding and then (when babies failed to thrive) early weaning became the solution. I'm glad I had the confidence to trust my instincts and my baby and not follow the BW. We are a happy, well-balanced (with a sex life) bed-sharing (never thought I would do that) family and my daughter still sleeps about 12 hours a night. When she stirs, I touch her softly or nurse her. If she is crying at bedtime, I hold her and we dance gently until she nods off (usually I have found she cries because of gas so I don't take my chances). I don't see the benefit to having her cry at all? If she wakes in the night and catches my eye, I smile at her lovingly and she smiles back before drifting off again. My baby is my guide and I follow the premise that she is never wrong and I want to help her whenever I can. I think if you want to 'calm, connect and communicate' with your baby you might want to reach Attached at the Heart or check out the Attachment Parent International website. It is now almost my only resource and it is based on extensive research, not the ideals practiced in this book.[[ASIN:193527886X Attached at the Heart: 8 Proven Parenting Principles for Raising Connected and Compassionate Children]]
B0050CQY1W|5.0|I really dont know why some people are complaining. Knowing how capable Beyonce is, most of the pop garbage she released during the Sasha Fierce era seems to be what people like best. I personally feel that this album is probably Beyonce's best album by far, tying with Dangerously in Love, which I love A LOT!    This album has the quality and substance that I (and many other fans) have been longing from Beyonce. This album (along with her recent performances, most notably Glastonbury on Sunday) has shown how far she has come and how much she has grown since  her NO,NO,NO days back in '97. Firstly, she has vocally surpassed any female R&B singers whom were once her rivals. I also believe that Beyonce has surpased being catergorised as only an R&B artist. Like Christina Aguilera, with each album Beyonce has experimented so much that she has fully grown and progressed as an artist, no wonder she has become such an international superstar that she has become!    My Personal Favourites:  Love On Top - Classic R&B track! Never expected Beyonce to pull out a track like that  Party - Laid back and cool. Though a lot more could have been done with it. Also Andre 3000 just makes anything cool :D  End Of Time - This is the ultimate track on the album in my opinion! Really shouldve been the first single.  Countdown - This song is so fun to listen to! Boyz 2 Men's countdown gets me everytime lol!  1 + 1: Vocally impressive track, roar and gritty. Beyonce gets a little down and dirty with this one. Very emotional track  Best Thing I Never Had - Absolutely love this song, impressed by Babyface and  Bey.    The only problem i have with this album is Run The World. My main issues are that:  1. It doesnt make much sense  2. The fact that it uses Pon De Floor makes it seem so late and out of date. That song is being used by everyone that sometimes it looses its quality.  3. There isnt much music in it.  4. Beyonce's on going female empowerment songs are getting tired  5. As im a male,it makes things a little bit awkward....    Overall, a fantastic album!
0307716511|4.0|I have seen other people classify this debut novel from Rosamund Lupton as a \\"thriller\\" but I would classify it more as a \\"suspense\\" novel - and there is a difference in my mind and I'll explain why in a bit. The narrator of our story is Bea as she tells the tale of her sister's death and the questions surrounding it. Bea has been living in New York for several years and flies back to England (where her mother and sister live) to handle the arrangements and mourn her sister. The police have looked into the matter and believe that Tess committed suicide after giving birth to a still-born baby and being unable to handle the grief/post-partum psychosis associate with it. Bea can't accept that decision since she firmly believes that Tess would never kill herself and begins asking questions of the people involved to ferret out the truth. The story is told to us via a letter Bea is writing to Tess outlining the events surrounding her death and the following investigation.<br /><br />Going back to my original comment about this being a suspense novel - The death has already occurred so there isn't a lot of gore and action. The story starts out slowly and builds gradually over time with lots of character development and back story. The relationships between the characters is explored and their personal histories shared. The style of the novel is very personal and intimate which draws the reader in versus just being an observer to the narrative. It reminds me much more of a literary fiction novel that something written by James Patterson for example. If you like Michael Koryta's \\"The Cypress House\\" I think you will like this one.<br /><br />Bottom line: Page turning suspense but not heart-pounding thriller. Your mind will be engaged as you try to figure out just what happened to Tess but there aren't brutal, violent action scenes.

0375836675|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about Markus Zusak's books in general or [[ASIN:0375836675 I Am the Messenger]] in particular.  Honestly, he is one of the most amazingly talented writers I have encountered.  His use of language is utterly unique and unbelievably evocative.  He has the ability to write believable men and women, adults and children; to make you cry til you laugh and laugh til you cry.  He is a consummate story teller, weaving incredibly poignant tales full of serious messages, lighthearted moments, and beautiful imagery.  If you haven't read it already, pick it up as soon as humanly possible!
B003PIUBZS|4.0|Seriously, this show pulls out all the stops (and I'm not clear on when, exactly, it takes place in the Roman timeline).  It's got great fights, abundant nudity, Roman debauchery, profanity, gore galore, fabulous scripts and outstanding actors.  The lead character, Spartacus, is played by Andy Whitfield, an actor of extensive range with a gravelly voice who nearly dominates every scene, which is rather difficult when competing with John Hannah as the owner of the gladiators (Spartacus included).  Every episode is outstanding.  Not for the squeamish or the prudish, but definitely for those who enjoy well-written shows with no holds barred.<br /><br />I loved HBO's \\"Rome\\" series, but this is equally good yet entirely different.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Andy Whitfield became ill and has been under treatment for quite some time, which is why season two hasn't come out yet.  The wait, however, was supposedly too long, so the lead actor was replaced by someone else.  Frankly, I can't see the new guy holding a candle to Whitfield, but I guess we'll all see.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I'm not really into paranormal romance but this has to be one of the best books I've read in this genre for 2011.    Pia (I love that name) is sassy, cute, adorable and ever so funny. She has a wicked sense of humour. She thinks of 'sexy' thoughts at the most inappropriate time but her fantasies are so cute you just love her.    Then there's Dragos - what an Alpha male. What a hero to sigh for.     I love the two protagonists and the secondary characters doesn't hinder the story instead they all add to the plot and development.    It is a great read and I found myself laughing out loud on several ocassions. I can't wait for the next two instalments. I hope you will love these characters as much as I did.    Enjoy!
B0055FR5PS|1.0|I rented this movie based on the trailer alone, so I didn't really know what it was about. Had I known it was just going to be another alien invasion flick, I would have skipped it, because they're all the same story:<br /><br />1. Life on Earth is awesome.<br />2. Aliens attack.<br />3. Life sucks, and people die.<br />4. All hope is lost.<br />5. A discovery is made.<br />6. The discovery helps a hero destroy the aliens.<br />7. Earth is saved.<br />8. Everyone loves the hero.<br />9. Life on Earth is awesome again.<br /><br />I had been looking forward to this movie for the last two months, and after 1 hour, I dozed off to sleep. I woke up and watched another 15 minutes of it before forwarding it through the rest to see if there were any surprises. There weren't. I could have stayed asleep, and I wouldn't have missed anything.<br /><br />It's nice to see a patriotic USMC movie come out the week before July 4th. It's just too bad it had to be so boring.

0312330871|4.0|After years of enjoying Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple on PBS, I've finally read my first Agatha Christie novel, which is also her most popular. The novel is set on the private island of Mr. and Mrs. U.N. Owens off of Devon, England where one by one the ten guests are murdered. Their host is mysteriously absent. The guests are the only ones on the island and are unable to leave. Therefore, one of them is the murderer. Possible suspects are winnowed from the innocent chapter by chapter.<br /><br />Are any of the guests really innocent? We meet each in turn. Some are there to work, like Mr. Rogers as a butler and his wife as the cook, while others were invited for a vacation. We learn early on that every guest has either been directly or indirectly the cause of the death, but not necessarilly the murder, of others. Each guest has eluded justice...until now.<br /><br />The nursery rhyme \\"Ten Little Soldiers\\", framed on the wall of every guest's room, figures prominently in the story. The rhyme describes the deaths of ten soldiers and foreshadows those of the guests. For example, \\"Ten little Soldier boys went out to dine; One choked his little self and then there were nine.\\" The poem ends with the titular \\"...and then there were none.\\" Besides the methods of murder, other clues can be found in the rhyme.<br /><br />I don't normally read mysteries. I want to solve the mystery, before the murderer is revealed. A great deal of concentration is required, since every sentence might contain a clue or a red herring, and I'm a little too lazy to keep it all straight in my mind. But, every time I finish a mystery, whether I solve the crime or not, I find that I enjoyed the ride. This is no different with this novel. As with a good magician, there is enjoyment to be had in being deceived.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the literary device of the rhyme. Through the rhyme, she practically hand delivers clues that a lesser writer would not want to reveal so early in the novel, and then she delivers a whole new layer of mystery. You might expect that as each guest dies, the mystery would simplify, but instead it only becomes more confounding.<br /><br />I didn't figure out who the murderer was. However, a good mystery writer provides enough clues for you to ascertain the murderer, and Christie does. The denouement was admitedly much more complicated than I would have expected, but one can still identify the murderer. In retrospect, there were clues I missed and words I misinterpreted. Hopefully, when you read this novel, you won't.yer of mystery. You might expect that as each guest dies, the mystery would simplify, but instead it only becomes more confounding.

B001HN691I|3.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />One prominent notion stood out in my mind after watching \\"Cars 2\\" - it was the Energizer Bunny on speed, steroids, and any other drug that gives you superhuman endurance. From the opening shot where a British spy operative is communicating oil rig coordinates to suave James Bondesque agent Finn McMissile (voice of the ubiquitous Michael Caine) to the last shot in Radiator Springs where Gomer Pylesque tow truck Mater is hailed as a hero, \\"Cars 2\\" hits the ground running (or rather, rolling) and almost never stops. Cars zipping around, racing, diving, skydiving, flying, the movie is seemingly an adrenaline junkie's dream. It was exciting, up to a point, then it eventually became too noisy and tiresome - like, some would say, a Transformers movie.<br /><br />(PLOT SYNOPSIS: on a dare from the boastful Italian Formula One (I guess) race car Francesco Bernoulli (sp?) (John Turturro), superstar racer Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) challenges him to three races in Tokyo, Paris, and London. This secondary plot is just a pretext for McQueen to bring his \\"goofy goober\\" buddy and mechanic Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) along just so Mater can unwittingly blunder into a Bondian \\"Big Oil vs. Alternative Fuel\\" spy caper orchestrated by McMissile and his capable young assistant Holly Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer).)<br /><br />The races and the spy caper both move at Road Runner speed, sometimes parallel, sometimes intersecting where a mysterious villain is eliminating race car participants with an electromagnetic field in a plot to blame their crashes on the alternative ethanol they must use and bolster Big Oil. Yes, I know, it's confusing. Besides the incessant action, you also get meticulously rendered depictions of all three cities and bright, splashy colors (if nothing else, \\"Cars 2\\" is visually enthralling). You also get a depiction of what the world would be like if sentient cars, buses, helicopters, and ships ran it (Example: Cars must remove their wheels to go through airport security). There's a lot to process in the movie. Maybe too much.<br /><br />Again, I call \\"Cars 2\\" Pixar's \\"Transformers\\" movie because it is noisy, busy, stuffed with colorful characters, locations, weapons, and hardware, and sometimes needlessly complex and hard to follow. In spite of all the action and violence which should have received a PG rating, at least),occasionally I found my attention drifting. When Mater eventually deduces that Axelrod (the alternative fuel mogul) and not the German mastermind (Professor Z) is responsible for the race car sabotages, and explains his reasoning, it seemed half-baked and vague. Some Scooby-Doo mysteries have more coherent explanations. If adults could get confused by all this, I would imagine that young children watching \\"Cars 2\\" would get bored and tune out completely.<br /><br />So, did I like the movie? Generally, yes. \\"Cars 2\\" does maintain Pixar's record for producing ambitious, intelligent movies with important morals (in this case, stay true to yourself and never underestimate anyone, even a country bumpkin). However, the frenetic action and labyrinthine Bond plot unfortunately weigh it down. Nevertheless, there is more good stuff than bad stuff to make \\"Cars 2\\" a respectable, if not exceptional, addition to Pixar's canon.<br /><br />P.S.: Actually, it would have been kind of cool to have one of the vehicles be a \\"Transformers\\"-type robot!<br /><br />3.5 stars out of 5.eels to go through airport security).

B004WJRF6C|4.0|Paul McCartney has never gotten enough credit for his experimental side, neither while in the Beatles nor during his four-decade-long solo career. But, as the newly released remastered and expanded editions of his 1970 solo debut McCartney and its follow-up, 1980's McCartney II, unmistakably show, his experimentation is an ongoing feature of his music, along with his flawless melodic flair and penchant for the \\"silly love songs\\" that have made him millions of dollars, helped sell millions of records and earned him the derision of many.<br /><br />In fact, McCartney was initially derided upon release as a half-baked effort that showcased one good song and some tantalizing fragments; when McCartney II came out ten years later, the nasty criticism was even more withering. Now, however, listening to this music in the context of McCartney's eclectic solo career--which includes albums as disparate as the aptly-named Liverpool Sound Collage, his latest Fireman CD, Electric Arguments, and his classical oratorio Ecce cor Meum--one must conclude that, contrary to popular belief, McCartney is anything but a lazy and pampered superstar: rather, he's a restless musician who has always done what he wants, commercial strictures be damned.<br /><br />Both of these albums are homemade affairs, with Paul handling all the instruments and vocals and wife Linda chipping in the odd harmony. While \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" is the obvious stand-out track on McCartney (with that ringingly perfect guitar fill that would do George Harrison proud), the album also includes the scrappy rockers \\"Man We Was Lonely\\" and \\"Oo You,\\" lovely ballads \\"Junk\\" and \\"Every Night,\\" and bizarre, careening instrumentals \\"Momma Miss America\\" and the album's percussive closer, \\"Kreen-Akrore.\\"<br /><br />Thanks Kevin Filipski
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this series, the concept and execution were great. Mocking Jay draws the trilogy to a close and brings Katnisss more deeply into drama danger and politics. We are show in a battle which seemingly puts two side against one another it not always black and while but mostly which is reflected in the uniform of district 13 residents which appears to be the heart of the revolution. I won't give away many details but in this third installment there is plenty of hopelessness loss and despair for Katinss and her companions. It is dark and tragic and at times you I found myself asking did Katniss do any good by taking Prims palace in the Hunger Games or would Prim and Panem been better off if Katniss had just Prim go off to a certain death and kept the rest of the districts children the hope that if they could each just make it through 7 years of reapings they would live in relative safety despite the poverty and control forced upon them by the Capital. In the end we are left with tiny glimmers of hope that while true happiness may be hard to achieve it is at least possible to keep on living despite the harshness of these experience at the hands of oppressors who were obvious and hidden.     I don't really understand some of the critical reviews especially a few criticizing lack of character growth. In a world where 23  children are condemned to a violent death yearly and where Katniss is attacked and used by all sides her ability to cope and fight and live on and stay true to some many people seems more than sufficient development. The Hunger Games definitely shows that books aimed at younger readers do not always have to end blatantly happy and uplifting. Sometimes coping and the hope that things may get better is enough

A few beautiful slow songs, lots of dance music, and a separate bonus CD where she does a few of her bigger hits in spanish (Irreplaceable, etc), with a perfect accent I might add!  Although I am not a big fan of her rap songs (one is done with Jay-Zee)--with such a beautiful voice, why on earth waste it on rap?---there is enough of a variety here, and most of this CD is just awesome to listen to.  I highly recommend it.
B00007LTIC|5.0|This is an amazingly beautiful album by Yes! One of their best albums ever! If you are a music lover and enjoy progressive rock, don't miss it.
B004WOS3P4|4.0|D. Cook has his own sound and a great voice, but every song sounded the same.   It is like listening to one very long song.   Cook sings 3 notes and then blasts a higher or lower note, then 3 more notes and another emphasized loud note.   He could use some songs that have a different format so they don't all sound the same.   As opposed to his last CD, at least his band isn't trying to out shout Cook this time.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|This is another great album by Michael Buble. The cover of Clapton's \\"You are wonderful tonight\\" in duet with the brazilian singer/song writer Ivan Lins is fantastic! Highly recommended to all fans of \\"standards\\" as well as music collectors.
B004UHPU5E|2.0|This has nothing to do with King Crimson. It is boring, tedious and goes nowhere at a snail's pace. I had a hard time getting through one listening and i am a die hard crimhead!
B000008H4E|5.0|This album is absolutely fabulous! One of the best albums ever. If you don't have it on your collection, don't miss it.
B0050CQY1W|3.0|As a Huge Beyonce fan , I Have been looking Forward to this album for a long time .. But upon listening to it a few times its sounds dreary and depressing .. Maybe i just prefer her upbeat dancing music but this is very slow and full of downer love songs .. If that's what you are looking for you will be happy i am sure , but i was looking for uplifting fun Summer dance songs     Fav Tracks : Party f. Andre 3000 and Kanye  and Run the World (I Wish the Album was all like Run the World)      Maybe after awhile this album will grow on me but for Now i am not impressed
B00000GAIW|5.0|Aqualung is by far the best album by Jethro Tull and one of the best rock albums ever. It's a must in any rock fan or music collector.
B004WOS7LO|5.0|I was excited for this album to come out and I was not disappointed!  This album is everything that his debut album should have been and more.  After hearing his first self produced album \\"Analog Heart\\", I was hoping that his first album would have the same feel and it just fell a little short. But, that doesn't mean that I didn't love his first album, I really did!<br /><br />This album is the first album I've ever heard that grabbed me on the first listen.  I loved EVERY SINGLE TRACK which is very rare for any great album, especially when there were 14 tracks on this album! Absolutely no filler on this album.  Buy the deluxe edition, you won't regret it!<br /><br />I was really impatient waiting for this album but now I'm glad it took him this long.  A lot of time and effort went into this album and it shows!
B00007KWHN|5.0|This album is anthologic! One of the best releases by Yes ever. It's a must on any progressive rock collector. Don't miss it.
B0000ADY9I|5.0|Yes without a doubt this is one of the best all time \\"live\\" rock albums. But I don't hear anyone mention what is missing on the album cover ... the Pabst Blue Ribbon cans the band members were originally holding, have been \\"deleted\\" from the new covers.
B004WJRF6C|5.0|I bought this album in vinyl when it was originally released, got the CD version immediately after it's release and still love it every time I listen to it. This is a fantastic album by the great McCartney!<br />Highly recommended to all music lovers!
B0034G4ORC|4.0|In all actuality, BATTLE : LOS ANGELES is a John Wayne war movie with aliens filling in for the commies.  On that level, the movie is a testosterone celebration of the USA and the Marines.<br />The gung-ho bravado of the soldiers and involved civilians is big, loud, frenetic and full of exciting battle scenes and heroic acts.  It captures the viewer right away and in spite of the expected cliches, it is a rousing spectacle.<br />The alien invaders are reminiscent of DISTRICT 9 and SKYLINE.  The actors' roles are limited but they perform admirably especially Aaron Eckhart, Ramon Rodriguez, Bridget Moynahan and Michael Pena.  The jittery camera work is effective and the special effects outstanding.<br />BATTLE LOS ANGELES is a well done action film with a sci-fi twist but is really an Iwo Jima for the new millenium.
B00007KWHP|5.0|This is another great album by Yes. One of the best from their discography. A must to any progressive rock collector.
0307278255|5.0|Unaccustomed Earth is a collection of soulful and rewarding short stories exploring American life from an Indian-American immigrant experience.  They are stories about expectations, family, relationships and children, and of death and grieving.  It is the banality of 20th century America seen through the lens of second generation Bengali- Americans.      Yet, one does not need to be an immigrant to identify with the characters.  Lahiri's stories are often tales of the disappointment and cold reality that life hasn't turned out how one had imagined it would, as if a larger metaphor for the immigrant expectation - do the means justify the ends.    These are stories of children of immigrants now in their thirties often on a lonely journey into adulthood now independent of their roots.  As they become successful adults, they become more American and in doing so less Bengali. They are characters that have come a long way as the children of immigrants only to wonder if now as adults what they seek was what they left behind.

0307279189|5.0|Christopher McDougall takes readers to the bottom of Mexico's Copper Canyons to meet an elusive tribe with super endurance, and then back two million years to the evolution of the endurance running itself.  Along the way he introduces you to a host of colorful characters who compete in the subculture of Ultra Marathoning in the US.     McDougall writes in a captivating narrative that brings to life pulse pounding epic ultra marathons, with vignettes about the heroes, rock stars and villains of the sport over the years, all the while mixing in the exercise science behind it all.      This book combines great story telling, with thought provoking ideas about man's evolutionary relationship with running.  In a thoroughly entertaining way McDougall makes you rethink what you thought you knew about running.
B0056BMK6K|1.0|I had previously a good review on this, but I've since learned Locke bought tons of five star reviews for his books... what kinda bogus tactic is that? And nowhere mentioned in this book... wish I could still get a refund.
B00011KHTM|1.0|The item I received was not working properly. I connected it from my laptop to TV port and it only showed me the red color, and if I play around with it, it changes to yellow, but never better. Anyway, I asked the seller to refund me and they asked me to ship it to them with no shipping fee refund. I refused and asked Amazon to reimburse me, since this item was not working and I don't want to spend money on something which does not work. Amazon refunded immediately and that's why I like it here!
0199551626|2.0|Unfortunately, the material in this book was outdated for the 'offshore' financial jurisdictions, such as the Cayman Islands, BVI, Isle of Man etc, almost all of it pre 2006. Thus the book largely ignores the very important trust developments coming from these jurisdictions though it ambitiously purports to give a world wide view. If you want scholarly treatment of this jurisprudence, you will have to turn to OUP' s other texts, such as the well known Antoine, Trusts and Related Tax Issues in offshore Financial Law. This book offers only cursory treatment of this important subject, but for the treatment of traditional trusts it was ok. I especially liked the information on Italian cases.    J. Harris (Ph.D)
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I'm too lazy to write up a full review...there are plenty of others. I really enjoyed this book and give it 5 stars. I am 30, so it does actually hold some appeal to those beyond the target age group.
B004H74QRK|5.0|I started reading this book series after the tv show on ABC Family ended for the season. In about 2 months I read all the books that were out. It is entertaining, although I wish the series would end instead of having another 3 (books at least) scheduled for release. It is very different from the show but just as good. And the box set is a convenient way to get the first 4 books.

0312427565|5.0|Maybe you've seen the Academy Award winning movie. You might have been elevated by listening to the soaring soundtrack by Bill Conte (of Rocky fame). Now, delve into the details by reading the full account, the revealing back story that precedes the well-known film scenes.<br /><br />A daughter of a World War II aviator, there was no question I wouldn't enjoy this highly applauded 1983 movie with my father. I was a young girl when the space race launched in the early 1960s- but I enjoyed watching a more filled out version of the process that produced our very first astronauts.<br /><br />So much so that I picked up the book that had inspired this true life tale. I'm so glad I did. Much of what Wolfe wrote did not, could not make it into the final film. As it was, it was three-hours, too long to be commercially profitable.  It is a shame. But fans have other alternatives! As good as the film is, the book is astronomically better. (Sorry for the pun, devil made me do it!)<br /><br />Wolfe entertains us with history and America's fixation with heroes. I was most surprised by John Glenn. I had read that the film, released at the same time Glenn was posturing to run for president, somehow hindered his run.  In the film, he came off a bit \\" goody two shoes.\\" He was a good guy, yes. But incredibly brave. Many people do not know he was known as \\"Magnet Ass\\" a moniker he earned and reasons I will leave you to discover on your own.. His story, his pre-astronaut, pre-fame life alone is worth the price of the paperback.<br /><br />Treat yourself to an incredible chapter of our history, and why Tom Wolfe is one of America's finest contemporary writers. The Right Stuff is A Okay...and should be listened to, viewed, and most importantly, read.
B0044XV3R8|1.0|The first thing I noticed was that the box is designed to look like a book. Cool right? Wrong. Each \\"page\\" has a tab that you pull on to get the disc out. The problem with this is that unlike ALL other dvds/blurays, these discs don't hover over plastic; they lay on top of the cardboard box. So upon opening up the brand new movie, I already noticed nasty scratches on every disc.  Secondly, common sense would tell you that if you want a theatrical version and extended version, to put them on separate discs. These guys decided to put both on the same disc, but spread it out over two discs. So whether you're watching the theatrical or extended version, you'll have to change discs halfway through the movie.  Between the scratches that made the movie skip four times the first time I watched it, and the inconvenience of having to get up from my couch to change discs halfway through, I felt I had no choice but to return it. Thankfully,  Amazon ensured me a full refund due to purchasing a \\"defective product.\\"  Hopefully the regular one-disc theatrical version of Avatar will be better.
0307269752|2.0|*Spoiler Alert<br /><br />After all the buzz surrounding this book, I was induced to read it upon hearing it dealt with feminist themes.<br /><br />On this front I was sorely disappointed.  First, the novel inherits the misogynistic style of so many detective thrillers.  I felt forever reminded of how the women look, what they are wearing, and their relative breast sizes.  The male lead, ad nauseam, has women throwing themselves at his head—and they want him so much, to hell with the condom.<br /><br />There is the issue of Lisbeth's rape, which was written cartoonishly on every level.  The fact she returned for documentation (expecting a &#34;lesser&#34; level of abuse) was patently obtuse, and seemed to promote the notion &#34;she's tough enough to take it.&#34;<br /><br />And there is the major plot line.  To me, highly stylized torture of women propelling a dramatic theme hardly advances women's causes.  Women are most often abused by people close to them, and this &#34;psychopath in the basement&#34; cliche diffuses the reality of systemic sexism.<br /><br />Yes, it touches on the fact women's disappearances are under-investigated, with intersections of race and class.  But it is hardly an indictment of the justice system; rather, the novel is shrouded in a mysterious-family-legacy trope.<br /><br />Lastly, as a novel, I found it middle-of-the-line in dramatic arch and character development.  Lisbeth herself is a bit cliched.  And while the book claimed to be critiquing the system that categorized her, it was forever cataloguing her every idiosyncrasy.  I felt I was perpetually seeing her from the outside, a rare specimen held to novelistic light.  Because the author is sympathetic to her, we're somehow supposed to find this less loathsome than the social scrutiny she is subjected to.  But  we are not spared constant reminders of her chest size, or detailed description of her sexual preferences.<br /><br />Whatever he was as a journalist, Stieg Larsson is hardly a progressive novelist.
B004ZH66XO|3.0|it has good controls and good graphics but it is not interesting enough to keep me from playing it. theres better things out there
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I love the book Jane Eyre and had high hopes that this movie would do the book justice.  With the name Masterpiece Theatre and almost four hours of runtime, it had to be amazing.  I was not disappointed.  They stayed within their budget and put out an excelent adaptation.  Sometimes these made for TV movies tend to try to stretch their budget and it comes out cheesy.  Not this time.  I've been watching this movie once a week since I bought it!
B002ZG980U|5.0|This was a very cool film with a great cast. Might be hard for some people to follow because the story is complex, but the action will keep you tuned in. One thing I did not understand is how everone had enhanced abilities like fighting and high speed driving. /i think it had something to do with the ability to influence your dream, but I don't remember them ever really talking about this.
1558908846|4.0|Released in June/95 Judge Dredd starring Sylvester Stallone as the street judge of the future,did a credible job in his role,but the film vacillates between its comic roots and taking its roots much too seriously.It is a fine line,I must admit,but if the film had taken a stronger lean one way or the other I think it would have scored a much higher rating.That is to say though it is  NOT a bad movie as it still stands up very well today.One just has to take the film for what it is and enjoy it;and I still do.<br />The plot involves Earth in the 3rd millennium and the world population is now huddled into mega cities,while all land in between is known as the \\"cursed earth\\" and is for the most part barren.The law in the cities has gone from police alone to a type of police/judge,who arrest,try,judge and execute their own decisions right on the spot.Judge Dredd is well known and he and two other judges become embroiled in a street battle.Dredd takes control and ends up executing all participants,with one judge losing his life in the fight.The remaining judge asks the solitary Dredd if he ever had any friends and he replies only one;and he judged him.<br />One day Dredd is arrested for murder.The guns each judge carry are DNA encoded weapons that work only for that specific judge,as are the bullets fired,which all say they are his and that he did the killing.It is a massive frame up which no one at first can get a handle on.Chief Judge Fargo(Max Von Sydow) is Dredds friend and mentor and to spare Dredds life he does the \\"walk\\" into the cursed earth;the last act of a retiring judge,taking the law where there is none.Dredd later is sent on a transport to a penal colony but it crashes on its way.The perpetrators of the crash are quickly dispatched by Dredd and the Chief Judge Fargo shows up on the scene only to be killed by one of the perps. Before he dies he tells Dredd the real reason he let him live.Dredd and a brother were specially bred years before.Dredd became good and his brother became bad.The man Dredd once considered his only friend and that he judged,was his own brother.<br />His brother Rico(Armand Assante) has been alive all this time in a special prison cell.He breaks out with the help of another Chief Judge Griffin(Jurgen Prochnow)who wants him to create chaos so he can make a myriad of clones to do his bidding.Rico becomes very bold and he subs his DNA for the clones and he has Judge Griffin killed.Dredd meanwhile has come back to the city and hunts his brother down.In a fight to the finish Rico and Dredd struggle at the top of the Statue of Liberty and Dredd sends his brother to his death into the city below(the statue had been moved from the island to the inner city).<br />Dredd is exonerated and is offered the post of a Chief judge.He declines telling everyone he is a street judge,first and foremost.The film ends as Dredd sits atop his motorbike looking over the city he works in.<br />The film moves along quite well and there are a plethora of good actors/acting throughout to make it that much better and more appealing;Max Von Sydow,Jurgen Prochnow nicely play the good judge,bad judge roles,Diane Lane is good as Dredds possible love interest as Judge Hershey,Armand Assante plays a meanly delicious Rico and comedian Rob Schneider pops in to play some laughs against Dredds stone faced demeanor.The S/FX for the mid 90s is also very good and also hold up nicely.Listen for James Earl Jones as the opening narrator.<br />Technically the film has been transferred well into its original 2:35:1 a/r and is clear and crisp.The trailer is the only extra here.<br />Bringing the comic series to life Stallone does a good turn in the title role and he has along alot of good company to help him accomplish that.The film vacillates between the comic side and the more serious and sometimes as a result loses its way,but it is still an enjoyable romp after all these years.Recommended.other became bad.The man Dredd once considered his only friend and that he judged,was his own brother.

B000UZNRS2|3.0|WARNING: Mild Spoilers below    I loved the first 3/4 of this book but then it just got sloppy. My chief complaint is when a family is on the run and being tracked and told \\"don't use any credit cards\\". Kid goes to a store (really? mom would let him do that under life and death situations) and doesn't have enough cash -- so he uses the debit card because really, how big a deal could it be. I find this unrealistic and sloppy to make the plot develop - more absurdity follows that is just over the top.    Otherwise, a very enjoyable read, but I can only suspend my disbelief so much.

0545140323|5.0|I loved this debut novel by Elizabeth Eulberg.<br /><br />Penny Lane is an adorable heroine, and I wish I knew her when I was in high school. The plot itself is very clever, and Eulberg even weaves The Beatles (as well as their music) into side characters in this novel of teen angst.<br /><br />After having her heart-broken one too many times, Penny Lane decides to begin a club for herself, swearing off boys until after high school. As word gets out, other girls begin to share their stories of love-woes, and membership grows. The boys are left scratching their heads as the girls decide to no longer lose themselves in relationships. The only problem...is it truly plausible to swear off guys until after high school, especially when they actually are nice guys?

B0057AOS3I|4.0|Beyonce has grown, merging both the proverbial bad girl and matured woman on her fourth studio album \\"4,\\" released Tuesday. Following the 2008 smash \\"I Am... Sasha Fierce,\\" a Grammy winning, albeit intentionally schizophrenic set packed with ego centric hits like \\"Diva\\" and \\"Ego\\" opposite love-centered ballads like \\"Halo,\\" Beyonce truly lives up to her very words in Allure (2010), stating \\"I don't need Sasha Fierce anymore.\\" On \\"4,\\" an album that seems much more consistent than any of her previous three solo efforts, the former Destiny's Child singer puts \\"Love On Top,\\" instead of hits, throughout, with songs not akin to \\"Single Ladies (Put A Ring On It)\\" - likely because that goal has been accomplished, she's got the ring.     The album kicks off with the sultry, shattering ballad \\"1+1\\". Proving she knows her math, Beyonce evokes emotion that makes an otherwise simple song (simple and sublte lyrics, production) pining with the words \\"make love to me\\" over and over, an irresistable listen. Following \\"1 + 1\\" are two songs, \\"I Care\\" and \\"I Miss You,\\" that will make the uptempo listener question where are the dance tracks ? - they come later, few and far between. While both are solid follow ups to \\"1+1,\\" the stand out is \\"I Care\\". A song that builds and builds and builds, 'I Care\\" finds Beyonce struggling in a relationship telling her significant other, over screeching guitars, \\"I need you to tell me this is love.\\" Raw and emotional, \\"I Care,\\" in all its agony, stands as a genre bending firestarter years after Beyonce belted \\"Ring The Alarm\\". Instead, Beyonce belts \\"I know you don't care too much but, I Still Care\\".     Following \\"I Miss You,\\" which is rather soft and plush, Beyonce picks up her 'fierce' girl-power side on the second single to be released, \\"The Best Thing I Never Had\\". Leading off with the words \\"What Goes Around, Comes Back Around,\\" this song, backed by percussion and a piano building as the track goes on, is solid but not the official 'winning' trackon \\"4\\". That honor, three songs later, goes to the aptly titled \\"Love On Top\\". A throwback to the 80s, if you will, \\"Love On Top\\" finds Beyonce singing about the \\"the one\\" she can always call after years of fighting through tears and \\"real work,\\" finally getting to the point where the other puts love at the top of their list. The irresistable \\"Love On Top\\" follows the summer block party friendly collaboration with Kanye West and Andre 3000, \\"Party,\\" \\"Rather Die Young\\" and \\"Start Over,\\" the latter a solid follow up to the aforementioned \\"I Care\\". Admitting \\"Maybe we've reached the mountain peak and there's no more room left to climb,\\" Beyonce is vocally strong on \\"Start Over\\" as she tells the one she loves to give it another try.     With the words \\"if you leave me you're out of your mind,\\" Beyonce delivers the horn snaring anthem \\"Countdown\\" after \\"Start Over\\" and \\"Love On Top\\". Infectious with lyrics like \\"me and my boo boo, riding\\" and \\"ladies if you love your man show him you the flyest,\\" \\"Countdown\\" revisits the 'Sasha Fierce\\" in Beyonce we've come to know. Not giving up on that 'girl,\\" Beyonce delivers the final uptempo blow with \\"End of Time\\". Also infectious and powerful, \\"End of Time\\" leads off with a near militant instrumental before Beyonce comes in with \\"I will be your baby, promise not to let you go\\". Not to be skipped, \\"End of Time\\" is as much a hit and standout as \\"Love On Top\\".     Beyonce closes out the album, oddly enough, with the lead single \\"Run The World (Girls)\\". Seeming like a track simply thrown in, as it does not fit in well with the rest of the album, \\"Run The World (Girls)\\" follows the Diane Warren penned song \\"I Was Here\\". One that makes you think, \\"I Was Here\\" is akin to other Warren penned songs like \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\"(Whitney Houston).     Overall Beyonce's \\"4\\" stands to be her most consistent album built on the foundation of Love -- puttting it above all else, fighting for it and ultimately keeping it going until the Endof Time. Is it a hit driven album, the answer to that is an obvious no (sans rating).     If you must focus on select tracks, listen to \\"End of Time,\\" \\"Love On Top,\\" \\"Countdown,\\" \\"I Care,\\" \\"1+1,\\" \\"Start Over,\\" and \\"I Was Here\\".

Overall Beyonce's \\"4\\" stands to be her most consistent album built on the foundation of Love -- puttting it above all else, fighting for it and ultimately keeping it going until the End of Time. Is it a hit driven album,the answer to that is an obvious no (sans rating).    If you must focus on select tracks, listen to \\"End of Time,\\" \\"Love On Top,\\" \\"Countdown,\\"  \\"I Care,\\"  \\"1+1,\\" \\"Start Over,\\" and \\"I Was Here\\".
0307716511|5.0|This is a great summer read. Not because it is light and fluffy, quite the opposite, but because it is the kind of book that keeps you up very late at night to finish and it's good to be on vacation and not need to get up for work or to get kids ready for school the next morning. That is how I read it. In one night. Stayed awake til after one am to do so. Something about the way the author constructed the plot and the unfolding revelations kept me turning the pages. The shifting tenses and backwards way of looking forwards ( if that makes sense) was an unusual but effective style.   I realized almost immediately after beginning this book that the blurb on the back and the phrase on the front are misleading. You find out very early on that the fate or location of Bea's sister is not in question. It's the who and why that needs to be revealed. Its a very well done, darkly imagined story with a, for me, unexpected development at the end. I hesitate to cheapen it with the twist label because looking back, clues to that development were laced subtly throughout the narrative and made me really curious to get to the end to find out what she was alluding to. I just didn't expect it to be that.   I don't have a sister, but I can imagine that if I did I'd be calling her today.

B0050CQY1W|4.0|* 1+1 *<br />Beyonce expresses her endless love to Jay-Z, delivers sweeping statements about the power of their relationship and, umm, that's it. I don't think that it's a bad track, it's just a safe, well used formula. Beyonce's vocals are amazing on this though, so it is a nice album opener.<br />I like how the strings and Beyonce's emotive vocals combine together for a passionate delivery, but the most generous about this track I am after a month of repeated listening is to call it 'a grower'. Various reviewers have likened 1 + 1 to Halo, but this doesn't compare to Halo as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />* I Care *<br />This is one of my favourite tracks.<br />Beyonce is saying how she's in a dead-end relationship with someone and how she's trying to work on it, but her partner has clearly stopped caring for her, which is hurting her. She's saying that she still cares for him and can't walk away, despite the writing on the wall. What makes Beyonce's slower songs so powerful is that she can pack the required emotions into her voice.<br />I'm not too sure how to describe the music to songs; so simply put this is a slower track, with soft percussion's. It reminds me of when my parents listened to their Dina Carroll albums when I was young. Most of the album tracks use a similar, vintage soul feel to the music.<br /><br />* I Miss You *<br />Another of my favourites.<br />This is simple but effective; Beyonce is admitting to missing someone, even though it means that she has to swallow her pride to let them know. Beyonce's emotive vocals carry on the heavy, somber tones nicely from the previous track.<br />I don't want to needlessly repeat myself, but, once again this is a slower track, with soft percussion's. Normally I think songs that sound similar shouldn't be placed next to each other, but I Care and I Miss You seem to be a continuing story and they flow nicely together.<br /><br />* Best Thing I Never Had *<br />This is quite a simple track - although the lyrical content is strong. Beyonce tells us that she feels happy to have left someone who did not realise what a good thing he'd had until it was way too late and she had gone.<br />The mid-tempo pop/R&B ballad music is very radio friendly and I can hear echos of Irreplaceable and If I Were a Boy in the musical style. I think that the piano used in the intro and outro lift the song up a level.<br /><br />* Party (featuring Andre 3000) *<br />[Samples the Doug E. Fresh and Slick Rick song La Di Da Di]<br />Both the intro and outro to Party are performed by Kanye West, but his parts don't really add anything to the song; does anyone here know what he means by swagu? Beyonce's verses alone are OK, but nothing special. She's basically telling someone that tonight is THE night, wink wink. It's Andre's rap that gives this song it's life - it doesn't really feel like it's going anywhere, until we get to his verse.<br />We stick with the mid-tempo R&B music for this and, one again, the result is very radio friendly - much more so then the slower tracks [even though the slower songs have stronger lyrics]. This is bound to be on the record label's possible single list.<br /><br />* Rather Die Young *<br />We're back to Beyonce gushing over how much Jay-z means to her. There's much to say here; she'd give up everything for him and she'd also rather die young then go on without him if he were no longer around.<br />The low tempo R&B screams 70's soul to me. This vintage feel does fit fantastically well with Beyonce's raw vocals, making an otherwise average song some spark and raising it up an level. It's middle of the road for me overall: it's above average, but it still doesn't stand out.<br /><br />* Start Over *<br />This is my favourite song on the album.<br />Her relationship is stalling, but she's saying that whilst she's not ready to walk away, she doesn't want to settle for the way things have gone somewhat flat. She instead wants to rebuild things from the base up.<br />We're back to slow soul, with soft percussion's now. Almost all of my favourite tracks have the same musical influence to them - must be the childhood memories they bring to mind influencing me.<br /><br />* Love On Top *<br />Jay-Z makes Beyonce's sunrise, the birds song... Seriously; whilst real love isn't perfect, it's more then worth it seems to be the message on this track. Nothing else to say, but that doesn't mean that isn't a good song, as it is.<br />This would fit perfectly with Dream Girls; I can envision a soul group having a lot of fun with it. The beat picks up and the saxophone in it adds a dollop of attitude to the mix.<br /><br />* Countdown *<br /><br />[Samples the Boyz II Men song Uhh Ahh]<br />The lyrics take little part of other album tracks. The overall message is similar to Love On Top; love is worth riding the waves so to speak. A line in the chorus includes \\"killing me softly\\", a shout-out to The Fugees or a coincidence? Beyonce is vocally more upbeat here then she is on the other album tracks.<br />The mid-tone R&B has strong reggae beats to it, which livens it up and makes it both cheerful and memorable. It seems quite summery, so could make for a nice single.<br /><br />* End Of Time *<br />Another standout track.<br />Beyonce's vocals portray more confidence through to the vocals; she knows that she can give someone everything they could ever need, and it can be all theirs if they admit to wanting and needing it.<br />The music fuses hip hop and classic dancehall styles together and has a strong military march like drum beat running throughout it. It is similar to 'Single Ladies' in that it's nearly impossible to sit still when it's playing; it begs you to get up and dance. The synths in the opening seem to build up into a voice chanting \\"don't f**k with me\\", but maybe that's just my dirty ears.<br /><br />* I Was Here *<br />This one of two tracks that doesn't lyrically fit in with the other album tracks themes of relationships and love. Beyonce is telling use that shes achieved all that she's set out out to do and she has left her mark on the world. It sounds very final to me.<br />Whilst this tracks is a lyrical mismatch on 4, the music ensures that it does still flow with the<br />album neatly - it fuses low tempo, ballady R&b with soul, which makes the song even more somber then it was already.<br /><br />* Run The World (Girls) *<br />[Samples the Major Lazer song Pon de Floor]<br />A assertive female empowerment song, that travels along the same vein as Independent Women, Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It), and Diva. I do like it, but the lyrical content and aggressive vocal delivery does not fit on the album, so it doesn't flow with the other tracks and sticks out of place. No wonder it's the final track on the regular edition of the album.<br />The music is very similar to End Of Time; again fusing hip hop and classic dancehall styles together and again using a military drum beat, which perfectly matches the aggressive vocal delivery. It is also another get-up-and-boogie track. I don't think that it was a good choice for a single, as it doesn't give a taster of the album's material.<br /><br />Ever since I read that Beyonce admitted that she'd handed in 72 songs to her label in preparation for the album's release and that the label bosses call 4 a \\"mixed musical gumbo\\" I'd been expecting a sequel of sorts to the B'Day album: I'd assumed that the individual tracks would be a diverse mix of genres, seemingly random in the topics selected like her second solo album had been. Plus both of the album titles are celebrations of her birthday - I took it as a sign.<br />When I first heard the tracks [they leaked online a month before the album's official release] I was very disappointed; there isn't a nice variety in the musical styles at all, there are a few upbeat R&B mid tempo tracks on here, but most of the tracks are retro soulful ballads. Many fans of Beyonce love her ballads, but I was never ahuge fan of them - after a while they all start to sound the same as she's been with Jay-Z for almost a decade now and whilst it is great that they've lasted and are still deeply in love, there are only so many ways which she can tell tell us that. Isn't there?<br />Well 4 will either convert you into a fan of her ballads with it's superior lyrical content, or it will send you to sleep. It was quite risky for someone who is known for her jelly shaking pop/dance numbers and is a love it or hate it album. To fully appreciate 4 you need to listen to the lyrics - this album's biggest strength is in the song writing, as there are no pop/dance numbers on here. I think that the lack of lighter, fun get-up-and-boogie tracks may result in lower then average sales, will be a crying shame as Beyonce's emotive vocals and ever-growing song writing skills are displayed to their best advantage on 4.<br /><br />Overall: I think that the lyrical content of 4 passes the material passes the level of that on her I Am... Sasha Fierce album. But B'day still nudges ahead for me as my favourite album from her, simply because there is more variation in musical styles.<br />This is also a solid album for those who are fans of the soundtracks for Dream Girls, Cadillac Records and The Fighting Temptations, and/or the Destiny's Child original line-up.this tracks is a lyrical mismatch on 4, the music ensures that it does still flow with the   album neatly - it fuses low tempo, ballady R&b with soul, which makes the song even more somber then it was already.     * Run The World (Girls) *   [Samples the Major Lazer song Pon de Floor]   A assertive female empowerment song, that travels along the same vein as Independent Women, Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It), and Diva.

B0050CQY1W|5.0|1+1- This potential timeless track is the epitome of \\"less is more\\". The lyrics are simple yet effective, and the melody easily plays in your head over & over again. Beyonce's passion for behind the words brings the song alive, in a genuine way, the Dream failed to succeed. 9/10    I Care- From the haunting synch drops at the beginning to her raping the guitar riffs with her vocals, this is easily a highlight from the album & maybe her entire career. It is where she wanted to go with \\"Forever to Bleed\\" but didn't go all the way there... but she WENT THERE with this track. The aggression & conviction give Beyonce the edge displayed in \\"Ring the Alarm,\\" however she took it to the next level! Anyone with relationship experiences should be able to relate. (AM I THE ONLY PERSON WAITING FOR A LESBIAN AFFAIR SHOWDOWN BETWEEN BEY & BIBI DURING A LIVE PERFORMANCE FOR THIS?)  10/10    I Miss You- If Sade, Sinead O' Connor, & Phil Collins had a baby together... this would be the result. A song that could represent those lonely nights Bey has while on tour, or an unwanted breakup. What makes this song special is how mysterious it is... no exact answers to the subject matter. It could be interpreted in so many ways (death of a loved one, distance love, or a break up). Her lower register is the main star of the track, and the syncopated harmonies bring the simple lyrics to life. My favorite track!!!! 20/10    Best Thing I Never Had- This is the `empowering' Beyonce everyone has come to know & love... with a chattering line following the chorus \\"It Sucks to be you right now\\". At first listen, it sounds like a combination of \\"Irreplaceable\\" & \\"Halo\\" with the earthy orchestra. But it really does separates itself from her earlier hits, although it isn't as strong as the rest of the album. 7/10    Party- Door-knocker earrings, Adidas tracksuits, Neon colors are the images I see every time I hear this song. It is reminiscent of the girl groups from early 90s and classic black films like \\"House Party\\" & \\"Do the Right Thing\\". It's hard to not be addicted to the infectious funky sample in the background. 8/10      Rather Die Young- A sexy throwback that reminds me of the Saturday nights in my grandmother's kitchen listening to the Isley Brothers or Earth Wind & Fire. The harmonies, piano, guitar... screams 70s and this is the music era Bey has been obsessed with since her Austin Powers days. 9/10      Start Over- The tribal music in the intro soaks you in like a scene from \\"Pocahontas\\", and her beautiful tone paints pictures of building mountains as she tells her lover to start over. This is a song that can get lost in between its predecessors, but it strong in its own right. The message is self-explanatory & many lovebirds could relate to it. 9/10    Love On Top- This happy Motown inspired number is another main attraction. From the M.J. like vibrato to the modulations near the end as her voice climbs four octaves within the less sixty seconds... this is Beyonce at her best. Telling the world \\"No one is f---ing with my vocals today\\". When I hear this, I am reminded of my mother's love for groups like Blackstreet, After 7, & even the Supremes. And did I hear part of a whistle note near the end?! 10/10    Countdown- I have noticed that this is a highlight for many people. It has hilarious catch phrases, but the song comes off as very corny to me. 8/10    End of Time- One of the most innovative songs I've heard in a long time. The drums & skipping of the beats when she says \\"Say you say you say you love me\\" is reminiscent to the bands on a hot summer day at the Mardis Gras. It makes me want to book a flight to Africa, and even watch M.J's \\"Remember the Times\\". I cannot wait to see a video & live performance for this. 10/10    I Was Here- The sister of her unreleased song \\"Save the Hero\\". This song makes me sad because I don't want to imagine life without Beyonce, just like I'm sure people never wanted to imagine music without Michael, or even Elvis. Cry 9/10      Run the World (Girls)- This is my favorite lead single by Queen Bey. It is the ballsiest song she has ever recorded, and I will never understand why people never quite latched onto it. The message, the beat, the video... everything about this song is AMAZING!!!! I think a year or two from now, people will reflect back on song & feel bad for not initially understanding it. AND THOSE GOD FORSAKEN HARMONIES... *BOWS DOWN* ONLY BEYONCE CAN MAKE AN UPTEMPO ABOUT WOMEN SOUND LIKE A CHURCH CHOIR! 10/10    I give this album an A++ for Bey taking a risk & doing what she wanted to do. And pulling it off!!!

B0045U9WPU|4.0|My thoughts on Delirium..... I had been so eager to read this book, I just KNEW I was gonna love it. Unfortunatly, the beginning of the book was a snore!!! ~Sorry~ I actually stopped reading it at one point and read Divergent instead. However, I did eventually pick it back up and once it picked up I did like it. The end is so heartbreakingly beautiful it left me speachless and a little choked up. I really wanted to give the book a 4.5 but due to the slowness of the beginning I'm not able to.
B004VPAXIY|4.0|Amazon's description of this release states that it is digitally remastered.  I had to do some research and found reviews of this import on the UK version of Amazon.  Many of those reviews complain and warn others that this is NOT a remastered version, only a re-release.  Despite that, this is a wonderful album and my second favorite of her's behind Hounds of Love.  It has the same storytelling song structures and theatrics of her earlier works, but is more experimental in sound than any of her albums.  It so deserves a proper remastering.  I have the original CD release and it sounds flat, very little in dynamics and so I take one star away from my review for that.
B004UQPM4E|5.0|This 8 disc set was amazing when it arrived 1 day early/ ahead of schedule, it even came with a free ticket to go see the new Green Lantern Movie (also by DC) this box set helped me complete my DC/ Superhero Blue Ray collection, the only movie its missing is the 1983 Helen Slater \\"Supergirl\\" which to the best of my knowledge is not out on Blu-Ray yet, but other than that, couldnt be happier!!!
B004Z29WO4|5.0|Hesher is a breath of fresh air for dark indie comedies.  Starring the well-known faces of Joseph Gordon Levitt, Natalie Portman, and Rainn Wilson, I think most indie-film viewers will immediately feel at home.  While being a criminal and a bit of a social deviant, the character of Hesher probably fulfills many of my boyhood dreams of an alternative hero.  I think the little boy inside of me wishes he could one day be Hesher, but I'm pretty sure that'll never happen.  On top of all the Metallica, reckless driving, picking on a little kid, and squatting in a stranger's home - Hesher does one amazing thing.  He forces, and at the same time helps, a family to deal with the loss of a loved one.      It's a great film.  I can't recommend it enough.  I'm really looking forward to the DVD release.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|This novel is pure magic. It is probably better toread this short novel in few intense sittings so that the reader gets the interlocking nature of the narrative although each section or chapter does stand on its own to some degree. It is clear why this novel got so much attention.Do be careful with the &#34;powerpoint&#34; section on the Kindle edition though because it is hard to read but it is possible.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I LOVED Something Blue! When I started reading the book I was not really happy it was about Darcy. But, after much thought and reading I ended up liking Something Blue so much more than Something borrowed. I also thought, while i was reading, there really was no where else to go with Rachel and Dex anyway. They would be boring!! So, I am so glad to have read Darcy's story and thought it was a wonderful \\"Love Story\\" with a wonderful \\"Happy\\" Ending! They are both excellent books and I highly recommend reading them both!

I mean, seriously, wow.  And there really aren't many unusual ingredients, either, so most of the time I can use what's at hand.  Yet, the end result is absolutely mind-blowing amazing.  Vegan scones actually tasting better than non-vegan scones??  Yes.  They were so good I ate almost the entire recipe worth in one day and didn't regret it, they were THAT good.  While I haven't made a ton of recipes yet, they have all been delicious, and like The Vegan Table, I'm sure they will all be incredibly tasty.  After buying a couple of vegan dessert cookbooks and being a little disappointed (some really good recipes, but just as many mediocre ones), I'm thrilled with this cookbook.  Thank you Colleen Patrick-Goudreau for making every recipe delicious and amazing!

B000GCFY0I|3.0|I'd heard about the Uglies series through one of my cousins and while looking for something new to read, I decided to try it out. Set in a dystopian city that is likely way-past-post-nuclear LA/Hollywood, children or \\"littlies\\" are raised with their parents until they reach 11. At this point they become \\"uglies\\" and are sent to some dormitory to live out the next 5 years of their ugly existence on the outskirts of the city. On their 16th birthday, they get to have a massive full body plastic surgery operation that transforms them into a \\"pretty\\". Then they get to go live in New Pretty Town and just party and drink and go nuts.    It's obviously a pretty disgusting concept and something you'd expect from such a superficial city like Hollywood, which is what made me think it was located there. Later books seemed to confirm it.    The protagonist of the story is 15 year-old Tally Youngblood, a girl who can't wait to become pretty, but ends up faced with being ugly forever when her friend gets her into trouble.    Although the book was a page turner, I didn't feel passionate and obsessive about the characters. In fact, I barely cared about any of them at all, which is confusing because I can't really figure out why I read all three books in the series so fast. Perhaps it was the world Scott Westerfield created that kept me captivated. I found Tally to be annoyingly shallow and indecisive and the book was pretty predictable at times. I had a really hard time envisioning the hoverboards, too.    All in all, this was what I would call a great \\"summer beach book\\", but not something that would make me to visit fan sites or go crazy over a movie version.
B003UESJFQ|2.0|Bought for, and watched with, my \\"I love all things Irish\\" girlfriend.  We both concluded the picture was fairly dark, amusing at times, and utimately unsatisfying as the director manipulates the viewer with the surprise ending.  The interconnected storyline was very contrived, good guys (Colin Meaney) as nasty as the bad (Colin Farrell.)  If its clever enough one can watch a movie mostly about losers but this film simply wasn't that clever.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|ODE TO ROLAND EMMERICH, MASTER OF CLICHES: A SYNOPSIS OF A YET-TO-BE SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER<br /><br />Scenes 1-22: THEY HATE OUR FREEDOM.<br />Evil Taliban-looking aliens steal the Bill of Rights and use it to wipe blood off of the handsome face of our commander-in-chief, whom they've kidnapped and beaten. These Taliban-aliens have also destroyed many Protestant churches using explosive-packed mini-vans hijacked from youth-league soccer weekends. In order to save our President and the world from the Taliban-aliens we turn to a retired, alcoholic, Navy fighter pilot who has one good leg, one wooden leg, a tattoo of Reagan on his left arm, and faithfully wears stars-and-bars boxer-shorts. It is an American imperative to reclaim our captured President and the Navy fighter pilot is dutifully coaxed back into uniform by an emotional speech from his old high school basketball coach. This coach, we learn, never had the opportunities that our Navy guy \\"just threw away\\". Under the conditions that the Navy pilot can use his old F4U Corsair and have his pet Dalmatian \\"Dakota\\" ride with him, he will re-enlist and join the forces to rescue the kidnapped President. In these introductory scenes, several new characters are introduced including a gruff top-brass General played by Bobby Knight and an obsequious you-can-do-it middle-brass type, played by Rudy Giulani. The navy pilot's way-too-good-looking ex-wife is also introduced. She has found a new life in suburban Maryland and she is un-ironically married to the old high-school rival of our drunk Navy pilot. A sub-plot develops in which the top-brass General's open-minded children befriend an illiterate Native American janitor much to the chagrin of their skeptical parents.<br /><br />Scenes 22-28: BUILD-UP TO BATTLE.<br />Troops have been rallied to rescue the President. A speech is given by the gruff top-brass General on the deck of the USS World Trade Center. Prior to this speech, the General has a heart-to-heart with the illiterate Native American janitor at the urgings of the General's children. This heart-to-heart takes place on the porch-swing of the General's home in a suburban neighborhood where they filmed The Truman Show. During their chat the Native American imparts the following aphorism: \\"the female rattler may hound the bear, but it cannot bear hounds.\\" The General seems to understand this wisdom, and he even metaphorically incorporates this image into his rallying-speech to the troops. During the General's speech our alcoholic Navy pilot is having a lapse of confidence. He is below deck looking vulnerable. Eventually he is consoled and then ignited into action by a passionate speech from his way-too-good-looking ex-wife, played by Holly Hunter who overuses her southern accent for dramatic purposes. She implores him to \\"regain that Bulldog spirit\\" in reference to their mutual High School Mascot from back in the day when they used to steal kisses underneath the bleachers.<br /><br />Scenes 29-34: THE FINAL HOUR.<br />A massive air-battle is occurring in the vicinity of the alien mothership. Numerous pilot-heroes are shot down, including a charismatic overweight pilot whose jowls ripple as his damaged plane plunges toward the ocean. Our fearless Navy pilot is not phased by all this death around him--he has seen this before. He listens to Brooks & Dunn as he flies his old Corsair towards the alien-Taliban mothership. \\"Dakota\\" sits on his lap. As the Corsair makes its way toward the alien-Taliban mothership, a likeable black man, who in times of peace lives in a white neighborhood and drives a Ford Taurus, flies a fighter jet next to the Corsair radioing trite contrivances such as \\"you da man\\" to our Navy alcoholic pilot. The navy pilot lands his corsair inside the deck of the alien-Taliban mothership and finds the supreme evil alien-Taliban leader seated on a throne manufactured in mainland China. The throne is made out of discarded UAW membership cards and tainted baby formula that has been hardened from the heat emanating from a burning pile of Springsteen CDs. This evil-Taliban-alien leader has four arms and a black mustache made out of shredded voting ballots and ground-up White House pets. The menacing Taliban-alien-leader smiles as he snacks on a bowl of children who were denied after-school prayer. Prior to the impending battle the navy pilot takes out a heart-shaped locket with a photo of his estranged daughter who was tragically killed while trying to gain entry into Princeton. He gazes at the photo for way too long and says \\"this one's for you babe\\". He wipes a tear from his eye, clenches his fist anew, and then with dramatic urgency, swallows the locket, washing it down with a Diet Coke. [During this scene, a maudlin rock-ballad plays. It is being sung by a super-group formed especially for this movie; the super-group consists of Elton John, Steven Tyler and Derek Jeter.] The song ends and the navy pilot becomes full of rage and stares at the evil-Taliban-alien-leader. The Taliban-alien smiles and his skin turns even more brown, signifying a disdain for the nuclear family and baseball. The Reagan-loving Navy pilot strips down to his stars-and-bars boxer shorts, cursing under his breath. Bits and pieces from the high school basketball coach's rallying speech echo in his head.

This evil-Taliban-alien leader has four arms and a black mustache made out of shredded voting ballots and ground-up White House pets. The menacing Taliban-alien-leader smiles as he snacks on a bowl of children who were denied after-school prayer. Prior to the impending battle the navy pilot takes out a heart-shaped locket with a photo of his estranged daughter who was tragically killed while trying to gain entry into Princeton. He gazes at the photo for way too long and says \\"this one's for you babe\\". He wipes a tear from his eye, clenches his fist anew, and then with dramatic urgency, swallows the locket, washing it down with a Diet Coke. [During this scene, a maudlin rock-ballad plays. It is being sung by a super-group formed especially for this movie; the super-group consists of Elton John, Steven Tyler and Derek Jeter.] The song ends and the navy pilot becomes full of rage and stares at the evil-Taliban-alien-leader. The Taliban-alien smiles and his skin turns even more brown, signifying a disdain for the nuclear family and baseball.

B0050CQY1W|5.0|This album showcases amazing balladry while also illustrating Beyoncé's softer, vulnerable and more mature side. There is no way that this album is valued at anything less than a five or four star because it is close to flawless. It is definitely worth buying and the deluxe version at Target gives you even me more songs!
B000001FQQ|4.0|I always like kiss back with there makeup in the 70`s. but in the late 80`s the makeup came off and the song`s was not as good.BUT HOT IN THE SHADE is a great cd .HIDE YOUR HEART AND SILVER SPOON is a blast!! for the money buy this cd!! IT`S GOOOOD.THANK YOU.
B000085RTX|3.0|Not bad, but definitely not one of my favorites by them.  Still, no regrets purchasing it -it's a good listen.
B004SGWYVA|5.0|I was a skeptic. But people who had seen the show had decent things to say about it. I recieved it yesterday and watched the entire season in one sitting (with a break to walk the dog). Afterwards I have to say, WHERE IS SEASON 2!! This was a great series. It truly developed the characters and you started liking/disliking them because of their traits. Yes it is anime, but it tackled the idea of zombie apocalypse quite \\"realistically\\" (so to speak) in the terms of how it would spread and how society would change in a heartbeat. Do you only look out for yourself or do you put your neck on the line to save a stranger from death? Would you kill the weaker, to ensure your own survival? Are you capable of killing or has it been something deeply woven into you that you feared what would happen if it came out?     None of the characters are exactly alike. Some of them are just there for laughs(Nurse Megamammory) who even responds to the question of why she's so ditzy by stating it's how she was written. It doesn't take itself so seriously, there are laugh out loud moments, and OMG REALLY!?!?!?! moments. The combat is great, voice acting was remarkable given some of the horrible voice overs lately.     The one thing that I wanted to do though was beat them for always yelling, its like HELLO ZOMBIES CAN HEAR YOU, SHUT UP lol. Super glad I bought this series as it is one to watch several times over. Zombie destruction day marathons FTW!     I truly hope they come out with a season 2 because this is one series to follow. I fear like most of the anime I end up loving it will be a one season wonder to only be lived out in the imagination of it's true fans.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|**** May be mini spoilers below ****<br /><br />I realized a few minutes into this movie that my family and I really had no clue what it was about.  But, I am really glad we went to see it.  The movie is really about a government secrete that comes back to bite this town in the ass.  There is a train that is transporting cretin items.  They have to do with something that government got and did in the late 50s early 60s.  These kids are making a movie for some sort of festival.  They are right by some train tracks.  One boy sees a car go on the tracks, in front of the train.  The train crashes and these things are exposed.  One of the boys takes one of the items.  Soon after things in the town start getting weird.  The power keeps blinking out, the animals run away and people start to die and or go missing.  It may sound simple and it actually is.  Which makes the movie so great.<br /><br />The graphics and or 3D effects look amazing.  But the great thing is, they did do it TO many times.  Even the creatures that come to do what they come to do are mysterious.  You do get to see them, BUT, it seems like every time you see one, you only see a part of it, or there is a lot of smoke or something else around to impair your vision of the creature.  They could have over did the things.  Making you see the entire thing over and over and over again.  The fact that they did not, makes the movie even better.  You really get the feeling that your watching a movie from the 70s or 80s when you are watching the film.  It had a very E.T. feel.  Also, the kids in the movie are amazing.  When I looked them up on IMDB, I was shocked at their ages.  Some amazing acting by great actors.  They really made the movie.  When you leave the theater or turn the TV off you will have a lot of answers.  But it may even put a few questions in your mind as well.  I am really excited about getting this on blu ray when it is released.  I will get to share it with my whole family.<br /><br />One last thing.  I am 26 and this movie really made me feel like I was 8 years old.  I felt the same way I did when I walked out of E.T.  Go see the movie.  It will make you feel great.movie really made me feel like I was 8 years old.  I felt the same way I did when I walked out of E.T.  Go see the movie.  It will make you feel great.
B0050LJIRK|5.0|YOU DON'T HAVE TO 'LOVE' FRED DURST TO LIKE THIS ALBUM! Still, he has a way with words that is impressive (if not often juvenile), but also shows a completely different side of himself on this album (real singing!!) Nevertheless, if you must, take Fred out of the equation, and you have a band that absolutely rips, with a guitarist who rivals Tom Morello in screeching, wailing guitar histrionics, and some of the heaviest riffs I've heard in years. Borland, as always, is the real star of the show in this band, and in strictly musical terms (and I still like listening to Durst, but for those who don't....) this is a crushing album for the most part, but surprisingly mature and inventive on the other side - just what I had hoped for with a 'reunited' Bizkit!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I recently got an iphone 4 in white so I wanted something simple since the phone itself is already beautiful, but of course needs protection. For 8 bucks this is a great case, easy to put on & just fits perfect. I also used the screen protector that came with it and it was a sinch to put on, once the screen protector is on you can't even tell it's there, it does not effect the screen at all. I also am not crazy about the amazon logo in the back but I can't say it bugs me either, just kinda wish it wasn't there. I happen to like the swirl pattern in the back, I don't find it to be loud at all, it gives the case a little something extra actually. I'm the type of person that goes through cases like there's no tomorrow and I can honestly say this one is my favorite, you can't go wrong with this case.
0765365278|5.0|The other reviews say it all.  The only problem is that the 2nd book in the series is not out yet- and given that there will be 10 books in the series, it will be decades before the series is complete.
B001DF68MA|5.0|I purchased this product along with a bike for my husband's birthday June 2011. We have a 16 month old son. I couldn't tell who was having more fun.  The seat was easy to assemble and compatible with the bike I purchased. My son fit into the seat well. He is about 21 pounds and tall.  I would recommend this product.  It arrived very quickly.
B003N5VOUO|5.0|Do not pay attention to the 1-star reviews. All movies are fiction even the ones that claim to be based on real life stories. This one tells a beautiful story in the tragic times after 9/11. Yes, the Mama Jennie part seemed a little time warped to those in metro areas but don't think there aren't any areas of the south similar to that. There was also a comment about the Wilhemina scene with helicopters to get the media shots but no rescue helicopters. Apparently, that person didn't see the real life Hurricane Katrina coverage in New Orleans. This is a great story of our time and should be shared with all. It has profound lessons just like some would think the Wizard of Oz does. I think even more so.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|Hi. Just received this converter. Glad I found it before buying any other one. It has a superior look and finish compared to other similar products. On paper, 24bit/192KHz operation, snr >90dB at only $30, this is unbeatable specs/price ratio. I don't think there is any better product for that price over there.    I have just checked all my sound sources with it (Media Center PC audio sources, Blu-Ray movies, etc, Cable Box) from a LG LED TV optical out to stereo wireless headphones, and everything runs ok. I know it does not decode Dolby so I had previously configured my digital sources to PCM, stereo or whatever option was available.    LG, as well as other TV manufacturers, for any obscure reason, they seem to have decided not to provide RCA stereo outputs anymore. Furthermore my TV has a minijack for headphones on rear panel that mutes the TV speakers as soon as you plug or leave something plugged into it. They must think they are so 'intelligent' those TV chip designers that they decide for me what do I have to hear and how. So now, many people including myself, is forced to search for a solution if their stupid decisions do not suit our needs, and I ended up looking for audio converters.    The device looks pretty well finished, exactly as you expect from the pictures or even better, very nice. I have not noticed any kind of background noise as other reviewers post for similar products, neither with nor whitout TV sound.    The only thing where you notice the typical 'Made in China' quality perception is by reading its poorly written tiny User Manual, but on the positive side, you can get some laughs with it as well.    It is too early to tell about reliability. Other similar devices seems to die after certain periods of use, as reviewers say. We'll see. I will update this review if I encounter any problem.
B0012GMV4O|5.0|As a 22 year old guitarist, I have to admit that I didn't think much of this style of rock before listening to this album.  I had my faves from this period no doubt: Joe Walsh/James Gang, Deep Purple, Eric Clapton etc...  I kinda considered it to be \\"junk rock,\\" where the music was too self-indulgent and lacked creativity from their 60's predecessors (i.e. Hendrix, Santana, Cream, The Byrds, Buffalo Springfield, The Beach Boys even, you get the point).  However, I stumbled upon this group after noticing that this band played Woodstock and the closing of the Fillmore East in 1971.  This peaked my curiosity when I saw that Felix Pappalardi was their bassist, the producer who collaborated with Cream.        Here's where my impressions set in.  I'm a purist guitarist favoring a high-watt clean tube amp and a well-built telecaster or Les Paul Standard to achieve the sounds of B.B. King, Mike Bloomfield, Santana, Steve Cropper and early Eric Clapton.  I wasn't a fan of using effects or any tricks, that is, until I heard this album.  I instantly heard where Joe Satriani and a lot of other groups/guitarists got their sound and chops and it is straight from Leslie West.  I was completely blown away by this album and the great hooks on songs like \\"Mississippi Queen,\\" \\"Theme for an Imaginary Western,\\" \\"Never in My Life,' \\"Sitting on a Rainbow,\\" and others on this album.  I've learned after listening to this album that clever rock and pop can be created by over-driven guitars and bass in a very pleasing manner.  To put it simply, this album changed my entire perspective on Early 70's rock and boogie and I highly recommend it to anyone who gives a damn about rock n' roll.
B000FC130E|5.0|one of the greatest books i've ever read in the fantasy realm...and one of the scariest. creepy, in a literate way, dark/goth in a literate way.... each step into the underground is a haunted step; you can almost hear the rustling of rats and the drip of sewer water in the background, as the fantastic and unique characters interact with each other.     i am a huge fan of neil gaiman; i have read all of his books. this is not a beach book- it is extremely well written, but not the easiest book to \\"get\\". and it does not lend itself well to half hearted attention. it's very rewarding, it's completely unique, as all of his books are. and it is unforgettable......     .....perhaps i might have wished some of the characters were forgettable, but there are 2 here that i cannot forget....not so good on a dark and stormy night. you may need a night light! that's ok, dig into this book, and experience the genius of neil gaiman. oh, and get out your wallet- you'll be buying all of his books after this one. don't say i didn't warn you.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|This is a great movie for all ages. My wife and I watched this movie with no kids and still found it very entertaining. I would recommend this movie to anyone that's looking for a light-hearted, funny movie to simply kick back and let it entertain you.

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|The Foo Fighters have always been an enigma to me; One of America's finest rock bands, featuring one of the world's best rock drummers 9and allegedly one of the nicest guys in rock and roll), but plagued by inconsistent writing and often albums to similar to each other to really stand out. Their last studio album, \\"Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace\\" seemed to address the issue by tweaking things texturally, but I think Dave Grohl may have gotten a shot in the arm after hanging out with Them Crooked Vultures and Queens of The Stone Age. \\"Wasting Light\\" sounds like a bandwide epiphany, a Foo Fighters album that rocks and rocks hard, along with their most fully consistent set of songs since the breakout \\"The Colour and The Shape.\\"<br /><br />\\"Wasting Light\\" is a big guitar album, be it the jittery start (Beastie Boys' \\"Sabotage,\\" anyone?) on \\"Bridge Burning\\" or the stuttering echo of the initial single, \\"Rope.\\" And despite opening the album with a song titled \\"Bridge Burning,\\" much of \\"Wasting Light\\" sounds like that's exactly like what the Foos are doing. It's a stunner to hear Grohl sing in a world weary voice (on \\"These Days\\") lyrics about trying to get over past pains, then suddenly breaking into a roar of protest.<br /><br />\\"Easy for you to say!<br />Your heart has never been broken,<br />your pride has never been stolen.<br />Not yet, not yet!\\"<br /><br />Elsewhere, old friends are kicking in. Pat Smear comes back for the first time since TC&TS, Husker Du and soulmate Bob Mould adds a convincing snarl on \\"Dear Rosemary,\\" and even old Nirvana band-buddy Krist Novoselic brings his bass out of retirement for \\"I Should Have Known.\\" That particular song just happens to be the most contemplative number on \\"Wasting Light,\\" as if Grohl and Krist were saving their collective empathy for all this time. The same is not true for \\"White Limo,\\" a screaming, distorted punker. Even with all the guest shots and shifting sounds, \\"Wasting Light\\" sounds like a band in full-cohesion. if you don't get the chills from listening to \\"Walk,\\" where the band tears through a personal rebuilding process that hits a climax with Grohl repeatedly shouting \\"I Never Wanna Die!\\" before concluding \\"I'm learning to walk again, I believe I've waited long enough.\\"<br /><br />\\"Wasting Light\\" is loaded with that kind of rock and roll redemptive spirit. Easily one of 2011's best, if not the best rocking album of the year.istening to \\"Walk,\\" where the band tears through a personal rebuilding process that hits a climax with Grohl repeatedly shouting \\"I Never Wanna Die!\\" before concluding \\"I'm learning to walk again, I believe I've waited long enough.\\"    \\"Wasting Light\\" is loaded with that kind of rock and roll redemptive spirit.

B004XWMXX8|5.0|I recieved the album today and its Selena's best album. All the songs are lovely. My favorite is My Dilemma. I recomend this album to everyone no matter what age you are. I can tell she worked really hard on it. Her previews albums were okay, but this one is amazing.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Disney's Beauty and the Beast is a \\"Jewel\\"! The DVD set has something for everyone! I have bought three copies! My first copy for a young lady overseas learning english. This edition has the lyrics to the songs in three different languages. Great if you want to learn the words to the songs. It also has the story of how they made the film for the adults. Beautiful music,wonderful animation and classic story where can you find the \\"perfect\\" gift for such a small price? In these difficult financial times this is a wonderful gift! The second dvd set goes to my niece's daughter for her birthday. The third set??? Why it is mine! I had to have one for myself. No one ever out grows the wonder and magic of the way \\"Disney\\" tells a story! If you haven't seen it you are missing something sweet and wonderful!!!!!!!!!
B004XWMXX8|5.0|I just bought this album because I had her previous two, the singles didn't convince me at all. But I'm glad I bought this. From the second you open the box, you know you are in for a blast. The photos in the booklet are amazing and creative. and the fact that the CD looks like a vinyl is hilarious.<br />Then the music is outstanding. Selena explores several styles and themes in her songs going from love to hate to a night out partying. Her voice sound incredibly better than her last album. This is absolutely Selena's best album to date.

B004HZ76FQ|3.0|Maybe because i've never done any deep water fishing i'm not sure i understand the concept of pulling on the line to \\"increase the hook strength\\" as the tutorial puts it. Also since i hooked some way expensive fish in the first three rounds, i splurged first on a $1,500 lure and then a $3,000 lure, and while it's neat to have that kind of money invested in my tackle box, the $3k lure doesn't seem to do a whole lot better than the cheaper ones, or even the free default ones. Finally, it may just be me but even with practice it doesn't seem to respond well to subtle movements and therefore encourages some pretty violent \\"pulling\\" on the phone.<br /><br />Nit-picking aside, it is a fun and immersive game. I'd just like it to be a bit more responsive to the sensor so i'm not so afraid of throwing my $400 phone over my shoulder and bouncing it off the wall.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|This is what the built in calendar with Android should have been. This calendar lets you easily sync your phone, google account, facebook and even with a friend's google calendar!<br /><br />Each separate calendar shows as a tab below the calendar, so you can instantly turn on and off each calendar's events that you are looking at! You can turn them all off, all on, or one at at time.<br /><br />You can also easily edit any of your events- something that is very difficult to do with the built in calendar.<br /><br />Give this one a try. One piece of advice...make sure all the accounts you want on the calendar are already on your phone. The calendar seems to have trouble adding new accounts after its installed. In my case, when I added facebook, I needed to reinstall the calendar to get it to show up. Still, a minor complaint.<br /><br />Overall, this is highly recommended!!

It takes place in soviet Russia and catches you from the begining check it out, I want it for my kindle too!
B003Y5H54W|3.0|This movie could have been so much better. However, I did watch it without any grat expectation. The trailers looked intriguing and I thought the retelling of Little Red Riding Hood might lead to a good plot. Unfortunately, I found the tale to be below average. The accusations that this is simply another Twilight movie I cannot substantiate. I have never seen the Twilight movies although I have been told about thenm. From what I've heard they took liberties with the vampire myth that does not necessarily happen in Red Riding Hood. However, if you are expecting Howling type transformations--forget about it. There are no special-effect scnes like that, in fact, the werewolf simply looks lik, well--e a wolf.<br /><br />I was surprised that Gary Oldman took this role. I would also like to know how much they paid him to do so. He has had far better roles than this that I can't believe he lowered himself to do such a sub-par film. His talents so go beyond a film like this. The sets have a Tim Burton look to them, but not quite as over-the-top. The actors are fair, but then again this wasn't meant to be a drama but a thriller, although, I was never really \\"thrilled.\\" There is a sub-plot which misleads you as to who the werewolf really is, Unfortunately, by the time we find out, we don't care anymore than you really care about how the movie ends.<br /><br />Be that as it may, it is probably worth a watch, but don't expect any surprises. They had an opportunity to do something really good with this but the writing simply falls short. This could have been a dark, brooding, even haunting film that could have made you jump out of your skin, but it is little more than eye candy and I only say that because of the sets. The Three Little Pigs would have lent itself to a more nightmarish spectacle.  If anything, I feel for all the actors who had such weak material to work with, especially Gary Oldman, and I hope to see him in something better than this fluff soon.<br />We still love you Gary.

B0034G4OXQ|2.0|Hereafter scream Oscar bait, every character you meet is tragic, the director was obviously afraid color would kill the viewer for all is somber and dull, and the story moves very, very, very slooooooooooowwwwwwwwly. Hereafter is three stories woven into one movie, one storyline follows a depressed former psychic who is trying to put his days as a professional medium behind him as he do not want to live with death anymore, however there are always pepole with sad stories showing up and asking for readings, the second story follows a news reporter who barely survived the Asian Tsunami and is haunted by her near death experience, the third storyline follows the young son of a drug addict who lost his twin brother in a car accident and who in turn becomes obsessed with death. Each of the main characters becomes involved with death in their own way and try to figure out more about the hereafter.<br /><br />Min main problem with this story is that it tries the wrench tears from you, however since every, single character in the movie is so tragic it get ridiculous other than sad, everyone had either suffered a great loss, has been raped, have lost their siblings, are drug addicts, are depressed or in other ways their lives suck, the movie stand and screams look at all this tragedy, give me tears and give me an Oscar! Fortunately the Oscars did not bite and neither did I.<br /><br />All in all this movie have a near concept, and under all the tears and grime and depression it haves some good moments, the problem with Hereafter is that it tries way, way to hard, also for a over two hours movie it get very boring as it is just way to slow. The concept of three pepole who have each been touched by death in their own ways who are seeking what lies beyond is interesting and is what made me buy the movie in the first place, however why do every single character have to be tragic, the stories of the three main ones drown in unnecessary emo drama and what would have been a great speculation on life after death turn into an uninspiring, depressive tear wrencher.fe after death turn into an uninspiring, depressive tear wrencher.

B000EBD9TY|5.0|I have tried quite a bit of classics by buying them off of Amazon.Com.  And each time I go to look for a D.V.D. which I watched somewhere else like a classic that you cannot find in the store, Amazon. Com has them, because they make them especially for you the customer, and although they are hard to find inside of the store, Amazon. Com has them at a good, fair, reasonable price, giving you the opportunity to stock up when you can.  You just need to have access to a computer and a mailbox.  And if you do not like it, you just need to mail it back within 30 days of getting it shipped, and you will get the cost of the D.V.D back.  I am 35 years old and like classic 1950's movies and I have gotten a couple from them, so I do not know what I would do without Amazon. Com.  They are amazing. Knupper 1
B0033QC0WO|5.0|I personally find this set to be incredibly rewarding to listen to.<br /><br />At this price you can't go wrong, because you get the entirety of Chopin's solo piano works across 13 discs.  If I remember correctly, Ohlsson's set is well over $100, whereas this is just over $50.  If you also buy Artur Rubinstein's \\"Chopin Collection\\" on RCA Victor, which is $20, then you have acquired 24 discs worth of Chopin, and about 99% of the man's works.  Rubinstein's set has all the major piano-orchestral works that Ashkenazy's does not: the Andante Spianato (although it is solo piano, it's part of another work that is for Piano and Orchestra.  This is a solo piano work set.) and Grand Polonaise Brilliante, and the piano concerti.  If you buy both sets, you've still spent $30 less for two than if you spent the $100 on Ohlsson.<br /><br />In regards to sound quality, I have not noticed a metallic sounding recording.  I believe that the piano is recorded well, and the sound quality is also fine.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this.  A genuine bargain.

The lowest setting was perfect for lighting small areas for a very long time.  I am very impressed with the quality of this light.

From page one I was sucked into Lena's world, which Oliver describes so vividly.    At age 18, boys and girls are administered \\"the cure\\" to prevent them from catching the disease. Lena, a product of her environment, has looked forward to the day when she can finally be immune to love. She keeps a countdown to the big day when she can at last get her \\"procedure\\" done. That all changes when an unexpected turn of events cause her to become \\"infected\\" a few weeks before her surgery.    At first glance, Delirium may seem like a cheesy, predictable love story, but it is so much more than that. Oliver delivers an absolutely beautiful narrative on the power of love and the meaningless of life in its absence. Not just romantic love, but familial love and friendship. Delirium is heartwarming but at the same time it is also excruciatingly heartbreaking.    The bottom line is simply that Lauren Oliver is a fantastic writer. Delirium left me soaring for days. I am already counting down the days til the sequel gets released.

B0030U1TLQ|2.0|Disintegration is one of the best albums ever composed, period! This review and rating is specifically directed at this 3 CD set, not the album itself. The album itself is a perfect 10.     The remaster of Disintegration sounds great whether played on an mp3 player or high quality CD player and sound system. The songs have a little bit more power and \\"oomph\\" to them. The difference from the original album isn't too drastic though and it really didn't need to be. The original album was already fantastic, so not much needed to be changed. The rarities disc was fantastic as well. I really enjoyed the instrumental demos for Lovesong, Disintegration, Pictures of You, and other tracks. The inclusion of an unreleased version of Babble was an excellent addition as well. The rarities disc is really the main highlight of this collection.    Now for the major negative...    Entreat Plus is CRAP! It is barely listenable. At first I thought my headphones were actually broken because it sounded like I wasn't getting any stereo feedback. After playing a few songs from other albums, I realized my headphones were perfectly fine. After searching google for half an hour, I've come to learn that this problem is inherent to the album itself. Whomever remixed Entreat Plus did a shoddy job! It sounds very flat without any musical dynamics whatsoever. When turning up the volume, it almost sounds like a low level static pervades over the entire album. When comparing the song Disintegration from the original Entreat to Entreat Plus, I discovered that all the various instrumentals were remixed to almost the same volume level. Who the hell decided to do that? In any live performance there will be certain instruments that sound louder than other instruments and that have more impact or other unique musical qualities. That is what makes a live performance truly great! Whomever remixed this album apparently decided that it was better to edit the instrumentals and vocals so they all sound like oneuniform continuous stream, which is probably the reason why Entreat Plus sounds mono instead of stereo. All in all, Entreat Plus is a musical abomination. I have to wonder whether the task of remixing this album was given to a deaf man? It sure seems like it.    If the original, unmolested tracks from Entreat had been included, along with the 4 extra tracks (Unmolested), then this entire package would be 5 stars. But since the remix of Entreat Plus is so poor, I had to deduct 3 entire stars! Yes it really is that bad. This should be a lesson for those recording companies and artists who want to go back and remaster or remix their older music. Pay attention to what the hell you're doing! And maybe have a small test group of fans listen to the remix or remaster before it is released, as a form of quality control.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This was a complete surprise for me because I'm annoyingly particular about contemporary romance. But Beautiful Disaster drew me in like a drug. Jamie McGuire is a seriously addictive writer. I don't know what it is she has, but it's the kind of magic that compels you to read on after every chapter. Beautiful Disaster is an epic love story told over the course of a year, about two people, Abby and Travis, who become friends and are unwillingly drawn into a volatile and passionate love affair. I loved these characters; I enjoyed how McGuire didn't give everything away about Abby; she developed as a character and we discovered who she was in pace with Travis. As for Travis, he's seriously hot, and yes, like Abby, a little damaged - hence the volatility. However, despite their drama and their freak outs, I couldn't help but cheer them on, desperate for them to have their HEA.   You'll have to pick this one up to discover if they did.     Fantastic Read.

B0050CQY1W|4.0|I love and still listen to Dangerously In Love.  Beyonce lost me with B'Day and I am..Sasha Fierce. They were just too pop mainstream for me and it felt like she was just making albums to put something on the shelf. I felt they were lazy and she knew people would support her anyway because she had such a loyal fan base. But I must say I like this new album alot. It has alot of ballads and nice melodic songs. Not as soulful as Dangerously In Love and Not a lot of club bangers like B'Day. You can definitely tell she's 30, not 20 on this album. Her voice has matured and so has she. The lyrics are simple but you 'get it'. My favorites are Party (oh Kanye you rocked it)and I Care (vocals are beautiful). My least favorite are Run the World and 1+1. This album is 'safe' but it's good music and that's really all that matters.

0375703764|5.0|House of Leaves is both a phenomenal literary feat, and an artistic masterpiece.  In this novel, Mark Z. Danieleweski tells a haunting tell of love, loss, and darkness.  This story alternates between the narrative of Johnny truant, and a text called the Navidson Record, a book that analyzes a film that does not exist, even in the world of the novel.  The book contains numerous footnotes, some of which reference works that do not exist.  Danielewski uses typography to convey different emotions throughout the text.  Reading this book is more than just a passive activity, it is an experience.  Probably one of the best things about this book is that it means different things for different people.   Where one person sees a horror story, another will see a satire, or a love story.  House of Leaves is a must read for anyone who wants to be immersed in a book.
B002RI90WM|5.0|Enzo ! what a novel.. after this book, am so happy to know that dogs know ! I always had dogs in my life, and there are always those moments when you say \\" I can swear this dog understands what am saying\\" or \\"if he only had a voice he would talk\\".. I loved every moment reading this book.. am planning to re-read it again to write down the outstanding sentences.. the book was full of them.     Good job.. and hope we can read more of such uplifting stories.. real down to earth.. about normal people.. no military conspiracy or a political plot.. just normal people with a loving dog !    A story you will never regret reading ! and do not be shy.. read it again.. its worth it !
B001AQT0OU|4.0|There are parts of the Blu-ray of \\"2001\\" that flicker (closeups of HAL's eye) and have splotches; plus, the transfer technology has gotten better, so I wish a new version of that were done.  I know \\"Barry Lyndon\\" was harder to clean up because every edit on the VHS version had a slightly crooked 1st frame and the isolated dialogue had a lot of hiss, so it had to be faded up and down whenever anyone started and stopped speaking for most scenes, which shows Kubrick was a perfectionist at most things but not all.  These distractions have been fantastically corrected for the Blu-ray version, and since the film is 3 hours long, I'd guess this was one of the main reasons for its delayed release.  The only oddity is Warner Bros. selfishly replaced the VERY dramatic opening red and black animated WB logo with a dull, static black and white one, so they could add \\"A Time Warner Company\\" at the bottom.

B0041KKYBK|1.0|This film casts George Soros and Barney Frank as glowing beacons of wisdom. That should be a serious concern, even for the casual viewer. That fact that our government forced banks to make mortgage loans to people that could never pay them is totally ignored. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were instrumental in creating the housing bubble, but that is glossed over with the constant \\"greed is evil\\" mantra that the film is constantly harping on. Yes, the banks were complicit, but that's only a part of the story. Other reviewers have enumerated the huge flaws in the film very well, unfortunately, they are in the minority here. Overall, the film gives a distorted, and leftist view of what actually occurred.

B0050CQY1W|3.0|There is no question that the past few years in the music scene has mainly been about 3 divas, Lady Gaga, Rihanna, and Beyonce'. But when it has came down to Beyonce', she has had the most to prove. After the gigantic success she had scored with I Am... Sasha Fierce, she has had a lot she has had to prove all over again. With winning 5 Grammys for Sasha Fierce, many people have awaited for something really driven to really get her really into the next level of success. Well, she is about to try it again with her follow-up 4. But with the lackluster success of Run The World (Girls,) as the lead single, the question is that is this Beyonce's end of her apex? Well, yes and not in a strong way.<br /><br />Beyonce's 4, the long-awaited follow-up to I Am Sasha Fierce is finally here, and honestly it isn't as strong. The tremendous challenge for her wasn't fully displayed in her voice on the album. The songs here show that she has put a bit more strain on her voice, than the feeling that her songs flow brilliantly. That shows in the lackluster Run The World (Girls,) as well as the 1+1 which her vocal display feels a bit choppy at times, and tired in the tone. Her other songs like Countdown, brings in a opening and a feeling that her song is similar in feeling to Upgrade U, and Best Thing I Never Had doesn't strike the feeling in her voice at all, to her collabortaion with Andre 3000 of Outkast on Party really isn't a striking snthem for her, unlike what had scored with Crazy In Love when she first broke out on her own. All the way to the end with I Was Here shows at least a intimacy with her voice, that fairs a bit better with her voice, and the chemistry in her song. Was I Was Here a tribute to her late idol, Michael Jackson in disguise? Well, we don't really know, but at least that song is better than what came out as singles before.<br /><br />Honestly Beyonce's 4 is to what her late idol Michael Jackson had with his weakest album, his final album he released before he passed away, Invincible. I really didn't feel the songs in the way she could've showcased them. Even Jennifer Hudson's I Remember Me is honestly a much better album to buy for its effort. 4 isn't a bad buy for hard core Beyonce' fans. But to tell you the truth, she could've and should have tried to put in a bit more effort into her songs to make it feel like it is the real deal. If you are new to Beyonce's music, I would definitely pass this one up, and hear Beyonce' where there is better inspiration elsewhere like B'Day or Dangerously In Love. 4 feels like Beyonce's fall down, and not her #1 she had hoped to make it be.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: C<br /><br />Price: C-<br /><br />Mastering: C+<br /><br />Overall: C 1/2+incible.

B000001ELD|1.0|If Paul Stanley's album was the best of the four simultaneously released solo efforts from Kiss in 1978, Gene Simmons' was without a doubt the worst - and the oddest.<br /><br />Calling in stacks of guest performers and musicians, he aims high at points, but ultimately the entire exercise flops like some sort of terrible expensive joke. Simmons' problem had always been his monotonous over-reliance on repetition in his song-writing - and it would continue to be throughout the career of Kiss. On this record, it is hard not to think that, if he had employed as many co-composers as he did performing guests, things might have been decidedly better.<br /><br />Sharing the same producer as Peter Criss' album - Sean Delaney - most of it sounds like the dregs of a Kiss album, including a redo of `See You in Your Dreams' from 1976's `[[ASIN:B000001EL5 Rock & Roll Over]]'. However, there are a few rather charming moments - all middle of the road or slow in style. `See You Tonight' is uncharacteristically tender and `Mr. Make Believe' - the best track on the album - is positively heart-rending. But the real eye opener is his cover of `When You Wish Upon A Star'. Disney-esque in approach, it is truly lovely and almost (but not quite) worth purchasing the CD just to own it.
B001MEJY8W|3.0|Builds to a pretty disturbing climax, but to be honest the beginning drags quite a bit. Lots of twisty weirdness to keep you somewhat off base on what is going on until well into the movie.. pay attention at the beginning to have the end make more sense. Have a strong stomach if you watch this though!
B0050CQY1W|5.0|THE ALBUM IS AWESOME AND BEYONCE SO ARE YOU. THANKS FOR ALWAYS TAKING YOUR FANS FOR ANOTHER LEVEL. 4 IS MY NEW GUILTY PLEASURE.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|Without a doubt, 4 is Beyonce's best work so far. She's never sounded stronger as a vocalist and the sound of this album really is her \\"gumbo.\\" After hearing that this album had leaked, I was one of the curious ones and listened to all of the songs before I bought this album. I was pleasantly surprised to hear that this album was so unique and fresh. It's nothing like what we hear on the radio nowadays. Much to Beyonce's credit! I'm so sick and tired of listening to the same tired and played out pop songs that are being released. This album is so different and it is kind of a throw back into the 1990's and even the 1970's.     1.) 1 +1: Beyonce's voice is so strong. Her voice blends in beautifully with the melody. A beautiful ballad. 5/5  2.) I CARE: At first, I wasn't too crazy about this song. But it has grown on me and I like it now. 4/5.  3.) I MISS YOU: Probably one of my favorite songs in the entire album. Beyonce's voice flows heavenly in this song. My only issue with it, it's that it's too short. 5/5.  4.) BEST THING I NEVER HAD: Probably 4's \\"Irreplaceable\\". I really like this song. The lyrics are not too bad either. A Babyface classic! 5/5  5.) PARTY Feat Andre 3000: This song reminds me of the songs that were played on the radio in the 90's. A feel-good song to jam to. 5/5  6.) RATHER DIE YOUNG: I love this song mostly for its lyrics. She mentions James Dean and how she feels like she's 17. 4.5/5  7.) START OVER: One of the strongest songs in the album, in my opinion. I think everyone can relate to this song. Not just girls. 5/5  8.) LOVE ON TOP: When I first heard this song, I instantly fell in love with it. This song is so Jackson 5! Very 1970's, very Motown. I LIVE for this song! 5/5.  9.) COUNTDOWN: I know a lot of people are not to crazy for this song. But I LOVE it. It shows Beyonce's growth as an artist as she experiments with different sounds. 5/5.  10.) END OF TIME: Probably the catchiest song in the entire album. A great dance song! I love the beat. 5/5.  11.) I WAS HERE: Beautiful ballad! The lyrics are GENIUS. Beyonce's voice is angelic. I LOVE it! 5/5  12.) RUN THE WORLD (GIRLS): This song has grown on me to the point that I absolutely adore this song. Say what you will about it, but it's catchy and it's empowering. 5/5.    I got the Deluxe Edition at Target...so here are my reviews for the additional tracks.     1.) LAY UP UNDER ME: Very 1980's. It kinda reminds me of a mixture of Michael Jackson and Prince. 5/5  2.) SCHOOLIN' LIFE: Very Prince! Very 1980's! Absolutely genius! It should have been in the album. 5/5.  3.) DANCE FOR YOU: This song has yet to grow on me. 3/5.    The 3 remixes of RUN THE WORLD (GIRLS) are not really to my liking. So, those are just there. They're okay. Nothing special.     I'm so glad I decided to buy this album. And give Beyonce her props for being bold and not sticking to the current \\"pop\\" songs that are being released. I wanted something new from her and I got it. And it was more than I could have asked for!
B0050LJIRK|5.0|This is a great CD, I've been rockin' out on this one. Wes Borland is laying down some phat riffs and Fred Durst is tearin' it up. Best record they've made I think.<br />This revival of nu-metal lately is great for me, always loved the genre. The Cold and Crossfade CD's sound awesome too. Now if we can just get System Of A Down back together!
0525423273|5.0|Okay, really. How can you read this novel and not fall in love with everything about it? Everyone is reading it, everyone loves it. I can't think of another contemporary YA book with such widespread and practically unanimous support. And it is so well deserved! It is such a quiet and sweet story, it kinda snuck up on me. I fell in love with the book a little at a time, just like Anna and St. Clair.<br /><br />So, instead of doing a traditional review, I'm making a list of five of the reasons that - in my opinion - this book stands out. Instead of stating the obvious facts about the general plot and characters being incredible, I'm focusing on the details that made the story.<br /><br />1. Anna's dad. A tribute to the ridiculousness of Nicholas Sparks. How AWESOME is that? Really. I have never wanted to give someone a high five as much as I want to give one to Stephanie. I often get great joy out of making fun of the guy, and was thrilled that it was a part of this story.<br /><br />2. Bananas, elephants, bridges, sandwiches, and Star Wars. The little things don't necessarily matter plot-wise. But: they're what make characters real people, and what make a book a story.<br /><br />3. St. Clair's fear of heights, Anna's OCD and their mutual inability to face change. We don't need our characters to be perfect, we want them to be real.<br /><br />4. John Green. He said this on Twitter (to Maureen Johnson): \\"have you read ANNA AND THE FRENCH KISS? It's like you and me and Sarah Dessen had a really sexy baby.\\"<br /><br />5. Mum, goinky, bloody, trousers. Deny it if you wish, but accents are hot. St. Clair didn't need one to melt readers of the book...but it certainly doesn't hurt.<br /><br />So, if you haven't read this book yet - do yourself a favor and pick it up. Make sure and savor the details, they're what really make this book shine!
B0050LJIRK|3.0|I've been on board since Limp Bizkit decided to get back together. After years apart and a new level of maturity, I was hoping this cd would blow me away. Are there good songs? Yes. Are there catchy songs we love? Yes. However, it's just not that memorable. I listened to the album and there was no song I went back to hear again. There just wasn't that wow factor. It's not a bad cd, it's just not great. However Borland's guitar playing really shines through on most of the tracks, an aspect I was very impressed with. It's not just Durst rapping over a live band playing a track anymore. The instrumentals are pretty good. It just didn't hit that amazing factor for me. If you're bikzit fan, you better get this. If you're a hater then this will just fuel the fire
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|I did not like this book for basically two reasons.  It meandered quite a bit.  Very slow pace.  Secondly, it is just a set up for the next book in the series.  I had it when a book is really nothing more then a teaser for the next.    In short, I don't think I'll buy the next in the series.
B002N5N5LG|4.0|I thought this was well written and very funny. I look forward to the release of season 2. The episodes only run about 20-25 minutes so it's great for killing some time .

B004T0XYM8|5.0|This movie has been one of my favorites for decades.  I've watched it several times and never tire of it.    The Blu-Ray restoration is very well done and for you moviephiles, the usual bonus stuff is actually pretty good.  In particular, Henry Fonda is fun when he talks about his preparations for the part.  It was also interesting to learn of the history of some of the other actors.    I usually don't see much point in buying movies, but this is a classic and well worth the price.

B001MEJY8W|5.0|Prior to viewing Martyrs, I had come across many reviews which obviously I would ignore. After all, I love the Horror genre as lately French Horror films have really stepped up to the plate & delivered the goods. Martyrs isn't an exception to that rule although I believe this one may have surpassed even my expectations.<br /><br />Forget the slasher genre before watching Martyrs. I can go ahead & tell you this in advance. Irregardless of what glimmer of hope you may detect in the initial chapters, Martyrs will crush your very soul after it settles inside your skin. Don't expect any heroes/heroines but brace yourself instead for a very extreme & morbid film which may be anything but predictable as far as Horror films usually go.  A happy ending to satisfy consumers who only watch Horror films as a means of escape may find themselves way out of their comfort zone and I strongly urge them to steer away from Martyrs.<br /><br />On second thought, try to avoid reading online reviews as many opinions may contain spoilers. Martyrs is perhaps most effective if experienced without an prior introduction. Even so, only the most hardcore fans should even attempt viewing this psychological masterpiece. If you somehow feel you've lost your edge after watching Saw or Hostel, I would highly suggest you pick up something else instead.<br /><br />Martyrs is the unforgettable story of a young child who manages to escape from a house of enslavement & torture only to find she can never truly escape her past. The film skips ahead 15 years & we find the child now grown & hell-bent on a violent rampage in hopes of killing her captors. Her lifelong friend arrives at the scene of the bloodbath only a bit too late & then the real horrors begin.<br /><br />Throughout the next 45 minutes, we are then subjected to a series of terrifying images which are even more devastating & unpleasant than anything witnessed in the initial opening. Laugier doesn't cater to the faint of heart nor does he wish to join the ranks of other film-makers who specialize in the so-called torture porn films. (As one reviewer has already stated,I think we need a new name for films which normally would fall into that category.) Instead, we are presented a deeply moving study of trauma & it's emotional effects on the human heart. Martyrs easily gets my vote for the most macabre work of art bequeathed in many years.<br /><br />Having said that, it may be awhile time before I watch Martyrs again but my experience here will stick with me for a long time.m-makers who specialize in the so-called torture porn films.

0316098329|5.0|This book captivates the reader from page one, as Donoghue does a supreme job of writing in the voice of a 5-year-old. I've never read a more realistic interpretation, ever.<br /><br />Donoghue is amazingly adept at fleshing out this ripped-from-the-headlines type of story, giving the characters depth and the reader a thought-provoking piece of literature they won't be able to put down. Her words move the plot along until the reader reaches the heart-racing climax. But she doesn't stop there. Donoghue takes us on the journey along with Jack and Ma into their life on the Outside, a world nearly as perplexing to her as it is to him.<br /><br />An extraordinary book.
B002WY65VU|3.0|Don't get me wrong. I don't mind a horror comedy. In fact, some of them are relatively good in that annoyingly yet infectious way which usually spells out \\"instant cult classic\\" to most moviegoers. Biozombie perhaps would be the best example of a zomedy film that actually doesn't suck & pre-dates Shaun Of The Dead. I had relatively high hopes for Zombieland initially.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the opening scenes of Zombieland sold me although I can't say the rest of the film holds much interest. The rules given by our lead protagonist were clever enough & oddly promising even though it would suffice to say Jesse Eisenberg has played the same character in virtually every film he's ever made. Eisenberg may have some acting skills (albeit limited) but I've yet to see a film where his talents are truly showcased. Having said that, his rules on how to survive in a zombie wasteland are \\"some kind of awesome\\" yet I can't help but wish someone else had delivered them.<br /><br />On the other hand, Woody Harrelson is an unpredictable actor & can crank out a helluva performance yet somehow his cowboy character here is barely more than a parody of his not-so great past works. Sure, his one-liners are kinda cute & drip with wit occasionally but nothing here would merit any comparisons to the kind of dialog Tarantino, Rodriguez, or even Zombie would've written. Poor Woody. He deserves more work (or better and meatier roles) but it's doubtful that Zombieland will keep his name on the map for very long. Within a year's time, no one will care about this movie & Harrelson's performance would have been long forgotten.<br /><br />I can't seem speak for Emma Stone at this point as I've yet to see of her work but I'll admit that I've never been a fan of Abigail Breslin. To take that a notch further, I usually tend to avoid her films so naturally the film disintegrates rather quickly once her screen presence is detected. Sad but true.<br /><br />To say that Zombieland doesn't have it's shining moments would be about like saying that a bear doesn't sh it in the woods. On the other hand, there is nothing truly original here nor exciting enough to warrant multiple viewings. A cowboy in search of the last shrink-wrapped Hostess twinky is all fine & well but I daresay this is not knee-slapping funny by any means. Or a geeky if not too precious teenager who seems to have little success finding dates or girls who are attracted to him especially during a zombie epidemic seems rather trifling.<br /><br />Perhaps the most interesting segment or montage that Zombieland has to offer is the cameo appearance of our beloved master of comedy Bill Murray. Murray is, indeed, a charming actor although he alone cannot save this film from being the preposterous mess that it truly is. Having said that, the bit part given here was indeed a step in the right direction. Maybe he'll be recast in Zombieland 2?<br /><br />Zombieland will appeal to your casual film goers who require very little story, rehashes of better zomedies, & characters that aren't credible. If you're looking for something different or original, you won't find it here folks.e saying that a bear doesn't sh it in the woods.

B004WPYNY8|5.0|This is a great album, the first song 'Iconoclast' is possibly one of the best prog metal tunes to come out in ages. I am truly blow away by the sheer brilliance of this band. I first got into this band with 'The Odyssey' and have been a fan ever since. Anyway if you are a fan of prog metal / rock you will not be disappointed with this masterpiece.
B000TGCR38|5.0|I'd seen the previews for this one months before it was released on DVD. Sadly, I don't remember ever seeing a release in the major theatres & this would have been great to see on the big screen. Hands down, this is quite possibly the best film Paul Verhoeven has ever made. Make no mistake, Verhoeven really gets serious this time around & finally makes a film which is deserving of every award that could be bestowed on a motion picture.<br /><br />For some strange reason, I've always gravitated to films about the Holocaust & this one is no exception. Whether they were mere foreign films or blockbusters like the Speilberg vehicle Schindler's List, I've seen nearly all of them from A-Z. Black Book reminds me more of Europa Europa or Polanski's The Pianist rather than Schindler's List however.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this film for many reasons & it's almost impossible to submit all of them here. The first thing that comes to mind is the actress. Where is on earth did Verhoeven find Carice Van Houten? She is absolutely the most beautiful, charming woman I've seen in ages as far as motion pictures go. She's overly talented, undoubtedly sexy, & her smile just makes me glow. Hmmm, no wonder I watched this one twice during the first week of purchase.<br /><br />Verhoeven really understands the actors/actresses he works with. I think he has really grown as a director over the years & he knows how to oversee a grand epic such as Black Book.<br /><br />There is enough drama & suspense here to fill about ten of Hollywood's best films & you can never be sure from moment to the next what to expect. That's another great reason to keep your eyes peeled here. As a viewer, you are hooked from the opening scene to the heartwarming closure.<br /><br />In the beginning, we see beautiful Van Houten running from the Germans in the initial stages of the Holocaust. Whether it means working as a servant in a Protestant family home or joining the resistance, she will do whatever it takes to stay alive & we are behind her every step of the way. Her biggest assignment is to infiltrate the gestapo & seduce the leader which she does with grace & refinement. What may even shock viewers is how she even falls for what could be perceived as a monstrous being.<br /><br />Why this one didn't have a larger theatrical release or wasn't showered with Oscars is beyond me. Black Book was easily another favorite of mine which was sadly overlooked in 2006-20007. I highly recommend this one to fans of historical films & of course those interested in the Holocaust.step of the way.

0312323867|2.0|I loved Something Borrowed. The entire time I was reading Something Blue I kept wondering what Rachel and Dex were doing. How was their trip to Hawaii? How did Dex pop the question? What was their wedding like? What about her pregnancy? Something Blue gave tidbits here and there but I still feel unresolved. I would love to read more about them.     I agree with many of the two star ratings. I don't believe Darcy could change that drastically over one conversation. Yes, motherhood can change you but in the brief timeline of the novel I just didn't get it. I was also not crazy about the predictable ending with Ethan. I loved his character but they were not at all suited for one another, at least not for a long term match. I would have loved to see her meet a mix between Dex/Ethan for a long term relationship.

B004XN3FHA|5.0|I have never used a high lumen light before, but after reading reviews all over the internet, many people who were into flashlights, said that this brand and model was one of the best ever. The light that comes out is so bright, especially at night, where it seems to throw the light so far as well as very accurate. And it's solid as a rock. The feel is great with a special type III grade aluminum body, which feels like hardened steel and has a great grip. This light is truly \\"top of the line\\". Anyone who Googles this flashlight will see what I'm talking about. It's a little on the expensive side for me, but well worth it. I'm very happy with this professional light.

B003VPWXRO|4.0|Really enjoyed reading this book. Sometimes 'fame' makes people do really harmful things.<br />She did everything she could or thought it was right for some 'fame'. She touched her bottom point and<br />came back up just as a phoenix. Totally different and renewed.<br />Thou the book tends to tell the journey of Portia during that hard time or 'obsessed' time of her life,<br />I found it sometimes like a 'guide/diet' on 'how to lose weight. Too many details that any girl in the<br />same situation she was can copycat.
B000Q6GUTI|2.0|1.  Some of the best scenes in the book are omitted from the film...why?    2.  Danny Glover acts like two old people screw.  It's just embarrassing to watch and you know you'll never be able to wipe it from your memory.    3.  Marky Mark is grossly miscast.    4.  See title of this review above.
141694737X|5.0|This is one of the best books for toddlers.  My one year old loves it!  The flaps are made right into the book (not glued on) so he can't dislodge them or pull them off.  Great story!
B0002KZAKS|5.0|Picked up a pair of these 2 years ago as cheap spare mics.  Found they are indistinguishable from an SM58 to both singers and the audience!  Running the board I know it's different because it's a little hotter and a little brighter.  I see that as improvements over the SM58 which is lacking in both.  The only downside compared to the SM58 is slightly more handling noise (which you won't notice with the mic in a stand) and the black versus silver ball filter.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I am looking forward to seeing this set, as I just finished reading the first novel in the series, in a week no less, and I found the story to be both simple, yet complex at the same moments. For instance, Eddard Stark, who is one of the leading roles, has a sincere sense of honor that he lives by. His actions are easily determined based on his surroundings, but at the same time, what we as a culture would perceive to be as the otcome of the protagonist's scenarios never fails to surprise, leaving you fully expecting one action and the resulting outcome, only to be truely surprised in the end.     If you haven't read the book, I would not read these oter reviews, as they have significant spoilers that you may rather find out from watching or reading the stories instead.     I am afraid that if you know the ultimate outcome, without understanding what transpired to reach that end, you may find yourself disappointed, with a sense of granduer that you knew what was going to happen... Seeing the end of this novel before delving into its depths is a waste of a great story and, from what I have seen in the previews, a very well drafted, cast, and represented classic tale.
B0050LJIRK|5.0|I am so happy that this album has finally came out it kicks total ass. Its got the classic Bizkit vibe: heavy songs,emotional songs and even silly ones that you just totally love. I've always been a Bizkit fan and have been waiting for an album like this one since Wes Borland left and now he's back with a vengeance. The Guitar work is screaming with atmosphere and texture, the rhythm section of Sam Rivers on Bass and John Otto on Drums thumps ferociously, and DJ Lethal still kills. This album is 100% pure Limp Bizkit and cannot be compared to anything else so please just check it out because it destroys all the other garbage on the radio that people like to call music today. I know everybody says \\"Nu Metal\\" or \\"Rap Metal\\" is dead but isn't all that labeling crap for middle schoolers? Just call it Limp Bizkit and enjoy it. My personal faves are Loser,Bring it back,Get a life and Shotgun, But I love the whole album and pretty much listen to it all the way through when I do put it on.<br />Give these guys another shot even if you previously hated them you'll be surprised.
0316098329|3.0|I listened to the audiobook, up to disc 5. After the SPOILER ALERT <escape>, I had so stop. Jack is no longer an interesting observer but an annoying brat. I appreciate that Emma Donaghue did not exploit the Old Nick's 'creaks on the bed' but the damn breastfeeding bothered me. Ma was shriveling up and still this little pain in the ass kid wanted to feed from her, then his temper tantrum over candles. He was unlikeable in many instances and eventually I just called it a lost cause.

B0034G4ORC|2.0|What went wrong with this film?    As a sci-fi fan, I eagerly anticipated the release of this film earlier in the year.    The VERY well done trailer made this film look like it was going to be awesome.    But, to me, it was, sadly, a missed opportunity on the part of the filmmakers.    What stands out to me, as a sci fi fan....    1. Aliens were not interesting looking, well thought out, and were just overall nonsensical in their design  2. Aliens looked awkward when walking around...(like walking tadpoles)...but even this was presented in a sort of \\"after the thought\\", laughable type of way  3. No sense of awe, wonder, or mystery about the aliens on the part of the script or the actors...., the movie just starts \\"showing them\\"  4. Aliens did nothing much that was \\"alien\\" in terms of their behavior, customs, or movements when invading...they looked very much like earth soldiers in the way they walked, shot their weapons, etc  5. In fact, the \\"Alien\\" weapons were VERY MUCH \\"Earthlike\\".....the aliens, from space, used.....guided missiles launched from some walking machine....why would we suppose/assume that an alien race from space would use very much \\"US Army\\" style guided missiles as weapons...something extremely earth-like...seemed like a lack of creative juices going on with this one?  SIMILAR- Alien guns, even though shooting lasers, were once again too \\"earth-like\\"...their weapons, from another galaxy across space, still fire with the same rhythm as an earth military gun \\"uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh\\"...no odd, foreign weapons, no weird organisms being spit at people as weapons, etc...guided missiles and what basically would count as a type of automatic weapon  6. The marines not wondering where these things are from, what they want here, how their technology works, none of this matters to the people...NO sense of wonder, awe, or questioning at all  7. The one Marine's worst line in the film.....\\"I wonder if they're just like us...just grunts, takin' orders...\\"  most embarrassingly funny line of the movie  8. All we DO hear over and over are speeches about the Marines, Marines never quit, Marines never die, Be my brave little Marine, .....would the Marines really still continue to care about being marines if there was about to be no more EARTH???   9. Wouldn't it have been more interesting to see if there was a faction of marines that just took off and starting using their skills in a sort of every man for himself mode? Vigillantes, etc? Something to signify that the normal structure of \\"the Marines\\", the \\"United States Government\\", etc etc was not going to be intact when Aliens invade the earth...Maybe this would have introduced an actual CONCEPT to the film, some sort of SUBTEXT about how society might hold it's traditions together in times when society itself may be about to end...who sticks with the Marines and who takes off on their own, as a survivalist? Would have added SOME KIND of food for thought in this film  10. Aliens were too easy to figure out.  Just blow up their control tower and you got them. Not well thought out...not hard enough for the Marines to figure out...this was just suddenly dropped as a \\"fact\\" from Michelle Rodriguez character...no set up to reveal the discovery of the control tower, no previous scenes in the film where the Marines are trying to figure out the mystery of where the control tower is, etc...Basically , no SETUP at all, just a sudden left turn in the plot from a line from Michelle....hmmmmm.  11. The only good scene in the film took place in the laundry room of an apartment complex...THAT was cool...THAT was the only scene that mixed the everyday/mundane local L.A. environment with an alien from space...THAT was what we came to see when we bought our tickets, and you, the filmmakers, gave us like 2 minutes of it......and (what seemed like) 100 hours of \\"Brave Marines\\" music, \\"Brave Marines\\" speeches, and unrealistic scenarios, shaky camera, and explosions  12. Once again, lack of \\"mysteriousness\\" of the aliens...the earth characters were so uninteresting that I actually wanted to learn more about the aliens, but the movie didn't seem to care about the things I cared about...the movie ignored them, and that was very frustrating  13. The CGI was cheaply done and seemed rushed, so this fact was just seemingly glossed over by making fake \\"heat waves\\" to cover the aliens look during man scenes, so we couldn't really see them  14. Bad script  15. Bad acting  16. Annoying music that didn't change no matter what was happening on screen, no change from \\"brave music\\" to \\"suspenseful music\\" to any other kind of music...just the same 5 minutes of orchestral theme playing (seemingly) over and over in a 2 hour loop  17. Continuous lack of suspense...just action without suspense  18. WASTE of Michelle Rodriguez and especially EMBARASSINGLY BAD SCRIPT and EMBARASSING treatment of Aaron Eckhardt's acting skills  19. Long, long, LONG speeches from Aaron Eckhardt about how he memorized the name, rank, and serial number of the brother of the soldier that died under his command...WHY IS THIS USED AS CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT??? WHY is \\"REALISM\\" and \\"CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT\\" in these types of films decided to be depicted by HAVING PEOPLE IGNORE THE FANTASTIC AND UNBELIEVABLE FACT THAT ALIENS FROM SPACE ARE INVADING THE EARTH AND INSTEAD STILL SQUABBLING over things that happened last year....the one Marine, instead of spending any time pondering anything, just spends the movie mad at the Sgt for the fact his brother died under that Sgt's command. We as the aidience are not guiven a reason to CARE about the brother, because we never even got to KNOW the brother in the film. We came to this film to see Sci-Fi. We didnt get it.    This film was, to me,  the most disappointing film of 2011.    It was an EXTREME case of a missed opportunity, in my humble opinion.

031261246X|3.0|Entertaining and educational, this techno thriller is Mr. Russinovich's first novel and it sends home a very eye opening and unsettling message. He has an extensive background in computers and networks and has been an esteemed Technical Fellow at Microsoft. In his story he presents a very vivid picture of the vulnerabilities and devastating outcomes that are possible in a cyber attack on the US and Europe. The story starts out slowly with an investigation into the mysterious failures and anomalies of a number of major computer systems. The technical aspects are well researched and clearly presented and developed for the reader. In the second half the pieces come together and fast paced action to avert the impending cyber attack, becomes more dominant. I found the story and characters interesting, but the best part of this book is the depiction of the vulnerabilities of our way of life in our increasingly computer/network relevant world. Especially recommended for inquiring minds on what can only be one of the major emerging issues of new age.
B000BNX3B4|3.0|I'm a huge John Cusack fan. I bought this movie when it first came out on DVD and it took me a while of going back and forth for a few years to finish it. I didn't care for it too much at the beginning but recently I watched it again and it's an okay film.    This is a romantic comedy (no surprise). The premise is nothing original or even that entertaining. This is like the basic setup for romantic comedies. Two lonely over-the-hill people are afraid to get back into the dating scene. She is an uptight, repressed woman who has sworn off men. He is a damaged, pathetic soul who is convinced romance is dead. Their friends and loved ones put ads on the Internet and WA LA! You have a movie.    We all know how it's gonna turn out. Sarah (Lane) and Jake (Cusack) get together, fall for each other but then other obstacles get in the way. Of course Sarah finds herself attracted to a school teacher (Dermot Mulroney) but doesn't let Jake know this until he catches them kissing in a very badly put together scene. No surprise here in fact, nothing in this movie was a surprise.    The supporting characters saved this film for the little it was worth. Elizabeth Perkins was a hoot as Diane Lane's sister. Stockard Channing's performance was excellent as Lane's soon-to-be stepmother. She really kept the fire going for some otherwise boring scenes. Sarah was an okay character and more enjoyable than Jake. I found Jake very annoying. His actions did not fit the character at all. Jake has been turned off of dating to the point where he didn't want to try again, yet he meets Sarah and he falls so hard for her he thinks she's the one? Why? Because she turned him down at the dog park? It was silly and unrealistic how Jake got so attached to Sarah so quickly. On the flip side, Sarah acted like she didn't care for Jake much at all and it wasn't believable that she would even go out with him seeing how he offended her the first time they met.    Some of the scenes between Lane and Cusack werecute but they had no chemistry. I hate to be vicious but Lane looked like Cusack's mother. She is a lovely lady and I appreciate she's aging gracefully but she looked way older than Cusack even though it's obvious Cusack's had some botox treatment which would explain the puffy eyes. That's another thing that irked me. I couldn't stop staring at how weird and bloated Cusack's face was. It was also hard to watch how Jake gushed over Sarah like some schoolboy with a crush. You just didn't feel it to be genuine. Lane has more chemistry with Mulroney who would have better been suited as Jake in my opinion.    This movie is not terrible but it's not great either. I'd skip the scenes with the main characters and stick to the scenes with the supporting characters. What's so bad is that Jake is not even shown half as much as some of the other characters. This film was supposed to be about Jake and Sarah yet it gets lost on all these other subplots. There was too much going on at one time. The tragedy was that the dad's love life was more interesting than watching Sarah and Jake.    Maybe if Sarah had showed more emotion toward Jake you could take the romance seriously. But you never feel like she really cares but instead is just going with the man she thinks is the best of the pack. She's gone out with so many dogs, Jake seems to just be the one she sticks with. I didn't buy that she actually cared for him.    You \\"must love dogs\\" if you loved this film. This is something that should've been made on DVD and never released on a wide scale. I feel like with a little more work this would have been a romantic comedy worthy of the Julia Roberts' fans stamp of approval but this just fell short in every way.    I gave three stars for Stockard Channing and believe me, I'm being incredibly generous. It won't hurt to watch it but there are at least 50 more romantic comedies ten times better than this.
B004W648Y2|5.0|The Kinks didn't get much respect for a long period of time. In the U.K. they were always seen as being in the shadow of most of their contemporaries but history does a nice job of adjusting things in favor of the underdog; The Kinks have gotten their due for a series of great albums produced during their peak of creativity when they couldn't get into America to tour due to a ban from the Musician's Union.<br /><br />\\"Arthur\\" remains one of Ray Davies' masterpieces. It didn't sell well in the U.S. but it gained a cult following among everyone who cared about music.<br /><br />This deluxe edition helps redress some of the issues that blocked this great album from receiving its due back in 1969.<br /><br />Andrew Sandoval went back to the original master tapes, dug around in the archives and done a splendid job of remastering what he found (with Dan Hersh)for this latest CD edition. Audiophiles should note that this is louder than previous editions but Sandoval has done a nice job of balancing the needs of the marketplace to that of the music listener; these are NOT brickwalled and have nice dynamics.<br /><br />Disc one and two consist of the original (respectively) mono and stereo versions of the album. Which one you prefer will probably depend on which one you heard first but both have some minor, subtle variations in their mixes that make them both essential for hardcore Kinks fans.<br /><br />PLEASE NOTE: On the mono version of \\"This Man He Weeps Tonight\\" there appear to be clicks and pops as if the digital file was corrupted somehow. Just be aware of it and hopefully Universal will fix it in the next pressing.<br /><br />EDIT: 11/14 Reportedly the reissue has had this problem fixed.<br /><br />Both discs are rounded out by a variety of single b-sides/alternate takes/backing tracks and outtakes.

Added on are BBC tracks recorded to promote the album in the U.K. including \\"Arthur\\", \\"Mr. Churchill Says\\" and \\"Victoria\\" all of which have some subtle differences from their album tracks (since the vocals were usually re-recorded for the BBC and, in some cases, the entire track was recorded).<br /><br />Disc two features \\"Plastic Man\\", \\"This Man He Weeps Tonight\\", \\"Mindless Child of Motherhood\\", \\"Hold My Hand\\" (an alternate stereo mix), \\"Lincoln County\\" and an alternate mix of \\"Mr. Shoemaker's Daughter\\" (also penned by Dave).

B000U7169M|3.0|It's hard to do any sort of religiously themed movie without annoying believers or non-believers one way or the other (and pleasing the other) as other reviews illustrate.<br /><br />But as to the movie itself, it's okay as a horror film and I think the link to the biblical material works in that context.  I did not find the twists at the end bad.  Perhaps not amazingly sophisticated, but they held up okay.  I'm not sure I'd watch this movie again and again, so I give it a 3-star rating:  okay; not great.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|Beyonce's \\"4\\" just works for me... it just does. I've been a fan since \\"Dangerously in Love\\" but I've no shame in admitting that her latter works weren't so hot (i.e. I Am...Sasha Fierce). The Sasha Fierce album was a filled with random tracks - it was a headache. However, with \\"4\\" Beyonce focuses on throwback sounds of the 70's and the 90's and does it so damn well. \\"4\\" is currently my chill out album (something I can't say much for the music on the radio today). I'm glad she went the \\"Me, Myself, and I\\" route because it suits her voice perfectly.     I can see why die-hard fans can't \\"feel\\" this album like some of us do but change isn't always easy. Beyonce takes risks and she is making music to her own liking! I say go for it...! Really, what the problem is that they've seen too much Sasha and not enough BEYONCE.    I feel like this album is getting the same flack that Rihanna's \\"Rated R\\" album received. \\"Rated R\\" is actually my favorite Rihanna album and perhaps the best in the year it was released (in my opinion).     Favorites on the album:  I Miss You (Perhaps my favorite Beyonce track, ever. It's just DIVINE.)  Party  Love On Top  End of Time  Run the World (Girls)  Lay Up Under Me  Schoolin' Life     So yes, this is the best Beyonce album to date. I swear it.
B000BB1MI2|4.0|Neither Burton's Alice in Wonderland nor Charlie & the Chocolate Factory qualify as \\"remakes\\" because they are based on the books & not older movies, but Frankenweenie 2012 will qualify as a remake.     In order for this to be a remake of Willy Wonka, it would have to  not be based on a common source material, have the same music, & not diverge in characters or story. This is simply a different \\"version\\" of the same story, only this one is not as loosely adapted as Willy Wonka.    Personally I love both movies equally. Burton's has the hotter quirkier Wonka with father issues & a far less annoying Charlie. The secondary characters were cleverly modernized from the 60s book & made to address certain unhealthy addictions, but the music is horrible & just using one guy for all the Oompa Loompas was lame when many actors of short stature would have loved to have been in it; just as bad as Peter Jackson not using real little people to play Hobbits & Dwarves. WW has the funnier Wonka, though with less background & character development, & fantastic music but with a less interesting ending. It's pretty much impossible for Gene Wilder not to be funny.    Imagine how much darker C&TCF & AiW would have been if not produced by Disney & if Burton had actually written the scripts himself. Author Ronald Dahl, creator of the source material, would have loved that, because he despised the 70s movie for it's divergence & lightheartedness, so much so that he denied the rights to make a movie of Charlie & the Great Glass Elevator, which is a pity because the music would have been great & it would have been one more Gene Wilder movie to enjoy.

B0050CQY1W|4.0|Let me start by saying that Beyonc&eacute; has finally released the album I knew she had in her. I was let down by \\"B Day\\" and \\"I Am... Sasha Fierce\\", especially coming after her rather good debut. Styled along similar retro-Soul lines as little sis Solange's last album, this is easily her best effort. Opening the album are a pair of retro Soul ballads; \\"1+1\\" (with a Prince-style guitar coda, though she mis-pronounces the word Algebra as Al-Gee-Buh), and \\"I Care\\" (with Beyonc&eacute; ad libbing to an electric guitar solo). Both showcase fiery vocals. Next is the haunting \\"Miss You\\" with spare synths, 808 beats, and softer layered vocals.<br /><br />\\"Best Thing I Never Had\\" is a piano-sprinkled Babyface co-write which is \\"Irreplaceable\\" part II lyrically. The Kanye West produced \\"Party\\" is a stunning midtempo slice of late eighties/early nineties groove featuring Andr&eacute; 3000. The lovely \\"Rather Die Young\\" is another retro ballad and recalls seventies Stevie Wonder. It is surprisingly co-written with Empire Of The Sun's Luke Steele. \\"Start Over\\" is a passionate ballad about reviving a moribund relationship, with vocals vacillating between fiery and tender.<br /><br />Up next are the most upbeat songs; the summery \\"Love On Top\\" which sounds very MJ (\\"Rock With You\\" or \\"Butterflies\\") with lovely harmonies, parping horns, and skyscraping vocals especially at the end where she modulates to a higher octave with each successive chorus.<br /><br />\\"Countdown\\" is an experimental piece filled with horns, cluttery beats, and sampling the intro to the Boyz II Men song \\"Uhh Ahh\\". It is what songs like \\"Diva\\" or \\"Video Phone\\" wanted to be but didn't quite make it. \\"End Of Time\\" was apparently inspired by Fela Kuti and it shows. Martial beats, triumphant horns, shifting polyrhythms, and layered vocals, in a declaration of undying love. Love seems to be a strong theme here.<br /><br />\\"I Was Here\\" is the only song not featuring Beyonc&eacute; as a writer. Penned by Dianne Warren and co-produced  by Ryan Tedder, I feared it would be a cheesy ballad. It is a song about facing one's mortality and pondering one's legacy. \\"I will leave my mark so everyone will know, I was here\\" she sings wistfully. This should be a signature tune for her.<br /><br />Closing is the lone clunker on the album, lead-off single \\"Run The World (Girls)\\", a mess of sampled beats and spoken/shouted female empowerement lyrics  absolutely devoid of anything resembling a melody. I'm glad it bombed as I fear otherwise, there may have been more like it. My other wee gripe is that some attempts at \\"belting\\" come off sounding strangled (e.g. \\"1+1\\", \\"I Care\\", and towards the end of \\"I Was Here\\"). I love the cover photo, though someone near ruined it for me by suggesting it looks like she's got furry pits.<br /><br />Some may find the album too laid back but therein lies the charm. Beyonc&eacute; finally seems at ease and content enough not to pander to trends and has in the process come up with a winner.a cheesy ballad.

B0050LJIRK|4.0|For a while back at the turn of the century Limp Bizkit could do no wrong, their first 3 studio albums all selling millions of copies. It seemed the more negative press they got especially front man Fred Durst the more records they ended up selling. That would all change by late 2001/early 2002 as a new wave of guitar bands namely The Strokes and The White Stripes would change the course of The music landscape at the time. Also the departure of guitarist Wes Borland would also deliver a blow to Limp Bizkit. They continued on with 2003's \\"Results May Vary\\" a record which divided fans and didn't sell in the numbers the previous albums had. A brief return in 2005 with original guitarist Wes Borland yielded the ep \\"The Unquestionable Truth Part 1\\" which saw the band adopt a much heavier sound. By 2006 it was all over Borland had departed again to work on his own band Black Light Burns debut album. Red baseball caps were becoming an endangered item, that was until 2009 when they got back together and started touring and promised a new album which is what we have now in \\"Gold Cobra\\".     It's their first full length album With Wes Borland since 2000's \\"Chocolate Starfish and Hot Dog flavored Water\\" and his presence does make a difference, you will recognise his familiar riff on \\"Bring It Back\\"(following intro opener \\"Introbra\\") which bursts into life before the minute mark when Drummer John Otto unleashes his heavy sound. The title track \\"Gold Cobra\\" sound like it wouldn't be out of place on first album \\"Three Dollar Bill Y'All\\" and features some great bass work by Sam Rivers as well as some great rhymes from Durst the track even changes a bit towards the end, kinda like the breakdown used in \\"Eat You alive\\". As always Rivers Bass and Otto's drums are real tight. A track that has got all the trademark Bizkit features is \\"Douchebag\\" as it features a killer Borland riff and has the usual quiet/loud breakdown, it's a song made for playing live. It's also got a simple chorusthat won't be to hard to remember. \\"Get A Life\\" is up there as one of the heaviest Limp Bizkit tracks and has a Borland solo to back it up.     On the second half of the album \\"Walking Away\\" has a bass intro that sounds not unlike \\"Take A Look Around\\" or \\"Re-Arranged\\", it's one of the more mellow tracks on the album and wouldn't have sounded out of place on \\"Results May Vary\\". \\"Loser\\" is again on the lighter side and is surely one of those songs used to give the listener a chance to catch their breath after the non stop all assault of the first part of the album, the intro also sounds a lot like \\"My Way\\". \\"Autotunage\\" has Fred using auto tune and it doesn't sound great and sounds more like a gimmick than anything else, it's a song thats unlikely to get many plays. It also goes way over long. The only real highlight to \\"90.2.10\\" is that it's got a trash riff going on. Thankfully the album finishes strong with \\"Why Try\\" and \\"Killer In You\\" two tracks that never stray too far from the Limp Bizkit formula.     Limp Bizkit will continue to divide people. Fred Durst will continue to irritate people. But it's good to hear Limp Bizkit playing to their strengths and not straying too far from what them such a big name in the first place. It's great to have Wes Borland back in the band. Many people have given up on them long ago and it's unlikely they will ever enjoy their early success again but throw this album on and turn it up loud after all Limp Bizkit were always meant to sound like this and if you didn't like them before this is unlikely to change your opinion.
B001LF3YQK|5.0|This was a present for a friend and her husband -- they are having a baby in a few months.

Highly recommended as for the true BLS fan will not be disappointed and the new fan will be hooked!
B0034G4ORC|4.0|Although not a big fan of war movies, I enjoyed this one thoroughly. It is not only strong sci-fi fare, but the characters fighting them are all well defined and interesting. It bears re-watching to catch all the lines, wisecracks, and strategies employed by our beleaguered group of Marines, civilians, and one survivor of an Air Force team. It has been snarkily commented in another review that the film seems to be a Marine recruiting film, but I doubt that anyone would want to try to survive what is shown here. A very entertaining film all round.
B003MC5N28|5.0|I understand why there are over 3,000 reviews for this story. I can't believe I had never heard of it until I stumbled across it while browsing for Kindle books. My son said that many of his friends had read it so I downloaded it for us both to read. He devoured it in a day (on his 12th birthday no less and the main character is a \\"twelve\\"). It took me a couple of days but only because of time constraints. However, once I started, I couldn't wait to get back to the story every time I had to leave it sitting.<br /><br />This is one of the most unique stories I've read in a long time. Imagine such a world where there is no color, no choice, no love, just complete compliance. Jonas is a wonderful main character and carries the story well.<br /><br />I really liked the imagination that went into creating this perfect world while illustrating that we can't have love without loneliness, we can't have joy without pain, and would we really be happier if the frustration of choices were taken away from us.<br /><br />I love this story so much, I've download three more books by Lois Lowry and can't wait to get to them.<br /><br />Oh, my son loved the story as well and I'm hoping that he found it something to think about. It certainly opened up some discussion between us as I read it.
B002WY65VU|4.0|Zombieland takes a similar path as Shaun of the Dead in that it is not a \\"serious scary\\" zombie flick, but more of one that lampoons the genre. Not taking itself too seriously, Zombieland has great wit and well-timed humor, and a strong cast that carry the plot. Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), clean cut, nice guy type with many fears and phobias, begins the film setting the scene for how Zombieland came to be, and tells about his various zombie rules, the dos and don'ts in order to survive. Columbus, unsure how many people are left, is out on the road to find out the fate of his parents when he encounters Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson), a  heavy-drinking tough guy with a real hatred for zombies but a real love for Twinkies. The two form a quick but shaky (and unlikely) alliance, and are off to Columbus' destination when they get swindled by a pair of sisters, Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) and Wichita (Emma Stone). Later, all four encounter each other again, and Columbus and Tallahassee decide to help the sisters on their quest to an amusement park, which they claim is \\"zombie-free.\\" From here, the four have to survive zombies, Bill Murray and themselves? Between bickering, arguing, and complaining towards their destination, there is plenty of well-timed humor and action, with Tallahassee taking out some zombies in his own special way.    While the plot about heading to an amusement park was a bit silly (it's a zombie film, so I'll give it a pass), Zombieland is high on entertainment, action and humor. The plot clearly is not its strength, but the chemistry between the four characters really works well, and keeps the film engaging. Reckless Tallahassee contrasts so much with circumspect and careful Columbus, that is gives the film an added humorous touch, the two a zombie odd couple of sorts. The scene with Bill Murray was a nice touch too.  I thought the love angle between Wichita and Columbus was a bit forced and predictable, but it helped to establish more of closenessbetween the two.   Zombieland is a fun, entertaining, comedy to add to the zombie collection. The disc also has many worthwhile extras to check out.

044654146X|5.0|Start-up Nation: The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle, by Dan Senor and Saul Singer, attempts to answer the question: how did a small, besieged country without natural resources or local trading partners become a world player in high-tech?  Israel is a country of about 7 million people and just over 60 years old; yet, it produces more start-up companies than countries like Japan, China and India.  It attracts, per capita, more than twice the venture capital investments than the US and thirty times more than Europe.  Aside from the US, Israel has more companies listed on NASDAQ than any other country.  What explains Israel's success?<br /><br />Senor and Singer argue that the Israeli military is one key to Israel's success. In Israel, military service is mandatory. Young conscripted soldiers are empowered quickly to make hard decisions and improvise in difficult, unpredictable situations. The soldiers that stand out are selected by the elite military units for intensive training. The military also demands thoughtful and thorough debriefings of failed and successful missions alike.  Outcomes alone are not sufficient.  Every exercise and engagement is treated as a learning opportunity.  In the debriefs, senior soldiers challenge junior soldiers and vice-versa.  Hierarchy, tradition and the status quo are not accepted as roadblocks to finding the best solution.<br /><br />The military's values help create a culture that empowers and nurtures entrepreneurism.  A failed venture is not a failure; it is an opportunity to learn for the next one.  Challenging existing technologies and business models is endorsed.  Israel also creates breeding grounds for ideas--tight clusters of universities, firms and start-ups, coupled with strategic government support.  Together, these clusters foster innovation.<br /><br />The strength of the book is the examples Senor and Singer share.  Whether it is the story of Shimon Peres and a young entrepreneur approaching senior auto executives about the electric grid for cars or the story of the unwillingness of one plant to allow the 1991 Persian Gulf War to interfere with its on-time shipments, it becomes clear why Israel is a unique story.<br /><br />For the business person, there are lessons to be learned about how to run an organization successfully.  For the supporters of Israel, the book generates a sense of pride that Warren Buffet (who never buys non-US companies), Google, Cisco, Intel and many other high-tech companies look to Israel for innovative development.for cars or the story of the unwillingness of one plant to allow the 1991 Persian Gulf War to interfere with its on-time shipments, it becomes clear why Israel is a unique story.

B004L03B3S|4.0|\\"From Beginning to End\\" (\\"Do Começo ao Fim\\") is a beautiful 2009 film from Brazil, which tells the story of two boys lifelong love for each other, emotionally, physically and - eventually - sexually.  The twist is that they are half brothers, and their parents caught on that they were \\"perhaps too close,\\" yet could not justify making it an issue.<br /><br />The film starts with the birth of the younger (about five years) sibling, and shows them at various stages in their lives, as young children, a bit older and dealing with a death in  the family, and then in young adulthood.  The older brother, Francisco, is a physician, while Thomas has followed in his brother's footsteps as a competitive swimmer.  The problem is that Thomas gets an offer to train with the Olympic team in Russia for the upcoming Games, which would be the first time they were ever really apart.<br /><br />Nicely photographed and scored, with realistic dialogue (The latter is in Portuguese, and the English subtitles are a bit challenging to follow, since the characters talks so fast.)  The siblings' sexual relationship doesn't manifest itself until they are both in their 20's, but it is still controversial and handled as tastefully as possible. The actors playing them as adults are both attractive and capable actors, and their scenes together are quite romantic as well as homoerotic, perhaps making you easily forget the fact that they are supposed to be siblings.  The plot is pure simplicity, simply showing the relationship to be as \\"natural\\" as possible, and succeeds in that respect, although it is far from riveting entertainment.  Extras are limited to trailer and chapter stops.  Not rated, but would be an R for the subject matter, sexual situations and partial male nudity.  I give it four stars out of five.

B004SBQAN8|1.0|If you must watch this I would prepare something to multitask with. I regret that I gave this movie my undivided attention.     This movie made no sense and its plot was about as coherent as a reality tv show. The special effects were good, yes, but if it had no effects this movie would not have anything to stand on. The producer's standpoint is fully transparent in that the only function of the movie is to cater to a certain audience (14-16 years old).    And this is NOT jealousy speaking but I could not shake the vibe that the main character was supposed to have a \\"look how cute I am\\" thing going on at all times. And yes his girlfriends was hot but besides them both modeling around aimlessly this movie has no substance whatsoever.
0316056863|5.0|Tina Fey's BOSSYPANTS is a wonderful amalgam of all aspects of this brilliant performer. Striking the right balance between humor and serious observation and knowing exaclty how deep to stick the knife in is what makes 30 Rock such a genius show, and Fey exhibits the same deft touch in this memoir. There's just enough self-depracation, there's just enough justifiable criticism of the \\"can women be funny\\" issue, there's just enough of a peek into her personal life. For the latter, the spate of celeb bio/memoirs that slip from revealing detail into wallowing is tiresome, and Fey doesn't come close to that.    As to the \\"can women be funny\\" issue, a subject most often put forth by male comedians, Fey epitomizes perhaps the pinnacle of female driven humor. Her work at Second City in Chicago, which happily I witnessed, literally broke ground at that venerable institution as she was part of the first cast that was represented by equal numbers of men and women. I think it can be argued that 30 Rock is, if not THE, certainly one of the top comedies ever seen on network TV, and the unmistakable sensibilities of Fey can be seen in every shot.    My only criticism of the book is that I wish it were longer. That wouldn't have helped the quality of the book, but it would have given me another day or so of joy.    This book is what the star is; funny, accessible, reachable.
B003PIUC02|5.0|When I first heard about this show at the San Diego Comic Con, shades of the Kirk Douglas/ Stanley Kubrick film raced through my head. I said, how could this be a weekly TV show? However, what I got was an entertaining, visual rollercoaster ride, filled with human emotion and a whole lot of intrigue and excitement!    The Blu-ray of this first season is so sharp & crisp, it literally has become exactly what I was hoping Blu-ray would be, an almost \\"live\\" experiance! The sharpness does, however, allow you to see though some of the visual effects, which were really made more for broadcast TV. But, overall, these discs are wonderful and the added features, the behind-the-scenes, etc are equally entertaining!    Now, I am waiting for the release of Spartacus: Gods of the Arena on Blu-ray!
0307279189|4.0|A very intriguing read. McDougall creates an adventure/travel story, mixed with ultrarunning history and its prominent athletes, mixed with running science and some very eyeopening information and studies regarding mankind, distance running, and evolution. I was captivated by it all.    To anyone interested in running, or fulfilling your own dormant athletic potential, I recommend this book, and I also recommend exploring the joys of running.    I am already a barefooter most of the year long, and have been trying to include barefoot running in my regimen. Injuries have kept me down, but McDougall and Eric Orton and the Tamahumara give me hope.    Critique: I did find his writing style to be distracting some of the time. Sadly, I don't know if this book will stand the test of time due to endless cliches and comparisons, slang, colloquialisms and pop culture references. Lots of \\"dude,\\" \\"bonehead,\\" slang names and sayings, etc.    Inspiring, easy to get through. In short--read it.    --- ---    \\"When you run on the earth and run with the earth, you can run forever.\\" (114) -- a Tarahumara saying    \\"You don't stop running because you get old. ... You get old because you stop running.\\" (202)
B001HN6922|2.0|My family and 4 year old enjoyed the first CARS movie so it was natural that we would want to see CARS2. What a dissapointment. There was way too much violence for young children. I take my child to less than 5 movies per year and only G rated. I'm sorry I wasted our time and money on this one. I had to continually explain the storyline to my child (bad guys vs good guys) due to the shooting/violence. This movie should be rated PG. As far as adult enjoyment, weak storyline. there is so much they could have done to develop characters based on the good foundation from the original CARS movie. This one is an utter failure.

B003X9W98G|5.0|I have to admit that I was a little weary going into this season since David Tennant was no longer playing The Doctor.  However, after watching the first episode of season 5, I was instantly hooked with Matt Smith's performance.  He brings his own wit and amazing talent to The Doctor character.  I'm glad I decided to give this season a chance!<br /><br />This season, aside from the usual enemies, was very different; not only because there is a new Doctor, but also because one thing that happened in the first episode of the season carried through all the way to the season finale (the crack in Amy's wall).  I love how they kept that theme going.  Now onto season 6!

0316069485|5.0|This is my fourth Michael Connelly book and so far, my favorite. My consensus in the past has been great writer, love the stories but a little slow to get started. That's why I loved this book so much, I felt like he focused on just one case and so the action got to get started more quickly. Once I got to 30% on my Kindle, I said to myself \\"I have to know what happens!\\" and read until I finished it. Like I said, I loved it and it was definitely worth the read.   SPOILER:  As for the ending, I was left a little jarred because Connelly usually wraps up everything by the end and he'd set up a lot of good stuff. So I will say I was slightly miffed that the book was over and I didn't actually find out what Jessup was up to by sitting at the parks. But I don't think Connelly will leave it at that, the way he left us I immediately thought sequel. Of course, now that he's gone, I'm not sure how satisfying it will be to connect him to other murders but still . . . I stand by my original rating. Soooo good!

I'm sure there are lots of good utilities offered, but the documentation seems much less clear than it could be. Even on the developer's website, I can't see how to duplicate the displays and progressions given.    I'm ranking the app with five stars because I really don't know what all it does yet and want to give it the benefit of the doubt.

B0050CQY1W|5.0|This album is wonderful in every sense of the word.  This is the new fresh wickedly cool Beyonce, what a stunning album.  This one is her best yet...keep them coming B.
B0050CQY1W|3.0|Let me start of by saying that I am DISAPPOINTED. After all the interviews she did about needing time off to find inspiration I thought for sure she'd come back with her A-game, and she didn't. The album consists of a mix-mash of songs filled with her growling to the point that you can't understand what she's saying most of the time. After all this time you'd think she'd know what her niche is, obviously not. It has been a downward spiral in terms of musical integrity for Beyonce since she came out with Dangerously In Love (her best album). We suffered through the rush-job that was B'Day. We nearly died of boredom with when we realized that 75% of I Am...Sasha Fierce was basically the same slow song on a different beat for eight tracks. And now she supposedly `comes back' with this crud. I should've kept my money.    1. 1+1: its seems a bit odd to start off an album with what could be consider the slowest song , but sadly it sets the tone for the rest of the album. Leaves me wondering when the hell it's going to end. 2/5    2. I Care: is definitely one of the best tracks on the album, if you don't mind the fact that the last 60 seconds of it consists of her no longer singing and simply doing those godforsaken runs she used to do in the early years of destiny's child. 4/5    3. I Miss You: Sound suspiciously like Disappear from the sasha fierce album 2/5.    4. Best Thing I Never Had: Sounds like it should've been called Me, Myself and I pt.2. Surprisingly decent song if....again....you don't mind the fact that the last half of the song is just her growling. 3/5    5. Party: Thank God for Andre 3000 and Kanye's musical genius, the Slick Rick Sample doesn't hurt matters either. It would've been boring if it had just been her singing alone. 4/5    6. Rather Die Young: sounds like a mash-up between her sasha fierce album and prince, not a bad thing but again the growling drove me crazy. 2/5    7. Start Over: lyrics are beautiful, but again...THE GODFORSAKEN GROWLING forthe last half of the song. uh! 3/5    8. Love on Top: Again, another attempt to mix the sound of the old with the sound of today, its okay but again the growling at the end drove me up the wall. Sounds more like it was just thrown on to take up space. It doesn't really fit in with the rest of the tracks. 2/5    9. Countdown: No....just no. This song is a filler, plain and simple. 0/5    10. End Of Time: My favorite song on the album! Why she didn't release this as the lead single for the album I'll never understand. It's the most radio friendly, the catchiest and the most dance-worthy. 5/5    11. I Was Here:  Another filler that sounds, again, like another track from the sasha fierce album. Lyrics are similar to Save The Hero. 0/5    12. Run The World: Let's face it, there is a reason that this song failed to chart, crashed and then burned in obscurity. They lyrics are childish; it could've been a hit if Willow Smith sung it instead. Any grown woman still running saying `girls rule the world' needs to sit down.  0/5    I'm sure I'll catch slack for this but this is my review, I'm sure the stans will praise the album to no end but any time you have to say `I'm sure it will grow on me if I listen to it enough times' it's a sign that you don't like it. End of story.
0618918248|2.0|Religion is the easiest thing in the world to disprove. His books are an easy sell to the faithful and the faithless. Trying to put religion into his little scientific box is not hard, and today it's in vogue (i.e Global Warming). That doesn't mean to say I don't understand his and others hostility toward religion some of it's deserved.    Just remember there are things that man cannot put into little box and that scares men like Mr. Dawkins.  So-called educated men like Mr. Dawkins have caused more problems in the history of men than religion could of ever caused.
B0045U9WPU|1.0|After reading the reviews, I couldn't decide whether this would hold my interest so I headed to the library and got a copy instead of paying $9.99. Turns out to have been a good idea. I stopped at page 89 and skipped forward to page 149.  Finally saw Alex's name but it looked like they were just meeting up. The thought of reading another 50 plus pages of blah blah blah killed it for me.  89 pages into a book and NOTHING has happened.  I don't need continuous action, but this was absolutely dull.  I also couldn't get interested in the whole premise of a society without love in order to instill peace and permforming some type of lobotomy at age 18 is just too far fetched. The book is heading back to the library tomorrow and at least it didn't cost me anything.
1594484805|5.0|There are some fantastic reviews here that talk about the book in depth; I don't have time to offer something more than what's already here.<br /><br />I did want to say I loved this book - extremely interesting. It made for a great book study at work.<br /><br />I wanted to point out that the 2009 Hardback and the Kindle book (which seem to be the same) have a different \\"Type 1 Toolkit\\" section - the set of appendicies at the end. The 2011 paperback version has an updated version (for instance, the 2009 version has \\"Type 1 for Organizations: Nine Ways to Improve...\\" and the 2011 version has \\"Type 1 for Organizations: Thirteen Ways to Improve...\\") While the concepts appear similar after we discussed them, it's clear some re-writing and re-organizing went on, and I guess I would assume, without any evidence, this is likely true for other areas of the appendix as well. This made for a bit of confusion in a book study format.<br /><br />You might want to ensure all members of a book study have the same version, or at least warn them of the differences.<br /><br />I thought I'd share that for others contemplating doing a study of this book.
B0050CQY1W|2.0|I am normally a huge Beyonce fan and always end up liking several of the songs off of her cd.  Unfortunately I didn't like any of them off of this one.  It has seem to me that she keeps declining with each cd she has put out.  Maybe it was because she didn't really have her normal dance type songs on here and maybe I just wasn't in the mood for that type of music the day I listened to this cd.

B003K1EYM6|4.0|So, I read many of the previous reviews talking about how the feature set of this product was impacted by the release of iOS 4.2, but my intention was not to connect a keyboard, or headset or anything other than what the product was intended for.<br /><br />Now I've read places where some cameras no longer connect via the USB dongle that's included with this kit, and that would certainly be a problem since that is the original intention of this product.<br /><br />People complaining about Apple reducing the functionality for uses that the product was never intended for have no grounds for complaint in my opinion.  However, users who are trying to use the product in its intended manner and who are having issues with that do have a valid complaint.<br /><br />Despite the issues, I decided to give this product a shot.  My family and I are planning a trip to Europe and rather than dragging along a laptop to look at and alter any pictures I take, I was hoping to use my iPad.  I'm not sure why the price here on Amazon is more than the retail price at local electronics stores, but that's the one thing that kept me from buying the product here.  I bought from a local store instead.<br /><br />After several days of testing, here's what I know...<br /><br />1) MicroCenter brand memory SDHC memory cards seem to work fine in the SDHC reader.  I bought a 16GB Class 10 MicroCenter SDHC card and it works fine.  Since this is basically a \\"no-name\\" card, I'll assume that most major brands should work fine if the direcory structure follows the usual DCIM/cameraname/pictures format.<br />2) Cards formatted and used in both my Canon A590 point-and-shoot and my Olympus PEN E-PL1 camera work fine.<br /><br />I have not yet tried the hack where you store videos in the camera image folders and import them, or connecting my camera to the iPad via the USB dongle, but I will do both of those things and will report back.<br /><br />My main goal was to be able to use my iPad on our trip to view and manipulate photos from my digital camera though, and for that purpose and with my particular setup, this product works as advertised.  Instead of carrying my 8lb laptop, I can simply take the 2oz SDHC dongle.  Since that is my main objective in buying this product, I'll give it 4 stars.  If it turns out that I can connect my camera also through the USB dongle and can load movies to the iPad using the SDHC dongle, then I will bump it up to 5...r that purpose and with my particular setup, this product works as advertised.

B00190OHD6|5.0|Okay,  like many other people here I (glancing over both my shoulders) love this movie. It will make you laugh really hard and make you cry even harder. From concept, to the acting, and on through editing, it is a finely crafted film. Why, I am actually starting to make myself gag over all this gushing and the guy in the next cubby is totally staring.  Watch this then then buy it. It is a keeper. Oh yeah, you'll want to bring tissue! :o)
0345529057|1.0|0. \\"Once shame on you, twice shame on me\\".  I confess by the second book I should have thrown this book away.  I read these books hungering for some arch or plot to the story and found myself eating words and words and words upon words.<br /><br />1. The author treats his characters like the New Jersey Turnpike.  You begin to get to know them and root for them or root for their defeat and then bam out of no where they are dead or they take an exit and disappear.<br /><br />2. The book is filled with dialogue and detail that make no contribution to the arch of the story.  In fact whatever arch there might have been is diluted with words, words, words.  There appears to be no arch.  More like random descriptions of characters and situations.  So far the HBO series seems to be a great improvement.  It does not suffer from the endless distractions and endless pages upon pages that the books have. Be warned the books are, so far, not the HBO series.<br /><br />3. The characters with most depth are probably Jamie and Tyrion Lannister.  Unfortunately what may prove to be the main character Dany Stormborn, if there is one,  is plastic and 2 dimensional at best.
0470932139|5.0|I've been doing food photography for a few years, but mostly with artificial light. I bought this book to look for tips on natural-light food photography and food styling and found it incredibly useful. Dujardin's writing is engaging and lucid, and I immediately picked up several tips that I put to work right away - with happy results.    I also read her chapters on photography basics and camera settings and modes, and while I didn't learn anything new because of my experience level, I think newer photographers would get quite a bit out of those chapters.    One important thing Dujardin does is emphasize affordable options for improving food photography. Don't think you need a digital SLR or expensive accessories to get anything out of this book - she points out that you can get excellent food shots with a point-and-shoot and a few pieces of foamcore.

B004H4XDBI|5.0|The book Where She Went was the sequal to If I Stay, if you have not read the first book you will get lost and I love this book as a whole. It carries on Mia's story 3 years later but from Adam's point of view. Every other chapter is a memory, just like in the first, and as you can read, Mia and Adam live completely diffrent lives from the first book. The publishing company, SPEAK, publishes some of the best teen books around. I highly recomend this book and the first one as well. You will feel a deep conection with the characters and it will leave you craving more. Am I saying it is better than the first one? No, the first one is what gets you hooked. Its a great book!!!
B0015DRPJU|5.0|I loved this book and this series so far is great! i just dont understand why the kindle version of the series is so much more expensive than the paper version. Normally, it's the other way around. Amazon...get with it and give us a discount! i have 3 more books to read!

She's not original but a copyist and I'm not hearing anything new on this.  Not saying she doesn't have talent but it's not for me.  Some things sound like other artists on the radio.  In fact, on the song Party she sounds like Rhianna which is why there isn't one cd of hers in my vast and eclectic music collection.  Just my opinion.  I'm sure this cd will fly off the shelves and she'll win awards...
B004ZGI2KK|2.0|Watching this movie felt too much like Twilight in a way but despite that the story was not given any time to develop. It was a very loose story through out the film that comes together slightly towards the end. The beginning of the movie is the hardest to watch - it just doesnt feel like the actors were into their roles and there is not development to what era they are in. It was like here is a story about some people in the woods who are tormented by a wolf every so often and then oh wait lets throw a two boys chasing the one girl twist. Just bland. Better to watch it on rental than at the movies.
0765357151|5.0|There are a few books that I can beyond a reasonable doubt are seamless masterpieces; I Am Legend is one of those rare few.<br /><br />The first thing to point out is that this was the 2nd book I've ever read in my life and that number was a very crucial number for both my writing and reading career; in other words, if this book happened to suck, I would have tried to have been a writing without being a reader (and that could have had dangerous results). I'm glad to say that this novel did not make me hate reading--it made me give books a chance because Richard Matheson spoke to me through his written words, \\"I Am Legend.\\"<br /><br />Now there are three types of people that are reading this review right now. First, the people who are also posting their reviews and see what everyone else is saying; second, the people who saw the Will Smith movie and thought it was really good and want to give the book a chance; third, the people who were once like me, who are finally giving reading a chance. And the person reading this might be a combination of all three.<br /><br />But let me speak to the second type of person reading this: this has nothing to do with the Will Smith movie except for the main characters name (well, technically the vice versa is the truth). I won't alienate those who like the movie by stating my own opinions about it; and I won't bash the movie, because this isn't about the movie - it's about the book, and it's a dang good one.<br /><br />For those who've liked the movie, I can say that the book isn't about mutant-zombies, but rather traditional vampires with a twist; for those who hate the movie and are somehow stumbling upon the book on amazon based on recommendation or instinct, then my friend, both scenarios are right. This is a good book and it goes to show how great it is that maybe - just maybe - it's the most adapted book to film almost ever (if not ever). Of course films haven't gotten the book right yet, nor does it matter.<br /><br />Maybe all the adaptions mean that this novel is so good that the films can't even compare. I highly recommend it for those who either A) want to enjoy a book they haven't read yet, or B) those who are into the horror genre.*<br /><br />*a special thing to mention. George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead was inspired by this novel . . . so you can say if it wasn't for this novel, the flesh eating zombie genre wouldn't even exist in the world. So with that conclusion, Bravo!all the adaptions mean that this novel is so good that the films can't even compare.

B004OGDW4M|5.0|To say that I have listened to every note of this 16 CD set before reviewing it would not be true, but I have certainly already spent many hours in its company and feel able to deliver at least a preliminary account of its many virtues and possible drawbacks.<br /><br />Tennstedt's Mahler is of the old school; no \\"Mahler lite\\" here. The word which repeatedly came into my head while listening was \\"majestic\\". His tempi are indeed often slow but by no means necessarily the slowest in comparison with other successful versions and his sense of the music's architecture invariably means that he eschews any tendency to drag. The quality most associated with his interpretation is massiveness, a sense of great blocks of sound being manipulated into position to form a mighty edifice.<br /><br />This studio cycle was recorded over a period of nine years from 1977 to 1986 and I would say right away that the sound is remarkably good. At first sight, EMI's decision to remaster only some symphonies is puzzling but in fact is quite straightforward: only those symphonies recorded in analogue between 1977 and 1981 have been deemed in need of remastering, which was done between 2000 and 2002 - with the exception of no. 2, which was recorded in very early digital in 1981 and thus presumably too glassy or in some way unsatisfactory owing to inexperience with the technology. Otherwise, the remaining nos. 4, 6, 7, 8 and \\"Das Lied von der Erde\\" and the three live recordings of no. 5, from 1988, no. 6, from 1991 and no. 7,from 1993, were all recorded in digital sound and EMI have presumably deemed it unnecessary to remaster them.<br /><br />I appreciate that Tennstedt devotees will tell you that to hear him at his best it is necessary to go to live recordings such as his phenomenal 1989 recording with the same orchestra on their own label or performances on the BBC Legends label, but this set still represents an extraordinary conductor in some of his finest work playing his favourite composer. Furthermore, you still get the chance to make some interesting comparisons between studio and live performances as this latest issue includes three live performances of Symphonies 5, 6 and 7. I am not entirely convinced that these live recordings are always immeasurably superior to the studio versions; there, for example, is very little difference between the two accounts of no. 5, although on balance I actually preferred the studio version. While the Trauermarsch is weightily imposing in both, the playing of the second movement a little scrappier in the live account, intonation is occasionally suspect and the overall mood is too hectic for my taste. The Adagietto has a richer, more powerful, sobbing intensity in the studio but I do, however, love the way Tennstedt engineers its ending on a barely perceptible thread of sound in the live performance; both versions are superb. In general, the live performances are slower and have an intense, mesmeric quality not always evident in the occasionally less inspired studio versions of the Sixth and Seventh; at the same time it is possible to criticise Tennstedt's preference for drawn-out tempi as unnecessarily indulgent.<br /><br />Tennstedt called the London Philharmonic Orchestra \\"the best orchestra for Mahler in the world\\" and when listening to certain passages, such as those featuring the flutes and oboes in the \\"Abschied\\" from \\"Das Lied\\", I can only concur; there is a great deal of wonderful solo artistry, especially from the woodwind and horns, and invariably a gorgeous sheen on the sound of the orchestra as a whole. The best performances here are, I think, the Third and the Eighth, but the set as a whole represents an extraordinary bargain and an indispensable survey of Tennstedt's special gifts in Mahler, suitable either for the seasoned collector or the novice wanting to be introduced to the glories of Mahler's symphonic world.<br /><br />The surprise for me in this box set was \\"Das Lied von der Erde\\"; I had notpreviously heard it and rather assumed it to be inferior to the established classic versions, but this is not the case. Klaus K&ouml;nig has been judged by some to be the weakness in the set but I find him to be in very good voice: heroic if slightly throaty of tone but with plenty of heft and ringing top notes. Any slight strain is hardly inappropriate in such demanding music. Agnes Baltsa's smoky, vibrant mezzo is not really inward and other-worldly enough in comparison to the poise of Janet Baker or Christa Ludwig who have more nobility of timbre than Baltsa's more earthy sound but her more overt melancholy works in the longest \\"Abschied\\" on record, she floats some beautiful top G's and her repeated \\"ewig\\" as she fades away is hypnotic. Tennstedt's phrase-shaping is immaculate; his ability to sustain the requisite tension is enormously helped by the lustrous playing of the LPO, whose shimmering strings allow him to bridge the long, drawn-out lines.<br /><br />Given Tennstedt's penchant for grandeur, the opening of the First Symphony is a model of delicacy and restraint: over a gentle ppp the horns intone their motto suggestive of \\"faery lands forlorn\\", then the trumpet fanfare injects a note of urgency, the orchestra building to the most stirring climax possible. As throughout this cycle, the brass and horns are marvellous, often whooping with Straussian verve. The only disappointment here comes with the rather diffident manner the trumpets adopt for the passage at 10'38\\". Time and again one is struck by Tennstedt's sense of pace and timing, his artful use of rubato, his ability to recapture the momentum having once relaxed. With Tennstedt, one must always take the long view, but occasionally - and most damagingly, perhaps, in the Ninth - a lack of emphasis and punch such as Bernstein or Solti can bring to crucial moments is apparent in Tennstedt's \\"slow burn\\" demeanour.<br /><br />The \\"Resurrection\\" is the longest of many a recording, making Klemperer look positively brusque, but Doris Soffel copes admirably with the etiolated tempi, sustaining a rich, steady line and Tennstedt justifies his choice of beat, securing terrifying energy and commitment form the London Philharmonic Choir and steering the work home to an ending of overwhelming opulence and majesty. A great recording, not perhaps, as all-embracing as his live LPO version but nonetheless a success within the context of the recorded cycle.<br /><br />The Third, as I have already said, is one of the best of all and also in the best sound. I still think that Levine is the most satisfying of all in the way he combines brooding mystery with dark purpose but both he and Tennstedt capture the ironic, faux-naif deliberateness the opening movement demands. Movement by movement, I find that his rivals sometimes surpass Tennstedt: in the second, both Kubelik and Levine manage to bring more charm to the tripping bucolic dance and in the third alto Ortrun Wenkel is very ordinary alongside Horne and Podles, but then nor do Bernstein (Martha Lipton) or Kubelik (Marjorie Thomas) have the best singers and they are still front-runners in this symphony. Tennstedt is just a tad too voluptuous compared with Bernstein, Wit and Kubelik in the \\"Sehr langsam. Misterioso\\" fourth movement, his boy trebles leaning into the \\"Bim-bams\\" rather coyly - the direction is \\"keck\\", not winsome - but this performance is greater than the sum of its parts and I find it the most successful after the Eighth. Both Bernstein and Levine take considerably longer than Tennstedt over the sixth movement and have been accused of taking an overblown approach, and although it is difficult to see how it is possible to overdo the intensity of  such music, Tennstedt's somewhat more restrained and refined interpretation also eschews to some degree the unwelcome sentimental association of the melody with \\"I'll be seeing you again\\" uneasily melded with strains of \\"Also sprach Zarathustra\\".<br /><br />The Fourth Symphonyhere is a gloriously open, lyrical, warm-hearted performance. Tennstedt's tempi can be daringly extreme but they work; this is a tender, poised account which succeeds in transporting us heavenward. Soprano soloist Lucia Popp is perfect; her honest, direct singing is all Viennese charm without a hint of Schmaltz.<br /><br />I have already indicated that the Fifth is a great success. It created a stir on its appearance and remains a tour de force both of orchestral playing and interpretative cohesiveness; the central Scherzo, in particular, is striking in the virtuosity of the LPO horns and brass and the passion of Tennstedt's direction. The Sixth is a dense, doom-laden trudge, the slowest recording of all, yet Tennstedt's wonderful control of dynamics and sense of overall shape weaves a magical spell, preferable to Yoel Levi's almost panic-stricken haste, Szell's steely, frenetic urgency or Levine's crisp, clipped drive. It is in fact closest in mood to Bernstein's weighty grandeur and those two remain my two favourite versions. The live recording is even slower, but still hangs together. Similarly, both performances of the Seventh look leisurely on paper but are immensely compelling.<br /><br />In the monumental Eighth, Tennstedt inspires his forces - somewhat smaller than normal but certainly not lacking in power or gravitas - to produce one of the finest recordings of this great but unwieldy and uneven work.<br /><br />I have read criticisms elsewhere of some supposed inadequacy in the soloists and a slackening of tension in Part 2. I certainly hear nothing of the kind: the singers are wonderful, especially Edith Wiens as Una Poenitentium, and the climax to the whole piece is breath-takingly majestic. The sound is very fine and the reduction in choir members is all to the good as it allows Tennstedt to achieve greater clarity but without loss of weight. His tempi are finally judged, if occasionally idiosyncratic - but he does everything for good reason and clearly has a broad, over-arching vision of how the music should go, such that he manages to bridge some of the bare patches and potential longueurs when Mahler's inspiration flags somewhat. I found both the London Philharmonic Choir and the Tiffin School Boys to be thrilling, with intonation secure even in the upper reaches of the voices.<br /><br />I agree with previous commentators that the Ninth is perhaps the least successful symphony here. It is a big, grand, gloomy account which lacks Bernstein's &eacute;lan and often simply goes slack. Rhythms lose the pulse and despite some glorious playing and impressive moments, the conception is too diffuse and the momentum stalls.<br /><br />The Adagio from the Tenth brings compensation for that disappointment; the sound is superb and Tennstedt has recovered the spontaneity missing in the Ninth; the intensity of the psychomachia depicted here is riveting, such that one gives nary a thought to the exceptionally long duration of the movement that Tennstedt demands.<br /><br />This super-bargain box set is a wonderful testament to the devotion to Mahler of a conductor who came late to the composer but brought to his music the mature fruits of his own mental and bodily suffering. It is not flawless but evinces an integrity and honesty of response, in harmony with a technical proficiency, which secure Tennstedt's place amongst the greatest interpreters of Mahler.tively brusque, but Doris Soffel copes admirably with the etiolated tempi, sustaining a rich, steady line and Tennstedt justifies his choice of beat, securing terrifying energy and commitment form the London Philharmonic Choir and steering the work home to an ending of overwhelming opulence and majesty.

I certainly hear nothing of the kind: the singers are wonderful, especially Edith Wiens as Una Poenitentium, and the climax to the whole piece is breath-takingly majestic. The sound is very fine and the reduction in choir members is all to the good as it allows Tennstedt to achieve greater clarity but without loss of weight. His tempi are finally judged, if occasionally idiosyncratic - but he does everything for good reason and clearly has a broad, over-arching vision of how the music should go, such that he manages to bridge some of the bare patches and potential longueurs when Mahler's inspiration flags somewhat. I found both the London Philharmonic Choir and the Tiffin School Boys to be thrilling, with intonation secure even in the upper reaches of the voices.<br /><br />I agree with previous commentators that the Ninth is perhaps the least successful symphony here. It is a big, grand, gloomy account which lacks Bernstein's &eacute;lan and often simply goes slack. Rhythms lose the pulse and despite some glorious playing and impressive moments, the conception is too diffuse and the momentum stalls.<br /><br />The Adagio from the Tenth brings compensation for that disappointment; the sound is superb and Tennstedt has recovered the spontaneity missing in the Ninth; the intensity of the psychomachia depicted here is riveting, such that one gives nary a thought to the exceptionally long duration of the movement that Tennstedt demands.<br /><br />This super-bargain box set is a wonderful testament to the devotion to Mahler of a conductor who came late to the composer but brought to his music the mature fruits of his own mental and bodily suffering. It is not flawless but evinces an integrity and honesty of response, in harmony with a technical proficiency, which secure Tennstedt's place amongst the greatest interpreters of Mahler.
B00574Q7PQ|3.0|Plain and simple this movie is a combination of Total Recall and The Bourne Series tied up into one movie. That doesnt make it bad nor does it make it great. The story is there and I at least could not figure it out until the end. Good action sequences and acting. Its more like a 3.5 stars. Worth watching for a home rental.
0307346617|3.0|This is an odd rating even in my own opinion. Now let me tell you a story with only one perspective instead of about fifty different ones. I like zombies, guilty as charged. 28 Days Later is my second favorite movie ever, the Resident Evil franchise is my favorite game franchise ever, and George A. Romero's Dead has had a huge impact on my filmmaking aspirations. I even read . . . a lot!<br /><br />So why doesn't a zombie-loving reader give World War Z only a 3/5? Well, it's complicated to feel but so easy to explain. I'm going to be real honest here; it's beyond me how this book has such a high rating. I'm not saying the book is bad, so don't think that. A 3/5 if an average score and average is not terrible. World War Z has a heart in the core of all the jumbled narratives; it has some type of political agenda somewhere in the muck of symbolisms; it has some sort of story it wants to tell . . . but it never tells it.<br /><br />And I'm saying that truthfully. The narrative jumps around so much that you cannot feel for the characters and you can't feel for the zombies like in Romero's films (not counting his later ones); it's not scary - and if you've read this and are reading this review, you can't deny that - but this review is for those who haven't read this. The only other novel I can compare this to is Michael Crichton's Next, except in Next the stories connect in the end. These stories, if they really connect, are hard to tell when and where and how . . . I mean, yes, there are zombies . . . and yes, this is WWZ. But you really never feel like the book means anything because it is too passive; and I'm not saying that's a terrible thing, sometimes being too aggressive can be terrible - like Scott Sigler.<br /><br />This book has such a high rating because a lot of people feel: \\"yes, finally a zombie novel to add in the ranks of Romero in film and Resident Evil in games\\". But, if those zombie fans who gave this novel a perfect 5/5 would have dug critically, they would have realized that this book is very flawed and really not very fun at all - and definitely not scary. Not all horror books need to be scary, but those books usually make up for it in other categories (look at Resident Evil 4 - not very scary, but considered one of the greatest games of all time, because it makes up for the lack of horror in other areas); World War Z doesn't, however. There's really no other way of putting it.<br /><br />You're going to read this because you like zombies; you're going to read this because you're hoping that I'm wrong and the people who've given this a 5/5 are right; but while you read this novel, this review will be a seed of thought that will open your eyes to the complete averageness of the novel. It was a good attempt, but it's not the zombie-genre novel that zombie-fans have been waiting for; it's just the zombie-genre novel that popular media predicted the zombie-fans would love.<br /><br />If this novel was in third person, it probably would have been a 4/5; if this novel was uber gory and ridiculous, it would have been a 2/5; but since the novel did have a conscience, however unfocused the point Max Brooks was trying to make, I give it a 3/5. I think Brooks has potential to really blow our socks off, but he needs to write something that has a story and plot and memorable character - because it is the lack of good characters that hurts this novel, because they're gone before you can like them.<br /><br />The best way of describing World War Z is that it's a series of short stories strung together in a chronological timeline. When I read this book, I didn't think: I hope this gets adapted into a film, and as an artistic person in general, this really did nothing to me creatively.would have realized that this book is very flawed and really not very fun at all - and definitely not scary.

0756665949|4.0|I'll admit that I haven't read the entire LOST Encyclopedia yet, but I have gone through and read parts that are of great interest to me, which is a good bit of the book.  I agree with some other reviewers that there isn't enough text and there are too many pictures.  This show was so huge in scope, its mythology so grand that a much better book could have come out of the show. It was delayed so many times that I even wondered if it would be released at all.    I noticed that the book is sorely lacking in the area of indexing. It's hard to believe that a bona fide indexer did this one. It appears to be hastily done by someone who doesn't know indexing.    This is one of those books I enjoy thumbing through just for the memories of a show I love.  It's on my coffee table with a collection of some other books.  I'm hoping, also, that another and better edition will surface one day soon and pleasantly surprise us.  Despite its errors, it's still a nice book for remembering a great television show and that's why I gave it four stars, because I like it rather than love it.
B0050LJIRK|1.0|...no, seriously, is this a joke? it seems pretty funny. well, as funny as an album named after an workplace medical insurance plan could be.   ...but, i ask you, is this a put-on? it could be. however, i don't think it is. one of the other reviewers mentioned that \\"true Limp Bizkit fans should buy this.\\" I'll be honest. I wake up everyday, look in the mirror, and am profoundly grateful i am NOT a true Limp Bizkit fan. I can't imagine a sadder or more dull existence than being a true Limp Bizkit fan.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|While I enjoyed this book, I found the transitions out of intense action too fast. Someone explained everything to Katniss that the reader experiences in a page long paragraph. I would prefer to see that scene instead of just hearing about it. That aside, some of the plot points felt a little far-fetched or needed more explanation. It felt a little rushed. I did enjoy the book and while I'm not completely satisfied, it was still one of the best books I've read.
0060899220|2.0|This book is a pure ego trip by an overaged, over-the-hill, drug addict and has-been chef. The look behind the scenes in the kitchen is interesting but I find his advice fairly insulting to my intelligence. The book \\"Heat\\" is far better and is minus all the four letter words which I do not need. However, the book can be entertaining if read it for what it is. Mr. Bourdain has been shamed by all the better chefs who actually have some Michelin stars to their credit and who actually give better advice and techniques. Even Anthony Bourdain's good chef buddy, Eric Ripert, is a whole lot more entertaining.
0385342055|5.0|I love all the Shopaholic series and was not disappointed by this one! It is just as funny, cute, and entertaining as the first ones. I love Becky and now Mimi. I can't wait for the next one!
B004EPYZUI|1.0|Honestly, I don't get why this movie has so many stars, it's really frustrating to me.    I was PUMPED for this movie to come out at least a year before it was released.  I even told everyone about how pumped I was whenever it was mentioned!  I was eating crow after finally getting to see it opening night though.    The beginning had me wanting to find out more but after the second or third action sequence I had to hold myself back from walking out of the theater.  There's not much story or substance to what's going on here.  The CG, costume design, music, and scenery are stunning eye candy but they do absolutely nothing to hide the horrible non-existent storyline and overly long playing time.  I wanted SO bad for this movie to succeed but in the end I just couldn't muster up the courage to admit I picked a bad one.    \\"Main\\" story line had ton of plot holes and is truly idiotic.  PLEASE don't waste your time with this one not even for a laugh, it's THAT bad.  I wish I had my GF talk me into seeing a chick flick instead of me dragging her along for this hot mess.  At least one of us would have been happy!
B0040LLLMQ|4.0|Season Six of LOST is not my very favorite season.  There are two reasons for that, one being that I didn't like the storyline as well, and two because it was the last season and I didn't want to say goodbye to the show.  I was one of those never-missed-an-episode in all the years of the show people.  In my opinion, Season Six could have stood alone instead of being the last season, and instead of rushing and summing up everything, another season would have been better for ending the show.      What they did with Claire was something I didn't like, with the remains of an animal substituting for baby Aaron.  I also didn't like John Locke becoming the Smoke Monster.  He was a favorite character of mine in the beginning, and he continued to slowly go to the other side as the show progressed.    The sideways flashes had me so totally confused that I had no idea what was going on.  Not until after the show ended and it was explained did it make the slightest bit of sense.  Sort of. For six years I loved this show and watched it faithfully, read just about every book that I saw on the show, and read and researched so many things that may or may not have been clues, but I learned so much about things that I had never known before. It was all worth it.  However, the ending was something that I really was very disappointed with.  It was a very tender ending, but not one that I wanted to see with all my favorite characters coming together after death.  I cried very hard and for a long time, and as for the ending, I can't watch it again, even after a year. I'm not sure when I'll be able to watch it, that's how invested in this show I was and how emotionally attached I became.    Season Six won't do you any good if you haven't watched Seasons One through Five, which I highly recommend.  If you haven't seen the show, you've missed one of the best ever to air on television.  Just because these are my thoughts on Season Six, doesn't mean they're everyone's.  This was a brilliantlyproduced and directed show, and Season Six is no exception in those two areas.
B0037A4ILC|3.0|This newish German film is interesting to see how Germany today treats its Nazi history. Here, we cheer two half-hearted Nazis in 1936 when they were urged to conquer the Eiger face in the Alps to help Hitler drum up excitement for his Berlin Olympics. I was surprised to see in the special features that most of this is digital special effects, but they are well done. The 'romance' with the girl newspaper photographer and one of the stoic climbers makes no sense: he shows zero interest in her, yet she climbs out on the mountain to try to save him? Absurd. The cutting back and forth between the drama on the mountain and fat and happy Nazis in the mountain hotel detracts from the action. The inevitable tragedy is gripping.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Director Charles Ferguson's \\"Inside Job\\" is one of the most difficult documentaries that I have ever had the privilege to watch.<br /><br />The Wall Street thugs responsible for the collapse of this country and for thousands of ruined lives, tent cities, children without education, indeed, children who take the bus from motels to school in the morning--are not in 6 by 9 cells like deceased fellow gangsters John Gotti or now Whitey Bulger are--they are gloating over their crimes in this appropriately angry documentary narrated by Matt Damon.  Primped and polished for the camera, not one of them expresses remorse and they go with the party line: the Central Bank is something to have faith in, not to distrust even when you're manufacturing money you know you don't really have, and bankrupting citizens who had houses and dreams with their wives and children--who are now on the street.<br /><br />The crisis was given a flag by the problems in Iceland--not counting the money, just cooking the books and collecting everything they could--(that's a short definition of Reaganomics)--and Wall Street was given more than ample warning.  What the gangsters did is pretty typical: they collected all the money they could, telling us everything was safe, and when everything finally rolled over in a tsunami of poverty in the US, they took the money and ran.<br /><br />I cannot understand a judicial system that allows these thugs--Feldstein, Greenspan, Mishkin, all of them--to walk free.  They are as guilty as any criminal involved in organized crime.  This is the logical conclusion of hypercapitalism, of the philosopies of Ayn Rand and Adam Smith. This will give you more information than five books on the subject and will most assuredly ruin your day.  As it should.  An absolutely essential film.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|This is not your average Beyonce cd. \\"4\\" is full of amazing vocals, melodic tunes and deep lyrics. It has an old school vibe to it. I can play it straight through. That, to me, signifies that it is a great cd. I love it. I'm sure you will too.
0307887960|5.0|The book was delivered quickly and since starting the diet I've lost 20 pounds. I don't crave sweets and I can actually pass up the cheese biscuits at Red Lobster! I'll be able to eat them later.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|I went into this book not knowing much about it. I had just read the description and it was on my Kindle recommendations. It sounded interesting, so I gave it a try! I was very please! The first half of the book goes a little slow...but hang on, because the last half will go so quickly and you will wish it never ended! I found myself changing my theories on \\"what happened and who did it\\" several times over during the book. The author has such a gift of making you second guess yourself and wonder just how it could have happened.    I did not find the way the book was written to be distracting at all, as some reviews have said. It is written from the view of Christine, in journal entries to herself. I would often forget I was reading a journal entry at all.     Definitely pick this book up if you like suspense and books that are hard to put down!
0811875555|5.0|'The Art of Tangled' is probably one of the best artbooks I've read...and I've read a lot of artbooks. Particulalry Disney and Pixar artbooks, that are all high quality...but this one features some amazing character artwork by Glen Keene...so I suppose I'm a little biased, as I love his work. BUT, regardless, the book is great. Excellent commentary on the artwork and movie, good variety of media, nice cover and binding with a decent dust jacket to boot. I'd recommend this book to ANYONE, whether they be Disney fans, Tangled fans, or art fans.
0671027344|4.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a very engaging story about a very endearing character. Almost from the beginning, the reader will fall in love with Charlie and his quirkiness. Although it is clear that he has some deeply rooted psychological issues, Charlie's zest for his experiences is addicting. Charlie truly values the relationships he has with the people in his life. He discusses in great detail his feelings for his family, his friends Sam and Patrick, and his encouraging teacher, Bill. He also describes other experiences ranging from masturbation to acid trips to fighting. In every detail, however, Charlie provides an unusual but realistic look at what many teens experience. Charlie's prose is a look at what teens might think or feel if they weren't inhibited by the need to appear \\"normal.\\" Charlie realizes that he's odd, but it doesn't change who he is or how he feels. Charlie's life and experiences draw the reader in, making the book difficult to put down. Teens and adults alike will find something in Charlie or in the people in his life to relate to. Charlie's friend Sam must struggle with the sexual victimization she received as a child. Her brother, Patrick, is dealing with being a closet homosexual who is in love with the high school's star athlete. Charlie's sister has an abusive boyfriend who threatens to abandon her he finds out she's pregnant. All of the characters in the novel are very relatable and create a rich and compelling cast for the plot. In The Perks of Being a Wallflower, Chbosky has created a fun, interesting, entertaining but also very sweet, sentimental and emotional read.<br /><br />I am a fan! This is a classic young adult novel that is also thoroughly enjoyable for adults. Charlie is one of the most endearing main characters ever written particularly because he is utterly quirky.  I am really looking forward to the movie version that is set to come out in 2012.<br /><br />Like my review? Go to my profile to find the link to my blog to see other books I recommend!I recommend!
B00150B2SS|5.0|Great thrilller, so well written it's sickening. Very few writers these days in this genre can actually write, Le Carre is the best of the best. Not much to say that hasn't already been said in the other reviews. Just buy this book, you will not be dissapointed!
B0050CQY1W|5.0|It's been nearly 3 years since Beyonce's last release, and while that was much too long of a time, it was well worth the wait! 4, in my opinion, is a natural progression of maturity in Beyonce's world view. It has more of a personal feel than ever, and does a phenomenal job of showcasing her nuances as a vocalist. Her vocals are as smooth as honey and leaves you wanting more. \\"1+1\\" is a power ballad and the perfect way to start things off. It's a highly emotional song and there is a palpable feel to the love she has for her (presumably) husband, bringing you right to the cortex of her heart. \\"I Care\\" shows a vulnerable side to Beyonce, and has beautiful lyrics with some amazing singing. \\"I Miss You\\" has an 80's ballad feel, leaving you with that late night desperation feeling. The synths in this song set the mood perfectly. \\"Best Thing I Never Had\\" features a sparkling piano and is about her triumph over a deadbeat boyfriend. \\"Rather Die Young\\" fuses Bey's remarkable vocals with fresh, crisp production which results in one of the albums most powerful songs. \\"Love On Top\\" blends horns, electronic instruments and captures her spirit in an amazing manner. \\"Countdown\\" is blessed with vocal harmonies by the guys from Boyz II Men and fit perfectly with the sounds of the rest of the songs. Overall, I think Beyonce stepped a little out of her comfort zone to record this album, and the risk paid off. She sounds incredible, the songs are mixed well, and she has the unique ability to make you FEEL the emotions she sings about. Highly recommended!!!!
B004Y8Y26C|5.0|After seeing the movie, I knew that I had to have the soundtrack. The music did not distract from the movie, but instead added a totally new layer to it. It is my favorite album to listen to while I am working in my classroom during my free time. The music is not distracting, but still allows me to pace myself while I am grading papers or writing lesson plans.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|Honestly I was late getting into Beyonce. At first she seemed so pushed in our faces,all glittery designer outfits and retread Diana Ross-style marketing. So the music just lacked the impact it needed because of that through my years. But in the past year,having digested Beyonce's album's chronologically from [[ASIN:B00006IWGY Dangerously in Love]] up through [[ASIN:B002QY9RMA I Am...Sasha Fierce]] I've not only seen a great progression and growth musically but a depth of creative character as well. Yes some of her minus qualities are still present:the lack of distinction between artist and near supermodel and some of her pushy persona. But on that later aspect of her personality it might be more to her advantage here. On her last album you saw her transitioning into an artist who was moving toward a less commercial outlook-strenghening the afro-funk/pop elements in her work as well. On this album she takes yet more leaps forward in that regard. Honestly I can't say if this album will produce the level of hits that her previous three did. Time will tell but it would be a sure sign the music industry's viewpoints on what constitutes as commercially viable R&B is improving.<br /><br />  Wrapping up in a short and sweet 46 minutes this album starts out with \\"1+1\\",\\"I Care\\" and \\"I Miss You\\". These along with \\"Rather Die Young\\" have no shortage of drama with their early 90's Phil Collins/Peter Gabriel progressive pop sound-minor chorded polyphonic synth sounds and all. They also show a strong change in lyrical focus. This \\"new\\" Beyonce has both eyes open to mortality,with somewhat of a blues inspired romanticism about death. \\"Party\\",the one collaborative number here with Andre 3000 has a more sly lyrical theme and a straight up blend of both Beyonce's interest in 80's synth funk and afro-beat music as well. Mixing music here in much the way an ice cream maker might blend different flavors to create a new one,Beyonce takes a lot of chances with the rhythmically challanging \\"Countdown\\"-a little afro-pop,a little hip-hop and some Take 6 style vocal harmony refrains to add the spice of the old black American acapella soul/gospel tradition. Same goes for the FULL ON Fela Kuti/JuJu funk styled \\"End Of Time\\"-it actually reminds one of where Mandrill,War and Santana once came at their grooves in bygone days. The music may be more modern but the flavor is totally up front.<br /><br />  And...okay so my personel favorite song here is \\"Love On Top'-STRAIGHT UP early 80's George Benson style sophistifunk/jazz-pop/boogie style music with a very strong lyric and hook. Doesn't have anything sonically or instrumentally to do with modern sounds no but some slightly modern production gives it..well let's just say if I was picking a possible hit from this album this would be it. Very much in the league of TLC's \\"Waterfalls\\",only without that tunes hip-hop inflections. Okay so 'Run The World (Girls)\\" might be taking the \\"girl power\\" ethic Beyonce's tended to follow to something of an extreme. But it's no frills afro-beat/hip-hop dance rhythms take the sound of \\"Single Ladies\\" from the previous album to the next level-even if the lyrics are more aggresive here than assertive as before. Overall it's a fine album. No bad songs here whatsoever and Beyonce uses all elements of her personality,the more endearing and the less flattering both to create a soulful and funky album where her twin personel identities are in a constant Marvin Gaye-styled state of flux. Perhaps not the most poppy type of album she's made. But certainly,along with her previous release the kind of thing myself and others I know have always hoped she'd embrace one day. And the fact she is looking to advance new directions in funk in all it's forms,seeing it as a creative entity as opposed to an outdated style of R&B is more than a plus in thaty regard as well.hmically challanging \\"Countdown\\"-a little afro-pop,a little hip-hop and some Take 6 style vocal harmony refrains to add the spice of the old black American acapella soul/gospel tradition.

B004DSX5B6|5.0|I like that all the tools are accessable, minus pliers, without having to unfold the  unit. All tools lock into position for safety. The pliers are spring assisted to open in the work mode. Thanks Bear Grylls and Gerber: good job on multitool and survival knife I purchased earlier.
B004V6BQ3O|3.0|It's made well enough & does what a general microphone should do...HOWEVER...my reason for purchase was to get rid of the autofocus-motor noise in my video recording (on a D7000). Since the recording field of this mike is a general/uni-directional pattern (more or less), any camera noise audible to your ears is still highly-audible on your recordings. The internal mics on the D7000 are good (and certainly comparable to what the ME-1 is, minus the low-cut filter & wind noise filter), so if your reason for buying this mic was like mine, I do not recommend purchasing the ME-1. To its credit, Nikon does say that the ME-1 helps reduce af-motor noise. They don't claim it will be eliminated. Perhaps this is true, technically. But, I suspect I'd want a mic I could hold farther away from the camera or a mic with a recording pattern that's much more forward (even then I have my doubts...). Anyway, this review is the one I wish I'd read before purchase -so I hope it's helpful to you!
B002JWD6AS|1.0|Okay, here's the deal with this book: It is pretty well written, but I'm a fan of true character development.  The book starts out with oblivious Grace and the mysterious Sam who is a 'werewolf', but then it seems to lag when it switches between the two main characters so it just doesn't add to the mystery of SAM. I mean, I honestly didn't know who's story was really being told.  I hate it when the author keeps switching back and forth and repeating what just happened already from the other character's POV. It's annoying and boring.<br /><br />I also thought it was going to be a lot more complicated of a love relationship between Sam and Grace.  I mean, the guy saved her life when she was little, you'd think the tension and complicated relationship would ensue but no, it doesn't last long as they already sleep together in this book. BOOORING.  I like a little bridled passion, you know? I also thought Sam would be a lot more of a chivalrous STRONG character than he was, but he was literally, following grace like a well behaved puppy dog. He was an ordinary, bum teenage boy.<br /><br />BUT, I do like the author's concept of this type of 'werewolf' and I DO like the other wolf characters in the book because they seem like they have more to them that the author lets on so the ONLY reason I would read the other book is to see what happens to THEM. I didn't fall in love with the main characters at all.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|4 is clearly Bey's most mature album to date. She decided to change her style a little and stop sounding like the poppy teenager of her past and has now released a personal album. Her vocal and personal growth is evident in every song. As a music lover, I am proud to have purchased this album!
B00427X9WI|5.0|Loved this movie!  I had read the book and loved it too, but Julia and Javier made it even better.
0060191325|5.0|I bought this book for my son and his wife because it has helped me and my husband understand each other better. I think that all women need to read this and find out that what your husband says isn't what you think he said.  Great book for anyone needing to understand the opposite sex better.
B004478GNI|5.0|Legos are always expensive, especially the premium sets like Star Wars.  My son (7) picked this one out himself out of all the $20 and under sets at the Lego store.  When assembled, it has movable wings and comes with the bad-guy pilot and the R2-Q2 robot.<br /><br />It took him about 1 hour to build, start to finish, with me helping to sort the pieces, correct a couple mistakes, and put the decals on.  Overall, it was a straightforward build and not too tricky.<br /><br />Once completed, the cockpit opens and closes using a hinge, and the wings on the rear sides rotate 90 degrees.  The grey parts of the wings can also be bent.  There are no shooting missiles.<br /><br />The pilot can fit in the cockpit even with his gun in his hand, which is nice.  R2-Q2 is slightly metallic in color, not just a plain grey.  With R2-Q2 as he's seen in the picture, you actually have to detach his head an only put the head on the ship in order to match the picture.  However, it does fit perfectly in that same spot fully assembled, he just stands on top instead of looking like he's down inside the ship.<br /><br />When resting on the ground, the ship only sits on one round 4-peg piece, so it's wobbly, but the piece is at the center of gravity of the ship.  The large pieces and simple construction make it pretty durable so it doesn't break apart easily.<br /><br />I did have some trouble with the decals and might call customer service to see if I can get a new set - they came kind of curled at the edges and therefore when applied, they keep curling up.  Just a tip on decals - wash the lego parts with some soapy water and dry, then put the decals on before assembling.  This will keep finger oils off the parts and they'll stick better.<br /><br />Overall, if you need a \\"bad guy\\" ship or just want a moderate-low priced set, this is a good choice.
B004BSFSTA|4.0|Sound quality of these headphones are great as you'd expect from Marshall and it feels as if you have 2 mini-Marshall amps on your ears (not to say they are heavy, they're actually surprisingly light!). However, they handle non-rock music surprisingly well and there's no over-emphasis on the bass so it's actually enjoyable to listen to. The only drawback is that they're a little tight on your head and since I wear glasses, it starts hurting after about half an hour to an hour into listening to music. Nonetheless, these headphones are built like a tank and unlike others, the connecter is actually protected by a spring sort of thing and coupled with a premium 1-year warranty, I highly doubt that these will break for the next several years.<br />tl;dr: buy them if you don't have glasses, if you do try them on first.
0439023513|3.0|Sweet ending, predictable. For the rest of the book I kept wondering when I was going to get to finally stop reading about the war. I felt it dragged on and on. Nice ending to the trilogy but not as good as I was expecting.
B004HO6HWK|5.0|You just can't ever go wrong with a Jason Statham movie if you looking for non-stop action.  Very entertaining movie and he's incredibly hot!!
B00425S1H8|5.0|I have tried in the past several USB to RS-232 adapters and usually I needed some research to make them working.  With this adapter I finish the setup in Win 7 32 bit environment in no time. Great experience with the great product.
B0050LJIRK|5.0|I have been a fan of them since I was in middle school and I have to say that I like this cd.  It reminded me a lot of Significant Other and Chocolate Starfish. Buy it if you are a true fan of Limp Bizkit
0439023521|5.0|I was completely engaged by every single page, paragraph, line, word in this book. The unfortunate part is that this is the strongest book in the series, so they do not get better from here. Still, an amazing read. I devoured this book in a couple of days.
B0029NY9YO|5.0|This movie is a great, brilliant and nearly perfect adaptation of the graphic novel.  The adaptation of the characters and the scenes from the graphic novel are also nearly perfect and the effects are pretty sick as well.      My only complaint about this movie is that it is nearly an exact copy of the graphic novel.  I think that the movie would have benefited from some outside the box thinking, perhaps a scene change or too, and perhaps not such a complete and rigid devotion to the graphic novel.      In my opinion, this is one of my favorite comic book adaptations as it is based off my favorite graphic novel, and is one of my favorite movies as well.  I do think that the movie can be slightly slow every and then and would have benefited from and additional fight or action scene or two.      I definately recommend this movie, as it is exciting, fast paced and is great.  The ending is even more awesome!  I also recommend that you get and read the graphic novel as it is one of the best comic's you will ever find.  In addition to being a great action flick, the movie is rife with the political overtones of the graphic novel and also retains its Utilitarian philisophical approach to forcing world peace.      Definately pick this movie up, you wont be disappointed!  Btw- Rorschach is the man!
B000YDPT4U|5.0|i have listened to these guys way back when but without any real interest - lately with my interest in audio i have re-kindleled my love for LZ! Here is the thing i too was curious like most between this album rendition vs the 90's release of explicitly on Stairway to Heaven. I did something totally off - i ripped both versions with iTunes at lossless and listened carefully (on a [[ASIN:B0054JJ0QW Bose® QuietComfort® 15 Acoustic Noise Cancelling® Headphones]] -  the moterhship version really tops it off! I like it! I did get the boxed CD set as well but haven't tested it yet! will do shortly and update this! but regardless LZ just sounds too cool in every era, format and disc type!
0618918248|5.0|A well written and thoroughly-researched guide to the atheism. This book provides the types of sound arguments that atheists need to firmly assert the logical correctness of their views.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|Loved the 1st book and loved this one as well.  Make sure you read the 1st one though, it supplements this one very well and gives much more insight into the characters.
0439023491|3.0|This was a good right. I wonder if I was so addicted to it off the strength of the first book, though. Meaning, if this was the first book in the series that I read, I probably would've given in 3 or 4 stars. The ending is abrupt. It's lacking the 'fire' of the first book.
B004SIP9Z6|5.0|This movie is an absolute must get.  It is one of the best movies you will possibly see and is amongst the best graphic novel based movies you will probably ever experiance.  The movie pays tribute to the great film Noir genre, throughout the movie, the director utilizes a series of predominantly black an white color palates while using color only for specific \\"popping\\" effect.      This movie has a wonderful gritty, deep, feel that perfectly portrays the dark underworld that it is narrating.  The cast in the movie is phenominal, and the acting is amazing.  This movie has the best of all possible worlds in movie making.. it has violence, a deep story line, sex, and action that keeps you wanting more and more.  The beginning scene of the movie leave you begging for more, the end scene leaves you stunned and the middle is just unbelievably amazing.      I have never read the graphic novel, seeing this movie certainly pushed me to go out and get it.  I absolutely loved this movie, and you will too, it is phenominal.. no plotholes here!  GO AND GET IT!!    Just a note if you can get the unrated collector's edition.  Appearantly movie companies think that people want an edited, censored version.. WTF, I hate when movies are censored and edited so they can make the R cut.. Just give us the unedited movie to begin with with a choice in teh menu for the edited version.. But no, they feel the need to double dip and make double profit off you... Get the unrated version, it is worth the extra money.
B004WOS3P4|5.0|Today is the release date of This Loud Morning (TLM). Waited a LONG LONG time for the 2nd RCA release from David Cook .. not disappointing at all!!  Every single tune carries weight and .. earworms ... HE'S BACK AND BETTER THAN EVER!!
B002JVWR0Y|5.0|There has never been a bad season of Dexter, just some better than others, all of which were rock star.  Season 4, however, takes it to a whole other level with veteran actor John Lithgow entering the fray.  His amazing levels of creepiness in front of the camera are unsurpassed.  Both he and Michael C. Hall play brilliantly off of one another, and as always, the surrounding cast provide solid deliveries of their characters as well.  All of this ultimately weaves one clever sub-story into another bringing about what is arguably the best season yet of Dexter.
0786956291|4.0|The key word here is beginners.  I played D&D 3rd Edition back around 2000 or so, and I only really played once or twice.  This starter set is perfect for me: an easy way to learnt he rules and get a basic character together without being intimidated.  The quality isn't incredible, but you can't argue with this price.  If you've played D&D recently, you probably don't want or need this.  But if you haven't played ever, or in a long time, this is perfect to get you into the game.  You get a solo quest (and my box came with another solo quest that can be downloaded from the D&D website), plus a quest for a few (the book suggests 4) low-level characters.  The first quest is a choose-your-own-adventure type quest that creates your character as you play and learn the rules.  Long story short: buy this if you are a beginner and/or want a simple version that you can pick up and play.  Don't buy this if you are familiar with D&D, just buy the essential books.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|I read it just because Robin Hobb recommended it....since she's my favorite fantasy writer, that was enough for me!  And the recommendation held true.  This is a wonderfully rich read....the flow of the words held me spellbound....and I stayed curious all the way through.  I especially loved the unabashedly romantic streak of the hero....something the male writers do not often enough share in their fantasy writing....at least in my experience.
034552554X|5.0|Intense. Sad. Destructive. Alienated...all these words describe our heroine, a young woman who has spent most of her life in the foster care system. We meet her as she is \\"aging out\\" of her last group home; through her first person narrative we see the world through her bleak vision. She's only describable in single words; she's so damaged she can't connect with others except through violence. She has a lovely, old-fashioned name: Victoria Jones.<br /><br />Victoria tells us two parallel narratives: how she lost her last chance of adoption and how she came to start her own florist business. The two stories are linked: in the first, her would-be mother teaches her the lovely and obsolete language of flowers as it was practiced back in the Victorian era. In the second, she takes this language and learns how to express love.<br /><br />It all hinges on a young man, Grant, who also speaks the language of flowers. He learned from his mother Catherine who was the elder sister of Elizabeth who would have been Victoria's adoptive mother except for that dire thing that happened.<br /><br />In coping with their own mother who left them a legacy of depression and mental illness, the two sisters learned to communicate with plants and pictures of flowers. In this way, they expressed those things that could not be spoken aloud. But something happened. The two sisters, although they are close neighbors and each has taken over half of the family business, have been estranged for years. They don't speak a word to one another--however they can still leave messages for each other via flowers stuck in the fence that divides them.<br /><br />Years later, the secret language of the sisters reaches new heights when Victoria, working an odd job for a local florist, encounters Grant in the morning flower markets. Grant literally speaks Victoria's language and courts her in the only way she is approachable.<br /><br />The love story between Grant and Victoria follows a predictable arc. But who could predict that from the muck and grief of Victoria's damaged childhood such loveliness, such hope, such love could spring? THE LANGUAGE OF FLOWERS entices us with the tender petals of spring, blossoms into full summer, dashes our hopes with a withering frost and bursts forth in new glory: roses at Thanksgiving. Highly recommended!grief of Victoria's damaged childhood such loveliness, such hope, such love could spring?

B003LWN8F8|5.0|So I was driving around today and had my local indie radio station on-- and that all-too-rare moment happened that we music lovers live for-- a tune came on that made me stop and say holy @%$#!#%, what's THAT SONG??  It turned out to be \\"I Am Not a Robot.\\"  Every track on Marina's album is a gem!  She simultaneously conjures up the spirits of the quirky innovative past like Annie Lennox, Queen, Kate Bush, Siouxsie, Toni Basil, Cyndi Lauper, and GaGa to name a few that immediately come to mind-topped off with a classical influence.  Of course, in order to achieve magic and authentic quirkiness, to simply channel these people would not be enough.  She plays piano, writes her own songs and skillfully manages the multilayered vocal tracks- there is plenty of opportunity to put her own signature on every beat.  The end result is unique & freshly executed songs with real artistic depth cleverly disguised as dance music.  It would be easy to dismiss it and enjoy the latter identity- but then you would be missing out-
B004EPYZUI|4.0|Zack Snyder has got to be one of the more ambitious directors around today. After doing a decent job retelling George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, making an awesome graphic novel-to-movie interpretation of 300, to making the love-or-hate, also graphic novel turned movie in The Watchmen; Zack Snyder has a good reputation of having style, if nothing else. But how does his own, original work fare? Well for most, not so well. Most have made plenty of comparisons to Inception and The Matrix. However, Snyder set out to make one thing: a movie that was to be fun, loud, and completely insane...and that's what he delivered. Is it original, no, but it is a fun movie that has some stellar action scenes with cool use of slow-motion. Outside of the action, the interpersonal stories of Babydoll, Sweet Pea, Rocket, Amber, and Blondie work for this type of movie. While the story isn't perfect, and has some plot holes, this is infinitely times better than some movie Hollywood puts out today. Style wins over substance with Sucker Punch, and sometimes, that's all a movie needs.     *The Extended Cut ( original R-rated version ) doesn't add much to the movie. You get an extra scene with Rocket and Babydoll, a couple extended fight scenes, and a more robust ending ( just because of the extra footage of the High Roller and Babydoll )     PQ- as with most Warner Bros. titles, Sucker Punch is a stunner. Reference material? Just about. When the girls are in the asylum, the colors are clear, but sometimes look a bit flat, skin tones look a bit pale, and grain occasionally rears (to some's taste, but not mine) its ugly head. I know that this is probably how Snyder wanted it to look, given the atmosphere. However, when the Babydoll an the other girls are in the fantasy worlds, LOOK OUT! Mainly due to the ambient pieces being CGI, and different cameras being in use, colors are bright, clear, and this shows the quality of Blu-ray. Black levels are dark without being indistinguishable, skin tones are spot on, and grain is a no-show. Overall, when watching this in a theater with a digital projector, I was blown away. Watching this at home on a 1080p t.v., I am speechless.     AQ- lossless audio, what a friend you are when watching a movie like this. Speech levels were perfect, gunshots were loud, and explosions will shake your speakers. Even the music that played in the background had awesome delivery. What else can I say. Even if you hate the movie, the sound field should make you a happy camper.     Extras- surprisingly light, but at the same time, informative. You have 4 animated shorts corresponding to the 4 different fantasy worlds that average around 2.5 minutes long. While neat with their motion comic design, they really didn't add anything to the main story, and while they are prequels to Babydoll and co.'s story, again, they could have been left out. Then there is an inside look at the soundtrack to Sucker Punch, which in essence, is a documentary on the atmosphere and the style of music they play. Although finding out Emily Browning, who played Babydoll, sang a few songs in the movie was really neat.     Overall, like The Watchmen, Sucker Punch will be a love/hate movie. I loved it, especially the actions scenes because they were fast, loud, and adrenaline-pumping. If you go into this movie expecting the next Nolan or Spielberg masterpiece, you will quickly be disappointed. Turn down or either switch off your brain for a couple of hours, and you should have a blast
192076920X|4.0|..especially if you've ever been to India or Bombay.   I really liked this novel.  It actually took me about 9 months to finish, and I'd usually read it before going to bed. It was a nice way to cap off the night.  The story is always interesting, but not so much so that I couldn't put it down and sleep finally.  But that's kind of in the nature of the story.   It's a mixture of action and spiritual/philosophical treatise, told in the first person and through a wide variety of characters. I found it oddly comforting (which again made it good reading before sleep), and of course a great kind of 'armchair traveling' that was fun to compare to my own much-less-involved travels in India.      Having finished it last night (and to be fair I was up until dawn doing that) I miss the book.  I could have gone on reading the saga for another 500 pages, and would have liked to have known what happened with the author in his planned trip to Sri Lanka and how he finally resolved things with the Australian authorities, etc.  Maybe that will be another book.  And one I'd pick up if it comes out.  Shantaram is a fun book - soulful and entertaining.

0345529057|5.0|First off stop griping around the price, the reason its more expensive is that Authors only get 10 cents on the dollar for every electronic book that someone buys, not only that but you are also buying a electronic license that gives you rights to download the book, share the book and give it to friends that have kindles. if you didn't want to pay the price , then buy the paper back books as I have done, even though I am a kindle owner. I know this might make someone mad but you are down rating these books because of what the publisher , not the author has done.<br /><br />ON that note, I am watching the HBO series and Love it cannot wait for my books to get here. I was going to order them on kindle but my Fiancee , who does not have a kindle wants to read them as well. So opted for the paperbacks. Great plot twists and original story line.

B0043ZDU1E|3.0|I was very excited to hear an album where Loreena McKennitt returns to her Celtic roots. While the album did not impress me as much as her release from a few years ago, \\"An Ancient Muse,\\" it still soars, especially in her version of \\"Down By The Sally Gardens.\\" The lesser songs are the shorter ones, while the two longest tracks, \\"The Wind That Shakes The Barley\\" and \\"The Death Of Queen Jane,\\" will remind fans of why they love McKennitt.
B004XCUEU2|5.0|I will have to say that I was not a Foo fan, I found some of their music ok.  I have become a Foo-natic after watching this.  I found it to be very insightful into Dave Grohls background with Nirvana and with the Foo Fighters. I also watched it commercial free on VH-1 when it first aired and have it saved to my dvr and watch it when ever there is nothing else on or I need a foo infusion. I am looking forward to their tour and seeing them live in the near future.   Thank you for this I love it
B0031QVW2U|4.0|I purchased the R4 strap and the first couple of times I used it I had no issues with the shoulder pad sliding forward. Eventually, though, I found that the shoulder strap would slip forward not only when shooting from unorthodox positions, but during normal photography as well. It may not bother someone to simply move the shoulder pad back onto your shoulder, but it's an extra step that I'm not pleased with having to do. So I tried the BRAD and do not have the shoulder pad sliding issue. Note that the addition of the BRAD does add extra strap bulk if you have a compact or limited room camera case. If you're annoyed with the shoulder pad sliding on your Black Rapid strap, then this will help.
B004XWMXX8|5.0|Selena Gomez is simply a star.<br /><br />She is blossoming out of her Disney career with grace and maturity, and this album proves it. The music on this album shows Selena in a new light. We all know Selena as a great teen actress, but this album truly shows how musically talented she is. Her first two albums were great, but you could see that she was struggling to find her signature sound. \\"When The Sun Goes Down\\" is a fantastic electro-pop album that is complete with all sorts of songs about love, heartache, and accepting yourself.<br /><br />The album starts out with the unexpected and fresh \\"Love You Like A Love Song\\" in which Selena sings about a lover who makes her feel more mesmerized than her own music collection. \\"Bang Bang Bang\\", \\"Who Says\\" and \\"We Own The Night (featuring Pixie Lott)\\" are all great mid-tempo tracks that ease the listener into in Selena's soulful, unique voice. \\"Who Says\\" is Selena's most inspiring song on the album, which also features some of her best raw vocals to date.<br /><br />\\"Hit The Lights\\" is a song about letting go of the past, and pursuing your dreams in the moment. It also serves as the gateway into the faster tempo remainder of the album. \\"Whiplash\\" is a strange and insanely catchy love song that was penned by Britney Spears. The title track is a fun techno-vibe song that is fun to dance to. \\"My Dilemma\\" stands out as a rock-edged song that describes a crazy relationship and highlights Selena's upper vocal range.<br /><br />Selena's spunky personality shines in \\"That's More Like It\\" which is a female empowerment song written by Katy Perry. \\"Outlaw\\" is a western themed electro-pop song that has an undeniably fantastic hook. \\"Middle Of Nowhere\\" is a powerful dance song with sad lyrics, making a unique combination. The album closes with \\"Dices\\" which highlights Selena's Mexican heritage and her beautiful vocals.<br /><br />While \\"Kiss & Tell\\" was a scattered album that couldn't settle on one sound, and \\"A Year Without Rain\\" found Selena stuck in a sea of auto-tune, \\"When The Sun Goes Down\\" gives longtime fans and music lovers alike a real look into the mature artist that is Selena Gomez. She can contend with the best of 2011's pop divas with this album, and, at the same time, be in a league all her own.<br /><br />If you love catchy pop from a grounded and good role model, then Selena Gomez's latest release is a must-have. Her voice has grown leaps and bounds along with her talents as an actress, fashion designer, and public figure. Selena never tries to push the envelope or be something that she is not. \\"When The Sun Goes Down\\" is a fantastic album that gives her audience a soundtrack to their own lives.\\"When The Sun Goes Down\\" gives longtime fans and music lovers alike a real look into the mature artist that is Selena Gomez.

B0056BMK6K|4.0|This book introduced me to John Locke. Yesterday, I knew him as the phenom that sold a million books on Amazon as a self publisher. Today, I got to know him. His work ethic is inspiring and I wonder how he is able to balance it all in a 24 hour day.<br /><br />I have never read a Donovan Creed novel, though I own one. I might get to it eventually.<br /><br />As for this book, it's common sense advice on e-marketing told through the good and hearty soul of John Locke. His personality really shows and I found that I quickly appreciated the man behind the novels. There's nothing new to learn from this book that one can't already find on the net, but it has helped me fine tune ideas of how I currently plan to market my first novel.<br /><br />Four stars goes to him for getting me to actually go to his website, providing him with my email, and considering buying more of his books.

B004GUSG4M|5.0|I didn't buy this book at first because I knew it was a debut novel and $12.99 (Kindle version) seemed like a lot of money for a debut.  But, I am so glad I changed my mind.  It has been a long time since I read a book that I didn't want to put down.  It's an easy read but well written and absolutely kept my interest from beginning to end.  The author made it very easy for me to put myself in Chrissy's place and imagine what it would be like to wake up and not have any memories.  I highly recommend this book.
038572179X|5.0|I cannot recommend Atonement highly enough.  It ranks up there as one of my all-time favorite books.  I actually read this book several years ago, but felt compelled to write a review when I saw some of the (bad) reviews on this site.  Atonement is a compelling historical novel set during WWII.  The setting provided an amazing feel for the book, and allowed the characters to be fully developed as the book follows each of their involvement in the war.  This book's ending definitely made the book what it was - totally amazing and breathtaking.  This is one of the very few books that made me cry while I was on the bus, headed in to work.  I also recommend this book to my Mom, who is a tough critic, and she also loved it.  That's a good sign.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|This movie was suppost to blow you away visually. I wasn't expecting to walk in and think that it was going to have an epic story plot, just by watching the trailers. I kept my mind open to it. The reason why I didn't give a \\"5 star\\" was that I thought the whole emotional scenes were a bit over acted and sort of lame. And the fact how there was no \\"big\\" conclusion/fight at the end (which was was expecting/dissapointed not to see them kick some more ass.) I am a big movie go-er, and enjoy acting myself. I look for things not very many other see. But this movie was vistually/musically/and fashionably there for me. 110%!! It inspired me to look forward to more movies like this one. I hope Jack Snyder comes out with another visually stunning piece of work such as Sucker Punch. Definatley buying the blu-ray/DVD combo pack. Can't wait to see the extras too. :)

B004H8GLXQ|5.0|I just finished The Thirteenth Tale this morning and I LOVED it!  I recommend it highly.  It had some parallels to The Shadow of the Wind, which I also loved.  Both stories revolved around books (both main characters' fathers owned bookstores which they worked in) and hidden pasts that are slowly teased out.  But that's where the similarities end, they are both unique and amazing books.  I found myself really looking forward to reading The Thirteenth Tale every moment I could.  I wouldn't say it was a \\"page-turner\\" per se, but it was an engrossing read and I was very anxious to find out the answers to so many of the questions that were brought up throughout the story.  The characters were well developed and the story was just grisly enough to touch on some nasty stuff that kept you really intruiged.  Overall I loved it and think you need to read this book!
0811875040|3.0|I preordered this book and was delighted with the look and format. Gorgeous photos, scalloped pages, and nice graphic design add up to a pretty package. I actually have 6 inch cake pans and I love the idea of creating smaller cakes. Since we're a three-person household, this idea seems inspired.     However, I am also disappointed with the editing so far. I started with the yellow cupcakes and the buttercream. The buttercream turned out fine, although I was almost derailed by the editing error having to do with the sugar syrup. Her trick for flavoring raspberry icing is a keeper, beautiful color and great flavor. The cupcakes were a disaster though. They didn't rise properly. I thought maybe my baking powder had gone bad, but I made another batch from different recipe (Yellow Cake from Rose Levy-Beranbaum's Cake Bible) and they turned out fine. It is possible that I mismeasured something, but seeing that other people have discovered errors too, it may not have been me. I'll try it again soon and check back in.     I feel so sorry for Ms. Ray and the other authors. Clearly, they went to great pains to write this book with an eye towards making these recipes accessible for the average home baker. But someone dropped the ball on this one. The buttercream recipe is called for in almost every cake in the book! You'd think that the copy editor would've paid special attention to it. These errors undermine confidence in the recipes and make it difficult to commit to trying them.  The publisher owes us an apology and a website or email with a list of edits and fixes.    One note to my fellow Amazon reviewers: it might be helpful if you clearly note whether or not you've tried any of the recipes from the book. I, too, was charmed by the design and packaging of the book, but if the recipes don't work, the book might not deserve 5 stars.
1433524619|4.0|I am loving all of the notes and illustrations.  It has been a great study tool while going through the Bible.  My only complaint is that it is heavy and I feel it is a little obnoxious to lug around with me daily.
B003UESJEM|5.0|Well acted movie focusing on one company and layoffs of several key figures that made good money and what do they do now. I liked the scene where Affleck was talking to his wife and she said we never seen you before and now you are here-it was like the family was re-learning each others characteristics.  Affleck says to his wife he apoligizes for all this and she says it is not his fault and he says it was.<br /><br />The alternative ending-I can see why it was not added to the movie.<br /><br />If you were touched with unemployment(or not)you will like this very adult drama.<br /><br />Affleck at his best!
B001GKJ2FW|4.0|I love this film - I got hooked the first time I watched it on regular DVD and must say it's my next best favorite (my favorite being Mary Poppins.)  I really do like musicals and this one is great.  I like all the extras on the Blu-ray. Information I would normally had to look up on a search engine. I do have to say I didn't notice a whole lot of difference in quality from the DVD and the Blu-ray after watching both on a Blu-ray machine, which is why I give it 4 stars not 5.
B0055OK2T0|1.0|An engrossing short story from the 1950's by Philip K. Dick transmuted into a piece of politically correct claptrap. BTW...Anybody else notice that Damon's hot shot poltical character bore more than a passing resemblance to a grasping, entitled, self-indulgent Anthony Weiner type whose sole reason for running for political office is about agrandizing himself? \\"Heaven\\" help us indeed...
B003J6S3II|5.0|I'm new to the Doctor! I love the fact that thus far I'm not offended by the content, no nudity, foul language etc. It is suspenseful and scary at times, so I would say it's okay for kids 13 and older. This episode was fun and fantastical, just what one would expect from Doctor Who.
0553582038|1.0|GRRM spends too much time focusing on characters (both old and new) that readers will have a hard time caring about especially coming from the end of Storm of Swords. There's no mention of Tyrion or Daenerys, and only brief mentions of Jon Snow. It's very hard to care about these new characters, who are introduced at a feverish pace, when nothing is mentioned about the characters we do care about.    And the character arcs are belabored to the point of outright frustration. Cersei's arc did not need repeated chapters of foreshadowing. Brienne's wandering is sheer navel-gazing boredom, ending with a cheap cliffhanger. Sure, the plot moves forward (at glacial pace), but was it a story that needed 700 pages to be told. Absolutely not.
B0050CQY1W|1.0|After listening to beyonce 4 album, I come to realize that her record label company was right, they wanted her to waited before releasing the album because there wasn't enough top charting hits and the album will not be very successful at all and they were right. This is not a good album not worth waisting money on. for a very long time beyonce was the lead singer of destiny child's and had michelle and kelly as her back up but michelle and kelly in my opinion are better singers than beyonce and her dad knew that but because of beyonce that he had to put beyonce out front but michelle and kelly are doing far much better than beyonce. so if beyonce going to switch it up with something different  take the record label advice because they know about producing music and she dont.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I didnt even hear about this movie until yesterday when I saw the trailer for it. It came out today and I picked up the extended blu ray edition that includes blu ray/exteneded cut, dvd and digital copy. I was shocked, this is probably one of the best movies Ive seen this year. Id defanitley recommened you give this a view, Im sure it's a you like it or hate it type of movie but I must say I think the majority will like it. Action, Great acting, great surprise. Hope this helped.

0756659841|5.0|My son enjoys anything Lego.  What he doesn't realize with this sticker book is that he's also trying to decode and match the unfamiliar stickers labeled silhouettes with their labeled sticker counterparts.  I highly recommend using a razorblade to remove the sticker pages from the back of the book - it makes placing them much easier. Now that he's completed all of the stickers we enjoy reading about all of the characters (a short bio is given next to each figure).
B004L03B3S|5.0|This is one of those films I had been meaning to see for a while, and now wonder what took me so long. It is a Brazilian love story put simply. It tells the story of two brothers, who from the moment they set eyes on one another form a bond that is unbreakable.<br /><br />Their mother has remarried, so they actually have different fathers, but even she thinks that the closeness of their relationship is odd. They seem to do everything together, and both have a love and talent for swimming. This leads the younger to be chosen to swim in the Olympics. On his return the enforced separation brings the brotherly love of youth, screaming into adulthood, as emotions take on a more physical nature.<br /><br />That is obviously not the whole thing, there are family emotions and grief, but this is all told in a beautifully poetic way. This is presented as a moving love story, the participants just happen to be half brothers. It has a wonderful musical score too and is both shot and acted superbly. It is in Portuguese with English sub titles, only one problem is when there is some Spanish it comes up in Portuguese, but that didn't really put me off as it is basic stuff.<br /><br />I see a lot of films, and there are very few that leave you feeling so enriched after viewing. I can not recommend highly enough, the time flew by and I intend to watch again in the very near future.
B000A1SZ2Y|4.0|I actually like the vignetting on a non-telephoto.. takes some patience, but overall, best for the price, no second thoughts
0345529057|5.0|I started reading this series of books after watching a couple of episodes of \\"Game of Thrones\\" on HBO.  Luckily, the series very closely follows the books.  I am now almost through the 4th book and have pre-ordered the 5th.  These books have it all, excitement, romance, suspense, horror even some humor.  I find it difficult to put them down.  If you like sword and sorcery, romance and suspense, you will love these books.  Awesome books!
B0057AOS3I|2.0|Nope! wouldn't buy the entire CD. I would download maybe three of the 12 songs; four songs at the most.
B00005JLK1|4.0|For a ghost story I love this movie, it keeps you interested. Since everyone has explained the movie, I wont have to here, not that I would anyway. This movie has its gore, scarey and creepy moments, unexpected plot twists, and death. Its a good ride for the cost of a bowl of popcorn, and an evening. Now lets turn out the lights, and go on that sea cruise!
B002CVQAX6|5.0|Its like any other movie, some people will love it  others, not so much.I think it is excellent.Some may be put off a little by some of the language, but I don't feel it was out of place or gratuitous.It was interesting to me that Julianna Margolis and Ron Eldrad were actually a couple at the time the  movie was made. Not that it is significant, I just found it of interest.I just found it very entertaining.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I've only written a handful of reviews but have read hundreds of books.  THIS book was awesome, I have to say!!  Love the bad boy/good girl theme and the tats don't hurt.  Great JOB!
B004EPYZUI|5.0|This movie is genius, it is one of the most unique movies I have ever seen and that says alot since nowadays we get the same recycled garbage every month, same story, different characters.  The reason why all the critics gave this movie a bad review is because they have become blind to what a film is actually supposed to be.  Films are supposed to shock you, move you, make you angry, make you cry, they aren't made to give you what you WANT, they give you the artists vision.  I know I am not the only one that thinks the film industry has been putting out 90% total garbage, and there is really hardly any creativity to be found.  People hate what they don't understand, I foresee that Zack Snyder will be a film legend in the future, but for now he has to be hated because he is pushing the boundaries.  GREAT MOVIE!
B000OVLBHG|5.0|I have to say this is a great movie from many stand points. This is a circular story about raw recruits eventually taking the place of the people that trained them, and their stories. The bugs- way cool, and dangerous. The movie is supposed to make you uneasy, the uniforms (ww2 german) the propaganda, the reruiting commercials, requirements for citizenship, the rigidity and the rules of the society (what you can not do if you are not a citizen) all designed to make you think, most of it quite over the top and funny. This is a great film. Now, come on! Do you want to live forever!
1439107955|5.0|A truly readable and scholarly work!  If you are interested in the history of medicine, and specifically the complexities and changes in approaches to treating cancer over the last century and beyond, you will find this book a treasure.
B000PMLFRA|3.0|Amazon, will you PLEASE stop being lazy and heaping in the old DVD reviews with the (yet to be released!) blu-ray reviews?!!! VERY confusing and has people thinking we will get the original (and superior) cuts of the trilogy when in fact that's not the case. Creates needless confusion and would be easy for you to change...... To others who also find this irritating I advise letting Amazon know - if enough of us complain perhaps they'll finally get around to addressing this problem.    Since I have to give a rating, I'll give it a 3. I adore the original films but despise the constant OCD tinkering that Lucas has done to them since 1997. If the film (as he said in his interviews in 1997) is now finally finished, why keep changing it? I resent films being treated like bits of software and 'upgraded' at regular intervals (thereby - I assume - meaning the old(er) versions are now obsolete!). Lucas has proved he doesn't quality control his films either or can't be bothered to make an effort for his audiences - if he did he would have gotten the look of the CGI Jabba correct in the 1997 version (not to mention Yoda in The Phantom Menace!), and not had to redo it for the 2004 DVDs. Ditto the third attempt at getting the Greedo scene correct. If he's such a genius/perfectionist film-maker he would have gotten those right when he had the chance to fix them in 1997. And if he wasn't happy with some of the 1997 effects he was certainly happy to let us pay to watch them in the cinemas again, and to own them on VHS and laserdisc for many years...    George, just COMPLETE these films already and then LEAVE THEM ALONE!!! Leave Star Wars alone - in my humble opinion it's been run into the ground over the past decade and horribly cheapened. Move on - do something new! And allow ALL cuts to be available on bluray so the paying consumer has the CHOICE of which version to watch - it would get rid of all these tiresome fanboy arguments overnight! If Spielberg can do this with E.T. and Close Encounters, or Sir Ridley Scott with Blade Runner there is ZERO reason why you cannot also offer this too. By not allowing this you make a mockery of your stance on film preservation not to mention those whose hard work was digitally replaced.....
B004UC1WN8|5.0|Jenny's sixth english studio album includes some of her best material yet. The problem though is that people had already heard a great proportion of the album due to it being delayed and songs (Mainly unfinished) leaking but anyway it's still a great romp of a listen:     On The Floor - 10/10 - A fantastic comeback single which is unique, sassy and a floorfiller - summer smash     Good Hit - 9/10 - Though the chorus is a little annoying this again is a sexy and confident jam with good lyrics     I'm Into You - 10/10 - Summer in a song - this is brill with a memorable hook and gorgeous lyrics and a sexy video!!     (What Is) Love? - 10/10 - A great track from her film 'the back up plan' with fantastic verses and a mega chorus     Run The World - 6/10 - This song starts of brilliantly but the chorus is a letdown - it could have been much better     Papi - 10/10 - The next single which is a guaranteed hit with latino influences and a fierce beat with a fab chorus     Until It Beats No More - 10/10 - A sensation ballad which shows off her vocal range and should be a christmas single     One Love - 8/10 - A song talking about her many relationships which is catchy and a good reflective tune     Invading My Mind - 9/10 - A fab track but Gaga's influence is clear as it's not Jennifer's norm but still great     Villain - 7/10 - Perhaps the weakest album track with nothing too memorable - the chorus though is very good    Starting Over - 10/10 - This song is so unique and catchy yet is inspirational and deserves to be a single     Hypnotico - 10/10 - This song is pure fire and is addictive. This could be a future hit     Everybody's Girl - 9/10 - A great song but the demo was better as it was faster but still a great little tune     Charge Me Up - 10/10 - Absolute fire that should be on the standard as Jen is fierce, confident and really lets rip     Take Care - 6/10 - A weak song that could have been sung by anyone and that gets annoying after a few listens     Overall, Jen's back with her best album yet and in relation to the title 'Love?' all i can say is that if you buy this album you will love it!!!

0143106287|5.0|In Jane Austen's time, young women were taught that it was practically their duty to \\"marry well\\" -- someone of at least equal social/financial standing.<br /><br />But if a woman turned down a suitor for being poor, she ran the risk of losing the man she loved. That's the problem for Anne Elliott, the heroine of Jane Austen's final novel \\"Persuasion\\" -- a delicate romance that takes place AFTER the romance, rejection and heartrending sorrow. There's some slight roughness around the edges, but the story and the characters are simply brilliant.<br /><br />Eight years ago, Anne Elliott was engaged to the handsome, intelligent and impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth, but was persuaded to dump him by the family friend Lady Russell.<br /><br />Now she's twenty-seven (ancient by the time's standards), and her vain father Sir Walter is facing financial ruin. So he decides to relocate to Bath and rent out the vast family estate -- and it turns out that the new tenant is Frederick's brother-in-law. Of course, Anne still loves Frederick, but he doesn't seem to feel the same, especially since he's rumored to be interested in some younger, flirtier girls.<br /><br />And Anne's worries increase when she joins her family in Bath, where her father is attempting to live the lifestyle he feels he deserves (since he's a baronet). His heir, William Elliott, recently reestablished contact with his relatives -- and he seems very interested in Anne. But Anne suspects that he has ulterior motives... even if she doesn't realize how Frederick truly feels about her.<br /><br />It's pretty obvious that Jane Austen wrote \\"Persuasion\\" late in her life -- not only is Anne Elliott older than her other heroines, but she seems to have been more sympathetic to women who bowed to society's \\"persuasions.\\" This was the last book that Austen wrote before her untimely death, and it was only published posthumously.<br /><br />As a result, the book can be a little rough and the story is rather simple. But Austen's writing is still intense and powerfully vivid. Her prose is elegant and smooth, and her dialogue is full of hidden facets. The half-hidden love story of Anne and Frederick is among Austen's most skillful writing (\\"I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever\\"), and it's virtually impossible not to be moved by it.<br /><br />And Austen went out of her way to praise the self-made man, who got ahead through merit instead of birth (something that bugs Sir Walter). She also pokes holes in social climbers, vain aristocrats (\\"Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did\\"), nasty family and false friends.<br /><br />Anne herself is a very rare heroine, both then and now -- she's past her designated \\"marriage\\" years and would have been considered a lost cause. But she remains remains kind, thoughtful, quiet, intelligent, and as time goes on she starts to appreciate her own judgement instead of being \\"persuaded.\\" And Captain Wentworth is a vibrant portrayal of a strong man who worked his way to the top, but had to do so without the woman he loved.<br /><br />Jane Austen's last finished novel is a little rough in places, but the exquisite beauty of Frederick and Anne's love story is simply staggering. Truly a masterpiece.powerfully vivid. Her prose is elegant and smooth, and her dialogue is full of hidden facets.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|After the disaster that was St. Anger, Metallica wisely abandoned long-time producer Bob Rock and sought out Rick Rubin to produce an album that is not only their most satisfying effort since Load [Very underrated album] but is also so good that it deserves to be played alongside their classics from the 80's!! Hell, This album is actually BETTER than Kill Em All!!!!!!!! With the annoying snare drums of the previous album behind them, Metallica gets back to doing what they've always done best: ROCK WITH RECKLESS ABANDON! If you still haven't checked this album out yet due to the displeasure you most likely felt when you heard St. Anger, Let me tell you now: METALLICA HAS TOTALLY REDEEMED THEMSELVES HERE!!!!! Out of the 10 songs here, There is not one terrible song to be found and like the albums that Metallica made back in the 80's, You can listen to this album from start to finish without ever hitting the skip button!!! Every song on this album is good to great to even excellent but the best songs are All Nightmare Long [Love that instrumental section in the middle!!!!!], Broken Beat and Scarred, The Day That Never Comes, My Apocalypse [A quasi-throwback to the Kill Em All-style speed metal Metallica did earlier in their career], That Was Just Your Life [Just one listen to this first song on the album and you'll know for a FACT that Metallica is back in full force!!!!], The Judas Kiss, and Suicide and Redemption [The first instrumental on a Metallica album in 20 years is an amazing piece of music that BEGS to be heard in its entirety even if it is almost 10 minutes long!!!!!!!!!!]. The Unforgiven III, while not a bad song, is the least of the bunch but it is better than Unforgiven II!!! After listening to this album the whole way through i was reminded of why i am such a huge Metallica fan: These 4 guys are highly skilled musicians who're arguably the best in the world at what they do!! I know that many of the older Metallica fans gave up on Metallica after St. Anger but i'm BEGGING you to put St. Anger in the past and go pick up a copy of this album ASAP as it is certainly destined to become a classic within the years to come!!! I'm willing to bet that wherever Cliff Burton is right now that he can only be smiling at Metallica for what they were able to accomplish with this album. Note: This album marks the official debut of bassist Robert Trujillo [He was in Metallica when St. Anger was released but he didn't get to play bass on that album].

B0000399WI|5.0|Directed by Frank Darabont. Starring Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton.<br /><br />I just finished reading one of the novelettes by Stephen King, \\"Rita Hayworth & the Shawshank Redemption,\\" from the collected stories of \\"Different Seasons.\\"  I was pleased to see that many of the points of the novel were not changed in the movie.<br /><br />Though the book has its dark moments, the movie is even darker.  And though I won't compare the book too much, I may allude to it from time to time in this short review.<br /><br />Plot:  Overall, it's about Andy Dufresne, a banker who had the unfortunate fate of being married to a woman who was cheating on him.  The book portrays Andy as a quiet man that the jury in his trial mistook for being cold and calculated.  As in the novel, the prosecutor goes over Andy's claim that he loaded a gun and then threw it away.  More likely, says the prosecutor, Andy shot the victims four times, reloaded and shot them again.<br /><br />Andy is totally railroaded.  Even though it's only a short part of the film, I'm sure that trials such as these will resonate with an audience.  Trials and being fair are part of the constitutional system of law in the United States.  To see it perverted and throwing a man into prison, two life terms, is quite a criticism of that system.<br /><br />The second guy in the mix is Warden Norton and his thugs as they run Andy so tight; they let him have his library and some semblance of protection from \\"bull rapists\\" as long as Andy keeps fixing the books for Norton's under-the-table schemes.  This is an interesting part of the tale - not only does Norton continue his criminal ways, but he also hides behind his Bible and his righteousness.  Scary.<br /><br />(Spoiler) There is a part of the tale where a prisoner, Tommy Williams, knows who actually killed the couple that Andy is accused of killing.  Andy sees this as an opportunity to provide his innocence.  The Warden Norton will have none of it.  In the book Williams is transferred.  In the film, Norton has Williams assassinated under the guise of \\"escaping.\\"  Pretty thrilling yet amazing what some will do to protect their own interests, even at the sacrifice of others' freedoms.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  The story goes on, being narrated by \\"Red\\" his only friend, with some amazing acting skill by the veteran actor James Whitmore as a prisoner who's been locked up for fifty years.  The running joke of the Parole Board, the viciousness of the prisoners and the guards and the hypocrisy among the warden and his staff are very evident, very entertaining and shocking at the same time.

So glad I did!<br />I've never felt compelled to write a review but this app deserves a great review.
B002BGFUPQ|4.0|I love all of the Fast and the Furious movies, but I was very hesitant to watch Tokyo Drift based on all of the negative reviews it's gotten. I'm glad I took the risk and bought it anyway. It seemed like a very bad idea to make another movie and not have Paul Walker in it, but Sung Kang more than makes up for his absence. Han is easily the best character in the movie, and it's a shame that he wasn't the lead. This movie has some really nice looking cars, and I'd say Han's RX7 has to be the best looking car in the series. The races are fun to watch, and it's amazing that most of the driving in the movie is real. There are some pretty lame parts in the movie, like the prize in the first race and also the fact that Sean just walks into a school in Tokyo without knowing a word of Japanese, but it is just a movie. Its job is to entertain, and it does exactly that. The picture quality of the Blu Ray is perfect.

B0052UZIFA|2.0|Popcap's utter disdain for the Android platform couldn't be made any more evident than in this lazy port of Plants vs. Zombies when it's compared to the iOS version. The lack of the Zen Garden or any of the other content that isn't the main game leaves this ridiculously unfulfilling once you've beat it once, especially for someone who's played it on the PC. All other platforms have the ability to acquire money through the Zen Garden or the various minigames, while Android users are left to grind 1-1 mindlessly and bank off of Marigolds.    An update that includes the Zen Garden and minigames would bump this review to 4 stars, possibly 5 if it includes some lag fixes and optimizations. As it stands, it's just a bitter pill to swallow.
1439102724|1.0|I stopped reading this book once the main character \\"decided\\" she was a lesbian--and that's pretty much what she did. How many times have I heard, \\"No one would choose this lifestyle,\\" and yet that seems to be what the main character did. After all, she was married for many years and had had a typical courtship and marriage (until she became obsessed with having a baby). Also, she had never displayed any homosexual tendancies growing up, which is why her mother was so shocked--and yet accepting of the idea almost immediately, which doesn't really ring true. If one's sexual identity is formed by the age of 3, how could she not have had gay tendancies growing up? I think it argues against the theory that gays are born gay, which at least elicits some sympathy or understanding from the straight population: there's a reason for being gay; gay people have no choice but to be attracted to members of the same sex. Promoting the idea that a woman can suddenly become a lesbian promotes the idea that gays can become \\"ungay\\" as well.
B0017WCG48|5.0|Let me preface this by saying that I have not until now been compelled to write a review on Amazon.  Master of Puppets is a masterpiece.  If you disagree, schedule an emergency appointment with a neurologist or some such medical professional; you are clearly out of your gourd.      That said, I don't really have anything to say about the music.  Rather, I am writing only to set the record (no pun intended) straight on the sound quality of this 2LP edition.  Several reviewers have said that the sound on this release is overly compressed, lacking in treble, and generally horrendous.  But based on a cursory listen, I am concerned for their collective auditory well-being.  These records sound fantastic.  The fidelity is flat-out stunning, and I'm running a pretty unimpressive sound system.  I can only assume that the aforementioned listeners were playing the discs on 33-1/3 RPM, or perhaps they use damp blankets in lieu of traditional speaker grilles.     If you love Metallica and have a halfway-decent system (and know how to operate it properly), don't hesitate to grab this super hi-fi version of \\"Puppets\\".  You won't be disappointed.    -J

B0002O06NA|5.0|After Brothers, The Big Come Up (The Black Keys first album); Rubber Factory is a perfect addition to the start of a Black Keys collection. Fans of the Brothers album will enjoy Rubber Factory and The Big Come Up.<br /><br />The Black Keys don't want to be known as a Blues band, their comment, how many people buy blues albums? From a pure marketing label perspective, Dan and Pat are absolutely correct. But from a music standpoint, there is no denying The Black Keys are solidly rooted in the Blues. They've made the Muddy Waters style of blues accessible to a huge audience.<br /><br />The vinyl edition of Rubber Factory is excellent, or the way this music should be heard. What I've missed in the CD and MP3 releases is the feeling of wide a slightly echo harsh factory. In the vinyl release I can hear where they recorded this album; there is a dirty factory feeling to the whole thing. Pat's excellent drum playing is perfectly mixed with Dan's guitar playing. The vocals take a back seat to the music. The vocal sound is more like an old blues microphones pushed through a tiny old tube amplifier PA system.<br /><br />The best part of The Big Come Up and Rubber Factory, the recordings are a bit raw. The energy of these two playing together was not produced out with a pristine studio recording. This isn't a live album, but it has some of that same feeling. Brothers is a whole different recording, it is fairly well produced, meant for more mainstream play, but isn't a sellout.<br /><br />I am a Black Keys fan. I started listening to them heavily after the Nissan ad during the winter Olympics and their interview on NPR (all three of their interviews are available on the NPR website, well worth listening). These three albums are by far my favorites. Dan and Patrick still play songs from Rubber Factory during their concerts - there has to be something great about this album standing the test of time. Stack Shot Billy, 10AM Automatic, and The Girl Is On My Mind were on the set list during their 2011 tour.<br /><br />The album includes a code to download MP3's. They are reasonably good quality files. It's a nice bonus that I can listen to this album over a really fine stereo when I want to listen; and then take the songs with me when I travel. The thick glossy paper record sleeve has lyrics printed on one side. The layout is supposed to look like they wrote the lyrics on a piece of paper, including scratch outs.<br /><br />The album is 180gram vinyl. The pressing I have isn't perfect; there were a few pops and crackles here and there. There was an annoying skip on one track; I just need to do a second deep clean of the album. The tracks are packed fairly tightly; Fat Possum chose to publish this as a single album. Most really good record companies are moving to three or four sides for this much content.<br /><br />The Black Keys are an outstanding group. I'm so happy to see that they have not sold out their music with Brothers. Let's hope leaving Akron, Ohio doesn't change them for the worse. Rubber Factory is one of their better albums.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000X23JVC The Big Come Up [Vinyl]]]<br />[[ASIN:B003F5WOEC Brothers (2 LP w/Bonus CD)]]The album includes a code to download MP3's.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I've watched the 1995 A&E version of Pride and Prejudice many times, and I never get tired of it, mainly because of Colin Firth, whom I adored in the part. Because of that, I put off for a very long time until just recently watching this version. First, I did not think the actors could possibly measure up and second, it is an abridged version, so a great deal of the story would inevitably be sacrificed. I had also heard about the infamous kiss at the end of this version.<br /><br />I am happy to report that I enjoyed this film for its own sake. Relatively short though it is, Macfadyen and Knightley offer a lovely take on the romance. They are both very attractive people who are young enough to be very near the actual ages of the characters, and their chemistry is wonderful. Macfadyen especially does a wonderful job with soulful, smouldering looks that suit Darcy perfectly.<br /><br />I highly recommend this wonderful version of P&P to all Austen fans.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|I liked the House at Riverton even though it had a few problems.  This book is much better.  It has a nice flow and picks up quite a bit midway through.  I thoroughly enjoyed the many-layers of the story.  The fairy tales included in the story are strange and I must say that I didn't like them.  I read a lot of YA and children's works and just didn't think they were good.  Some of the storylines fall by the wayside and aren't really important in the end, but the plot loose ends are nicely tied up.
B000002KBA|5.0|I know that everybody has their own taste, but to give this album 1* is really insane! Maybe it's a little dated, but back then it was so outstanding no one came close to this! They just came out of nowhere and burst into the hard rock scene like no other band. I remember I was 17 years old and when you're that age, and hear music like that it's just incredible. To me it still sounds great.  I listen to it all the time! There are some awesome songs on it. The fact that they're still playing is the testament that, they're the best hard rock band EVER!!!!! Yes you've heard it right, better than Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath and the rest, though I like them all!
B004ZGI2KK|5.0|This movie had the Twlight feel which is a good thing...It is a bit scary but if you like that sort of thing... it is creepy. It is so nice to see romances where the characters are loyal to the one they love even when there are hard times and people are telling them to pick someone different. There would be a lot less divorce and cheating if people were more loyal in this country. The plot is great because it keeps you guessing who the wolf is until the end and the girl is in love with her childhood friend. If you are looking for amazing special effects this isn't that kind of movie. This one is more about emotions. Although the mountains are so beautiful it makes me miss Canada.   Caution: I'd say 18 or over on this one unless you prefer your kids to see killing
B002UBRFDC|5.0|This book is a masterpiece in many ways.  It is a captivating read. The plot is interesting and surprising which is not a simple task for such a long book.  What makes this book unique, though, is the contrasing look at the Japan culture and Christian/European culture. Sanctity of life VS. sanctity of goal and honor. Ethnocentrisity.   It is a great book which makes you wonder about all sorts of absolutes you thought you knew.     I highly recommend this book. One of the best I've read.
B0036TGSR6|4.0|Polanski has long had a way of turning genre movies on their head, and making tired old scripts seem fresh and cleanly written.  Of course it helps when you start with good material as is the case with Robert Harris' [[ASIN:B004E3XD9O The Ghost Writer]], who also co-wrote the script.  The intriguing plot turns nicely on itself, and Polanski keeps you guessing throughout the movie.  Adam Lang, impeccably played by Pierce Brosnan, bears some rather striking resemblances to Tony Blair, but rather than offer some polemic on the illegal renditions that were conducted in Europe, the \\"ghost,\\" finds there is much more to Lang's autobiography than meets the eye.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor brings the viewer into the story, as he tries to finish off a manuscript left behind by a previous ghost writer who was found washed up on a secluded shoreline, not far from the austere beach house of Adam Lang.  The setting may be Martha's Vineyard, but Polanski had to do all his shooting in Denmark and Germany, as he has long been considered persona non grata in the States and Britain.  You get the feeling he is teasing his nemeses, as well as viewers, with this finely scripted drama, as the \\"ghost\\" uncovers juicy bits of information pointing to an unsavory relationship between Lang and the US.  But, these are for the most part carefully conceived distractions, as the real story is locked away in the manuscript, which the \\"ghost\\" eventually unlocks, but finds himself having to pay a heavy price for it.<br /><br />Olivia Williams is excellent as Lang's jaded wife, Ruth, and Kim Catrall is barely recognizable as Lang's administrative secretary.  Like in many of his previous films, Polanski chooses to imply motives rather than broadly state them, leaving the viewer to piece together the underlying stories.  He provides sinister foils and desolate scenes to underscore the menacing tone of this film.  The Ghost Writer seems to float on the edge of the supernatural, thanks to the remote Romo, Denmark, location, like Shakespeare's Hamlet.  Ultimately, the films plays out pretty much as you would expect it too, but not without an Agatha Christie twist in the end.  Good to see, Roman Polanski hasn't lost his touch., like Shakespeare's Hamlet.

0887431461|4.0|I love having this sort of book for the kids to do as i don't home school, so want to keep-up with what they're learning. All the School Zone publications are great products that i find help to re-enforce what they need to know, without the big gaps in age levels.<br />My kids and I found this easy to go through and establish the basics. A bit bulky, but price is appropriate.
B0050CQY1W|3.0|(My review, posted here on the day of the album's release, has of course mysteriously disappeared, so thank goodness for backup drives, huh? Thanks, \\"impartial\\" editors...)<br /><br />Ok... here goes...<br /><br />I've decided to go past all the manufactured drama accompanying Miss Knowles' newest release, and instead of giving listening to the usual rumors about this album (she's a diva, she's an 'artist,' she's this and that, she's overreaching), I've decided to simply judge the album as it stands alone, because in the end it's about this album, right now, Summer 2011. So, I sat down and had a listen.<br /><br />(This review is for the Deluxe Edition, 18 songs totaling almost one hour:)<br /><br />01. 1+1 - Instead her previous mightily overproduced beginnings, she goes for the early 1990's hair-band ballad touch. It soared very simple, and I liked it - until she began to sing. It's almost laughable. I think her vocals are nothing special, but by using the Christina Aguliera's high-flying falsetto technique at the end of every line (\\"I got yooooUUUUU! ! !\\") it comes off here as desperate. For someone so independent - first coldly ditching Destiny's Child and the other members, running her own promotional empire and then helping hawk her mother's clothing through her music - she sounds here VERY much co-dependent here as well. Still, it's an interesting beginning, very ambitious. However, when she claims in the song that she \\"don't know nuthin' much about algebra\\" (nice grammar) and then says she knows \\"one plus one equals two\\" ... isn't that just basic arithmetic?<br /><br />02. I Care - I really do like the music on this album, I'm not going to lie. This is only the second track, but the songs so far have come off simple, straightforward and fascinating. Then Beyonce begins to sing, and once again she sounds so needy and almost angry. How can I believe, by her admission, that she's \\"sad and in pain\\" when she's wearing $250 jeans, sitting around in VIP seating everywhere she goes, and flying around in a G6? The lyrics are very insightful, but if maybe Jennifer Hudson had sung them, or even Fantasia, wow this would be a winner - I mean, a Grammy winner, it's so powerful - it's just not her.<br /><br />03. I Miss You - The music is keeping me going here, and it's so different, I've never heard such an ambitious project of such unique music, If this had come out as an instrumental, I'd buy it 100 times over. As it is, though, Beyonce's once again \\"kinda sad reaching out for you\\" lyrics come off as sad, and not the good kind of sad that makes you learn from it. And was it me or did I hear an 808 beat at the end of this track?<br /><br />04. Best Thing I Never Had - Whoever produced the music deserves a Grammy. Two of them. The music is honest, deep, and wow is ever worth listening to. Now I'll admit this is the closest I've come to liking this album after hearing Beyonce here. The lyrics, about a failed relationship (hmm, that sounds familiar) and how she's better off for not being with him works for me here, and for once there is a real connection between the singer and the song. Hmm, is singing hard lyrics like a growling soul singer radio-friendly again, and has it been blessed from above by St. Beyonce? This is for me the best track on the album, but once again I felt Fantasia here - a LOT. (This was the second release from the album, too bad it wasn't the first...)<br /><br />05. Party (f. Andre 3000 & Kanye West) - everytime I hear Kanye West my teeth grate, but I know he just wants the world to know he's better than Jesus, so I'll move past that for a moment. The electronic beats are great here, and the refrain \\"we like to party\\" is funny, as I think she might be a little too busy holding down a multi-million dollar business to just sit back and \\"party\\" - I just don't see it, but when Andre's wonderful soothing vocals kick in - filled with sexual innuendo, but heavily censored for the album - I'm good with it. Then Kanye's back, and the track ends so abruptly that I thought my CD was skipping or broken. Weird all the way around.<br /><br />06. Rather Die Young - I genuinely liked this track, and Teena Marie - I mean, Beyonce, vocally dances around the fuzzy guitar and she gets sexy like - dare I say it? - a female Prince, and I loved the lyrics 1000 percent. Another winning track for me, too bad it's too far and in between the other duds.<br /><br />07. Start Over - For this song, I've got only one word to describe the tone, the feeling, and the sense of what it totally is for you - Fantasia.<br /><br />08. Love On Top - El DeBarge would be proud of this wonderful remake, right down to the electronic drumbeats, the horns and vocals that seems to sound just like... (someone whispers in my ear) - oh, wait - really? Oh, ok... This TOTALLY ORIGINAL song by Beyonce is a nice fresh take on the previous 7 songs, uplifting and fun! I hope she releases this as a single, it will be an instant hit on the oldies stations, because it will fit there perfectly. Hel-l-l-l-o late 1980's!<br /><br />09. Countdown - This song has a bit of a retro feeling, the background male vocals have that Earth Wind and Fire 3 part harmony, and the electronic drums and what is very close to a xylophone are everywhere, giving the sometimes 4/4 time sometimes 8/8 beat craziness a real go for it's money, and it really works. When she goes uptempo, she goes for the stratosphere. She's killing it here.<br /><br />10. End Of Time - Shades of Gwen Stefani's \\"Hollaback Girl\\" come out here at the beginning, but immediately go into a marching order of drums, and military-style precision vocals, swirling sounds and horns that will take this song to the endzone, because - she's - going - all - the - way! A seriously industrial declaration of love here. I have to say wow, as it sounds like something familiar, but how can I pinpoint it when it's everywhere? I did like this song, definitely.<br /><br />11. I Was Here - I had to prepare myself, as I not only read in the liner notes but could smell the legendary inky stamp of ballad-master and hit-maker Diane Warren here. Will Pink Floyd get upset that the beginning of this song basically rips off the echoed guitar riff from their song \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond,\\" down to the same 4 notes, strummed twice? Hmm...<br />As to the song:<br />Lyrics? Perfect, as usual. Diane did her job and Beyonce and the 4 other producers put this 4 minute track together very carefully.<br />Music? Slow and very much designed to make her fan demographic (and even new listeners like me) introspective and teary eyed. It didn't for me, though - does this mean I'm souless because I didn't bend to her lilting voice?<br />A final analysis on this one song - it's a perfectly crafted song epitaph for a self-eulogy about a woman who is just about to turn 30, yet written by another woman who is almost twice her age, about what happens after we die.<br />I really can't say anymore about that - that enough speaks volumes.<br /><br />12. Run The World (Girls) - An industrial and aggressive track that basically takes the psuedo-anger of the Spice Girls, Gwen Stefani and Pink and uses that energy to scale the wall of domination by - well, girls. The song is heavily edited - oh, no cursing here, but you better pay me for - something). This song is a dominatrix' wet dream, as her lyrics scream out such female chauvinisms as \\"you'll do anything for me\\" and especially \\"hope you still like me, if you pay me.\\" (This was the first release from the album - I can see how this song hit the charts, and within a month or so crashed down the charts.) Can you dance to it? No. Can you watch the carefully designed video over and over? Sure. Is that about it? Yes and no.<br /><br />FOR THE DELUXE EDITION:<br /><br />01 - Lay Up Under Me - I though I was hearing a slightly slowed down remix of Kylie Minogue 1988 song \\"I Should Be So Lucky,\\" but then again Beyonce, who is again channeling Jennifer Hudson's vocal style, makes it fun for me, because I'm not thinking about Beyonce once.<br /><br />02 - Schoolin Life - I liked this song, and it's a shame, because it's too little too late. Now if the whole album had this freshness, but... it doesn't.<br /><br />03 - Dance For You - this has got to be one of the best tracks on the second disc, and at the same time the worst - she's trying to snatch up the Britney lovers with her own slow smoky stripper song that uses every hokey line in the book. This WILL be used in every strip club from Chicago to Moscow for a long time... so, thanks for that.<br /><br />04 - Run The World (girls) (Kaskade Club remix)<br />05 - Run The World (girls) (Redtopclub remix)<br />06 - Run The World (girls) (Jochen Simms Club remix)<br /><br />Out of the three above remixes, track four wins easily. Kaskade Club has always great dance remixes, and they made this song worth listening to, finally!<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />In the end, I have to give the whole album 3 stars.<br /><br />The album is on the one hand wonderful and on the other just too uneven and too odd to categorize. Is it an eager ambitious R&B/soul/late 1980's/early 1990's pop-rock artistic experiment gone haywire, or is it someone trying too hard to be edgy and musically forward and better off sticking to the usual formula that she has tossed out to her fan demographic that has made her millions?<br /><br />I have to be fair, six songs on the album worth listening to several times: I Care, I Miss You, Best Thing I Never Had, Rather Die Young, Love On Top and Countdown. I can recommend the album based on these songs, but then... the other six songs are not very good, but they were wonderfully produced, though. It goes from okay to good to great to excellent, but Beyonce's vocals on most of them just got in the way for me.<br /><br />I mentioned two other women who, if they had this material, would have knocked it out of the park: Jennifer Hudson, who could sing the phone book for me and it would sound angelic, and Fantasia, who has had every kind of obstacle thrown in front of her from almost day one but has smashed right through it with the power of a woman who is truly talented but has always been called the \\"ghetto girl with the good voice,\\" but will always fight to show you that she's more than her past.<br /><br />Beyonce? Well, she's good and all as a professional singer, but I personally can't wholeheartedly recommend this album - half of it belongs to someone else's voice, and it isn't hers. The music is inventive if a little too retro-sounding for me (I've got enough oldies CD's at home), but still the producers (over a dozen to stir this big pot of mush) gave it a shot.<br /><br />Lastly, sorry to anyone who has bought her screensavers, her posters, her singles, her videos, her .mp3s on your Ipods and whatever else you have - although she does deliver here, and very inventive as it is, it's an only halfway done album in my opinion, and that's the real shame. Once you listen for yourself, you'll see why the initial selling price is so low on this one - it's new and different, but there's no real substance from Beyonce, no soul.<br /><br />An ernest effort layered under too much, too much, too much...<br /><br />(thanks for reading - I really welcome your comments on this review, and please don't forget to let me know if you liked or hated my review!)and hit-maker Diane Warren here.

B004WOS3P4|5.0|It has been a long wait for Cook's new record. And this wait was well worth it. Leaps and bounds above his first studio record, This Loud Morning takes you on a dreamlike journey through the gestation of a relationship. Still anthemic and big, with bridges that swell massively, the songs feel more raw and more lyrically like Cook. His band was also involved a great deal with the record, and you can tell. There's so much more than driving guitars in this effort and I'm impressed with the way they infused more instrumentation and melodies - especially with the piano, played by his masterful keyboardest, Andy Skib. There are so many highlights - both the opener, Circadian and the closer, Rapid Eye Movement, give you real bang for your buck. But there are some hidden gems, like Goodbye to the Girl, penned with bandmates Skib and Neal Tiemann, and Fade Into Me, that showcase Cook's voice and prove that he can sing a ballad or an anthem. The oddity is his current single, The Last Goodbye, which was clearly chosen as a single due to the Ryan Tedder co-write, but even that has it's fun moments.     I can't stop listening to this record. Cook just keeps getting better.
B00428ZRFE|4.0|I read some of the reviews of this CD and in my opinion Loud tops Rihanna's last CD, Rated R (which I loved).  I play my fave cuts (S&M, Cheers, Fading, California King Bed, Man Down, Complicated, and Skin) every morning on my way to work....definitely gets me through the stress of a.m. traffic!
B004ZGI1V0|3.0|Not as engaging as TAKEN , but a good thriller<br /><br />This is not a mind blowing thriller movie but a bearable one. One time watch movie. there are other movie with similar story line.<br /><br />Liam has again done a good job .
B0034G4P8U|5.0|I went into this movie with lofty expectations.  I found the first Transformers film to be a fun-spirited and exciting trip down memory lane.  The second movie--despite its obvious flaws--contained some truly awe-inspiring action scenes.  Thankfully the third and supposedly final installment proves to be the best film in the franchise; capturing the positives from both its predecessors and then some.    Dark of the Moon has a more serious tone than the first two movies.  Beginning with the space race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, the movie sets up an alternate history (akin to X-Men: First Class) that brings a sense of gravity and meaning to the film.  As the movie moves from past to present, the audience is greeted by familiar characters--both human and mechanical.  To avoid any spoilers I will just state that the story is much more comprehensible than the first sequel's and the plot holes (while there may be a few) are nowhere near as noticeable or aggravating.  The stakes are higher this round with the final act playing like an alien invasion movie along the lines of Independence Day or the more recent Battle: L.A., except instead of a wise-cracking Will Smith or a melancholic Aaron Eckhart fighting off the invaders we get a bad-ass Optimus Prime.  The Autobot leader's character development is one of the most enjoyable aspects of the franchise.  The events of Dark of the Moon cause Optimus to move away from the Superman-esque leader of the original film and into the realm of a vengeful anti-hero.  Think the Punisher in the form of a giant robot.  The human cast is serviceable.  Shia LeBeauf's comedic chops are still amusing, while John Malkovich and (especially) Alan Tudyk provide further comic relief.  Megan Fox's much discussed replacement Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is nowhere near as bad as everyone (myself included) expected her to be.  Her true acting abilities are still somewhat a mystery since half the time she is talking the camera is still mysteriously focused on her rear.    As always, the biggest draw in this type of movie is the action.  Dark of the Moon delivers in droves.  Say what you will about director Michael Bay; the man is capable of crafting some of the most exciting and inventive action scenes in modern cinema.  Thankfully, unlike some recent releases (I'm talking to you Green Lantern), this is one movie that leaves some of the best material out of its trailers and TV spots.  A chase between Bumblebee and his cohorts and three very animalistic Decepticons on the interstate towards the end of the first act is a jaw-dropping spectacle.    If this movie is as critically derided as was Revenge of the Fallen, then I am truly convinced critics just love to hate on Michael Bay.  Why they can suspend disbelief for similar fare such as Thor (which was good) or Iron Man 2 (which was a moderately enjoyable mess) while bludgeoning Transformers is lost on me.  Dark of the Moon is an excellent summer blockbuster anchored on several truly exciting action scenes.  Those looking for a sci-fi cinematic pallet cleanser to rid themselves of the disappointing and tepid taste of Green Lantern should check out Transformers: Dark of the Moon without hesitation.
B001853NZK|4.0|Looks great, good size (easily fits 100 sleeve sheets full of cards).  Only thing is, I can see the covering peeling if you handle this a lot and nick it.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I didn't know what to think when it started off, but the imagery was amazing. The book was fast paced and full of intrigue. I can't wait for the next installment.

B004ULEEY8|5.0|The movie was alriii...  but I write this mainly to discuss the lack of a Resist demo on the single Blu-ray package.    Otherwise decent viewing. Very Skyline like,  [...]
1400052181|5.0|Wow, a very powerful story.  I'm not interested in science or history, but this book had my full attention from page 1.  I couldn't put it down.  I fell in love with Henrietta and the entire Lacks family.  I sincerely hope the author donates a large portion of the profits to the family as well as the foundation she started.
B000UX6THK|5.0|Me really like this series, mainly because Madonna not in it or not singing any song on soundtrack.  If Madonna was in it me no think that me would like because she make me puke, especially when she sing.  Me don't even call it singing, it more like pigeon being killed in lawn mower.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Thankfully, a purchased app online can be downloaded to your device no matter what the compatibility says. Very much enjoyed the game, though like every PopCap game, it has massive bloat issues.<br /><br />But as memory and processors get better, it will matter less. Just wish they'd splurge for real coders.
B002OT730K|4.0|If you bought this album in the 1970s, chances are you hated it. I never gave it much credence until buying the remaster. After a careful, non-prejudiced listen, it seems to me that this is a fine live album which sounds excellent and has some terrific performances. This is an overlooked gem from the Stones' catalog that is begging for a rediscovery.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|I had to ask for a refund on this!! This bundle format it's very bad, I cannot chose the book I want to read, and there's no main table of content, it's just one huge Big Book all messed up.    I'll be getting each book individually.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|Many people I know will say that Mad Men is the best drama on AMC and TV in general.  Honestly, I enjoy Breaking Bad much more than Mad Men, especially the second season.  While Mad Men is a great show that makes you feel like you are in the time period, Breaking Bad offers the full spectrum of entertainment.  Awesome acting, gripping storyline, funny moments, action packed scenes (from time to time), and the list goes on and on.  I feel that this series is a must watch for anyone who enjoys drama.
0143036556|5.0|I admit I was biased before I even started reading this work. I wanted to know about Easter Island and the Greenland Norse. The other failed societies were of marginal interest to me. Sure I read about Montana, the Anasazi, and the Maya, while skipping over Rwanda, Dominican Republic/Haiti, and Australia. The chapters on China and Pitcairn/Henderson Islands were, however, interesting (the latter especially in the context of Easter Island).     But it is into the two sections on Easter and the Greenland Norse that you can tell the author has poured his soul. They really stand out in what I read of this book - most of it - and perhaps for the history-interested layman they are the most interesting chapters to read. I'm not sure if the author presents anything radically new, but what he does do, which is to provide the lay reader with a useful summary of the present facts and findings on the two mysteries - he does very well. I feel I am now up to speed with some of the latest research into the disappearances of civilized society on Easter and in Norse Greenland. Nowhere else have I seen such useful and up-to-date general/overall accounts of the state of research into these two former societies. It's really required reading for anyone who has an interest in either. Not only does the author present us with - at the time of writing - the latest research, he also considers many pertinent issues himself and comes to his own conclusions. It's as if he took all the latest findings on Easter and Greenland and put them into an comprehensive, accessible, and useful/relevant perspective. What a great place then to start your readings into these two societies.    The essential point about Easter is that the local chiefs spent the resources of the island on mutual competition and self-aggrandizement. The society failed to come together and pool its knowledge and resources. Had it done so, and had it exercized greater forethought and caution as did some of the other societies presented in the book (e.g. the Japan of the daimyo), it might well have survived a deal longer.    The conclusions the author draws on the Greenland Norse are uniquely fascinating. In short, he puts their eventual collapse down to the following issues:    1) The Norse failed to hunt the ringed seals, fish and whales that the Inuit did, they thus deprived themselves of very important sources of winter protein  2) The Norse clung to their European, Christian, and Norwegian identity, values and heritage, and ultimately failed to adapt to their new surroundings - when the little Ice Age arrived they were undone  3) The Norse scorned the Inuit and failed to copy their ways or learn from them  4) Power in Norse Greenlandic society was in the hands of the chiefs and the clergy. These institutions had a vested interest in maintaining their own power and prestige inspite of developments that could have proven beneficial for Norse Greenlandic society as a whole    The chapters concluding the book concerning why societies fail or succeed and what we can learn from them today certainly have their value, even if the points made are at times a little self-evident.    For any reader interested in the two \\"failed\\" societies mentioned above, plus many others, you could hardly find a better place to begin than here. Top marks to Jared Diamond.
B00479SVBU|5.0|I have tried other transmitters in the past with limited success in one of the top five largest cities in the US.  The radio frequencies just interfered too much driving around town.    However, based on the good reviews and this product having the features I wanted, I decided to give this a try.  If it didn't work well for me, I was willing to send it back and pay for the shipping.    What a bargain!  This product works even better than advertised.  I purchased a 16GB Class 10 SD card to put part of my music library on, and it works like a dream.  Excellent sound quality!  Sure beats switching out my entire car stereo just to have SD card or AUX input.  I use the remote quite frequently while driving and it is easy to use.    The SD card input is organized by folder.  I was able to take specific folders out of my iTunes library and copy them onto the SD card, and everything seems to work fine.  But to get good input on selecting specific songs out of your entire library, you'll need to use an iPhone or iPod touch, or other mp3 player that can plug into the AUX jack on this transmitter (i.e., use that instead of SD card input).    Best thing I've bought in a while - it's worth twice the price, knowing what I know now.  Thanks Satechi/Soundfly!    Jon
B004LWZW42|3.0|Scene: 1960s. Cold War.    As Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender) hunts down former Nazis, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) studies at Oxford. Erik spent World War II in a concentration camp. Charles lived in luxury, but his parents were never around. His company was a girl about his age named Raven (Jennifer Lawrence). Former Nazi Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon) plots to start World War III, so Erik, Charles, Raven, and a rag-tag group join together to stop him.    Oh, yeah, and they have superpowers. They're mutated humans, and few know of their existence. Those who do know tend to fear and loathe them, making most mutants feel alone and discriminated against. METAPHOR.    If I had gone in expecting a James Bond film, I might have had a better idea of what to expect. This prequel to the other X-Men films had possibilities. We know from later films that Charles and Erik become leaders with opposing philosophies, even as they appear to share a genuine affection. How fun could it be to see their relationship develop?    The answer is pretty fun but also very stupid.    What they got wrong:    Dialogue  Some of the dialogue is cringe worthy and unbelievably cliché. How many times have we heard the phrase, \\"Who are you and what have you done with (etc.)\\" or \\"God help us all?\\" This may be paying homage to the past, but this knowledge doesn't make the horrendous lines any easier on the ears.    Humans/Non-mutants/Muggles  Mutants are putting their lives on the line for lowly humans, but the big question here is, will the humans ever accept the mutants? Is it really worth saving a people who may very well turn against you? The film attempts to answer that question and show ambiguity by making almost every human character grating, irrationally stupid, and self-centered. Several minor characters (mostly humans) deliver their terrible lines in an especially wooden manner. This makes the stakes feel remarkably low. That's quite an accomplishment considering the stakes are World War III.    History  Obviously, this is an alternate history. However, First Class is no Inglourious Basterds, a complex, satirical take on World War II. This film portrays two terrifying time periods in history, the Holocaust and the Cold War, with an offensive mixture of melodrama and lightheartedness. A figure resembling the sickening Nazi doctor Josef Mengele resembles a James Bond villain, gleefully shooting down an innocent Jewish woman. Was anyone else uncomfortable with this?    Race Relations (Spoiler Alert)  The film states its message about fifty times: be proud of your identity, no matter what your appearance. Yet the only African American man (Edi Gathegi, potentially interesting) in the film is one of only two mutants to be killed. The other is a Nazi.    Consistency  As is expected, there are several moments that make no sense. You might find yourself asking, why aren't they moving when they are in grave danger? Those questions are far less important than several puzzling allegiance shifts. Let's just say a few characters who appear to be horrified when witnessing mass murder somehow become smug accomplices.    What they got right:    Style  The design department had great fun with generic but iconic clothes and music of the 1960s. Prepare for turtlenecks and short skirts (and, because this is a comic book movie, cleavage).    Erik and Charles  The relationship between Erik and Charles is quite touching. Charles (dubbed Professor X) is a witty, confident, and believably inspiring leader. McAvoy is likable and surprisingly hilarious in the role. Charles uses his telepathic ability to help Erik (Magneto) control his unbalanced emotions. Erik uses his ability to mentally manipulate metal to pulverize his enemies. Erik is insightful, ruthless, and disturbed. Intense as always, Fassbender is engaging whether terrorizing bad-guys, fighting the darkness within, or giving acute advice to younger mutants.    Mutants  Raven (later named Mystique) has a fairly nice story as a blue shapeshifter embarrassed by her natural appearance. Nicholas Hoult does well as a scientist who is ashamed of his fancy feet, capturing both the character's diffidence and gruffer side. Scenes involving mutant abilities are in some ways superior to the other X-Men films because characters use their powers to full effect (i.e. they do not unnecessarily backflip or punch others when they could shoot them with lasers). On the whole, the action is quite entertaining and certainly one of the best aspects of this film.    Villains  Kevin Bacon has fun as the nefarious Shaw, and his trio of suave baddies remains confident and calm in every situation. The serene Emma Frost (January Jones) is a telepath who wears mostly undies and can turn her skin into a protective veneer of diamonds. The other two henchmen have a very small amount of screen time. One has at most five lines. The other has none. Still, Riptide (Alex Gonzalez) has an amusing ability to keep his hair and outfit perfectly in place while creating tornadoes, and Azazel (Jason Flemyng) bears a demonic appearance, possesses stunning assassination skills, and can teleport in a burst of flames. (Can anyone blame him for joining the villains? Who would trust a guy who looks like the devil?)    Story  There is an actual arc, including a climax featuring several satisfying action sequences and some emotional resolution. There's even a little tragedy and surprise.    Conclusion    X-Men: First Class should be enjoyable for anyone who has followed the X-Men series. It's an entertaining film which improves as it progresses. Unfortunately, it is not also a good film.
B00008OE4W|5.0|Let's say you saw a movie years back that you still think about today.  For me, one of those films is Sneakers.  Selective scenes would pop in my head.  David Strathairn playing a blind soundman - driving a truck.  Mary McDonnel dancing with each of the guys.  James Earl Jones as the frustrated Agent granting wishes.  Dan Aykroyd, just because of who he is.  The Movie and scenes came back to my memory and always make me smile.  Besides excellent acting all round, it is fascinating to watch.  Thankfully I was smart enough this time to order it for myself.  Now it's close at hand to enjoy whenever I want. I can recommened Sneakers.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|I really love this cd!  I first heard the single \\"Sail\\" on the radio and decided to buy the album.  I have heard some people complain that the rest of the songs don't sound like Sail, but I think that is the beauty of the album - the songs are all so different, but they are all really great.  Personally, I think cd's are boring if the songs all sound the same.  The one thing I could have lived without are the interludes - I think they kind of ruin the flow of the songs.     Bottom line - if you want a good look at what sort of crazy goes on inside Aaron Bruno's head, then buy this album!
B00006LLNV|5.0|I love the emotion of the Movie so well that I had to add this to my collection. In fact I have one for my office and one for the car. The movie was so emotional and revealing about the life of Frieda Carlo that I wanted the music. Director Tayor did an outstanding job on the life of Frieda that the CD just grounds you to life in general. All of the artists singing on this are at their very best. Had to have this one....
B0040QYROK|3.0|Understand that this is a silent film made in the 1920's, simple. This version of Metropolis is well over 2 hours in length and unless your really into these types of movies you will need to take a couple breaks just to stomach it. Personally I would not waste the additional few dollars on the Blu-Ray version as the normal DVD is as high of resolution and sound quality as they can get from the various original recording reals. Most of the format is 4:3, some has been slightly enhanced to be more panoramic. This is a movie for adults into early classic film, social science, and recoding history, anyone else will probably be bored out of their mind.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|A must have for all Abba's fans. I have seen the movie 3-4 times and the soundtrack is really well done. Of course we will not find amazing voices here (check Pierce Brosnan - I love him as Bond, but he cannot sing! he he he), but it's not why I bought this cd.<br />It is all about fun and good feeling.<br />There are, however, songs in wonderful versions. The best is \\"Dancing queen\\" with multivocals. It sounds amazing.<br />Kudos for Meryl Streep and her performance in both \\"Slipping through my fingers\\" and \\"The winner takes it all\\".<br />She sounds extremely good.<br />In my opinion these are 3 outstanding tracks and 3 main reasons to buy the cd (other 14 helped to take decision, too).
1423107233|5.0|This is the first book in the Disney Archive Series and is hardback with no dust cover and 272 pages. The book is focused on story through storyboards.     There is no table of contents, and the book really gained steam for me on page 72 when they introduced the storyboards for Snow White until the end of the book. Much of the artwork you'll see will be for the first time.     This series is going to be a keeper for sure.     Highly recommended.
B0042816YK|1.0|Julia Roberts character starts the movie married.  He is totally devoted to her but she looks at him with total contempt from the beginning.  The first part of the movie is about her mid-life crises.  She feels trapped and wants to selfishly abandon her husband to travel the world.  Despite everyone around her telling her she is acting like a teenager or early twenty year old, she divorces her husband.  In the divorce proceedings he even turns down all her money and says he just wants her; he also laments she never told him she was unhappy, just left (she instantly starts sleeping with a much younger man-I mean instantly).  She then leaves to go and do what the movie should be called, \\"Eat, sleep with Younger Guys and Be Selfish\\"  How many women would love this movie if the main character was a man?  What if the man instantly left his wife and started sleeping around?  He would be a \\"pig\\" and they would hate the move.  Falling in love is easy, staying in love is hard; it takes work.  With \\"Hollywood\\" role models guiding so much of our life, I wonder why our divorce rate is 50%?
1423134206|5.0|This title is the longest of the three at 288 pages, and all the other aspects are the same: no table of contents, short introduction, and many many large format pictures beautifully reproduced.    This is a particularly nice title as it contains more color than the other two, Story and Animation. It was a real treat to see some of Mary Blair's work in addition to many other phenomenal artists. This title contained a lot more landscape work in addition to character.     This is the latest title in the Archive series and I highly recommend buying all three. I'm looking forward to the 4th title to be released, Layout and Background. I'm not sure how many will be released for the series, but these are keepers to be treasured for a lifetime.
B004SQS9FA|5.0|I've always liked Radiohead, but never really got serious about them until this year.  I signed up for this album on their site and picked it up for $9.00 directly from the artist on the day of release in .mp3 format.<br /><br />They even sent me a couple of extra tracks a few weeks after the release for free, which was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />As for the album itself, they are experimenting with sound (which seems normal to me considering their body of work to this point) and layering; the results are really very interesting.  I've listened to the album at least 15 or so times, if not more and I like it quite a bit.  I'd recommend it to anyone who has liked their past work.
1423117166|5.0|This title in the series is slightly fewer pages (262, I believe Story is 272), but all the other physical aspects are the same.     In this title we get to see many many frame by frame sequences of some of our favorite Disney animations. In particular, the Peter Pan sequences were particularly nice as Disney has not released an official Art of... book for this animation.     Like Story, this title has no table of contents and has a short introduction, but no other text. The art really shines as this is a large format book, and in many instances there is one piece of artwork per page.    I love this Archive Series and I recommend collecting them now before they go out of print.    Highly recommended.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|By far this is Beyonce's best record, the music is flawless and it has authentic soul. From the soulful power ballad 1+1 to the 70's funk of Love on Top you here the inspiration from the legends that inspire her but she makes it her own. I really love this album and all I can is at least give it try, if you doubted her authenticity before she will prove you wrong with \\"4\\".    Best Songs: ALL OF THEM
B0054JURZA|5.0|Maybe Justin Vernon is the Saint of Wisconsin, who knows, but it's doubtful Vernon has given it much consideration. Josh Eells a writer for the Rolling Stone pretty much risked his mind to probe into Justin Vernon's musical world and Wisconsin retreat. I'll not attempt to top \\"The Sound of Silence\\" review in the June 23rd edition. What I will say is that Bon Iver is a bountiful journey of introspection and mindfulness seen and heard more often in Tibet than in Fall Creek, Wisconsin, but to Vernon they may be on the same astral plane. It's not weird at all to get lost in the music's other worldliness; it's a necessity of convention. The soothing cavernous flow is synchronized to elevate the worst mood and the flowing serenity doesn't shirk from being pretentious at times. Bon Iver is on a quest for the Holy Grail of songwriting Justin Vernon launched all by himself, and it will be very interesting if anyone try's to join him on its rhythmic swells and oceans of music.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|I used my brand new PP1 Pocket Pal to sharpen 3 small kitchen knives that were not terribly dull to begin with. I read the instructions and followed them to a T, whatever that means.  Afterwards, the knives were noticeably sharper.  But I was not blown away by their sharpness. For comparison I also have a hand-held sharpener called 'Accusharp'.  The Accusharp is 3 times bigger than the PP1 and it works 3 times better (note: the Accusharp does not have a pointed file like the PP1 does).<br />I am not trying to \\"rip\\" on the Smith's PP1.  It seems to have made a lot of reviewers happy. I am simply saying that when it comes to sharpening knives with a small hand-held device, the Accusharp seems to work considerably better for me.  It uses the same principle as the PP1 and it's just as easy to use. The Accusharp is bigger than the PP1.  But it's still small enough to carry around. I have been sharpening knives, from time to time, for 40 years.  When it comes to sharpening, I know what works well and what doesn't.
0756655307|5.0|I am not a Marvel genius. I do not know a whole lot about the universe. I do, however, know enough to find my way around. This has been a wonderful resource to fill in the gaps. With all of the new superhero movies coming out, this is an excellent way to learn about them beforehand. It also provides hours of entertainment. It is a great coffee table book and I can guarantee that you will love leafing through it time and time again. If you are ill-informed on the world of Marvel Comics, get this book. It will give you the knowledge you need.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I bought this when it was only $26. It's now $55 on Newegg. Amazon is great with prices.     On to the product. It installed easily with some AS5 and I didn't have any problem installing it. It is slightly audible at 100%, but once you turn it down to 75% or less it's silent, and as far as I can tell, the speed doesn't matter, the temperatures are the same at 50% as they are at 100% for me.     i5 760 @ 3.6GHz with speedstep and turboboost off of course. Often gets down to 20c when idling, usually hovers around 30c. When I'm running any various stress test it rarely gets above 50c and hasn't seen 55c since the day I bought it. For AMD CPUs this might not be good, but they don't put out as much heat in the first place. For intel CPUs however, they easily handle 70c without a problem. So 50c is great! It barely fit my mATX board with the GPU, It's facing vertically and appears to be sucking hot air off the back of my GPU, so if anything these temperatures are higher than average. I have a GTX 275 that doesn't get above 70c much so it's not as bad as something like a GTX 480, if you need to have it positioned like I do with a 480 then you may have a problem.
B004WOS3P4|5.0|The wonderful David Cook is back with an amazing cd that captures the spirit that he posesses to tell a story with his music.  The essence of his album is the beautiful Circadian which is the first track of the album and ends with the wonderful Rapid Eye Movement, being the catalyst of the entire dream series.   I am in love with every single track on this album. including the 2 bonus tracks.   Cook´s voice gets better and better with time and possesses a wonderful falsetto.       Each track in between the sandwich is like opening a plethora of brightly coloured gems.  I cannot choose a favourite.  Each day I change my mind and choose another.   I cannot explain how this album has made me feel the movements of  each track.   In the soft flowing songs like Fade Into Me, (swoonworthy) and Goodbye to the Girl, the staccato movements of the fabulous Time Marches On, the light and the dark, and then the big choruses of Paper Heart and We Believe.  Finally there is the lid flickering of Rapid Eye Movement where my lids actually do start flickering in time to the music.   This is an amazing concept Cook has planned.    You must experience this wonderful album first hand.   Congratulations to Cook and the Anthemics.
1592402038|5.0|A joyous call-to-arms for everyone who reveres the English language and takes pleasure in the intricacies of which it is capable. The author moves right along, taking potshots left and right at confused punctuation while maintaining the interest of newbies and professionals alike.<br /><br />I could take issue with some of Truss' preferences (such as leaving the hyphen out of \\"Zero-Tolerance Approach\\") but most of those can be laid to her unabashed British provenance, which she acknowledges most of the time.
B000000I0C|4.0|Update August 3, 2011-    I'm sorry.  I just played Peter Hammill's Over album again today with a different perspective thanks to a better understanding what exactly he was trying to do, and now I feel I can appreciate it a *heck* of a lot more.      I severely underestimated just how personal Peter Hammill was expressing himself during the creation of this collection of songs.  I completely overlooked this aspect of his music, and I honestly feel bad about it.  What's especially surprising to me -and what *can't* be explained- is how exactly the songwriting improved dramatically this afternoon compared to my previous listen.  It's certainly an example where everything finally clicked.  Just how *much* it clicked is surprising though- REALLY surprising.      Anyway, the softer, more personal songs have really fine vocal melodies, and in one example (\\"Autumn\\") the vocal melody actually makes me want to cry.   The opening song titled \\"Crying Wolf\\" is an extroardinary rocker.  A MUCH better experience with this song compared to the last time I played it.    I still stand by this though- \\"This Side of the Looking Glass\\" isn't really that great of a song.  The cheesiness in the orchestral arrangements is a major distraction for me.  I suppose parts of it are decent until around the halfway point when it just becomes too much to tolerate and I lose interest.  \\"Time Heals\\" isn't the musical disappointment I originally believed it was- it's just that compared to Van Der Graaf Generator's stuff, it comes up a little short.  I suppose that was the point I was trying to make a few weeks ago.  The lyrics are no great shakes, however appreciating the personal side of Peter Hammill changes my perspective on it in a positive way and presents an entirely different experience.  \\"Lost and Found\\" *does* accomplish something after all.  It's significantly more melodic than I gave it credit for the first time.  This is one of those shocking moments where I can't really explain what happened.  I just LIKE it now.    No, I can't relate to the lyrics because relationship troubles are something I've never had to experience, but that doesn't mean Over deserves the extremely harsh review I originally had given it.  I'll leave my original thoughts open to the public right below this final sentence, but keep in mind that I now thoroughly enjoy Over and was simply unimpressed and/or confused when I initially wrote my review.  I have in fact, finally warmed up to it.  It's a great feeling when that happens.    Peter Hammill drastically misses the mark with this one.  Perhaps he was going through a temporary dry spell or maybe he was finally running out of ideas (I wouldn't know having not heard anything past Over... which will change soon, I promise) but whatever the case, fans can believe this album shows a more personal side of Peter Hammill all they want- I know flaws (and misfires) when I hear them, and this album has plenty.    \\"Time Heals\\" is lyrically a disappointment.  For some reason, Peter Hammill made a nearly 8-minute track totally banal with forgettable lyrics about typical relationship issues that someone less intelligent than Peter could have written. This is definitely abnormal by his standards when we consider what Peter has accomplished just one year before with Van Der Graaf Generator on their Still Life masterpiece, along with his previous solo album Nadir's Big Chance.      Musically... \\"Time Heals\\" is *still* not an improvement I'm afraid.  I've heard better, again, by both VDGG and previous solo efforts.  The predictability of the way this track was written makes me think disco somehow played a part in such a mediocre song.  If not disco, maybe punk, or simply the fact the music scene was changing quickly in 1977 happened to play a part.  *Something* sure did.      Now get this.  I hate to say this.  I really really hate what I'm about to say.  I have to do it though.  I have to go through with it.  *Sigh* here goes...    \\"This Side of the Looking Glass\\" is the worst song I've ever heard.  Imagine pretty ballerina dancers starring in a Snow White musical with the cheesiest orchestration imaginable, and imagine Peter Hammill changing his normal singing routine in order to compliment said orchestration and... oh my God, this is absolute garbage with a capital G.  I've had my problems with a few Van Der Graaf Generator songs in the past, but they *never* offended me as much as this song does.  At least when the band Chicago attempted the same thing on their second album, Terry Kath kept a reasonable vocal melody in check so it didn't become unbearable.  This song is guilty of being overbearingly pretentious and I despise everything about it.    \\"Lost and Found\\" opens with a predictable drum beat giving us a sneak preview what to expect, perhaps.  It's... hold on.  My GOD is \\"This Side of the Looking Glass\\" horrible.  Sorry sorry.  Oh man.  What a brutal mess.  \\"Lost and Found\\" does nothing musically.  It accomplishes absolutely nothing.  What's it doing?  What's Peter Hammill singing?  Repeating the words \\"lost and found\\" a bunch of times?  Afterwards I'm forced to experience an especially below average/awkwardly written vocal melody.    This is where it all went wrong.  Now I'm HOPING this isn't the end of the line.  I really want to hear more quality Peter Hammill material.  I'm hoping he didn't permanently change his style starting here, and for the last 30-something years he was releasing music similar to this (songs devoid of melody and interesting lyrics) because I really want to investigate the mans solo career further.
B004XWMXX8|3.0|This mediocre album is mostly dance-beat songs with weak lyrics that are an attempt to reach the young adult crowd, including one song that contains a profanity.  There are a couple of decent tunes for her kid fans,  but those should be bought as singles. Parents will have problems with some of the lyrics on this album, including one where she talks about spending the night with a guy. Others are just laughable, like \\"That's More Like It\\" (she sings \\"Make my dinner, bring it to me\\") and \\"Whiplash\\" (\\"Lickety split, a girl and a bear\\"). Her attempts at \\"depth\\" like \\"Outlaw\\" are trite and some songs have melody lines that copy other hits.    This isn't the little Disney girl any more. Like all the other former Disney stars she is trying to grow up by turning out a CD of more adult songs but at least half of them are very weak. Don't let the two or three good songs on Radio Disney fool you--this is not an album for children.

030726999X|4.0|It's hard for me to write a review of the final book in the Millennium trilogy. In some respects it was the perfect finale for one of the best trilogies of our modern time. But then in others it was disappointing, empty, and lacked the explosiveness that the first 2 carried.<br /><br />That \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" is, in fact, a good read, is, however undeniable. As with the other 2 Larsson books, it's a rough time getting through the first 150 pages, but it is well worth the time. Just like \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" and \\"Fire\\" Larsson knows how to craft a novel that in more intertwined than a tangled fishing line, yet, at the same time, keep it moving at such a brisk and understandable pace, that it is impossible to put this book down.<br /><br />And while \\"Hornet's Nest\\" does do a good job of wrapping up a story that was begun years before, it still failed to impress me in the ways that the first 2 did.<br /><br />Back, of course are the typically atypical characters of Salander, Blomkvist, Bergman, and the other folks previously presented. That's a nice thing when reading a trilogy like this, but it's also frustratingly predictable as well. Salander is the same old moody, misunderstood, mistreated girl. Blomkvist is still the intrepid reporter who sleeps around with just about anything that has legs and always happens to be in the right place at the right time. Even Bergman hasn't changed (even if her situation did) and continues to knowingly (and with his approval, of all things) cheat on her husband with Blomkvist.<br /><br />Then there is the conclusion, that after years in the making, comes and goes with hardly  any fanfare or hooplah. Sure, Larsson does a fantastic job presenting the courtroom drama and the dialogue between Salander, Gianinni, and the crooked Dr. Teleborian, but it happens so quickly and in only a few short paragraphs, the reader is left feeling almost cheated out of their time and money.<br /><br />Here's the thing: \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\" was far from a bad book, and I did enjoy the few days I spent reading it, and I do commend Larsson on his incredible ability to craft such a great story and so many plot-twists, but it was still the weakest of the 3. A friend told me it was almost as if the author had given up within the last 30 pages or so, and I am inclined to agree. The final 10 pages are rushed, lazy and actually manage to leave more questions than answers.d book, and I did enjoy the few days I spent reading it, and I do commend Larsson on his incredible ability to craft such a great story and so many plot-twists, but it was still the weakest of the 3.

B0050CQY1W|5.0|I congratulate Beyonce in everything she does.  She is a very talented artist & people need to face that. She has the ability to provide different genres of music to different people and that is what makes her so amazing.  Although I am not a 100% fan of \\"Girls\\", its okay because she can please all age groups.  I wish I would have notice that the bonus cd( Exclusively sold at TARGET) had Run the World ( GIRLS) on their 3 times, 3 different club mixes. UGGGH, BUT I actually digg the techno beat to it! It shows that Beyonce is very diverse.  A previous review said something about her leotards she always wear... I'm okay with that, that is her style she is comfortable in it & I don't feel she needs to change that! Beyonce is REAL & it is so obvious she can sing & dance. If I could wear a leotard every time & anytime, I would too! I love you Beyonce! Your number one fan! Go BB
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I was really surprised when I read this book, it had me near tears, and raging at the characters. At first I was like \\"Oh well this will be a boring old book.\\" I start reading it and there is action in the very beginning. I love how the story just takes turns, zigzags through the emotions, and just how it ended, quirky and different. It's a great read and it will make you not want to put it down until you finish it!
B000L3CHC0|5.0|I live in Brazil and asked my brother to receive, in his house, this watch for me. He would send me later. I was worry about some reviews that were telling us about fake products that amazon were selling. Finally my watch arrived in my hands and was astonished. The watch is simply wonderful. As others customers said, it much more beautiful in your wrist than at the photo. As long as I know, my watch is a really Tissot peace. In fact, It looks like a much more expensive watch. I'm completly satisfy. Tks Amazon.
0226264211|5.0|I first read this book as a required text in a college economics class in the 1970s.  The notion that personal freedom is the innate condition of man is lost on those trusting in the statist governmental constructs of the present day.  Friedman writes in a manner that makes it easy for the reader to understand the basics of economics as part of man's essential freedom.      For Amazon customers reading the reviews before purchasing this book, you may take with a grain of salt those negative reviews posted herein, as they have obviously been filtered through the screens of Marxist polemics.  There is nothing about capitalism and individual freedom that the Marxist will accept.  They refuse to review a book based on the attributes of book itself, but rather they attack the entire premise of the writings.  Capitalism is bad; therefore, any book extolling the virtues of capitalism is bad.    Use your freedom to choose and read this book.
B00003CWL6|1.0|I absolutely HATED this movie!  I'm years late in viewing it but decided to rent it since it got such rave reviews and critical acclaim.    #1 - The title doesn't fit the story  #2 - The storyline is all over the place and the movie has no sound direction as to where it's going and why??  #3 - Sad, morbid ending for no reason, pointless satire and just a horrible storyline all together.    I started to turn the movie off before it ended but I was curion to see how it turned out since it got so many Oscars.  I thought I was missing something...I wasn't.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This is without a doubt the BEST youtube downloader ever!! I have had just about EVERY downloader available and kept running into the same annoying problem.....the downloader wouldnt actually tranfer the video to mp3.  It would just play as mp3, but you couldnt copy it and movet to another device.  BUT THIS ONE DOES!!! Also, it downloads very fast and is very easy to navigate.  I still cant believe it is free. 6 stars if I could.

B004WOS3P4|5.0|I'm also known as \\"magicalbeck\\". :)<br />Greetings to any readers who happen on this. I need to preface my review with this information:  I have two and a half decades of experience as a singer, pianist, classical musician, rock musician, vocal coach, musical director/arranger/writer, and as a soprano lead actress in musical theater. (not all at the same time!) I don't give you my resume because I hold myself or my opinion in higher esteem than any music lover. We are all in this together, searching for art that moves us. I just wanted to let you know that my review is from that perspective, to perhaps shine a slightly different light on Cook's most unusual gift. (I review the songs so skip down to them if you like. I realize this is long!)<br />David is a tenor, but possessor of a stunning instrument that is actually rather rare in rock/pop music. In my opinion he is a dramatic tenor which is a very large voice with a great deal of ring and resonance, that can be pushed to dramatic climaxes more easily than the usual light leggiero voices or warm, bright lyric tenors. Cook's voice has a very dark, rich, beautiful color compared to other tenors. Yet unlike some dramatic tenors, it doesn't sound forced or wobbly; in fact the vibrato is spinning and perfectly free, even while he often adds the rasp. There is nobody I have ever heard do this better. He basically sings perfectly clearly, and raspy, simultaneously! Who does this?!! I know of no one.<br /><br />If you are musically inclined to records you can pontificate or enjoy small talk over while they are playing in the background, this is perhaps not the one for you. Season 7's Idol champ absolutely cries out for your undivided attention.  He told us he was versatile vocally in his first televised audition, and he meant it. Cook trips lightly from a beautiful and more certain lower register into that dark and velvety, firm middle voice upwards to the full-throated tenor glory notes, and at times into a gorgeous falsetto, all seamlessly.<br />It is often unabashedly bombastic, but for me, when an artist with this much talent is that passionate about what they are saying, I find them hard to ignore! And trust me, if any of us had a voice this resonant and powerful, we'd use it accordingly.There are tender moments throughout, but this is a big record from a guy with a big message and a big Voice. He's a very declaratory artist. (But town criers ought to be declaring things! hehee)  Turn it up!<br /><br />This Loud Morning is a complex, multi-layered endeavor replete with beautiful details, from lush orchestration, vocal and instrumental countermelodies and musical tie-ins, to dashes of exotic, unusual instruments such as theremin, glockenspiel, and children's chorus, thanks to Matt Serletic's masterful strokes. It must be listened to several times before any fair judgment can be made. (Actually, every artist deserves this courtesy but few receive it, sadly.) The musicians are highly skilled including Serletic himself who leaves no stone unturned in his production. I call him the George Martin (legendary Beatles producer) of today. This was an incredible artist/producer marriage and I hope he and Cook work together again. David's band-mates Neal \\"the doctor\\" Tiemann and Andy Skib are standouts, as well as the ever energetic young drummer, Kyle Peek, who is an incredible musician. Tiemann's work is beautiful, tasteful and quite intricate. Cook's bass player Monty Anderson adds a clear and melodic bass line, a firm foundation that I found easy to follow.<br /><br />There is a theme of loss on TLM, and of a need to escape from that loss, but there is no lack of hope and no dirge. In fact, a majority of the songs find me air-conducting wildly, infused with energy! Most who know of David Cook, also know that he lost his brother and won a huge, life changing singing competition within about a year of each other: from the highest of highs, to the lowest of lows. This record reflects thatas David bares his heart and soul, yet never really mentions the death per se. It is more in the context of lost love but one can't help but think that the profound loss of a brother had to find its way here. The result is an incredibly personal and at times heart-wrenching experience. But ever hopeful. And always powerful.<br />Which leads me to the songs. The opening track is an absolute show/heart stopper called<br />(1) Circadian, which grabs your attention immediately with glockenspiel and toy piano, of all things, and an undeniable energy, a cog turning, the sense of a beginning of a musical journey, yet a crisis. A perfect opener. I love the cries for help. Who cannot relate to the chorus \\"mayday, somebody save me!\\"?? This song makes me weep at times it is so powerful. I felt like falling to the floor the first time I heard it played really loudly. It is one of the best songs I have heard in a very long time, about the escape into sleep which is his only respite from the pain and difficulty of this world. Again, who cannot relate to that? It sets up the rest of the record. It is so raw, so haunting, especially with the children's choir innocently echoing his fervent callout, \\"mayday somebody save me\\" at the end. Just incredible. Their sweet voices are dreamlike.<br />(2) Right Here, With You is a joyous, affirming love song. Very alive. (It could even be a wedding song for the right couple.) He could be dreaming of better days when he and his love were happily together. It makes my top five list, but that took hearing it a few times. It has a stunning bridge where David soars higher and higher into falsetto then Neil's solo takes off on the same note. The whole thing brings to my mind an image of a beautiful, clear brook in Colorado dancing along happily over pebbles. or something like that. !!!<br />(3) We Believe is a glorious anthem that should be utilized by my favorite hockey team. (hmmm..who to contact in the Ducks' organization..but I digress!) There are spots where I could imagine Steve Perry singing this in his glory days. It's no surprise that I mention him because I believe that Cook is the best rock tenor since Perry. They both sing with every fiber of their being but David has an edge, actually, because of the freedom, dark tone, and the lower/middle voice. Their high notes are equally glorious but different. We Believe makes me want to believe. Another great bridge at work here, with a strange instrument, the theremin, bringing a latter 60s Beatles sound. The lyrics are hopeful, the melody uplifting but there is an undercurrent of pain that birthed them.<br />(4) Fade Into Me is a lilting love song about the oneness that can only exist in a love relationship. It's in 6/8 time, or waltz time so it gives it a soft feel, and a respite from the huge choruses although David holds nothing back. He sings it beautifully; he soars. At the end there is an interesting countermelody that seems to be a musical reference but I am not certain yet whether it is from another song or just a nice synth string melody. But I have a feeling it is a motif of some sort since Serletic does this quite often. This is where his classical background makes all the difference. (He is brilliant, as is Cook, obviously.)<br />(5) Hard To Believe is one of the best songs  on the record, a virtual masterpiece. It starts like a simple little ditty, almost nursery-rhyme-like, then just builds and builds to a breathtaking climax of overlapping countermelodies that are goose bump worthy every time. It is perfect from beginning to end; stunning. The lyrics belie the simple tune at the beginning, for they touch deeply on a loved one losing faith, and present the singer in first person as the supporter. \\"I'm right here, I'm right here...\\"  It's powerful. She, alas, is unsure. He holds a crazy high Bb. Also in my top five best.<br />(6) Take Me As I Am seemed too simplistic and repetitive to me at first, lyrically. But I think I get it now. It's another universal theme that everybody can relate to. Who on this earth doesn't want to be loved \\"as is??\\" He belts desperately \\"take me as I am, take me as I am.\\" He repeats it almost like it's a chant. (But not for monks.) It's in a \\"fat\\" key, Eb major, which adds to the weight of his plea, which is basically let's try one more time to make this thing work.<br />(7) in Time Marches On he is trying to come to terms with the loss of the relationship. It is ambiguous in its message: \\"it was the last thing I needed, all I needed.\\" I love the chord changes and use of dissonance (flat 6) in the bass line. Very cool changes. \\"Time marches on without you\\" could apply to a lost love or also someone lost due to death. It is a heavy message, but the song, again, is not a dirge. The signature distorted guitar chords strummed evenly on the divided beats keep it rocking on. Or marching on, as it were.<br />(8) the first single, The Last Goodbye, is another ambiguous track because the melody is upbeat yet the lyrics are about goodbye which is never easy. I have called it crisp and concise and a friend (hi Pandora) likened it to opening a bottle of champagne. It's fizzy! It is radio ready! It's exactly 3 minutes long! But seriously, it is an excellent song. I love the dichotomy. At this point he is doing better about the breakup. The song is in D major, a bright and cheery key, and although it is the last goodbye, he is kind of okay with letting her go.<br />(9) in Paper Heart his (our) emotions have arisen again. Grief comes in waves. I love the use of syncopation here (accents on the upbeat or weak beat rather than the downbeat), because it is slightly unsettling and matches the lyrics. It's another catchy earworm like The Last Goodbye, but more pain sneaks out. It's more vulnerable. I also love the image of a paper heart in the rain and how fragile that is.<br />(10) 4 Letter Word seems to be about holding on, with a touch of denial and even anger. In the grieving evolution that I perceive, the storyteller is trying to not let it get away...I think he knows it is inevitable, but he tries anyway. Musically it is not a favorite for me, but certainly has outstanding singing, another strong bridge and lush backing vocals at the end which are noteworthy.<br />(11) It is time to say Goodbye To The Girl, but it isn't easy. The melody has a stunning arc and David sings it sans rasp. It is as clear as a bell and breathtaking. I wish we heard this a little more often because it is such a pure sound. The poetic lyrics have a beautiful ring to them, and in David's voice it doesn't get much better than this. In my top three.<br />(12) Rapid Eye Movement. Wow. This is no lightweight record and it isn't going to end that way either. He seems to be trying to get back to sleep yet \\"the blinding lights of day\\" are hovering. \\"This loud morning\\" is calling. He is fighting it. We're fighting it. But even in dreams that person we lost is there. For me personally sleep isn't always an escape because of dreams. Regrets. Losses. Musically this is another stunning piece and he bares it all. The piano break is played to perfection by only one who has studied Mozart. (Matt S.. again, the classical training infused into a rock record. win-win.) The song ends wistfully and dreamlike with the Circadian motif \\"mayday, somebody save me now\\" sung again by the children. Absolute perfection. This. Loud. Morning. can. not. be. ignored.<br />There are two bonus tracks on the deluxe version which I highly recommend. (13)This Is Not The Last Time is where hope springs eternal, even in the daylight. This bright track shows off a likable key change and David holding a gorgeous, fat tenor high C. He goes up to the D as well(!) briefly. What a treat! (14) Let Me Fall For You is one that I might have chosen for the main CD, it is so good. It keeps growing on you like a good pair of jeans. David sings over David in a cool, distorted countermelody and we are left totally uplifted.<br /><br />TLM is a significant and catenated work, and also very \\"alive\\". Cook has graduated into the potential artist many saw in 2008 and before. Please give this a record a chance as you will not be sorry! It doesn't need to necessarily reinvent the wheel; it is enough to just do it way better than most. (observe Mozart, my friends!)<br />Thank you for reading my long review, dear reader!<br />Oh and what ARE my top five?  Circadian, Hard To Believe, Goodbye To The Girl, REM, and Right Here, With You.  *subject to change* :)<br />4 Letter Word might be in there next week! ;D It's already grown on me since I wrote this!n this earth doesn't want to be loved \\"as is??\\" He belts desperately \\"take me as I am, take me as I am.\\" He repeats it almost like it's a chant.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I enjoyed this game. Puts to use your phones touch screen, allows for quick response and skill building techniques.  Mistouch/misclick can cause you to lose!<br /><br />Basic strategy is to build sun producing plants so you can continue to keep planting to keep up with flood of zombies.  Early game do not overkill the zombies, try and figure out the kill distance each plant has for each type of zombie and plant offensive plants as late as you can.  This will allow you to plant more sun producing plants making it easier later. Look through the almanac to review what the plants do,  descriptions dont give full detail but good overview on plant/zombies.<br /><br />Acheivements are fun to work towards. Would like to see a multiplayer version of this game over wifi to allow you 1v1 your friends.  Also would like to see an infinite zombie level with increasingly difficult zombies coming out.  This would be fun to see how long you could survive and set records with that time.
B0002S947K|4.0|I bought this CD here on Amazon last week after seeing Ray on The Artist's Den on television and being so intrigued by his airy- raspy and yet other times very strong voice. Had never heard of him before, and did not leave the spot in front of the television once until the entire episode was over.<br />  His lyrics about life and love are so thought-provoking and the simple guitar strums and riffs are beautiful, combined. The majority of the CD ( like the live show)  has several other instruments played by the accompanying band. Soft Electric guitar, ( Not rocker style) drums, violin, piano, etc.. Ray plays the harmonica and this can be heard in one or two songs as well.<br /><br />I would agree that his influences are VERY varied. Soulfoul, folk-ish, a little country, etc.. a nice mixture of sounds and styles. His music certainly could not be catagorized easily. I suppose it is soulful-folk. :)<br /><br /> This CD contains just 10 songs, 8 of which are slow songs. Two songs are more upbeat, \\"jazzy\\"-ier songs. Two songs have apparent female back-up ( not duets).  All are beautiful and thoughtfully written.<br />While Ray's guitar playing is very \\"simple\\", he is a GREAT writer and sings from the soul, making the simplest tunes most captivating. It was a must-buy for me immediately after seeing him on TV last weekend, playing to a small live audience who were swaying and singing along, many in tears.<br /><br />Buy it with no expectation of a dance CD or a real \\"happy tunes\\" line-up, though it's awesome background music for any small chatty get-together. Also know that it is mostly romantic in nature. Nice for other things.<br /><br />No regrets, really. Wish the CD had more than ten songs and will look forward to a little more upbeat tunes from him, too.  Can't wait to hear more.
140053271X|5.0|When I first saw the new Simple touch Nook being offered on the B&N website I knew I had to have it.  I have the 1st generation Nook and I love it, but I was always envious of my friends NookColor's touchscreen.  Now, I didn't want all the bells and whistles that the NookColor or the 1st Gen Nook has, I just wanted a simple eReader and I got that and more.  I think what I love best about the Simple Touch Nook is how light it is, I can hold it in one hand and if I put it in my bag or purse it doesn't weigh it down.  The touch screen is very responsive and makes turning pages a whole lot more simpler than my 1st gen Nook.  The e-ink seems a little bit more crisper than on the 1st gen Nook and being able to adjust the font size is great!  I do miss the replaceable battery of the 1st Gen Nook, but the battery life on the Simple Touch is amazing!  I got mine on June 3rd and charged it up to 100% and I haven't charged it since.  Now of course I don't read as much as some do...I maybe average about 1 hour a day, but to go almost an entire month and not have to charge the battery is amazing.  I wish they would offer a silicone frame for it, because the cover I have for it adds more weight.  I will say that a cover really isn't necessary, the Simple Touch front has a rubberized frame that invites you to use without a cover though you might just want to use a cover for protection when you're not reading.  It's just a wonderful eReader.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Was skeptical at first about this product but am really pleased with it.Sounds great with good bass and you can easily tell where every sound comes from.I hear sounds like bullets whizzing past my ear and enemy noises that I just didnt hear without these.The only thing I have against it is you can only turn it up so loud.But that is minor because I almost always turn it down anyway.And it will use up a pair of AA batteries in about 15 hours just get a battery charger and rechargable battereis.Overall a very good headset.
B0044ZYJQS|3.0|Sequels are notoriously difficult to pull off. While the first Iron Man was great, this one just comes off as well, a sequel. The plot is basically an excuse to give Iron Man another villain. Unfortunately, this is where things fall apart. Rather than have an interesting plot the builds over time, the film just pits Iron Man against a Russian super genius Vanko who wants revenge against the stark family. I suspect that part of the problem is that Iron Man was simply too powerful in the first movie, so the producers never found a suitable challenge for the hero. Indeed, as far as the plot goes, you could substitute almost any comic book hero and not tell the difference.    However, unlike most comic book movies nowadays, Robert Downey Jr.'s (Stark/Iron Man) performance makes up for some of the weaknesses in the plot. His carefree attitude and sassiness are a joy to watch. He personifies the secret desire many of us have to just give the world the finger (in fact, he nearly does do that during testimony before the Senate). The film has some strong moments when Stark realizes he might die soon and struggles with how to live the rest of his life. But these parts are too few and too far in between to save the plot. Overall, I'd give the film 3.5 stars.

He personifies the secret desire many of us have to just give the world the finger (in fact, he nearly does do that during testimony before the Senate). The film has some strong moments when Stark realizes he might die soon and struggles with how to live the rest of his life. But these parts are too few and too far in between to save the plot. Overall, I'd give the film 3.5 stars.

0756405890|5.0|For Patrick Rothfuss's first novel this is an amazing story filled with such detail that it deserves to be read by all fantasy lovers and non-fantasy people a like. Each sentence has meaning to it. The story is tight and emersive. I got this book because it was on a summer reading list for fantasy and I never regret buying this book. It was such an easy read and story flow was so perfect that I didn't want to put it down, even at part that where slow. The characters felt real and their actions didn't seem odd or out of place. Most of all the world seemed vast and it feals like he created a world where other stories could live. All in all Pat you did an amazing job with this book. I can't wait to get my hands on The Wise Man's Fear. You have earned a fan for life!
B003UESJH4|2.0|I have ordered this movie twice and have talked with Amazon reps who say they will send the PG 13 version, but unfortunately they are R rated,  even though it says PG 13 on their web site.  Amazon has been very good about letting me send them back with free shipping, but I have had to go to UPS twice and pay for the handling of bubble envelopes, a bit of a hassle.  The most frustrating thing is that Amazon still states that there is a PG 13 version available.  Please fix this if only the R rated format is available.
B003R4ZMJU|4.0|I wasn't sure what to think of this when the ad for the preview came on the television earlier in the year, having never read the series it was based on and hearing the hype about said books, it made me very curious how the show would turn out. I have to admit after the first episode I tuned in every week or as many weeks as I could to watch this little tv drama. I suppose the only negative thing I have to say about it was that wondering who was really behind the Ally notes got a little boring after my curiosity was prolonged too long. But the actors were really good and it didn't seem corny to me so I was a happy camper for the most part :) I will definitely be buying this at some point, I suppose you could say i am kind of hooked on its mystery :)
B00127RAJY|5.0|Wow. This is by far the best workout dvd I've ever owned. Jillian is amazing and she really motivates you! What I love about this is that it's so short (only 20 minutes) but you really see results. I am now in level 3, after much pain and sweat, but since they are short I do level 3 every day and also each day I alternate between level 2 and 1. I would recommend this to anyone. You just have to stay dedicated!
1455821012|5.0|I have the CD version and I often play it in the car.  It seems like I hear something new each time I listen.  Always sparks ideas and helps me to recommit.  At times I think it's a bit simplistic, but then, I get so much from it, maybe this approach is just the way it should be.
0316056863|2.0|I only managed to force myself to get through 1/2 of this book. I just can't read anymore. I didn't find it funny at all. I love Tina Fey & wanted so very badly to love it. I was really looking forward to reading something funny but I just couldn't get through it. If you are planning on getting it for the Kindle as I did, I suggest sampling it 1st.
B00005N7Z1|5.0|Robocop(1987) is a classic, action packed sci-fi film. It's also packed with social satire and dark humor. This is the strongest of the three Robocop movies. Dutch director Paul Verhoeven(Spetters, Soldier of Orange) does a superb job directing the film. Alex Murphy(Peter Weller) is killed by criminals in a run down, dystopian, futuristic Detroit. State of the art cybernetics resurrect him as a crime fighting robot police officer. Nancy Allen is very good as Anne Lewis, Robocop's partner. She's sexy, robust, and convincing as a tough, sympathetic woman. I am glad I didn't watch Carrie(1976) first!   Kurtwood Smith(That 70's Show, Star Trek) is effective as low life crime boss Clarence Boddicker. Ronny Cox is good as a corrupt OCP executive and Miguel Ferrer plays a corrupt, ego-driven, Frankenstein-like creator of the Robocop Program.   Robocop takes place in the not-too-distant future, but it spoofs the 1980's era it was made in. When I saw Robocop on TV, the violence and foul language was heavily censored. The late Basil Poledouris wrote a superb music score for Robocop. It's driven by synthesizers, but sounds more symphonic as Robocop slowly becomes human again. I remember TV spots for Robocop action figures for children. Wasn't Robocop an R-rated movie? Nevermind. Robocop spawned two sequels, a live action TV show, an animated TV show, a mini-series on the Sci-Fi Channel, and some weird TV spot in Korea where Robocop tried to eat fried chicken! Crow from Mystery Science Theater 3000 once poked fun of Robocop's nemesis, ED-209(\\"They can't make a robot that can walk down stairs?\\"). Robocop is a keeper.
B004WOS3P4|3.0|Originally, I gave this four stars but after a week's worth of listening, I have to go down one. This is not a bad CD. Some songs are quite good but it isn't a great CD. I wish DC had pushed it a little more. Feels just like a continuation of his debut, David Cook. But full disclosure here, I'm a musical idiot--    #3 We Believe - I can envision it as a closing credit song.   #4 Fade into Me -- Sure to be used on Dancing with the Stars next year as a waltz tune - not meaning to slight      either DWTS or David Cook - it just seems like it would work well in that manner   #9 Paper Heart -- liked it  #11 Goodbye to the Girl -- love the song but I wish it had a different title, it just seems a little impersonal to me.
0553381695|4.0|Having just finished A Clash of Kings on the heels of A Game of Thrones, I was relieved to find that the second book in the series held to the same quality standards as the first: the gritty realism that is one of the hallmarks of this series continues with Martin pulling no punches when it comes to \\"telling it like it is\\". Westeros is at war. War is violent and chaotic...and this book conveys that sense in a very direct and strong way.    Similar to Game of Thrones, there are only two major protaganists in a direct position of authority with a majority of the story and the events of the various \\"Kings\\" told from the perspective of either Ned Stark's children or people with close relationships to the \\"Kings\\". Having dispersed the Stark family to the various corners of Westeros, Martin is able to provide a realm-wide perspective that is cleverly told and complex without being overbearing.    Martin continues his deft use of subtle hints to possible future events interlaced into the story thread in such a way that the reader is given a window into what could be. It is their decision whether or not they choose to believe it. The great strength of his work is that sometimes these hints become reality and sometimes he introduces a plot twist. You never know which way its going to go and by not knowing...you feel compelled to continue turning the pages until you see the resolution. What seperates this book from the previous one is that he doesn't need to spend time introducing the major characters. Instead, he jumps right in and brings in additional political factions to boot.     I rated Game of Thrones as 5 stars. I rate this one as 4 and I need to explain why. A Game of Thrones was an incredibly rich storyline with Martin able to walk the tightrope on having multiple story arcs told from different people's perspectives who are located in entirely different parts of the world without the reader coming away with a disjointed feeling. That is because he spends about equaltime between all of the major characters and has a very clear story to tell with each of them. I did not have that same feeling having finished A Clash of Kings. In particular, the chapters focusing on Dany seem tacked on...almost as if he knew he needed to give that major characters some seat time, but didn't feel like he had the time or space to really develop that story arc for this book.     The second reason I give this book 4 stars is because Martin's plot twists this time around lacked the punch of the last book. Of course...it would take a monumental effort to repeat the experience of Ned losing his head, but what made that so special was that you had a very firm grasp of the characters involved, you understood the gravity of the situation, you were holding out on a hope that Martin was explicitly stringing you along, and after it happens you look back on Ned's story and realize there's no way that could have ended any other way. This time around the plot twists, particularly the final one at Winterfell, seemed to come out of the blue and involved characters that were barely mentioned previously. In one instance I found myself having to flip back to prior chapters just to find out who was involved.     That being said...this series remains (through book 2 at least) one of the best fantasy series I've read in a long time. I found myself unable to put the book down and compelled to turn the next page just to see what happens...despite being a book clocking in at over 700 pages for a large trade paperback.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Lost all of my progress on level 4-7 due to an incoming call. I am so sick of Popcap's half assed efforts on the Android OS. Bejeweled with no Blitz mode, don't get me started on Chuzzle, and now a game that can't retain your save game file because *gasp* a PHONE CALL CAME THROUGH!?! Thank God these were free downloads...but I can't be bothered to waste anymore time / money on Popcap.
B0050CQY1W|4.0|Breath of fresh air.<br /><br />Though I loathe the hard and over singing sometimes (you have a great voice, no need to over do it, let it flow!), this is a nice album.  Definitely for the older set.  I'm not one that feels age should dictate the kind of music you should make, but it's nice to hear a mature sound from her.  Kinda puts you in the mind of \\"Dangerously In Love\\" with it's more R&B oriented influence.  The flow of the album is also nice--her previous albums, for me, didn't really seem as cohesive.  It starts off slow/mid-tempo, then picks up momentum towards the end.  Nothing really bad to say except that \\"Run The World\\" completely throws the album off.  I'm interested in how she will tour with this new project, and future videos.  Also curious as to how the fans that have liked her other stuff will feel about this.<br /><br />Good music.
B004WOS7LO|5.0|As a person who is a huge fan of country music, there are few pop or rock CDs that I will by. Certain groups that I grew up listening to (such as Matchbox Twenty, Gin Blossoms, and especially Sister Hazel and the very underrated band Nine Days), I still listen to regularly. And of course REO Speedwagon is one of my favorite bands.  As a whole though, current pop and rock music is not something I generally gravitate towards.    But David Cook is a definite exception to the rule.  Cook has a remarkable voice and his music is flat-out enjoyable.  He is versatile and can sing rockers and ballads equally well.    With \\"This Loud Morning\\" Cook has put out a stellar sophomore album.  Give it a listen.      UPDATE:  Meant to include this, but here are my \\"standout tracks\\" on the album:  \\"Fade Into Me\\"  \\"Paper Heart\\"  \\"4 Letter Word\\"  \\"Goodbye to the Girl\\"

B004ODLUF8|2.0|I wanted to hear the narration and the words of the astronauts, but the music drowned out everything.   This is a problem I have found with a lot of DVDs lately.   The music is supposed to be in the background, and the spoken words should be audible, but they got it backwards.   I wonder if it was like this in the movie theater, or is this just sloppy transferring at the disc level?   The images, though, are wonderful.   Sharp and clear.   I wanted to see more of the Hubble pictures, too.  There was too much of the suiting up and so on, and not enough space photos.    -

B001718JNQ|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2TPM1Z2DWOULS]]The DVD included in this gift set is the Special Edition - it is a two-disc set.  The set includes many bonus features, which includes on-set footage and interviews with Johnny Depp and director Tim Burton.<br /><br />The book is incredible (see video).  It is approx. 175 pages long, and features a lot of text.  The book discusses the making of the film, and also includes excerpts from the screenplay.  But most impressive are the gorgeous color photos - just about every page has at least one photo.  Among the images included are stills from the movie, set photos, and concept art including sketches by Tim Burton.<br /><br />The outer box is a cardboard-type material - it's not very durable.

I'm glad I did because it has alot of slower R&B type joints, very 90's type R&B... I say if u are a TRUE R&B fan then go ahead and purchase this, but if u are into the Sasha fierce type beyonce then this ain't the album for u...     BEST TRACKS***  Start Over  I Miss You  I Care  Countdown  Party f/ Kanye and Andre 3000      Pure R&B
B000002J1S|4.0|I always looked at The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway the same way you could look at The Beatles \\"Let It Be\\", or Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\"- a very good indication that it was the beginning of the end of some aspect of the band. In this case, it was Peter Gabriel's impending departure. I think what you have in these situations is just a matter of too much genius in one small space of a band. 4 or 5 incredible musicians, all with incredible ideas as to where they feel the band should be going artistically. This is what I feel reflected in The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway. It's not a \\"bad\\" album by any stretch of the imagination. The Genesis of that time period couldn't have produced bad music even if they tried. It just seems a little \\"lost\\" to me. Not cohesive, like their other early works. If you're new to the \\"old\\" Genesis, this would probably be the last album I would recommend picking up. Go to Foxtrot, Selling England, or even Nursery Crimes, before this one.
B00003CXD5|5.0|Considering John Huston's demanding, frantic production schedule, it's amazing \\"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\" was ever finished (let alone that it won so many Oscars and an enduring place in classic American movie history).<br /><br />Based on enigmatic author B. Traven's survival-of-the-fittest-themed novel, 3 down-and-out Americans set out to find gold in the dangerous Sierra Madre Mountains of 1920s Mexico.<br /><br />The first part of \\"Treasure\\" spends its time showing empoverished Tampico, Mexico and how it drives men to do desperate acts to survive. This is where the movie's main characters are introduced: Howard, Curtain, and Fred C. Dobbs. Of the three, Humphrey Bogart's Fred C. Dobbs is the most interesting. Though Howard--the elderly leader of the trio--is probably more crutial in keeping the tempo of the movie hopping (with his near-inexhaustible enthusiasm and vigor).<br /><br />But Howard is pretty even-keeled throughout \\"Treasure\\". Dobbs, on the other hand, slowly and believably drifts from down-and-out into the irrecoverable depths of paranoid-delusional deviance, exhibiting almost every symptom of the gold fever Howard warned his colleagues about before setting out.<br /><br />It's interesting how Huston crafted Dobbs. We get a fairly detailed bio of Howard: a career gold miner who's \\"dug all over the world\\" and \\"seen what gold does to men's souls.\\" The other miner, Curtain, is a no-nonsense former fruit grower from California. But there's precious-little about Dobbs's background.<br /><br />Yet, Bogart makes the character fully human and elevates his importance in the film. Dobbs is the one who teaches us about the true costs of greed and selfishness. And Bogart captures every nuiance necessary to teach that lesson, making Dobbs sometimes laughable, sometimes frightening, but always mesmerizing in his seismic shifts between sympathetic weariness, dynamic deviance, and sheer insanity. And the advantage of this 2 DVD special edition is that it goes into greater detail about Bogart's acting methods and feelings about the character.<br /><br />It's great \\"Treasure\\" survived and eventually thrived. But it was too bad the Academy didn't recognize the importance and substance of Fred C. Dobbs. Because not only it was it arguably Boggie's best performance, but it's what makes \\"Treasure\\" shine.to greater detail about Bogart's acting methods and feelings about the character.<br /><br />It's great \\"Treasure\\" survived and eventually thrived.

B003B02O0A|5.0|This was my first Grisham novel and it has turned me into a fan. There is plenty of racism and no shortage of real modern problems. While I believed that Hailey was wrong for taking the law into his own hands in such a way, I believe the rapists got what they deserved. Ending was a little anticlimactic even though it was pretty good.

B00009RAJH|5.0|While I may not be the biggest Fleetwood Mac fan in the world, there is no denying the quality of the records they made in the mid to late `70s. Although not a debut in the true sense of the term, their self-titled 1975 LP was by a brand new lineup and heralded a dramatic change in the band's fortunes. The story of this famous collaboration between California folkies and English blues veterans does not need repeating here but I'll just say that I've always loved \\"Monday Morning\\" while \\"World Turning\\", \\"Blue Letter\\" and \\"Over My Head\\" really grew on me. Never really cared for the other big hits on the LP but their reputations as classic rock staples are beyond dispute. I think the true mark of a classic album is that several songs that are not the big, overplayed hits or grab the casual listener as much as the long-time fan are the ones that make the record more memorable to more people. `Fleetwood Mac' though greatly overshadowed by the massive success of its successor is still a great album in its own right and created a true seventies super group out of the almost cult following that a veteran British blues band once had.

Making the monsters pop-out was ingenious because little people would not have the patience to do this amount of cutting. The backstories on the monsters are creative and halirious. The folds have been pre-scored, enabling the monsters to turn out so precise. I have 2 boys, ages 6 and 8. The 6 year old has needed some help with intermediate and advanced monsters but the 8 year old has been able to do every level. We have all enjoyed this project so much. Thank you!

0811875555|5.0|I have to agree with all the other reviewers here--this book is beautiful. It provides a wonderful and detailed glimpse into the making of \\"Tangled,\\" and includes tons of sketches, production art, and background information. You can see how the characters evolved from pre-production to post-production, and you can check out the many things that inspired the artists when creating the world featured in Tangled--from other Disney princess stories like Cinderella to some of the buildings in Disneyland!  It has quotes from the artists and interesting tidbits on all the main characters and settings.    My only gripe with the book is that it didn't really talk about how the voice artists affected the art work. I'm always fascinated to see how the actor providing the voice can help shape the character (see: Robin Williams as the Genie in \\"Aladdin\\"), so I would have liked to read about that.  But then again, since the book is called \\"The Art of Tangled\\" and not \\"The Making of Tangled,\\" I suppose that's all right.     This book is definitely a must for any Tangled fans--and it looks wonderful on any bookshelf.
B000FVE3AC|4.0|I typically wear a Timex Ironman but wanted to add a little more sophistication to the wardrobe.  This watch meets the challenge.  Beautiful and sporty look.  The face and ring are a fine fighter pilot deep blue and is easy to read in and out of the water.  The watch is heavy with girth. The stainless steel outer and band add the bling.  I took a star away because the directions that came in the box are generic which adds a little confusion to setting the watch for the first time.  Also, there were no directions on how to fit the band.  All and all a fine addition to the wardrobe.

Camelot has the most fem vision oF Arthur I have seen and poorly acted as well.  Eva Green as Morgan is the only redeeming thing in the show and sadly even that is not saying much.  Do not waste money on this one.
1401207529|3.0|While the artwork is beautiful, the story is ridiculous.  Batman does the impossible and wins out over a swat team.  He calls Bats to come his rescue.  From Batman's superhuman abilities to the ineptitude of the police officers, this does not make sense.  Batman is not Superman.
B0050LJIRK|4.0|I've been a huge Limp Bizkit fan since I was a kid. I sort of grew up with them and this album is a welcome comeback from the original lineup. I'd say it's very similar in style to Chocolate Starfish, which I loved. Gold Cobra's got a ton of KILLER riffs from Wes who I'm extremely glad is back in the band. So many oldschool style songs that I can't even pick my favorite. If you hated Limp Bizkit before, you will still hate them after listening to this. If you liked any of their stuff up to Chocolate Starfish, you will love this. That is all.
B00407PNWO|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  When I saw Amazon had it I was not only thrilled but the price was unbelievable and I was shocked at how quickly I received it.  Thanks Amazon.
B0054JURZA|3.0|I gotta say, I love Bon Iver.  \\"Skinny Love\\"...\\"re: Stacks\\"...\\"Blood Bank\\"...I could listen to those songs time and time and again and never get sick of them.  And so to say that I was looking forward to this second album would be an understatement.  But sadly, this album disappoints.  When I listened to this album I wasnt even convinced it was Bon Iver save for his unforgettable voice.  The music seems grandiose and haughty.  It reminds me of the one colleague we all work with who loves to hear himself talk, never shuts up, and eventually gets on your nerves.  Lyrically, the album isn't bad, but musically, it brought me down with its self-aggrandizing twists.  I got the feeling that the need to reinvent got way out of control and took on a mind of its own.  Basically, save your money and buy this off a friend or from the USED lists on amazon which should swell in the coming weeks with forgotten copies of this album.
0316010669|4.0|Blink is a Great book about thinking in a different way, this for sure takes your thinking in a different direction its not your every day reading book and that is whats great about it. With the separate stories in a story this approach keeps the reader on their toes and always keeps an interesting story going while still incorporating an all over flow throughout the book.  This book has been an information super highway, anyone who is looking for split second decision making tips this is the book to read. Malcolm is a skilled craftsman when it comes to writing and the things he can do anyone can appreciate. The overall tone of the book is strong and informative Malcolm knows what he wants to get across and he does a good job in doing so. This book is a good buy and can be passed around to anyone to read it is a quick read and never gets too complicated.  If you like to read or even if you don't like to read this is still the book for you its a great read and you will be satisfied when you are finished. The amount that I learned from this book was incredible and you will think this too. I hope you pick up this great read you will be one hundred percent satisfied with it.
1594744769|5.0|Jacob grew up hearing extraordinary tales from his grandfather about his childhood and life at a home in Wales for Jewish refugee children. His grandfather regaled him with tales of endless summer, children with incredible abilities such as invisibility and levitation, and horrific monsters. As Jacob grew older, he realized they were just stories, complete with well faked photographs to entertain his young imagination. But what if they weren't just stories? Now 16, Jacob is faced with the compelling possibility that his grandfather had been telling the truth and that his life may be in danger!<br /><br />First and foremost, I have to comment on the photographs! Ransom Riggs began collecting found photography at flea markets, often finding bizarre photographs such as the one on the cover, a little girl that appears to be floating approximately six inches off the ground. He then decided he wanted to build a story around the photos, resulting in the tale of Miss Peregrine's home for peculiar children, a term used in the book to denote individuals with special powers. The book is not only an eerie and enthralling story, but also possesses unique and fascinating photographs which add to the reading experience!<br /><br />The story takes an interesting perspective on time travel, and the unusual gifts that the kids possess give them a young X-Men vibe. Although this book is written for young adults, I definitely believe adults will also be entertained by the story! The book is well written, and successfully manages a coherent timeline and plausible means of time travel. Riggs paid attention to detail- rather than just running off for a month in Wales (as if anyone could afford to just up and leave for a month), he devotes a bit of time to explaining that Jacob's uncles own a large chain of businesses and therefore the family has a great deal of money. In books, details such as that are often overlooked, but I feel that it helps create a more realistic scenario. That said, the book isn't overwhelmingly laden with details, and actually moves at an engaging pace that keeps the reader from becoming bored.<br /><br />This haunting tale will keep you entertained for hours! It flows well, drawing you into the story in such a way that you lose track of time. I highly recommend this book to anyone! The elements of the supernatural and time travel create a story that is creepy and exciting- I was barely able to put it down! Riggs left the book at a point that makes it clear he intends to write a sequel, which I definitely intend to buy when it comes out!overwhelmingly laden with details, and actually moves at an engaging pace that keeps the reader from becoming bored.

0394818237|2.0|I absolutely loved Scarry books when I was a child, and I was happy to spend hours alone or with my younger cousins looking at all of the wonderful detail on each page.  It was with those memories that I decided to purchase several of the books for my 4-year old daughter.  I spent time looking over this particular title and was shocked at the lack of female characters engaged in any of the active or leadership roles.  It was disheartening.  I bristled at the thought of sending this sort of message to my child - that woman are great in support roles only - and decided to pass.  Back to looking for titles that make the whole wide world available to everyone, regardless of gender...
B0002W18MU|5.0|Some say his voice became frail or withered; I say life had burned away anything extraneous and left only the naked essence of the man's genius.  Brilliant.
B004LROMSO|5.0|I realize there are a lot of negative reviews for this series.  But I love it!  And I have seen and read many King Arthur versions in my life.  Of course, it is not perfect, none of them are really....but it is entertaining and a different take on the whole story.  I recommend it for entertainment value!!!
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The author took you right into the mind of a woman who wakes up everyday remembering nothing. From the first page you are engrossed. I thought it was a great read. I look forward to reading more from this author.
B004UQPM4E|5.0|My best buy so far on Amazon. Fast delivery, sealed around the box came in perfect condition. In all my purchases on Amazon, I was always treated with great dedication and respect. Congratulations once again!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|What a great way to waste time!  My kids and I are totally loving this game. Works perfectly on the Droid X.
