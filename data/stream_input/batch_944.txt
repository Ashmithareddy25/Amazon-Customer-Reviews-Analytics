B0000029AL|5.0|This was Aerosmith's debut album, and it was a good one. The only big hit it had was \\"Dream On\\".And that wasn't until 2 years later after \\"Toys in the Attic\\" was a hit. The rest of the songs are also good, \\"Dream On\\",\\"Mama Kin,\\" \\"Walkin' The Dog,\\" \\"Somebody\\", \\"Write me a letter\\",\\"Make It\\",\\"Movin' out\\" and \\"One Way Street\\" . They didn't know it, but only a few years after Aerosmith released their debut album, they would become rock phenomenons as soon as they released their Toys In The Attic album.
B000025H0Q|4.0|Bryter Layter is Nick Drake working with expanded orchestrations. [[ASIN:B00000064E Five Leaves Left]] has subtle string, but here, horns and even female singers  are added.<br /><br />This almost sounds like [[ASIN:B000058983 Forever Changes]], except that Love album ratiated Authur Lee as mastero, calling the shots. Drake seems to be a lone guitar player surrounded by adoring musicians on Bryrer Layer. His singing is mournful and self-effacing as ever.<br /><br />Which makes the album so effective. The musical buffer around Drakes subtle voice only highlights his poetic modesty as a singer. The contrast of his insinuating singing and the big shell of the arrangements works wonders. Listen to \\"One Of These Things First,\\"<br />or \\"Chime of the city clock.\\"<br /><br />\\"Poor Boy\\" is a bit much. When the singers sing \\"poor boy, feels sorry for himself,\\" towards Drake, it underminds the depths of his sadness. The whole piece is a little mellowdramatic and insulting to Drake, who was struggling with a serious mental illness.<br /><br />But even this song is a good spin, and the album as a whole is top notch.
B000001FFR|5.0|this 1985 masterpiece(belladonna's first full length album with the band) from anthrax is the follow up to fistfull of metal,both are high quality metal discs!this disc along with others kickstarted the thrash/speed metal scene which had been growing since the early 80`s,to me this disc has it`s place in metal history,along with slayer,metallica megadeth,the big four that basically changed the world of heavy music.
B0000009SI|4.0|On Apostrophie, Frank Zappa contines with the streemlined jazz funk he began[[ASIN:B0000009SG Over-Nite Sensation]]. The Duke/Underwood/Brock unit is back, Zappa's classically trained P-Funk.<br /><br />Here, the music is more stipped to basic grooves the band can jam on. Absolutely, their are Zappa's knotty elaborations, the start of \\"St. Alphonzo's Pancake Breakfast,\\" but \\"Don't Eat The Yellow Snow,\\" and \\"Stinkfoot,\\" are open formats that the band can jam on.<br /><br />But what makes this work is the virtuosity of Zappa's band, which create a lush funk canvas. This supports the format for the blazing solos. The rhythms may be basic, but the playing is fat and full and makes this hearty music.<br /><br />Great album that will compete with any 1970s funk disc.
B00004UEDQ|1.0|What was supposed to be a romantic evening with an attractive lady friend became an evening of sheer horror after seeing this film. While this movie may be billed as an upbeat comedy about a big-city newspaper columnist who is forced to go into rehab, it was anything but. First of all, Sandra Bullock is only in the film for about 2 minutes where she devours a screaming man and is cut up with a machete. The rest of the movie deals with a few people who are fighting for their lives against people going through sever withdrawal issues (rotting skin, vomiting blood, and trying to eat people's brains, etc.). The group fights their way out of an apartment building to find help from the military only to have to then fight off the soldiers who attempt to rape the women of the group. This movie literally left me shaking in tears and I never heard from my date again. Stay away from this move AT ALL COSTS!
B0000009SG|5.0|If people accused Zappa of selling out with the Flo and Eddie band, this only magnified with Overnite Sensation.<br /><br />With the salatious lyrics and reletively solid strong strucutes--a far cry from the dada of the origional MOI-Zappa was using a streemlined approach.<br /><br />But the guitar work on \\"Dirty Love,\\" and, particulaly \\"Montana,\\" show Zappa's six string approach was getting more dense, symphonic and compressed. Those 1960s leaps in playing he made on 1969s [[ASIN:B0000009S3 Hot Rats]] were here given more layers and applifacation.<br /><br />And if you want to call Overnite Sensation \\"commercial\\" (strictly or not,) you would have to give P-funk, the Ohio Players, Donald Byrd, Cannonball Adderly, 100s of jazz funk artists of the same period the same harsh sentence. This is not [[ASIN:B0000009S1 Uncle Meat]], with its musical micro-abstractions, but Zappa never said it was.<br /><br />With George Duke and Ruth Underwood and Napolian Brock, Zappa here had one of the best jazz funk outfits of the 1970s. This  holds up as  amazingly adept music.  He made it work. Listen to Overnite Sensation today and it sounds fresh and vibrent. And great to play loud.

B0000009SM|4.0|One Size Fits all may be the best in the trilogy with Zappa having George Duke in his band of Mothers aces. The other two albums are [[ASIN:B0000009SG Over-Nite Sensation]] and [[ASIN:B0000009SI Apostrophe (')]].<br /><br />On One Size, Zappa thinkens the groves and pumps the volume. The numbers here have the same rich funky char of the other two albums, but the rounder bass playing and raised ampifacation make this music heavier, and this supports massive solos, such as Zappa guitar juggernut, \\"Inca Roads.\\"<br /><br />There are also more backup vocals here, and if the music on Apostrphe sounded just a little thin at times, that on One Size Fits All more than compensates.<br /><br />Zappa seems to, here, have fully developed how to match the simpler, riff-based music he was exploring with this band to the rigourous musicanship he always aspired to and always succeeded at. You can listen to this as art rock or funk.<br /><br />As long as you listen. Soon.
B0029NY9YO|5.0|SPOILERS BELOW.<br /><br />I just loved this movie. Bear in mind that I usually do not like movies like Transformers, 2012, the Michael Bay ones, Con Air, Mission Impossible (the second part is the worst of all) stuff like that. Also, I also go for comic adaptations with suspicious. But, after \\"IRON MAN\\", I thought they could really work.<br /><br />I was  in the middle of part five of the graphic novel (yes, that's a sin, never read it before), when I watched the movie. I don't know if it was the good mood I was in the day, whatever, but the movie got me by the opening sequence and I never got bored or disappointed. I just loved it, every single bit of it (and, like it semms to be the case with many fans, Roscharch was my favorite character.<br /><br />First, up until I had read the novel, I thought it was a faithful adaptation. Second, the cinematography was spectacular. Casting and costume design were on the spot, it was like the comics were alive. And, thankfuly, the editing was great. You could see the fights, see what's happening, instead of these modern lightning-cut editing tha people seem to enjoy today.<br /><br />The adpaptation was clearly handled with care and affection by people involved; However, I can understand some negative points mentioned by some reviewers. We must remember director Snyder was behind cameras in DAWN OF THE DEAD and 300 (which I did not like at all). So, he clearly enjoys some gore. But, overall, given the lenght of the movie and the potential scenes to use graphical gore, he kept his instincts at bay... He only goes for it with full throttle in the scene when Roscharch kills the raper. Also, thre is Dr. Manhattan pulverizing Vietnamese people, The Comedian killing a pregnant woman,the overall annihilation of a number of cities around the world. But these last ones are done without so much graphic description. And, remember: the scenes (or at least the idea) ARE in the comics!<br /><br />Like I said, I loved this movie.

B002KQ6BT6|1.0|Dan Brown books are always exciting -- I enjoyed The Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons however controversial they may be. I even watched the movies based on these books. I would rate this book at 5 stars but because of Kindle DRM I must rate it 1 star. Digital Restrictions Management or Digital Rights Management as DRM vendors call it restrict users freedoms and fair use rights. Earlier this year (2009) Amazon had a public relations nightmare when they remotely and automatically deleted George Orwell's 1984 book off of Kindles without the Kindle owners permission. This was after Amazon apparently realized they were licensed the right to sell electronic copies of the book from a company that did not have the right to license it to them. Instead of just removing it from the Kindle Store they removed it from all Kindles and one student using the book in a class who was keeping notes not only lost his copy of the book but all his notes and began suing Amazon. No company should have such power -- DRM needs to become socially unacceptable and some advances in making it so have fortunately already occurred.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I found Susan Boyle's first album to be everything I thought it would be and more. Many of the songs on the album were songs that I was familiar with. Susan sings these classics with her unique style  that made me fall in love with them all over again. Long after I have listened to the album I find myself playing the songs over and over in my head. I wish Susan all life's best in her career and look forward to any future cds that she makes. Signed a happy and devoted fan.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|I love this album! I hardly ever buy whole albums anymore but every John Mayer cd is in my music library. This album is great just like his previous albums. I can't stop listening to it! I highly recommend this album. My best friend is also addicted to this cd. Anytime you get in my car, turn on my Ipod, or walk into my house, you are going to hear this cd!
0143116371|5.0|I bought this for my fashionista daughter.     I looked through the book. I expected -- I dunno -- a written chronicle of current fashion.  The book really is an album of candid fashion snaps from fashion capitals.    The eye of the photographer for the weird, the glam and the frankly fabulous is spot on.    This book will inspire you to think of fashion in a new way, as you see how people invent their way of dress every day.  Very highly recommended. It proves a picture really is worth a thousand words.
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|the most likely source of this books crappiness is that brown chose to focus on the rather well known freemasons instead of some group that is lessin the mainstream.  add the tired unbelievable robert langdon and the whole thing just dissolves into complete gibberish.  since when is harvard symbologist a remotely believablejob title.....brown needs a new schtick forhis next book.
0689878451|1.0|I don't know if this was the intent of the author but from appearance this book is a \\"politically correct\\" statement to push the idea of homosexual relationships on children. That idea itself is shameful given the age this is directed at.<br /><br />And now this \\"true story\\" is no longer true. Silo eventually found a female mate and no longer is considered \\"homosexual\\".<br /><br />In fact, if you look up the case of Silo and Roy, you will note that the zookeepers wanted to introduce female mates but the gay organizations argued against it so the zookeepers backed off (thus leaving the two male penquins alone). If the zookeepers were allowed to do their job, rather than appease political correctness, these two birds probably would have had female mates and their own offspring years ago. Thus, I feel environment was the true culprit.
031606792X|1.0|I would not write this review if the book is not so disgusting and disturbing.  The first three books have attached me to the characters, especially Jake.  And I just watched the New Moon movie.  I really regretted to have openned the fourth book.   The idea of Jake being Bella's son-in-law is just so disgusting. Puke, puke, puke.  What the hell the author is thinking?  Is she out of her mind?  It is almost the first time that I couldn't finish a book.   So disgusted and disappointed.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|The sound is lovely, even on the awkward stereo-splits of the early albums.  Even though the \\"unveiling\\" metaphors used by some reviewers are exaggerated, it's a pleasure in all the ways they have noted.  The packaging is fun, too.  But the marketing. . . It would have been so easy to include Mono and Stereo in one package, and the mercenary instincts that separated them make even more of a joke of the \\"All you need is love\\" sentiment.  But the musical pleasures are real enough.  The video \\"mini-documentaries\\" are a clever conceit--hidden tracks on each album, all making up one meta-album on DVD.  But their content is not up to overall excellence.  Short little bits with the usual cut-outs and photo-effects, not terribly revealing about anything despite the never-before-seen claims.  But when it comes down to it--I saw, I bought, I loved it.  Since the Stereo has come, can the Mono be far behind?

B00005V9IK|1.0|The most positive aspect of the movie was the fight scenes.  I have to say that the fight scenes were very well done, and I actually found them preferable to the space fights in the newer Star Wars movies which are famous for their special effects.  There was an element of believability in the Air Force vs. Aliens which minimized the need for suspended disbelief.  Another strong point in the movie was the way they depicted the reactions and mass hysteria to the aliens hovering over the cities.  The looting, and the congestion due to a disorderly panic induced exodus was a very believable and realistic reaction.  Finally, the blasting away of those alien worshiping hippie types was a nice touch, which also added realism.  My beliefs about aliens notwithstanding, if a group of aliens came to earth in a conspicuous fashion, no matter how menacing, twisted, or downright evil they appeared there would certainly be groups of hippies coming out with the \\"take us with you\\" blather.     Now for the weak points...  To make for easier reading I am going to divide the negative elements into subsections.     The Plot:    The best way I could describe the movie, is that it was like a comedy or spoof with all the humorous elements taken out.  I did not laugh once throughout the entire thing.  I have never cared much for Jeff Goldbloom, never found him funny, and Will Smith is usually funny, but not in this movie.  The humor, like every other attempt to generate an emotional reaction from me, was forced.  The plot is simplistic and dry.  The story is that a hostile civilization is coming to earth to eliminate humanity and drain all of earth's resources.  The aliens go to a planet, use up all the resources, then move on and repeat the process elsewhere.  They begin by destroying some major cities, and then they reposition themselves to destroy more.  They can't be stopped because they have forcefields, but fortunately Jeff Goldblooms character manages to create a virus to sabotaugetheir computers, they upload it, and then they blow up all the aliens.  That is the plot, a simple story which could be wrapped up in less than an hour.  Instead, they choose to prolong it, and they way they do so is by adding lots of characters and showing how they all react to the crisis, which amounts to many long protracted scenes of boring pointless dialogue.  One thing that was never addressed is what sort of resources the aliens were after.  Are they after material resources or energy resources, or both.  If all they are after is ore and building materials they could find that anywhere, there is no reason for them to go to earth or any other inhabitable planet for that.  If they are looking for an environment to grow crops and raise livestock (food production), then they would need a habitable planet, but the resources involved in that are renewable, so there would be no need for them to continue migrating unless they are either explorers or migrating to compensate for a growing population.  If they were looking for habitable worlds to compensate for a growing population then that would actually make sense, and it would allow the aliens to be a continual threat even if the humans won because they are in the business of colonizing.  Instead what they have is an enormous plot hole which probably exists for the purpose of getting across some environmentalist message.    The Characters:    I did not identify with a single one of the characters, nor did I particularly care about any of them.  Having lots of characters does not work for a movie.  For a movie it is ideal to have about two or three main characters, plus a few ancillary characters.  The reason for this is that in order to generate concern or an interest in the characters there has to be character development.  It takes time to develop characters, and the more characters there are the less time there is for development.  I did not care whether Will Smith or Jeff Goldblooms characters got blown up withthe alien space ship or survived.  I also did not care if Will Smith's stripper girlfriend survived, nor was I in any way moved by their wedding.  They interjected that wedding as time filler, why not just have them be married at the onset of the movie, and give her some other occupation besides being a stripper?  Then they would not have had to waste time with a wedding.  The only time having lots of characters works well, is when you have a TV series.  A TV series offers more time to properly develop the characters and build up concern for them on the part of the viewer.  The proper way to develop characters is to show them working together, interacting, solving a variety of problems over an appropriate time span (as opposed to cramming a lot into a short period), and gradually making their nuances evident over time.  In the first episode of Battlestar Galactica I did not care if any of the characters died, and some of them I actually hoped would die, but as the series progressed and the characters interacted with one another, faced different problems and overcame them, and as background information was added at moments where it was immediately pertinent, I came to care about the characters.  In Independence day it was as if they said, \\"here are a bunch of characters, you don't know anything about them but you should care about them and their plight...\\"  Well, I don't.  I did not care at all when the presidents wife died, she was just there.  They added her in and gave her a death scene to add drama and create an emotional stir, but I had no connection to the character because of the complete lack of development, and I didn't watch that movie for drama I watched it because I wanted to see a good story plus some cool fight scenes.  There were parts of the movie were I considered fasting forward through the lame drama and boring speeches to get on to the scenes where something is actually happening.     The Aliens:    The design of the aliens was highly unoriginal and cliche.  They basically took the stereotypical alien design, and added a large useless protuberance at the back of the head.  Maybe they tinkered around with the geometry of the limbs, but it was hard to tell because the only full body shots of the aliens were the ragged remains of the crash victims.  But regardless of that, the same overused cliche of the grossly disproportionate head relative to their bodies.  They also have the same overused, repulsive, demonic, stereotypical and cliche \\"alien\\" face.  I put \\"alien\\" in quotations because I do not at all believe that the stereotypical \\"alien\\" face is what aliens would be like if they existed in real life.  On the surface, I would say the grossly enlarged head relative to the body is based off of evolutionism, which has often taught that brain size, and consequentially head size, will increase in the future as it has allegedly increased in the past.  However, I also say that the features are demonic because there are ancient cultures which have used those features to represent evil spirits.  The fact of the matter is, it's overused, it's ugly, it's unoriginal, and it's a poor design.  The structure of the aliens is a poor design because there is no way they could walk.  The size of the necks could not support the weight of their grossly misproportioned head.  And the large pointless protuberance only exasperates the problem.  It is true that the tricerotops had a large bony protuberance emanating from the back of the skull, but that animal had a much larger body and thicker neck.  To hold up a head that size and to be able to turn it would require a much thicker more muscular neck.  The people who \\"designed\\" the aliens could argue that the aliens typically operate in low to zero G settings normally, except that given that an abrupt turn could easily result in a snapped neck.  It's a poor design, and it's unoriginal.  It is also insulting to my intelligence that they expect I would buy into the notion that such anabsurd and poorly designed creature could even walk.     The Message?:    There is a question mark because I am not 100% certain that this movie even had a message, but most movies usually do and there were some elements that could be inferred as messages.  What I saw in this movie was a makeshift one world government formed, and it appeared to me as though one world government was being touted as a good thing.  I am 100% opposed to one world government, and I do not particularly care for propaganda which advocates that in any form.  When the president was giving his speech about a world \\"independence day\\" it almost initiated a gag reflex in me.  In real life a one world government will inevitably lead to a regime worse than Hitler, with the added bonus of having no place to flee to.  I am very leery of anyone or anything which so much as appears to advocating a one world government.  Generally people who advocate a one world government hate freedom.     Conclusion:    This movie is not worth the time, it's a complete waste.  If you feel that you just HAVE to know about it because of peer pressure, then just read my synopsis and watch the fight scenes.  Skip over everything in between because it is slow, boring, pointless time filler.
B001MYIXAC|4.0|I can't comment on the subtitles, as I did not watch the original theatrical version of this film. Unless I happened to view the updated version with theatrical subtitles without knowing it, but I didn't see anything particularly flawed with them. There were some odd spots that, if I had the flawed version, may have been better explained in the theatrical subtitles, but the story worked for me.    I didn't know how long Eli had been \\"alive,\\" but a synopses of the film at IMDB explains that she/he was 200 years old. I don't recall learning that fact during the movie itself. That, and a few other odd bits aside, Let The Right One In was very different and entertaining.    You can gather what the film is about by reading any detailed review, or plot synopsis, but what you won't learn is how unpredictable, bizarre, and dynamic is turns out to be. In fact, what made this more unpredictable for me is not knowing what it was about before I saw it. Somehow my brain ignored the word \\"vampire\\" on the cover, and I had a very different notion in my head about what I should expect. That worked in my benefit, because I learned what the film was about as it unfolded. When the subject matter of a film is not readily apparent the audience won't really know what to expect.    It was dynamic in the sense that the slower parts were well balanced with periods of intense action, horror and scares, but there wasn't a consistent rhythm. That is handy if you want to keep people guessing, and unprepared, but it can make those slower, dramatic parts seem too slow, or unwelcomed at the time.    The atmosphere was great. Creepy locations, and a wintertime setting worked well. Excellent framing and camera work help tell the story and keep the viewer interested. A few minor sub plots give us a little more to be interested in, and blend well with the main theme.    I would watch this one again. It's a great film with enough gore, blood and neck shredding for any horror fan, but enough art to makeit an intriguing art film.
B002SVBDYQ|5.0|I downloaded this CD as soon as it came out. I wouldn't even listen to the whole soundtrack because I was disappointed when it was nothing like the twilight sound track. There was no Paramore and no R-Patz (something I was excited to experience again).New Moon sat unplayed for over a month, until I went to see the movie. After New Moon FINALLY came out I fell in love with this soundtrack. After seeing the movie I understood why the songs were picked and how perfectly it went with the movie. I also felt kind of stupid because I'd read new moon a few times and knew the story was pretty depressing and slow, like the soundtrack is. This soundtrack is the perfect match for New Moon.. And actually this movie and sound track is way better than Twilight. It seems like the soundtrack and the movie have woken up from the dream like state that was Twilight and transitioned in to something that appears more real life to the fans. Not that vampires and 7ft tall wolfys are going to come knocking on your door, but the blue light effect is no long in use for this movie and that's a huge plus....

B002SJIO5E|2.0|SPOILERS : I don't walk out on movies but this one made it necessary for many. Camera footage was very shaky and made many leave the showing I attended due to motion sickness.. On a small TV it may be less intense.. as for the movie itself ( now I am not by any means a sci-fi buff...) I enjoy a good movie.. that's it.. this movie SUCKED.. storyline was simplistic but at the same time I expected some real action to unfold which never did.. the ending, which left me ready to set the screen ablaze, left you and the movie unanswered with the hollow feeling of maybe the next movie would be better... which apparently worked for many who thought it was good.. but for me... and that's all I care about and I believe many think as I do...This Movie= very little action, poor storyline! made you constantly feel something was getting started and you are left wanting when it never does! NEXT!    The viewer will ask these questions... how if the humans brought them down from the ship did they have and keep their weapons to trade with the cat food dealers..? ( which was a absolute joke )They were supposed to be timid... and that was the reason for them to not be worried about them using the weapons, yet many fought the police... why not with the very superior weapons they had.. no leader? not 1 to lead any to revolt ( which is what I waited for the hole time)... I could go on, but who cares.. movie had too many holes to be interesting. Add that to no real action and you get a real lame movie.
B002QEXN2K|3.0|Pardon the pun, but seriously John! WTF happened man? Did Jen take the wind out of your creative sails? Has the much increased media publicity of recent years left you with a musical writer's block?    Ladies and Gents, I consider myself a HUGE fan of JM, but this is a light, uncreative album compared to his first few. I was expecting a huge suprise after watching and listening to the artist metamorphasize his craft over the past few projects. This was a disappointment however.     There are a few tracks worth listening to such as 'Assassin', 'Edge of Desire' and 'Do You Know Me', but don't look further and expect to find the creative depth that is found in earlier pieces.    I gave it 3 out of 5 stars because it's ok compared to alot of other stuff out there, but listening to this is like sitting in a BMW with cloth interior, no AC and an AM/FM radio... you find yourself disapponted because you expected so much more!

B00000JMOF|4.0|I've seen so many clips from FRANKENSTEIN on television and in various film classes in college that I could never be 100% sure whether I'd actually ever seen the whole thing.  So I decided to make it one of my Halloween films this past October.  I'm pretty sure that I had never, in fact, seen the complete film, since I caught myself saying things like, \\"Oh, so that wasn't just a Mel Brooks gag! The assistant really DID steal 'Abby Normal's' brain!\\"  It seemed a little odd to be playing cinematic catch-up after all these years, but it speaks to the ubiquitousness of the 1931 classic in our popular culture that I even had to ask myself whether I'd ever seen FRANKENSTEIN in its entirety.    Growing up in the 60s, you almost certainly had to have seen at least aware of the cultural impact of FRANKENSTEIN. The monster movies of the 30s and 40s were already embedded in the culture.  You watched THE MUNSTERS or read horror spoofs in MAD magazine, you absorbed the references even indirectly.  And somewhere along the line you were going to catch a clip of Colin Clive yelling with demented glee, \\"It's alive! It's ALIVE.\\"  Or the scene where the monster, run fresh out of flowers to toss in the lake, throws in and inadvertantly (significantly) drowns the young girl who gave them to him in the first place.  On some level, seeing the film this late in life (in my 60s) seems almost redundant.    Then again, it isn't.  At no point in my viewing of the film was I truly scared, but at some point in life you develop enough of a critical sense that you can fully comprehend why audiences in 1932 might well have been.  They hadn't seen the spoofs: nor had they had their critical sensibilities bludgeoned by computer generated special effects.  The creepiness stemmed mainly from director James Whale's moody, Expressionistic sets and--of course--from Boris Karloff's wordless performance.  Yes, Karloff will, at moments, call to mind Phil Hartman's imitation on SNL for many a contemporary viewer, but whaddya gonna do? Boris Karloff may not be quite as intimidating these days, and like anything else in pop culture, he's eminently spoofable.  But he had undeniable screen presence here.  Countless comic take-offs, cinematic or TV remakes and nearly 70 years of further cinematic technical developments can't alter that basic fact.  He IS Frankenstein's monster.    How well did the film actually address what the narrator in the film's opening moments refers to as \\"the two great mysteries of creation: life and death?\\"  Well, that could be the source of endless debate.  By all accounts, Mary Shelley's novel really was about ideas.  The movie is really something of a muddle in that department.  Yes, the \\"scientist playing God\\" conceit is explored to some degree--as it would have to be--but as good as Colin Clive is in the role of Dr. Henry Frankenstein (cf. the novel's VICTOR Frankenstein), his character's vacillation from fairly mad (when you get down to it) scientist to callow young bridegroom is not really convincing.  His return to home, hearth and the love of a good woman is almost too abrupt and contrived.  That kind of obsession doesn't yield THAT easily to the entreaties of even the most loyal and saintly of women.  Except in the movies.    Then there's the matter of that criminal brain.  The most intriguing aspect of the monster, as conceived by James Whale and embodied by Karloff, is his NON-criminal mentality.  He is, simply put, a child in an adult monster's body.  Why give him the brain of an evil man, implying as it does that the havoc he will wreak is the result of same, when a monster THIS grotesque would likely have created just as much chaos with the brain of an altruist?  Was Whale just a \\"bleeding heart liberal\\" who felt that die-hard criminals were just \\"misunderstood\\"?  Pretty prescient, considering it anticipated a debate that's been raging in this country since the mid-60s.    Muddle notwithstanding though, this is great stuff.  Who careswhether it delves into life-and-death matters deeply enough?  There are plenty of very legit reasons why FRANKENSTEIN isconsidered a classic: the look of the film being but one of them.  I'm glad I  can finally lay claim to having seen it in its entirety.

B0000DC13U|5.0|The great thing about digital technology is that you can butcher, reassemble and reanimate other people's abominations. If I were to re-cut this pitiful, tedious, self satisfied rant on something political, I'd fashion it into a short but thrilling peek into the Stone's laboratory as they meticulously construct one of rock's all time hugest monsters. The footage of the band and guests in the studio is absolutely riveting. The rest is annoying, adolescent, French philosophizing on the problem with anything not French. Off with its head!!
0670034711|1.0|This book made me sick.  I thought I was buying a book about a woman who was learning to accept her changing body, repairing a horribly broken marriage and learning to experience and talk to God.  Instead what I got was just the opposite and what I'm trying not to be.  As I read it, I felt like it was an excuse for her guilt over leaving what was some average, nice guy.  Then what gets me really upset is that there's a new generation of young women picking this thing up.  Women who are engaged to be married, getting the message that when it's time to fly, it's time to fly.  That part where she gets forgiveness from the ex husband on the hill in India was especially disturbing.  All I could think of was that she was delusional from worrying about not eating to stay skinny.   Oh yeah and now she's writing her next excuse for her own guilt trips:  Committed!   Committed??  What about unlimited time, unlimited resources and unlimited $$$ and contacts that it would take to write a story like that??  And no responsibility to - anyone!!  No aging parents, no siblings or friends with problems, no nephews or nieces who she could help out with... (oh yeah, I think I read somewhere that she's come to the grand conclusion now that kids are generally just a bad idea - more role modelling!)  Who in God's earth was she and is she committed to other than herself?  I guess that's a start.   I gave her one star because I actually think she's a good writer and if she could write a book about - accepting her changing body, repairing a horribly broken marriage and learning how to talk to God, it would actually be a good one.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|I got these to replace the CMOS batteries in the library computers at my childrens elementary school. Some of the PC's there were starting to \\"forget\\" their settings and it was frustrating the librarian and school staff. They were thinking about throwing out their computers, but with times as tough as they are, the school district couldn't afford to replace them. As luck would have it they used these standard button batteries. Buying them at the corner pharmacy or electronics store was ridiculously expensive though. I was happy to find these through Amazon. I was able to buy 25 new batteries for about the same price as just 4 batteries at our local electronics shop!
9113020730|5.0|The final book in the Millennium Trilogy is a searing novel of payback and revenge that features all of the characters that have made Stieg Larsson's series one of the best sagas in recent memory.  The underscoring dilemma with reading and enjoying these engaging novels is knowing that the author died before ever realizing the international success these novels have had (including a film version of the first novel - THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO).<br /><br />The unlikely heroine of this series, Lisbeth Sander, is an underground hacker legend who has been physically and mentally abused her entire life --- leading to the finale of the prior novel (THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE) where she was shot in the head by her own father and buried alive.  How she lived through that trauma speaks to the resilience she possesses that has allowed her to overcome all enemies and obstacles in her path.  Unfortunately, the years of abuse and mishandling at the hands of evil members of the Swedish government and state has left her paranoid and untrusting.  In essence, her relationship-building skills have been permanently hampered --- especially with men.<br /><br />Lisbeth's primary defender is the other star of this series --- magazine editor/publisher Mikael Blomkvist.  He has also had a somewhat rocky relationship with Sander --- but they cannot deny the fact that they are on the same team and work well together.  Blomkvist's magazine, Millennium, has been covering Salander's saga since evidence of her abuse first become public knowledge and they continue to be her staunch advocate as she now faces trial for assault and insanity charges.  Blomkvist is another complex character who, similar to Salander, has relationship issues.  He may have finally found his compatibility match in a police investigator who is part of the team Blomkvist has reluctantly joined in an effort to bring down the corrupt Swedish government faction that is behind the Lisbeth Salander case (among other indiscretions).<br /><br />The novel works best and is most satisfying when past misdeeds are corrected and revenge for the featured characters is had.  THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNETS NEST thrives on that --- yet still presents enough intrigue and drama to keep the pages turning at an eager pace as obstacles continue to present themselves for the protagonists.  A side, yet parallel, plot-line involving Erika Berger (Blomkvist's frequent lover and partner at Millennium) finds her leaving Millennium to take up the editor role at a rival publication.  Berger quickly finds herself not only at odds with co-workers at her new office but also the apparent target of a malicious sexual harassment campaign that gets physical.  How Larsson deftly connects this plot-line with the others is sheer brilliance and Berger's story alone would have made for an interesting novel.<br /><br />Since this was the final story in the trilogy, all is neatly wrapped up by the last page and the reader will truly feel sorry to leave these terrific characters behind.  What remains to be discussed, however, is if Stieg Larsson's untimely death at the age of 50 had any foul-play behind it.  Larsson's personal life rivaled that of his fictional male lead, Mikael Blomkvist, in that he was the editor of the anti-racist magazine Expo and during his time there exposed neo-fascist organizations within Sweden.  He lived amidst constant death threats and readers will be left to ponder if there was any factual premise behind many of the things the Millennium Trilogy revealed and, if so, could that have caused him to pay the ultimate price for publishing success?  In any event, these novels deserve to be talked about and Larsson's global fame as a result of them is well-deserved.he novel works best and is most satisfying when past misdeeds are corrected and revenge for the featured characters is had.

B002T921AC|1.0|First Off I don't support the exploitation of minors after seeing his lame pathetic video while I flicked threw the channels.  Second the music this child has wrote for him is pure manufactured, talentless pathetic garbage and watching this child dance and sing for more than 35 seconds can cause eye bleeding for those that listen to real music. It's that poor.  Lets just hope this loser, his song writers, every album with his name on it on the planet, the lame people who actually buy this trash and support the exploitation of minors all jump on a big rocket together so we can blast it into space and forget this joke ever happened.  Truly pathetic beyond words, makes me want to vomit at the site of this parasite and the talent deaf people who like this tripe....well I guess him being like 11 or 12 has a fan base made up of 7-10 year old girls who don't know what real music is so this loser will be forgotten soon even if the rocket dream doesn't happen.  This is an insult to the human race for god's sake.
B002AGIEYG|4.0|The orchestral playing by the magnificent Berlin Philharmonic is fabulous - always perfect sound without excess.  Rattle's interpretations of these \\"war horses\\" is a bit idiosynchratic.  Some tempi are quite slow, and the winds seem overemphasized to me.  These are recordings from live performances in the Philharmonie in 2008.  My favorite is the Symphony # 4.

0385504225|3.0|I have read most of Dan Brown's fiction.  I patiently waited in a library queue of over 500 to read this book.<br /><br />After reading 10 chapters, I wondered if it was just me or others felt it wasn't as good as the others.  At that point I checked the Amazon reviews, something I rarely do until I finish a book.  It wasn't just me.  It truly is a 3, disappointing.  Poor writing, too much, and too pompous.  For example, this line in chapter 2, \\"The towering young man moved down the corridor past priceless Italian antiques - a Piranesi etching, a Savonarola chair, a silver Bugarini oil lamp.\\" The whole book has lots of extra words and big words.  The majority of the time, I could guess what was going to happen to the main characters.  There are lots of larger than life themes that get tangled up and are somewhat straighten out in the end but not all.  I also had a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu  around this book and National Treasure.  At times, I imagined it Nicholas Cage running around DC solving these mysteries.<br /><br />I did finish the book, because of the fascinating tidbits of information and puzzles and to see how it would be tied together at the end.
0810982862|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo23KR3LLMTLQGR]](I've updated this review a bit after watching the movie.)<br /><br />If you're blown away by the visual quality of the Pandora, as shown in the trailers, you'll be glad to see that majority of the art in this book are on the environments. There are also designs for the plants, animals, vehicles and the Pandora inhabitants, the Na'vi. Weta Workshop is also roped in to provide some models and help in designing the Na'vi. The creativity behind the design and the scale of work is of course amazing.<br /><br />The downside is there are only 108 pages, which is underwhelming considering that every set and prop in the movie is made totally from imagination. They certainly could have packed more pages but the price is also lower for that matter.<br /><br />This book didn't include as much preliminary designs as I hoped, like the iterations they had to do to get to the final designs. The only area where there are iterations are the character designs for the Na'vi. The rest, like the flora, fauna, vehicles and sets look pretty close to the finalized designs.<br /><br />Most of the art in this book look computer generated (not that it's a bad thing) and there are very few pencil sketches. Quite a few pieces created with mixed medium are a bit jarring to me, like mixing photos with digital painting for backgrounds. Again, nothing wrong with mixing medium but some of the styles just clash and calls for attention in the wrong way.<br /><br />The writeup talks mainly about the design concepts and very little on the production. Stereocopy, which James Cameron is an advocate of, is used, but it's only briefly mentioned.<br /><br />I'm intrigued that James Cameron actually wrote the script in 1995. But he had to wait until 2006 before technology was (deemed) advanced enough (for him) to make the film. I thought technology was already available when Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within was released in 2001. So what technology are we really talking about here? It's not mentioned but, well, this isn't a making-of book. I'll definitely be getting the disc when it comes out.<br /><br />Overall, this book looks like a rush job. Page 82-83 has an image of the flying Ikrans printed upside down. I can't imagine how it's possible to place a picture on a page (on the software) without looking at the picture. There are very slight pixelation with the really big pictures, something I don't normally see with other movie books.<br /><br />It's a nice book but more for Avatar fans. But be prepared to be underwhelmed, especially after you've watched the movie.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5 stars<br /><br />(More pictures are available on my blog.

B001QOGYB8|5.0|\\"The Fantastic Mr. Fox\\" is an entertaining, visually pleasing tale based on the classic book by Roald Dahl. In the film, Mr. Fox (voiced by George Clooney) is a former bird thief who goes against the wishes of his wife (voiced by Meryl Streep) and returns to his criminal life. Unfortunately, Mr. Fox takes things a bit too far, and his shenanigans cause three local farmers to wage war on the entire Fox family, which also implicates all the other critters in the area.<br /><br />Children and adults will enjoy this film, which is beautiful to watch. The movie has great characters and clever dialogue, and it is so much better than most of the animated films being produced today. I highly recommend this movie for the whole family.
B000NA28I4|3.0|And that's pretty much what \\"Eragon\\" is.  I didn't find the movie all that terrible despite what a number of people said here, but it's as bare-bones \\"Star Wars\\" as you can possibly get. Eragon is Luke Skywalker, Eragon's ill-fated uncle is Luke's ill-fated uncle, Brom is Obi-Wan Kenobi, evil King Galabtorix is evil Emperor Palpatine, the king's dark-magic sorcerer Murza is Darth Vader, the Dragonkiller sword is the lightsaber, the Varden are the Rebel Alliance, and the Arya character is for all intents and purposes Princess Leia Organa without the cinnamon-danish hairdo (though the feather in her hair at the end of the movie earned a \\"Mennehaha\\" quip from a reviwer on this site). The costuming and special effects are great and so is the computer-generated dragon Saphira, but the acting suffers terribly in this film, as acting often does when when visual effects dominate a movie.  And when the cast knows - I sensed the \\"Eragon\\" cast did - that they were in a dud.
B000UJ48UO|5.0|In the late 60's during the Vietnam war, it all starts off with the training of some unfortunate newbie soldiers are having trouble like Private Joker (Matthew Modine), Private Cowboy (Arliss Howard), Private Pyle (Vincient D'Onofrio), and others are being trained by hard mouthed drill Sergent Hartman (R. Lee Ermy). But Pyle keeps making mistakes and getting almost everyone in trouble as he later goes in the brink of his mind. After weeks of training, Joker with others like Eightball (Dorian Harewood, Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin) and others head to Vietnam to face the horrors of a living nightmare in the viet cong.<br /><br />Harrowing, sometimes funny and violent Vietnam masterpiece from Stanley Kubrick is one of his best movies. It tells about the dangers of war and who is the true killer weither it's the marine or the enemy as the movie is a pure work of art from true cinematic genius himself Kubrick. It has dark humor thanks to the foul-mouthed drill sergent to some chilling moments like the soap-and-towel punishment of Private Pyle and of course an outstanding music score that is mellowed with a nice 60's soundtrack. The ending is just unbelivably surreal yet breathtaking and the performances are just nothing sort of outstanding, it's definitely a must see motion picture experience.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray gives this classic the best picture and perfect sound quality you can see even in it's awesome widescreen format with some good extras like trailer, audio commentary and a featurette.
B000066C1N|5.0|My children love this soundtrack...the only problem is that when they hear it, they can't help but to look around for the image of the movie...they've listened to it so many times that they sing along --even the 2-year old!
0316044938|5.0|Lovely Bones is narrated by recently deceased adolescent Susie Salmon (like the fish), as she watches her family and friends deal with their loss.<br /><br />From the afterlife Susie is able not only to see into other's thoughts and feelings but also examine their histories. Thus we come to the first of the authors achievements; successfully writing in the first person omnipotent point of view. The fact that Alice Sebold managed to craft a bestseller from an unorthodox P.O.V is one of the novel's strengths.<br /><br />Sebold also stunned me with her ability to create people not characters. The Lovely Bones is populated by what seems like genuine individuals not creations of some author. The novel is devoid of clich&eacute; and contrivance, the characters don't fit together nicely, their relationships are not straightforward, in short the novel is about people.<br /><br />The Lovely Bones is probably more suited towards literary readers; it is not filled with drama and overt conflict. The book is about the aftermath of the narrators death, nothing else.<br />You won't find massive climaxes or dramatic showdowns but you will find a satisfying and intelliegent novel.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|Sony generally manufactures quality electronic products & this one won't disappoint. This is a brand I generally veer towards when considering electronics. The dual use is fantastic & I purchased it for both uses. You can easily connect it to your home stereo system with the attached RCA cables. The one disappointment was how short these connector cables were & they are already permanently attached to the turntable. Other than that, you connect & go - sound is fantastic. The arm automatically returns to the holder & the turntable stops when the album side is finished playing. The other use, of course, is the ability to record & download your vinyl into your computer and then burn it onto CD's or into your MP3 player. The enclosed software has lots of bells & whistles which I haven't quite figured out yet. For a novice like myself, you can choose to have the software automatically remove the hisses & pops found on vinyl & even out the audio before burning onto a CD. For the more experienced, there are literally hundreds of effects that you can incorporate into the recording - i.e., reverb, fading, phlange, etc. You have the option of saving the recording as a wave or MP3 file. Considering the price & ease of use, this product is a winner on both counts. The sleek design and look of the turntable is also nice - compared to some of the other turntables I looked at before deciding on this model. The others looked like big silver flying saucers. I strongly recommend this turntable overall.
B000VDDWE2|2.0|I am not reviewing the movie, just the quality of the disc. I was hoping to watch some of my favorite action movies in Blu-Ray on my new computer, and add to my small collection. I watched two vids for a short time, sensing something was not right. I then watched \\"Pirates...\\", and \\"Dark Knight\\", purchased at full price from Best Buy some time ago. Big difference!!! Amazon is selling regular or dupped \\"Blu-Rays\\". A fraud. They are no where near the picture quality from Blu-rays purchased elsewhere.  Those that I have purchased that have not arrived yet, will be returned. I am totally disappointed in Amazon now, and they have lost my respect as an honest retailer.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|I think that once they freed themselves from having to fully follow the Star Trek canon they were able to make a much better movie than anybody else has been able to do in the Star Trek universe.  Everybody walks into a movie like this with some type of historical fictional baggage and as a result very few will be happy with a new interpretation.  I thought they did a great job both artistically and story wise.  This is proably the movie I enjoyed the most this year.  Was it perfect? No.  Was it much better than I expected it to be?  Absolutely.  I grew up watching the reruns on late night.  My sons hadn't seen them for the most part but also enjoyed the movie tremendousily on it's own merits. I don't see how you can expect more than that.
B00006ADD5|5.0|When I first saw David Lean's \\"Desert Epic Masterpiece,\\" I HATED the film, for reasons even I can't explain to myself now. I just saw this 3 hour, 46 minute movie again today, and...I LOVE it. The only way to see this movie (if not in theaters) is on the small screen...in WIDESCREEN, the way David Lean originally intended the film to be seen. And with panoramic views of the desert, Maurice Jarre's stirring score (notable for its being romantic, and yet there's no romance in the movie) and an all-star cast (including Alec Guinness, Jose Ferrer & Claude Raines), there is plenty to see and hear. Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention Peter O'Toole's bravura performance as T.E. Lawrence, in the role that made him a household name. O'Toole is simply handsome and completely reckless as Lawrence, as daring as the man himself, I dare say. He radiates charisma, fire and passion in every scene. Jose Ferrer is equally venomous in his cameo as Turkish Bey (he's the one who played Cyrano De Bergerac on film in 1954, and won an Academy Award for it). Omar Sharif (who would go on to greater fame as Doctor Zhivago several years later) is simply outstanding as Sherif Ali. Anthony Quayle is a firebrand as Auda Abu Tayli (please excuse me if I mis-spelled his character's name). Jack Hawkins is appropriately haughty as General Allenby (I'll always remember him as Quintus Arrius in William Wyler's epic \\"Ben-Hur\\"), Claude Raines is practical as Dryden, George Kennedy is loyal to the last as Colonel Harry Brighton and the rest of the cast and crew (especially costume designer Phyllis Dalton) did a remarkable and fantastic job on this movie. I highly recommend it. Rated PG.
B002BSHWUU|4.0|The packaging is very nice. The CDs all have extra info and photos in the booklets and the case is sturdy. However, unlike the mono set, the stereo set does not come with plastic anti static inner sleeves. I had to buy a pack of 20 from Dusty Groove; they are made in Japan and cost about 8 bucks with shipping. To avoid touching the discs with your fingers, just push in on the sides of the jacket and shake the disc out onto a clean, preferably soft surface. Then you can put on the plastic inner sleeves. It's a snug fit, the plastic ripples a little at the top after you put it in the jacket, but it is well worth the extra expense and time.

B002PAQETY|5.0|It is a shame Stereophonics are not well known here in the US or that they have not made a larger organized effort to promote themselves here.  It will probably be a year before Keep Calm and Carry on is released in the US officially, but thank god for imports.    One of the best things about this band is they do not rest on their past and try to recreate themselves every few years.  This release is no different.  Their last 2 releases have been all out rockers.  While both good CD's, the last thing I wanted was a 3rd repeat of that.    KC&CO is definitely a new sound.  It relys a lot less on guitars and more on the drums, bass and background vocals to fill in the sound.  Some of the songs have a bit of a motown sound (Innocent for example), some are a bit more electronic (Beer bottle, Wonder), and there is tons of slow tempo \\"soul\\" as well (Show Me, Could you be the one).    If you are in the US and like the Stereophonics, don't let the import prices stop you from getting this.  It is well worth it and one of their best releases.  I cannot wait for them to make it to the US to tour for this and I hope the setlist is widely made up of these songs. It'll probably be late 2010 before they make it here, so it'll be along wait.    If you read this far and have no idea who the Stereophonics are, I recommend you pick up a few of their CD's.  My fav's are \\"Language, Sex, Violence, Other\\" and \\"You Gotta Go There to Come Back\\".  \\"Word Gets Around\\" is a fan favorite in the UK.  That is their debut album and the lyrics very much have a hometown story telling feel to them centered around a small mining town in Wales named Cwmaman (I hope I spelled that right!).  All the releases are good, but I would avod \\"Pull the Pin\\" and \\"Just Enough Education to Perform\\" as your first exposure to the band.  They are solid releases, but not as focused as the other ones.
B00005K3O4|5.0|'Killer Klowns from Outer Space' is the very first B-Horror I fell in love with before I even knew what B-Horror meant.  I remember asking my parents for this for Christmas, forget what age, but I was very surprised they got it for me because I had it in my mind that this was such a rare flick haha.  Anyway, it was a good Christmas.  What's not to love about clowns from space coming down to earth and eating people!?  I'm definitely one of those that wish the Chiodo brothers would make more flicks, preferably this genre, than I'd be in heaven haha.  You can always tell if a Chiodo brother is involved with either film or commercial, simply because of their artistic style.  The designs and ideas these guys come up with for monsters/creatures always amazes me!  The Chiodo brothers are masters when it comes to making anything goofy/silly, such as clowns and 'Crites' from 'Critters' series, and turning it in to something wicked and creepy looking!  I here rumors on some movie websites that there is possibly a remake or a sequel to this flick.  So if your into Horror flicks like: 'Critters', 'Leprechaun', 'Ghoulies', and others that add silliness into the mix, than there is no reason not to enjoy this.  Those Klowns still manage to creep me out to this day haha.
B000000OTY|5.0|i don't know if there are enough words in the english language to adequately describe my love for this CD. take a journey to africa, england, and inside the mind and dreams of one of our century's most intriguing musicians and songwriters. gabriel's strengths as a collaborative artist really shine here, too: you can hear paula cole's heavenly soprano soaring in the background of many songs, as well as manu kacthe's propulsive rhythms and shankar's lilting violin.<br /><br />one review described this cd set as not so much a collection of songs but a journey towards \\"spiritual healing\\". all i can say is AMEN.<br /><br />btw, the sound quality is INCREDIBLE.  you really feel like you are right there, in the front row--dancing and singing an chanting along! ENJOY THIS MASTERPIECE OF LOVE, EMOTIONAL EXPLORATION, EXPRESSION, AND JOY! you can't go wrong with this :)
0765348276|3.0|Wow.  I'm all over the board with my feelings on this book.  First off, I give it an \\"A\\", a \\"C\\", and a \\"B\\".  How's that, you ask?  The first 100 pages were some of the best writing around.  You really get to know the characters.  And being 44, I can somewhat relate to the aging process.  Although, most of these characters reminded me more of my uncles...real believable, grumpy, funny guys -- the kind I'd like to hang with.  Grumpy Old Men meets the Odd Couple?  Top that off with the decent world building.  It was different how the extremely futuristic sci-fi stuff broke off from planet earth...planet earth being almost as we know it today.      The 1st 100 pages is all about getting there.  The storyline is \\"joining the army\\".  So, this section is all about the anticipation of the \\"science\\".  The author just gives you little hints and theories about what you are about to experience.  The best part is toward the end of the fist 100 pages when the science gets introduced.  I don't want to give it away, but it is good, trust me.  Whatever your preference, you'll love the first 100 pages.    If you like drill sargeants, you'll like the second 100 pages too.  Personally, I hated it.  I just don't like boot camp scenes.  Juvenile in my opinion.      Finally the last 100 pages.  \\"B\\".  There is some cool science, but not enough.  This section is mostly combat.  And, I don't even think the combat sequences are \\"told\\" very well.      I liked this book, but I was glad to be done with it.  The good news is that there are only 300 pages, and the pages each read very fast.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|Stephen Daldry knows how to tell a story, knows how important it is to make each of those characters relevant and indispensable, more importantly, emotions are finely portrayed, but it is the cerebral quality of his work that both impresses and irritates the audience. Somehow, he let go of his control and made \\"Billy Elliot\\" exuberant and glorious, with each note and emotion spilling out of the screen. His restraint might have lessened the impact of the dark nature of the tragedy in \\"The Hours\\"; somehow the balance continues in \\"The Reader\\", a powerful testament to the complexity of humans and their interactions. In \\"The Reader\\" learning occurs, consequences, origins, and motivations are carefully explored and analyzed, leaving out some of the mystery for us to decide. Choice is key here, and some choices are carry a bigger weight than others.    The marvelous Kate Winslett, who should be honoured for the quality of her work, with as much recognition as it is humanly possible portrays the central character of the story, a woman whose life might have been shaped by unfortunate events, mostly undisclosed to us, and some of her own genetic makeup. We, as the lawyers and the students in the film, get to evaluate the evidence and choose to make a statement to justify hers and our own ethical standpoints. It is the intricate and deft interpretation of Hannah that anchors the story. Although, the story follows Michael and their relationship from his teenage years to the devastating conclusion, the film succeeds because Winslett is able to show every bit of the confusion, rationale, and emotion that her character possesses. She seems cold and detached, but as we look, we discover that there is more to her than we can see from the moments we see her on the screen. Hannah carries secrets inside her soul, somehow keeping herself alive, surviving, living an austere existence that hypnotizes, seduces, and repulses those she encounters.    Michael is seduced by this mysterious woman, and his own future is shaped by those moments they spend together. What he doesn't realize is how big of an effect their time together will have on his life. Their early scenes are powerful and presented with a strong sense of realism and brevity. They're probable the best of the film and might have to be reviewed to understand how key they are to the further growth of Michael's life and reactions to others. Winslett does not say much, but her manipulations provoke her desired effects.    As their paths diverge and meet, their relationship changes as one observes the dramatic turn of events that brings them together again, and how Michael's actions have dire consequences for both of them. It is during this period that we think we begin to see how relative everything: what is moral and immoral, logic and emotional, simple and complex. Highs and lows are hit again, as we become more involved in one of the most powerful and dramatic moments of their lives.    In the final act of the film is when Winslett and Feines do some of their most outstanding work ever; she even surpassing her masterful turns in \\"Revolutionary Road\\", and \\"Eternal Sunshine\\". Every gesture, every look, every enunciation add details and shed light to who they were, are and might become. It is subtle work, haunting, and bewitching, the work very few people are able to do.    \\"The Reader\\" reaches its amazing conclusion with a couple of scenes that might break whatever little strength we might still have left. \\"The Reader\\" isn't an important work, but it is a work that should be recognized by the quality of its work, a finely tuned and produced piece of cinema by people who recognize how magical, powerful, and intelligent films can be.
0307346617|5.0|A good zombie book.  Some of the short stories left me wanting for more.  Really made me think how I should prepare for the pending zombie war or some natural disaster.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|Like other reviewers have mentioned, I was disappointed by the censored words on The Fame Monster.  However, that doesn't take away how much I LOVE this album!  I bought Lady Gaga's first album, The Fame, several months ago and I enjoyed it but I was more of a casual fan then.  It wasn't until \\"Bad Romance\\" and its amazing music video came out that I became a devoted Gaga fan.  I haven't been this excited over a new artist in years.  The Fame Monster is pure pop perfection.  I truly love every song on this album.  Normally I would complain if an album had only 8 songs, but in this case, it's about quality over quantity.  I'm in love with \\"Monster\\" and I hope it's a single.  It seems that some people don't like \\"Teeth\\" but I love its raw sound.  It's like a hypnotic chant.  \\"Alejandro\\" is a fun, Spanish-flavored up-tempo and the amusing beginning reminds me of soap opera dialogue.  \\"Speechless\\" is Gaga showing her serious side and she really pours her emotions into this song about her father.  It shows that not only is she an entertaining performer to watch, but she has a wonderful voice too.  \\"So Happy I Could Die\\" talks about just having fun in a club and enjoying life.  \\"Telephone\\" is fun and catchy and I think it's the most commercial song on the album.  I heard that it's going to be a single and I'm sure it'll be another top 5--maybe even #1--hit for Gaga.  I highly recommend this album and if you don't have Gaga's first album, The Fame, then buy the deluxe version of The Fame Monster so you can hear for yourself how Gaga has become one of the biggest names in pop music today.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|it may be the fifth or so time I've owned this, think I may have had it on cassette originally, and I believe my college roommate may have had the LP, and this was in the 80s .  . .but there is nothing I can say about this that hasn't been said, other than it rocks from beginning to end, and for me tells many stories and feels like a conversation with a friend, and what could finish better than \\"and in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make\\" ?  this will never fail to be true, and then there is the crystalline, pure Harrison in Here Comes the Sun , and it is alright . . .for the duration of the CD, everything is alright. Love it, have loved it for so long, and will always love it.
B001FB55Y4|4.0|lol... but really enjoyed this film.  Guy Ritchie is the toned down British version of Quentin Tarantino (hopefully that gives you an idea of his style -- not quite as edgy, though).  His movies are full of quirky characters, great dialog and really good actors.  Like \\"Snatch\\" this movie was unique and odd.  Great movie to buy or rent.
B002RD4UZ4|5.0|if the stars were mine . . .WOW . . .dazzling lyrics, dazzling, and the entire cd has such a soothing feel. just when you think you've heard every version of Over the Rainbow imaginable, here comes Melody Gardot, and a lovely version it is. I can imagine dancing to these tunes, very slowly, in a dimly lit ballroom, with cigarette girls mingling among the tables, which are empty, because everyone in the place is up, dancing slowly, in the dim light. Evocative and just simply lovely. It's not my one and only thrill, but it definitely thrills me. I look forward to hearing so, so much more from Melody Gardot. Fabulous.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|A group of Jewish American soldiers in WWII has had enough, and is going deep behind enemy lines.  Lt. Aldo Raine wants 100 Nazi scalps from each man in his unit, and he means that literally.  But the Basterds will have to go against Colonel Hanz Landa of the SS, an insidious wrung-climber who will stop at nothing to get whatever it is that he wants. Who will win?<br /><br />The winner, of course, is Tarantino, who has reinvented history with INGLORIOUS BASTERDS, a truly glorious film that defies categorization.  It doesn't even, at times, feel like a Tarantino film; that opening scene between Landa and the dairy farmer is so full of tension, you'll have soaked your clothes in sweat within the first ten minutes.  And the whole film is somewhat sluggishly paced, which actually serves Tarantino's plot well; while we never really get close to the Basterds (for good reason; these aren't your lovable flag-waving soldiers, these guys are almost as sadistic as the Nazis they're pursuing), we spend plenty of time with Landa, as well as Shossana Dryfus, who escapes Landa as a child, only to re-encounter him years later.  The point is, we get close to some of these people--we learn to chear for Shossana, and learn to loathe Landa with every inch of our being.<br /><br />You'll watch this movie for one of three reasons, I'm sure:<br />1) You're a Tarantino fan, and so will watch whatever he puts out, even if it's a documentary of his bowel movements.  I won't judge; I probably would too.<br />2) You like war movies.  Well, you may not get what you want here--this is revisionist cinema at its finest, and this ain't your granddaddy's war movie.  It's loud and gory and with so much moral ambiguity, you'll actually consider rooting for the bad guys.<br />3) You've heard about the fine performances.  Eli Roth is slightly miscast, though he has so much fun in his role, it's forgivable.  Michael Fassbender is so smooth and cool, you'll wish there was more of him.  Michael Meyers is Michael Meyers (really, Quentin?  Not your worst casting choice ever, but it's up there.)  Brad Pitt is hamming it up hardcore and loving every single second of it. Melanie Laurent and Diane Kruger as the femme fatales are a blast to watch.  But the real gold here, as I'm sure you've heard, is Cristoph Waltz, who brings the movie villain to a whole new role.  Every single actor who plays a Nazi from here on out will study Waltz's flawless performance, and wish they were half as good.  Hanz Landa is the definition of \\"smooth criminal\\"--a dastardly, multi-lingual genius who has a knack for sniffing out Jews (hence his name, The Jew Hunter), though we're never really sure what his motives are.  Waltz--fluent in German, French, and English, and with a decent grasp of Italian pronunciation--plays his role to the hilt through four languages, and steals every single scene he's in.  If you don't want to watch this movie for any other reason, watch it for him.<br /><br />INGLORIOUS BASTERDS is easily one of Tarantino's best; for me, it ranks only behind RESEVOIR DOGS (though if somebody wants to argue for PULP FICTION, I'll understand).  This film is relentless, and is sure to piss off some people with its rather unflattering portrayal of the American WWII soldier, not to mention the guts Tarantino displays near the end.  Throughout, it is one violent, bloody ride, with laughter and terror and everything between.  It is a beautiful film, it is a brutal film, and it should not be missed.entin?

0316776963|4.0|I listened to David Sedaris' When You are Engulfed in Flames as an audio-book (read by the author) and enjoyed it so much that I special-ordered Me Talk Pretty One Day into my library as an audio-book.  Reading is good, but when it comes to material like this, audio is the way to go.<br /><br />Sedaris' deadpan delivery is priceless. Seven of the stories in this collection are recorded live. These stories are among the best in the collection, and they are enhanced further by the live audience (those pregnant pauses, the anticipation, and the delirious laughter that follows each punch-line).<br /><br />Sedaris' stories (or essays, as they are often referred to) are amusing, real-life, anecdotes about the mundane. These are the stories told by the funniest guy at a dinner party.<br /><br />As with any collection of essays, some are better than others.  This collection gets off to a strong start with Go Carolina.  Many of the standout stories are the ones that were recorded live, in particular The Youth in Asia, I'll Eat What He's Wearing, and See You Again Yesterday.  Other stand-outs include: Shiner Like a Diamond and Learning Curve.<br /><br />In Canada we have a popular story-teller named Stuart McLean who is probably unknown outside the Great White North (we also like hockey and drink coffee at a place called Tim Horton's). David Sedaris is similar to McLean in that he tells amusing anecdotes'; however there is a distinct difference. McLean is strictly G rated entertainment; sentimental and charming. Sedaris, while not R rated, is delivering PG material. Readers and listeners should be prepared for coarse language, sexual content, and references to recreational drug use.  He speaks openly about his drug abuse and his homosexuality, which may be off-putting to some. And his humor is extremely caustic - and that may not appeal to everyone. (I on the otherhand, appreciate caustic humor)<br /><br />All in all, this is a highly entertaining collection of stories. Overall, I found the variety and quality of stories told in When You Are Engulfed in Flames to be a little better, but Me Talk Pretty One Day makes for enjoyable reading and/or listening.  There are moments that are almost certain to have you laughing out loud.of stories told in When You Are Engulfed in Flames to be a little better, but Me Talk Pretty One Day makes for enjoyable reading and/or listening.

B0010X745K|4.0|Sartre, perhaps, said it best: \\"hell is other people,\\" i.e. we do a good enough job making life difficult for each other here on Earth, so who needs demons?<br /><br />Following a violent storm that wrecks his studio, illustrator David Drayton takes his son Billy into town for supplies.  Once there, however, an unnatural mist traps them in the supermarket.  The situation goes from inconvenient to horrific when they discover there are monsters in the mist; but mistrust and paranoia lead quickly to a situation inside that is more unsettling than the unknown horrors around them.<br /><br />I just saw this for a second time, and was once again impressed by how effective it was in its dark simplicity and how much it resembled the old school 50's and 60's horror thrillers like [[ASIN:B00009NHC0 The Thing from Another World]] and [[ASIN:B00000K3TO Night of the Living Dead]].  It puts the focus on the human drama, and the way that fear and mistrust can make human beings worse than any monster.  Marcia Gay Harden's apocalyptic power grab was truly frightening, and it's rare that commercial Hollywood filmmakers have the guts to deliver on a premise as scary as this one, and carry it through to the finish.  Compare the ending of this film, which is smaller scale but to my mind more effective and in its own way sublime, to the ending of Steven Spielberg's [[ASIN:B00005JNTI War of the Worlds]], or to the ending of any other conventional Hollywood horror film and it will be clear how unique Darabont's approach was here, that managed to ramp up even on the darkness of Stephen King's original vision.  I'll take this kind of inventive and thoughtful horror anyday over torture porn like [[ASIN:B0006SSOHC Saw]] and [[ASIN:B000UNYK3A Hostel]].
0743454537|5.0|I loved this book. It usually takes me a couple of weeks to get through a book but I couldn't put this down, I must have finished it in 3 days. At times, my eyes watered up with tears because I thought of my own daughters but it wasn't so sad that I put the book down, even for a second to grab a tissue. 2 thumbs up!! I'll definitely be reading Jodi Picoult's other books after reading this one.
0307454541|3.0|Overall, while not entranced, I enjoyed this book but only after reading 100 pages. The plot is interesting, and the characters, particularly Lisbeth Salamander, appealing. Great descriptions of a shivering bleak, northern Sweden in winter. However, the writing, either the Swedish style or the translation, is often plodding and crammed with unnecessary details. A sentence or even a phrase could have eliminated entire paragraphs or segments, which made for slow, ponderous reading until the second half heated up. I want to read this author's next book but am hesitant to buy it because it took me so long to get into this one.

B00000IQV7|5.0|Robin Williams is the Evelyn Woods of free flowing comedy, yet he does his best work in more serious, dramatic roles.  In Patch Adams, he gets to stretch both muscles.  He proves that he is gifted in both genres and excels by using both in this film.  Patch Adams is a touching movie with just the right amount of laughter and tears; tears from crying and tears from laughter.  One of my all time favorite movies.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I have loved Star Trek since I was a little girl. I have loved all the different t.v. versions and all the movies. I really looked forward to this new movie because of the time frame (beginning of Enterprise). I felt the actor's portrayals of their characters was superb! My favorites were Kirk and Spock...but the rest were so great too. I felt the producers threw the perfect amount of humor in at just the right times to relieve the suspense. Fabulous...I want to own it!!!!!

B002H3EUAE|4.0|As everyone knows at this point, this film is a fine Christmas classic that deserves to be in any collection and viewed every year during the Holidays with the family. The Blu Ray upgrade in picture quality is worth it.    But, skip the Ultimate Collector's Edition and just stick with the single disk purchase. The extra items such as the coasters, the fake snow, the santa hat and the moose cup are all low quality crap. The Marty Moose mug, which could have been THE item to have in this set is so small you could barely stick your pinky finger in the opening. the tin package for the set is nice but only takes up space on the shelf unless you can find another holiday use for it.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This is one of the best shows on tv to date. This dvd is well worth every penny. The show doesn't disappoint and it's gore level is not too graphic. It's scary in it's concept like the twilight zone used to be. Having the characters travel from town to town gives you fresh outlook on the concept for every new episode. I really enjoy everything about this show and would recommend it to every one who enjoys being scared, likes to laugh, and are fans of good acting. The main characters are so believeable as brothers and the soundtrack is excellent. Everyone should watch this show starting with this dvd set so they can continue to follow the lives of the Winchester Brothers in their quest to stop evil before it stops them.
0740785508|5.0|When I first opened up \\"Imaginative Realism,\\" the first impression that I formed was that the book reminded me of some of the older texts from the 1970's.  There was something about the style of the text and the page layout that made me think of an older text from a used bookstore; I almost felt like I was walking through a hobby store.  Though it may sound it, this is not a bad thing - in an age of Photoshop and 3D rendering programs, James Gurney's approach reminds the reader of the traditional approach to illustration.<br /><br />That being said, this is no novice guide. There is no \\"the body is made up of shapes\\" step-by-step guide, this is no \\"How to draw\\" book for beginners.  James Gurney assumes that the reader has a moderate to high level of skill in most of the areas he addresses.  What he does explain are the ideas behind how the real world can provide insight into the fantasy realm.  Maquettes, models, architecture, and even workable fixative - this is a great all around book for hobbyists as well as professionals.
B000TGJ8CQ|4.0|This is another of Nicolas Cage's movies where I couldn't think of anybody else better for the part. This is my kind of movie,where I have to use my brain and THINK while watching. As with \\"Snake Eyes\\" there were several times when it was great to be watching a DVD,as I could stop and re-watch a scene. The only problem with this movie was that when it ended I was ready to watch it for another hour or more,having been drawn into the action and events happening on screen. This happened before for me when I saw \\"Groundhog Day\\",where, however, the ending was a conclusion that left little to the imagination. \\"Next\\" is well worth getting involved in .

B000SZH8LQ|4.0|I bought this album some time ago after hearing her on I believe VH1 Soul and she had this delectably soft voice that just mezmerized me when I heard \\"Like A Star\\". The album it self is nothing like most of today's R&B and really reminds you more of a jazz album. I was hoping she would really take off but she still did reasonably well. I know a re-released version of the album exist but most of the extra tracks really felt tacked on so, I definitely recommend giving this album a listen because it is a great companion to a dinner party or a relaxing evening at home. Corinne's debut really is that soft, sweet, heartfelt music making the industry is truly lacking today.

However, there is nothing unique about her voice, and nothing exciting about this collection of songs.  Without her Reality TV backstory and dramatic entrance into pop culture, I'm not sure she would be considered much above a \\"good\\" church choir singer.    If you're looking for a calming, relaxing set of songs to listen to, you'll probably enjoy this CD. It would probably be well-received as a gift for the \\"older\\" folks in your family.

It's about a highly educated professor who gets early onset dementia; her disbelief, her truths, her denial, her struggles, her clarity are all depicted so well.  I felt like I was really seeing the world through her eyes, or perhaps someone close to her, as the story unraveled.<br /><br />I'm very impressed by this book, it lived up to all the hype I had been hearing about it.

B002XTBE6K|5.0|I've seen the various adaptations of Jane Austen's \\"Emma,\\" but no movie (or actress) really seemed to capture the lighthearted brightness, romance and sweetness of that book. Fortunately, such is not the case with the BBC's latest adaptation -- it's a sunlit, enchanting little story that dances along at a leisurely pace, and has a brilliant cast headed by the astonishingly good Romola Garai.<br /><br />After matchmaking her sister and her governess Miss Taylor (Jodhi May), Emma Woodhouse (Garai) fancies herself an expert on human nature, and on \\"nudging\\" couples into matrimony. The acerbic Mr. Knightley (Jonny Lee Miller) isn't impressed.<br /><br />And after Miss Taylor becomes Mrs. Weston, Emma ends up becoming best buddies with Harriet, (Louise Dylan) a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the illegimate daughter of \\"somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her, and focuses her efforts on matching Harriet to the rather smarmy but charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest matchmaking attempt falls apart, she vows not to mess with people's lives again -- but she can't help but be interested by Harriet's potential suitors.<br /><br />At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard of her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill (Rupert Evans), and the reserved and \\"perfect\\" Miss Jane Fairfax (Laura Pyper). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax -- and ends up alienating her further on a disastrous day out. And as she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.<br /><br />Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest, and this adaptation reflects that well -- it's bright and sunny most of the time, full of \\"fairyland\\" balls, lush green fields and forests, and the a quaint little village. There's some moments of seriousness (such as the somber, rainy examination of the similarities between Jane, Emma and Frank), but nothing that keeps Emma Woodhouse's sunny charmed life from proceeding as usual.<br /><br />Fortunately, the story also explores Emma's maturation over the course of a year or two, and the writers also expand on the feelings and lives of Frank, Jane and Mr. Woodhouse. Ir's laced with plenty of clever dialogue (\\"That man is so full of himself, I'm surprised he can stay on his horse!\\"), gently barbed humor and beautifully orchestrated moments of subtle romance, such as Emma and Knightley's dance together or Emma's simple declaration of \\"I began to examine my own heart, and there YOU were.\\"<br /><br />And Romola Garai makes the perfect Emma: young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but  also naive and a little snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, and Garai makes her lovable and endearing even when she screws up. Jonny Lee Miller is similarly brilliant as the restrained, stern Mr. Knightley with his sharp wit and unconventional habits (such as when he tells Emma why he rode a horse to a dinner party).<br /><br />The supporting cast is also brilliant: Michael Gambon is of particular delight as Emma's dismal hypochondriac dad, who still tried his best for his daughters, and Jodhi May is amazing as Emma's ex-governess. Dylan was adorable as the naive Harriet, and Evans and Pyper are excellent as Frank and Jane. Tamsin Greig, Blake Ritson and Robert Bathurst all do good jobs as well -- and Christina Cole is wonderfully horrible as the snobby, domineering Mrs. Elton.<br /><br />The newest adaptation of \\"Emma\\" is enchanting from beginning to end -- beautiful direction, solid writing, and an amazing cast.

The supporting cast is also brilliant: Michael Gambon is of particular delight as Emma's dismal hypochondriac dad, who still tried his best for his daughters, and Jodhi May is amazing as Emma's ex-governess. Dylan was adorable as the naive Harriet, and Evans and Pyper are excellent as Frank and Jane. Tamsin Greig, Blake Ritson and Robert Bathurst all do good jobs as well -- and Christina Cole is wonderfully horrible as the snobby, domineering Mrs. Elton.    The newest adaptation of \\"Emma\\" is enchanting from beginning to end -- beautiful direction, solid writing, and an amazing cast. Definitely a must-see for Austen aficionados.

B002VECM40|3.0|With the many nominations and awards Precious is likely to receive this year, I'm fairly confident \\"feel-good movie of the year\\" won't be one of them.  This film pulls no punches, and given the path it could have taken in trying to gloss up bleak and violent subject matter into a more thrilling and stylized type drama (see Slumdog Millionaire), I commend this movie for sticking to its guns.<br /><br />  The driving force behind this movie is the unyielding performance of Mo'Nique, who plays Precious's verbally and physically abusive mother, Mary. I would be very surprised not to see her name in the Best Supporting Actress ballot this year. Gabourey Sidibe, in the role of Precious, also delivers a tender and heartbreaking performance as an obese, illiterate 16-year old who has suffered from a lifetime of brutality and neglect.  Even Mariah Carey (yes, that Mariah Carey) does a very good job in her small role as a sympathetic yet hard-nosed social worker trying to get Precious to finally open up about her violent and trauma filled home life.<br /><br />  It's some of the little things in this film that really make it work. For instance, there is a scene about halfway through the film where Precious is sitting in her hospital room after recently giving birth to her second child. Her life outlook at this point is nothing short of dreadful, yet surrounded by her friends from class and her doctor who proves to be one of the few people in her life who actually care about her, Precious seems to be genuinely happy for the first time in her life.<br /><br />  While Lee Daniels directing proves to be very erratic at times, the strengths of lead performances are what really carry this movie along. While I wouldn't call it a masterpiece like many other seem to be doing, Precious is still a very good film that takes a gritty and honest look into the life of a child succumbed to a lifetime of physical and mental abuse.<br /><br />-Jeffrey Ryan<br /><br />[...]

B000NA28I4|1.0|Having read ALL of the Eragon books by now, I love this series, just not the movie. I made the mistake of going to see and later buying the movie on DVD before reading the book. After I did read it, the movie was a sheer disappointment. THEY EVEN LEAVE OUT SOME OF THE CHARACTERS! And they don't even mention the prophecy about the Menoa Tree and the Vault Of Souls.  For anyone who doesn't know what I'm talking about,  THE PROPHECY FORMS HALF THE STORY IN ALL OF THE BOOKS! Enough said.

B0026P3G12|3.0|I love the richness and depth in Susan Boyle's voice.  I felt like they changed her voice to sound like so many other voices of today.  Every once in a while I could hear the depth and the rich quality come through, but not consistently.  How I wish they had captured her natural voice and not changed it!  She has such great talent and I hope future cd's will be more her and not someone's idea of how she should sound.   Still a fan.

0307588335|2.0|Tons of reviews have already gone over the substance of this book.  It's a pretty bad book in a lot of ways: a turgidly overwritten bombastic tome that comes from a junior employee who really doesn't have much information about the company outside his narrow window beyond basic speculation.    Where it's rather interesting is as a psychological portrait of one of Wall Street's typical drones- we see an author who  1) has a massive ego, believing himself to be smarter than almost everyone around him  2) has a massive chip on his shoulder, constantly referring back to his lack of blue-chip education and his arrival into the world of the 7-figure bonus  3) really doesn't have much information about the actual workings of Lehman Brothers, but wants to appear as if he's in the center of everything.  4) doesn't appear to actually have much understanding of what he was dealing in- numerous passages point out that he spent most of his time executing the results of other people's research, and his own \\"research trip\\" to California to interview house salesmen in a bar was so ludicrously dumb you wonder if it was intended as a joke.  5) is utterly uncomprehending of how the combination of 1, 2, 3 and 4 make him look like a fool    McDonald spends a lot of time bashing the \\"bodybuilder\\" salesmen who needed no skill to push a worthless product and make a fortune doing it: anyone without his staggering lack of self-awareness would have looked in a mirror first.
B000JJRIN4|3.0|I absolutely hated her first album, and I found Rich Girl and Hollaback Girl highly obnoxious.  That being said, Sweet Escape really isn't a bad album.  It's not the best album I've heard, but it at least has some decent songs that aren't garbage.  U started it is the standout track on the album for me, I always feel like replaying that one.  Wonderful life, Fluorescent, and Early Winter are also worth listening to.  Sweet Escape is okay, but it gets annoying after a while.  4 in the morning is so-so.  The rest of the songs can be skipped over.

0316001821|5.0|Some books are worth reading multiple times and \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is a perfect example.  I've just finished my second reading, my first having transpired almost seven years ago.  Due to the vast period of time between those two readings, it was like reading it for the first time and I dare say that the second go-round was more stirring than the first.<br /><br />The story is told from the perspective of 14-year old Susie Salmon.  It begins on the day of her rape and murder by her reclusive neighbor George Harvey and continues in the aftermath of her death as her family grieves, Harvey hides and local police unsuccessfully attempt to locate her remains and convict her killer.  The novel spans eight years (beginning in 1973), Susie watching from her own personal version of heaven (hers always smells lightly of skunk, a neighboring soul's version like kumquats) as her mother and father grow apart, her sister Lindsey withdraws and her brother Buckley continues to feel her absence as he makes the transition from boy to young man.  In addition to her family, Susie follows the happenings of her crush Ray Singh and a poet and artist named Ruth Connors who has an inexplicable connection to her.  While pining for another coveted kiss with Ray and longing for her time back on Earth, Susie makes heartbreaking observations on how her death encourages the tightening of bonds between certain members of her family and community while tearing others apart.<br /><br />Each character is fully fleshed out.  Whereas most novels tend to concentrate on only a select few characters, author Alice Sebold invests a generous amount of personification in almost all of them.  Susie's mentality goes from girl to woman in the time she spends watching and ruminating on her family's actions, at one point getting to experience that womanhood in a way she never imagined.  Her mother Abigail is a dreamer, her wildness contained by domesticity, and after Susie's death she is a woman just going through the motions.  Her emotional disconnect thereafter finds her having an affair followed by a move out west, voluntarily estranging herself from her husband and surviving children for years.  Susie's father Jack grieves for her openly and often, something which makes it difficult for him to move on and his grief is made all the more affecting by Abigail's physical and emotional distance.  Lindsey is a rock; already in the angst-ridden valley of adolescence, she sinks even deeper into disquiet, choosing neither to show nor share her personal agony with anyone.  Buckley, only four at the time of Susie's death, begins to see as he matures how grief has weighed his family down and though equally saddened by his sister's passing becomes demonstrative about the importance of moving on when one day, much to his father's shock, he attempts to use Susie's clothes to fashion stakes for the tomato plants in his vegetable garden.<br /><br />Sebold paints a most chilling portrait of George Harvey with his quiet demeanor, an aloofness coupled with an invented status as a widower the ideal facade for his perverse machinations.  The reader is given a disturbing evolution of his unnatural urges and his habitual killing is made all the more unsettling by his composure and critical thinking throughout the entire process.  The creepiness factor reaches an all-time high when Sebold has him reflecting on Susie's murder one evening while taking a shower, the author smothering his meditation with twisted pleasure: \\"As he scoured his body in the hot water of his suburban bathroom...he felt thoughts of me then.  My muffled scream in his ear.  My delicious death moan.  The glorious white flesh that had never seen the sun, like an infant's, and then split, so perfectly, with the blade of his knife.  He shivered under the heat, a prickling pleasure creating goose bumps up and down his arms and legs.\\" (pg. 50)<br /><br />The novel has many poignant moments, particularly when Susie travels to a special part of heaven and meets all of Harvey's other victims, the girls shedding tears as they share their stories.  For me, it was the rekindling of affections between Jack and Abigail that moved me to tears as well as Abigail's absolution as she stood in Susie's room, grieving for her one last time as she professed her love.  Sebold draws upon her own harrowing experience (which she wrote about extensively and graphically in her 1999 memoir \\"Lucky\\") for the catalyst of this story, her memories and feelings channeled through her protagonist (Sebold was raped at knife-point in an underground tunnel, and a girl who had been raped at that location prior to her was murdered and dismembered).  It is with this realization that \\"The Lovely Bones\\" ceases to be just a well-written and unconventional novel about a restless spirit - it becomes a subtle yet rousing exploration of the author's own soul.<br /><br />Bottom line: Great contemporary fiction doesn't come better than this.  Sebold has a way with words which few authors possess and \\"The Lovely Bones\\" will have you ruminating on the possibilities of life after death as well as the perseverance of the people we will inevitably leave behind.ets all of Harvey's other victims, the girls shedding tears as they share their stories.

B002IKLZZY|5.0|In November 2009, Warner Home Video released the 50th Anniversary 2 disc edition of Alfred Hitchcock's splendid 1959 thriller \\"North by Northwest\\".  The film stars Cary Grant, Eva Marie  and James Mason and proves to be just the right blend of wit, sophistication, glamour and action.  Many critics consider \\"North By Northwest\\" to be the finest picture Hitchcock ever made.<br /><br />Beginning with the clever title sequence that opens with lines crisscrossing the screen like railroad tracks \\"North by Northwest\\" is one of those films that grabs your undivided attention from the very outset and simply never lets go.  Our hero Roger Thornhill (Cary Grant) finds himself unwittingly caught up in a case of international intrigue when foreign agents mistakenly identify him as a CIA operative named George Kaplan and abduct him.  He is taken to a compound on Long Island where heavy Phillip Vandamm (James Mason) gives him the third degree.  Thornhill desperately tries to convince his captors that they have made a mistake but they were simply having none of it.  Subsequently Thornhill manages to escape and in a desperate effort to get to the bottom of all of this he once again finds himself in the wrong place at the wrong time and is accused of the murder of a diplomat at the United Nations.  Now to further complicate matters we subsequently learn that there is no such person as George Kaplan!  Rather,  Kaplan is merely a non-existent operative created by U.S. Intelligence to draw attention away from the real operative in this melodrama Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint).  Once again Roger Thornhill is on the lam but this time he is not only being pursued by foreign agents but the the FBI and the police as well.  The plot thickens when Thornhill and Kendall meet on a westbound train.  The interplay between Cary Grant and Eva Saint Marie in this film is priceless.  Thornhill subsequently learns that George Kaplan does not even exist and agrees to help a spymaster Professor (Leo G. Carroll) in his pursuit of the bad guys.  Quite the experience for a New York advertising executive who was twice divorced because his ex-wives thought he lived a very dull life.<br /><br />When all is said and done I find there is little not to like about \\"North By Northwest\\".  Ernest Lehman's screenplay is simply brilliant with painstaking attention paid to even the smallest of details.  The photography is stunning and Bernard Herrmann's compelling musical score strikes just the right note at several key points in this motion picture.  And as usual Alfred Htichcock's direction proves to be virtually flawless.  \\"North By Northwest'  offers two of the most memorable scenes in the history of the movies.  Who can ever forget the cropduster sequence where a pilot attempts to run down Thornhill in an open field in the middle of nowhere.  And then there is the climatic scene on the face of Mount Rushmore.  Simply spectacular!  Both of these scenes were the result of ideas that Alfred Hitchcock had been tossing around in this head for years!<br /><br />As I mentioned at the top the deluxe 50th Anniversary edition of \\"North by Northwest\\" was just been released by Warner Home Video.  What a great package!  The \\"bonus\\" disc features extensive and incisive commentary by the film's screenwriter Ernest Lehman.  Numerous other features are also included on this disc that I have not yet had the time to sample.  The 50th Anniversary Edition of \\"North by Northwest\\" would be an awesome gift for just about any classic film buff.  Five decades later \\"North by Northwest\\" remains a fast paced thriller that will keep you on your toes from start to finish.  If you have never had an opportunity to see this film I urge you to grab yourself a copy.  Very highly recommended!) in his pursuit of the bad guys.

0316044938|5.0|What a moving story. I think I went through several different emotions throughout this easily read book. Writing detailed enough and impelling!
B0029LHW68|2.0|There Last Cd's were so much better. I could choose about 4 at the most of decent and catchy songs on this album. The choir of children singing on every song gets repetitive and annoying. This is not there finest work. They have tried something new it seems...and it's not working. This is not the 30stm that I'm used to. But then again this is just my opinion.    -Jason
B00005JLZN|1.0|There is a serious, thoughtful film that revolves around the death penalty issue...but it's not this one.  It's called DEAD MAN WALKING.  And even though it stars liberal actors Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn under the direction of uber-liberal Tim Robbins, that film considers all sides to the issue and doesn't come up with any easy answers.  Definitely check that one out.<br /><br />But THE LIFE OF DAVID GALE, despite some powerhouse actors, is a train wreck of a movie.<br /><br />The plot itself doesn't just concede that the anti-death penalty activists cannot win the debate on their own arguments, it would also have a tough time winning its argument using every lie and manipulation in their bag of tricks...kind of like the Democratic Party right now.<br /><br />With each revelation, usually always in the form of a videocassette hanging in a motel room, you get the idea that the activists would do anything--in fact, the very crime that would call for a death penalty--to get their point across and to impose their beliefs on everyone.  I believe that's called fanaticism.  Ultimately, there are no innocent victims in this story and in some weird way, you end up disliking them for their fraudulent behavior at manipulating a serious issue.<br /><br />Is something worth winning if you have to lie to everyone to get it?<br /><br />This could've been a completely different movie if that had been considered.  And that movie would've had characters you cared about.<br /><br />But not this one.<br /><br />(Still love Laura Linney though.)

This is such a heartwarming story, and if you are sentimental and love victorian era sagas, you will love this.
B0019LY5IM|3.0|I just picked up my copy of Season 5 on DVD. While the show itself is amazing, and this season being equalling jaw dropping and intellectually challenging, this review is about the quality of product. In regards to the packaging, I am actually disgusted. After four seasons of the same packaging strategy, Buena Vista decided to change the packaging in the shows fifth season. While the packaging may look similar in the picture or even when you pick it up on the shelf, I must warn you it is not. THe slipcase has been completely redesigned and for the worse. On the first four seasons packaging a plastic, slightly transparent slipcase was used and the DVDs would come out the bottom. Now the packaging is a crummy solid cardboard slipcase and the DVDS are removed from the side of the case. The entire package is thinner than all the other boxsets, the number of DVDS are fewer than even season 4 (which was incredibly short because of the writer's strike). On top of all that, there are no inserts for this season, yet there is a slot for inserts that only house  a bunch of crappy coupons for bluray. When you place the box next to all the other seasons you immediately notice that the LOST logo is dramatically smaller than the rest, along with the picture. The number 5, in comparison to the rest of the seasons numbers is slightly higher and makes the dvd look like misfit or a shoddy bootleg. The quality of the DVDs are good, the menus are pretty cool (changes to white) and the bonus features are modest at best. One of the bonus features \\"Room 23 and beyond\\" brings you around the writer's room but some images are blurred out not to spoil anything. Also, they decided to make certain bonus features only available on Bluray. I don't know what Bueno Vista was thinking with the construction of this boxset, but it is easily the worse LOST boxset out there. I feel cheated, and the retail price is ridiculous for the quality you are receiving.
B000ZECQ08|5.0|Very good on special effects. My favorie scenes are the begining and the cave scene.
159448385X|5.0|I am in awe of this book. It is excellent, excellent, excellent. A lot of people throw the word \\"masterpiece\\" around too easily these days, but this one, I feel confident saying, truly deserves the label. The story is heart-wrenching, sometimes too painful to read, but in the end, after enormous suffering, it offers hope. I also highly recommend Hosseini's other book about Afghanistan, The Kite Runner.

B000094Q3I|5.0|There are now TWO CD issues of this album which requires some explanation...<br /><br />The first was released in 1995 in the UK on one of Ace Records label imprints - Beat Goes Public CDBGPM 101. It was a straightforward reissue of the US vinyl album on Prestige PR 7383. It ran to 37:46 minutes and had no mastering or remastering credits. The sound quality was ok, but it has been made redundant by...<br /><br />This 2nd issue - an upgraded 2003 remaster that adds three previously unreleased outtakes from the original session to the album's eight tracks (55:01 minutes).<br /><br />This new version on Beat Goes Public CDBGPM 156 has been transferred by JOE TARANTINO at the Fantasy Studios in California - and if I was to describe what's better - it's the vocals - they're far more amplified and to beautiful effect. Unfortunately, it's still a gatefold slip of paper that provides no history of the record (the original May 1965 liner notes are reproduced, but it's the usual vague Sixties babble that doesn't actually inform you of anything).<br /><br />Aged only 23, \\"New Folk Sound Of...\\" was recorded by Samuel Charters in the Webb Recording Studios in Chicago in just one day - 29 July 1964 - and released in the late summer of the following year. There are only 3 musicians - TERRY CALLIER on Guitar and Vocals, TERBOUR ATTENBOROUGH on Bass and JOHN TWEEDLE also on Bass. Another surprise is that all the songs are covers - five being Public Domain Traditionals while the other three were from songwriter catalogues of the time.<br /><br />Side 1 opens with the lovely and lonesome \\"900 Miles\\" which sets up his style and the album's overall feel. Although it's just him on Acoustic Guitar with his voice high up in the mix and the other instruments behind him, the effect is more FOLK-SOUL than just Folk or Roots. It's beautifully atmospheric - the kind of album you'd play on a quiet Sunday morning when you just want something soothing on the ear and brain.<br /><br />Some tracks work better than others. It's difficult to hear \\"Oh Dear What Can The Matter Be\\" now without thinking of a schoolyard song we used to sing which rudely rhymed a \\"Lavatory\\" with \\"Matter Be\\". But things get better with the quietly lovely \\"Johnny Be Gay If You Can Be\\" and \\"Cotton Eyed Joe\\". The difference on the remaster of \\"Cotton Eyed Joe\\" is stark - the vocals soar out of the speakers.<br /><br />One of the album's true masterpieces is Side 2's opener - the plea for racial equality and an end to all war - \\"It's About Time\\" (lyrics above). Written by a beat poet and a female US songwriter (Kent Foreman and Lydia Wood) and running to a mere 3:33 minutes, it features a lovely guitar strum, but this time it has the added double bass of TERBOUR ATTENBOROUGH which lifts the song out of it's folk-roots feel into something so much more powerful and substantial. It still sounds awesome to this day - as relevant then as it is now. It's followed by \\"Promenade In Green\\" which is a Negro song from Alabama copyrighted by Robert Kaufman and Len Chandler in 1961 (a year before Callier started singing) - it's heart-meltingly lovely. \\"I'm A Drifter\\" is excellent too, but probably overstays its welcome at just short of nine minutes.<br /><br />The extras are a revelation. It's easy to see why they were left off the album - it's not that they're sub-standard - it's just that they were more of the same and something had to give. Which is good news for us some 45 years later because the gambling song \\"Jack O' Diamonds\\" is superb. But the real winner is his cover of the Judy Collins song \\"The Golden Apples Of The Sun\\" which incorporated the poetry of William Butler Yates into the words. It's gorgeous. What a find!<br /><br />As you've no doubt gathered, I've been soppy about Terence Orlando Callier for years, so perhaps my review is overly gushing - but once your weary lugs actually hear this criminally forgotten gem, you'll understand why...<br /><br />Despite the lack of notes and an appreciation of the man's legacy - this is a great reissue of a soft and graceful start - and a philosophy to life that continues to inspire to this day.<br /><br />I strongly urge you to get this superb CD reissue into your life.<br /><br />PS: see also my reviews for the two albums he followed \\"Folk Sound\\" with - \\"Occasional Rain\\" (1972 on Cadet) and \\"What Color Is Love\\" (1973 on Cadet).ful start - and a philosophy to life that continues to inspire to this day.     I strongly urge you to get this superb CD reissue into your life.

B002BSHXJA|4.0|Yes, this is an amazing pressing of Beatles music. The best that's ever been offered on CD. You will not be disappointed in this collection unless... you consider what could have been offered on a better medium like blu-ray or LP. Word has it that these masterings will eventually be released on LP and you can bet your ears the music will sound even warmer. As far as digital goes, Neil Young is right, why wouldn't they release this music on blu-ray disc as it is a far larger informational format. Young did it with his \\"Archives\\" set and the possibilities are endless. Now we'll be relegated to waiting another decade or two until they decide to re-master this set for the best formats at that time, let's hope they actually take advantage of the best digital available, not the one that's been around for over 20 years.

I expect that with the way his mind works, it couldn't be anything else.<br /><br />While I appreciated the humor and the honesty of the book; more than anything, I appreciated the inspirational aspect.  It is truly inspiring from many levels and many angles.<br />I hope you find this review helpful.<br /><br />Michael L. Gooch<br />Author of [[ASIN:1897326882 Wingtips with Spurs]]
B002JM1VJG|5.0|Ok, some people wanted the American Life video, some others the original version of Justify my Love, but lets face it, the videos on this dvd are masterpieces by their own. Just see whats doing Britney or Lady Gaga, Madonna have done it all before! Long live the Queen!
B000002BQK|5.0|About a year ago, I bought this album on Amazon only because I knew the song Honey, and wanted to see what the rest of it was like. I bought the CD used and the seller shipped it right away! Anyway, this album shows a more raw Mariah and really brings out her innocent side. I don't know if she could ever top this one. Favorite songs: Close My Eyes, Honey, Fourth of July, My All.

B000A88EV4|5.0|The 1990s were better than the 80s overall for cinema.  Not to give a history lesson, but the rise of the new independent market in 1989 (Miramax, Sex Lies & Videotape, etc.) led to  large number of successful independent films (the most since the 1970s).  When this film debuted at Cannes, in May of 1993, the decade was still finding itself (I use 1991-2000 as the scientific definition of the 1990s).<br /><br />I think this incredibly well-made drama is a true 90s film.  There had been a few up until that point.  I would use The Double Life of Veronique (1991), Unforgiven (1992), Hard Boiled (1992), Short Cuts (1993), as great examples of the best of early 90s cinema.  And this film in particular is so well put together, that it is the first film I mention when someone asks me to indentify the best english-language films of the 90s.<br /><br />Briefly stated, Naked is an incredibly well acted, well shot, and perfectly executed drama about transient people and how they interact in the digital age.  That alone must sound pretentious.  And when I first saw Naked on Criterion laserdisc in 1994, I thought the same thing.  But then the film simply grew on me.  This is a drama that demands that the audience sympathize with a brilliant-yet-brutal drifter of a man, Johnny, created and portrayed by the gifted David Thewlis.  Further complicating things for the audience, Johnny is from Manchester, a region of England that is not too well understood, even among Londoners.  But this film quickly makes you acquainted with Johnny and where he's from through the dialogue, which was put together by director Mike Leigh and his actors through intensive rehearsals and improvisations (making this film all the more remarkable).  They created these characters, the start point, and the end point as a team.  And it is an extraordinary work of art.<br /><br />This film felt ultra-contemporary when it was new, and it still seems fresh today.  It was very well shot by Dick Pope, who has been Mike Leigh's DP ever since Life is Sweet (1991).  It features high-contrast day and night shots, revealing a London we seldom see in color films today.  Some shots - the 'catering carts' shot and the Johnny 'apocalypse monologue' in the office building in particular are  stunning.<br /><br />Mike Leigh is not a filmmaker I would compare to Rainer Werner Fassbinder, but his dark themes and stagy dramatic elements in this film sure do come close to an urban Fassbinder film.  Like Fassbinder, Leigh  is both a playwright and filmmaker.  Each time you watch this movie, a new theme, icon, cultural or historical reference reveals itself.  This isn't Lost or a Rush album cover, but there are more than enough little bits for thinking audience members to chew on and discuss.<br /><br />This film is somewhat experimental, in that it throws a lot at you in just over two hours.  It is not entirely realistic in that the topics the characters discuss are not usually what real people talk about when they first meet.  But I think that makes this movie all the more fascinating.  It is a real thinking person's movie - a true 21st century drama.  And you can immediately tell how much each actor was directed to construct their characters as much as possible.  Mike Leigh has his story take shape mainly through rapid and clever dialogue, and what a sweeping picture his actors' words create.  This is a movie about people without a home.  It is a simple yet rare theme in movies.<br /><br />Johnny moves through London in a scenario loosely inspired by The Odyssey.  His journey takes him through over 30 sleepless hours, and 4 long conversations (or monologues if the other party is bewildered by his complexity).  But unlike The Odyssey, where our hero comes back to where he started to vanquish a villain, Johnny comes back to his odyssey's start point to meet another brutal, albeit wealthier version of himself.  That man, played by writer/director/producer Greg Crutwell (in his acting debut), issimply one of the greatest villains of the 90s, in my opinion.  His Jeremy/Sebastian character is at once unusual, unique, evil, awkward, brutal, and simply wonderful to watch.  Hollywood remembers great 90s villains played by Tommy Lee Jones, Gary Oldman, Jack Nicholson, Kevin Spacey, and Ed Harris, among others.  But I will never forget this guy (he's an alt-villain, perhaps).  It is a real stroke of genius that Mike Leigh would construct the film so that the two male protagonists are essentially variations of the same theme (brilliant mind, brutal towards women, masochistic, perhaps suicidal), which allows this film to build layers and layers upon itself and the audience without hitting viewers on the head to pay attention to any one of the themes being thrown at them.  It takes multiple viewings to understand and appreciate Naked.<br /><br />The editing and the film's score come together wonderfully.  Mike Leigh totally went outside his comfort zone to do many scenes that propel this multi-themed story forward (I think this movie set a record for number of shots and scenes in a Mike Leigh film).  Again, it feels fresh and crisp today as it wowed Cannes in 1993 (where Leigh took home best director honors, and David Thewlis was crowed best actor).  You just have to see it in order to understand what an amazing accomplishment it is.  Some scenes will sound like Montey Python.  Other scenes will feel like older Mike Leigh movies or plays.  And still other sequences are unlike anything Leigh had done before.  But the end result is Leigh's darkest and one of his very best works.  A must for any 90s collection.  And a truly visionary, risk-taking film that tries to dissect western civilization.....\\"in a quirky sort of way.\\"90s, in my opinion.

0307269760|3.0|The author's credentials are well known, but that doesn't necessarily translate into an enjoyable reading experience.  The problem here is the overemphasis on \\"atmospherics\\" at the expense of \\"plot\\". Although some of the stories in this collection are extremely well done, an equal number seem pointless--perhaps meant to be admired for their literary pedigree alone?  As a result, this is a  \\"slow going\\" text that requires a substantial expenditure of time with only intermittent rewards.
B001OQCV2O|4.0|Overall, great, I'll give it an 8. It's certainly worth watching. Sadly a few strategic mistakes on the part of the director and writer watered the movie down.    The destruction scenes are awe-inspiring. I actually got goose-bumps watching some of it, a first for this 50 year old viewer. The scope, complexity, imagination, and excellence. I'm an expert viewer but to me it looked really realistic, I didn't see anything I could recognize as computer animation even though I know that's mostly what it was. Had I been the producer and the creative team came to me with a plan for what they wanted to do I would have thrown them out of my office: \\"ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND? Stop wasting time and put something down that we actually have a chance of completing in less than 10 years.\\" Also at least one of the destruction scenes (the one were they drove through a sky-scraper) featured various sight-gags and funny content that I enjoyed and laughed out loud. However this came at the expense of lightening the tone of a scene in which thousands of people are supposedly dying.    The soundtrack was awesomely detailed, at least at first. During the scene were Cusack showed up at his ex-wife's house and then an earthquake hit, there were all sorts of interesting sounds happening and they sounded good and clear. One neat sound was timber creaking as the house gave way. In later scenes I did not notice that detail.    A surprise was the many big stars. Danny Glover, John Cusack (with less and even no (!) guy-liner this time), Oliver Platt, and Woody Harrelson.     Woody Harrelson's character provided the comic relief and it was good. It came across well and also funny, but they avoided the mistake of making him annoying or too silly, also he moved the plot along. It was good but it could have been funnier. It would not have been as much fun with an unknown actor, so Woody carried the character more than the dialog.    The drama was good but not great so this movie could not have ever made it to 10 status. A little trite and pedantic during the speech section near the end.    No, I repeat NO Mayan content. Only a brief mention and one watermarked shot of the Mayan city of Tikal. They mangled the word \\"Quiché.\\" It's pronounced key-TCHAY (like touché but it's a hard ch like tch, not a soft one like sh), they pronounced it \\"quiche\\" as in \\"I'll have the quiche Lorraine, please.\\" That was unbelievable. They also mispronounced Tikal, which is pronounced Tee-KAHL. I forget what they said but it was something ridiculous like \\"tickle.\\" Anyway it doesn't matter because other than that one line of dialog you could watch the entire movie and never realize that Mayans were involved. I think this was an odd and poor choice. Other movies like \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\\" \\"Star Gate,\\" \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" and \\"National Treasure\\" make good drama with quasi-factual archeological content. In this case there was some real and really interesting factual content on which to draw but they passed. The movie would have been a large notch more worthwhile had they thrown in some tidbits. A little hieroglyphics here, a little pyramid skulking there, a few fascinating facts about \\"El Gran Jaguar\\" (the main pyramid in Tikal) or \\"El Mirador\\" (possibly the world's largest pyramid, located in Northern Guatemala), it could have been done without bogging the movie down.    The tone was too light. I mean the world is ending, millions of people are dying, but the overall tone was light and a little upbeat, focusing on the few that were making it out alive. In particular, the scenes in the plane were way too light, especially Cusack's ex-wife. They would just barley make it out with their lives with the world crumbling right beneath them and entire cities sinking into the ocean, and then once air-born she would look up almost smiling and just go on with her dialog like nothing had happened. It was almost like \\"Oh wow, I'm glad that's over. We made it! Is my hair mussed? Oh well, what's next? Is it lunch time yet?\\" For me those lines were so misplaced that it was a distraction.    The biggest strategic mistake of the director was evenly spacing the action out over the entire movie. It was like drama-action-drama-action-drama-action. The voltage varied constantly throughout from high voltage action back to low-voltage talking heads. The early action scenes had major impact on me, later ones had a \\"more-of-the-same\\" effect and my reaction was \\"Oh, we have to do more action now? Ho-hum, OK, let's get it over with.\\" The movie would have been much better if they had adopted a more conventional pacing, put most of the drama and character development up front, then launch into the action and continually build to the climax. Had they done it this way the movie might have been a 9, but without a better dramatic story it still would not have been a 10.    Larry Brown
1401323820|5.0|I'm still reading this book but to be honest that's not why I bought it or rated it so high. This item is exactly like it appears in the show, even going so far as to have the dedication to KB and Castle's friends at the police dpt. The sex scene is on page 105, just like they talked about in the episode. This is just a fantastic item for any fan of the show and if I hadn't bought it for myself I would have LOVED to receive it as a gift. Get this! You won't regret it.
B00005JLF5|3.0|This series doesn't really get good until Wharf(sp?) arrives.  It gets even better when war breaks out in the later seasons.
B001UFQNF0|5.0|I was a few years too young to see the first Back to the Future in the theaters, but can still remember riding home from the second installment:  my brother and I were flipping imaginary switches and performing sound effects the entire way home, somehow convinced that a Honda Civic hatchback could double for Doc Brown's DeLorean.  We dreamt of building our own Flux Capacitors and someday adding superfluous tubing to the exteriors of the cars we hoped to own.  I had a lunchbox (with thermos), but the merchandising for this franchise fell well short of the hopes and expectations of an entire generation of fans.  My son (5 y.o.) is a Back to the Future NUT.  He hums the theme song to himself, practices sketching schematics of the Flux Capacitor, and plays out each role as he watches the movies for the fiftieth time (except for Doc; I do a wicked Christopher Lloyd).  While my childhood was lacking in sufficient outlets for such fanaticism, thankfully someone FINALLY decided that a proper toy DeLorean find its way into the world, and my son can get his Christmas wish, which is for \\"a time machine\\" OR (if that's unavailable) \\"a Flux Capacitor, DeLorean car, and enough 'plutomium'\\"to generate the \\"1.21 jigowatts for the time curcuits.\\"  I get a kick out of it every time he says it, and now thanks to Diamond Select Toys and Entertainment Earth I can give him the go-ahead to ask Santa for what he really wants.  Hopefully he won't be disappointed that it's just a toy!      PROS:     * The sounds are varied enough to keep the feature interesting.     * The head and taillights are a little ordinary, but the glowing blue time travel mode is AWESOME!!!     * The details (number of items, quality of depiction, coloration, etc.) on the outside of the car are far better than I had expected.     * The product in general is somewhat larger than I had imagined, and combined with the other features makes it well worth the price considering comparable toys at the store.     * It's the freakin' DeLorean from Back to the Future!!!    CONS     * The doors are cool, though they seem a bit flimsy, and could lock into place a little better.     * Lowering the tires is a little difficult, as each wheel has its own \\"attitude\\" toward the function; it's still a cool feature integral to the BTTF II edition.     * The Flux Capacitor is somewhat hidden, and can only be seen clearly when looking directly into the windshield.    All told, despite the tires, I'm extremely satisfied with this item and am very much looking forward to providing such an undeniably cool toy to my son for his surprisingly good behavior this year.  Anyone who is a fan of Back to the Future (and possesses the required level of geekitude) should be more than happy with this item and its counterparts from the rest of the trilogy.
0525951113|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend and I was mildly intrigued by the description.  After the first 40 pages or so, I was hooked and drawn into the story.  Practically non-stop action, suspense, and a dash of philosophy now and then.  And the fate of spammers is the secret desire of anyone with an e-mail account.<br /><br />This is a description of what a full-scale cyberwar against corporate and government infrastructures might be like.  For me, it also pointed out the reliance modern society has on technology.  If that tech was suddenly no longer available or was completely compromised by your enemy, how could you fight back?
B001FB55I0|2.0|The movie was great and all, but what happened to the extras (Deleted Scenes, Bloopers, Gag Reel and other extras)?  This was a bare bones release.  If they are going to release a movie to DVD, they should have all the extras that the fans would like to have.  What's the deal on the digital copy?  Why should I have to log onto the Web to get my digital copy.  I paid for a 2-Disc set, do I expect to have a DVD of the movie and a Digital Disc copy of the movie, not a coupon to download the digital copy.  Let's see that's fraud in my opinion or disceptive practices.  Wonder what the FCC would think about this?
B002JCSWUW|5.0|I saw this movie at a screening last night in Hollywood and I heartily recommend it.  Clint Eastwood is an astute director who let's his characters breathe on screen.  As he's gotten older he's worked with better actors especially in his role as a director and the audience reaps the benefit.  Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon are excellent.  As with other Eastwood movies the characters are bloodied mentally, physically and spiritually but they get up, and they move on which is an accurate reflection of what each of us must do to some degree or other in this life.    A picture such as this is a difficult one, do you attempt a whole biography, or do you focus on a period and on the paths of a few of the characters.  Wisely Eastwood chooses to focus on the latter which he skillfully uses to illuminate Mandela's vision, leadership, faith in humanity and pragmatism whilst also showing the transitions that individuals and the country had to make as much needed changes were implemented.  This is a brave film that invites you into the story as a participant rather than have you separated from the story as an observer.
B002LFIZDG|5.0|For years I've been toying with the notion of liking KoC..  I've had a digital copy of \\"Quiet is the New Loud\\" for several years and would occasionally give it a listen. However, when I picked up Declaration of Dependence, my appreciation for them went to a whole new level.  This is quite possible one of the most beautifully understated folk albums you'll ever here. Tranquil yet interesting, each song is it's own peaceful gem, yet as a whole the album fits well together.<br /><br />For those who've never heard of KoC, the easiest comparison would be a sort of modern day Simon & Garfunkel. You get colorful harmonies (esp. the chorus on \\"Me In You\\"), passionate violin in \\"Peacetime Resistance\\", and intriguing rhythms in \\"Rule My World\\". Despite these citations, every song has something to offer.<br /><br />A peaceful album full of treasures.. highly recommended!

B001993Y2C|5.0|I think enough has been said about the packaging so I am going to move on to the show itself since it is what makes the packaging of any value at all. I watched BSG from the beginning on SciFi. Although the show was only \\"four\\" seasons it took years to see the whole thing on television. The show took the dark premise (the destruction of human civilization)of the original series and kept that tone throughout the series as opposed to the original series which used the premise as a jumping off point for galactic adventures in the vein of Star Trek. The show was very different  in the way it developed its characters. BSG characters were flawed, tragic,and more Shakespearian than the noble characterizations in series past. There will be times you despise \\"the good guys\\" and sympathizing with \\"the bad guys\\".<br />The series had many controversial story arcs that forced you to really think about some of the issues of the day. **Spoiler Alert** For me, the most memorable story arc was the Cylon occupation of the new human homeworld. Although, the creators said it was based on the Nazi occupation of France it did speak to the war in Iraq. It reminded me of the science fiction of 1970's that spoke to issues like Vietnam and it was something I haven't see very often in science fiction television.<br />The DVD extras really help you get into the creators' head on how the show evolved. I like listening to Ronald D Moore podcasts and the little gaffes where you can hear the phone in his house ringing, the neighbor's gardeners or his kids yelling. It reminds of listening to the podcasts when they first came out. There are lot of deleted scenes you can watch to get even more of the story.<br />The picture quality improves as the series progresses and there are many shots that will make your jaw drop and the sound mix is great.<br /><br />BSG is one of my favorite televisions series of all time and the Blu-ray really does it justice.

B000GPI2EK|5.0|Mastodon is a band that, to me, generally gets better with every release. \\"Call of the Mastodon\\" (although wasn't their earliest release, is a collection of their earliest-recorded material) and \\"Remission\\" showcased their experimental grindcore side. They then took a step towards a more progressive-metal direction with \\"Leviathan\\", which combined stomping riffs with skilled songwriting. After that came this album, \\"Blood Mountain\\". I can't decide which is my personal favorite Mastodon album (it's generally a toss-up between this and their newest release \\"Crack The Skye\\"), but regardless, I think \\"Blood Mountain\\" is one of the best metal albums of the decade.    From the breakneck-speed thrash-metal crushers of \\"The Wolf Is Loose\\" and \\"Crystal Skull\\", the band shows you that they've definitely got a metal edge. They then take it down a bit and go into \\"Sleeping Giant\\" a beautiful and melodic, slower song that delves in their more progressive and experimental side, with an almost ambient sound going on. Then we go to the instrumental \\"Bladecatcher\\", which is an absolute personal joy. This song is so crazy and experimental, it's like listening to Frank Zappa after he's had ten cups of coffee. These are just a few of the amazing songs on this album.    Another great thing about \\"Blood Mountain\\" is that, as great as all the songs are, they're concise enough and not too drawn out, with most songs being about either three-and-a-half minutes long or five minutes long. I admit, I do love the 13-minute epic \\"Hearts Alive\\" off \\"Leviathan\\", but everything in the song department on this album is just right. The musicianship is also even better than on \\"Leviathan\\", and with that being said, I would like to add that Brann Dailor is one of the absolute greatest metal drummers of this decade, case closed.    Overall, this album is a perfect combination of metal aggression, skilled songwriting, talented musicianship and is just an overall masterpiece. Very highly recommended, \\"BloodMountain\\" shows us that metal is indeed alive in the 2000's, and just as ferocious as ever. Thanks for the time, and peace.
0316044695|5.0|It was extremely interesting to see what life is like for an elite American warrior.  How these people make it through their training without quitting is incredible when you read what they are put through. However, while learning about what it takes to be a Navy Seal is interesting, the real interesting part is the account of the author's battle with three friends against a large Taliban force high in the Hindu Kush.  It takes a real man to be willing to have a helicopter drop you and three fellow warriors in the heart of enemy territory in terrain that is only comprehensible if you have ever climbed a mountain higher than 12000 feet.  Even then, these elite warriors traversed terrain that was terribly steep and inhospitable to, if discovered, potentially fight a fearless, determined enemy on its home turf.  All four seals involved in this true account were awarded medals and they definitely earned them. When the story reaches the part where the fighting and evasion of the Taliban begins, it is riveting.  A must read if you want to have any idea what it might be like to be an elite soldier in Afghanistan.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This documentary is awesome and truly shows how brain-washed the American people are when it comes to food.  If we continue to accept being fed low cost, low nutrition food, our young children will die from heart disease and diabetes before we do. We are creating a nation of fast, fat food addicted people. Look around, the evidence is clear. These government regulatory agencies are out for one thing and one thing only... the might dollar.  Most of the information presented is not \\"new\\", but the issues are becoming more mainstream and this movie illustrates this for the general public and needs to be seen.
0316001821|1.0|SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!!!    A friend recommended this book to me. I had heard about it briefly that it was becoming very popular, but at the time I didn't know it was going to be a movie. Some of the characters in this book really got under my skin. Susie's mother for instance. It was hard to focus on other aspects of the book when i couldn't get over what a selfish woman Susie's mother was. I though the end was just ridiculous. There was no justice for the other 5 or so woman that he killed. I thought it was ridiculous that Susie says she feels bad for Mr. Harvey when she realizes that he tries not to kill. He raped her and cut her into pieces! The fact that she comes back to earth and all she does is have sex with a guy she kissed once when she was 14 just doesn't make sense. Ruth, a girl who had only spoken to Susie like one day, becomes completely obsessed for years. This book is completely unbelievable except for Mr. Harvey, and that is the most chilling part. People like that really exist in this world. That is the message I got  coming away from this book. The only lingering thing that I will remember. It is rare for me that this type of book comes along, but i truly think this will be better as a movie. As a book i just don't think it reads well.
B002NUULNG|5.0|If you don't already own a copy of GITS and have a Blu ray player this is the copy you want to buy. looks amazing in hd and is an anime classic. It also has the original version of the movie under the extras menu for those hard core fans who like the original movie's look better. This is a must own for any anime fan.
B001W63DX2|5.0|I remember seeing Iron Maiden and Judas Priest (talk about a great 'double bill'!) at The Palladium in NYC, back when Paul DiAnno was the vocalist (yes, i'm a 'fossil' of 48, LOL!).  Seeing the artwork on that first album (does anyone remember LP's?) and seeing them live pretty much convinced me that I would probably be an Iron Maiden fan for life!  They were that good, and that original as the British invasion of metal spanned the globe (Saxon, Def Leppard, Judas Priest, Maiden, etc.).  To see them come this far, and be so widely loved and acclaimed worldwide is great.  This DVD captures the essence and passion of their worldwide fan base, and shows how much of a 'renaissance man' Bruce truly is, given his many talents and varied interests.  Of course, seeing a documentary (rockumentary) of Bruce pilot a Boeing 757 carrying his bandmates, crew, and equipment is awesome.  There are many comical and lighthearted moments in this DVD as we observe Bruce and company handle the logistics of a major world tour.  The other DVD consists of full songs (one song each) culled from each city of their world tour.  The performances are passionate and tight, and the video and audio quality second to none.  These guys are probably old enough to be grandparents, yet they still command the stage as if they were in their 20's!  Get this double-DVD set.  You won't regret it.
B002LK3DUQ|4.0|As well crafted as we have come to expect from Pixar. A tad long on the introduction, but overall a good story.
0061537969|5.0|This book was highly recommended on Amazon - I knew it was about a dog but I did not realize the dog wrote the book.  In the beginning of the book I found this a little bizarre; however, the book was extremely enjoyable and the story grabbed me.  I was so sorry when I finished the book as I wanted more.
0316010669|5.0|I was absolutely fascinated by this book. I got bogged down in a few places, but overall, the studies, observations, and anecdotes that Gladwell combines in his trademark readable style were absorbing. My edition had an Afterword which I highly commend--conclusions he's come to from feedback since the book's first publication.<br /><br />I was particularly interested in the studies on facial expressions and their significance. I'd always heard that you should smile when you're talking on the telephone, but studies indicate an even more powerful connection between facial expression and emotion. When researchers intentionally mimicked facial expression identified with negative, sad, or evil emotions, they literally started feeling bad!<br /><br />Another fascinating conclusion the Gladwell comes to -- and of particularly significance in this age of information overload -- is that there is a \\"sweet spot\\" of optimal decision making where we make the best decision, and after that, more information actually deteriorates the quality of decision making. Interesting stuff!

159448385X|5.0|Searingly beautiful, painful story of Afghan women and their unbearable lives during the various regimes from Russian occupation through the Taliban and then liberation. The power of a parent's love can pierce and redeem the most unbearable existence. Beauty and hope may become dormant but can flare up and overcome evil and poverty and degradation. This is truth told through fiction, and it is haunting.
0345495004|5.0|Very well written, it draws you into their lives. The book gives a great insight into this artist and should be interesting for any one who enjoys his work. I read the book then went to Chicago and toured his home and studio, this really brought the book to life.
B002WTC8RA|5.0|Absolutely wonderful -- reminiscent of 84 Charing Cross Road  -- story and characters revealed through letters to each other, primarily from -- or to -- the protagonist Juliet, an author and lover of books in London, immediately after WWII.  As she researches her next book, she begins a correspondence with residents of the Guernsey Islands and learns about their trials and tribulations during the German occupation of their home. This was an enchanting book that you don't want to end -- and pray there will be a sequel so you can continue your adoring involvement with these beautifully cast characters. This book was a gem.<br /><br />A lovely excerpt: \\"I wonder how the book got to Guernsey? Perhaps there is some secret sort of homing instinct in books that brings them to their perfect readers. How delightful if that were true.\\"
0375758992|5.0|Exquisitely vivid memoir of the author's childhood in the midst of a dysfunctional British family in Africa (Rhodesia, Malawi and Zambia), but the darkness is redeemed by the beautiful writing, the honest humor, and her love for her family and her adopted country. It is a glimpse of a world and a time (1970s and 1980s) that we Americans would otherwise not have, and I was so glad to have read the book.
B0006284JQ|3.0|I'm late to the game in reviewing this cd, though I've owned it for a few  years now.  I just reviewed some of the most positive and most negative reviews here.  I have to say that, without a doubt, the 1-star reviews are quite amusing since Britney is still here, 3-4 years later, having number one hits (and ANOTHER greatest hits package).      What is true about what some of the 1-star reviewers wrote:  Britney isn't a musician in the sense that she doesn't play an instrument and doesn't write her own material.  What these people fail to mention is that the same could be said for some very well regarded pop vocalists of the 20th century -- say, Frank Sinatra.  Okay, so I'm not comparing Britney with Frank on a vocal level.  I actually agree that Britney is not a particularly good singer.  That's besides the point, however.  Britney's music is not about pure singing ability.  It isn't about depth of meaning.  It's ear candy, pure and simple.  Equal credit needs to be given to her producers and songwriters for without the catchy pop hooks, these songs would not hold up.  I liken some of Britney's best tracks (among these I include Oops, Toxic, and Hit Me Baby) with some of the classic bubble-gum pop of days gone by -- songs like The Archies' \\"Sugar Sugar\\" or any number of Partridge Family records.  The bottom line is that you either like this kind of catchy pop or you don't.  I can understand some people not liking this kind of music, but why even write a review of the cd if this style of music isn't to your liking?  To suggest that people who do like this kind of music should instead listen to Tom Waits, Pink Floyd, Randy Newman, or any of the other number of aging, white men that some of the 1-star reviewers mentioned is just ludicrous!  I actually like some of that music, too, but it isn't like I want a musical diet that solely consists of songs written and performed by old, white men.
B000056HE9|5.0|The more I see this film, the more I like it.  This film has a definite ring of reality and truth.  Anyone who has had ministry experience will empathize with David Niven's character as the pastor of a church that is in somewhat of a decline.  After years of struggling to grow his church, he is desparate to \\"save\\" his church and his ministry by securing the funding of a new building program.  He is so focused on this goal that he is willing to sacrifice his ideals and his marriage in order to achieve it.  What's very realistic about this is that Niven's character thinks he is doing \\"God's work\\" in his pursuit.  Unless one has been in full-time ministry, it is difficult to grasp the pressure ministers are under to \\"produce\\" growth - to have a \\"successful\\" ministry.  This pressure is captured very well in the film.  In the process of achieving this funding for a new church building, Niven's character has lost sight of Who and what he is serving, and worse, he is totally unaware of his cold and \\"stagnant\\" relationships with God, his wife, his co-workers, and those he is called to love and serve.    In steps an angel, Cary Grant, who is sent to influence this driven, over-worked, frantic, and misguided pastor/husband to recover his once-sincere devotion to his God, to his ministry, and to his wife.  Complications arise when Grant's character and the pastor's (Niven) wife, Loretta Young, are attracted to each other.  The angel falls in love with the pastor's neglected and dispirited wife.    Of course everything works out in the end.  The angel (Grant) accomplishes his mission and the pastor is restored to genuine love of God and his wife.  There are many sweet and endearing characters and scenes along the way.  I highly recommend this for your Christmas season viewing.
B00006J9OT|5.0|I forget where I discovered this amazing performer...but I am so glad I did!  It is fun to listen to her own unique interpretation of some old jazzy standards. And her voice reminds me of being in a night club in the 40's (at least from what I can tell from the movies!)
B002NVTBOU|5.0|For those of you who love a sultry, deep, playful voice with infectious rhythms, Buika is a wonderful discovery.  Her CD Mi Nina Lola, released a few years ago, is a blessing.  This CD she released, with Chuco Valdes on piano, is beautiful.  Her voice plays off his piano, and vice-versa in a way that is hynotizing.  See her in person if you get the chance.  We saw her in Miami recently to a captivated, sold-out audience.  FIVE stars!
0316069906|5.0|I cannot say that I enjoyed reading the book or better the dreadful methods under which animals are reared, prepared and delivered for us to fill our stomachs.

B0013D8LCW|3.0|I was disappointed after finishing this movie, especially after all the rave reviews.  Maybe it's just me, but why are there so many gay movies with the same types of plots?  Homophobia, AIDS, coming out...always seems to be the same boring sort of thing.  This movie was mainly the coming out and homophobia storyline.  It is 2009 - most gay guys I know are out and the majority of straight people I know are OK with it.      How about we finally make a movie focused on true love, sensuality, good times between gay characters without any of the conflicted feelings of coming out or dealing with homophobic idiots?  I was expecting that in this but there are very few moments of romance in this movie and most of them are ruined by someone who seems to be uncomfortable with actually getting out of that frickin closet or by his homophobic sister.      I felt bad for Shawn as if he deserved to be treated a lot better instead of having to deal with a straight/gay split personality type that is more focused on pleasing his stupid homophobic, irresponsible sister (that isn't very nice by the way) than throwing himself into a relationship that is very real, very loving and supportive, and could be so much more.  In the end, it was just an OK movie, a lot like other gay movies I've seen.  Might be worth a rent, but not worth buying.
0061537969|2.0|Sorry folks, but as someone who thoroughly enjoyed 'Marley & Me' and 'Rescuing Sprite', I found this book a huge disappointment.  I mean, how can you write about a dog and have it be boring?  Well, this author has managed it.  It dragged on and on and after awhile I found myself skipping his chapters that only referred to racing.  His racing 'analogies' were a stretch and I was often wondering how it had anything to do with the story or whether it was merely the writer anxious to write about racing.  Because the book was written from the point of view of the dog, he had little need to know any of his subjects thoroughly.  No detail on the illness; no detail on the place where the character works.  Not enough detail anywhere to really paint a picture in your mind.  Just details on the racing--which didn't matter.  It was extremely predictable throughout.  Much as I was hoping to love the dog, there isn't enough depth to the story to make you really get attached to him or the family. It's just way too basic, no depth, no real heart-warming stuff at all.  I didn't get sad or choked up in any of the parts that should have been emotional, because, alas, it was too simple.  No heart.  No soul.  Not sure how it got to be a best seller.  I'm putting it in the giveaway bin.  (And lest you wonder, I STILL get choked up when Dorothy says goodbye to the Scarecrow in 'Wizard of Oz'.)
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this DVD. There are many exercise DVD out there and I tried many, and ended up injuring my knees because the trainer doesn't tell you how to do the move without getting injured. Since I started on this program, my knees are feeling much better and I feel great! My posture is better, my energy level is high (I have a 6 week baby, go figure) and I feel my body is getting toned. I haven't felt like that in quite so long!
B002OFWG7O|5.0|Great compilation of their hits. Love track 16...acoustic version of Everlong.  DVD just as great also.
B00009R86L|5.0|I was looking for a brown leather shoulder pad to match my messenger bag but stumbled upon this Domke pad. Sure its not brown to match but it more than makes up for it in comfort and usability. I can take it on and off with ease to use for any bag I need. This shoulder pad is perfect!
B0029LHW68|3.0|On their first album, 30 Seconds to Mars was creatively forward moving, while keeping hold of the past. I had caught influences of Peter Gabriel and Depeche Mode, but in a newer arena of music. It was fresh, and ultimately became one of the albums I would listen to for the entire decade. Their second album, A Beautiful Lie, lost the creativity but helped to gain 30STM a worldwide audience. Can't say I was a big fan of that album... the songs were bland and too much in the vein of a lot of pop-emo groups.<br />But now, the group has returned with an album that combines the creativity and push/pull of past and future sounds from the first album, with the polished anthems of the second. Driving synths, pulsing drum beats, and hair-raising chants are seeded throughout the album, adding color and flavor to every track.<br />The two singles, Kings And Queens and This Is War, are the straight-forward rockers of the album. Less synth influence, a bit more U2-ish. Then there is the harder edged synth heavy tracks, Night of the Hunter, Closer to the Edge (the poppy-est track), Vox Populi (the choir heavy, militaristic track), and Search and Destroy (poppy, choir heavy, AND U2-ish). The surprising bits come from the moody Hurricane (with a spot-on auto-tuned Kanye), the Pretty Hate Machine influenced Stranger in a Strange Land, and the ballads, 100 Suns and Alibi.<br />This album shows 30STM in top form, stylistically, and musically. After the second release, I wasn't sure if I'd still be listening, but now I'm thankful that I still can.<br />Sidenote: Can people stop comparing Jared Leto to other \\"actors who think they're musicians\\"? I think after three albums and several world tours, he's proven that he's an actual musician. Thanks!
B001FB55HQ|2.0|Sometimes, you wonder when it's time to stop, and let a franchise die.  Or at the least, make sure the story is coherent and fits in well with what's come before.  But most importantly, try to give the story weight.  If we don't care about what's going on, pretty much nothing is going to save the film, and that's the problem with Terminator Salvation.    Taking place in 2018, the film follows the famed John Connor and newcomer Marcus Wright, as both men fight for their lives in the post-judgment day world.  Killer machines roam the skies and the ground.  While the resistance has found a possible way to shut down the machines for good, the fate of mankind hangs in the balance, as the legendary Kyle Reese, John's father, has been found.  The problem is, the machines are after him.  With both John and Skynet after Kyle, both sides must fight for the fate of the future.    When I first saw the movie in theaters, I left feeling that the film was, at best, an average action adventure movie.  After seeing it again on DVD, time has not been kind to \\"Salvation\\", as the story feels very disjointed and choppy, as if the film was hacked to pieces and then edited back together.  It feels like entire segments of the film are missing, and the second half of the film moves too quickly for us to get emotionally interested.  By the time the end credits rolled around, I just didn't care.  I didn't care about the characters, I didn't care about the story, or even the action.     This is probably Terminator Salvation's biggest problem...for all the action sequences, for all the nods to the previous films, the story is the weakest yet in the series.  While the idea of saving Kyle Reese to ensure the events of the future/past happen sounds like a great idea, having the film jump back and forth between Marcus and John makes it feel disjointed.  We don't get time to understand the characters in any meaningful way, besides the most basic of reasons.  John wants to save Kyle.  Marcus wants tofind out who he is.  Barnes wants to avenge his brother's offscreen death.  Kyle wants to stay alive.  As a result, we have a cast of essentially one dimensional characters that pale in comparison to the cast of the previous three films.  Some, like Star, are completely unnecessary and could have been cut from the script.    Say what you will about Terminator 3 (I personally really enjoyed it), but it had a focused plot that added to the franchise's mythology with the revelation that Judgment day was just postponed, not stopped.  The film had weight to it, making us wonder if the heroes were going to stop Judgement Day once again.  Here, everything is back to the status quo at the end.  There are no long term changes or consequences of the ongoing story.  There's just no emotional weight to what's going on, and coupled with the disjointed pacing and thin characters, the film feels utterly flat.  Considering how all the previous stories have at least contributed much to the ongoing story, \\"Salvation\\"'s story is a disappointment.    With the poor story and characters, we're left with the action sequences, and regrettably, they don't fare much better.  We have the standard chase scenes with cars, assaults on Skynet bases, and fights with killer robots, but most feel like your standard issue summer action scenes.  The nighttime escape scene in the forest, for example, is utterly flat, save for the sequence in the river.  Then there's the giant transformer like robot at the gas station...I thought it was goofy in the theater, and it's only worse in a second viewing.  Why not replace it with a giant Skynet tank instead?  Why not a whole group of T-600's out to capture human prisoners?  This giant just feels out of place here.      Yet, despite it's stumbling, \\"Salvation\\" does get a few things right.  The overall mood and art design of the film, with it's shades of greys, blacks, and blues, does an excellent job creating a post apocalyptic world, and I did like the idea of showing us what the war between man and machine looked like before the technology of lasers and time travel is created.  Sam Worthington does a good job of conveying the tough, yet confused Marcus, and Anton Yelchin is outstanding as a young Kyle Reese, and is easily the best actor of the film, making you believe that he really is a young version of Michael Biehn.  It's also a nice treat that Linda Hamilton returned to do voice overs for John's famous audio tapes.  The opening action sequence, an assault on a Skynet Base set amongst dozens of giant satellite dishes, is quite exciting.  But the best part of the film easily comes in the third act, with a cameo appearance by a well known character from the previous films...it's only after this character appears that the film finally becomes really interesting.    But in the end, \\"Salvation\\" is a disappointing entry into the Terminator franchise.  With it's weak story, weak characters, choppy pacing, and below average to average action sequences, there's really not much to recommend it here.  There are a few good action sequences, and a few good performances by the actors, but that's really it.  Terminator fans will probably get the most out of it, but everyone else should stick to the first three films.
B000F3AAUW|5.0|Good CD if you like the techno weird kind of music. Got it shipped quick. Overall, very satisfied.

B0029LHW68|1.0|Wow they spent 2 years in the studio recording this god awful cd? I have been a fan for a long time and I can say this is easily their worst album.     So many things that are so awful with this cd I just don't know. For one thing this album so poorly mixed. I've heard demo cds from unknown bands that were mixed better. The guitar work is extremely dissapionting. What guitars that actually exists on this cd, that aren't drowned out, are pretty average. So average I can't even remember one good riff used in any of the songs. Wait I do remember a good guitar part during Alibi.... but maybe cause it was the same exact little guitar riff used in The Story....yeeeaahh...     Escape, Hurricane and Stranger in a Strange Land are the only.... decent songs on it in my opinion, while the rest I have already forget what they sounded like. The fan vocals are horrible, over used, and have no business being on the cd. I didn't pay for a cd to listen to people who can't sing.     The new style is awful. They don't even sound like themselves anymore. Some songs sound like U2, some sound like Bon Jovi, one try's and fails miserably to b like NIN, one is a complete rip off of a MuteMath song, and almost ALL sound like could be used in a Disney film. Seriously hope they do not consider themselves Rock anymore cause this cd is nothing more then a techno pop cd Disney would put out. This band used to be so unique, now they sound like every other band you hear on the radio. This is about one step above a teenie bopper band.       Oh well, whats another 4 years of waiting eh? But then again if they put out another cd like this I would rather they not do anything at all. If this was a new band I was hearing for the first time I would think this is a decent cd, but coming from 30stm it's a huge dissapointment. Seems like someong soldout big time.
B001H122N4|5.0|The quality of sound & video is what you would expect from a Gilmour release, exceptional ! I have been a Floyd fan since 1968 and David just gets better, this is ,I think, the best recording in my collection of about 50 Floyd/Gilmour CD's but the main reason I bought it is that it is Rick Wright's last performance of Echoes (the best song ever made) and you should not miss it.

Read it and then read this review. :)<br /><br />City of Glass left us with one H E C K of a cliffhanger.  I was literally left reeling. Yet, even though I was fascinated with the world that Clare had created, I didn't rush out and buy the second one.

There was just a lot of nonsense in this novel. Simon and Clary's relationship was focused on a lot, even though it was completely unbelievable.  Clary was only \\"pretending\\" at a relationship.  There was no emotion there.  The only time she showed real emotion to Simon was when he was on the verge of dying.  When he was alive and well - she just seemed annoyed with him.<br /><br />Also the \\"bad guys\\" are just a little too much.  The vast armies of Valentine were just over the top.  Swarms and swarms - how in the world were they to defeat this?  The Inquisitor's actions were also very unbelievable. The Inquisitor acted like a complete loon.  L-O-O-N spells unrealistic. Both Valentine and the Inquisitor are unwavering in their stubborn beliefs - arguing and pleading did nothing to waver them - so all the logic battles that Clary, Jace, Alec & Isabelle fought with them was just hot air.<br /><br />Oh and where did Maia go???

0307593525|5.0|There are very few books that have had such a profound effect on their field.  This book set is transformative - you will never view cooking food the same way again.  I grew up watching Julia Child on my local PBS affiliate with no idea that she was anything other than a local cooking talent with a strange affect.  After college, I found a copy of volume one in a used book store and can hear her voice in every recipe, stage of directions, and sage advice.<br />After many years, my family loves her beef stew - a regular dinner in our home.  I despised French Onion soup growing up, but after following her directions it is my favorite.<br />One criticism of this book is the production.  After many years of publishing technology improvements, the lack of photos to explain some butchery techniques makes this set a bit dated if you expect visual guides to some steps.  Be patient, re-read, and have confidence.  These are spectacular dishes made with simple techniques that even someone who grew up on canned soup and boxed dinners figured out.<br />If I was trapped on a remote island with only one cooking instructional resource, then this would be my choice.  Everything else is a far distant second place.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|This is an excellent five star movie.  The climax is stunning.  The characters well played. The story of a man falsely convicted who never gives up.  A wonderful couple of hours entertainment for the price.

B00005JMX6|4.0|While Elisha Cuthbert is \\"only\\" the love interest and doesn't have the lead role, her talent overshadows all the other performances and is in a different league. As a whole, the film is well acted, well directed and has a polished feel to it. But a silly premise and a storyline riddled with obvious logical gaps take the movie down to a two star level. What rescues this movie from mediocrity is Ms. Cuthbert's performance. Her acting range is amazing, making her an American version of Audrey Tautou, who's been credible in an stunning variety of roles. From cynical, bitter, trapped porn star to love-touched girl friend, Ms. Cuthbert takes each of her scenes to five stars. It's not her pretty body that lingers in the mind, but her evocative facial expressions. I hope she finds a path to mainstream Hollywood, which she richly deserves. Emile Hirsch is a good actor stuck with a challenging part and he manages some chemistry with Ms. Cuthbert, but he isn't in the same league. So why watch the movie? For the chance to see Elisha Cuthbert turn in a performance comparable to a legend like Barbara Stanwyck, who elevated many a corny B movie to A level, by virtue of her acting skills. Without Ms. Stanwyck, Double Indemnity would be a strange curiousity instead of film noir virtuosity. Elisha Cuthbert has the same level of raw talent.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Well i watched the HBO series on TV every sunday so naturaly i bought the first season and soon the second. It is a great show about sookie stakhouse a waitress in bon tomp.

I would suggest this if you like vampires plus other super naturals.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|In books, I'm always skipping the backstory because it drags down the pace. Yet J.J. Abrams has made an entire movie out of the backstory of how Kirk, Spock, et. al. came to be on the bridge of the Enterprise - and he maintains a blinding pace from the opening moments to the ending as it rolls to credits. Better yet, Abrams weaves a ton of character conflict, personalities and tension into what could have been yet another blitzkrieg of CGI effects.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|It is sometimes a strech with the black hole timewrap thing. Well, you have to suspend reason for a bit there anyway, but by and large a great movie. I thought the actors did a good job of protraying their characters and the story was usually fast paced and interesting. I'll watch the next one, should there be a next one.
B000K1P66W|5.0|This is a great book. Two days i was done, once you start you don't want to put it down. Makes so much sense. I gave it to a friend to read as well.
0385504225|3.0|First off let me say that the story is captivating and the subject matter interesting.  A very fast past read.  HOWEVER:<br />(I'm going to try not having a spoiler but just in case, you may not want to read further.)  This book contained the worst characters ever written in fictional literature.  Especially Robert Langdon.  I must say that his skepticism in the story was tying and sickening;  I mean come-on.  Your are Robert Langdon.  What have you been doing in the past two books?  Dealing with antimatter, church vs. science, finding decedents for Jesus and so many fantastic and outrageous situations that we love so much.  In this book however, he does not believe anything to be possible.  What happened, did Dan Brown murder your sense of adventure.  Furthermore, he became the wimpiest character of all time,  God bless Falstaff.  If I were to give Mr. Tom Hanks any advise I'd tell him not to do this movie for the sake of his career.  Mr. Brown please don't feel as if you need to commercialize yourself to win audiences, you already had us at 'Da Vinci Code.'  What we (at least I) loved about you was your controversial sense of adventure and set of brass balls.  It seems as if you are softening up and tried to please certain groups (you know who I mean.)<br />This next comment may be a SPOILER:<br />I'm confused;  if I had a friend who was in danger and all I had to do was decipher something I did not believe in<br />(because I'm such an skeptic)  to save him, I'D DO IT; not argue with terrorist about how untrue it is and I won't do it because it is not true:<br />me:  I won't do it it's not real,<br />terrorist:  decipher the code and your friend will be safe.<br />me: but it's not true.<br />terrorist: all you have to do to save your friend is decipher the code for me.<br />me: but nothing will come out of it.  It's impossible.
B000UOGHKS|5.0|Looking back it's hard not to notice, that this cd was completely overlooked by almost everybody. Critics told it off, customers refused to buy.<br />But true art defends itself. This is one of the best albums Madonna has ever created. Both musically and lirically.<br />The best cuts here are without doubt: \\"Erotica\\", \\"Bad girl\\", \\"Thief of hearts\\", \\"Words\\" and beautiful \\"In this life\\".<br />The closing \\"Secret garden\\" is the most jazzy track M has ever sung! And \\"Deeper and...\\" benefits in some parts from her earlier hits - both \\"La isla bonita\\" and \\"Vogue\\".<br />This is Madonna, at her best.
B002XHN776|5.0|I know that a lot of people are skeptical of this band, simply because of who is in it, but this album is something that will blow you away. The band covers different sounds and techniques that they've only teased us with before. It incorporates deeper, touching lyrics. When vocalist Jared Leto sings about pain, you can *hear* it. When he questions, you can't help but answer back. Starting from the almost eerie beginning of \\"Escape\\" and keeping you captive until its end, \\"L490\\" (which is a beautiful, haunting melody written and mostly performed by drummer Shannon Leto), \\"This is War\\" is an album that will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|I listened to the Thriller album as a child and loved it.  I had a CD but it was missed placed.  I kept putting off buying one until now.  LOVE THIS ALBUM!!!!
B000056HUA|3.0|Although the DVD-Audio is better than the equivalent CD the difference is not great.Some surround implementation is ok and helps but subjective audio quality as hi res disc is simply not there.  For Doors fans the DVD-A is probably worth it but for anyone interested in improved audio through the hi resolution format this does not compare with the better examples out there.
B01BUX7Z6M|4.0|This is one of their heaviest and most aggressive albums from before the days they souled out. Every metal fan should have this.
B001GCUNWQ|4.0|This third installment of the Ice Age series is another great film for the whole family to enjoy.  It is filled with action, adventure, and a lot of laughs.  Both of our girls (ages 6 and 3) love all of the Ice Age movies, and this one was no exception.  I would definitely recommend it.
0061914177|5.0|There's no doubt that social media is a must in any business today, but the volume of what is possible is so overwhelming and can be expensive that it can get very frustrating and a bit disconcerting. I think I found Gary's book, Crush It, at just the right time. The book speaks to those who are simply considering going out on their own in a new business venture with guidance for how and why they may want to make that decision but also speaks to those who are knee deep into their dream. I, for example, know my passion, my message, my platform and my \\"DNA\\"! I needed \\"Crush It\\" for the validation, confirmation, and the direction to keep at it.<br /><br />\\"Crush It\\" is a valuable guide for anyone who is going to navigate the world of social marketing. If you are just beginning, Gary will save you oodles of hours trying figure out where to get started as he identifies the most effective social media to date and the most effective way to use that social media. If you are already knee-deep in your venture, as I am, you'll get right back on track, learn the latest tricks, the new social media on the horizon and find the direction you need to stay focused.<br /><br />Gary's \\"Crush It\\" has given me validation - I know I am on the right track - my marketing plan matches his marketing plan (you have to read the book to know what marketing plan I am talking about.) It has given me confirmation - yes, I was right, in order to do the things I need to do, it's going to take every speck of time I have and many late nights. For many of us delving into the social media world for the first time, we quickly realize how much time we spend sometimes writing just one comment, for example. We start to think, this is taking forever, are we doing this right? You bet, Gary says. (I don't know if Gary actually says the words \\"you bet\\" but you get my point.) It's all about \\"hustle\\" and it does indeed take time.<br /><br />Finally, I needed some direction. I feel like sometimes I am all over the place. What is really important to address? Gary provides a map to keep you on target and on point. I especially like Gary's theory that following too many analytics can be unproductive - I feel the same way but reading him say it has lifted a weight!The book is very easy to read on understands and does a good job of weeding things out, which I suspect this guy is all about. It's a real breath of fresh air.important to address? Gary provides a map to keep you on target and on point.

B000KJT8IG|5.0|I watched Christmas Vacation and was amaze how clear it looks and heard sounds I never have on the DVD. I then watch the DVD version and it looked faded unlike the blu-ray just watch the scene when they find a Christmas tree at the beginning of the movie the spot light on the tree from heaven is so clear and bright it like they just made the movie.    Also on the DVD you see black spots from old film at times through out the movie with the blu-ray you get none of that.    If this is you favorite Christmas movie like it is for me then blu-ray is a must. If you are buying for extras then you are going to be disappointed. They did get a handful of stars to talk about the movie. However no deleted scenes etc. They put the trailer on it *wow like who cares*
B0000004UB|5.0|It's a blast to the past 80's style with this CD. It was a joy to hear it sound better than ever before on CD after growing up with it on tape. I love it!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|As a huge sci-fi fan, I have always been at least vaguely familiar with all the conventional sci-fi shows out there.  So when I had three friends describe Firefly to me as \\"the greatest sci-fi show ever,\\" I was naturally skeptical, as I had never even previously heard of it.  After doing a little research and seeing the overwhelmingly positive reviews here on amazon, I decided $30 was worth the risk.  Believe me when I say that it was worth it 100%.  Firefly is possibly the most underappreciated show out there- and I know that's saying a lot with the huge cult fan base.  This show was a work of genius.  Everything about it was just so refreshing.  After DS9, BSG, TNG, B5 and other sci-fi shows that more or less look the same on the outside, you can't imagine how refreshing it was for me to see a sci-fi show that was so wildly original.  Most sci-fi shows are based on the premise that in the future, mankind will have advanced, and everything will be different.  The genius of Firefly come from the fact that it is based in a future universe that is more or less the same as ours.  Sure, we've moved forward in time, but as the saying goes, \\"the more things change, the more they stay the same.\\"<br /><br />Besides this, the writing is absolutely fantastic, the characters interesting (and funny!), the acting suberb, and the stories interesting and engaging.  The only downside is that the whole series didn't even last an entire season.  History may very well prove the premature cancellation of Firefly to be a greater blunder than Napoleon's invasion of Russia.  Firefly is television storytelling at its finest.  Give it a shot.  You won't regret it.
B002JIOQCO|5.0|Another incredible album that seems from a different time, past and future. Tracks like 10,000 Feet and California Queen just boggle the mind. I keeps finding myself saying \\"they sound like...\\" but then I can't figure out who they sound like. I guess they sound like Wolfmother.

B00004BZ0N|5.0|If you're interested enough to have looked up this album on Amazon, then you are the kind of person that MUST own this record.  I used to think this was a great album that kind of ran out of steam towards the end.  I was wrong. The is a flat-out masterpiece that doesn't have a weak SECOND, let alone song.  The invention is astonishing. This is not a punk album; they had evolved way beyond that.  This is simply one of the greatest albums of popular music that will ever be recorded.
0446528056|5.0|I usually like books a little steamier and with a happy ending, I'll be honest.  But this was such a good story!  I found the writing flowed very smoothly.  Sometimes you read a story and the descriptions are too lengthy or boring and you find yourself skimming over it to get back to the good stuff, but that wasn't the case with this book.  I have seen his movies but this was the first book of his I've read, I'll be checking out his others for sure!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|This was the best docu-movie I seen in a long EVER!!!! When Michael died, I couldn't believe it. To this day, I still have not fully accepted his death because it's a hard pill to swallow. June 25, 2009 will always be embedded into my memory because it was the day I lost my icon. Hats off to Kenny Ortega for giving us this movie. He did an excellent job putting this movie together for us. Michael was a genius!!! It saddens me that Michael never got to perform this creation in front of a live audience because it would have been an awesome show. It saddens me more that he is no longer with us.    R.I.P MJ... <3 4ever.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This was the first Blu-ray disc we have owned, which we purchased to try on our new PS3.  The visual quality of this movie in Blu-ray format is amazing!  We don't have surround-sound set up, so I can't comment on that aspect of the disc, but even in 2.1 stereo the movie sounded great.  If you enjoyed this movie at the theater then I would say this is a good addition to your home movie collection.

B0029LHW68|5.0|With the release of their third album, This is War, 30 Seconds to Mars has once and for all shirked their reputation as an \\"angst\\" band. It could instead be argued that, while the wounds of their battle with Virgin Records are evident in their latest release, they instead offer themselves as healthy role models for listeners, channeling their frustration and suffering into songs of hope, optimism, and strength.    \\"I fell apart but I got back up again,\\" Jared Leto croons in \\"Alibi\\", first in a soothing tone evocative of a lullaby, later soaring to a cry that is both anguished and exultant. This sentiment of determination and healing echoes throughout the album.    It's rare for me to like an album the first time I hear it. I've always found comfort in familiarity; usually new songs have to \\"grow\\" on me. But it was love at first listen for This is War. It's the kind of music you can listen to with your eyes closed and see the sun rise; the kind of music you blast with the car's windows rolled down; the kind you sing along to with the enthusiasm of a fevered tent-revival disciple. This album gives you chills from its first notes.    As if it were even possible to do so, following the release of their platinum-selling second album, A Beautiful Lie, the talented men of 30 Seconds to Mars have continued to improve their musical aptitude, producing a more polished and innovative album than the previous two. (Note that I do NOT mean more \\"mainstream\\" - despite their producer Flood's experience with renowned bands such as U2, Depeche Mode, and The Smashing Pumpkins, they continue to admirably deviate from the flow of \\"pop\\" music.) One example of their musical pioneering would be the choral accompaniments to many of the songs: the uplifting chants heard in the background of such songs as the title track (also featured in the game Dragon Age: Origins), \\"Night of the Hunter\\", and \\"Hurricane\\" are actually the voices of 30 Seconds to Mars' fans, recorded earlier this year in a \\"digital summit\\" (just one of many ways the band incorporates its \\"army\\" into the music). These full-bodied compositions will undoubtedly play well in the acoustics of a large venue.    This Is War also contains more of the smoky, sexy, whispered vocals that particularly send Leto's admirers swooning. Because of this, the album will likely perform well in an intimate, acoustic setting. Regardless of the site, This Is War seems destined for live performance greatness.    Overall, 30 Seconds to Mars has used their strife to demonstrate unparalleled poise and grace, and the result is an album with more depth and intensity than I've experienced in a long time.

0061689246|3.0|Stardust is a fast paced fantasy with engaging characters and plot.  This novel is not part of a series which is a nice change from most fantasy books where exactly no time has passed in the first 100 pages.  However, I thought the character development wasn't in depth enough for me to really care about the characters.  Instead, I was merely amused by them and didn't worry too much if they reached their goals or not.<br /><br /> The story is about Tristran (a name which looks nice but I stuttered over the extra \\"r\\" every time) a teenager whose mother was from Faerie, a place of magic outside the town of Wall that he lives in.  He decides he is in love with the most beautiful girl in Wall, Victoria Forester, and she promises to give him anything he desires if he brings her a fallen star.  He sets out on this quest with no hesitation but he is not the only one searching for the star.<br /><br /> The character of Tristran was bland.  He decided he was so in love with Victoria (from what I could tell just because she was pretty) that he'll do anything for her.  When he finds out part of that is kidnapping he doesn't really notice or care.  I can't describe his personality because he hardly had one and Yvaine must have fallen for him for lack of a better option.  Yvaine was a good character in that she wasn't the typical damsel in distress and until the end, thought Tristran was a bit of a twit.  The supporting cast was quirky and the magic, inventive.  I would recommend this book if you want a quick, mostly light-hearted fun read.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|I've done extensive research on the \\"perfect\\" survival/wilderness knife. A survival knife should be well-made, reliable, and versatile. You may want to carry a smaller knife in addition to this one for fine work, but the BK2 Becker Campanion, now produced by Ka-Bar, can do everything from chopping wood to cleaning game. One very noteworthy feature is this beast is a quarter-inch thick! I am very confident that this knife will never break (without abuse of course). In an urban setting, it could probably be used as a pry bar. It also weighs around 1 lb. It isn't as long as some other great knives out there, but this weight makes up for it with its heft. Like another reviewer said, the moment I took it out of the box and held it in my hand, I knew that I had made a good decision. People have different opinions when it comes to knives, but I personally love this knife and feel that I'll never need another survival/wilderness knife now that I have the Ka-Bar BK2 Becker Campanion. And, I know that I'm not the only one who feels this way.
159448385X|5.0|I didn't think I could read a book that would make me love the story as much as 'The Kite Runner' but I did.<br /><br />Khaled Hosseini  is one of the best writers I have ever come across. His writing style is simple, but filled with such amazing detail and emotion. I have never ever felt so much compassion towards characters in books and such hatred.<br /><br />The story itself is filled with lots of twist and turns. Make sure that you have a tough heart when reading this, cause it pulls at every heart string.<br /><br />Amazing book. If you loved 'The Kite Runner' You will love this.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I hesitated to title this review as \\"...Small Survival Blade,\\" because I couldn't do it without laughing to myself. This knife is a beast. At 1/4\\" thick, you'd be hard-pressed to find something it can't handle. The cutting edge is nearly the same length as the longer Cold Steel SRK, and the BK-2 blade is about 1.5 times as wide. The handles feel great in hand, and you can get a really solid grip on it. All in all, this is a solid knife. I would put it up against just about anything. It's bigger and badder than you think.
0375842209|2.0|I really don't see what all the fuss about this book is about. I must be reading something different to what everyone else is.<br /><br />Did I think it was a good book? Yes but did I think it was the best book as some claim, or life changing as the cover says? No<br /><br />There are some great moments in the book, but they don't last long enough or so memorable compared to other moments in books to make it amazing.<br /><br />The main character is beautiful, you feel compassion for her instantly, along with a lot of the characters in the book too. I cant flaw that. Its a book where I nearly liked every character, however the story for me was just a little dull.
B001L2COFK|5.0|It certainly passes my discerning taste for his music.  Thanks, Amazon.  I can always count on you.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I thought this was a pretty good movie.  Some parts seemed kind of silly but other than that it is full of action and it was cool to see the characters come together.  I'm not too sure about Uhura and Spock being \\"at item\\", that was sort of strange.  I totally recommend this movie to action movie and Star Trek fans.

I wanted the CD, if I have ordered it through AMAZON per-say..cost a couple of bucks more though---I'd be happy playing my CD.<br /><br />I have read allot from the seller in-feedbacks it's a real problem that they take \\"A LONG TIME\\" seems to be the case with me as well.<br /><br />***MY QUESTION IS WHERE IS MY DARN PRODUCT FOLKS!!!<br /><br />OH, and they don't even respond to emails either, good luck if you deal with them, it's spin the bottle. I will give a full comment on Alanis \\"WHEN I GET MY CD\\".<br /><br />But I will say this album rocks, the words are deep and her style of singing is original. Allot of mid-tempos, catchy phrases, my favs., are \\"You Learn\\"..\\"Ironic\\"..\\"Hand In My pocket\\"...once you play these and others on the CD, you will be singing along having a Alanis experience. Okay, I guess I gave a review...ha-ha-ha.<br />The seller still sucks, GIVE ME MY ORDER, YOU GOT MY MONEY OR RETURN MY MONEY!!!!!!!!!!

1594201749|4.0|Big rugby fan so I wanted to read the book before Invictus hit the big screen.  Thought it brought Mandela's tight rope walk with the white separatists to life quite well.  I happened to be lucky enough to have traveled in SA for almost 3 weeks in 1995 post Rugby World Cup and remember the energy and positive attitude people had!
B001F0VHEM|3.0|I've always been a fan of Pink, but I must be the only person that didn't like [[ASIN:B001F0VHEM I'm Not Dead]]. It wasn't a terrible album, but I just didn't think it was as great as everyone made it out to be. Still, I picked up her latest album, Funhouse.<br /><br />This is another one of those cases where the best songs are the first two singles: \\"So What\\" and \\"Sober\\". But those are also the album's first two tracks, which might make some worry that the album goes downhill for there; fortunately, highlights continue with the two acoustic tracks, \\"Crystal Ball\\" and \\"Glitter in the Air\\". \\"Please Don't Leave Me\\" is also easy to relate to even though the lyrics aren't the best.<br /><br />There are also a few throwaway tracks, like the title track and especially \\"Bad Influence\\". And \\"Mean\\" is passable. Everything else is okay. Pink is still a hell of a singer but Funhouse isn't quite as exciting as maybe it could have been. B.I.F.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Some cats at my workplace told me this was good. They played it for me and I was hooked. It is a nice mix of electronics and rock music. The groove of the music is catchy and the sound is alluring. i recommend it. I have heard other albums by them which are good as well. I do not think they have anything that is bad.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This is not just for kids.  It is a great story of relationships, compassion and sacrifice.  Graphics are spectacular.  I highly recommend.
B000002MY3|5.0|Her vocals have a unique fresh sound. Her lyrics have cool analogies. The music is good and catchy but at least it has substance unlike many pop rock albums. I'm going to check out her other albums as well. This was an enjoyable listening experience.
0385532458|5.0|I have read all of Grisham's books and I enjoy his easy style voice in writing.  This collection of short stories is as good as anything he has written.  I liked the short story format that starts fast and takes you right into the action and then soon comes to a terrific climax.  I also enjoy how each story is from the same county in the south but covers so many different types of people.  Very well done and definitely worth your time and money.
B000002AVF|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite albums. Mariah's voice is impressive to say the least. The music is interesting, the bass is heavy and teh beats are thumping and the vocals are perfect. This is my favorite album of her's although the self titled is a close second. I enjoy it alot more than her later albums. She displays her amazing vocal range and has lyrics I can relate to. Check it out for yourself.
B000ZELISO|1.0|This is not a review of the movie, but rather of the poor job Warner Home Video has done with the Blu-ray video transfer.  There are horizontal bands visible in various scenes throughout the movie.  They are not constantly visible, but appear primarily in scenes where there are large areas of darkness - though of course that means they are visible in quite a few scenes of this very dark movie.  The bands are not being produced by my player - I can see them on all three of my Blu-ray players, including my PS3 and two computers with Blu-ray drives.  The bands are part of the image and are visible when the movie is freeze-framed.  I recommend that those considering a purchase refrain from buying this disc until and unless a replacement is offered by Warner Home Video.  I own over 200 Blu-ray discs, and this is the first time I have seen this issue on any transfer.  It is obvious to me that this disc was mastered incorrectly.
B00000FFLI|5.0|This is bar none one of the greatest albums ever. The bass guitarist has real skills at playing his instrument. The vocalist has a beautiful voice with a good range. She is never off key either like many pop singers. Her voice is perfect in every way shape and form. This band is one of the most talented groups I have ever heard. The song structers, the lyrics and the music. Everything! Check this out and you should be pleasently surprised. It is really good.
B0029LHW68|5.0|Would it live up to the mastery of \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" or would it fall short? That's what was on my mind when I heard about the release of the new CD. \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" is one of my favorite CDs and I worried \\"This is War\\" would not come close to the same level. No need to worry! It tells a story, gets you pumped up and was well worth the wait.     I just downloaded the songs this morning and there are a few stand outs: Kings + Queens, Escape, Vox Populi and Stranger in a Strange Land.     The is a \\"pop\\" element to a couple of the tracks. Diehard 30 Seconds to Mars fans may balk at what they consider the commercialization of the CD, but this CD contains so many components, there's something for everyone. I'm not sure why it's classified on iTunes as \\"pop\\". It's more Alternative to me.     There are strains of U2 and My Chemical Romance in a few of the tracks, but the essence of the CD is pure 30 Seconds to Mars.
B0002EXH54|5.0|A classic metal album with cool guitar solos and jazzy rythms underneith the heavy chords. Angry snarling vocals and insane bass, drums and dark lyrics with substance. Megadeths best album and my personal favorite. The new album \\"Endgame\\" is awesome as well.

I didn't feel that my fiancee and I had any major issues, and I still don't feel that. But we still benefitted from this book.<br /><br />We found that we actually have the same love language. Though I doubt he'll ever actually read the book, I've discussed it with him and he said that he likes the ideas in the book as well.<br /><br />So, in my opinion, even if your relationship isn't in trouble, it's still a good idea to get this book. It might help you understand your spouse (and yourself) better.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I feel pretty stupid about this, but I also feel I owe Amazon this post, in case anyone else thinks their DVD is defective.<br /><br />I saw Star Trek twice in a theater and pre-ordered the DVD. I LOVE this movie. I saw the original show when first broadcast and all the other movies, and, miraculously, this is better. The entire cast, but particularly Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto, are remarkable; the plot is extremely well constructed; and the production design is striking.<br /><br />HOWever, on DVD there were flares of light and colored streaks across the screen, many of which had NO relation to what was going on in the scene. It was driving me crazy, nearly unwatchable at times. I told Amazon the disk was defective, so they sent me a new one. Meanwhile I watched it again with the commentary on, in which it was mentioned that JJ Abrams would flash lights at the cameras during filming to get flares -- to add motion! Like they needed to! Like there was a sedate shot in the whole movie!<br /><br />Well, as I said, I saw it twice on the big screen and never noticed the lights, but on a smaller screen, all those extraneous visual effects are maddeningly distracting. I hope JJ Abrams and these writers make many more of these movies, but that Abrams has enough faith in what he's doing not to feel he has to tart it up with these stupid effects.<br /><br />So don't send the disk back to Amazon! That's the way it is, for better or worse.
0061122416|2.0|The Alchemist is a simple story of a young shepherd who is trying to find what his purpose in life is. Called \\"the boy\\" by the author, the young man is put on a path to his purpose by some strategically placed meetings with key figures. This purpose is known as a Personal Legend. The idea is that all people are born into this world to realize their Personal Legends but few actually get there because they let age and circumstance get in the way. People make choices that cause them to forget their dreams; the result is an unhappy life of longing for what ifs.<br /><br />This book raises more questions than answers for me and, in the end, there is much I don't understand. The main message is universal: There is a greater power out there that created us in love and you must discover your purpose in life so that you bring as much joy to others as possible; for it is in giving joy to others that we bring the most joy to ourselves. The more we love the closer we become to that greater power. The greater power is God. That is the easy part.<br /><br />The harder part was keeping Personal Legends, learning to speak the Language of the World, and interpreting the Soul of the World all from jumbling up in my mind. Then there is the alchemist part--which talks about alchemy being the study of attaining your spiritual treasures as well as the evolution of objects and the turning of matter into gold. Oy! Basically the alchemists just want a more complex way of looking at the same things that the heart does in simpler terms. The more sophisticated the better, but the idea is that whatever you subscribe to the results are always the same.<br /><br />By the end of the book, we find our boy speaking to the sun and the wind and the author has absolutely lost me. It's obvious he found his own spiritual nirvana, but I just couldn't relate. So, I decided to go back to enjoying the story for what it was and not dwelling so much on the mumbo jumbo.<br /><br />This book is similar to the Celestine Prophecy in that is sort of a blueprint for attaining a higher sense of spirituality. Coelho says that destiny is myth and that you an change things if you want it bad enough. Yet, he contradicts himself by introducing the idea of Maktub, which means \\"it is written\\". Well, if it's written, how am I going to change it? He also says that the universe will strive to give you what you want if you want it bad enough. But what if what I want hurts others? How can that be a good thing in seeking my Personal Legend? As I said, much more questions than answers for me.<br /><br />B- read.sort of a blueprint for attaining a higher sense of spirituality.

1400063515|2.0|I had really high hopes that this book would present the idea of the black swan with clarity and guidance of how to incorporate it into life and work. I was disappointed. Reading it made me feel like I was bombarded with a bunch of little ramblings that had no relation to the subject at hand. Maybe a sentence or two would finally appear to jolt my brain into seeing why the rambling was presented in the first place.    The \\"technical\\" chapters really had nothing technical in them that helped. I am a mathematician and was looking for someone who speaks my language to teach me something new and different, but I just got more prose and one little descriptive formula. I believe the whole book could have been condensed into a ten page pamphlet and conveyed the same information. I really hope that this topic is taken up by someone again because it is very important since this book just didn't meet my expectations.
0786868724|5.0|I enjoyed the book and I can see how people think it's vapid because it starts off with a man asking Mitch to write his eulogy and (spoiler alert!) it ends with him writing a eulogy. I just enjoyed some of the ideas I could pull from their conversations. If you like fiction and just like to take a story as it is and not reflect on your own life and choices you have made, yes this book may not be the best choice.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This is the perfect gift for my sister and brother-in-law. (I'll probably borrow it - love this show!)
B0029LHW68|2.0|I now have to think twice now about wearing my 30STM t-shirt. Outside of disappointment, I am more baffled and can't fathom what went horribly wrong. Seems like Jared ran out of ideas and blew his entire artistic load on A Beautiful Lie. Going back to whispering vocals is just plain dumb. Putting a crowd of voices into songs is even dumber. This release is laughable and harder to swallow than Chester's Dead By Sunrise. If you want to hear good music, try the band 'The Big Pink'.
B001JNNE64|1.0|I'm in agreement with many others who have reviewed the Director's Cut - the added footage ruins the flow of the movie and coherence of the characters.    I love the theatrical release of this movie, and I'm very disappointed that they chose not to include the theatrical release in this blu-ray set.  Amadeus is a gorgeous film, and I would very much like to enjoy the original in hi-def splendor.    As of now it's a choice between watching a pretty movie and a good movie.  I'll be watching my old DVD theatrical version until they release it on Blu-Ray.  Watching the blu-ray directors cut equates to wasting 3 hours getting mad about what they did to an excellent movie.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This woman continuously amazes me with the purity of her voice.  She never forces her notes and sings the songs as if she had written them.

B0026C597O|5.0|This is the first of the \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" books, and it's easy to see why it sold over eleven million copies and spawned a cottage industry.  For it is an easy and fun yet highly informative book filled with more shrewd observations, common sense,  uncommon wisdom, and good advice than you're likely to find anywhere else.  And the contrast between the conventional thinking of the author's highly educated POOR DAD and the uncommon wisdom of his best friend's poorly educated, yet much wiser, RICH DAD is quite telling.    Here is a sampling of that wisdom:     The poor and the middle class work for money.  The rich have money work for them.  Most people, given more money, only get into more debt.  Most people live their lives chasing paychecks, pay raises and job security because of the emotions of desire and fear.  A job is only a short-term solution to a long-term problem.  If you want to be rich, you need to be financially literate.  The rich acquire assets and the poor and middle class acquire liabilities.  Wealth is a person's ability to survive so many number of days forward. . . or if I stopped working today, how long could I survive?  The poor only have expenses.  The middle class buys liabilities they think are assets.  They [the middle-class] spend their lives minding someone else's business and making that person rich.  Once a dollar goes into it [your assets], never let it come out.  An employee with a safe, secure job, without financial aptitude, has no escape.  In school we learn that mistakes are bad, and we are punished for making them.  Yet, if you look at the way humans are designed to learn, we learn by making mistakes.  The most important specialized skills are sales and understanding marketing.  If you have little money and you want to be rich, you must first be \\"focused,\\" not \\"balanced.\\"  Do not do what poor and middle class people do: put their few eggs in many baskets.  Busy people are often the most lazy.  Be a little greedy.  It's the bestcure for laziness.  Don't listen to poor or frightened people.  Be true to yourself and be willing to not go along with the crowd.  For in the market, it is usually the crowd that shows up late and is slaughtered.  Wise investors must look at more than ROI [return on investment]; it's the assets you get for free once you get your money back.  That is financial intelligence.  The idea that it takes money to make money is the thinking of financially unsophisticated people.    I was so impressed with this book that I bought copies for each of my children and encouraged them to read it. For it puts into words what many older people likely sensed as they worked their lives away, but were never able to see quite clearly.  Younger working stiffs, professionals, and small business owners would spare themselves a lot of grief if they would read this book and follow its precepts.  Seven or eight stars anyone?
B001AVCFJM|3.0|I've been on the fence with this movie for a while now, some days i like watching it others i'm just confused as to why? Why would J.J. Abrams do this? He's a Star Wars fan, thats why. This is not the star trek that trek fans know but a fresh new one with some pros and cons.    I'll get to the movie in just one second but I have to say this 2 disc DVD was garbage. It had so little from what it promised, the deleted scenes should have stayed deleted and off the DVD. I have to say I did kinda like watching the casting and making of the movie, you can definitely who they put more thought into and who they didn't and it showed in the movie(ahem Uhura...the only positive thing they said was how pretty she was) everyone else got an acting praise. Moving along..    The casting of the movie was hit and miss for me. The characters of Bones (Karl Urban) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) were played briliantly. They were able to really portray the original characters we originally loved, you can tell they did their homework. I know some people had been complaining about the arrogance portrayed by Chris Pine as Capt. Kirk but given the alternate reality/time travel and the fact they're young cadets, its understandable. I've loved John Cho (Sulu) since Better Luck Tomorrow so I was extremely happy to see him play Sulu. He recognized the importance George Takei had on the asian community and do it justice in my opinon. Hopefully next movie he'll have a stronger role. Simon Pegg as Scottie was hilarious and brough some much needed humor to the movie. Unfortunately he showed up when the movie was almost over. Eric Bana as Nero, was the hero you wanted to love, he had this crazy psychotic emotion that worked really well with Nero's personality.  My one big disappointment was Zoe Saldana as Uhura...really? Yes, she's pretty to look at (i guess) but her acting was terrible, she's was this annoying, whiny, unnecessarily thin actress running around. That's the best you can come up with to reprise the role of Nichelle Nichols? Ugh.     Spock and Uhura romance...it took two of my favorite characters and put them in a romantic relationship. Why did they feel the need to do this? How come almost all movies have to have some side romance going on? Its friggin star trek, we don't care!     The storyline was okay, it wasn't great, and at times I found myself lost because the scenes kept bouncing back and forth with no transition. Honestly, I could do without the whole changing of time thing. Graphics were amazing, a ton of crashing metal and loud noises (seemed like Transformers)with dramatic background music. I don't feel like going into finding all the discrepancies and little things, there are a ton of other reviews here which do that each one of them logical :) If you're able to just sit back and watch the movie, its not too bad. Took me watching it twice to realize that though. It is action packed, with enough movement to keep you occupied. It is a summer blockbuster movie and not necessarily a Star Trek movie.
B0026P3G12|5.0|After watching Susan Boyle's inspired and perfect performance of \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" I became an instant fan.  Her clear, crystal voice is expressed with feeling and incredible versatility.  Susan's range, dynamics and artistic interpretation will bring listeners much enjoyment on this very impressive first CD.  While some of the tracks may seem to be suprising choices (such as Daydream Believer - an old Monkees hit and Wild Horses by the Rolling Stones) as interpreted and sung by Susan Boyle they are beautiful and fresh, and put her voice to its best advantage.  In addition to the title track, my personal favorite songs are:  You''ll See, Who I Was Born to Be, Daydream Believer (YES!) Amazing Grace, and Silent Night.  Susan Boyle fans will love this first CD and I hope there will be many more to come.  It's too late for this year but I'd love to hear Susan compile a CD of Christmas favorites for hext year.  Lovely voice, beautiful work.  5 Stars.
B001AVCFK6|4.0|Some reviews are exceedingly wordy, but hit details in the head.  Here's an executive summary review for the busy shopper.<br /><br />The blu-ray transfer has been reviewed here extensively, and I not only concur its stellar, but its a showcase for your home theater.  Since the movie was built with state of the art 2008 technology, it would be fitting the home theater transfer should be superb in audio and video.  The video is super sharp, and details from the Enterprise to deep space are among the best in deep space FX.  The audio imaging is 5.1 and exceptional, as laser fire and ships move in different directions through the soundscape.<br /><br />As a movie, Star Trek 2009 does less to develop its characters, and prefers to wow audiences with stunts, effects and likely relies on the legacy of prior Treks to explain the quirks of Kirk and his company.  The remake of Battlestar Gallactica spent a lot of time on its characters and generated a long run and loyal following, but without it the reimangined ST2009 risks the fate that befell the later episodes of The Matrix, Star Wars or Indiana Jones.<br /><br />I rented this disk, but will not own it.
B001FB55HQ|4.0|Taking the advice from some people here, I found the 2-disc with a few extras at Target. Apparently Target has the exclusive deal on this. The movie is the \\"Director's Cut\\" with slight variations to the theatrical version. There is no commentary track here. The Special Features are found  on the second disc along with the digital copy. Personally, the digital copy doesn't do a thing for me. First up is \\"Reforging The Furture\\" which runs 18:59 and shows how the filmmakers reinvented the franchise. Then there are 4 featurettes - \\"Digital Destruction\\", \\"Enlisting The AirForce\\", \\"An Icon Returns\\", \\"Stan Winston Shop\\". These four total 11:30. So is it worth it to spend the extra cash for just a hand full of extras? I guess, but I would have loved to have more extras including a commentary.

B002MU4NL8|5.0|The guy who wrote the story, David Howard must be an absolute genius and a trekkie (not a trekker). I have watched this movie so many times I am embarrassed to say. For anyone even vaguely interest in Star Trek, this movie is a must see.
0060849827|4.0|Overall the book is of superb quality. I purchased this from Amazon.com directly, not through some other seller. The item was indeed new however it was printed upside down and backwards of the front cover. I expected a top quality item from Amazon not a misprint!
B002MBAJ4M|4.0|I own all of Mule's commercial CDs as well as numerous downloads from their tracks site. This is not a Dose, not a TDEv1, but it is very good, close to great. The last two minutes of Frozen Fear is as good as any.    Sometimes their changeups mid-song throw me off, and at times there seems to be a disconnect between the players, but for the most part it is a fine product. Deeper than most. Worthy.
B002MW50KO|1.0|Jimmy Buffett and Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull both knew their limitations and talents. So when they put out Christmas albums, they knew what would work, and what wouldn't, and made their musical selections accordingly.   YOu'll notice that Buffett never once touches the religious pieces and Tull touches religious pieces only as instrumental arrangements. But then again Dylan has always taken himself too seriously.      Some producer should have had the guts to tell Dylan that his selections were atrocious, and absolutely wrong for what is left of his voice.  But big names produce big fear, and so, we have this piece of musical garbage.      As many have noted the only piece that works at all is Must Be Santa. And that is only because of what he does with the reindeer names. Everything else is like nails on a chalkboard.  Doesn't Dylan have enough money as it is?    But there could be a bright side.  The military may have just found a new softening up option prior to high-level interrogations.  But it could be against the Geneva Convention.
0470477237|5.0|A great book that is here to read in bites, a useful insight into how social media is changing the way we think, communicate and work. If you think social media and the social media revolution are the marketing managers latest buzz words, then you need to buy this book. If you are the marketing manager and you do not have any faith in the social media revolution, get a new job. Get educated, get Socialnomics.
0307588335|5.0|This is an excellent book.  It isn't easy to write a book about finance - one in which we already know what happens at the end - and still make the story funny, suspenseful, and entertaining.  McDonald has hit a home run.  He ACCURATELY points out the roots of the problem (yes folks the late 1990s in Washington DC).      Richard Fuld is described as a most detached, irrational leader; a real-life Captain Queeg locked up in his office muttering about strawberries (or in this case high risk mortgages) while his crew gamely attempts to save the ship.    I think it is unfortunate that many negative reviews are focused on McDonald being a \\"low-level\\" or \\"relatively low-level\\" trader at Lehman.  I think McDonald should wear that title proudly.  He was in the trenches people!  Who better to tell the story than those in the trenches?    I half expect these critics to ignore Col Hal Moore's landmark book on Vietnam (We Were Soldires Once and Young) merely because Moore was not a General.  Shall we attack Moore for being a low-level \\"employee\\" during vietnam because he was a Lt Col in the Ia Drang Valley?    No.  Folks, this is an excellent account written by a foot soldier who was let down by his generals.  If you are waiting for General Fuld to write his version of the historic collapse of Lehman Brothers, I think you are making a huge (and dare I say, silly?) mistake.

B00004RF9G|5.0|Thanks so much, the movie is in great shape.  I got it and it is perfect.    Thanks again
B0026P3G12|5.0|Just a few moments ago I have received the disc of Susan Boyle. It is impressive satisfaction that it caused to me the fact that I did not buy it practically by a single song but due to be Susan Boyle, and what a pleasing surprise rather causes me when I did listen to each and every one of the twelve songs. They are angels' songs for my ears, especially the songs from an angel's voice, Susan Boyle's.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Thank you so much.  I bought this for my Mom for a gift for x-mas.      Thanks again
B001UHOWXI|5.0|Yes--the new Blu-ray Disc release of this 1946 Christmas classic is well worth the upgrade from any previous DVD edition.  I purchased the 60th anniversary DVD edition last year (which already looked quite good)--and the improvement in video and audio on the Blu-ray is remarkable.    There are two Blu-ray discs, one containing the colorized version and the second disc has the original black & white movie, plus several special features.  While both versions look crisp and clear and free of any grain or softness (especially noticeable in the numerous night time scenes--the blacks look terrific).  Colorized versions of original B & W movies usually look horrible (poor color saturation, less sharp images--the 60th anniversary DVD color version suffered in this way)--but this one looks fantastic--natural color saturation and an image that is every bit as clear and sharp as the original B & W.  As I was watching the color version, it was hard to believe that this was not originally filmed in color.    At first I balked at the nearly $20 cost on Amazon (as of December 8 2009, and probably much more expensive elsewhere)--but the upgrade was worth every penny for this wonderful, classic, family film.  You will not be disappointed!
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I picked this up while Amazon had it on sale for only $13. I'd already become addicted to the latest seasons but hadn't gotten around to watching the first - all I can say is I'm glad I did! Amazing show - well worth the $20 it sits at regularly!
0452295548|3.0|I think this book is could be great for people who are really into science and have not delved much into spirituality.  It makes an attempt at connecting the two.  I did however find the writing to be repetitive and a bit boring, which is understandable considering she has only learned to read and write with in the last few years!  From the perspective of having read a lot about spirituality it doesn't really bring much new to the table, and it over simplifies 'Finding your deep inner peace', as she puts it.  She says that the first thing she does is remember that she is part of the whole.  This works great if you have had a profound experience of connecting to the whole, however for most, this is simply a concept, and at best can only get in our way.    If you are interested in the brain, then I recommend this book.  If you are on a spiritual path, I wouldn't bother.  There are many more amazing books out there on the subject.
0307155102|5.0|This is also a book my children loved when they were little. What can I say except that it is the \\"Best Word Book Ever\\".  I know my Grandson will love it also.

1594488843|5.0|Drive took what I thought was a settled business question:  How do you motivate people? And turned it on its end.  In the book Daniel Pink first showed examples of monetary incentives not working or even working as disincentives.  He differentiated between repetitive and knowledge work and then shows that the way to incentivize people who have to use judgment, i.e. knowledge workers, is far more complicated and has to be based on increasing peoples feeling of autonomy.      This book should be required reading for all managers and students of management.  It doesn't fully answer the question of how to motivate creative people but it does reframe the question so that the answer isn't just money.  Some of the concepts Pink introduces are mastery, flow and purpose.  He shows how each relates to the needs of the creative person and how management has to adapt to motivate the person.      Drive is an excellent sequel to [[ASIN:B001TLNI08 A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future [WHOLE NEW MIND UPDATED/E    5D]]]  It also sets up the next book (I'm extrapolating) about building teams that incorporates pack theory and quotes extensively from Jane Goodall.  People are complicated Daniel Pink makes it a bit easier to understand what makes them tick.

Seeing it<br />in black and white for the first time is almost a must, because some scenes have<br />more emotional value to them when filmed in black and white. Then when you see<br />the film in color you can feel the difference.<br /><br />Great film for all..and nicely restored versions....enjoy.
0385340990|4.0|This is a good book about a little discussed area of the history of World War II -- the Occupation of the Channel Islands by Nazi Germany.  The Channel Islands belong to Great Britain and it is often said by historians that German troops never set foot on British soil -- they conveniently forget the Channel Islands just as historians of the American side of the war forget that the Aleustian Islands of Alaska were Occupied by the Japanese!  The book is written as a collection of letters written after the war by and to an author researching the stress release found in books and reading by the survivors of the Occupation.  I quite enjoyed it.
B002KVSJ64|3.0|I'm all for artists reinventing themselves and coming up with new sound every now and then as long as they stay true to the core elements that made them who they are in the first place and earned them a fan base.    Unlike prior albums, only half of this one is good. The rest sounded like some dissappointing attempt at pop rock. I'm not exaggerating nor joking, unfortunately, some songs sound so bad to me, that I thought I was listenting to some crappy pop rock band! Unacceptable really! But it happens with some artists.    Anyway, I'm still a fan, and I'd definitely buy their next album as well. The 2 preceding albums, Phobia and We're Not Alone, were legendary solid, very creative, and had a distinctive sound that clearly separated Breaking Benjamin from the rest of the pack. They better do a reset, go back and figure out what worked and what didn't, and work much harder on that next album!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Over the years since the debut of the Beatles, my husband and I had purchased LP's, tapes and CD's and naturally, the collection suffered through time, use and loss.  This package of restored CD's is an incredible testimony to the talent and timelessness of the Beatles.  Whether we are listening in the car or at home, we are quite simply, blown away.  My sons, ages 14 and 19, have grown over the years to appreciate the artistry and musicality of the Beatles but will not be getting their hands on these CD's!!
B0029LHW68|5.0|I don't understand the negative response to the CD on this site. I understand that taste in music is a matter of preference, but I think it's an absolutely fantastic album. To another review, you asked why the whispering and choral vocals? The album is called This Is War. If that doesn't have an epic connotation, I don't know what does, and the group vocals are one of the most inspiring and moving contributions to a song you can add. The whispering has a similar feel. I looked on iTunes to see if the response to the album was the same, and there are currently 200 ratings, 169 of which are 5 stars, 18 are 4 stars, and only 13 are 3 stars or below. To each his own, but I would emphatically recommend that anyone on the fence about this album go ahead and buy it. It's well worth the money.
B002MW50KO|5.0|This may well go down as Bob Dylan's most polarizing album.    5-star reviewers need not apologize for genuinely loving this album -- there are ample reasons to do so.  Energy should not be wasted trying to convert those who simply find this CD unpleasant.  It's not for everybody.  It wasn't designed to be.  I'm simply grateful that it is for me.    Nor should 1-star reviewers expend their energy trying to convince us we're \\"listening to a different album\\" -- we're not -- there are simply two very different camps of listeners, and hearing Dylan's take on these eternal Christmas tunes will invariably turn some people's heads upside down, especially those with strong conceptions of how Christmas music is \\"supposed\\" to sound, for those who cannot get past the reality that Dylan's voice is not as strong as it was decades ago, and especially for those who do not give the album more than a few spins.    It wasn't until my fourth or fifth time through the album that I went from thinking, \\"What's he doing to these songs?!\\" to, \\"Wait a minute, get over your preconceptions, listen to the passion, the phrasing, the heart, and trust the artist for a moment.\\"  So I did.  And now I have played this album at least fifty times in my car, and absolutely unconditionally love it.    In spite of, or in some ways because of Dylan's worn but still deeply heartfelt vocals, this album has won me over.  His voice isn't what it once was, but there's more truth in a hoarse, guttural, strained Dylan's pipes than in most singers half his age.    Dylan's reputation was not made by covering others' material.  By doing essentially an album of cover tunes -- and covers of some of the most iconic songs in the American songbook -- he is battling not only those who come to these songs closely analyzing his pitch and vocal strength, but also those who simply cannot get past what these song are \\"supposed\\" to sound like.  I submit that if the songs on this album were heard for the first time on this record instead of being the tried and true classics they are, this CD would be heralded as a landmark recording.  But getting past one's preconceptions is likely half the battle.  I'm thankful I was able to do so.    Favorite tracks are:      Winter Wonderland  Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas  Silver Bells    The song that took me the longest to enjoy was \\"Must Be Santa.\\"  But eventually, Dylan's \\"ho ho ho!\\" some 55 seconds in grabbed me, and now I'm hooked.    Polarizing?  Without question.  If you love it, enjoy the ride.  If you don't, well, there's no shortage of alternative Christmas CDs to seek out.  Enjoy the season.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This is yet another film that you can watch during this time of year. Despite it being far from perfect, it's a hilarious comedy, and I had a great time watching it. It has so many gags that work, and it has Will Ferrel as an elf (well, a human who was raised by elves)! If that doesn't seem funny to you, then I'd be fresh out of ideas. Ferrell gives a surprisingly excellent performance here, and the supporting cast is brilliant. James Caan, Bob Newhart, and Zooey Deschanel really have something here. But I think the greatest thing about this film is that it's one of those that gives you a very warm feeling about the holidays. It's about family, friendship, and most importantly, love. In short, Elf is a funny Christmas film. It may not be as memorable as It's a Wonderful Life or Home Alone, but it's still very entertaining.

B0026BX19I|5.0|This is a unique Japanese Box that includes the original UK Mono album plus 15 additional Mono tracks and a second disc with the Stereo mix album plus 10 additonal stereo tracks. Also includes several alternate Mini LP covers of the album with OBI strips and a bunch of smaller EP/Single sleeves in this collectors edition. Amazin stuff for any collector.

0446528056|5.0|Nicolas Sparks is my favorite author and this is my favorite book that he has written. \\"Dear John\\" provides an insight to the tests a military relationship can endure over time. For me, this hit home because my first love was in the Marines. It's cliche but, there were a lot of truths to this novel that I experienced first hand and was able to relate to.    It was an easy read and tugged at my heart strings. I was nearly in tears by the time I finished the book.
B001ECE4D2|5.0|Having not heard much of The Smith's work, I decided what better way than to purchase this fully loaded double disc compilation to give me the full Smith's experience? I was right. I listened to all 46 tracks with instant pleasure and a new found liking for the charming 80's English rock band. Steven Morrissey's deep, sultry voice had a calming sooth effect that kept me hooked song after song. The band's complementing guitar and drums added the perfect vibe to bring the listener back to an era where English punk rock was at its prime. Whether you know and love the Smith's already, or are just a blooming fan hoping to hear some unheard material, this fully packed compilation is for you. The price and quality are definitely worth the investment, and quite frankly, who wouldn't love The Smiths?

0790744295|5.0|I first seen Creep show when my parents took me to a video rental store back in the days when VHS were all the rage. I remember the video store having them huge floor TV's and I remember the scene of the guy buried in the sand at the beach pleading for help. I also remember seeing the movie cover of Ghoulies. The little green goblin crawling out of the toilet hehehe.  Creepshow is one of the great classic horror movies that got me into horror. It is timeless even today.  If you are a horror collector you mos def need to add this to your horror collection.  This movie is perfect for parties, sleep overs, in your college dorm, and even camp outs.  If you are a teen who loves horror please watch this movie!!!!
B0001CNRBG|3.0|I watched this movie several years ago and it is still a funny sweet love story.  The problem was the dvd was poor quality and it skipped and messed up throughout the movie.  Nothing any more aggravating than that.
B0015XHP4K|5.0|First of all blu-ray is amazing. These movies look awesome on the PS3 blu-ray system. I have seen all the Rambo movies before and I never want to see them again if they aren't in blu-ray. I really recommend them for anyone who has seen these movies or is an action fan of any kind.
B0015ABRE2|1.0|I LOVED the first two seasons and watched them through Netflix's streaming and then bought these discs to catch up on the third season.    Apart from other shows' episodes, there are NO Special Features in this set.  Well, if you have a DVD drive in your PC and don't mind running software from the drive, there is supposed to be an interview or two.  I have a Mac and the disc locked up my computer twice--that never happens, but this disc did it both times.    The video transfer is grainy and well beneath acceptable.  While playing in my HD-DVD player, the video played at what appeared to be maybe 12 frames per second.  Not acceptable.    UPDATE: While playing on my Blu-ray player, the frame rate is better and only occasionally gets out of sync. The picture is still grainy and there are still NO special features.
B00004SZWD|5.0|I enjoy listening to anything Stevie Wonder sings and I love Songs in the Key of Life. Its great music and I am happy to be an owner of the CD.
B002BWQ6H6|1.0|I had hoped for much more from this book but it never really grabbed me. I look for characters that I come to care about and a plot that grabs me. I found neither here.
B001FB55I0|5.0|I keep seeing a lot of people calling the 3rd movie \\"campy\\", and the 2nd \\"the best\\". I think these are just everyday movie goers saying things like that. Fans of the series who like action will like T2 the best, but fans more into horror say the 1st will never be beaten. Terminator: Salvation will be closer to the first film than the other two. I like this movie more than the 2nd and 3rd. The 2nd has the James Cameron aura around it that has everyone charmed. And even though the 3rd was filled with action and \\"over the top\\" machine on machine battles, it comes in 4th. I still wake up from nightmares of a blown in half Terminator crawling after me where ever I am, so the first is 1st on my list. Terminator: Salvation is full of the things that will only make my nightmares worse. James Cameron zombies are giving this movie low ratings to keep it down. If you are more of a fan of the First Terminator, this one might make you feel good.
1423117166|5.0|Fantastic,      This is one great book!  This book is front to back animation drawings with a small intro by John Lassiter.  There are animation drawings from Steamboat Willie to the Princess and the Frog.  Seeing these drawings before the clean up proccess gives you an appreciation and insight of the artist from the past to the present.  The book is a good companion piece to the Disney treasures book done by John Canemaker years ago.  Animation fans of all types cannot help but be inpressed and inspired by the artistry of the Disney animators past and present. This book gets my highest recommendation!!
B0017PCX20|5.0|This is the second Pineapple Thief album that I have purchased, the first being \\"Variations On A Dream\\" from several years ago.  Although I like that album a lot it is obvious the band has advanced significantly with this later release.  The band's sound is kind of like Radiohead meeting Porcupine Tree.   If you like either of these bands you will probably enjoy this disc.  \\"Unwound\\" features 9 tracks with two of them clocking in at over the 10 minute mark.  Bruce Soard is the main man behind all of the Pineapple Thief projects and he continues to improve as both a songwriter and singer.  Overall this is a very enjoyable modern progressive rock release from a band that deserves more recognition.

I love his new songs and I love the bonus disc because we get to see him perform two songs live in concert and boy is he a great entertainer, amazing. Then we get his hit singles new vid and it is so good, I`ve watched it over and over and then to top it off we get to see how he made the vid and that was fun and we get to see the Mika, the real Mika I would love to hang out with that boy!
044654146X|4.0|Isreal is a young yet rich country. How is it possible that a country who is constantly battling enemies can be so powerful? I've often asked myself that question and reading this book helped me to understand. If you are interested in learning about what it takes to make a country, then you should read this book.
B0011UBDTK|1.0|A warning to anyone thinking about buying the Collector's Giftset.  I purchased it through Amazon and two of the discs could not be viewed because the discs were damaged.  I returned it and received a refund.  Subsequently, I purchased the set through Costco and, again, there was at least one disc that could not be viewed.  I returned that set as well and got a refund.    To anyone considering the purchase of this giftset, I recommend that you keep your receipt and check each disc (by playing it)so that you can return it if you get one or more bad discs.  For anyone giving this set as a gift, I would let the receipient know of the potential problem so that they can exchange it.

B000O77QDI|4.0|This product came to me in a timely manner, Thank You for getting this dvd out to me so quickly!
B000MRA5NS|3.0|Nothing like a dozen product placements every five minutes to remind you that SONY made this film. Talk about killing any feel of reality...which is ironic, as that's what this movie was going for: more reality and less spoofing.<br /><br />And at that, it does pretty well. Sadly, Bond's sense of humor has been all but excised, which makes him barely Bond, in my opinion. As a fan of the books first, Connery's Bond second, and all the other Bonds way down the list, I appreciated the emphasis on less gadgets but did miss the wryness that Fleming and Terence Young brought to the character. Young defined the cinematic Bond first and best, and while this movie aims to redefine him, it barely touches the elan, wit and smoothness that made the early Bonds, and Fleming's Bond, so special.<br /><br />I like Craig more here than in Quantum, but I still think he lacks the dry humor and stresslessness that makes Bond. I'd take him over Moore, Dalton, etc any day, though. The balls out scene shows some humor, but is so dark as to be ridiculous. Nice try, though.<br /><br />And sorry, but there are so many weak Hollywood moments here. For instance, when they have the first beefcake shot of Craig as he walks out of the sea, his hair is all washed back. In the next shot, after the girl swoons at the sight of him, he is still in the same spot...but his hair is now magically and strategically plastered over his forehead. That's a bad continuity man on set, and a bad editor after, and just bad filmmaking, period. Face it, he's going bald...give him a wig a la Connery, or just let him keep his laughable Tom Sawyer haircut and be done with it.<br /><br />Savile Row suits at two grand a pop...and a six dollar Supercuts hairdo? Come on.<br /><br />It's stuff like that, and the nonstop Sony logo on every product, that makes this film cheesy after a while...plus, it's 30 minutes too long, I didn't buy the romance (Bond swooning?), and the poker scenes are horrible. Any decent poker player has to laugh at how badly set up those hands are. Last guy goes all in with a non-nut flush on a paired board where the other three players are calling the turn? Not likely he'd last that long playing that badly. Etc. Terence Young would have cut that in two seconds.<br /><br />But, this Bond is more about selling Sony and a sense of \\"reality\\"...and in the end, that's what makes it real enough to be boring after 90 minutes. I've seen this a few times now and each time it seems to get looonger.<br /><br />But hey, I'm gonna go buy something Sony. Don't know why...I just...feel like it....nds are.

0061914177|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo32FDW26ILDGW8]]Hi everyone, Jeff Esposito here from [...] check out my video review of Gary Vaynerchuck's Crush It.
0061537969|5.0|\\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" is a very touching story of the relationship between Enzo, a mutt that fully understands everything going on in the human world around him, and his human family.  The story is 100% narrated by Enzo himself, describing the sheer innocence of a dog's take on the human world he lives in, and how dedicated he is to his owner, Denny, a very talented \\"weekend warrior\\" race car driver that deals with many difficulties trying to prioritize his family life, racing, and work.  I happen to be a weekend warrior race car driver myself, and I faced the same life-changing situation as Denny faced with his wife, so this book really hit me squarely in the heart.  \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain\\" is a quick read and very hard to put down - I found myself looking forward to reading it whenever I had the opportunity.

B00005K9LN|5.0|I am not a fan of everything metal but there are some albums I think of as classics and this is one of them.  This is one of those albums that isn't just a single with a bunch of filler, but something that makes sense from start to finish.  The BAND is tight and plays as a single unit.  This was Judas Priest at its peak.  While the new stuff is great, this album, even in its 30 year anniversary, sounds as good as ever.  Really excited that these guys are still touring and doing a special one for British Steel this year.  If you love this album and they're in your area, be sure to check them out.  Halford still has it!!  The guy can scream like nobody's business.
B002MW50KO|1.0|Dylan, who even at his best was possessed of extremely limited vocal talent, sounds like he's singing through a tracheotomy.  As other reviewers have noted, this album sounds like it's a joke--as if some drunk homeless person were dragged into a karaoke bar.  Wicked awful!

B002OEBMN4|5.0|Slayer has brought us another instant classic of a release in the form of \\"World Painted Blood\\".  This CD can be placed with their greatest albums, such as \\"Reign In Blood\\", \\"South Of Heaven\\", and \\"Seasons In The Abyss\\".  Yes, it IS that good!  It has all of the ferocity, speed, intensity, and brutal savagery that you would expect from Slayer.  There are songs that will absolutely blow you away. \\"World Painted Blood\\" is the opening song and it is a very good one, if not great.  Not too fast, not too slow,...just right. \\"Beauty Through Order\\" is definately a very brutal track that will make your skin crawl with pleasure in the way of \\"Dead Skin Mask\\".  The way Tom Araya (singer/bassist) sings, then screams repeatedly \\"Birthright, Murder\\" at the very end of the song will send shivers up and down your spine. (The song is about the the first infamous female seial killer, Countess Bathory.)  \\"Unit 731\\" is kinda like a new \\"Angel Of Death\\" by topic matter.  Turns out that the country of Japan has a ugly past like Germany does in the form of human experimentation which took place during   WWII.  \\"Psychopathy Red\\" has that old school punk vibe guitar riffing at such a frantic pace, that it is amazing to hear Tom's singing (or screaming) can still keep up with the song from start to finish. Mosh pit song, that's for sure.  And \\"Not Of This God\\" is an awesome closing song that once again reminds you that Slayer is the best at what they do!! ( The middle part of this song has a guitar riff that is reminescent of their work from the album \\"God Hates Us All\\".  Nice touch I may say.  For the young generation, this is a great introduction to this great thrash metal band.  Old school Slayer fans, you will not be disappointed.  Slayer has done the same thing Metallica and Megadeth have done with their latest releases.  They went back to their roots, and that is a good thing.  Rejoice my fellow metalheads...old school thrash metal is back!!!

B001FB4W0W|5.0|When I received this order I was a little worried because the cover art seemed a little off to me. I bought this as a christmas gift so I just wanted to make sure I had no problems with it whatsoever. After having read some of the other reviews, I was worried I'd have problems with the discS not playing and if I waiting until after christmas I was worried about a return time limit. I emailed the seller and got a prompt but vague response, so I ultimately had to open the product, all the discs worked and I was able to reseal it. So my review, GREAT PRICE AND GREAT QUALITY, QUICK DELIVERY and HELPFUL/DEPENDABLE SELLER! Even with the vague response I knew I wouldn't have a problem.
B002ECJZ76|4.0|I watched this movie with a friend of mine.  I enjoyed it, she did not.  The reason we disagreed was simple.  This is not your traditional Hollywood Christmas movie, and that's what she was hoping for.  I, on the other hand, really enjoyed the story and liked the fact that it had a different feel to it then what we've come to expect from a Christmas movie.  There is no jolly \\"ho ho ho\\" and it has a more dark, somber underlying edge to it. In fact, there are times where it is just plain depressing, however I am not a reviewer that recaps the movie as I feel that's what the product page is for, so I'll simply say I think this movie is well worth the view.  But if you're looking for Christmas glitz, this is not the movie for you and I do not recommend this for children under 10.
B0029LHW68|3.0|After an almost four and half year wait and a lengthy legal battle, 30 Seconds to Mars have finally released their third full-length album, \\"This Is War\\".    One thing is certain; 30STM have seemingly used every moment of those four and a half years to create this album.  It's epic.  It's full of anthems.  It's just...BIG.  It's clear that the band intended \\"This Is War\\" to be their magnum opus, their statement.    But does the album actually, you know, work?    Well, yes and no.    30 Seconds To Mars certainly accomplished their goal of making an epic.  Song after song leaps out of the speakers and into the skies.  There are soaring melodies, booming drums, pulsing synths, walls of guitars and armies of voices.      But that's also the album's main problem.    The same elements are used on essentially every song.  The sound is exciting at first but quickly grows repetitive.  A few epic tracks sprinkled throughout an album add fire and greatness, but if an album is made up of epic track after epic track after epic track it grows monotonous.  That's exactly what happens here.    And, to be honest, it's extremely frustrating because MANY of the songs here are excellent.  It's the presentation that is the problem, not the songs themselves.  'Night of the Hunter' is sexy and driving. 'Stranger In A Strange Land' is extremely musically interesting. 'Kings and Queens', 'Vox Populi', 'Hurricane', 'Alibi'...there's just a lot of strong material here.  Sure there are a few duds, but for the most part the songs easily hold up.  There's no denying Leto can effortlessly pump out songs that are just flat-out catchy.  A lot of tracks here will have listeners reaching for the repeat button.  Also, Leto's still got a great voice.  He can croon, he can scream, he can belt it out with crystal clarity.  Whether or not YOU believe what he's singing, you can tell HE sure believes it.    But in the end the production and presention keep the album from being truly great.  It's all just too overblown and calculated.  There's no spontaneity here.  The songs never get a chance to breathe.  The songs didn't need choirs, they didn't need six minute run times, they didn't need to follow essentially the same forumla throughout the length of the album.  All they needed was to be allowed to exist on their own instead of processed within an inch of their life.  The band was so busy consciously trying to create an \\"EPIC\\" that they forgot to make a living, breathing album.  All the parts are there, but \\"This Is War\\" has no soul.  At its center there is only a pumping piston, not a beating heart.

031606792X|5.0|I've been reading reviews on here for days now and I'd have to say that I just love this author. She tells a good story and to me, that is what its all about. Getting lost in another world to get away from our problems. If you want to read a good book, then buy this one. Buy any of her saga's and you'll be happy you did.
0714834491|5.0|This is a great book to read during short breaks, coffee in the morning, or just simply bored. It took me a long time to read through all the pages. Inside are funny, serious, and mind boggling tidbits of intensely stimulating reading and visual material. Watch out however, the size and weight of this book is not for the light hearted.    I found out about Alan Fletcher after he passed away which was unfortunate because he was truly a respectable and admirable professional in the world of graphic design.
B0026P3G12|5.0|After hearing Susan sing \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\", I didn't think I'd ever hear her sing something as wonderful. But, she did it! \\"Who I Was Born To Be\\" is just fantastic! I am not a music critic, but I hope the powers to be leave her alone to sing just like she sings. She needs NO HELP. Her passion comes through in every song just as it should. And, sometimes perfection is over rated.
B002ELM5HY|5.0|There's no one quite like MK. He taps an extraordinary and rich vein each time, here largely a mixture of Celtic/Roots/American folk and blues/rock. I've been listening to MK since the Dire Straits days, and it happened here as it does with nearly each album of the past decade or so: I simply had to listen more than once to appreciate the unflashy richness of this album's lyrical and musical complexity. Some listeners might not find it as compelling or energetic as prior albums, but from my point of view these songs reflect the deeper and more introspective elements of his talents as a songwriter, interpreter of musical traditions, and guitarist. That is, not \\"worse\\" or less interesting; instead, rich in a different part of his range's broad spectrum.    A gorgeous album by one of the most intellectually curious, empathic and musically literate artists working today.
0953104907|5.0|This book is filled with informstion.  You really can build your own electric guitar using this book.  It covers all aspects in an easy to understand way.  I'm glad that I purchased this book to use my guide for building my own guitar.
0385504225|2.0|I like Dan's work but I have to agree with the other people who have posted their opinions about this book. I was excited when I heard about it but disappointed when I read it. I'm not expert but I've enjoyed his other works so much and was just wondering what I've missed while reading this one. On the upside of this, there are good stories in all of us. Some are just better at writing a book than some (like me lol) but hey, I'm a huge fan of Dan Brown and will keep reading his books. Sometimes we need to look beyond the bad words and editing problems and just enjoy a good story, right?
B001DJLCRC|5.0|\\"Mad Men\\" is great and I've watched three seasons of it, but \\"Breaking Bad\\" is phenomenal (and I've only just gotten started).  In fact, this could be one of the best shows ever.  Seven fantastic episodes kicked off by the pilot-to-end-all-pilots.  The only lull in the season is when Walter White's family has a long intervention with him about why he doesn't want to get chemotherapy.  Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad scene, but it's blown away by every other scene in the show.  Bryan Cranston does a great job, as usual.
B0029LHW68|3.0|Decent bubblegum alternative rock in the vein of early 2000s staples like Blink 182 and Sum 41, 30 Seconds to Mars is another alt rock band with a number in their name composed of four or five relatively harmless looking white male guys with a couple of carefully placed anti-Man tattoos and piercings, marketed to the new MTV generation. This Is War reminds me most of a more bubblegummy Linkin Park, with a lot more breaks for slow crooning. Think those TV ads for \\"Buzz Ballads.\\"    Again, for what it is, decent. Middle class middle schoolers will love it. 2.5 stars.    Review from Only Amazing
1595141979|2.0|but I just couldn't finish this book. I suffered through the 1st two, but I just can't get past the writing. I cringe at lease once on every page as I read yet another overly dramatic description that does nothing to pull me into the story and everything to make me feel as if I'm reading a book adaptation of a really bad soap opera. This often reads like the diary of a 12 year old (not that 12 year olds expressing themselves in their diary is wrong or something) but this book just irritates me.l I really wanted to like this series, so many do, especially when I found out what happens to bring about the beginning of book 4, but I'm going to have to admit defeat because if I don't I think my brain just may turn to mush.

B002FA5NNW|5.0|Wonderfully portrayed.. story of a man's journey. The hero's job loss leads him into a totally new occupation. The undertaker's profession is considered to be \\"low class\\" and one not to be proud of. He learns to love it and in doing so unfolds the beauty of the rituals and respect of  the deceased.

B002KSPKRS|3.0|These are my second pair of X41's.  To put it simply, if you chat over live, you will have problems with echo which will cause all your team to echo also.  The sound is very good and I have no hiss or pops unless I am out of range.  For Elite users with HDMI connected, you can plug optical cable to the optical out on your AVR.  That way you can listen to anything that comes through your AVR.  I tried with my PS3 for a movie but that did not work for some reason but my music and TV sounds do.  These are not worth any where near $200.00.  Around $125 would be better.  Sound quality is very good for gaming and allows you to hear more subtle sounds than through surround system (I have a 10 speakers system even).  When the chat does work without echo, your voice quality is static sounding.  If there was a better choice that is wireless, I would buy them but from all I read, these are the lesser of all the evils.  One thought, if all these people are having this much problems when new, what happens 2 months after use?  There is no warrenty for Turtle Beach on these BTW.  They just say they will take care of you...uh?  If you can get an extended warrenty on these, do so.  I wish these would work...shame<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------UPDATE------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />After owning these for almost a year, I still find them not worth $200.00.  First off and most important, there is almost no customer service.  This is my third pair and when I contacted TB about all the hiss, I have never heard back from them after 3 attempts.  This headphone will crack and hiss constantly at times, like in a lobby between games. During game play, it seems to go away.  Sound imaging (what directions sound comes from) is hard to tell.  You can not always tell if the enemy is on your right or left etc.  They have a very nasty pop if you get to far from receiver.  When the battery gets low they really hiss and pop, where it can hurt your ears.  Overall sound during game if fair to decent though, just not as good as they should be.  Overall, with all the problems, I am good with the fact I own them but feel they are really only worth about $99.00 at best.  They are still far better than a single xbox mic but there has to be much better choices out there...hey really hiss and pop, where it can hurt your ears.

0385504225|1.0|I read reviews before buying this book, but I figured since I enjoyed the DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons, I would give the Lost Symbol a try anyway. I definitely regret it. I think because I am listening to it, rather than reading it, the repetitiveness and long windedness of this book is almost too much to bear. I really enjoyed reading both the DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons; I thought the plot lines were interesting and controversial. The Lost Symbol has barely kept me engaged. It is predictable and poorly written. The major \\"plot twist\\" at the end was obvious pretty early on. Overall, I am very disappointed in Dan Brown's latest work. I think he can do better.

B000V1Y43W|4.0|Pixar has always been a great movies.  Cars is no exception.  However, in terms of movie history, Cars was the last of the traditional Pixar.  Since then the stories have been more unconventional, following a rat who wants to cook, a robot love story, and a man who moves his house with balloons.  So, its fun to watch Cars, which follows the more traditional story of a hot shot car who learns the value of a little town life.  The characters are great, mader especially is funny, and the movie makes clever use of the car world.  Everything is car related, from cattle to the bugs (watch closely and you'll see).  Also, I appreciate the basis of the story, the lost world of Route 66, where people cared about there stop, rather than drove past only stopping for gas.  In short, the movie is a resounding success that should be seen. Also, the blu-ray is gorgeous.  It is demo quality, seeing the reflections off every car, every detail in the ground, and you really feel the speed during the races.  Overall, Cars is a great movie, that looks amazing.  Recommended for fans of fun movies for a younger audience.
B001684L0A|5.0|I recently purchased this mini series after hearing rave reviews about it. I just finished watching the first couple of episodes and I was very impressed with the quality of production. The sets, costumes, soundtrack, casting are top notch and the acting of Paul Giamatti & Laura Linney deserve special appreciation. This is a great addition to your home collection and would definitely recommend this collection. And at $24.99, it is a great deal.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|Greetings      I am able to say that the Beatles stereo boxed set is simply amazing.    I doubt that gen Y fully, or totally appreciates, the impact that this remixed boxset produces.    This band will still be played in the year 1000, if human beings are still alive and kicking.    It does not age and now we are able to hear the mix as those of us with a record player and half speed master LP's have, quite frankly, heard for many years, so go figure.      This is a standard that other musicians are, will, and should continue to be measured against.    Is there a bad song, or a poorly recorded mix, again, quite frankly no!     So buy this boxed set and go and discover or reaquaint yourself with the band that makes Oasis look like the appropriating turds that they were (sorry they split up, and for good I hope this time).    As a musician, I say that most people would like to have a good day and at least be remembered for a song, or a catchy tune that does not age and may get better with time.    The Beatles far exceed, and surpass that simple and fundamental expectation, and as George Harrison once noted, the sum is greater than the total of the parts involved.     Give me love, give me hope, give me peace on Earth, give me life..........     Anyway, where was I, oh yeah! enjoy..................        David Prior    Brisbane,Queensland  Australia
B0019LY5IM|5.0|While this show has always tried to separate characters and then bring them back together, this season finds them the most separated they have ever been.  Now that we know who the Oceanic Six are, their story picks up 3 years later as Ben (Michael Emerson) attempts to get them to return to the island.  He finds a surprising ally in Jack (Matthew Fox), but some of the others have no interest in returning.  This is especially true for Kate (Evangeline Lilly).  What will get them to return?<br /><br />Meanwhile, those left on the island have become unstuck in time.  They and the island flash in and out of various time periods and learn some surprising things along the way.  Locke (Terry O'Quinn) still acts like the leader, but a surprising alliance forms between Sawyer (Josh Holloway) and Juliet (Elizabeth Mitchell).  As their health is affected by all the time skips, will Locke's desperate plan to stop their time jumps really work?<br /><br />I long ago gave up trying to predict where this show is going or make too much sense out of it.  I just sit back and enjoy the ride.  And maybe that's why I was able to enjoy this wild and crazy ride so much.  Crazy was certainly the key word here.  I never would have guessed where the show would go this season.  Some answers have been sprinkled into the mix, but frankly I still have more questions than answers at this point.<br /><br />Most of them were created by the final few minutes of the season finale.  I can't believe I have been hanging since May to find out what happens next.  The final season can't start soon enough for me.<br /><br />Of course, a compelling story would be nothing without good characters.  While Jack and Kate can get on my nerves at times, I still love watching Juliet.  And you can't help but love to hate Ben as he manipulates everyone into doing whatever he thinks is right.  Love them or hate them, the actors do an amazing job with their characters and the material they are given every week.  It's a joy to watch them work.<br /><br />I continue to have faith that this crazy journey really is leading somewhere.  Soon I'll find out if I was right or not.  Meantime, this is a show worth catching up on before the final season starts.nue to have faith that this crazy journey really is leading somewhere.  Soon I'll find out if I was right or not.

B002T45VX6|4.0|I love Shakira's music. I don't speak Spanish, but it doesn't matter to me. I actually am taking classes to learn, because I want to ENJOY her music more. I have always felt that it is her BEST, and I  happily own all she releases. I wasn't sure about this CD. I sympathize with some reviewers who view it as a \\"sellout\\", but music to me is \\"universal\\". I LOVE hearing all styles and am always FACINATED by<br />artists who are not afraid to try new sounds or stylings. The CD didn't thrill me as a concept, but if you really appreciate the artist that Shakira is, it GROWS on you. I am GLAD we have artists like Shakira today. Most modern music is superficial, and vapid....Shakira rises above this CD. I'm always inmpressed by her. You never know what you might get with her. For me, the best aspect of her music is her voice. I'm so intrigued, I hope she stretches herself \\"more\\".<br />I love this CD, and particularly, the title track, and \\"Spy\\" with Wyclef Jean...<br />Great SOUND!<br />  Shakira is someone I hope to see LIVE someday in concert. I live in an area<br />unfortunately that is still \\"way behind\\" the times  in appreciating artistry like Shakira's. Hopefully, the CD will introduce a new audience to her, and we'll see her in the Burgh in the not to distant future. I gave the CD four stars...and I do like her previous work BETTER, but I can't wait for the Spanish language release of this CD also. She's a very exciting artist, and I can sit and listen to \\"anything\\"<br />she sings for \\"hours\\".  Atreides
0061537934|4.0|This is an entertaining story written in human words. I wish a dog could really write!
B002PMV9FG|4.0|This entry in the series literally picks up at the end of the last.  The wizarding world has finally admitted what Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) have been saying for a year - Lord Voldemort is back.  And that leads everyone into a panic.  Ron (Rupert Grint), Hermione (Emma Watson), and Ginny (Bonnie Wright) are barely allowed to go back to Hogwarts by their worried parents, for example.<br /><br />But back they and everyone else go.  Harry is captain of the Quidditch team this year.  Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) has started teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts, making way for Professor Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) to regain his long ago post of Potions.  And love is in the air as all our main characters seem to struggle with their feelings for the opposite sex.<br /><br />Below the surface, trouble is still brewing.  Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) has been given a secret mission by Voldemort.  And Dumbledore has some memories and a mission of his own for Harry.  Will these missions mean that good can triumph over evil?<br /><br />Let's start by being honest.  Odds are if you aren't familiar with the characters, you probably won't get what's happening here.  There are just too many of them and they are introduced too quickly with little to no explanation or back story.  If you have seen the previous movies, you should be fine.  But don't even think about making this your introduction to the Harry Potter world.<br /><br />The other word of warning is to not go into the movie expecting the book.  You will probably be most disappointed by that here.  Instead of giving us lots of backstory on tom Riddle/Lord Voldemort, the film focuses more on the romantic stories.  I've got to admit, I enjoyed that.  I don't think I have ever laughed so hard at a Harry Potter film.  Plus we really get the return of Quidditch, which also provided some laughs.<br /><br />However, this emphasis cut down on the amount of time we could focus on the story.  And this story really sets things up for the final book (or final two movies).  I think enough of the pieces were presented that you can just watch the movies and understand what is to come.  But one plot point I thought was important did get dropped.  I guess we'll see how they proceed from here.<br /><br />I found the PG rating surprising at first, but I think it works.  Even with the romance playing such a key part of the movie, it is still more innocent in tone than the previous two movies.  That's not to say that the climax isn't dark, but it also isn't long and drawn out, which really improves the pacing.  It does leave one character's actions in doubt, but it's a minor point over all.<br /><br />Frankly, none of the movies have been completely faithful to the books, but this one seems the worst of the lot.  If you haven't read the books, you won't notice the difference.  And if you have, try to let that go and just enjoy what is here.inal book (or final two movies).

B00005MNP8|5.0|I have never been a huge fan of 70's music that was not made by bands like Pink Floyd or Joy Division. But Blondie made an album I realised as soon as I listened to it that created a path for a lot of bands in the years to come.<br /><br />This is a fun album that has it all. Bubblegum songs to play on the radio, memorable ones meant to be timeless (a.k.a. Heart of glass, Picture this, Hanging on the telephone) and even other ones to take Blondie serious (Fade away and radiate, 11:59).<br /><br />\\"Parallel lines\\" was an album that opened a door for bands like No doubt or Sublime (to mention relevant ones) in order to come up with an identity on punk, pop or even reggae. This said I must point out that this album was a pionner for many other ones with the same style and with the same attitude but, honestly as I read it in a book somewhere: \\"Parallel lines\\" has been an album that many bands have tried to \\"reproduce\\" but it has never been matched.
B000RJO578|4.0|I will admit that at times I go a little overboard when reviewing these `spoof' comedies.  I walk away from the movie thinking one thing and then, in the middle of writing my review, I change my mind.  The fact remains that these movies need time to settle.  The comedy in these films may not seem blatant and `laugh out loud' funny on the outset, but remembering the scenes can be more rewarding then actually seeing them.<br /><br />Case in point; `Monty Python and the Holy Grail' is one of my favorite comedies.  When I first saw the film I hated it.  It wasn't until a conversation I had a few YEARS later with some friends that I realized just how funny that movie really is.  Another film that strikes me as funnier when `thinking' about it is `Scary Movie 2'.  The difference there is that, when watching the film a second and third time, it becomes apparent that the film should only be thought about, never seen.<br /><br />So, it's safe to say then that, when reflecting on these films and writing my reviews my initial reaction can, at times, get thwarted by my newfound appreciation for what I had previously witnessed.  This has caused my views to get clouded at times (thus resulting in 5-star reviews for films like `Slither', that, upon further reflection should have remained the B-Grade movie I had initially intended it to be), not always for the better.<br /><br />I loved this movie from the start, in through the middle, and in the end as well.  Upon further reflection I still love it, and yet I see its faults and am forcing myself to keep with my initial grade (B+) and fight the urge to give it an A.<br /><br />Ha, now that I've said all of that (sorry), I can get to my review.<br /><br />`Hot Fuzz' pairs Simon Pegg and Nick Frost up with their `Shaun of the Dead' director Edgar Wright.  This time Pegg is playing Nicholas Angel, an overzealous police officer who has made it a habit of making everyone around him look bad, so much so that he is promoted only to find himself relocated to the country where the crime rate is low and the villagers are, well, interesting.  Angel is furious but he quickly adapts and starts enforcing the law, to the dismay of those around him (especially the lazy police force).  His partner, Danny Butterman, dreams of living out an action movie, and once citizens start dieing, he finally gets his chance.<br /><br />`Hot Fuzz' is obvious, but it is supposed to be.  You kind of know who to suspect the minute you see him, but it's okay because you expect that.  The film moves along a little slowly in parts, but it makes up for that with clever (albeit stagy) dialog and performances (Pegg slips into David Caruso mode effortlessly).  The film is kind of cut like a slick horror film, or an upstaged episode of CSI, with quick editing and glossy visuals.  The gore is very present, but always in a comical and `airy' kind of way.  It doesn't feel gory because it is there for you to laugh at.  The ending is the films best feature and greatest detractor.  It layers it on thick (the action scenes are gloriously shot and surprisingly charismatic and funny) and that is a good thing and, eventually, a bad thing (it doesn't know when to quit).<br /><br />Despite that twist upon a twist upon a twist upon a twist, it still comes together very nicely in the end and certainly warrants our attention.<br /><br />I was one who strongly disliked `Shaun of the Dead' upon my initial viewing, found it slightly humorous upon reflection only to watch it again and conclude that, while it has its moments (that record tossing scene is just glorious) it remains overrated in my opinion.  `Hot Fuzz' blows that one out of the water, and quite frankly, if it had toned down the end a tad (even in its longevity it does maintain its comedic timing though...that swan!) I would have given it an A, without any hesitation.<br /><br />I don't want to seem overzealous here, so I'm restraining myself (my inner movie-lover is aching to give this an extra star now!).  See what I mean?  I started this review determined to go the way of a B+ and I've already talked myself into an A-.  No, no I must stick to my guns here.<br /><br />B+, x's 1000!o go the way of a B+ and I've already talked myself into an A-.  No, no I must stick to my guns here.    B+, x's 1000!
6305428298|4.0|I had recently seen the play \\"Rise and Fall Of Little Voice\\" on stage in London and really enjoyed it so I couldn't resist seeing the film version with Michael Caine to compare. The film exceeded my expectations. The story of an introverted girl who mimics famous vocalists and her boozy loud and obnoxious Mom is incredibly well written and the actors in the film version are all terrific. This is a sad tale of desperation and family strife with some elements of dark comedy provided by Caine and the small time show biz type he represents. The surprise is the musical performance of Jane Horracks in the title role. She is fantastic. If I had to say which was better the film or stage version- I'm not sure I could pick. They were both great.

0061914177|5.0|Crush It! by Gary Vaynerchuk is excellent. It isn't a very big book only 142 pages so it reads quickly. The first half is kind of his history and isn't any different than other books like this. Where this book shines in in chapters 6-10, Gary goes through a basic plan of how to promote yourself using todays social media platforms.  It is clear and very straight forward. He lays out in simple terms a plan and approach that anyone could use to promote themselves or a business. And because it is short it doesn't overpower you with huge amounts of work.<br /><br />Great book, I recommend it.
B000GPIPT2|5.0|One of those great Monster movies that captures everything, including the human depth (even in moments where it isn't intended), `Frankenstein' lives on, literally, as one of the greatest films in this genre.<br /><br />James Whale (famed director) created a masterpiece when he constructed this brilliant fright-fest staring Colin Clive and Boris Karloff.  The film truly carries with it the feel of horror, with the mood primed and ready for terror.  The stormy nights, the creepy castle, the dark and sinister performances (Clive truly shows how genius corrupts the mind); everything adds up beautifully here.<br /><br />And then there is Karloff.<br /><br />For me, this is an iconic performance.  There are few performances that will go on to be remembered forever, instantly recognizable.  No matter who you are, how old you are, or whether or not you have even seen this film, the image of the monster is one that you will instantly recognize, and Karloff's name will never be forgotten because of that.  The performance, behind all that makeup, is very impressive.  It may not look like much on the outset, but there are surprising touches that make this a very astute performance.  The way that Karloff plays off his character's brute strength while maintaining a layer of fear (he is like a caged and mistreated animal) is outstanding, and that moment with the little girl, by the water, the playfulness and childlike curiosity; it's just perfectly played.<br /><br />The film, for me, speaks much louder than it may have initially intended.  I made a few arguments when reviewing `King Kong' a while back, about how Peter Jackson's remake brought new layers of life to the original.  What is great about `Frankenstein' is that it needs to remake to expound upon the issues presented.  While it is obvious that this film is focused on being a `monster movie', it still raises some ethical questions.<br /><br />You just have to look a little closer to see them.<br /><br />The obvious one is that of aspiring to be godlike and the damage that power can bring to the mind, but the moment in the film that I found MOST chilling was the `happy ending' that was, surprisingly, an afterthought.  As some may know, initially the monster was supposed to kill his maker (a bold statement in itself), but with pressure to create something more jovial in the end, they added a scene where Doctor Frankenstein is `recuperating' from the attack.  The happy ending, for me, is the best route this film could have gone, because unwittingly almost they have added yet another layer of harsh realism to the film.  The almost immediate disregard of the monster (now that he has faced his demise) is chilling because it showcases the fact that, as a whole, humans disregard life that isn't, well, human (or basically something they don't understand).  I compared the monster to an animal earlier, and this comparison works with this theory because it is more socially acceptable (or should I say `forgettable') when atrocities or careless acts of ignorance are committed at the expense of an animal, but when faced on humans it is another story entirely.  So, because the monster was something the people didn't understand, his life meant nothing, thus his demise was forgettable.<br /><br />It was a rude awakening, even if the original intent was to snag a smile.s that of aspiring to be godlike and the damage that power can bring to the mind, but the moment in the film that I found MOST chilling was the `happy ending' that was, surprisingly, an afterthought.

B0021L8UPS|3.0|Vera Farmiga, Peter Sarsgaard, and CCH Pounder give excellent performances, but it's the kiddies who steal the show in \\"Orphan.\\"<br /><br />Farmiga and Sarsgaard star as Kate and John Coleman, a successful and loving (or so it seems at first) couple with two children and the desire to adopt another when Kate's third child is stillborn.  They believe that they've found the perfect child in Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman), a nine-year-old Russian orphan who is sugary sweet, highly intelligent, and very artistic.<br /><br />Once Esther arrives at the Coleman home, she is immediately met with resistance by the Coleman's son, Daniel (Jimmy Bennett), and takes their deaf daughter, Max (Aryana Engineer) under her protective wing.  She is also teased at school for her dresses and the Bible she carries with her.<br /><br />Slowly the viewer sees sweet Esther turn into a very dark and sinister little girl.  Not only does she seek out revenge on those who pick at her, but she begins to manipulate Max and force her to help out with her dirty work.<br /><br />Esther also opens old wounds from Kate and John's past and drives a wedge between them.  Kate becomes suspicious of Esther and seeks out more information on her newly adopted daughter.  The head mistress of the orphanage, Sister Abigail (CCH Pounder), tries to help Kate and becomes a target for Esther as well.<br /><br />As Esther's dark past is revealed, her actions become more wicked and, in some cases, fatal.  It is at this point that the film begins to rely on well-worn cliches that have been trod out in a number of other films about evil children, particularly \\"The Good Son\\" and \\"The Omen.\\"<br /><br />Naturally there is a twist thrown in near the film's climax in order to give a motive to Esther's madness, and while it is rather sickening, it's not that big of a surprise.<br /><br />Overall, the film isn't that bad.  However, clocking in at a very slow moving 120-plus minutes makes for a somewhat boring experience.  I'm assuming that director Jaume Collet-Serra was trying to build suspense by drawing out the film, but it makes for a lackluster thriller in the end.  Even the climactic battle near the end of the film is drawn out and rather unbelievable.  It's almost as if the film is attempting to be a psychological thriller and a slasher flick at the same time.<br /><br />Again, the film really isn't that bad, just too long and a bit boring at times.  The children all shine in their roles, particularly little Aryana Engineer, whom I believe does an excellent job as Max.  Her performance is overshadowed somewhat by Fuhrman's turn as Esther, but she still shines on her own.<br /><br />So is this film worthy of purchase?  If you enjoy psychological thrillers involving young children then, yes, I say go out and buy it.  However, I do recommend to everyone else that you rent this film first.  It's good, but I have no plans to add it to my permanent collection any time soon.o build suspense by drawing out the film, but it makes for a lackluster thriller in the end.

B001OQCV24|3.0|While twenty minutes too long at 158 minutes, make no mistake that 2012 is an entertaining movie.  VERY entertaining.  It is also often quite bad or deeply silly.  (To say nothing of asking you to kick back and enjoy the most thorough destruction of the earth yet brought to the disaster movie genre...I will speak no more of this \\"moral quandary.\\"  It's a movie, after all.)    In 2012, we are asked to believe that in accordance to a prediction the Mayans made ages ago, the earth will end on 12/21/2012.  Basically, huge solar flares will send super crazy neutrinos towards earth, and they will burrow themselves deep under the crust of the earth, superheating the \\"glue\\" that holds our crust more or less in place.  Continents will shift thousands of miles, causing earthquakes and tsunamis never dreamed of in our worst nightmares.    Naturally, the governments of the world find out about this just a few years before it is to occur, and of course, they begin to devise a scheme involving a gigantic construction project that will enable a relatively few humans ride out the cataclysm.  And what do you suppose the best way to get safe transfer might be?  Good genetics?  A brilliant mind?  A skill set that will be critical to rebuilding the race?  NOPE.  It's one billion dollars.  This, of course, makes sense, because in the new economy, our old money will be really important.    Our journey through this epic disaster is, of course, charted by following a \\"typical American family\\" as they heroically outrun huge volcanoes, collapsing runways and the spectacle of millions of people being killed.  The family is nominally headed by John Cusack, a once successful writer now working as a limo driver.  He's divorced and has a strained relationship with his son, but a better one with his daughter.  They're both about 11 or 12, I would guess.  His ex is Amanda Peet, who is close to making it permanent with her new boyfriend, a physician and pilot trainee.  These 5 get just a little bitmore notice about everything getting ready to hit the fan, and embark on a series of close escapes across the globe, as they try to make it to safety.    Many silly things happen along the way...but there are also some jaw dropping scenes of global destruction.  Perhaps the best comes relatively early in the film, as Cusack and Co. escape from an LA that is literally falling off the edge of the earth.  The sequence features special effects that are flat-out incredible.  While every single instant of this lengthy sequence might not be 100% realistic, it is a spectacle not equaled in this sort of film.  It made me gasping and laughing in appreciation.  Watching skyscrapers collapse and fall into each other is jaw-dropping (and it doesn't evoke thoughts of terrorist acts).  It's over the top...but that's exactly what is needed.      Eventually the film somewhat collapses under the weight of all the characters they've tried to make us care about.  It begins to resemble POSEIDEN...a cast of generic characters struggling to keep from drowning...some will live, some will die.  Chances are you can guess exactly who will meet which fate.  And there's even a dog we're meant to be concerned about...while literally billions of people are being killed.      So the film is a series of breathtaking acts of special effects.  It's almost worth it for that alone.  And we have some fine actors doing some excellent slumming.  Oliver Platt and the always excellent Chiwetel Ejiofor play opposing sides in the President's staff.  Platt, no surprise, is the greedy, sneaky \\"bad guy\\" and Ejiofor is the idealist geologist.  Both actors are agreeably engaging in their roles.  Cusack does what Cusack does...and if you like him, you'll like him in this part.  Amanda Peet always makes things interesting, even when she has nothing to do.  Woody Harrellson shows up in a small, but key, role...he's quite over-the-top...and some will love him for it.  I found him a bit annoying myself.  Less successful are Danny Glover, as the President...utterly lacking the gravitas of, oh, let's say Morgan Freeman in DEEP IMPACT.  And as his daughter, one of the more annoying actresses on the face of the earth, Thandie Newton.  Here she manages to make almost no impression...which is actually a step up for her.      So, I hope you get the idea that this is not a great film, but if you understand the enjoyments a film like this CAN bring, I believe you'll be entertained.  If you insist on dwelling on illogic in plots...then you'll have a field day.  But I'd recommend just kicking back and letting the great work of the special effects teams sweep you away.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Like everyone else who discovered Susan Boyle via YouTube and BGT, this long awaited debut is the perfect holiday gift, be it for Christmas, Hannakah, Kwanzaa, or whatever you celebrate.  After December 1, it is usually only Christmas songs from now until Santa appears.  However, Susan has yet to be out of my CD player.  I've repeated this album over and over since buying it.  It is such a glorious work.  Hits many an emotion and all tracks are personally annotated by Susan in the liner notes.  \\"Wild Horses\\" is gorgeous and probably my most favorite track, though every song is superb.  Since I really didn't follow them, I was blown away when I learned this song was written by Mick Jagger and Ron Wood.  Susan also touches the same emotional level for me on Madonna's \\"You'll See\\".  The classic title track needs to mention, as Susan Boyle now owns this song.  An observation, more than a criticism, in listening to the great rendition of \\"How Great Thou Art\\", I thought I was missing something, as only the chorus is sung three times without first, then with a great choir.  I was waiting for at least one verse.  Though I love what is presented, this is the track I stumble on waiting for the verse that isn't there.  I'll get through it.  I'm glad that one Christmas song is included, and<br />\\"Silent Night\\" was chosen.  It is one of the prettiest versions in years, and can be played anytime of the year (even Streisand sang it during a summer concert in Central Park in 1967).<br /><br />I wish all the best for Susan on her musical journey, as she so deserves it.  She is my new hero and gives me so much hope that someone may hear my voice at age 52.  Hopefully, someday Ms. Boyle will honor me in a duet if I ever get my break.  I'll still dream the dream and hope it comes to reality.  Thank you Susan for the gift, the reassured hope and confidence.
0385504225|1.0|There are only a very few authors that I call my favourite and Mr. Brown was one. It is unfortunate to see the quality of work go down this fast this badly. I don't know if its because his hollywood deals or some pressure to produce more books in short time, whatever it was, the outcome is bad and I think Mr. Brown would concur himself, that is if he can bare to read this book himself. I firmly believe that the book was written so it may one day become a movie and that intention in itself is enough to kill the quality of the book.  Well this would be last time I read his book, same thing happened to John Grisham, an A-list author who started mass producing books and lost quality and fans.   The novel, if you do get to the end wil leave you with the huh-what the .... expression!!!   I'm actually sad to have lost yet another talented author to Hollywood!
B002NXSRW0|3.0|I grew up watching the cartoon and became excited when I heard a live-action movie would be made. I never did see in it theaters because of the horrid reviews this movie recieved after being very dissappointed with Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, that was really bad. So when it came out on dvd I took my chance and decided to rent it.    Let me tell you folks, this movie won't make you think hard or want to award the filmmakers any oscars or the like but man, this movie was really entertaining. It delivered with some really cool action sequences and the underwater batle was cool, kind of reminded me of the fighter battle in the Star Wars movies. It also delivered on some humor, courtesy of Marlon Wayans (who else?). I honestly can say I'd see the sequel and might even consider owning this film. It's not the greatest film achievement ever but man, it is solid entertainment and is an enjoyable 2 hours of not really having to think hard.
B002Q8GZ62|4.0|For their new Greatest Hits CD and first recording since 1989, Spandau Ballet do what fellow Brit Chris Rea did way back in 1987; they re-record their hits and include some new tracks. The new tracks are the beautiful title track \\"Once more\\" (sounding like something by the re-born Take That) and the Keane-style piano ballad \\"Love is all\\" (the first Tony Hadley composition), both melodic and acoustic.<br /><br />They apply this more stripped acoustic treatment to the 11 hits which both hits and misses. \\"Cut a long story short\\" slows down the pace and features choppy guitars and a pulsing rhythm, giving it a sublime feel. \\"Gold\\" is dreamier, without straying too far from the original arrangements (with a killer note held at the end), \\"Chant no.1\\" gets an incredibly groovy make over, while \\"Only with the pride\\" features just guitars allowing Hadley's still amazing vocals to stand out. These work very well. However, on songs like \\"True\\" which still sounds nice, something just seems to be missing. \\"I'll fly for you\\" is a bit Jazzy, and \\"Only when you leave\\" is also moodier but neither quite matches the originals.<br /><br />Still, this is a good collection, especially for fans, as we get different versions of familiar songs, but newcomers should get a proper Greatest Hits in addition.
B00000342V|5.0|Needless to say, the album itself is brilliant. Both happy and sad, filled with despair but with an ironic sense of humor, and of course filled with infectious funky grooves that are undeniable and low legendary. I personally found the bonus tracks (mostly sans vocals) to be very worthwhile, as they showcase the arrangements of Johnny Pate better than the original tracks, and show how flexible yet solid Mayfield's compositions are. Not that they are better than the album tracks, they just add to the story nicely if you enjoy the \\"big soundtrack sound\\" with strings and horns, or you are just really into this album. I also found the 7-minute Curtis Mayfield interview to be very insightful and inspiring, as it adds to my understanding of what he was trying to do musically and thematically. A true classic with a new chapter. I say spend a few extra bucks and get this edition over the standard CD.
0307702103|3.0|Always enjoy John Grisham stories.  However, the short stories of Ford County were slanted toward the poor, ignorant red necks.  Not all uplifting.  For the most part, enjoyed the series.  His lawyer stories have been the best.
0553382179|5.0|This book changed the way I thought about my daily life and everything that has to be done in it.  I am a naturally organized person, but some things weren't in order.  This book gives order to what really needs to be taken care of every day.  The whole idea of routines takes the pressure off of cleaning.  Wonderful book, even though you have to look past the cheesiness of the author's writing style.  It's SO worth the read.
B0029LHW68|5.0|30 Seconds to Mars' third CD \\"This is war\\" is truly epic, dark and atmospheric. Produced by Flood and Steve Lillywhite, it is different enough from it's predecessor \\"A beautiful lie\\" to show growth but not enough to alienate fans.<br /><br />From opening cut \\"Night of the hunter\\" (with thundering beats), the pulsing U2-style title track, to the strange droning instrumental \\"L490\\" (with some eerie chanting), everything is immediately catchy.<br /><br />\\"Hurricane\\" is an outstanding gentle almost acoustic rocker alternating in intensity (you need to hunt down an earlier incarnation of the song featuring Kanye West speaking in his \\"808s & heartbreak\\" auto-tuned voice and it works amazingly well). \\"Would you kill to save a life?\\" sings Jared Leto. \\"Stranger on a strange land\\" is more electronic with hypnotic strings and Leto doing his best Bono impression, while \\"Closer to the edge\\" and the marching \\"Vox populi\\" are jagged rockers with multi-layered harmonies (including fans voices) for a crowd effect (especially the latter where they declare \\"This is a call to war!\\").<br /><br />For ballads, we have the brief acoustic \\"100 suns\\" (with football stadium-style harmonies), and the beautiful \\"Alibi\\" (with a floaty ambient feel).<br /><br />\\"This is war\\" is a triumph for the band.
0307716988|5.0|To read this book is like hearing each word from Michael himself... Im not going to say much about what the book is about, because everyone knows it's an autobiography. Moonwalk is a must have for every fan, or anyone who likes Michael Jackson's music and wants to know how this wonderful talented child became the greatest Entertainer that ever lived.<br /><br />*much love MJ... I miss you.
B002VECM6I|5.0|I wasn't certain about going to see this movie...thought it might be too much football.  To the contrary, it was just enough of everything.  Each character was so well cast, even the biological mom whose silent struggle and brief appearance sticks with you long after the movie is over.    You forget the actors are acting.  Hats off to all involved - what a great gift from the movie industry to entertainment seekers this Christmas season. When people stand and movie goers applaud, it's a winner!!!!    A story that certainly should be shared.
6305127646|5.0|I bought this film out of a discount sale bin, motivated by memories of the old Roger Moore show.     I love it! It captures all the cleverness of the Saint, and throws in a sizzling hot romance to boot.      The original stories were good boys' fiction - but this film serves both action and romance tastes.  Can't be beat.  I wish they'd make a sequel!
0743581601|5.0|The Thirteenth Tale is absolutely fascinating, written in the most beautiful classic literary style with a story line that continually surprises the reader and holds him spellbound. Setterfield's use of the language makes it even more amazing that this is her first novel. The reading is perfectly rendered by two fine actresses and keeps the reader riveted to the characters they portray.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|What could I possibly say about this...awesome movie, awesome blu-ray.  The three disc set is great, I highly suggest that you purchase this immediately so as not to delay your enjoyment.
B002FRNCG0|5.0|As someone reaching their mid 30's I'm way out of the usual Paramore demographic.  However, I must say having listened to this album I am extremely impressed by the band in not making a remake of their previous smash Riot!  Riot! will forever be the measuring stick that the band is measured up to due to the insanely catchy hit singles that the album produced.  It was a very fun bouncy type record that almost anybody with a pulse can get into if they like that kind of music.  Brand New Eyes is the latest offering from these now veterans of the music scene and I must say the album is very solid both lyrically and musically.  The songs on this outing are not readily as catchy as the ones on Riot but they stand on their own two feet well enough.  Brick By Boring Brick is a great example very tight musicianship and of course Hayley Williams great voice gives it the polish it requires to make it a great song.  Other slower songs like Feeling Sorry are just as good.  For me this album represents a band moving on and maturing, no it isn't Riot! but it is something that the band obviously took a lot of time to write and record.  There will be people who either love this album or hate it depending on what they were expecting from the band.  If you don't expect Riot! 2  and give the album a listen then you might like it if not, well everybody has their likes and dislikes.  Kudos to the band for not breaking up after all the craziness and success of their previous album.  This is a pretty young band age wise yet they have already put out 3 albums plus eps, and are now very financially successful due to the extra boost from the twighlight soundtrack.  This rapid rise can crush most bands and I'm glad that they had the guts to make a new album on their own terms and not bow to the pressure and make another remake of their previous album.  I hope to hear more from this band for quite awhile. Great stuff all around.
B001GJOL22|5.0|What can I say...RUSH, one of the finest bands to ever exist.  This concert video is in beautiful Blu-Ray HD, the sound quality is outstanding and all the guys are in top form.  Simply awesome.  I could not more highly recommend it for any RUSH fan and as a tool to recruit new ones!  This disc has so very many tracks, both old and new, it was a truly great summary of their work to date...all 30+ years of it.  BUY IT NOW.
0385504225|4.0|This book wasn't as full of action as a few of his other books, but I thoroughly enjoyed it!  It was full of amazing facts about the United States and it's history/buildings/symbols/etc... it was entertaining and interesting the whole book through and I loved the plot!  Dan Brown knows how to keep you enthralled!
B001Q94TQA|5.0|First let me say that this is one of the best low budget films ever made.  It looks great on Blu-ray.  Instead of buying it for $30 plus shipping from these Marketplace sellers, go to the bottom of this page and click on Amazon UK.  I got my copy there for a little over $15 USD which even included shipping from England!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I've enjoyed Star Trek is most all its forms over the years, beginning with the original TV show. What I find I enjoy the most is the quality of writing and creative (even thought provoking) story lines. I've always particulary enjoyed those that deal with non-linear time and make you think outside the box, etc.<br /><br />I did not see this film in the theatre, but I did hear good things about it from some who did - so when it was due for release on Blu-ray/DVD I decided to get it right away (on Blu-ray). Being relatively new to Blu-ray viewing, and enjoying a brand new LED LCD flat screen 1080p TV, I spent the first few minutes simply marveling at the amazing picture quality... which is good enough to make you think you're floating in space beside the cameraman. Soon though, I found that the story was compelling and the plot was well written. I think they did a great job casting this film - especially considering the criticism that was guaranteed to occur with each casting choice. Not easy to re-cast extremely well known iconic characters, but they pulled it off beautifully (with the exception of Checkov *sp*, who suddenly has red curly hair as a younger man). Kirk was portrayed perhaps a bit over the top in terms of being a devil-may-care, authority bucking youngster - but not so much that it annoys. The best casting by far was for Spock.<br /><br />I tried to think of a reason not to give this film a 5 star rating, but I really can't. It stands on its own as a good enjoyable sci-fi thriller, fits neatly into the Star Trek franchise, is well written and acted, and has great visual effects. If you like Star Trek even a little, you should enjoy this movie.
0307269752|2.0|I keep trying to figure out *how* this Swedish crime novel became an international bestseller.  Yes, the decades-old case of the missing niece prodded me to reach the final page, though not with bated breath.  Yes, Lisbeth Salander (young, tattooed, socially challenged, incompetent-per-the-State hacker) makes a readable heroine; too bad she's given fewer pages than the alleged hero.  But other than the mystery subplot and Salander herself, almost every element of this work falls short, astonishingly so given the multitude of five-star reviews.<br /><br />Within these too numerous (465) pages, you'll find flat, artless prose; rampant description (rooms, every article of furniture therein, multiple walk-throughs of characters' daily routines); and clinical interior monologue.  You'll be treated to graphic scenes of sexual assault (realism in fiction is one thing; gratuitous detail is another).  You'll meet a main character (Mikael Blomkvist) defined by extreme passivity, unfettered libido, and frequent cluelessness.  You'll wade through endless exposition on the Vanger family history.  You'll probably find yourself interested in one or more of the plot threads, yet continually frustrated at their fragmented presentation.<br /><br />I agree with other reviewers that the book should have retained its Swedish title (MEN WHO HATE WOMEN).  This better fits the social commentary Larsson clearly intended; it better warns of the disturbing sexual themes; and it doesn't falsely promise us much page time with Salander, the only sympathetic character in the book.  However, even with a more accurate title, this novel's runaway success would confound me.  I guess it was brilliantly marketed.
B001FB55I0|1.0|Boy, I was looking forward to this movie. More Terminator stuff, getting down and dirty with SkyNet, more background on Judgement Day, and Christian Bale to top it all off. Well, I just now finished watching it and am writing this while it's still fresh. Lousy acting. Sub-par special effects if you can believe that of a Terminator movie. Shallow story line. Really poor ending that essentially tries to necessitate another movie. Nothing is resolved. You get no sense of satisfaction. It's a hollow feeling right now. Not worth the rental price, all in all. Hard to believe, really. So typical lately of sci-fi movies, no matter what the budget or who the stars are. Maybe District 9 will be good. I hope so.
0380713802|4.0|Travelogues of Europe have been around since the Roman Empire, so if you want your book to attract even the smallest iota of attention, you've got to be either a fantastic writer, or have a startlingly original tale to tell. Bill Bryson knows how to write, and more importantly, how to write a travel journal utterly different from any you've read before.<br /><br />Mr Bryson's secret is his discovery that, as any journalist will tell you, people aren't all that interested in travel or foreign parts; people are interested in people. And in Neither Here Nor There, the person Mr Bryson gives us is himself, a former newspaper journalist and editor with a taste for neoclassical architecture and draft beer, and a sense of humor that is caustic, expletive-laden, scatological, even prurient at times, but never less than screamingly, hyperventilatingly funny.<br /><br />It certainly isn't the most complete guide to Europe out there. By his own admission, Mr Bryson's itinerary is impulsive and random rather than methodical. He bypasses Europe's second-largest and most bull-trampled nation, Spain, as well as virtually all of Central and Eastern Europe, though in fairness these countries still lay behind an Iron Curtain that was only just beginning to lift. His 1990 journey starts off in Hammerfest, Norway, to see the northern lights, then skips down to France, and meanders to Turkey via Germany, Sweden, Italy, Yugoslavia and Bulgaria, among others.<br /><br />This route breaks little new ground, though Mr Bryson assuredly deserves kudos for visiting the top of Norway in the depths of winter. He travels mostly by rail, but sets himself no gimmicky limitations, and isn't above jetting off somewhere if the weather proves unappealing. Others may try hiking the continent or roaming it on a unicycle, but Mr Bryson gets around fueled by beer and irritation.<br /><br />Nor is the book especially informative regarding the things to see and do. Mr Bryson visits the requisite churches and museums, but rarely in elaborate detail, talks to the locals no more than necessary, and seems far more content to simply amble about the neighborhoods and parks and take in the atmosphere. The funniest parts of the book are Mr Bryson's frequent reminiscences of his childhood in Iowa, and of his two previous trips to Europe in 1972 and 1973. Otherwise, the energy of the book comes from Mr Bryson's catalog of complaints, discomforts and misadventures.<br /><br />This is precisely what makes Neither Here Nor There such a great travel book. Mr Bryson completely strips away the romance of travel, and save Angelina Jolie, none of us look our best naked--especially not if we're still wearing our socks. In his almost masochistically honest account, you feel that Mr Bryson strikes closer to the actual experience of travel rather than the ideal; the frustrations and fatigue, the queues and queue-jumpers, rude waiters and cabbies, small hotel rooms and large restaurant bills. Readers looking for more genteel fare should try Paul Theroux or maybe the adaptations of Michael Palin's BBC voyages (I love the man, but his idea of interview technique is to say \\"Fantastic, great\\" to everything).<br /><br />To be fair, Mr Bryson speaks almost rapturously of some places he visits, such as Copenhagen, Capri and Hamburg. But Mr Bryson the writer is at his best when Mr Bryson the traveler is at his worst. In lesser hands this would come across as mere whingeing, but it's never less than achingly funny to watch Mr Bryson wallow in his own misery.<br /><br />By now the book is dated, of course, but in a way, this only adds to the enjoyment. Neither Here Nor There forms a neat snapshot of Europe at the end of both the millennium and the cold war. Mr Bryson talks of prices in francs and marks and lire, where now there is only the euro. It is sobering to read of Mr Bryson's stay in Sarajevo, knowing that two years later the city, along with the rest of Yugoslavia, would plunge into a horrificcivil war that gave us the term \\"ethnic cleansing\\". His time in Sofia, Bulgaria, gives a hint as to why the Communist system collapsed.<br /><br />His decision to end his \\"European\\" voyage in Istanbul raises an issue that is contentious once again. In 2006, Turkey's talks to join the European Union were once again frozen. Where does Europe begin, where does it end? What sets it apart as a distinct region? It's instructive to note how easily Mr Bryson moves about the continent despite knowing, at best, just one language. Neither Here Nor There suggests what binds Europeans together is their ability to embrace travelers to their nations and tenderly, gently, lift the traveler's cheques out of their jacket pockets..

B0029LHW68|5.0|Me and 30 Seconds To Mars have had a love-hate relationship going on for quite some time, now. Their first album I found to be really inventive and \\"edgy\\", if that's the right word. But at the same time, I felt it to be rather pretentious and OVERLY wrought with \\"big word syndrome\\". For those of you who don't know what that is, it is when a band decides they want to sound smart and throw in these really useless words to make them sound intelligent when they really are not. Lets face it, 30 Seconds To Mars really isn't the thinking man's band. Anyway. On to their second release.    A Beautiful Lie had some pretty amazing songs, but it strayed away from the more experimental sound in favor of a more polished, mainstream outlook. Also, traded in all their talk of astronauts and aliens for more \\"personal\\" lyrics. But they ended up being your basic modern-day emo fair. Not horrible, but nothing amazing. Also, some of the songs were just downright bad. \\"Savior\\" is the immediate one that comes to mind. But it also housed some really good songs that proved 30 Seconds To Mars could pull themselves out of the wreckage and get back on their feet again. Mainly the title track, \\"R-Evolve\\" and \\"A Modern Myth\\". Overall, their debut wiped the floor with A Beautiful Lie, in my opinion.    Now, onto \\"This Is War\\". I'm just going to go ahead and say it. This is 30 Seconds To Mars most focused, solid, epic and emotive album they have released. It blew anything I thought they could pull off, out of the water. Seriously. It fuses everything that was good about the two previous releases and weeded out all of the pretentious, smarty-pants whining. Most of the lyrics are even really good! And that's saying something. I've always been a pretty big fan of the band but...Mr. Leto never really struck me as a very talented lyricist. I have been proved wrong. Congratulations universe...you win.    As bad as I hate to do it, I'm going to do another track-by-track analysis. Yes, it is the easy wayout, but it's the best way I can get my point across.    The album opens with the short-and-to-the-point, \\"Escape\\". This track REALLY sets the mood for the rest of the album. Right from the start you get this feeling of resistance and empowerment. Almost like a riot is forming from inside of your CD player. It's pretty fantastic. It segues nicely into \\"Night Of The Hunter\\" which is a LOT like the debut album. It has really industrial sounding drums and synth that sound like they were taken right out of a level of Goldeneye 007. It's not my favorite from the album, but still pretty fantastic. By this point, you can tell that 30STM have a lot of surprises in store for you. And you are totally right to think so.    \\"Kings & Queens\\" was the perfect choice for a first single. It's got all the makings of a radio smash-hit...but ti doesn't suck. I know. I was surprised, as well. Basically it's one of the best from the album and is currently tied with \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" for catchiest 30STM song. It's rare for a lead-off single to have such lasting value. Now, regardless of what I have ever said about Jared, one thing has always been true. He is a fantastic vocalist. Through and through. And this is made all the more apparent from the title track. \\"This Is War\\" is nothing short of an anthemic masterpiece of a song. It's one of those songs that makes the hair stand up on the back of your neck and raise you fist in the air. Especially during the soaring guitar that pulses through the chorus and the rallying cry of the bridge/outro. It also boats my favorite lyrics from the album. \\"I do believe in the light/raise you hands into the sky/the fight is done/the war is won/the war is won\\". Super simple, but at the same time, so powerful and uplifting.    \\"This Is War\\" transitions perfectly into \\"100 Suns\\". A short little acoustic piece that is quite pleasant. Now, if taken super literally the lyrics would seem rather forced and, (to me) offensive. But, I believe the lyrics aren't meant to be taken as literally as everyone seems to think. To me, it's just a song about banding together in times of turmoil. Pretty cool. \\"Hurricane\\" is the song that had a lot of people scratching their heads. 30STM...with Kanye West? What? BUT, I am here to let you know there is nothing to worry about. This song is fantastic. Plain and simple. It's one of the most atmospheric songs they have ever written and Kanye actually ADDS a lot to it. It just shows how far they have come as artists and songwriters in the four years since A Beautiful Lie.    \\"Closer To The Edge\\" was my favorite when I first got the album. It's got such a FEEL GOOD vibe coursing through it. Galloping, tribal sounding drums and Muse-ish soaked synths start it off and then explode into one of the best choruses on the album. It would have fit nicely into A Beautiful Lie, actually. Except...it's better than 95% of everything on A Beautiful Lie. Fantastic song. \\"Vox Populi\\" is (literally) a call to arms. At first, I didn't know how I felt about the song. It took me a few good listens to really get how amazing it was. It fits SO well with the resistance vibe of the album and builds up to an intense climax at the end. With Jared and a choir of 1,000 people chanting, \\"This is a call to arms/gather soldiers/this is a battle song/brothers and sisters/time to go to war\\". Much like the title track, this is another song that just makes you want to put your fist in the air.    \\"Search & Destroy\\" is the only song I'm not the biggest fan of. Maybe I just haven't warmed up enough to it yet. But regardless, it is the weakest on the album and the only one that doesn't really FIT with the sound. To me, it just sounds like the \\"safe\\" 30STM that was displayed throughout A Beautiful Lie. Don't get me wrong, it's not HORRIBLE...just not that good. \\"Alibi\\" totally makes up for where \\"Search & Destroy\\" fumbled. It seems like the most personal and emotional song from the group. It's got a REALLY nice build up/climax. Thewhole song just builds to this amazing release at the end. Now, normally the line, \\"I fell apart, but got back up again\\" just sounds forced and cheesy. But it is sung with such power and conviction that it really lets you know there is a reason behind it. Moving, to say the least. Overall, it may be my favorite from the album simply for how much emotion I can tell is being poured into it.    The ending one-two of \\"Stranger In A Strange Land\\" and \\"Equinox\\" is...different. \\"Stranger\\" is the darkest and most industrial sounding song the boys of 30STM have ever written. It's almost like Jared teamed up with Dave Gahan and Trent Reznor for this one. It's actually, at some points, genuinely disturbing. But in a good way. This is also the song that sounds the most like the stuff from their debut. It's VERY challenging and layered, but, with repeated listens, you'll slowly begin to realize it's genius. \\"Equinox\\" sends us off with a hum and a subdued acoustic guitar...which then fades into really ominous chanting of which, I believe, is in a different language. I would love to know what is being said. A fitting outro for the album.    They really pulled out all the stops for this release. This may be the biggest surprise for me this year in the world of music. A very good one at that. They have FINALLY produced what I knew they were capable of from the beginning. If this album is a sign of things to come for the band, it is going to be exciting, indeed. Still, my only problem with the album is \\"Search & Destroy\\". So, it will effect the score, sadly. Oh well. This album is phenomenal, nonetheless. Kudos, guys. Kudos.    4.5/5
B002NXSRVG|5.0|This si a fantastic movie. It does what Transformers tried and failed to do. It's a mindless action film wihtout being stupid and insulting your intelligence (like Transformers). It doesn't over do on stupid unfunny comedy. And it delivers over teh top action as expected.    This film is basicly what was in every 8 year olds head when h e played with GI Joes. A little bit from the tv show. A little bit from the comics. Some stuff changed. Full of fighting and death.     Lots of fun.
B0028SVXR6|5.0|Octahedron is The Mars Volta's 5th studio release, and it marks a noticeable departure from the bands proggy/fusion jazz/guitar freakout trademarks. Is this a good thing? You can decide that for yourself. It takes a lot of guts for a band known primarily for their 10+ minute experimental prog epics, to release an album almost completely full of slow to mid - tempo tracks that focus mainly on atmosphere and melody. The result, for me anyway, is absolutely stunning. Even on their earlier releases, I was drawn to the less frantic songs the most. Such as 'Televators' from De - Loused, 'Miranda...' from Frances The Mute and \\"Vicarious Atonement' from Amputechture. That's not to say I didn't enjoy their dizzying array of psychedelic freakouts on every release, though. If I didn't, then I wouldn't be a Mars Volta fan. I'm rambling. Back to the review.    Even without all of the prolonged guitar noodling passages, Omar still shines above almost all other members. Adding just the right amount of ambiance and effects to make every song feel other - worldly. Cedric has never sounded better, either. His high notes are still his primary weapon of choice, but the lower registers of his voice come out of the woodwork more than ever before, and more times than not, the effect is great. Thomas Pridgen returns again on drums, and this time more reserved. That is not a bad thing at all, though. Instead of putting every single beat one can do in every time signature into EVERY song, he focuses way more on groove and feeling. I also like it that Juan's bass can be heard better than ever, as well. The man is a beast on that fretboard.    The album opens with one of the best tracks the Volta have ever written. 'Since We've Been Wrong' rivals 'Cygnus, Vismund Cygnus' as best opening track on a TMV album. As soon as the chorus hits, the effect - ridden wail of Omar's guitar blends gorgeously with Cedric's voice. Something else you may notice from this song is that Cedric is writing lyrics that are easier to comprehend. This is a VERY good thing. There are actually some very good lines in the song that proves Cedric has some real talent when it comes to writing. 'Teflon' is a more familiar side of The Mars Volta. A mid - tempo number that resembles some of the best cuts from De - Loused. It also sports the catchiest chorus from the album, which is simply Cedric crooning, \\"Let the wheels burn, let the wheels burn...' over some pretty groovy drum 'n bass with some subtle washes of guitar.    'Halo of Nembutals' is where the more rasping lower octaves of Cedric's voice comes into play. Especially in the verses. If you listen closely to the first verse, it's amazing how many little subtle things are going on in the background. The second chorus into the bridge has some really sweet moments from both Juan and Omar, too. Although it isn't one of my favorites from the album, this song probably best represents the talent each one of these men have on their instruments. 'With Twilight As My Guide' is where you really begin to see the band pushing their own boundaries. It is the slowest moving song on the album, features no percussion and utilizes spacey keyboard effects and a prominent melody over anything else. It is easily one of the most celestial and beautiful sounding songs they have ever constructed. Some people complain about the prolonged use of ambient fade - out at the end, but I think it helps add to the effect of the track and makes it a perfect halfway mark for the CD.    'Cotopaxi' is the shortest and most straight forward song the Volta has written since 'Wax Simulacra', which it resembles quite a bit. It is ridiculously catchy and sporatic, and I think it will be the first song the long time Mars Volta fans will gravitate towards. Overall, a very solid and well thought out song. It would also make the best single. I hate calling 'Desperate Graves' the \\"low point of the album\\" or \\"my least favorite track\\", but I THINK it may be...I haven't reallydecided yet. The verses are absolutely amazing. Maybe the best from the entire album, actually. It's just that when the chorus hits, it seems to lose a little bit of steam. The chorus isn't BAD, by any means. I just think that it's oddly placed and a little contrived. Still, not a bad song at all.    Before I continue, I would like to state that every Mars Volta album has that one song that just takes you in from the very beginning, twists any and all emotions you may be feeling, and releases them all in a beautiful flurry. 'Copernicus' is that song for Octahedron. It is the most beautiful and etheral song that The Mars Volta have ever created. It is the definition of an utterly perfect song. There really is no other way to explain it. It has taken the place of 'Televators' as my favorite TMV track. Every word, every note, every feeling created seems to have a divine purpose. If you are not a believer when you first start listening, just wait until 3:50 and you will see what I mean. I feel like I'm being overly emotional about this song, but that is truly the way I feel about it. It's actually borderline creepy.    The final track on the album is 'Luciforms'. Everyone should know by now that I am the pickiest person in the world when it comes to album closers. The Mars Volta have only let me down once when it came to ending an album. I'm not going to lie, when I first started listening to the song...I had my doubts. I was hoping so bad that it wasn't going to be a Bedlam In Goliath repeat. Then, right about at 4:20, I began to regain hope. From there on, it becomes one of the highlights of the album. Featuring the one and only outright throw - down from Omar. But what he does with that guitar is enough to make up for the rest of the albums lack of excessive noodling. Pridgen also has his shining moment on the drums here, as well.    Overall, I believe this to be the most focused album that the Volta has released since Frances. After repeated listens to Bedlam, I was really fearful of this album being as over - stuffed and uneven as it ended up being. All those fears were cast aside from the minute I started listening to it. This album could even end up being my overall favorite by The Mars Volta. But lets not jump the gun too early. Me and Frances have been through too much over the years to say that just yet...but we'll see. Octahedron, you are eight sides of awesome.    4.5/5
B002TYZKIM|5.0|When I learned of the death of Michael Jackson, I was shaken to my core, overcome with sadness and disbelief.  After all, I watched him growing and evolving for more than four decades. The happiest moments of my life were because of, or spent in the shadow of his music. As beautiful as his July memorial was, those of us who couldn't attend, were left to watch televisions and read news headlines, and it felt a little flat. It was for this reason that I felt I had to see This Is It, to say a final and personal goodbye to a man whose talent and benevolent nature did so much to change the music industry and the world at large.    I must say, though I knew that the movie was more of a commercial venture, than a tribute, I was surprised and pleased at how thoughtfully and respectfully the film was produced and presented.  The side of Michael that ordinary fans never got to see, the consummate professional who, although he always strove for perfection, never resorted to cruelty or temper to get get what he wanted or needed from his crew, was always present. Although he was thinner and showing signs of age, he was as graceful and light on his feet as he ever was and his voice was strong and sweetly clear, and he good-naturedly chided everyone for making him use it,as he was \\"saving it for the actual concerts.\\" I fervently wish that the media had presented this side of him to the pubic, instead of portraying him as a drugged-out eccentric whose career was on the skids. Had these concerts come to fruition, Michael would've have at last known what we, his true and loyal fans have never doubted---that he was indeed, a kind loving man who gave so much of himself to the world, and was and will be for all time, the undisputed King of Pop. Good-bye, my dear Michael and thanks--- for everything.
B002HRTMHQ|4.0|As a singer/songwriter/bass player in a pretty popular local RnB band I'm always being deluged with albums of \\"neo-soul\\" artists that some today think are pretty good, or \\"the real deal\\".  Having grown up the \\"golden age of Soul Music\\" as a kid in New York City I saw and heard every Motown Review, Stax Volt Review and Independent show that came in town to the Brooklyn Apollo, the RKO Alden in Queens and of course, THE Apollo Theatre in Harlem.  So I'm just a wee bit skeptical when someone say \\"this guy's the new Smokey\\" or \\"that guy sounds just like Curtis\\".  Pheh...<br /><br />When I was handed a copy of Mr. Hawthorne's debut album \\"A Strange Arrangement\\" I was pretty skeptical. How ever after keeping it in heavy rotation in my various listeneing spaces for a month I paid him the ultimate compliment I can in this age of ripping and running, I came here and bought his album!!! Meyer Hawthorne \\"gets it\\"!  He understands how to pair a hook with a beat and keep it short. There's not a tune on this albume over 3.5 minutes in length. And while reminiscent of Curtom and Motown his tunes manage to be bright, upbight and soulfull.  At times you hear Curtis, especially on \\"The Ills of the World\\", other times you hear the Moments on \\"I Wish It Would Rain\\", but never ever does it descend into blaten rip off.  I enjoy this album immensely, enough to buy it and review it. You could do a lot worse.<br /><br />Worf
B000069KE0|4.0|[[ASIN:B000069KGM Chicago Transit Authority]] from 1969  was the first and best and by far most coheasive record by this band. Chicago II does not quite meet this mark, but has some fantastic music.<br /><br />Producer James Grucio, who also was working wirh Blood Sweat and Tears at this point, could craft some great jazz rock, but he also had some sloppy habits: he tended to take a song and edit in a walking bass line or a part to make it sound jazzy. He also threw in the kitchen sink, and sometimes payed little attention to making the tracks line up in a ccoharent sequence.<br /><br />But once you look past these flaws, Chicago II is a killer: filled with great jazz rock, fantastic soloing and writing. And even if the production can at times be sloppy, Grcio's approach could also work wonders.<br /><br />Such as on \\"Suite For A Ballerena.\\" This LP side long track features great pop, \\"Make Me Smile,\\" \\"Color My World,\\" bridged perfectly together by some fantastic jazz interludes.<br /><br />This guy was smart, especially for the times: make ambitous music for FM, but include songs with clear starts and ends for top forty AM.<br /><br />\\"It Better End Soon\\" is a protest suite and is harder rocking, with some great guitar work and more melodic jazz. This one was FM, all the way
1932100660|5.0|WOW. So informative so real. I can't believe waht I read so far. I would highly suggest getting this book asap.
B00006LJ6X|4.0|In general, Chicago became more commercial as they went along. By the mid 1970s, they were mainly a singles band.<br /><br />But you would not spot the trend listening to this album. It opens with an excellent side-long jam which at times reminds me of Santana's jazzier excursions around this time.<br /><br />There is also fantastic, sophistcated pop, such as \\"Happy Man,\\" and \\"Wishing You Were Here.\\" Bossa nova, spanish guitar and layered writing and production put this work on the top scale of Top 40 70s pop.<br /><br />James Gurrcio's production is even tighter here. He is smart enough to seperate the pop from the jazz, and this worked better when this was a doulbe LP set. The genre leaping that marred some of those early Chicago double sets is cut away here, leaving this a tight, coharent yet diverse album--probably Chicago's last stab at early 1970s progressiveism before they became a singles unit.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|So after all the hype of twilight, house of night, and the vampire diaries finally an adult version where you don't feel like a pedifile for watching it and thinking the actor is hot when you are old enough to be thier mom.  I was extremley pleased and have already placed my pre-order for season two and holding my breath for season three in june.  I am addicted.
B0014I4KIK|3.0|Only one hit was on this CD \\"Mercy\\". The other tracks were of another mood & style that I didn't enjoy as much. I couldn't have been happier to find this CD at such an incredible price and used. The condition was brand new from an Amazon source. I will always shop here first.
B000ZECQ08|1.0|Just received the \\"Digital Copy Special Edition\\", and went to download the Digital Copy and found that it is only compatible with Windblows. What the ...!? I bought this so-called special edition so as to get the DC, and now I can't because I have a Mac? NOT HAPPY AT ALL!!
B0000263JN|5.0|A classic, classic album that gets in your blood like few others, so the opening notes of 'Koeeoaddi There' always summon a timeless nostalgia, timeless yet constantly changing, and an atmosphere of early childhood where, as Ernst Junger put it, \\"the dark gate which separates us from our timeless homeland\\" has only recently been shut, and \\"the child still understands the language of the runes of Things, which tell of a profound brotherhood of essences...\\"<br /><br />Some of the lyrics read like they were written by a child, but this is deceptive - on repeated reading/listening their subtlety and sophistication is revealed. Some songs are serious, others great fun - and some are both. But don't mistake this for a 'serious playfulness' of the type a Steiner school advocate might endorse - it's far more anarchic than that, anarchic to the point of transcendence.<br /><br />The songs are wonderfully varied, but all feel totally at home on this disc. 'A Very Cellular Song' takes things down to the level of the unicellular organism, while 'Mercy I Cry City' exposes the shallowness and superficiality of modern 'civilisation'.  'Swift as the Wind' tells of the numinous realm of gods and heroes from the point of view of a child who is told to \\"stop imagining things\\", \\"for your own good.\\" But the child resolves not to shut his mind to the numinous, even as he realises he must live on a mundane level from day to day. 'Nightfall' and 'The Water Song' are beautiful tributes to night and water respectively.<br /><br />I give this album five stars - only awarded when I consider a work of art to be essentially beyond criticism, and where even the 'faults' contribute to the timeless miracle of the whole. Albums like this don't come along every day.
B002KDUDG6|1.0|Classic case of a performer who shoots to stardom doing a certain venue and then ventures off to another and thinks the same fans that helped him become the star he are going to buy that too....WRONG......Buble made it doing the \\"Amercian Standards\\"....he's trying to cross over to the Rap-Pop crowd....big mistake....his original fans reconized it right away and the effect is starting to show....he was about the only new singer that could do these standards and he'd always tell his audicence how much he loved these songs, it's an honor to do them, ya da, ya da....his recent performances on TV....Dancing with the Stars...Oprah..were dull, boring and if he already wasn't a star, he wouldn't be one after these performances.    Better stick to the American Standards...there's certainly enough of them in the American Book....the \\"angry\\" songs (loosely put) of today won't make the BOOK...it's really a shame.
0684833395|5.0|Perhaps the greatest satire on war, \\"Catch-22\\" presents many characters with extraordinary personalities, the most important of whom is Yossarian. Witty and cunning, he constantly tries not to avoid being killed while serving his duty in WWII. He meets many people and goes trough many trials in this book. One such trial occurs very early in the book and uses the book's title phrase Yossarian finds a catch in the system that says that soldiers will be sent home who are crazy enough not to fly an airplane into combat. The doctor tells Yossarian that he must first tell him that he is crazy, and then must have someone vouch for his insanity.<br /><br />Yossarian assumes that he will be dismissed, but the Doc adds one more stipulation: if someone asks not to fly because they are crazy, they can't be crazy because anyone who doesn't want to die must be sane. This, Doc Daneeka notes, is a catch-22. The phrase \\"catch-22\\" now appears in the dictionary because of this book. If that fact does not suggest the importance of this book, I don't know what will.<br /><br />This book is funny from beginning to end. It shows a lighter side of war. Most books don't refer to the human struggle during wartime but \\"Catch-22\\" uses humor to show how the conflicts between one man and the solders fighting along side him affect him in war. This book will be able to make you laugh about some very serious issues that effected people during WWII.
B002H3F7F6|4.0|You need this CD. I love that it is not a traditional Christmas album. It contains the beautiful, ominous, powerful tone that is Sting's voice with his lute. It sounds exactly like what a cold, winter's eve would sound like. I will be listening to this CD year round, though.
B000083C49|4.0|Star Trek IV is a great movie (some say the best of the series) and it looks great on DVD.  The problem is that this is a 2-disc set and there are so few extras.  No deleted scenes?  They filmed an entire scene with Sulu meeting his great-grandfather as a boy, but you won't find it here.  And why couldn't this have been the director's edition?  I think they did a widescreen director's edition on VHS several years ago, so it's not like they would have had to make a whole new cut.  I'm glad to have the extras that were included though.  At least there were more than with the Star Trek III 2-disc set.  But I'm not sure it justified having two discs.

B0000CD5FN|5.0|I bought myself this album for my birthday a few years ago.  From the moment I put it on I was like right on right on.  Track #2 was the jam.  I think I wore out the first copy I had and told every musician I played with at the time that this album was the truth.  Joe Strummer was a pioneer.  This album was produced in 2003 and released after Joe's death.  Rick Rubin sprinkles some of his magic to make artists sound alive through speakers attached to stereos around the world. This album hit me like a bomb between the minarets.  Ring the alarm we're here to wake up the snoring. I wish Joe were still alive and  am sure if he was he'd be rockin' on and on and on.

B002UD56I6|5.0|I had not been a fan.I had planned to get on UK ticketmaster & get some tickets to resell 'the tickets of the century on ebay'. Then, something happened. I really did not know how it happened. Near impossible, I scored early tickets way up front to his July 2009 London shows (in March 2009). I felt fortunate & special, as if I'd won some lottery. From then on, for months I played his music in great anticipation. I bought the rest of his albums from Amazon that I didn't have. I listened EVERY single day during my work outs & commute to work. I looked at MJ's youtube past performances in absolute awe. I quickly became a great admirer of his. I was actually going to go make two separate one week trips/pilgrimages, from Chicago, just to see him in London. These excellent seats were going for 1k each. I would not have sold them for anything. I realized how special he really was. When he unexpectedly died,I was left with such a tremendous hole in my heart. I was incredulous. Then,...I cried. I could not understand this mania that came over me. (I loved Michael Jackson the entertainer.) I lamented so sorrowfully that I would never see his last work. I NEEDED this film. It gave me closure. Of all the tributes MJ had, no one could come close. MJ's tribute to himself. I could not have asked for anything else. Just the opportunity to see him one last time, to see this legend perform, just one last time to spend with Michael. Just one last glimpse, for us, to be with him. \\"This is It.\\" I loved it. He was so loved, he knew how to spread love. Michael Jackson will forever be missed by the world.

B000000OAA|5.0|Not many other groups can get away with covering so many styles of music with such grace as Queen. A great album.Brighton Rock is a fast paced rock song with some high pitched vocals from the amazing Mercury interluded with some brilliant guitar work from may. 'Killer Queen' is probably one of Queen's best ever songs. 'Tenement Funster' brings in Roger Taylors vocals and is a slow but well produced piece of work. 'Flick of the Wrist' and 'Lily of the Valley' are both excellent songs which merge into each other as we go from rock to a ballad. ' Now I'm Here' is a classic rock song and 'In the Lap of the Gods' uses more vocal disturbance to produce a wonderfully diverse song. 'Stone Cold Crazy' is the 'hardest' song on the album and is actually a very early Queen song as it was often performed years before it appeared on this album. 'Dear Friends' is a slow interlude before the Deacon number 'Misfire'. 'Bring back Leroy Brown' is a very diverse song and is continued by 'She Makes Me' with May on Vocals. 'In The Lap of the Gods revisited' we have a wonderful end to a great album.

Queen did not know if Freddie would even live long enough for the album to be completed.The album, comprised of songs dealing with mortality, sadness and yet, the light at the end of the tunnel, leaves you with mixed emotions. Not to the quality of the songs but what you actually feel inside.It all begins with the epic, title track \\"Innuendo\\", recalling the glory days of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" with it's THREE styles of music included...it's lyrical nature very Zeppelin-esque.\\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\" sounds like The Cure with pep.The album's emotional weight comes from two main tracks. \\"These Are the Days of Our Lives\\" has Freddie \\"going back through life on a roller-coaster ride\\", reliving his past joys. \\"The Show Must Go On\\"...even with AIDS ravaging his body, his voice was never stronger singing with courage \\"My make-up may be flaking but my smile still stays on...\\" & \\"I'll face it with a grin, I'm never giving in..\\"This album isn't all morbid as evidenced by the all for nothing rockers \\"Headlong\\" and \\"The Hitman\\". Even silliness reigns with Freddie's own dedication to his favorite cat in \\"Delilah\\".

B002MW50KO|1.0|Without a doubt the worst Christmas CD ever released- Dylan sounds like the town drunk singing and groaning his way thru the tracks. The CD is actually painful to listen to. Spend your money on anything else.
B002H3F7F6|5.0|This is a beautiful collection of songs, some familiar, some not. It's not a jolly album, so don't play it while you decorate the tree with the family. This one is for those reflective moments when you've wrapped the gifts and placed them under the tree and are sitting before a crackling fire, alone, or just watching the snow fall as you drink that evening nightcap on Christmas Eve. Moments when you think of past winters, past loves, past Christmases, when you were younger, more foolish, more idealistic. And think how glad you are that you are past all that--and yet admit that the whole mystery at the heart of Christmas, and life, still fascinates you. And Sting's mellow voice is right there, like the voice of your memory, stoking the fires of remembrance.<br /><br />Here are traditional, medieval songs like \\"Lo, How a Rose E'er Blooming',  newly composed songs like 'The Hounds of Winter',  and songs like 'The Cherry Tree Carol' and 'There is no Rose' which to many will seem new but are as old as Christmas itself. Sting has also paired poems by John Dryden with music by Henry Purcell for songs that sound mysteriously medieval. And put a poem by Robert Louis Stevenson to music. The accompaniment here is wonderful: acoustic guitars, a harp. a violin, a bass, a trumpet, a lute, an oud and something called a 'ney'. Plus percussion that shivers like a cold wind across a snow drift.
B002MW50KO|1.0|Easily the worst Dylan album ever; easily the worst album I have heard in 2009; possibly the worst album ever recorded, but that's hard to prove since I haven't listened to every CD still in existence.

I would love to see more books from Stephanie Meyer on the Vampires and Werewolves. I would love to see a novel devoted to Alice and Also one to Jacob.......
B0015AARJI|5.0|I don't have a single complaint about this controller!     Micro USB charging port (aka I don't have to buy accessories).    Rechargeable batter that lasts for a day at least (I've played with the damn thing for hours and still haven't had it die on me between charges over night).     The only thing I wish would change on it? I have large hands and a slight belly - I'd like the handles to be a little bigger and pointed out a little further for me, but out of all the controllers I've used, I have to say I've liked this one the best.
B001F290E4|5.0|Seal's version of these songs has replaced the originals in my heart (& my cd player).  When I saw him perform the songs on Soundstage, I ordered the cd the same night. This is a wonderful collection of soulful songs, and he sings them with intensity and feeling.  His voice is incredibly beautiful.  I never tire of listening to this cd. It's perfection.
0316113506|3.0|The author definitely oversells his argument, which in itself is fairly sound.    One thing in particular I picked up on is his use of Naperville School Discrict 203 as a case study for how excersise improves learning.  It is true that the students there are excellent and do very well in science and math, but he doesn't look at other contributing factors such as ethnic demographics.  There are a large number of children from immigrant families who are very educated - India, China, etc.  Education is the #1 priority for these people.  I come from a similar family, although European, and can see that people who don't come from that background don't get it - at all. Excersise didn't make me educated, my parents and my hard work made me educated!

B001E2JNA6|5.0|Ever since first viewing the sumptuous BAFTA and Emmy Award - winning series Pride and Prejudice over a decade ago we have been addicted to it. With this reissue of it on Blu-ray it has to our great delight been restored to its pristine, colorful splendor.  The prodigious effort expended on the making of this series was truly a devoted labor of love lavished on one of the most engaging and affecting love stories ever created. In this connection we would recommend the comprehensive and enlightening account of it in The Making of Pride and Prejudice by Sue Birtwistle and Susie Conklin published by Penguin Books, BBC Books. Rather than being recorded on video in the studio as customary for TV productions this Series was filmed on location in Wiltshire and Derbyshire over a period of five months. Viewers' eyes are thus enabled to feast on beckoning vistas of the verdant English countryside providing an exhilarating and authentic backdrop for the whole story. The extensive and complex preparations required to mount such a vast undertaking are mind boggling. The book offers readers a comprehensive and fascinating account of the myriad details and requirements that had to be attended to, such as hunting for appropriate locations to represent Longbourn, Meryton, Netherfield, Hunsford Parsonage, Rosingspark, Pemberley and London; the endless negotiations to secure the availability of these locations, to cite just one example.     This filmed series was the brain child of producer Sue Birtwistle and scriptwriter Andrew Davies, who promptly took her up on her initial proposal. In tackling such an ambitious project they and their dedicated collaborators were not about to do things by halves. Michael Wearing, Head of Drama/Serials at the BBC observed about this version of Pride and Prejudice \\"that the idea of doing it wasn't executive led, didn't come from within the BBC, but came directly out of the passion of the people involved\\", a passion that immediately drew in this viewerand swept him along from beginning to end.    A convincing film adaptation of a literary masterpiece has to stand on its own feet as a genuinely new creation in its own right. Literal adaptations do not come off on film because lengthy narrations tend to become tedious and undramatic. As Andrew Davies has pointed out, these can be replaced by a \\"show don't tell approach.\\" His adaptation of the story as script edited by Susan Conklin is masterful. The division of six installments totaling approximately 327 minutes allowed for the inclusion of all essential scenes. While some incidents and two concluding chapters of the novel were omitted they are partially made up for by specially invented scenes that bring the story to life and capture its spirit in a graphic way. Even so, Davies most effectively managed to include telling portions of original dialogue and letters at key moments     We were so taken with this adaptation that it impelled us to pick up and read the original novel which, we are embarrassed to confess, we had never read. We frankly had not expected to be so captivated by a story told from a woman's' point of view. Indeed we found ourselves repeatedly rereading letters and dialogues, relishing them like relistening to favorite masterpieces of classical music.    No cinematic adaptation can ever replace a classic novel, but at its best, it can provide a fresh and complementary perspective to it. In our own mind there has been formed a fertile symbiosis between this TV series and the original novel, the two reinforcing each other to make the original story even more seductive.    Birtwistle and Davies succeeded in their aim to display the characters on screen as real people in all their physicality, to avoid merely presenting them as stilted historical figures. Although Darcy has been described by various commentators as an enigmatic character during the first half of the novel we did not find him deep down all that inscrutable in our reading. In spite ofher judicious reticence in handling the male roles in her novels Jane Austen had a fine insight into the masculine psyche in our opinion. To make her story come off more effectively on screen, however, Davies wisely fleshed out the male characters, especially that of Darcy, by bringing to the fore his masculine physicality. We see him riding on horseback, taking fencing lessons and diving into a lake. The physical aspect of Elizabeth's playfulness and vivacity is displayed in scenes showing her jauntily swinging her bonnet as she is traipsing through the countryside. That Darcy's romantic sexual attraction to her is the motor of the story is graphically brought home in a cleverly invented scene showing him initially taking a tub bath and then, as he dries himself off, espying her from an upper story window making sport with a dog, totally unaware of being observed and how she is affecting him. Davies thus admits having pushed the story a bit more being about Elizabeth and Darcy, rather than just about Elizabeth. Nonetheless most of the action is still seen from her perspective.    The background music composed and adapted by Carl Davis is a perfect fit to this filmed series. With the appearance on the screen of the floral embroidery preceding the first scene, it immediately sets a lively mood of eager anticipation, of exhilaration induced by the ambiance of refreshing country air and underneath it all one senses an electricity sparked by intrigues of hunting for prospective well situated husbands in tension with affairs of the heart. Throughout the film the music always appropriately reflects and reinforces as needed the prevailing mood of a particular scene. A capital instance is the unexpected arrival of the imperious Lady Catherine de Bourgh's carriage at Longbourn, announced by regally ceremonious music in the Handelian manner of a French Overture. Especially noteworthy is the key moment when the music provides an added dimension by commenting in the manner ofmusic dramas on the unarticulated and unseen significance of what is happening. Thus as Elizabeth and the Gardiners are wending their way towards Pemberley in the idyllic scenery of Derbyshire, soft music begins to gently insinuate a caressing intimation of budding romance as their carriage enters the woods of the estate with the stately mansion eventually coming into view. The unmistakable significance of that music becomes increasingly explicit as it is heard again while Elizabeth is viewing Darcy's portrait inside the mansion and near the end, as their romance attains full bloom after she accepts his second proposal during their walk together.     Composer Davis' choice of small instrumental chamber ensembles in the style of the late 18th and early 19th century was most appropriate, his decision to incorporate the  fortepiano, the most fashionable instrument of the time, expertly played by Melvyn Tan, felicitous. His selections of authentic source music of that or the immediately preceding period being played,  sung or danced to by the characters on screen were apt in every case. The fastidious sensitivity with which he chose his selections is particularly evident during that magic scene at Pemberley in which Elizabeth, standing besides Georgiana playing the piano, espies Darcy adoringly staring at her and reciprocates with an empathetic amorous look. Preceding Georgiana, she had just accompanied herself singing Cherubino's aria, Voi che sapete che rosa è amor (You indeed know what love is) from Mozart's and Da Ponte's Le Nozze di Figaro, an unmistakable musical emblem for this particular scene as indeed for the story as a whole. Georgiana then takes over at the keyboard with Beethoven's ingratiating Andante favori, its soothing strains gently sounding the melting away of former disapprobation and dislike under the warmth of embracing, reconciling love. Mr. Davis has provided an interesting account in The Making of Pride and Prejudice of his work on this film including his choice of music, what he was trying to achieve, how he set about composing the score, the rehearsals and the task of synchronizing the music with the action on the screen.    To our delight the film does justice to the important social function of longways dancing in this period and its specific role in this story. The dancing tunes heard during the dancing scene at Meryton are lively, those during the one at Netherfield more moderately paced, thereby highlighting the contrast between the boisterous social setting of one with the more elegant one of the other. Andrew Davies aptly characterizes the conversation between Darcy and Elizabeth at the Netherfield ball as \\"almost like a fencing match caught in dance. It echoes a tango or a paso doble. There's a lot of stamping feet, they come together and they part, and some turns they make are like the turns of a matador. You get a sense of combat as well as dancing.\\"     What, of course, clinched the extraordinary acclaim with which this filmed series of Pride and Prejudice was going to be received was the outstanding team of actors and actresses assembled for it under the brilliant direction of Simon Langton. Poor love stricken Hector Berlioz! After our initial viewing of this series we could for the first time truly identify with his becoming madly infatuated while witnessing performances by the Irish Shakespearean actress, Harriet Smithson. The fanciful image of her formed by his fevered imagination could hardly be taken as an authentic representation of the real person, but Classical Music lovers are forever indebted to him for having channeled his obsession into a flamboyant Symphonie Fantastique, wherein his beloved is treated as an ideé fixe,  symbolized by a haunting melody recurring in various guises. Alas, after pursuing his beloved actress for several years the extravagant expectation of his fantasy ran aground on the stubborn, disillusioning reality of the ensuing unhappy marriage to her! Yet thatwe are smitten with Jennifer Ehle's enchanting portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet we will not deny. With consummate artistry she captures every expressive nuance of Lizzy's varying reactions to the characters and situations she encounters throughout the story. Moreover she abundantly displays our heroine's defining traits: playfulness, an independent spirit, integrity, and, above all, a beguiling charm. Those \\"fine eyes\\", sparkling with mischievous wit, that much to Caroline Bingley's chagrin first irresistibly attracted the proud and aloof Darcy to her likewise cast their spell on us watching her on screen. Jane Austen confessed that she thought her heroine \\"as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print.\\" With Jennifer's Ehle's impersonation of her she has as well become for us personally as delightful a creature as ever appeared on screen. During the fifteen years since her performance in this series for which she received the BAFTA Award for Best Actress she has been displaying the depth and breadth of her surpassing talent and artistry in a great variety of roles on stage in TV and  film, twice winning a Tony for Best Actress and garnering several other prestigious awards. While we don't expect ever having the chance to witness her in a live production on stage, we have in the meantime watched with pleasure every one of her other cinematic performances issued to date. But more about that another time.    We owe Sue Birtwistle a debt of gratitude for refusing to take no for an answer when Colin Firth initially declined her offer for him to take on the role of Darcy. He proved to be the perfect  choice for it. In his portrayal of him one senses underneath his snobbish aloofness in the company of strangers a well disguised shyness and vulnerability. His innate reserve and proud demeanor seem to serve as a convenient facade shielding his passion for Elizabeth that he is trying in vain to resist. As he paces back and forth in the living room of Hunsford Lodge beforemaking his first proposal to her, one suspects a chink of insecurity in the armor of his smug assurance that his demeaning offer of marriage would be gratefully accepted by her. When he receives his unexpected but well deserved comeuppance with her scathing rebuke of his arrogance and crushing rejection of his suit, one cannot help pitying him while beholding the expression of extreme vexation spread over her lovely countenance and her \\"fine eyes\\" blazing with indignation. This entire adrenaline charged scene hues quite faithfully to its visual description in the novel and Andrew Davies has retained the major portion of the original dialogue to great effect. It is superbly executed by both protagonists under Simon Langton's brilliant direction.     The way the two play off each other is memorable throughout. Besides Davies' description, quoted earlier, of their dancing together at the Netherfield ball another fine example is their first tête à tête rencontre at Hunsford Lodge. Their body language marvelously conveys the pervading awkwardness of their interaction, her civility concealing her dislike of him and his reserve his smoldering passion for her. During their surprise encounter at Pemberley she fetchingly channels her discomfiture into an expression of bemused civility as she replies to his courteous enquiries about her family, his manifestly being ill at ease and inhibited tone of voice betraying a lingering romantic feeling for her. That magic scene, already commented on in connection with its accompanying music, was an inspired cinematic modification of Elizabeth's and the Gardiners' second visit at Pemberley as described in the novel. It further enhances in addition to brief earlier scenes Georgiana's role by showing her displaying her previously praised musical talent at the keyboard. More importantly that scene graphically answers the question Elizabeth had pondered in the novel during the preceding night, namely \\"how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still possessed, of bringing on the renewal of [Darcy's] addresses.\\" The film brilliantly depicts how that power indeed fans the flames of his passion. After rebuffing Caroline Bingley's venting of her intense jealousy we see him standing alone leaning on the mantelpiece of a fireplace recollecting with his mind's eye Elizabeth's amorous look with a brief flashback to it, followed immediately by a shot showing him the following morning hurriedly getting dressed and galloping on his horse posthaste to see her at the Lampton Inn. The immediately following scene at the inn, faithfully adhering to its description in the novel, effectively brings home the poignant irony of the emotional bonding taking place between the two protagonists prompted by the very news that makes the prospect for any further contact between them seem hopeless,     On their long walk together during which Darcy makes his second proposal, that wonderful extended dialogue in which they mutually sort out their past relationship was boiled down to its essentials in this cinematic adaptation. In the novel we read that Elizabeth's acceptance of Darcy's renewed offer produced a happiness \\"such as he had probably never felt before.\\". We would not have minded a bit to linger in the bliss of that cinematically abbreviated scene, to vicariously dwell a while longer in the rapture of that happiness after all the frustrating vicissitudes of their past relationship. We would also have welcomed a scenic adaptation of the delightful chapter in which Elizabeth wants Darcy to account for his ever having fallen in love with her. It was probably deemed anticlimactic and one would suppose time constraints existing as well. Capping, on the other hand, the happy ending of this romantic tale with a solemn double wedding ceremony no doubt was considered cinematically de rigueur.     In conclusion we should acknowledge the outstanding job of the mainsupporting cast. Susan Harker as Jane convincingly portrays her equanimity and good will toward everyone and acts as a convincing foil to the more high spirited and judgmental Elizabeth. Julia Sawalha plays Lydia to the hilt, just as she is described in the novel, \\"untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy and fearless.\\" Alison Steadman faithfully and amusingly portrays with utmost conviction Mrs. Bennet in all her foolishness. The interaction between the sardonic Mr. Bennet, as played by Benjamin Whitman, and his favorite daughter is delightful and affecting. Crispin Bonham Carter as Bingley clearly exhibits his good manners, unaffected cheerfulness and all too ready complaisance, Anna Chancellor his sister Caroline's snobbish elegance, persistent officiousness and barely disguised jealousy. Adrian Lukis displays, as called for, Wickham's superficial gallantry and suave manner. David Bamber thoroughly succeeds in his role as the pompous, unctuous, sanctimonious sycophant, Mr. Collins. Lucy Scott convincingly comes across as the sober, easily contented Charlotte. Barbara Leigh Hunt does full justice to the character of the peremptory Catherine de Bourgh and her supercilious air. She is absolutely terrific in the confrontational garden scene with Elizabeth. The rest of the cast all rises to the occasion as called for.      Incidentally the book, The Making of Pride and Prejudice recommended earlier, contains amusing and revealing vignettes by the principal actors and actresses relating their experiences during the filming of this series, a diary of a filming day, as well as an extended conversation with Colin Firth setting forth his insights into Darcy's character. As an added benefit the Blu-ray reissue of Pride and Prejudice also features a retrospective with interviews from Andrew Davies, costume designer, Dinah Collins and others as well as an account of the advanced technology used to painstakingly restore frame by frame the sumptuous colors and details of the original film.    This splendid adaptation of Jane Austin's masterpiece has already become a cinematic classic the luster of which is not likely to fade. It will always remain a source of perennial delight for film aficionados. Speaking for ourselves we could watch it again and again just to indulge each time anew in cherished romantic fantasies.

The Princess and the Frog essentially marks a comeback, a representation of what Disney used to be. That's good news for all fans of traditional animation.<br /><br />The Art of The Princess and the Frog is filled character designs, background art and storyboards. The art is unmistakeably Disney-style -- the caricature style of characters, stylized set designs and lush colours. The story is set in New Orleans and there are plenty of background paintings in different moods. The characters are lively and backgrounds beautiful.<br /><br />The team of contributing artists is impressive. There are new artists as well as familiar names. It's impossible to name all but those whose name keep appearing are Rik Maki, Armand Baltazar, Bill Schwab, James Aaron Finch (production designer), Ian Gooding (art director), Sue Nichols, Mark Henn, Chris Appelhans, Kevin Gollaher and many more.<br /><br />The artists and staff contribute numerous interesting quotes. They talk about the creative process, characters, the set and a bit on the story. There are stuff like what they did or where they went for research, inspiration and influence from older classic animated films. All interesting and insightful to read.<br /><br />This book a refreshing and welcome look back at traditional art, after being exposed to so much digital animation. Old school still has its distinct charm.<br /><br />(More pictures are available on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)
B002GY9F9K|4.0|I was browsing through things to watch on Netflix when I stumbled on this show. I was expecting something really cheesy like Xena or Hercules but was pleasantly surprised. I had just planned on watching one episode before bed but ended up watching three.     There is some cheese factor, it is a TV show fantasy after all, but it wasn't enough to be distracting.  A lot of the \\"secrets\\" were pretty obvious but when they were revealed I still found it exciting to see how the characters would react to the newfound knowledge.     I can understand why fans of the book may be disappointed the show didn't stick more closely to the original story line but I think it's unfair to call the show total trash just because of that. For the people who disliked the books for reasons such as poor writing, detestable main characters, or gratuitous amounts of rape and torture you may find the show to be an improvement.

B002TOJOVG|3.0|This movie seemed really good from the commercials. It should have had a bigger buzz. It definately did not dissapoint. Two guys rape and murder Gerard Butler's wife and daughter. Jamie Foxx delivers a nice peformance as a district attorney that makes a plea deal with one of the murderers just because he's scared to loose at trial. 10 years later Butler's character decides to get his own justice against everyone involved in his families murder. This once normal guy goes on an all out killing spree. The fact that he's some kind of genious probably helps. I really liked this movie. However, I could only give it three stars because it was not very creative. We've seen these types of movies a million times over. It's the same great story with different actors. It's still a very good movie though. These A-list actors really deliver. People have really slept on this movie. I guess after The Soloist people are not banking on Jamie Foxx anymore. He just bounced back with this one. Rent this one and buy it when it comes out on dvd. I give it a definate two thumbs up. Holla!
B0025KVLVA|5.0|Welllll, I sorta thought I was ordering the Remastered \\"Past Masters Vol. 1\\" (the original \\"Past Masters\\" discs came out in two different disc packages, Vol. 1 and Vol. 2) and got the 2-fer package.  Not like that is a real disaster but I wonder what goodies I might be missing by NOT getting the Volumes separately.....    The music is precisely what was expected and a crowning Jewel in this set is on Disc. 2; \\"Hey Jude\\" is really a stunner in good headphones.  It's like you've been dropped right into the studio with the guys.  (Many of the remasters are like that in varying degrees)    I have one gripe and that has to do with the shipping package that the discs arrived in, and not the discs themselves.  Amazon - that thin cardboard \\"envelope\\" with NO, ZERO, ZILCH, NADA bubble pack or ANY kind of protective wrapping around the product was NOT good - I was lucky that no damage happened.......unlike a DVD that came to me shipped exactly the same way.  With no cushion, the package probably got bounced enough that the DVD was knocked clean off the mounting spindle where it then freely moved around in the case, getting scuffed and scratched very noticeably.  IFFF the DVD was already like that BEFORE being shipped, the rattle should have been noticeable and should NEVER have been shipped in that condition.  I DO have to give Amazon credit that they replaced the DVD very promptly even though the replacement was shipped in exactly the same packaging with the same lack of protection.  It, however was in good shape.  Again, a credit for making good on a poorly packaged item that was damaged *probably* as a result.
B001UV4XWO|1.0|The movie has to be one of the worst movies i've seen this year. 2009 has been a great year for film but this movie is horrible. The plot was just not believable. Some guy shows up on your doorstep with a box and he tells you that if you push the button on the box you get a million dollars, the catch is that someone you don't no will die. Are you serious? Most people would bust out laughing and then slam the door in this weirdo's face. However, Cameron Diaz seems to have no problem inviting this strange man into her home. We later find out that this strange man is some type of alien that apparently works for the goverment. Once again, Are you serious? This movie is not only stupid but it's very dull. The characters all just seem to be going through the motions. What really bothers me is that this is the type of movie Stephen King would have made into a masterpiece. It actually feels like it has been done before but i dont no. This movie was not the least bit interesting. I would not rent this one or watch it again for free. Everyone please avoid this one. It gets a big two thumbs down from me. Holla.

I was a little worried that it would just be \\"another\\" bunch of pricey CD's, and I'm so glad I was wrong.  If you're looking for a gift for that special someone, who loves the Beatles, and is hard to buy for,  I would highly recommend this box set! The person receiving it will not be let down.

0451528018|4.0|The main conflict in this book is that Sir Charles Baskerville is killed. His heir Sir Henry Baskerville has to live in the old Baskerville home. There is a legend of the Baskerville hound that kills all the Baskervilles who go to the moor. The conflict is resolved when the hound gets shot by Sherlock Holmes. The owner is never seen again. He might have been killed and lost in the moor.<br /> Emily Graham from \\"On the Street Where You Live\\" is a lot like Sherlock Holmes. They are both very smart and are determined to find the truth. They are different because Sherlock Holmes is a real detective and does this a lot but Emily only did it once because she was involved in it. I think these characters would get along well. I think they would help each other by offering new suggestions and good ideas to one another.<br /> This book is marvelous. It ties all different genres into one good book. I would recommend this to everyone wanting a good mystery book. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is an amazing writer and this may be his best book ever. This book has a mysterious legend, Sherlock Holmes and a lot of action.<br /> I would recommend this book to some people. This book has some exciting moments but not a whole lot. This is a descriptive book and is a little hard to read. I think scholarly people would enjoy reading this book because it is a difficult book and is descriptive and well written. This book isn't the best book I have read but it is not the worst.<br /> A theme from this book that could help to everyday life is that sometimes weird things occur and you can't trust everyone. In the book there is a killing hound and the owner is one of the friends. This helps in everyday life because sometimes things that don't happen sometimes do happen. Also this shows that not everybody can be trusted. Sometimes you can trust people but sometimes you can't.
0812973992|5.0|McCann's novel-in-stories is a big, sloppy, urgent, bittersweet, hard-edged, sentimental look at a group of people trying their best to live in New York City in the 1970's. It is a harsh world; Vietnam is raging and claiming countless lives, prostitution and crime are rampant, and there is a general feeling of melancholy in the air. Enter Philip Petit, whose tightrope walk between the WTC towers forms the nucleus from which these stories disperse, coalesce, and yes, spin. This is a book to give yourself up to, written with such conviction and rare perception that it overruns the story's occasional lapses in structure. Every character, from salt-of-the-earth Corrigan to quietly mourning WASP Claire is finely drawn, relatable, and endearing. Also of note is the book's diversity in the different formats it is written in, making you feel that you really are listening to a group of highly different individuals speak. Always moving and distinctly human without ever being boring, this is rare and exciting contemporary fiction, and my pick for the most satisfying book of the year.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is a lot of fun.  My family plays it all the time, as well as my friends.  I bought the expansion the week after I bought the original, because we can't play it enough.  The 4th edition is great in my estimation, and I don't have any problems with the sea border that some said they had.  I also enjoy the little baggies they put in the box, that allow people with ocd to keep things separated.

031606792X|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I was a little concerned at first due to the negative reviews with this book but was pleasantly surprised.   First, Bella in twilight was a high school girl who didn't want to be in the spot light, clumsy, and was a girl who I think did not have a great view of herself. Then in BD, she becomes the vampire and has all the happy endings and I don't see anything wrong with that, its kind of the cinderella story we all have been wanting since childhood in my opinion. I couldn't figure out why people did not like that.   The issue with jacob imprinting on Renesemee, I do not see as pedophilia, its not like he was trying to be inappropriate with her at all. I cannot understand why it is such an issue as i never heard any major complains when Quil imprinted on a baby.   The fight with the Volturi, I knew was not going to really go down because then that would mean death for people and it allowed Bella to the heroine that she deep down wanted to be.   I really loved that at the end she was able to show Edward her thought and show him how much she loved him. I cannot wait to see that in film.   I believe that Stephanie Meyer did a great job with this series.
B002Q8GZ62|5.0|I totally missed this band in the 80's. My wive was a fan. This is just excellent singing and song arrangements. Acoustic guitar seems to be the center and then piano, organ, violin or sax enters magnificently. I play the cd often and am amazed by the talent and singing skill in this band. My wife says the tempo of the songs are slowed down a bit from the originals and there sounds like a little more orchestration. She says although they were redone differently she likes them equally with the originals. I'm just glad I discovered this band. I hope they can put out some new material. For those totally unfamiliar with the band think of Roxy Music, Duran Duran, and ABC only I think this band is the best of all those I just mentioned. Wonderful stuff, superior singing talent.
B001AVCFK6|4.0|The latest Star Trek film is out, the first film that uses no original television actors from any of the past series(except for one, but we won't ruin that for you.) Is it good? Is it bad? We're a little conflicted.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />  Well, the inevitable has happened. After many years coasting into oblivion(for the non-Trekkies), the Star Trek franchise has released its eleventh film. Yes, there have been eleven films since Kirk, Spock, Scotty, Uhura, Sulu, Dopey, and Doc left the television series, learned that they couldn't make money doing anything else except Star Trek conventions, and came back to film the first movie. But what does it mean?<br /><br />  It depends on who you ask.<br /><br />  For instance, many Trekkies(those loveable people who are so charmed by the franchise that they dress in costumes, play with imaginary phasers, and even have their own religion) may not like the movie. Why? Because unlike all of the other movies, it does not continue its story from any of the television series: William Shatner does not rise from the dead to command the USS Enterprise, again(although, there is an interesting twist to an old character in the new film); Captain Picard doesn't leave his vineyard to wax philosophical and his bald head with Q; characters from Deep Space Nine and Voyager didn't give the silver screen another shot with even a cameo; Scott Bakula didn't get to explain the sensual nature of green women. The movie wasn't even animated.<br /><br />  That was one thing that all of the other Star Trek movies had going for it: some sort of continuity for fans. You already know the characters and, for the most part, enemies. You knew the ins and outs of whatever version of the Enterprise the crew was flying around in. It was a comfortable place for die-hard fans, so much that you may not mind if Kirk and the crew decided to go back in time to pick up a couple of whales, bring them back to the future, and have them tell a giant, flying space turd not to destroy Earth. If nothing else, it kept pace with the original series.<br /><br />  Enter this new movie. With the depiction of Zachary Quinton(Sylar from television's Heroes) as a pointy-eared Vulcan and Chris Pine(of...The Princess Diaries 2?) as an arrogant blonde with some wit, it's no surprise that the movie is, indeed, a new portrayal of the old leg of the franchise. You would have had to live in a cave, or Nebraska, to have missed those hints. However, for better or for worse, the storytelling for this new film is nothing like the others. It does not have much to do with the original series' timeline.<br /><br />  Sure, we find Vulcans, Romulans, particle transporters, phasers, Starfleet Academy, the Vulcan peace sign, and Winona Ryder in the movie. We even get many of the quirky taglines from the characters, but the feelings of these devices doesn't seem like homages or parodies to the original. These screen devices are set up for the viewers that this movie seemed geared to.<br /><br />  Young, non-Trekkies.<br /><br />  This movie was a move to dislodge the franchise from the cycle it was stuck in of catering to fans of the television series, and instead try to appeal to the masses. It worked. By starting the story again, but with a twist(which I will not ruin for you), the necessity to really \\"get\\" a Star Trek movie by knowing the television show was tossed out.<br /><br />  Maybe that was why I liked this movie so much. I am not your normal Star Trek fan. I'm not a fan at all. I liked Wrath of Khan like everyone else in the world, but apart from that I watched the original series with tongue firmly planted in cheek, and randomly saw episodes of The Next Generation when I watched television with my father. Did I see all of the Star Trek movies that came out? Yes(although I don't remember the first movie all that well.) Does it matter to me? No.<br /><br />  As a movie onits own, it was quite amazing(I expected to hate it.) The opening part of the movie, as cheesy a plot device as it may be, was fantastic. I think I got a little misty-eyed. From there, all hell broke loose. Acting, special effects, phasers changing from \\"stun\\" to \\"kill,\\" Uhura half-naked, the spaceships exploding, everything popped.<br /><br />  It's hard to explain the great things about this movie, as it is all spoiler. Not just storyline, but emotional impact as a movie itself.<br /><br />  There were some things about the movie that definitely made me cock my head. For one, the storyline was old: \\"It's been done at least five times in the same movie series\\" old. The characters and events may be a little different, but it is still the same idea. You'd figure with this brand new push into popularity, Star Trek could have chosen a less overdone theme.<br /><br />  Also, the title of this review must be addressed: Star Trek Junior. What makes this movie appeal to the younger, less-Trekkie public is also what waters it down. Everything has a youthful, annoying freshness to it that the original never had. Even the new uniforms are \\"prettier\\" than the old uniforms. And what was up with the Power Rangers nod? Did Kirk, Sulu, and that other guy have to be in blue, yellow, and red space-suits? Why weren't they all in the same damn color? And, of course, let's not forget the politically correct version of the well known monologue: \\"Where no one has gone before...\\" Incorrect. You've already gone there, before. As a man.of the movie, as cheesy a plot device as it may be, was fantastic. I think I got a little misty-eyed. From there, all hell broke loose.

B001GCUO16|2.0|After multiple warnings from friends, colleagues, and random fan-boys/girls, I braved the theatre this opening weekend and hoped that the critics were wrong about how horrible X-Men Origins: Wolverine was.<br /><br />  They were.<br /><br />  It was even worse than I'd imagined.<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />  For the most part, the X-Men movie franchise has been good to us. Somehow, FOX Studios® and Marvel® had created a movie brand that not only appeased the old comic-book lovers of the franchise, but was also able to draw in new blood. Everybody liked X-Men. The franchise had gotten so big that prime-time television is on its third season of a hit spin-off, Heroes. They drew in so much new blood that they started releasing new comic-book spin-offs of the X-Men, and everyone and their grandmother bought them.<br /><br />  Hey, I'm not complaining. I enjoyed the ride.<br /><br />  Then, they got greedy. The producers decided to \\"go back in time\\" to explain the origins of Wolverine. It wasn't a bad idea. Out of all the X-Men, both heroes and villians, Wolverine's back-story is probably the most interesting, aside from Angel/Archangel, and even Jubilee(who's surrounding story of The Reavers is much more interesting than the character herself. Excuse me, my dorkiness is showing.)<br /><br />  Unfortunately, the producers didn't feel the same way, and decided to \\"Hollywood it up\\" into the piece of drek in theatres today.<br /><br />  I cannot blame the actors. Across the board, I had no complaints. Hugh Jackman reprises his role as Wolverine efficiently. He still has that angst-ridden animal nature working for him. Liev Schreiber recasts Victor Creed(aka Sabretooth) well, although he bounces around a little too much like \\"a cat.\\" Ryan Reynolds surprised me with the brief time he was on-screen as Wade Wilson(before becoming Deadpool). All his lines had a bit of dry comical wit, just like the Deadpool I enjoyed reading back when I read comic books. I can't imagine anyone doing a better job. Except maybe Jason Lee(from My Name is Earl, Mallrats, etc.) I even enjoyed Dominic Monaghan's(of LOST and Lord of the Rings fame) short stint as the fearful technolith, Bolt, and Kevin Durand's Blob. Unfortunately, these latter three characters barely had any screen time. They could only do as much as the script, and a last minute rewrite, allowed them to do.<br /><br />  A major problem seemed to be script and directing. The movie's intro was a huge step away from the end of the original X-Men trilogy. Instead of the dark drama, that coincided with the death of Scott Summers and the rise of the Dark Phoenix, continuing, the franchise reverted back to comic-book goofiness, where action drives the story and character development plays second fiddle. That wouldn't be so bad, except that the action is sparse, too. Having Wolverine and Sabretooth run through 4 wars is a nice idea, but looks way too forced on-screen as an intro. It is continued with a short government task force stint, a lot of walking around and lumber-jacking, until finally Wolverine receives his adamantium infusion. And the story gets worse from there, until the final fight with Deadpool himself, which is a travesty to anyone who enjoyed the \\"merc with a mouth.\\"<br /><br />  Another thing that bothered me, however small, was the depiction of Wolverine's claws. I remember the past movies having some decent looking claws coming out of Hugh Jackman's fists. For some reason, this time around they reminded me more of what they would look like in \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" or \\"Cool World.\\" This was especially prevalent in the bathroom scene. They looked way too cartoonish. I don't remember them looking that bad in the trilogy.can't imagine anyone doing a better job.

B0028RXXFC|5.0|Most of the reviews I have seen talk about the quality of the series ranging from the writing to the acting - all of which I feel are superb and among the best of any series ever made for TV.  I rank it right up there with Sopranos and Band of Brothers.  However, for the sake of this review I am going to focus on the Blu-Ray release.<br /><br />Packaging:<br /><br />I've read mostly negative reviews about the packaging, but I must state that I liked it.  It comes in a box and is \\"bound\\" in a booklet.  Each disc sits in a sleeve to the right of each page in the \\"book\\" and to the left is a photo depicting one of the characters/scenes of the series.  Each disc contains 3 episodes and the sleeves they are in show one small photo of a scene from each episode with the title of each episode.<br /><br />The binding of the book also has a ribbon bookmark that can be used to mark your place so you don't forget which disc you left off on.<br /><br />The book has an outer box to it which is what you see displayed on the Amazon image as the stock photo.<br /><br />My only complain on the packaging is that the \\"Blu-Ray\\" sign that appears in the top left of the stock photo wraps around to the back of the box set and is glued onto the outer box.  It is easily removed, but it takes a couple of minutes to remove all the glue residue.<br /><br />Quality:<br /><br />The blu-ray transfer is superb.  It is definitely an improvement over the DVD release and is even better than the original HBO HD broadcast.  The sound is also great.  My only complaint is that the extras are only in 480p rather than the 1080p that accompanies the episodes.<br /><br />Overall this is a great buy and is a must for any \\"Rome\\" fanatic!<br /><br />TTTTHHHHHIIIIRRRRRTTTTEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENNNN (any Rome fanatic should recognize this!)
B002K0WBY6|5.0|I think this movie is terrific - witty, romantic, fun. The actors are great and I really like the story.  The extras are terrific, too.   An absolute must-have!
B0029LHW68|5.0|Let me preface by saying that I could care less who is in a band.  I don't follow the news or celebrity of any singer/band member, I'm writing a review purely on the music, not the hype.    That being said, \\"This is War\\" is a mature follow-up to \\"A Beautiful Lie\\".  Listening to \\"This is War\\" the first time through, I thought the band took fan-favorites \\"From Yesterday\\" and \\"R-Evolve\\" and built on them.  Gone are some of the heavier elements, harsh vocals and overall feel of the eyeliner-required glam-rock with an extra spoonful of angst.  \\"Kings and Queens, \\"which is receiving some heavy airplay on the radio, is easily the hardest track on the album.    This new venture from 30 Seconds to Mars frequently features a youth choir providing backgrounds, and then album even features a track that sounds as if it was recorded live.  The album flows well from track to track- I'm on my third time through, and I have not re-ordered it for personal preference.    \\"This is War\\" gives me hints of Depeche Mode with increased use of keyboards, but the vocals are still king, and the guitar and drums are still superb.  The long wait for this album gave us one blessing in disguise: there is no feel of the most recent releases by The White Stripes or Queens of the Stone Age, both rock bands which tried to put out \\"new sound rock\\" and in my opinion, failed miserably.  This album is melodic, symphonic rock.    All in all, you will enjoy this album (and with an Amazon download price of $3.99 (12/8/2009) you can't beat that anywhere.  Always love saying \\"screw you\\" to iTunes!)
B002RV01QI|5.0|Listening to these gems hand-picked by Enya in DTS 5.1 sound adds a completely new richness absent in their original releases. Already penultimate recordings for their sound, lyricism, feeling, and healing powers, they all deserve a completely new listening experience (just like the first time). The goose-bumps are there, the grandeur, the elegance, the shimmering beauty, have all been raised to incredible levels.     Now, the rest of her amazing catalog truly needs upgrading to take the rest of us on fresh new journeys to lands we remember and cherish. It would be more than worth the effort (and expense) to remaster the lot. I'd buy them all again as would a great many of her worldwide audience.
B001TM1X0O|4.0|Most of us have been there - men and women alike. We have been totally into somebody who was not totally into us. Ouch. Major ouch.<br /><br />I postponed reading He's Just Not that Into You for one reason: fear. I didn't want to feel like the speaker of Lori Lieberman's song, Killing Me Softly, stunned and saddened that all the details of her less than illustrious love life were broadcast for public consumption. Eventually, I finally gave in and read the book.<br /><br />Sure enough, written upon the pages of this thin hardback that I picked up at a book swap were scenes from my life, documented to perfection. My college crush to whom I was nothing more than a friend, the charming man that I met at a party who never called me back, my first boyfriend who was a jerk only my rose colored glasses didn't permit me to see it - all the embarrassing situations I would rather forget had risen from the dead and assumed the form of a telltale self-help book.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I must say, I enjoyed He's Just Not That Into You. Authors Greg Behrendt and Liz Tuccillo are blunt yet consoling as they give you a healthy dose of reality. I have to admit, I was surprised to discover what some women are willing to tolerate from their men. For example, I never expected it to be necessary for this book to include chapters titled, \\"He's Just Not That Into You If He Only Wants to See You When He's Drunk,\\" and \\"He's Just Not That Into You If He's Disappeared on You.\\" Double ouch.<br /><br />This book does more than slap you in your face; it empowers you to make better choices in your life. It's riddled with humor to help lessen the pain, but it never backs down from its message: He's just not that into you so forget about him and attract somebody who is that into you plus some. Amen.
B001TW69J4|5.0|The other reviewers have already said everything you need to hear to be convinced that you should own this CD.    I'll merely add that you won't tire of listening to the complex, beautiful tracks.     I got to see these guys play live on one of their first tours (in 2009) and they were just as incredible live as they are on the CD. Tosin is a gifted guitarist and composer.     Buy it.
B002T45VX6|4.0|The price was excellent however, I'm not sure that it's the best work from Shakira. I think Oral Fixation was better work. That's just my opinion but, you can't beat the price and She Wolf is on it = )
0375413405|5.0|Thank goodness I watched Julie & Julia then bought this book.  I grew up watching Julia Child, but I always thought this cookbook would be too complicated for me.  The recipes are a bit involved, most of them actually, but they are sooo good.  Some are very easy once you make them once or twice.  My favorite is Chicken breast with cream sauce, and artichoke bottoms.  The whole vegetable section is great.  I wasn't crazy about the beef stews, like in the movie, but willing to try them again.  I look forward to exploring much more of this book.  Thank you Julia for an amazing cookbook, and Julie for turning me on to it.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|The video seemed well researched and fairly reported (not unduly biased).  It describes the current trend toward mono-culture and massive corporate agri-business.  It explores the risk of increasingly diminshing genetic make-up as farms plant fewer types and less diverse crops.  It was heart-breaking to see courageous individuals trying to stand up to inane governement regulations which support big corporations at the expense of the smaller farmer.  These courageous individuals too often find the big corporations can keep appealing cases for years until the finances of the \\"little guy\\" are exhausted.  The video also addresses the health costs related to processed foods-- obesity, heart disease, etc.  The video did offer a hopeful plan of action, in the belief that an informed public can demand policy changes.  Here's hoping.

0307269981|5.0|I was hooked after reading the first book The Girl with Dragon Tattoo and had to find out what happens to Lisbeth and Mikael.  I purchased the next book, The Girl who Played with Fire, and was not disappointed.  Murder, police corruption, underworld criminals sex trafficking and computer hacking are all part of the world of Lisbeth and Mikael.  An unlikely pair together is what makes their friendship unique.  You won't be able to put this book down until the end.  I am looking forward to the next one The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest. Since the author, Stieg Larsson, is deceased I am saddened to think that after the release of the next book we will not be able to visit the world of Lisbeth and Mikael.
B000001FNL|5.0|There's not a lot I can say that hasn't been superbly addressed by previous reviews, but I can't help and chime in about how great an album this is.  Out of the entire Bee Gees discography, this is my favorite record.  The songwriting, the performance, and the flow is all there in a complete package.  This is one of those few records where each and every song is a gem, with no \\"filler tracks\\" in sight.  My personal favorite is \\"Country Lanes,\\" sung by Robin.  It doesn't get any better than that.
B000000W5N|5.0|I'm commenting on a previous comment below from Alfred Junior Smith who is quite offended by this album. He feels \\"Brown Sugar\\" is a despicable statement of racism, and other songs are shameless celebrations of drug abuse. He declares \\"Decent people are revolted by such filth. No amount of musicality can overcome their revulsion.\\" Well, Mr. Smith, this is exactly what makes this album so F***ing great. It doesn't bow down to self righteous, dim witted ideas of \\"appropriate\\" or \\"wholesome\\". \\"Brown Sugar\\" isn't racist, it's celebrating inter racial relations in the most nasty way possible. It sounds like Little Alfred is struggling with a seriously repressed case of \\"Jungle Fever\\". And the drug songs aren't celebrating their use and abuse, but compellingly, powerfully describe drugs' darker side. If you are capable of thinking for yourself, Junior, then you might even hear them as warnings.<br /><br />Maybe Goody Two Shoes Smith has been overstimulated by the title of \\"Bitch\\", which just happens to be a kick ass rocker with a ball busting guitar riff and one of my all time favorite Stones song. No accounting for taste, huh? Or brains, or awareness, or personal hygiene, or...
B001BKG9SK|5.0|I'll make this short and sweet, It's David Gilmore say no more, Great concert, great sound. I only wish He could bring back whats left of Pink Floyd for one monster DVD with High Definition and 5.1 Sound  before they're all dead.
0375842209|4.0|This was a surprisingly good book.  I enjoyed the twist of the narration and the authors writing style.  I am usually annoyed by being able to predict what happens in a book, but the author tells the story interesting enough that telling us what is going to happen in the story is part of the enjoyment of the book.  I would recommend the book to anyone interested in historical fiction.

B002MW50KO|1.0|This is an abomination.  Butchering of holiday music by someone that just can't sing.  Each track sounds the same... the same awful croaking.  Just awful.

B002NXSRX4|4.0|This review is mostly about the Blu-Ray/Digital copy and less about the movie itself.      First with the bad.  The script is just flat out bad. First, the idea of going NATO instead of U.S.A. pretty much KILLS the whole purpose of the original G.I. Joe concept. Seems as if Hollywood is afraid to be \\"pro-America\\". But hey, dramatic license so that is forgivable I guess.  But because it seemed so different from the original, I decided not to see it in the theater - great decision. The acting is atrocious, just woefully bad - Tatum is often flat-out deadpan. Surprisingly, Wayans was the \\"best\\" actor in the movie but since he's a goofball and part of his role was being a goofball, that's not saying much.  He and Duke (Channging Tatum) were supposed to be elite special forces guys but that was very poorly developed and nearly unbelievable.  The script had some brilliant elements in sparce places, but they are too few, and too unconnected and underdeveloped - overall it was very poorly executed (almost appeared \\"rushed\\") and could use a \\"do-over\\". The action scenes are way over-edited and choppy so you never really feel like you are watching one fluid event.  Plus, the \\"facial hair\\" of Duke and Rip-cord when in dress uniform is but one of many annoying little \\"nits\\" and plot holes throughout.  I could go on and on.  The best part of the movie is the ending (no spoilers) which set up (finally) the \\"Rise of Cobra\\" and the rise of Destro.  Those who enjoyed the old show will probably find that part to be the most appealing.  Because of the ending, even after all that badness, I'm awaiting the sequel...    Now, despite all that is bad about this movie, I still give the Blu-Ray/DC 4 Stars and I encourage those with home theaters of any and all levels of quality, especially those with families trying to entertain on a budget, to purchase this movie at this price.  First and foremost, as others have said, it's pretty entertaining despite the numerous flaws.  Lots of cool gadgets and action.  Just lower your expectations and you will be fine.  And for $19.99 (+free shipping/no tax), you get: 1) the blu-ray (an awesome looking transfer, by the way, presented in 1080p/2.40:1 - totally enough digital \\"eye candy\\" if you don't mind CG); 2) DTS (5.1 DTS HD-Master Audio to be precise)surround which sounds great and will sound great in any home theater (this from an armchair audiophile); 3) Digital copy (for your iTunes/Apple TV or whatever you use.  This is a BIGGIE.  You get a studio quality copy of the movie, piracy free, to enjoy legally on your portable device.)  I generally support all blu-ray releases that offer this option without over-charging.  With all the bad, I could easily see watching this again from my iphone on a trip so I appreciate the DC; 4) A special features DVD with The Making of G.I. Joe and background on the visual effects and design of the movie.  I'm not one to always watch special features but I feel the studios owe them to us when we pay to \\"own\\" their movies, and since this set of features had me curious so I watched it - not bad; 5) MOST IMPORTANT - 2 hours of family entertainment for $20 from the comforts of your own home, and in the home theater you worked so hard for.  Even if just two people watch at $10/head, you've already beaten the \\"at the movies\\" cost.  Add in the DC and you're way ahead.  In this economy, I'll take it.

0891419195|5.0|This is an epic memoir about the author's time with the 1st Marine Div (K Co, 3rd Bn, 5th Marine Regt) on Peleliu and Okinawa. In a word, it is outstanding! It is a true war memoir in that it is virtually entirely about the authors combat experiences. The first 40 pages or so recount his basic background and then his training. The next 100 pages are entirely about the combat on Peleliu. The next half of the book is almost entirely about Okinawa. There is combat on virtually every page but it is never overblown. There is a great deal about the front line conditions, digging foxholes, being thirsty, being miserable, about living beside the dead.<br /><br />Most of the text though recounts the authors involvment in combat. At times there is a breathtaking story on every page. Some of these I'd read them before - they were so momentous they'd been selected in others peoples books as quotes. Many of these are not for the faint hearted. Sledge spares no one in terms of the awfulness of many of the events. His view that the war was an awful waste is very strong and he has chosen to detail things like they were to prove his point. He is also concious though that regardless of this the war had to be fought. He is exceedingly proud to have been a member of the 1st Marine Division. He also had a great hatred of the Japanese, given what he'd learned of them in combat. He comes to the conclusion that \\"To defeat an enemy as tough and dedicated as the Japanese, we had to be just as tough. We had to be just as dedicated to America as they were to their emperor.\\" (Pg 156) A very profound observation for a 20 year old to make.<br /><br />Above all, one is left with his deep sadness about buddys lost. His unit landed at Okinawa with 235 men, received 250 replacements and departed only 50 strong. The fighting before Shuri is ferocious and it sickens him. We read of Japanese infiltration at night, mutilated bodies and mistakes by fellow Marines that cause 'own' deaths. The idea of a terrible waste is revisited again and again. As is the authors disgust and fury towards the Japanese in the way they fought the war.<br /><br />This book has been described as a classic and I agree. Another reviewer compared \\"With the Old Breed' to Sajer's 'Forgotten Soldier'. Given the scope of Sledge's writings and the revelation of his deepest thoughts, I'm inclined to support that. This book is one of the top three memoirs of war that I have ever read. Very Highly Recommended!evisited again and again.

B002KQ6BT6|5.0|All of Dan Brown's books are amazing. But this book ranked first in my database of at least A Thousand books. Dan Brown has spun an intricate tapestry of the Freemasons. The amazing thing is that Dan Brown has used truth, but also strayed from the truth while making a completely believable tale. Katherine's work made me want to try it out myself. I found myself longing to become a Mason. His story is completely believable. Maybe he is right about us being God ourselves and that we are creators. I, myself am a very scientific person, an Athiest. I believe that religion is just a way for people to get away from all of the bad stuff. Even so, all of a sudden, I found myself wondering and believing that this type of thing, however unfathomable may be true. Dan Brown is my favorite author, for he makes me think hwile entertaining me with a somewhat true story about things that people have been pondering for years; things that scholars never figure out.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I got this DVD because I heard good things about it and there are 3 different levels so I knew I could mix it up.  My body tends to adapt to certain workouts quickly so it's important for me to mix it up.  The last couple years I've started having ankle, knee and hip problems, so I can't do a lot of the hard core, high intensity workouts.  I'm also not out of shape- I used to be a runner for 10 years or so, have been doing pilates for 5 years, and am also in a very physical job where I walk about 8 miles a day and have to lift things between 50 and 100 pounds all day long.  This DVD kicked my butt the very first day- I used muscles I forgot I had.  I like that she mixes it up between cardio, strength and abs.  She's no nonsense and pushes you- I didn't take it as her being arrogant, she's seriously just trying to prove that anyone can do it.  I also liked that she had modifications for the less advanced workout person.  I would definitely recommend this to someone who is looking for a challenging workout.
0385737947|1.0|I was so excited when i got this book.  I figured it would be right along the lines of hunger games and those other futuristic books like an enders game type of thing.  Well the idea of it sounded pretty cool but it fell short on actual plot.  most of the book is about these boys running around mazes trying to figure them out for several years. Then the solution is almost too easy.  Really it took 2 years to find the solution?? anyways, i won't give away any spoilers (not that it's not totally obvious through the book), but the ending is so rushed and just kinda thrown in there.  I finished the book because i started it, but luckily it was short and an easy read because i don't know if i could have plowed through any more than that.  Trust me if your thinking about this one, skip it.   The characters are bland and the main character just happens to be the first to think of all these survival techniques... really? idk, i just couldn't connect with this book.
B000ZELISO|1.0|If you're buying this to get the digital copy, don't bother.  It only works on Microsoft PlaysForSure (PlaysForMaybe?) devices, of which Microsoft's own media player, the Zune, isn't even one.  Seriously, Microsoft's OWN device does not support PlaysForSure.  Are there even any PlaysForSure devices?  If there are, they are older things like the SanDisk Sansa, or other really lame players.  DRM is bad, but broken DRM that isn't even supported by the company that made it is worse.  I will tell you OneThingForSure - you won't get this digital copy to play on anything.  Don't bother.

0316069906|5.0|I have been a vegetarian for over a year, which is what originally made me pick up this book.  However, the reader will soon see that this book is not advocating vegetetarianism, but simply analyzes eating animals and its moral, economic, and environmental impacts on society.  To dumb it down, it was an amazing book that helped reinforce my ideas on my eating habits and forced me to reconsider not just how morally wrong it is to eat animals and contribute to this horrible industry, but illuminated how factory farming affects the planet.  Two thumbs up!
B002Q9VPFM|5.0|FANTASTIC. the best version of this movie. the only problem is that this wasn't available as a first release months ago and i now have multiple copies of the movie some of which i will never watch again. i think it is time DVD distributors stopped treating customers with disrespect and give us the best versions of the DVD first time.
630522885X|5.0|Enough's been said here about this love-it-or-hate-it Ophuls opus (I'm in the love-it camp). All we've had to look at for years have been washed out prints in repertory cinemas and the washed-out Fox-Lorber DVD, soon to be forgotten. Criterion is releasing the restored 'Lola Montes' on February 16th, 2010 on both DVD and blu-ray. I've seen some clips of the restoration and the colors once again look as ravishing as they were originally meant to be. Several minutes of missing footage have been restored, and there will be lots of extras:<br /><br />* New, restored high-definition digital transfer (with uncompressed stereo soundtrack on the Blu-ray edition)<br />  * Audio commentary featuring Max Ophuls scholar Susan White<br />  * \\"Max Ophuls ou le plaisir de tourner,\\" a 1965 episode of the French television program Cin&eacute;astes de notre temps, featuring interviews with many of Ophuls's collaborators<br />  * Max by Marcel, a new documentary by Marcel Ophuls about his father and the making of Lola Mont&egrave;s<br />  * Silent footage of actress Martine Carol demonstrating the various glamorous hairstyles in Lola Mont&egrave;s<br />  * Theatrical rerelease trailer from Rialto Pictures<br />  * New and improved English subtitle translation<br />  * PLUS: A booklet featuring an essay by film critic Gary Giddins<br /><br />For those who love this film, I do believe this is what we've been waiting for!

0316010669|4.0|Blink is a well written thesis on the merits and pitfalls of both snap judgments and lengthy decision making process.<br /><br />As always Malcom Gladwell not only presents advanced social cognition concepts in easy to understand plain-speak, the author also provides interesting examples to augment their argument.<br /><br />Of particular interest in Gladwell's description of Prof. Ekman, the academic that the popular TV series Lie to Me is based upon. Also illuminating but mildly frightening is the section on police pursuits and the effect of high adrenaline situations on police judgment.<br /><br />Gladwell shows a remarkable ability not only to translate complicated concepts into fascinating easy-to-read prose. He also has a strange ability to address and calm controversy, a skill that seems absent from many non-fiction writiers.<br /><br />While Gladwell does ramble occasionally, its still a worthwhile read particularly for anyone interested in psychology.
0312370849|4.0|Sarah's Key offers readers with a story that hasn't been told, involving an aspect of the Holocaust that most of us are not familiar with:  The Veld'hiv Roundup which took place in July of 1942 in Paris.  I found this story to be heartbreaking as I followed  Sarah's story of the horrifying weeks she endured during this roundup and the pain that lingers the many years that followed after.  Yes, this book will have you tearful throughout, as no human being should have to experience such a nightmare.        The quality that I enjoyed of this tale were the perspectives into the past involving Sarah, and Julia Jarmond's efforts to find out what happened to the young Jewish girl named Sarah Starzynski.      Some of the qualities that I didn't particularly care for were the relationship between Julia and her husband Betrand as she came across weak at times (like a bird with its head in the ground.)  Also I thought Julia's eleven year old daughter Zoe seemed a lot older than she was, based on things she said.  It was slightly unrealistic and I couldn't believe that this child WAS a child.      I've noticed that the ending has had some mixed reviews but personally, I enjoyed the ending and it even had me crying.    SPOILER:  Probably the most emotional moment is the letters that Julia reads towards the end of the book.  I balled my eyes out.      I highly recommend this novel to anyone, but please be warned.  It will take you on an emotional rollercoaster.

B001TODCII|4.0|There are literally thousands upon thousands of films to watch these days; films in any genre that you can possible think of.  Some of these films are great films, some are horrible and some are horrible and great at the same time.  It really all depends upon you mood and what you want to watch at any given time.  Now I normally like romantic comedies or films such as The Princess Bride.  But that being said, I also like a mixture in the type of movies I watch.  I do not like a complete steady diet of just one type.<br /><br />There are times I enjoy seeing a complete bang, bang kill everything in sight type of movie; one where the bad guy is really, really bad and get his or her just reward.  Call them revenge films, retribution films, breaking all the rules films, or what ever.  Now I would not want to watch this sort of film every day, or even ever week or month, but sometimes it can be a good thing.  It seems to satisfy some dark inner beastie lurking somewhere in my psyche.  Well this film filled that need, sort of like a fix, and I will be good to go now to other films for a few months.<br /><br />The story is quite simple; if simple you want it to be.  A young woman joins her good friend and they travel to Paris to spend the summer. This is against the better judgment of her father, played by Liam Neeson, one of my favorite actors.  As chance would have it, the girls are captured by some really evil, despicable, cruel, and thoroughly dislikable men and are to be sold into sexual enslavement.  The father, Neeson, happens to be an ex CIA agent with remarkable skills in seeking people out and killing them in uncounted unique ways, both with his hands and various weapons.  The story is about the father's search for his daughter and his efforts to locate her and restore her freedom.<br /><br />The story starts out rather slow which allows the story and characters to be set up and developed, if you will.  Only one act of violence is shown at first and it is rather mild compared to what is to come.  The entire cast of good guy characters are rather likable, even the ex-wife and her super rich husband who you want to dislike but really don't.<br /><br />Once the story gets started, i.e. the father arrives in Paris, then indeed this becomes a nonstop action thriller.  Like several other reviewers, I completely lost track of the body count after the first ten for fifteen.  These bad guys kept springing up all other and the nice thing about it was that they were the kind of villains you just love to hate.  The Neeson efficiently kills them all, some in groups, some one on one and in various ways using his many skills as needed.  Justice is swift in this little world and absolute. The father seems to be completely free of any restraint what so ever as far as the law goes and what little law there is to stop him is quickly brushed aside.<br /><br />Now is this the best action thriller ever made?  No.  Is this a movie similar to Neeson's past work, such as Schindler's list?  No.  Are the special effects award winning?  No.  Is this a highbrow movie that  you would want to take your date or wife to in order to impress her with your intellectual choice of cinemagraphic art, and set for hours afterwards spouting effusions and pontificating as to its greatness, noting subtle nuances she might have missed?  I don't think so!<br /><br />What this is, is a movie about a guy that kicks a lot of tail, kills a lot of people who richly deserve to be killed, and if you like such movies now and again, you will enjoy this one. It is a fantasy film and the deeds performed by our hero would indeed be quite impossible to perform in real life, or at least quite improbably.  That is what is nice about this film...it is hard core, high violence fantasy with out the blood and gore you are served up in movies such as the never ending Saw movies.  The acting is quite adequate and the story is interesting enough to hold your attention.  Watch if for what itis and just enjoy.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarkse Ozarks
0061864153|5.0|I really enjoyed this book mostly because I've been a huge Bon Jovi fan since '86! This photos are awesome and are on every page throughout the book. The wording is basically quotes from the band telling their story about the life of the band through the years. Definitely pics and stories I never knew about. If you're interested in a more in depth look into who these guys really are and how the feel about eacother and the group, give it a go. It's also a great coffee table book. Large and with great pics with easy reading.
B002OOG6YY|5.0|Thought fans like myself of Manson would like to know that this is NOT just a bluray reissue of the GG&G DVD from a few years back. Remember how that DVD was annoying as it was a weird cut together   of several different shows? Well, this isnt, and it is SO MUCH BETTER. One night, one performance, as it should have been in the first place. If you are a fan of Manson before it started going wrong from GROTESQUE onwards, then this bluray is for you. Great HD quality (1080i though not 1080p) and sound all good as well. We can only hope Manson fins passion again one day as he did on the albums up until this point on this release. Saw his last 2 x tours - he looks bored and going through the motions now onstage, unlike his performance on this GREAT live set. Get it.

B000024C7W|5.0|Let me 1st say that this is the most underappreciated and misunderstood album ever released by Stevie Wonder and one of the true golden moments in his vast and historic catalog.  Coming off the heels of his most celebrated and historical album, \\"Songs In the Key of Life\\", Wonder took his career in a whole new direction, one which stumped many of his fans and critics at the time as many of the greatest of their art routinely do.<br /><br />I for one love this album & thought it had & still does, some of the most thought provoking & etherial content he ever produced and for an artist of his magnitude, that's saying something.  This album truly did introduce a couple of new concepts, \\"New Age Sound\\" & \\"Smooth Jazz\\", and it was something that most weren't ready for at that time.<br /><br />Wonder's overall genius is on total display with this album, lyrics, music compositions, multi instrumental performances, arrangement, production, innovation & creativity.  Most of this album ended up being the soundtrack to the documentary film \\"Secret Life Of Plants\\" which i still haven't seen.  And it caused shock waves throughout the music industry at the time as many were waiting to see what direction he would head on the heels of \\"Songs In The Key Of Life\\".<br /><br />This album is his most exploratory and you can see the development of certain themes that he had dabbled with on previous releases.  Instrumental albums had been released by top artists prior to this and some had enjoyed major success, however, this was the first one to introduce, as the overall album concept, the exotic and mystical sounds & lyrical content that would later be associated with \\"New Age\\" & \\"Smooth Jazz\\" music.  Hence the reason most of the critics of this album didn't get it, this was a concept years ahead of it's time.<br /><br />Beginning with 1971's \\"Where I'm Coming From\\" Stevie had enjoyed total artistic freedom and you could hear his rapid and unprecedented growth as an artist throughout the albums he would release in the rest of the decade.  Each album building on top of the other and leading up to this one which offered new experiments and displayed his knack for \\"pushing the envelope\\".  I always felt like this album was one were he was almost saying that he couldn't be put in a \\"box\\".  This album was never meant to be a \\"Songs In The Key Of Life Part II\\" and he made sure we all understood that point.<br /><br />I find it interesting that many other artists, groups and bands were praised for that type of thought process, however, it seems that many truly were trying to put Stevie back in a \\"box\\" musically and artistically.  After all of his struggles in the 1960's with Motown on obtaining his creative freedom, this album was like a declaration of sorts, Never Again!  I highly recommend this double album to anyone who enjoys instrumenal, Smooth Jazz or New Age type of music.  But take the time to really listen and experience this album and not just rush thru it song after song, you'll be highly inspired and blessed for it.lbums he would release in the rest of the decade.

B00005MCWZ|5.0|According to Wikipedia, the bulk of the album originated from a long free form jam called 'sunshine special' which was broken down into individual tracks with spacey synthesized interludes.  And this certainly makes sense as the music shares the same vibe throughout the record.  But don't let the 'free form jam' tag put you off.  The music is not a chaotic drug fueled mess a la Amon Duul, not by a long shot.  The music has a solid footing in the psych genre, and the improving fits within that structured sound.  It sounds as if the band were playing live in the studio and were locked into a fantastic groove.  The addition of flute, sax, and harmonic to the mix is greatly appreciated by this listener.  It is one of the best examples of psych space rock around and I enthusiastically recommend it.<br /><br />The album comes in two flavors.  There is the 1992 One Way Records mastering, and the 1996 EMI classics remaster.  Most of the ones you'll find for sale come from the 1996 master, and that's a good thing.  The '92 version has a fair amount more compression than the '96 version (replay gain of -6 vs -2).  The '92 version is substantially brighter and more harsh than the EMI mastering.  IMO, the '96 remaster is of audiophile quality, so there is no need to seek out the old version.  Also the newer ones come with 4 bonus tracks, although the only bonus track I really liked was the cover of a Pink Floyd song called Cymbaline.
B002XHN776|5.0|How many times do you hear a \\"great\\" song on the radio and buy the whole album only to be disappointed to find that \\"great\\" song surrounded by a bunch of mediocre at best productions? Don't answer that, it's a rhetorical question. The first time I heard Kings and Queens I was hoping that the rest of the album would follow the tradition of A Beautiful Lie and I am definitely not disappointed. In my opinion This is War takes A Beautiful Lie and improves on it in every aspect. Superb.

0618918248|4.0|I got this book a few years ago when I was perusing the science section in my local book store. It was the most interesting book I found there that day, so I picked it up.    Now, after having read it twice, I will say that The God Delusion is very good overall. Among other things, Dawkins effectively explains the difference between theists, deists, pantheists, and atheists; why the chances of a god existing are probably not 50/50; that people most likely do not get their basic moral precepts from religion; and the fact that even if belief in god is overall positive for mankind, it doesn't mean god actually exists.    However, Dawkins' book is also far from perfect. While he correctly explains that Einstein was not a theist, he attempts to label Einstein (more or less) as an atheist, which Einstein himself vehemently denied. Dawkins also doesn't mention studies indicating that those who are religious seem to be happier, on average, than those who aren't. And Dawkins does a grave disservice to his readers when he tries, as best he can, to pass off his speculations as fact (as he does when discussing religious vs. non-religious peoples' feelings toward death). Someone once said Dawkins pretends to know more than he actually does, and I'm afraid there might be some merit to that criticism, especially with regards to The God Delusion.    Despite these criticisms, Dawkins is clearly an intelligent man and he has a lot of intelligent things to say about religion. He makes a strong case for most of his beliefs, and as long as the reader can keep some of Dawkins' biases in mind, he/she will come away having learned a lot.

B002JIOQCO|5.0|Despite the line up change, this is an excellent sophomoric album from an excellent band.  I'll admit, I was very skeptical at first (I loved Wolfmother's debut and I loved the fact that they were a trio), but after a few listens of \\"Cosmic Egg\\", all of my doubts died away.  This album is totally sick.  By all means.      Andrew Stockdale is a truly talented singer/songwriter/guitarist and it continues to shine on \\"Cosmic Egg\\".  Though the entire album blew me away, these in particular are my absolute favorites:    \\"New Moon Rising\\"    \\"Sundial\\"  \\"10,000 Feet\\"  \\"Pilgrim\\"   \\"Violence of the Sun\\"    This would have to be my \\"album of the year\\" along with Them Crooked Vultures' debut.
B001NXDSLQ|4.0|Good DVD picture and audio transfer. However, content is similar to the earlier edition.  If you want extra footage of this iconic concert, get the Blu-ray edition.
B002MW50KO|3.0|First think of Satchmo doing It's a Wonderful World. Excellent band, musical arrangements, backing vocals and sound quality. Dylan gives it his best, but alas shoulda REHABed that voice. He should go back and rerecord these songs when his throat has cleared cause the guy really can sing. But taken as it is, its  perfect music for Christmas eve as you are sitting lonely in a poor man's bar. I would add that what may come closer to a Dylan Christmas album, is NEW MORNING. It came out in late fall, and was listened to, thru the snow falls of that year. Yes some non winter tunes, however in total....\\"Winterlude this dude thinks yer fine....\\" its a very worthy album of the time...
B0029LHW68|2.0|ok so I was anxious to hear this as I liked beautiful lie, I listened through twice and only actually like 2 songs; hurricane and this is war. I hear a lot of deep thought and war related lyrics but the techno pseudo NIN, Pink Floyd type music is truly awful and doesn't suit the band. Please 30 seconds move on from this, and kudos to the cool album cover.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|Imagine the weight of carrying a beloved sci-fi classic into the future, of making pieces fit, giving it history and veracity, while appealing to new audiences. Imagine overcoming the sometimes campy scenes of the original series, while paying homage to them with some tongue-in-cheek humor. Then, going boldly where no one has gone before, imagine a movie that combines suspense, romance, comedy, tragedy, revenge, and redemption, all within the span of two hours. No wonder this was one of my favorite films of 2009.<br /><br />\\"Star Trek\\" begins with a stirring scene involving Capt. Kirk's father in a showdown with renegade Romulans, who, for unknown reasons, are on the hunt for Spock. Soon we jump forward to the childhoods of James T. Kirk and Spock, watching their lives parallel, discovering the things that will motivate them in years to come. Their eventual meeting is not as warm as one might expect, and the tension between them elevates as Kirk carves out his own path, going against the rules, and rubbing Spock and others wrong in the process. Of course, his brashness needs the balance of Spock's logic, while Spock's logic is not without its downsides. Together, they will form one of the best fictional teams ever.<br /><br />The movie shows its real heart through Kirk and Spock's individual and joint choices to fight the Romulans, who threaten the planet of Vulcan. Both must grow if they are to conquer their own pasts and their future enemies. In the process of fast-paced action and numerous chuckles, we are given peeks into the origins of the other original characters--Sulu, Scottie, Uhura, McCoy, and Chekhov. These moments are never overdone, but slipped seamlessly into the story.<br /><br />I, for one, am a huge fan of what JJ Abrams did with this film, giving us backstory, tying it into the existing Star Trek mythology, and providing new avenues for the story to grow for light years to come. I was hesitant before seeing the film, but now I can only say: \\"Live long and prosper.\\"
B0029LHW68|2.0|I had so much high hopes and anticipation for this album. Wheres the METAL? Wheres the 30STM ENERGY? Don't get me wrong, I am a big fan of creativity and this is a creative album, but 30STM ventured down a musical path that is not to my liking. I love the first and second album! This new album jumped right out of their own genre! Tool and NIN are my other favorite original bands, each time they come out with a new album, they sound very different from their last, in a good way. I'm just not feeling this new album. I can't fully say I'm disappointed, because I respect the band as musicians, but I can say I will not be listening to this new album anywhere near as much as their last albums. I am already awaiting their next, hopefully I will be pleasantly surprised!
B0017HMF6W|5.0|I won't review the movie itself. If you don't know what it's about, go rent it. But I will say that the blu-ray is well worth having if you're a fan. It looks fabulous, far better than previous DVD presentations. If only Hitch were still alive to see it.

B002XHN776|5.0|For general music listeners who haven't tried this band before, This Is War is really worth listening. I have never heard of the band before and gave it a try - I got more than what I could ask for. Beautiful and moody melodies; haven't listened fully to the lyrics, but thus far they seem to be message-laden (obvious in \\"This is War\\" track) yet enjoyable. Great, great album!
B000002U9W|4.0|At the very end of the 1960s, after two fantastic debut albums, Pink Floyd went through a period of musique concrete noodling and sonic collages that held very little appeal for me. With 1970s ATOM HEART MOTHER, the band returned to form, and they clearly changed direction from psychadelic rock to progressive.<br /><br />This new focus is evident right from the start. The \\"Atom Heart Mother Suite\\" suite is 25 minutes long, includes a brass orchestra and chorus, and is broken in to a series of distinct sections which treat its theme different. Though the names of the suite's various movement suggest a livestock story, the work is really an abstract one -- the choir sings only wordless vocalizations. While not as consistently gripping as the later suites \\"Echoes\\" and \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\", this is nonetheless a lot of fun.<br /><br />The next several tracks were written by different individual members of the band. \\"Summer '68\\" by Richard Wright is a reminiscence of a sexual encounter with a groupie, it is memorable for its \\"Hey Jude\\"-like refrain and use of brass instruments and is perhaps the group has come to pure pop. The other two songs are in a gentle, almost pastoral mood. Roger Water's \\"If\\" is an idiosyncratic song about love. \\"Fat Old Sun\\", written and sung by David Gilmour, is one of that guitarist's finest compositions and is the tune from this album that I always come away humming.<br /><br />The weakest point of ATOM HEART MOTHER is the closing track, \\"Alan's Psychadelic Breakfast\\", which consists mainly of some tame instrumental riffing over a man first muttering about what he wants to eat in the morning, and then the sounds of bacon frying and cereal being poured into a bowl. Only for a brief period towards the end of this 13-minute track do we finally reach any kind of compelling music.<br /><br />In later years the band has been pretty hard on ATOM HEART MOTHER, seeing it as an immature effort. Nonetheless, for me this was the first worthy album they released after A SAUCERFUL OF SECRETS, and for fans of Pink Floyd, especially their music of the 1970s, this shouldn't be neglected as it all too often is.L OF SECRETS, and for fans of Pink Floyd, especially their music of the 1970s, this shouldn't be neglected as it all too often is.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is such a great cd.  I found it very calming to listen to.  I just love the story behind it--someone daring to step out and let the world hear their talent.  I get tired of all the hoopala of Hollywood celebs.  I think it's great when \\"common\\" people become a success, have fame and still be humble about it.
B001U7FWM8|5.0|I really didn't know what to expect, except that reviewers seem to like this ursine band.  After the first listen, I was intrigued but not hooked.  However, I wanted to hear it again and again and now I love it.  Tempo changes within songs, lyrics I can relate to (not teenager romance), lilting melodies pulling at me and varied instrumentation create interest.  Veckatimest is music I listen to while in my studio creating, but probably not in my convertible driving with the top down.  Good \\"mood\\" music.
1400063736|5.0|This book is already a classic! It's not only beautifully and lyrically written, but its characters with all their achingly palpable pain, heartbreaking innocence and infectious optimism are impeccably drawn.<br /><br />Colum McCann writes an epic tale of New York City on the 7th of August in 1974. Anchored in the quicksand of corruption and crime and Vietnam, the City looks up to the sky and observes Philippe Petit walk between the World Trade Centers on a tightrope, as free as the sinking City will never be.<br /><br />The event is the lynchpin that holds the book together as it tells the story of various interconnected characters: two Irish brothers living in the Bronx and the Black prostitutes they call \\"friends,\\" a Park Avenue judge and his wife that just lost their only son to war, a group of women mourning their lost sons, four young engineers in Palo Alto hacking fledgling networks, two young artists high on cocaine and delusional grandeur. They live, love, hate, cry, laugh, sell, buy, learn, spit, swear, pray, smile, shoot up, give up, take off, get off, sweat and die as the man above them--an angel, really--live out their true desire to be free, completely unaware they even existed down below; down in the gutter.<br /><br />True to the City they roam, every character in this book has a strong opinion of the man high above them. Some admire him and some resent him. Some don't care enough one way or the other because shenanigans like that were banal and commonplace at best.<br /><br />One of the characters is Corrigan--an Irish Jesuit Priest who moved from Dublin to New York City in the pursuit of God. He's not looking for any God, he wants \\"a fully believable God, one you could find in the grime of the everyday.\\" What he ends up finding instead is social calamity and destitution. A city rotting from the inside out.<br /><br />Corrigan is an innocent dreamer with pure ideals and impossible optimism. Ravaged by the City's embrace, he never once let up. \\"The comfort he got from the hard, cold truth-the filth, the war, the poverty-was that life could be capable of small beauties.\\"<br /><br />Claire--another incredible character in the book--is actively mourning the death of her only son in Vietnam when she hears about the man up high in sky and thinks he's \\"so flagrant with his body. Making it cheap.\\" She resents the man for inviting death at a time she was trying to understand it but couldn't; understand its infinite forms, \\"death by drowning, death by snakebite ... death by memory loss, death by claymore ... death by paper cuts, death by whoreknife, death by poker game ... death by authority, death by isolation, death by genocide, death by Kennedy ... death by signature, death by silence ... death by performance.\\"<br /><br />I will stop and let you discover this special book on your own. Although the story takes place in NYC, it is deeply and commonly American. The early 1970s was uniquely transitional in American history. That's when America lost its innocence, and NYC exemplified that in every way.<br /><br />Having said that, this is also a very NYC story. Colum's descriptions brought the bankrupt city of the '70s to life and captured its enduring spirit in a way I never realized possible.<br /><br />Can't do this book justice talking about it, so I'm going to stop now. Just read it. You simply have to!the filth, the war, the poverty-was that life could be capable of small beauties.\\"    Claire--another incredible character in the book--is actively mourning the death of her only son in Vietnam when she hears about the man up high in sky and thinks he's \\"so flagrant with his body.

1595141979|5.0|The third book in the Vampire Academy by Richelle Mead continues the story of Dhampir Guardian (in training), Rose Hathaway. Rose is shadow-kissed. When the car accident that took Princess Vasilissa Dragomir's family also killed her best friend and guardian, Rose, Lissa unknowingly used her ability to wield spirit magic to bring her back. Lissa is learning more and more about spirit, and Rose is discovering the not-so-awesome side effects of being shadow-kissed.<br />Since Mason's tragic death at the hands of a Strigoi, Rose has been having dark flashbacks. She can't concentrate at practice and her temper is hotter than usual. Being so close to the man she loves and not being able to have him doesn't help her. Then the school is victim to one of the worst Strigoi attacks in history, and everything is at stake.<br /><br />This book is, so far, my favorite. It's action packed, the romance between Rose and Dimitri thickens and Lissa takes on a whole new level of awesome (and scary). I am amazed and inspired by Mead's ability to weave so much into her books. There is always something going on, even when there isn't.
B002LLE3Q8|4.0|Two discs 70,78 minutes each approximately.  Comes in a standard jewel case,with some color photographs of the band on the inside back portion of the case.  The sound in this 2009 version,which was mixed from the original master tapes is clean and crisp.  There seems to be a bit more openess to the sound in this edition,compared to the 2004 release.  The only real change from the original release is an edit of the improv following \\"Moonchild\\".  The booklet is well done,with short,but pertinent information on the tracks.  There is a short overlook at the album from Robert Fripp.  There is also a look at the band from it's beginnings by Sid Smith,which is fairly informative,especially if you aren't familiar with KING CRIMSON's first album.  The original artwork has been preserved,as have the lyrics.  There are also a few black and white photographs of the band from 1969.<br /><br />By now if you've read this far you're probably familiar with this album and it's impact,both on it's original release and through subsequent years.  I vividly remember buying this on vinyl (and the cover-what an attention grabber!) when it first was released as an \\"import\\".  And like many listeners feel (except in the beginning when I had to convince people to give it a listen),the album has never lost it's impact.  But whats great about this release are the bonus tracks on each disc.<br /><br />\\"Moonchild\\" is heard in it's full version,which,finally,is nice to hear.  This ethereal,almost spooky sounding track is even more ethereal in this full version.  \\"I Talk To The Wind\\" is heard in both a duo and alternate version.  The duo version with lovely guitar and flute is very nice,with a slightly different,more delicate feel to it than the original.  A definite highlight of this release.  The alternate version is just that-slightly different in sound,with different solos,but still sticking fairly close to the original.  The vocal,which was mixed perfectly with the instruments,is very nice on this track.  \\"Epitath\\" is heard hear as a backing track,which is nice,but nothing extraordinary.  The final track,\\"Wind Session\\",is full of various sounds,both organic and electronic.  There is also some \\"talk-back\\" from the engineer to whomever is creating this track.  It's an inside look at how parts of this album were created,but musically not totally essential.<br /><br />The second disc contains the 2004 mix of the complete album-nothing really new here.  The bonus tracks on this disc give an inside look into how this album was constructed.  The first bonus track is the instrumental backing of \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\",which even without the vocal is impressive to hear,especially considering the era when this music was recorded.  \\"I Talk To The Wind\\" is heard here from a BBC session,and the overall sound of this track is fairly flat and distant sounding.  But it's still a nice addition-hearing a live,period recording from a unique (at the time) band,that straddled both rock and progressive music.  \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\",also from A BBC session is better sounding,though sonically still a little weak.  Again,its nice to have this version appended to this release,especially Fripp's ripping guitar,and Ian McDonald's horn out front of that great rhythm section.  \\"In The Court Of The Crimson King\\",Parts 1 and 2 are both heard here in their mono single versions.  They are reproduced from a vinyl source,and are heard as originally split,into two sides of a 7\\" vinyl single.<br /><br />If you liked this album in the past,you're going to like this version.  For once the price seems fair for what's included,and is probably the definitive look at this album.

B002RV01Q8|4.0|I'm not sure that Enya can be defined by \\"Greatest Hits\\", though she's had a few hit singles. Certainly, the hits are here on the CD, along with some more obscure tracks. Her music is best experienced via the original albums.     As for the DVD, disregard  what one other reviewer said about the \\"Enya:A Life in Music\\" documentary not being included. It IS included. On the main DVD menu, go to \\"Extras\\", then click on \\"documentary\\". Having never seen an Enya interview, I was pleased, because she comes across as a very charming, down to earth, genuine person. The DVD stops 2 or 3 songs short of being a complete collection of Enya videos, which is regrettable. However, my main criticism is that there was some sloppiness during mastering which results in a half second of audio being lopped off at the end of 4 of the 13 videos, as if someone had prematurely pushed the \\"stop\\" button. I wonder if foreign releases of the DVD also have this defect. After the many years that fans on this side of the world have waited for an Enya DVD, for the mastering of this DVD to have any flaws is inexcusable. The audio is presented with a choice of stereo, Dolby surround or DTS surround. Whether this is a genuine surround mix or merely an upmix from the original stereo mixes, it is spacious sounding, and enhances the enjoyment of the videos.

B002XHN776|5.0|Being a person of 1960's vintage, it takes a bit to get me excited about new music.    But, this album being offered upon it's release for $[...] shows why Amazon does this - to introduce new music to new fans.    When I first saw the description, I almost didn't go to the \\"special deals\\" page. When I did, I was very impressed by the 30 second teasers, so I downloaded it at the $[...] special price.    Oh wow, did I get my money's worth. I am somewhat struck by what seems to me to be that it is a \\"concept\\" album - somewhat akin to Pink Floyd's several albums - not that some hit-worthy singles might not arise from this album. But it so \\"new\\" in its sound and yet pleasing to the ears - I cannot say enough about it.     I highly recommend this album and am planning on it as a stocking stuffer for my 11 year-old grandson as well.    Silverfox229
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I was never a big star trek fan, but i would watch a little bit every now and then. I thought that the episodes were a little to slow for me especially since i was like maybe five or six,but this movie is pretty good. This movie really makes me want to go back and rewatch the whole star trek series...the story was pretty good,the acting was also good,and it had a pretty realistic feel to it. I also really liked the fact that there was just enough comedy in this movie and not to much to where it would take away from the story...overall it is a pretty good movie and i would recommend it...
B0029LHW68|5.0|This is a really good CD from 30 seconds to Mars. I like it better than all of their previous albums. It just has a better sound to it. I don't have the album yet, but I've heard all of it. They have risen to a new high in music in my opinion.
B002FRNCG0|5.0|This is simply one of the best albums I own. If you're a Paramore fan, this is a no-brainer - I'd be shocked if you didn't like it (and I AM shocked by a couple mediocre reviews from said fans). If you're considering this as your first Paramore album, good choice!    I couldn't ask for a better sequel to Riot. It's pretty similar stylisticly, except a little more mature. I didn't picture high school and I wasn't reminded of Avril Lavigne like I was sometimes on Riot (i.e. Misery Business). That's a plus for me considering I'm in my late 20's. (although Paramore did contribute twice to the Twilight soundtrack - I guess I can't escape the younger crowd altogether). A couple slower songs also also add to this maturity and add variety to the album.     I love the emotion of Paramore and singer Haley. She can go from passionate, to angry, to reflective, and I'm hanging on every word. Some say this album is \\"darker and more serious\\" than previous ones - I totally disagree. After listening to this I feel upbeat and pumped. A couple songs, like Where the Lines Overlap, just radiate good vibes (chorus \\"no one is as lucky as us\\"). If that's dark and serious than I don't know what happy is.    Bottom line: If you're at all interested in Paramore or pop/punk bands, buy this album.
B002MW50KO|5.0|Bob's voice has been attacked forever, since he hit the NY scene in 1961. From the first, I loved him for his voice. As he says on Together Through Life, \\"Some people say I have the blood of the land in my voice.\\" He does. In this album he has the Love of the Spirit in his voice. I do not like Christmas music, but for the first time ever, I've been able to enjoy standards like Little Drummer Boy because Bob's voice shows me the fear and vulnerability and \\"littleness\\" of the little drummer boy. \\"I'll be Home for Christmas\\" is heart-breaking in it's portrayal of a lonely person far from home imagining the warmth and joy of a Christmas he can only dream about. You don't have to transcend Bob's voice to love this album, you just need to be able to genuinely hear it and feel it. This religious agnostic/atheist thanks you Bob for a wonderful Christmas gift. Peace, brother.
0783225547|5.0|I got this movie as a gift for the holidays about a year ago and as soon as I began to watch it I loved it.  From the moment the movie starts to the time it ends, this film is packed with edge of your seat entertainment.  The scene where the volcano first begins to erupt is overall my favorite part of the movie, although toward the end with the pyroclastic cloud ramming through the town of Dante's Peak is also a exciting time.  The acting is great, the special effects are great, pretty much everything about the movie is great.  Overall I give this film 5 stars based on acting, special effects, directing, and sound.
B00004WIDQ|5.0|Jurassic Park, the movie; a timelessly masterful work from Steven Spielberg. My copy from Amazon.com; a perfectly flawless one. I will continue to search Amazon for all the movies I am inclined to forever love. Thank you Amazon; I'm happy that you are here.  Adisa Achaki.
B0029O0BKO|5.0|Whoa, hey! Hey, remember that movie \\"Kramer vs. Kramer\\"? Yeah, that was about child custody, too. Yeah, but it wasn't that good. I don't know, it was missing something, you know? Ah, what was it missing? I can't.. oh, wait! I know! Arm wrestling!
B000K4X5XA|3.0|Oops! Amazon.com; something went wrong. I know I will love seeing this original Christopher Reeve movie again, but this is the first time for me that you've goofed. Blu-ray was not what I ordered; I've sent it back, hoping that regular DVD format will be re-sent to me. Thanks for listening, Amazon.com.  Sincerely and respectfully, Adisa Achaki.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game is absolutely amazing, it has everything a strategy game needs.  The game is short so you don't have to worry about being tied down for hours and hours, most games are about 30-60 minutes depending on the amount of players.  This game is great and the trading with other players adds a whole new dimension to the game.  This is finally a strategy game where the dice have little to do with the outcome of the game, its the person with the best strategy that wins.  This game is very addicting and i would recommend it to any one who loves board games.
0375851569|5.0|Great childrens book collection and it was delivered quickly.  The books can be kept easily organized in the cardboard case that they came in.  I would recommend this book collection for grandparents like ourselves to purchase for grandchildren between 1 and 8 years old.
B00007KWHG|4.0|Saw the stage play \\"Jersey Boys\\" and loved it, was going to buy a cd at the show, but they were way to pricey. Tickets for the show were outrageous! I think they are paying off the national debt! Purchased 2 cd's from Amazon. 1 as a gift, 1 for myself. they are great. Forgot they had so many good songs & the price of the cd's was perfect. Thanks Amazon!
B000I2JKC4|5.0|This is a great movie to watch over and over.  There  are a few parts unsuitable for under 10 but for the most part it is very funny and entertaining. It is   a good light hearted look at the craziness that having  extended family for Christmas can bring. I would   recommend this movie for a family night!
3836501899|5.0|Most readers will likely be overwhelmed and delighted from reading the   \\"Polaroid Book, Selections from the Polaroid Collections of Photography\\" not only   because of the visual appeal and variety of technical use with the images, but in   discovering how Edwin Land, the inventor, and Ansel Adams, the photographer, met  and how Adams became an integral part of the Polaroid Company.    The two met in 1948 as the first Polaroid \\"Land\\" camera was introduced to the world   providing photographs that gave an instant image to the photographer. No more   waiting for photographs by sending film off for processing.    Land hired Adams as an artistic consultant. His assignment: test cameras, film and   related photographic paraphernalia in the field and in the studio and report back.    Edwin Land finds not only a colleague and life-long friend in Ansel Adams, but a most   admired artist--a label that Land felt suited him as well. Both were captured by the art   of photography.    Adams began collecting photographs to be used as the \\"standard\\" of which to   compare the \\"Polaroid\\" results. Work by famous photographers such as Minor White,  Eliot Porter, Laura Gilpin, and Margaret Bourke-White, and others, were purchased as   \\"the Library Collection\\". This collection grew as relatively unknown photographers'   work was added which evolved into what is now \\"the Polaroid Collections\\".    This body of work wasn't simply the routine, the established, the expected of each  photographers' particular style. It evolved into experiments with often breath-taking   outcomes.    Ink was added, the images were painted upon, chemicals were added, film was frozen,   dyes and pastels were played with, and actual piercing of the photographs occurred.   Just about anything that one could think of doing to the film and images was done.     The results are more than surprising. At first blush, it would be inconceivable to think   that the use of instant photography was able to produce such a collection. So many of   the techniques emulate a standard, manually controlled camera with timed images,   double- and multiple-exposures, and unique lighting. Many are surreal.    In addition, the book provides a brief historical timeline of the Polaroid cameras and  milestones made with different types of cameras, film and processes.    I highly recommend this book as a guide, a resource, and an inspiration, to all who are   stirred by visual medium.    The images in this book will certainly spark a reaction.
B0020TS5LK|5.0|First of all I don't know why this movie has not been released in the US in Blu Ray. This edition came of out Canada. This movie is GREAT and the Blu Ray transfer is awesome. Someone said that the US version when ever it's released on Blu Ray(don't hold your breath) will have deleted scenes. A lot of time the deleted scenes are NOT worth the wait. Most of the time they are a waste of money. If you don't care about extras...get this copy on Blu Ray now.
B001EOQWF8|3.0|You will love this movie if A) you have a grasp of the technical achievement it represents; B) you love subtle social commentary; C) you are really into saving the planet or D) you have a virtual pet. Otherwise, you might be caught checking your watch.
B0021L8UQ2|5.0|This is an awesome movie that did not get it's proper justice in the movie theaters. It's a great Blu Ray copy. This is a must have for your collection.
0783230079|5.0|Downey does such a good job in this. The boardroom scene alone is worth the ticket price. Family friendly, not your typical plot line. So many talented, familiar faces in the cast. Good date night movie.
B000ZECQ08|2.0|I dislike negative reviews, but not all of them can be flowers and lollipops.  Seems like as the sequels went, the story got worse.  Maybe I'm missing something but this one was slow, uninteresting and boring.  The best part of the movie was the last 15 minutes, and that was a stretch.  I own all the others, but won't be adding this one to my library.  IMO, if it weren't produced, it wouldn't be missed.
B000ZELISO|2.0|Luckily, most HP fans read the books, because you would be mislead and lost here trying to figure out the story, present--and most importantly, for the future of the series.<br /><br />Some changes were just stupid, not paralyzing Harry during the climatic scene, for example.  Some make a certain kind of sense, not having the Hogwarts battle in this movie, saving it for the great finale in the last book (movie) and perhaps that is why they added the Burrows fight.  I didn't really mind the Burrows fight for that reason, since it was consistent with the tone of the book, but allowed the BIG Hogwart's fight that is coming to (perhaps) have more of an impact.<br /><br />Others have detailed the other horrid omissions, so I won't recap them all here.  One that REALLY bugged me was not having the Snape, \\"DON'T CALL ME A COWARD!\\" Harry scene.<br /><br />They should have also explained the constant dreary foggy look of the movie, at least a throw away comment from a muggle, or about muggles not understanding the weather.  Hogwarts has always been able to control it's internal weather though, and a few sharp, clearly photographed, colorful scenes would have been a RELIEF to see once or twice during this visually dull movie.<br /><br />WAY too much Quiddich!  It's never worth sacrificing story for that crap--and this director did.<br /><br />Pretty disappointing, but I am FURIOUS that those with DVD players don't get to see the extras!  THAT is marketing at it's worst, and it is infuriating.
B0026PW67W|4.0|I am very impressed with the map- it is printed on thick, parchment-type paper and looks hand drawn.  I purchased mine from the Noble Collection (through Amazon) and was very happy with the way that the Map was packaged and the shipping speed.  My map arrived well before the expected delivery date.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because when folded, the wording on the front of the map doesn't quite match up right.  I've tried to fix it by refolding the Map, but it just keeps going back to the way it came.  It's not so bad that I would return it, but if you're a perfectionist it might bother you. Very nice item for a Harry Potter fan.
B002CVQAX6|5.0|This horror film is nothing more than a music video for those with short attention spans.  Yet the story is captivating enough and the ship is most unsettling.  Give it a go if you want a popcorn flick to stir your senses.  The montage (complete with hard rock score)  where the ghost girl shows Julianna Margulies how the ship became rife with spirits is worth the purchase price alone.
B0029LHW68|5.0|\\"This Is War\\" is excellent! This is another excellent album from 30 Seconds To Mars. All of the tracks on here are excellent!    Track Listing  1. Escape  2.

B001AII4RM|1.0|I worked on this movie so I was excited to own it.  But guess what, the disc won't read in my computer's blu-ray drive.  The firmware is current, and plenty of other blu-ray discs read fine.  This format is crap, really isn't ready for release yet.  Thanks, Paramount!
B002IYEQR4|3.0|So I hadn't read the comic prior to the movie coming out.  I know several people who did and they'd always spoken very highly of it.  Once I heard that it was coming to theaters, I decided against it so as not to sway my opinion of the movie -- I didn't want it suffer the \\"not as good as the book\\" and \\"they left this and this and this out\\" sort of deal.  So I saw the movie in the theaters, and I freaking loved it.  Best movie of the year until District 9 and then Zombieland in my opinion.  Just phenomenal film, very interesting, excellent cinematagraphy, sfx, great characters, gritty and dark feel -- just an all around great movie that went well above my expectations.    I was pumped when it was to be released on blu-ray Director's Cut, but I heard that they'd be releasing the \\"Ultimate Edition\\" near year's end so I figured I'd wait and see what we ended up with.  I later heard it was going to push 200+ minutes of total video into the film and I was ecstatic and so I waited all this time.    I pre-ordered the Ultimate Edition and it arrived promptly (rock on Amazon) and couldn't wait to throw it in and watch it in glorious 1080p.  Well, after watching the full monstrosity that it is, I can safely say it sort of ruined the whole of the movie for me.  Very little of this 3+ hour behemoth added anything to the value of the Watchmen experience, and it moreso detracted from it.    The \\"Tales of the Black Freighter\\", which I hadn't seen prior to the Ultimate Edition, is by far one of the lamest things I've ever seen.  The best part about it was the narration, as Gerard Butler lent his voice to at least make it something you could turn the TV off and listen to if you really need.  The whole of the video was just gross for the sake of being gross 98% of the time you're watching anything on screen.  If it would've been cgi rather than animated, people would be throwing up watching it -- seriously, it's really THAT bad.  I'm sorry, but it's just overly gross and graphic (thiscoming from a fan of Rikki-Oh, Starship Troopers, and the theatrical Watchmen) and adds ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to the live-action Watchmen experience, especially when one minute you're in the Watchmen world and the next you're watching CGI waves and shoddy, low-budget animation.  I really have to wonder what Snyder was thinking when he signed off on it.  Also, the way it was shoved into the movie just didn't work.  You can tell they really did make an effort to transition back and forth, but it ended up forcing dumb extra scenes to make it happen and they all just really, REALLY detract from the overall experience.  This portion of the movie alone gives me buyer's remorse, bleh.    I'm usually a big fan of deleted scenes in movies; I love to get that extra bit of info, etc., but unfortunately, all of the scenes that were removed from the theatrical version to make it more coherent, valid, and interesting, really have no business being in the movie at all.  They just make the flow of the movie grind to a halt (save for the scene with Spectre escaping, imo) and I really can't disagree with Snyder/the producers for having removed them from the theatrical version in the first place.    Other features:  I'm sure they're all great, but after sitting down and watching 3+ hours of a movie I'm not happy with, the last thing I want to do is watch the extras.    Overall verdict:  If you like Watchmen, and really liked the Director's Cut and the \\"tales\\" then you'll probably love this.  If you're one of those people, however, you should probably seek some sort of help.
B001KVZ6FW|1.0|I watch all of my movies on my computer.  In this case, however, the DVD is so corrupted with draconian copy protections that I cannot even get it to start.  Buyer beware!
1594481717|1.0|The self-important \\"management class\\" feels that this book validates what they have been trying to sell as their core values.  They LOVE THIS BOOK.<br /><br />Lets be realistic.  Can America survive as a nation of \\"right brained, higher thinkers\\", having out sourced all the knowledge work to asian countries?  This glorified notion of americans as some sort of uber-directors, divinely gifted with the ability to rule is laughable.<br /><br />Other nations design.  Other nations create.  Right brained thinking is at a premium in every culture.<br /><br />I think a better approach would be to advocate balance.  Right brained thinking, the entrepreneurial spirit that made America great is,  AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN important.  Nothing new here.  But let us respect other forms of thinking, and recognize that right and left brained thinking are not mutually exclusive.<br /><br />Lets not go off the deep end, by glorifying america as a nation of super directors.  The brainy kid who programs computers is still of more value to the economy than your average middle manager.  The sad truth is that the management class has figured out (and can sadly justify) how to outsource his job.  However, make no mistake, the right-brained positions, can and are being outsourced.<br /><br />The only jobs that cannot be outsourced are service positions.<br /><br />Let us seek balanced teams, with talent from every tier of the problem solving chain.  Let us not fall prey to the divine right and arrogance of a caste system with \\"right brained thinkers\\" at the top.<br /><br />Frankly, I will take raw IQ over either left or right brained disposition.
B001KVZ6ES|5.0|now i am not a clint eastwood fan. he was great in The good the bad the ugly and also in dirty harry. i never this man to last so long in the movie industry spewing out one hit after another. i just watched his latest offering Gran Torino. i am BLOWN AWAY. i will recommend this movie to fans and non-fans alike. this movie is like a comedy drama. the drama builds up so much tension that when the comedy comes, i literally burst out laughing out so loud!!<br />i'll leave the story for you to read in the synopsis. eastwood is still at the top of his game and totally convincing as the disgruntled, racist, war vet. what is likeable about him is his blunt honesty. he is a racist. admits it but when he has a reason to like his neighbors, he admits that too. very realistic movie. the end was very interesting. not what i would have expected at all. but totally justified. in the end credits there is a song sung by eastwood himself. never heard him sing before. but couldn't help listening to the whole song. its a movie about a man who has been living with ghosts in his head, the only woman who ever loved him is his wife, now he is left with his second love, his 1972 Gran Torino!!
B002PMV9FG|3.0|I have to say I was extremely disappointed in the movie adaptation of the Half Blood Prince to say the least! The Burrough burning down! What does that have to do with anything, least of all the story? Nothing, doesn't even make sense.     Like many of the other reviewers, I was sorely let down by the fight at Hogwarts and the death of Dumbledore. First, how could they have cut out Harry being paralyzed by a spell from Dumbledore to immobilize him from trying to save him?  If Harry wasn't paralyzed into inaction he would have fought to his death to save Dumbledore. That is who Harry is, not some sniveling weakling fretting over the obvious demise of his hero and mentor.  He NEVER would have just stood there, NEVER!     What about the battle that took place between those living at Hogwarts, the auror's, and the death eaters?  That was a pivitol and extremely important part of the book, a defining moment, and they just chopped it right out!  UGH!     How in the name of all that is holy could they even think of cutting out Dumbledore's funeral? What were they thinking?  Here is one of the MOST IMPORTANT characters of the whole series, dead, and they spend no time on it at all!  How could they cut that?! Inconceivable! I truly resent it actually. Talk about ruining it. I swear if they add the funeral at the beginning of movie 7, which results in taking up precious filming time(because it should have been in film 6, not Harry trying to pick up some chick and various other stupid add ins),my head will spin around!     Dear director, could you please NOT ruin film 7 by adding your stupid and pointless point of views? Just stick to the book, give us the funeral IF you still intend to stick to all of the important parts of book 7, tell us the story as Rowling intended(her way is brilliant) or I will write you a real letter cursing your career! We, as fans, have been waiting a long time for the conclusion of this story, please care enough about us to give us the story as Rowling intended it! There is absolutely no need to change or add anything!    What about the love story between Harry and Ginny? How could they change that? It was incredible in the book and so sweet. By the time they got together in the book you were soooo ready for it. Thanks movie, for ruining that too. UGH!  How could you leave out Dobby and Kreacher who have major parts in book 7? Huge disappointment.    Let's pray they do justice to book 7 in the movie adaptation. I truly want it to be epic!  It deserves to be; for us the fans, for J.K. Rowling(whom I hoped complained alot about movie 6), for Daniel Radcliffe and the other actors whom have given their young lives to this project, and for the amazing story itself. Please director do not blow it!    Okay I've vented!(at least I still have the books) Thanks for listening.  Here's to the brillant movie for book 7.... I believe! :)
B001MYIXAC|3.0|This title was recommended to me by a friend who did not read the book, but loved the movie.  I purchased the book first and got through it quickly because i enjoyed it so much.  I was excited to purchase and watch the movie when I was done reading, but was disappointed.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|\\"Up\\" is another remarkable Pixar animated feature.  What a great idea to have the 4 Disc Combo Pack include a Blu-ray disc along with the digital and DVD copy.  A great idea for those of us who don't yet have a Blu-ray disc player but intend to get one soon.  The movie itself is another winner for Pixar.  A balloon floated house, an elderly man, a young boy, talking dogs, a compelling story and enough action to keep the youngest viewer interested - all come together to make \\"Up\\" one of the front runners for next year's Academy Awards.  A must buy.
B000002UR7|2.0|I own Kid A and OK Computer and I love them. I have heard most of hail to the theif and it is excellent, so I heard Creep and decided to get Pablo Honey. This album doesn't stand up to the albums I've herad, it has less of their creative use of computer generated sound and the songs tend to sound too whiney,sad and very 90's rock without it. I listen to it 3 times and dedcided to get rid of it. sad.
B001LRJH0U|5.0|My husband and I first viewed this movie at our local theater and really liked it. Recently, a friend mentioned how much they liked it, which prompted me to order it from Amazon for my DVD collection. We have now watched it for the second time and found it to be even better the second time around. I highly recommend it to those who love good westerns. You won't be disappointed.
0553451464|5.0|This is regarding the audio book performed by acting legend John Gielgud.  I love Dickens's \\"A Christmas Carol\\".  It's one of my very very favorite stories, and I love this audio version, but I see references to other performers and formats in the reviews on this page.  Do Not Confuse this version with any of those others.  I have _this_ version on CD.  I wish I could find it.  I listen to it many times each Christmas season.  Audio quality is good. His performance is rich and wonderful.  It _is_abridged_ which I don't like,  but I still recommend it.   John Gielgud is _more_ than worth it (If you don't know him, he was the butler in the movie \\"Arthur\\" starring Dudley Moore.)
0307271757|5.0|As a collector of Everyman's Library, I am thrilled to purchase this volume. It includes: A Christmas Carol, The Chimes, The Cricket on the Hearth, The Battle of Life, and The Haunted Man. I look forward to reading these timeless tales this holiday season.    Thank you Everyman's Library for offering this lovely volume of Dicken's classics in your collection.
B001CC7PKS|5.0|One of the best comic book movies I have ever seen. It is dark, gritty, violent and fun. One thing is for certain, if you've never seen the Daredevil Director's Cut you're missing out on a great film. It's remarkably better than its theatrical release and I remember that the theatrical version received two thumbs up from Ebert & Roeper. Imagine how much they would love this improved version? I'm glad they didn't include a copy of the initial release on Blu-Ray. That film should be ignored. Honestly, the DD DC is one of the best comic based films regarding any origin. It's better than Batman Begins, Spider-Man and Superman. It looks great in Blu-Ray and should be on any action/comic book fans top ten list all-time.
B001V7YWTQ|4.0|I heard Clapton say not too long ago that he had lost his chops and could not longer play like he did when he was 20 or so.  Well, you couldn't prove that by how he plays here!  He is amazing.  \\"Voodoo Chile\\" is out of this world, I actually was driving and had to pull off the road because I could not trust myself driving listening to this song, it is incredible...Clapton's solo is unbelievable.  On \\"Cocaine\\", Winwood's piano solo is amazing - truly a great CD. But like any other CD, there will be songs you like and songs you don't like - you can't please everyone all of the time.  But overall, just terrific.
B002PMV9FG|3.0|If you are looking for the special features, deleted scenes, etc, do not buy this version of the movie. It consist of only the following:<br /><br />1. 45 minutes or more of advertising for Harry Potter stuff and other movies which starts playing as soon as you insert the disk<br />2. The main movie itself<br /><br />That's it. No special features. They used the space on the disk for advertising instead.
1423113497|5.0|My son has been absolutely sucked into these books. He is 10 years old and feels forced to read. While he was off track, one of the rules we had for him was that he had to read 50 pages a day. He finished the first three books during his off track time and is almost done with the fourth. He just can't get enough and he is already sad that there is only one more book in the series.     I would totally recommend this series to anyone who has a boy about the same age!
0393061310|4.0|The author is on firm ground when he develops his case for the ultimate reasons of the differences in technological and structured societies in pre-history. But as he approaches modern times, he walks on thin ice. He argues that a given society's receptivity and drive for innovation is dependent on so many diverse factors that we should consider it a random variable. That's disappointing. His work tries to build an explanation for the difference to counter the thesis of white people's genetic  superiority. But he is ready to admit, with very weak arguments, that hunters-gatherers possibly have superior intelligence to whites. So, after all, a few thousand years may be enough for natural selection to improve the intelligence in human beings! If that were true, the opposite could also be true. I think that hard to believe, but I have no scientific evidence to discard it.   I fear that Diammond dares to propose the superior intelligence of hunter-gatherers because it is safe to do so in our politically correct times.
B0007DFJ0G|4.0|I was in one of those moods when I picked this up.  I just wanted to watch a movie about fighting, so why not watch one called \\"Fight Club\\"?  I was really excited about seeing this, too, being a big fan of Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter.<br /><br />The majority of the movie was really great, it kept me watching because of the great mixture of drama, comedy, and violence.  The only problem was that the ending was quite unexpected.  I'm not going to say what happened (just in case you haven't seen it yet), but I will let you know that it actually made me think...which was not what I wanted to do at that time.  That was my first time watching it.<br /><br />The second time, I enjoyed it even more.  The acting is amazing, the story line is great, but it has a deeper ending than you would come to expect from a movie about a Fight Club.  Just as a warning for when you go and rent it...because you definitly should.  This is on the list of movies that you have to see before you die.<br /><br />Just saying.
0061703257|4.0|United States Marshal Teddy Daniels lost his wife to a tragic apartment complex fire. The fire was arson. Andrew Laeddis, the man responsible for setting the fire was sent away. That isn't good enough for Teddy. He hoped to get his revenge.<br /><br />Teddy and his new partner, Chuck are assigned to check out the disappearance of Rachel Solando. She is a patient at the Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane located on Shutter Island. Rachel is very dangerous. She drowned her three children and then propped their dead bodies up at the dinner table.<br /><br />Teddy and Chuck find a note left behind, written by Rachel. It says:<br /><br />The Law of 4<br /><br />I am 47<br />They were 80<br /><br />+You are 3<br /><br />We are 4<br />  But<br />Who is 67?<br /><br />Teddy asks Dr. Cawley, if there is a sixty-seventh patient at the hospital. He assures Teddy that there isn't. So then, why does Rachel believe there is and if so...where is patient sixty-seven?<br /><br />Shutter Island is the first novel, I have read by Mr. Lehane but it is not the first movie, I have watched, several of Mr. Lehane's novels that have been made into a movie like Mystic River and Gone Baby Gone. I didn't quite care for Mystic River and thought Gone Baby Gone was pretty good. So, you can imagine my reluctance to try reading a novel, though as we all know books are usually better then the movies. Well, the good news is that I absolutely enjoyed this book, so much that I had a hard time putting it down. I thought for sure I had it all figured out what was happening to Teddy. I was half right. The ending came as a surprise in a good way. Shutter Island gave me the shutters. I can't wait to check out more novels by Mr. Lehane.
B00005JKN9|4.0|The battle for control of the Five Points slum in New York in the mid-1800's kicks this movie into a grudge that spans over fifteen years.  Leonardo DiCaprio plays young Amsterdam Vallon who, as a boy, witnessed his father's murder during the battle between two rival gangs, the Natives (those born in the America) and the Dead Rabbits (the immigrants), for control of the Five Points.  William Cutting, also called \\"Bill the Butcher,\\" is the man who cuts down Amsterdam's father.  Daniel Day-Lewis plays Cutting, the leader of the Natives and a very anti-immigrant man who is feared by everyone in the slum of Five Points.  Fifteen years after the great battle, the Dead Rabbits are banned, Amsterdam's father is dead, and Amsterdam himself is coming back from having disappeared since the battle.  No one recognizes him and he uses this to his advantage.  He is able to get close to Cutting and prepares for when the moment is right to exact his revenge.<br /><br />Overall, this movie was just amazing.  I am not normally a fan of movies that have the main plot line of killing.  Very few movies have been able to keep my attention for over two hours.  Many have tried, but most have failed.  This movie, however, clocking in at 2 hours and 40 minutes, kept my attention the entire time.  My heart sank when I opened the DVD case and saw that there were two disks sitting there, each labeled \\"Feature Film\\".  This movie was so long that it needed two disks?  The only movie I had ever seen that required two disks to house the entire feature film was Stephen King's Rose Red, and that was only because it clocks in closer to four hours.  This was going to be a long night.<br /><br />When it reached the end of the first disk, however, I was surprised.  I did not feel like an hour and a half of my life had been slowly taken from me, as I sat in front of my television.  Overall, I believe that this movie truly did deserve the ten Oscar nominations that it got.  Daniel Day-Lewis was phenomenal playing \\"Bill the Butcher\\", the story line was easy to follow and yet it still kept you wanting to know how it would end, and the movie itself deserved the Best Picture nomination that it got.the Butcher\\", the story line was easy to follow and yet it still kept you wanting to know how it would end, and the movie itself deserved the Best Picture nomination that it got.

B00168OIOE|5.0|this movie with Billy Crystal and John Goodman is one of my favorite Pixar films.  It's fun to watch with children or with adults.  Highly recommend it!
B002QH2NUA|5.0|All I can say, what a magnificent concert/ production, watched this on a 24 inch i Mac with Bose speakers and WOW !!!!
B000WQWPKA|4.0|Independence Day is pretty much a perfect example of a \\"Summer Blockbuster\\" done exceedingly well.  Sit back and enjoy very well done entertainment. The one caveat on this particular BluRay release is that it's the Theatrical Release and _not_ the Director's Cut.  That's a big disappointment because the Director's Cut was significantly better in terms of providing lots of little vignettes which deepened that standard Summer Blockbuster story line.  Hopefully they'll eventually release the Director's Cut on BluRay.
0425220931|5.0|Anyone who criticizes this book because of Victors complete failure to explain how he became one of the world most accomplished bass players is absolutely right, but I think they're ignoring the point he's trying to make.  Victors whimsical semi-fiction stories about the different music lessons that he stumbled upon for a diverse group of teachers are calling readers to action, demanding that they start opening their minds and ears in order to really understand music.  He never makes the claim that his abilities came purely from these chance meetings, and anyone who has seen Vic live or heard his recordings knows that he's spent countless hours mastering technique- it's implied and typical, so he doesn't address it.  There's no magical formula to speeding up scales and arpeggios, it just takes practice, so rather than write about his practice habits, Victor rights about how motivational teachers took his spiritual growth to new levels, allowing him to get in touch with higher music.  His book focuses on the core ideas behind musical creation that so many musicians forget about in the quest for perfect technique, and is therefore a perfect read for anyone trying to fully realize every step of the path to mastery.  Nobody can argue with Victor's skill, so it's definitely worth the time to see what he has to say about his patch to musical and personal growth.
B002RBZ13Q|4.0|The Venue is amazing, the blu ray high def, is amazing , if you have a decent home theater , it feels like you are right there. I just wish that the majority of Americans got into this kind of music as much as the Europeans, it made me want to buy a ticket to London and see a show !
B000002C2G|5.0|A classic from the maestro. Includes 'Not Dark Yet'- one of the tracks he will be remembered by. He does what he likes and he has earned the right to do so.
B002PMV9FG|1.0|I liked the first two Harry Potter films, but each of the subsequent ones has become less and less interesting to me.  Three-quarters of the way through this DVD, I got distracted and started balancing my checkbook.  That mundane task was more captivating than the movie.  I guess my attention wandered in part because the movie seems to take itself very seriously, without giving me a reason to join in that sentiment.  After a while, all the cgi storm clouds and magic mumbo jumbo just began to blend together into a big pile of \\"I can't relate to this and I don't much care.\\"  All the charm, wit, and inventiveness of the early films seems to have been lost, and now the focus is just on the struggle with Voldemort, which is really not very engaging.  In the early films, it just gave the characters something to do while we got to know them and their world.   Now it's nearly all there is.  At least this DVD had some love story to provide human interest, so that was a bright spot.  But I wonder: if this was the first Harry Potter film I'd ever seen, would I feel compelled to go back and watch the others?  I think not.
B0019LY5IM|3.0|less episodes, more expensive, way cheaper packaging. any real fan of this show has them tivo's or downloaded and burned. i am boycotting buying this until the studio realizes they ruined the box set.
B001F0VHEM|4.0|I liked her voice on all the songs.I thought her bad girl song *Bad Influence was one of the best on disc.Tracks 1-5 kind of sounded like filler to me though.The strong language in *Funhouse did not appeal to me and was not needed.Then again I am not a high school student or collage freshmen who may get a kick out of cranking up this song with the F-word in it for shock value.I have heard this word before so no shock.Just cheapened the music.
1416583408|2.0|I read \\"Inside of a Dog\\" after reading the glowing review in the Washington Post.  What a disappointment.  The book's an awkward mix of the science behind dog behavior and the author's anecdotes of her own dog.  For the first few chapters, I thought it might be the prelude to a good read, but the pieces never fell into an enjoyable narrative.
B00009RDGA|5.0|The black and white images are worthy of John Ford.  The humor is worthy of Mark Twain.  The performances are subtle and brave.   Wonderful, heartfelt, delightful, and sad.
B001PO53IO|5.0|Clone Wars Season 1 is great!  Sure there are some cheesy parts with battle droids and Jar Jar Binks in some of the first few episodes, but after the team behind Clone Wars gets some episodes under their belt they really get good.  The thing that makes me like Clone Wars so much is that it reminds me of the original 3 Star Wars movies.  The special features make you understand why because the people making this actually care about making it feel like the originals.  The special features are great and some of the episodes are extended cuts.  There is even a booklet inside the case that showcases some of the artwork.  The Clone Wars looks great in 1080p and the 5.1 sound is good too.  Overall, the series is very well put together and is more enjoyable without the commercial breaks.  It really lets you explore the characters, even more than episodes 1-3.  Don't let the cartoon look turn you away.  There is plenty of action and it really has something for everyone to like about it.
1423119509|5.0|This series is definitely one of the best, like Harry Potter and things like that.<br />Kids from 13 and up will love the story and won't stop reading til the last page of the last book.Loved it!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Corporations exploit anything they can get away with, including torturing and murdering defenseless animals.  If only the table could be turned . . .
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|I bought The Other Boleyn Girl for my daughter for Xmas.  We both saw it in the theater and both loved this movie.  At a great price and as usual delivered promptly.  Great movie to pop in and watch again & again on a rainy or boring day! The costumes, story, love sceenes all make for a great movie to add to a collection.  I watch the Tudors and think this version was just as entertaining!  The actors were wonderful!!
0061537969|5.0|Having spent my life reading books of one kind or another, I was very surprised when I read this book!  It is excellent. I would highly reccommend this to any body over the age of 16 as there are a couple of very teary parts!  If you like dogs and you like Formula One racing, (even if you don't), you will love this book!  Very uplifting, funny and oh so true!! My wife has read it several times and has bought copies to give to friends and family!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|The movie was terrific when viewed in the theater but even better on the big screen at home.  Prompt and efficient delivery by Amazon, as usual.  Great acting and story.  Loved the Spock relationship angle.
1416550542|5.0|This book grabbed my interest almost immediately and was a very fast read despite the length of the book.  I enjoyed hearing the story through the different voices of the women involved, reminding me of The Poisonwood Bible (another favorite) by Barbara Kingsolver in that respect. The jumping around from time period to time period was not confusing to me, since the dates were clearly labeled and the times were not that close or overlapping each other.  If you have trouble with the time changes in this book, do not read The Time Traveler's Wife or you will be really confused!  This is more of a woman's book, of course, since the male characters are not as fleshed out and inspiring as the female ones and some are downright weak or nasty.    Overall, this was a very enjoyable read, and it has made me want to read The House at Riverton.  I will be looking for her next book!
0307269981|3.0|I read the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and loved it despite it being far-fetched in general. I felt the author really created and defined the characters very well, making the reader feel like he knows them.  I thought The Girl Who Played With fire was a little weaker in that respect, but was interesting enough for those who can't help but like Lisbeth Salander as it reveals a lot more about her family history.  Very comical but weak ending after a typically far fetched battle scene;however, I know I will read the third in the series as I still really like Lisbeth and Mikel.  Too bad this author passed away and will not continue this series.
B0026J8LHM|4.0|I have nothing but praise for the last two albums from Dream Theater. The music has been amazing and singing is top notch. And if it weren't for a couple of slips here and there, I would have rated this a 5. To me it's all about the music and this music is so right on. And, for the most part, they don't go too far jamming endlessly which has kind of bugged me in the past. A solid 4.5 stars!
B0027WNRIG|4.0|The Deluxe Edition of Pyromania is LOUD.  There is an improvement in the clarity of the cymbals, but overall I think the compression takes away from this album.  The MFSL Gold disc remains the definitive version of this title.<br /><br />However, the live disc 2 sounds MUCH better than any previous bootlegs of this same show, and the Deluxe Edition of Pyromania is worth buying for the live disc alone.
B002XHN776|5.0|This is only for $3.99, what more could you ask? Download it before it goes to $10 like it is on itunes. Awesome cd, 30stm continues to make great songs, and this cd is a hour long with 12 songs. wow!
B002N1AEN2|5.0|The first time I heard the song \\"Cristallized\\" on the radio I couldn't wait to buy the complete album.  All the songs have a great acoustic, they just know how to immerse you in the songs. The bass is great, and the combination of voices make the whole album the best I've bought in this year. All of ii is completely amazing!!
B002LK3DUQ|5.0|This is an incredibly beautiful story and an amazing animation...for older children and children at heart!! The realistically portrayed devastation one feels as the world falls apart around you is so well done for the character of Carl Fredrickson (Ed Asner). How he copes (or doesn't cope) is so believable. How he interacts with young Russell, and learns to believe in Life again, is heartwarming and real. The story is fascinating and touches that fantastic place in each of us who has that one special wish that maybe someday...    The antics of Dug, the talking Dog (Who can forget his sudden interjection of \\"Squirrel!\\") are hysterical and his devotion to his Master are so true to good dogs everywhere.  Russell's caring for and about Kevin - the bird that represents the great conflict in this tale - is so profound. Russell gives - and receives in return - unconditional love.    This is a story that will entertain young children with its balloons and animals and zany adventures. But it is truly a tale for older viewers that reaffirms all that is good; reinforces good memories but also encourages the letting go of past entrapments; and proclaims that it is always worth the risk to open our hearts to love and respect.    A wonderful story...one worth viewing again and again and again!!!
B0029LHW68|5.0|Sounds like they have matured musically.  I like the old stuff but also like this.  Worth the wait!
B002EWD08Q|3.0|This album was a bit of a letdown.  It doesn't have the edge that the other albums.  It is pretty slow and even boring at times. It sounds like the band is trying to reinvent it's sound. They definitely have a different vibe going on, it's just not one that I like.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|We bought this for the Grand kids and they really liked the movie. Enjoy the great variety and service from Amazon
B001P9EQH8|4.0|This is an entry level amplifier that I wanted to try out before I spent much more on a serious headphone amp. It does what it's supposed to, amplify, and compared to listening without it, lows become much stronger with the bass boost on, and all sounds become more distinct from each other. The only reason I'm not very enthusiastic about this product is because first, there is a noticeable hissing sound that I can hear in silence and very quiet music. Also, the most annoying thing is that when I am using it and charging it at the same time, it creates some kind of interference which is somehow connected to my mouse, and the result of this is that I can hear high pitched whines and beeps when I move my mouse around. If it did this all the time, I would have returned it immediately, however it is only when you charge it during use, which means that if you use this amp for headphones on a desktop, you can't charge it while you listen. Both of these annoyances are -1 star, but this amp is dirt cheap and the difference in sound quality is justified by the cost.
B001S6Y0AQ|5.0|Brubeck is the man.<br /> This has him all of the way from his roots,<br /> These are also the great tunes that made him what we love........<br /> Damn Great is all I can say.<br />It's a buy I have worn grooves in.......
B002T9H2MO|5.0|What a surprise this was.  Flying on a plane to South America and saw this film on the plane of all places.  Why isn't this getting wide release in the U.S., I don't know, but it is awesome.  Anyone else notice the Selk'bag Sleepwear System he was wearing in the movie?  Awesome!    [[ASIN:B00301A7HC Selk'bag 3G Adult by Musuc]]
B002Q4U9YU|4.0|I enjoyed this CD it has many of the classic Michael Jackson songs along with a new poem and a new song.  I would recommend it to MJ fans
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Excellent DVD ~ even for an animation flick.  Good lessons in life for all of us.  Another keeper...
B002XHN776|5.0|This is War is one fabulous album.  I've been a 30STM fan for four years.  I liked their 1st album.. fell in love with the 2nd, but War is in an entirely different league.  Artistic, angry, conceptual and gorgeous.  Is it an album that will get a lot of airplay? No.  It's too far ahead of it's time and too complex for the general population to wrap their minds around.  Also, the songs are quite long and are unable to be edited to a \\"radio-friendly\\" length.  All in all, a great listen for the open-minded and the perfect soundtrack for those battling their own personal wars.      Provehito in Altum    ~Caitlin
0006716776|4.0|For a few years I tossed around the idea of reading this children's fantasy novel and finally took the plunge after hearing a speaker at our fellowship talk about it last month. Fiction is not my cup of tea, but if there is anyone who could give me a taste for it, C.S. Lewis would be the one. Several years ago I read Lewis' classic, Mere Christianity, and I have had a growing interest in reading his fictional piece, The Screwtape Letters. I decided to read roughly a chapter a night to my girls who have seen both the BBC and Disney versions of the movie. It was a little difficult for Grace, my four year old, to always follow the story, but Rose, my seven year old, enjoyed hearing about the secret land beyond the wardrobe. Upon completion of The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, both Rose and Grace have expressed on one more than one occasion their disappointment that I am not continuing on with Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia, the second of seven books in The Chronicles of Narnia series. Although I do not plan on reading more fiction anytime soon, I think there is a good possibility we will continue these adventures in the land of Narnia one day.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan has an incredibly beautiful voice, her Amazing Grace ran chills up and down my back.      Can we have more!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I was a bit skeptical at first, oh another remade box set eh. But after reading a few reviews that were glowing I thought okay I will give it a shot. I am glad I did! These mono recordings are simply the best reproduction on cd I have heard of the Beatles. I have several of these albums on vinyl and I can say these cd's come amazingly close to the quality I find on my analog setup. Without trying to sound arrogant lets just say that is saying something and these are a very special box set. If your hesitating don't, you won't regret it. The only thing you will regret is when these sell out and no additional pressings are made. I also will add the mini vinyl style inserts with each cd are a nice touch. Clearly TLC went into this labor of love.
B0022VOZ1A|4.0|I rec'd an email telling me the book had shipped right after I purchased it.  However, it took 3 weeks to get to my mom from within the same state.<br /><br />The book is wonderful!
0618680004|3.0|Having just read \\"The God Delusion\\", I wanted to share a brief summary of what the book says and how the message is presented.  Dr. Richard Dawkins is unmistakably one of the most important scientists today in the field of biology.  He is a highly intelligent man, yet at the same time, a very angry one.  \\"The God Delusion\\" is filled with vitriol toward God and anyone who believes in a deity.  It read as a collection of rants in a personal journal more than it did a scientific book.  Granted, we all know that atheists are anti-theist, but in attacking religion Dawkins forgets that his anti-religion is a religion as well...it is a belief system, too.  Atheism is the belief that there is no God.  As much as Dawkins wants to believe science can prove that God does not exist, the truth is that science hasn't proven God is real or not.  At least not yet.  And, it may never.    Before I am attacked, please let me explain.  No one can prove or disprove the existence of a deity.  At this moment in time, the idea of God is still just that, an idea.  Some accept the concept of God and others don't.  There shouldn't be such a war between scientists and believers.  One comment that Dawkins repeats over and over is that it is impossible to be intelligent AND believe in a God of some sort.  That statement is very condescending.  Instead of trying to rip a huge segment of the world's population, Dr. Dawkins should instead use his brilliance to help open the eyes of readers to the world of biology and, as he says, raise their consciousness, in order to allow people make up their own minds whether to believe in God or not.   Maybe if folks were encouraged rather than brow-beaten, they may change their world view.      In all, I found the book to be very interesting despite the anger.  The book could have been five stars if not for the vitriol.  Beginning about midway through the book, Dawkins began to mellow some and by the end I felt my time was not wasted.  I came away from \\"The God Delusion\\" with my consciousness raised, but I'm not sure it was raised the way he would wish it to be.  Did I give up a belief in God?  Did I become more of a believer?  No.  Instead, I find I am more aware of myself and my belief system, as well as all belief systems in general.  In the midst of his anger and condescension, Dr. Dawkins did me a favor.  I guess my consciousness was indeed raised.    He helped me to open my eyes and see.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|As with all my purchases from Amazon, this DVD was received promptly, in perfect condition.  Love the Ice Age Movies....they are great family movies. Can't wait for the next one(hope there is a next one)! My Great-Grandson loves them.
0439023483|5.0|One major conflict of The Hunger Games is the fact that there can only be one winner from the annual Hunger Games.  Each of the 12 districts must send one male and one female to compete in the Games.  Each competitor must fight for survival because the last person standing is the winner.  Katniss Everdeen, from the twelfth district, begins to like and admire Peeta, the male competitor from her district.  She realizes that she and Peeta could be the last two finalists and she would have to kill him or be killed herself.  Near the end of the competition the Capitol decides there can be two winners if they are from the same district.     I would compare Katniss Everdeen from The Hunger Games with Tobias MacIvey from A Land Remembered.  I think that these two characters would get along because they are both hard working people.  Both of these characters had many challenges that they had to overcome.   These two characters would have helped and encouraged each other during the most enduring of circumstances.  Neither one of these characters would have allowed the other to give up on any task.  The bad side of this team would be the lack of common sense to stay out of trouble.   These two characters would most likely hurt each other while attempting to survive the daily challenges of hard lives.         The Hunger Games is a thrilling and suspenseful novel that keeps the reader wanting more.  Suzanne Collins has done an outstanding masterpiece for young and old readers alike.  Winning means everything, including your life.  Competitors fight to the death, using inventive ways to terminate each other.  Who will win, who will die, let the games begin.     I would recommend this book to someone else.  I would recommend it because it is a very thrilling book that never gets boring while reading it.  It always keeps you wanting to know what is going to happen next in the story.  People who would enjoy reading this book would be people that like a lot of action in their books. There is always something interesting happening in the book.      The Hunger Games is about survival.  Each competitor must use their smarts and their strengths in order to survive.  This book makes me realize that body strength does not mean you will win. You must stay focused and use all resources available in order to succeed.  Even when you think there is no solution, sometimes you need to have hope and faith.
B001GWK2MC|1.0|Originally bought for winter play in the garage/basement (have Little Tikes Jump & Slide Bouncer for summer) for my son's 2nd birthday. But, like other Intex products, this inflatable castle just doesn't withstand the rigors of daily abuse. My two boys loved it, while it lasted (only two weeks). Other reviewers for Intex products mentioned patching (one of the better kits: Kwik Tek Airhead Vinyl Repair Kit), but, in my case, the material actually tore away from one of the four castle tops, creating a huge hole. This type of hole isn't necessarily patchable (though I tried), as the material is simply torn. Would not recommend...waste of money.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|North by Northwest not only has the best actors starring in the movie, Cary Grant, Eve Marie Saint and James Mason.  It also has who might be considered one of  the greatest film directors ever!  Alfred Hitchcock.  Combine a great story these great actors and a world class director and made in 1958 when films were much better  than 50 years later, and you have a fantastic motion picture.  I bought the Blu Ray version and it is worth the extra money.  Well worth the time it takes to watch.
B001FB55HQ|5.0|I have to give this five stars because I think most of the bad reviews are from one of a few types of people:  1) people who havn't followed the terminator movies  2) people who just don't like sci-fi  3) people who got caught up in the Christian Bale controversy and just want to hate him  4) people who don't like the director and can't get past that  5) people who think that a movie about cyborgs destroying mankind should have a \\"funny, light-hearted\\" feel to it  6) people who want it to be like the old movies. You know, get chased for two hours by another new version of the Terminator sent back in time to stop john conner. Then you get to ponder how the future will be changed.     First of all Terminator 3 sucked, it was basically a bad remake of T2 even though I still see it as relevant to the series. As for Terminator Salvation, it is about time that the story got around to the future resistance, and it was done beautifully. The story was awesome and left room for other movies. The cinematography was perfect for the mood of the movie, which was appropriately serious and dark. Not overly done when you think about the context of the movie. The special effects were very good, especially when looking back at the old movies you can tell the CG technology has improved. The acting was top-notch, even though Christian Bale didn't seem like the main character he fit the role. Best of all was the detail put into every scene of the movie, you can tell that a lot of effort was put into every aspect.     The only thing is that I wish some characters from the Sarah Conner Chronicles were used, and that the movie would have tied in with the TV show somehow since it ended so abruptly. And I thought they could have used claire danes for john conner's wife in this movie, it would have worked.       I hoped this could expand into a trilogy of the resistance story using the same main actors and director. But it probably won't because of all the bad reviews from people who probablyaren't even fans of Terminator.
B001PO53IO|5.0|Show is way beyond your typical star wars scene.  My whole family has enjoyed it, I find myself as an adult sitting down and watching it with my kids. The episodes have something that most cartoons lack... a story.  I would recomend this to anyone very satisfied.
B0029LHW68|1.0|I was a HUGE fan of 30stm up until today. I completely love their last two albums, and I saw them in concert and I thought they were awesome. I thought they were the best band of the last decade, and I always told everyone they are my favorite band. Now, after hearing this new album, I am ashamed that I was ever part of their fan base. What were they thinking? This is like the worst possible 80's music you can imagine, and then some. As I went through listening to the album I got more and more depressed as each song passed. I haven't felt this disappointed over music since the Ataris turned emo. Is this supposed to be a middle finger to the fans of the last two albums? It seriously sounds like the album was made to suck on purpose. I would give it zero stars if I could with a burning 30stm logo next to it. I mean at least have the courtesy to call it a side project with a different band name if you're going to experiment to this extreme. Here's the best way I can describe each aspect of this album:  Lyrics: amateurish, as if he was just trying to rhyme as best as possible. Not as thoughtful and metaphorical as old songs.   Voice: It's good until he goes into overly ambitious high notes like american idol's adam lambert. It just sounds like a woman screaming.   Music: You will hardly hear a guitar, but what sounds like keyboard effects (like the toy casio keyboards) are almost constant. There's also laser robotic sounds, Bon Jovi (mid 80's) type sound efects, and a stomp and clap track that seems to try and harness the spirit of we will rock you. And then there's the spontaneous fan choir that comes up at the most inopportune moments to make a big question mark pop over your head. Is this a live album or did someone think I wanted to hear what sounds like a group of kids singing in a choir? Someone described this as incorporating it's \\"army\\" into the music, well it didn't work.     I literally could not find one song that I liked. Yes, it is that bad. And I should remind you that I absolutely love their last two albums so I can't even describe how disappointing that is for me.     Bottom line, if you dig the 80's sound with a bit of techno, cheap sound effects, and mediocre production, then this is all you. Or if you like a souped up retro 80's sound mixed with emo. I will never understand why 30stm changed their sound. They were already a unique sounding, original band with an amazing singer. No other band could compare or even fit into a genre with them. They were mythical gods among the mortal clones. Now they will be a sad memory of what could have been.

B000VDDWDS|5.0|I own both the original DVD and the Blue Ray Disc of this movie.  I have played them both and it is impossible to compare the two together.  The Blue Ray Disc offers much more clarity and sound to that of the standard DVD.  It was given to me as a present and I plan to gradually replace my standard DVD's - at least those I particularly want to see in Blue Ray - to get the most out of the movie experience.<br />I highly recommend this product to those interested in an incredible Visual and Audio experience.[[ASIN:B000VDDWDS Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World [Blu-ray]]]
B002K0WBXW|1.0|I'm sorry, but this movie was SUCH a disappointment.  If you have seen \\"While You Were Sleeping\\" (which I loved), then you have essentially already seen \\"The Proposal\\".  It is almost entirely the same plot, with the insertion of some \\"wacky\\" (read: out of place and completely contrived) antics, and--I swear--almost the exact same dialogue in parts (e.g. the wedding scene where Bullock stops the ceremony and gives the speech about how this groom she's messing with has such a great family and she just got caught up in that?  Sound familiar?  Yeah.  Almost identical to the scene in \\"While You Were Sleeping\\" which could be described in the exact same manner.)<br /><br />Switch out Bullock's sweet, unassuming, and poverty-stricken Lucy in \\"...Sleeping\\" for a mean, selfish, and filthy-rich lady in \\"The Proposal\\" and you have pretty much the same film, although--again--comedic antic-laden scenes which were charming in \\"...Sleeping\\" (e.g. the slipping around on the icy sidewalk scene) are replaced with forced, unfunny scenes that leave you cringing (e.g. the tribal dancing with the grandma where Bullock starts rapping).<br /><br />Much better use of your time to just watch \\"While You Were Sleeping\\" again and feel good at the end of the flick.  It's all been done, and it was done so much better the first time.

B0029LHW68|2.0|I LOVE 30 Seconds To Mars.  Not because Shannon, Tomo, and Jared are \\"hot\\", and not because they were \\"cutting-edge\\" or \\"indie\\" when I started listening to them.  I love 30 Seconds To Mars because I think they are an amazingly talented band and I think Jared's voice is absolutely phenomenal. That is why I was so sad when I listened to this new album.  'This Is War' doesn't have the strong rock songs like their previous two albums did so if that's what you're expecting, you'll be extremely disappointed.  This isn't a bad album, its just VERY, VERY different from what 30 Seconds To Mars fans are accustomed to.
B002B4OVWG|4.0|This monkey is super cute.  Dd is just discovering it and loves to wave it around.  Its a great binky to take out and about since I tend to loose these when they go flying out of the baby's mouth.  The only down side is that the binky is permanently attached to the monkey.  So you really cannot sterilize the binky and washing it gets the monkey all wet, which you're not supposed to do.  I still like it.      edited- oops, I didn't read the tag correctly.  Turns out you can throw the whole thing in the laundry.  Works great.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Batman has always been my favorite of the comic book heroes. Unlike the most Batman is human, he has no super powers unless you count his amazing self control and brilliance. In the past, this very human character has been placed in a very supernatural world surrounded by villains that seem like they don't belong, possess supernatural powers, or are too comic to believe they could be nothing more than a fly bothering an elephant. The city too gothic or colorful to be taken seriously, but this all changed with Batman Begins, a movie that showed Batman as a very human crime fighter, in a very real world.    The Dark Knight takes everything up a notch, creating a brutal world, in a very realistic city. This new saga, from the creators of Batman Begins, doesn't try to be a comic book movie, but instead tries to be something greater and succeeds in spades. Don't expect the bubblegum pop of past comic book movies, this movie transplants comic book characters into a gritty crime drama that feels like it could actually happen. Forget the comic book, no one is safe and nothing's sacred here. From the opening scene this movie picks you up and won't let you down until the credits start to roll, you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat from start to finish. In this world, our hero isn't past breaking legs to get the information he needs, and our villain is as scary as anything you've seen in Silence of the Lambs or Se7en.    The movie opens up with a bank robbery, and you learn just what kind of person The Joker really is. (The hype is underplayed, Heath Ledger is beyond amazing as he literally disappears into the role of a lifetime. Ironic, and unfortunate, that his best performance should be his last.) Here we watch an amazingly choreographed bank robbery as The Joker's \\"allies\\" drop like flies. This is a man who cares about nothing, not even the money he's stealing, he's just having fun pulling one over on everyone. We also hear him utter one of the greatest lines of the whole Batman series: \\"I believe in one thing: what doesn't kill you, makes you stranger.\\" This opening scene not only sets the tone for the rest of the movie, but is also one of the most amazing opening scenes of any action/drama movie ever.    Currently, in our saga, Jim Gordon and Batman are doing their best to put an end to the mob's rule in Gotham city with a little help from the new DA Harvey Dent, the city's new White Knight. Harvey Dent is a pure man in a dirty world (once again played excellently by the always welcome Aaron Eckhart) and could also be Bruce Wayne's chance to put down the cape and cowl once and for all. Here we see Bruce as a man torn, the true antihero. I thought Christian Bale was good in Batman Begins, here he exceeds all expectation.    While our trio of good tries to take down the mob, the mob turns to the man who's been robbing them blind to take care of The Bat: The Joker. It's just too bad for the mob that they had nowhere else to turn to. With the mob relying on him, and the cops and Batman going after the mob, The Joker now has free reign on the city. Here The Joker has no true agenda, at least no rational agenda, and that's something Batman can't understand because in his mind every criminal wants something. What do with someone who is absolutely insane (he tells the story of how he got his scars several times, each time telling a different story, and each time believing the story with every fiber of his being) and so hellbent on destruction and anarchy? Maybe you have to use the criminals methods to fight them. (You either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain.)    This movie takes on some very weighty and deep issues, but never loses steam. It might be two and half hours, but it flies by. It's one of the most entertaining movies in the multiplex right now, and I would recommend you see it in the theater, some things will lose their visual luster on the small screen (a night time fly around the skyscrapers of Hong Kong comes to mind). Catch it soon, you won't be sorry.

B002VKE1K2|5.0|Low budget indie films have been a good way for amateur filmmakers to break out for a long time. Kevin Smith broke out with a black and white movie made for $67,000 called Clerks; El Mariachi, made for only $7,000, turned Robert Rodriguez into a big name rebel director in the 90's. Horror is a harder medium to make it in the low budget arena. A field dominated by gory and effects driven movies these days, horror saw a megahit in 1999's Blair Witch Project. Made for only $11,000, Blair Witch Project has often been duplicated, but the success was never repeated. Here we are, 10 years later, and a new phenomenon has come around with Paranormal Activity, a movie that doesn't try to be Blair Witch, but exceeds expectations. Made also for only $11,000, Paranormal Activity has made a huge splash in the mainstream breaking records in the process (in it's first weekend it broke $7 million in only 200 theaters), but is it really worth all the fuss?  After a series of \\"supernatural\\" events have happened in their house, Micah, decides to get a video camera to substantiate their claims of a haunting. Katie (who's engaged to be engaged to Micah) has had these supernatural events happen to her since she was 8, she wants them to stop, and while she's not entirely comfortable with Micah recording the events, she goes along with it. They meet with a psychic who feels they're dealing with a demon and suggests a demonologist to help them take care of their problem. Micah doesn't take it seriously, and believes they can get rid of their visitor without outside help. Despite Katie's warnings and worry, Micah keeps trying to provoke the entity. Tensions build, tempers flare, and the paranormal activity gets more intense till it finally reaches the breaking point.  Originally bought by Paramount with the intention of owning the rights to remake the movie with a better budget and bigger names, Paranormal Activity fares better without the higher production values of a big budget film. Shot with one handheld camera and without a score, the movie feels completely real. The use of unknown actors also gives the film a more authentic feel, and it helps that they don't really feel like they're acting as well. As each day unfolds, we find ourselves prisoners in the house, which adds to the claustrophobic feel of the movie. We learn every nook and cranny of the house, so we notice the moving shadows, and the changes that occur all the more later on in the film.  All in all, Paranormal Activity is a very well done horror film, stripping away many of the conventions we see in horror film, relying on real scares rather than gore or music cues to instill a sense of tension and fear in the audience. I highly recommend seeing this in theaters if you have the opportunity, the atmosphere of seeing this with others really helps with adding fear to the proceedings as large groups intensify the feeling among those in the group. For those of you planning on taking the children, there is foul language, but on top of that the film does start off slowly and the more nuanced scenes may be lost on a younger audience. Definitely give this film as a chance as it is worth the hype, even if only for the last scene of the movie!  5/5  Be sure to check out: [[ASIN:B006K7WZ7S Armadillo & Sands: Intellectual Properties at Work]]!

B002SJIO54|5.0|After The Lord of the Rings trilogy and King Kong, Peter Jackson was handed the keys to a Halo movie. But work starting on The Lovely Bones (due out December 11, 2009) and the possibility of The Hobbit in his future, Peter Jackson opted to produce and wanted to pass directorial duties to an unknown South African director named Neill Blomkamp. With an unknown director known only for his short films, commercials, and special effects work and a reported $150 million budget for Halo the producers and studio balked at the idea of Blomkamp directing. After Halo fell through, Jackson offered Blomkamp a $30 million budget to direct the film of his choice. The result, a feature length version of Blomkamp's first short film Alive In Joburg called District 9.    District 9 starts as a documentary. Thirty years ago an alien ship came to a halt over Johannesburg, South Africa. After emptying the ship of it's inhabitants, the government segregates the aliens from the humans into a dirty third world camp called, you guessed it, District 9. The aliens who looks like a cross between insects and crustaceans and are referred to as prawns are forced to live in squalor and filth in rickety shacks and have to dig through trash for food or trade their advanced weaponry to Nigerian gangs for cans of cat food (their preferred food). Unfortunately, everything in District 9 isn't as it should be as the humans want them moved even further away from society, so a plan goes into effect to move the prawns even further from society into District 10. A group of officials from a government contracted firm called Multi-National United (MNU), led by Wikus Van De Merwe (newcomer Sharlto Copley) is sent into District 9 to give the prawns eviction notices stating that they have 24 hours to vacate District 9. During the course of their project, though, Wikus accidentally has some mysterious liquid sprayed in his face which has some devastating effects.    District 9 could quite possibly be the best movieI've seen all summer, my only regret is that it didn't come out sooner. It starts out as social commentary dealing with apartheid, the humans take great pleasure in treating the prawns as less than human, shuffling them around, berating them, and even burning down shacks that contain their eggs. It's this sociopolitical relevance that really causes this movie to rise above it's sci-fi peers. On top of that, the movie is shot with a real documentary feel, this adds to the gritty reality of the movie. You believe this is happening because it feels like a documentary you'd watch on the History channel.    On top of that, the acting is superb as well. A special shout out must be given to Sharlto Copley who has no acting experience and had no previous acting experience and had no intention to be an actor prior to Blomkamp's short film, Alive In Joburg. His character Wikus is seen in nearly every scene of the movie and you really feel for him despite his early despicable acts in the movie. You always feel for him and you always root for him, and while that can be attributed to great writing, it takes a great actor to really pull that range off.    The real winner in this movie, and what really blew my mind, though, are the special effects. I don't normally mention budgets when reviewing a movie, but here I think it's important. To give you an idea if you were to look at the other action movies to come out this summer you would see that X-Men Origins: Wolverine cost approximately $160 million to make, Terminator Salvation cost about the same, and Transformers 2 cost about $200 million. On the other side of the spectrum, if you look at comedies, Funny People cost $75 million, and last years Zack and Miri Make a Porno cost $25 million. Hell, back in 1991, Terminator 2 was originally budgeted at $77 million but went way over budget. The point: this movie had as many special effects as, say Wolverine, and cost less than a third of that to make and looks 10x better. Remember, all of the prawns, except the dead ones laying out on tables, were shot completely with digital effects and they all look photo-real. This movie easily looks like a $150 million plus movie.    All in all, I'm really hoping this movie starts a new trend among studios: more original movies. I highly recommend you check it out in theaters, but before you decide to take your kids remember that this movie does earn it's R rating. It has way more than it's fair share of cursing, and exploding bodies (that alien technology will get ya every time). If you have a chance to go alone, or don't mind your kids seeing gore and hearing multiple f-bombs, I suggest you see it now and not just wait for this movie to hit DVD.    5/5
B001AQMBJQ|5.0|I am one of those LOST fans who never really wavered during the season 2-3 slowdown...to me this show's always been amazing from beginning to end (Well almost end). Of course some aspects of the story have been more interesting than others, but that only makes the intense times all that much better. The reality is that LOST has never been bad and the parts people complain about are only less than stellar in comparison with the amazing heights of this creative and engrossing show has achieved.     With that said, season 5 is LOST at it's most compelling...a true benchmark that I wish more shows would even try to aspire to...bravo!!
0385491026|4.0|Cat's Eye is a beautiful and insightful treatment of not only the relationship among girls and young women, but how those relationships may, or may not, evolve and impact a life.  This is subject matter I don't often encounter in fiction, so kudos for being the 'Mary Cassatt' of this tiny genre.  Like life, the plot can amble in its later stages, however without losing thematic power.<br /><br />The conclusion is a little overwritten, but nonetheless powerful.<br /><br />This should be recommended reading for high school students everywhere.

B0029LHW68|5.0|I cannot understand all the negativity here. Jared Leto and company have really stepped it up here. They have reinvented themselves, and this CD is quite epic in nature. Jared's vocals are beautiful, full of power and emotion. He has to be one of the best singers out there in the business. There is whispering done by Jared, and I think it works quite well. A use of a choir is also quite effective. Really adds to the epic tone of the album. The band is Jared, but the rest of the band is remarkably good, the drums and bass and guitar is good. Jared's songwriting has improved a lot. I never thought he was a good songwriter.     There are many great songs on here. \\"Alibi\\" is my personal favorite. What a beautiful song. Has the most personal lyrics out of the songs. The build-up to the cresendo by the end of the song is well done. Jared really shows us what kind of a voice he has. The lyrics, \\"I fell apart but got back up again\\" seems simplistic and cheesy, but it works here. The emotion is gorgeous. Brought tears to my eyes.     \\"This Is War\\" is also well done. Very Depeche Mode like. This song has hints of U2 as well. Lyrics are good, and the last 30 seconds or so gives me chils. Seems like they recorded the song live or something. Very uplifting though. Guitar and drums are superb.    It's better to listen to this CD outloud, then on headphones. You can hear the guitar and bass lines better.

044654146X|5.0|I appreciated this book so much I lent it to my boss to read before his first trip to Israel. Fantastic research, reporting, writing. My only criticism is that the brief mention of Haredim leaves the impression that Haredi men, an astounding percentage of whom (73%) do not work, would want to work if they had the opportunity.  That Israeli society has unfairly excluded them.  This is a mistaken impression. Since the Haredi life is all-encompassing and Torah study a full time occupation, secular work for men is considered a last resort. (Women do work, even those with many children, and they are valiant and overburdened.) Haredi families need economic support, preferably life long, partly from the Israeli government and to some degree from religious Jews in America. The productive segment of Israeli society is bearing the economic weight of supporting large religious families whose fathers could earn, but choose not to. How long will the most marketable, most entreprenurial Israelis continue to support poor-by-choice Haredim?  Israel is suffering a severe brain drain. All around me I see educated, vibrant, secular young Israelis working and living in New York City. They have a choice where to live. A severe economic problem for Israel.
0312370849|4.0|I loved this book not only because it moved me and made me think, but because I learned of France's involvement in the Holocaust.  If a book can teach you something and imprint itself upon you, that is the best kind of book.  The story is told using two separate points of view.  There is Sarah's story; she is the 10 year old girl whose family is torn apart in July, 1942.  And then there is the story of Julia Jarrmond, the journalist who risks a great deal to find out what happened during the roundup of many thousands of Jews.<br /><br />Sarah and Julia were real people to me.  I cried for Sarah's loss and her pain and I rejoiced when Julia fought for what she thought was right in her own life as well as in the telling of Sarah's story.<br /><br />When I wasn't reading this book, I was thinking of these two families that were inextricably woven together.  I craved answers and resolution.  This book will stay with me for a long, long time.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|I loved this movie and so did my husband. We have different tastes in movies, but both loved this one. Also neither one of us was a star trek fan in the past, but this movie changes things. It was so much fun to watch. The acting was good. The casting was great. The action was awesome. And the entertainment provided by this movie made me remember this is what watching a movie is all about. To be wrapped up into the action and drama of the film. To end up smiling and feeling like that was time well spent. So many times I watch a movie and at the end think \\"Well, that was a waste of two hours\\". At the end of this movie my two thoughts were, \\"I gotta buy this movie.\\" and \\"I hope they make another one!\\"

B001SMC91M|4.0|Austin, Texas has deserved its name for giving birth to some fantastic music, but generally it's not been in the soul genre.  Well, the city's remedied that with the release of this new CD by Black Joe Lewis. The music sounds like everything that I loved about soul back in the day:  James Brown, Otis Redding, etc with modern production values so it doesn't just sound good on your car studio.    The music's raw and the lyrics are powerful and explicit, but the groove is good enough to get you up on your feet and dancing.      Favorites--I don't have one.  \\"Gunpowder\\" was the song I heard first on the radio, but I like \\"Master Sold My Baby\\" and frankly, there really isn't a song that won't get you up and moving.

B002RSDW80|5.0|THE MAIN STORY LINE: JULIE<br />Julie a young woman who used to be an editor and for one reason or another no longer is.  She has high achieving friends and feels like she is wasting her life, especially since she is nearing 30. She is working as a secretary in a government office that is dealing with many of the issues around ground zero. It is a thankless stressful position and she has a minor ability to help the people who call.<br />She goes home to her husband in a small apartment over a pizzeria and to wind down from her frustrations, she cooks some amazing meals. Feeling like she is wasting her life and her talents, she creates a challenge for herself.  Cook all of the recipes in Julia Child's; Mastering the Art of French Cooking in one year and blog about it.<br /><br />THE FOUNDATION STORY LINE: JULIA<br />Simultaneously in the movie, you are treated; with story of the evolution of Julia Child's famous book and how it came about with Julia Child and her French collaborators.  Independent of the story line, what really struck me was the technology differences and how I had forgetten how different things were so not long ago. Julia's 1950 era of Air Mail and Telegraphs to Julie's Email, Blog and texts. What we are reminded of too, is how formidable and impenetrable French Cuisine and the Cordon Bleu was then, not only to just American's but an American Woman, no less. Bravo Julia!  The times were also tense with McCarthy era politics.  Julia's husband's job forced several unwanted moves in the midst of the book creation. All this combined made it even more amazing that it came together.<br /><br />THE MESSAGE:<br />This movie reminds you how much a trailblazer Julia Child was. This statuesque woman with the falsetto voice changed the way America cooked in an era of Fluffernutters. This also stands to show you that, if you pursue something you love, as both Julie and Julia did, you will find the perseverance to see it though during the rough spots. Mind you, a supportive spouse also helps..<br /><br />The actors were perfect for these roles and as usual Meryl Streep delivers..<br /><br />Bravo Julie and Julia.The actors were perfect for these roles and as usual Meryl Streep delivers..

His father is a German soldier who works as commandant for Hitler and the Fury. One day while exploring his new home and its land he realized people living on the other side of the fence wearing striped pajamas. On his journey he meets a boy his age who lives on the oppossite side of the fence in the concetration camp. They become secret friends and meet everyday. The conflict occurrs when he realizes his new friendship wouldn't make his father happy and could get his new friend killed. The conflict isn't ever resolved his father didn't know about there friendship and wasn't going to be able to.     Q. Pick one major character from the book and compare and contrast him to a diffrent character you have encountered this year in Language Arts.Would this characters get along why or why not?  A. One man character in my book is Bruno, he is adventurous and a curious young boy. i think he would get along with Zecharaih MacIvey from A Land Remebered, because they are both very alike. Zech like Bruno enjoys adventure he is rough and tough, and like Bruno, wants to make his father proud. Zech would help Bruno because Bruno is rather nieve and innocent and Zech could show him how to brave the wilderness and be a better explorer.    Q. Pretend you are a famous book author. Write a jacket blurb that will help advertise this book.  A. \\"The pages with in the book hold the true meaning of friendship and commrodarary\\". I chose to say this because this book is a perfect example of how to be a good friend. No matter what obstacles you and your friend might encounter you can always count on your friends to help you along the way. Bruno and Shmuel are the ideal example of friendship.     Q. Would you recommend this book to someone else? Why or Why not. Who would enjoy reading this book. Why?  A. I would definatley recommend this book to someone else because it is a heart felt story with real historical facts in it. I would acually say this book does a great job in being historically accurate.The words make you fell like you are living what Bruno is. I would most-likeley recommend this book for kids 11 and up, so they could thouroughly understand and apprieciate this work of genius. The content is rather cryptic and hard to understand in some points so parents be prepared to answer alot of questions.    Q. Pick one theme from the book and describe how you can apply it to your own life.  A. The theme of the book is friendship. Bruno and Shmuel have a very rare and unique friendship . Because they are sperated by a fence and neither one can cross it they only have one choice, to talk and get to know eachother. I can use this in my life to create better friendships and get to know new people better. I'm not saying that whenever I meet a person I am going to run to home depot and build a fence just so we can sit and talk through it so we can get to know eachother better. what I am saying is that i am going to take time and get to know a person before i judge them.

He lays out compelling evidence, backed by plenty of peer-reviewed science, that we should be trying to emulate our ancestors at the dinner table.  This book has revolutionized how I look at food and health.  The Paleo Diet is the first step to reclaiming a natural state of health.
0143038419|1.0|Wow, I could not believe after reading this book, how popular it is, although thankfully there exists a huge backlash as well that I have become aware of.    Elizabeth Gilbert tries to style herself as a chosen person. She includes the three factors which indicate whether a soul has been blessed:  1. To be a human who inquires consciously 2. To have been born with a yearning to understand the nature of the universe  3. To have a living spiritual master. And guess who has all three?    Elizabeth Gilbert is completely ruled by the capriciousness of her mind and unfortunately she takes us on this neurotic ride which is hailed as something spiritual or enlightening. I am sorry but anyone who has to learn in her mid-thirties that yes, over-eating yummy Italian food, eating tons of sugar, and being a glutton makes you feel alive and indulgent but also adds pounds to your body...I mean I learned this when I was ten years old. I guess this is what passes for wisdom in our world today. This realization of hers is complete with a gross scene of her having to go shopping for clothes because hers no longer fit.  How inspiring.  I feel like she deserves a PhD in image management. She's oh-so-witty and knows so many great people in Rome. God I feel sorry for them and her ex-husband, when you have to deal with someone who is such a child and makes every single thing about them.    When she goes to India, this is where it took all the intestinal fortitude I had not to do what I had heard of so many other people doing and that is throw this book against the wall.  Here's a little nugget to throw out at you, by her, regarding not stressing religious ritual for it's own sake: \\"..in this divided world where the Taliban and the Christian Coalition continue to fight out their international trademark war over who owns the rights to the word God...\\" If you say so Liz. I am not even going to further comment on this and let it's stupidity speak for itself. I mean the arrogance of this woman's interpretations of things knows no bounds.     She then lets us know what a great spiritual healer she is when she cures her nephew's insomnia long distance because of her chanting abilities.  Toward the end of this section, she lets us know that it's finally sinking in, she can run away from the fact that she is a self-centered blabbermouth no longer, and (too bad for all her social appointments at the ashram) she needs to focus on being silent. YESSS!!! But no! She concludes she really doesn't have to work on this at all because she gets a sign from the universe when they ask her to be a greeter (Key hostess) at the Ashram.  Oh brother.    What bothers me the most about this book is the patronizing and condescending tone she has toward other people. This is really highlighted when we get to hear her take on things while she is a key hostess. Here's another little nugget from her (to God) \\"Please give these wonderful people any blessings you might have originally set aside for me\\" huh?     This woman has none of the hallmarks of a spiritually conscious person. She's in love with her ego, she doesn't have respect for the wisdom and traditions that came before her (just what she believes,) she's controlling, can't shut up for one minute, and is at the mercy of her mind which seems to be in chaos all the time with it's never-ending hard work of locking down the perception we should have have of her.  She needs to study Justin Martyr who concluded that the human mind by itself is incapable of finding truth. Then she needs to study the precept \\"those who know do not say, those who say do not know\\" Then, (most importantly for the rest of us) she needs to look in the mirror every morning and say three times \\"It's not about me\\"    I did finish the book and I will say the last third was a tiny bit better than the rest of the book. This is because she is finally in a relationship with another person and the obsession she has with herself softens a tiny bit.  Most imbalanced people are obsessed with themselves but I think some of us realize this is the struggle. We don't write a book celebrating it within ourselves.  I believe the reason this book is so popular is because it's fantasy fulfillment for the vast majority of people who don't understand the disadvantages of making everything about them. This book is the wet-dream of people who want to have their self-importance validated. Like her, a lot of people, fail to realize \\"this is my own limited view of the world as much as I am in love with it\\" There's a complete absence in this book of humility.  She simply strives to establish how chosen she is because after all, the palm reader/medicine man feeds her ego about all the neat things about her. Too bad she never connects it to the statements he makes over and over about sending her friends to him for a palm reading because \\"I am very empty now in my bank\\"    I feel this woman is like Mackenzie Phillips, no matter how much validation she gets back from the world, it will never be enough.
B002TO1Z8Q|5.0|George Michael's \\"Live In London\\" embodies everything that's great about this man and his music.  The song selection is fantastic, as it covers all phases of George's career, from the Wham stuff to his latest solo works.  George's voice sounds just as it did 20 years ago and in my opinion it's even better on this concert.  Smooth as silk.  He makes it seem so effortless, even when he's doing his dance moves on the faster songs.  The man moves so well it's hard to believe he has steel rods in his back.    The visuals are very captivating, from elaborate lasers and bizarre images to more subtle backdrops for the ballads.  There are also many different camera angles so there is never a dull moment for the viewer.  The crowd is so into it, George has the audience in an absolute frenzy and with good reason.    The audio quality is very good but is slightly bass-heavy.  Everything comes through loud and clear but the bass is very prominent.  If there was a lack of treble this would present a problem, but there are plenty of highs so this doesn't detract from the listening experience.  Just be sure to remove any glass objects from your wall unit!            To think this is GM's first live DVD is hard to believe.  I am so thankful that he decided to do one and that the product is of such high quality.  His band is incredible and so are the backing vocalists.  A really talented bunch that bring out the most in all these classic tracks.  If you want to see and hear George Michael at his very best, you must get this.  A triumph.    - Ryan Mayer
B002GZQYMK|4.0|I read some of the reviews that gave this album 1 star. I'm not sure that you can be a Muse fan and not like this album.  No, it's not like their first album, but there is a fun, mature evolution occuring here.  It is a bit different than their other work, but the Muse essence is there and it's fabulous. Try \\"I belong to you\\" and \\"Resistance\\" for starters. As usual, it's best if listened to very loud.
B002PMV9FG|1.0|I could not even believe this was the same story I had read, well I guess that is because it wasn't. If this is not for a collection peurpose I would recommend not buying it. I can not even believe that someone would let a filmmaker destry there book like this. Does J.K. Rowling not even have anything to do with the movies? Does she not care how badly they are destroyed? And they are going to make the last book two parts so they can follow the story, yeah right, I want to know how they are going to get the crucial parts back into the story that have been left out!!! In credible, Terrible destruction of what was a good book.
0739309560|5.0|Another good Dan Brown mystery.  A lot of hokey, but fun just the same.  Good product, good price, fast service.  Would buy from this seller again.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Oh yeah! I enjoyed this almost as much as first seeing on the big screen. Highest recommendation!
0385504225|5.0|Some time ago I made myself read Davinci Code. The book was great.<br />But when my friend gave me The lost symbol I was thrilled. This book really keeps you going from first to last page. It was surprise for me that Dan Brown used the same person from Davinci Code and Demons & Engels. But the story is very good. I you like secrets and murder this book is must to read. I would be glad to read it one more time in some months.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I have loved Star Trek since I was a kid. Star Trek 2 was great but just about all the other movies were terrible. This reboot of the franchise is just what the series needed. We get the old characters we love involved in all new adentures. The blu Ray itself looks fantastic on my 52\\" screen and the sorround sound is crystal clear. Buy this movie!
B002LBGBR2|5.0|Beyonce is an excellent performer!  I really enjoyed this CD/DVD!!  I liked every song on the CD.
B001QMCJ1Y|5.0|I love movies based on real events.  The story is fiction, but the fact that geese can be taught to follow an ultralight aircraft is in your face reality depicted in the movie.  Teaching migrating birds new migration routs and destinations was the purpose of the original research, and was the same purpose in the film.  The cinematography is excellent and so is the acting.  Paquin and Daniels are A+ actors.  This is a truly inspiring family movie.
B002QGSOU4|3.0|This is a review for the amazon boxset product not Nirvana performance.  I disapointed with the quality of the box its so cheap, so fragile. Save your money buy the Live at Reading [CD/DVD]for $24.99 I agree with By  J. Kerrigan \\"Muzik Freek\\" this Amazon exclusive box set is a rip-off.
B0029LHW68|4.0|The album is quite different. It seems a little softer, but the sound is awesome. I especially notice the electric drums which give it a little trance sound. Buy it! The sound is great!
B001JNNDBA|5.0|I would say the #1 reason to buy this movie is that it contains the original theatrical version. Before I upgraded to blu-ray I bought the DD Directors Cut on DVD, and was very dissappointed about the changes to the film. Scenes were shifted around, and even worse, the soundtrack was different.     Visually, the DD blu-ray is no better then a DVD that is upconverted to 1080i, but for someone who doesn't have the original theatrical release and is looking to add to their blu-ray library, you can't go wrong with this. I will also note that it DOES contain the Director's cut so the converse is true. If you only have the thedtrical DVD and you are looking to see what the Director's cut it about, you also should buy this blu-ray. Though I prefer the theatrical version, the Director's cut is worth a viewing just so you can make up your own mind!
B0025KVLU6|3.0|I bought the Mono set first, then stereo versions of Abby Road / Let It Be to complete the set.  I decided to purchase the stereo version of the While album as this is a transitional album between mono and stereo, and many people commented that you need both versions (mono and stereo) to pick the \\"best\\" versions of each song.    Well, I'm not going to go into the mono vs. stereo, sound quality, etc. as many have already gone over all that.  Suffice it to say you won't be disappoint in the sound...OK?    My 3-star rating is the average of the CD itself (a 5) and the packaging (at 1).  This has to be one of the worst packaging jobs for a top shelf CD that I;ve seen.  Buy two if you plan to play alot (hey, $13 is cheap!) because you will NOT be able to avoid damaging either the package or CD otherwise.      Because there are two CD and two booklets, this is a four panel package.  The two CD's are \\"stuck\\" in the two middle sleeves.  Believe me, these are tight even when using the \\"squeeze\\" technique that others have suggested.  The two outer pockets are a bit more \\"spacious\\" but the larger booklet does not fit into the tigher inner pockets if you're thinking of moving stuff around.      It's a fairly thick pack with two CD's , two booklets, and four folding panels.  Unless placed and folded correctly, the pack will not easily slide into the outer cardboard \\"box\\" (or sleeve).      There are not liners for the CD so they are totally exposed when sliding into and out of the cardboard sleeves; finger prints are nearly unavoidable.
B0029O08WA|5.0|I got this because I loved the Twilight soundtrack so much. This one is really moody, but does have some upbeat songs. I find that I like it alot. I think it will have to grow on some people because it is so moody. Love the songs by Muse, Hurricane Bells, Thom Yorke, and The Meadow at the end of the cd.
0312427646|5.0|Allan Bennet's \\"The Uncommon Reader\\" is an excellent little book. The whole premise is funny from the very first sentence , and his characterization of the \\"Royals\\" is quite outstanding. A good short read whether you are an anglophile or not.
B0029O08WA|1.0|Seriously??? and I thought that music from the 80's was without depth. All of these songs sound the same.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|First let me congratulate Lady Gaga. This album comes in several formats, you can buy this one if you already have ''The Fame'' or if you want ''The Fame'' and ''The Fame Monster'' You can but the couble cd pack with extra tracks, You can also buy a deluxe pack that comes with both albums and posters. I bought the One cd album because I have the first one. As a Gaga fan I can tel you that this is 100000 times better than the first one. She shows a sensiteve side of her we never saw, and the crazy side we all love. This album is a must-have. This album will make you feel new feelings in every song.<br /><br />I LOVE U LADY GAGA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002GY9F9K|2.0|This is a  typical example of movie makers thinking they know better then the author and the people that read their books.  Books become popular and become best sellers because of the storyline.    This series was advertised as based loosly on the books by Terry Goodkind that was an overstatement.    The only similar thing to the book is the name of the characters, myself and my family were very dissapointed by the series as they turned it into a third rate Robin Hood show.    I do not think I will bother with any further series.    Film makers should relise if a book is good enough for a movie then stick to the book.    That lesson should be learnt from the Harry Potter Series and why they are so popular and not some cheap TV series as they turned the Seeker Books into.    However i will say the service from Amazon is excellent.
B002UXRH10|5.0|If I could I would give this album 200000000 stars. Every song is great, this album is tatally different from anything she did before. You will see the change in every song, but its the first time an artist does something different from what they usually do and nail it.<br />If you like Hip-Hop, R&B, or simpy love Rihanna, you should buy this album. The fact that Adam Lambert sold more albums is just insulting. Rihanna is 100 times better, but you shoud buy this version and not the clean because only that way you will get Rihanna's feelings.<br /><br />BUY IT NOW, YOU'LL LOVE IT
B000ZELISO|1.0|I am a complete HP fan - I probably know most of the 7 books by heart. As such, this movie was a total disappointment: a completely disjointed story, (as someone else here said, if you have not read the books you could not possibly have a clue about what is going on), pathetic acting, with all except for the most experienced actors such as Maggie Smith, Emma Watson and Snape behaving as if they were reading their lines for the first time, at rehearsal, from the script. No emotions, no passion, no excitement, no suspense. Just a series of separate, dispassionate scenes lined up, one after the other. I blame the director and the script writer, not the actors, as all of them are experienced and could not possibly have acted this way except if told to - as my director-to-be daughter put it, they all seem utterly \\"over-directed\\". And why in the world include scenes that are not even there in the book and do not belong for a second? If the Burrow is burned down, where will they keep the wedding for Bill and Fleur later? My conclusion is that the director already knew that the one and only strength of this poor rendition of the Half Blood Prince would be its special effects - which are good, but cannot make up for the other shortcomings - and therefore added another scene with nothing but special effects, at the cost of the plot. I have seen all the movies, really like no 1 and 2, but I cannot stand this director and how he murders these stories - this one was by far the worst. At my daughter's request I still bought the movie, just to have a complete set, but I 1000 times prefer the book!!
0385342020|4.0|The premise of the book was fun, I'm a fan of Kinsella to start with, and I like light hearted ghost stories so I was primed to enjoy it and I did even though Sadie's yelling got a bit irritating and Ed's over use of the \\"f\\" word ground on my nerves. The very last few pages were a tiny bit cliche, but overall, I cried in places and laughed in others as I usually do in Kinsella's books. If it wasn't her very best work, overall it was another great read from an author who continues to grow, isn't afraid to take chances, and whose voice I genuinely enjoy.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|If you get dark humor or are just open minded. Dexter is a sick hero.
0385504225|3.0|Dan Brown's lost symbol reads almost like a book report on DC and the symbolisms described. I find it too academic.    I've lived in the DC/VA/MD area for 4 years and am familiar with most of the places Dan Brown described. It's disappointing that the places are described devoid of the human factor - I don't get the sense of the pulse of the place - living and thriving with people, events, traffic, accidents, power - the center of the US' political hub; where a majority of the country's Federal structures are located - with at least 5 military installations within 10-30 miles of each other - the South and North of the Civil war - home of the old Colonial rich - there's so much to talk about to give the story flesh and blood.    I think Dan Brown also tried to be religious towards the end of the book - a discussion and interpretation of Christian tenets which could be misleading.    I also got confused with when the story is supposed to be taking place - mainly because of confusing references to technology. The appointment made with Dan Brown was made via voice mail and then FAX - does anybody still make appointments via fax as a backup reminder? This made me think maybe the story was set in the 80's. Then towards the end, there was a reference to twitter - w/c made me realize the story is supposed to be current - like 2008/2009.    The plot seems to be revolving around a lot of the characters just taking things for a fact  and not verifying or validating the information or situation presented. Given the high degree of intelligence of most people involved, and the wealth they possess, one would think that it takes just a few minutes of their time to verify things for security purposes - it would seem the characters are gullible, or reckless or naive.    The one high point in the book for me is the revelation of the killer's identity - w/c I think is a good twist and threaded the events together. However, it would have been better if Dan did not use the first person reference in the introduction of the killer - w/c seemed to be an inconsistency when the killer was revealed. A third person or passive narrative of the events at the Turkish prison would have provided more integrity to the plot and consistency to the build up towards the end of the story.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|Great series. I must have for Star Wars fans. Package is the best. Really nice. Lucasarts could have put this in a crappy wrapping and it would sell, but they really went out of their way.
B0017VG69U|5.0|There are some really awesome episodes in this season. Also some kind of bizarre ones. There are at least two where I was like, \\"That's the end?\\" Didn't resolve at all. But overall, this is a great season. I think the name Star Trek can give more credibility than any one review could, anyway.
B002OVEB5S|5.0|SLAYER has never let the fans down. Only Slayer can get away with the little short about the serial killer on the DVD. Nobody even bats an eye. If Selloutica or Megadeth that video they would be in court being sued. Slayer does what they want, when they want and gets away with it. GREAT CD. If you like Slayer or Metal buy it. The DVD is not nessary actually I found it silly but if you are a fan check it out.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|[[ASIN:B00003CX8Y Beauty and the Beast (Special Platinum Edition)]]  I am so thrilled to have my very own copy of this wonderful movie to add to my collection.  I think it is one of Disney's best ... the songs and story are equally enjoyable for children and grownups alike ... and owning the \\"Platinum Edition\\" DVD with so many extras is another treat! I look forward to watching it with my grandchildren, children and friends.  And, as always, since I purchased it from Amazon, it arrived right on time and in excellent condition.
B002ZHKZEM|3.0|Well this set should contain: 1) The Next Doctor, 2) Planet of the Dead, 3) The Waters of Mars, and 4&5) The End of Time - Parts One & Two.  But I don't know that!  And these 5 specials should fit on 2 discs (not 5).  You know? I've been paying $42 odd dollars for 13/14 episode seasons.  So, simple math here, I should be paying about a 1/3 of that for 5 episodes.  That equals about $14.  And as a die-hard Doctor Who fan, I'm willing to pay upwards of $20+, even $22 hard-earned American cash for these 5 episodes.  But $35 just seems like price gouging to me, and I'm not sure I support that in these lean economic times.  5 Stars because I love Doctor Who; 3 Stars for ripping me off! Maybe I'll wait a while...

B001TODCII|4.0|Sure, TAKEN is about eight feet over the top and soundly jumps the shark when Neeson's Super Dad/Super Bad character lands on the evil sultan's yacht (and those of you who have seen this film will know exactly what I'm talking about), but who cares?  TAKEN is not for Sundance audiences or art houses; it's grand edge-of-your-seat escapism that takes the viewer on a wild, bumpy ride as former CIA agent (at least, we assume he's former CIA) Bryan Mills goes to Paris to kick some serious bad guy arse.<br /><br />After grudgingly giving his teenage daughter (who lives in the lap of luxury with her mother and ultra-rich stepfather) permission to spend the summer in Paris with a friend and the friend's \\"cousins\\", we are not surprised to see the daughter get violently kidnapped by Albanian thugs running a sleazy prostitution ring.  Well, they picked on the wrong teenager, as agent Mills (Liam Neeson plays this delightfully close to the vest) is about to show them all who's your Daddy.  Putting all his clandestine skills to task, Mills mows through the Paris underground like a weedeater on acid, doing mega damage to all who stand in his way.  Of course, his relentless, cold-blooded, calculating pursuit ultimately pays bloody dividends and last-second heroics, making TAKEN one fun ride--even if none of it is believable.<br />--D.

B0019X3YXM|5.0|First off, let me say that I've not seen the Korean version, so I'm not going to make any comparison. I was living in Vietnam when the original movie came out (some time in 2002), and it was a mega-mega hit there. So, it's understandable if some people are not satisfied with the remake.    That out of the way, I have to say that this is an excellent movie. I don't see this one so much like a \\"drama marketing as a comedy\\". It is sort of a funny romantic movie. I think the director did a good job of keeping the spirit of the original movie. I'm not Korean, but a Vietnamese. I understand the Asian mindset. I don't know how different the two are, but the story in general is very very Asian, at least in my opinion. I'd not go too much on the romantic side and focus on the funny side.     The \\"romantic\\" comedy was great! I'll explain it. I don't like movies are too predictable. This one is definitely not. The movie kept me on edge during the  \\"1 year after\\" sequence at the tree. When I saw they bury letters under the tree and decide to meet 1 year later, I thought of it as a classic tragedy in romantic movie. You know, like one character will be there, reads the letter and finds one his loved one had some terrible illness (most often some kind of cancer). All that character can do is to sit there with nostalgia because his lover is already dead.    Well, they got me there. I don't want to spoil the movie, so go ahead and watch it. I came from crying (they were such a great couple) to laughing out really loud.    Anyway, enjoy the movie! I also recommend you to watch it the second time to pick up the nuances you probably overlook the first time you see it. The ending connects all those clues.    Oh, one more thing. Elisha Cuthbert is gorgeous! To be honest, I decided to watch this movie because of her name. I can't keep my eyes off her. I'm not surprise Charlie felt in love with her at first sight. She is simply gorgeous!

B002XHN776|5.0|30 Seconds to Mars fails to disappoint. Their first, self-titled album got me hooked, and when their second album left me thinking they couldn't possibly get any better, but with This Is War they've proved me and many others wrong. Their music has a feel that can be described as \\"epic\\" and the band excels at portraying emotion through it, leaving you feeling the same emotions. I recommend this album very highly, pick it up.

B000XA5K4I|5.0|THIS MOVIE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SWEET BUT WATCHING IT ON BLURAY TAKES IT TO ANOTHER LEVEL! A DEFINITE MUST BUY ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE NEW TO BLURAY
0132350882|1.0|The author fails to recognize that creating clean code is a balancing act, so he proceeds to fall off of a couple of big cliffs:  1) Advocating creating a million tiny functions each of which does almost nothing, and 2) Variable and function names that are so long they form detailed descriptions.  While its true that with super long names and trivially small functions its possible to write basically self-documenting code, there is a major sacrifice of overall clarity.  While each function on its own may be understandable, if you have split relatively simple processing  across 6 different functions, you have greatly reduced the signal-to-noise ratio of the overall project.  Each function you have created also now needs to have an interface maintained in both caller and function, and in C++ you will additionally need to maintain all of these interfaces in separate header files.  There are many cases where this is a worthwhile strategy (re-use of functions, encapsulation of business logic, etc), but the author takes it way past the point where it makes sense and the result is code that is tedious to read, understand, and maintain.  As far as the long names go, I personally don't want to wade through 30 character names for every variable or function, since it absolutely removes the ability to take something in at a glance (this name explosion seems to be an unfortunate trend in the java world). Lets be realistic; the vast majority of variables and functions can be effectively and clearly named with two words instead of a run-on sentence for a name.  There are other questionable patterns he advocates, such as redundant Interface declarations for creating a class: E.g. the base interface might be MyWidget, and the instantiated class is named MyWidgetImpl.  If you don't NEED polymorphism this is only going to create confusion, and if you DO need polymorphism then using a generic suffix of \\"Impl\\" is pretty much unhelpful.  I would give this book a miss, doubly so if you're not working in java.e not working in java.
B00278U1WA|2.0|i have absolutely adored this womyn's work....11:11, Songs....and then Soviet Kitsch and the amazing songs of Begin to Hope with one of the best songs ever in Better [as well as one of my favorite music videos of all time], Samson......i will ever sing the praises of the genius of the work that came before....  have no idea what happened....the music industry smelled success and ruined her???  have no idea....  the new recording....devoid of the genius of her previous work....completely devoid of the odd quirky humor....devoid of the musical genius....a complete wash out....listened to it twice and not once since......so sad....back to the old work....maybe next time.....
1594488916|5.0|Sometimes, I'll be attracted to a book just by its title . . . such<br />was the case with THE MAN WHO LOVED BOOKS TOO MUCH<br />by Allison Hoover Bartlett . . . the subtitle further intrigued me:<br />THE TRUE STORY OF A THIEF, A DETECTIVE AND A WORLD<br />OF LITERARY OBSESSION.<br /><br />Reading it, I became enthralled with the story about John Gilkey--a<br />thief who stole not for money but for love--the love of books . . . equally<br />fascinating was how the author's account of how Ken Sanders (the<br />self-appointed \\"bibliodick\\") would stop at nothing to catch him.<br /><br />I also liked how  Bartlett informed me about a world I knew<br />little about . . . one in which:<br /><br />* If you collect what you love and enjoy, and always buy the<br />best you can afford, and buy copies in the best condition<br />available, your books will always prove to be a good investment.<br /><br />In addition, I learned about how rare books get priced:<br /><br />* Much of a book's value depends on literary fashion, and tastes<br />change. Supply and demand also affect value. The first printing<br />of Hemingway's In Our Time, for example, was very small<br />(1,225 copies), in contrast to the fifty-thousand-copy print run<br />of The Old Man and the Sea. Pricing reflects that. Further<br />factors include whether there's a dust jacket (if not, the value<br />is negligible), and if those jackets are price-clipped, worn, torn,<br />or soiled. Modern first editions in poor shape can be worth as little<br />as ten percent of a \\"perfect\\" copy.<br /><br />And perhaps most interesting was a look into the mind of<br />the criminal himself, as when he was being interviewed about<br />his thought on whether what he had done was right or wrong:<br /><br />* \\"In terms of a percentage basis,\\" he said, \\"it's not like I'm<br />one hundred percent wrong. I'd say it's more like sixty<br />percent wrong and forty percent right. I mean, sure, that's<br />their business, book dealers, but they should make books<br />more accessible to people that like them.\\"<br /><br />Seeming to anticipate my reaction to this, he added, \\"That's<br />the kind of warped thinking I have.\\" But just as quickly, he<br />returned to his self-centered logic. \\"I mean, how am I<br />supposed to build my collection unless I'm like, this multimillionaire?\\"<br /><br />THE MAN WHO LOVED BOOKS TOO MUCH might not<br />motivate you to become a collector, but it will certainly<br />give you a deeper appreciation for that particular hobby.the kind of warped thinking I have.\\" But just as quickly, he   returned to his self-centered logic. \\"I mean, how am I   supposed to build my collection unless I'm like, this multimillionaire?\\"    THE MAN WHO LOVED BOOKS TOO MUCH might not   motivate you to become a collector, but it will certainly  give you a deeper appreciation for that particular hobby.
0812973992|5.0|Lyrical, passionate, and utterly engrossing, Colum McCann's new novel is a brilliant kaleidoscope of characters longing for something greater than an ordinary life, yet struggling to make that happen.  It takes its place beside Zoli and Dancer as one of the best contemporary novels I've read in recent years.  A bravura performance.
B002GY9F9K|4.0|Fantastic Quality and absolutely awesome. However, I can't help but notice the missing extras which I am looking forward to seeing. For example some of the behind the scenes footage? The gagreel? The commentaries are enjoyable.
B0000DENHZ|5.0|Loooooooooove this album. My favourite song is, of course, \\"Oops!... I Did It Aagain\\", I remember that I used to listen and dance this song every single day back in May-June 2000, taped the video and learned the moves lol. I really like the extra tracks, that's why I bought this version.<br /><br />Love U B!<br /><br />XoXo
B000UJ48VI|4.0|Había escuchado hablar mucho de esta película, pero no había podido verla. Pues bien, por fin la vi y no me decepcionó. Muy buena en todos los sentidos. Grandes actuaciones. La recomiendo.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I orignially saw the film in a Imax theatre and couldn't wait to get my hands on the DVD. Very well casted, acted, scripted and keeps your interests from start to finish. A must have for any trekkie. I bought three copies for xmas presents.
0800177177|5.0|If you haven't read the book Dracula, then this movie might be a bit strange to you.  However, this movie follows the plot line of the book almost exactly.  Of course the writer had to add in a love story, but it fits.  The first time I watched the film I was a little taken aback.  Some of the acting looked stiff and fake to me, and even some of the accents were childish in sound.  But, by the time the plot had picked up and the story had begun to unfold, I couldn't turn it off.  This is a classic that any movie fanatic should own.  You won't be disappointed if you buy this dvd.  ;)
B0026ZNL80|5.0|Riverside continues to be one of the all time great musical exports from Poland.  The band treads a line somewhere between metal and progressive rock.  Not as heavy as Opeth, but heavier than Porcupine Tree, Riverside have perfected a niche all their own that can appeal to a wide variety of people.  The band's fourth offering \\"ADHD\\" is another very strong disc, although I have to admit that I don't like it quite as well as their previous one.  The album contains 5 tracks that clock in just under 45 minutes.  Short by today's standards, but the filler is left by the wayside as every track serves it's purpose.  Instrumentally the band is solid as ever and Duda's vocals continue are still some of the best in modern prog today.  If you have liked previous Riverside releases you will undoubtedly enjoy this one.  If you are new to the band this is a good place to start.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|The actual series looks great:  much brighter colors than the original.  I had trouble viewing the additional stuff.  Still, worth every penny.
0684874350|5.0|If this book does not touch your soul, you may want to wonder if you have one at all. With each new page I found myself living the childhood of Frank McCourt.  It is so inspirational and heartwarming, and yet dark and even unbearable at times to imagine such a life.  Read it!! You won't be disappointed!!
B0026P3G12|5.0|To put it very simply this is an excellent CD. Yes the studio version of I dreamed a dream is different from the show but it should be. I was pleasantly surprised by the track choices which showed variety and range.
B001608QVS|5.0|Picture & sound quality are excellent, & there are more extra features than you can watch in one (or even two) sittings.
B00168OINK|5.0|Hadn't seen this until we saw it in blu-ray. It sure is gorgeous, and intelligent to boot, easily in the pantheon with the Incredibles, Up, Wall-E, and a few other recent masterpieces of animation.<br /><br />  Jack Black is quite perfect, Hoffman and the rest equally fine, and the script is excellent. I really can't find much to not like about Kung Fu Panda, either for kids or adults. There's enough smart humor for the elders and enough eye candy for any fan of color, composition, and animation in general. The form is used to perfection and it's clear that we are in a golden age of animation right now; the classics are coming fast and furious.<br /><br />It's also a very funny, wry movie, with sweet and snappy moments to spare.<br /><br />This is bound to be one of the dvds that parents use to pacify their kids, for decades to come. If they have to be watching the boob tube instead of reading or doing something truly useful (\\"Such a nice day and you're watching Kung Fu Panda AGAIN?!\\"), this is about as good a thing for them to be tv zombies with as can be found.<br /><br />This is in fact a work of art.<br />Not bad for a kids' flick.
0385532458|2.0|This is one Grisham Book that should have stayed at home....Not interesting and very slow. You could almost sense the author just making up things to hurry and get it over with.  Meme
B002MRROKS|5.0|I never saw this release coming, as I'm not the biggest Nirvana fan. But I picked it up on a lark, and it is mindblowing.<br /><br />This was captured when Kurt and the boys were at the absolute peak of their game -- a game that they were not destined to play for very long. That said, there is a quality to LIVE AT READING which puts it on some seriously hallowed musical ground...a musical moment for the ages which we are blessed enough to have an audio AND video souvenir from. Nirvana, indeed.
B0029LHW68|1.0|I waited years for this album, I LOVE 30stm.. but this... this.. wow.. It's terrible. I'm all for the evolution of a band and trying something new, but not this, this is crap. The album is boring, repetitive, dull, and just no good. When I first popped it in and gave the entire album a listen, I thought to myself \\"ok.. Maybe it'll grow on me\\"; after about 6 more listens I have come to the conclusion that it just plain sucks. Biggest disappointment in music I have had since Finch released their second album years ago.
B002MW50KO|1.0|I understand Dylan is an acquired taste. I love a lot of Dylan's early works. I figured, how could he go wrong with Christmas songs, ya know? Well.... Dylan managed to do it. You can hear the lung butter building up in his throat as he sings. It literally makes you feel ill listening to it. Any minute, you expect him to spit one heck of a loogie, but nope... he just keeps singing.<br /><br />So if you enjoy the sound of lung butter, this is a must buy.  Some of the tracks are actually fantastic classic Dylan, but the man just needed to clear his throat first... just one... simple... \\"AH-HEM!\\" and it would be easily a 3 or 4 star review. As is, however, it is just plain unlistenable.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies, and the Blu-ray is wonderful.  Would recommend this to any Hitchcock fan
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|I was very happy with the platinum edition 2-disc set of \\"Snow White\\" that was released in 2001.  In fact, I watched it with friends a few months ago and we all marveled at the clarity and high quality of the image and sound.  When the diamond edition blu-ray 3-disc set was released recently, I thought, \\"Why bother getting it?  How much better could the quality be?\\"  But when amazon offered the set at such a great price, I decided to splurge and I am not sorry I did.  This is truly the DIAMOND edition of the film!  The picture quality is amazing!  It is almost TOO pristine and crystal clear!  I've compared the images of both editions and there is no contest.  This diamond edition of  the Disney classic is the best you'll find!  I am very happy that I opted to upgrade to this new and improved edition of \\"Snow White.\\"  It is truly magical in every sense.  Hopefully, this is as good as it gets, because what's better than a \\"diamond edition?!!!!\\"
B001GCUER0|5.0|the only thing i don't like about this show is that the 1st season i never watched it.. saw two episodes at the end of the 2nd season that drew me in.. now i have seen them straight through from season one to present.. this is one of the best television shows ever!! clever.. smart.. funny,, dark.. i mean.. its got it all.. i love to watch movies but rarely find a television show i can/want to get into.. A+++!!
B00003CXC7|3.0|Just saw the glorious &quot;North by Northwest&quot; on the big screen at a local rep house, and browsing online reviews afterwards (&quot;Top Ten Films of the '50s,&quot; etc.), I was startled to see that &quot;Rear Window&quot; actually made more &quot;best of&quot; lists than &quot;NXNW.&quot;<br /><br />So--my faith in my fellow film-goers' good sense shaken to the core--I'm writing this brief review to throw some critical cold water on the idea that the competent but undistinguished &quot;Rear Window&quot; could ever deserve mention in the same breath with really first-rate Hitchcock, like &quot;NXNW,&quot; &quot;Vertigo&quot; or &quot;Psycho.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Rear Window&quot; is a stagy, stodgy piece of '50s mass entertainment. (The villain is Raymond Burr, for god's sake!) It's always struck me as one of those conservative, big-box-office-targeted popcorn movies that directors make to keep their Hollywood hitmaker cred--like, say, Warren Beatty's &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; or Scorsese's Howard Hughes bio-pic.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong--&quot;Rear Window&quot; isn't a bad film at all. It's cleverly conceived and written, in an old-fashioned well-made play sort of way. (The hero, stuck in a little bachelor apartment with a broken leg, spies a possible murder out his back window and has to catch the bad guy without ever leaving his room.) It's carefully plotted to dole out the suspense spoonful by spoonful, and has the requisite colorful minor characters--mostly quirky neighbors noted from afar through Jimmy Stewart's nosy binoculars.<br /><br />But it's one of Hitchcock's least personally-stamped films. Though there are some nice touches--it cocks an impudent eye at film's inherent voyeurism--more than any other movie of Hitchcock's great mature period, it seems a filmed version of somebody else's work. Like a stage play brought to the screen, say, though I know it wasn't that. (The screenplay was based on a short story.)<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart isa bit miscast as a hard-boiled war-and-disaster photographer; trying to play hard-bitten, he's wooden. And maybe it's me, but the opposites-attract, mildly troubled romance with society-girl-to-the-max Grace Kelly left me yawning, even rolling my eyes at times. (Yes, she sure is purty.)<br /><br />Now, contrast that with &quot;North by Northwest&quot;'s infectious filmic dynamism, from the classic crop-duster sequence that uses the screen so amazingly, to Eva Marie Saint's suavely torrid seduction of Cary Grant on the 20th Century Ltd., to the stunning finale literally all over Mt. Rushmore. And note how brilliantly all that deeply pleasurable inventiveness paints the movie's theme--of American individualism  embattled in an era of mass commercialism and Cold War deceit--right across an iconic American landscape. No mistaking a masterwork; nobody but Hitchcock.<br /><br />Sorry, but comparing &quot;Rear Window&quot; with a really great piece of Hitchcockian filmmaking like &quot;NXNW&quot;--or &quot;Vertigo&quot; or &quot;Psycho,&quot; films that changed the whole terrain of film--does NOT work to &quot;Rear Window&quot;'s advantage. It just shows it up as the perfectly okay but definitely second-tier piece of moviemaking it is.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This is why you own a HDTV and a Blu Ray player for beautiful movies like this one. If you like Pixar or a fan of animation in general this is fantastic.
B00008LOS1|5.0|Very good c d .  Two studio versions and a live show,  Material from other albums,different versions,  And a great value, great music,A classic.  I highly recommend it,you will be satisfied
B001KVZ6G6|3.0|This movie is pretty good, but seems to have more of a message for the older crowd. It didn't seem to hold the kids attention as well because it wasn't as action filled as they seem to like these days.
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|The Polar Express is awesome on blu-ray.  We had an old version on DVD.  The new version was a much better viewing experience.  As far as the movie goes; it is an excellent family movie.
0307346617|3.0|First of all, this book has some huge problems.  The issues of sex with zombies was never broached!  I read all 352 pages eagerly anticipating some sort of copulation scene.  I was somewhat gratified by a couple mentions of zombie nudity, but nothing even came remotely close to full on, hard core zombie/human coitus.      On a positive note, I did not have any trouble turning the pages like I do with some larger sized books.  I liked looking at the cover because it has a huge \\"Z\\" on it and that is my favorite letter in the English language.     I arrived to work early one day and was reading in my car.  I was so enthralled that I forgot to ash my cigarette and a huge chunk fell into the book.  So, now the book smells awful and my cat likes to sleep next to it.      I would purchase this book if I liked zombies and reading short stories about people interacting with them.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|The stories are grounded in reality-- well, at least as much as most Christmas movies, anyway. And though certain parts do stretch \\"realism\\", it's a about delivering the message that love is all around-- in many ways, shapes and forms. Some of the lines may be a bit corny, but the stories are clever-- as if to say \\"look no further than those around each of us\\". It's a new and creative way of looking at holiday films, which is intriguing and makes me want to curl up on the couch with hot cocoa and just enjoy.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I was never a fan of the Star Trek series -- I just never got into it.  But, now that I've seen this movie, I might reconsider.  The graphics were awesome and the screenplay was great.  The only reason I gave this movie a 4/5 is because they're are a couple of boring parts, but they only lasted a few minutes each.  I was also confused by some of the alternate reality stuff, which alters the original overarching plot of the series I suspect; why would they alter a story and characters that so many had come to love?  I shouldn't say anymore for fear of ruining the plot for you.  Overall though, I think the movie was very well done!
B0029LHW68|2.0|This new album takes the band in an entirely new direction, for the worse in my opinion.  Unfortunately the album title depicts the bipolar listening base's feelings moreso than anything else: you either love the sound, or you hate it.    My expectations for \\"This Is War\\" were very high after I fell in love with the first album and found some great songs in \\"A Beautiful Lie.\\"  My favorite aspect of this band was their extremely unique, dark space sound.  That has been almost entirely dissolved in favor of a mainstream sound.  I've been reminded of U2, Metro Station, Dirty Vegas, and even Fall Out Boy.  It's a shame that a great band like 30STM has fallen into the exact track that Linkin Park took; First album sounds new and great, second is questionable but good, and third is just a beggar looking for radio hits and for teenage girls to display \\"emotion\\" at concerts.    Gone in \\"This is War\\" is a that deep, curious, somber sound.  It is dropped in favor of a happier tone that does not mesh with the band's background.  Also, the summit choir was extremely over used in this album.  I understand that band wanted to involve the fans (albeit, the wrong fans as the choir sounds like a bunch of whiny teens), but it fails to add to the album.  While evaluating the songs, I cringed each time the crowd was thrown into a track.    The only palatable songs are Night of the Hunter and Stranger in a Strange Land.  I say palatable because you can put them in your mouth, but they don't taste good metaphorically speaking.  100 Suns is a whine fest, This Is War and A Call To Arms must not be about war because it is too damn happy and warm sounding, and the only thing that could have made Kings and Queens worse is a duet with Bono and an interpretive dance in the music video.    I'm sorry because I REALLY wanted to like this album, but I will be removing the gist of it from my iPod.  I was so happy that I'd finally found a band I could connect with and feel very passionate about; wayto ruin something great.  Like an upset parent would say: 30STM, I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed...severely disappointed.
B002KNFTAQ|4.0|Even after 500 pages, I was not ready for the book to end.  (So I've preordered THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST).  Not being familiar with the details of locations in Sweeden is not a problem and does not detract from the plot and the suspense of the book.  The heroine - Lisbeth Salander - is an independent, bull headed twenty something who has experienced serious physical and emotional abuse within the social services system.  She possesses extremely useful computer hacking talents as well as a photographic memory.  Both of which complicate her ability to deal with people.  She is viewed by many to be dangerous - the murderer of at least three people.  The hero - Mikael Blomkvist - is a magazine writer/owner who exposed wrong doing within financial institutions.  Now the project of the magazine is the illegal sex trade involving Swedish law enforcement, society and businesses.  The murder of two people who are working to document such evils triggers the hunt for LS who is accused of the murders and the efforts of those who believe in her to prove her innocent.
B002K0WBYG|5.0|This is such a funny movie! Not the best for children, but really great for adults!
B001MW0J2E|5.0|Great melodic and spacey indie pop. A very sublime mix of textural ambiance and electronic inspired rhythm blend with harmonizing vocals to form a catchy play list. The whole album is sequenced and layered coherently and certainly has a warm airy mood to it. Very worth checking out!
0553385461|4.0|I read this book as an extra credit option in my physics class.  I was not expecting much but was well pleased.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Take an evening, light some candles, grab a glass of wine and crank up the stereo with Susan Boyle's CD. It is an experience you will not believe; her voice, her message, her glorious delivery!!!!! You will be astounded!!!!!!
B001PO53IO|5.0|I'm a huge Star Wars fan and the full release of the 1st season on Blu Ray doesn't dissappoint.  In fact, the picture clairity is SO GOOD that it felt like I was watching the series for the first time.  The special features on the 3 disc set are packed full of wonderful commentaries from the voice talent behind the characters in addition to producers and directors.  Also, the color scetch book is a must have for any Star Wars geek.
B0029LHW68|4.0|.. to be able to spill them, spread them around, and then lay them before millions upon millions of people nation-wide. As soon as I popped it in the player after I got home, I found myself sprawled on the kitchen floor on the verge of tears, listening intently and empathetically to the sounds resonating experiences similar to many of our lives. Some we can only imagine. Many we wish to remember/forget.    The only thing I wish this had was a really hard, -REALLY HARD- war-like song really portraying the utter madness of it all, the feeling like there is a loss of control. But that's just me. The album is amazing though, honestly. Definitely worth the money. Especially if you're from the generation that grew up with synths (like the 80's). It brings back a slight sense of nostalgia. Love it!!!
B000TGCR38|5.0|I enjoyed this movie so much that I bought it as a gift for two other people. This has got it all. I am rarely moved by a movie but this is not to be missed. You will have to read English subtitles because it is spoken in Dutch and German. You will become so involved in it that you will forget you are reading. This is better than a good book. Light the fireplace, get the popcorn and drinks, and get ready to experience some quality entertainment. Definitely not a chick flick. Your man will truly enjoy this as well.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|You'll love this especially if you liked the original series or movies.  It really is great for anyone even those non-Trek types.  I do wish we chose the two disc version--brilliant clever movie.

B002LFPAUC|5.0|When Fawlty Towers started appearing on DVD a few years ago I was keen to replace my old VHS tapes, though something convinced me not to buy the boxed set that I saw in the shops. I'm so pleased I held off.    The quality of Fawlty Towers Remastered is excellent. There are extra interviews, a short item about Torquay and the Gleneagles Hotel and Donald Sinclair from which the show was inspired, and I especially love watching with the John Cleese commentary running. He gives the viewer so much insight into how the shows came together, who the actors were, why jokes worked or didn't work and plenty of other tidbits that are so fascinating to anyone who loves this show. I already know the scripts virtually word for word so John's commentary alone is well worth the investment. So pleased I bought it. Congratulations to John Cleese, Connie Booth et al for making this the most popular British sitcom ever.
B001H5X7KC|5.0|My husband had initially forced me to watch this movie about 5 times, so I decided to get him the Blu-ray with bonus material.  Now I myself can't stop watching it.  Who knew it could get better with a few extra clips.  Hilarious!
B0027HOBM2|2.0|Season Two of Mad Men is brilliant, and it needs to be to get through this terrible blu-ray disc. You put the discs in, and then there's just blackness for an inordinate length of time. You think the disc isn't working, but it is. Then an empty red battery appears on the screen. You follow its progress from not filled in at all to partially filled in, finally to completely filled in. Then more blackness. Then finally a Clorox commercial. More blackness. The MENU doesn't appear until who knows how long. And if you watch an episode and then stop and leave, when you come back, it will not take you to where you left off. Instead, you have to sit through the seemingly endless screen blackness all over again, then the battery slowly filling, then the commercial, etc. etc. I have one of the newest and highest rated blu-ray players out there. And I have not had this problem with any other blu-ray. This is by far the most poorly made blu-ray disc ever.
B002XHN776|5.0|Being a fan of 30 Seconds To Mars before they were signed to a record deal doesn't influence me here. I like a band for the music they create and if the creativity isn't there, I don't stay a fan. This band just keeps progressing creatively and delivering the most amazing music out there to date. From the Night Of the Hunter to Kings and Queens, the album doesn't disappoint. If this is your first listen of 30STM, the I strongly suggest you checkout their first two albums to see where this band has come from, how they've evolved and get a hint of where they are going. #THIS IS WAR
B000ZELISO|3.0|Somehow the plot seems to have been overlooked in this movie. The book was fantastic but the movie is pretty dull.  I can't imagine why the screenwriter felt so much of the book needed to be changed.  After all, we fans have bought the series because of the story.  Why change it?  And time constraints won't work as an excuse.<br /><br /> The opening was just ridiculous as was the burning of the Burrow.  Neither lent anything to the story; they were just there.  There is no reason why Dumbledore could not have picked up Harry at the Dursleys.  There was no point to those two incidents.<br /><br /> A great part of the story is the interplay between the main characters.  This has been botched in this movie.  With every successive book the bond grows tighter between the 3.  Now Ron and Hermione been relegated to a back seat and Harry is kind of listless. Hermione was a smart and strong female figure, now she's a shadow of herself. The books show Ginny as another smart,strong, funny female character akin to Hermione.  Where is this Ginny in the movies? In my opinion the stand out characters in the movie were the always wonderful Alan Rickman and Jim Broadbent. They are consistently believable which brings me to the unhappy characterization of Dumbledore.  I can never reconcile the Dumbledore in the movies (excepting Richards Harris' portrayal) with the Dumbledore in the books.<br /><br /> Are the director and screen writer so full of themselves that they think these changes are better then the stories we so avidly read?  Seems to me there is a lot of conceit here.<br /><br /> The musical score is non remarkable and basically adds nothing.<br /><br /> This is the 1st movie I'm not buying.  The 1st and 2nd movies hit it all right. Movies 3 & 4 were tolerable and then the real downhill slide began. I think the problem is those involved in the movie can't decide what audience they want to cater to; should this be a kids movie or an adult movie?  It ends up being neither.<br /><br /> Perhaps Harry Potter is not a great piece of literature to those involved in the production of these movies.  However, as a comparison of fantasy, Mr. Jackson treated the Lord of the Rings trilogy with respect and each movie was a gem.<br /><br /> As I watched the last movie I though of how great it could have been and frankly I'm saddened.  Perhaps those involved in the movies are just over the whole thing.t a great piece of literature to those involved in the production of these movies.

B002NOAF9W|5.0|Get Your Ya Yas Out captures the Stones at their raw unadorned selves.  The current Stones with all the sets, lights and backup are still great, but this album strips them down to basics and lets you really appreciate the guitar licks of Keith Richards and Mick Taylor.  The B.B. King and Ike and Tina Turner sets are also great
B001IAOEXU|5.0|The pelican dual triggers are a very good & inexpensive add-on (attach to the L2/R2 buttons) that makes the PS3 controller even better.

0743487486|2.0|This book has made me reflect on many aspects of my parenting.  Unfortunately, it did so by making me feel guilty and berated.  When I feel guilty and insecure, I become a worse parent - I fixate on my actions rather than on watching and responding lovingly to my child.    While reading this book I felt as though I was being manipulated by the highly rhetorical style.  Although it is at the complete opposite end of the spectrum to books like [[ASIN:0971453209 On Becoming Baby Wise: The Classic Sleep Reference Guide Used by Over 1,000,000 Parents Worldwide]], at the end, i felt with both books as though unworkable advice was being shoved down my throat.      I honestly wish I hadn't read it, because I can get the same parenting tips and information from other sources without the emotional baggage.  Try [[ASIN:0446504122 NurtureShock: New Thinking About Children]] for the same information about praise, for example.
B001MRMRS8|5.0|I have to say up front that I love this version of `La Traviata' and, while I agree with the reviewer who says that it should not be the first version that one should acquire, if you have others this will give a totally new (and appropriate) outlook on this most popular of Verdi's compositions. I already own the 1982 Zefferelli version from the Met, the 1994 Royal Opera House Covent Garden version with Angela Gheorghiu, the 2004 La Fenice production with Patrizia Ciofi, the 2005 from Madrid with Norah Amsellem, the 2006 Los Angeles Opera version with Renee Fleming and the 2008 La Scala, again with Angela Gheorghiu so, why buy another version? The answer is simply Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon.<br /><br />This 2005 Salzburg Festival production is the complete antithesis of `grand opera'. Apart from a number of sofas and a huge clock, there is nothing in the way of scenery. All of the chorus (men and women) are suited in black and the women are made-up to appear as men with Netrebko, who is seen wearing either a short simple red dress or else a simple white slip, always visible. I am amazed how effective this is on concentrating ones attention on the three main participants in this drama. Much credit is also due to Brian Large (probably the most experienced and gifted video director around) who never, for one moment lets what is happening on the stage drag on a moment longer than is necessary. His composition of the opening scenes of the opera is particularly effective.<br /><br />Although there are a few negative reviews listed here, I suppose you cannot please everyone. If you are an elderly person with a background going back many decades of watching traditional versions of `Traviata' this may not appeal but, if you like great singing and acting and don't mind a modern slant on probably the most famous `good-time girl' in drama, you will really enjoy this. The fact that this is available in Blu-ray with high definition audio and video at a fair price is a bonus not to be missed.ed.
B0029LHW68|5.0|It's been four years since the breakthrough album, [[ASIN:B000A7Q2DM A Beautiful Lie]], was released and yet, from the sounds of their third album, \\"This is War,\\" 30 Seconds to Mars didn't miss a beat. Despite being embroiled in a lawsuit with their record label which possibly inspired the album's title, Jared Leto and company seem as focused and able as ever, as their third effort manages to completely overshadow and surpass their previous efforts while simultaneously shaming their peers. At this point in their career, the band are playing in a league of their own and simply don't belong to a scene, and that's not a bad thing at all.<br /><br />Longtime fans will breathe a sigh of relief to find the band returning to the more experimental territory explored on their [[ASIN:B00006AFUR debut album]]. While that exact style isn't replicated here, it's important to note that the band isn't interested in producing a carbon copy of the very successful \\"A Beautiful Lie,\\" either. \\"This is War,\\" in fact, sounds unlike anything the band has produced before, and yet, exactly like the 30 Seconds to Mars you've always known. With producer Flood (Smashing Pumpkins, Nine Inch Nails) in tow, this third offering pries the band's style wide open, giving way to lush melodies, dense electronics and often epic moments.<br /><br />\\"Kings and Queens,\\" the first single currently burning up on the radio, is a perfect example of the growth achieved on \\"This is War.\\" Far removed from the emo tag the band was unfairly given on the previous album, 30 Seconds to Mars have in turn established themselves as one of the finest and freshest modern rock bands of the day with this single track. \\"Hurricane\\" - a song which featured Kanye West in its original form - is also typical of the album, with its soaring chorus accompanied by a tidal wave of emotion, not to mention a guest appearance by Brandon Flowers of The Killers on keyboards. Elsewhere, \\"Closer to the Edge\\" and \\"Night of the Hunter\\" are the perfect blend of the band's penchant for electronic and new wave influences merged with the dark pop sensibilities that garnered them such immense success way back when.<br /><br />Hands down, \\"This is War\\" is the best album the band has produced to date. It is without flaws or filler and embraces styles both past and present. With Jared's voice in top form and the band as well, this 12 song set should go a long way in appeasing the fanbase that waited four years as well as winning over newcomers while shedding the confinements of any specific genre. The third time is truly the charm with this band, and if every artist knew how to expand on their styles this efficiently, the music world would be a better place.f the band's penchant for electronic and new wave influences merged with the dark pop sensibilities that garnered them such immense success way back when.

B0017HMF6W|5.0|For years, this has been one of my favorite films, and it has aged remarkably well in its 50 years. However, the picture and sound quality had not fared well over the years. This restoration makes the film look better than it has ever, ever looked. It looks like it was shot yesterday. Even the subtlest of hue differences stand out. For example, two men, standing next to each other in one scene, both have dark suits. Previously they both looked like black suits, but now I can see that one was a charcoal/black suit while the other was a very dark navy suit. It's incredible. Even the sound has received great improvement. Although most of the sound tends to come from your center speaker, there is now true surround sound, and I have noticed some very well done spatial balancing in my home theater -- remarkable considering when the original audio track was laid down and what technology they were using at the time.    In short, if you like this movie, buy it and prepare to be awed by the restored picture and drastically improved sound!

B0029LHW68|5.0|I love this album! The sound is different from their previous albums but that is why it is unique. No one wants to hear a band that puts out the same kind of songs so this is a nice way for 30 Seconds to Mars to kind of mix it up alittle and re-invent themselves (like alot of the comments, a bit U2-ish) but that is very good. A break from the metal is good everynow and then. I don't what else I can say about it. Also strong lyrics and sound are the first thing that hooks me. Leto's voice---stellar! amazing! This is seriously one of my favorite album of the year. Some of the top ones for me would be: This is War, Hurricane(nice input with Kanye), Closer to the Edge, Night of the Hunter and Kings and Queens....wait all of them are good! i highly recommend!!so buy it now!!!!

B002SEW5WW|4.0|Was a big fan of \\"Dreaming Out Loud\\" and was only assuming their next effort had to be pretty descent.Guess I hit it right on the nose.From beginning to end ,there are upbeat soft rock and ballad type tunes mixed in for your pleasure.My only advice would be,go get \\"Waking Up\\" now.You will not be disappointed...One Republic will be making fine music for years to come.
B0029LHW68|2.0|I don't know.  I keep listening to this and nothing sticks.  It's not bad, but it's certainly not that great, either.  I like the lyrics, I love Leto's voice of course, but the chorus is distracting, and the melodies are pretty bland.  As a concept album it's okay, but it's inconsistent.  \\"Closer to the Edge\\" sounds like Gabriel Iglesias, \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" sounds like sleepy techno-Goth, \\"Hurricane\\" gets a little too close to hip-hop, \\"Search and Destroy\\" sounds like U2 with a few voice effects, and \\"Alibi\\" sounds like the Kings of Leon decided to write a lullaby.  It's like a \\"mix\\" station in a CD.  The best part of \\"This is War\\" are the lyrics, but lyrics alone would not make me want to buy this album.  I want music that will take me on a journey, not read me a poem.  Maybe I'll enjoy it more if I listen to it a few more times, but for the time being, I'm just not convinced.

B002GJT4XW|4.0|The BluRay transfer does nothing for the film. John Seale's sometimes flat, muddy cinematography and the rushed FX shots become even more jarringly apparent. The reincorporation of the deleted scenes is a nice feature, however.    The \\"Creating the World of Harry Potter\\" documentary on the second disc is a very welcome addition. I appreciate when the film makers and studios make a more straight-forward feature like this, especially for a family-friendly or children's movie. Too often they're burdened with boring, kid-friendly infomercials that recycle the same behind-the-scenes footage. Much like...    ...the third disc, which is disappointingly just a reprint of the bonus disc from the original 2-disc DVD release from 2002. While that disc was lauded at the time of its original release, the graphics are embarrassingly outdated now (WB couldn't spare a few thousand bucks for a menu refresh?)
B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|This is my favorite movie. Excellent  work. You can enjoy every second of it. Great script, cast & artwork, etc. What else do you need to make a movie like this.

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I have long been a Nathan Fillion fan, ever since his stint as Caleb on \\"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\\" and of course as Mal on Firefly & Serenity.<br />So I was already set to like CASTLE.<br />Not only do I absolutely LOVE this show, it rates as one of only 5 shows I bother to buy on DVD when released.<br /><br />An immature crime novelist paired with a \\"just the facts, ma'am\\" type of police detective. It's an oddball pairing that just flows so naturally and enjoyably in my opinion.<br /><br />Nathan as Richard Castle is pure comedic genius! His arrogance is laced with a kind of \\"playboy\\" charm that makes the character impossible not to like.<br /><br />Then there's Stana Katic who plays detective, Kate Beckett. The character is tough and smart, yet shows just enough sensitivity and heart to prevent her from being just some jaded (b)itch.<br /><br />The obvious chemistry the characters feels for each other is actually done believably. Castle is kind of blatent in his attraction toward her, while Beckett is more coy and playful about it.<br /><br />But what REALLY impresses me is how the stories don't feel like \\"Eh, they did that kind of episode on this OTHER show before.\\" The writers do a great job of taking what would normally be a \\"been there, done that\\" storyline, and they make it actually feel like I've never seen that kind of story before.<br /><br />The only bad thing I can say about this show isn't even ABOUT the show, but rather about the network. There are only 12 episodes in this first season, so you're only getting a little more than half of what you'd buy from a typical season's DVDs.<br />Also, while I loved the special features, they were very minimal. The best one is when Nathan Fillion spends a day with Stephen J. Cannell on how to portray a writer. Hilarious moments from both men!<br /><br />If you're a Nathan Fillion fan, this is a no-brainer: Buy this DVD set.<br />For the rest of the people reading this, all I can say is this: If you want to watch a well written drama for a change, that has some of the best comedy laced though it, this will DEFINITELY be worth buying!<br /><br />That's My Opinion, But You're Welcome To It!ed though it, this will DEFINITELY be worth buying!       That's My Opinion, But You're Welcome To It!
B001IFZL50|4.0|Excellent series. All I have to say is this \\"explicit\\" gave me PTSD.  In some scenes my heart was pounding and body trembling then I found myself right back in the sandbox which was about six years ago.  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it was too real. Brought back memories I'd rather not remember. I thought I was over this, thanks HBO.
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|Giving this film an `A' and calling it a masterpiece is really a given, so I'm just going to get that part of it out of the way.  The film is a beautiful and moving epic, complete with stellar performances, poignant life lessons and dramatic (and authentic) presence of life and destiny.  To consider this John Ford's triumph is not too farfetched if I say so myself.<br /><br />That said, this film rests oddly with me.<br /><br />For me, `The Grapes of Wrath' is John Ford's `Schindler's List' (or, I guess I should say that `Schindler's List' is Spielberg's `The Grapes of Wrath').  It is a moving and very `important' film that doesn't strike me the way I expected due to a coldness that permeates the screen.  The film is filled with elements and situations that would bring a stone-faced man to his knees, and yet I was more haunted than I was moved.  There is a detachment I felt here that, like `Schindler', works just as much as it doesn't.<br /><br />Like I said in my review of `Schindler's List', it may be an empty argument, but it is one worth raising.<br /><br />This film is based off the novel by Steinbeck, which I haven't read but have on my reading list.  I know that this film, while faithful, has altered the source material a tad (especially in the ending) but so few complaints have been thrown that way, even from devoted fans of the novel.  The film was made at a time when a `happy ending' or at least the portrayal of hope was needed.  A film depicting the raw and harsh realities of the depression needed to end on a high note if it was going to lift any spirits.  Even with the altered ending though, `The Grapes of Wrath' is a real downer, a film that exposes humanity at its coldest and cruelest (although I was moved more by the slivers of kindness).<br /><br />The story is that of the Joad family, a group of hard working, loving people who are forced out of their homes and sent looking for work.  Tom, the eldest son, was recently released from prison, and he serves as the head of the house basically, helping his parents and siblings make their long journey to California.  Along the way they meet greed and desperation in many forms.<br /><br />The acting is a triumph here on all ends.  Henry Fonda carries a solemn understanding in his eyes as he watches everything around him crumble, and he really carries every scene of this film.  John Carradine is also fantastic as Casy, the former preacher who has lost his spirit due to the circumstances that engulf him.  Standout here is Jane Darwell, who actually won the Oscar for her tremendous performance.  Her pleading with Tom to stay and help her, oh, that moment touched me more than any other moment in the film.<br /><br />`The Grapes of Wrath' is a film that is filled with frustration and depression, but as the final frames begin to roll we are offered a sliver of hope, as Ma Joad swells our hearts with her ideals on humanity and the will to survive.<br /><br />Still...<br /><br />Like I said, there is a detachment here.  It is a great movie, one that gets everything perfect, and, like `Schindler', that is the big problem.  Everything is `too' perfect.  I know that it seems like a weak complaint (and if this goes anything like my `Schindler's List' review, it won't be a popular one either) but it is a legit one if you look at it properly.  Everything is so `authentic' that it runs the gamut of stiff and feels nearly documented.  It takes away from the languid naturalness of the nature of film.  Like I said, debating the films brilliance is ridiculous, but for a film that is primed and ready to move you, this one may not do it one the immediate.<br /><br />This makes sense to me, but then again, it's me!helping his parents and siblings make their long journey to California.

045122499X|3.0|I read \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" Follett's previous historical novel.  I forced myself to finish this one, hoping somewhere there would be a payoff!  His characters aren't well defined,( which does not affect his spy thrillers so much,that move at steadier pace) His dialogues here seem stilted & do not cause much empathy with the characters (who all seem to be just reinvented versions of those in \\"Pillars..\\")  So I  was disappointed. I usually enjoy Follett's novels, but this seemed a chore most of the time.      I think he researched so much ,he felt he had to include various things which were rather interesting , but distracted from his story.   The way he presented the conversations between characters were more or less sentences with not much description of the feelings behind them. Like a police report of what was said.      There were good parts, the war sequences in France were the most exciting but his constant vilifying of Ralph was non-stop.  This guy had almost no redeeming qualities!    Also the author seemed to have nothing good too say about the early church.  In his opinion religion of the day was \\"totally corrupt\\"! So any sympathy toward the nuns or others seem misplaced, since they must have all been dupes.

Did IQ's suddenly DROP at the company responsible??!<br /><br />I'd like to find the imbecilic MORON who ok'd this change and punch him/her in the head!!!

That it's back in fine form after 2 not-quite-as-good seasons? That it REALLY makes me look forward to the final season? Well..........you already know that or you don't watch the show and probably will never see this review!!
B0029LHW68|4.0|I'm surprised to see that I haven't even reviewed `A Beautiful Lie' yet, which is one of the best rock albums of the decade.  When I saw that 30 Seconds to Mars had released their third album I had to snatch it up (and at WHAT A PRICE!).  I see that people either love this album or pan it.  It deserves neither really.  Where `A Beautiful Lie' succeeded in being something unique and powerful, `This Is War' succeeds in being a reminder of that fact.<br /><br />This is a good and a bad thing.<br /><br />The biggest complaint here is that the album has not defining moments.  There is nothing here that sounds like a step up or a venture, but everything sounds like B-Sides to their tremendous sophomore album.  That is what I mean by this album being a `reminder'.  The tracks here are all decent to great even, but they seem to constantly point a finger at what has already been accomplished.<br /><br />I wanted to see some growth.<br /><br />The album opens flawlessly.  `Escape' is short, simple and sweet.  It totally gets me excited for what I'm about to experience.  Sadly, the letdown is about to set in, but for the moment I am sky high (and who wouldn't be, with the distant cry from pounding drums).  The album bleeds right into `Night of the Hunter', probably the best track on the album.  It is a truly stellar addition to the album, with infectious beats, haunting vocals and stellar composition.  It rivals anything on `A Beautiful Lie'.<br /><br />My expectations are very high at the moment.<br /><br />The only other tracks on the album that resonate that high with me are `Hurricane', `Alibi' and `Stranger in a Strange Land'.  They really play with length here (all three are 6+ minute songs), but they really make the most of the time.  `Alibi' is a very raw and stripped down song.  It is actually quite beautiful to listen to, and it softly contrasts with the rest of the album in a delightful way.<br /><br />`Kings and Queens' was a good choice for a single (very catchy and instantly likeable), and while it is not my favorite track here it does sit well with me.  It just seems too familiar, too `easy'.  That is my main complaint with tracks like `This is War' or `Closer to the Edge'.  There just isn't anything special about these songs.  `Vox Populi' opens astonishingly and appears to really cause a tonal shift in the album, one that I was really aching to welcome.  The pounding opening, the chanting, everything just seemed to scream \\"NOTICE ME\\" and I was noticing it.  Sadly, once the actual song kicks in, it just falls back into familiar territory.  It doesn't really embellish on the promise that it set off with.<br /><br />`L490' closes the album with an interesting instrumental that is fine but feels unnecessary.<br /><br />That leaves us with the two songs I just don't like.  `100 Suns' is just lazy and hollow.  It's sad because it is something different (a faux live acoustic track) but it just comes off repetitive and pointless.  `Search and Destroy' is just mediocre.  I loved the way it opened and really wanted it to be better, and then it just crashed.<br /><br />Still, this is a good album and one that fans can enjoy, and it is one that could easily garner new fans.  Songs like `Kings and Queens' as well as `Night of the Hunter', `This is War' and `Alibi' seem destined for radio and they will make a splash.  I just really want them to expand on their arsenal with tracks that challenge them and broaden their horizons.<br /><br />Jared Leto BELONGS in this industry (much better rock-star than movie-star!).ite track here it does sit well with me.

0307716988|5.0|I remember hearing about this book when the album Bad came out in the late 80's but I didn't have the money to buy it (I was six).  But when he was promoting his \\"This Is It\\" tour, it immediately came to mind to me.  After his death, I wanted to learn more about him than what all the carpetbagger biographers were trying to sell as a grieving fan.  So I bought the book.  It was wonderful. He was very articulate, explaining the creation of Jackson 5 and inside secrets of the Jackson family.  He also goes into great detail about the process of becoming a solo artist and creating the albums \\"Off the Wall\\" and \\"Thriller.\\" It is almost poetic the way he describes merging the music with the lyrics! If you really want to know Michael the man and Michael the artist, you need to buy and read his own autobiography. Who would be better to tell his story than the man himself?

B00005JLZN|2.0|This film disappoints me.  You take Kate Winslet (MY FAVORITE WORKING ACTRESS, PERIOD), the phenomenal Kevin Spacey, the brilliant Laura Linney and the sultry Rhona Mitra, team them up with 2-Time Oscar nominated director Alan Parker and hand them the controversial subject of the death penalty and yet, when all is said and done, there is just something so off here.<br /><br />How does something like this happen?<br /><br />I admit, when I first saw this movie I really liked it, and I think that a lot of it had to do with the preconceived notions I wouldn't allow myself to see past.  I wanted this to be all sorts of brilliant, and when it fell short I convinced myself that I wasn't seeing what I was in fact seeing.<br /><br />I have to face the truth.<br /><br />The film follows a reporter, Bitsey Bloom (the name is the first of many missteps), as she attempts to prove the innocence of former teacher David Gale who is accused of brutally murdering his friend Constance Harraway.  He maintains his innocence despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.  His story sends Bitsey on a journey into the darkness that surrounded Constance's death.<br /><br />A journey that is rather pointless.<br /><br />The film cuts back and forth between the present and past to develop the character's and establish David's innocence and keep the viewer on constant edge as they race against the clock with Bitsey to uncover the truth.  There are the obvious creeps (Matt Craven is a ridiculously overworked clich&eacute; here) who have to be involved somehow, but the most ambiguous character is David himself, who just seems to be a lost soul.  My issue here is that, when all is said and done and the twist upon a twist is finally revealed, it becomes apparent that the journey David sends Bitsey on is POINTLESS.<br /><br />It was all something that could have been revealed in a much easier way.<br /><br />The acting is a little all over the place, which is said when you consider the cast.  To be honest, despite the absurdity of the film itself, Spacey is actually very, very good.  He really captures the destitution of this man, which is given multiple layers when the end is revealed and you see that his depressive nature is not really a result of his `impending death' but more or less because of his conscience weighing heavy on his shoulders.  The script didn't deserve his dedication to the role.  Laura Linney is effective, but her character comes off less human and more clich&eacute;.  Like I said, Winslet = the greatest actress working today, BUT, her performance here is weak.  She just doesn't do anything.  I disagree with some friends who say she is Razzie worthy here (that is just plain dumb), but she doesn't deserve any accolades for this one.  It's is a barely there, somewhat uneven (thanks to the thankless script) and desperate performance.<br /><br />In the end it is the horribly constructed script that does this film in.  It has an important message (the controversy surrounding the death penalty being legal murder is a strong one) but it is a message that has been perfectly developed in much better films (`Dead Man Walking' is one of the best films EVER MADE).  This is a pointless, messy and aggravating film that had all the elements to be perfection but wound up being a BIG mistake.ly very, very good.

B00000DHRZ|5.0|Say what you want about the offspring \\"selling out\\" to a major record label. The result was a cleaner sound, and a very consumable  end product which probably helped  the popularity of the offspring's older work. Americana is a series of infectious guitar progressions and catchy vocals.    Nobody ever claimed they broke new ground or changed the world with this album, it is however a very strong album that will be in my collection forever. This kind of punk rock is definitely extinct today, and this album is a gem, and a lasting reminder of why the offspring were considered one of the most influential American punk groups.    My favorite tracks:    She's got issues (The guitar riff that noodles wails on throughout the song is addicting)  Starin' at the sun - interesting lyrics and a classic 1990s power-punk chord progression make this song an anthem.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|The new movie \\"Michael Jackson: This is it\\" is a very interesting and captivating movie. This movie is about the 50 date concert rehearsals that were supposed to take place in London. It was supposed to be Michael Jackson's big comeback. This movie is very important because it is real footage of Michael Jackson in his final days. I would give this movie a 5/5. The movie was perfect except that they could of made a short clip of Michael Jackson's life. If you were a big fan of Michael Jackson, you should definitely go see this movie. Also, if you weren't really a fan of Michael Jackson you should go see it anyway just to see one of the greatest entertainers that ever lived.

B002XHN776|5.0|Their original self titled album was good.  A Beautiful Lie was great.  This Is War is absolutely the best album yet. I have not stopped listening to this since the download.  It is one great song following another.  Vox Populi and Hurricane are among my favorites.  100 Suns is short but speaks volumes in terms of lyrics.  The title track is absolutely the best on the album.      I would download this album and make sure everyone you know hears it and gets it also.    Provehito in Altum

0451169514|5.0|It - Stephen King     Wow, what a ride.  First let me start by saying, before this book I didn't like horrors - books,  movies, whatever, I had pretty much avoided them my whole life.   Well I'm in my mid thirties and I'm glad to report that this book has  opened up a whole new genre for me. What an exhilarating experience  reading horror is.  This book was forced on me by an avid book reader and thank **** for  that- what an exhilarating, amazing read. Turns out horror isn't all about  blood and gore - This is a great yarn! Summertime, kids, secret hide-outs,  small town America, coming of age, adults returning home to face  childhood demons and yes it scared the pants off me - I remember an  episode of Friends when Joey would store `The Shinning' in the freezer  when it got to much for him, well I was very tempted to do the same with  `It'.  Look, if you're like me and horrors are not really your thing but you love  reading great books then put your reservations aside and crack into this  beauty - you will not be disappointed.  Just make sure to leave some space in your freezer box.

What else did I expect from a Sony product)<br />Thank you for nothing Sony. I could not tell you how it sounds or how it works because you made it difficult for normal people to get it to work.
B00003CWL6|5.0|Amazing story, excellent direction and acting is all you will find out here. It's so well focussed on some people in America, their day to day life, the emotions, the feelings are all genuine and you actually feel you are meeting a family next door. Kevin Spacey is impeccable, makes it totally believable in the charecter of 'Lester Burnham', his wife played by Annette Benning was simply amazing, so was Thora Birch as his daughter. An excellent cast-chemistry and the flow of the film goes on pretty well. Almost everyone delivers a wonderful performence, its erotic, its hot, its fabulous, its decent and most of all genuine. Definately worth a watch!
B002XHN776|4.0|Love this album, and so glad the work with Kayne West didn't make it to the album. Not a fan of his, and think it would have brought the album down. Have been a huge fan of 30 Seconds to Mars from the beginning and been waiting for this. So happy it's finally out!
B001AQMBJQ|4.0|Lost is a show that is complex, with multiple stories intertwining.  However, Lost Season 5 takes it to a new level.  The interwieving time travel story, where flashbacks involve differnt times, both forward and backwards is so heavy and intricate, the season begs to be rewatched.  The trouble is that a show like lost, which has been creating mysteries and plots for four years had to have a season this complex and confusing to provide the set up to the final season.  Much like in chess, a number of pieces must be put in place prior to check mate, season 5 sets up a number of stories and characters for its final season.  Through the complexity you find a well acted, and well driven story.  Sime revelations are made, some of which people have been guessing for some time, others which were completely unexpected.  All of this was brought together in one of the best cliffhangers I've seen on television.  When season 6 premieres, I'll be watching.    As to the Blu Ray, the picture is gorgeous, especially the outdoor shots, with a pretty good smattering of special features, though I would have preferred a few more.  Sometimes when I watch special features on the Blu Ray/DVDs, I feel the cast, crew, and producers are holding back on information, just to not spoil things that are coming, and I especially felt that here, where the features didn't really give any insight into the future of the show, but was mostly retrospective.  Overall, this show is great, with a great presentation on blu.  Highly recomended!
B00104W8T6|4.0|What I love most about this CD is the listening ease of the songs. Yes there are a few that I skip over (tracks 8 & 18 specifically) but I pretty much listened to this CD non-stop for the first month after I purchased it. The songs are mellow and endearing.    I believe Amazon provides samples of each track if you're not sure this is your kind of music. Buy and enjoy!
B00006FDCD|1.0|The basic plot of IT is a group of kids come together to fight a monster lurking underneath the town, & come together again years later as adults to finish the job.  As the book is over 1000+ pages, & seeing as how this mini series is 3 hours, it was inevitable that things would be cut.      The problem is, there is so much more to the book than just monster hunting.  All of the themes & character development in King's novel got cut.  The movie has extremely little of those things, so each scene is just one Pennywise encounter after another.  This, quite frankly, is rather boring.  The way King wrote the story was much more absorbing & riveting than whats shown in this.  In King's book, there are many, many scenes with the characters interacting, or descriptions of Derry & its history, so I think its much more frightening when Pennywise does show up.    But apart from that, the adult actors are miscast & have no chemistry with each other.  To be fair, the story was totally rushed & had very little character development, so the actors didn't have much to work with, but its a problem because one of the themes in King's book is friendship.    And of course, the movie is also ineptly made.  What is with the cheap TV style score?  It made it seem more cheesy than serious.  They don't even capture the mood & atmosphere of King's novel, & this awful score doesn't help.  The cinematography is bland & uninspired.  There are no interesting shots.  Oh, I also musn't forget the atrocious editing.  For instance, the close ups of Pennywise showing its \\"scary\\" teeth are so painful & cheesy to watch.  They don't mix in with the other shots in the scenes.    I won't get into the awful special effects at the end either, other than to say since they changed so much of King's story they might as well changed the ending too.  This movie is not even close to being scary, & its like its supposed to be some bad parody of King's amazing book.     On the positives, I will say Curry was good,albeit he played the role for laughs rather than scares.  I understand he's a clown, but he's much more scary in the book.  The child actors were well cast, & some of the scenes were faithful to the book.  Apart from these things, this movie is complete garbage.  Read the book instead.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Though I'm not usually the type to admit this, UP made me cry.  I'm not talking teary eyed, or the sniffles, I'm talking balling tear soaked faced, embarrased crying.  It's not because the movie is more sad than others, but because the movie found a way to connect with me that most can't.  This isn't the story of someone who was disappointed with his life or marriage, but someone who didn't get to fulfill every part of it.  My mom said to me when I was younger that life is what happens when you're making other plans.  Up understands that, and uses it to create a fantastic film, with loveable characters that I can watch again and again.  Pixar movies only seem to get better, and I can't say enough about this movie other than you need to see it.    Also, I very much liked that the blu ray included the dvd, and digital copy.  While most don't care for these extras, at no extra price I was able to watch it in blu ray (its gorgeous in case you were wondering), then over the weekend, I took the dvd over to my girlfriends family's to watch it again.  Sure, not a big thing, but something Disney gave to make my viewing experience a little better.
B000OCZD5G|3.0|This classic movie looks good! It is not a great transfer which may be because of the original source material 's condition, or the movie company and/or director 's decision on how best to retain the film 's quality. I love this movie and it does come across in Blue Ray as being updated well visually and the audio is rounded out in detail in hearing some slight nuances.    I would have liked to have had more in the Special Features (such as a documentary/interviews to view). But, the commentary is really insightful!        I recommend this purchase if you don 't own this movie for home viewing!
1881273156|3.0|A quick and easy read that may or may not \\"change your marriage.\\"  Did it change my life? No.  But since it probably only takes a day or two to read through, it might just be worth taking that chance.    I didn't find this book to be overly religious like some of the negative reviews, but I would probably have enjoyed it more if the concept had included evolutionary biology evidence.  I thought adding some research findings in psychology would have helped beef up his ideas.  Much of his argument for this counseling method was anecdotal which was interesting, but unconvincing.    However, what was convincing was using the book as a sounding board between me and my husband.  It sparked some interesting discussion, and we did find that some of his tips were fun and helpful, although I wouldn't say our marriage was any trouble.  We found it even more helpful in relating to our children, making me wonder if I should have gotten the kids version instead.
B0017HMF6W|4.0|We all know the film is a masterpiece but now, with this new edition, we can watch it in the best possible conditions. The work on the restoration and on the blu-ray edition is fabulous! It's like if it had been filmed last year! Picture and sound have been improved at their best. I've only given 4 stars because the special features section has no foreign subtitles. Warner haven't done a good job with the subtitles on the bonus features. The back cover says \\"French, Spanish, German, Italian and Portuguese\\" but NO, there are only English subtitles. It's a deceptive advertising, a big mistake and a total disappointment because the special features section contains many interesting documents. Unfortunately, foreign buyers can't appreciate that section! I've checked the French blu-ray edition and it is absolutely the same mistake. So, if you want the subtitles on the special features, forget that blu-ray edition!
B00288KNLS|5.0|I saw this movie in the cinema and was extremely impressed. Not only is the animation top notch, but the themes within are deep enough for adults, yet easily understood by children. A great family movie. The 3D leaves something to be desired, though.
B0028SVXR6|2.0|I haven't even been able to listen to more that a few minutes of this album without turning it off in boredom.  The only reason it's getting two stars is I haven't listened to all of it yet.  Maybe there's that one good song, but chances are I won't find it.

0887307280|5.0|This is one of the best business books I have ever read. In terms of telling you HOW to run your business, it is the best. It is deceptively simple-looking.<br /><br />Gerber uses a (fictional?) woman bakery entrepreneur to make his theory of entrepreneurship a bit less \\"theoretical\\". Putting his claims about business into a story-context like this serves to move the story along and make it, actually, entertaining. People learn best when the teaching is contained in a story form.<br /><br />What is the e-myth? Basically, it is that a good plumber will make a good plumbing company operator. The temptation for most people is to work IN their business (as a plumber) rather than ON their business (as an... entrepreneur!). The latter must develop systems for his company (including employees) to function within; the former must only work within those systems developed \\"from above\\" or \\"outside\\".<br /><br />So that is the e-myth, but if you have not read The E-Myth Revisited, I highly, highly, highly suggest doing so. Gerber's book will serve as a mallet pounding over and over on your head (in a pleasant but unforgettable way) and you will be a lot less likely to fall into the trap of being an employee inside your own business. At the very least, it will become very clear what the job of an entrepreneur is and how that fundamentally differs from bring a worker-employee.<br /><br />For those interested, I originally heard of The E-Myth Revisited through Tim Ferriss's book The 4-Hour Workweek (another must-read, which is recently out in an updated edition, linked below). Ferriss cited Gerber's book as one of his Top 4 formative books for himself.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0307465357 The 4-Hour Workweek, Expanded and Updated: Expanded and Updated, With Over 100 New Pages of Cutting-Edge Content.]]<br /><br />Also, I have not currently read any other Gerber books, so don't be intimidated about jumping in with this \\"Revisited\\" book as your initial foray into the E-Myth series. It stands completely on its own.
1593081316|3.0|Although an interesting read, the story did not age well with time due its popularity and how familiar many are to the ending twist.

B0017TFLBQ|4.0|HofMM III is really the game that I want from this package, as IV is just not that enjoyable now that V is out.    However, III crashes frequently on my 64bit win7 and surprisingly doesn't run at all on win7's xp mode. The outdated graphic resolution for III also means that my monitor is too big for the game.

0393312836|5.0|Anthony Burgess' 1962 novel A Clockwork Orange paints a horrifying, grim, dystopian future. Your Humble Narrator - or, Alex - and his three droogs spend their evenings and nights beating, raping, torturing and stealing from any person unlucky enough to be in Alex's path. One evening, however, the gang turns on Alex and he is set-up, with the police arriving just as he murdered an old woman in her house.     Off to jail he goes, having to serve over a decade in a prison over-stuffed, with six or more people sharing a cell designed for two or three prisoners at most. Alex, however, is given the choice to take part in a new program that will get him out of the prison in two weeks, and back to the outside world to live his life as he sees fit. This new program, however, is not something Alex expected; Alex was tied to a chair, with his eyes taped open and forced to watch horrible acts of violence and murder - acts all-too familiar and enjoyable to Alex - as an injected chemical makes him feel nauseous and sick. After two weeks of this treatment, Alex would feel sick at the mere thought of violent acts.    The treatment worked, and Alex's life became a living nightmare, as his former friends were now police officers and old victims were able to exact their vengeance upon Alex. A failed attempt at suicide left Alex in the hospital - cured of Ludovic's experiment - and a return to the life of violence and crime he once knew.    So ends the previously published American version, short one chapter that had been published in the UK. Burgess claims the American publisher made the decision to leave out the final chapter while the publisher claims it was \\"merely a suggestion made for conceptual reasons.\\" Regardless, the American version misses a chapter that is vital to the message: the power of choice.     One of the characters - the prison chaplain - asks the questions, \\"Does God want goodness or the choice of goodness? Is a man who chooses the bad perhaps in some way better than a man who has the good imposed upon him?\\" Through the experimental punishment to rid Alex of his evil ways, he no longer had a choice in his actions. This brings a moral dilemma, discussed by a panel after Alex has completed his punishment. \\"He ceases to be a wrongdoer. He ceases also to be a creature capable of moral choice,\\" argued one person, but the general consensus was that, \\"We are not concerned with motive, with the higher ethics. We are concerned only with cutting down crime...and with relieving the ghastly congestion in our prisons.\\" This moral dilemma, the ability to choose right or wrong, good or evil, is the message of Burgess' work. The final chapter completes the story and how Alex chooses and acknowledges this moral choice.    A Clockwork Orange is written in a peculiar way - the entire book uses the nadsat language created by Burgess. Not so much a language, rather heavy slang influenced by Slavic languages, the use of nadsat creates a unique world the reader becomes entranced in. It also helps to alleviate the gruesome nature of Alex and his friends, putting more focus on the message rather than the brutal acts of violence. While some may be put off by the confusing language at first, Burgess does an excellent job introducing it and using each new word in context easy to understand and grasp, and before long the reader will be reading at his/her normal pace.

0307277453|4.0|Your Inner Fish is a wonderful and enthusiastically written book on evolution and the connection between all species of creatures on Earth. What do humans have in common with fish? A lot, actually. Neil Shubin takes the reader on an adventure of paleontology and biology to examine different body parts and where they originated and how they developed. In Neil's own words,    \\"Looking back through billions of years of change, everything innovative or apparently unique in the history of life is really just old stuff that has been recycled, recombined, repurposed, or otherwise modified for new uses. This is the story of every part of us, from our sense organs to our heads, indeed our entire body plan.\\"    From the arms, forearms and wrists to the eyes, brain, nerves and ears, to embryonic development and various genetic similarities, Neil combines his excitement for his work with a remarkable prose to provide a basic and general overview of evidence for evolution and common ancestry, in a very simplified way. The many pictures and diagrams interspersed do an excellent job simplifying many ideas, and provide wonderful clarity for many of the ideas.

0385333846|4.0|Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five, or The Children's Crusade is a witty, comedic, yet sad satire of war. The story follows Billy Pilgrim during World War II, as he becomes \\"unstuck in time\\". His life jumps around; he is able to see his death but not be dead and relive moments of his past and experience moments of his future long before they take place. Some of those moments include his experience in World War II, the bombing of Dresden, and living on the distant planet Tralfamadore - yes, that is correct. Vonnegut blends science fiction into his anti-war satire. The result is a highly entertaining read, with moments of comedic bliss quickly followed by sad futility on an insight into humanity (and Tralfmadorianity).

0765318741|5.0|Richard Matheson's I Am Legend is a short story about a man named Robert Neville, the last living human on the planet. To complicate things, due to a bacteria there are now vampires running amok who know where he lives. By day he hunts the vampires and kills them while they sleep, by night he inebriates himself and holes up in his house. He finds a dog, and another survivor, but both feed the fire of despair, loneliness and inebriation. And by day the legend grows.<br /><br />Matheson weaves a compelling and frightening tale, and the emotions of Robert Neville are felt by the reader. The ending offers a wonderful twist, and the original story is far better than the recent Will Smith film of the same name. I Am Legend is such an influential story that it almost single-handedly invented the vampire/zombie apocalypse genre that is so prevalent in modern cinema.<br /><br />This specific omnibus also features ten other short stories. A reader unfamiliar with Matheson may pass over them, or read them expecting very little compared to the titular story, but reading them will quickly change the readers mind. Several of the short stories are wonderfully frightening, and they all offer a horrific twist at the end. Highlights include Prey, Madhouse, and Person to Person, although each story is well written and highly entertaining.

1563890410|5.0|What happens when Lucifer decides to leave hell? Season of Mists, the fourth volume of The Sandman answers that question as Dream heads to Hell to release a former lover who has been imprisoned and tortured for thousands of years. Upon arrival, he finds Hell empty, and Lucifer hands him the key to the kingdom.    Gaiman draws a multitude of mythology and mythological characters into this volume, as representatives of many mythological groups seek the key to Hell from Dream. This provides an interesting look at the interactions between them (Thor getting ridiculously drunk and hitting on women during the banquet, for example). The character of Lucifer is excellent as well, and God's reward to the two angels who oversaw Dreams decision? Well, that's up to the reader to decide.    This is the best of the first four volumes in the series, and should not be missed by fans, nor casual observers.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This documentary was fantastic. Are there better ones out there on this subject? Sure. \\"The Future of Food\\" was particularly good, but \\"Food, Inc.\\" is a film a larger audience can relate to. That's my opinion anyway. I'm seriously thinking of sending copies of this film as a holiday gift to friends. I understand the blight of the chicken house industry that was once vibrant in parts of the South and have heard personal stories of people going in serious debt as a result. Up here living in the Midwest, corn and corn-fed beef (and ethanol) are all the rage. News of raids and deportation of immigrant workers in Postville, Iowa, doesn't arouse as much public concern as one might hope. Though people in this state do celebrate farmers' markets and have fabulous locally-grown produce. Interesting to behold the organic movement catching on right in America's Heartland where much of the corn is grown. I hope it catches on more in the future and we can break our dependence on the failing food system we have now.<br /><br />I learned of Polyface Farm years back and wish we had access to their products out this way, but understand that violates their principle of keeping it local. The Polyface Inc. website lists restaurants where their products are used and \\"metropolitan buying clubs\\" for interested consumers in Virginia and Maryland. That's really nice how they have their sustainable farming business running, and I'd love for us to protect the few smaller family farms we have left out this way. Organic farming is such a good idea.<br /><br />Monsanto is the closest thing to pure evil I've yet to confront. Wow. The more I learn about them, the more shocked I am that people haven't sounded alarms sooner. Aside from creating Agent Orange during the Vietnam War, they now provide a variant on RoundUp Ultra for our U.S. drug policy aerial fumigation campaign in Colombia, which is causing a humanitarian crisis in case anyone didn't know. Monsanto is also behind the global \\"boom\\" in golf courses, which rely on their lawncare products. Read up on biological patents and Monsanto and see how many patents they have accumulated. This is a company we seriously need to avoid from here on out, even if that means accepting a few weeds from time to time, mmmmk?

Great film that I'd recommend to my friends.  :)
0439023491|5.0|This book was SOOOO good!! I LOVED The Hunger Games and I thought that Ms. Collins couldn't possibly top it with Catching Fire, but she did. I'm not going to give anything away but let's just say I was up until 2:30 in the morning reading this book and had to force myself to stop reading. I then finished it the next day. I can't wait for the final conclusion. Easily one of my favorite book series. :)
B001AVCFK6|1.0|I had high hopes for \\"Star Trek\\".  The concept of a young Enterprise and a young crew seemed compelling.  It's not believable to trot out the original actors, who are now seventysomethings.  A new crew of young actors could present another decade of movies.    So, I ordered the Blu Ray disc and watched the movie.  I don't know if I'll EVER RECOVER from this trauma!    Exposing humans (or animals) to this garbage is a crime, an atrocity, an abomination. For all the history, heritage and MONEY sunk into this stinker, \\"Star Trek\\" is THE WORST MOVIE EVER!!!    Here's a simple checklist that even Star Trek lapdogs will have to acknowledge:    1)  Capt. Kirk runs from the giant crab and just HAPPENS to jump into the ONE ice cave occupied by Spock;  2)  Spock escorts Kirk to the ice station where Scotty and his stupidly costumed sidekick reside and wOw!, Scotty just happens to know how to teleport Kirk onto a warping spaceship;  3)  The Romulan villain Capt. Nero speaks in a So Cal surfer boy accent.  His \\"Fire everything\\" quote sounds nasal and irritating;  4)  The Romulan space ship resembles a water soaked porcupine, but not as menacing;  5)  The Romulan space drill weapon resembles a gigantic fishing line.  How hard is it for the scientifically advanced Vulcans to destroy it?  Too hard, apparently.  6)  The Romulan weapons look and sound like muskets;  7)  The \\"Bud Light\\" bar scene reference is crudely commercialistic;  8)  The Corvette scene attempts to channel \\"James Dean\\" but is really designed to appeal to rebellious adolescents who will drag Mom & Dad to the movies, thereby causing THREE ticket sales.  9)  There are more un-special effects than special effects: tons of spandex suited fight scenes but hardly any epic CGI space battles;  10) Not one but two StarFleet captains fall for Nero's ruse to board his vessel;  11) Kirk defeats Spock's unbeatable Komagata Maru scenario by \\"ingeniously\\" hacking into the program...while eating a shiny red apple;  12) Spock's cameo is contrived and weak.  WHY is he in an ice cave without food or water?    I loved the Star Trek series.  Yes, it was campy.  But it had heart, intelligence, empathy, social consciousness and really nice sci-fi concepts.    Star Trek the Next Generation had its moments but I will never forgive or forget the stupid \\"Wesley Crusher\\" character, with his thyroid Adam's apple and pimply face.    \\"Star Trek\\" is an obscenity.  DO NOT buy this garbage.  And to all you Trekkie lapdogs, I defy you to rebut my arguments listed herein.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Great movie and what a great deal on the pricing of this set- a real bargain.
B002JODV3S|4.0|The video & sound quality are great, I'm very picky about those things.  I'm a guitar player, and appreciate the great skill that he has.  I Don't really care for the stlye of music that much, reminds me of the Trans Siberian Orchestra.  Some songs I liked, especially the blusey ones.  But the rest are way too TSO for me, it's probably the violins.  So... if you are a Via fan then this is a must buy.  Otherwise maybe you should rent it first.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Eastwood starts out as an old crusty bigoted, anti-Asian person. But he gradually becomes transformed by his Asian neighbors' kind, affectionate treatment into an understanding, appreciative, caring member of their family. A fascinating relationship develops between him and the neighbor teenagers--a young man and a young woman. Of all the roles I've seen Eastwood in, this by far is the best--his facial expressions say more than any words he says. His directing is simple, impactive, and straightforward--no hi-tech frills and stunts--and it serves the story quite well. The script also works well, and the ending offers a heartrending surprise, definitely against the grain for Eastwood, but thoroughly believable and exemplary. It exalts rather than degrades him, and enables him to obtain the justice required without sacrificing moral principles. Highly reccomended!!!
B0017HEX76|1.0|No indication that the DVD is Korean.  And I couldn't read the fine print--or any print--on the box.  Sneaky.  Come on, Amazon, you have a reputation to maintain!
B000N4SHOE|3.0|The movie depicts a somewhat homely old maid who lived<br />in a childish world of her stories and animals.<br />The love affair with her publisher's younger brother<br />who was assigned her book to get him out of his older brother's hair<br />is a strange mix of 19th morays right out of Jane Austin.<br />Her mother and father, it seems, would rather she be a lonely old maid,<br />than marry below her station and disgrace them.<br />All their scheming backfires when he unexpectedly dies of a fever.<br />So what did she do with the rest of her life?<br />Why is she considered one of the first \\"modern\\" British<br />women? I liked the movie, but I suspect that she<br />was much better balanced than the movie gives her credit for.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This movie is great. My grandson 3 yrs. old loves it. We have watched it at least 100 times. Cute, Cute, Cute.
B00000B9BD|5.0|I've heard them all.    This is their best album!!    You will not be disappointed.
0345495004|3.0|The characters lacked the depth that I was hoping for. It was an easy read.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I really enjoyed this series very very much and am soooo glad tat it has FINALLY come out on DVD.  Altho the features aint many but still being able to re-watch every single episode again is a blessing!  Kudos also to Amazon for being so prompt in delivery and for offering one of the better prices.  I recommend this to anyone of all ages, who still have an active imagination and a sense of adventure, to try this series...only 1 word to describe: AWESOME!!!
0312370849|5.0|Well written novel based on actual time and places.  Let us not forget the horror this book was based on.  You will miss out if you don't read this one.
1603580557|3.0|It took me a while to get into the book. At first it was very basic with simple concepts that were obvious. For example, if you have a stock of water (e.g., a bucket) with a drain in one end and an input (e.g., a hole in the bottom and a faucet above), the level of the stock depends on the rates of the input and output. Like I said, it is pretty obvious and as a consequence a dull read.<br /><br />As I progressed through the book it got more detailed and more interesting. However, at no point did I get the feeling that it was telling me something I didn't already know. Maybe this is due to good writing and presentation of the material, but I felt that it was still a bit of a chore to read the book and at the end I can't really say I know anything now that I didn't know when I started reading it, except one thing.<br /><br />In a little side note was a basic rule of rates that says that a stock will double at a rate of 70 divided by the % rate. So, for example, if you have a balance of $1000 on your credit card and it is charging you 20% interest, left alone, the balance will double to $2000 in 70/20 = 3.5 years. This little tidbit is a nice little piece of knowledge, but not what the book is about and so doesn't really count as something I learned about \\"Thinking In Systems\\".<br /><br />It could be that I already know the concepts presented in the book and that it would be very useful or informative to others. The other reviews for this book indicate that others felt it had something to offer them, so your mileage may vary, as they say. If you already deal with systems in your job or if you think you've always had a knack for this type of thinking, then you might not find this has much to offer. Otherwise, this could provide some insight and could help make sense of complex systems and situations.
0375846735|1.0|People aren't going to like me for not liking this series, but though I normally really love big thick books, this trilogy has more problems than I can list here, the main one being how boring it is, first one is 0k, second one takes forever and a lot of the plot points don't make a great deal of sense when you think about it, why is she explicitly attracted to murderers, for example (that's a little creepy to be honest).<br /><br />First book is 0k action-wise, but highly prejudiced and ever-ready to caricature, the second and third are the same, but overlong, very slow, and very boring with little in the way of good action, to the point that I barely finished them, I'm not sure what the hype is about really, controversy couldn't make Dan Brown a good author, but he's still better than Pullman, who seems to hate rather a lot of people in a way I can only describe as xenophobic.<br /><br />Mild Spoilers:<br /><br />In the second book her original friend, who she travelled half way round the world for, is discarded, with hardly a thought, for her new, and more-or-less identical, companion (I noticed that an awful lot of the characters feel copy-pasted, most of the white bears are paper-thin and all the antagonists seem to run on bile with no real convincing motive or personality).<br /><br />The final battle, as well as all the action, feels distant and rather mellow-dramatic, as did everything in the second book. The trilogy doesn't seem to end as much as peter out, I left this series feeling unsatisfied and slightly puzzled, to be honest I've put it in a box upstairs and will probably forget about it totally. The characters and plot were unmemorable, nobody really seemed motivated to do anything, but did it anyway (Which is roughly how I felt when I finished the book).<br /><br />Overall, this averages out as one of the most boring trilogies I have read.
0307454541|4.0|I read this on vacation.  Perfect beach reading.  Good characters, smart story.  What more can you ask for?
B002K0WBYG|5.0|Sandra is amazing and very fun girl. I like Sandra she`s a great actriss in US. ,maybe the best!!.
B0000009SE|4.0|This is Zappa's wheelchair rock. More aptly, wheelchair jazz.<br /><br />He was unable to tour after being thrown from the stage by a crazed fan in 1971. He broke up the Flo and Eddie Mothers, and put a big band together. Saying he was interested in  exploring the direction Miles set on [[ASIN:B000002696 Bitches Brew]]  he made  [[ASIN:B0000009SF The Grand Wazoo]] and this.<br /><br />Where Wazoo was more big band, Waka takes a fusion approach on two long tracks, the title one and \\"Big Swifty.\\" These are long pieces where the players can strech over the minimal chords, and this does wonders. The spacey atmosphere, particually on \\"Swifty\\" is a great vehicle for Zappa's giutar and, even more so Sal Marquez's flickering candle trumpet.<br /><br />Consistent with putting all music on one plane, this also features \\"Your Mouth,\\" and \\"It Just Might Be A One Shot Deal,\\" two excellent blues tracks, \\"Deal\\" featuring sterling slide guitar.
B00003CX95|5.0|The DVD was in good conditions. Arrived in the time period mentioned. Overall no problems with the DVD and I was satisfied. Hope this helps!
1906694400|4.0|I was very pleased to receive this much sought-after book.  I did not realize, however, that this audio book was an abridged version.  I would have much preferred the full version.  If the abridgement was noted, I missed it.  An abridged audio book is often a very unsatisfying experience.  This version was adequate; I'm not sure if a full version exists, but it would have been my preference.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|We got this for the dad who has everything. He loves it. It's actually a great gift for the whole family. We all watch it together. It's beautiful and well done.
B001C4CI8U|3.0|I love shows about either supernatural or paranormal activities, so why do I give this show only 3 stars? Well I think it has a lot to do with the actual actors. The actress who play's Olivia I find to be way too wooden, especially in the first episodes. I tend not to believe she has any real feelings for anyone let alone her boyfriend who plays a major part in the pilot. Then there's the \\"mad doctor\\" as the creators call him in the special features, I find that there are times when the shtick gets a little old. As for Joshua Jackson, well he's not that bad but his smart-aleck responses also tend to get a bit old.  But what really bothers me is the amount of disbelief the characters portray even after seeing all the s___t they see. They talk to dead people, combat beasts that are part tiger/snake/bird, teleportation, etc. yet whenever the Mad Doctor has a theory about something it's always, \\"That's not possible!\\", \\"That's insane!\\", \\"There's no way that could happen!\\", \\"That's not possible!\\" (They say that one a lot). Well after seeing all you've seen and the doctor says it's probably so and so, why not just accept it and move on?  In the pilot there's a scene where the police, FBI and SWAT are surrounding a suspect's house yet no one except Peter (Joshua Jackson's character) sees' the guy come out the back? Obviously a scene just there to show that Peter can be an important part of the team.  Now I'm not saying it doesn't have it's interesting episodes, especially towards the end and really you can start watching from I believe disc 5 and it's actually more exciting. The first episode of disc 5 actually has an overview of everything that happened before, go figure.  I will say this the last shot of the last episode is a shocker, if you have half a brain you will know the big secret before the last episode but you will not expect the last shot, it was genius.  All in all I would rent the DVD's and not buy them.
B0029LHW68|5.0|The week or two before the release I was hearing nothing but negativity about the album for the most part, which I admit made me feel a little bit less interested. However, as a huge fan of the band, I was still going to give it a fair listen and construct a personal opinion. I'll be the first to admit I wasn't too fond of the first album, but absolutely loved the second. \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" was a complete rock n' roll plethora, with the exception of an acoustic song, one mellow one, and the Bjork cover. In \\"This Is War\\" they go beyond that and reach new progressive territory. There's definitely a LOT of experimental work on this album, so it definitely WON'T be for everyone, at least those who aren't willing to give it more than a few listens and let it grow, so it's definitely a grower. This album has it all, from an almost cryptic 'intro song' (\\"Escape\\"), the catchy more pop rock oriented single \\"Kings and Queens\\", to the more A Beautiful Lie familiar sound in the title track \\"This Is War\\", to the beautiful acoustic mellow song \\"100  Suns\\", to the very Depeche Mode sounding \\"Hurricane\\", and to perhaps the most interesting song oof the album (and personal favorite), the last one, \\"L490\\", which explores an acoustic-experimental hybrid sound with Gregorian chants that is VERY well done and effective.    As I mentioned earlier, \\"This Is War\\" probably won't be for everyone, it's definitely a love it or hate it album, but the latter will mostly be up to the listener (whether they're willing to keep an open mind and let it grow)
0385341008|4.0|This book is a wonderful look into the trials the Channel Islands endured during the war as well as their recovery.  The characters are interesting and humerous.
B002XHN776|5.0|I have been a fan of 30 Seconds to Mars for several years and I love their music. I've gone to a few of their concerts and they're amazing live. I couldn't wait to hear this album and once I did I was blown away. It's just as good as the other two records. I haven't stopped listening to it ever since I got it. Their self titled album and A Beautiful Lie were great and this one is no exception. I personally like every track off of the album but if you had to ask me right now which song I liked the best, it would have to be \\"This is War\\". If you liked even some of their previous music, what are you waiting for, Get This CD!!
B000W00Y0Y|5.0|If you're slightly interested in this, buy it. Stunningly clear video and sound and a great performance by one of the best concert bands ever. I wish more concert videos were shot like this
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan is not a sophisticated or highfalutin, person. She is a simple, humble, everyday lady that has an amazingly beautiful voice. I love all the songs on the album. My favorites are I Dreamed a Dream, Wild Horses, and I really like Who I Was Born to Be. It fits perfectly with Susan's life. I would love to meet Susan in-person sometime. We love you over here in America, Susan!
B002NXSRVG|4.0|I went to see the movie, G.I. Joe, The Rise of Cobra, with no hopes of seeing a heartbreaking, thought provoking, tear jerking movie and I was not disappointed. I went to be entertained and to escape for a few hours from the real world and I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. I enjoyed the CGI, the action and the gadgets in the movie totally. Also, Ms. Miller was a treat to the eyes who stole the show. Go have some fun and check this flick out.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|What can I say more than UP! was for me a perfect movie. Excitement, great animation,super story with a great moral ending.  Shows we can all be influenced for good with love and service to others.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|Great transfers. The black & white original is excellent. I usually avoid anything colorized, but the new Blu-ray version looks a lot better than expected.
0618154248|5.0|This is a wonderful gift for toddlers got my god-daughter these books and a stuffed George!
B002M9WW30|4.0|Ok, I watched this set I borrowed from a friend and the picture isn't as bad as everyone says it is.  Somewhere someone said they felt like they were watching a VHS tape...give me a break!  While they obviously could have done a better job cleaning these up, they are for sure better than the DVD versions.  But it's still a decent transfer...I'm sure there they will eventually be completely remastered.    As for those of you complaining about the price droppings...have you noticed the significant drop overall in blu-ray pricing?  Now the blu-ray is becoming more mainstream, the prices are coming down!  If there are no advantages to pre-ordering, then don't get it!  Everyone has had a situation where they paid for something and later saw it cheaper and lost a few bucks.  Amazon is still cheaper than going out to Best Buy or Wal-mart and getting it.  Factor in that the majority of Amazon users don't have to pay tax and can have the items shipped to you for FREE, then that is even more in savings.  So again, if you don't like it, don't buy it!
B002MW50KO|5.0|If you are a Bob Dylan fan, you will love this CD. He is a genius you know?
B000001FZK|5.0|I bought this on vinyl when it was initially released and it totally changed my interest in music.  It's priceless, nothing like it except Spirt of Eden.  It was kind of like the first time I listened to John Coltrane, Mahavishu Orchestra and Return to Forever.  You knew these guys had a talent that nobody else had.  I bought it yesterday on CD as I wore the vinyl out. I'm over 50 and listen to this all the time.. If you are looking for something different, something that will probably change your taste in music, it's not party music.  It's music you listen to with headphones or when you are alone and want to veg out.
B000006IUQ|5.0|Have watched this movie a lot of times and still a great show, see something new every time from the plane crash to the bear attack to the deadfall. Anthony Hopkins is great to watch but Alec Baldwin needs to be slapped around some. All in all an A1 movie.
B000065KH4|5.0|This is a great movie (chick flick) with a romantic story line, as well as intrigue, resolution of moral issues, great acting, and a little eye candy provided by Johnny Depp.  A bowl of popcorn and a fine wine on a snowy evening and you're all set for a fun movie night at home with the girlfriends.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I am so pleased with this CD!  Susan Boyle's voice is absolutely beautiful throughout the entire CD.  She explains in the jacket of the CD what each song means to her.
B001PR0YDA|5.0|I came with an open mind. This, after all was the story my father had told us children, when we were snuggled up warm in our beds. He would plant a dining room chair in the hallway. And from memory he recited \\"the story of Scrooge.\\"  It was a little frightening, to be lying there in darkness, a bit of light streaming in from the hallway, as your father's voice suddenly turned all funny. He became, in turn, three spirits - voices different from Scrooge's own.<br /><br />Dad did that each Christmas eve. Until we grew \\"too old for that,\\" as he explained one year while putting his shaving soap on the tree, after putting up all the decorations, including the battered angel - the one my Mom got, that first Christmas in 1936 when Dad planted his first kiss on her lips, as they danced (he said) to English band leader Ray Noble's THE TOUCH OF YOUR LIPS.<br /><br />Pardon my reverie . . . I just wanted to establish my credentials, for saying . . .<br /><br />This is not merely the best version of my favorite story (Dad would tell you that; if he were alive this would be his 92nd Christmas).  No, no. This is the most amazing \\"movie experience\\" that I have ever known. I cannot imagine how any film maker(s) could ever top this.<br /><br />They had me hooked from the opening.  The camera shows a beautifully bound copy of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" by Charles Dickens. An invisible hand opens to the first page and those very words my own father composed . . .<br /><br />Marley was dead: to begin with.  There is no doubt whatever about that.  The register of his burial was signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner.  Scrooge signed it: and Scrooge's name was good . . .  for anything he chose to put his hand to.  Old Marley was as dead as a door-nail.<br /><br />We see a corpse, its eyes held shut with pennies. Scrooge himself removes them from the eyes, at the end of the scene saying, without shame to the undertakers, while rubbing the coins together between thumb and finger, \\"Tuppence is tuppence!\\" The subtle change in the undertaker's face -- so subtle you might miss it in the half light of the almost dark room -- is one of dismay at seeing someone THAT cheap. The facial expression borders on horror.<br /><br />Out in the street, children stop playing and dogs duck into alleys at Mr. Scrooge's approach, on his way to his place of business, with its gilt-lettered sign, \\"Scrooge & Marley Co.\\"  That will also be the closing scene of the movie, with Scrooge seen through frosty windows to be dancing with sheer, child-like joy, while outside, Bob Cratchit, for the very first time, turns to the `camera' and addresses us:<br /><br />(Those very words my father composed out of thin air, Christmas 1949!)<br /><br />\\"Scrooge was better than his word.  He did it all, and infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did not die, he was a second father.  He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew [and] ever afterwards, it was always said of him, that he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the knowledge.  May that be truly said of us, and all of us!  And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God Bless Us, Every One!\\"<br /><br />I could share with you a hundred little details (the sort of details that otherwise concern \\"God and the Devil\\"). But \\"Let there be light!\\" sums up the effect on your eyes, as we see clearly despite only the very faintest light sources: and that is what sets this movie apart from any other ever made.<br /><br />You're not conscious of it at first. Then it dawns on you. An entire scene has been done in the light of a distant street lamp.  The lamp (never seen) is about 50 feet to your left.  Your eyes are drawn to the wrought iron fence outside Scrooge's rather magnificent home.  The camera goes in tight, and the texture of the wrought iron - you know the tiny little waves made by a ball peine hammer on the surface of the metal when it was forged . . . the light from that unseen street lamp, 50 feet distant, is just enough for you to see a glint of yellow on the shiny black metal finish.<br /><br />This `cinematography' - working at light levels so low, they could never be captured by a digital `film' camera - is repeated in scene after scene.  It makes the sunshine on Scrooge's face, and on Tiny Tim, held aloft on Scrooge's shoulder at movie's end so . . . welcome!  Light has been used (finally!) to underline Scrooge's utter, endless joy (your own too).<br /><br />I don't know if you, like me, will sit there, tears of joy streaming down your face, watching the closing credits. Only three other people were left in the theatre as the scroll of credits reached its end.

As if to explain my tear-stained face, I said to the woman (an investment counselor as it turns out): \\"I have to see who wrote that stirring `carol' --- a (mainly) men's choir led by a truly great tenor.

B0000VCZKM|5.0|This was a favorite at our house many years ago, so I purchased a copy for my grandchild too.  She loves it!  On days when a 2 year old can become a handful starting this dvd sends her to a whole different world.  The kids, the music, the dog, who could ask for more to keep children of all ages occupied and impressed.  Well worth every dime, a real family favorite for us.
B002RVCD0U|1.0|Simply horrible.  The acting, dialogue, directing.  Even the CGI wasn't that good.  Steaming Pile of....
B002NOYX54|5.0|my kids and I LOVE this CD, found it by accident and are hooked on all of the songs. Very upbeat, catchy feel good tracks. I highly recommend this CD to everyone.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Can't get enough of Pixar! Another heartwarming story that is a pure pleasure to watch w/the kids.
0440236304|5.0|The easiest 5 star review. Some books are high on the romance of WWII and others are notable for their maps and pictures and inspired text. The book is a treasure in how it describes the training and execution of the author's Normandy experience efficiently, accurately, and without pretense. You'll be amazed at the author's ability to be alternatively ruthless and humane, and the randomness and unpredictable nature of the fighting. There will be times reading this book you will be both amazed and horrified. But after you put it down and it all sinks in you will have a deep appreciation for the heroic efforts in Normandy.     Burgett doesn't attempt to resolve the outcome of every little thing he witnessed. He doesn't try and summarize overall war strategy. Instead, the book recounts the events as they transpired with only minimal additional observations. The effect for the reader is getting a real feeling for combat.     This book has also stood the test of time. It was \\"Band of Brothers\\" before Band of Brothers, but without the sentimentality. It is also very accurate historically, which is amazing for a first-person account in such confusing circumstances.    The only criticism I can muster is the title, \\"Curahee!\\" seems somehwat inapporpriate since Burgett did not actually train at Currahee.     I've read a fair number of books in this genre. This book is the best of its kind.

B0017HMF6W|4.0|One of Alfred Hitchock's best films. To see a movie that I have watched a hundred times in theatres, VHS, DVD and now on Blu-Ray. The picture is fantastic, it adds to that \\"Movie Experience\\". It is a pleasure to see it on Blu-Ray and, at that great price, it was hard to pass up.

B002XHN776|5.0|For those of you who love 30 seconds to mars this newest album is a must have. Their sound has matured but they still are true to the band they've been on the first two albums. This album has a number of great songs, Kings and Queens and Hurricane are at least as good as the single This is war. Pick this album up you wont regret it!
B002XHN776|4.0|I didn't read or see any interviews of the band commenting about this release, but it seems that they were aiming to create a wonderful mood of peace throughout the album. The chorus, made up of what sounds like hundreds of people working together to make a wonderful, soothing sound that at one point breaks off to clap and laugh in order to acknowledge each other's successful efforts, made me feel as if I am a part of some perfect, utopian world. Having that said, either the title of the album is meant to be ironic or I didn't get the message that they were aiming for.  Nevertheless, I got used to their new style after one round through the album and enjoyed subsequent listens much more. This is a comparable situation to the Minutes to Midnight and St. Anger albums.

B002BSHXJA|3.0|Hello everyone.  I, like most hardcore Bealtes fans, was so excited to hear about the mono releases from reading reviews like the ones on here exclaiming that the mono mixes were the ones the beatles and george martin favored and that you've \\"never heard sgt. pepper until you've heard it in mono\\" and such things.  I bought the mono box and the stereo albums individually and I have to say that with few exceptions the stereo albums sound way better to my ears.  I'm a second generation beatles fan that grew up with stereo so I may be biased but I think there is a reason mono died.  I agree with the many people on here who say that mono has a certain punch to it that stereo doesn't have but I don't think that's A-always a good thing and B-makes it better than stereo.  The only albums I can say that I really believe the mono mix was better on were Please Please Me, With The Beatles and A Hard Day's Night.  The early Beatles sound really does benefit from mono as the punch that was mentioned earlier really helps these early rockers and helped me appreciate them more than I did in the past.  That's where my love of mono ends. I think Beatles For Sale sounded way better in stereo as did Help!  Rubber Soul, Revolver and Sgt. Pepper were the main reasons that I bought the mono box and I have to say very disappointing.  It's true the beatles worked on the mono mixes and left it to the engineers or george martin to make the stereo mixes but I don't think it's because they didn't care about stereo I think it was becuase with a schedule like the Beatles had in those days it was impossible to sit down and concentrate on two mixes.  Sgt. Pepper was the big deal breaker besides Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds and She's leaving home, both of which I think are superior in Mono the album itself is a stereo record. Same goes for Magical Mystery Tour, White Album and most of the singles from that period.  I gave it three stars becuase the packaging was incredible and I wish they put that much thought into the stereo packaging.   I'm not trying to start a fight on here, only cowards fight on the internet, this is just my opinion.  [...] is my email if you want discuss bealtes issues, i'm all ears.  By the way my name is Jacob not Pam, it uses my mom's name for some reason on my account, can't get rid of that. Haha. Have a good day.
B002RKRTGO|1.0|As mentioned by the previous reviewer, this version is missing quite a bit of key content. Whether it's a formatting issue with the Kindle or the transcriber forgot to include the passages is unclear. But the story is unreadable without the missing text.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|Old Boy is one of the greatest foreign movies ever written and the acting is superb. Its the second of a 3-part triolgy based on vengence (sympathy for lady vengence & sympathy for mr vengence). Personally, I've never seen an American movie that can compare to the way Old Boy has been written, directed and acted. I've reccommended the movie to friends and always get a great reaction.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Fawlty Towers is hilarious. Our family has watched it over and over again for years.<br />I will have to buy this new remastered collection.
B000HT3P7E|5.0|Item was received very well packed and protected from any scratches or bumps.  Great deal, great TV show to watch over and over.
B002ECJZ76|4.0|I was planning a video review, but my camera was bugging out so here I am writing one.  lol<br /><br />  I was looking forward to watching this movie mostly because I tend to enjoy movies from Northern Europe, especially Sweden and Norway, and this tnis probably the first Finnish movie I am aware of that I watched.<br /><br />  The plot revolves around a child named Nicholas who's family dies and is raised by the entire village, moving to a new family each Christmas.  This inspires Nicholas to make little wooden toys for all of the children familes whom he stayed with.  This is the central idea for the story and origins or Santa Claus, it is basically how Santa Claus could have happened if he were Finnish.<br /><br />  Knowing the truth origins of the grand myth of Santa Cluas (Saint Nicholas) this was more of a fun diversion for me than anything and could serve as a possible way to start a conversation nwith your children about the true origins of Santa Claus.<br /><br />  I would highly recommend this film to family of children who are around 6 or older because it does deal with themes of death as well as some mild cruelty to the main character, but overall is a very good family film.<br /><br />  The one and only downside to this movie is not a fault of the movie itself, but rather the fault of the company that released it here.  For family viewing dubbing is the best choice obviously, and this is fine, but if the quality of the dubbing is equivalent to the infamously poorly dubbed Asian movies and a youtube video made with a camera with a terrible delay, subtitles would be a godsend for those who are not little children.  The dubbing was so painful to watch I couldn't look at the screen most of the time when the characters were talking, sure after a bit you get used to it, but it just shouldn't be this way.<br /><br />  Other than the quibble about the atrocious dubbing, this is a very good movie for what it is and is very cute and fun.  I am doubting they will ever re-release it with subtitles, but I wish that they would.<br /><br />  God Bless ~Amyrelease it with subtitles, but I wish that they would.             God Bless ~Amy
B0001XAPY2|1.0|I've always been a Miyazaki fan with Kiki's Delivery Service and such.  However, Porco Rosso is not recommended for young children as there are multiple \\"moron\\", \\"idiot\\" and other choice words throughout the film.  When seen as an adult anime, the plot is sadly lacking and at the end, I really didn't care whether Porco lived or died.  Go see something else instead.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|We missed this at the movies but heard it was a good family movie. It is! However small children would not be as interested in the flic as older children and adults.
B0029LHW68|5.0|\\"This Is War\\" is an incredible mix of REAL human emotion and new sound. This CD explores a more personal side of the band like we've never seen before. It's fresh, new, and inviting. 30 Seconds to Mars is a band who was brave enough to put themselves out there and become pioneers in their genre. Incredible.
0385532458|5.0|Loved the book. We have read all of Grisham's books to date but was needing a book of short storis to read while waiting at various places - such as physician's offices, school to release students, etc.   but ended up reading the entire book at home.  Loved the stories - and being from a small Texas Panhandle town - they were all too real.
0143034901|5.0|The Shadow of the Wind is a beautifully written piece of fiction about anything and everything you can think of. There is love, loss, betrayal, villains, heroes, adventures, friendship, heartbreak and everything in between. What is most attractive about this novel is the fact that the story revolves around a boy, a reader like you and me, who becomes so enamored with a book that it consumes most of his adolescents. And without this book, he may not have had the adventure that brought him to his life. Young Daniel fatefully picks out a book that unknowingly unravels a diabolical past about the author, Julian Carax, and the secrets around him that have been buried for too long. With the help from his best friend Fermin, his love Bea, and a few people from Julian's past, a heartbreaking lie is revealed that awakens Daniel to evaluate his own life. No matter how horrifying and sinister the secret may be, you almost don't want it to be true because you learn to care for each character, whether living or dead. So much tragedy and pain, happiness and love in one novel is sure to leave you lingering on the last sentence like the final note of an overture, because anything with that much passion is bound to leave you wanting more.
B001AQMBJQ|3.0|This is a case study in how not to do a blu-ray release. As with the previous season, the set is massively overpriced given that its so few episodes. There are no physical extras at all. Not even a card listing episode titles. Its the classic fan expolitation release.    There are two audio commentaries that were thrown together in a way that suggests they didn't want to do any audio commentaries at all. We are given a mock-1980s style documentary that might be interesting but for the fact that it has nothing new to say and nearly all of it was available on the web long before  the set was even released. All of the more interesting extras from previous seasons are missing.     And then there is \\"Lost University\\" which amounts to a conviluted online game designed to hide content (a bunch of commentary segments) already on the blu-ray.    One positive thing was that the longer final episode of the season was not mangled or presented as two episodes this time.     There are deleted scenes, bloopers, behind the scenes interviews and so on, but there is no interesting comment to be had.    So why are the extras so bad? Because they took them all and created an even more expensive version (The Complete Fifth Season Dharma Initiative Orientation Kit). And because they care *so much* for the fans, they randomly put a futher exclusive extra in only some of the Dharma kit sets (the sub patch).     The word for season five is *exploitation*.     There is nothing worth rushing out to buy this for. I would suggest either picking it up used (With no physical extras, what does it matter) or wait for the price to drop further.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|Heard about Eddie Vedders solo attempt back in 2007 when it came out. Didn't think much of it at the time, as most solo attempts are not worthy of a listen. But recently I heard \\"society\\" on satellite radio. I was like, wow... that sounds like EV. Sure enough I downloaded the ablum and can't stop listening to it. It definatly has the raw Vedder sound and until today didn't realize that he plays all the instruments on the ablum.... awesome! A true artist. I have the \\"Into The Wild\\" DVD at home and can't wait to watch it after hearing the soundtrack. GREAT ABLUM!
B0001ARCFA|5.0|I've had some cheaper pairs of sennheisers and cheap in ear headphones; but nothing that sounds as great and are as comfortable as these. Crazy thing about them, I'll be listening to songs I've heard hundreds of times, but pick up talking or other sounds I hadn't picked up before in the background, freaking me out thinking someone is trying to get my attention outside my door.<br /><br />Basically,<br /><br />Comfort 4.9/5 - I tried out some bose headphones at cosco that felt like I was wearing nothing, but who knows what a couple hours would have felt like. I've worn these a couple hours at a time and even at the end of those hours, my cumbersome head and large ears felt fine.<br /><br />Sound 5/5 - I'm not a professional in the music industry, but for my needs, listening to music, watching movies, etc... these are above and beyond what I was looking for.
6304698690|5.0|I've watched this movie since I was very young. Once VHS was no longer an item in our house, I had to get it on DVD. I got it really quick from Amazon and I watch it every few weeks when I get an itch for a great story. Buy this for your little girl, she'll be hooked for life :)
B000J103PC|1.0|I continue to be baffled by the positive attention that this movie has gotten. As a college-aged girl with friends who are all obsessed with this movie, I agreed to see it at some point, and then immediately lost respect for half of my friends.    What is this movie about? An unintelligent, inarticulate, doormat who we're supposed to like for some reason who learns absolutely nothing. She goes to work for some fancy magazine even though she seems totally incompetent, she starts being all shallow, then realizes she shouldn't be shallow. But at least she dropped from a size 6 to a size 4 and kept those cute boots!! Seriously, what is that?    In the end, I have no idea if this movie is trying to justify the existence of the fashion industry or else criticize it. Sure, the main character eventually leaves her job... but her awful experiences and her awful choices (for instance, sleeping with some really greasy dude while she's out of town... this is, apparently, not an issue at all) don't have any real negative ramifications. She gets a great reference or something, moves on, but it's considered a positive step that she is, now, considered conventionally attractive. EVEN THOUGH SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE THE WHOLE TIME. Characters consistently make fun of her for being a \\"fat\\" size 6, and then at the end, with a satisfied smirk, says she's dropped to a size four. And this is the enlightened, I-have-figured-out-my-priorites part of the movie. I have no idea why we're supposed to like the main character. I have no idea why people think that a movie which potrays a protagonist who is so vapid and unlikeable, which views anorexia sympathetically (of all things), which really does seem to value looks over anything else, is a good movie. It's not even funny. There are NO jokes. People talk a lot and then don't say anything. This movie has no depth, no substance, and no message. If anything, it is that being really really good looking really IS important. Even if you're (supposedly)smart and stuff, you could still lose some weight, fatty!    This is one of the few movies that has actually been bad enough to make me angry. Aside from the obvious comment that Meryl Streep's performance was pretty fantastic, this movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities. There is no reason to watch it.
B000MGB6M8|5.0|In this day of high divorce rates, golfers who putt when they should be driving, and sluts who steal their friends' husbands, it is good to see a family values bit of entertainment, like this, which shows how a marriage can stay together, even with distractions on all sides.  The leads, who reportedly have been married themselves, are perfect as a middle-age couple who find their needs met by a similar, yet complimentary, partner, not picked for them by their parents. It shows how marrital therapy can help over some of the rougher spots, and how friends are still necessary, even in a strong marriage.  Blue Ray makes it all more vibrant and makes this couple, already fairly attractive, fun to watch with every detail sharp and clear.  Katherine and Spencer, Jodie and Hannibal, I know, I know, there have been other pairings that survive over time, at least on the screen, but here we have something more special, more joyous, more adventuresome than we have ever viewed before.   Not as good as \\"To Catch A Thief,\\" better than \\"King Kong,\\" this is a pastic disc that every serious movie freak will want to own and repeatedly watch over the years. After you see this flick enough times, I recommend you move down to \\"Dr. Zhivago,\\" and watch that with your love, as the world cools down.  Current rumours have it that Mr. and Mrs. Smith will appear in a subplot of \\"Ocean's Fourteen.\\"
B001G0MFOM|5.0|I am a big fan of the show and it was the perfect ending for this groungbreaking show!!!
B001KVZ6G6|4.0|OK so it's a movie right?  Well the dif=gital copy made it really easy to transfer to my mobile device so my girls could watch this on the go.  I will be trying to find movies with a digital copy included from now on!
B002QEXN2K|4.0|This album certainly is not as strong as Continum.  At first the songs did not seem to have much of a hook to keep you listening but it does certainly grow on you.  IMHO, two songs on this album that are worth a listen are \\"Perfectly Lonely\\" and \\"Half of My Heart\\".  Overall its a good album but probably will not get much radio airplay.
B001FB55HQ|5.0|The Terminator Saga has been one of the most recognizable in science-fiction film lore and for good reason. The idea of timeline manipulation and the impending machine rebellion (which we all know is coming, right? :)) have cemented this franchise into the hearts of movie-goers for over two decades. The fourth installment finally allows us to partake in the story that, up until now, we have only glimpsed at, the actual post-apocolyptic battle between man and machines. This movie screams epic from start to finish with some of the most intense action and special effects I have ever seen. The story is awesome and really pays a lot of homage to the previous films (well, not really much to the 3rd movie wich I thought, while the weakest of the four, was still decent and had a great ending). On a semi-personal note, I wish the story had remained a little more focused on Conner and a little less on Marcus. Conner is the main protagonist in the 2nd-4th films and it seemed like Marcus was really the only character they spent extensive time building. You can tell that the writers assumed the viewer already knew John Connor well. The attention seemed split about (55% Connor and 45% Marcus.) This isn't a huge gripe by any means as they still did a great job. Overall this is a fantastic action/sci-fi movie and fine addition to the Terminatore cannon. I hope they continue the sage but we'll have to wait and see.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Great, fun series.  I have not read the books, but I will based on this show.
B0027BOL4G|3.0|I found the film to be interesting and worth watching.  Parts of it were truly eye opening.    On the other hand there seemed to be an underlying political message beyond food.    Some of this message may have been inadvertent bias of the typical pro organic crowd being interviewed such as reference to global warming and opposition to profits.    But some issues were repeated throughout the film and obviously the view of the producers.  This centered around pro-union anti free market labor along with the assumption that anything that increases production or lowers cost is automatically bad.    What I took away from the film is that the food industry is ruled by a few large companies that wield monopolistic market power and have armies of lawyers and lobbyists that are able to sue and intimidate the little guy an buy favorable treatment in the making of laws and regulation of the industry.      The inevitable solution presented was to vote with your wallet and to lobby congress to increase government control over the food industry.    Voting with your wallet makes sense, but beyond that, what is really needed in my opinion is for the government to fulfill its duty to ensure free competitive markets which means free of monopolies.  Just as Standard Oil was busted up into 34 companies in the early 1900's the same needs to be done now for these monster food conglomerates.  Unfortunately from the view of the film producers who are quite obviously of a liberal persuasion, much more faith is put in government regulation than in the competition of free markets.  The film producers also clearly call for more monopolies in the form of labor unions and worker collective bargaining.  Again not trusting the free market to pay what they considered to be a reasonable wage.  They showed ads where an American meat packing company was attempting to recruit Mexican workers to come in to their USA plant (illegally crossing the border) where they were advertising $11 per hour.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|I really like this movie. I'm a big fan of the cartoon.The package came wrapped in plastic and in a box. I recommend this movie for everyone. If you like the comic book, you will enjoy this movie a lot. It's a must see movie.
B0029XZODY|5.0|Great blu-ray and Dexter is a beast.  Highly recommended for all of you crazy cohouns who love to get down in the big city.  Buy this Blu-Ray!  You will not regret the decision.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Background:  37, male, grew up listening to my dad's popping/cracking but soulful vinyl (all mono U.S. versions except the stereo White Album) records.  The Beatles have been the soundtrack to my life starting with my childhood.  And if you're reading this, I'm guessing your soundtrack too.    When I first heard about the new box sets being released, I was of course excited but wondered how many times I'll buy the same songs over again!  Of course that thought was fleeting and I quickly came to my senses.  If you are thinking the same thing and consider yourself a true Beatles fan like I do, I urge you to reconsider.  If you are a new fan, this is the place to start.      The price was the biggest barrier for me, but I did it and I'm very happy.  These are the versions The Beatles worked on in the studio with George Martin.  I had to have them.      Has this happened to you?  You listened to the old records for years and in 1987 when the CDs came out you made the switch?  That's what I did.  I've spent the past 20+ years listening to the CDs, which are okay, but all the while forgetting the original sound.  When I visited my parents for Thanksgiving I took another look at the vinyl records and they were all mono (except for The White Album).  I had forgetten due to the CD brainwashing.  Now I have the original sound back but in CD format.  That's what I'm the most excited about.    *Note:  If you haven't read the James Perlman review, please do so. I consulted with him via the \\"Comments\\" before I made my purchase.  I believe there is no better review out there for this set.      My personal highlights:    I listen to a lot of music via headphones so to me the mono is *way* better than the hard right/left splits of the stereo versions.      \\"Help\\" (completely different lead vocal track versus the stereo version).    The \\"Help\\" and \\"Rubber Soul\\" albums come with both the mono and stereo versions which is very cool for comparison sake.  (I like \\"The Night Before\\" way better in stereo, but the rest of the album in mono).    \\"Yesterday\\" is so much cleaner in mono.  It's almost as if Paul's standing in the room.    \\"She's a Woman\\" and \\"I Feel Fine\\" - not as much echo/reverb.  Everything is much tighter in mono.    \\"If I Fell\\" is much tighter in mono - the dual tracking vocal starts off cleaner and Paul doesn't butcher the second \\"vain\\" like he does in the stereo version.    The entire Sgt Pepper album - it's just flat out amazing.  (\\"She's Leaving Home\\" is 10sec faster in mono than in stereo - just the way Paul wanted it).      I could go on about many, many other differences large and subtle, but James covers them way more in depth.  Or better yet, you can discover them for yourself.  It's a lot of fun and I hope you enjoy the set as much as I am enjoying it.    All the best,    Tony
B001EAWMGA|5.0|Being a huge fan of The 13th Warrior and also Jim Caviezel I thought, OK, a Sci-fi Viking movie? Why not? I wasn't sure what to expect. I watched the movie once, then watched all the special features, and watched the movie again. I was mesmerized by Jim Caviezel, I couldn't take my eyes off him. He is very somber and believable as the spaceman turned Viking. I didn't care for some of the graphic violence and blood spurting but people who like that will not be disappointed. The CGI is pretty good. The monster looks real -most of the time. I love, love, love the ending. I also thought Sophia Myles (Moonlight/Underworld) was fantastic. She plays such a strong but vulnerable woman and you just love her. The movie has all the usual suspects, the love interest, orphaned child, wise king, warrior camaraderie, a special sword, etc but that is what makes it good. I don't mind some predictability. I had rented the movie initially and I am now buying it so I can watch it many times. And I must say Jack Huston is going to have an amazing career. You'll see him next in the 3rd Twilight movie, Eclipse, as Rosalie's doomed finance.

0618918248|5.0|Dawkins is extremely convincing in the evidence he presents and the arguments he makes.  My only concern is this:    People do not like to learn via a seemingly biased source.  Dawkins certainly has an agenda here, and is a bit pushy with how he presents this book.  There are few flaws at all in Dawkins' arguments, however the lay person who cannot understand such sound arguments must have information presented to them in a different manor in order to change their ignorant beliefs.
B00000F566|3.0|Cliches, huge plot holes, wooden acting, why do I enjoy this film so much?<br /><br />This relationship would never work long-term. Just the phrase, \\"There are no books in Johnny's room,\\" reminds us that she has an inquisitive brain, he hasn't. There is nothing that would put me less in the mood for exploring the forbidden hunk's bod than having just witnessed an illegal abortion. And so on. So what works?<br /><br />It's the music. It's the dancing. And the spark of genius in Jennifer Grey, making dancing a metaphor for any struggle.<br /><br />The whole movie is worth it to watch the awkward and clumsy \\"Baby\\" rehearse and rehearse until she gets it right. Inspires me every time I need it. I even have a still from her \\"Wipeout\\" scene as my screen background.

B00007J5VN|3.0|A film more for those who experienced the 1960's.  A fairly light hearted musical flick with Sammy Davis Jnr being the show stealer in the \\"Big Daddy\\" number - one I remembered very well from a young child.  The dance numbers are well staged and the costumes colourful (except for Miss \\"Plain Jane\\" Sweet Charity herself) - the totally impossible beehive hairdo's. So much of the music I knew - and that you'll probably will too - you never realized it was from this movie/show.
B002XHN776|5.0|First song I heard was Kings and Queens, and I instantly liked it, played it over and over. Then I purchased the CD at a music festival in Florida last weekend, and let me tell you, this CD ROCKS ! I had heard that 30 SECONDS TO MARS was using vintage synths. on this CD, and it makes for outstanding listening pleasure - you can hear the difference from so many other bands out there, a good kind of different. You can't go wrong buying this CD. It will definitely be the soundtrack for my Winter of '09 & '10 and I know years from now I will still be listening. This band is awesome - get it!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I don't think I'll ever order from anywhere but amazon again. I always get my shipments in a timely manner, everything is always in great condition. I also got this for about $20 cheaper than at best buy! Its a gift for my father in law, who is a die hard trekkie (sp) & I believe he will really like this movie.
B001NXBRJG|4.0|For those of you like myself who can care less about Reloaded and Revolutions, this is the movie for you. I always thought The Matrix was a great stand alone movie by itself. The other two lacked in originality and story, and I bypass the two all the time.  The Matrix was so unique, revolutionizing film forever, doing things never been done or tried before. The movie looks excellent in HD, made for the HD format. One of my favorites!    And anyone interested in the \\"other\\" Matrix movie, pick up the new director's cut of Dark City on BluRay, which came out a year before The Matrix, which storyline is almost identical, and they even share some of the same sets for both movies.  Rumor is both Dark City, directed by Alex Proyas (who directed The Crow) and The Matrix had Brandon Lee set to star as Murdock/Neo but obviously that was not possible due to his sudden death.  The Murdock and Neo characters are identical that they are anomalies, The Strangers and Agents similar, and Smith is identical to Mr. Hand, Kiefer Sutherland's character similar to Morpheus, so on and so forth. Some would even go as far as saying that the Wachowski brothers ripped-off the idea from Dark City for the original Matrix, and that Reloaded and Revolutions were truly their work and thats why it wasn't as good. Who knows.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|It's clear enough that Michael Jackson fans have enjoyed and will continue to enjoy this concert DVD so long as they remain attached to his memory.  What about the rest of us. Those with few or no memories of having seen him work in film, on TV or live. Is there anything  here that warrants attention. For most who are open to pop of another sort than that to which they were/are accustomed  I think this will be a fine couple of hours. The show is ultra spectacular in its technology; but, more important, is the high degree of integration between the material aspects of the show, the featured cast, and, above all, the focus of all their efforts, Michael Jackson. He is seemingly charged up by what is going on with him at its center while, at the same time, he energizes that which is focused upon him.  Most energized by him is the audience which becomes a central component of the performance, second only to Jackson himself. As the first Beatle film showed, scenes of audience adulation and physical hysteria, influence the ultimate viewing audience.   Enough said. If you haven't seen this phenomenon perform, do so while he is still part of the world's cultural heritage.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This game was taught to both my husband and I when we went and stayed with his relatives. While them explaining it to us, we both had the same thought and how it sounded boring; we're used to card games or fast paced group games. However, after learning how to play, we both enjoyed it so much, he bought us our own set and we have since bought this set for others as a gift. It's also great in the fact that the board is a needs to be assembled each time (very little time, this takes) so that the game board changes every time. It reminded me a lot of when I was learning history as a child and how this game teaches trading/bartering/selling and the value of property/goods. Overall this is a different game that's a lot of fun.

0385737947|5.0|I took a chance on this book, as it is part of a trilogy. Sometimes books in a series are simply stepping stones to or from the adjacent books. That was not the case with this book.    This was very much a self-contained story. I don't even know which book in the series this is, except I can guess it is not the last one. At the end, you can wonder what happens next, although you don't feel cheated of an ending. There is an end to this book which is satisfying. You are just tickled a little to wonder what happens after this.    The age group this book aims for, according to the cover page, is 12 and up. I would say, perhaps, if the 12 year old is very mature. The central character is about 16, and due to the thematic material of the book, my guess is that about 16 is more appropriate.    There is absolutely no sex or sexual situations in this book. I was a tad worried about that, since we have one girl among a few dozen boys, but the situation was handled well when the leader said, \\"No one better touch this girl, or they will answer to me!\\" That was the end of that.    There was some slightly risque language (in the Gladers own language variation), but even that was very tame. It could not realistically be expected that a few dozen teenage boys could be in the situation they are thrown into and NOT swear now and then.    What makes this book, I think, for a slightly more mature reader, is the situation the boys are in. They are sent to this Glade place, surrounded by a maze which changes every night. Almost their entire memories have been wiped. They do not know why they are there (if maybe they were criminals in the past, for instance). At night gross monsters called grievers come out in the maze, and if caught, the boys can be stung and horribly injured or even killed.    There is also an execution toward the front of the book. This is rather mature stuff.    Finally, the book is very exciting. The story rolls along at almost break-neck speed most of the time. It is never dull or even slightly slow. By the time I got to the second half of the book, I could hardly put it down before I finished it.    I would highly recommend this book for the mature young reader over 12.

B000000YNZ|5.0|I read that Bill Evans once told Tony Bennett to forget everything else and to concentrate only on TRUTH & BEAUTY. And if Mr. Bennett was wondering what exactly Bill Evans meant by that, he need look no further than this album MOON BEAMS. Bill Evans, Chuck Isreal, and Paul Motian have created an album of exquisite Jazz. Every cut, top to bottom. There is something about the chords and the way he voices them that I've never heard from anyone but Bill Evans. The music he opened himself up to has in it energies and strains that reverberate with/from/out of - Classicism, not solely Jazz. He penetrates to the richest of musical tapestries, descends into it and explores as only he can that mystical, mysterious, and sacred place that only music can carry us into. Bill Evans and Tony Bennett once made an album together: The Tony Bennett/Bill Evans Album. One of the songs on it is, SOME OTHER TIME. Tony Bennett singing, Bill Evans playing behind him. Listening to it was like hearing two different songs. When Mr. Evans soloed in the tune, the tune left the ground, winging Heavenward. When the solo ended, the song came back down to earth again, where it was before the solo. Mr. Bennett sang the Hell out of the tune. Mr. Evans did something totally and completely other than that - he took it above the clouds .... into a land of exalted TRUTH and BEAUTY that only he knew the path to. This is a gorgeous and timeless album. Highly recommended.

B001IAOEXU|5.0|I bought these due to good reviews. I have to say that these are a must-have item for playing FPS (like COD) games on PS3. The PS3 controllers should have been designed this way already. I have had no problems with the triggers popping off unless the controller is dropped hard (or thrown). They seem to be made out of quality plastic that won't break easily.
B000002UA0|2.0|What else can I add to the title? Don't buy this expecting a taste of Floyd's later visionary works. Piper strangely reminds me of The Kinks' \\"Village Green Preservation Society,\\" another album that probably sounded fine in its time, but now leaves kitsch dripping from your speakers. Some of the songs wouldn't sound out of place on a late 60's parody record. (See: \\"The Gnome.)<br /><br />For clarity's sake, I think we should stop referring to Pink Floyd as a single band, and instead refer to them as Synk Flarrett, & Royd Pinkers. (Post-waters Floyd doesn't need a name, because we don't ever need to talk about it.)
B002NWRMVS|5.0|Her husband died of an overdose, does anyone remember that ? He was in England, I believe and she was here working.  Might that have a good tinge on this album ?  Such a beautiful young  woman with a wonderful voice and talent, finding her strength and moving on from her fall .....
B002MW50KO|5.0|Bob Dylan has created an album that belongs in everyone's holiday music collection.  Christmas in the Heart is a traditional, throwback album that fits comfortably right along side classics in the genre from Elvis Presley, Dean Martin, Willie Nelson and Bing Crosby.  I enjoy the mix of secular songs (\\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\", \\"Winter Wonderland\\") with religious Christmas hymns (\\"Little Drummer Boy\\", \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem\\").

B000000OPQ|5.0|While the movie VISION QUEST (with Matthew Modine as the lead actor) is somewhat dated (it was released in 1985), this song from the soundtrack of that movie is still used today, as it has been since the soundtrack was released, as a song that high school & college wrestlers listen to during practice & before matches.<br /><br />As other reviewers have mentioned, it's a great soundtrack for listening to while running, biking, prepping for a swim meet, driving in the car, or just sitting around at home.  It will get your blood pumping, so it might be perfect for getting rid of a bad headache after a late night out or some other big bash -- just play it on low volume when you first wake up!  :-)<br /><br />VISION QUEST still stands as one of the best Hollywood films that young wrestlers will enjoy, and the soundtrack has some other outstanding selections that can be used to put an aspiring wrestler into a winning frame of mind. If you haven't seen the movie, get it on DVD. If you've never heard the song LUNATIC FRINGE by Red Rider, download it onto your MP3 player or computer or just buy the entire soundtrack, but do it TODAY!
B00005Q4CS|4.0|I only saw this movie once, on cable a few years ago, so my memory of it is not crystal clear.  Except for one scene, which I have never forgotten.  It was the one, near the end, where Ellen Burstyn's character receives shock treatments.  Her amazing performance, along with the brutal, unwavering camera angle and direction, combined to produce the most electrifying, riveting sequence I can recall ever seeing in a movie, the effect seeming to put the viewer inside the character in that instant.  It was as if at that point the movie reached out and grabbed the viewer, dragging them down onto that table, as if the frantic, primal screams of the observed were pulled from the observer.  I marveled at the fecund cynicism by which this was concocted.  I found myself laughing heartily, my guffaws born of admiration for the sheer outrageousness of it.  It's the truth, I will not lie; but to those who may find this a callous or inappropriate response to the scene, I should remind them that this is acting, on a make-believe set, which is how I saw it, and my appreciation was for the filmmaking technique itself, and the manner in which it was executed.  All is illusion on the screen.  It's not real.  She wasn't really having megavolts of electricity run barbarically through her brain by an apparatus more at home in the Dark Ages (though still in use).  But the acting!  Stupendous!  Magnificent!  For me this was the climax of the movie, the catharsis, the axis upon which the entire production turned, and well worth the price of admission.  Bravo, Ellen Burstyn, et al!       As previously indicated, Requiem for a Dream made an impression---so much so that I went to some length to find out the name of it, having forgotten.  I'm going to avoid all the phony moralizing about drugs that seems to attend some reviews of this movie, on this and other sites.  In life, stuff happens.  You can blame it on whatever fetish you choose.  I'll just say that I intend to see Requiem for a Dream again.    In my humble opinion, any movie worth seeing twice is a good movie.    © 2009 RAPWreckerds

B002NXSRX4|4.0|GI Joe isn't one of those Oscar contender films.  I call that a good thing.  It is simply a fun dumb action movie and I like it.  Very few movies pack in this much action.  Most of the back story is filled in with flashbacks which were well done (and contained plenty of action themselves.)  Now if there was an Oscar for least boring movie, this would be a contender.  This one is going on my top action shelf with such good action movies as Transporter 2, Shoot 'em up, Death Race.  Just below the greats: Star Trek(the best movie ever made,) Serenty, and The Fifth Element(previously the best movie ever made.)  Warren.

B0029O08WA|4.0|I actually like the score of this movie a lot better than its soundtrack, but there are some decent songs on here, too, and it works really well when mixed on a soundlist with the score. The Thom Yorke song almost makes the whole album worth it right there, but I also liked the choices for Muse, the Editors, the Killers and Lykke Li. Better than most I've heard - really good when mixed on a soundlist with the score, which I think is phenomenal.

Suddenly, as if someone was shooting them inside my brain, all the massacres I had seen since the day I was touched by war began flashing in my head. Every time I stopped shooting to change magazines and saw my two young lifeless friends, I angrily pointed my gun into the swamp and killed more people.\\" That's how Ishmael Beah describes his first engagement as a child solder in this book.<br /><br />The book tells the story of a 12-year-old boy separated from his family when the Revolutionary United Front (RUF) rebels invaded his home town in Sierra Leone without warning. Most people were murdered, some were raped or brutalised and pressed into the service of the RUF. A few managed to escape, and the author was one of them. For several months he wandered from town to town with other displaced boys, frequently surviving close scrapes with the rebels or other people who distrusted anyone, until he was recruited into the \\"army\\", before eventually being rescued and rehabilitated.<br /><br />It is not a pleasant story, but it is very engaging and well-written. It shows how a sensitive intelligent child can be drafted against his will into committing brutal acts of violence. It helps to explain what wars are like, particularly in Africa, and how violence begets violence. It helps us to understand people who have been victims of war, and most of all it encourages us to do everything possible to prevent war.
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|Story line taked from an old classic by Jules Vern in which this plot is derived. 3D special effects are good, even better on a large screen projector or LCD TV with 3D glasses, extra good with popcorn and a drink. Character acting is to say less than average but otherwise the 3D effects help to carring story line. Vern's classic novel is much better, sorry Vern.

B002RSDW8A|4.0|The review is for the Blu-ray release.  Just an FYI that the Blu-ray release has more exclusive features over its DVD counterpart.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Julie & Julia\\" is featured in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1) and features beautiful cinematography from Stephen Goldblatt (\\"Charlie Wilson's War\\", \\"Rent\\", \\"Conspiracy\\", \\"Angels in America\\").  For Julia Child's story, we see the shots in Paris, late 40's and early 1950's.  Set design and costume design were well done but it was important for Goldblatt to capture that feel of Paris but most importantly the decor of that time.  It's important to note that in the special features, it is mentioned several times that the look of Julia's life in the past, is how Julie Powell imagined Julia's life, so it's a characterization of Julia and Paul Child.<br /><br />For Julie's story, this is a couple who lives atop a pizzeria and for the most part, are not making a whole lot of money.  The timing of Julie's storyline is months after 9/11 and but where Julia Child's features the somewhat upper middle-class living, Julie's life in a 900 sq. ft. room, small kitchen and just the surroundings of Julie and Eric's life is captured well.<br /><br />Detail of both lifestyles are well-captured in film, shots of the food are colorful, blacks are nice and deep, skin tones are natural but it's the various shots that stay in your mind.  From Julie and friends sitting above the rooftops overlooking the NYC skyline and Julia and friends eating at a cafe or restaurant.  But both different timelines are well-captured and presented amazing well in the film.<br /><br />As for audio, \\"Julie & Julia\\" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA (And French and English - audio description track 5.1 Dolby Digital).  The film is primarily dialogue driven and is front and center channel driven where you will hear music being played  Audio description is pretty much just that, a female voice describes what is happening during each scene while the normal audio of the film is playing.<br /><br />Subtitles are in English SDH, Spanish, Cantonese, Mandarin and Portuguese.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Julie & Julia\\" comes with the following special features in Standard and High Definition and in English Stereo.  Included are:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary by Director Nora Ephron - Featuring a detailed, informative commentary by Nora Ephron.  Ephron explains the differences between Powell's real life and what was featured on screen to Julia Child's home in Paris and how the set is an almost an absolute exact replication.  To how Ephron had problems working with the cat in the film and more.  But also interesting is the commentary in regards to Julia Child's impression of Julie Powell's blog.<br />  * Secret Ingredients: Creating Julie & Julia - (27:43) A featurette about how the film and adaptation came about.  Interviews with Nora Ephron, Julie Powell and more.  Norah talks about her passion of food and her appreciation of Julia Child and what she wanted to accomplish with the film which includes making sure the food eaten by the talent were wonderful.  Interviews with the talent of the film of working with each other (Streep and Tucci, Adams and Messina) and more.<br />  * Family & Friends Remember Julia Child - (47:39A very entertaining featurette from family and friends talking about Julia Child's the person on television and offscreen and how wonderful a person she is.  From her and Paul Child's love for each other and friends and family confirming how passionate she was about life.  We also learn about the final day of her life and most of all, what she has meant to the people's lives that she has touched.<br />  * Julia's Kitchen: Take a tour of Julia Child's kitchen -(22:31) Exclusive to Blu-ray, this featurette is about Julia Child's kitchen at the Smithsonian.  Featuring interviews with Paula Johnson (Curator, Smithsonian Institution), Rayna Green (Project Director and Curator, SmithsonianInstitution) and Nanci Edwards (Project Manager, Smithsonian Institution).

You will need a Blu-ray profile 2.0 player (that can connect to the Internet) for this feature.<br />  * Previews - Trailers for upcoming Sony Pictures Home Entertainment releases.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Adorable, entertaining and delightful!  \\"Julia & Julie\\" once again shows us once again why Meryl Streep and Amy Adams are wonderful actresses.<br /><br />Although not working together like they were in the film \\"Doubt\\", both actresses were both wonderful in their roles.  Meryl Streep as Julia Child is very convincing but what I found quite wonderful is seeing a side of Julia Child that I was not even familiar with.  One thing in my household is that my wife enjoys watching her old programs on PBS, so we watched this film together and she was quite impressed.  For me, I was more impressed about the relationship between her and husband Paul and seeing how she became passionate about food and even treated badly when she entered Le Corden Bleu. Stanley Tucci brings that side of Paul Child that many people are not familiar with and it was great to learn from friends and family of how well he played the part.<br /><br />I was surprised because I thought after seeing her in PBS for all these years, I thought she was a chef previous to hosting her own cooking show.  So, it was great to know this personal side of Julia Child and if anything, watching this part of the film encourages me to purchase the book \\"My Life in France\\".<br /><br />As for Julie Powell storyline, Amy Adams does a wonderful job playing this wife who works at a job and is just not feeling her life is all that exciting (when compared to her other friends) and thus setting a goal for herself by cooking all the recipes from \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" and blogging about it.<br /><br />I suppose for today's social media crowd, a film about blogging and use of Paypal is something that today's viewers can definitely connect with.  As with Nora Ephron's \\"You've Got Mail\\" using the Internet technology of e-mail for her romantic film, it was great to see Ephron doing a film about blogging.<br /><br />What I found was quite amusing is seeing how many people have responded to Powell's blog.  After watching the movie, I definitely had to check this blog out and after reading the comments written (around the time she made her first post), I realized that Powell touched and inspired hundreds of people to do something similar.  I've known so many people who have blogged about cooking and even I have blogged about the food and recipes that I've cooked over the years.  So, the fact that Powell was able to write a book about her blog and an adaptation made for film is wonderful (note: The last time I have seen this happen was for the Korean film \\"My Sassy Girl\\").<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment really went all out in making sure the release contains plenty of special features.  In fact, the commentary and \\"Secret Ingredients\\" feature is on the DVD release but everything else is exclusive only for the Blu-ray release.  Definitely a good way to drive people to upgrade to Blu-ray.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Julie & Julia\\" is an entertaining and heartwarming film featuring strong performances from its talent, also well done cinematography.  \\"Julie & Julia\\" may be a film about two different stories but it was great learning about Julia and Paul Child's personal life in France and what led to Julia Child being the International star.  And of course, watching how a blogger would inspire man people through her action of cooking every recipe from Julia Child's book.<br /><br />A wonderful Blu-ray release and may you be Julia Child or Julie Powell fans, bloggers, people who love to cook or you are wanting an entertaining movie, \\"Julie & Julia\\" is definitely recommended!cooking show.

B002H3F7F6|5.0|Thank you so much for keeping me informed about the product that I purchased from you. I recieved it very quickly and in good condition. It was a present for my brother for his birthday and he is really enjoying it!<br />Thank you!
B001AQMBJQ|5.0|Typically, I would get into depth of the series but I'll keep things simple.  The fifth season of \\"LOST\\" aired on January 2009 with a total of 17 episodes featured on five Blu-ray discs.  One thing I will stress is that with this season release, there is less special features than the fourth (on the disc) but the benefit are for those who own a BD-Live Profile 2.0 Blu-ray player (can connect to the Internet) with the feature \\"LOST University\\".  With that being said, if you own a Profile 1.1 or profile 1.0 Blu-ray player, the offering is quite slim compared to previous releases.  So, ratings are going to differ with this release.<br /><br />Similar to the previous \\"LOST\\" Blu-ray releases, the Blu-ray's allow for \\"SeasonPlay\\" which allows people to watch as they go and can stop, restart where they last left off.  \\"SeasonPlay\\" is optional and people can select it before watching an episode.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"LOST\\"  is a series that looks incredible on High Definition.  Featured in 1080p High Definition (aspect ratio of 1:78:1), the detail of the island is captured quite vibrantly.  The green lush plants that surround the island, the blue skies, the blue ocean.  Personally, most of the video footage shot in Hawaii tend to be vibrant in colors and \\"LOST\\" is no exception.  This year's offering is much more detailed.  You can see the skin pores much more closely, even the stubble on the faces of the guys, the arm hairs, detail of crushed metal in the car accidents, Dharma buildings and just regular objects and much, much more.  There is a lot of detail that you just don't see on television and when you see it on Blu-ray, especially for \\"LOST - The complete Fifth Season\\", you can't help but be amazed.  The colors are just fantastic as blue oceans and blue skies are surrounded by beautiful lush greenery.  Blacks are nice and dark and skin tones are natural.<br /><br />One of the things that caught my attention was just things that you never even looked at while watching on television such as jars, the appearance of rusty jars are really apparent in High Definition.  The stained blood on the skin of the characters, you can actually see that the blood is actually dry.  When comparing Seasons one through four on Blu-ray, there is an obvious difference in the picture quality and where season four looked fantastic, season five just really looks incredible.<br /><br />As for the audio, \\"LOST\\" is featured in DTS HD-Master Audio 5.1.  The dialogue is quite clear but one thing that caught my attention is how magnificent the audio is in terms of capturing the ambiance of the island when each person is moving through the jungle.  This season tends to have used more panning and audio directional to certain speaker channels much more evident than the first season.  Also, sounds of the island, car crashing, metal crunching and even thunderstorms come quite clear through the various surround channels. Also, good use of surrounds and LFE.  Dialogue is clear and understandable and the music also comes out alive during certain scenes.<br /><br />In fact, the final episode \\"The Incident\\", that is an episode that really takes advantage of each channel.  Hearing audio and crunching metal from the surround channels, hearing the rumble of LFE through the subwoofer and the front and center channels working in overdrive, capturing the frenzy that took place.  Great use of sound!<br /><br />I love how the music for the series sounds and how it really brought an overall mood to certain scenes. The music by Michael Giacchino and the way the orchestra creates that tension for the scenes was awesome.  So, music plays a big part in the series and the music soundtrack is just wonderful!<br /><br />Subtitles are featured in English SDH, French and Spanish.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />The Blu-ray edition of \\"LOST - THE COMPLETE FIFTH SEASON\\" is featured in 1080p High Definition and 480i Standard Definition.

So, along came season five and the season was very good but it was definitely a season that can easily confuse people with the different time period jumps.  But for the most part, season five was quite interesting as we saw different characters receiving more screen time, we got to see how evil Benjamin Linus truly is (and how wonderful an actor Michael Emerson is to play such a role) and seeing some of my favorite character(s) getting killed off was a bit of a hard pill to swallow after the final episode was over.<br /><br />Just the final minute alone of the season finale, I felt saddened... yes, as a dedicated follower of \\"LOST\\" (yes, I even followed the audio book and a lurker on \\"THE FUSELAGE\\" online forum), I felt that the season was a bit more restrained but the finale, almost like season three, more than made up for it.

But for me, I felt the storyline worked and again, you can sense the writers are going to have fun with this upcoming final season.  I definitely look forward to it.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray release of \\"LOST - THE COMPLETE FIFTH SEASON\\", this has to be the best looking television series on Blu-ray yet.  I was just amazed of how much detail can be seen, things that never caught my attention when watching it on television.  From the skin pores and even the hair on one's arm, to the lush plants and the coarse rocks, the amount of detail that pops is simply amazing.  Audio quality is also used very well through all channels.  From hearing the thunder and rain, the druglord's airplane crashing onto the island to the number of vehicles crashing, gun shots galore and just the ambient sounds are capture quite well and all were great use of lossless audio.<br /><br />As for special features, for those who are looking for a lot of commentaries like previous releases, \\"LOST - The complete Fifth Season\\" has very few this time around and some who enjoy commentary tracks will be slightly bummed.  But that doesn't mean this season is lacking any special features.  If anything, disc 5 of this set contains plenty of special features that are quite long, quite a few easter eggs hidden and it was great to watch the celebration of the 100th episode of \\"LOST\\".  But of course, the biggest addition to this Blu-ray is the utilization of BD-Live for the exclusive \\"LOST Universe\\".<br /><br />It's a great technology for viewers/fans to connect with each other and take part in showing their love for the series.

B001PJRAUS|3.0|Much as I enjoy Austen's books, I've never wished to live in those worlds. And call me crazy, but I've never thought of any of them as love stories. They are more like family dramas where people are trying to get on with the business of life. Love is more of an accident than a goal.    That being said, I found this movie very interesting. I really liked the actress who played Elizabeth, as she had an incandescence that Darcy would have found intriguing had he had the chance to know her. Much as I found myself rooting for the modern girl, she couldn't hold a candle to Elizabeth. But I did love how well Elizabeth adjusted to the present, from her haircut to her earrings to her using the computer.     Two things that bugged me? Amanda's hair! She never puts it up! She's in the Regency clothes but it never dawns on anyone to give her a bobby pin? So aggravating. Second, Mr. Collins was downright repulsive. He's a buffoon, not a pervert.     Otherwise it was a fascinating take on Austen's tale. Some parts were a little too melodramatic (Mr. Bennet dueling made me roll my eyes) and Amanda was far too modern in clothes and attitude to strike me as a rabid Austen fan. I think it would've been interesting if she'd been forced to read the book for a college course then found herself in the story.
B0000029LG|5.0|I grew up with Michael Jackson...we're the same age...and in my youth he was no more than a pop singer in a family of brothers, whom I naively dubbed \\"the Black version of the Osmond Brothers.\\"  I was a little girl, and that was my youthful,  innocent, and very ignorant observation.  I now know that Jackson's talent is so much more than what could be compared to any other human being this side of the universe when it comes to pop culture.<br /><br />That being said, I only came to realize this, sadly, because he is gone and I started listening like crazy to his CD's trying to see what all the fuss was about in the aftermath of his death.<br /><br />HIStory is my third purchased CD so far, and the first disc is a compilation of hits from his first years--the tunes that put him on the map of modern pop music forever and ever.<br /><br />Disc II, however, is what enthralls me.  Granted, I made a habit of skipping over the tunes I found less-than-interesting, like \\"Childhood\\" and the \\"Earth Song, and \\"Smile.\\"  I have a bit of an aversion to MJ's sickly sappy songs, something he is real good at in most of his CD's.  Despite my efforts to ignore those songs,  I got to like them as well.  In this CD, Michael Jackson is no longer \\"Bad,\\" but takes some time (lots of time) to tell us he's MAD and also quite sad.  I think it was a great move at the time to go a different route and use Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis as producers, giving his collaboration with Quincy Jones a bit of a rest.  His music here is raw, throbbing, super bumping and terrific on the up tunes.  His singing goes from raucous and angry to super-sticky sweet, almost maudlin.<br /><br />All in all, you may not love Michael Jackson in this CD, because this aint \\"Bille Jean\\" anymore.  But you will definitely find him pretty darn real.
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. If you love fantasy/love then this is a great movie for you.
B002T921DE|5.0|As someone who saw George on his U.S. 25LIVE tour in 2008, I can say that this blu ray does a great job of reproducing the live experience. The video and audio are fantastic!<br /><br />VIDEO: All the vibrant colors of the light show are brilliantly reproduced. The wide variety of camera angles have been well edited together, giving you a sense of the show from every seat in the house while keeping it visually interesting. For you videophiles out there, very occasionally, there is a little macroblocking as the camera pans across the LED wall, but this is not distracting or prevalent.<br /><br />AUDIO: I was concerned by some negative comments about the sound on this recording, but I was pleasantly surprised by the audio. I had to switch from the stereo track to the DTS-HD track, but after that, the audio was great. It might be a little bass-heavy, but that is how the performance was originally engineered, and it never interferes with the vocals or the other instrumentals. I suspect other reviewers' concerns are caused by the live performance nature of the show. At any rate, I can say that it sounds like the original show, and I found it to be thoroughly enjoyable.<br /><br />SONG SELECTION: Just about every song you'd want to hear at a George Michael retrospective is here. I personally would have traded a few of the songs from his \\"Patience\\" album for older hits (I Want Your Sex), but I don't begrudge his wanting to perform recent work in front of an audience. It is also fun to see the inflatable parody of George W. Bush that was understandably omitted from the U.S. tour. The following is the disc's set list:<br />WAITING (REPRISE)<br />FASTLOVE<br />I'M YOUR MAN<br />FLAWLESS (GO TO THE CITY)<br />FATHER FIGURE<br />YOU HAVE BEEN LOVED<br />AN EASIER AFFAIR<br />EVERYTHING SHE WANTS<br />ONE MORE TRY<br />A DIFFERENT CORNER<br />TOO FUNKY<br />SHOOT THE DOG<br />JOHN AND ELVIS ARE DEAD<br />FAITH<br />SPINNING THE WHEEL<br />FEELING GOOD<br />ROXANNE<br />MY MOTHER HAD A BROTHER<br />AMAZING<br />FANTASY<br />OUTSIDE<br />CARELESS WHISPER<br />FREEDOM '90<br /><br />Bonus Tracks<br />PRECIOUS BOX<br />JESUS TO A CHILD<br />FIRST TIME EVER<br /><br />BONUS FEATURES: The 42 minute documentary is a bit fluffy and silly, but it gives a nice taste of the European tour. It's nice to have the crew behind his performances introduced, even if we don't really learn more than their names. It's especially interesting to see the little changes he made to his set list for specific locations.<br /><br />In summary, if you're a George Michael fan, you should definitely pick this up. It's likely the only performance you'll get on home media from George Michael, and it's a great one. On blu ray, it looks and sounds fantastic.IOUS BOX  JESUS TO A CHILD  FIRST TIME EVER    BONUS FEATURES: The 42 minute documentary is a bit fluffy and silly, but it gives a nice taste of the European tour.

B002UNMW7O|5.0|Just saw this movie at the theatre tonight and it is by far one of the best movies i've seen in a long time.  The characters have real depth and the dialogue is well written and incredibly witty.  The cast has great chemistry and the story unfolds at a very steady pace.  Speaking of the cast there is certainly one cameo that's in there mostly for the benefit of the Canadian fans of the film (The majority of the crowd would burst into laughter whenever he was shown on the screen) All in all this was an amazing movie with a very memorable ending which better result in a sequel which takes less than 8 years to come out.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|I've had the Beatles Stereo Box set for nearly 3 months now, and have listened to all the albums a number of times through and feel compelled to post my feedback to help anyone unsure about taking the $175.99 financial 'plunge'....     In fairness, I have to admit to being a dedicated Beatles fan (for the past 40 years) - so I'm not going to give an unbiased view on the music collected together here in one place...it's a true treasure trove.     However, I do back up the point a number of other reviewers have put forward that, whisper it, some of these remasters don't actually sound that good - they're better than the 1987 releases, without a shadow of a doubt - but let's face it, it would be difficult for them not to sound better after 22 years of CD development!     Now don't misunderstand me, several albums in this Box Set sound substantially better compared to the late 1980's digital releases:     ABBEY ROAD is now a very satisfying, detailed and dynamic listen - this is especially apparent when you hear the musical 'duel' of guitars and drums that make up the album closer 'The End' - in truth, every track on this remaster is far better than the muddy mix on the 1987 CD.     THE BEATLES (White Album) now delivers a fine stereo image with real 'studio depth' and lots of power to vocals, Lead guitars and Bass guitar - beating the 1987 2CD set quite easily.     SGT PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND is now far more balanced as a stereo listen, especially satisfying on Headphones - all the instruments and vocals now sound believable and crisp, with Paul's melodic Bass playing really jumping forward - it makes the 1987 CD version redundant.     RUBBER SOUL and REVOLVER have a number of highlights - as does the PAST MASTERS set.....but the earlier albums, from PLEASE PLEASE ME to HELP! and the final LET IT BE disc are (at times) not really in the same sonic ball-park.     Now, how could I possibly be so critical of the sound on this Box Set? - Well, I've no doubts thatthe Abbey Road team have done their best - but they have simply squeezed the maximum they can out of 40 to 47 year old Album Master Tapes.     In comparison, over the past 5 years or so we have been treated to the remastered back catalogue of a growing number of equally prominant Artists such as The Doors (on DMC), Elvis Presley (on FTD) and The Rolling Stones (on ABKO) who, after initial 'slap-dash' releases in the 1980's and 1990's have all finally done justice to their heritage by making every effort to trawl tape vaults and sound archives to find, wherever possible, the First Generation Session Multi-tracks to Remix fresh Album Masters - anyone owning any number of these CD's will bear witness to the fact that as a consequence of all this extra effort, they sound truly 'STUNNING' - sounding like they were recorded yesterday....     In fact this technique isn't anything new to the Beatles' Technical Team either, the very same work was done on the 'Yellow Submarine - Songtrack' Album as well as the 'Let it Be - Naked' release - which is why they both sound superior to their respective 2009 remasters.     As such, I feel an opportunity has been lost to make this release a truly definitive one, especially when the Technical Lead for the Remaster Project at Abbey Road (Allan Rouse) has been quoted as saying (in the latest October 2009 U.K.issue of The Record Collector Magazine) that the Remastering process for all the Albums only took around 3 months - not the 4 years that is so often quoted in many reviews...it seems there was plenty of time to provide Remixed Album Masters from the Original 2, 4 and 8 track Session Multi-tracks....but this fantastic opportunity wasn't taken - perhaps it was stopped by the surviving members of the Group - but it's a real shame it didn't happen.....     So, is it worth buying this Stereo Box Set? Well, yes it is.....each CD album is held within its own glossy digipack which includes informative liner notes in a booklet stored within...the outer box (with its outer slip-case and magnetic securing clasp) has been beautifully designed and manufactured - as a result, the whole package gives the owner plenty of user appeal...     Is this the best The Beatles' Albums have sounded on CD? Well, at the moment yes.....but if they'd been Remixed from the Original Session Multi-tracks they would have sounded even better!
B002K0WBYG|4.0|If you liked her attempt at deception in While You Were Sleeping you'll like her in this.  Ms. Bullock is, I think, endearing when she is 'bubbling over' and this role is somewhat of a contrast for her in this regard.  As such, it has very little of the girly charm found in many of her earlier movies.  I think, and my wife agrees, it is still an entertaining romantic comedy as only Sandra Bullock can accomplish.  As a final criteria for purchase; I did buy this movie, but I think my money would have been better spent on a one time rental or even better, waiting for it to come to one of the movie channels.
B00006FDCD|5.0|This movie keeps you wandering what is going to happen next. It does have alot of going back and forth in time between adulthood and childhood but it would not be any good if it didnt do that. Now I know why alot of people are afraid of \\"CLOWNS\\". This is one bad clown. I have a feeling Stephen King must have had a problem with clowns. What do you think?
0547258305|4.0|So its 12 am and I just finished Graceling. It is a rather long book but i found myself thinking about the story even when i wasnt reading it. The book laying on the table was enticing and i found myself absorbing every page after page. I gave it a 4 simply based on leaving me hanging at the end and I hope that the relationship between katsa and Po is continued into the next book or comes into it at sometime where she finally gives in to him and marrys him. Great book would highly recommend this book to a friend. Great winter reading. Pickk up a copy and enjoy an exciting fairytail set in a time that will draw you to its pages for hours at a time.

B0029LHW68|5.0|Words can be very cheap if you try to over-complicate things or try to make things more grandeur than they really are.<br />So I'll be brief, since most who read this are looking for quick opinions before they drop the cash for worthy music.<br /><br />BUY THIS ALBUM.<br /><br />If you haven't already listened to 30 Seconds to Mars' previous albums, for shame! But now is the PERFECT time to start!<br /><br />This album reaches a wide variety of emotion, amazing instrumentals, and clever ways to work a synth machine.<br /><br />The album starts out with 'Escape', which gives you the good kind of goosebumps that you rarely get when putting on a record these days. It follows with a sinfully pleasurable 'Night of the Hunter', the amazing single 'Kings and Queens', and the album just flies wonderfully from there.<br /><br />About 2/3 of the album includes the band's fanbase called Echelon, who they invited to be on the record. The voices of these dedicated people just make the album have a very epic, timeless feel, which you can appreciate from beginning to end.<br /><br />Songs to definitely become a fan of: Night of the Hunter, Search and Destroy, Alibi, Stranger in a Strange Land.<br /><br />Buy this album, listen to it, love it, and listen again. Then go check out their previous CDs if you haven't already, the self-titled 2002 release (30 Seconds to Mars) and the platinum 2005 release (A Beautiful Lie).<br /><br />This Is War is a record for history. Don't miss out on being a part of it.
B0026P3G12|1.0|Whoa Nelly! I knew Susan had had a bash at covering a Stones' song, but I very nearly fell of my stool when I stuck this in my CD player and heard her covering the likes of Rammstein, The Sex Pistols, Slipknot, etc. Her version of Marilyn Manson's Antichrist Superstar is unbelievably good. Stripped of its original heavy guitars and pounding drums, Susan reveals the beautiful melody therein. It begins with plaintive piano and the soft Scottish lilt of Susan's voice, before swelling and bloating into a thing of true magnificence as the strings soar and the brass blasts forth. The song ends with the soft plucking of a pizzicato bass and Susan quietly whispering, \\"The time has come, it is quite clear, our antichrist is almost here... it is done\\". Disturbing stuff indeed.  The real standout for me though is Susan's wonderful take on Black Sabbath's War Pigs. Susan spreads her crumbled moth-wings and stuns us with a starker version than the original. In my opinion, it is possibly the best cover version I have ever heard. I hear she is going to be headlining Lollapalooza next year. Well, if this is true then I will most certainly be buying a ticket for said event. I doubted whether the Boyle-face could live up to the hype, but now I know that she can. In fact she has soared way above expectation. This is nothing to do with hype. Susan is the real thing. The dark soul of Susan penetrates throughout and she has proved herself to be a force to be reckoned with.
B002NXSRX4|5.0|Came sooner than expected (not bad for free shipping!)  Will do business again.  I usually order Blu-rays from amazon.com now instead of visiting the local Best Buy.  Can't beat low prices with free shipping!  Good movie too.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I bought this as I'm a Beatles nut and felt like this would be a great addition to my Beatles collection. I also bought Box of Vision to store it in and am pleased. I transfered the music to my Ipod and now have a conversation piece.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Very cute movie!  We arn't the type who runs out and buys every dvd or blu ray.  Since \\"really\\" how much are we going to watch it??  Anyway, this seems like a great one to add to your collection.  My husband likes it so much, that he actually ALSO asked for a blu ray version for Christmas...lol.  We'll have two copies.  Cute movie and very nicely made!
B0029LHW68|5.0|This album is utterly epic in every way.     This Is War (the song) is by far one of their best yet and the rest of the album is just amazing. Kings and Queens is a great first single and i think the video has potential to win some awards. this album is not even a day old and it is already growing to be one of my favorite albums of all time. Jared's vocals are absolutely amazing and the emotion is felt throughout the entire album. As a whole the band has improved dramatically and really tightened their sound. A Beautiful Lie was a serious change from their debut album and this continues that trend without sounding completely different.     I think 30STM is going in the right direction with this album and nothing bothers me more when people complain about how it doesn't sound the same as before... well no DUH! its not supposed to sound the same. I've heard the same things said about Avenged Sevenfold and it breaks my heart.    Congratulations 30STM on another amazing album and hopefully you all start getting the recognition you deserve for your hard work and amazing music.
B0019LY5IM|4.0|OK, People are complaining about the lack of commentaries on this set but it's really unavoidable. Commentaries on the other sets have been done mostly by the actors in the scene and they have no insight into what is behind the story of the scene in the scope of things which is what the community craves. They just make small talk and reminisce. That is because they don't want to give things away so if they gave you more commentaries it would just be more of this pointless small talk that adds nothing to the story. Do I want to listen to that kind of commentary, no! So why complain when they spare you from dealing with this ?<br /><br />Unfortunately what this leads to is the conclusion that they \\"may\\" decide to re-release the discs with real commentary at a future date but only if they decide it's not better to let people endlessly speculate!<br />Patrick McGoogan only did limited talks about The Prisoner and the original series still spurs discussion. From what we can glean, he was guided by \\"gut\\" feel on a lot of it and he may not fully understand all the levels of it just as Bob Dylan is surprised by things that people find in his songs as he tries to make them rhyme. Sometimes there is divine inspiration coming through so it couldn't be fully explained anyway. But I digress...<br /><br />1. I don't want to have anything revealed to me that would spoil my surprise as the show wraps up so I don't want significant plot points revealed in the commentary and I feel the show's creators feel the same way. After the show ends, My feelings on this subject will change but the show's creators opinion may not.<br />2. In light of first point, the only thing to do for people who want more commentaries is to have a whole bunch of actors on the show make small talk for each episode. Do you REALLY want to listen to all that?<br /><br />So that's why it is what it is.
B002DXN2PW|5.0|This is one of the rawest, most primal expressions of the punk rock style ever recorded. Sadly, Johnny Thunders' career inevitably descended into a junkie fog and he became a parody of himself, but for a brief shining moment here he shows his potential. The unsung hero of the record is guitarist Walter Lure, who lays down some legendary guitar lines. This is a must-own recording for anyone who likes hard and fast rock music. There is a lot of talk about the different mixes of LAMF, but all you really need to know is that this one is the best.
B001GJOL22|5.0|My first Blue-ray disc and this concert cd doesn't dissapoint. The image clarity, camera shots and sound make this a must own if you are a fan of Rush.
0767836324|5.0|This is such a great movie.  It's one of my son's favorites.  I like the imagination and good message.  My son claims to be Peter Pan somedays and other days Hook.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Dexter gets better and better. Clever storytelling and greatcasting. This show really does go from strength to strength.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|So why four stars and not five?  Don't misunderstand, it's a great film and definitely worth seeing.  I even bought it, so I must have really liked it.  And while I'm an old Trek fan, the new cast didn't bother me; I thought they did a very good job at interpreting the characters, with Uhura and Spock being particular standouts.  So again, why four stars?  Because of the glaring plot holes in the script.  Yes, it's science fiction and yes, I understand the need to suspend disbelief.  But that's in regards to things like space travel and black holes, not when it comes to people's motivations.  Those need to stay at least somewhat grounded in reality, and a lot of times in this film, they didn't.  That was esp. true when old Spock sent Kirk off to talk to young Spock, with the fate of earth riding on the outcome, and didn't go with him because he wanted the two to explore their friendship?! There were other head scratching moments but that just about blew the movie for me.  If the writers wanted old Spock out of the picture for a while, there were other ways to do it.  That reason made no absolutely sense, and made suspension of disbelief a struggle for the rest of the film. Even with the script issues though, it's a solid four stars from me, mainly because of the actors.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|I just bought the blu ray version and it has both English \\"narrative\\" and \\"theatrical\\" subtitles as well as both english and swedish master dts audio. I was worried I would get stuck with the bad subtitle version however I didnt.
B002XHN776|4.0|Overall a pretty great cd. I love Kings and Queens. Great song. A few of the songs were a bit iffy for me, but all in all a great cd for 30 Seconds to Mars.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|I have always enjoyed Jimmy Stewart and Barbara Reed in this movie.  When it was put on Blue Ray and in color I could not believe the quality in the picture.  I will enjoy this for many years to come.
B002T921DE|5.0|What a great way to remember such a wonderful night that I had in Chicago.  Not the same set list, but he put on all the favorites.  I think the sound quality is great and the blu ray quality is superb! If you like performances quality shows, then is your DVD. You don't have to love George Michael to truly enjoy this show.
B001PO53IO|5.0|I may be one of the few who actually enjoyed the prequel trilogy, so before I begin let me provide a brief bit of insight. I was 7 years old when \\"Star Wars\\" (which would eventually become Episode 4: A New Hope) was released theatrically. I saw that film SEVERAL times in 1977.   Anyway as a piece of entertainment the season one collection of The Clone Wars is very well done. Yes it is a cartoon and the series runs on the cartoon network, but I think it finds a nice balance of staying true to the basic aspects of the films and being suitable for kids without putting adults to sleep. The storylines are complex and offer insight into aspects of the overall narrative (the clones as individuals, a look at other Jedi, and even an examination of the bad guys) that help support episode 3.     The animation work is superior to most broadcast cartoons (as would be expected from Lucasfilm) and has a certain style visually that works for this series( yes if you are a fan of Pixar and Dreamworks animated features you will complain about certain aspects like the fact that hair doesn't behave in a manner that you may have come to expect, but these people where going for a different objective)    Now please DO NOT BE FOOLED! I am supporting the animated series, not the animated \\"film\\" Clone Wars that was released a few months prior to the series which makes up this box set. I think it was a wise choice that the producers have kept the two VERY seperate.     Visually the animation looks great, I have a PS3 and the discs play with no problems, the sound is great as would be the case with anything from the \\"Star Wars\\" world. Blu-ray is the format of choice for this box set, but even if you have a regular dvd play I am sure The Clone Wars set would look fantastic! My one overly fan boy comment would be that it would have been interesting if Lucas had made episode 3 but HELD on to it until after this series had run (let's all be honest, the film would have made good money even if it wasrelease in 2012) it may have made the overall story stronger.     If you can appreciate it Clone Wars series for what it really is (a chance to expand upon a story that wasn't really given a fair chance to be told from the start) then you will be pleasantly surprised with this box set. I think it is a perfect addition to any big or little kids Star Wars video collection.
1552091090|5.0|I bought this book for my 21 year old son for Christmas.  It was our favorite when he was a child.
0810983915|5.0|I've given two or three of the Wimpy Kid books, and my nephew really enjoys reading them. I've read some of it, and it's pretty funny.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|I didn't think I'd like this CD; the only reason I got it was because I couldn't get Poker Face out of my head. Not only did listening to Poker Face 100s of times further burn the song into my head, I got all her other songs in my head now! I love the Pop Goodness of this album. It's a happy, go lucky CD. I throw on The Fame Monster and my mood always brightens. Great CD.
B002NXSRVG|4.0|Going into this movie, I didn't expect much.  Especially after watching Transformers II, my expectations was rock bottom, but when GI JOE is compared with Transformers, GI JOE is an absolute masterpiece.  The acting is acceptable, action scenes are at least enjoyable.  And most of all, at least the dialect doesn't insult one's intelligence. Without watching Transformers, probably give this movie a 3 star at most, it's an average action movie based on a memorable childhood cartoon.  The one extra star is really because after watching probably one of the biggest stinkers ever made, it's hard to not enjoy any other movie.<br /><br />Don't expect a deep story and relating characters, these movies are just about action, brainless fun, and GI Joe does exactly that.
0937381888|5.0|I got several books to educate myself on the process of beer brewing and this one was by far my favorite.  It is well laid out and covers pretty much all aspects of brewing for the beginner (extract), intermediate (partial mash) and advanced (all-grain) brewer.  I appreciated the technical detail that I didn't find in other books and while that's not critical for the budding brewer, it's good to have a reference as you expand your knowledge.  This book has been responsible for two successful batches so far and the end to end process is very easy to follow.  I also tried one recipe from it and it turned out rather good.  I am glad to have this book in my collection and if I could only purchase one book on how to homebrew, this would be it.  Cheers!
B001TODCII|5.0|WOW! \\"Taken\\" is an outstanding, suspenseful, action-packed thriller about Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson), a former international spy whose teenage daughter is kidnapped while on an overseas trip with one of her friends. Bryan hurries to Paris and uses all his old spy skills to track down the creeps who have taken his daughter and plan to sell her into prostitution.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the film by giving away too many details, so let's just say that \\"Taken\\" is an awesome movie! You'll be sitting on the edge of your seat the whole time. Watch this one today!<br /><br />(P.S. I heart Liam. He ROCKS in this movie!)
B002Q9MZF6|5.0|While my personal favorite of Puccini's operas is most definitely Tosca, especially the Georghiu / Alagna version, this is a lovely performance of the ever popular La Boheme. Mireila Freni and Eva Marton, for example, have splendid voices, but there's no doubt that a handsome, well matched pair like Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazon carry a great deal of conviction as the young lovers of the tale. Their looks and considerable acting ability are further enhanced by the realistic settings of Dornhelm's production. I don't see any objection to the \\"feature filmification\\" of operas, though some purists despise it; after all, the costumes, stars and sets of opera in previous centuries must have had the same kind of impact on the observer then as the silver screen does today.<br /><br />Netrebko and Villazon sing and act superbly; the Vienna sets are most convincing. The widescreen is great. The support performances are also first rate, especially Nicole Cabell as Musetta. It's a delightful emotional wallow!
B00003CXB4|4.0|this movie has had a great impact on a handicapped girl and the people who care for her.......thank you
B00168OIOE|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of Monsters Inc but when I viewed it on Blu ray it took my enjoyment to the next level.  My family and I really enjoy the vibrancy of the colors and the interactive screens.  It was worth every penny spent.
0312944926|2.0|I would only read this book if you are stuck in an airport with a HUGE delay ahead of you.  It passes the time nicely enough, and you won't get upset about constantly stopping your reading to check your flight plan, go eat, etc.  OTHERWISE, it is kind of a let-down.  The book's plot was extrememly easy to follow (too easy), each twist was frustrating rather than enticing.  I just really didn't care for the characters, the story, or the sequence of events.<br />Each to their own.
B002XHN776|5.0|I have been eagerly awaiting the release of This Is War; checking out the 30 Seconds to Mars' website, their teaser clips, and updates. I just purchased the tracks and am now listening for the first time as I type. I can honestly say that I am so very impressed!  This is a fabulous follow-up to A Beautiful Lie, and I cannot wait to see what they come up with for video's for this album.  Love it, and definitely recommend it as well!
B002PMV9FG|1.0|Not only does it bare little resemblance to the main parts of the book, but the director's use of gray and blue filters, meant to covey, I guess, drama and foreboding, just takes away from the watching of this \\"thing.\\"<br /><br />By the time I was ten minutes into the movie I was so distracted by the off-colors, kind of like a very bad \\"colorized\\" black and white movie, that the plot points escaped me. I really had to concentrate on the story, sometimes looking at the floor so that the muddy picture wouldn't distract me, but finally gave up after an hour.<br /><br />Maybe it redeemed itself in the last hour and a half, but I doubt it.<br /><br />I had to add that my wife, who dearly loves the Harry Potter books, and owns both the VHS and DVD copies of the first three films, can't stand watching this either. She now plays it only when she is in bed, back turned towards the TV as she is falling asleep.<br /><br />Update...02/16/2012<br /><br />I pre-ordered the complete Harry Potter set on Blu-ray discs (11 discs and the entire 8 movie collection) from AmazonUK in September of  2011 for a delivered price of $46.00 in mid-November of 2011 (30 British Pounds).<br /><br />Watching the movies and special discs on Blu-ray, and this one again, It was an enjoyable movie with good lighting. I can only surmise that the single movie, on the DVD disc that I received was an extremely poor transfer and low quality disc. The difference was night and day.
B000M9L7KQ|4.0|this album was from yes rick  wakeman. it was wellplayed when it 1st came out. very intersting songs
B001CFLHJA|4.0|Wonderfully talented jazzartist. It also has parts of funk and pop to it wich makes it very interesting.
B00122J3S0|2.0|I love early Sinatra.  Not the stuff with Harry James, which is mediocre, but the early stuff with Tommy Dorsey, which is great.  Later, Sinatra lost his voice to alcohol, cigarettes, and general dissipation, and adopted a style that attempted (not very successfully) to disguise the fact that he could no longer sing.  Buble imitates the later Sinatra, after he could no longer sing. Maybe Buble can sing.  I've listened to several whole albums, in the snippets provided by Amazon, and I'm sorry to say, not one track provides any evidence that he can sing at all, unlike early Sinatra.  So if you actually like Sinatra, post voice, you might actually like Buble.  But if you liked the earlier warm, intimate, sincere Sinatra sound, you'll hate Buble, as I do.
B00005MCX0|5.0|The album was remastered and re-released in 1996, and much of the drum and bass playing was re-recorded, as well as additional vocals added. Three bonus tracks were also included.  The merits of the reworkings are debatable; personally I don't like when things are messed with like George Lucas and his mucking with Star Wars, or the use of autotune on Let it Be.  I want the original work of art, not the new and improved one.  So I think the original 6 track cd or the LP are the ones to search out.  The '96 mastering is excellent though, and there are no problems with the music except that it isn't the same music from 1971.<br /><br />This album shows Hawkwind moving away from the folk based sound of their debut to a heavy guitar, SF themed lyrics, spacey electronic sound.  In addition, one can see elements of psych, prog, trance, and free jazz.  It's quite the witches brew.  If you have any interest in psyc/prog/space/stoner/70's rock, this in an essential album.
0061719544|5.0|This is an awesome book -You will not be able to put it down. It shows the every day man or woman that no matter how down and out you may be in your life - there is hope and definitely hope and light and the end of any tunnel - no matter how long that tunnel may be!
B0000TB014|5.0|This purchase was worth every penny and came in a timely manner in good condition. Great purchase!
B001GM28HO|5.0|This cd, this artist, is awesome! Her follow up cd, The Fame Monster, is just as awesome!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|A very entertaining Star Trek. The movie was well written, with great special effects. I highly recommend it.
B001IF252M|4.0|I got this for my son's laptop. He had purchased one that looked right, but was for a different model laptop. This one works for the Apple Mini DisplayPort, but it only works for that exact name display connection. There are two different connectors on Apple laptops, and they use different VGA Adapters. This one works fine if your model has the Apple Mini DisplayPort.    The only reason I did not give this five stars is that the VGA connector screws thread into plastic. Tha means they will strip out after they are used several times.
B000URDE2Y|5.0|This put Robin Trower on the map.<br />A must have for a Trower fan!
B000001DVD|5.0|Def Leppard fans: you'll love this freshman entry. It's a must have for<br />Leppard fans.
B001993Y3G|5.0|The product came in perfect shape, time and convenience. Couldn't ask for any better service. Thank you Amazon.
B0026P3G12|5.0|A couple of songs seemed a tad pitchy in spots, however she is a phenomenal singer.  She sings \\"You'll See\\" better than Madonna in my opinion.  I feel as though I am sitting in the balcony of a broadway musical while listening to that song.  Gives me goosebumps like the music from Phantom of the Opera does.  I would highly recommend this CD if you enjoy that genre of music.
0307716988|5.0|THIS BOOK IS AMAZING AND IT HAS A PHOTOCOPY OF HIS 1983 AUTOGRAPH INSIDE THE COVER AS WELL AS ON IT IF YOU REMOVE THE PAPER COVERING. I PERSONALLY LOVED THE PICTURES IN IT AND READING THE SECTION ABOUT HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH WOMEN.HE TALKS ABOUT BROOKE SHIELDS A LOT AND TATUM O'NEAL AS HIS GIRL FRIENDS. AND OF COURSE DIANA ROSS AND ELIZABETH TAYLOR. I'M A HUGE FAN SO I WAS A BIT DISAPPOINTED WHEN HE LEFT OUT STEPHANIE MILLS AND TATIANA THUMBTZEN.  BUT THE BOOK REALLY IS WRITTEN IN A WAY THAT COULD HAVE MADE IT AN BIOGRAPHY MEANING THAT HE NEVER WENT DEEP INTO ANYTHING. HE JUST STATED THE OBVIOUS STAGES IN HIS LIFE.DON'T EXPECT TOO MUCH JUST REALIZE THAT HE TELLS YOU HIS LIFE UP TO 1988 IN CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER.
B000F9RB9Y|2.0|Having just purchased a Blu-Ray I was mortified when I popped this movie in.  What the heck, where is that superb, almost life like imagery?  Come to find out, they only upscaled the standard video.  A real disappointment and a really misleading product.  At least I didn't pay alot of money for it.<br /><br />Let's hope this doesn't become a trend.
B002SJIO5E|1.0|They had the potential to make a pretty good movie here and completely blew it.  If they had spent even a tenth of the time trying to make it good as they spent trying to make it gross it might have been an OK movie.  Had I not been with other people at the theater when I saw it I would have simply gotten up and left - something I've done only one time in my life.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|Marc Forster ([[ASIN:B0007CNXUK Finding Neverland (Widescreen Edition)]]) directs a strange tale of a man who discovers he's a character in a novel!<br /><br />Will Ferrell's character, Harold Crick, has been going through life for the last ten years as an auditor for the IRS, methodical, counts every step, times himself to precision.  He even counts the brush strokes while brushing his teeth and has the single slip knot tie science down.<br /><br />One day he finds he has a narrator and discovers he is the main character in a novel, by a woman (Emma Thompson as Kay Eiffel) who's trying to figure out how to kill him off but she can't get rid of her writer's block.<br /><br />As she chain smokes and downs vodka in an attempt to discover the proper way to wrap the plot, Crick finds that he must stop this author at all costs.  His life depends on it.  As the narrator gets loud and he's the only person who can hear it, he yells at it, looks for it, and finally begs for help to figure out who is narrating his life before it's too late.<br /><br />Interesting premise by screenwriter Zack Helm harkens to a story I recall reading from L. Ron Hubbard, published back in the 1940s called Typewriter in the Sky ([[ASIN:0884049337 Typewriter in the Sky]]).<br /><br />Both books pertain to a guy who finds himself living a fictional story.  Both characters are struggling with not dying but trying to change the plot before their respective authors kill them off.  And of course they both have occupations that no one likes:  Pirate and a Tax Collector.<br /><br />Well, as an analogy, Isaac Asimov's galactic empire and George Lucas' Star Wars galactic empire are similar as well.  [Compare: [[ASIN:0380508567 The Foundation Trilogy]] and [[ASIN:0345475828 Star Wars Trilogy]]<br /><br />The stories between Zach's and Hubbard's are overall dissimilar in many other ways.  Harold Crick has actually come to life in modern times, actually meets his author and attempts to change his fate and then comes to accept it as the only way.  But it plays out differently and has a cute ending which I won't reveal of course.<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman ([[ASIN:B000ZM1MG4 Tootsie - 25th Anniversary Edition]]) plays the literary professor who at first thinks Harold is nuts but then plays along and finds that perhaps Harold actually is hearing a narrator.  The professor is convinced that Harold must die for the good of the plot.<br /><br />It's a lot of fun seeing the character changing before the viewer's eyes.  Harold was introverted, alone, methodical and on a rat race treadmill.  When the treadmill was shaken he did all he could to build a better mouse trap.<br /><br />Philosophically, we can look at the tale as a disregard for fate, that we are not predestined to lead a certain path but can choose our own paths.<br /><br />Ferrell, with Maggie Gyllenhaal (she's great as the romantic lead, Ana, and you've seen her in: [[ASIN:B001NA4CMI The Dark Knight (Two-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy with Exclusive Steelbook Packaging) ~ Christian Bale, Heath Ledger, Maggie Gyllenhaal, and Aaron Eckhart (DVD - Dec 9, 2008)]]) and Queen Latifa ([[ASIN:B00005JM4B Bringing Down The House (Widescreen Edition)]]) make for a fun cast.<br /><br />The humor is there, dark at times, and a bit of toilet humor (it is 2006 after all) make for an entertaining picture that you really must see.<br /><br />The DVD has plenty of features, several extended and deleted scenes and interviews with the cast and crew that really show the love they had for this film.<br /><br />I really liked the music as well -- \\"Give a little time for the child within you.\\"  Great stuff, quite endearing.<br /><br />The filmed interviews, one used in the film, had a critic book show called The Book Channel, with Darlene Sunshine.  Darlene won't let a little thing like research or even reading a book stop her from having a good time interviewing authors who appear on her show.  Hilarious.<br /><br />Other movies bydirector Marc Forster:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B001PPLIEQ Quantum of Solace (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00005YU1M Monster's Ball]]onster's Ball]]
B002KSPKRS|5.0|These are great.  Every now and then theres a \\"pop\\" noise, very rare, this is because they are wireless, I'd much rather have a pop here and there than have a wired set.  If you want a wired set, look at the Tritton brand. Heard plenty of sounds I had never heard before.  I mostly play Battlefield: Bad Company, everything sounds way better than my standard surround sound stereo.
0061091480|5.0|I first read this book in the 80's and have revisited it dozens of times.  I can honestly say Wayne's philosophy created the most dramatic change of my life. From cover to cover there are countless examples of how to deal with our emotional baggage. I can't estimate how many friends I've turned on to this book.    As other viewers have stated, his philosophy has changed over time and I tend to ignore his newer work.
B001FB55HQ|4.0|I've been a fan of the Terminator series for as long as there's been a Terminator series and at the conclusion of each of the films there's been a steady theme to my wonderment: When is John Connor going to fulfill his destiny as the savior of humanity?  Unfortunately, my near-famous question remains unanswered once more in Terminator Salvation but before we get into all that, let's explore the nitty-gritty, shall we?<br /><br />The film represents the fourth full-length motion picture release in the Terminator franchise and the first of which is notably missing T-800 Model 101 portrayal by iconic actor-turned politician, Arnold Schwarzenegger (although there is a segment so well done in his absence that I'm actually going to have to look up how they did it).<br /><br />For years now we've seen glimpses into the future via brief sequences in each of the films, video games, television series and so on.  It's almost always the same: Black skies behind a global junkyard just littered with human skulls for the advancing robotic exoskeletons to crush with their feet and tank treads.  Humans cower behind rubble while taking potshots at the seemingly invincible mechanized armada before them, armed with brightly flashing lasers and odd hovering aircraft.  It's pretty bleak but then again it's pretty tough to imagine a friendly scenario when describing an event labeled \\"Judgment Day\\".  Here's the thing- for as long as we've been fed these disturbing post apocalyptic images, we've been given the promise of hope in one man; a man so influential in turning the tide against the machines that they have attempted his assassination (unsuccessfully) across three full movies and two seasons of network television.<br /><br />Set in the post Judgment Day timeline, Terminator Salvation has been perhaps the closest in potentially allowing the lead character to begin displaying the sheer omnipotence that will eventually be the machines' undoing (save for a few brief seconds at the end of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines) but alas, the film makes it clear pretty early on that this is more a Kyle Reese survival tale and an excuse to introduce a new mechanized hybrid (Marcus Wright) then it is John Connor's coming into his own.<br /><br />The setting is bleak, but not near as bad as the scene we've been teased with all these years (I'm assuming that's because those shots must have represented the moments directly after the robot-induced nuclear war).  It's 2018 in Salvation and the world has been pretty much handed over to the machines.  Small human outposts are scattered about but the \\"Resistance\\" isn't nearly as well defined here as has been hinted to throughout the franchise.  Rather, both a military and civilian presence coexist amidst the mechanical mayhem.<br /><br />Connor is as a member of the military effort here (along with his wife Catherine \\"Kate\\") though his portrayal this time around is closer to that of a low-ranking stereotypical loose cannon than a natural born leader.  In the film's defense, by the end an opportunity for Connor's rapid advancement through the ranks is presented, though there is little along the way that hints to exactly how John Connor's going to inevitably turn the tides once and for all (you'll think it is explained early on, but that thread is a bit of a dead end by the film's conclusion as well).<br /><br />One of the coolest elements of the film's timeline is that it allows for a nice intimate look at some of the weapons and mechanized beasties that the machines have built in effort to keep us lowly humans in check.  Love or hate the influence computer-generated imaging has had on movie making in recent years, there is little doubt that the sheer scale and complexity of many of the sequences here would not have been possible when the earlier films were dazzling movie-goers.<br /><br />Among the mentionables are a single-shot helicopter crash sequence that certainly harkens back to some of the finer techniques used in Cloverfield and a robotic sentry that's absolutely terrifying due to it's sheer size and firepower.  I will refrain from gushing over the motorcycle-piloting droids (\\"Mototerminators\\") that dislodge from the large Harvesters to give chase, the slow, methodic machine-gunning of the T-600s, or the very Matrix-esque \\"Hydrobots\\" that patrol the waterways.  The point is there is far more going on in the land of the machines than simply mindless marching metal skeletons.<br /><br />And speaking of the Matrix, it would be wrong to skate through this review without at least mentioning the apparent influence the series had on the Terminator's prose.  In all fairness Terminator did it first but while the T-movies were typically set in contemporary time frames with classic horror elements driving a very human emotional chase, this is the first opportunity for the franchise to shift into true science fiction mode.  And I'm pleased to report that it does that well.  Everything from hand-to-hand combat, futuristic weapons, human-mechanical hybrids, to radioactive fallout make their presence felt here.  Couple this to the typical tension-laden \\"Terminator\\" sound score and you have yourself a heck of fun thrill ride.<br /><br />Surprisingly, however (especially considering the swing to science fiction), there is really absolutely nothing to do with time travel in this one.  It is mentioned in the dialog and the back story of John Connor attempting to keep young Kyle Reese (his father) safe so that he himself may exist, pays homage to the time-twisting prose of the prior films, but nowhere here is the concept solidified.  So much so is it's avoidance that it leaves viewers wondering such things is how the technology will be discovered, by whom, and so on.<br /><br />Maybe it's for the best such things were left untouched considering the sheer amount of continuity discrepancies already taking up server space just in arguments stemming from the time travel in the first three movies and the Sarah Connor Chronicle TV series.<br /><br />Other minor complaints include an impromptu heart transplant (in the most non-sterile environment imaginable) and a John Connor with an absolute disdain for mechanical organisms (despite, as the other movies/ TV shows have led us believe, having practically grown up around those that protected him as well as tried to destroy him).  Small nit picks, sure, but long time fans of the franchise will surely pick up on these things.<br /><br />In all, and despite what my review may have you thinking, this is an enjoyable film from beginning to end.  If this seems hard to believe considering my abundant criticisms, rest assured that the Terminator pictures have rarely stood up well to scientific scrutiny.  The point is they exist to entertain and Salvation, just like the others, doesn't disappoint in that area.  The action is intense, the pace nice and brisk, and the visuals quite spectacular throughout.  The acting is solid and even the science doesn't require absolute suspension of disbelief (usually a prerequisite in scifi).  At the end of the day it's a fun popcorn flick that manages to make up for its lack of intricate story structure with sheer style.  Just don't go in expecting to finally understand why the robots of the future have made it their number one priority to eliminate John Connor even if they had to invent time travel to do it...

0060899220|5.0|This author and book continue to please long after it's original release.  I have given this particular book as a gift often over the years and it never disappoints.  Foodies and chefs alike delight in Tony's acerbic wit and dead-on description of the 'restaurant underbelly\\"
B002RV01Q8|5.0|This is an excellent collection of songs and music by the incomparable Enya. I don't usually by best ofs because they aren't typcially a true collection of hits by the artist, but in her case it simply doesn't matter. The selections are all wonderful and I honestly can't say enough about it. If you are an Enya fan, then this collection of songs is an amazing choice for any CD collection. I highly recommend it.
B002T921DE|4.0|I'll keep this brief because pretty much everyone already said what I wanted to say.  Like with most, wtf is wrong with the audio?!!    Regardless, great music from a great artist!
B002HNA95E|4.0|Let me start by saying that I've been a fan of Madonna's music since the beginning, so a 2 disc compilation is going to be received with open arms but also with a critical eye. For a Madonna hits compilation to be complete, Warner Brothers should have release a 4 disc box set. There are so many songs missing. What keeps this collection from being 5 stars are the errors contained, errors that cannot be overlook. \\"Music\\" sounds atrocious  and \\"Erotica\\" suffers from a poor edit. Below is my song by song opinion. I know others did it but here's mine:    Disc 1    1. Hung Up- Should have the single version to make room for better versions  of others songs on disc 1  2. Music- Music is a perfect song but not this one. Pops and clicks through out.  3. Vogue- Should have been the single edit, not the longer IC version.  4. 4 Minutes- Not my favorite song. This shorter version is fine by me.  Others will disagree.  5. Holiday- I love this song but a 6 minute version is not necessary. A  shortened version would have sufficed.  6. Everybody- Perfect  7. Like a Virgin- The longer album version would have been better.  8. Into the Groove- The original version makes it's glorious return.  Perfect.  9. Like a Prayer- Original album version. Perfect.  10. Ray of Light- This is the single edit. Not acceptable. Original album  version should be here.  11. Sorry- Perfect  12. Express Yourself- They almost got it right. Almost the video version. Mine seem the have a scratch at the very end. Not sure if it's my disc only or a manufacturing issue.   13. Open Your Heart- this seems to be the single version. It's fine.  14. Borderline- Should have been the longer album version.  15. Secret- The fade out single version. Should have been the album  version.  16. Erotica- Butchered single edit. Unacceptable  17. Justify My Love- This is fine.  18. Revolver- Horrible song. Week vocals. Terrible lyrics and rap.  DISC 2  1. Dress you Up- Slight modified. Perfect.  2. Material Girl- Shortened version. I know this is a lot to ask but the  video version with dialogue should have opened the disc. \\"She could be a  star, a major star.\\" This version is fine.  3. La Isla Bonita- Original album version. Perfect.  4. Papa Don't Preach- This version is fine. Again (asking for a lot) the  video outro with the extended strings would have been perfect.  5. Lucky Star- Nice surprise. It seems like they turned up the guitar  volume.  6. Burning Up- Perfect.  7. Crazy for You- Perfect  8. Who's that Girl- Finally a remastered version. Not her greatest song but  sounds amazing here.  9. Frozen- Perfect  10. Miles Away- I question it being here instead of another song but it  sounds good and the ending is slightly different than the album version.  11. Take a Bow- Making it's 3rd appearance on a compilation but needs to be  here. Perfect.  12. Live to Tell- Same as above. Perfect.  13. Beautiful Stranger- I have to be in the mood for this song but sounds  great. Full version.  14. Hollywood- The only AMERICAN LIFE song that appears. Sounds good.  15. Die Another Day- Perfect.  16. Don't Tell Me- Sounds perfect until it get cut off at the end instead  of the fade. Who butchered this one?  17. Cherish- The IC version is fine but I question why it's the last old  song on the disc.  18. Celebration- This song doesn't break new ground but it's still a good  dance sound. Nice way to close the album.    SONGS THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED AS WELL  1. Physical Attraction  2. Angel  3. Love Don't Live Here Anymore  4. Gambler  5. True Blue  6. Where's the Party  7. Spotlight (a single edit version)  8. Causing a Commotion  9. Oh Father  10. Keep it Together  11. Hanky Panky  12. Sooner or Later (only because it won a Oscar)  13. Rescue Me  14. Deeper and Deeper  15. Fever (should be since it was a European Hit)  16. Bad Girl  17. Rain  18. This Used to be My Playground  19. I'll Remember  20. Human Nature (album version)  21. Bedtime Story  22. You'll See  23. You Must Love Me  24.Don't Cry For Me Argentina(Miami Mix Edit since it was a dance hit)  25. Power of Good-Bye  26. Nothing Really Matters  27. Drowned World/Substitute for Love  28. American Pie  29. What it Feels Like For a Girl  30. American Life  31. Nothing Fails  32. Love Profusion  33. Get Together  34. Jump  35. Give it 2 Me    With these added songs, you can see how it could have easily been a 4 disc collection.     Madonna fans are very picky and none of us would have been 100% happy. CELEBRATION does have some flaws. Based on that, I can understand why some would skip this. But we also have must have gems that make this essential for one's collection.
B000002UXZ|5.0|One of the best live recordings in rock history...Gypsys captures Hendrix at the top of his game.  With the rhythm section of Buddy Miles and Billy Cox, this exploratory improv has true American roots and tastes of funk and soul.  Probably the most \\"soul\\" of any Hendrix release...mainstream releases anyway.  There is another release which is taken from the same run of shows but it is apparent why thiese selections made the cut while the other albums' didnt.  This is the cream of the crop from this run...New Years in NYC at Graham's Fillmore.       One need go no further than \\"Machine Gun\\" to understand why Jimi is in a completely different category than other electric guitarists.  His approach seems other-worldly, particularly in 1970.  Although his tendency to explore , improvise, and push the envelope of the creative method in rock csan sometimes  seem to go too far---and leave the listener questioning whether the music wouldnt sound better if he stuck to traditional styles and methods....when the stars align Hendrix rides a brilliance that makes one no longer doubt the presence of GOD and the power and existence of unseen forces.  Indeed at times likes these Hendrix appears to be going along for the ride with the rest of us...allowing himself to be the medium...channeling the energy and ideas from a mystical source beyond human understanding!       This is definitely beyond HARD rock and perhaps too overpowering for older or less adventurous ears.                \\"IF IT ISN'T A LIVING BABY, THEN YOUR'E NOT PREGNANT\\"      -Thank God Jimi's Mother wasn't decieved into believing he was an \\"inconvenience\\" and burden, an obstacle to her happiness.  Indeed ALL children are gifts from God that bring us hope, joy, and the experience of giving and recieving unconditional love, even though we may not be able to see this truth because of our fear and lack of trust.  Money cannot buy these things, man cannot create them on his own.  May we revere life and realize EACH INDIVIDUAL PERSON is unique and unrepeatable!  When Freedom is Outlawed, Only Outlaws are Free!
B001JJBO74|1.0|This book is NOT a guide.<br />You can find better reviews, and criticism (IF THAT is what you're looking for) on Perfume Blogs on the Web.
B000JQUKKU|3.0|I won't waste your time reviewing the story itself.  You all know it.  If you haven't read it, do so, whether it is this version or not.    As for this particular version, the index is not active, but there are only 5 chapters, or 'Staves', and the book is really very short, usually only around 100 pages in a traditional book.  There are a few formatting issues throughout the story, but nothing, in my opinion, that takes away from the enjoyment of reading this heartwarming classic.  I have read this book many times, and have found errors in paper versions as well.  So take it for what it is; a free, slightly flawed, version of a wonderful story that has become a part of our collective consciousness.      I should point out that my rating of three stars is for this version, due to some minor formatting issues.  The book itself deserves five stars.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|Just love it, may be Norah's best work  - it took a second listen to get past the electric effects, but I read the lyrics and the sound matched the story being told and needed to have a bit of a buzz. After a few listens, I now laugh when I say to friends - this is heavy metal for baby boomers. All the songs are great - I wake up in in the morning with the songs in my head.  Even though they are mostly break up songs they seem upbeat - \\"Back To Manhattan\\" can pull at your heart though. I love \\"Chasing Pirates\\" and \\"December\\", very hard to pick favorites. They're all so good it's as if they are all old favorites you've been listening to for years.  Each song is different - nice variety within the break up theme, from sad to humorous.  Highly recommended.
