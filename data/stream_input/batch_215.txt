B00005LC1H|5.0|This is up there with the classic TV comedies like &quot;Your show of Shows&quot; and &quot;Monty Python&quot;.  I love it, you will too. Buy it already.
B00003CXUM|4.0|really exciting love story. But not what you expect, if you hear the name Wong Kar-Wai: no gangstar flick here. The famous Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung playing neighbors, betrayed by their husband eg. wife. Coming up with a touching loveaffair between these two, Wong Kar-Wai shows another time his genius narrative skills. This text refers to the german DVD with mandarin language and german subtitles. Also available subs: English, Spanish, French, Italian...
B00005U1YO|1.0|Perhaps it's the end of an era. The orb's last album was [not good], underworld ended on a pretty mediocre note, and Norman Cook looks set to do more collaborations with that awful Macey Grey woman. Now the Chemical Brothers finally let me down. I have fallen in love with all their past albums, but this one is a big disappointment. Hopefully they're just stuck in a rut... Back to the album: Where it's dancey, it's formulaic and boring. Where it tries for psychedelia, it's noodley and kind've annoying. Overall it sounds like it was made by some skilled but uninspired Chemical Bros imitators. One star may be a little harsh, but I expected so much. Oh Arse.
B00005OCMR|5.0|Back in July of 1982, the local theatre in my town presented this new film from Disney Productions called &quot;TRON&quot; (for you beginning computer users, TRON is an ancronym for &quot;TRiggerON&quot;-the other half being &quot;TRiggerOFF&quot;-old BASIC instructions).Nobody never heard of this film, and being a sci-fi fan, I went to this film to check it out, and with &quot;E.T.&quot; being out at this time, it was a complete fantastic experience-to see a computer generated sci-fi, with all of the buttons and whistles inside the story. Later on that summer, I went to a big city to see &quot;TRON&quot; again-only this time on a Cinerama Screen-for &quot;TRON&quot; was photographed in 65MM, then printed on 70MM 6track Magnetic sound. NOW..that was the presentation to witness and to experience-seeing that movie on a 45x100 foot 120 degree arc screen with that 6-channel sound ! Thank you Disney Productions in releasing this DVD version..It's great to see this film once again..the beginnings of the CGA world..and the Disney Magic lives on.
630518299X|4.0|And in case I don't see ya: Good afternoon, good evening and good night. This movie is sometimes very funny because of the great acting Jim Carrey but the whole content of the story has got a bad mood. The fact that a person is supervised all his life is horrible. But for the spectators Truman becomes part of their life. It's amazing to see that a movie star can become part of a person's life. Everything in Truman's life is fiction and everybody is an actor.<BR>Perhaps one of the best movies which combines seriousness and fun.
B000002MIF|4.0|...and *definitely* not Strangeways...THIS is the Smiths' most dynamic and comprehensive disk.  The Smiths actually kind of 'rock out' on some of these songs, in contrast to the typical pop-rock style their other releases were done in.  Even though most of these tracks are contained somewhere on the 20 or so other albums and cash-in compilations that make up the bulk of the Smiths' catalogue, this album is definitely worth having for anyone who doesn't hate the band.<br />This album is better because the songs were recorded during different sessions and the production sounds 'grittier' and less doctored (think Steve Albini producing PJ Harvey or Nirvana).  The HOH versions sound like rock songs, whereas the LTB versions sound like pop-rock.  The most obvious example is &quot;These Things Take Time&quot; - the LTB version sounds like a watered-down radio single, but the HOH version really kicks, especially with Mike Joyce's skillful and rocking drum style and Andy Rourke not being swallowed by the voice and guitar as they usually are.  The version of &quot;What Difference Does It Make?&quot; is also much better on this album.  You can practically picture these guys rocking out in some Manchester garage, it's pretty cool!  As another reviewer commented, listeing to this album on vinyl is probably the ultimate Smiths experience.<br />Besides Morrissey's witty lyrics and Marr's obvious talent and skill, it's usually overlooked that the Smiths had a fantastic drummer and bass player as well.  It's too bad more Smiths albums weren't done in this style.
0517548232|5.0|I've been interested in economics for years... I even bought a brand new economics textbook once to try to figure it out, but that was hard sledding.  I discovered an ancient (printed in 1962 and it was already a classic then) - copy of this book at a by-donation book sale, so I plonked down my 50 cents and took it home.  What a great book!  I'm pleasantly surprised to see it is still in print - it deserves to be.  If you are interested in economics, by all means, start right here!!  Incredibly succinct and well written presentations of concepts that are much maligned and misunderstood by wanna-be socialist &quot;economics experts&quot; every day, especially up here in Canada.  <br />I would concur that there might be some counter arguments to some of this material, but EVERYONE should at least understand the basic arguments for neo-classical economics and against socialist intervention in the economy before they embrace left-wing views, and nowhere is &quot;right-wing&quot; economic theory more passionately (and humanely) presented and defended than here.
B00003CXAE|5.0|The movie Grease is one of those movies that take everything you would want for senior year and put it one movie. You start with summer, finding that special someone and not wanting to leave unless it's with that person. School in the fall brings all the things you've been hoping for (Ex:\\"We're gonna rule the school\\") and make it exciting. The time frame for the movie is perfect, nothing bad, it was a time that everyone got along and had fun, fashion took a huge step for the \\"Pink Ladies\\" with poodle skirts, and vintage clothes. The time was original, it brought the classic memories in the race under the bridge as Danny raced with scar face. Then in the end, the cards were put on the table that the group of friends really truly were friends forever.I highly recommend this movie, this is a definite movie to cozy up to when it's cold!!
B000002HGD|2.0|Dear Reviewers:<br />Please don't call this album techno; this is not techno.  Call it electronica, call it top 40, call it dance music, but please not techno.  If you want to write about techno, review something by Jeff Mills, Plastikman, Joey Beltram or Frankie Bones at least.  Though this commercial dance music album borrows heavily from many generes, it fails to represent any of them decently, as it usually happens with market-driven music.
B00005Y23E|5.0|Bob Marley's Legend compilation is among the biggest selling greatest hits albums of all time.  The album cuts across all musical genres as rock fans, hip hop fans, r&amp;b fans as well as reggae fans count it as part of their collection.  The original set is augmented by a second disk of remixes and even if you are one of the multitudes who already own Legend, the second disk is worth the purchase as well as the remixing of the first disk which provides a superior sound to the original.
B00005Y1TL|4.0|Selected Ambient Works '85-'92, while extremely raw and scattershot, provides enough glimpses into the James's musical genius that it is well worth the investement. The first three tracks are particularly mesmerizing, especially considering the fact that they were recorded in this guy's basement when he was something like 12 years old. The newer albums (Richard D. James, Druqks, ect) show James firing on all cylinders, able to incorporate a number of styles into single LP's, but this is the album that got the whole thing rolling. James takes a number of chances artistically, yet exerts a considerable amount of restraint and discipline in his recordings. A harebringer of things to come...check it out.
B00005Y1Y3|4.0|Since Jim Morrison's demise in 1971, the band has been subject to countless compilations, live albums and greatest hits packages.  What distinguishes this release from the others is that it is on a label the remaining three band members have formed.  The performances on the album are very strong and a song like &quot;Break On Through&quot; shows off the hyperkinetic energy the band possessed.  The band could jam with the best of them and extended versions of &quot;Light My Fire&quot;, the ubiquitous &quot;The End&quot;, &quot;Five To One&quot; and &quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot; show off their prowess.  Bright Midnight is a solid collection and any fan of the band will be satisfied with the performances.
B00000DFSK|5.0|I was thinking of buying this for sometime.  Then I saw their Super Bowl performance (which was 10 times better than what they called a halftime show last year), and I couldn't get &quot;Where the streets have no name&quot; out of my head.  So I finally went and got this, and it was money well spent.  My favorites are &quot;Streets&quot; and &quot;Still haven't found&quot;.  For me, U2 is one of the few bands that can rock without a distorted guitar.  Maybe I'll go get the actual albums somewhere down the road, but this will do for now.
6304145217|4.0|OK, it's a campy, strange vision of Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET.  And yes, there are scenes and lines missing from the original play (what happens to Paris at the end??).  However, the beautiful  setting and the wonderful acting of the two lead roles (especially the beautiful Olivia Hussey) make this worth seeing.  It's not as jazzy as the new version with Leo and Clair, but it is still a classic version of a classic play.
0767802470|4.0|The sound effects in general are superb, but the spoken German is often inaudible.  The filmakers in 1980 may have actually desired the naturlistic effect of submerging the actors' lines in the rush of environmental noise.  \\"McCabe and Mrs. Miller\\" strains your ears nearly as badly.  I admit that today's fashion in hyper-recording of dialogue is artificial and anoying in the extreme--microphones seemingly placed back in the actors' throats to catch every whisper.  How minimal can language get?  Anyway, I don't care for either affectation of style--extreme miking or inadequate miking.  By the way, the name of the sound engineer is \\"Mike Le-Mare\\".  Great for a sea movie, huh?<br />In other respects, Das Boot gets maximum stars.  Like a submarine below the surface, it is a subversive weapon against Hollywood version of WWII.  Das Boot constantly understates its effects.  I doubt U.S. audiences could swollow a more explicit version of the Das Boot story, even after the Vietnam War.  Das Boot is a German story, not a U.S. story, and the mere fact that it exists so compellingly undercuts Hollywood's triumphant versions of the WWII. You could draw a nice contrast between the way Das Boot and Saving Private Ryan handle the theme \\"cowardice within the ranks.\\"  In Das Boot, cowardice is just bad \\"nerves,\\" whereas in Saving Private Ryan, it's a despicable and inexcusable moral failing. Contrast the way the two films depict \\"the enemy.\\" Also, how they celebrate their heroes.  Das Boot is a far better film.
0679437223|5.0|I still love reading this book, even 30 years after I first found it. There is no better indictment of the military-industrial complex, but of course the story works on numerous levels. It is as timely now as it has ever been. Perhaps even more so. And the writing? Well, take for instance: \\"Major Major had been born too late and too mediocre. Some men are born mediocre, some men achieve mediocrity, and some men have medioricty thrust up them. With Major Major it had been all three. Even among men lacking all distinction he inevitably stood out as a man lacking more distinction than all the rest, and people who met him were always impressed by how unimpressive he was.\\" <br />Read. Enjoy.
B000002HMH|1.0|Oh man, what...happened? How can a band considered to be the Metal Gods of the Golden Age of Heavy Metal come up with a LOAD...like this? I finally listened to the entire album; twice! I wish I hadn't. A complete disapointment if you like heavy metal. If I could I would give it a NEGATIVE 10. Thank God for Slayer's new \\"God Hates Us All\\" cd. Unlike James and Lars, Tom and Kerry are two decent respectable people that give heavy metal a good name.
080013558X|5.0|Now this is the movie that every little girl needs to see!  It shows that even little girls can survive in a big adult world.  I wanted to be Annie so much, I owned all the dolls, the record soundtrack (yes we had only vinyl back then), the Annie record player, and even made my mom watch the movie for ours on end.  Now I still have all my dolls, own the CD soundtrack and can tell you verbatim the entire movie script! hahaha  It's a confidence boosting movie for any little girl, especially ones like me who are going through a tough time at that age.  If you see this movie before or even after Disney's butchering version of the play you will agree this is a much better adaptation.  The characters are more believable and Carol Burnette is a riot.  It's a must see for those young and young at heart!
B000002B7M|5.0|Been listening to this cd for over 10 years; haven't had a suicidal thought yet! To the contrary, this album is not about death, it's about living. This was Ozzy's first solo CD and possibly his best. He gives us such inspirational lyrics as \\"maybe it's not to late- to learn how to love and forget how to hate.\\" This is the true classic that  has become an indispensable item for fans around the world.
B00004ZB9D|4.0|From Lenny's first CD, &quot;Let Love Rule&quot;, I have been a huge fan of his music.  His sound, which is vaguely reminiscent of the Beatles in some songs, makes me feel...and in short that is what music is supposed to be about....garnering some sort of &quot;feeling&quot; from those who listen to it, whether  the feeling be sadness or anger, or nostalgia.  It is NOT mindless pop, but inspiring heartfelt songs, that could easily be about his personal trials and tribulations.  This compilation is mostly a greatest hits gig, but the 2 new tracks (I think there are only 2) are good too.  If you only have one Lenny Kravitz cd in your collection, this should be the one, as it spans his career in the most beautiful way.
B000009QPE|5.0|Rising from the depths of hell, Slayer broke free with an unmistakable gruesome sound that would inspire countless countless other bands for years to come! While every song on this  cd will eagerly lunge at your throat, \\"Angel of Death\\" and \\"Rainning Blood\\" are main songs that blazed a bloody trail across  the music scene and undenniably set the new standard for hardcore death metal. If you are sick and tired of the new metal, then let Slayer take back to the golden age of metal.
B00005Y228|5.0|OK, I'm a little biased as a Kylie fan since The Locomotion.  Who doesn't love the catchy Can't Get You Out Of My Head?  Great tune, but it isn't even the best one.  The title track, Fever, is a standout and could also be a smash.  It looks like the powers that be will release In Your Eyes next (as they did in Europe and Australia) and it's equally strong.  I also love the track Love Affair.  The two bonus tracks are nothing to sneeze at (Boy and Butterfly).  Butterfly was on the CD Light Years and is great, but it won't be on this CD long!  The last four releases from Kylie have been great, but this is the first one released in the US since Enjoy Yourself back in the 80s.  Just add it to your basket and checkout, you're wasting your time when the CD could be on the way to your house!
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica set the new standard back in the 80's with this aggressive ensemble of  melody and furry.  Every single beat of the drum, every single stroke of the guitar is played with frightening precision at mind bogling speeds. If you like &quot;Load&quot; or Reload&quot; then DON&quot;T buy this CD. It came from a Metallica who truelly earned their name and who did not care about MTV, awards, or mainstream; it came from a Metallica  who was only concerned with the injustice in the world.
B00005Y228|5.0|I just bought this cd today, and let me tell you, it is fantastic! Unlike most cd's that you buy, this one has <BR>more than 1 or 2 good songs.  I bought the cd because I<BR>had heard (and liked) &quot;Can't get you out of my head&quot;, but<BR>there are tracks on this cd that are even better! My <BR>favorites are &quot;more more more&quot; (Perfect for a sunny <BR>summer day if you want to listen to a smooth, funky <BR>dance song, and &quot;love at first sight&quot; (Great beats, <BR>full of energy).  But really, all the tracks are good. <BR>And the hidden track (#14) &quot;Butterfly&quot; is very good. <BR>Easily the best pop cd I've bought in a LONG time! I <BR>highly recommend this cd!
B000002HRE|1.0|A complete RE-LOAD of (...). Obviously too concerned with MTV, awards, and mainstream America.  Too slow, too weak, too calm.  Reload is simply horrible. Who where their musical influences for this album anyway? The \\"New Kids on the Block?\\" Cliff Burton must be rolling over in his grave.<BR>I give this cd a NEGATIVE 10.
0553473050|1.0|When I finished this story I was like that's it?! Where was the plot, and the conflict?! The only thing I would call a twist in the story was that it had absolutely no twists! Almost everything in the story seemed to be completely irrelevant to everything else. ...
B00005Y228|4.0|I became a huge Kylie Minogue fan last year.  Her 2000 album, &quot;Light Years&quot;, blew me away.  It was the perfect blend of dance pop and disco, and quickly became one of my favorite CDs in my collection.  Kylie hasn't had a hit in the U.S. for a very long time, and, with the release of &quot;Can't Get You Out Of My Head&quot;, she has re-established herself and snuck past the velvet rope of America.<br />I was very much looking forward to the release of &quot;Fever&quot;.  I wasn't disappointed by any means, but the album is a small step down from &quot;Light Years&quot;.  &quot;Fever&quot; is very similar to &quot;Light Years&quot; in the dance pop and disco sense, but the material is less substantial.  Don't get me wrong, because the album is still a blast.  The best tracks it's got going for it are &quot;Can't Get You Out Of My Head&quot;, the title track, &quot;Give It To Me&quot;, &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, and &quot;Burning Up&quot;.<br />A very good CD for dance pop and disco fans alike!  Kylie Minogue is spectacular!!
B00003CXI1|5.0|I had not read Harry Potter until my husband and I took our 8 year old daugther to see the movie. Seeing the movie made me want to read the book. I can't wait for the release of the next Harry Potter movies!
0671024256|4.0|I have been a fan of Stephen King for years, and have often wondered how he lived, and how he came up with his stories.  Now I know.  It was interesting to learn that his stories do not begin with a plot, rather, with a situation or a scene that evolves into a plot.  I'm sure he is as mystified as to how the story will end when he is writing it as we are when reading it.<br />His relationship with his wife and family reassured me that he is not as wacky as his characters - he may object to that - but it seems that his writing stems from an acute interest in the obtuse, while he enjoys a sort of storybook kind of happy marriage and family.<br />It was also interesting to read the details of the tragic accident that nearly killed him.  I had read about it in news stories, but never had read it in his own words.<br />Although I do not aspire to write fiction, I found this to be a page-turner, and recommend it to all of his fans, and to aspiring writers.
B00004U8PA|5.0|Well im sure only Rocky fans probably buy this movie and of coarce it's wounderful.

B00005U122|5.0|I've seen this concert in Montreal and let me tell you its one of the best shows I've seen along with The Rolling Stones(Bridges to Babylon), Pink Floyd(Division Bell) and Nine Inch Nails(Downward Spiral).<BR> The first thing that hits you when you start listening to this DVD is the sound quality... Wow! Its lound but soooo clear. The concert itself is the exact same thing I've seen &quot;in the flesh&quot;(haha!). The only thing that bugs me about this concert is: Where's the Radio K.A.O.S. songs?<BR> Menus are easy to follow and the picture quality is awesome! 170 minutes of pure pleasure...!

630179513X|4.0|Marty ends his adventures, as everybody knows, in this the Western installment of the Back to the future trilogy. From the Giant ice cube machine to the catchy ho-down dance music from ZZ Top, this is the most light hearted in the series. In all of the Back to the Future films, there is are things that happen that we expect. Such as, \\"Mom, I had a terrible nightmare,\\" and Biff getting coated in Manuer. Thats all in the fun, and we never get tired of it. In fact, after the Star Wars and Indiana Jones series this probably falls under the most loved series ever produced.<br />The only problem may have been the lack of the usual frenzy generated during several trips back and forth between past and future. I didn't mind it in the least. It was kind of nice to see Marty settle down into an adventure in which thing's stay put. Marty must save Doctor Brown. Sounds simple enough, until both a broken delorean (that I have seen in person) and Doc's heart condition causes problems...he's fallen in love with a local school teacher. Ignoring the endless theories of time and space, he follows his heart to an ending that may catch you off guard.<br />Biff can't get much nastier. The suspense couldn't get much better. We say goodbye to Marty, but are his adventures really over? ~S.A.O.S.~
B00005Y228|5.0|I've been waiting a long time for Kylie Minogue to comeback.  I really thought Light Years would be her comeback disc but it didn't except for the club success of Butterfly.  So when Can't Get You Outta My Head hit number 1 in the UK, I wasn't expecting much from here on this side of the Atlantic. It's funny to think how someone who really isn't absolutely drop dead gorgeous (but I'm not saying she's hot cause she is) can still be around in her 30s and still be able to handle such a status as one of the world's biggest sex symbols as she has for the past decade.<br />But incredibly after 14 long years, she's back and she doesn't change a thing from her cd except for the inclusion of Butterfly and Boy.<br />The CD stays upbeat and fast throughout the entire thing.  You won't find any sloppy ballad ..., just good dance beats.  Of course stands outs include In Your Eyes, her recent #3 debut and followup to Can't Get You Outta My Head.  Also good are Your Love and Give It To Me, which sounded like something Basement Jaxx woulda come up with.<br />I will be really dissapointed if Kylie just comes and goes after Can't get you outta my head but i highly doubt it with how this album is.<br />After flops such as STREET FIGHTER and her attempt to be alternative, its great to see her back at where she started, good pop music.
0451527712|4.0|Frankenstein is a very well presented view of how society did, and still does, view the unusual and different. Mary Shelley did an excellent job portraying the monster, and an even better job showing his human emotions and compassion. At first, you are led to believe that the creature is an abomination in the name of human kind, but quickly realize that he did not ask to be created, and that he is nothing more than what his creator's hands molded. This is also a look into the subject of human beings \\"playing god\\", and offers many viewpoints that might otherwise be overlooked. Furthermore, it can be incorporated with modern subjects, where everything is not \\"black and white\\", but where there is a \\"gray\\" uncertain area (cloning, etc.). A must read for anyone who enjoys drama, especially those readers with ethical questions in a modern chaotic world.
B00000099Y|4.0|Despite the penchant for most Tool fans to say that all four cd's are the best things man has ever created, I must disagree.  Tool is a great band and most of their work is great, but this particular cd just seems to have too much filler.  I understand that they are being creative, in the vein of Pink Floyd, but after Undertow you have the expectation of more from Maynard and crew.  But don't let this prevent you from getting this cd.  For one, the packaging is awesome and some of Tool's best work is on this album.  Luckily though, the guys got it right on Lateralus, so way to improve.  And BUY THIS CD!!!!!!!!!!!
B00000AF98|5.0|The opening title track is one of KISS's declaratory anthems that not only is about them but on life in general.  Paul Stanley is giving a directly thanks you to the fans and to the listener when he sings \\"You are my people/you are my crowd/This is our music/We love it loud.\\"  Right between the eyes, oops, that was from another album.  Other inspiring lyrics include \\"If life is a radio, turn up to ten.\\" and \\"Yeah, and nobody's gonna change me/'cause that's who I am.\\"  Why this didn't make it on the Smashes, Thrashes & Hits I have no idea, but this song alone is worth buying the album.<br />Normally, in a group sporting more than one lead vocalist, I need a good mix, but with \\"Bang Bang You,\\" which is the third song in a row from Paul, following the hurricane that was \\"I'll Fight Hell To Hold You,\\" it's reasonable.  \\"Bang Bang You\\" incorporates the title words from an earlier album:  \\"I'll shoot you down with my love gun, baby.\\"<br />The relentless \\"No, No, No\\" is Gene's first song on the album and he gets plenty of support from Bruce and Eric.  It almost makes me forget about Gene.  Comparing his vocals here and Hot In The Shade makes me wonder if something happened inbetween these two albums.  His voice is fine here and on the other songs he does.<br />\\"My Way\\" is another valuable gem of a KISS anthem, with an inspirational synthesizer accompanying Paul.  Basically it's about doing things one's way and to heck with everyone else.  Examples:  \\"It's tough to be strong in a world that makes you crawl... I'm never gonna give up in the fight,\\" \\"I'm never gonna run, I'm never gonna tell myself a lie/'Cause after it's all said and done, I've got the right to decide.\\"  And the message is there to see from the chorus:  \\"I'm gonna talk like I talk, walk like I walk, my way/I'm gonna go where I go, ain't taking no, my way/And if you don't play my game, I won't play/I'm gonna do it my way.\\"  Tell'em, Paul!  The same music style can be found on the equally vibrant \\"Turn On The Night,\\" also sung by Paul.<br />\\"Reason To Live,\\" which follows the crunchfest of \\"When Your Walls Come Down,\\" ranks as one of the best power ballads of all time.  Again, why wasn't this included on Smashes, Thrashes, Hits?<br />\\"Thief In The Night,\\" which closes the album, is a slow rocker, and was covered by Wendy O'Williams on her W.O.W. album.<br /> Ron Nevison, who resurrected the careers of Heart and Ozzy Osbourne, produced Crazy Nights, puzzling as Animalize and Asylum were very popular KISS albums.  Oh well, maybe he figured he was on a roll.  I have to admit that Gene is my favorite KISS singer, but on this album, Paul wins hands down--he's incomparable here.  This is a different sound for KISS, but I attribute that to Ron Nevison's production.  (Compare his work on Heart and Bad Animals to their early 1980's stuff) Then there's Bruce Kulick's guitars, which don't sound the same on Asylum.  Eric Carr's drumming is more pronounced than ever.  Next stop, the sphinx and Hot In The Shade.Night,\\" also sung by Paul.<br />\\"Reason To Live,\\" which follows the crunchfest of \\"When Your Walls Come Down,\\" ranks as one of the best power ballads of all time.

Even though the live set may not differ much from the studio sets some time save for some screams and such, the album is very enjoyable.<BR><br /><BR> Some classic songs like The Sweetest Taboo, Cherish The Day and No Ordinary Love are hiven a whole new treatment making them as relevant as they were years ago. The woman shines with so much soul and enthuasism, with no hint of pretense, unlike many commercial divas. The songs bring in into the ambience where u would be slow dancing yourself.<BR><br /><BR> The downside: a single disc can fit only 80min of music and the 13-song tracklist here is not enuff. You want more and the next good place is the DVD or video where you'll get all the excellent visuals as well.<BR><br /><BR>The way to go, but I'm afraid the next studio album will only come in another few more years. But it should be all worthwhile.<BR>
B00005ARDC|3.0|There is a lot of hype going on here. Yes BRMC are good. Get a few mp3s before buying the album. Or better yet buy the Trail Of Dead CD when it comes out next week.
B00000IL67|1.0|As an Alice Cooper fan for over 25 years, I regarded this box set as a missed opportunity bordering on tragedy. The rarely-heard first two psychedelic albums are bypassed almost entirely, and classic tracks such as \\"Hallowed Be My Name,\\" \\"Second Coming,\\" \\"Halo of Flies,\\" \\"Luney Tune,\\" \\"My Stars,\\" \\"Cold Turk,\\" and \\"Sick Things\\" from the classic LOVE IT TO DEATH, KILLER, and SCHOOL'S OUT, BILLION DOLLAR BABIES period are bypassed in favor of embarrassing '80s and '90s power ballads, presumably because Alice was in a position to negotiate for higher reissue royalties later in his career.  Curiously, the liner notes single out \\"Luney Tune\\" and \\"My Stars\\" for praise, but you won't find them here. The fact that the remastered sound on LIFE AND CRIMES is so superior to that of WEA's LOVE IT TO DEATH, KILLER, and SCHOOL'S OUT CDs makes the sparce pickings from these albums that much more lamentable.
B00000HZFP|5.0|Hedwig's emotional, yet poignant, protrayal of an unfortunate transexual comes through vibrantly in the soundtrack of this movie.  From start to finish, one gets to ride the rollercoaster of Hedwig's life and, in the journey, learn everlasting lessons about self-realization, regret, and the power of nostalgic synthetic wigs, styled in the vain of \\"Farrah Fawcett from TV.\\"  My favorite song, track #2, depicts Hedwig's belief of the \\"Origin of Love,\\" an amazing song that perfectedly combines Hedwig's rock and roll energy with the tenderness and determination of a soul ill-at-ease but one who's ready to reach for the truth.  That song's immediately followed by the angst-driven, vengeful \\"Angry Inch\\" about her experience with the now-famous botched surgery.  There's so much sarcasm present in this song that it's hard not to feel bad laughing at such a tragedy.  But Hedwig pulls it off with great fanfare and doesn't make us feel bad for her, as she regains her energy, whipping out a stunning, Billy Joel-esque rock tune -- with catchy melody and all -- in \\"Wig in a Box,\\" that typifies what happens when someone says, \\"enough is enough.\\"  You can't help but bounce your head side-to-side, while singing along with your friends in your car, without fear of sounding ....  In an instant, she transforms from \\"midwest midnight check out girl\\" to \\"punk rock superstar\\" with a variety of fantastic costumes to match.  And, finally, the CD ends with one of the strongest ballads, that will, unfortunately, never make it to the radio, named \\"Midnight Radio,\\" with one of the best melodies I've heard in a long time.  The songwriters and producers need to be commended with their work and John Cameron Mitchell deserves a Grammy nomination, at the least, if not the award itself, for his displaying his talent on this soundtrack.
B00005RYQO|5.0|WOW, i thought that this film was good, amazing. Great cast, amazing cars, an excellent night in, loved watching it, had me on the edge of my seat right up to the end, wanted it to go on forever. i would recommend it to anyone. I rented it and watched it 3 times over a  weekend, now going to buy it. GET THIS FILM AND YOU WON'T BE DISAPOINTED.
0790729628|5.0|One has to remember how sci-fi movies were made and ambiented, their colours and the stories canned in them, before this one, in order to understand the importance and historical impact of the masterpiece by Ridley Scott. This is a movie to be seen by all, including those not really into sci-fi. No serious pictures about the future of mankind made after this one, can escape the influence of the dark city portraited in Blade Runner. Not only some very original effects for the time, but also the mood that Vangelis provokes through his musical score, set the rigth place and time to unfold a moving tale about human and nonhuman misery and redemption. This is a place and time were humans kill replicants that were created by them to serve, but not to live on earth or live in full.  Replicants that are not supposed to feel, love or despair. But they do, and how.<BR>I can hardly think of a more stirring and moving scene in a picture, than the one in which the last standing \\"bad\\" replicant (portraited by Hauer)does not do what humans thinks a replicant would do (kill Harrison, the hunter that has just liquidated his beloved one) but instead teaches us all a lesson about the value of life and compassion. If the final speech<BR>that he makes doesn't represent poetry in motion to you, then maybe you didn't deserve to see this wonderful art act.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I totally and completely loved this movie.  The special effects and acting were phenomenal.  I really liked the fact that it stuck so close to the book.  The only part that I was even remotely dissappointed in was the fact that the movie didn't show that the stone was being protected by a spell from each teacher (including Snape).  Since I saw the movie before I read the book, imagine my suprise to find that there were one or two more obstacles for Harry, Hermione and Ron to get through.  All in all though it was a tremendous movie and I would (and have) recommend it anyone and everyone to see at least once.
B00005Y228|5.0|Kylie has been tearing up the charts all around the globe for 14 years, has 34 top ten hits in the UK, peformed at the closing ceremony at the last Winter Olypmics, and has sold over 30 million albums worldwide (without the help of the US, mind you).  She's finally getting her due here in the States... and THANK GOD!  The production on this album is pristine with songs ranging from old-style disco to retro-80's super-pop to cutting edge dance tunes akin to Daft Punk and Basement Jaxx.  Her voice, a fine-tuned instrument in and of itself, wraps itself around each melody with velvety precision.  The number one world-wide smash, &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot; is a prime example of what this album holds in store for its listeners.  Other stand out tracks are the naughty disco-tastic &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, the Ibiza flavored summer tune &quot;Love at First Sight&quot;, and the ultra-cool &quot;Fever&quot; and &quot;Give it to Me&quot; which pay some serious homage to the music of the where-are-they-now girls of the 80's (i.e. a certain plucky Laker Girl named Paula).  With such a stagnant pop-scene and a less than happy past year, this album is truly the thing to spice things up a bit.  Let's hope we can give Kylie reason to stick around in the States for a while...I'm sure she'll make it worth our while.
068817776X|5.0|I finished it in less than two days, unwilling to lay it down.<br />Another similar book which I would recommend to anyone who liked this one is \\"When I Was a German, 1934-1945 : An Englishwoman in Nazi Germany,\\" by Christabel Bielenberg. (check it out here on Amazon).<br />I agree with other reviewers' praise of THE NAZI OFFICER'S WIFE and would mention one other thing about it which struck me.  Edith Hahn was in Brandenburg after the war, which was in the Eastern sector.  Here she was able (as a certified non-Nazi) to use her legal training in the court system, and she loved this work.  Why then did she leave for England, where she had to work in menial positions for the rest of her working life?<br />The kicker:  the Russian authorities who controlled the sector, and their Communist underlings, called her in and asked her to work for them by spying on her neighbors and other contacts.  Edith, horrified, says \\"I heard Goebbels' evil laughter in my ears.\\"   She ran away - using the same devious talents she had learned under the Nazis to wangle her way out of Eastern Germany.<br />This book exposes the two great evils of the past century, and we should read about these things in order to - as the saying goes - \\"Never Forget.\\"
B00005QZWI|5.0|I have to say right off that when viewing the film, the score was pretty much overlooked in the grand scale of things. I purchased the disk as an item of memorabilia... and didn't like it the first time I listened to it. Several songs I did like -- just having Enya's final \\"May it Be\\" was worth thirteen bucks. But I didn't care for the monk-like chanting in Latin... until I discovered that it wasn't Latin, it was Quenya, the language of Mordor, and Sinderin... the languages that Tolkien wrote.<br />Thus known, I gave it another chance and really enjoyed it. Now it's one of my favorite soundtracks. The songs are a mixture of different flavors and strains; the Elves are a twinkling, glittering item of music in the forefront of the dark and horrific strains of the Ringwraiths. Perhaps the most compelling piece of the score is The Bridge of Khazad Doom -- when Gandalf battles the Balrog. One doesn't realize how poignant the following half (where they mourn him) is until they're simply listening to the music rather than caught up in the visual epic of the film.<br />I should also note that the cover seen on Amazon may or may not be the cover that you receive. I ordered on a whim and got a gorgeous collage of Arwen, Gandalf, Saruman, and Frodo. Each cover is different; I think there are six in all. Give the score a chance...
0385505833|5.0|After reading the inside cover, I didn't expect this to be Grisham's standard fare - and it wasn't. I found myself having belly laughs on several occasions. John Grisham does know how to spin a great story and he doesn't disappoint here. It was a fun read.

B00005Y1XZ|5.0|So every fan of Elvis Costello has a &quot;best&quot; album because it is so hard to pick just one. Well this is my pick, this years model. My only regret about purchasing this CD is that it didn't have the bonus disc yet. So I may just have to buy another one to have the second disc. At any rate, I think this album really defines Elvis as an artist. It was released in the earlier part of his career, so it rocks and is real revolutionary. C'mon Radio Radio is on it. and if you don't know Radio Radio is probably Elvis' biggest single ever. Quick annecdote about the song and i'm done. Elvis was banned from Saturday Night Live for a long time because on the show he played the first 2 bars of the song, told the audience it was about all of them and they don't even know what it's about and then he busted into a b-side. How cool is this guy?
0060278234|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read! I cannot wait till the next one comes out! :]
0385505833|5.0|When John Grisham sat down to write this book he somehow found his way into my head. I am Luther Krank. The whole implauseable yet believable tale was something I would do in a heartbeat. I sat and read about my idiotic stance based on unyielding principle and laughed out loud. The book brought tears of laughter and I haven't had a book do that in a long time. Those of you who didn't like this book because you wanted a legal thriller do not appreciate this man's wonderful grasp and depth of perception regarding human interaction at so many levels.  I loved this book and would recommend it to anyone who sees the humor only a genuine curmudgeon can display.
B00003CXI1|5.0|That answer may be difficult to answer. All material things have a end, and for Harry Potter I do not see it's end any time soon. I am deeply awaiting the arrival of this DVD because I am a great fan and have been waiting forever to enjoy this movie. It kept faithfull to J.K. Rowling and for that I rate it 5 stars. The production might not have been very good to everyone's eyes, but I held it accounted because the movie was faithfull to the book, if it was made into a 'Hollywood Version' perhaps the production would have been better, but fans everywhere including myself would have left disappointed. So over all I think that the movie was great, gave fans a in depth look at the Magival World of Harry Potter for the many years that we have been dreaming about.

B00005JKOV|5.0|\\"Waking Life\\" is an animated film written and directed by Richard Linklater. It's quite different from the typical commercially-oriented animated film. \\"Waking Life\\" follows the philosophical odyssey of a main character (voiced by Wiley Wiggins) as he engages in a series of conversations and surreal experiences. There are some additional scenes featuring other characters.<br />The very talky script is intriguingly complemented by the striking animation. The scenes constitute a visual poetry that is frequently quite stunning and beautiful; the animation style varies in different scenes, thus giving an additional diversity and appeal to the film. The filmmakers use the animation medium to incorporate some clever \\"special effects\\" into the film.<br />The conversations deal with many topics: the relationship between dreams and reality; human evolution; the nature and funtion of art; identity; transcendence; etc. There are some dark and violent scenes, as well as some very tender and moving moments.<br />Wiley Wiggins gives an outstanding vocal performance as the primary character; he brings a youthful earnestness and likeability to the role. Overall, I found \\"Waking Life\\" to be a truly unique and intriguing film; I highly recommend it to serious filmgoers.
B00005LOUS|4.0|Who says Dr. Seuss is just for the youngsters?

This story is brought to life for the 21st century to enjoy, in ways before unimaginable.<br />This movie is hysterical, prepare to laugh almost non-stop through the movie. This movie is theatrical, and in a way almost romantic. Timeless values of love, peace, and friendship will be tried and acquited of all wrong.<br />Prepare to enjoy your Christmas a little more, and let Jim Carrey get you in the Christmas spirit before its too late!
6305897786|3.0|then this movie really doesn't come up to scratch.  The book ('The Dumas club' by the Spanish author Perrez-Reverte) was an intricate detective story with a couple of killer twists; the movie is, basically, half the book.  If you liked the imagery of the movie then I seriously reccomend you read the book (which is a bit of a cross between Raymond Chandler and Umberto Eco), however if you've read the book, do not see the movie.  It can only let you down!  One of the major problems (apart from the hacking apart of the story) is that Polanski builds up suspense only to ruin it all by showing too much.  Scenes that would have worked really well in the background are played in main view and consequently, we're really given little doubt about what is going on.  However, the atmosphere is nice and Depp is superb.  Probably if you don't expect too much then this is a very nice film, but it's not up to the suspense of Rosemary's baby, as noted in the other reviews
0783217048|3.0|If I remember correctly, this movie spent two weeks at #1 at the US Box offfice, which would indicate that either the moviegoing public found it amusing and/or just plain fun.  The opening sequence is colorful and attention getting, as is the ending.  In between it becomes, a road trip picture, with the 3 Drag queens, getting stuck in some no-name town.  Watching, macho men Swayze &amp; Snipes, &amp; John Lequizamo (Chi Chi Rodriguez?), as drag queens is a blast.  Thank goodness for actors.  They do for this movie, what most movies should do, forget real-life problems and just enjoy yourself, if only for a couple hours.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I bought this CD on a recomendation from a friend in Britain.  I came back to the US and bought the CD and was initially a bit dissapointed.  Blame the hype, I thought.  But no, after I listened a couple more times I realised that this CD is one of those that improve with extra listens.  I'm slightly dissapointed that the excellent 'New York City Cops' was removed from this version - I didn't think the lyrics were that offensive.  I fully reccomend this album to anyone - the music is complex but at the same time simple enough to remain vital and energetic.  Put simply, this is album is musically very close to perfection!
B00005U18E|3.0|I found Bridget Jones' Diary to be very different from what I expected. In the commercials, Bridget Jones is portrayed as a suave young woman in her mid-twenties. However, I realized different when I watched the movie.  Bridget Jones' diary takes place in Britain. The main character, Bridget (played by Renee Zelwigger) tells the audience about her past. We realize that she does not ordinarily have boyfriends, and , when her mother tries to set her up with a man, we find out why. We also realize that Bridget is not suave at all, which she realizes herself that New Year. She finds herself all alone, again, and makes a resolution to start a diary, among other things. Finally after consulting with her friends, she sends a naughty e-mail to her boss, who sends one back to her. After many such e-mails, her boss (played by Hugh Grant) asks her out. Later on, the man Bridget's mother tried to set her up with develops a crush on Bridget. Soon, Bridget is in the center of a love triangle and she must decide which man is Mr. Right. A bit shallow, a lot of flakiness, and not all that exciting.

B00005Q4CS|4.0|'Requiem for a dream' is quite possibly the most disturbing and brilliant films to look at the drug culture; how this culture manifests itself within society, as well as the people involved. The viewer is taken on a journey through a world of money, sex, vacuous relationships and of course drugs.<br />The film centers around four addicts Harry (Jared Leto) his girlfriend Marion (Jeniffer Connelly)his best friend (Marlon Wayans) and his mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn). We see how each of these characters falls into their own personal hell through the use of drugs and the motivation as to why they turned to the easy answer. For the friends it is due to the promise of easy money and get hooked 'trying out' their new gear. For Marion it is due to the relationship she has with Harry that causes her to become an addict. However the film succeeds on the highest level through the character Sara. How she starts using harmless uppers as a way to lose weight, and ends in hell.<br />Cinematically the film is difficult to watch, the cinematography used is disorienting in many cases. This has good purpose however in trying to give the viewer an experience of what someone on drugs experiences. Director Darren Aronofsky used the interesting technique of split screening the action in the film to give us slices of two character's perspective which works brilliantly.<br />People with a weak stomach for gritty, disturbing sex scenes or have qualms about seeing active drug taking (through needles in arms etc.) should not shy away from the film and would perhaps rather to see the rated version, with much of this cut out. <br />The only film the 'Requiem for a dream' can be compared to is the British film 'Trainspotting' but the mood created in 'Requiem'is so disquieting that it makes 'Trainspotting' look like an episode of the 'Tellytubbies'.<br />As far as the DVD goes you can't see this film in any grittier fashion than through the director's cut. The features are great, good interviews and commentary. The picture transfer is crystal clear (4.5 out of 5) and the sound transfer is fabulous in conveying mood (5 out of 5)<br />No 'Requiem' isn't the kind of film you would take your mother to, nor is it one to watch with your friends if you just want to 'hang out and watch a film'. It has no happy ending, no tying of loose ends. And it's refreshing to see. This film has no answers to the problems of drugs, it's meerly an exposee of drugs in society. This film needed to be made and needs to be seen not only by people who are activly part of this drug culture, but also people who don't understand the motivations and vices people are related to through drugs.
B00004Y6TQ|5.0|I heard this album long before I saw the accompanying movie, so I imagined what a lot of the movie would be like.  Surprisingly, my imagination was quite accurate with imagining the &quot;musical&quot; scences of &quot;Cvalda&quot;.  I play in a wind ensemble myself so the album reached out and grabbed me from the first note of &quot;Overture&quot;.  I'm a huge Radiohead fan as well so the duet with Thom Yorke is a pleasure, any fan of both will love to hear Thom and Bjork's voices entwining around each other as they do here.  I think the weakest track is &quot;Scatterheart&quot;...it seems to lack momentum and energy and drags down the middle of the album.  (The version in the movie was far more effective).  &quot;In the Musicals&quot; is as fun as &quot;Cvalda&quot;...it gives way to the bittersweet end, and my favourite, track, &quot;107 Steps&quot;.  This short piece is the most emotional, it packs a punch especially if you see the movie.  Without seeing the movie, you'd never know what it was about.  When I listen to it on my own, it always makes me feel the same overwhelming sadness I feel when I watch old war movies from the 40's, or movies about that era.  Indeed,the entire album is very &quot;retro&quot; in how it borrows from the musical style.<BR>The last track, &quot;New World&quot;, will mislead you if you haven't seen the movie.  If you know it before you see the movie, prepare never to be able to listen to it the same way again.  But you'll want to.  This CD is essential listening for anyone with eclectic taste, and I recommend it especially if your favourite Bjork CD is Homogenic.

B00005NTJK|4.0|Benefit marks the third and the last album of the early formative period of  Jethro Tull. (The collection Living in the Past, released a couple of years later,  is also from this period.) While the band's music has continually changed  during this period, Benefit feels more a leap-forward than a gradual evolution.  Much of the album sounds startlingly modern and experimental (particularly, Time For Everything, Play in Time) and must have sounded more so at the time of its release.  The music is intricate and multi-layered, and yet somehow natural and organic,  a feat that is well demonstrated in the opening song, With You There to Help Me. The crescendo of flute, keys, guitars (both acoustic and electric) and vocals is so carefully crafted, that one marvels at the cohesiveness of the piece. Yet, there is nothing gratuitous about it, with every note seeming to serve some  higher aesthetic purpose. The use of instrumentation to convey texture and meaning to the song is indeed a novel aspect of the album. For instance, the introduction of the electric guitar in the otherwise acoustic Alive And Well and Living In provides a gritty feel to the song and serves to awaken the listener to the true import of the lyrics. But, the real revelation is Ian's voice and vocalizations. At times, stentorian and impassioned (Son, Nothing To Say) and, at times, tender and caring (Inside, For Michael Collins, Sossity), he bravely soars over the instrumentation and takes melodic centre stage. His lyrical themes do not depart significantly from previous material and, typically, focus on personal issues of life and love; however, the lyrics are more poetic and hint at the kind of imagery that Ian will turn to more in future work. <br />Benefit may lack the kind of individual masterpieces (except, perhaps, To Cry You a Song, which I don't much care for) that find everlasting life in &quot;greatest-of&quot; compilations or in live sets, but don't let this mislead you. This is THE album whereJethro Tull and Ian Anderson find their niche. Listen to it carefully, and you will see why Aqualung, Thick as a Brick and Passion Play had to happen.
B00004XONN|3.0|Kid A could be considered a real step down from OK Computer.  The songwriting has suffered a bit due to the electronic interplay.  This album seems to focus more on interesting atmospheres and textures more than individual songs.  Some may feel this is a positive thing and just the artistic statement that Radiohead was trying to make.  Me, i think they should focus more on their songwriting.  Radiohead is still one of the greatest bands in the world but they should put more effort into individual songs instead of just weirding us out.
B00005Y228|5.0|I was just a lad when Kylie first burst on the scene in the early 80's but being much older now and able to appreciate her new sexy image even more, this album is a real treat.  I have to say that, like Madonna, Kylie has made the transitio from pop princess to electronica goddes.  While this album isn't quite at the guilty pleasure level of \\"Light Years\\" (Why that isn't readily available in stores, I've no clue...I felt that one had more crossover appeal) it's still a worthwhile venture into Kylie-land.  It's just hard to believe that she is SO HUGE in England and we rarely hear anything about her here.  I'm crossing my fingers for a US Tour!
0812550706|5.0|I have not read this book, but my 15 - year old son has.  What is remarkable about this?  My son HATES to read!  This is the first book he has ever voluntarily read, and he is now reading others in the series.  In my opinion, this is nothing short of a miracle.  he is not only reading these books, he is devouring them!  I caught him reading Ender's Shadow at 2:30 a.m. this morning.  Always in the past when I caught him  staying up till the early hours of the morning, it was because he was playing computer games.  So, any parents of teenage sons who you despair of ever getting to read anything but comic books, I highly reccomend you try them on the &quot;Ender&quot; series.
0790729725|2.0|5 stars for the movie itself... But this DVD version get's 2 stars because I have two major gripes concerning the DVD production! <br />First... Single layer means you have to flip the disc, which is REALLY inexcusable these days in DVD production! Would've been nice if they disclosed the layer type on the packaging! I wouldn't have dropped $(...) for this archaicly produced version had I known that! I mean this is WB here folks! Even Anchor Bay finally got up to production speed as far as layering is concerned! If I wanted to flip sides to a movie I would've bought a laserdisc player! <br />Second... The sound! The 5.1 audio is lacking! In fact! The most underused 5.1 mix I've ever heard on a DVD! Most the movie actually seems to be mostly in mono with surround audio used scarcely! <br />This DVD would've gotten 1 star. But the picture is very crisp! And it's nice to watch the flick in widescreen even if it's non-anamorphic... Yet another reason for WB to update the version!

You really don't care much about what Lestat is doing.  While all her books flirt with being a little sacrilegious, this one goes to bed with it.  To me it's not so much an entertaining book as maybe one that is dealing with Anne's own questions of religion.  That may be fine with some people, but I just want to read about the vampires, not religious conviction.  It had a typical great beginning that draws you in, but the more I read, the more I got distracted by my own morals and ethics involved with what was happening to Lestat.  I don't need that in my reading world.
B00004Z459|5.0|Anyone who doesn't have this album or are thinking about it, need to get it ASAP!!  It is the best CD I have and I have a lot of CD's.  Linkin Park's lyrics are so deep and mean something.  There are no perverted comments, bad language, or sexual reference.  I recommend Hybrid Theory to anyone who is intrested.  Chester, Mike, Brad, Joe, Pheonix, and Rob keep up the awesome work.  Your the best!
6302798450|5.0|I first watched Army Of Darkness a few months ago on reccomendation from a friend who said to me, \\"Anyone who isn't in the floor the entire time they're watching this has something wrong with them.\\"  The third in the Evil Dead series, this one takes place immediately after Evil Dead II ends.  Whisked away into the year 1300, Ash, the hero of the Evil Dead series, must do battle with the forces of the undead to protect the living, as well as the Necronomicon, or \\"Book of the Dead.\\"  After watching it the first time, I disagreed with my friend's analysis.  But, after watching it a second time, I found it so funny that I was still quoting dialogue several weeks later.  Unlike other horror film spoofs like Scary Movie, which concentrated on jokes concerning a certain part of the male anatomy, Army Of Darkness instead chooses slapstick comedy as the basis for its laughs, as well as a few jabs at classic films like Jason And The Argonauts and The Day The Earth Stood Still.  If you like to laugh and you like the \\"gross factor\\" that a horror film can provide, then look no further than Army Of Darkness.
0380778556|5.0|One of my teachers recommended this book to me; when she had told me about the plot of this story, I fell in love with it immediately. I could feel how mysterious the story would be even by hearing the outline. I have enjoyed reading Rebecca and enjoyed the feeling of love the author gave me. The story is about a shy young woman, after she marries the mysterious Mr. De Winter, lives under the dark shadow of his first wife, Rebecca. She always felt that people are comparing her to the lovely woman, Rebecca; even her servants did not treat her very kindly. As the story moves on, Mrs. De Winter begins to recognize Rebecca&iexcl;¦s personality more and more. Throughout the whole story, I always had a mysterious feeling about &iexcl;§Who is Rebecca?&iexcl;¨ when I was reading through, I really wanted to know more about this great woman. I was truly surprised with the ending, I could never have guess this romance story would end like this. I highly recommend this book to everyone and wish they all will have the same excited feeling as I do.
B00004R99U|3.0|I do not dislike this movie. It could have been put together better. The songs were ok as well. The first song was the best and that was it... I think it is just an OK MOVIE AND COULD HAVE BEEN PUT TOGETHER WAY BETTER! THANX!
0316776963|2.0|The sales of this book are impressive. That is one criterion of book success. And considering the lugubrious books on various best seller lists, some comic relief might be in order. Does it make this reviewer laugh? Parts of it he finds amusing. Other parts,- to take the name of the Lord and to mix it with the vain language of the current time is a part of the book that was not amusing.
B00000099Y|5.0|If you have decided, after hearing Lateralus, that Tool isn't a band you would really want to listen to, you should hear this first. Maynard Keenan is, without a doubt, one of the most talented and versatile singers in the music industry today.  In very short, Maynard is amazing, Tool is probably the most talented and innovative band out there, and Aenima is their masterpiece. i strongly urge you to buy it, i did, and it hasn't come out of my cd player for 8 months now.
B00004T0PZ|5.0|It fits, too. Unease. Dissonance. Not very light. Dangerous. Occasionally grating. Hints of beauty that you have to work for. Pay attention to what's going on; see the grandeur and the gorgeousness under the surface. Ultimately, it's all worth it. It's a commentary ahead of its time. Reason enough to listen. Please do.
0880389052|5.0|Drizzit, the most beloved hero of the Forgotten Realms, has his beginnings fully detailed here.  On the day of House Do'Urden's greatest victory to date, Matron Malice has decided to sacrifice her 3rd child to the Spider Queen Lloth in accordance to her laws. The child, Drizzit, is miraculously saved right before the dagger fell (literally) when it is discovered that the family's first child was killed on the battlefield (in actuallity, killed by the 2nd child, but this is generaly overlooked in drow society) so it was decided that Drizzit was to be spared  to take his future place as the family's new 2nd child.  As Drizzit grows up among a vicious society that praises deceit and back-stabbing he shows his displeasure, quite vocally, about the accepted drow ways. Zaknafein, Drizzit's biological father (unbeknownst to Drizzit), trains his son in the fighting arts and encourages his rebellion against the evils of drow society.<BR>This book should be considered a masterpiece in its own right, it marvelously explores the life of a youth that rebels against a society that he knows is corrupt. Highly recommended, even if you aren't normally read fantasy novels.
B000002UAO|5.0|This quietly moving, mature song cycle is simply unimaginable without the sterling guitar work of George Harrison. For longtime fans, the UK version is the only version to own since it presents the LP in the proper running order and sequence and features two of Harrison's best songs, the perfect jangle-pop of &quot;If I Needed Someone&quot; and the fuzz-bass laced &quot;Think For Yourself&quot;.  True genius and creativity were starting to flower from this young bloke and we're all the better for his gifts.<br />Rest In Peace George and HAPPY 59TH BIRTHDAY. I miss you more than words can express.
B00005UKKF|5.0|I am really blown away by Britney Spears.  And THIS DVD from her live concert in Las Vegas really explodes.  The directing is fantastic. They seemed to really have fun with the cameras, lights and sound.  When I watch the concert, I feel like I'm part of the experience and I always see new stuff.  And Britney is really an icon for all generations!  She is sincere, sexy and an amazing performer.  Paired with the great director Marty Callner, the two deliver an unbelievable concert.
B00005LMWI|5.0|Kamelot is a band that has grown on me the past few years.  When I first heard their last cd, I was not blown away.  However, upon subsequent listenings, I started to hear that they really are one of the better bands around.  They have an exquisite refined sound that really shines through on this cd.  They don't shred or play really intricate time signatures yet you can tell they are all very talented musicians.  Their music is not easy by any stretch of the imagination, but they are also not quite as crazy as Dream Theater or Symphony X.  Khan is a great singer and Thomas Youngblood has some really great, tasteful leads to complement some solid rhythm work.  The other musicians are quite good too, especially keyboard whiz Miro.  Standout cuts are Wings of Despair, the three part Duchess of Blood tracks, and the Highland song.
B00004XQ83|5.0|For far too long Nashville has been selling its sold out to the highest bidder, saturating the airwaves with pop princesses like Faith Hill and hacks like hubby Tim McGraw.  This soundtrack to the admittedly so-so movie \\"O Brother Where Art Thou\\" is the best medicine against this trend and the fact that it has sold over 4 million copies to date (and counting) has got Nashville scared out of its wits.  This is the type of music, real, genuine, and full of excitement and passion, that they have been trying desperately to kill off for years.  Stick it to Nashville and buy this TODAY!
0790751216|4.0|Made years prior to his classic Unforgiven, Pale Rider offers positive proof that no other contemporary filmmaker understands the mythic texture and rhythm of the American Western better than actor/director Clint Eastwood.  Combining elements from Shane and High Plains Drifter, Pale Rider tells the tale of a mysterious gunslinging preacher that comes to the aid of embattled settlers in the Pacific Northwest.  While the film does have its weakness, namely too closely resembling superior films, it has its strengths as well, mainly invoking the laconic, rugged individualism that is the hallmark of all great westerns, some rousing actions scenes, and well drawn characters and situations.  The religious underpinnings are also of larger interest thanks in part to the screenwriting of Dennis Shyrack and Michael Butler (who used similiar theological symbolism in their scripts for the Eastwood chase thriller The Gauntlet as well as the B-movie level horror show The Car).
B000021Y77|4.0|&quot;Run Lola Run&quot; is an example of the sort of experimental storytelling you just can't get out of most American studios these days. In a nutshell, Lola (Franka Potente) has 20 minutes to come up with 100,000 marks or her boyfriend will be killed by his mob boss. This film follows three potential outcomes for this situation, and it does it in a smart, entertaining fashion.<br />The only problem I have comes with a lot of the promotional material and the hype -- before I saw this movie, everything I read about it said it was about how &quot;choices&quot; can affect the way your life unfolds. This isn't exactly what the movie is about.<br />While Lola certainly does make different choices in each of the three scenarios presented, the crux, the starting point, NEVER changes -- Lola makes the same FIRST decision and the metaphorical snowballs are sent in three different directions originally because of accidents of timing and fate rather than any choice she makes.<br />Still, this is a highly entertaining film and well worth picking up -- just don't be fooled.
B00003CX9S|5.0|This is a beautiful, moving, and masterful movie.  One of the most touching stories ever put onto film and a must own for fans of David Lynch or great cinema.  It is unfortunate that there are no chapter stops on the DVD, but that was Lynch's choice.  As the director of the movie, I suppose that he has that right, but it is a shame.  Other reviewers ask you to wait for a re-release.  There will most likely be none, so don't let Lynch's decision dissuade you, particularly since the transfer and sound are wonderful and the few extras that are provided are equally so.  An amazing story, and an amazing film.  I give it the highest possible recommendation.
B00003CX5P|3.0|This movie had a lot of expectations to live up to, and it didn't live up to any except the great graphics.  The two greatest characters in this movie are killed off.  Darth Maul was a great and formidable &quot;bad guy,&quot; and Liam Neeson was wonderful.  Anakin was dreadful, the child couldn't act his way out of a paper bag, and Jar Jar Binks was probably the most annoying character I have ever witnessed in a movie, or even real life.  Maybe if you have young kids you'll like it, but if you want something like the originals, it's not worth it.
0684800713|5.0|The Sun Also Rises is one of the few works of literature that shook me to the core, along with Remarque's Three Comrades, Gorky's autobiography, and Chekhov's The Lady With The Dog. I read a page and I was hooked. Bam, just like that. I read the thing in a day. In several hours, actually. And then I went and devoured the rest of the man's literary oeuvre. It's just that great. All the greater because when you really look at it, there's no dramatic action going on here - just some people talking, then going to Spain to see the bullfights. But don't let that fool you - boring this book ain't.<br />Jake Barnes, like most of the characters, is a veteran of World War I. A very unfortunate wound left physical love a complete impossibility for him, and thus he is left gnashing his teeth watching the woman he loves run around with all sorts of men. The Jewish Robert Cohn, who learned boxing in college in order to conquer his feelings of inferiority, happens to become smitten with her as well. Somehow, they and some of their friends and acquaintances end up going to Spain to experience the Fiesta, and while their experience starts the same giddy, frenzied, hedonistic way as for most people, it ends quite differently, when the book's darker undercurrents come to light. Insert scenes of cafe life, fishing, reminiscences, conversations with friends, watching the bullfights, some absolutely brutal humor, and lots and lots of liquor, and you've got yourself Hemingway's first masterpiece. Every element of every great Hemingway book can be seen here - plenty of vivid descriptions; moments of strange, elegiac melancholy; the human spirit fighting against the world; loneliness, isolation, and endurance. They're all here.<br />For some reason, this book seems to draw accusations of anti-Semitism. And all I've to say on that topic is: What? Anti-Semitism? Here? Please, what is this you speak of? Sure, Cohn's a Jew. And sure, the characters aren't too fond of him. And yet, Hemingway presents him in a very, very sympathetic light. Sure, we're rooting for Jake Barnes because he's smarmy and witty and cool, but when we see Cohn break down in tears in his hotel room because ..., he was naive enough to _believe_ Brett loved him, how can you possibly say Hemingway had any anti-Semitic sentiments on his mind? No, no, no, and a thousand times no. This is not a book about Jews, or Americans, or Britishers. This is a book about _people_, about young people searching for substance in a world that has none, trying to build up some sort of semblance of a normal life after having been through war. This is a book about people who feel life has passed them all by, and who have nothing to really look forward to. This book is filled with the genuine bitter loneliness of people who see nothing ahead of them. The sense of hopeless longing for something better permeates every page.<br />The Sun Also Rises is the sound of people trying to find a purpose for themselves in an increasingly shallow world. And lest that not convince you to read it, it happens to rock .... Rarely have I read more bitingly acerbic insults and comebacks, wry and cynical remarks, and deadly accurate observations. Actually, rarely have I ever felt so drawn in to the world of a book as much as here. I identified with Jake Barnes and Bill Gorton and that Englishman they met while fishing and with the boozing Mike and with Cohn. I understood their copious drinking and verbal barb-flinging because I was struck by the moments of absolutely believable fragile vulnerability that lay underneath the surface. The subtle gestures, the shifts in tone, the tough, terse prose all added to the various effects when necessary. When I was done, the book left an indelible stamp on my mind. And what higher recommendation could anyone possibly give a book than that?

B00005QK3W|5.0|Having lived in England before the Beatles were well known in the U.S.A they provided background music for many early memories.I once attended a Paul  McCartney and Wings concert,it was a very moving experience.I'm so glad he is making music again,and I have been playing this CD over and over.I wind down my windows and turn up the volume while &quot;Freedom&quot; is playing.&quot;She's Given Up Talking&quot;is an interesting piece too.  Tiny Bubble,Lonely Road,Magic and From A Lover To A Friend are wonderful also.Great talent,never gets old!!
B00005Y228|4.0|For those of you who remember the Kylie Minogue of the 80s, she of \\"I should be so Lucky\\" and a terrible cover of \\"Locomotion\\", forget her. That Kylie is gone. Dead. This is a new fabulous Kylie. This Kylie has been honing her skills as a disco diva in the gay clubs of London and is ready to burn up the charts in the US. You will not be able to get \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\" out of your mind. Penned by another long lost 80s gal from the late 80s and early 90s, Cathy Dennis, Can't Get You Out Of My Head, one of those infectious songs that you'll find yourself singing all day long. This modern day Kylie isn't a one-hit wonder either, \\"Love at First Sight\\" is an amazing track. \\"Burning Up\\" is just that. The US version also has a remix of the amazing \\"Butterfly\\" from Kylie's last album, \\"Light Years\\". By the time you finish this album you'll start wondering what happened to those other 80s divas, Belinda, Tiffany and Debbie.
6304109318|1.0|This was a truly awful movie, which I plan to sell after my one viewing. Julia Roberts' on-again, off-again Irish accent is terrible. The rest of the movie is slow and disgusting.
B00005UQ9F|4.0|i remember wanting to see this in the theater so when it came out today i got it. not to much action in the begining but it keeps you wondering whats gonna happen and holds your interest till the end and thinking after the end. i suggest u see this with people who can think and not those who just want to see action and gore so u can really pay attention and get into it. NOT TO BE MISSED!
B00005B4GU|4.0|Radiohead are a classic British group. Although perhaps not as good as some of their earlier material (which is why I have marked it down) this is still a great album. 'Packt Like Sardines' is a brilliant song, even better when performed live. 'Pyramid Song' is a interesting, beautiful track with a strange rhythm, but once again we see evidence of Radiohead's interesting and exciting musical experimentation. 'You And Who's Army' begins a little slow but is overall fantastic. 'Knives Out' is another good single release whereas 'Hunting Bears' is somewhat odd but sheer musical genius. The best track in my view is 'I Might Be Wrong' which has a superb guitar riff. A great track and a great album. long live Radiohead.
B00001ZTFZ|4.0|Though Risk is not as &quot;in your face&quot; as some of Megadeth's previous releases, this album starts off as agressive as anything the band has ever done. Jumping out of the gates with Insomnia, and tearing into Prince of Darkness, this one starts off in clasic Megadeth style. Lightening up a bit with Breadline, it moves back into the &quot;heavy&quot; with The Dr. is Calling, before once again mellowing out until Time: The End, polishes it off in &quot;riff-tastic&quot; style. And of course, who could overlook the perennial arena classic Crush 'Em. <BR>    As stated, This one is not as overpowering as some of Megadeths other releases, but it should be appreciated for what it is; A very good album with a style all its own. After all, you can't expect a band to come out with album after album and not try anthing new. They flex their muscle with a hand full of powerfully agressive tunes, but they also have a  need to show the true musical tallent the men of Megadeth really have.
B000002UJQ|5.0|'Paranoid Android' is absolutely brilliant - I love it. The whole of this album is brilliant. Radiohead rock. They are without a doubt one of the best groups in the world today. Thom Yorke is a wonderful musician. If you haven't already got this album, you need it. 'Airbag', 'Exit Music' and 'No Surprises' are also great songs, aswell as 'Karma Police'. Fantastic Album. Top band. Buy it now, if you haven't already.
0553213105|5.0|Jane Austen's, Pride and Prejudice, is an intriguing, nerve riveting structure pieced together with utmost meticulousness. Like a metropolitan skyscraper towering over its suburban brothers, Jane Austen's novel prevails as possibly one of the most powerful novels to fall into a reader's hand.<br /> The witty heroine, Elizabeth Bennet, prevails as the most interesting and involved character. She mesmerizes the reader with her wit and grace. Although Mary is the dullest of a girl, the remaining cast and her are a most interesting bunch. The third person omnipresent narrative allows the reader to peak at every character; in the process revealing the Mr. Bennet's hilarious sarcasm and views on his wife along with Mr. Wickham's and Mr. Darcy's true positions and personalities, which I could never bring across to you with as gracefully as is done by Jane Austen, so you will just have to read the book.<br /> As Austen introduces the players of the marriage game, which proves to be the center around which the plot is set, she presents the two themes that control the novel and are the title of it, pride and prejudice. Victorian society prevailed as the perfect setting to play out the two themes, as it was an era when social and economical status made a person who he/she is. Age, money, family name, and economical differences steer almost every single conversation and decision throughout the novel. They create for a most suspenseful scene; will Darcy, Bingley, Jane, Liz, and the rest of the cast surpass the boundaries set by pride and prejudice, and come together or will they let those boundaries keep them apart. Only one way to find out how sad or happy the ending is; you must read!
6303442846|5.0|1st things 1st...<BR>Tatum O'Neal should have won the Oscar for Best Actress not the Supprting Oscar and the magnificent Miss Kahn should have won the Supporting Oscar...Now that I said this...<BR>It is just a perfect film on all levels! The photography is super and the old scratchy 78's used for the film's score is wonderful. Bogdonovich's direction is pitch perfect and the acting...well, even the tiniest roles are played to perfection...
B00005RYQO|2.0|Fast and the Furious works ,but we have seen this before. Still you wonder, have the Movie Studios stopped making risky movies? It is a recycled car movie that has all that what the other movies give to you ,but It's not a bad movie at all.I like Vin Diesel as this sort of the God of this group of nightracers. Paul Walker is very slick(SEE PAUL IN JOY RIDE!!!) actor both him and Diesel I think are very talanted.All this movie is, is a fun summer blockbuster to watch....no logic required just buckle your seat belt.... Honestly I wished Universal Pictures could have used a better movie to appeal to Teens versus what we have seen before. Stars **1/2
B00005Y228|5.0|I have the import version of this album &amp; jus recently bought this album! I can honestly say that this is a the best dance album I've heard in a LONG time!

0812550706|4.0|While reading this novel, I discerned that the author, Orson Scott Card, used a meager and obscure intellectual matrix to elucidate the development of leadership traits and skills of a quasi-scientific character named Ender, who supposedly had the potential to become a great field commander.  From the beginning, this story was very misleading.  It did not seem to have a focal point or an objective, and was filled with illusions that appeared to further mislead the reader by depicting act of gang fights coupled with the fight Ender had with his brother.  This was enigmatic and appeared to be absolutely under questionable pretenses.  If anything, the reader became further discombobulated, without any means of directional assistance from the author.   <BR>It was not until Colonel Graff visited Ender, that I became focused and aroused intellectually.  For that reason, I felt this book was very boring because it took too long for the author to finally capture the attention span of his readership.  It continued to characterize Ender as the only one who was capable of saving his people, the Buggers, during the next war.  Through trial and error, Ender's ability to master challenges put before him proved to be worthy of an appointment as a government official.  Theoretically, he was a great warrior and could save the world from itself.  <BR>This book also brought about ambiguous illusions to the reader, and I felt that there were better ways to reach an audience other than this scientific approach to Scott's work.  Especially, if there is a story to be told that could or would contribute to one's ability to save lives and the rest world.  And that manifested the difference as if between space, heave, and earth.         <BR>I would like to presume that, in the end, Scott wanted to send a profound message to the readership by way of this scientific character, that people on earth and the unknown in space, could live together in peace and harmony in one universe without havingto battle.
B000005JAX|5.0|This album is one of the best I have ever heard. I am a die hard fan of DM, and an even bigger fan of Martin Gore himself. He is an absolute genius and I think a rather underrated songwriter. Even though the songs on \\"Counterfeit E.P.\\" were not written by him, his voice alone conveys the immense emotion he feels and is absolutely breathtaking. My personal favorite is \\"Motherless Child\\" partly because it shows his incredible voice range. I love the way he sings and I highly recommend anyone who is a DM fan (or even those who aren't) to add this album to your collection.
B00005OM4Q|5.0|I've always loved rock'n'roll and the culture surrounding it. Cameron Crowe has made a movie about a fictional rock band and all that goes with it (including groupies), and gotten it RIGHT!!! The characters all have heart and soul, no matter what their flaws.  As a result this movie is always entertaining, at times hilarious, and sometimes heartbreaking!  Every scene is excellent, all the main characters so fleshed out.  If Oliver Stone had directed this movie, you KNOW Penny Lane (the lead band-aid)would have been portrayed as a mindless bimbo.  Thank-gawd Cameron Crowe's in charge here!  Like the male characters, Penny is portrayed as a human being.  If you've enjoyed books by Pamela Des Barres (\\"I'm With The Band\\") or Bebe Buell (\\"Rebel Heart\\"), you'll be especially thankful for Cameron's direction! All the actors are excellent.  I especially loved Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Lester Bangs, he really hit the nail on the head!  Equally colorful is Frances McDormand's performance as the over-protective mother.  The casting in this movie is perfect, as is the screenplay and direction!!!  It never stumbles!  Too bad Cameron Crowe didn't direct a movie on the Doors.  If he had, viewers may have walked away seeing Jim Morrison and co. as HUMAN and actually LIKING them and FEELING for them!
079072961X|1.0|Okay, \\"The Fugitive\\" had your standard action-pic thrills and a pretty good performance by Tommy Lee Jones. But really, this is a lousy movie for three reasons.<br />1. It's only about a guy running from the law and trying to clear his name. That was never the point of the TV series -- the series was all about putting the character into situations where he'd be thrown in with the poor or oppressed people of America -- abused women, Mexican farm workers, black brutality victims, the people who never showed up on \\"Father Knows Best.\\" It was a show with a tremendous sense of adventure and conscience, whereas the movie chickens out, cuts the guts out of the \\"Fugitive\\" concept and just turns it into a will-he-or-won't-he-survive cliffhanger. It's mentally empty Hollywood schlock. Which would be fine if they hadn't called it \\"The Fugitive.\\"<br />2. The train crash at the beginning (and in the trailer, so I'm not giving anything away) -- he really survived that? Give me a break.<br />3. When we find out the reason why somebody has hatched this evil plot against him, it's laughable. I'm sorry, this scheme would just never have happened in life -- it would easily have been found out and there's no incentive for someone to have cooked it up in the first place. This is lame screenwriting.
B00005QDW1|5.0|This has been in the works for a very long time and since working with Dr Dre, the band have developed and added another genre to their style.....dancehall reggae . There are however many similarities compared to the other four of their albums. Hey baby is the first single and is such a catchy tune it will be stuck in ya head, i guarantee.<BR>I am however slightly biased towards them coz ive loved them since i was young and fragile? This album is a great landmark in No Doubt history, I bet you didnt know theyd been together for fifteen years...well did ya?
B00004XOWM|1.0|When I heard &quot;Rollin'&quot; on the radio back when it first came out, I knew music as we knew it was dead. It actually died back in 1974 but the corpse had been kicking around since then. I'm glad to see there are still some sensible music fans out there who know garbage when they hear it. And any review I read featuring this (...) gets a negative vote from me no matter what it says.
B00005NVT1|5.0|I think this CD is amazing. I like Homework a lot, and i love how they took a few of the songs and reworked them live like this. Instead of pushing &quot;Play&quot; like some electronic artists do, they created a thunderous mix live that must have been incredibly fun to dance to. The CD stomps. Seeing as this was in 1997 when they were still techno pioneers, it's an artifact of what they were. As, with Discovery they've turned into terrible neo-disco cheese. I'm apparently against the grain in saying that Discovery doesn't have 5 minutes worth listening to more than once... if once. Alive 1997 is the real deal. Powerful, creative dance. Why, after this, they decided to imitate everything bad with 70's music that they &quot;Discovered&quot; is beyond me.
B000002LIM|5.0|Tim Burton &amp; Danny Elfman were made for each other. I've never seen a director giving so much space for the music to flow out from the movie. It was a wise move. With Burton's positively gothic outlook on the urban chaos that is Gotham City and its protector - Batman, Elfman superbly captures the vision onto music. I've lost words to describe the music in this album. You only need to listen to The Batman Theme to understand what I'm talking about.<br />Some people have hated the songs from Prince but I beg to differ. If there is one track from the Prince Batman soundtrack which deserves mention is the song &quot;Scandalous&quot; which plays during the end-credits of the movie. It's a superb atmospheric song that combines perfectly with Elfman's music which is why Elfman saw it fit to include shades of this tune in this album as a love theme since Prince wrote it as a making love song between Bruce Wayne and Vicky Vale.<br />I would recommend Batfans to buy this album and the Scandalous single if you want to avoid the other Batman songs from Prince.

If you're looking for something along the lines of the Watchmen or one of Alan Moore's other graphic novels this probably isn't it.<br />Moore's still using his dysfunctional heroes (which I like), but in a very main stream comic style storyline.  Incredibly implausible plots, with no attempt made to justify them and adding little sub-plots out of the blue to be taken care of in later issues gives the feeling that this story has no beginning or end.<br />The use of Victorian literary heroes starts out as a nice device, but is quickly overused to the point where you get the feeling that it's just being used to give legitimacy to what is otherwise a very juvenile story.<br />I imagine that if he had intended to write this as a finite series or a graphic novel Alan Moore could have done something really amazing--something on par with Watchmen or From Hell.  As it stands, however, this is just your run-of-the-mill comic with some nudity, and drug references.
B00004X0Q0|5.0|Once again, the Hell Paso boys have come out with an unbelievable, addictable, album that just makes you want to play it over and over and over again. From the energetic opening, 'Arcarsenal' with high pitched screams and excellent guitar riffs, at the drive-in continue to deliver good song after good song. With complimenting moods from songs like 'Cosmonaut' and the infamous 'One Armed Scissors' with heavy guitar, to light-hearted, easy listening songs like 'Non-Zero Possibility' and 'Invalid Litir Department', the album is one that I genuinely listen to everyday. If you are a fan of pre-Acrobatic Tenement at the drive-in, this album is not quite the same, but the improvements are endless. At the drive-in have continued to push out and test the barriers of so-called 'sane' music, while not letting song quality slip. Relationship of Command truly is one of the greatest albums ever, and I reccomend it to anyone interested in rock, punk, emo, nu-metal, grunge, ANYTHING that involves a guitar. One tip, please please give it a chance. It takes quite a while to become accustomed to the album, and many people are not too impressed on first time hearing the produtions of at the drive-in. So please don't be turned off by first impressions if you've never listened to atd-i before, just do your best to wade through it, but trust me, when the album grows on you, it makes it all worth while
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I just want to say if this does not win the Grammy for best album of the year there is no justice!!!  Not only are the musical arrangements and performances superior..but he truly is a genius and eclectic.  There are so many different styles including Texas Swing, Blues, Bluegrass....etc.....This is one of the most prolific songwriters of our time....and if you don't have this, get it!!!  If you have not heard it..you need too!!!
0679411585|5.0|With the movie coming out this week, it's time to get serious about SOLDIERS and discuss the book (although from all accounts the movie is faithful to a remarkable and, for Hollywood, surprising degree).<br />The silly old saw is that there are two kinds of people, and it goes downhill from there. In this case, there ARE two kinds of people: those who have fought to the death in battle, and the rest of the world. The soldiers in SOLDIERS fought one of the bloodiest, nastiest, ugliest and most brutal actions in the history of war, and this book describes their experiences with dreadful clarity.<br />The remarkable thing about this book, beyond the  vigor and quality of the writing, is its directness and lack of histrionics or unnecessary drama. This was a very bad place to be and there was, literally, no way out for most of those involved. If anyone has any illusions about the supposed dignity of war, SOLDIERS will dispel those illusions for ever.<br />I intend to see the movie and try to watch without turning away or pretending that such shocking violence and death does not occur and need not touch anyone not directly involved. The awful truth that comes across in the book is that the men who fought and died did so as surrogates of other humans on both sides and that there is no way for those others to avoid responsibility for these events.<br />Why not indulge in an exhaustive analysis of the book itself? There is no need, because 90+ other reviewers have done it well. I just wanted to get past the paper-and-ink facets to explain what this book does to the mind and heart and why every thinking person should read it and consider his or her attitude to war.<br />War is indeed hell. Are there any other alternatives? Will we ever learn? How low can humans get if they can condone what has been happening to our species for millennia and what otherwise thoughtful, sensible individuals can do to each other?<br />I have suggested, not entirely in jest, that Planet Earth is actually a penal colony to which we have been sent for past bad behavior in some part of the galaxy or other. This comes to an apotheosis in SOLDIERS.<br />Read it and weep for all of us, for all time.penal colony to which we have been sent for past bad behavior in some part of the galaxy or other.

0571202284|5.0|I'm a graduate of a one year animation certificate program in classical animation. In many ways, this book covers a lot of the ground of Preson Blair's classic bible &quot;Cartoon Animation&quot;, as well as Tony White's excellent &quot;Animator's Handbook&quot;. However, it also deals with practical examples to extend the lessons from these initial books. The whole section on 'walks' has lessons on acting, character and animation that deal with all areas of acting in animation, not simply walk cycles. <br />It's also more practical than the Illusion of Life, in that it has a logical progression of lessons and enough custom illustrations to more precicely demonstrate these points. In many ways, It's the intermediate book between the intellectual aspects of the Illusion of Life, and the basic principals of Cartoon Animation. <br />For me, this was like a second year of school: I had learned all the concepts and basic principals I needed in that first year of school using Tony White and Preson Blair. Richard William's book expanded on those concepts, and has already started to improve my work in the first two months of receiving it. I highly recommend this book to any animation students out there, as well as graduates looking to increase their skills.
6305648522|5.0|This beautiful and sentimentally bittersweet Italian movie about the friendship between a small-town boy fascinated by movies (who grows up to be a famous movie director) and the movie projectionist at the town's Cinema Paradiso is one of my Top-5 favorite movies of all times (the other four are: Casablanca, The English Patient, Doctor Zhivago and The Unbearable Lightness of Being). From the opening scene, a simple shot of a view looking out from a house toward the sea with one of the movie's beautiful theme songs playing, to the last scene which (I garantee) will move you to tears, you are transported to an enchanted world where life was simpler and the only available entertainment in town was at the Cinema Paradiso. You'll enjoy the simplicity of the story, the wonderful actings of the little boy and the movie projectionist, and the beautiful, romantic and bittersweet soundtrack (composed by the great Italian composer Ennio Morricone). What is great about this movie is that it'll make you want to watch it again and again. I'm looking forward to seeing the director's cut which will be released in theaters in May 2002 by Miramax. I hope that the director's cut DVD will be available soon thereafter. A movie not to be missed!

B00005U2LM|2.0|I'll be the first to admitt I love wu tang but this album to me was simply garbage. The lyrics were ok nothing like their first  couple of cds. Wu tang is not the same ever since odb got locked up. It seems that they cared more about their solo albums then they did about there group album and thats sad because I would love to see wu tang blow up again. Their beats [were bad] on this album and I'm saying that because I know what their capable of, coming up with the dopest beats around. People are trying to say it's a good album and there giving it 5 stars because they are wu tang fans but if that album were to be relesed on a different name every body would be dissing it. So if you feel like throwing money away buy this album and you'll see what I'm talking about.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|I have never been so underwhelmed by a film. I'm glad I didn't fork over the cash to see it at the theater, because I'm sure I would have fallen asleep. At no point in this movie did I care one whit about Lara Croft or any other character. The &quot;action&quot; scenes seemed like they were in slow motion -- and not cool-effect slow motion, just not-at-all-exciting, I-can't-do-this-any-faster slow motion. I was really looking forward to Angelina Jolie as a tough action-heoine chick, but all I saw was a bunch of one-dimensional cartoon characters. Oh, and an overstuffed bra...
0553106635|5.0|One of the reviewers below made some comments about how some of the threads in this series seem to end nowhere and that &quot;there should be a fourth volume to just wrap everything up.&quot; (paraphrased) I just wanted to say that there IS going to be a fourth volume (A Dance with Dragons) as well as two more. Apparently, the reviewer didn't read the jacket of A Storm of Swords, but this is a series of SIX proposed books.<BR>With that taken care of, I can't recommend this series enough. It makes everything else in the fantasy genre seem like children's stories.

B00005Q2RZ|5.0|Ryan Adams is one of the worlds hidden treasures, but not for long. It has been announced that he is nominated for 3 Grammy's this year, a stellar accomplishment for this late-twenties rocker. It seems there is no end to his musical capability. From hip pop/folk hits like \\"New York, New York\\" to his slow ballads like \\"Harder Now That It's Over\\" he is a master of the musical arts, and there should be no end to his lauding for bringing a new face of musical brevity and complexity to the pop music scene. Elton John even says that Ryan makes him want to be a better musician. <br />In one album Ryan has show his ability to play to the gamut of human emotion and experience. The Limited Edition is a must; the 5 added tracks add platinum to GOLD. \\"The Bar is a Beautiful Place\\"<BR>uses crescendo, and an upbeat memorable chorus to create an unforgettable listening experience a perfect example of why you need the limited edition. Ryan?s talents certainly don?t end with his unsupassed musical know-how; his mastery of the lyrical arts is also proven in this, his newest album. From sad songs of loves lost to his love for \\"the city\\"; Ryan seems to always have just the right words, to let you know you?re not alone in any of the ups and downs in life. My friends and I put him in the category of a musical/lyrical God.<br />Don't be put off by the existentialistic music, he also knows how to have a good time and just let loose, seriously, if you need one album for just about any occasion this one is it.<br />You don't have to take my word for it, just listen. I'm a fan for life, you just might be as well.<br />Also check out his other solo album Heartbreaker, particularly the song \\"Come Pick Me Up\\"
B00005MAM2|5.0|(...)<br />I quote \\"In 1988, the landmark Anime film, by director Katsuhiro Otomo, defined the cutting edge of Anime around the world.  By today's standards, AKIRA remains a landmark achievement in cel animation and retains the explosive impact of its highly detailed animation and its intensely violent saga of power and corruption.  Pioneer Entertainment proudly presents this classic film, completely restored and digitally re-mastered\\".<BR>                                     Back Cover of DVD<BR>I highly agree.  Still probably the best looking Anime today.  Mamoru Oshii and Manga Entertainment claim that their work of Ghost in the Shell exceeds the production values of AKIRA which is just about untrue in every possible way. Let it be known that AKIRA defines Japanamation. This is for young and old adult audiences alike, whether your looking forward to seeing some Japanamation for the first time or your a long-time fan looking for that one spectatular Anime to complete your library of the genre. This is it people, be happy and rejoice. This is definitely a purchase, I recommend buying it. And make sure you get the 2-disc Special Edition and not the regular edition.  Also I recommend Metropolis an anime that is supposedly going to really push the boundaries over this one, it's written by Katsuhiro Otomo creator and lead artist of AKIRA.
B00005QATY|1.0|Have you ever noticed that it's rare to read a bad review here?  I think people with vested interests in movies are the ones writing all the rave reviews.  Because this movie got so many great reviews and because it's a Coen Brothers' ( of &quot;Fargo&quot; &amp; &quot;Blood Simple&quot; fame) movie is the reason I decided to watch it.  I have no vested interest in this movie and here is my review:  This movie stinks.  It's stupid &amp; boring.  It plays like a cartoon but it's not funny and it's very slow moving.<br />Disclaimer:  I had to give this movie 1 star in order to post my review but I really don't feel it deserves any stars.
B00005R87Q|1.0|Stupid story and incredibly, painfully bad acting equal one terrible movie. Just how BAD of an actor is Vin Diesel!?!?!?! This movie sure does showcase just how god awful he really is. Do yourself a favor don't waste the money.
B00001OH7X|5.0|This album is a brilliant, on the edge, trend defying masterpiece, that has been very sadly underrated and destroyed by critics. It's difficult to follow two albums like heroes and low, and this of course isn't as cutting edge as them but nonetheless is extremely experimental, and has many excellent tracks, and no bad ones. Also as a plus the greatest progressive guitarist that there is (Adrian Belew) plays guitar along with the excellent Carlos Alomar. This album is like nothing that you've ever heard, if u don't own it, so don't let it throw you, give it a couple of listens, it takes some effort but it's well worth it. Definetly though check into Station to Station, Low, Heroes and Scary Monsters first and whether you like this album or not give one of those stunning albums a fair shot.

Julia was terribly misinterpreted, instead of John mourning for his mother, it was more longing for a girlfriend to come back.  <br />Still, an awesome collection.  The biggest collection of Beatles covers since Sgt. Pepper in 1978.

B00005R87Q|3.0|The Fast and The Furious is all day-glo coloured cars and polished chrome, lots of high speed car chases, the odd fist fight and plenty of macho posturing. That's not too say it's bad because it's actually pretty entertaining. The Fast and The Furious is a very glossy, testosterone charged male fantasy movie about a cop who infiltrates an auto-theft gang but falls in love with the gang leaders sister, causing him to question his conscience and his superiors to question his loyalties. Sound familiar?<br />(Does anybody remember the 1987 DB Sweeney/Charlie Sheen movie No Mans Land? If you don't then let me remind you of the plot: Rookie cop goes undercover to catch a wealthy young car thief but finds he likes the wealthy young car thief he's supposed to be trapping, and likes his sister even better).<br />Okay so The Fast and The Furious is not exactly Schindler's List or The Godfather when it comes to intellectual stimulation but it doesn't pretend to be and it's a very enjoyable movie, if all you are looking for is entertainment (and what's wrong with that?). Its very much testosterone charged but it still has much to recommend it: Good performances by its two male leads; the very muscular Vin Diesel as the gang leader Dom and the very handsome Paul Walker as the undercover cop. Jordana Brewster as the gang leaders sister also makes a very attractive female lead, although in many ways the cars and the stunts are the stars. Talking of stars, Vin Diesel's star is definitely on the rise and Paul Walker is certain to attract a legion of female fans to assure future star status.<br />The action in this movie is as the title says, fast and furious. It boasts plenty of excellent car chases and enough stunts throughout to keep you interested, if not on the edge of your seat. However, it must be said that some of the quarter of a mile car races, in supposedly super-powered cars, seem to last as long as three trips around Indianapolis's 2.5 mile oval track. It's also fair to point out that some of the dialogue is as we say in the UK a bit &quot;naff&quot;: In other words it will make you cringe occasionally but ALL IN ALL THIS IS PRETTY GOOD FUN. Plus the DVD boasts some reasonable extras.<br />(You can check out No Mans Land on VHS but I don't think its available on DVD)!to point out that some of the dialogue is as we say in the UK a bit &quot;naff&quot;: In other words it will make you cringe occasionally but ALL IN ALL THIS IS PRETTY GOOD FUN.

B00003CXSP|4.0|Man, I really enjoyed this movie, and I have to say that Gary Oldman is just perfect in this movie. No need to mention Anthony Hopkins and Giancarlo Gianinni who are also perfect in their roles. I did not like the idea of replacing Jodie Foster with... Julianne Moore, but I guess the movie is so good, I'll have to forgive this mistake. Miscasting? Moore tries so hard to look tough and honest that she fails terribly to the point of being unintentionally funny.<br />But what's to say about this movie? Well, as we all know, Hannibal Lecter is free and hiding somewhere in Italy. But one of his victims, wealthy Mason Verger is planing an elaborate scheme to get his revenge: trapping Hannibal Lecter to watch him being eaten by wild animals.<br />I have to say the music is excellent, cinematography... wow! It's a really elegant movie, superior in any way to its predecesor, The Silence of the Lambs. I highly recommend this one.<br />Bon Apetit.
0790731002|3.0|First of all let me start by saying that I really liked Batman Returns but thought Batman was a little slow and boring. The third instalment of Batman is however a bit of a mixed bag, although overall an entertaining third instalment.<br />Visually it's still great and there are a whole new array of bat toys, although the darker tone of Tim Burton's previous two movies is replaced here with a little more of a mass audience commerciality. To my mind this is something of a shame. Yes, Batman Forever is good but it does take this franchise back a step from the darker tone (which I like) of the original comic strips and Tim Burtons first two instalments of this franchise. It does have a great cast though and its all good fun.<br /> Val Kilmer doesn't do anything wrong although he fails to outshine Michael Keaton as his replacement in the batsuit. Jim Carrey is very well-cast, in a role he was born to play, as The Riddler even if his riddles aren't that great (it is after all a family film and kids have to understand them too). The reliably excellent Tommy Lee Jones as \\"Two Face\\" is however outshone by Jim Carrey's \\"Riddler\\" and Nicole Kidman although sultry and sexy doesn't get enough screen time to make a lasting impression. All in all the movie is good family entertainment, although fans of Tim Burton's darker toned movies may be a little disappointed.<br />Batman **<br />Batman Returns ****<br />Batman Forever ***<br />Batman and Robin *

B00003CXZ1|2.0|Angelina Jolie excels as Lady Lara Croft, a wealthy English archaeologist, and modern-times female version of Indiana Jones/James Bond in this video game adaptation. Not only does she look fantastic swinging through the air on bungee cords, knocking out menacing villains clad in black but she totally looks and acts the part of the Tomb Raider heroine Lara Croft, like she was born to play this role. She is stunningly attractive and looks every inch the action hero and what's more, her English accent is absolutely spot on. However, despite her valiant efforts this really is a soul-less film served up by Director Simon West (Con Air) that fails to live up to the excitement of the video games. The action scenes are merely a collection of set-pieces (often borrowed from other movies) that somehow fail to thrill and the plot (what plot?) is about as uninspiring as they come.<br />So what is the \\"plot\\"? Tragically, Lara's father, played by real-life dad Jon Voight, died when she was eight, leaving her to a lonely life of raiding tombs... As fate would have it, Lara becomes embroiled in a plot to recover the pieces of an ancient artefact (a small pyramid) that was split into pieces to protect mankind and hidden in unspecified tombs around the world, guarded by elaborate defences. When re-assembled the possessor of the pyramid can control time and space when the planets become aligned and so it is left to Lara to race against time to stop the bad guys and save the planet.<br />There is little or no character development in this movie. None of the main or supporting characters, apart from Lara Croft, are given any depth or explanation for their actions or motivation. Lara, we discover, still mourns the death of her father (Jon Voight, hamming it up with a truly awful accent) but even this sub-plot is pretty pointless. Meanwhile her fellow tomb raiders (Iain Glen plays a particularly loathsome villain) betray each other for no reason other than to serve the plot, and when ultimately Lara risks everything to save her former love (Daniel Craig) it's a bit hard to swallow, particularly when for the previous eighty minutes their has been no evidence of any previous affection or chemistry between the two of them and he spends most of the entire film being villainous with no apparent redeeming qualities.<br />Ultimately the movie has its moments but it's a bit of a mess. No story, a poor script, no character development and lacklustre direction. It has no soul or integrity and insults it's audience's intelligence by assuming that all we want to see is a beautiful big-breasted woman shooting up bad guys in a series of action set-pieces in exotic locations, without any plot or cohesion to hold the movie together. Angelina Jolie certainly can't be blamed for this movie's failure. She excels as the confident and sexy tomb raider and makes a very believable action hero. I just hope that they make a sequel, a much better sequel, with a story, direction and plot to do Angelina Jolie, the character and the games justice.<br /><br />5 STARS FOR ANGELINA, 4 stars for the DVD extras but only 2 stars for the movie!timately Lara risks everything to save her former love (Daniel Craig) it's a bit hard to swallow, particularly when for the previous eighty minutes their has been no evidence of any previous affection or chemistry between the two of them and he spends most of the entire film being villainous with no apparent redeeming qualities. <br />Ultimately the movie has its moments but it's a bit of a mess.

0783225792|4.0|This movie has often I think unfairly been accused of merely being a Goodfellas remake set in Las Vegas. Sure it shares the same cast, crew and subject matter as Goodfellas but to dismiss this movie as a remake I think is totally unfair. Goodfellas is a very popular critically acclaimed movie and considered by many to be Scorcese's finest work but I have to honestly say that I enjoyed this movie almost every bit as much. Maybe it's because De Niro is the star as opposed to a supporting actor. He is after all the finest actor of his generation and he like the rest of the cast (including, surprisingly, Sharon Stone) are on top form here.<br />Casino is what can only be described as hard hitting and brutal in it's realistic portrayal of the mob, how they controlled Las Vegas, lost control of Vegas and there violent way of life (and death). If you don't like violence, don't watch this movie or at least keep your hands ready to cover your eyes at the first sight of a pen, a woodwork vice or a baseball bat. Trust me, these scenes will make any sane person whince. De Niro is fantastic in this movie as Sam \\"Ace\\" Rothstein and he is ably supported by Joe Pesci in what is admittedly basically a reprisal (but none the less a very good reprisal) of his psychopath role in Goodfellas. It's gritty and realistic and it's a long movie (approx. 3 hours) but it was three hours of quality that kept me and my friends glued and captivated in front of the television. This is definitely not for everybody but it is essential viewing for people who, like me, enjoy 'gangster' movies that are long, gritty and realistic. Unmissable for fans of Scorcese, De Niro, Pesci and Sharon Stone in a career best (Oscar nominated) screen performance.
B00005QG9J|4.0|Many Incubus fans have showed dismay when it comes to &quot;Morning View,&quot; calling it too &quot;pop,&quot; but I love this album.  &quot;Aqueous Transmission&quot; finds the group doing something that many bands are afraid to do these days, and that's experiment. &quot;Mexico&quot; is not like many other break-up songs because of its heartfelt and well-thought-out lyrics. I mean anyone can sing &quot;please don't leave me baby&quot; or &quot;I can get another man/woman.&quot; Of course, &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; drew a lot of unwarranted fire, but there's nothing wrong with a delightful enjoy-the-day kind of tune.<BR>I was not introduced to Incubus until &quot;Make Yourself,&quot; and I have steadily gone backwards in purchasing other music by the band. I must say that it is wonderful when musicians can break free from the prison known as genre and just make great music. I'm looking forward to their next CD.
B0000549B0|4.0|...Adapted from a Pullitzer prize winning play, James Stewart stars in this classic black and white 1950 movie as the good natured gentleman Elwood P. Dowd, friend to everybody and in particular his constant companion \\"Harvey\\", a 6' 7\\" rabbit that nobody else can see. Unfortunately for Elwood's sister Veta Louise (in an Oscar winning performance) life becomes more complicated when her mission to find her daughter a husband are repeatedly scuppered time and again by Elwood and his obsession with his best friend. This inevitably leads to Veta Louise deciding to have her good natured brother committed to a mental hospital leading to all sorts of mix-ups, including being his sister being committed instead, leaving Elwood to sort everything out with his kindly and unwaveringly pleasant approach to life.<br />This is a beautifully written and perfectly acted movie that should appeal to anyone with a heart and an ounce of sentiment...They really don't make movies like this anymore and so this is a perfect addition to a movie lovers film library. Other favourites that appeal to my sentimental side and this is one tp put alongside Arsenic and Old Lace, It's A Wonderful Life (and virtually every other Frank Capra movie) and I'd also add Field Of Dreams to the list of all-time greatest heart-warming movies.
B00005YW4H|5.0|What an auspicious recording this is. We've only just begun to witness what Norah Jones has to offer. This album is a gem. Norah Jones is a humble, polished performer who never lets her own ambition cloud her purpose -- performing brilliant, deceptively simple and beautiful music.   &quot;Come Away With Me&quot; is eclectic in feel, ranging from jazz, country to almost R&amp;B.   Jones is a musical chameleon -- you never realize what style you're listening to -- you simply know it is extraordinary. The caliber of each musician is phenomenal and Jones herself possesses a voice that is all at once smokey, rich, warm and intimate.<br />Norah Jones is not solely a jazz pianist with a great sound -- she is a sensitive songwriter as well.  Several of her own songs appear on the CD, including the title track.  I found the original material by Norah and multi-talented band members, Lee Alexander and Jesse Harris, to surpass the &quot;classics&quot; which are also offered.  The original material on the album is a divine marriage of first-class music with marvelous lyrics.  There is a universal quality to every track that makes them stand out of time and place.  The lyrics are unique -- yet so personal they almost feel familiar without seeming cliched.

6303997198|5.0|Bar-non, the best romantic picture I can remember.  I enjoyed the intensity, the drama, the coming together and yet, the separation and pain.  Truly indicative of the consequences of the changes we make in life; the road not taken vs the one we are destined for.  I watch this movie periodically, always with the same enthusiasm and excitement.
0553282980|5.0|I found the book very exciting, because you never know what happen in the next chapter. There is always a tension in the history. It entertained me well. But I must say there were lots of words, I didn't know. That made the book very difficult to read.<BR>The message of the book: GO YOUR OWN WAY AND ARE INDEPENDANT! I think this sentence make everybody thinking about the life and how to live. That's the reason, why I find the book so good, because you can think about something!

0553282980|4.0|As I have read this book and I had the feeling it was a special book because  the author wrote it like real life . I do not find this book excellent, but good. You can learn so much and this is for in every life situation. It was very interesting to read something about a private school. I always thought that the students in a private school had only one goal to be very good students who want to become lawyers or doctors.  But I noticed that they had some other goals too. They are like all students you who do not attend a private school. Seize the day!!
B000059Z8J|5.0|Back in the late seventies, it was very easy to be derisive of Superman. Brando's outlandish fee, the sledgehammer marketing and the film's own pompousness- not least in delaying the appearance of its title character for a whole hour- made it stick in the craw for many people. <br />But for children, innocent of such things, it was a tremendous, uplifting experience. I remember leaving the cinema and instantly punching the air in the full belief that I too could streak into the sky. And I know I'm not the only one. <br />Seeing the film now, it's possible to make sense of both responses. Now that it has dated badly, its commercial exigencies are all too apparent, and more than once come close to knackering the narrative (see any scene with Brando in it).<BR> <BR>However, the film is still bursting with charm. The cornfield Smallville sequence and yappy Metropolis are extremely well realised, and take life from a raft of quality performances. <br />Central is the casting masterstroke of Christopher Reeve, whose sensitive reading of the role is about as perfectly judged as they get. His Clark Kent is a klutzy fish out of water, but it's the way he lets that vulnerability seep into his Man of Steel that makes it a performance to cherish. The effect is this: Superman has the looks and powers of a god, but he's also an outsider who just wants to be loved.<br />Honours also go to John Williams for one of his most inspired scores, one that fully justifies its lengthy showcase during the bombastic title sequence.<br />The new release is excellent, with a much-improved soundtrack and supplementary materials that enrich the experience rather than just prolong it. Like the best DVDs, the documentaries and lively commentary provide an illuminating insight into the passions and struggles involved in making films, and recommend it as an essential buy, not only for fans of this film, but for everybody who loves the movies.
0553282980|4.0|It's a very emotional novel, which makes you think about a lot of things. There are many different characters and in one of those you can perhaps see yourself. The message of it is, that you have to be an individual and that you have to do what you want. It shows you how life is like with all the injuries and despair. It's very well written so you can easily understand this message.
B00003CXXS|3.0|Hands up if you thought The Lost World wasn't up to much? Yeah, me too. <br />Funny though, after the experience of seeing this third dinosaur movie, I'm nostalgically itching to see the second one again. Because I remember that, despite a crummy story thinly spread amongst too many characters, it was at least directed by Steven Spielberg, who knows a thing or two about making entertainments of this sort. <br />The script let him down, but the film was crammed full of little moments, details and touches that evinced his magic touch. Let's face it, Julianne Moore face down on the slowly cracking glass door was a how-to in movie tension. But more importantly, Spielberg viewed the dinosaurs as a behaviourist, always insisting on their status as animals, giant fish out of water merely reacting to their unnatural circumstances in the only way they know how. It made the dinosaurs sympathetic, kept buoyant the theme of man playing God, and it made for very convincing special effects. <br />Jurassic Park III is a monster movie, pure and simple. A little too simple. The technology has advanced to allow CG creatures many times more versatile than before, but somehow they seem flatter. If proof were needed that CGI is nothing without the skill to wield it, then it is here. <br />The half hour amputated from the running time-- presumably in a panic that the film would bomb-- would have been better spent supplying the actors with actual characters to work with and enriching the audience experience with people to give a toss about. <br />But I don't mean to be too cruel about Jurassic Park III. On its own terms, it's enjoyable enough and far from poor of its type. Unfortunately, its terms are not its own, but those of someone who did much, much more with a dodgy rubber shark nearly thirty years ago.
0553282980|4.0|I think it's in a way a good book because it's not so hard to understand and not a too simple text either. You can discuss its message!<BR>It was fun to read the novel, but it's not a literary work of art.
B00005Y228|4.0|The last time Kylie Minogue made waves in the US, she had a couple of 1988 hits--\\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" and \\"Loco Motion\\"--produced by the hitmaking team of Stock Aitken Waterman.  Since then, she faded into obscurity while she racked up over 30 hits in the UK, where she sells as many records as Madonna or Janet.  \\"Fever\\" could very well be the record that will put Minogue back on America's map; it's a great collection of frothy yet incredibly catchy disco tunes.  To be sure, the disc has its share of filler, but a handful of the tracks here practically flirt with perfection.  \\"Love at First Sight\\" is such a bright, perky, highly energetic disco number that has \\"single\\" written all over it, while \\"Dancefloor\\" is an infectous romp that also stands out.  \\"Burning Up\\" is an irrestible track that alternates between acoustic and straight-up disco, while the single \\"I Can't Get You Out of My Head\\" is a hypnotic song about sexual obsession.  Minogue has fallen in and out of favor with critics and audiences alike over the years, but I have faithfully followed her through all this time.  \\"Fever\\" is a strikingly good record that should give Minogue the US recognition she deserves.
0553282980|4.0|I think this book is very well written. After reading this book, you will think of a lot of things. For me personally, there were a lot of difficult English words.  There is always a tension in the story. So that means I would recommend it other readers.
0767812387|3.0|This movie is pretty good, but could be a lot better if chayanne was able to show his real talents.  If you have ever seen him in concert live or not, you know he can really move- and not just to some old-fashioned cuban folk music.  Besides, he is Puerto Rican, and the movie should have set in PR where Chayanne lived all this life.  I saw his house but I couldn't get through the gate.  I sent him a letter but it came back. Get this vid, but see him live or on TV!  He is HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0553282980|3.0|I have found it a very good book.

0446525537|5.0|Every April, Landon Carter always remembers the last year in Beaufort High School. It was 1958, when he dated a girl or two and even admitted he had been in love. But the last person he could ever fall in love with is Jamie Sullivan, the daughter of the town's Baptist minister. She was a quiet girl who carried her Holy Bible along with her shcool books daily. She seemed to be content living in a world different from the other teens. She was so innocent and certainly no boy ever asked her out. Landon would never dream to go out with Jamie. When the homecoming dance arrived, Jamie was asked by Landon and and that moment had changed Landon's life forever. Being with Jamie showed him the depths of a human's heart and lead him to a road so stunning that it would right away send him to manhood. To me this book was a unforgettable novel that tells a relationship about two couples has an everlasting love that nobody can break!
0553282980|4.0|I find the book very good and interesting. It shows from the real life. Then the book deals about boys who are in a private school. This school is very strict, traditional and is for discipline. This boys become good friends and ground a secret organization &quot;the dead poets society&quot;. The book is very emotional since you know a lot about every boy, their characters, wishes and their problems.
B00005V1Z0|2.0|The action scenes were okay at best but the plot is awful.  Overhyped movie.  Rent it at Blockbuster Video only if your friend is paying.
0553282980|4.0|**** Good book!<BR>I find it a very good book. It's interesting to read. The book goes about a school. And the four pillars of the school are: \\"Tradition! Honor! Discipline! Excellence!\\" But there's a teacher, whose name is Mr. Keating, and he taught his students that every one should care about himself and that they should size life (carpe diem) I think the book shows that if we want something really bad  then we have to fight for that with all our might.
B00005QDW5|5.0|It's difficult to sum up a vast career of excellence such as that of Pink Floyd in a three hour, two-disc compilation, but this compilation does as good of a job as one would hope for.   From &quot;Arnold Layne&quot; to &quot;Comfortably Numb&quot; to &quot;Keep Talking,&quot; Echoes gives an excellent overview.  It's almost a concept album in itself considering it has been mixed so that the songs blend with each other between tracks (a'la Dark Side of the Moon) so that it's almost a continuious symphony of sound.  In conclusion, this album makes an excellent effort at introducing the many facets of the Floyd to the public.

0451191153|5.0|The essence of The Fountainhead is that a). There is a creative individualist with integrity. b). There are people who resent the creative individualist and go through great lengths to bring them down. This happens not only in this book but everyday in the real world. Ask yourself a simple question. Why are such unreasonable and painful things happening to me at my office? (Or at school?) How come I do my best and someone else (the most undeserving sycophant) almost always gets the credit? Is this person very persuasive, vindictive, and intimidating on one side and full of superficial charm on the other? Do you dread every interaction with this person? If your answer to these questions is in the affirmative, then you are interacting with parasytic personalities as described in &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; like Peter Keating, Ellsworth Toohey and Gail Wynand. This book will make you a lot wiser - and give you strength for your lifetime. Howard Roark will be a source of tremendous inspiration for you. To understand more about yourself and the unfairness you are experiencing, you may find many answers in the books &quot;Please understand me&quot; and &quot;Bully in sight&quot;. These books will help you take charge of your life. Good luck.

But sometimes a lynch movie can be a much needed break from all the (...) RIGHT NOW! AGREED! <BR>20. See blue velvet, wild at heart, lost highway, dune. thank you.<br />now go see it again.
0425173895|3.0|While I read this book, I found it rather, well, \\"blah.\\" The characters weren't particularily interesting, the murder wasn't anything spectacular, the setting was unoriginal, etc. The writing consisted almost entirely of dialogue. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing really BAD about this book. But it's nothing very special either. Though I must admit, the ending was fairly unpredictable. The problem was that after going over the actions of the murderer before (he/she) was found out, most of them don't make sense. (He/she) did some pretty dumb things, things which no intelligent person who had commited a murder would do. So in general, I would describe this book as \\"decent.\\" That's all. On a side note this is the first Agatha Christie novel I've read. I don't plan on reading another in the near future.
B00005JKJA|5.0|Ever notice that there are no movies like a David Lynch Movie? Lynch is in his own genre. Lynch's Mulholland Drive is unlike any other movie. Though some have tried to make movies about lost realities, or false realities, no one has ever come close to manipulating life as Lynch can. Mulholland Drive is a mystery, horror suspence love story all wrapped up in one. To those who are not familair with Lynch's work, this movie is downright weird and scary. One could say it is about the obsession of being someone you are not. Or it is about what drives you to be loved in this world. Lynch makes us truely feel for the characters, which is rare in movies today. We are on the hunt with the leading ladies to find the true identity of one and support the other in her hollywood dreams. We love the lesbian scene not because it is next to hardcore porn but because it is necessary.  <br />I won't preach to you about this being the best movie or that other movies are mindless bores in comparison, the truth is, this is a top notch, rare, hard to find, unbelievably amazing movie. the kind that truely makes you think. that's when a movie ticket price is worth it, when you bring the movie home with you and think about it. <br />Warning. This movie is weird and haunting. Many twists, and lots of bare skin. but it also has intrigue and genuine horror, not gory slice em up horror but psychological horror. It's a gem. A rare opportunity to see inside the mind of obsession and love and jelousy. Please rent it if you haven't. This is not the end all be all of movies, it's just the best one out in years...and years to come.
B0000520Q1|3.0|Road Trip is fundamentally a teen film, designed to grab the attentions of hormonal-charged teens with nothing better to do on a Friday evening than buy a pizza and rent a video...while the parents are away, of course.<br />The storyline is pretty good. Josh goes to Ithaca college in New York while his lifetime girlfriend, Tiffany, heads off to Austin, Texas to study vet. science. Of course, Josh succumbs to the temptations of the super-sexy Beth, who suggests they tape their romping on the covers (ya, that's Hollywood for you). The tape accidentally gets mailed to Tiffany and Josh and co. have three days to get to Austin to intercept the tape. As if Josh didn't have enough problems, he has to write an exam (and get a B+ or better) to stay in college. The result is a riotous road trip which culminates in a surprise ending.<br />The story in narrated by the demented 8-year resident of Ithaca, Barry (Tom Green), who uses the story as a last-ditch effort to rope potential Ithaca students into signing up at the school. We are treated to some of the less normal aspects of Barry's mentality (such as eating a mouse to entice his friend's snake to eat one). Barry makes a good sideshow for a sex-charged movie that most members of the male gender will enjoy. Not the sort of thing to win oscars though.
B000021YQV|4.0|First off, let me qualify my review by saying I don't like 'Nu Metal'.  Korn, Slipnot and the like do not have a home in my C.D. collection.  I'm an old-school guy.  Iron Maiden, Dream Theater, and old Metallica are more my speed, but once in a while there's a new band that comes along that has something new to add to the great melting pot of hard rock.  Tool is definitely one of those bands, and now add System of a Down to that short list.  The key to appreciating this disc is being truly open minded to the many sub-genres of hard rock.  S.O.A.D. is not merely a 'nu metal' band.  True, they have the heavy edge and attitude of Godsmack, but they also possess the wacky sense of humor and oddball song structures of Primus blended with the socio-political rantings of the Dead Kennedys.  Now I'm sure there are a few people out there who don't like Primus and have never heard of Jello Biafra.  That's O.K.  You might still like this album if your not expecting epic progressive rock nor pure power crunch.  This music is both explosive and dark, while also being fun fluff.  It is creative without being brilliant, but in its simplicity there is a certain amount of genius. <br />Apart from the above rant I share the feelings of many reviewers.  The singer is amazingly diverse, and the guitarist, bass player and drummer play some amazingly tight rhythm together that would make Slayer proud.  All in all, great playing and clever writing, for this style of music.<br />I can't argue with those that say that &quot;Chop Suey!&quot; is the best track on the disc.  That song pretty much has their whole bag of tricks mixed up in one package; replete with start/stop song structures and mood changes. However, after a few listens there are many songs that rate a VERY close second; including &quot;Prison Song&quot;, &quot;Deer Dance&quot;, and &quot;Forest&quot;.  <br />Frankly, I'm not sure who this music would appeal to most. I've no doubt that 'Nu Metal' fans would find the majority ofthis disc satisfying.  However, I think that if you're a fan of any kind of really intense music, you might want to check this one out.

0060254920|5.0|This book was one of my all time favorites as a child and I had a great time reading it as an adult.  The story and illutrations fill your head with crazy pictures of wild things dancing around.  As a child these wild things were a little scary looking at first but you begin to love them and sometimes wish that your room could change into one just like Max's.  You could sail away and be crazy with the wild things and not get in trouble.  This book offers so much fantasy to children, it is a great way to get their imagination going wild.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|I rushed out to get this CD... only to have to rush out again the following day and search for &quot;Moulin Rouge 2&quot;. Like the director's great ROMEO + JULIET soundtrack, it's been split into two different volumes.<br />That wouldn't be a problem if only these two CDs together contained every last note of music as masterfully as the R+J ones did so superbly.<br />The companion CD fills in such badly-needed essentials as the hilarious &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; number, but both of them STILL appear to be missing the great &quot;Nirvana/Baby Marmalade&quot; medley. Why? I have no idea considering what a great piece of work it was (maybe they couldn't pin down the rights to release that particular medley on either CD?).<br />That bit aside, the CDs simply cannot be separated. You MUST own both, not just one or the other. But the fact that neither of them have the &quot;Nirvana&quot; medley is the only reason why this isn't being given a full 5-star rating...
0440219078|4.0|I found this book to be very good for the reason that it made you think about what it means to live in a \\"perfect\\" world, and if you really want to.

I would rather have imperfections and occasional bad people than being unable to feel real emotions or know my mother loves me. A little love goes a long way, right?
B00005JIZA|5.0|BEST CD I have heard in a while!  I am addicted to this music!  Easy listening lyrics that bring you back to when music was fun to listen too.

B00005ABX0|4.0|To my ears, SMILEY SMILE remains a staggering disappointment, especially in light of the growth that had come in the preceding years.  Stoner in-jokes and an often dirge-like production cripple the non-hits on this &quot;bunt instead of a grand slam.&quot;<br />WILD HONEY is a non-pretentious and fun listen.  This was a good sound for the Beach Boys and &quot;Darlin'&quot; remains a fave.<br />Highly recommended for WILD HONEY.

0671024256|4.0|Stephen King's first bestsellers, Carrie and Salem's Lot came out when I was a teenager, and he quickly became one of my favorite writers. I'm now considerably less enthusiastic about him, but he's still a master of the horror genre and a pretty good writer overall. A good argument can be made than anyone who has sold as many books as King is qualified to give some useful tips to aspiring writers, and On Writing supports this. Fans of King will enjoy the autobiographical portion of the book. He discusses his accident of several years ago, which occured in the middle of writing this book. As for the writing advice, most of it is quite sound. Although a lot of what he says can be found in other books, we can be assured that King has actually utilized and profited from what he advocates. In my opinion, his best advice is to read a lot. Not original perhaps, but this is something that can hardly be overstated, and King really makes a good case for it. Some of his opinions on writing are, well, opinions that will not work for everyone, such as his disapproval of plotting a story. To his credit, he concedes that some of the writing flaws he points out can be found in his own books (e.g. using too many adverbs). This book should be informative and useful to King fans and writers alike.

Hopefully they will be placed in the sequel soundtrack just released.

B00005QFF1|4.0|\\"The Road Home\\" is a simple love story set in a rustic Chinese village in which the local maiden falls for the new schoolteacher.  She is instantly smitten and watches for him with beaming hopefulness and unaffected delight. <br />***  The maiden is played by Zhang ZiYi, best known for her knockout performance in Ang Lee's \\"Hidden Tiger, Crouching Dragon.\\"  \\"The Road Home\\" is an entire valentine to ZiYi.  For every second she is on, ZiYi radiates with wholesome, girlish beauty. <br />***  We hardly ever see the schoolteacher at all.  The love story hinges on Zhang ZiYi.  She devises pretenses for encountering the schoolteacher, cooks him her best dishes, and literally waits for him by the road when he's forced to take a leave of absence,.  For many a jaded viewer, this is a pathetic heroine, but her heart is truer and purer than anything Hollywood manufactures.  If you're not touched by the sight of her waiting along the road in deep snow, then there's definitely a gaping hole where your heart should be.
B00005Y1TL|5.0|This is the first CD I've picked up by Aphex Twin.  I downloaded the first song off Morpheus, and decided to buy the album because I loved the first song.  I am so impressed! Haunting, subtle sounds and vocals with tight, downtempo beats is how I would describe the album.  Some &quot;house&quot; beats, and some very original beats I've never heard before in electronic music.   If you're looking for the PERFECT after-party CD or just a CD you can close your eyes and just &quot;release&quot; to, pick this one up.  It will not disappoint.
B00005KHLV|3.0|\\"In the Mood for Love\\" is a generic title for a very detailed and atmospheric film.  Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung are neighbors in 1960s Hong Kong who discover that their spouses are having an affair.  Initially, Cheung and Leung's characters spend time together to commiserate, but gradually, they fall in love.  Determined not to be unworthy adulterers, they continually resist the impulse to be anything more than platonic.  Their emotional attachment is undeniable, however, and their love story comes to have greater meaning for them than their respective marriages.<br />***  This is a two-character study.  The faces of Cheung's husband or Leung's wife are never seen, and we hardly hear a word out of either of them.  Our attention is always drawn to the lead actors and particularly Maggie Cheung who is absolutely gorgeous in long Chinese dresses.  (She has at least a dozen or more of them throughout the movie.)  <br />***  Throughout the film, the director brings period atmosphere into the film with music by Nat King Cole (singing in Spanish), smokey rooms, rainy streets, big hairdos and thick eyeliner, and skinny ties.  It looks, sounds, and feels just right.  The editing of the scenes is also done creatively so that not all your questions or expectations are immediately gratified.  It forces the audience to contemplate the scenes and their meanings all the more carefully.<br />***  Viewers, however, may lose patience with the slow pace of the film, and the enigmatic reserve which holds the lead characters back despite their very involved relationship.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I haven't read all 600+ reviews here but, I'm surprised not to have seen any mention of Frankenstein in the one's I have read. The Pinocchio comparison is obvious since it is in the movie. Consider that in the book Frankenstein's monster laments his existence throughout the book and is last seen in an icy world just as David laments his existence and spends eons in an icy world. The monster is in many ways more human than his creator; David is more human than anyone else in the movie. When David finds the place where he was created he becomes violent and destroys his other selves. It's been awhile since I read the book but I'm sure more comparisons can be made between the two even more so than Pinnochio. I think A.I. was excellent although the ending was flawed and probably should have ended with David frozen in front of the blue fairy.
B000002MP2|5.0|When I think of &quot;Dookie&quot; my mind is immeaditly flooded with memories of my earlier years.  Back then I wasn't completly sure on what punk was...that was until Green Day came along.  I know I'm not the only one that carries this story, for many American teenagers and young kids alike were introduced to the sound through this album.  What Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind&quot; did for grunge, &quot;Dookie&quot; did for punk, it brought the genre out into the light with an album so powerful it sent shockwaves through the music world.  Many people will lash out at me for calling this a powerful album, but before you go clicking that &quot;No&quot; button try to hear me out.  Punk has always been about rebellion, anger and immaturity, and those that are true to the music not only understand it, but live it.  Now look at &quot;Dookie&quot;, it epitomizes all of those things, and makes itself more than listenable to even those who don't like punk.  Believe me I understand in the punk world once you hit it big you are considered the enemy, and if thats required then count me out.  <br />Oh there I go again on another one of my rants, where are my manners?  Honestly, &quot;Dookie&quot; is on the list for my top albums of all time, well in my lifetime that is.  Every track can honestly be named as a highlight track, so I won't tell you which ones are best, because like I mentioned, they are all great.  If you have only heard the modern Green Day, take a trip back to hear how the sound has evolved.  And if you have just been stubborn because of what everyone else said, ignore them, and listen to what these boys had (and still have) to offer.
B000002BPS|2.0|because only one song's good.
B000005S0I|5.0|These songs are more than 20 years old, and remain some of the best musical experiences around. Time has not altered their strength. Much the contrary. <br />I discovered the Cure when this album was released in France. Those were the days. Therefore, I guess I'm sort of stuck with my fond memories of these fantastic tunes, as I don't quite agree with other reviewers. To put things simply :  this first album is my favorite.<br />I remember that upon discovering this record, I thought : How did these guys manage to construct such a powerful debut ? The first tune was arresting (10:15), then it got better and better. I was amazed. They were confident enough to keep the best tunes buried inside ! <br />Sure, the Cure evolved after this first opus, they got more experimental (Seventeen seconds, my second best), onright depressing (Pornography, &quot;the black gem&quot;), or playful (Japanese whispers), and then they toyed with these ideas, fleshing them out, creating variations (Disintegration, Kiss...). But they never captured again the brilliance of their debut, this obvious display of Robert Smith's genius.<br />My guess is that Robert was disappointed with the response to his first songs, got weird, depressed, then gradually decided, I'm able to give them the tunes they want. Consequently, the Cure released  &quot;Japanese whispers&quot; and the others. I confess I listened to each one of them. But at the time I did not want to admit that I was gradually losing interest (yeah, that's right, I was getting older. But hey, I  don't dribble all over yet). <br />This first record has got it all. This IS &quot;the Cure&quot;. Any &quot;real fan&quot; should, in my opinion, listen to it. Try to forget about those &quot;synth layers&quot;. Had this first record been the succes it deserved, my guess is that the Cure would have subsequently followed a quite different path. But then again, who knows ? Art is such a mystery...  <br />So, there we are. I don't think I'm a purist. I'm glad the Cure got the immense following it rightly deserves. I don't systematically consider first albums as the best albums. But. This one is the one. Believe me. Treat yourself. Do it for Robert Smith. Whatever. THIS IS THE REAL STUFF.
B00003CXI0|2.0|Boy, this movie's dissapointing! The story's not good at all! the one thing about this movie that I like is the acting! Everyone says this is so cool. I got bored too easily. The Fellowship of the Rings is so much better, mainly because of its realisim. Harry Potter was FAR from serious! What a disgrace!
B00005OAIE|3.0|Don't let the title of my review let you believe that this is not a quality CD, it is.  I just don't see it as anything new.  &quot;Why Georgia&quot; &amp; &quot;Wonderland&quot; are both great tracks and pretty much force you to sing.  However the rest of the album leaves much to be desired.  The lyrics are dry at times and the CD starts to draw itself towards the middle, average.
0452282152|1.0|I had the cd version (trying to help pass the time on an ugly commute) and I have to admit the beginning intrigued me. I thought the writing was a little silly; the attempts at being profound in it's descriptives were a little ridiculous, but the storyline did indeed pull me in.<br />And then it just kept going and going and going and never went anywhere. I kept waiting for something to happen. I waited....and waited.... and waited. Nothing. <br />Then it ended. I was pretty irritated, to be honest. I'm glad I borrowed the thing from the library and didn't spend any money.<br />Such a brilliant concept that was wasted by a very poor writer.
0790729350|4.0|This is a good representation on the Historic rock n roll event on one DVD. It looks and sounds great. I would give it a five star but its a two sided DVD, and I hate having to turn em over. It's a must have for anyone who wants to revisit this historic event.
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|This is the first and only film score i ever bought. Perfect score to compliment a perfect movie. This simply beautiful music. Also if you havent read the book read it now!
B00000FCBC|1.0|I bought the old Garage Days EP back in the day before 'Justice'. Like all Metallica fans back then I loved it. If you must have those songs on CD then get it they're all here along with the singles we all remember such as 'Blitzkrieg' and 'Breadfan', and the rocking 'Am I Evil'. For those songs, if you must must rebuy them on CD, then by all means go ahead.<br />The rest of the 'new stuff' blows chunks. Bob Segar should personally execute the members of this band for their awful version of 'Turn the Page'. It was Spinal Tap meets The Banana Splits. Also the remade Motorhead songs made me want to vomit. If Metallica can't rock anymore, then they shouldn't try to cover the loudest band of all time. All Lars and the gang can do these days is make themselves look more and more pathetic with each passing day.<br />RIP CLIFF - Not everyone's forgotten the REAL Metallica
B000000OUJ|5.0|If Amazon let me, I could write a million words about this.  If you were crazy, you would then read my review, but really be no closer to what this album is about.   This is the best Wu-Tang album out there, without question.  A couple of things I can quantify - Gza is an amazing lyricist and emmcee;  he doesn't need to brag - the rhymes speak for themselves.  Listen to 'Killa Hills' as an example - the delivery and timing throughout are superb. The production by Rza complements the beats and delivery perfectly.  The instruments and sounds are diverse, but make up what is a whole experience.  This album is more than the sum of its parts - it is a complete work of art.  This all probably sounds ridiculous.  But this is real - Gza has stepped over a line here that very few artists manage to cross.  I'm guessing even Gza doesn't know how to cross that line again.
B00005LMBK|3.0|I'll be honest. I hate rap. But when I saw the videos to &quot;Clint Eastwood&quot;, &quot;19/2000&quot;, and &quot;Tomorrow Comes Today&quot;, I -had- to get this CD. It turned out to be an interesting mix of styles. I'd say half the CD is worth listening to, others like &quot;Gravity&quot; are like listening to nails on a chalkboard. I think the CD is good enough to buy, but I'd by it used so less money is spent.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie is sooo gorgeous,the animals are absolutely life like and the story is brilliant.The voice acting is great and the animation is some of the finest you'll ever see, best of all to me are the wolves,they steal the movie and are my personal favorites (;
0812550706|5.0|I have never before given five stars to any book that I have read and reviewed up until now. I was recommended to read this novel through a friend of mine and instantly admired the creative writing that went into making this book. <br />I could not put it down, yet because it was so splendid I didn't feel inclined to finish it either. I have never felt that way about a novel before. <BR>Why you might ask. And a due answer is of course very much applicable. <br />The reason I didn't want to leave this universe was partly due to the characterization, partly due to the plot and partly due to the subtely of how concepts and feelings of the characters and story were presented. <BR>Throughout these pages the author does not force anything upon the reader. Everything is presented logically but with an added touch of creativity that is so subtle it is hardly noticeable, rather felt. <br />There is a nice back history here that comes into play. Yet this is more of a character study then it is a book about plot (though it has a good imaginative plot as well). You walk with the main character, Ender and share all the joys and pains of life. The characters in this novel, even secondary ones leap out at you. <BR>The characterization is marvelous. You feel that these are real, breathing human beings each with their own thoughts, feelings and opinions which makes this a work of fiction an exceptional one in the field. <br />This is a highly realistic, imaginative story woven through wonderful dialogue and plot. <br />If you are inclined to enter the science fiction genre, this is by far THE best novel to show you the way to the endless possibilities of the human imagination.
0596000480|5.0|I own the third edition of this book, and bought it when I was starting to write a web-based decision support system for a very large beverage company.  I can safely say that this book, and the HTML Definitive Guide (also by O'Reilly) were critical to the success of the system.<br />I have seldom had a question about JavaScript for which I could not find the answer in this book.  I referred to it so frequently during the development of our system that it is now the most dog-eared book in my collection.  I'm going to order the fourth edition simply because this baby is ready for retirement.<br />If you are learning client-side JavaScript, by all means purchase this book.  The first half of the book is a guided introduction to the language and does a wonderful job of explaining the syntax of the language, the underlying object model, and virtually every pertinent feature of the language.  The real value, though, is in the reference, which documents every object, method, property and event of standard JavaScript.<br />Non-conformists who wish to exploit features unique to Internet Explorer will find some reference material here, but the book does try to focus on the &quot;standard&quot; features of the language, which I think is a good thing.<br />You just can't go wrong with this book.
B00005QAPH|5.0|I will leave film critique to others, although this is a very abstract almost surreal film about a director as artist and what happens when &quot;writers block&quot; sets in in middle age. The DVD is of unbelievable clarity and crispness. There is a great commentary included which helps explain much of what's going on (remember that the working title for this film was the &quot;Beautiful Confusion&quot;). The extra CD has a weird film about hippies made around the time of Satyricon, which is kind of a waste of time. There is also a bio on Rota's music and a few interviews, which are nice to have.<br />This is an extremely well packaged DVD, one of the better ones available. This DVD should set a new standard for the treatment of great classic films! (I wish all the classics were represented as well as this). I don't know exactly who the Criterion corporation are personally, but they should be congratulated on some fine preservation and presentation of great film, and 8 1/2 is one of their landmark acheivments!
B00005UQ9F|1.0|I was really looking forward to this movie; I love horror movies, esp. haunted house movies and have worked in state mental hospitals and know how very creepy they can be. I was really, really disappointed. This movie had so much potential with a great setting and a good cast. The characters were quite two dimensional and cliche. The plot was confusing at times, slow and silly. A movie can be very suspenseful without overt violence with a slow, building pace; but that's not the type of slow this movie was. This movie was a major letdown and I would recommend anyone who still has a desire to see it, wait till you get it on cable.
0451169514|5.0|I remember staying up late and listening to music while reading this.Very disturbing story.A very mature and thoughtful work.
6305165912|5.0|\\"Fargo,\\" \\"O Brother Where Art Thou,\\" \\"Raising Arizona\\"...all witty and inspired movies, sure, but I don't take the Coens too seriously as exemplars of &quot;great American vernacular filmmaking,&quot; so I prefer this very witty and inspired film to the soggy &quot;Man Who Wasn't There.&quot;  The dialogue is printworthy, the plot is loose as a goose, and its taste in music is impeccable (not only does Jimmie Dale Gilmore make a cameo, the Eagles are trashed).  This is the kind of movie that revels in odd, funny details and side alleys for their own sake.  But I love it mostly because The Dude is the richest character the Coens ever created, and Bridges gives the greatest performance the Coens were ever lucky enough to direct; larger than life and more Oscar-worthy than whoever actually won in 1998.
B000059MEK|5.0|This is the absolute greatest for any house fan.  A must-have.  Great instrumentals (aerodynamic) plus sweet vocoded vocals (digital love, one more time, harder, better, faster stronger.)  Its awesome for dancing or just listening to!
B00005UEAR|5.0|There is clearly no band that surpasses the sheer billiance of music these guys put out. Period. I am a writer of novels -- you may have read some of them -- and I listen to music as I write for endless nours on end. No music is quite so inspirational as that composed by Dream Theater. In my experince, the true depth and greatness of a composition grows with each listen. I had the chance to review this album after one listen as so many others did, but I waited a month and listened to it a couple dozen times and now return with the same five stars I would have given it then. The vocals have lost thier annoying high-range edge which plagued some of their previous efforts and the melodies on the first disc are slightly more commercial, but I like that.<br />Very strong stuff which comes from the soul. They are musicians to the bone -- I'm not sure they are capable of making bad music. Those who go on about incongruities or the like remind me of freshman students trying to tell the Noble Prize winning professor why he's stupid.<br />Buy this album. Listen to it six times. You won't be dissapointed.
0684833395|5.0|When I first opened Catch-22 I was throughly confused.  Their are a whole lot of plot threads that arise that you don't find out about until a great deal of the way through the book.  But after I got through the first 75 pages the novel began to come into picture.  <BR>Heller's book is ...funny in places and also pretty sad in others.  For people who don't find this book funny they need to lighten up.  Though the humor is far from sophisticated it's still pretty hilarious.  I loved the whole backwards name thing, Washington Irving and Irving Washington.  And how can you not laugh at Major Major Major.  General Dreedle scaring ... people by threatening to have them shot is also great.  <BR>The book can be pretty sobering too.  Yossarian is dreadfully affraid dying and when he has a nervous breakdown in the air you are watching someone unravel.  <BR>Overall this is one of my favorite books.  So if your a wise [alek]pacifist or someone who enjoys a good book, then pick this up.  If you take yourself to seriously, feel your beyond hype and all \\"classics\\" suck, then don't bother.
B00005QZWI|5.0|All right, I reviewed the limited edition accidentally (I want the limited edition, too, it's on my wish list - hint hint!)  =D  So here's the review I wrote of the limited edition, which actually was written from the normal edition I own.<br />This CD is wonderful! I ran out to the store and bought it the day it first became available, and I have listened to it for hours. I enjoyed it the first time I heard it. After watching the movie (four times &amp; counting) nearly a month later, I haven't been able to take this out of my CD player for very long (sometimes switching it for Blind Guardian's &quot;Nightfall in Middle Earth&quot; for variety).<br />Howard Shore has really captured the sweeping emotions of Peter Jackson's excellent film: from the mythic opening track &quot;The Prophecy;&quot; to the simple and delightful &quot;Concerning Hobbits;&quot; to the imperious and frightening &quot;Shadow of the Past&quot; and &quot;Treason of Isengard;&quot; to the enchantment of &quot;The Council of Elrond/Aniron;&quot; to the determination and triumph of &quot;The Ring Goes South;&quot; to the desperation and grief of &quot;The Bridge of Khazad Dum;&quot; to the weirdness of &quot;Lothlorien;&quot; to the bittersweet &quot;Breaking of the Fellowship.&quot; Enya's haunting &quot;May It Be&quot; is the perfect ending to the soundtrack.<br />My favourite bits of the soundtrack are tracks 11, 12 &amp; 13, 15, 17, 18. Shore uses very powerful choral work in several of the pieces, performed stirringly by the London Voices, The London Oratory School Schola. Edward Ross, in particular, makes &quot;The Bridge of Khazad Dum&quot; incredibly powerful.<br />&quot;Concerning Hobbits,&quot; which becomes the hobbit theme, reminds me of the hymn &quot;This is My Father's World.&quot; I think that's appropriate, because of the innocence and simplicity of the hobbits.<br />The soundtrack is made infinitely more powerful by viewing the movie. I think that's true of all movies, of course; after seeing the movie you know exactly what's happening during moments of the soundtrack. Just as there were parts of the movie that moved me to tears, there are parts of the soundtrack that nearly do so, during repeated listenings.<br />This is probably one of my top five soundtracks of all time, and it's coming close to edging out number one Gettysburg and number two Gladiator. I heartily recommend this CD!
B00000K31Q|5.0|I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!! Is a great Romantic/Comedy, more in the likeness of Pretty Woman than She´s all that, this movie is more mature than She´s all that, this movie is not just for teenagers, everyone can have a good time with it. I don´t like Julia Stiles, but she did a great job here. So if you like Romantic-Comedies, forget the TEEN Factor, you will LOVE this movie for sure.
B000003RCY|5.0|Du, Du Hast, Du Hast Mich. That song doesn't compare to all there other songs, but this album is defently there greatest. I suggest for you \\"Du Hast\\" fans to listen to songs like Du Riechst So Gut, Der Meister, Asche Zu Asche, Heirate Mich, Rammstein, Laichzeit...... awww this is point less all thier songs are way better than \\"Du Hast.\\" Also there slow songs are awsome like Mutter, Klavier, and the song with an amazing bass line Seemann. Another thing, Rammstein are the greatest intertainers in the world, not only cause there music, but because of the stage shows with fire, random explosions, some S&M fantasy stuff and increadible clothing. I suggest you to get \\"Live Aus Berlin\\" there first probly not the last live video. (...)
B00005Y228|5.0|&quot;Fever&quot; is quite simply a dance album that delivers on its promise. It takes absolutely no time to slow down for a ballad. It's one pumping track after another.<br />Kylie's breezy voice compliments the pulsing rythum wonderfully, her best vocals are heard on &quot;Your Love.&quot; She's already huge around the world, and know she finally has a chance to be heard in the US.<br />The highlights include &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head,&quot; her catchy first single which I think is an early contender for a Record of the Year nomination at next year's Grammys. &quot;Fragile&quot; is about as close to a ballad as you get, yet there is still a great groove. And &quot;Love Affair&quot; captures the spirit of a heady one-night stand.<br />It's packaged and popcorny, but delightfully so. A welcome break from the homogenious American pop sound, &quot;Fever&quot; is sure to get you dancing again and again.
1563894696|5.0|This ode to Frank Miller's \\"Year One\\", itself a noir take on Batman's early career, provides a note-perfect genre piece that should thrill anyone looking for a Batman whodunit. The story has Batman, early in his career, taking on the mob and a serial killer who strikes on holidays.  The story is drum tight through thirteen issues (350+ pages), set from Halloween to Halloween, with a poetic pacing and use of graphic tension found only in top-notch graphic novels.  Harvey Dent is heavily featured along with a young Jim Gordon.  For Batman scholars, Dent's presence alone provides a backdrop of foreboding.  <br />The usual rogue's gallery weaves through the book, including a jealous Joker, out to outdo the serial killer, a cornered, yet elegantly neurotic Riddler, and a wildly abstracted, sensual Poison Ivy, along with a little more mind-altering mayhem from the Scarecrow and Mad Hatter.  <br />What I appreciated most about Jeph [sic!] Loeb's telling is that the criminals are reduced to their elemental symbols, where a gesture or a glance conveys as much as a panel of narrated text.  The clues are perfect red herrings in the grand whodunit fashion.  Fans of Batman know bad things are going to happen when a stranger passes a rose to a character who then pricks their finger on its thorns.  Similarly, even a hardened Gotham detective shudders upon seeing a murder victim with a smile on his face. My only misgiving about this book is that if a reader wasn't acquainted with Batman and the usual Arkham cast, the subtletly of this telling will almost certainly be missed.  On the other hand, this'll be a great place to start an education. <br />Tim Sale's art is compelling.  Noir's a difficult effect to convey in comics, and it comes through beautifully in a shadowy, mostly gray and earth tone palette behind strong inking.  This cool, muted ground provides the perfect foil against which to contrast the costumed villains, ratcheting up the tension another notch.
0446608955|5.0|I read the book first, wich took me three days.  I then saw the movie right afterwards.  The movie was very disappointing.  It didn't potray the kind of relationship that Landon and Jamie really had together.  It kept out all the things a christian would do.  Like go to an orphanage, collect money and so on.... As for the movie I would have rather not have seen it.  I was so upset on how they made the movie I cried in my car before actually going on with my day.   I have never read a book so intense with feeling for another person before and for god... I have said my peace and I pray that next time Mr. Sparks writes another book that is possible for a movie write then he will not think of dollar signs and think of god and the others who actually enjoyed the story the way it was in the book.
B00005RHGK|4.0|Ok, some of you stated that our two friends should have hit the pavement as fast as possible, but I'd like to remind everyone of the &quot;car wreck&quot; theory, if you see a car wreck what do you do?  Slow down and watch every minute, even if you know you shouldn't.  Come on we are all guilty of watching someone elses pain and get some sort of pleasure from it.<br />Problem w/ other reviews that I've seen, and this is probably the main point.  It seems that the majority are upset that the movie doesn't explain the Why JC is out there killing people, where did JC come from, etc...<br />Do we NEED an explanation?  That is one of the things I liked about this movie.  Come on people, didn't you love Hellraiser when you didn't know where PinHead originated from?  Jason from Friday 13th, isn't better to know that he isn't a superior human w/ the ability to heal his body rapidly?  <br />To me, almost every horror film the first episode starts out wonderful but then sequel tries to &quot;explain&quot; the origins and it turns out to be worse and make the film 100% unbeleiveable.  Remember Highlander?  Wasn't it great NOT knowing where they originated from and that the Highlanders have been here amongst us fighting their war?  Then we are told they are space aliens sent to Earth for protection?  Really, did I NEED to know that?<br />Why must we know everything?  So what if we don't know much about JC.  That is the wonderful part of this movie, it leads one to want more, to sit through and wait for the next bit.  I do not need someone making up a past, feeding me a history, I don't care for that, if I want that, I'll watch a soap opera...<br />Cheers
B00003CWL6|1.0|Why, oh why is this movie SO OVERRATED? I dont know why, but I do know that this movie is BAD. Good acting doesnt make a good movie, you need a good script, and they didnt have one. You can tell the story in 2 minutes, so they streched it 2 HOURS!!!<BR>Is Spacey good? YES HE IS, but his character is a very simple one, a man that reaches that age where he finds himself insecure of his life, is a cliche, nothing more than that. The director does not give us a background for this, so why would you care for a character like this, and old man that really is a Cry-Baby?, well you wont care for him. And all the other characters are more cliches, but not as good acted as the one played by spacey.
0140366822|5.0|I indeed am glad I read this book.  Pollyanna's Glad Game is truly a constructive exercise.  She and her father invented the game -- which consists of always looking for something to be glad about -- after their missionary relief barrel contained not the doll that Pollyanna wanted, but a pair of crutches.  They decided to be glad they didn't need those crutches.<br />I have a question, though.  At the end, after Pollyanna is injured and can't walk, wouldn't she have been glad to have had those crutches back?
B000002J09|5.0|I always like Led Zepplein. Probably the best rock band of all time. Beatles can't come close, and the Stones. There good, but not this good. Page, Plant, Jones, and Bonham. And this is their best record. I think the best record ever!<br />&quot;Black Dog&quot; is a great bluesy track that gets your feet moving and has great musical stuff here. &quot;Rock and Roll&quot; is an awesome song that is so fast and energetic, you can't help but to drum your way through this song. &quot;The Battle of Evermore&quot; is my all-time favorite track of Zepplein's. It's got great acoustic guitars that just play off each other. Plant does a great job of singing here. This is Zepplein's at its best. &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; may be overplayed out there, but it still remains a great musical odyssey that is hard to miss. It's great stuff to listen to. &quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot; is the weakest link on this cd, but still stands above most other Zepplein songs. And stands as how good this cd is. &quot;Four Sticks&quot; is another great song. &quot;Going to California&quot; is another acoustic guitar riff that is just plain cool. A great musical track. &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; is another great song. and is beautifully written and played by these guys.<br />This CD is a must have for any cd collection.
B00005R2M3|4.0|Having only seen the video for &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot;, I was not prepared for what I found on this cd. Parents, this one is ok for younger teens-nothing objectionable here.  The lyrics are included, which I appreciated.  <br />I found Shakira's voice to be more of a cross between Jewel and the Cranberries' lead singer, not overbearing or annoying.  The music style of each song is somewhat different.  I heard things similar to Madonna, No Doubt, Ricky Martin, Donna Summer disco, and even a dash of B-52's.  &quot;Under Your Clothes&quot; is a heartfelt love song, with lyrics like '..because of you I'm running out of reasons to cry'.  The radio hit is presented in both English and Spanish, as is &quot;Objection (Tango)&quot;. &quot;Rules&quot; is a Go-Go's style poppy sing-a-long.  &quot;The One&quot; is another slower, belted out love song.  &quot;Ready for the Good Times&quot; is total dance floor disco. &quot;Fool&quot; is the Alanis Morrisette style song, great vocals here. My very favorite is the Spanish sung &quot;Te Dejo Madrid&quot;--this is a fun, joyful song, that just makes you want to jump up and down for joy and be happy. Love that one! &quot;Poem to a Horse&quot; is the No Doubt style song. I can totally see Gwen singing this one.  &quot;Eyes Like Yours&quot; sounds like it could have come from the Madonna 'Ray of Light' album--it's got an Hindu/India/sitar kind of sound, over a funky beat. Great backgound vocals on that track.<br />Overall, I really enjoy this cd, and will definitely be picking up Shakira's previous, Spanish language disks.
079284078X|5.0|Ever since seeing this movie when it first came out, back in the day...I've been hooked. Above all else, it has been my favorite and so hard to find, too. So, seeing it here is definitely a great thing for me. <br />The movie focuses on strength, both mental and physical. An internal and external battle for the leading lady, Red Sonja who battles her way to fight Queen Gedren to avenge the deaths of her brother, sister, mother, and father. Along side of Red Sonja is notorious fighter, Kalidor. With Kalidor and two unlikely heroes, Red Sonja battles through this action/adventure five-star hit movie. The story is based on the writings of Robert E. Howard, author of Conan.<br />Brigitte Nielson really plays the part incredibly. Not bad for a &quot;Rocky IV&quot; and &quot;Cobra&quot; star and ex-Stallone wife, but she certainly can take on the action role. And even more impressive was Schwarzenegger (who needs no introduction) acting along side another action star, female at that. <br />There are several other actors worth recognition for their roles in the movie: for instance, Queen Gedren, played by Sandahl Bergman whom has played many other movies, such as &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot;. Falkon, played by Paul Smith who has been seen in many films like the new release: &quot;Monsters Ball&quot;, the original &quot;Dune&quot;, 1965's &quot;The Great Race&quot; and many more dating back to 1936. Ikol, played by Ronald Lacey from &quot;Yellowbeard&quot; and &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. And let us not forget Pat Roach (Brytag) seen in an array of movies including all three Indiana Jones, &quot;Kull the Conqueror,&quot; &quot;Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves,&quot; &quot;Conan the Destroyer,&quot; and &quot;Clash of the Titans.&quot;<br />With this ensemble cast, how can you go wrong with the movie?
B00000JQFM|1.0|granted a very \\"skilled\\" guitarist but i cant appreciate the melodies the playing or anything about the songs. this cd [is bad]. maybe he should learn to not play the guitar. he doesnt seem to understand the concept of silence which is as crucial to a good song as the notes are. there will always be guitar players that rely on flash to win over an audience and this is definitely one of them. put this in the trash...
B00005RHGK|3.0|It's a nineties horror movie, strike one.<BR>It's called Jeepers Creepers, strike two.<br />Surprisingly, the the actual movie only fouls on the third pitch, and makes it worth spending a couple of bucks.<br />I was pleasantly surprised by the first half of the film, in which we get glances and hints of a scarecrow-like murderous monster with a highly tricked out truck.  There are great thrills and scares through about half the movie and then it descends into Jurassic Park 3 type suspense and action.  The monster is scarier when you don't see him.  The acting is right on, not only with the protagnosits, but as well by Patricia Belcher as psychic Jezelle and Eileen Brennan as the Cat Lady.  If you're looking for some contemporary horror that escapes a lot of the cliches of 90s slasher flicks, check this out.
6304711883|4.0|Ransom showcases Melvin Gibson in more of an acting role than do many of his past films, and the theater lessons he has been taking are apparent in this fine mystery/drama.  He occasionally frowns as he talks, his delivery being far more low-key than in, say, Lethal Weapon -- when his acting consisted of coupling dialog with lots of wild facial expressions and eye-rolling.  It's obvious that Melvin employs what he learns; in his next film, Conspiracy Theory, he combined the tight frowning from Ransom with the wild stuff from Lethal Weapon, and ascended another rung on the Acting Ladder.  It has been a pleasure to watch Melvin Gibson work and strive, these past two decades, to become an accomplished film actor.  Melvin is beginning to make encouraging progress, and it is apparent that, at some point in some future movie, he will actually act -- he ALMOST did so, in \\"Signs\\" -- and grow to be more than just a pretty face.
B000002U82|5.0|This CD upon release was a disaster it didn't even reach platinum status which most rockers usually think as a succesful album. Over time though this little gem has gotten word of mouth reviews and has spread like a wildflower. Now it's one of the best selling albums of all time! It's also one of the best albums of all time.<br />It's the best comprenhensive album ever- meaning you can listen to it from beginning to end as if it were meant to be that way. And maybe that's what these guys did on purpose. The only track that seems out of place is &quot;Money&quot; it's a great track but somewhat distracts from all the other tracks on this album. &quot;Speak to Me/Breathe&quot; is a great intro to this Cd and it just keeps on going. Each track a different type of song, but all somewhat carrying on the ideas and emotions from the track before. It's great. Pink Floyd did such an awesome job of piecing this album together and playing. I have heard about &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; thing, but have never tried it. I don't really want to distract myself from the music in all honesty. I think it's bogus though that the wrote this while watching the movie. I just don't see that being likely. This is rock music. Not a soundtrack. And it's one of the best rock albums of all time. And one of the best musical albums as well.<br />Get a copy today- you won't be disappointed.
0694003611|1.0|I don't see what all the fuss is about over this book.  It's rather stupid, really.  If you want a really good bedtime book, try Pajama Time by Sandra Boynton.  The kids love it!
078322687X|5.0|This is it. The film that started the teen flick phenomenom. Granted, Sixteen Candles came before this, but it never made it like The Breakfast Club did. In years to come we'd see other great teen flicks like Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Weird Science, Pretty in Pink and the modern, gross out movies of the nineties, such as Road Trip and American Pie. But it was The Breakfast Club that started it all off. <br />It's part of pop culture, influencing in many films and referenced in hundreds of others. If you only buy one movie this year, get a life. If you buy several, make sure this is one of them. It's a movie that needs to be in your collection. <br />From Judd Nelson's sarcastic Bender, to Molly Ringwald's prom queen princess Claire, the cast are a shining example of the Brat Pack, and make the whole film flow together and make it easily watched. It's believable and has a great soundtrack. John Hughes did a bang up job of writing and directing (not to mention producing) this coming of age teen comedy drama. This movie is not to be missed. Go on, treat yourself.
B00000JGHM|3.0|This is an amazing movie.  I really don't need to go in to the details, since if you haven't heard about Heat already, you probably never will.<br />What I like to focus on is the audio quality of this movie.  This is the first DVD that I purchased for my DVD player.  I appreciate the Dolby Digital soundtrack, and it is one of the better ones that I have heard, but I would love to hear this with a DTS soundtrack.  I couldn't imagine watching the bank hold-up scene with the expanded range that DTS provides!<br />I would however reccommend this movie, despite it's not having the DTS.  It does well with Dolby Digital.  And you won't be dissapointed.
0440219078|5.0|I first read this book when i was in 5th grade. Im a lot more mature than other kids were at that age so for recommendations, it depends. Im sure its ok for 8th graders and up. Totally good book. I loved it! I have read it probably 50 times, but havent lately. ill have to read it again to see what all the controversy is about. i didnt think anything was wrong with it. the end left me hanging, but i like that. it was good.
B00003CXXP|4.0|A.I. is science fiction without the obligatory fight scenes every five minutes.<br />This movie is, essentially, a simple tale of an artificial boy named David (Haley Joel Osment) who yearns to be accepted as a real son by his mother.  Early on in the movie he is cast away from the mother that he knows and spends the rest movie trying to find a way to become \\"real\\" so that she will accept him back.  Along the way he becomes unlikely friends with Gigolo Joe (Jude Law), another mecha, who helps him search out the answers for which he seeks.  <br />Haley Joel Osment once again showcases his tremendous acting abilities and shows that he'll not go down the road taken by others such as Macaulay Culkin. Jude Law also does an incredible job bringing life to his character.  Last, but not least... Spielberg does a fantastic job bringing Kubrick's dark vision of society to the screen.<br />A.I. has been much maligned by reviewers for many different reasons.  I believe, however, that the poor reviews come because the movie was marketed to that masses.  This was a mistake.  A.I. is not going to appeal to anyone looking for a movie that has a fast pace and will keep them from having to think for a few hours.  This movie is a slow, well thought out story.  If you enjoy being pulled into a movie rather than just watching it then this is for you.  If you want sci-fi with a kick then pop Star Wars into the player and become a potato.<br />A.I. is definitely worth adding to the DVD/Video library.
B00002Z88D|5.0|The guy before me who said this was a wall of sound got it spot on. This is how music should be - meticulous in its crafting and wrought with power and emotion. Metallica are a live band and this cd is probably the best example of that, as well as being one of the most stunning examples of musicianship on the planet.<br />If you are thinking about picking up a guitar or trying your habd at your own music, these guys are the masters. I still can't believe that kirk hammett solo's are even possible! and JH puts the sort of energy into music that reminds me that we can all tolerate the legions of simpletons who support &quot;acts&quot; like the Back Passage Boys and other such disposible nonsense. <br />A stunning example of music
B0000542DJ|5.0|Oliver Stone, to say the least, is one of the most controversial directors in film history. Many see him as a dangerous loose cannon who rewrites history to fit his own agenda. I see him as a filmmaker who has the guts to speak his mind on controversial subjects -- even when his point of view flies in the face of \\"conventional\\" wisdom.    Nowhere is this more true than in JFK. Despite the fact that a large majority of Americans believe that President Kennedy was assassinated as the result of a conspiracy, the media lambasted Stone for his interpretation of the events of November 22, 1963. Various journalists and columnists called Stone everything from a revisionist historian to a crackpot when the film was released. To be sure, New Oreleans Disctrict Attorney Jim Garrison wasn't the knight on a white horse of Stone's film -- his investigative tactics were very shady. Garrison mysteriously did not investigate possible mob connections to the assassination. And Stone does implicate almost everyone, including Presidents Johnson and Nixon, J. Edgar Hoover and almost the entire Dallas Police Department.    However, Garrison is merely a catalyst for Stone's thesis as the only person who ever indicted a suspect (Clay Shaw) in the murder of John F. Kennedy. And even with its myriad of conspriacy theories, the sad fact remains that Stone's interpretation is much closer to the truth than the Warren Commission Report. We can, for example, see on the Zapruder film that JFK is suddenly and violently slammed backwards and to the left by the shot to his head, indicating a firing position from the front and not from the Texas School Book Depository where Lee Harvey Oswald was. Most Americans don't believe that Oswald, who, at the height of the Cold War, defected to Russia with the intention of passing on U.S. Government secrets, married a Colonel's daughter, then somehow regained his U.S. citizenship and returned to the U.S., was just the \\"lone nut\\" the Warren Commission claimed hewas. And most Americans don't believe that Jack Ruby killed Oswald merely to \\"spare Jackie Kennedy the trauma of having to return to Dallas for Oswald's trial.\\" In spite of this, however, the media jumped all over Stone's film, lambasting him as loose with the facts and irresponsible.    Stone does in JFK what the Constitution gives Americans the right to do -- namely question authority when the answers it gives us do not satisfy and enlighten. I don't think that the media was part of the plot. But the media does act as a unwitting aid to the conspirators when they whitewash the work of an Oliver Stone as the work of a crackpot. Perhaps the media collectively does not have the courage to risk its reputation or maybe they are frustrated and angry that they didn't dig deeper at the time of the assassination. Whatever the reason, they do no service to either the people of the United States or the truth when they issue their blanket dismissals of JFK and other films like it. I agree that Stone should be held accountable for any inaccuracies in his films. However, the press should be held just as accountable when they back the utterly useless Warren Commission version of the Kennedy assassination. Gerald Posner can shout \\"CASE CLOSED\\" all he wants from the highest mountain top, but the questions and the doubts remain.    Last June I visited Dallas, Dealey Plaza and the Texas School Book Depository. To say it was an eerie experience was an understatement. Most of the museum on the sixth floor (where Oswald allegedly fired from) was dedicated exclusively to the assassination. However a large portion of the museum was dedicated to President Kennedy's life and administration. Almost as heartbreaking as the memories of his assassination and funeral were the reminders of all the hope and potential that was snuffed out on November 22, 1963. JFK brings back the pain and anguish of not only the assassination, but America in the years after John F. Kennedy's assassination. Thank you, Oliver Stone, for showing us what we lost and for inspiring us to demand the truth.
B000002GJ7|5.0|Extreme II: Pornograffitti was released at an akward time in music. Guns N' Roses was at their pinacle, and it was their success that spurned the 80's hair spray band revolt that culminated with Nirvana's rise to power and \\"Heavy-Metal\\" being replaced with Grunge.    Extreme was a band caught in the cross-fire of this cultural revolution. They were drastically better musicians that most everyone that came out in the 80's yet they were still too closely related to that passing sound to survive in the 90's.    Nuno Bettoncourt's guitar work on this album is breath taking. Gary Cherone's (3rd and now former lead singer for the mighty Van Halen) intelligent, yet poppy lyrics and fantastic singing style are equally impressive.    EVERY SONG on this album is superb. There's no filler here, folks! Truly one of the best, and least respected bands and albums.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|This film is one of those that stays with you. Whether it's the music or the camera shots, whether you love it or hate it (and there's no middle ground), this is a memorable film. It's perfect for those of us who remember watching old musicals with our parents (or you were the parents) and have wondered for years why they weren't made any more. Plus it's so lush-the colors, the fabrics, the whole feel (yes, very Bohemian in a way). The soundtrack is a must-own and the dance sequences are amazing.
6305807086|4.0|I want to go on record with how much I love this movie. Originality,surprise,wit and good acting.  John Cusack&quot;s perfomance was fine, but it was Catherine Keener who blew me away! Want a refreshing diversion from overproduced Hollywood drek?  This is it.

B00003CWL6|5.0|I sat down with my copy of American Beauty last night and watched the film again for the first time in almost a year.  The older I get, the better this film gets and the more realistic it becomes.  When the film was first released, critics raved about how unique the characters were, but I disagree.  For every character in that film, I have known at least one person upon whom it could have been based.  Because of that, I feel like I actually know the characters.  Instead of being an outside observer, I feel almost like part of the action because the characters' behavior and emotional dysfunction is so very familiar to me.  Anyone who grew up in middle class America will probably know what I'm talking about.  The DVD itself is exquisite.  I don't know how they managed to cram all of that onto a single disc, but my hat is off.  The picture quality was vividly real, the sound was amazing, and the movie is as utterly engaging now as it was when I saw it the first time, about two years ago.  If you don't own it already, what on earth are you waiting for?
B00003CX8T|5.0|was what we were brought into by the magical 4 four movies that well all know so well--The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King.  What sets Aladdin apart from the other 3 is its all-out comedy paired with exquisite romance, action and mystique.  We were all awed by The Cave of Wonders...the genie's far-out and hilarious antics, and a story of a boy in a Cinderfella type of tale; rags to riches.  Jasmine fights for her RIGHT to choose to whom and when she will be married...and a genie longs for freedom A very touching movie that truly deserves its placement in the Platinum Edition series begun with Snow White--Aladdin should be on 2 discs filled with bonus features and completely restored.  I'm expecting quite a treat when it is released...  <br />This movie will touch you, entertain you...and teach you.
B000001IPL|4.0|Smash is by no means a modern masterpiece. However, it is an above average punk/metal/pop hybrid album that was lucky enough to be released after Green Day's Dookie broke through to the mainstream. Newly converted fans of Green Day were looking for similar bands, and Offspring delivered. Smash gained its popularity on the strength of its 3 incredibly catchy singles (just try and keep Come Out and Play out of your head)that were well suited to alternative radio stations and MTV. The rest of the album is solid, blending metal-inspired riffs with punk attitude. Pick up Smash and relive the days when alternative rock was king.
B00005221L|5.0|GREAT SPECIAL EFFECTS.GOOD PLOT.THE PREDATOR ITSELF IS ABSOLUTELY [great].I AM A VERY BIG PREDATOR FAN, AND I OWN AT LEAST 85 PREDATOR COMICS. IF YOU LIKED THE MOVIE, THEN I SUGGEST COLLECTING THE PREDATOR/ALIEN VS. PREDATOR COMICS.
B00004X01U|3.0|This is easily Madonna's worst ever album, even worse than Like A Prayer.  The lyrics are practically retarded, and her latest effort to reinvent herself yet again seems slapdash at best.  As a native Texan, I can't really accept the idea of an Italian from Michigan wearing a cowboy hat...it looks stupid.  The cover art is like modern trailer trash meets Roy Rogers...it borders on the offensive.  \\"Music\\" is Madonna's worst-ever single, and unfortunately it was extremely popular in the UK; you couldn't escape it.  To hear Madonna sing about \\"music\\" when she's asking Mr. DJ to put a record on is pants-wettingly funny in its contrived horror.  The only good song on the album is Don't Tell Me, which interestingly blends guitar with thumpy beats, though deejays here made a mockery of its full stops, often leaving five to ten seconds between them.  This album was definitely a step in the wrong direction and has thrown Madonna way off-course in her quest for musical maturity.  Someone should remind her she's well over 40 now.
B00005R2M3|5.0|This is a great CD! Shakira is truly talented.  Her sound is very unique -- each song has its own flair and the lyrics are a lot of fun.  If you like singing along, this is a great CD for it!
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is one of the most innovative films I've seen in such a long time. It is certainly worthy of the Oscar nod for best Scrrenplay. The films story and pacing may be unusual, but they are necessary to tell the story from the protagonist's point of view. And that is what life is all about. Point of view. We create our own realities.
B00005QDW1|5.0|it rocks out - hard - and continues No Doubt's steady movement into phenomenon.  Don't expect the same old, same old, warmed up and served in an effort to create a commercial success.  'Rock Steady' is a move from No Doubt's ska-punk past into experimentations with grooves and new sounds, without completely forgetting their roots.  It's new, it's edgy, and it's utterly different!  Fresh and exciting, 'Rock Steady' offers the hit first single, 'Hey Baby' plus an assortment of other tracks that together, blend rock, hip-hop, new wave, and talent into a must-have album!
B00000IAU3|3.0|The biggest hit from this album was the single &quot;Thank You,&quot; which incidentally pre-dated the album's release by a good three years.  The song was hand-picked for the closing credits of the 1997 film &quot;Sliding Doors,&quot; and appeared on that film's far superior soundtrack.  The song was not re-recorded for this album, and it makes you wonder how much of the album was actually recorded way back in 1997.  Dido can undoubtedly write good music, but I think she is more of a Carole King, i.e. someone that can write great songs but shouldn't sing them.  Her voice is absolutely terrible.  When she sings live, this becomes obvious....Dido could not carry a tune even if it had handles.  Her tuneless wailing ruins many of the better songs on the album, and the others sound like they were carelessly banged out while she was doing something else...reading, making love, or watching television.  In any case, she doesn't have near the vocal talent of Sarah McLachlan, to whom she is far too often compared.
B00003CX95|5.0|Mel Gibson took not only a page, but a whole chapter out of David Lean's book when he directed this. The cinematogrophy is nothing short of brilliant. The sweeping shots of the Scotland countryside, the beautiful fields, the mountains, the forests, etc... are breathtaking. There hasn't been anything like it since Lawrence of Arabia. A bold statement perhaps, seeing as there have been many films made between 1962 and 1995, but I feel confident in making it.<br />Moving on, the actual story in this movie is riveting. It follows the life of a Scottish man named William Wallace (interestingly enough, the script was written by Randal Wallace, a descendent of the real-life main character) who starts a rebellion against England to win Scotland's freedom after an English lord kills his wife. <br />The battle scenes in this movie are the most graphic you will have ever seen. And I'm including SPR. It says on the back of the DVD box that this was rated R for \\"brutal medieval warfare\\" and it sure as hell isn't kidding. You see people getting shot with arrows, smashed with what looks to be a twenty pound sledge hammer, hacked with swords, stabbed through with spears, and on and on. The worst part for me, though, was when it showed the English lord's throat being slit. For some reason, I just can't stand to see that. It makes me rub my neck and grimace everytime I watch it. I can stand all the other stuff just fine, though. Go figure... Anyway, this isn't one of those movies you watch with your ten year old. <br />The DVD is okay, but nothing real special. The documentary is one of those 25 minute things that is half promotional. You get to see a little about how Mel directed it, and how the battle scenes were shot, but it really leaves something to be desired. The commentary is pretty good, though. It's just Mel, talking about the movie. It's interesting, and that alone makes it better than a lot of commentaries. Overall, you get the feeling that there is a special edition DVDlurking in the future. A movie of this magnitude simply deserves more than a trailer, a commentary, and a little promotional \\"documentary\\". So, if you truly love this movie, get it now. The sound and picture are simply astounding, and it does have some extras, but if you can wait, I suggest you do. You don't want to have to shell out money for this and then do it again when the SE comes out. But hey, I did it.
B00005RHGK|5.0|If you're looking for a movie that will make  you wonder and make you think &quot;Jeepers Creepers&quot; is one of the first really good attempts at a full fledge horror movie for the new millennium please take your mind away from normal everyday Hollywood clich and try this one Sure there were some questions left in the viewers mind at the end, but think about it....don't all movies leave unanswered questions?<BR>I think that this movie deserves a lot more credit than it has been receiving
B000002U82|5.0|Well, is there possibly anyone out there who doesn't know about &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot;; how classic it is, and how it takes us to another place? I seriously doubt it; but just incase, here goes: I think it can really go without saying, from start to finish, this is one the best(if not the best)albums in rock history. These songs paint so perfectly the harsh realities of modern life. Not only do the brilliant words by Roger Waters pull this off, but the alluring, shadowy music does this just as well. What are the highlights? Well, a better question would be, what isn't? I will say that my particular favorites are &quot;Time&quot;, along with &quot;On The Run&quot;, &quot;Us And Them&quot;, and &quot;The Great Gig In The Sky&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; perfectly captures the stages of life; in the beginning, feeling as though we have forever to build our dreams, to the angst of slowly realizing that it's all slipping through our hands, and whether or not we've seen our plans through, it's going to end. The bewildering &quot;On The Run&quot; is the perfect lead in for &quot;Time&quot;; while &quot;The Great Gig In The Sky&quot; contains some haunting, inticing music, that tells a story of it's own. As for &quot;Us And Them&quot;, this actually was the first song to really pull me into this album, and what can really be said about it, just a timeless classic. Anyway, if there actually are some people out there who are just now discovering Pink Floyd, this album, along with &quot;The Wall&quot; and &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; are great places to start.
B00005Y228|5.0|Forget Madonna, Brittney, and Christina.  Kylie completely outshines them with this CD.  (She did on Light Years too but that is another review).  Kylie is a wonderful pop artist who has a keen ear at finding and writing some of the best pop songs to ever come out.  She does just that with this album.  EVERY SONG is a winner!!!  There are no filler songs on this album.  Hopefully, this is the CD that will catapult Kylie to stardom.  That should have happended a long time ago, but that is sure to happen now with this terrific CD.  BUY IT NOW!!!!  You won't be disappointed.
0790731002|2.0|I'm giving this two instead of one star because Nicole Kidman is in it, but even SHE couldn't bring any life to the insipid script, contrived scenes, and lackluster characters.  The best character in the whole schlocky mess is Alfred, and it probably would have IMPROVED this wretched movie if he made like the old TV show and put on the Batsuit.<br />The attempt to combine gothic noir with headache-inducing flashiness AND grade-school humor fails miserably, but I ask you, what ELSE would result from such an idiotic combination, and in an ACTION movie no less?!<br />What a terrible, terrible movie.  I think it managed to barely be better than Batman and Robin, but that's not even an accomplishment, more a necessary law of nature...
0425173755|5.0|Poirot does it again. In this novel, Agatha Christie has out done herself tremendously. This novel is the definitive detective novel. A clever novel engages the reader to think ahead to solve the crime with all the clues thus presented. It does not need to resort to bang-bang action to keep the reader's attention. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. I recommend this with 5 STARS!
B00005RJ1U|4.0|Jeepers Creepers (Victor Salva, 2001)<br /><br />I think that, with the arguable exception of Battlefield Earth, I haven't heard so much negative press about a movie in the past decade as I did about  this one. No idea why. This is one of the better horror movies to come out of Hollywood in quite a while, and Victor Salva has finally lived up to the promise that's kept Hollywood allowing him to make bad movies on a fairly  regular basis for the past decade and a half.<br /><br />The story opens with a brother and sister team, Derry (Justin Long, from the TV series Ed) and Trish (Gina Phillips, who recently had a turn on Boston  Public and shows up next year in The Anarchist's Cookbook), driving across the state on their way home from college for spring break. On a secluded stretch of highway, a strange truck menaces them before roaring past. A few miles  down the road, they see the truck's driver dumping something that looks suspiciously like a body wrapped in a sheet down a large pipe, and after he drives away they stop to investigate. Complications ensue.<br /><br />The movie's probably not going to win any awards for its acting, writing, or cinematography, all of which fall into the slightly-above-average category.  But then, this isn't a movie with Oscar aspirations anyway. It's supposed to be a fast-paced slick little horror film, and that's what it is. Salva achieves the right balance between showing the nastiness and cutting away to let  suggestion do the work, and also uses the suggestion technique with his bad guy most of the time (something that hasn't been seen too much in films for a while). Add in a Miss Cleo-esque psychic (Patricia Belcher), a few hick cops who  actually break stereotype a few times, and a fun bad guy (Jonathan Breck, from the painfully bad film Spiders), and you've got a fine little flick. *** ½

This book made me laugh sooo many times for many reasons.  The situations she gets herself into really are hysterical.  And her spending is really out of control.  I oculd really related to her, ahem, &quot;shopping problem&quot;.<br />Its just such a light hearted novel with a great storyline and hilarious dialogue.  I'm so glad that they made a sequal.  I read this in about 4 days and was glad that I could go and buy the second one!
B00005ASOC|5.0|Words fall short of describing this box office masterpiece.  As I observe many new revelations as I endlessly repeat my viewings of this movie, i cant help but be shocked beyond speaking.  Casting, Directing, Plot - all fits perfectly together like a chinese picture puzzle.  I now feel a surge of energy running from my brain, through my arms, and into my fingertips allowing me to type this small insignifigant piece compared to this tremendous movie....
6304233639|4.0|A lot of people beforehand have slated this movie for lack of plot or over-reliance of special effects.  However, the joy of 'Independence Day' is precisely that - it never pretends to be anything else.  As pure escapist fun it's the top of its range.  The premise is childishly simple: have a group of alien ships hover over the world's great cities and watch how the humans react.  Not only is this an alien movie that takes advantage of the 'X-Files' phenomena but it's also a disaster movie, with there being a cross-section of America reacting to the events around them.<br />The acting is surprisingly good whilst remaining thankfully low-key.  Smith especially shows his star potential, and can obviously carry a movie by himself.  Around him are the more seasoned actors such as Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman as the president.  The special effects are mind-blowing and the creators obviously had a lot of fun making the movie, although at times melodrama does threaten to sink everything.  What's perhaps most cloying though is its blatant vision of a world crisis that only affects America and one that only America can combat.  However, the hoky message about human spirit is tongue-in-cheek and this is a cut above most blockbusters.

Oh man, I would not even try to live vicariously through these guys, I was worn out just reading of their exploits!!!<br />The book does more than just detail the party times of the Crue, it delves into candid,personal aspects; detailing the good, bad, and ugly of their collective careers and private lives.  Believe it or not, there are moving, poignant moments in the book that reveal the gentlemen of Mootley Crue to be, ta da, human!<br />If Tipper Gore ever thought the lyrics of Motley Crue were outrageous...she'd wet her pants over this book.  I guess it should be labeled, 'The Dirt, Do Not Try This At Home.\\"

B00005Y228|5.0|The disco diva does it again! The music is sultry, sexy and fun, just like Kylie herself. With the first beat of \\"More, more, more\\" you definitely want more Kylie and boy do you ever get it. \\"Love at First Sight\\" gives you an optimistic \\"new day\\" feeling that can brighten any mood. By the time you hit \\"Can't get you Out of My Head\\" you're deep into the dance groove and mesmerized by the beat. I dare you try sitting down when listening to that one. The 80's, pop flare of \\"Fever\\" gets a hold of your brain and may remain there for several days. \\"Fragile\\" is the closest you'll come to a ballad on this album, but that is due more to the sensitivity and emotion of the music and lyrics than the actual beat which has quite a fast tempo. \\"Butterfly\\" is the perfect addition to the US album since the fast, dance beat with flute accents will leave you on a high that will last well after you are through listening (that is, if you don't have the cd on repeat). Kylie's delivery is always dripping with such sincere sensuality and frolicking fun that no mass-manufactured, teen, pop princess can come close to her authenticity. \\"Fever\\" is fun, dance pop and a must have in any pop fan's collection!! Kylie's music lights a fire under you... that makes you unable to sit still. For all those new to Kylie, try it out and you will get hooked!!

B00005YW4H|5.0|Like a pair of old jeans, Norah Jones just makes you feel at home.  Although she's signed to a jazz label, NJ is more Joni Mitchell than Nina Simone, and her voice, though raw and young, has a rich, refreshing honesty that seduces purely with its simplicity and lack of pretention.  Her piano playing is unassuming and tasteful, and seems content with its supporting role in the ensemble.  While Jones's own songwriting has yet to reach the same level as the rest of the album (and most noticeably, that of her guitarist, Jesse Harris and bassist Lee Alexander), she successfully navigates a warm and relaxed set, perfect for late night listening.
0440219078|5.0|First, in order to enjoy Lois Lowry's \\"The Giver,\\" you must understand, even if vaguely, the world in which the novel takes place; it is still Earth, but its society is utterly strange--despite the fact that this world is pain-free, no poverty, no illness. This is one of the novel's best qualities: it allows us to see how odd a world with no hardship is, compared to our society.<br />In \\"The Giver,\\" Lowry follows Jonas, yet another citizen in this utopian society; here, your entire life, your entire future is planned for you...imagine the strictest yet most peaceful communist, totalitarian government (an oxymoron), combined with Orwell's \\"1984.\\" Speakers and monitors surround everyone's living center, so \\"they\\" can observe whenever the citizens mandatorily discuss their dreams. There is no such thing as birthparents; when you're born (or rather given birth by \\"birthmothers,\\" which is an official profession) you are assigned to a family. There are not even any cars, everyone rides bicycles.<br />Jonas' birthday is coming up. Every citizen has the same birthday, and everyone is given a designated gift on each birthday; for instance, when everyone is seven, they get a bike; and when they turn twelve, they are given their job...for life. Jonas is estranged from his friends when he is given the job of Receiver of Memories.<br />He is tutored by the town's current Receiver, a weak old man only known to us as the Giver. In this experience, Jonas is given a gift that no one else in this society has--the gift of knowing freedom, true freedom. The gift to heal and cope with pain (something Jonas was alienated to), the gift of knowing family, the gift of seeing the world...as it should be.<br />With this newfound knowledge, Jonas' desire to leave and to find a place where humanism exists, to save someone from this society, continues to haunt him.<br />\\"The Giver\\" is another one of Lois Lowry's crowning acheivements, winner of the 1994 Newberry Medal. This book is not to be looked over and placed into the shelf with no further attention; \\"The Giver\\" is brilliant, and is not only to be read, but to be deciphered.nd placed into the shelf with no further attention; \\"The Giver\\" is brilliant, and is not only to be read, but to be deciphered.

George is the small and smart guy who gets the jobs for him and Lenni, and Lenni is the big, strong and a bit slow guy who always ends up in trouble. The novel is about theire incredible frienship and the dream they share about getting theire own piece of land....! George acts like a big brother for Lenni and he feels some kind of responsability towards him. Lenni is the kindest guy ever and he never means to do anything wrong, but in the end of the book he makes a big mistake wich is fatal in more than one way....! I really liked this book because it said something to me, about friendship, never giving up dreams and so many other things. John Steinbeck is an exelent writer. +
B00005YW4H|4.0|With her remarkable singing, solid piano chops, and lovely visage, I predict Norah Jones will have the same kind of impact as Diana Krall has had. Their singing styles are completely different -- in fact, the way Norah sings reminds me more of Billy Holiday (in timbre) or even Janis Joplin (in soulful expressiveness) -- but they share an interpretive gift and a level of self-assuredness. One other difference is that Norah does write a few of her own songs, where Ms. Krall is strictly a covers artist (albeit a great one). In fact, a tune Norah wrote called \\"Nightingale\\" is one of the CD's highlights. Her voice subtly and gracefully floats through the tune like the subject bird, and her piano lines are equally subdued and beautiful. Come Away With Me is one the best debut CD's I've heard in a long time -- and you can't beat the price!

I adore this movie so much that when I read a bad review I feel almost offended!<BR>How could anybody not be captivated by such a masterpiece?<BR>I have to say, Moulin Rouge was so refreshing after such dull films as The English Patient! And I cannot believe that the movie didnt recieve as many complementary reviews in the U.S as in the U.K, us Brits loved it!<BR>The film was a mix of colour, music and the eye candy known only as Ewan McGregor! He brought to the movie a heartfelt performance that affected everyone in teh cinema around me. <BR>Who can forget crying until sodden in tears at the end of the movie....<BR>A final breath, 'The show must go on'
0805062971|5.0|After watching a great movie called &quot;Fight Club&quot;, I was amazed.  I was determined to find out how such an idea came to a man.  I thought I would start my journey by reading the book.  I could have never accounted for what lay inside it's rigid spine.<br />The story centers around an insomniac whose life becomes meaningless.  Going through life half asleep and half awake, he meets regularly with a terminally ill support group for aid in sleeping.  The action begins when he meets a man named Tyler Durden on a business trip.  Upon returning home, he finds his condo blown to bits.  His only choice then becomes to call his new friend, Tyler, for shelter.  After a few drinks in a bar, Tyler and the main character begin to fight for fun.  This comes as amusment to the both of them and begin doing it on a regular basis.  Slowly the main character slips into the realm of empathy.  He begins to ignore his job and personal belongings on his trip to hitting rock bottom.  The friendly fighting between Tyler and the main character develops into a club, a fight club.  On every Saturday night, men meet to beat each other senseless.  As the story moves on, the fight club evolves into something none of them could have expected.<br />This book is amazing.  The plot is very complex and intricate, and at times random.  The characters offer different sides of humanity and society.  The author writes the dialogue with clever aphorisms such as &quot;On a long enough timeline, the survival rate for everyone will drop to zero,&quot;  The book was a wonder to read, and although at times I knew what was coming, it still never fell short of greatness.  I reccommend this book(or movie) to all book lovers.
0316776963|3.0|Yuck! Someone said it was funny but I thought it was boring. I like his NPR show better.
B00004R99U|5.0|Pochontas 2 is the continuing tale of what happens to Poca a few months(?) after the first one.  The time frame is a little hard to figure out.  The prologue takes place SOMETIME after the first movie ended, and then after the opening credits Pocahontas's friend tells her that &quot;much time has passed&quot; since the prologue.  It's never specific though.  The animation of this movie is not as breathtaking as the original, but considering the bulk of this film takes place in London and not the sweeping vistas of pre-industrial age America, that would make sense.<br />The songs are okay.  The first song in the film, &quot;Where Do I Go From Here&quot; is a wonderful song sung by Pocahontas.  It really rivals the original film's music.  The rest, however, I found a little off-putting upon first viewing, but subsequent viewing have shown that they aren't as bad as I thought they were (especially the &quot;white, white till he sees you&quot; song that John Rolfe's psychotic maid sings with her British accent providing a bit too much to the song).<br />Poca2's DVD is better in picture quality by leaps and bounds of the Poca1 DVD.  The story is also very interesting, not your typical Disney movie.  The ending is the only thing that floored me.  If you haven't seen the movie, I won't spoil it, but if you read the other reviews, you will be able to figure out what happens.<br />If you are a fan of Disney, or of Pocahontas 1 (to a lesser extent since the two movies are VERY different), then pick this disc up.  You shouldn't be disappointed.
6302649943|3.0|Could anyone here tell me the difference between &quot;IT&quot; and &quot;Stephen King's IT&quot;, they looks identical on the post, I don't know which one I 'd watched before. Thanks!
B00004R99J|1.0|This is one of Disney's best animated films, but the DVD does not do our favorite little Native American any justice.  Pocahontas is beautifully animated, but something is really wrong with the transfer here to the disc.  Colors are all messed up...John Smith looks like he has bugs crawling all over him in every scene because he appears &quot;snowy.&quot;  I don't really know the best way to describe it.  As for the sound, it's an OK Dolby 5.1 mix...the songs and score are wonderful.  But what took me aback from this movie when I saw it in the theater was the glorious animation.  The DVD has ruined this aspect of the film and Disney really needs to hurry up and re-release a newly transferred version (I've heard rumors that the Mouse House does have a new 2-disc SE of Pocahontas ready to go...when they decide to release it, who knows.)<br />If you want to buy this disc, I would strongly recommend waiting.
B00005NW02|3.0|After System of a Down's fabulous eponymous debut, I couldn't wait for Toxicity. I scurried back from the CD store in great anticipation, started the CD with trembling hands, cranked up the volume...... and.... got very disappointed. Very quickly. Toxicity is not a bad record. But given the media hype and the maverick talent of System, it is confusing as to why it has been hailed as the greatest rock release of the year. Serj Tankian is a great vocalist, but he relies too much on shouting rather than his fabulous Mike Patton-esque croon/growl combination. So much has been made of the lyrics, but the worryingly truePrison Song (\\"Minor drug offenders fill your prisons, you don't even flinch\\") is in contrast with the immature Psycho (\\"So you want to see the show, you really don't have to be a ho\\".... Jesus Christ, I reckon Kid Rock would think twice about that one). There are, however, some very very good moments - Chop Suey is phenomenal - a perfect melange of riffing hell, schizophrenic vocals and gorgeous strings, as is the title track. Bounce is likeable in it's silliness (\\"Pogo! Pogo! Pogo!\\"), whilst Needles has an excellent punk chorus and a spooky mid-section. My theory is the rythmic stomp of the debut, courtesy of bassist Shavo and sticksman John, has been violently pushed to the background by the chugging guitars of Daron Malakian. The hardcore groove has been replaced by more dislikeable staccato bursts - compare the main theme of Suite Peefrom the debut with, say, the riff from Deer Dance. Both similar guitar lines, but the former being far superior due to the sense that the musicians were rocking together, rather than competing for attention. This also brings another point to the fore; Toxicity appears to dilute the best of the debut, eg; erials copying Spiders. Overall an average album, outstanding in places, and yes my judgement has definitely been affected by the first record. But judge for yourself. Just don't expect too much.
B000002KDB|5.0|I kid you not, this is pure country.  But Emmylou has always had a huge non-country audience.  There is something in her voice, in her delivery, that one has to like, regardless of genre.<br />I was a D.J. (among other duties) at a small radio station in Cottonwood, Arizona, when Emmy Lou came out with this, her first album.  That was over 30 years ago, and this still stands as a classic.<br />Anybody listening to this album will have his or her favorites.  These are mine:  <br />&quot;Too Far Gone&quot;, a soulful ballad in which emmylou's plaintive voice expresses a beauty, an integrity, which is still her trade mark.<br />&quot;If I Could Only Win Your Love&quot;, which I believe was her first hit.  Whatever, it sounds just as fresh to me as it did thirty-something years ago.  <br />&quot;Boulder To Birmingham&quot; is another enduring favorite, expressing Emmy Lou's versatility and ability to evoke emotion.<br />It takes a truly great singer to take songs associated with other singers and present us with a worthwhile interpretation comparable in quality to the original.  Merle Haggard's &quot;Bottle Let Me Down&quot; could've been written for her, her version being uniquely styled.<br />Dolly Parton's &quot;Coat of Many Colors&quot; again illustrate her superb way of handling another's song.  The current term of course is &quot;cover&quot;, but in the case of these two songs, the term just doesn't seem to fit, IMHO.<br />I will quickly mention one cut which I consider a lesser one, but well worth noting, Lennon/McCartney's &quot;For No One&quot;.  Even at the very beginning, she showed off the diversity, the range of her talents.<br />This debut album is brought to a close with the rousing, yet poignant &quot;Queen of the Silver Dollar&quot;, written by the great Shel Silverstein.  Listen carefully, very carefully, and you will catch Linda Ronstadt's voice in the background.<br />All in all, as I said from the beginning, this is a classic album which is pure country, yet with an appeal to all musical tastes.
B000007OY0|4.0|This is, of course, a well-acted production; you can't expect anything less from Robbins and Freeman. The message of hope and human triumph was wonderful. However, the Stephen King short story was excellent. I wish the ironic ending could have been worked in but there wasn't time to deal with it; and the rest of the treatment was so outstanding that it wasn't necessary.
0767802659|1.0|I must confess I didn't read the 500+ reviews here, but of those I read, many saw the blithely fascistic tone of the film as being \\"ironic,\\" \\"subversive,\\" etc.  I must have missed something.  At first I assumed that the cheerful retro-50s propaganda commercial that begins this film was intended as sarcasm.  However, everything that occurs in the film supports the goofy value system portrayed, and nothing contradicts it, except for the one kid's parents, who are killed - apparently as a result of their \\"unpatriotic\\" attitude.<br />If there's anything subtle about this film, it's buried under so much gore and jingoistic blather that it's completely unrecognizable.  What's left is an ugly film that does nothing to indicate there's anything wrong with the world view that Heinlein's book apparently satirized.  I would never let an impressionable child see this sickening film.
0553208845|5.0|NOTE: I read the mjf edition of the book, but I'm sure this one is the same thing.<br />This is an amazing book! It takes you through the life of Siddhartha on his path of enlightment. He starts out as a young man who learns a lot from elders but has an ever growing thirst for knowledge and goes out to seek it starting with the Samanas and ending up in quite a different place.<br />This is my second favorite book of all time but have no doubt in buying it because it is well worth the [money] because it really teaches you a lot about life you may not have thought about or experienced and it's a quick read but you'll want to read it again and again. A must-read for ANYONE no matter what religion you are...
B000001A9P|5.0|The thing that attracted me the most to this album, aside from the other amazing tracks, was the tribute jam to Stevie Ray Vaughan.  I just recently learned that the two were quite good friends, and am amazed by the tribute.  This album is awesome.
0385491026|4.0|This was a book that was loaned to me and I read it to kill some time.  It has become one of my favorite books.  I actually read that original copy to pieces.  I would suggest this book to anyone that wanted a good rainy day afternoon book.
0195067142|5.0|With the Old Breed, by E.B. Sledge is the best personal account of combat that I have ever read. It is brutally honest, as Sledge does not gloss over the horrific nightmare that is war.After reading Slede's book, it is no small wonder that 26,000 Americans lost their sanity in the Okinawa battle alone.  He spares us none of the gory details, yet he delivers this true account in an eloquent style that gives the story even more impact. Sledge does not only desribe the fight against the Japanese,but also the mental battle raging within men on the front line, as he himself fights to remain sane amid the filth, fear and misery that were the battles of Peleliu and Okinawa.It is at times moving, and at other times stomach turning. At all times though it is extremely riveting, and I found that this book was very hard to put down. One can also not put down this book without a profound appreciation for the young men who went through the worst kind of hell for their country.
1565847032|4.0|I first heard about Noam Chomsky when Jello Biafra made a reference to him on one of his spoken-word albums, which led me to pick up \\"Understanding Power.\\"  I must say, this book is a harrowing retrospective of all the rotten things America has done since the early 20th century, and basically what can be done to prevent a future that rests in the hands of all-controlling corporations.  It goes without saying that Chomsky's glasses are anything BUT rose-colored, but his points are valid and honest--if you can't deal with what he's saying, the evening news is waiting for you.
0871137380|4.0|I enjoyed the level of detail, and the respective viewpoints, that Bowden included. I was frequently confused as to the strategy and location of the troops at any given time, and might even re-read this to get a better idea. I wanted to know more about modern day warfare in situations like Afghanistan, and I thought the Mogadishu engagement would give a good rundown. I also appreicated Bowden's reservation of his opinion of the situation until the end of the book. I must admit that I'd like more viewpoints of the townspeople of Mogadishu and the rivalling clans and not just the US troops.
B00005Y228|5.0|This album is very good...no time for that sappy ballad album filler. This will keep you on your feet. Which is just what pop fans want!

B00004TRD8|5.0|You know, if more people took DVD making as seriously as James Cameron does on this DVD, it would probably make me a lot more excited about the potential of the medium.  Most DVDs in recent release have had little to no extra content.  But I digress.<br />T2: Ultimate Edition is exactly that. This is the absolute perfect release that fans of this fantastic movie have been waiting for. I'm pretty sure the extra features on this disc reach near four hours, and all of it is interesting.<br />The best thing about the disc is that you can watch the movie in two very distinct (and one rather similiar) ways.  The first choice is to watch the DVD without the deleted scenes reinserted. This is okay for purists who liked the original cut, but it [stinks] in my opinion.  The deleted scenes are all integral in understanding what the original version of the movie was supposed to be.  There are quite a few brilliant scenes that will have you angered when you realize how good they are.<br />I can't ruin anything for you guys. The content on these discs has to be scene to be believed.  It is simply amazing, and the perfect testament to one of the most important (SFX wise) movies ever released.  A groundbreaking movie, and a groundbreaking DVD.
0060506989|5.0|Today we have become complacent to short wars, \\"smart\\" weapons and few casualties.  Journalists constantly poll for our opinions and ratings on \\"how the war is being managed\\".  War is neither about management nor polls.  War is about leadership, survival  and sacrifice.<br />Gen. Moore and Joe are survivors and leaders.  These men understood what they were getting into.  They did not fight for medals, Pulitzer prices or news polls.  They performed their duties courageously against a strong and equally determined enemy. <br />If you want to know what war is, this book brings the message home loud and clear.  War is about the failure of political leadership and about the incredible leadership of soldiers who carry on orders knowing what the outcome maybe.  Leadership is about the guts to tell those under your command that some will die yet no one will be left behind. That when the fight starts,  you will be the first one to walk into the battlefield and the last one to leave it.  This kind of leadership is not accomplished through fancy PowerPoint presentations or \\"briefings\\" kept to within 10 minutes.  This is accomplished through character and this story contains tons of examples, from the rifleman to the platoon leader to the Command Sgt. Major, all real people all real heroes.<br />This book also teaches us about respect and humility.  Gen Moore and Joe talk about their foes with respect for in the end it was their battle too.  Warriors who did not hide behind non-combatants nor used cowardly tactics as so called freedom fighters.<br />Gen. Moore teaches us that as hard as it may be a senior officer's job is first and foremost commanding his troops.  A senior officer has no business getting into the fight.  They let their company grade officers and NCOs run that part, while they ensure everyone stays focused and alive.  Imagine how awesome our school systems would be if we allowed teachers to teach and parents to raise their children.  Do your job, let others do theirs and help when you're asked.<br />For NCOs this is also a textbook in what is required of them, for they too are leaders and their example will determine the outcome of a battle as well as the lives of those under their care.  They influence enlisted and officers alike.<br />After the events of September 11, 2001, it is extremely important to understand what it means to sacrifice ones life through service to their country (military service personnel, firefighters, teachers) so that others may live, be free and have a chance to a better life.  Rick Rescorla, whose picture appears in the front cover of the book, knew this first hand.  He sacrificed for the last time on that fateful day by directing many others to safety while ignoring his own at the World Trade Center tower.<br />This book has a message for all Americans who care and respect their country.

B0000024JN|5.0|I loved this CD when it first came out and still love it today.  I have most everything that the Beastie Boys have recorded, and I agree that much of what they did later is superior.  For example, Hello Nasty is a much more diverse and impressive work.  However, I think that it's a mistake comparing their initial work with their later work.  Licensed to Ill was a huge rap breakthrough.  Without CD's like Licensed to Ill, rap would not have broken into the mainstream, at least not then.  The Beasties personify old school rap and many people were disappointed with their later work and wanted them to record more music like Licensed to Ill.<br />While the raps and grooves seem a bit simplistic 16 years after its release, it still sounds great.  \\"Fight for Your Right\\" was and is a classic party theme.  I also love \\"Brass Monkey.\\"  What's amazing about this CD is how many of the songs became classics (Fight for your right, Brass Monkey, Paul Revere, Hold it now, Slow & Low).  Throw on this CD and just enjoy it.
0060278234|4.0|This is excellent entertainment.  Good writing, and grand storytelling.  Nix's novel, Shade's Children, is fine for adolescent readers, but adults may find that it shows the author's potential better than his skill.  Sabriel blew out of the water any notion that Garth Nix couldn't keep up.  That novel was great, and stood well on its own.  With Lirael, though we revisit Ancelstierre and The Old Kingdom, are updated on Sabriel and Touchstone, and taken in by the story of the Clayr-born Lirael.  This book is enchanting.  I eagerly await the third in the series:  Abhorsen.

0140288503|4.0|Let me confess this right off. I'm not a military history buff. Nor am I a veteran of the armed services. So I can't honestly say that I devoured every word, as perhaps military scholars and veterans might. In truth, I found myself skipping over sections that were just a little too detailed about military choppers, weapons, etc. That doesn't mean that such details don't belong in an important work like this. It simply means that the average civilian such as myself is more likely to hone in on the fascinating accounts of the ordinary fighting men who found themselves in an extraordinary situation. And here, the author really excels in bringing these brave men to life in a way that will appeal to people of all backgrounds. So from that standpoint alone, it is probably worth the 5 stars that most reviewers have given it.<br />Plus BLACK HAWK DOWN raises some important questions that are very timely now in light of events happening in Afghanistan and elsewhere. What the heck were we doing in Somalia in the first place? Was the battle for Mogadishu really a military failure, as was portrayed in the media back home? If everything you know about Somalia you learned from TV news, then you owe it to yourself to read this book. Besides, we all need heroes to look up to nowadays. And this book is full of them. Having now read the book, I can't wait to see the movie!

0060934913|4.0|I enjoyed most of KC, including the childhood reminisces, the cooking tips, and the dining hints.  As with other reviewers, I know when not to order fish, what kitchen tools are truly essential, and, most importantly, what goes on behind the kitchen doors (at least at some restaurants).<br />Two things grated on me, however (pun sort of intended).  First, Bourdain has obviously read a lot of Hunter S. Thompson, and tries to style his writing after the original Gonzo journalist, but it's very difficult to mimic Thompson.  The references to whacked-out, drug abusing, thieving kitchen staff were entertaining for awhile but began to wear thin 2/3 of the way through the book.<br />Second, Bourdain expresses contempt for a particular celebrity chef.  Although he never mentions Emeril Lagasse's name, we know who he's talking about.  He never gives a basis for such contempt, however, and fails to give credit where it is due.  Before they were celebrity chefs, Lagasse and a few of the other Food TV folks spent years and years honing their craft and doing perfectly legitimate and respectable work.<br />The kicker, however, comes when I see advertisements for -- you guessed it -- Anthony Bourdain on Food TV!  I saw the first of his Cook's Tour series.  It was mildly interesting.  But the irony was more than delicious -- the Emeril-basher doing a 22-part celebrity chef series on television!
B00005Y228|5.0|This is an absolute ESSENTIAL album to have. Every song is fantastic. Standout tracks inclue Love At First Sight, Can't Get You Out Of My Head, Fever, Come Into My World, In Your Eyes and Love Affair. AND in the US you get two fantastic bonus tracks... Boy (Great song) and Butterfly (OMG this is SUCH a good song... it was one of my favorite tracks off Light Years)<br />BUT THIS CD NOW!!!
B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah's CD is a great hybrid of styles (country, jazz, blues and pop) that makes one think that this is indeed an all new style. It's not really, and that's OK. The music is just pure heart and soul from an obviously talented young singer and pianist. It's unfortunate that singers like Alicia Keys will get all the airplay in the world (thanks to the marketing machine) while Norah will have to get ahead on just the strength of her talent. Too bad the official review above takes points away for not sounding like other jazz singers (i.e., Shirley Horn), but I consider that a reason to give the CD a listen. (There's already one Shirley in the world, do we really need to go looking for another one? Oh well, leave it to critics to criticize...) Don't worry if the songs don't make you want to dance; that's not the goal here. Simply relax and listen to the CD, preferably without much noise to distract you, and you'll appreciate the sounds that Norah and her band throw your way. Plus, it's not a bad deal for the low price.
0789723107|5.0|This book provides a concise overview of the subject of usability on the web.  It is short enough to be read in your spare time (it took me less than a week), but it covers the salient points well.  What it leaves out are the statistics and detailed scientific justifications for its &quot;rules&quot;.  As a web developer, I am most interested in &quot;what to do&quot;, and as the book states, I already believe that usability is important.  By keeping the book at a digestible size, Krug enabled me to read it cover-to-cover rather than just skimming chapters that seemed interesting or relevant.  It also provided a good list of references for more in-depth coverage of individual areas.<br />Overall, the book provides a well-written overview of the subject of usability.  It is well worth the cost, and I would recommend it to anyone who would like to improve the usability of their web site without hiring a team of consultants.
B00005Y228|5.0|Okay, so I am now a fan of Miss Kylie!  Who knew?  I only heard of her once, and read about her online here and there.  WOW--blows me away!  I've been listening to this stuff on [a web-site] for six months, and so HAPPY to get it in the US now!  I didn't even realize I got the two bonus tracks, but it's worth it.  <br />If you like world music, or want something different to shake your groove thing to, this is it!
B000002H6C|5.0|Even with the absence of a bass guitar, this has to be one of Mettalica's best albums.  The absence of Cliff caused the band to think outside of the box to make up for what Cliff brought.  This album is the beginning of a period where Metallica was really exploring their musical identities.  Hits such as One and Harvester of Sorrow really showed how far the band had come and I think that this album had to be made in order for the band to continue to exist.
B00000IAU3|3.0|Keeping this short for lack of time, I really liked \\"Im no Angel\\", \\"Hunter\\" \\"Don't think of me\\",and \\"Here with me\\" and all the beginning songs. then, the songs got mushy and lovey-dovey, which I hate. My personal favorite is \\"Hunter\\". I would give the cd more but I don't like the last seven songs. If you like love you, slow kind of songs, you'll like everything, but if you like great lyrics like in Alanis Morissette, Blink-182, you might be disapointed.
B00005RFAI|5.0|It's true what everybody says, Pink on her first album was another Britney maybe, or a more mature and more hip Britney at the very least.....Now Pink is the best, she is superior to Britney and Christina and all the pop boybands in about a hundred levels of greatness. This album totally rocks, the fact that she released the fabolous Get the Party Started first in my opnion was a smart move, she released a very hip and modern track that made everybody pay attention to her new album and buy it, only to discover that is the only song on the whole album that's mainstreem, made to be a hit....The rest of the album is a lot, and i mean a lot more personal......She has the greatest voice any girl at that age and at that amount of experience can ever dream to have....The best tracks Just LIke a Pill, it just terrific the lyrics are the best only to be put together by such great music and vocals....After &quot;Pill&quot; i can't decide which are the best 'cause there are just so many.....Don't let me get me, its a huge &quot;in your face britney and music inustry people&quot; kinda song, 18 Wheeler is just great. And the a song that makes me feel sorry for everybody that goes through a divorce is Family Portrait, it has the best damm lyrics in the whole album, its sad, hard to take but amazing and the kids in the chorus nly make it better, Pink you are the best only for this song.....Lonely Girl is amazing too, Linda Perry sings with Pink here and the both make a perfect (and hopefully)second or third single.....Damm it the whole album is great......PINK ROCKS! BUY IT.....IT'S BETTER THAN BRITNEY AND IF YOUR BUYING HER ALBUM WELL THEN BUY PINK'S ALBUM TOO 'CAUSE IT'S WORTH YOUR MONEY......
006092988X|5.0|As a lifetime voracious reader, I'm not sure how all this time has passed without me having read this wonderful book. Any novel that can captivate me for 500 pages has got to be something extra special, and this one did.  It has everything you want in a novel, great writing, superb characters, humor, sadness, joy and pain.  I loved every word.  There is really nothing more to be said, if you have not read this book you are truly missing out on something magical.
0446677450|5.0|If you're looking to get rich quick, find another book.  The bottom line of RDPD is - What they don't teach you in school CAN hurt you.<br />I can relate to many of the examples in this book.  <br />1.  Growing up I always heard, &quot;Go to school, get an education, or you'll never make any money and you'll never be able to retire.&quot;<br />I'm 30+ years old and still haven't earned a college degree.  I had one line on income last year that brought in six figures.  Big whoop, but I proved my parents wrong.  Not that an education isn't important, but I think I did fairly well - considering.  <br />2.  Know a little about a lot.<br />As a management consultant, all I can know is a little about a lot.  I have to rely on the experts to know a lot about one particular area.  And believe me, I look for experts I can trust with my life.  Financial Advisors, CPAs, Venture Capitalist...<br />This book is not a &quot;How to get rich&quot; book.  This book simply tells the reader how different people have different thought processes related to money.<br />If you want to get rich, educate yourself.  This one book alone will not provide you with the education you need, however you can claim it as a tax deduction!
B00005J9M1|5.0|&quot;Very&quot; is an absolutely brilliant album - quite possibly the PSB's finest moment. And that's some achievement, since every PSB album throughout the 80s &amp; early 90s are worthy of high acclaim.<br />Only the late 90's have seen the Boys finding it hard to come up with anything as original and brilliant as their previous treasures, but in this day and age is there anything you can do which hasn't been done before anyway?<br />Every song on &quot;Very&quot; is a gem and the whole album is one of those rarities where you can put it on from start to finish and not be disappointed whatsoever. It's difficult to pick a single favourite, but I have to say I'm a  big fan of &quot;Yesterday, When I Was Mad&quot; and &quot;Can You Forgive Her?&quot;...<br />&quot;Go West&quot; is a classic (only the PSB could get away with a Village People cover!) but it doesn't seem to fit with the rest of the album (which is maybe why it's the last track). Still, it made a great single and the video was excellent, too...<br />I haven't got the new 2-disc re-release, but seeing as the original is such a classic then the second disc is gonna be a great bonus which I can't wait to hear... (I could listen to Neil Tennant's voice all day...)<br />To sum it all up then: &quot;Very&quot; is a truly great album.
B00003CXDZ|4.0|Nothing short of a great time watching (experiencing) this movie.<BR>Photographically stunning, musically thrilling as Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor actually do all of their own singing in the movie.  Baz Luhrmann, you got gipped, what a wonderful directing job!
B00005JKJA|5.0|David Lynch's masterpiece is like a dream, and like dreams there is no conclusion, it just stops. I loved this movie.
B000002KIK|5.0|... I think this album is solid all the way though. I think Bill Wards vocals on Swinging the Chain are incredible. In fact, that's one of my favorite songs on the album. If you're a fan of good metal/rock you'll like it, don't listen to the bad thinks you've heard on the album. You don't have to be a die hard Sabbath fan to enjoy this a lot. Highly recommended!
B00005RYLE|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies!  From the cinematography to the script this movie is just plain cool!  Also if your an H. P. Lovecraft fan, like myself, having it in the Necronomicon case is a great bonus.  I have to go now Cthulhu is calling...
0060977493|5.0|This novel is an international bestseller and winner of the Booker prize. The writing is lyrically poetic and dense with detail, but initially I had a bit of trouble maintaining interest. About halfway through, the characters and events had been woven together in a manner that craftily captivated my attention, causing me to read the remainder of the book at a feverish pace. It's funny how that works. If I had less time on my hands, I might have given up reading too early to realize the quality of the writing. <br />The story is mostly set in India, and it revolves around two seven-year-old non-identical twins and their extended family. The stark observations and playful dialogue of children are often depicted in a sing-song fashion, sometimes obscuring fact momentarily (or at least bringing to light the differences between adult and child perception of reality). The plot is at times startling and heart-wrenching; this is not light reading. All in all I was very satisfied by the book. I think someday I might even enjoy reading it again.
0871137380|5.0|War novels and the military genre are not my usual choice of reading materials, but I was interested in reading this book b/c it was a true account of what happened in Somalia and I had heard great reviews on it. I cannot say how glad I am that I read this book. The writing is incredible, Mark Bowden did a phenomonal job of keeping the multitude of characters easy to follow and you got to know enough about each of them to make the story more personal, rather than a textbook style account of a military battle. Bowden also explained the techinical aspects of the battle, weapons, military terms, etc., in plain every day language for those of us who are not familiar with these aspects.<br />I think that everyone should read this book. Not only is it an incredible heart-wrenching story, it gives the reader a greater appreciation for the military and the people who risk their lives to defend us and our country.
B00005JKQX|5.0|First off, I have to admit I loved the movie and credit it with getting me to read this book. After reading this book, however, I realized that the movie (as absorbing as it was) left out so many important details about John Nash's early and later years, details which make all the difference in understanding the richness and complexity of his life....his childhood as an eccentric, if gifted, child, his connection to two different women (and the two children he had) and the oddness of those relationships.<br />The author also reveals that one of Nash's children suffers from acute schizophrenia and writes about the similarities and differences between his illness and that of his father. If you want to go beyond just the brief intro to Nash's life that the movie portrayed, be sure to get a copy of this one.
0156012197|5.0|This isn't just a children's book. The Little Prince is a message of love and compassion for people of any age. Other reviewers have summarized the story and explored its lessons at length, but you can't appreciate how profoundly meaningful and beautiful this story is until you've made it your own. You can read it in a sitting, but it will stay with you for life.
1567184855|5.0|I came here to write a review of what I believed to be one of the most wonderful books I've ever read.  But first, Mr. Baker, before reviewing something, get your facts straight.  Don't skim through a book and then write a review on it.  I wish I hadn't loaned my book out, I'd be able to quote directly from the book, but it does discuss souls of animals, plants, insects, inanimate objects, etc.  It says EVERYTHING has a soul - everything is made up of energy.  It's just that humans are more advanced and to reincarnate into one of them would be taking a step back.  That is something we never do.  We can be stuck at a level, but we never back track.  I'm sorry animal lovers, I love animals also, but we ARE more advanced.  Also, how would he validate what he's writing about... it's &quot;heaven&quot;!  Have you found a history book on heaven?  <BR>Now for my review of the book.  It was an eye opener for many things that have happened to me, but I couldn't find an answer for.  So many thoughts and ideas I had (and wondered about) where discussed and validated for me.  I couldn't put it down.  I had to read it all the way through.  It's what I call an &quot;ah ha&quot; book.  You have a much more clearer understanding after reading the book.  I'd have to read excerpts to my boyfriend as I read.  Even he was fascinated with the book and he's not studying to be a hypnotherapist as I am.
B00005O5CM|5.0|LEGALLY BLONDE is a triumph film! It is about a Californian college-aged girl named Elle Woods (Reese Witherspoon). Elle has the perfect life--she is pretty, has it easy, and has a handsome, intelligent boyfriend. She has her whole future set out. But then, her future dreams are shattered when her boyfriend takes her out to a fancy restaurant and dumps her! He claims that she is not good or serious enough to be his wife, especially since he's going off to Harvard Law School. Furious and outraged, Elle makes plans to go on a road trip to Harvard Law...where she will prove to her boyfriend that she is good enough for him. She somehow gets into Harvard Law and soon discovers that her boyfriend has found someone else. So Elle tries to win him back by becoming the best student at Harvard Law School. <br />LEGALLY BLONDE is hilarious...a great film and this is a pretty awesome DVD. The DVD for LEGALLY BLONDE includes deleated scenes, 2 featurettes, interviews with Reese Witherspoon and director Robert Luketic, and a trivia-type game. The acting by the entire cast is superb...Reese Witherspoon is probably at her best! The film stars Reese Witherspoon, Luke Wilson, Selma Blair, and Victor Gerber. For anyone in need of a good comedy or just a film that will thoroughly entertain you, I strongly suggest LEGALLY BLONDE!
B00000DGUG|5.0|For the longest time I couldn't get past the astounding power of \\"Baba\\", which still stands as my favorite track from this 1998 release. A brilliant jab at fake prophets and the weaklings who follow them, this gem of a hard rocker is the most genuinely heavy-handed piece of music Alanis has ever produced. Over a tight rhythm arrangement, brilliant guitar voicings on the verses (I just LOVE the wall of feedback and sqealing high notes after the first chorus) and open-tuned power chords of the choruses, Morrisette sings in a deeper, world weary drone (especailly effective on the line \\"...upward glances in hope of instant salvation\\") that will stun listeners with it's newfound maturity and soul. This is only one of dozens of great moments scattered throughout \\"Supposed Former....\\" that will have you addicted.  \\"Thank You\\" just gets prettier and more poignant with the passing of each year, and \\"Are You Still Mad?\\" remains a great 'get over it' song for the ages.  Of course, this didn't sell as well as \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" but is ultimately the more rewarding album. A fine, personal and mature work that keeps getting better.
B00005QAPH|4.0|Regarding \\"8 1/2\\" itself, I agree with everything positive that people have already written. But--even with all the extras on it--I only rate the DVD 4 stars because it does not contain the rarely shown but very excellent english language dub. At the least, it provides one more experience of a film that, for me, has stayed pretty fresh since I first stumbled across it back in-when else?-1988. I know that a lot of(most?)dubs are pretty awful (english track on \\"Crouching Tiger\\" DVD)--but in the case of \\"8 1/2\\" it was done just right--down to the way it syncs with the actors' mouths. The voices are cartoonish compared to the italian, yet perfectly in sync with the characters on screen--Daumier sounds \\"more like\\" Daumier in english than italian. And I was actually kinda disappointed when I first heard Marcello's own voice, rather than the burlier english Guido. I appreciate the beautiful new print and the extra stuff, but I consider omitting the english track ridiculous. I'd buy another DVD if Criterion re-issued it with the english track available. Not to insult anyone, but if it's a question of DVD \\"bandwidth,\\" I'd take the english dub instead of the audio commentary. Sometimes the subtitles obscure things, like Guido's twitching foot when Daumier is excorciating their proposed collaboration. Yes, I've seen the subtitled version many times, but, at least with this particular movie, there is something crucial lost in the necessity of reading subtitles while at the same time trying to take in Fellini's images. It flows perfectly if you don't have that slight disconnect.
6304994540|5.0|This is quite possibly the funniest movie I have EVER seen!  I just can't get tired of it no matter how many times I watch it, and I still use the catch phrases constantly.  I have not yet met a person who didn't like this film.  In my opinion, The Big Lebowski tops all other Coen Bros. movies, including Fargo; so do yourself a favor and BUY THIS MOVIE.
B00003CXXP|1.0|3 hours of maudlin drivel! With a transitory plot (staying nowhere long enough to finish a story), obvious and predictable \\"tear-jerkers,\\" this movie strives for meaning and misses. Speilburg's aim to explore prejudice and the human psyche comes off instead in a disgustingly dark pointless melodrama not fit to grace the worlds theaters, much less my movie rack.
B00005Y228|5.0|It's said that history has a tendancy to repeat itself -- and that certainly holds true with this modern day 80s music revival that has been going on since Bon Jovi released their hit single, \\"It's My Life.\\" After that came out, it made us re-evaluate the 80s music period and see which artists had survived the change in times. There's Madonna, Michael Jackson, Elton John, Depeche Mode, Mariah Carey, Janet Jackson, Whitney Houston, and of course, we have the perfectly planned comeback of \\"that Loco-motion girl,\\" Kylie Minogue with her new single, \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" and her first album in years, Fever.<br />If you're like most of the American public, you probably think after her brief stint of Top 40 singles, Kylie Minogue simply went under a rock and hibernated there for about a decade or so. Well, not exactly. After Kylie's fame ran out in America, she continued to climb the charts across the globe, eventually being hailed the equivalent of Madonna. The validity of that comparison is basically up to you to decide, but there is no denying the fact that Miss Minogue certainly can produce a great dance-pop record, proving so with her February 26th release, Fever.<br />The first track, \\"More, More, More,\\" pulsates with its 70s disco-esque beats and breathless vocals. It also sets the mood for the album; Kylie's on a mission with this record: to make you dance. The seductively robotic song, complete with the \\"la la la la la\\" refrain, \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head,\\" (currently charting in the Top 20...) follows closely behind at track three. <br />On the title-track, \\"Fever,\\" which borrows heavily from the 80s music time period, Miss Minogue speaks of what an contagious illness love is, and erotically proposes that the listener take the role of her \\"doctor.\\" The closet thing you're going to get on this album for a ballad, \\"Fragile,\\" comes in at number six. With it's echoing vocals, sensual whisperings, and breathless tone, you just can't help being caught up in the song.<br />Normally it is a sin in music to produce a near duplicate of a song already on the same album, but Kylie Minogue certainly didn't mind the risk. \\"Come Into My World\\" is practically \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head,\\" but with stronger vocals, wittier verses, and a catchy as hell \\"na na na na na\\" refrain. A tad bit unoriginal? Sure. Does it matter? Not the least.<br />The final track on the album, \\"Burning Up,\\" begins with a set fairly simple guitar strums and relaxing vocals, but turns out to be a bit deceiving. As stated before, Kylie didn't make this album for you to relax with, she made it to make people dance. Within seconds after the second verse has come to an end, the beats begin to pound once again, pulling you into another sweat-driven trance.<br />Fever is an album of class, sophistication, and a true gem to the world of dance music. Britney Spears and Madonna should take notice of this record for a few tips on making good pop tunes. So grab on, hold tight, and feel the fever!
B0000027RL|5.0|I think that Pearl Jam is probably the most underrated bands ever.  They keep rolling out great songs, only to be overshadowed by the pop music of our time.  They are my favorite band ever...  This is one of their best albums (the only album that I think is better is Live On Two Legs).  This shows Pearl Jam in the beginning.  This has a little of everything (Jeremy), the grunge songs (Porch, Even Flow), and the great closer, Release.  Don't forget Once, with the great fire extinguisher beat.  My favorite song, other than the songs mentioned above, is probably Alive...   Oh yeah, if you like this masterpiece, check out some other PJ cd's (Vs., Vitalogy, Yield, etc.).  I jus hope that Pearl Jam can rock the charts with another Ten, because they are the best...
0684833395|5.0|Catch 22's basic purpose is to show the chaos and stupidity of war. It also shows that wars aren't fought only against the enemy, but against ourselves. They are fought on the bases against clashing egos and people with no sense and those with too much sense. A person who would enjoy this book doesn't have to be just a fan of war novels. A book like this can appeal to a vast number of persons because it is so fun to read. It can also appeal to those who like the unusual and thought provoking.   <br />Yossarian is a bombardier who seems to be the wrong person in the wrong squadron. When he censors letters, he cuts about everything out and signs the aliases `Irving Washington' or `Washington Irving'. When he presented with a medal, he marches down the ramp naked. But it seems every time Yossarian is close to completing his tour of duty, the mission number is raised by five. While many crews in other squads are going home at 50 missions, Yossarian's group is at 80 and counting. So Yossarian decides enough is enough and refuse to fly more missions. This creates quite a stir between him and his superiors. This creates chaos in the squadron with the threat others will soon refuse to fly. Yossarian offered a deal: He can return back to the states and no one would have known about this or, due to insubordination, desertion, cowardice in the face of the enemy and several other charges, he will be court-martialed. We see various colorful characters throughout the book, including General Dreedle, Colonel Korn, Colonel Cathcart, Lieutenant Scheisskopf, Nately, Hungry Joe, Major ------ de Coverley, Nately's whore kid sister and Major Major, among many others. Not many of these characters have importance to the text. However, some of them make the book more fun to read and others add to the backdrop.  <br />\\"The enemy,\\" retorted Yossarian with weighted precision, \\"is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on.\\" <br />This quote (Which also appears in theamzon.com review above) is important in that it shows the two sides of which war is fought. For example, the number of missions is continually raised by the squadron's commanding officers, thus increasing the squadron's chances of getting killed. The quote also shows the meaningless of war. Why should you care about who wins if you are dead? Or who is really the enemy in war? <br />I wasn't sure as to what style Heller used. The book is not organized confusingly, but its tone changes throughout. We are presented with thrills, drama, horror and humor. Perhaps this is meant to show how well mixed our own lives are It can be called an anti-war novel, but unlike Remarque's All Quiet on the Western Front, Catch-22 is a satire. There are some audiences that may not like Catch-22. Like I said, it has varying changes of attitude plus has somewhat explicit content concerning sex and language. Also, the novel has rather large cast of people and not all of them have importance to the story line. Nevertheless, except for romance and possibly mystery, Catch-22 has enough elements to appeal to a wide audience. <br />I have tried to review Catch-22, but I think that no one review can fully comprehend Heller's work. I'm sure that there is some more depth in the novel than I have touched on in this analysis. The novel has to be read and read again and again before it is fully understood. But this is what good novels should do. Catch-22 I liked because I like war novels and because it leaves much to think about. If there is something to dislike about it, it seems to me that the book's end leaves an open gap, possibly for a sequel that never came. Also, at over 400 pages, this is a very long read and takes some getting into. But once you do, the book doesn't stop and delivers in whole. Thus, I recommend Catch-22 (And would give it ten stars if possible) for its anti-war message, its themes about humanity and for the fact it's just so fun.

0393312836|5.0|To be frank, this book changed my life.  I have never seen the film, but from what I had heard about it I was a bit apprehensive about picking this piece of literature up.  But for whatever reason, I did, and I am sure glad of it.<BR>     This is the bleakly futuristic tale of Alex, a young droog who loves doing the ultraviolent,  razdrazzing others, peeting milk-plus in seedy mestos and slooshying Beethoven.  He and his three other droogies wander the streets when the sun goes down, looking for a chance for some twenty-to-one, and rarely are they without a decent find.  One fateful noche, however, he is taken by the millicents to the staja where he gets by on his oddy knocky day in and day out.<BR>     <BR>     What?!<BR>     <BR>     Written in a beautifully brutal dialect (something of a combination of slang english and russian), Burgess leaves the reader to figure out that Alex, a young hoodlum, loves to rape, kill, drink halucinogen-laced milk, and listen to classical music.  However, when he is caught one night, he is taken to prison where he dwells for 2 years.  However, he learns of a new treatment that will get him out of jail in a fortnight.  This treatment is the creation a connection in his brain between sickness and violence by making him watch violent films (i.e. holocaust documentaries, interestingly enough) after given a shot that makes him yearn to vomit.  The state, in all of its arrogance, releases young Alex into a world where his actions come back to haunt him.<BR>     Thus, the book asks:  is it better to be bad on your own free will, or to be good without free will (a clockwork orange)?<BR>     Perhaps one of the most redeeming characteristics of this novel is the likeability of \\"your humble narrator.\\"  Remarkably, Alex is quite a sympathetic character, if you can put aside all of the atrocities he commits nightly.  You wholeheartedly root for him until the end, although you are not sure why.  I am:  it's the magic of Burgess' writing.  <BR>If you can stomach a little literary violence and a great philophical quandary, packed in with a message of maturity and hope, this book is for you.

B00005YW4H|3.0|Norah Jones' First Sessions epee, available through the artist on the internet (...), was a minor miracle. Here was a singer who actually connected with and seemed part of her music. She swept you away in her private reverie. Sadly, that vibe doesn't translate nearly as well on her major league debut. Arif Mardin does what he was hired to do and brings on distracting sheen and polish, as well as a puzzling sense of distance and cool. Here, Norah's vocals sound more studied and less intimate. Several songs from First Sessions show up on Come Away With Me as well, but haven't gained a thing from the translation. Much of the new stuff - Seven Years, Painter Song - barely registers at all. And a Cassandra Wilson turn on Cold, Cold Heart seems ill advised as Norah is all about warmth where Cassandra is the queen of cool. Here's hoping Norah gets back to the First Sessions vibe on her next outing, because she's clearly got what it takes.
B00005RFAI|1.0|There's very little that's endearing or enduring about today's musicial artists.  Popular music is more disposable than ever, just like most other things in our culture.  Most so-called \\"artists\\" are just creatures of the music industry's massive marketing machine.  Precious few have any staying power beyond a song or two.  Pink is certainly right in the middle of this unremarkable pack.  \\"Get the Party Started\\" is the most shallow, uninspired, stupid song I've heard in a while.  For the 5 people still watching videos on MTV, Pink's visuals are as memorable as the drive-though at McDonalds.  A year from now she'll be calling radio stations to request her own songs.  (...)
B00000DGUY|5.0|As far as compilations go, this one truly spoils all Dire Straits fans and novices alike. Starting out with the great classic &quot;Sultans of Swing&quot;, and working it's way through sixteen amazing tracks, making for well over 70 minutes of great music. This album hits on all of Dire Strait's styles, and by using certain live versions of tracks, accurately portrays the simple genius that is Mark Knoppfler and his gang. Even the liner notes are interesting and comprehensive. Unfortunately, there is no previously unreleased material, so true fans don't need this album, but it does make for a great intro, or an addition to the general classic rock fan's collection. Check out track 4, it's a goodie :)
B00005Y228|5.0|KYLIE MINOGUE - FEVER I knew Kylie Minogue would be making a huge comeback here in the U.S. soon and I was right. Her new song CAN'T GET YOU OUT OF MY HEAD hit #1 on the Billboard Dance Club Charts a few weeks back and on this weeks Billboard Hot 100 Kylie has herself her first top ten hit in the U.S. in over 14 years when her single hit #10 on the Billboard Hot 100 singles charts, and her album Fever debuted at an amazing #3 on the Billboard Album Charts. As I told you all I had no idea who she was until I saw MADONNA wear a T-shirt with her name on it at the 2000 Mtv Europe Video Music Awards. I knew she had to be ok if MADONNA liked her. In December i first heard her song \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" and I loved the song and bought the import album in January and I truly enjoy it. Funny enough when I was at my parents house last week me and my mom had the TV on MTV's TRL where Kylie's New video was playing and at #8 and my mom said \\"I never thought I would hear a song from Kylie Minogue again.\\" I was surprised my mom knew who she was, but she remembered Kylie straight out of the late 80's and said \\"yea she had some good songs that Mtv used to play years ago and I think she looks good for as long as she has been around, and im surprised she is becoming popular here again.\\" All I can say is my mom who is (just turned 43 this month) 6 months younger than MADONNA, has some great style when it comes to MUSIC. Yes my mom had me very young LOL. Go figure. Check out this amazing CD! The #2 song Love At First Sight has a beat that sounds very much like MADONNA's Holiday, check it out for yourself. This U.S version has 2 Bonus Tracks #13 called BOY which is a soft dance song with a cool retro beat to it, and #14 called BUTTERFLY which is a dance song with a club beat that will get you off your feet. My Australian Import does not have these 2 bonus tracks but does have an awesome mellow dance song called TIGHTROPE which is one of the best on the album and better then the 2 bonus tracks on this U.S. edition.

B00000AFFF|5.0|Normally I'm not that big on easy listening stuff, I need a little more &quot;umph&quot; to my music. But this CD defies all of that. I'm a big fan of Elvis Costello from his rock'n'roll days so this was obviously a little different, but it's amazing how much his personality comes through. Any of the lyrics on this CD could just as easily be from one of his rock albums. And knowing that he has a rock CD coming out in a few months, it makes it really refreshing to enjoy an artist that transcends genres the way elvis costello does. This CD comes very highly reccomended.
B0000524CY|5.0|Well, since it is a classic and there is simply no comparison to modern aged movies, this is quite a movie for the late 70's.  A young girl, Ragen becomes possessed by the devil and soon some serious help is needed.  Determined mother tries to find answers for her daughter's mysterious behavior, and calls in the experts.  A priest who believes the daughter is actually possessed.<BR>The special effects are quite impressing for the time and with the 11 minutes of extra scenes added since the first version, this movie is quite a classic and should be seen by anyone, no matter of what religious beliefs.
B00000IGGA|5.0|I've been a Tom Waits fan for 20 years, but find a lot of his stuff to be inconsistent with what I expect to hear when I do find something he has done that catches my ear. Reading back, that sentence is hard to decipher in meaning and substance, but so is Tom's music. Most of Tom's music is something between a drunk you can't wake from and a dream you can't forget. He music can evoke images of Toulouse Lautrec and Mickey Spillane arguing over who's gonna buy the next drink while stoned on LSD. Some of it I love to death, and some of it I can't stand.I bought the album Mule Variations on a whim while on a CD buying spree. While going through them, I threw on this CD to the first track, \\"I'm big in Japan\\". I took it off and put it away. A year later, I pulled it out for a road trip. I put it on while cruising through the high desert across the Navajo reservation. I spent a good portion of the trip playing it over and over. The track \\"Big in Japan\\" even grew on me. You can't listen to it out of context on first hearing. You gotta take the whole trip, as uncomfortable as the ride may seem at first. The guy jumps genres without blinking and makes it all fit together. I still don't know how... I remember seeing a list one time that was titled \\"Albums you'd have to have on a Desert Island. This is one of them. From the deranged to the sublime, he covers it all, Blues, Jazz, Gospel, and whatever. He makes it all his own. Buy it. You won't be sorry.
0783232039|1.0|After seeing this movie for the first time, and not viewing the previous Chucky film, I was amazed that this movie is classified as Horror.  First of all, the movie has no meaning full story line, the two main characters, Jesse and Jade (not the dolls) are set out on a `road trip' with the Chucky doll, and his obsessed girlfriend who `turned doll'.<BR>The dolls rather cute, than scary and the film rather funny than horror, it is simple to say that this movie is not worth seeing if you are looking for something to spook yourself.<BR>It may become a classic horror tale one day, but as a 90's film it has quite not enough what you may expect.
B00005OAIE|4.0|This is a great CD! Though not mainstream, Mayer is a young talented artist, coming to the music scene. He has been compared to the greats (i.e. DMB and David Gray) but he has his own original sound and endearing lyrics (if not always profound). I really appreciate the lighthearted sound and attitude. Everyone needs to hear an optimistic view every once in a while. Mayer supplies this with pleasure! Songs like Why Georgia and 3x5 are catchy and satisfying. At the end of the day, he is a great guitarist with a gorgeous voice (not hard on the eyes either!) and at the top of my list.
B000000XB9|3.0|Most of the songs here are excellent and it's great to hear them again.<br />But, one of CCR's best tracks is their unique rendition of Suzie Q and on this album there is only a shortened version of it which is a real let-down.  It should be made clear before buying an album whether the tracks featured are full-length - maybe Amazon could include track timings along with the listings.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I just want to say if this does not win the Grammy for best album of the year there is no justice!!!  Not only are the musical arrangements and performances superior..but he truly is a genius and eclectic.  There are so many different styles including Texas Swing, Blues, Bluegrass....etc.....This is one of the most prolific songwriters of our time....and if you don't have this, get it!!!  If you have not heard it..you need too!!!
B00005UEAR|5.0|Dream Theater's Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence will stand out as a turning point for the band who has dominated progressive rock for the past decade.  Not content to fiddle around with formulas that have worked well for them in the past, and not interested in recording music that might play well on the radio, Dream Theater chose to put forth an intensely serious, introspective album that ignores established formulas for structuring rock songs and instead contains two hours of genuinely original music.<br />I am particularly impressed with disc 2, an epic song in multiple sections.  Exploring a wide range of emotions, both lyrically and musically, disc 2 is nothing short of a masterpiece.<br />My favorite track on either disc is &quot;Solitary Shell&quot; on which Petrucci shows his jazz chops, and Ruddess once again proves himself to be rock music's most phenomenal musician.<br />I would recommend this disc to fans of King Crimson, Yes, Rush, and Dream Theater's older music.  I would also recommend it to those who have enjoyed Tool and Radiohead's recent delvings into experimental music.  But most of all, I would recommend this to anyone who understands and appreciates great art, as Dream Theater is the very best that rock music has to offer.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|Like most people I was really skeptic upon seeing this movie. The trailer didn't look too promising so I waited for it to come out on DVD and decided to rent it instead. At first it didn't seem like it was going to be much of anything but once it got going it simply blew me away. Upon viewing you'd never imagine this movie to be as deep as it is. On all parts the acting is magnificant and the singing is easy to follow yet gorgeously breath-taking. They use classic songs like The Sound Of Music while also blending more modern songs ranging from Nirvana to Madonna to Lamb. I was also quite impressed to know that all the actors used their own voices instead of lip singing to professionals. Honestly, though, they all have amazing voices. You'd never once think that they were inexperienced. I mean, where in the world has Nicole Kidman been hiding? She's a much better singer than Jennifer Lopez yet she's so overlooked. Anyways, I especially enjoyed the hindu dance sequence towards the end with Nicole singing &quot;Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend&quot; in a very modern fashion. And while all this may seem a tad eccentric it all works quite well together.<br />This movie certainly deserves many oscars, including best picture. It's got comedy, romance, suspense, obsession, jealousy, love, confusion...while all remaining light and humerous. So the jest of this story is about how a popular courtisan (Nicole Kidman) whom entertains in the famous Moulin Rouge is caught between following her heart by staying with the man she loves (Ewan McGregor) whom is a writer in poverty or by following her dreams of marrying a wealthy Duke whom has promised to make her a star...<br />The DVD is much better than the VHS for it includes a lot of extra features such as behind-the-scenes footage as well as interviews with the stars and muscisians. You can also click on your favorite songs and dance scenes without having to rewind or fastforward like you would with the VHS. So if you haven't seen this movie yet than I suggest you do, even if you strongly beleive that this is going to be a silly musical.<br />P.S. - The ending will shock you greatly.een this movie yet than I suggest you do, even if you strongly beleive that this is going to be a silly musical.<br />P.S. - The ending will shock you greatly.
0800196767|5.0|The Matilda video has been a staple in our video collection for the last two years.  I love the movie because it is an encapsulation of the way life is - there are nasty people and good people, and everyone, even a little girl named Matilda can make a good life for herself, even by herself.  The movie is a female version of David and Goliath!  The movie has taught my girls that it's cool for girls to be smart, that kids can have control over their world, and that bad people get what they deserve!  Excellent movie!!
B00005QIPH|4.0|don't let an over-excited, viagra-deprived British press fool you. this band is not revolutionary and will not bang open new doors in your life. this is a very good album that's only weakness is a diversity in tricks. one of the few albums that you can say 'if you like one song, you'll like them all'.<br />this band has been around for quite a while... toiling underground. i only wish that the press could pick up on other (re: better) band like the White Stripes or the Cosmic Rough Riders - bands that actually deserve this type of praise.
B00005RHGK|2.0|This movie started out great.  It was edge of your seat scary with this nameless, faceless person terroizing these kids and no one is around to help them.  It even keeps up the fear level when they confront this person.... And then it falls apart!  The end, when this person is revealed, is such a let down that you just kind of say,\\"Well that was stupid\\".  Even my ten year old who was experiencing her first scary movie thought it was dumb.  If they could have thought of a more original ending instead of the cookie cutter it was, it would have been worthy of 5 stars.  So rent it don't buy it and enjoy the first two thirds.
B00004TH6O|5.0|This album is pure fun to listen to.  You'll find yourself laughing at some of the tracks due to the tongue in cheek humor that runs rampant throughout the album. <br />When you're not laughing, you'll be rocking out to some of the best and most creative guitar rock you've heard.  Yeah everyone has heard &quot;Feel Good Hit of the Summer&quot; but admit it, that has to be one of the best song titles you've ever heard considering the subjects which it adresses.  The rest of the album is a grab bag of straight forward rock (&quot;Lost Art of Keeping a Secret&quot;), psychadelic rock (&quot;Better living through Chemistry&quot;, &quot;Lightning Song&quot;), punk fused rock (&quot;Quick and to the Pointless&quot;) and classic Kyuss-esque stoner rock (&quot;Monsters in the Parasol&quot;).  <br />Will not dissapoint those who enjoyed the first album and newbies alike.  Highest Reccomendation.
B0000024UX|3.0|While I would love to say that this band was great, the duo ended up being for Paul Simon what the Police were for Sting-- a warm-up. Tracks like &quot;The Boxer&quot; and &quot;El Condor Pasa&quot; are brilliant, but the rest are very stodgy and show the signs of a growing rift in their sound. They imploded, but it wasn't a great loss. It was much like a ship's losing its ballast; the dead weight was gone and new cargo could be brought on board. The first track on Paul Simon's self-titled debut album has more punch than all of &quot;Bridge...&quot; put together.<BR>    BY the way &quot;Bridge..&quot; isn't even really a gospel song. It was inspired by a poster that Paul Simon saw. It had a black couple on it with the man saying &quot;like a bridge over troubled water, I will lay me down&quot;. So it's really a very powerful make-out song. Silvergirl really can sail on now! <BR>    And I too recommend you sail on past this album and focus on any of Paul's work after this and on through Graceland.
1558216847|5.0|a good book especially if you like a true story with an incredible adventure.  Its pages are addictive and easy flowing.
B000009QPE|5.0|Let's face it, if this album had never come out, the entire death/grind genre might never have existed, so I for one am very grateful for this.  This was the first \\"extreme\\" album ever to hit the world, and even today, its power is overwhelming.  The opening riff to \\"Angel of Death\\" is just so unbelievably menacing, a perfect indication of what's to come.  For 30 minutes, this album just never stops destroying.  Dave Lombardo is a very talented drummer, although his playing is often lost in the mix.  As a metal drummer, I really look up to this guy's skill, and definitely cite him as a strong influence (along with Doug Bohn, Alex Hernandez, and Flo Mournier).  I just love that intro to \\"Epidemic\\".  But really, all the musicians are in fine form here, and together they make an album that is almost too good to imagine.  I don't think this album still stands as the greatest metal album of all time (that would be Suffocation's \\"Pierced from Within\\"), but it still ranks high after all this time, and that alone is quite impressive.
B00005BJ2O|3.0|A soundtrack for a musical should have the pieces which drive the narrative, and this &quot;soundtrack&quot; fails in that regard.  All of the background music pieces which most people won't even remember from the film are included, but many of the pieces which actually told part of the story are left out.<br />Some of the pieces which are included that were actually a part of the musical itself have been altered, but usually with good reason.  &quot;Come What May&quot;, for instance, in the movie, is broken up by frequent cuts to dialogue and other action, and presenting it as it was in the film would have been a little confusing.<br />Despite its notable failures, I've still listened to the CD quite a bit, not having a better option, and it is still quite good.  Just disappointing that it's not as good as it could and should have been.
6305127689|3.0|the movie follows a very predictable formula of personal high, hit rock bottom then recover-at-the-end flow. impressive movie back then during its days but watching it over and over makes me want more out of the end dogfight scenes. [why did they include a-6 footages to show maverick in waiting at the catapults? clearly, the tomcat and the intruder have different undercarriage looks] nice sounds though....i like watching it for the thunderous sounds of the navy jets...nice cinematography on pilot rescue and tied-down tomcat on carrier deck...pick up a copy of the documentary dvds &quot;the story of top gun&quot; and firepower2000 if you're into military aviation...
B00003CXTG|1.0|This movie makes Battle Field Earth look like an Oscar winner. Even as someone who collects WWII movies, I cannot bring myself  to own this film. <br />With the exception of the 30-minute bombing sequence, the movie (plot, acting, script, etc.) is so unbearable that even a reasonably well done action sequence can't save it. The love triangle is pathetic; there is no chemistry between any of the actors; cliches abound in the script; the abundance of unrelated stories is perplexing (it's about pearl habor... no, it's about American pilots in Europe... no, it's about a love triangle... no, it's about the bombing raid on Japan ... no, it's about ... oh heck, forget it.) What it is not about is a decent movie. <br />With so many great war epics thoughout history, there is no reason to buy or even see this one. While no one should forget Pearl Habor, they will hopefully forget this setback in American movie making. If I had to say anything good about the movie, it would be that the opening scene with the kids admiring their father's crop duster made for a very promising open. Other than that, I can't imagine anyone thinking this was a good film... and I mean even if they were one of the people who worked on it.
0312979479|5.0|This was the first Agatha Christie book I ever read, but it was definatly not the last. Although the first chapter is a tad bit slow it gives you important information on the many characters. I love it when a book has a twist at the end, and this is a perfect example! This is one of the best books I've ever read, and I've read quite a few; I advise this to anyone who likes mystery and suspense books.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Mixing a few archive cuts with new versions of old time country classics recorded by some of the best roots oriented names (ie outside the Nashville mainstream) this soundtrack album has stunned Nashville by selling nearly five million copies without the benefit of much airplay.  In typical Nashville fashion, the &quot;country&quot; music industry has chosen to ignore this album's success as it continues to churn out formula easy listening music devoid of soul, character, and originality.  Stick it to Nashville and stick with the real deal.  This is a superb place to start.
B00003CXTG|5.0|Some of the critics blasted this but my wife and I really enjoyed it. But......I liked Titanic too.
B000000OQF|5.0|The opening riff in \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" sets the stage for possibly the best debut album since Jimi Hendrix's \\"Are You Experienced?\\". <br />The theme of the album is basically a reaction to sunny California.  A sort of hard rock version of the Eagle's Hotel California.  This theme is prevalent in the lyrics and attitudes of such classics as WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE, IT'S SO EASY and PARADISE CITY.<br />Guitarists Slash and Izzy Stradlin establish themselves as RIFF GODS on this album.  The two played dueling guitar in every song. Although Stradlin was the group's best songwriter, Slash played all the memorable riffs, such as the classic opening to the SWEET CHILD O' MINE.  <br />What's to say about Axl Rose?  The guy was one half Mick Jaggar and one half Robert Plant.  This guy hits notes so high you would think he got hit in the crouch one too many times.  Not that it's a bad thing. The songs sound great because of his primal screaming.  In songs like IT'S SO EASY and MR. BROWNSTONE, Axl sings much lower; it sounds almost like a different singer. <br />This album is a classic for its contrasting feeling and attitude. The songs switch between pure rage (IT'S SO EASY, WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE, OUT TA GET ME) and pure emotion (THINK ABOUT YOU, SWEET CHILD O' MINE).  Even without the lyrics you can hear a distinct difference in tone.<br />Ultimately, the Guns N' Roses never put out anything as good as APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION again.  USE YOUR ILLUSION I and II are classic as well for their varying styles of songs (blues, ballads, hard rock, etc.) and the use of new instruments.  THE SPAGHETTI INCIDENT was an attempt at punk that didn't fly, but APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION will remain as THE Guns N' Roses album.<br />Just buy it.  It's worth having in any classic rock/hard rock/heavy metal collection.
B00005Y228|5.0|Though well remembered stateside for her one-hit wonder status thanks in the late '80s to her 'Locomotion' remake, Kylie Minogue has remained a pop icon throughout much of Europe and her native Australia in the fifteen years since that dubious record made and subsequently ended her short career in the US.  With any justice, her eighth studio record FEVER will reverse her fortunes here.  While many are eating up the ridiculously catchy 'Can't Get You Out Of My Head', the album manages to go far deeper beyond that ubiquitous smash, thanks in large part to such supremely satisfying tracks as 'In You Eyes','Your Love','More More More' and 'Love At First Sight'(destined to be a Minogue classic).  The set's forward-thinking production only reinforces the album's appeal--those disenchanted with &quot;teen pop&quot;and &quot;rap metal&quot; would do themselves a huge disservice to overlook this dance/pop masterpiece.  And after you become subsequently emamored with this record(a foregone conclusion), pick up Minogue's equally classic 2000 set LIGHT YEARS, one of the best disco/dance albums of the last decade.

B00005U122|5.0|With all due respect to Jason Frekot, Roger Waters performs his Pink Floyd and solo material on this DVD to perfection.  OK, it's not Pink Floyd, but his band is excellent.  He has made every effort to be true to the original Floyd recordings, which in and of itself is a tribute to his old bandmates, including Syd.  Would we say that Paul McCartney or Ringo Starr can't sing any Beatles songs in concert, and that we should condemn them any time they do? No!  This concert is a wonderful trip through Roger Waters' musical history, well played, well produced and well worth owning.
B00005Y228|5.0|Having been a long time fan of Kylie, I was thrilled to finally see U.S. audiences take notice of La Diva's stunning brand of dance music. Each song on this album is a dance-pop confection, deliciously vibrant, exceptionally written, immaculately performed by Ms. Minogue. I purchased this cd months ago, when it first came out as an import, and it has been in my cd player ever since. My favorite tracks here are \\"Fragile\\", \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\", \\"In Your Eyes\\", and \\"Love at First Sight\\". Congrats, Kylie on your recent success in the U.S. and certainly on your flawless new cd!!! I can't get your music out of my head!!!
B00005Y228|5.0|Superb CD - The best CD of 2001/2002 (the UK version came out last year).  And we are lucky in the US to finally get some Kylie that we don't have to import!  :)<br />This CD is a natural progression from her 'Light Years' set (which I also highly recommend), but goes 1 step further.  KM shows vocal talent on the ballads, and pop diva wherewithall to nail the upbeat dancehall cuts.<br />This should be a must have for any pure pop fan.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I loved this movie &amp; I do not feel that I was &quot;deceived&quot; by &quot;mediocre art&quot;.  I just can't understand why those who don't like it insist that those who did are fools.  Some people just don't get it and some people do.  What's wrong with that?
B0000508U6|5.0|What a wonderfull compilation of songs.  This is what music is about.  Not about making songs just to get a lot of radioplay.  This is pure music that will relax you.  It is mellow and uplifting.  The songs seem to be blended perfectly with the voice and instrument levels being equal to avoid the annoying nature of an overbearing vocal found in many popular songs.  My favorite songs are: yellow, everything's not lost, shiver, and trouble.  This is a purchase you won't regret.  A must for anyones collection.
B000000OUW|5.0|This album is a masterpiece! Second only to previous<BR>release The Triumph of Steel.Although the bass lines may<BR>seem repetitive and the drumwork not overly impressive,the<BR>sheer power of the Manowar sound is enough to make this one <BR>of the best metal recordings of all time!Eric's vocals are as<BR>productive as ever and the emotion he puts behind his singing<BR>is second to none!There is something about this music that just<BR>feels real.It has such a strong spiritual message that is relat-<BR>ive to us all.Every song on this album is just plain and simple<BR>great moving music! True Music for True People!!
B00004RHZU|5.0|This album is a declaration of independence and strength from a female artist.  Unique yet wonderfull.  A breath of fresh air in an industry loaded with TLC wannabes.  'Most Girls' is the song that introduces us to who pink is.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I felt the need to write a review for this fantastic album after watching the Grammy Awards this evening.  India.Arie deserved to win every award for which she was nominated!  She has a delicate and rich voice and strikes an excellent balance between soul, folk, hi-hop, and jazz on this record.  I highly recommend this one!
B00005V9QJ|5.0|I didn't know this album was coming -or out (Hey, I've been busy!).  I entered a record store that was playing 'Is it A Crime'.  Vintage Sade, of course. I had it already.  Then I heard a crowd in the background.  Is this live?  Yes-and the cashier presented the cover. Normally I don't go for live albums, for all the reasons previous naysayers have mentioned.  But the excellent, live performance of  'Crime'  grabbed me. I checked the list on back to see what other gems were included. 'No Ordinary Love', too?  'Jezebel'? Cool, I added the cd to my shopping cart. It might turn out to be like any other live album (bad sound), but hey, I'm a fan -it's still a collector, right?<br />Then, on my way to the beach, I put it on in the car.  I almost ran off the road.  To sum it up, I'll restate what I overhead another shopper say in the record store:  there's NOBODY like this woman.  Her style, vocals, etc., cannot be duplicated.  As a testament, consider this: she disappeared for nearly 10 years.  She comes back, makes a live album in followup to \\"Lovers Rock\\" containing 10-15 year old songs. AND THEY STILL ROCK TODAY, LIKE THEY DID WHEN FIRST RELEASED.  MAYBE MORESO. This would be defined as TIMELESS.<br />Another testament: I'm an active Amazon buyer -with many favorite artists -who NEVER takes time to write reviews.  Buy 'Lovers Live.'
B00004YW6I|5.0|I have been a Polly Jean fan for quite a while.  I find this album to be the perfect blend of everything she has done.  Do not mistake me, this album is not a one way ticket to the music of PJ Harvey, but its a great start.  I have heard some people complain after they've bought and loved this album.  They cannot reconcile her earlier work, which can be raw and sometimes unpolished, with this album.  Every album this woman has made is unique and worth it.  This one is just more polished.
B00005QIPH|4.0|After listening to the Strokes first album, I have to assume that all rock bands wish for a debut this strong and solid.  The Strokes combine distorted vocals and some nice, basic guitar for a sound that is not new, but is so vintage, it sounds new again.  While the fuzzy voice may get overdone, the overall album is very good, with only one or two throwaway songs.  &quot;Is This It&quot; shows the promise of a future great American rock band.
6303942830|5.0|This is my all-time favorite movie. If you love action, history and romance, look no further.<br />Purists, be warned: This movie deviates greatly from James Fenimore Cooper's book. The characters are the same, but the plot bears little resemblance to Cooper's. (In my mind, this is OK, because I much prefer Michael Mann's movies to Cooper's books.)<br />In the movie version, Hawkeye/Nathaniel (Daniel Day Lewis, looking mighty fine) is a frontiersman. He is the adopted son of Chingachgook and the adopted brother Uncas. In their travels, they come across a Huron war party's tracks. They arrive as the war party attacks a group of English soldiers en route to another fort, escorting a colonel's two daughters (Madeleine Stowe and Jodhi May, both of whom do an excellent job here).<br />Nathaniel, Chingachgook and Uncas save the day and offer to take the girls and their friend, Maj. Duncan Heyward, to their father. When they get to the fort, though, it is under attack -- and it turns out that the colonel had warned his daughters not to come. Magwa, the scout who had led them into the trap, had killed the messengers and intended to kill the girls.<br />Love blooms between Nathaniel and Cora (Stowe). There are some incredibly romantic scenes, most memorably the one in the cave behind the waterfall. Uncas and Alice (May) also fall in love, although this is not explored very much. After a repeat viewing, you will notice the subtle looks and emotions better.<br />After some chase scenes across spectacularly beautiful countryside (New York in the movie, North Carolina in real life), the movie culminates in an epic battle between Magua and Uncas, Chingachgook and Nathaniel. If you love this movie, you really should have the widescreen edition. The scenery here is so gorgeous that it's a shame to miss so much of it on the \\"pan and scan\\" version.<br />A word about Jodhi May: I think she is spectacular in this movie, especially since she was only 17 when it came out. After seeing this, I watched her performances in \\"Aristocrats,\\" \\"A Turn of the Screw\\" and \\"House of Mirth\\" and continued to be impressed.is, I watched her performances in \\"Aristocrats,\\" \\"A Turn of the Screw\\" and \\"House of Mirth\\" and continued to be impressed.
6302814359|5.0|Some people don't like horror movies, it's just too bad for them. Horror is my ultimate favorite. And I think Return of the Living Dead 2 is the best zombie movie ever made.<BR> It fits in the horror category, but is also a comedy. It's definitly way more entertaining than Return of the Living Dead (but I liked that too). The zombie movements are hysterical. They all look like they're all having spaz attacks through the entire movie...
B00005U18E|5.0|Like many others, I was unhappy when I heard that Texan Renee Zellweger was cast as Bridget Jones. How was a svelte American supposed to play the beloved, blubbery, British Bridget? But Zellweger carries off the role beautifully. She's not afraid to seem as awkward, as perpetually embarrassed and as chubby as the book Bridget.<br />To those unfamiliar with the plot, here's a summary: Bridget is a thirtysomething Brit who struggles with her weight and her dead-end job -- as well as her lust for office scoundrel Daniel (Hugh Grant). Her overbearing mother keeps trying to set her up with Mark Darcy (Colin Firth from the BBC &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;), whom Bridget despises.<br />The plot bears a vague resemblance to &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; overall -- making Firth's casting rather clever, especially given Bridget's obsession with him in the second book, &quot;Edge of Reason.&quot;<br />As in &quot;Pride and Prejudice,&quot; our heroine discovers that the handsome, charming man is not quite what he seems -- and neither is the proud, arrogant one.<br />The dialogue here is clever and the acting is superb. This is one of those rare chick flicks that overcomes its genre on the strength of its humor: My boyfriend was playing a football game on his computer while this was on, and he had a hard time pretending he wasn't watching!
0920668372|5.0|What's the one thing small children want to know for sure all the time?  That they are truly loved.  And that is the message of this book.  The story, such as it is, is not all that complicated--throughout a boy's life his mother is there-admittedly, in some contexts, in some off the wall ways--to tell her son she loves him--totally, deeply, forever.  By the end, the woman is very old, the son is a man, and he is rocking his elderly mother and telling her--he loves her--deeply, totally and forever.<br />After reading all these \\"this book is creepy\\" reviews I gave the book to my 20 year old son and 16 year old daughter and said \\"Remember this book?  What do you think of it now\\" and both said they still liked it and that it made them cry. (Actually son said it's a tear-jerker but sweet, and I'm translating that, but you get the picture)<br />Don't let the Nay Sayers sway you from this title.<br />To all those who think it's \\"creepy\\", I suggest you consider whether the problem resides within the book or within your own hearts.
B00005LC1H|5.0|I have 9 episodes on VHS of the wonderful Fawlty Towers and plan on buying the whole DVD set.  If you love British Comedy or Monty Python, then you will ADORE Fawlty Towers!  The cast meshes so well together!  It's a shame there aren't more episodes!  My favorite episode is &quot;Basil, The Rat.&quot;  Personally I would give it 10 stars or more on the hilarity scale!  Buy and Enjoy!
B00000253N|5.0|As has been well documented over the year, Dylan's Blood on the Tracks was in large part inspired by the emotional trauma associated with his splitting up with his wife, Sara.  What has always separated Dylan from the pack is his lyricism, and that talent is on full display here, What sets the album apart even from most of Dylan's best work is the musicianship, which is extremely impressive and varied for a Dylan album, and the emotional impact of the album.  Dylan has always made important music, often inspirational music, always thought provoking music.  But, for the most part, it is cerebral music-songs of the intellect.  Here, Dylan moves down the anatomy spectrum to the heart, an organ that by the end of the album will be in shreds.<br />It will be in shreds, however, not so much from the angst and pain-though both of those elements are in ample supply-but also from the bittersweet mix of remaining love and fondness and recognition of the good times as well as the bad.  And so, the searing pain of Tangled up in Blue, Idiot Wind and You're a Big Girl Now are counter posed against the fonder, gentler more evocative echoes of reaming love felt in You're Going to Make Me Lonesome When You Go, Buckets of Rain and If You see Her, Say Hello.  Bridging the gap between the two camps are the more detached and philosophical Simple Twist of Fate &  Meet Me in the Morning.<br />By the end we've run the emotional gamut, we've ridden the emotional roller coaster, and our heart lays in taters, mainly because we've all, at some point, felt all of this and been frustrated that we are not a Dylan who can articulate in words what our hearts scream out as feeling.<br />This is a masterpiece.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|This movie is a very bad representation of a very good video game!  When the original Tomb Raider video game was released, it revolutionized the gaming industry.  Never before had a game possessed such excellent 3-D graphics and gameplay.  Combined with a solid storyline that involves deceit, treachery, and a hint of supernatural, and you've literally got the video game equivalent to Raiders of the lost Ark, one of the greatest movies of all time!<BR>The Tomb Raider movie is far less dynamic.  It doesn't have a good storyline like the game and lacks the cleverness and whit of an Indiana Jones movie so, instead, you get a rip-off of both!  The action is far too fast-paced to be even remotely believable.  Furthermore, the end of the movie is EXTREMELY anti-climactic (nuff said).  Anyone who is a fan of the excellent video game or of Spielberg's superb Indian Jones movies will be very (I stress very) disappointed with the Tomb Raider movie.  Not even worth renting.
B00005UEAR|4.0|I have been a fan of progressive music since its nadir (the late '80s), but I have always had trouble getting into Dream Theater.  They just seemed to resort too often to bombastic double-bass-drum-16th-note assault metal riffing or nauseatingly cheesy keyboard fluff.  I never really gave them a chance until a drummer I was in a band with told me I HAD to hear &quot;Scenes from a Memory.&quot;  I bought it and thought it was fairly decent, although it did have moments that were hard to swallow.<br />That being said, I decided to suspend my usual bias and purchased a copy of this album without having heard a note.  Overall, I am very impressed.<br />To be sure, there are still a few moments I could do without (like the entire &quot;Overture&quot; on disc 2), but still this album manages to put the band's bombastic riffing inclinations to good use, delicately balanced with a wider range of styles and more subtle, nuanced performances than I have heard in the past.  I think it stays true to the best of what this band is capable of, so longtime fans should be happy, plus it expands on their usual style in ways that should draw in new listeners as well.<br />If you're a prog rock fan who, like me, has usually -- perhaps unduly -- discredited DT, you should do yourself a favor and give this album a chance.
B00003CX5P|3.0|I only gave it 3 stars because of the special effects.  Was George Lucas so intent on getting the newest special effects right that he forgot about the characters that we all want to get to know and love?  Liam Neeson was so boring, his performance so flat that I had to wonder if he was mad because his character dies in the movie and he just read his lines and showed up on the set when required.  George, George, you can do better!  Even the kid's haircut was so cereal bowl-typical Hollywood... yea, the kid was an okay actor, but that was it!  None of the other actors are worthy of mentioning.  Perhaps it wasn't their fault, perhaps if they'd had better supporting actors around them they would have had a little more personality or spark.  My husband and I liked the &quot;how they made the movie&quot; segment better than the film itself.  PLEASE!  Make this one up to us Star Wars fans!! Give us some characters we can get involved with in future Star Wars epics.
0440180295|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five is increadable.  It is a book that gets better every time you read it.  His style of writting is fast paced and full of things you won't catch the first time.  His unique narrative sets this book apart from all other novels I have read and his message is profound.  A must read for everyone.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|Just about the most perfect musical ever made! I've seen this film so many times that I've lost count! Each performance is absolute perfection! It is so much more than \\"just a musical\\". It is a slice of life from a long gone era. If you are a Garland fan you simply cannot miss this one. She is simply stunning to look at and that voice...that spectacular voice...<BR>WHERE IS THE DVD? HURRY, HURRY...WE NEED THE DVD!!!
0679721037|2.0|This story retraces the steps of six of the survivors of the blast from the atomic bomb dropped by the United States on Japan on August 6, 1945, which claimed over one hundred thousand lives.  The details described by the six were similar in many regards: the frequency of the sirens signaling U.S. air raids in the days preceding the bombs; the silence accompanying the flash of white light when the bomb hit; the people lying broken and dying in the parks and streets of the city; the fires blazing in every neighborhood.<br />The horror that accompanied the attack and its aftermath is recounted vividly.  The hospitals couldn't initially handle the throngs of wounded that flocked there, and only the absolute sickest could be treated with any urgency.  People literally melted in the streets.  Survivors contracted radiation sickness from the bomb's fallout that lasted for years, oftentimes leading to cancers.  Prejudice predominated against survivors of the blast (who were called \\"hibakusha,\\" or \\"explosion-affected persons\\", and whose average life expectancy was 62), who found themselves without government aid and as objects of discrimination by employers.<br />I learned a lot about an event that is described quickly in most history textbooks, in addition to the above-mentioned details.  For instance, the book describes a surprising indifference within Japan to the ethics of dropping this weapon of mass destruction.  However, the overall tone of the book shares that indifference.  Things were described clinically, which tended to belie their magnitude, and the third person omniscient narration didn't convey the panic which the survivors must have felt.  The character development was pretty lousy, too, and I would have traded the six shoddily-developed characters for a single well-developed one.<br />As an important aside, it is hard to avoid drawing parallels between the WWII climate and the current post-September 11th war we are currently engaged in.  Despite being horrified to read about the details of the atomic bomb fallout, I strongly feel that use of these weapons of mass destruction may be warranted against nations such as Iran and Iraq.  I realize this is serious language, but the magnitude of Hiroshima as a deterrent cannot be underestimated in terms of the protection it offered Americans (including the soldiers that did not have to risk their lives in battle).  For someone who believes in protecting us the citizens of this nation at any costs, it is a very realistic option that shouldn't be taken lightly, but should not be ignored or followed by the word \\"never.\\"orrified to read about the details of the atomic bomb fallout, I strongly feel that use of these weapons of mass destruction may be warranted against nations such as Iran and Iraq.

B000060MWU|1.0|I had been waiting so long for this movie - probably my favourite David Lynch - to come out on DVD that I grabbed the Canadian import the moment I saw it... unfortunately it is by far the worst quality commercial DVD I have ever seen. <br />The format is pan-and-scan (i.e. 4:3 ratio) only and the image quality is appalling. The sound (Dolby, supposedly) is little better. It is basically unwatchable. Another user review says that the DVD is somewhat better than VHS - I would say the image quality is on par with VHS, and certainly not worth the four stars that reviewer gave it; I cannot imagine how any DVD could be worse than this one.<br />I am sure that David Lynch had nothing to do with this hastily cobbled together sham. He fine tunes his DVDs (even to the extent of removing chapters from \\"The Straight Story\\") and I am sure he would be furious to see his movie butchered in this way.<br />This DVD is of the quality I would expect if I bought the damn thing from a street vendor in Shanghai; ...

0440219078|5.0|The gist of THE GIVER is given in the other reviews, so there's no need to explain it here again. I bought this book at a book fair when I was still in elementary school. I read it then, and found the book to be fascinating, yet somewhat confusing. Now I am in college, and have reread the book. The category listed for the book is \\"Young Adult\\" but do not let that keep you from ever reading this book. Lois Lowry delves into subjects that some people would shy away from: How far will people go to perfect themselves? What is life like without stimulus? The contemplation of these things and the realization of how important the experiences we have every day are at the heart of the book. What defines humanity, and what happens if we take that away? This is a fantastic book. One should read it, and then reflect upon it.
B00005AAFS|5.0|After listening to Rammstein's previous releases, it was hard to imagine that the band could continue to put out such fabulous work... but it's true. An excellent addition to the Rammstein library, a continuation of what they have done all along. Mutter is just an unbelievable album that explores new musical textures for the band, without straying far from what has made them so great up to this point. I think any fan of true metal will love this CD. It's a must-have. Forget about what you have heard... anyone I know who listened to this band instantly becomes a fan. Nobody who has listened to this album that I know has given this Cd anything but high praise. Mutter is a masterpiece that I put in the same league as such metal classics as Black Sabbath's &quot;Paranoid&quot;, Slayer's &quot;Reign In Blood&quot;, Judas Priest's &quot;Screaming For Vengeance&quot;... it is that good. It's a modern album that should be considered a new classic. It's more &quot;epic metal&quot; than &quot;industrial&quot;. Fans young and old will enjoy this. I can't wait for the next album.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|the only reason i wanted to see this movie was because ewan mcgregor was in it. i was glad that it turned out to be a good movie. i thought they did an excellent job making it and picking the actors they did to star in it. i think that if you don't like musicals you still should give it a chance. the story line itself is pretty good. and the music?? well, they did use alot of lyrics that i'm sure you would know.
6304298285|1.0|\\"Jack\\" is an atrocious little chunk of excrement that is about as funny as a toothache! <br />In \\"Jack\\" we find Robin Williams as a boy who just happens to grow four times the normal rate physically (when he is five he has the body of a 20 year old, when he is ten he has the body of a 40 year old, etc). However, his mental growth matches his actual age, leading to obvious problems. <br />The concept is truly an original and fascinating one with the potential for many laughs. Unfortunately, \\"Jack\\" is poorly executed, relying heavily on tasteless crudity devoid of wit. <br />Robin Williams would seem to be the perfect pick for this boy stuck in an adult's body. However, Robin is a major disappointment; Roger Ebert hit the nail on the head in his review in which he points out that this is Robin Williams being Robin Williams, not Robin Williams playing a ten year old with a 40 year old's body. Robin is silly, but he never exhibits the honest emotions and reactions of an actual child.<br />Perhaps the most disappointing and shocking aspect of \\"Jack\\" is that it was directed by Francis Ford Coppola! I had to do a triple take when looking at the credits! I would have expected so much more from one of the best directors of all time! If I were Coppola, I would have had \\"Allen Smithee\\" direct this boondoggle, if you know what I mean.
B00005RYQO|5.0|This movie was awesome! I admit, I didn't want to see it at first, but after I did, I was totally into it! And for all of you TF&TF haters out there that are saying there was no plot or storyline....were you even paying attention? There was a huge storyline going on! Hello-do trucks being jacked and all the love stories going on ring a bell?!?! And I'm sick and tired of people who claim that the major problems with movies today are that the dialogue isn't real enough...and yet you all complain when a movie, in this case TF&TF, try to talk like normal people do. And as for those of you who complain that the ending [stunk]..that's because they're making a sequel and wanted to leave you hanging, genuis. Anyways, that's all I had to say....and I strongly suggest buying or renting this movie!
B00005UEAR|5.0|I was a little worried when I bought this CD the day after it came out. The success of Metropolis would seem almost impossible to out do. The whole setting of the Metropolis seemed flawless in every aspect. So when I first placed the CD in my car stereo, it was like waiting for an AIDS test to come back, the sensation of not knowing what the outcome will be. What I heard when the first track began was the rain effect and the chime sound, followed by a well placed power chord to set the song. From then on the song kept on getting better and beter. The entire 2 CD set was like that too. The opener (The Glass Prison) was enough to get me hooked to the entire album. The sheer intensity fixed with the melodic patterns laced in with the vocals were simply uncanny. The one thing that had bothered me in the past was James' constant hitting of the high notes. That was changed here. The high notes were only used when it was needed. The distortion of James' voice in the first track was very well planned and sounds spectacular. I think I will play it right now. . . ok, now for a breakdown of the band members. Portnoy has once again showed that he has the power to play better than any other drummer I can think of, being a drummer I hail him as my influence and inspiration. Petrucci has come up with some genius guitar riffs (Misunderstood), althoughI am a drummer, I know a good guitarist when I hear one. Myung has seemed to take a bigger step into the main stage with this album, he plays more openly and doesn't just follow anymore. Which is a VERY good thing. Jorden gets the chance not only to show off his insane and completely amazing keyboard antics and speed (every track on the friggin CD). But also his composition skills on the second CD  (6 Degrees of Inner Turbulance - Overture) when he organizes a complete orchistrated melody! He's like the modern Mozart! James, like I said before, has found his true voice and is now using it to it's full capabilities. The distortion, thecrypticness and overall control of his voice makes the CD a mind trip the whole way through. All in all this has to be Dream Theater's pinnacle in their career with this CD, because if Dream Theater is capable of putting out anything better than this. They should be honored and recognized as the next step in human evolution. It just doesn't get any better than this. I'll be seein them in Philly (they didn't get to pittsburgh). And I already know that it will be the greatest show I have ever seen. This CD is for any person that knows music and knows the difference between a hit and a masterpiece. Because there is no single band out there that can hold a candle to the knights of music, Dream Theater.
B000059R8Y|4.0|As a member of the baby boom generation I'll admit I'm (just a little) bit biased towards legends like Eric Clapton, but no matter how you slice it, with Reptile, Clapton once again displays unmatched musicianship and willingness to stretch beyond what he was. And that's good for all of us. Thanks Eric, for so much great music and inspiration over the years.
B000050XEI|5.0|I bought this cd along with Paint the sky with stars.  I must say this is the greatest cd I own.  I have never heard anything like Enya.  Her angelic beauty, to music is outstanding.  I feel so happy when I listen to this cd.  A day without rain, is a very beautiful cd from start to finish.  I love every song my only complaint is it's too short.  I remember downloading this cd, for my ex-girlfriend's brother.  I thought it was crap then a month ago I heard only time.  It made me just close my eyes.  It was snowing when I heard it.  So I just felt like I was floating then my friend let me use.  Paint the Sky with Stars and A day without Rain.  I fell in love with those albums.  To think I quit, listening to rap for awhile.  Thank you Enya for opening my eyes, to your beautiful voice.  She is so wonderful Wild Child is so beautiful, you can't help but smile.  They don't make music like this anymore.  I will be buying her older stuff. Just to hear the beauty this woman can offer.  When I take the train downtown. I just pop Enya in and my mind gets refreshed. Especially Flora's Secret.  She just keeps me mesmerized.  I am not disappointed in her cd at all.  She sounds so romantic, when she says adios :).  On one by one keep the hits coming Enya very talented woman.  I just close my eyes to your music.  Yeah I know, I sound crazy but music never sounded this good.  Thank you for your time good day.
B00003CXA6|5.0|An outstanding movie - gripping, subtle, and engaging.  Yes, parts of it seem somewhat romanticized for film (Chamberlain's speeches, various wistful glances) but even those are probably not too far from possible truth.  One thing which continually stirrs up controversy, apparently, is Sheen's depiction of Lee.  I thought it was sensitive, compelling, and possibly quite accurate.  Senile?  I don't think so.  Careless and/or irresponsible?  Nope.  It is true that his actions in that campaign stirred up his own commanders (who debated it years after the war and Lee's death).  I still get chills watching Sheen in this role.  Lee's evident sincerity, commitment, and absolute dedication are all apparent.  Someone commented that \\"it's amazing his men didn't shoot him\\", or something like that...  I think this is a remarkably myopic thing to write...  remember - this was just one campaign in a long war, and Lee had won many victories prior (and after).
6301640659|5.0|A BRILLIANT vison by William Friedkin, equally enhanced by Al Pacino's naive cop on the beat, searching for an eluisive and brutal serial killer amidst the shadows of New York's 'alternate life styles' circa 1980. This much maligned movie is one of Mr. Friedkin's finest excursions into forbidden territory.<br />CAUSED quite a stir in pre-release; a disclaimer had to be added, BUT for that matter it could have been set in ANY 'world', although this one did mannage to jolt a few times ....<br />Yes, Pacino is the naive cop - slowly awakening to 'other' potentials in this cold-hearted world of the beautiful people. It's a strange trip, you never quite know who you might bump into along the way - straight or gay - it seems to be open season, as for 'casual sex' beware! BUT that was back then.....<br />NOT too explicit for its time - the editing is flawless [the opening seduction scene, the graphic, yet 'non-graphic' sex, [SUPERB EDITING] then the subsequent murder - somewhat reprised in Verhoven's 'Basic Instinct' - also caused quite a fuss - and a companion piece to this one].<br />The story falls apart when we find 'our killer' or is this intentional? Now, does the focus fall on Pacino and his girlfriend - Karen Allen -  totally oblivious of her lover's change [maybe?] Wonderful and scary moment when Pacino is making love to Allen - proving ........?<br />AND the conclusion? All Studs and leather .....<br />BUT it's all quite tame, remember all of this is set pre-cybersex.<br />Would be fascinating to re-visit this theme along the computer-chip route.<br />Highly recommended for the uninitiated - but be warned - it can be quite a bumpy ride!<br />[PS - GREAT Soundtrack too!]

B00004XOWM|5.0|I recently bought this CD for my six year old son and he loves it so much!  He is jumping round the house singing and dancing to all the songs.  Some of the lyrics they have just tickle me pink.  I bought this after he heard the song &quot;Rollin'&quot; and now he loves every one, and so do I.  Our favourite tracks are &quot;Hot Dog&quot;, &quot;My Generation&quot;, &quot;Rollin'&quot; and &quot;Getcha Groove On&quot;, but we love them all.  It changed my son's life completely.  He has changed his attitude and wants to be more like them.  He wants a tatoo and earring.  I said yes to the earing, but I said he could have a tatoo when he's ten.  He's so cute!  I reccomend this to anyone!  It's a perfect CD!
0446677450|5.0|This is not a book to get rich. Getting Rich is entirely up to you and your plan. Though, the thinking taught in this book can start you on your way. It is easy to read and the concept amazingly simple. At worst it will inspire you in a way that will at least keep you from living paycheck to paycheck with a little patience. At best, if you have a financial plan to get rich this will help that foundation for some financial decisions you may have to make along the way.<br />If you already pay cash and don't carry credit card debts than you need a much more advanced book.

I've really enjoyed reading his well-researched novels and look forward to many, many more.  Thanks, Dan!
B00005QG9J|5.0|Incubus has done it again.  This cd has a mix of so many different sounds.  This cd makes their previous cd (Make Yourself) look small.  They have songs that have the rock-n-roll sound to them.  And then there are other traks that have a calm and soothing sound.  If you liked any of the other Incubus cds, you will like this one.  The sound is somewhat the same but they add a little more to it.  Incubus just keeps getting better.  This could be one of the best cds they've made.  If you get a chance, I highly reccommend buying this cd.
B00005U122|5.0|I put off buying Roger Waters live double-CD \\"In the Flesh\\", knowing that there was to be a DVD release of the same material later on. Well, once the DVD was released I popped it in my player not really knowing what to expect musically or visualy, now all I can say is...WOW!!! This is an EXCEPTIONAL concert DVD with detailed, crystal-clear audio (perhaps the best I've ever heard), excellent stage visuals, creative direction and camera work, and of course, an EXCELLENT band of musicians that really breathe new life into Waters/Floyd's music! Snowy White, Doyle Bramhall II, and Andy Fairweather Low make for a fine guitar trio, more than covering for the absence of the David Gilmore's, Eric Clapton's, and Jeff Beck's who played on the original versions of these songs. The keyboard work of Andy Wallace and Jon Carin captures all of those little details and \\"nuances\\" from the old Pink Floyd recordings. Graham Broad is a strong, dynamic drummer (superior to Pink Floyd's Nick Mason in my opionion), and the three female backing vocalist really help to beef-up the arrangements on several occassions - in fact, the Floyd classic \\"Mother\\" seems all the more appropriate with a woman's voice singing the chorus! As the master of ceremonies, Roger Waters mans his bass guitar for most of the show (occassionaly strumming rhythm guitar while Fairwheather Low handles bass duties), and his dark, unique voice (although some may criticize it's lack of range) bristles with real emotion and energy here...it's obvious that Roger FEELS the words as he sings them! Being a fan and follower of Waters solo career, I was quite happy to see several songs from his excellent \\"Amused To Death\\" album included here (\\"Perfect Sense\\", \\"The Bravery of Being Out of Range\\", \\"It's A Miracle\\", and the title track), these songs are probably the highlight of the show for me - and the strong anti-war messages of the \\"Amused To Death\\" songs seem all the more relevent and thought-provoking when listened to in post-September 11th America! (Although sometimes seen as a \\"ranting radical\\", Waters is probably one of the most wise and brave voices in music today; using his art to promote peaceful solutions to the world's ills...instead of the mindless jingo-ism of, say, Paul McCartney's popular pro-war jingle \\"Freedom\\"!) Of the extensive Pink Floyd material covered here one big highlight was the emotion-packed full-length version of \\"Dogs\\" - this version even includes the atmospheric keyboard/drum duet in the middle, and surpasses the excellence of the original studio version in my opinion! I also felt that \\"Set Control For the Heart of the Sun\\" sounded more bright and vital here than I've ever heard it before. Some other Floyd highlights (for me at least) would have to include \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\", \\"Time\\", \\"Southhampton Dock\\", and \\"Mother\\"...I only wish that \\"The Final Cut\\" would have been included right after \\"Southhampton\\", like it is on the original album! For an encore we are treated to a new Waters song, titled \\"Each Small Candle\\". The lyrics of \\"Candle\\" are a thoughtfully-crafted call to wage mercy instead of fear, and peace instead of war; and the darkly-colored music adds intensity to the message, and grows stronger with repeated listens. Do I have any criticisms of this DVD? Well, I would have liked to have heard MORE of Waters solo material (nothing is featured here from \\"Radio KAOS\\", and only one track is featured from \\"Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking\\"), since there seems to be a very uneven balance between Floyd and solo tracks here (around 90 minutues of Floyd, but only 45 minutes or so of Roger's solo work.) There are already several high-quality official live recordings of MOST of these Floyd classics - but Roger's live solo work is much more of rariety, isn't it? However, any small disappointment aside; this is an EXCELLENT concert DVD, and should NOT be missed by any Roger Waters fan! Oh' and one other thing; if your DVD machine has a headphone jack, listen to this disc through a good set of stereo headphones...the mix, channel seperations, and clarity of sound is AMAZING!!!o this disc through a good set of stereo headphones...the mix, channel seperations, and clarity of sound is AMAZING!!!
0743201140|5.0|First of all I want to say the themes and your top five findings should not be taken as the gospel.  Now having said that, I really think the books provides guidiance to individuals who want to identify or confirm their beliefs about what talents come natural to them. And yes, everyone has talents!  I think it is an excellent read for up and coming high school freshmen who are on the verge of discovering themselves and potential careers.  While for the most part, the book should not steer one away from a particular career (in some cases maybe it should), it should help determine how your talents can best be used in your choosen career path.  It should be required reading for raising freshmen prior to entering high school.
0380002930|5.0|Reading this book was the best experience i have ever had. It opened my eyes and broadend my horizons. It's basicly about a group of rabbits who leave their warren and try to find a new home. It makes you think like a rabbit and feel their feelings. I am reading the book again and I am still learning and discovering new things about Hazel (The main character) and his compainions. A must read for anyone who can read English. YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!
B00005QDW1|5.0|When I first heard this album's lead single, Hey Baby, I was less than enthused about No Doubt's new direction. Then I realized that it all makes sense. No Doubt have never been the band to pin themselves on one style, and this was simply another evolution of their unique sound.<br />Rock Steady opens with a 27 second introduction set over a few spacey blips and fueled by Gwen Stefani's echoing voice, and moments after this ends, the thudding drum beats of Hella Good begin. The song sounds like a b-side from an 80s Madonna song, but its fusion with Tom Dumonts guitar riffs and electro fuzz surrounding every note he plays give it the originality it deserves. Very danceable song.<br />Next up is the reggae/hip hop/dancehall hybrid of Hey Baby, and with its infectious chorus, guest rapping and smooth keyboard sounds, you become very aware of why this was chosen as the first single; it's pure fun and pure pop. Following this blending of styles is the somewhat calmer Making Out, featuring Stefani's sing-speak alternations (speaking on the verses and singing on the chorus). The band taps Blondie here, and then adds some dance in for flavor.<br />Track 5, Underneath it All, is the most sedate track so far. The song has a reggae beat and some gorgeous lyrics, plus the addition of Lady Saw singing a tricky bridge.<br />Detective follows up the previous track and marks the band's return to Gwen's romantic issues as a trademark resource for lyrical content. The entire song is awash in synthesizers and sounds a bit dark, giving the song a moodier feeling.<br />The second half of the album seems better than the first, if thats possible..<br />Don't Let Me Down is a return to 80s new wave-pop, and it is VERY nicely done. The song sparkles and shimmers as Gwen's voice wraps itself around every synth produced buzz and poppy keyboard note played. The guitar whines right along with the other instruments, and it has a very nostalgic effect.<br />Start the Fire is a bit on the slow side; the song is a very sexual dancehall tune with Gwen's voice taking on a smoother sound than normal.<br />Running is this album's masterpiece. The song opens with a chiming keyboard lullabye which soon evolves into a spiderweb-fragile sounding guitar and Gwen's equally fragile vocal mannerisms. Gwen is backed up by a breathy version of her voice as the drums kick in and the beautiful, head over heels lyrics penetrate your heart. Eventually, the instruments become sparse and become stars with trailing tails as the vocals break up and echo, and then once again become a solid entity. The entire thing sounds like it comes from a music box.<br />In My Head is an odd song that sounds like a rather half hearted attempt at trying ska again, but without horns or Gwen's slicing lyrics, No Doubt can seemingly never traverse that road again. It is a good song, however, and Stefani's wail of 'IN MY HEAD, ITS ONLY IN MY HEAD!' adds a dimension of darkness to the lyrics.<br />Platinum Blonde Life is the album's weakest track. The guitars are a bit too jagged in comparison with the rest of the album, and Gwen's voice is far too layered. Its still not THAT bad, though.<br />Waiting Room is a very jumpy collaboration with Prince that sounds better than most of his recent solo work.. go figure. The beats are fast and furious and it's a very danceable song.<br />Rock Steady, the title track, closes this album with a purr. It features a very uncluttered instrumental section with blips and synths going off all over the place; its very calming.<br />This album is definetly a must have. It's a refreshing thing to see No Doubt flipping through a different end of the pop rolodex for once.
B00005R2M3|3.0|Although packed with fun, upbeat music, Shakira's &quot;Laundry Service&quot; seems a step back from her &quot;Donde Estan los Ladrones&quot; days.  She seems too have sold out to the US teenage crowd and I am now a bit embarrassed that I own this CD!  Shakira has transformed from an independent, creative musician to just another Britney Spears and God knows we don't need another one of those! I think the cover says it all-another thin, blond, barely dressed woman selling her body instead of her music.

Since the legends of Arthur and his knights are very well known, there wasn't a whole lot of creative license Bradley could take with the tale.

0688170528|5.0|THis is a moving, long story whose protagonists are two adolescents,Chris and Emily. Having grown up together, they were as close as two sides of the same paper.  The themes are close friendship, suicide, sexual abuse.  So well written, and so haunting.  I'm writing this review two years after having read THE PACT, and it still haunts me.  It was, yes, disturbing, and at the same time, an insight into the emotional decision making of adolescence.

I highly reccommend this book, along with Dreamcatcher and the compiled stories in Different Seasons.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Many of these reviews will fill you in on the story, but you must understand that:<br />1) This is a film for you think about, not entirely enjoy. NOT A TRUE MINDLESS SUMMER POPCORN FILM! This is a film for you to think about, not sit back and relax with like Rush Hour or Aliens.<br />2)THEY ARE NOT ALIENS, THEY ARE MACHINES FAR ADVANCED, FAR EVOLVED AFTER THE ICE CAPS MELT, REMEMBER THIS! This refers to the end, I even thought aliens at first, feeling the film was completely ruined, but then I realized and all was well. Listen closely to Jude Law, he foretell this.<br />3)IF YOU CANNOT TELL IF YOU LIKED THIS FILM, THEN THE FILMS HAS DONE ITS JOB. AFter watching the film three times in theatres, I couldn't decide what to think about it, that is why I must buy it.<br />4)FORGET EVERYTHING YOU KNOW ABOUT SPIELBERG BEFORE WATHCING THIS FILM. It's simply unique, a mixture of vision.<br />AND FINALLY<br />5)THEY ARE NOT ALIENS!!!!!

0767903862|3.0|Throughout the book I kept saying to myself, `Bill you're a bloody brat'. Focusing on nasty animals that can kill, going to places that I wouldn't send my worst relatives to, and a lack of preparation, continually frustrated me throughout this book.<br />But then I realised that this was deliberate. Bill was not looking to create a travel brochure on Australia; he was creating a tale about Australia - warts and all.<br />He discovers that how vast the country is in size and also gets an insight into its relationship with aborigines. My favourite part was his description of listening to the cricket on the radio, while driving to Adelaide.<br />This book will be lost on all but those with some experience of Australia - either having visited the country or knowing an Australia. Don't buy this in place of a Lonely Planet or Let's Go guide.

0790731002|3.0|The Schumacher Batman movies have been much maligned, especially since \\"Batman and Robin,\\" but \\"Batman Forever\\" isn't that bad. It isn't a Burton film, but it doesn't try to be. Schumacher's new take is that Batman is \\"whole.\\" His is not the brooding obsessive as freakish as the monsters he fights whom Michael Keaton plays. Schumacher is not a good enough director to fully realize his vision, which is why the resolution is so hollow and anti-climactic, so he expands the supporting cast, brightens the art direction and focuses on techno-wizardry over mood.<br />It isn't as layered as Burton's efforts, but it's slicker. From Jim Carrey's over-the-top performance to the sexy grooving soundtrack, it feels like an average summer thrill ride, but it is thrilling. What little substance there is comes from the actors, who have little to work with. Nicole Kidman (again) delivers a performance better than the movie deserves and makes Chase Meridian the most complex character in the film. Tommy Lee Jones (and Two-Face, a fascinating member of Batman's rogues gallery) is wasted, but he finds a moment at the end of the film.<br />Compared to the Burton films, these moments are rare, but \\"Batman Forever\\" looks nice. With its cartoonish characters, colorful sets and lack of brutal violence, it will also appeal to young kids more than the first two. The DVD version, no frills though it is, is therefore a better deal -- the format preserves the bright colors of the visuals and stomach-stirring subtleties of the sound.<br />The DVD chapter review also offers the chance to edit the movie, thus creating any of a number of much better films: a quirky soap opera (Kidman scenes), a screwball comedy (Carrey scenes) or even, yes, homosexual erotica (\\"You'll need a friend.\\" \\"Not just a friend, a PARTNER.\\")<br />It may not be the Batman movie Burton fans had hoped for, but as junk food for your brain, it's a fun way to put your brain on hold for a couple of hours.
B000006045|5.0|&quot;Mezzanine&quot; is one of the most ambitious albums of the 90s, 4 years later and it still feels like a scary but fun journey.  This album not only made me a fan of Massive Attack but also got me into the Trip-Hop genre.  And let's face it, nothing beats the groundbreaking U.K. version of this genre.<br />While &quot;Protection&quot; was quite good, it seems like such light fare when compared to rough, harsh, yet still ambient-sounding &quot;Mezzanine&quot;.  You get that feeling just on the first two tracks alone, &quot;Angel&quot; and &quot;Rising Son&quot;, they set the tone for most of the album.  The heavy drums and electic guitars in &quot;Inertia Creeps&quot; is a personal favorite of mine.<br />Aside from the heavy synthesizers, metal guitars, the rapping, the electronica, and every other sound effect possible it does have it's soft moments.  &quot;Teardrop&quot; (which not suprising is also available on the Pure Moods II CD) is a meditative vocal ballad.  It helps that some of the vocals are done by women, many Trip-Hop acts usually implement this (Portishead, Lamb, Tricky when he collaborates).  Great song but it seems a bit out of place on here and belongs on &quot;Protection&quot;.  The final track &quot;Exchange&quot; also ends on a rather light-bassed, somewhat repetitive note.<br />You don't have to enjoy the album for their lyrics (although they are good on a bizarre level).  The music alone deserves to take precedence.  It's the kind of funky album where every track is just begging for remixes and should be roaring on your boom box.  Keep it coming, Massive Attack.
B00005MP58|3.0|Anyone who loves Jane Austen will absolutely love this performance so there is little need to comment further on that.  However the transfer in the 2-disc DVD set is, as others have commented, poor.  The colors are often washed out, the contrast needs adjustment, and most annoyingly, movement in the picture is often jittery and jumpy as if frames from the source material had been dropped in the transfer process.  A performance of such quality deserves a better transfer.

B000002INR|5.0|Lets be honest, if you don't already own this CD you probably aren't a Skid Row fan and you are probably only interested because you want to add \\"18 and Life\\" and \\"I Remember You\\" to your collection (not that theres anything wrong with that).  However, what you probably don't know is that there is much more to this album than the songs that made it to radio.  Skid Row's self titled debut is a great collection of very catchy pop-metal tunes.  Skid sticks to a pretty short and simple verse, chorus, verse format and the melodies are so addicting that you'll find yourself singing along in no time.  This album does have the \\"typical\\" things that made the late 80's/early 90's hair metal so cheesy, but you have to understand that thats how debut albums by bands like Skid Row were produced.  Its the basic songwriting here that makes these songs great.  If you are able to look past the stereotypical hair-band stuff and just listen to the music, you will really be able to enjoy this album
0553282980|4.0|I think it is a very good book with lots of things which make you think. I also think, that lots of things in the book are not quite well written. But at least it is a book you can't just put away without thinking about it. Suicide is not a way of dying you can't easily forget. I enjoyed reading the novel. Throughout the whole novel you get to know the figures better. I could somehow identify myself with the characters and at the end it was as if I actually knew them. It is a novel with young people, so I could understand the things they did even if they are different to me. They had the same problems as we have and they sometimes think about the same things. It isn't actually a story I could read twice because I know now the plot. What I didn't like was the fact, that Mr. Keating stood there as if he was the greatest man on earth and completely good. Every person has good and bad sides!

I told my Mom that when I grow up I want to be Spider-man and save all the people. We're all counting the days until the movie comes out because we know it's going to be THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!
0553282980|4.0|I found it a good book. It is not very difficult to read. In fact it is rather quite easy to understand. It is na interesting book and  good entertainment. <BR>The story shows that we should do what we want and that we shouldn't listen to other people. People should hear what their hearts tell them and fight for that. Make your dream come true! But the book shows us, too that there are people who haven't the character to fight for their dreams...
B00005Y1Y3|5.0|I hated this...for taking so long to come out! The Doors LIVE IN AMERICA is by far their best live CD. Standouts include Touch Me, without the studio orchestration.The result is a straight rocker! The live,Been Down So Long is better than the version on the LA WOMAN album! Certainly one of Morrisons' best blues vocals. Roadhouse Blues is loud and sexually loaded during the middle part of the song. Morrison simply rants like a mad man on, Bellowing, one of the most hallarious live tracks on LIVE IN AMERICA. While Five to One and Love Me Two Times are a bit rough on the edges they still sting melodically. The fact that the music on this CD has survived all these years without ever being released is amazing becasue it is extremely good! Finally a very unusual The End, with alternate lyrics and an extended section that is sure to light anyones fire!!!!pun intended!
B00000DGUG|5.0|This is the best CD Alanis has ever recorded.<br />After an excellent &quot;debut,&quot; with Jagged Little Pill, Alanis makes this not to be missed follow-up . What's great about this CD is that Alanis doesn't try to recreate Jagged, rather she sets to move on and explore different, alternative styles of music, with strong, powerful lyrics.<br />Every song on this CD is a winner, with no filler material in sight. It successfully incorporates meaningful, personal lyrics, with strong, alternative beats. <br />These songs stand out, with such notables as Can't Not, I was Hoping, Joining You, Baba, &amp; Sympathetic Character, just to name a few. Alanis sets out to make different styles out music, without yielding to record company pressure or radio play to regurgitate the same, tired mess called pop. Instead Alanis creates new, honest music, wthout a hint of pop insight. <br />Yes, this CD was less successful than Jagged, but that's because people don't seem like new music. If Alanis has churned out the same style as Jagged, I'd have been disappointed. But she ascends as an artist with this CD, displaying  her obvious and powerful talent.<br />This album makes Alanis an artist; not a tool of the masses.<br />With 17 tracks on the album, you're sure to find the best song of all time. I can't praise this album enough.<br />Well done, Alanis...
B00005A1PR|5.0|If one needs further proof that the Grammy Awards reward artists who adhere to convention, we see India Arie shut out in favor of the video-friendly, incredibly overrated beauty Alicia Keys. I guess they can understand the simplistic &quot;teenager-in-love&quot; noodlings of our Ms. Keys more than the wry, ironic, world-wise songs India offers. Or is it the difference between Alicia's piano-based music (does that make it &quot;classy&quot; somehow? Besides, she's not THAT great a pianist) and India's guitar-based soul?<br />I defy anyone who loves soul music to listen to this CD and not fall in love with her smoky voice. I melted the first time I heard her. This is a stunning set from a powerful talent, and she will be with us for a very, very long time, I hope. BRAVA, INDIA.ARIE!!
B00005JKJA|5.0|Don't be fooled by people complaining they \\"didn't\\" get this movie. You don't have to get anything to enjoy the characters, the performances, the photography, and yes, the story contained in this movie. People who don't like this movie are whining because it doesn't fit the typical structure of a typical big-budget drama that patronizes the intelligence of the viewer. Well, too bad!! If you want to see a movie that makes you pay attention to details and forces you to actually think about what you just saw after it's over, this is the movie for you. If not, well, \\"Collateral Damage\\" is probably for you. I think the movie is actually pretty obvious if (1) you think about the last third of the movie as having already taken place before the first 2/3; and (2) think about the first 2/3 as the dream of the Diane Selwyn character. Once you do that, this movie is easy to think about, and you can enjoy the amazing performances, the settings, the characters, and the amazing work by David Lynch and his Director of Photography. Go see this movie!!!
B00005N53P|5.0|Although very few albums ever live up to the hype the British music press pays them, this one, in my opinion is an exception to the rule. The whole album is extremely uplifting, amazingly well crafted and full of some of the most catchy and infectious songs released from a Rock N Roll band in years. The whole album seems to tell many stories, some of which I'm sure most listeners can relate to. Stand out tracks are 'The Modern Age', 'Hard to Explain', and 'Last Nite' which still sounds good even though I've heard it hundreds of times on the radio in England. <br />I am not going to say that this is the greatest album ever, or incredibly original, but it is enormous fun, and well worth buying.

B00005LB9O|4.0|I gave this third album four stars compared to their other two. Though not as good as The Man Who, it beats out Good Feeling. Its a lot more mellow and accoustic than their other albums. I spent days in the sun just relaxing and listening to Fran's beautiful voice. &quot;Sing&quot; is the first song on the cd that immediately makes you fall in love with Travis. Other great singles, are &quot;Side&quot;, Flowers in the Window&quot;, and &quot;Pipe Dreams.&quot; Travis just seem to be getting better and better. If your looking for their best album, get The Man Who.
B00004RJ74|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  Low on story, pretty low on character development, medium on acting, high on entertainment, gore, language and nudity.  This is vampire movie, but not &quot;yet another vampire movie.&quot;  It is a vampire movie with style.  The beginning and the ending are the most entertaining in terms of action, and middle, while no action at all, is still cool to watch.  This movie made me a fan of George Clooney and Harvey Keitel.  Warning to all viewers:  this movie has a lot of language and is completely filled with gore, hence a vampire movie.  All the characters, George Clooney, Quentin Tarantino, Harvey Keitel, Juliette Lewis, and Cheech Marin play thier parts to satifaction.  Clooney and Tarantino are excellent as thieves, and Keitel is wonderful as a retired preacher.  This is recommended to all action and horror fans, but not fans of an incredible story.

B00000IO4J|1.0|I caught this on USA one night and I truly thought it was one of the worst movies viewed in a long time. It just really stunk. The plot was terrible and this is just another lousy teen movie that most likely bombed at the box office and these script writers and directors think people are going to the theater to watch a dumb movie like this. I do not know about anyone else but this movie put me a bad mood because of high stupitity and the actors were not funny nor appealing. I call this a dork flick!
B00005A1PR|5.0|I'm at home watching the Grammy Awards and being disappointed over and over that India is being beat out by Alicia Keys.  Alicia is okay and certainly has talent, but India's material is so much deeper and so much more award worthy.  &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot; gets so much more respect from me than Alicia's &quot;Songs In The Mirror&quot;.  At least two of the awards that Alicia won, should have gone to India.  &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot; is certainly worth listening too.  The positive music and positive message is so refreshing.
B00000DFSK|3.0|Do yourself a favor if you want to listen to the wonderful original music of this band.<BR>Go out and buy all of the U2 albums one by one starting from the newest to the oldest while skipping over POP. ...  <BR>Leave that album for when you are thirsting for some new material after collecting the entire dicography.<br />You will not find a band from the 80's through today that has WRITTEN <BR>and recorded more original era defining music than U2. <BR>In a day and age were over-produced POP music is everywhere and bands sell themselves by dressing scantily and boasting about their riches on MTV. <br />U2 just wants to play old fashioned Rock-N-Roll with songs that have meaning either politically or spiritually.<br />This (Hits) album is only 10% of the quality music that U2 has to offer any fan. <BR>  <BR>If you are a real fan of music than you will enjoy listening to songs written by the band playing the tunes.<BR>Each U2 album has its own sound and theme and without listening to the songs in that format, you turn these tunes into radio POP music.<BR>We dont need any more of that do we?
B00005RFQ5|4.0|Where did Prince lose his way in the 90's?  For true fans, it boils down to two things:<BR>1) He tried too hard to make hits - too many rap/hip-hop attempts (\\"My Name Is Prince\\"), too many sugary-sweet r&b ballads (\\"Diamonds and Pearls\\", \\"Most Beautiful Girl in the World\\")<BR>2) Even the good songs he made (and there was always at least one gem per album) didn't grab you by the throat, heart, or behind, because they were overproduced, lacking edge and soul.<br />Rainbow Children fixes both of these in a huge way.  The negative reviews that point out that the album is erratic, the \\"Bob George as God\\" voiceovers annoying, and the lyrics preachy and silly.  All of these things are true, however, they are far outbalanced by the man's return to the funk (finally!) The tracks are pretty raw by Prince standards -there are sounds on this album that I've only heard on live bootlegs.  Particularly strong are the four uptempo tracks:<BR>* The work - a great James Brown-esque workup<br />* 1+1+1=3 - imagine the Time performing \\"Erotic City\\" and you're getting close to this track<BR>* Family Name - to me, the standout of the album.  A strange intro, but underlined by a cool bass line.  Meshell NdegeOcello in the verse, Stevie Wonder in the chorus.<BR>* Everlasting Now - Funky, funky, funky.  This one will rock as a live track.<br />If you are the type of Prince fan whose vocabulary doesn't go past Purple Rain, Kiss, and Raspberry Beret, you'll probably not like this album.  Prince clearly doesn't care whether this album will be popular or not, as he lets the great jams (like Everlasting Now) flow for 8+ minutes, while other songs are more snippets for his own amusement (Wedding Feast) than anything else.  If you're the type of Prince fan that relishes every minute of \\"It's Gonna Be a Beautiful Night\\" or \\"Eye No\\", then you'll like this album.<P I don't think the rest of the album stands up to the quality of the four funky tracks (though Mellow and Muse 2 the Pharoah are pretty good), so it can't begin to rank with his classics.  However, I can't think of any album he's released since \\"Lovesexy\\" that has 4 songs that I listen to over and over, so it ain't all bad, either!.<br />May U live 2 see the dawn....
B00005OAIE|5.0|The national debut of newcomer John Mayer's \\"Room For Squares\\" is not normal for our times. No gratuitous sex, no slimy video, no compromised artistic integrity, no cheap lyrics or hackneyed guitar work. This is the arrival of a major new talent who synthesizes his experiences and very pure musical talent (play the funky music) into a delicious mix of fresh and varied vocal colorizations and guitar stylings. His music and message is not for the dim-witted or the desensitized MTV crowd. He is major-league heart and soul. His lyrics are full of vivid and universal visualizations. From \\"My Stupid Mouth\\", a humble confession about trying to impress a date:<BR>\\"...We bit our lips<BR>She looked out the window<BR>Rolling tiny balls of napkin paper<BR>I played a quick game of chess with the salt and pepper shaker...\\", to the tale of the road he is on in \\"Why Georgia\\":<BR>\\"...I rent a room and I fill the spaces with<BR>Wood in places to make it feel like home<BR>But all I feel's alone<BR>It might be a quarter life crisis<BR>Or just the stirring in my soul...\\", young John has graced us with musical snapshots of moments we all might have or have had, but aren't or weren't witty enough to turn into art. His sensuous and tender treatment of love-making (\\"Your Body is A Wonderland\\") is so honest and warm and, well, sexy, that this listener had a hard time staying \\"between the lines\\" on HER road as she was listening to it for the first time in her car. He is the real deal, and that slight drawl and his \\"south-of-the-Mason-Dixon-line\\" guitar work(you ain't heard nothing' yet), is enough to stir even the most calloused soul, assuming the listener has one (a soul). <BR>Is he like Dave Mathews? J.T.? No (no offense to those wonderful artists). He is new, fresh and different, and I hope to hear a lot more from him in years to come. To paraphrase the first track which is getting more and more airplay, \\"No Such Thing\\", I believe that the best of him IS hiding up his sleeve. I for one, can't wait to find out what else he's got up there.
B000001FXT|5.0|it doesn't take much to figure out what the album's all about...just look at the cover - all african flags. given the album's release date, it's not surprising to find a song on a country then named &quot;rhodesia&quot; (zimbabwe) which had just declared independence from british rule and its birthpains. one would wonder what marley would think 23 years on. another song on zimbabwe? not a far fetched thought...whose side will he be on this time? go figure!<br />this should not sway a true blue fan from enjoying this set. reggae has always been political anyway. you're a lucky soul if you can manage to lay your hands on the version that has the 12&quot; remix of &quot;ride natty ride&quot;.

I can't hardly imagine how this band would be even more famous had it a proper singer... THis CD is another example of it: great songs, amazing technical master, and Mustaine destroying it all with his vocals...
0671722905|5.0|'The Tempest' was the last of Shakespeare's plays and contains all of the finest elements of his comedies, tragedies and histories. Indeed, one wonders as to the autobiographical makeup of Prospero, 'The Tempest' coming across as a signatory piece.<br />The play deals with a shipwreck on an island inhabited by three people - the 'sorcerous' Prospero, his daughter Miranda and the 'beast' Caliban.<br />As such the play is probably the most thematic of all Shakespeare's plays, there being sub-themes of revenge (Prospero was banished from Milan), slavery (Ariel and Caliban), ridiculous material gain (Trinculo and and Stephano) whilst the main themes are those of innocence, baseness of character and intellectual impartment. Each of these comes into contact with 'civilisation' in the form of the princely shipwreckees with the inevitable innocent Miranda being seduced by Ferdinand and Prospero both separating and sending off the various parties around the island to manipulate the desired outcome. He gets it of course, but the primary focus is on his relationsip to his two 'slaves' Ariel the spirit and Caliban, the beast. The relationships are markedly different, the former being ethereal, intangible; the latter earthy and brutal.<br />This is certainly Shakespeare's finest play, if not the most poular, simply because it is a microcosm of everything that has gone before. It has romance, brutality, comedy, history, tragedy, pyschology, despair, laughter, the sublime, the ridiculous. None of the rest of the plays are as complete and, to echo George Eliot, you could say that 'The Tempest' was 'performed with [his] own best blood'.<br />Sure, Macbeth, King Lear or Hamlet - greatest tragedy, A Midsummer's Night Dream or Romeo and Juliet - greatest romance, Two Gentlemen of Verona or The Merchant of Venice - greatest comedy, Henry V or Richard III - greatest history ; I am sure there are many arguments for all of his plays to be classed as the greatest in the individual genres.<br />But, 'The Tempest' was his last play, the one that blends all of the above, and as such, when you really study it, it has to be his finest.'The Tempest' was his last play, the one that blends all of the above, and as such, when you really study it, it has to be his finest.

B000003FD9|5.0|Mr. Starker is a phenomenal cellist, perhaps the best. This recording, made when he was 70-ish, is proof.  His extreme sensitivity and understanding of the music is perfection in itself.  His technique, not as precise as when he was younger, is unmatchable.  He is a legend amoung all musicians.  This is a must have for every music library.  The music itself is perfect and the playing is just as wonderful.  There are no words that can describe how awesome this c.d. is.  Just get it.
B00005A46T|2.0|You have to be kidding me. Anyone who uses this term to describe Slipknot does not have even the most distant grasp of its meaning. If you're at all interested in actually learning anything about the genre (yes, its a genre, not a term to scare your parents with), you can find its origins in the album \\"Seven Churches\\" by Posessed and early Morbid Angel and Death (the band) albums as well. Slipknot are nu-metal, Slayer are thrash, and I really wish people would not throw terms around simply because they nothing about metal in general.<br />Anyway, on to the album itself. In starting, I used to like Slipknot. I bought their S/T album after seeing them live and thought they were the greatest thing since sliced bread. They served as sort of a stepping stone into my discovery of infinitely heavier, louder, and generally better bands, all of them underground (not famous, not played on the radio, etc).<br />After I got into the underground scene, going back and listening to a friend's copy of Slipknot's \\"Iowa\\" was almost saddening. They are weak on all levels of comparison to the infinite nameless acts of the underground from all corners of the globe. I won't bore you with my list of favourite underground bands, because I hope you can discover your own favourites and realize what you've been missing.<br />In short, I have mixed thoughts about the band. I hate the way that they've been breeding clueless, immature clods (such as my brother) who call them the \\"heaviest, most intense, etc\\" and can only pretend that they indulge in metal's finest. I hate their fake \\"agression\\" attitude, which is boasted by countless other nu-metal poser bands. But I do like the fact that, for me anyway, they were a link to place in music that will always be legions above anything on MTV and modern radio in all respects.
6304602979|4.0|I discovered this movie strolling though the video store in the summer of 1994.  Am I ever glad that I did. <br />I don't want to discuss the plot at all, just buy it. Hurry!<br />4 Stars due to lack of extras.  I almost gave it a 5 anyways since the movie is so good.  Instead I reserved the extra star in case they release a Super Deluxe Kitchen Sink Edition including a Sonny Chiba film collection.
0694004162|5.0|This gift set is adorable--it combines a wonderful story with a little friend that will soon become a lifelong companion. I bought this for my nephew when he was 18 months old--the mouse quickly became his close friend. And,even though he's far too old to admit it (almost 10!) he still has that mouse!
B000002LOE|5.0|If you are looking for a whole album filled with Losing My Religion clones you definitely won't find it here. That's what I like about this album, all the songs are great in their own way. I must be the only guy in the country that listened to REM and didn't even know they were popular. After listening to them about 6 or 7 years, I finally heard the news sometime about Y2K, I think. I just listened because I thought they sounded cool. I guess that maybe my opinions weren't tainted by popularity contests on rec.music.rem because I think Shiny Happy People sounds great, managing to sound upbeat without sounding sappy. This album really is baroque, with wild mood swings between the insanely happy, such as SHP to the moody and creepy sound of Country Feedback, which reminds me of a cross between Bruce Springteen's Nebraska and a Neil Young Buffalo Springfield track. As far as downer tracks, I also like Half a World Away. It has a driving beat that to me gives it an unusual sense of urgency. Most of the more upbeat and energetic tracks, such as SHP, Near Wild Heaven and Me In Honey are alternated with the slower, more somber tracks like Low, Endgame, and Country Feedback, which is a nice trick as it keeps you on your toes. I think it would have been a mistake to split the album into a \\"happy half\\" and a \\"sad half\\". The way they did it was perfect. Most of the upbeat tracks have a driving rythym which is a nice counter to the slow stuff. Me in Honey and Near Wild Heaven are particularly good in this regard. All in all, there isn't a single track of filler. I hate it when I listen to something that's been done on autopilot. I get the feeling when listening to Out of Time, that each song is carefully crafted and that they are really into their material. They weren't just grabbing songs off the end of the assembly line at the REM factory. To me the album is kind of like REM's version of the Beach Boy's Pet Sounds or the Beatles Rubber Soul. There are always those who say itcouldn't be done or, in this case, shouldn't be done. Yeah, they probably knew when they were cutting the album that there would be some scoffers, some nay-sayers, some bo-diddly's, some insecure kiddies giggling behind their hands about Shiny Happy People and Radio Song, but I'm not one of them. REM has quite a few great albums but none are as diverse as this one. At least that is my seat of the pants reaction, perhaps somebody can prove me wrong. Maybe the number of instruments they use has something to do with it as well. There are some unusual ones such as harpsichord, violin, mandolin, etc. I personally like the sound of the more traditional instruments. They probably lend something that account for the baroque sound, that and the juxtaposition of the borderline silliness of SHP with songs such as the somber Country Feedback. For somebody that is not familiar with REM, and wants to find out what they are capable of as musicians, I think this is a great place to start. I have listened to this one probably more than my other REM albums put together. Deep down I feel like anyone who is unable to appreciate it is somehow being deprived. It is definitely in my top 5 of the 90's. It is a hidden treasure. Awesome.
B00005UQ9F|5.0|The movie Session 9 is in my opinion one of the creepiest films ever. Especially since I worked at the abandoned institute during the filming of the movie. The movie sums up the feeling of the place so perfectly. I could ramble on forever so I'll stop know with this: GO AND SEE THIS MOVIE!
B000002KHY|5.0|But sound quality a miss. You would think that after selling over 12 million copies that they could afford to remaster this monster seller. Frankly I don't want to buy all the early albums remastered but owning this remastered and greatest hits vol 2 and his James Tayler live  would be all I would ever need.
B00003CXXP|1.0|This is not a Kubrick film. A Clockwork Orange and 2001 are Kubrick films.  Casting a dark, brooding and a baleful eye upon humanity, Kubrick was a master moralist, depicting humanities excesses and the horrible extremes to which they could lead. While this movie has Kubrick undertones, it is after all billed as a combination of both Spielberg and Kubrick, the film quickly descends into a sugary, ET-ish drive to go home. Please do not desecrate Kubrick's reputation by listing this as his movie or claiming that this movie went over the audiences heads. Spielberg went straight for the heartstrings with this gooey, botch job of a good Kubrick idea.
B00000G3PA|3.0|And it is many things.  It's a guy movie, with lots of cool explosions and electronic gadgets.  It's a science fiction movie (emphasis on the word FICTION) with errors so enormous, I'm sure actual scientists found it pants-wettingly funny.  It's a terrific showcase for American stereotypes not just of themselves, but of the world around them.  Note how the entire world is hanging on the president of the United States' every word.  Excuse me, but would the French be listening to Jacques Chirac, their President?  Wouldn't the Iraqis be listening to Saddam Hussein?  Wouldn't the Indians be listening to PM Vajpayee?  <br />Another stike against this movie is that it was done before in almost exactly the same way the year before...in the movie \\"Deep Impact,\\" which was considerably better because it focused less on the comet hurtling towards Earth and more on the main characters' ways of coping with what seemed like certain death.  <br />Of course, despite some tense moments, the guys come through, just like the crew in Deep Impact, though their heroism is somewhat more poignant because they don't actually get to go home.  Armageddon's cast isn't nearly as good, either, mostly due to Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler, who is cast more as scenery than as a serious character.  I still don't understand why people think she's beautiful...she's cross-eyed and looks too much like her father, which brings me to my next complaint about the film...that damned Aerosmith song.  Normal people stopped listening to Aerosmith years ago, and their descent into the white trash niche is pretty much complete in this film.  <br />In closing...good special effects, stupid plot, some good performances by the supporting characters, Willis Affleck & Tyler were all terrible, no research done on theoretical physics or space travel, and a destruction of New York that is probably too real still for some people to watch.
B00003CXXP|1.0|This movie was ver steroetypical.  Though the graphics were quite amazing, the story was just horrible, and quite depresseing at times.  The caracters wree very unlikable, and the constant annoyance of the kid almost made me want to get up and leave.  This move was very poorly written, and just dragged on for the 3 hours or so.  Speilberg tried to make this an epic movie, but he failed.  I don't even reccomend renting it.
B00005JKED|4.0|I saw this film twice and thought that was a good film. Denzel delivers a powerful performance and he takes charge of the gloomy film as it violently wages thru the 122 minutes...
B000002BYD|5.0|Now that binaural has been out for awhile and album 7 is in the works I can honestly say this is my favorite Pearl Jam cd. From beginging to end this is why I love PJ and despite how every one says ten is there best work; I think this a far richer more powerful album.<br />P.S. and no I'm not just a bandwaggoner PJ has been my favorite band since 10 (I remember the hell it was waiting for Vs. to have a real release date)
B000000W6F|5.0|Well, I wanted to give 4.5, but what the heck. I'll just give it five because I'm a fan of the Pumpkins :)<br />Anyway, these songs are from the days of the Pumpkins on LSD and crack. Songs like 'I Am One' and 'Bury Me' feature great bass lines; 'Siva' has great guitar riffs and solos; and 'Tristessa' just rocks. For the slower songs like 'Rhinoceros', 'Crush' and 'Suffer' have a very dreamy sound, and are distinctly unique. Their cover of Blondie's 'Daydream' features D'arcy on vocals and even though it wasn't recorded using the best instruments, it's still interesting.<br />Although this album is not their best I definitely like it and would recommend anyone who likes rock from the 90s.
6302256704|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen! The dialogue between the characters is hysterical. My husband and constantly quote from it, the lines are so great.

B000001Y16|5.0|As everyone knows, Tupac owned the rap game when he was still here.  Tupac switched his name to Makaveli, and his first album is The Don Killuminati:The 7 Day Theory.

B000002NHN|5.0|Loreena McKennitt has been a favourite for years and she will still continue to be so in my books! From &quot;The Visit&quot; to &quot;The Mask and The Mirror&quot; Loreena creates an ever imaginative flow to her melody. Sadly though, I had hoped that &quot;Mummer's Dance&quot; would actually be about the Mummering that goes on at Christmas. For non-Newfs, its like Halloween at Christmas, but way funner!! Anyhow, this is a remarkable CD, and I highly recommend buying it!
B000000WA4|5.0|This album does not contain all rock. But Billy Corgan did once say, &quot;Great music completely obliterates any conception of genres.&quot;<br />Alright, I'm a big fan of the Pumpkins, but this album was a transition from the dry wailing guitar riffs to something a bit more classy. It's sound is distinctly different from their two first albums Gish and Siamese Dream, but good music is what this album is all about. You have the soft melodies (Cupid de Locke, By Starlight, Lily, Farewell and Goodnight) that are actually good, and the rocking melodies (an ode to no one, all the singles, etc.), which are, of course, good. A blend of soft rock and hard rock makes this album generally acceptable to almost anyone.
0671891634|3.0|Having worked on Wall Street I think this book is great and poor at the same time.<br />Great because<br />1) It is ideal to read for the casual to serious investor.<br />2) Some of Lynch's prominent themes like \\"Buy what you know\\" and investigating the companies that you buy are great strategies, especially for non-professionals.<br />3) He walks you through his thought process on numerous stocks in several industries, highlighting mistakes as well as successes. I found his various rules of thumb with respect to each industry (retail, restaurants, cyclicals) helpful<br />I say it is poor because Lynch himself used to buy and sell stocks frequently.  So while he says \\"buy and hold\\" he did that, but he also traded the heck out of stocks he knew inside and out.  When they got expensive, he would trim his position and when something got really cheap he would buy the heck out of it.  This enabled him to compound his returns by a phenomenal amount<br />Lynch primarily invested in retail stocks.  This was great as brand names and the \\"homogenization\\" of retail concepts via chain stores was sweeping the nation with the baby boom wave.  However, most of that \\"easy money\\" was made along time ago.  Current baby boom themes of biotech, health care, along with some financial service industry stuff is tougher to make money at and it doesn't grow as fast as retail.  Well, biotech can but it is far riskier.<br />Lynch never talks about debt.  The U.S. economy expanded in the 80's due to 1) heavy government spending, which created a huge national debt (2) consumer spending a ton of money and going into debt and (3) the entrepreneurial spirit.  The government actually funded a lot of the developments we see today.  The problem with this is that they have mortgaged the future to pay for past wealth creation.  He never once mentions the impact of debt.  It is great while you are charging the credit card up and enjoying the ride but eventually you have to pay the bills!<br />Lynch spends a lot of time telling the reader how he went about picking stocks for his Magellan Fund, but he has the ability to talk to CEO's and visit companies on site headquarters, something the average investor certainly does not have.  I would say though that Reg FD has made the playing field more even, as now nobody gets a lot of information!<br />My thoughts on stock picking, having worked in the financial service industry for 3 years in research (got out because my values didn't correlate with the business) is that no one should expect to beat the pros unless they are 1) very observant and 2) willing to commit time to finding new investment concepts/vehicles.ds a lot of time telling the reader how he went about picking stocks for his Magellan Fund, but he has the ability to talk to CEO's and visit companies on site headquarters, something the average investor certainly does not have.

0345413377|2.0|\\"The Amber Spyglass\\" is a bad book.<br />It's not just because it's a mediocre and entirely unsatisfying conclusion to a hither fore excellent fantasy series.  It's not because it's \\"anti-Christian\\" or any such rubbish as that.  It's just a bad book.<br />Where Pullman had earlier peopled his novels with complex and realistic characters, these same characters devolve into robotic stereotypes.  Mrs. Coulter, for example, turns into a mommy.  But Pullman's worst character assassination brings down Lyra Silvertongue, the formerly spunky, independent, and assertive little girl who enchanted us in \\"The Golden Compass.\\"  In \\"The Amber Spyglass,\\" she becomes an analytical worrywart, and gets dragged around by the hand from scene to scene by Will Parry, like some B-movie Hollywood actress.  <br />Pullman continues to introduce new characters and creatures in the third book, none of whom are interesting or compelling.  There are the Lilliputian spies, proud and haughty just like their Swiftian counterparts, but not at all humorous.  And the \\"mulefa,\\" who vie with Lucas' \\"ewoks\\" for the most insipidly sweet and cute fictional species in contemporary fantasy.<br />And as if to make up for the lack of craft, Pullman strings us along with a continual barrage of cheap cliff-hangers, as if he didn't trust us to keep reading without prodding.  And I definitely mean cheap.  It was obvious that `Paradise Lost' wasn't the only body of fiction that influenced Pullman; he also stole gimmicks from schlock-masters such as King, Grisham, and Roy Rogers. <br />The book's ending, which I will not reveal, was overtly manipulated into place.  Pullman spent a good deal of the third book inventing random rules for his universe to keep the ending intact.  Rules, I might add, which seemed unnecessary and illogical.  (Spend too much time in another universe and you get sick?  Make too many cuts with the subtle knife and specters jump out?)<br />Bottom line:  this book stinks.  Especially in comparison to \\"The Golden Compass,\\" which may be one of the best fantasy novels of all time.  But I had to ask myself as I finished \\"The Amber Spyglass\\":  is this REALLY what Pullman strove to accomplish from the very beginning?  I prefer to think otherwise, I prefer to think that Pullman had to rush this last book because of popular acclaim for the beginning of the series, and that, if given time, he really could have written a masterpiece.  That way, I can always hope he'll someday publish the \\"real\\" \\"Amber Spyglass.\\"
0792842499|5.0|This film is on par with For A Few Dollars more, This is not suprising as irt features the actors who starred in it. This film also has dramatic scenes and sequences, such as the rope being shot when Eli Wallach's character is about to be hanged. A excellent western film.
B00005QW5X|5.0|This is a DVD to own, not to rent.<br />I was more than a little irked when professional reviewers and friends alike repeatedly told me last summer than Hedwig was &quot;better than Moulin Rouge.&quot;  I enjoyed Moulin Rouge very much, thank you, and I was not interested in some artsy take on a similar theme.  Alas, despite my best efforts, Hedwig won me over.  If only I could get the appropriate hat-thingie, I would be a yet-another Hed-head.<br />Hedwig is good for all the reasons Moulin Rouge was good: it is a fun, campy, musical pleasurefest for the eyes and ears.  But Moulin Rouge was a story created around songs, while Hedwig's songs come from her story-- and we really believe her heart.<br />I thought I understood Hedwig when I saw it in the theater the first time.  When I went back, I caught many thoughts that I missed.  Now-- after an embarassingly large number of views on DVD-- I look back in wonder at how I missed so much.   Hedwig is bitter-- and has more reason to be than any of the bitter people I have ever come across (or have come across me).  Life has dealt her some severe blows, but her wit and her music keep her afloat... barely.  It takes Hedwig many years to realizes that despite all the changes she has been through, it is still her blind, unquestioned belief that she lacks what it takes to be whole-- a myth many believe in-- that drags her down.<br />Hedwig is a story of transformation.  Once a viewer gets over the male-female dichonomy she personifies, we see that the change she made physically from man to not-a-woman-or-a-man does not cut as deeply as the emotional changes from being betrayed by her father, mother, and lovers.<br />John Cameron Mitchell is completely believable as Hedwig.  Oddly, Miriam Shor's performance as Yitzak is so well executed it gives me the creeps.  But it is Michael Pitt's Tommy Gnosis that looks most at home on the screen.  I expect that Hedwig and &quot;Bully&quot; will be early mentions in a long career for this guy.<br />This film is richer with multiple viewings, so let me put on some advertising spin: Hedwig is the movie that keeps on giving.  It fills you up and never lets you down.  It is the taste of a New Generation.<br />Watch it.  Even my 64-year-old mother liked it-- and learned from it, too!

B00004ZD69|2.0|So I bought &quot;Lift Yr Skinny...&quot; on a whim based on a thread of comparisons to everyone from Sigur Ros and Mogwai to Pink Floyd and Yes.  I was very eager to experiment and prepared to be moved.<br />It is, on the first few listens I've given so far (it's tough to stay awake through a whole session), a disappointment.<BR>The album reeks of pretentious inscrutability--everything from the packaging to the music itself.  The presentation leaves you wondering if Godspeed...! are mockingly enigmatic, maniacally twisted, or just trying hard to be different. <br />One reviewer here drew a parallel to the symphonic rock of vintage Floyd (think Atom Heart/Ummagumma), but at least that music provides some (brilliant) melodic release after slogging through its psychedelic challenges.  &quot;Lift Yr Skinny...&quot; never seems to deliver. The teasing crescendos build tantalizing promises of musical transport that never materialize. <br />Godspeed...! has been often lumped (at least by website &quot;similar artist&quot; machinery) with Sigur Ros.  Except for moodiness and artsy popularity, there are no other similarities.  Sigur Ros unequivocally dropped my jaw and brought tears to my eyes on the first listen.  Some songs take some growing, but over all the brilliance is just blatant.  &quot;Lift Yr Skinny...&quot; is a lot more like work.  Admittedly, I'm still punching the clock on this one, so I hold out the hope that effort pays off.
0060506989|5.0|We Were Soldiers Once... and Young: IA Drang--the Battle That Changed the War in Vietnam is an extraordinary account of one of first major engagements in the Ia Drang Valley in the infancy of the Vietnam War. This book written by General Harold G. Moore and Joseph L. Galloway is just an incredible book that tells the story of 450 men of the 1st Battalion, 7th cavalry, under the command of Lt. Col. Hal Moore. They were dropped into a small clearing in the la Drang Valley where they were immediately surrounded by 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers where one of the fiercest and significant battles of the Vietnam War was fought.<br />I've had the pleasure of meeting General Moore and hearing him speak several times ... about this book and the battle and it instantly becomes apparent why he is a legend and how lucky his men were to have him as their commander. His affection for the men under his command is very apparent and NY Times said it best when they said 'the men who fought and died in Ia Drang could have no finer memorial than this one'.<br />If you're looking for a book that glorifies war, this is not that book.  I think the authors want to portray the realities of war and all of the death and destructions that it lays in its path.  General Moore also wants to highlight the American spirit and how the friendship and love soldiers in the field develop for each other and how it keeps them going and fighting.<br />This book has also been turned into a movie called We Were Soldiers staring Mel Gibson.
0380729407|5.0|I've been in love with books since I was old enough wander around by myself in libraries, eye-balling their spines and yielding to their siren song. So powerful was the spell some of these delicious tomes cast that I can still remember how I felt when I read them. I can picture where they rested on the book shelves. Even their covers have been burned into my mind's eye.<br />And that's saying a lot. Because I'm 41 years old. And some of these books were devoured some 30+ years ago.<br />And in all that time I have never found a book to equal Something Wicked This Way Comes.<br />I read this book yearly, sometimes twice a year. Always in October (my favorite month) and sometimes whenever I need an infusion of wide-eyed wonder.<br />I can't explain what this book does to me. All I can tell you is that each page crackles with electricity. And magic. And all the joys, smells, sounds and feelings of being a boy in a small midwestern town.<br />I doubt anything I say is going to convince you to read this book. After all, it's only my opinion. And you don't even know me.<br />Yet, I can honestly make this prediction. If you have an imagination, a yearning for the days of your youth, a love of night-time thrills and an appreciation for how a master craftsman plies his trade, this book stands a chance of holding a very special place in your heart.<br />Oh. And let's not forget the mournful sound of train whistles and calliopes. You'll find them a-plenty within the pages of Ray Bradbury's marvelous book.
0345413377|5.0|I've seen a lot of fantasy series compared to classic works, and read more than a few.  After a while, a blurb on a series comparing it to, say \\"Lord of the Rings\\" has become meaningless to me.  There are, I think, many good books in the fantasy and YA fantasy genre, but very few great ones.  \\"His Dark Materials\\" is one of the few fantasy series I have seen compared to the classics which truly deserves to be.  It is truly an outstanding work of fiction, and will be remembered far longer than many others which are getting more press and \\"hype\\".  <br />In terms of age level this series is definitely aimed at an older group than say, Harry Potter or the Chronicles of Narnia.  It is more truly a YA or perhaps even adult book, despite its being marketed as a children's one.  Themse include quantum physics, the existence of God, original sin, Heaven, the afterlife, and adolescence.  And they all tie neatly together.  <br />I recommend this entire series without reservation to anyone who truly wants to read a new classic in the fantasy genre.  And Pullman finishes the series in a superb manner with the closing volume, \\"The Amber Spyglass.\\"
B000001FZK|5.0|There's something downright scary about how moving this album is.....of all the albums I own, only one other has gotten the kind of constant play that Laughingstock has.  My Bloody Valentine's Loveless is that album.....but if I had to pick one album out of all I have ever heard that have had the most impact on me, I have to choose Laughing Stock (sorry, Mr. Shields...).<br />Listen to &quot;Taphead&quot;, with the speakers peaked and your mind open. There's no sound closer to the voices of sad gods than the sound displayed in the melancholy trumpet soli on that song....the first time I ever heard it, I started to cry, which was quite embarrassing since my parents were right in the next room.  It was just unstoppable, kinda like that moment when you realize you've just met the person you'll spend the rest of your life with...I was in awe.  It is literally transcendent, yet sparse, yet wholly aware of itself and not the least bit contrived.  It's absolute magic, the kind of music that you're only supposed to be able to make when no one else is listening.  Somehow, Hollis and Friese-Greene defied the odds one last time with this swan song.<br />This album taught me first that the hearts of musicians is what makes music grand, but it also taught me a great deal about rhythm, as I was just learning to play the drums at the time, back in 91. You'll find some crazy stuff on this record, stuff that will blow you away if you listen close enough.<br />Jason B.
6305165912|5.0|This for me, is one of those movies I can watch at any time.  No matter how many times I've seen it, or how recently I've seen it, I can watch it again should a friend come over and pick it out.  All the characters in this movie are memorable, Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Julianne Moore and the nihilists all play their parts so well.  For those that don't like Jeff Bridges, give him a chance in this movie, he's great.  It's the best hippie vs. ultra-right-winger vs. german nihilists (with attack ferrets) vs. local bowling team vs. psycho paid-off police chief story you'll ever see.
B00005JKQX|5.0|My sister had to drag me to watch this film.  And in the end it was what neither of us expected - plotwise.  Turns out I enjoyed the film more than she did.  We had no idea who John Nash was.  My sister was expecting a romance movie.  I was expecting a documentary of his life.  In some ways, it's both.  In other ways, it's neither.  There indeed is romance and love involved in this story between John and his wife Alicia.  And it also does document the earlier days of John's life spent in academia (Princeton) which led to his groundbreaking discovery of an economic theory.<br />In my opinion, Russell Crowe does a wonderful job of portraying the often quirky, always socially inept John Nash.  When I later discover he has schizophrenia, I thought to myself \\"so that's what schizophrenia looks like\\".  I immediately found sympathy for him, and realized that he really doesn't mean to be a bad person.  It really is a condition that can happen to anybody.  The special and interesting thing about John Nash is that he is able to rationalize this disorder and compartmentalize it in his mind so that he can continue living his life.  What a truly beautiful mind he has!<br />Jennifer Connelly plays Alicia in this movie.  She's introduced to us as a drop-dead gorgeous student of John that has a feisty side to her.  We get a feeling early on that she finds something unique and attractive about John, and tries to enculturate him into society.  She makes him fall in love with her.  And so they get married.  That's when John's paranoid episodes get more intense and he is institutionalized for a while.  Yet through it all, Alicia is always patient, supportive, understanding and faithful.  She knew they could overcome this.  And she was right.<br />This film to me is inspirational on many levels.  It's about an underdog who works hard to achieve the accomplishment of a lifetime.  It's about a man's battle with paranoid schizophrenia, and his subsequent triumph over it.  It's about the love of one woman for her husband through thick or thin.<br />You must watch this film to understand.  It wasn't what I expected... it was much much more.
0440219078|2.0|I'll give this book two stars for the fact that the writing wasn't really heinous and its just a warning about conformity. The book really isn't terrible, just cliched. The old horse of 'they had perfect lives, but they did not love' is trotted out once again, and the entire 'supposedly utopian but secretly evil' society that the author crafts is self-indulgent and unconvincing. In short, this is \\"Look everyone! I'm writing serious material!\\" work, a dumbed-down 'Anthem'. Yes, it's nicely allegorical, but there are other books that carry off the utopian theme much better, such as '1984', 'Brave New World' or the aforementioned 'Anthem'. It's truly painful to see teenagers learning this in school and taking it as the epitome of Utopian allegory.
B00003CX95|5.0|Good lord did i enjoy this great film. mel gibson gives a great performance as the brave William Wallace, the leader of the infamous scottish revolt against england in the 13th century. terrific battle scenes you gotta buy this movie just for the history alone.
0380788624|5.0|This book started out a bit confusing for me, it switches back and forth through time using very similar character names.  Aside from that, it was a great book, even after reading 'The Code Book' I have not seen a description of how the enigma machine operated in a more clear and understandable manner.  That's just a sidenote of course, there are numerous sub-plots in this book, each one compelling you to keep going through the next chapter, and the next, and the next.  The end seems sort of rushed together, the book moves along at a steady pace until the last 50 pages, but that doesn't take anything away from the experience.  I forced myself to go to bed at 7 p.m. just so I could stop reading before 4 a.m. each night!  Be warned, if you have any big projects either at work, or personally, ahead of you (I started to resent this book from the lost sleep), don't start this book until you are done with them.  <br />It's a great read, I think the other 400 reviews have said enough for it already :)  This is the book equivalent of CivII in the PC world.
B00005Y228|4.0|I wasn't exactly sure what I was expecting when I bought the Kylie Minogue CD, as I didn't know much about her and her music before except that I loved the hit single &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head.&quot;  Well, I have to say that for the most part I was pleased with the CD.  Two or three of the tracks were actually better than Out of My Head, &quot;Fever,&quot; &quot;Give it To Me,&quot; and &quot;Burning Up.&quot;  The only problem I have with the CD is that every single song either starts with a strong beat, or gains one less than 30 seconds in.  That is, there are no slow songs at all on the CD.  I guess that could be a good thing; however, and I can see this album making a great dance album.  If you're contemplating it and you like dance music, then by all means, get it.  If you don't like dance/club style music, definitely do not buy this CD because it just isn't for you.
B00005RHGK|1.0|This movie blows. I could go on and on about what I didn't like about this movie, but it is easier to explain what I did like-<BR>which is nothing.
B00005ATQF|4.0|Another great war movie, they even let us watch this in Marine bootcamp for Christmas.  Skipping past that, it really brings out the madness of war, getting radio commands from someone far away that make no sense to those on the ground and under fire.  How quickly civilians could turn into VC, the boredom between chaos, lots of aspects of war are covered here that you'll never find in the Bruckheimer-Simpson garbage.  Moving flick, no Platoon, or Apocalypse Now, but one of the great war films.
B00005UQD5|5.0|Let me just start by offering you a little something about Danvers MA for those of you elsewhere in the world, particularly those of you who were drawing the &quot;Blair Witch&quot; parallells. Danvers is a town of 24,000 people that was founded in the late 1700's. Before it was called Danvers it was known as &quot;Salem Village&quot;. That's right, as in Witchcraft Hysteria Salem. Now, the Salem that is world famous for the witch trials is still a neighboring city. Thanks to the name, Salem still cashes in on all of the hype and tourism because many of the &quot;witches&quot; were actually tried and hanged in Salem the city. But the majority of the hysteria and incidents actually took place right here in &quot;Salem Village&quot; where most of the executed people resided, including the famous &quot;Rebecca Nurse&quot; whose house still stands on my street. So this town was rich in spooky history long before the Hospital was erected in the 1800's. <BR>It was only fitting that a horror movie be filmed here in this town at some point, especially at DSH (or, as many people in town call it: &quot;Danvis-tate&quot;). Brad Anderson and Co. did a great job too, it was pretty much everything I could've hoped for. I have been up to hospital several times over the years and it is every bit as scary as the movie portrays it to be. We've heard voices and all of the rest while we've been up there trying to spend the night, etc...perhaps real voices, perhaps imagined. It's an amazing place really, every horror movie element is built right in. There are several great sites around the Web devoted to DSH so I won't get into the factual history. But if you ever try to visit you'll have more than ghosts to deal with, the state police have maintained a presence up there since long before the hospital actually closed for good in 1992. The local gov't wants people to stay away &quot;for their own safety&quot; because, for one, the main building is collapsing from within... the floors really are falling right on to one another so it is pretty dangerous...ghosts aside. But that's just fuel for the fire of intrigue.  It's tough to get by the police and security during the day...but at night...well, let's just say they don't tend to be out walking as much. But either way, if you are ever in the Boston Area this stop (or drive-by on Rt. 95 N) is a must. Some of the buffoons that govern this town are always trying to find a reason to tear the place down, likely for condos and all of that nonsense, so, if you find yourself obsessed with this movie, or place, be sure to get up there soon, i can't imagine it being there too much longer. Well I hope this is as much help as a full on movie review. I figure this is more of a select audience anyway. Heck, we've got 26 screens of movie theatres here in Danvers and i had to go into Boston just to see it...so it's obviously a select audience--even here in town! But, despite limited distribution, this WILL be a cult classic, if it isn't already. Cheers!!
B00003W8NM|5.0|I believe that 'Fight Club' is second only to the awe-inspiring Kubrick masterpiece '2001: A Space Odyssey'.  There are actually some surprising similarities between these two standout films - both are a visual and psychological journey that will leave the viewer amazed and disturbed.  Pay no attention to the maniacs who rave about this movie.  Pay no attention to the maniacs who attacked this movie.  Just pay attention to 'Fight Club', for it deserves your entire alert mind.<br />Read other reviews for a plot summary - I would rather bring up some rarely mentioned facts about this film.  This movie was based from a groundbreaking novel by Chuck Palahnuik, which deserves as much praise as it's theatrical counterpart.  'Fight Club' has an extremely enviable soundtrack, featuring a complete score by the Dust Brothers.  Their work, a blend of techno and atmospheric ambience, feeds perfectly to the chaos and brooding terror of 'Fight Club'.  I should also mention that Tom Waits also appears, as well as the best and siglemost inspirational band of all time - The Pixies.  Fans such as myself will be euphoric upon hearing Black, Santiago, Deal, and Lovering used perfectly (I won't ruin which song is featured in the film), as they should.<br />Movies often not seen because of bad word-of-mouth: 'Moulin Rogue', 'Requiem For A Dream', and now 'Fight Club'.<br />Ignore the gossip.  Watch 'Fight Club'.
B00004XQ83|5.0|First off, let's start with this: I've never been into Bluegrass, and couldn't tell you the difference between blue or green grass to boot.  <br />But for days after watching this movie, that Soggy Bottom Boys song was stuck in my head - even though I had no idea what most of the words were. Of course, I had two options, continue to annoy those around me with my mismatched tunes, or pick the album up.<br />The result: whatever the style of this stuff, it's great!  I was a bit intrepid at first, wondering if this would be one of those &quot;one hit wonder&quot; soundtracks, but I've gotta admit htat almost every song is great.  Like other have noted, the variety is noteworthy. &quot;Down by the river&quot; is sort of etherial, and one of my favorites (next to, of course, the keynote &quot;Man of sorrow&quot;.<br />A fun album, worth the risk!
B00000JPH4|5.0|Jim Henson was one of the greatest artists and filmmakers of the 20th century. It took awhile for his genius to be appreciated in the United States, but over a decade since his death people are finally beginning to recognize the mastery of his creative mind. For example, THE DARK CRYSTAL. The film had a fairly decent run when it was originally released in theatres in 1982. However, the film wasn't acknowledged or heralded for the creative and complex masterpiece that it is until recently.<br />THE DARK CRYSTAL was a humongous undertaking. It is a film that takes place in a fantasy world, filled with frightening and mystical creatures; yet does not star one human being. The entire cast of the film consisted of nothing but puppets: some rather large and cumbersome, some that human performers were fitted in, some that were small, some that were animatronic; but all puppets nonetheless. Nothing like it had ever been attempted before and through the work on THE DARK CRYSTAL, Henson pushed puppetry and animatronics to a whole new level.<br />THE DARK CRYSTAL is about a young male Gelfling (think of an elf, but much smaller) named Jen and the journey he undertakes to save his world from an eternal dominion by a group of dragon-like creatures called Skesis. Jen's entire race was wiped out in a holocaust by the Skesis in an attempt to prevent a 1000 year old prophecy from being fulfilled. Jen is the last of his race, or so he believes. Jen leaves the race of Mystics who have raised the child since his parents' murder and sets forth on a journey to the great Palace to heal the Dark Crystal by inserting The Shard that had been broken from the crystal a millenium ago. Along the way he meets a variety of fantastical creatures from a one-eyed wise woman, the a race of miniture-round-headed people called Podlings, to a female Gelfling named Kira.<br />The plot of the movie is excellent and is told in the manner of such classic works as THE LORD OF THE RINGS, STAR WARS, and THE ODYSSEY. The world that Henson created is one of magic and fantasy, yet the story contains a great deal of Truth within it. It is a tale of adventure, love, sacrifice, and redemption; which speaks to the divinity in us all.<br />The movie is acceptible for an entire family to watch and contains several morals. However, children younger than five may find some of the creatures frightening. Nevertheless, THE DARK CRYSTAL is a fairy tale and like all true fairy tales, it does not gloss over the fact that evil is an ugly and nasty business. This movie is one of the best by one of the greatest.SSEY. The world that Henson created is one of magic and fantasy, yet the story contains a great deal of Truth within it.

B00005A1PR|5.0|I have previously reviewed this excellent album of gems that is full of soul and not a single bit of pretense. Each song here reprsents a jewel on the crown - heartfelt, emotional and wrenching with soulfulness. It is the great misfortune that the Grammy overlooked such a talent who scored NOT a single win despite seven nominations, thanks mostly to the overrated Alicia Keys and U2.<br /><br />Songs like the excellent Video, Brown Skin and Strength Courage Wisdom are the exemplification of life and love.<br /><br />Just don't be discouraged India. You've got a gem here that not even awards could ascertain its worth. You have the artistry and gift and please continue to shower us with songs from your heart! Your hard work will be recognized and paid off eventually.
B000005IU2|5.0|This is one of those ultra-cool, cult classic, proto-punk recordings that you really shouldn't be caught without...if there is an album out there that you will be deemed \\"uncool\\" for not owning, \\"Fun House\\", much like \\"White Light/White Heat\\", will be it. Say what you will, little music out there can give out a vibe as intense and crushing as this, even in the genre of \\"punk.\\" When you listen to \\"Fun House\\", you just get the unshakable impression that something is not quite right-a negative feel in the air. People are pretty dead on the money when they say how insane Iggy sounds. I say enjoy this record for the undeniable heavy atmosphere it generates and the way it gets you in touch with your evil, psychopathic side.  As the strongly influenced and inspired fan Henry Rollins once said, \\"It is the densest batch of jams I have ever heard on one record\\".
B000002KHY|5.0|There has always something very soothing and pleasant about the soft rock god James Taylor. He's not a great guitar player, nor a great singer, yet his down home personality and poetic whimsy of his songs can bring you on a train to heaven after you've been through heck.<br />Greatest Hits Volume One gather together some of the greatest songs from James Taylor's creative peak. Within these 12 tracks are tales of love won, love lost, lost friends, wandering a Country Road, dreams of &quot;women and glasses of beer, and a glorious trip to Mexico. All centered around a simple accoustic guitar and a simple voice that just might be you or me. There's something very beautiful about that. (Oh yeah! If you think this man is &quot;sensitive&quot; you have yet to hear this classic live version of Steamroller)<br />So if you want to hear some relaxing (but never boring) folk-rock/singer-songwriter music then I suggest you look towards one of the best. One of the most personal, most melodic, most modest, simply one of the greatest songwriters around turn to James Taylor. And if you want to start with the best, start here!<br />P.S. Get Greatest Hits Volume 2 after that.<br />P.S.S. What are you waiting for. Get it NOW!
B00004XONN|5.0|Radiohead, more than any other musical act in the modern world, are challenging our perceptions about music. If you agree with me that what Radiohead is doing is worthy and relevant, than I suggest skipping over any reviews with the words &quot;pretentious&quot; in them or phrases such as &quot;emperor's new clothes&quot; which simply attempt to write off their music. I have given up trying to convince others of the merits of Radiohead's latest accomplishments, yet at least I know this sometimes spat-upon album will always receive a warm, loving hug from me. Why should it, you ask? First of all, this album promotes use of one of the greatest attributes a human can possess-an open mind. When you give &quot;Kid A&quot; a thourough listen, you are expected to treat it on its own merits and not compare it to earlier releases. When you listen to &quot;Kid A&quot;, it's easy to forget that &quot;OK Computer&quot; ever happened. Fine by me. That was the intention of this unique recording. Radiohead have basically said, &quot;Alright, we want you to pretend OK Computer never happened and we'll help by making &quot;Kid A&quot; easily stand apart from it.&quot; Some people understand that the goal was to open people's minds to a different type of music, heightened by the talent of this group. Experimental? Yes. Rewarding? Yes. &quot;Kid A&quot; has made me think about music in an entirely new way, by rewritting all the rules. No truly great music was ever made by submitting to the standards and trends of a specific time. In today's world, Radiohead sound like another world, that of an errie, distant future, certainly not like any other band. I also suggest disregarding any reviews that mention any music besides Radiohead. Anyone who compares this to another band is unwise, not necessarily because this is &quot;so much better&quot;, but because the goal and the way it is achieved on this record are extremely unique. I resent the comparison to all the techno-ish bands being named, sure there are hints of this genre, but Radiohead have fused this type of music with their version of rock to create something entirely new. Plus Radiohead, in my opinion, have more talent, emotion, and purpose than all those &quot;techno&quot; brand names put together. &quot;Kid A&quot; prides emotions over thoughts. I say Amen. I'm tired of thinking so much in this life and feeling so little. I don't try to unravel any corny concept out of &quot;Kid A&quot;, I just let the emotions take me to different places in my heart. Conceptually, I think the only thing you can say is that's it's a vision of a negative, high-tech future, such as &quot;1984&quot; or &quot;Brave New World&quot;. Leave it at that and let your mind do the rest. Sense the cold emotions, more than anything else, that such a world would cause for its people. Approach these new surroundings like an observant child if you have to, but open up to the experience. Unlike many other bands today, Radiohead are truly giving you a chance to use your mind and draw your own conclusions. I think it's really cool, respectable, and a fun challenge but those not willing to stimulate their mind in such a way are not ready. Oh well. I suggest testing your mind's limits sometime, nothing is more rewarding. It's okay. Go at your own pace. Anyway, when I bought this recording around the time it came out, it came with a secret booklet, which is where my title comes from. My friend didn't buy the album until much later. He didn't care as much as I did. His actions spoke louder than his words. His copy has no secret booklet. If you have it, hang on to it. It's a symbol that you were there, that you were ready for this album when it arrived. We are those ready for new experiences to challenge our mind and soul, and make us grow---we are true human beings. Radiohead are the only musicians picking up on that need and vibe right now, as buried in all of us as it is. Let them and us, continue.     &quot;Amnesiac&quot; is excellent as well, but my thoughts are a mere ditto of this post.
B000000OUE|5.0|Rob Zombie returns with this kickin album that includes More Human Than Human. Probably one of the more popular songs from the album. Astro 2000 is a great album all the way through, I mean how can you forget about burning an X in your head.
B00005B4GU|1.0|...Why oh Why did Radiohead have to put this out.  I thought they could do no wrong, and they [messed] up and so very badly.  While Kid A was IDM-lite, it had its charms and its masterpieces, like The National Anthem.  Amnesiac is horrid, its so half-assed, that any Warp alum could duplicate it with minimal effort.  \\"But its got layers dude, that you haven't explored,\\" the hell with that.  This album is twaddle, that goes nowhere and right when a song is about to get interesting it stops, so yes I would classify this as self-indulgent nonsense that deserves to be thrown away with the rest of the trash.
B00003CXE6|5.0|Every summer there's at least one blockbuster movie.  Usually it's a complete no-brainer, but 'Gladiator' proved otherwise.  The premise is basic as Maximus (Crowe) battles his way through the gladitorial arenas to win his freedom and avenge the deaths of his wife and son.  Ridley Scott is one of those directors that every so often really hits the big time with his movies such as 'Alien' and 'Thelma And Louise', and 'Gladiator' is one such movie.  It manages to drag up the old gladiator epic and breathe new life into it without resorting to camp.  Using state of the art computer graphics you'll believe that you're actually seeing ancient Rome and this is definitely a highly cinematic film that loses something on video.<br />The acting is fantastic as well.  This burst Russell Crowe into the big league, something that anyone who had previously watched 'The Insider' or 'LA Confidential' already knew to be inevitable.  As loner Maximus he is perfectly cast and manages to bring to his character what is perhaps left out in the script.  As the villainous emperor, Joaquin Phoenix is genuinely creepy and actually quite unconventional as well.  The emperor's sister Lucille is also played with vigour by Connie Nielson and Oliver Reed turns in a last performance as a gladiator owner.<br />Unfortunately 'Gladiator' does tend to modernise the premise, with a few politically correct characters thrown in as an afterthough.  Over anything else this is a blockbuster and as such can't be viewed as anything truly revelatory.  Yet viewed simply as a movie it is a stunning breakthrough: utterly breathtaking and compelling in equal measure.
B00005T30L|5.0|I saw Ghost World because I just can't resist seeing a movie about a know-it-all sarcastic teenager.  Usually, the teen turns out to be right about everything, and the grown-ups are just cretins with no concept of how the real world works.  American Beauty is a great example.  Thankfully, this movie doesn't trot down that path, Enid (played by an excellent Thora Birch) is cynical and distrustful of everything and everyone.  She plays horrible pranks on people and basically likes no one.  That changes when she meets Seymour (played by an always great Steve Buscemi).  She says he is &quot;everything I don't hate&quot; or something along those lines.  It's those kind of lines that give you an idea of the attitude this movie has.  It's quite an honest film that confronts many different issues, and does a better job than most movies that only take on one.  All the performances are excellent, and the direction is subtle, only after a few viewings do the images start to jump out at you.  It does have a few of those moments that make me want to vomit, such as the guy who finally gets his bus.  But I can't hate a whole film for one scene, and it's probably the best film of the year, and I can't say much more than that.
0060930187|5.0|I read this book at the recommendation of friends and a book. I was guaranteed a modern masterpiece and a feminist one to boot. I got all of that. Every woman has a bit of Esther in themselves. We must follow a straight and narrow path in our lives and if we don't we face being branded much as Esther was. We question marriage and we're crazy because marriage has existed for so long. Sylvia Plath has even captured the feelings that many women feel about losing their virignity, the pressure and the fear. The ending is one of hope. She steps into the light, but we all know that there was no happy ending for Sylvia Plath. She died because she never escaped her bell jar and left behind a profound work on the experience of that bell jar. Is Esther really crazy? I can't answer that, but I can say that Esther(and Plath) were feminists and they questioned our society's customs. Despite the tragedy, we're fortunate to have this work. Read it when you're questioning yourself or authority.
6305622914|5.0|I saw this movie back when it was showing in theaters and it is a nice movie to have on dvd.  Centered around a group of men that decide stripping in a women's club (inspired by a visit of Chippendale dancers) is a way to make money, we are treated to a hilarious look at a bunch of regular joes with less-than-perfect bodies and with no dancing ability trying to become the men that women clamour for.  What is really nice about this film, is we get to know these men and their problems---the things that have brought them to this point.  Robert Carlyle is particularly good as the ring leader of this bunch, the man who is determined to make this work in order to use the money for his son's benefit. Perfectly complimenting the film is the soundtrack, full of gems that make the soundtrack cd as must have as well.
B00005JCAA|5.0|I have seen this movie about 10 times now. I hope this DVD never wears out. It is surely one of the best movies I have ever seen. Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani are all excellent. I found it exciting, romantic and emotive. It is 3 hours long but that time seems to pass in the blink of an eye. If you haven't seen this film, you are missing out.
B000002UAR|5.0|of the Beatles' golden age. Trying to decide what the best Beatle record was is like trying to decide which Playmate of the month you want to sleep with. You want to pick all of them. I would probably consider this my favorite, Let It Be coming a close second. The drug influences hinted at on Rubber Soul become more pronounced here, as evidenced by the fantastic \\"Im Only Sleeping\\" and the bizarre, unsettling \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\". Both of them employ the backwards tape splicing that George Martin introduced to them, and Im such a sucker for the way things sound backwards. \\"She Said She Said\\" is another hard rocking, psychedelic gem as well. If you miss the old Beatles, don't fret, there's plenty here for you, most notably \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\", and the underapppreciated \\"I Want To Tell You\\" by George hints at late era Beatles beyond the Summer Of Love. You could call this a transition album, I guess, but between phase records like this are rarely this good.
0471413909|5.0|I have tried every diet known to man.  At least I thought so until I read about the PALEO DIET.  It just makes so much sense!  Haven't you ever noticed that when you see people in old pictures that there are so few &quot;fat&quot; people.  And the older the pictures, the less likely you are to see people who are overweight.  This books explains how our diets have changed through the centuries with inventions, discoveries, and &quot;improvements&quot; in our lifestyles.  I have tried before to &quot;get back to basics&quot; as far as my eating was concerned, but NEVER got it right.  This outlines everything very clearly.  I am actually enjoying coming up with new menus and recipes using Dr. Cordain's suggestions.  I can hardly wait until my next health checkup when my family doctor sees how much weight I have lost!  My muscle tone has improved and I have more energy too!
B0000009RT|5.0|Coming a year before the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper (and indeed, Paul McCartney was said to be very influenced by this album), FREAK OUT! was the turning point of 60s rock. The first rock double album, the first concept album, and a record so stuffed full of both wacky humor and social commentary that it still is extremely effective today. The first two sides of the album (tracks 1 - 11 here) are finely crafted pop songs involving not just the usual guitar/bass/drums but also pianos, xylophones, horns, kazoos and anything else the Mothers had lying around. The lyrics satirize everything from \\"thought control\\" to the shallowness of American youth. The last few tracks venture into uncharted territory, with the minimalist, atonal compositions 'Help I'm a Rock' and 'It Can't Happen Here' (the latter sounding like a barbershop quartet on crack). The climax of the album is the 12-minute collage 'Return of the Son of Monster Magnet', which is a glimpse of what a true, unfettered \\"Freak Out\\" must sound like. Maybe Zappa's vision of overturning our social standards was doomed to failure, but FREAK OUT! still succeeds in delighting and fascinating listeners one at a time. This is one of the essentials of 60s rock.
0385501560|5.0|Choke is a phenomenal book that is easy to read and very entertaining. I have recommended this book to several of my friends to read, and so far they have all liked it as well. If you have read Chuck books before, then this is a must read. This was the first book I read by him, and it is his best in my opinion. Check it out sometime if you get a chance. By the way, this is my favorite book and soon it will be made into a movie.
B00003CY0V|5.0|Regardless of the other reviews , I think this movie is one of the best , maybe not in the ethic value, but in the action itself. as an action movie , it sure is an ACTION movie! . <BR>Travolta has played his character perfectly as ever, Jackman also played a good part himself , the only thing that I don't like about such movies is the lack of realism when it comes to computers ! , like hackers hacking in 60 seconds into some sort of a complicated multi million dollar system ! this is totally unrealistic . <BR>You know, when we (and I mean all of us) watch a movie we are nearly 100% sure that the good guy will win . that's why I usually don't get worried or excited throughout the movie , but the fact is that sometimes I wanted the bad guy to win ! , and that's another thing I like about this movie !
B000002TQB|4.0|This is a must have for any Blur fan.  Even if you're not a fan but you're interested, this is a great album to hear first.<BR>The songs on this album range from mellow to punkish to even disco-like tunes--all in a way that is still noticeably Blur.  Musically, the style seems sophisticated for the most part, though, as mentioned before, they do seem to dip in to the more daring, fun jives.  Lyrically, Albarn is clever, witty, and overall entertaining.  It's a refreshing combination compared to the [stuff] you hear on the radio<BR>Blur is a very fun band to listen to, and I highly recommend this album to anyone.
B00005R8GU|5.0|Beginning in the late 50's, US bluesmen were invited to London to be paired up with European musicians for what became known as the London Sessions.  Among those artists were Big Bill Broonzy, John Lee Hooker, Howlin' Wolf, Chuck Berry and Muddy Waters. Muddy's first session featured Rory Gallagher, Carey Bell and Steve Winwood among others.  This particular CD picks up on the London Session theme and features some outstanding performances by Muddy Waters paired with Otis Spann, Mike Bloomfield, Paul Butterfield, Donald Duck Dunn, Sam Lay and the late great Buddy Miles.  The CD also features 4 previously unreleased tunes.  The remastered work is simply outstanding.  Certainly a disc that will get plenty of rotation time in your CD changer.
B000021YQV|5.0|System Of A Down's new cd Toxicity is definitly something that had originality but kept to it's roots. System's first cd was awsome with the great lyrics and great guitar riff's and same with Toxicity. System's new songs have flavor and style which keeps me hooked on them!
B00005O5CM|4.0|I loved the movie.  I thought Reese was wonderful.  There are other comic oddities that you catch after viewing the movie a couple of times.  It also has a pop-up video version that gives cool information about the movie, the stars and women in general.  Overall a really great movie--considering the target audience.
6305807086|4.0|I would probably like this movie better if I had seen it earlier like I wanted to and didn't feel like a straggler now. it's a tough nut with acclaimed movies, you are made aware of them but that awareness simultaneously dims the experience in some way. It's a nutty good time, not completely bonkers mind you, not completely abstract either - more lingeringly so. the characters are all self destructive maniacs, humans, in other words. the movie gets weird without ever getting too dark also, thankfully, although sexual relations does become a major point it sticks to the Austin Powers standards of display.<br />is creativity for creativity's sake profound? mind you this film is actually semi-coherent, and is also not a ride through the absurd like you might think, it is creative and structured, but it doesn't offer any message upfront. it's quirky and enjoyable, an adventure, with bittersweet connotations. certainly it keeps good pace with itself and the character of maxine, whatever she's supposed to mean, is delectable for all she might imply about how desperate we all are.
B00005NB8J|4.0|I was a late convert to the Stargate fan club.  Better late than never, I always say.  Kurt Russell is a great character, and seeing this movie explained all the references I needed to better understand the show.  Good movie!  I am still a fan.
B00004SCX6|3.0|HELLO PEOPLE! Pop has been around for just about as long as Rock N Roll has. I don't see why people are suddenly offended by Britney Spears and her image based rock. So many of the people who are attacking her are the same people who are into The Beatles and other bands who profited from their looks. <br />I understand that there is a writing talent difference between Britney Spears and The Beatles but she has the same ability to read what's going to be big in the future. I think this is a good album. I bought it hoping for some interesting music, music that would have a good beat and be mostly good for dancing. That's what I got. Understand what you are buying here. Britney Spears doesn't claim to be making music that's going to change the world or anything. She's just making music that she loves and has fun making. Why is that SELLING OUT!!! Why is it that as soon as someone starts making money they are sell outs? It makes no sense to me whatsoever!!!!  I hope you give this CD a chance. It's got some very good songs on it. My favorite being \\"What U See (Is What U Get)\\" Give Bubble Gum pop a chance... we all need some silly happiness in our lives!!!
B000021XS0|5.0|Dream Theater are a spectacular band.  There's no question.  Nobody can touch these guys.  I agree with my friend the_wickerman (Korey) that they are the greatest group of musicians ever to play together.  John Petrucci is the most dynamic and creative guitar player I've heard yet.  John Myung's bass solos are truly something to hear.  Mike Portnoy is an extraordinary drummer - he's so FAST!  Jordan Rudess, DT's third keyboardist, is their best keys player yet.  He has an incredible sense of melody and drama, and his innovative solos and piano riffs are fantastic.  And what can be said about James LaBrie?  He is the most versatile vocalist of all times, bar none.  No one can match his range or his skill.  (Sorry, Bill Murphy).<br />With all that said, METROPOLIS PART 2: SCENES FROM A MEMORY (to cite its full title) is the best musical experience ever, not just in prog-metal, but in all of rock in general.  There is not one flaw to be found, not one note out of place.  77 minutes never went by so quickly!  Like all great prog-rock, the experience is so rewarding you'll be sad that it's over.  But enough of me rambling...onto the album!<br />As you already know, SFAM is a full-blown concept album in which every track tells a part of the story.  The plot involves a regular guy named Nicholas who keeps having strange visions of a young woman named Victoria.  She died in the 1920s along with her lover Julian and everybody seems to think it was a murder-suicide.  But Nick thinks there's more to it than that and he decides to go under hypnosis and visit Victoria in his mind so he can find out what really happened...<br />What's astonishing is that the band knows what certain type of mood the music should be, whether it be dark, sad, uplifting, heavy, and more.  Much more.  The two standout tracks that define SFAM, for me anyway, are \\"Beyond This Life\\" (track 6) and \\"Home\\" (track 8).  \\"Beyond This Life\\" is 11 minutes of extremely heavy riffs, skull-crushing rhythms, gorgeous melodic choruses, and downright jazzy keyboards.  This song is just flawless.  I love Portnoy's double-bass drumming during the beginning; my jaw was literally on the floor!!  It gets even better on the nearly 13-minute \\"Home.\\"  This track is epic in every sense of the word.  Jordan's Indian sitar sounds are cool (how did he do that on a keyboard?), Myung's bassline is infectious, and the musicianship is sheer lunacy.  James delivers his best vocal performance on this track - he nails those high notes!<br />The rest of the album is loaded with that much creativity.  \\"The Dance of Eternity\\" is DT's best and most complex instrumental (Jordan's ragtime piano solo rules!).  \\"The Spirit Carries On\\" is the ultimate feel-good song.  John's bluesy guitar solo is pitch-perfect and I dare you not to get goosebumps when the gospel choir comes in to sing along with James.  \\"Fatal Tragedy\\" reminds me a lot of Queen and the ferocious jam at the end is mind-boggling.  For me, these are the standout songs, but the entire album is great from beginning to end.  It plays like a complete album with zero filler.<br />To conclude, SFAM is the best album out there and everybody needs a copy in their record collection, not now but RIGHT NOW!.  I loved it!  Also recommended: IMAGES & WORDS and AWAKE.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Ok, I'm a geek who wears glasses, get good grades, super quiet person.  And used to hate screaming music.  Well guess what?  Slipknot changed all that for me, so if you're the heavy-duty-music type, this is a just good album for you.  But it's awesome for me ;)
B00005BCOL|5.0|An absolute classic...  This is THE film which has eventually led me to become a devoted fan of \\"old movies\\".  Before that, I thought \\"motion pictures\\" from the \\"Golden Age of Hollywood\\" were boring, outdated and over-sentimental.  Then in 1986 at the age 18, I happened to catch \\"The Women\\" on television and realized just how wrong I was.<br />  From the very first scene, this movie grabs you by the throat and never lets up.  We see many women going to a beauty parlor to get all dolled-up with fluid camera-work and bitchy repartee, kicking the movie off to one hell of a start.  I have noticed that so far, every single person who has reviewed this movie has granted it five stars...  Probably one of the very few films if not the only one who was warranted such praise from every critic.  And you know what?  It doesn't even surprise me.<br />  The movie was directed by George Cukor, a ... director who had an illustrious career spanning five decades.  As you probably know already, he almost directed \\"Gone with the wind\\" in 1939 but instead, was reassigned to this movie by the studio bosses because he and \\"Clark Gable\\" didn't get along.  George was an amazing director and excelled at getting the best performances out of actresses, working with many female stars from that era.  But without a doubt, even though he has directed many wonderful movies, this is his ultimate achievement.<br />  Brilliantly directed in full high camp mode, it contains top-notch acting performances by all the actresses, even in the smallest roles.  The cast here is so strong that it couldn't have been possible to make a bad movie of out this ensemble even if they had tried.  I have watched this movies so many times now that I know almost every single line by heart but still, I often get the urge to succomb to its magic all over again, even though I have discovered this movies more than fifteen years ago.<br />  But everyone must agree that \\"Rosalind Russell\\", who plays \\"Sylvia Fowler\\" and became a full-fledged star with this movie, steals the show with her amazingly hilarious performance.  The first time I watched the movie, I didn't even understand what she said half the time as she throws away one joke after another, talking faster than a speeding bullet.  I had never seen an actress having such impeccable timing and she is probably the only woman in the world ever to be able to talk so fast in such a natural manner while actually making sense.<br />  At that point in cinema history though, Norma Shearer was without a doubt the biggest star of the cast.  The movie revolves around her character \\"Mary Haines\\" as the cheated wife.  You probably don't need a synopsis of the story since it was told to great length in other reviews so I will spare you.  Anyway, I am a big fan of Norma and she gives a very good performance as the noble wife.  But towards the end, she grows her claws and get some wonderful bitchy lines, getting back at her so-called \\"friends\\".<br />  Of course, I also have to mention \\"Joan Crawford\\" who is probably the best remembered star of the cast.  Joan was often accused of not being much of an actress but here, she simply blew me away.  True, her part is absolutely delicious and along with Rosalind's part, the most scene-stealing character you could find.  But still, she could have botched it up had she not been in the hands of such a skilled women's director, as George has often been described.<br />  Her telephone scene at the perfume counter along with the one in her bathroom are among the best of the movie.  But the confrontation between the cheated wife (Shearer) and the husband-stealing temptress (Crawford) which is actually the only scene where they appear together is also extremely fun to watch.  Especially if the viewer knows the fact that Crawford hated Shearer in real life, feeling jealous of the fact that Norma was married to a studio head (Irving Thalberg), which somehow granted her a special status at MGM as queen of the lot.<br />  But the mark of a true classic is when no line or part is a throwaway.  You can feel that George gave just as much attention to the actresses with lesser parts, making sure that everyone would give their absolute best so the great story would get its proper due.  And in my opinion, along with everyone else here, he succeeded every step of the way.<br />  I can not recommend this movie enough.  It belongs in your collection, even if you don't usually like old movies.  Once you watch it, you'll understand exactly why everyone is fawning over this precious gem from a lost era.GM as queen of the lot.<br />     But the mark of a true classic is when no line or part is a throwaway.

B00005A46T|4.0|Comparing to their first album, I like their first album (Selft Title) better.  But still they have quite a few good songs on this.  When you have a [bad] day and stuff, spin this CD, sure it'll help *grins*
B00005B36H|5.0|One thing sI have to say: Tool really did it this time. I didn't think anything could top Aenima, but I was proved wrong upon popping this cd into my PS2 (ok, so my CD player doesn't work). The first few seconds of &quot;The Grudge&quot; slowly dragged me into the rest of the CD. I have to say, though, that I didn't like it at first. I thought it was too...slow. But that's what art is meant to be: to not be realized upon first glance. On that note, I've heard and read reviews that say Lateralus has not standout songs. And that's true. But's it's not supposed to, at least in my opinion. What I think Tool tried to do with Lateralus is transcend regular music and create art, like Pink Floyd did. On this album, it also seemed like Maynard tried to coalesce his voice into the music, making it sound like another instrument. I think he succeeded very well with this task, and Maynard has created a masterpiece of (let's say it again) art. Not usual music. So, if you're pondering upon buying this album, I implore you to listen to it many times before you finalize your state of mind about it.
B00004XQP4|4.0|THis is the best green day albulm, thyeve matured and slowed down, still have traces of the immature punk attitude, but hey, thats green day.<BR>  I'm sick and tired of hearing people calling them sellouts cause of this. First off, Green DAy got most people of my generation into punk in the first place, and they cant be sellouts cause Billie Joe puts his money back into the punk scene with adeline records, which supports small independant bands. <BR>And if theyre sellouts cause they slowed down than I guess they should be sorry for growing up, you cant play sloppy 3 chord punk forever.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|To say Requiem for a Dream is a masterpiece is a huge understatement. I just now got to see this movie, (which came out <BR>the same year as Traffic), and it left me breathless. The film has superb acting, (leading the way: Ellen Burstyn, Jared Leto, Marlon Wayan and Jennifer Connely). This film carries almost the same message as Traffic, but instead they give a more gritty and horrifying look into the world of drugs. The film will get the message \\"Don't Do Drugs\\" through to anyone.<br />The cast does a superb job (especially Ellen Burstyn, who did a more than Oscar Worthy performance) not only that, they horrify you with the vision of the addict and just how truly far they will go to get their \\"fix\\".<br />The fact that \\"Traffic\\" won the Oscar, does'nt mean that Requeim for a Dream isnt better, but rather the Academy dropped the ball, and missed, what was sure to be a clean sweep of every Oscar. That proves not only the Academy, but the every day person is biast with the diffrent film companies (Miramax, Artisan & New Line) because of the marketing. Paramount, Fox & Universal have a strong aggressive marketing team that is what really decides what we see.<br />I always did hear good things about this movie, but no one said it was as good as it was. If all the smaller companies would advertise the s.hit out of these movies that shine, and leave out movie advertising for movies like \\"Freddy Got Fingered\\", \\"Pearl Harbor\\" & \\"Days of Thunder\\".
1577311523|5.0|The philosphy taught in this book does not require that you have a belief in God or a Supreme Being.  However, it outlines a profound yet simple teaching that was given to us by some of the the great masters.  It is a theme that can be found in many of the spiritual teachings, yet if you are an atheist or an agnostic you can apply these principles in your life and realize a great reward.  The prose is simple and sometimes repetitive, but it doesn't take anything away from the powerful message.  The author points out that we spend most of our time in the past or in the future, completely ignorant of the moment in which we find ourselves.  Meanwhile, life literally passes us by, and we miss the beauty of the moment.  How many times have you driven home from work under a beautiful sunset, thinking about all the wrongs done to you that day, or what you wish you would have said when so-and-so said such-and such, and completely missed the beautiful sunset all around you?  Likewise, how many times have driven to work with a beautiful sunrise, thinking about what you were going to say and do during the morning staff meeting? We spend most of our time with our minds somewhere other than where we are, and to our great detriment.  The author presents a way in which to find ourselves in the moment and therefore really power up our lives with the appreciation and all the power that we have available to us, simply by being PRESENT!  I have been working with this while doing the most mundane of chores, or while listening to a friend talk, etc.  It works.  It really has a magnificent effect on the joy factor and trains the mind in a way that can significantly increase the ability to achieve objectives, whatever they may be, to be happier or to be more effective in your work.  I highly recommend this book to anyone, but especially to anyone who finds their mind constantly tripping back and forth from places other than where they are at the moment.
B00005YW4H|4.0|After hearing Norah's two tracks on the newest Charlie Hunter CD (Songs From The Analog Playground, the second best album on 2001), I was expecting great things from Norah Jones. <br />I can't exactly say I was disappointed, but, be aware that this album is NOT similar to those two songs (except, of course, for her heavenly voice). There is almost no bass in these songs, and it plays largely (to me) like a straightforward jazz album. Yes, Billie Holliday, yes Nina Simone. But not in a ill-conceived Erykah Badu way. <br />After a dozen listens to get used to the slower tempos, and noticing that I've left it in the cd players for three spins in a row now, I've decided to write in and tell everyone to buy this CD. It's the best album of the year!...
1878424505|5.0|Life is complicated!  That is because we have learned to assume that is normal and have not been given the tools to simplify our lives.  That is where this book comes in.  By making four simple agreements with yourself and following these agreements life can become simpler and much less complicated.  These four agreements are to be impeccable with your word, don't take anything personally, don't make assumptions, and always do your best.  Following these four agreements, Don Miguel Ruiz then teaches how Toltec laws can simplify our lives and how breaking old agreements that we were taught when we were young or have acquired over the years leads to personal freedom.
B000002J1S|4.0|The double-disc Lamb Lies Down on Broadway presents us with another rock opera, a genre very much de riguere in the '70s. In it, songwriter and vocalist Peter Gabriel, with excellent support from his bandmates, paints the story of Rael, a street-wise punk kid who, willingly or unwillingly, embarks on a surreal journey through an a New York City underground which may or may not be Purgatory. But don't take my word for it...<BR>Arguably the best album Genesis has ever recorded (if not their most debated and controversial), it's a musical delight, but the story can be somewhat incoherent and uncohesive. However, because of the strength of the tracks, particularly such gems as the title track, \\"Fly on a Windshield\\", \\"Back in NYC\\", \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\" and \\"The Colony of Slippermen\\", to name a few, bear it necessary to re-listen to this album upon occasion. It suffers at times from much of the ambiguity that plagues the Who's \\"Tommy\\" - you think you know what it's about, but in truth there are hundreds of explainations as to what indeed has occured, or is occuring. I say it's a musical delight because Tony Banks and Phil Collins shine throughout every track; Banks' keyboard stylings bring elements of Baroque, Minimalism and even Punk, elevating the tracks as more than just musical accompaniment, but rather, like a painter, bringing life and imagination to Rael's journey. His delicate, lovely cross-hand keyboard on \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\" suggests that while everything you hear may come across elegantly, there is an air of uncertainty and chaos throught. And Collins, before conquering the world as the future dean of Lite FM, demonstrates through his drumming what an innovator he once was, particularly in the imagined violence and defiance of \\"Back in NYC\\" - Collins keeps a steady, murky heartbeat rhythm that suggests a soul both tormented and fueled by the dangers of life on the gritty city streets.<BR>Gabriel, in his final performance as Genesis' lead vocalist, assumes the roles of all characters throughout the opera (Rael, his brother John, Lilywhite Lilith, the Supernatural Anaesthetist, the Slipperman, etc.), and with each character, Gabriel's voice conveys lust, playfulness, defiance, confusion, sorrow and hope. The story takes us from deep in the heart of NYC, Times Square, where Rael survives on the streets by vandalising city walls through grafitti. Rael is then suddenly engulfed by by a black suffocating cloud, which seems to be coming only for him, and is then transported to a foreign underground, where Rael must make his way with little to work with. He learns his brother John has also made his way here, in this imagined underworld, and Rael must help him. Along the way, Rael is both helped and hindered by characters both real and imagined - the Lamia, for example, are a trio of sisters who tempt and seduce him, and Rael is more than willing to comply, but his sexual romp may soon prove fatal (an interesting parallel to AIDS can be made here). In the end, Rael is presented with a final decision - save his brother, who may be beyond saving, or carry on with his life.<BR>There are interesting parallels Gabriel makes about modern life throughout the album, and peppers some tracks with cheeky references and name-dropping. On the climax of the track \\"Fly on a Windshield,\\" Gabriel makes reference after reference to a Who's Who of celebrities, famous and infamous (Groucho Marx, Lenny Bruce, Marshall McLuhan, Caryl Chessman, and the Ku Klux Klan, to name a few). \\"Riding the Scree\\" gently mocks stunt legend Evel Knievel. And in an odd twist of humor, Gabriel re-works the Rolling Stones' \\"It's Only Rock and Roll\\" to sound like \\"It's only knock and know-all, but I like it\\". But most interestingly, the concept of the album bears a strong reference to \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\" - whereas a man of faith embarks on a journey through temptation and ultimately salvation. I mentioned earlier the suggestion of Purgatory, and perhaps one can make the inference that this work is perhaps the story of spiritual loss, excess, resolution and salvation. For example, is the Lamb that lies down on Broadway the body of Jesus Christ, and has he arrived to warn Rael that his day of judgment upon him? Is this underground lair where Rael walks through Purgatory - is he here to bear witness to his sins and repent? And who is \\"it\\"?, the final track on the album? Is it salvation? God, perhaps?  <BR>Nonetheless, it's an album that demands your attention, even if you're unsure of what's its' message may be. Peter Gabriel bowed out of this band having bore fruit to a master work. The beauty of this record is that, like my explaination above, it is up to you to decide what the deep hidden meaning behind what you heard. Listen to it again and again and many things will be revealed to you throughout.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Nora Jones has a bedroom voice to go with her bedroom eyes. It is soft, breathy and right on pitch at all times. Her voice doesn't have much dynamic range, so it's best on intimate material. This album combines material written by her or a member of her back-up group together with several standards. The old Hank Williams' tune, \\"Cold, Cold Heart,\\" with a jazz-like accompanyment is worth the price of admission.<br />Caveat emptor: the whole CD is recorded at elevated levels, probably because of her limited dynamic range, so be prepared to turn your volume knob down from its usual setting.
0064409422|4.0|I recieved the entire Narnia series as a gift when I was eight.  Over the next five years, I must have read the series at least ten times.  I thought they were the greatest books ever written.  This winter, I found my old copy of The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe in the attic and decided to spend one evening rereading it.  It was a bit of a let down; this book doesn't have as much crossover appeal to adults a some other children's fantasy series, such as the Harry Potter books, but I still recommend it.<br />The story, of course, involves four children named Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy who wander through a magic wardrobe and into the land of Narnia, inhabited by talking animals and other magical creatures.  They end up taking part in the battle between the lion Aslan (representing Christ) and the evil queen.  A great deal of the book is spent describing landscapes and settings, as well as meals, clothing, etc...  I suppose that children might enjoy that sort of thing, but I found it growing tedious after awhile.  I was also a bit disappointed by the role of Susan.  She seems to be included only to call for help from her brother when she's in danger - not the sort of role model I would want for my daughter.  Other than that, the story is quite well written, and includes many appropriate lessons about repentance, forgiveness, and courage.
B00005OB0A|5.0|THis intire CD is infectious, if you like the firs single CGYOOMH you will like the rest of the CD, she sounds and looks awesome !!! The title track is another strong song on the CD along with my other personal favorites Come into my world and In your eyes. If you like to dance you really do want to get this CD !!!!!
B00005Y228|5.0|Kylie Minogue's eighth studio album 'Fever', is yet another magnificent album from this talented singer. It boasts her biggest hit to date 'Can't Get You Out Of My Head', definitely one of Kylie's best and most classic tracks ever - yet, it is not the only track on the album that displays such pop brilliance. Try the sensational 'Love At First Sight' or the disco-inspired 'More More More' - both guaranteed to put a smile on your face and your feet on the dancefloor. Elsewhere, there's the innovative title track, as well as the excellent second single 'In Your Eyes', already a chart-topper the world over. I recommend it very highly, not only as a Kylie fan, but a music fan. Heaven...
0446678430|5.0|I regard this as an excellent book.  In reading other reviews I guess people find what they are looking for.  The path to &quot;Rich&quot; is not a series of static steps, that's a ridiculous idea, so why would I expect that in this book?  Everyone's situation and opportunities are different.  This book provides a wealth of models and evaluation tools.  He shares experiences I have never heard before.  Do I care if he has a simple and plain manner?  I think it actually helps, unless you are looking for some overblown financial treatise that will give you an excuse to never take action because you don't understand the concepts.  No excuses here, probably the reason for the hostility of some of these reviews.  It's difficult to have to admit things to yourself.<br />In short, I recommend this book because it will open your mind, you models and tools that will set you on the path to creating your own financial life plan.
0553288105|5.0|Tonight the moon was the brightest it will be all year and as I looked up in the sky I couldn't help feeling cheated that I would never have a chance to try gliding across the surface of the moon.  More than watching moon walks in the 70's or space shuttle launches in the 80's and beyond, it was this book that made me long to set foot on the moon.  <br />Like most Asimov books, the &quot;science&quot; is just the setting for the fiction, not the other way around.  This story of drive, ambition, love, greed, revenge and heroics could just as easily be set in the present day or in ancient Greece.  Asimov is the master of telling a story so good that you almost forget the &quot;impossibility&quot; of the setting.<br />&quot;The Gods Themselves&quot; is really three books, each with its own tale.  It is only in the end that Asimov takes these three stories and winds them together like a rope.  To say more would ruin the pleasure.  This is a book I have read and reread in part and in whole for 15 years.  Strongly recommended!!
B00001ODHJ|5.0|There are few movies that just make me roll but this was one of them.  I didn't see until it came on the Dish one lazy saturday and I couldn't turn it off.  Bruce Campbell is my hero.  He has such a funny \\"I have taken enough...\\" attitude in this movie, it is perfect.  Everyone in the movie is a little nuts and the subtle humor just kills me - sorry about the pun!  Definitely on my list of all time fun movies.  It doesn't have large boats, roman gladiators, cannibals or wasn't a screen version of some fancy smancy book I never read and never will, it doesn't have a fancy studio splash screen at the beginning, and it certainly doesn't portray some \\"cause\\".  Thank God.  We need movies that are nothing like that.  I rarely give those 5 stars either.  But if I plunk down my hard earned dough and own the bugger and I enjoy watching it many times, it deserves 5 stars.  Ok it's not a perfect film but it's damn good and worth every penny.
0345451325|5.0|I'm not much into reading novels but I read this book for a school assignment and it just blew me away! Everywhere I went, I took this novel along with me. A tremendous amount of great work must've been put into this book! Every page I read, I felt as if I was in the world in this book. The detail of everything was awesome. I could just picture every scene, motion etc. in this book! You'll just enjoy this book!
B00003CY0V|4.0|A friend rented this while I was visiting.  I was entertained from beginning to end.  This movie had a great plot that was very intriging and unexpected, and despite playing loose with computers (twasn't totally awful like some flicks) kept me thoroughly entertained.  I went home and bought the DVD, that should tell you how I feel.  It was a far better movie than the dismal advertising portrays.  It is a bit prescient in topic as it would've been stalled for months like Collateral Damage in the wake of 9/11 had it been released later.<br />4 Stars because I enjoyed it enough to own it.
B00005NGZX|5.0|... This might be described as a cross between Neurosis and Today Is The Day, but comparisons are pointless here. If you have any notions of being a post-hardcore(Drowningman, Dillinger Escape Plan etc)connoisseur then this is imperative.
B000002OX7|5.0|FOR THE YOUNGER GENERATION...: I bought this album today and can't stop listening to it. If you're the least bit into rock music then this one's for you. It's REAL MUSIC, full of power and inspiration... I can't believe I waited so long to check this one out. All I knew from this band was the song \\"My Generation\\", but it didn't impress me that much. Now I gave this one a try becaused of it's \\"classic\\" status - and all I can say is that it ABSOLUTELY deserves all the praise. This is by far one of the best records I've ever listened to. The singer as good as Robert Plant, just AWESOME...the powerful guitar will just BLOW YOU AWAY, it's some of the best guitar work I ever heard (and I heard a lot), the drumming is EXCELLENT and the pianist is as BRILLANT as Ray Manzarek of The Doors. And the songs...well, give \\"Baba O' Riley\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" a try and you'll be PARALYZED by the sheer POWER of this music. And that's just the highlights in a record full of highlights! These guys knew what they did and they did it damn well. Last time a rock album shook me that much was Guns N' Roses \\"Appetite For Destruction\\", and that's a long time ago. This one's even older, but it's just as good as the best records you know. Go get it, you won't regret it. This CD is worth every single penny.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|This film is by far the best I've ever seen. The writing was magnificent, the actors: disgustingly talented. The cinematography was innovative and original and the directing was truely inspiring. I first downloaded this film not expecting to ever have to pay for it, 2 hours later I bought it and it's soundtrack which was a masterpiece in itself. Buy it now, it sure beats kicking puppies.
B00005RHGL|5.0|Its actually two DVDs in all, but if you like the movie, than you will love this DVD.  Scene by scene commentary from the director himself, the background to shooting the OK Corral scenes, theatrical trailers, ads, behind the scene comments and more are some of the bonuses on this DVD.  If there was ever a DVD that was almost to exhaustive, it would be this one, every extra you can think of it is on there, and then some.<br />And as for the movie itself, superb picture and sound bring to life the best western movie produced in the last 20 years, and maybe ever made.  Its a timeless tale that once you've seen, you want to see again.  Its a truly entertaining and moving story at the same time.  Its a shame every western couldn't be made this well.
B00004Y6Q5|4.0|The soundtrack to Requiem for a Dream is a masterpiece, unfortunately, very simmilar songs apprear frequently on the cd, some of which are very short, 11 seconds or so. For some this may be fine, but I need more structure.
B00005J6UP|4.0|I have always enjoyed this movie. It's escapist at its best, with a group of offbeat kids go on a wild treasure hunt, chased by escaped convicts and their psycho mom, discover a pirate galleon, lose a treasure and save their neighborhood, all in one day. <br />I hap hoped that the director would follow up with a Three Investigators movie but I never saw one.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|This is one of the WORST movies I have ever seen - 70, 80 and 90's music in a Renaissance piece?  Plus the story was depressing and stupid.  Just shows how much Hollywood critics are out of touch with reality that they gave high honors to this film!  Event the lumunous Nicole Kidman can't save this movie.
B000003BEV|2.0|this is neither an underrated psychedelic masterpiece nor the worst thing the stones did. but good god awmighty its pretty boring...citadel is a great song (done better by redd kross btw), and shes a rainbow and 2000 light years are keepers. the rest can be burned with the rest of the 60's trash. gomper perfectly illustrates keith's opinion \\"half the record was us trying to make a good record, the other half was 'lets give the people what they want and go home'\\". this release reeks of mick jagger. his poncing about on between the buttons is okay because the songs are good, and he recovered some of his \\"aftermath\\" attitude for a few albums afterward, but hearing him on this makes it clear that he is an \\"artist\\" first (and i use that only in the most condesceding way possible) and a rock & roller second....
1573222038|5.0|Having been a little disappointed by \\"Affinity\\" (perhaps, I admit, due to its ending), I absolutely adored \\"Fingersmith.\\" Waters is a flirt and throws out clues throughout this Dickensian adventure, but I was consistently one step behind all the curves and twists through which she drags our poor young thief-in-training, Sue. Waters language manages to evoke the period without sinking into it, lively and descriptive and long as books had to be in the days before TV but free of that period's moral hangups. Just a lovely read.
B000002P72|5.0|Whether you love B.B. or you are just building your collection, this recording is essential.
B00005QK3W|2.0|As a long time McCartney fan and an admirer of much of his work, \\"Driving Rain\\" left me scratching my head. Paul has never used an extensive vocabulary with his lyrics, but some of these songs really make me wince with embarassment. When the refrain of the title track (the title track mind you)is \\"1,2,3,4,5 -- let's go for a drive\\" (man, that is lame)I can't help but think that there are high school students out there who could come up with something much better.<br />Musically there are some good moments, but in other cases it feels like Paul was trying too hard to alter his usual style. Almost as if, instead of using the melody or chord progression that would naturally occur to him, he intentionally changed it in order to vary from his natural style. I can understand him wanting to try new things, but in many cases here it made the songs seem stilted and less melodic. In addition, a couple of songs are way too long. An artist should only test their listeners' attention spans with something that has enough variation and creativity in it to justify the length, which sadly, is not the case with the more lengthy offerings here.<br />It pains me deeply to say these things because, as I said earlier, I'm a huge fan and love most of Paul's work, but I found this one very hard to sit through.
B00003CXXP|4.0|I am not a fan of Kubrick. I did not like 2001 A Space Odessey, no matter how many times I saw it. But I must say that I was stunned at Spielberg's ability to complete this film, while remaining faithful to Kubrick's style. I did not know what to expect when I saw this film. But, in the end, I was in tears. I thought the cimematography was excellent, and Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law gave brilliant performances. I, like other reviewers, do not understand how this film could have gotten bad reviews. I thought it was a poignant and facinating film. I have never before felt compelled to post a review, but I thought this film was worth it. I highly recommend it.
B00004XONN|5.0|This was the first cd I picked up by Radiohead and it turned out to be thier most difficult to get into. Once you do start to get it though what a payoff...  Probably the most original peice of art(yes, art) that I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing.  Once you get it, be ready for some breaking in time though.  I'll admit I hated it the first time I listened to it but that opinion changed to the complete polar opposite after about a week.  Still sends my mind reeling whenever I put it on.  A timeless classic without a doubt.
0345413377|5.0|I don't read series that often. I get bored with the same old characters and the sometimes amazing twists and turns the author takes to keep the story going for another book or two. His Dark Materials blew my mind, frankly. The first book was wonderful and they actually kept getting better. I seriously can't recommend these books enough. They're imaginative and I adore all the characters...I'm pretty sure that there's a deep philosophical truth underneath it all if only I could spare the time to ponder it. Five out of five stars for the whole series. Buy this one for your family and friends.
B00003IQQA|1.0|1 bonus track = added garbage in an era of bad music.  To claim this is rock music is a shame on rock itself.  This is pop.  It's sad that this in a import to countries where music still has integrity and taste.  Radiohead, U2, Led Zeppelin, Stone Temple Pilots, Travis, Oasis.  This is what rock is about.  Creed misses on all accounts with formulaic, repetive melodies of safe commerical pop with rehashed lite-metal riffs straight from the stolen bin.  The US is gullible, but I didn't think it would come this far....
0385335482|5.0|This book is a perfect light read for when you're sick. I didn't go out last night because I didn't feel well and ended up readign 2/3 of the book in one sitting. It's another one of those British 20-something's autobiographical novel, this time dictating the woes of Rebecca Bloomwood, a financial journalist whose own finances have gone down the garbage chute. She finds herself horribly in debt and tries and tries to remedy the situation, but nothing seems to work. I was afraid when I picked this one up that I wouldn't have sympathy for the main character, but that wasn't a problem. Though Rebecca makes quite a few mistakes and gets herself into quite a few laugh-out-loud funny situations because she's afraid to face her debt, I found myself rooting for her all the way through.
0553277472|5.0|Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, by Robert Pirsig<BR>First Published 1974, 25th Anniversary Edition published 1999 by Vantage / Random House<BR>Review by Ian Glendinning, February 2002.<br />ZATAOMM is a journey - at least four in fact - two real in the present, one historical narrative, and one metaphorical.<br />The real-time is in fact some 30 years ago - immediately post-hippy era - the book having been published in 1974. The first journey is a cross-US Motorcycle buddy-ride - Easy Rider without the drug culture. The second is a man-and-boy mountain trek - a physical challenge to find themselves and define their relationship - Ex-hippy Walk in the Woods if you like. The third is Pirsig's historical, and painfully personal, autobiography as a student, a teacher, a husband and a father preceding the real-time narrative. Common people and locations link the first three stories, but the fourth, a philosophical argument is woven into all three.<br />As an experience the book moves quickly - chopping between the various threads - dropping clues and hints at the past events and connections to be revealed later, but always leaving enough doubt and emotional confusion to press on. Whilst several threads do get resolved, with a real-life mix of surprise and anti-climax, several remain wonderfully open ended - no-doubt succeeding in provoking the thoughts Pirsig intended.<br />Practically the motorcycle and its maintenance are archetypes for technology, and the qualities of these are metaphors for the philosophical \\"virtues\\". In fact the concept of quality and the ancient debate between rational (logical) and subjective (rhetorical) views of the world are truly the subject of the book. Like Sophie's World the entire book is a vehicle for a serious philosophy text, though unlike that particular best-seller, ZATAOMM provides a gripping and involving story. The emotive power arises from Pirsig's own credentials in philosophical academia as a student and teacher of rhetoric, coupled with the passion and frustration that jumps off the page and grabs the reader by the throat. No surprise to find that Pirsig's schizophrenic alter-ego, Phaedrus, hides a past brush with a mental institution. The frustration of the rational trap, leaving madness as the only apparent escape route is evocative of both Catch-22 and Cuckoo's Nest.<br />For anyone with an interest in the big questions of life, this is a good read. For anyone concerned with making progress in the details of the underlying philosophical debate, it is a text worthy of serious research. Both will find that those threads with uncertain resolution, command at least one re-read.<br />(Reviewers Note: I find myself identifying strongly with the central character, yet when first given this book on an MBA Organisational Behaviour reading list in 1988 I chose not to read it. Now, having read the 25th anniversary edition, I find myself moved by it and regretting that my main thesis did not benefit from it at the time. I am currently conducting research into knowledge modelling.)
B00005JH7D|5.0|I've always enjoyed this multi-talented artist's solo albums, but his latest is clearly the work of a mature artist in a groove.  He plays a plethora of instruments, he writes amazing arrangements, he gathers a who's who of contemporary jazz artists to join him -- is there anything Marcus can't do?  It's always exciting to feel you're watching an artist hit his personal stride.  \\"Amazing Grace\\" moves me every time I hear it.  I can't wait for his next outing.
0425152251|2.0|I read this book (almost) because I was genuinely interested in researching some philosophy from a standing start. A novel seemed like a good place to start. I've started to read it 5 or 6 times, but still not managed to finish it.<br />I have to say I found it too slow and predictable. There is very little to disguise the fact that it is a series of history of philosophy essays. No subtley in the anonymous letters metaphor. No characters or narrative to capture the imagination.<br />By contract Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is an evocative roller-coaster ride, that nevertheless exposes important themes of philosophy. No contest.
B00004Z459|5.0|There isn't a lot to say about this album. It is exellent! The lyrics are intelligent with no bad language so that should please a few people ( i.e. parents ) and every track is catchy - it's not thin like a lot of other album tracks. <br />You can't help but love it. 10 outta 10
B00000JY1X|5.0|This album is indeed sublime.  You will own it eventually, so why not just buy it today?
0316776963|5.0|this was the funniest book i've read in a very long time!<BR>a laugh out loud book, virtually every chapter
B000021XS0|5.0|I used to have a job, a family lots of friends and some fun hobbies.  Then I bought this CD.  I don't sleep, eat or do anything but listen to this.  All I do is sit and listen to this CD.  All I want to do is sit and listen to this CD. <br />Please don't help me.
6305508550|1.0|Although this movie had a lot of potential it was far from reaching that potential. The sound track used Rap music that was full of nasty langauge and poor moral messages. There were totally inappropriate scenes that added absolutely nothing to the movie except perhaps offend peoples sensitivities. This movie is definately not for youger members of the family. My opinion is to just let this movie fade into the dirt where it belongs.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|Being a Beatle fan from the moment I heard them, I was exicted to know that all their number one songs were on one CD.  After asking for this cd for my birthday, christmas, anniversary and never getting it I decided to take matters in my own hands.  I LOVE it.  It takes you back to the time you first heard these spectacular songs. Some, you think of very good times, some not so good but always that little tug to the heart when you first heard the song. I recommend this to all true Beatle fans. I have purchased this CD for many people and they all have the same reaction. Awesome!
B0000025BL|5.0|I have listened to this particular album on record (LP), 8 track tape, audio cassette, and now I want it on CD. My all around favourite! Best thing for Spring Fever, the blues, or just want to get &quot;attitude&quot;...
0393973867|4.0|In July 1972, Author Jared Diamond, was walking along<BR>a beach on a tropic island of New Guinea, where as a<BR>biologist he studied bird evolution.  By chance, he<BR>ran into a local politician, named Yali, who was<BR>working to liberate what was then Papa New Guinea from<BR>the Australia government.  After hours of<BR>conversation, Yali posed the question, \\"Why is it that<BR>you white people developed so much cargo (technology)<BR>and brought it to New Guinea, but we black people had<BR>little cargo of our own?\\"   Why did wealth and power<BR>become distributed as they are now, rather than in<BR>some other way?  Diamond was troubled that he did not<BR>have an adequate response to Yali's Question.  Fast<BR>forward 25 years -- Diamond writes a 425 page answer.<br />The most common explanation to this question involves<BR>implicit or explicit assumptions based on biological<BR>inequalities.  Usually these racial explanations are<BR>cast in some sort of Darwinian argument where<BR>causality is often left in question.  Diamond thesis<BR>attempts to refute these theories with an alternate<BR>theory.  Relying on a combination of history,<BR>archeology, and microbiology, and genetics, Diamond<BR>suggests that the most striking differences between<BR>the long-term histories of different cultures have<BR>been due not to innate differences in peoples<BR>themselves but to differences in their environments. <BR>These environmental factors include: continental<BR>differences in the wild plant and animal species<BR>available as starting materials for domestication;<BR>environmental factors affecting rates of diffusion and<BR>migration; and continental differences in area or<BR>total population sizes.  Diamond believes that these<BR>geographical inequalities set different civilizations<BR>on pre-determined trajectories to develop political<BR>organization, technological advancements, and immunity<BR>to disease that allowed them to encounter and conquer<BR>other civilizations.  <BR>A cultural historian in a past life, I get all excited<BR>about this sort of thing.  <br />As one can imagine, trying to explain the history of<BR>civilization in one volume is an arduous task. <BR>Diamond chooses to explain his theory in broad strokes<BR>then uses natural experiments at distinct points in<BR>history to demonstrate how his ideas play out.  This<BR>is a general problem with all meta-histories. <BR>Historical methods teach us that it is virtually<BR>impossible to forge a bulletproof argument without<BR>delving into the minutia.  But when focusing on the<br />\\"big picture\\" issues, there is just too much<BR>information to cover.  Diamond does a very good job<BR>managing this balance.  He begins by outlining his<BR>methods and follows through on his explanation with<BR>dedication and accomplishment.  He goes into just<BR>about the right amount of detail on every subject and<BR>infuses the traditional historical approach with a<BR>healthy dose of scientific discovery.  The chapters<BR>concerning the domestication of plants and large<BR>animals are a joy to read.  While speaking on the<BR>familiar new world conquest, Diamond is balanced in<BR>the application of his detailed examples to forward<BR>his theories.  Notably, Diamond uses Australia and the<BR>south pacific to demonstrate the dissemination of<BR>technology and China to discuss the application of<BR>unified language and political entities.  In fact,<BR>with my American History background, I was more<BR>partial to the Euro centric examples.<br />So what's bad about the book?  One of my pet peeves<BR>involves arguing by anecdotal evidence and I cringed<BR>every time Diamond brought up some story about a<BR>bushman to illustrate his point.  But this was a minor<BR>annoyance.  Another problem is Diamond's paucity of<BR>footnotes.  There were several portions of prose that<BR>I felt should have been annotated with further<BR>discussion and evidence.  I should also warn you that<BR>this book is a little dense.  Be prepared for a 20<BR>page discussion about the cross pollination of<BR>language.   It's a good idea to remember that I've got<BR>a degree in this stuff.  Back when I was younger,<BR>smarter, and more exciting, I used to pour through<BR>thousands of pages of this garbage every week.  Beaten<BR>into submission by a desk job and dearth of ...<BR>pitchers of beer, I found the last 100 pages of Guns,<BR>Germs, and Steel difficult to get through<br />So if you are up for the challenge, \\"Guns, Germs, and<BR>Steel\\" is a insightful and rewarding book.  For me, it<BR>was probably a good substitute for chasing women and<BR>the cultural/political theories almost kept me warm at<BR>night.   All joking aside, I guarantee that this book<BR>will change the way you think about European conquest.
B00003CXB7|5.0|MASH was a breakthrough movie on many fronts.  <br />It was Roger Altman's personal breakthrough movie after several years apprenticeship in TV and smaller feature film work.  It was a breakthrough for the ensemble film format.  Yes, there had been successful ensemble films before this, but all were largely dependent on the \\"All Star Cast\\" format.  MASH represented the first major successful film, both commercially and artistically, that relied on an entirely on a relatively unknown cast.  And, finally, MASH broke through as the first major success as an anti Vietnam War vehicle to gain mass appeal.  In a way, it marked a major turning point in popular attitudes toward the Vietnam War.<br />Set during the Korean Conflict, MASH tells the story of the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital.  The MASH was an agglomeration of regular Army personnel and drafted civilian doctors unindoctrinated to-and often intellectually antipathetic towards, army practice and procedure and authority.<br />The movie graphically depicts the brutality of war, though it shows no actual war scenes per se.  (The only gun fired during the entire movie is when an official shoots a pistol into the air to mark the end of the period during a football game.)  What you see is an unending string of dead and horrible wounded soldiers brought to the MASH from the front to be worked on at the hospital.  Te constant scenes of battered and maimed bodies in surgery is sufficient enough to convey the horrors of the field of battle and the inherent cruelty and inhumanity of modern warfare. <br />One also sees the toll that is taken on the doctors and staff of the MASH unit itself.  <BR>The various mad-cap antics the doctors and staff engage in to blow off steam are hilarious and immensely entertaining yet there is a dark, unsettling edge to the humor.  You know that the fact that they are surrounded by insanity of all sorts and inhumanity of all kinds leads even the doctors-so disciplined and value driven in ordinary circumstances-into acts that are ethically dubious to the extreme.  It is definitely funny-it's also somewhat sad.<br />The resulted one of the best movies of all time and the very best antiwar movie ever made.<br />This is a 30th anniversary edition that has been restored and contains several retrospective clips as well.  The restoration is exceptional and the retrospective stuff is interesting and entertaining as well.<br />On the whole and excellent, value packed package everyone should own!
6303314015|5.0|Of all the Disney animated films, I think that this one is my favorite.  My kids absolutely love it, so I have probably seen it 30 times, perhaps more.  And each time, embarassing as it is to admit, this story moves me and I see subtle details I missed the last time round.  Perhaps I am overly sentimental, but I think it is truly great drama and that there is even wisdom in it.<br />With its ecological message and the far deeper calling to live up to potential and responsibility, it has great lessons to convey.  I talk about them to my kids, who understand them through the love that the old king Mufasa conveys to his son.  Then there is the comic relief of Timon and Pumba, who are truly original court-jestor creations.  Even...Scar, so brilliantly personified by the voice of Jeremy Irons, exudes uncanny arrogance and selfishness.  There are also the wise fool, Raffiki, and the slimy Hyenas.<br />Although it is fashionable to dislike Disney films as some kind of symbol for American cultural imperialism, I must admit that I really really like just about all of them.  Sure, they simplify old tales and add happy endings or eliminate tasty ambiguities, but what is wrong with that?...<br />Warmly recommended.
0780626966|4.0|I've always love this series of films. Even the sequels, which get progressivley less horror orientated, and more amusing, save for Wes Cravens Final Nightmare, which is a masterpiece.<br />This box set is a must for any real horror fan. The Nightmare Series has become one of the most imitated horror films ever, along with Friday the 13th and Halloween.<br />The films are all restored beatifully, and the colours and contrasts are fantastic. The sound is excellent too. The only drawback is the censorship, and European viewers will notice a couple of missing clips from murder scenes in one or two of the films. Howeverm the cuts ARE slight, and don't ruin the enjoymant of the film. The bonus special features disk is a must. It's amazing, packed full of extras. Theres an intereactive Freddy game, which is very disturbing. As you progress, more extras are revealed to you. I don't think I've even completed it, yet.<br />If you're choosing between the Euro version, or the US version, the US version is the Nightmare set to get. You won't be disappointed, and with any luck, you'll wake up screaming with the sheets soaking...
B00003CX5P|5.0|I give the DVD for The Phantom Menace 5 stars, but I would only give the actual movie 3 at the most.  I'm not saying I didn't like it, but I wish it had been different.  I can't say too much that hasn't already been said by many others.  I wish Obi Wan had been the focus of the story, or it might have been interesting if Queen Amidala had been the focus.  What I think the movie is really lacking is a hero the audience can identify with.  Qui-Gon doesn't work as a focal point, because he never really has to face any particular challenges.  It really should have focused on Obi Wan.  Anakin doesn't work as a focus either, because every already knows what becomes of him.  Maybe it would have been interesting if George Lucas had come up with a completely new story set in a totally different time period.  He still could of used the same cast.  I was excited when I first heard of the main cast members, I like Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Liam Neeson, but unfortunately they weren't given anything very interesting to do.  The DVD package however is excellent.  The one hour documentary is one of the best (if not the best) I have ever seen on a DVD.  Besides the main documentary there is a deleted scenes documentary that is very good and a series of short documentaries originally produced for the web.  George Lucas (along with a couple other people) offer a feature length commentary that is interesting to listen to.  There are anamatics and several other interesting things to explore.  If you like the movie at all this DVD is definately worth getting.
B000002LQR|5.0|... I'd have to take with me to listen forever more, it would be \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\".<br />The definative Chili Peppers album, it's hard pushed to beat.<br />I don't think they'll ever produce another album as groundbreaking as this one, even though \\"Californication\\" goes back to their roots after guitarist Frusciante's Sojourn, and the melancholy \\"One Hot Minute\\" with awe-inspiring guitar talent Dave Navarro.<br />This album does many things for me, and I'm not the only one. The soulful sadness of one song can serve as a contemplative trigger, while the furious ferocity of funk can drive you into a frenzy of energy and joy for life. This is an album that can suit my every mood; it can compliment it, or create it. It's my \\"Going Out Partying\\" album, it's my \\"Damn The Morning After\\" album.<br />I urge you to try it. One of the definative 90's albums is \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\". Listen to a piece of music history, and let the funk flow freely.
0066620996|5.0|Through extensive research and simple analysis Jim Collins uncovers what few business books deliver: real usable business wisdom.  Absent are the parables, jargon, and other simplistic linear ideas with little real world applications.<br />What he finds are humble, realistic, but demanding and clear leaders; an emphasis on getting the right people first and the vision second; a unique mixture of focus, discipline, and patience<br />What is equally important is what he does not find: flamboyant media darling executives, extravagant or complicated compensation systems, or reliance on technology as a competitive edge.<br />What he uncovers are real solutions to sustainable growth and success, derived from real companies and histories. Some of the companies came from depressed industries (Nucor and steel), and some came from rapidly changing industries (Wells Fargo and banking), but all shared very common learnable and applicable traits.<br />In his conclusion Collins asserts that going from good to great is less consuming and less painful than wallowing in mediocrity; and \\"the building of momentum adds more energy into the pool than it takes out.\\"  It ultimately gives greater meaning and reward to all of the people associated with the company.<br />It would be hard to find a better reason to read and absorb these ideas.
B00003CX8J|3.0|Whether you're a fan of the comic books or not, this fun, action-filled adventure is an interesting venture into the world of comic-to-film, from the mind of &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot; director Bryan Singer.<br />With a fairly impressive cast, including veterans of both stage and screen Patrick Stewart (Professor X) and Sir Ian McKellan (Magneto) this film delivers a real-life yet futuristic look at the popular comic adventures. With several serious undertones of race, equality, and politics, there's a classic veneer of witty one-liners and excellent special effects, coupled with a sensitive story-line and well-presented action sequences.<br />The DVD offers some good extras, but the one that most fans wanted was not to be found: an audio commentary. With a couple of Easter Eggs included, fantastic sound and good picture quality, it makes this DVD not bad, but not one of the best.
B00004XQ83|5.0|This is an amazing compilation of spare, early American folk music. It's like one of the old Alan Lomax collections (in fact, I think the first song, Po' Lazarus is from one of his compilations), with the old mountain tunes, gospel blues and early country that his work is known for. So, if you're a fan of that kind of early American folk and gospel, that spare, bluesy, plaintive melody,  you'll likely love this album. After you hear it, you'll probably want more, but unfortunately, some of the songs were not performed by existing groups (the filmmakers apparently brought together an incredible group of single artists to perform together) so you'll just have to track down each of the artists' own work, which unfortunately again, is often not the same as the work they performed on this CD.<br /><br />I liked the collaborative songs here more than the artists own styles. One of my favourite songs on the album is done by three young girls (In The Highways by the Peasall sisters), who are not even recording artists and there is nothing else of their amazing talent available- O, sisters, where art thou? Even if you have never considered this genre of music before, give it a try and if you know where I can get some more, please let me know.
B00005JKQX|5.0|I cannot remember being so impressed with a movie.  Russell Crowe was outstanding and although I did not know the story of John Nash I shall never forget it now I have seen the film.  Russell Crowe's performance was totally believable and shocking, yet one can feel only sympathy, pride and joy for John Nash as a man.  The whole production was unique.  All Oscars well deserved.
1577311523|5.0|The best book I've read. I read this book and brought it into practice. I am peacefull now and no longer searching. <BR>The question is not 'is this a good book' but 'are you ready to bring it in to practice?'
6305499365|4.0|I think this film is hysterical. I recommend it to anyone who is disgusted with corporate America.  Subjects and characters portray real life situations in a satirical very funny way. If you are fed up with your job, if you are a general worker or corporate manager, watch this movie. You have to relate to someone or something in this film.  Sooooo funny!!!!
6301247485|2.0|When I saw this I wanted to gag.  Literally gag.  The acting is some of the worst I have ever seen.  With the exception of Scott Wilson's portrayal of the garage owner Mr. Wilson.  In this film version it is impossible to feel sympathy towards in any of the characters, it is also impossible to like any of the characters.  Sadly, it gets worse.  The score (from what I have heard, in this VHS edition was not the one in movie) was way overdone and overblown.  With the back acting and score combined I half expected Jay and Daisy to run towards each other across open fields of wild flowers with open arms.  Jack Clayton uses the eyes of Dr. Eckleberg too much, and in doing so the movie loses some of the meaning that the book held.  The only reason I gave this movie two stars was because the costumes and sets were wonderfully done.
B000056NX5|5.0|I am 14 and saw this version about five weeks ago with my friends.  Since then I have fallen in love with it and have watched it atleast 3 times a week since then.  I can safely say that I know a lot of the fine details when watching this.  Although I am not Christian I found this production completely compelling.  I think that Glenn Carter as Jesus icould have been better cast as he does not seem to portray the part very realistically but the costume progression is very interesting.  Whereas, Judas by Jerome Pradon is marvellously put across and even if the voice does go in some parts I think this adds effect as he is supposed to be dying.  I also like the the black leather jacket for his costume but he cannot walk in his shoes and the costume for \\"Superstar\\" is quite tacky.  Renee Castle as Mary Magdelane is supberb and conveys feeling magnicentally, and is very pretty.  The other parts of Annas, Caiphas and Pontius Pilate are also well done and entertaining.  The apostles do seem to get on rather well and of a high standard of acting, particularly Simon Zealotes (Tony Vincent) as my friend would say.  Overall I like the way this production is shown on screen although still like theatre.  Gale Edwards as director has done a very good job
B000002H8F|2.0|I like the Pixies a lot, but I found this disc to be dull and boring.  It has none of the dynamics of their earlier material.
B00003CXXP|4.0|A.I. is not for all tastes - it's not a pulse-pounding popcorn movie, so if you liked Pearl Harbor or Jurassic Park III, look elsewhere - but I must dispel some of the nonsense posted here.  A lack of \\"likable\\" characters is the case for nearly all of Stanley Kubrick's output, and a good deal of that of the greatest directors.  They're after deeper levels of life, which yield more unusual pleasures and insights than the comforts of \\"likable\\".  The character of David does, in fact, conquer challenges through effort - he survives the Flesh Fair by pleading for his life like a human child, rather than submit to destruction like the other robots.  Taking him for human - the whole intent of his makers - the Flesh Fair crowd spares him.  David yearns for the woman he has been programmed to love - making him no different from any child - and he will pursue her through the millennia because he cannot grow old, or disillusioned.  He achieves maturity, or humanity, when he is willing to settle for a single day of her resurrection, never thereafter to see her again.  If people are put off by the film's unconventional picaresque structure, they probably felt the same upon first seeing Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey or Full Metal Jacket, whose seemingly disjunct three acts actually followed a progression beyond their foreground melodramas to tell a larger, and deeper, story.  The story here is not the lifelike capabilities of robots, but the more disturbing and uncomfortable limitations of we humans, who are no less hard-wired to pursue our needs than is David, yet able to learn as we explore - the definition of artificial intelligence.  Anime fans, check out the pilot episode of the original Astro Boy cartoon - the parallels with A.I. are amazing.  Both works challenge our belief in human specialness and ask whether it is the mere appearance of appealing qualities that matters.  The fact that David's abandonment so angered viewers suggests the answer.  If he's no more human than a washing machine, who cares?  But he passes the Turing test - as do we, biological computers that we are.  We are programmed to be horrified when a mother abandons what SEEMS to be a child.  Spielberg and Kubrick have, deftly, won their bet, and made us believe. Critic Roger Ebert was unique in being unmoved by this scene, because David is a robot.  But this is an intellectual reaction, made in resistance to the pull of emotion - for Haley Joel Osment is brilliant in a tricky role, and scandalously overlooked by the Motion Picture Academy - no male adult wants the competition for the lead Oscar, obviously.  If you're ready for something challenging, subtly complicated, melancholy, wistful and haunting, open your mind and go where the film leads.  There's nothing wrong with dreaming as David dreams.  Yeah, there's less action than in Blade Runner, which dealt in similar issues.  Yeah, the teenage guys in the first audience I saw it with laughed uncomfortably at the slightest pretext, their girlfriends were dabbing tears away when the film ended.  So were my wife and I -- personal resonance with some scenes -- and we saw it five times.
B00005ASOC|3.0|I avoided this movie in the theaters because I didn't want to see some &quot;great white hope&quot; movie in which an older, elite white man is the savior to a black boy.  Luckily, this movie wasn't that patronizing.  It was quite refreshing to see a black male student that hit the books harder than the basketball court.  Nevertheless, I do fault this movie for never showing the black student have an interest in black authors.  Dead white men were not society's only deep thinkers and this movie, maybe even accidentally, supports that fallacy.
B000002GDJ|4.0|2nd release?  I believe so.  Expanded musically.  Summers and Copeland keeping it all together.  Sting a media darling of the highest order gets all the glory and actually believes it!  That's rich.
6304806442|4.0|Trainspotting was one I avoided in the theaters, and waited for the DVD, for whatever reason.  I appreciated the fact that it painted a realistic picture of heroin addicts and their recoveries and relapses, European club life, and intertwined Aids, hanging around the wrong people but still calling them friends, and showing some light at the end of the tunnel without being cheesey or cliche.<br />McGregor was great as the lead character and the troubles his close circles of friends have was very a-typical of a serious drug addict.  The way they took advantage of him and displayed such bad taste and dishonesty, and their sleazy lifestyles is something any drug addict experiences most assuredly to some degree.  A normally good person with caring parents finds himself hanging out with losers and creeps and continually justifies his reason for putting up with them, and has to, because of his or her drug habit.<br />The scenes dealing with fecal matter were unnessecary I thought, a bit over the top and not very funny, just a bit too juvenille and shock-oriented, but regardless they were brief and the symbolism of him diving head first into a toilet was actually very good....that addicts will sink to almost any level to feed their habits, and do things they normally would never even think of sober.<br />This film really wasn't a black comedy to me, as many made it out to be, it was humorous at times, but also very serious and disturbing more often than not, without being depressing and unwatchable, such as \\"Requiem For A Dream\\" was in my opinion.<br />Trainspotting is simply a very good film and one of my modern favorites.
B00005YW4H|3.0|The music on this album is like its cover: too pretty. I heard her on Charley Hunter's last CD and loved her voice against the funky backdrop. Here, the accompaniment is almost syrupy--and unoriginal. It gets dangerously close to MOR pop, not something you would expect to find on BlueNote. Norah should get with a jazzier, funkier, riskier sound--or risk winning a Grammy and making millions for singing the sugary kind of pap that passes for soul these days.
6302038324|3.0|NATASHA RICHARDSON survived this one - barely!  Ditto Gabriel Byrne.  Not one of Mr. Russell's stellar trips, but it does peak the interest here and there complete with 'pounding soundtrack'.  Yes, it's that odd little tale of pre-Victorian flower-children romping around Europe, circa early 19th century.  And it just so happens that one of the kids wrote &quot;Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus&quot; [must have been in draft form, the novel does plod.......] during one of these wild week-ends.<br />WHO they exactly?  Well, we have Alfred, Lord Byron, physically handicapped, he was likened to old Nic [Satan], due to a foot deformity, then there was that reputation and whispers of incest [Medora], bisexuality ['friend' Dr. Polidori with err .. opium in tow].  Mary Godwin [not quite married to Percy Shelley, the 'sensitive' budding poet], mildly pregnant, then Claire - a sister - also possibly pregnant [Byron?  Shelley?]  As I said - wild!<br />It's more or less a very bad hallucinogenic experience, be sure to take a bromo or two afterwards, BUT there are a few choice visual moments!  One almost expects the Rocky Horror crowd to drop by for a nightcap or two...<br />[Quite a departure from the very proper BYRON/MARY SHELLEY prologue to &quot;Bride Of Frankenstein&quot; - except for the excessive eye-shadow on Byron, and those dweadful accents .....]
B00004XONN|4.0|This LP is very much different from there first 3 albums. Combining electronic pices with hints of there older rather rock albums not quite as good as there first albums but it grows on you the more you listen to it. They should revert back to there old rock music. It reminds me a very passionate poem by Robert Burns, to a mouse. It expresses being in a field of corn in the sun chasing after mice.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Anyone that has a problem with the strokes is obviously, jealous, ignorant, or deaf cause these guys are it! The title track sounds like Lou reed, and the Modern Age is a very likeable track.

If u can buy the import cause without New York City Cops it lost some points but still a 5 star album..BUY IT!
0316777722|3.0|I was surprised that this book wasn't as funny as I'd hoped/thought/expected it to be.  I often find myself laughing hysterically to Sedaris' NPR stints, so I found it odd that I found the book more &quot;odd&quot; than funny.  I do have to give credit to one chapter in particular though...&quot;Jesus Shaves.&quot;  This is one of the funniest chapters I've EVER read.  I'm sure the folks around me on the subway thought I was possessed as I was shaking, trying to control the tears and laughter.  If only the rest of the book was as sharp....
6304696566|5.0|One of the reasons that The Searchers stands out so prominently in my mind and heart, like those soaring and almost achingly beautiful monoliths in Monument Valley, is because of what it has taught me about understanding and cherishing my own humanity, and how denying the humanity of other human beings really just degrades the degrader.<br /><BR>Upon seeing the movie again several years ago, I realized the importance for the first time of the fact that John Wayne's character, Ethan, came to the West after having fought as a rebel officer in the Civil War.  That his commitment to fighting for the South had more to do with racism than state's rights becomes evident as soon as Native Americans enter the picture, especially as murderers of his kin and kidnappers of his young relative, Debby (played later in the movie by Natalie Wood).<br /><BR>This terrible event, and others in the movie, seems to justify and fuel his racism and propel and maintain him on his five-year search to find and destroy both Scar, the Comanche leader who led the raid, and Debby -- whom he now considers on a par with the Native Americans, as being less than human and not worthy of life itself.<br /><BR>But then there's Marty, Debby's mixed-blood brother and Ethan's companion and conscience on The Search, a figure about whom Ethan has great ambivalence, simultaneously tolerating and reviling him.  I think Marty represents both a wall and a bridge between Ethan and his lost humanity, symbolized by Debby.  A wall, because he physically stands between Ethan and Debby when Ethan pulls out his gun to kill her when they finally meet.  A bridge, because Marty's stubborn love for his sister, his willingness to put his life on the line for her, and NOT a burning hatred for the Comanche, finally forces Ethan to fully  acknowledge Marty's humanity despite his mixed blood (a change of heart that Ethan demonstrates by willing his possessions to Marty).  And in granting Marty's humanity, he ultimately crossesthe bridge and acknowledges Debby's humanity; when Ethan finally has the chance to kill her, he embraces her instead and takes her home.<br /><BR>What Ethan has found, what he has recovered, is not just a young relative who has been through great separation and pain, but his own humanity.<br /><BR>The brilliant and iconographic final scene of the movie, with Ethan standing in the doorway of the homestead and then walking away, alone, always left me moved, but unsatisfied.  I didn't want Ethan to be alone now that he was whole again.  But, then again, his being whole is the central point, not his being alone.  Rather than feeling frustrated by his apparent return to solitude, I finally realized that it was fitting:  as Ethan now addresses himself to the world as a complete human being, he may fight again, but never on the side of the dehumanizers.  He has finally left his racism behind, just as he left his rebel uniform behind.<br /><BR>In closing, I was reminded of The Searchers when I read an article recently about military chaplains.  I had always assumed that they were there to somehow bless the violent proceedings, to symbolize that \\"God is on our side.\\"  But that's not how they saw it.  As a group, they saw their mission as being to preserve the humanity of the men and women in their charge -- a key part of which was asserting the humanity of the enemy.  One told of walking by two pilots talking about taking out \\"targets.\\"  He stopped and asked if the \\"targets\\" were people.  When the pilots nodded \\"Yes,\\" he said \\"And don't you forget it.\\"  I bet that chaplain just might be a fan of The Searchers...
B00005JKYS|4.0|This film will rank as one of the all time great battle movies.  It's not a war movie; it doesn't try to prove a point or tell the tale of a whole war.  Just one very meaningful, and very heroic (and tragic) battle.<br />It's not a 'message' movie, or a blatant political statement, or a movie that shows a bunch of roaming, scared, crazy or doped up GIs trading attrocities with the enemy.  It shows a valiant, dignified effort from solid, young, and patriotic soldiers in one of the few major *conventional* battles of Vietnam (before the war turn exclusively guerilla).  <br />The movie has a good human touch too, wonderfully portayed by Gibson, who shows where the battle really begins...in his mind during training camp and battle study at home.  It gets into politics tangentially, for a Vietnam movie could not be made without some nod to the heavy political weight that plagued the war and its soldiers.  But politics were relatively under the surface back then...back then before it was a huge quagmire...back then when soldiers didn't doubt their patriotism and their country didn't doubt their integrity.<br />A great depiction of a great, unsung slice of history.  You'll enjoy it (but beware the violence and gory a la Saving Private Ryan).  Special effects and discussion of tactics also make this movie special (and the enemy has a face, voice and brain, too).  Maybe some of the pauses are a bit too drawn out, that's the only thing keeping me from giving a 5 star review.  But don't miss out on this one!!
B00005T30L|4.0|Having never read 'Ghost World',I've no idea how faithful this adaptation is, but I can say it made for an interesting film. With the glut of 'teen' stories out there, it was refreshing to see one that seemed realistic. This film tells the story of two freinds struggling with the transition from high school to the 'real' world. In their sarcastic boredom, Enid and Rebecca answer a personal ad, setting the man who placed it up for a cruel joke. They decide to watch him wait as his date never appears. Enid takes the joke further and befriends the man,learning more about him and herself as well.The film tackles the myriad issues of finding one's way via this odd situation.As with all good films, things aren't nicely resolved in the end. Be sure and keep watching after the credits...you'll get a surprise!
B00000BKI4|1.0|The late 90's was not a golden period for rock music. It was a time when critics &amp; fans contorted themselves into agonising positions where mediocre neu-psychedelic bands like Mercury Rev and the Flaming Lips started to sound good. <br />Hopefully the arrival of some inspired new bands in 2001 - the Strokes, the White Stripes - will pound the nails into the coffin of this dreary genre.<br />Now and again on this CD you recognise the playing of the wonderful Garth Hudson, and the memory of all the brilliant old Band albums he played on utterly overwhelms his current surroundings. And that second-hand pleasure is about all this music offered me.
0440224764|5.0|The story of this book is how a lawyer steal 90 million dollars from his firm, goes to Brazil to live but he can not use his millions because he could be caught, he has a girlfriend in Brazil who is helping him with his plan to have a trial, be a free man and spend his money with his girlfriend. When you reach the end of the book, you will say \\"it has to be that way\\" but in the middle of the book, you will never expect that end.
1555047793|3.0|I think &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; was a good book, telling ut much about the conditions in the 30s and 40s. It has a rather tragic end where George has to make a terrible decision. The theme of friendship and following your dream forms the development of their quest for their dreams throughout the novel. Beautifully written by Steinbeck.
B00003CXAD|5.0|This is it!  This is the movie to show to your preteen children to give them an understanding of what it means to struggle for something, for the barest of necessities.<br />John Steinbeck and John Ford did America proud, allowing us to look inward to discover solutions for our social problems.  As a country we would do well to do the same again.<br />Tom Joad (Henry Fonda) and Ma Joad (Jane Darwell) are the central characters of this film, but many other, richly defined, roles can be found here.  The young husband who deserts his wife because he's ashamed that he can't provide for her ... the waitress whose, somewhat hardened, heart is softened by the plight of the Joads ... the Grandfather who dreams of California and eating grapes while their juice runs down his chin ... the  grieving father warning the Joads of the hard times ahead in California ... and who can forget the family friend who refuses to leave Oklahoma, and slides further and further into insanity as his entire community disappears.  <br />Each secondary member of the cast has something invaluable to add to the story and the standout is the great John Carradine as the disillusioned, x-preacher, Casey.  It is Casey who helps Tom to recognize the injustice in their 'migrant' world, and Casey who provides the supreme sacrifice and catalyst for Tom's promised future of being \\"there\\" for the little guy.<br />Yes, this movie can fall victim to overt sentimentalism, but the underlying feeling of injustice is probably the main 'character' in the story.  While it's overall theme can be depressing, you can't help but smile when Ma Joad says \\"We're the people that live.\\"<br />I absolutely love this movie, I think you will too.
0783230621|5.0|I found this movie to be well written, fast paced and gripping. It held the attention of the entire family. Excellent choices in casting Hamilton and Brosnan.

6303314015|5.0|The movie Lion King is the best depicted movie from a past time ever made. this movie was a rendition of the Shakespearse's \\"Hamlet\\". The story of Hamlet (Simba)was the death of his father (Mufassah) in which the Claudius (hamlet's uncle/Scar) killed his own brother, married the queen (Sherobi)and took over as king. While in office he took advantage of young Hamlet (Simba) and told him to run away in his time of grief. Hamlet listened and to soon return toface the grief and to find the murderer of his father. Hamlet (simba) later found out that his uncle (Scar) had killed his father and he then challenged him for the throne. Hamlet won and was king for a split second until he died from the battle, however Simba lived and took over as king. A wonderful rendition of a beautiful classic. The Lion King, the best movie ever depicted.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|Dire Straits' debut during the height of punk reminded the anti music punksters what real music was all about. The bluesy precise picking of Mark Knopfler drives the songs slowly like an old man and woman out for a sunday drive doing 35 in a 55mph zone. There is no rush to get to the next song so slow down and listen and hear/see the rich musical landscapes that are created here. Pure musical beauty. Don't pass this slow driver by! It is still impressive over 24 years later.<BR>Also listen to Live at the BBC for live versions of these songs.
B00005LMBK|1.0|The Gorillaz are by far the worst \\"band,\\" if you can even call them that, that I have heard in my entire life.  First, the \\"band\\" is just a collection of no-talent artists from other failing, no-talent bands.  They are nothing but a one hit wonder, except the thing is, \\"Clint Eastwood\\" [is not good].  The person singing the chorus sounds like he has down syndrome, which, unfortunately, is not appealing to my tastes, and shouldn't be to anyone elses, unless of course he did in fact have down syndrome, in which case he should be congratulated for the success and effort of overcoming his handicap.  This, however, is not the case, and no congratulation or applause should be rewarded.  This is the worst CD ever created, and everyone is dumber for having heard of the Gorillaz.  They can't even spell correctly.
B000002RA1|5.0|The first HAWKWIND album, aside from the opening and closing<br />tracks, sounded like one long, very unpleasant dream. IN SEARCH OF SPACE is MUCH, MUCH BETTER and still stands as one of their<br />greatest albums! Every track, except the headache inducing acid<br />trip ADJUST ME, is great! It's odd that this is the only album<br />where DAVE BROCK and NIK TURNER wrote songs together, for their<br />two colloborations on this, YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT and MASTER OF<br />THE UNIVERSE, are two of the best HAWKWIND tunes ever and were<br />the first two songs that really defined who HAWKWIND were or were<br />going to be. YOU SHOULDN'T DO THAT is 16 minutes worth of hard<br />rock guitar riffing, free form jazz soloing and spaced out vocals<br />and vocal chants and has some outstanding jazz influenced drum-<br />ming from TERRY OLLIS; it also has a very cool bass line by DAVE ANDERSON and some wild and crazy electronics by DIK MIK and DEL DETTMAR(love<br />them names!!). On top of all that, it's a very catchy song and even at 16 minutes long, STILL doesn't feel long enough!<br />MASTER OF THE UNIVERSE is a heavy metal/space rock classic, with<br />one of BROCK's most irresistably catchy guitar riffs. Again, the<br />drumming is outstanding, as is DAVE ANDERSON'S bass playing.<br />I never cared for the live versions of this song; I feel that they sped it up too much. This is the definitive version of this<br />song. CHILDREN OF THE SUN, a NIK TURNER/DAVE ANDERSON, collobora-<br />tion is a very folksy/hippy like acoustic number and a mighty<br />catchy tune at that! DAVE BROCK's two songs, YOU KNOW YOU'RE ONLY<br />DREAMING and WE TOOK THE WRONG STEP YEARS AGO, are also quite en-<br />joyable; the former being a very psychedelic song and more like<br />something from their first album and the latter an acoustic<br />guitar driven protest song. The only real fault with the album, I<br />think, is NIK TURNER's vocals, but this is but a minor gripe!<br /> This is a great album; no HAWKWIND fan should be without it!
0345448898|2.0|As an avid fan of young adult and mature fantasies, I was eager to read Philip Pullman's trilogy.  I was very disappointed.  Although he plainly has a creative mind, his presentation of his plot is difficult and annoying to read.  His characters are suprisingly one-dimensional and hard to care about.  Fans of the Harry Potter series would do better to look to up and coming authors like Garth Nix and Tamora Pierce, or to fantasy classics such as The Chronicles of Narnia (C.S. Lewis) and The Lord of the Rings (Tolkien).  I would NOT reccomend these books to my friends, my parents, or the children I babysit.
1558216847|5.0|The Long Walk is an awe inspiring story of seven men who risked everything in escaping from a Soviet labor camp in Siberia and ultimately ended up some 4000 miles south in British India after having endured the snow of Siberia, the heat and sand of the Gobi desert and the frozen mountains of the Himilayas.<br />This story is so frightening in the disregard for human life demonstrated by the Soviets while at the same time amazingly inspirational in the kindness of strangers.  For over a year these men traveled on foot and if not for the overwhelming generosity of all of those they encountered on their journey somehow managed to survive a brutal journey.  As one of the men himself so eloquently put it, &quot;They do a lot to wipe out bitter memories of other people who have lost their respect for humanity.&quot;<br />I could hardly put this book down and have no doubt this occured as Slavomir recollects and am astonished that some would be naive enough to claim it was fabricated.
B000009EUM|5.0|Scoundrel Days is a very different turn one would expect a-ha to take after the commercial success of their debut Hunting High and Low. while it is not a musically challenging album, it is certainly a striking and very darkly emotional one. the well-crafted music sneakily delivers some of the most aching lyrics of a-ha's career. there is an obvious artistic difference between this album and their debut-- Morten Harkett's voice is much richer and seems more involved with the words (best example of his emotional investment is the quiet moment during \\"The Swing of Things:\\" his voice during the line \\"an ocean between us and room in my bed\\" is particularly haunting) and the music sounds wider. they take their time with the songs-- nothing is rushed through. Scoundrel Days is one of the most adventurous, emotional pop albums I have ever heard, and the songs stay with you days after listening. this album gives much more than one expects from what is supposed to be a simple pop album-- it has a well-defined soul. for this reason I am giving it the highest-possible rating.
B00005O3VC|5.0|This film was my introduction to Monty Python.  When I was a boy, the local PBS station aired it frequently.  I was hooked instantly and began watching the television series as well.  The Pythons pioneered a delightfully absurd brand of comedy that has been imitated but never equaled.  I actually enjoy some of their later films more (particularly &quot;The Meaning of Life&quot;), but this skewering of the Arthurian legend remains one of my all-time favorite comedies.
B000002L7Y|3.0|Hunting High and Low is a strong debut for this trio from Norway. \\"Take On Me\\" is included on most compilation CDs for the 1980s so it is tempting to breeze over the first track due to oversaturation. however it is a nearly perfect opener as it sets the tone for the rest of the songs. each is well-crafted, pure pop: that Pa(u)l Wakataar took the time to write thoughtful lyrics is more of a reminder that what passes for \\"pop\\" today is merely a slick package made by faceless producers. songs such as \\"Train of Thought\\" and \\"Living a Boy's Adventure Tale\\" are observations from a different perspective than the typical radio song while the closer \\"Here I Stand and Face the Rain\\" hints at the darker material a-ha would perform on their next album Scoundrel Days.
0060977493|1.0|The first thing I would like to mention is that I am by no means a scholar when it comes to literature. I do, however, love to read books. I have my own particular taste for what I read, (mostly science ficiton and fantasy), but if a book is interesting and easy to read, then I believe it is worth looking in to. I read numerous reviews on The God of Small Things, and most of them had good things to say about Ms. Roy's book. Unfortunately I did not enjoy the book. I believe the reason that I did not really like it is because of my own personal views on the way a book should be written. When I read a piece of literature I don't want the text to be so confusing that I spend most of my time trying to figure out what the author is saying. It feels as though all of my mental energy is spent trying to piece together the sequence of events taking place. What the writer is trying to describe in his/her book should imbue itself on my memory for a short period of time, allowing me to immerse myself in the world the author has created; books such as Ender's Game, by Orson Scott Card, or The Lord of the Rings trilogy, by J.R.R. Tolkien. I did not have these feelings while reading The God of Small Things. There are parts of the book where one does get into what she is describing, like the march of the Communists around the \\"skyblue Plymouth\\". But there are not enough of these moments to suit me.<br /> I also do not care for the way Ms. Roy writes the story. I find the first few chapters extremely difficult to get through and understand. There are numerous flashbacks which go back and forth, back and forth, and it is very hard trying to figure out when things took place. One minute Ammu is alive and talking to Rahel and Estha, and on the next page she has been dead for years. It is the same with other characters, like Mammachi. There needs to be clearer transitions between time eras to help readers understand exactly when certain events take place. Another thing that irritates meis the way Roy strings words together. It is almost like a foreign language inserted into the text. Words like: \\"thiswayandthat\\", \\"wetgreen\\", and \\"sourmetal\\". Perhaps these words are her own way of trying to desribe things, but it just doesn't work for me. Along with the togetherwords is her free use of capitalizing words in the middle of sentences. \\"It was her idea that Estha be Returned\\" and \\"For a Breath of Fresh Air\\" are good examples. I am not sure if Ms. Roy does this for emphasis, or to describe the way the children think, or what, but it works about as well as the imaginaryvocabulary.<br /> Ms. Roy's tale does have some merits however. She attacks the Indian \\"caste system\\" and \\"love laws\\" in her novel, which to me is a good thing. I did not know how serious and harsh these customs are in India until I read The God of Small Things, and her story shows how evil the love laws and caste system are. Of course you must read through the whole book to understand all of this, and to see what happens between Ammu and Velutha....not an easy thing for me. As I have stated before, I am not a literary scholar.  But from my point of view this book is too difficult to read to really be enjoyed. For those who like their literature challenging, then by all means, tackle this one. I do not recommend this book, however, to those who simply want a novel that is easy to read. This book requires a lot of time to read, and is very difficult to really understand.

B000001FA4|4.0|I think that U2 albums can only be understood in context of the album before and the album after, in this case, between \\"War\\" and \\"The Joshua Tree.\\"  Each album is a footprint of the expanding sound and technique of what was once a lowly Irish punk band.<br />I also believe that albums are more than a mere \\"missing link.\\"  The studio albums are interactive with the live albums.  Play \\"Wide Awake\\" after listening to \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" and listen how the studio and popish \\"Bad\\" evolves into the concert powerhouse, not only more edge, more girt, and more power, but with more Edge and his guitar.<br />The improvement becomes more prominent with \\"A Sort of Homecoming,\\" which is more toned down than the album version.<br />The tracks, especial \\"Wire,\\" still sound like they are a wannabe punk band, but the sweeter kiss comes out in the production style with \\"Promenade\\" and \\"MLK.\\"<br />\\"Unforgettable Fire\\" is a more restrained piece, and conjures up the powerful images that have become Bono's trademark.  \\"Elvis Presley in America\\" is a sound piece that works a good mantra.<br />I think this album is good, in its own right, and evokes complex images over complex instrumentation.  There is a not a lot deep production styles of \\"Actung, Baby\\" but you get some of the best quality lyrics on any U2 album
B00004Z311|5.0|I first saw \\"Legend\\" as a young child.  The imagery, story, and music never left me, and it's unbelievably difficult to find Legend merchandise for the hardcore fan, so when I do find it, I snatch it up immediately.  I am very excited about this restored version--it's the version that was meant to be seen originally, and there is no doubt in my mind that it will be the outstanding film that the original theatrical rlease strove to be, but failed.  I am glad that the people behind this release have taken the time to make sure it will be a quality item--when it was delayed I felt disappointed, but am glad they pulled it from its former streetdate in order to ensure the highest quality possible.  I just want to say thanks for that.<br />As for the film itself--it is an enchanting blend of the rich darkness of an original fairytale blended with the innocence of youth you so often find in said stories.  It saddens me when Tom Cruise refuses to mention this film in his repertoire of roles, because it is, in my opinion, one of his freshest, most honest roles ever.  Mia Sara is beautiful as a princess gone awry, but the outstanding performance hands-down is Tim Curry's as Darkness.  The other supporting characters also lend a definite hand, and without them, the film would utterly fail.  The scenery is mystical, and appropriate for the film--it is unreal at times, but the atmosphere clicks into place as the film rolls along.<br />A different soundtrack is being presented along with the director's cut.  It will be disorienting for the viewer at first--the viewer who is used to the Tangerine Dream soundtrack, but, like the surreal atmosphere, it will blend into the enjoyable accompaniment that it was supposed to be.  I own both of the soundtracks, and I can definitely say, for myself, that I prefer neither one above the other.  I love them both--the exception being that the Tangerine Dream soundtrack is nostalgic for me.  If you've seen the \\"European\\" cut of the film, the soundtrack presented there is the original Goldsmith score, and it's strange upon first hearing.  But I fell in love with it, and the melodies are both dark and haunting, and light and joyful, when they need to be, and there are hints of the destruction to come in many arrangements.<br />I can't say enough about this beautiful movie.  Even in the horribly edited state that it has remained in for so many years, it comes across as the perfect film to me.  Now that it is is being released with the intent of a having a fully finished product as the director and creator intended, I must repeat that I have no doubts in my mind that it will be a more suberb film, and that it will leave many other fantasy films behind it in its splendor.
B000001E18|4.0|First of all, Zooropa isn't U2's best album.  It is an experimental EP that got out of hand, coming in the wake of U2 reinventing themselves with \\"Actung, Baby.\\"<br />Secondly, Zooropa isn't so much a concept album as it is a concept.  It is a musical tribute to the chaos and uncertainty surrounding the unification of Europe into the European Economic Community, then into the European Community, and finally into the European Union.  On the cover you see a superimposed purple flag with yellow stars in a Betsy Ross-esque circle, which is a suggestion of the European Union flag.  Most Americans miss this tension, but it is painfully felt by many European youths.<br />Thirdly, I like Zooropa.  There is something about U2-call it soul, if you will-that grabs me. I think it is because I am Christian and I resonate with U2's passionate Christianity.  Never mind what you think of their weird albums, such as Zooropa or Pop, you must admit that U2, and not just Bono, has a soul and a desire to do right. They are the greatest charity band ever.  And you have to respect that.<br />The album itself isn't as bad or unusual as the reviewers make it out to be.  It was originally to be an EP, but it just got out of control.  Songs such as \\"Zooropa,\\" \\"Lemon,\\" and \\"The First Time\\" tap into the existential tension in mid-1990 Europe.  Confusion and uncertainty are the watchwords.<br />\\"Some Days\\" is bono doing white rap, and is a fun song.<br />\\"Numb,\\" \\"Daddy's Gonna Pay for Your Crashed Car,\\" \\"Dirty Day\\" and \\"Babyface\\" deal with issues of relationships, be it man to woman, man to society, or man to TV, in the case of \\"Numb.\\"<br />Two tracks are do quite fir in.  \\"Stay (Faraway, So Close),\\" is from the soundtrack of a B&amp;W German film of the same name, and \\"The Wanderer\\" has Johnny Cash singing lead vocals over a techno-pop Zooropa track.<br />Most people look at this album as forgettable, but I think it is a \\"Missing Link\\" in the evolution of U2's sound.  I confess that this isn't Grammy material, and from what I hear, none of these songs are in their tour rotation.  But listen and enjoy.<br />This album, however, is significant in U2 iconography, \\"Lemon' is a key song since lemons have become the official fruit of U2: they began singing in a lemon on the Popmart tour, and the football team in \\"Stuck in a Moment\\" video is called \\"the Lemons.\\"  Weird.Grammy material, and from what I hear, none of these songs are in their tour rotation.

Utilizing standard rock instruments(-electric guitar,bass,drums, etc.)and an increasing number of electronics(-audio generators, effects,etc.)the album heralds the bands first excursions into the Space realm that made them famous.Solid drumming and bass work form the foundation of this album with Brock's hamfisted electric and acoustic strumming adding the ever important rhythm.

I don not worhip di caprio.<br />Ok, so this is really two filsms, the firts part being a chick flick with 5romace and umentionable behavior, the second half a guy flick with action and the ship sinming.<br />The jewel thing wasa  carbon copy purple ditto of Rosebud of citizen kane.

If there is one thing this book tought me, it is not to assume things about people that you don't really know.  A loving story about love, pain, and grief, that will touch your heart.  As bad-boy Landon falls for the minister's daughter, Jamie, he learns so many new things.  But most of all, he learns how to love, and look on the inside.  Sadly, with a tearjerking ending, Landon must also learn to say goodbye.  A book that you will never forget,and a book that will never get old, you will surely love it!
B00005LC1H|5.0|This series is exceptional.  In my opinion, only John Ritter rivaled/rivals John Cleese in the mastery of physical comedy.  What gives Cleese the edge is his dry humor.

I have been meaning to buy this series for some time now, and to have it on DVD ensures that it will be a timeless treasure for me and my friends to enjoy.  My favorite episode is the &quot;Goose Step&quot; episode.  I highly recommend this purchase to any true fan.
0679879269|4.0|I can see why there is such a wide span of opinions about this book. It has many things going for it, but there are also many serious problems with it, and everyone has a different idea about how much worth these things have.<br />Let's start with the good stuff. The wonderful imagination Pullman showed in the first book dimmed a little in the second, but most of it seems to be back now. Lord Asriel, one of the more interesting characters from Book 1, returns, along with several others. We get interesting new worlds and some new ideas. The plot moves at a good clip. In short, there is plenty of enjoyable stuff.<br />Now for the problems. Pullman seems to have difficulty tying up all his plot threads, which sometimes leads to characters doing nonsensical things. Also, he attempts very ambitious things that he can't always pull off. Depicting celestial beings in a satisfactory way is very, very difficult, and I'm sorry to say that it doesn't really happen here. The scene depicting the defeat of the Metatron, in particular, is disappointing. And the conclusion...well, suspension of disbelief is a little tough. Pullman should have drawn out the books so his characters aged more.<br />If you liked the first two books, you might as well read this one. I didn't find it entirely satisfying, but I was glad to have the conclusion. Judging from this page, many people weren't let down at all--maybe you will be one of them.

B00000DGUG|5.0|The second cd from Alanis Morissette is very very good, great actually.  I really like it better than Jagged Little Pill.  Alanis' albums are all snapshots of her life at that time.  In the making of JLP, she went through a lot of pain.  During SFIJ, she didn't go through as much pain.  However, I disagree with those who think only pain can make good music.  Good music is something that deep and something that is honest. While JLP was all of those things, SFIJ goes on a different path to achieve its lyrical deepness (the lyrics are very crazy, and that's what makes it good).  The reason why people don't remember Alanis for this record is that it isn't what \\"angry\\".  In other words, to fully appreciate it you have to stop and analyze it (which isn't what most people do).  Its a work of art thus better than JLP becuase of its depth.<br />running time - 71:50<br />1. front row - **** Lyrically, this is the best song on the cd (also the longest) With the amount of lyrics in this song, you could probably write a short novel.  It's about Alanis and her lover, and why they shouldn't be togehter.<br />2. baba - ***** KICK [bottom] rock song about fake gurus.<br />3.thank u - ************** this is my fave alanis song of all time, its sooo good.  The video for it very underrated along with the album. <br />4. are you still mad - **** good song about alanis asking forgiveness from a lover she did wrong (on JLP, it was the other way around).<br />5. sympathetic character - **** musically, it's the weakest song, but it's very sad if you pay attention to the words.<br />6. that i would be good - *********** WHAT GOT INTO HER MIND??!! if this song was released as a single, i believe SFIJ would have sold much more. excellent<br />7.the couch - **** cool song with a cool beat about psychology<br />8. can't not - ***** one of the discs stronger points<br />9.

B00000DGUM|3.0|Skid Row was one of the most talented &quot;hair&quot; bands to come out of the late 80's.  They stuck around til the mid 90's and they still have quite a following, with Sebastian Bach's new role on Broadway and solo projects.<br />With that said, this album is sadly missing perhaps Skid Row's best 2 songs of all-time, in &quot;Wasted Time&quot; and &quot;In a Darkened Room&quot;.  Why they left these two tracks off is beyond me.  Instead, they put a terrible &quot;Beat Yourself Blind (LIVE)&quot; and a mediocre at best &quot;Psycho Love&quot; in their place.<br />I liked the fact that they threw a few unreleased tracks on there, but to leave off &quot;Wasted Time&quot; and &quot;In a Darkened Room&quot; was the ultimate of sins.  In my opinion, here were Skid Row's greatest Hits:<br />1. Youth Gone Wild  2. 18 and Life  3. I Remember You  4. Midnight/Tornado  5. Monkey Business  6. Quicksand Jesus  7. In a Darkened Room  8. Wasted Time  9. Firesign  10. Eileen  11. Into Another  12. Breakin' Down  13. Psycho Therapy<br />No need for any other songs, because none of their others are &quot;greatest hits&quot; worthy.  They had some other good songs, but these should undoubedly be on the album.  In addition to the two songs they left off that was ridiculous, they should have also included &quot;Midnight/Tornado&quot;, &quot;Firesign&quot;, &quot;Eileen&quot;, and maybe &quot;Psycho Therapy&quot; (I liked it).<br />By leaving off so many key songs, I can't give this album more than three stars.
B00004XQP4|4.0|Incorporating Swing and traditional pop, Green Day once again evolves in Warning.  The album, though a departure from their traditional simplistic punk stylings, still holds its own.  Tracks like &quot;Macy's Day Parade&quot;, &quot;Waiting&quot;, &quot;Minority&quot;, and &quot;Church on Sunday&quot; don't dissapoint.  However, skeptics in terms of whether Green Day is &quot;still punk&quot; may be dissapointed: after all, they are getting older (the ripe old age of 30) and the lyrics delve deeper into the psyche than on any other Green Day album.
6305776326|5.0|some people i know have said that they don't like it, but i personally thought it was one of the most hilarious SNL flicks ever, comparable only to the likes of chevy chase and john belushi. i think the reason i liked it so much is coz the first time i saw it was with my best friend, and we couldn't stop laughing through the entire movie, so we had all the lines down in no time. all i ask is that when you get ready to watch it, that you take to heart the fact that this movie is based on a three-minute skit, and it's just pure comedy. it doesn't try to be anything more than that. so get in the mood to laugh before you watch it.
B000002U82|5.0|What can one say about this album other than it's really, really, really good?  From &quot;Speak to Me/Breathe&quot; to &quot;Eclipse&quot;, this album is one movement after another of symphonic rock and roll.  The classics, being &quot;Money&quot;, &quot;Us and Them&quot;, and &quot;Time&quot;, never fail to dissapoint.  Other, more &quot;obscure&quot; tracks, such as &quot;Brain Damage&quot; can echo in one's mind....  One thing is for certain: Once one listens to Dark Side of The Moon, he/she will never forget it.  This is THE classic album of the 1970's.
0930289455|5.0|I remember first reading this astonishing book about ten or so years ago around when I first got into comic books. Up until that point I had just read typical mainstream super-hero fare with stories where a bad guy is introduced, commits his crime, and the good guy takes him out. status quo remains in place and everybody goes home happy. <br />Then I chanced upon this book, not even yet knowing who Alan Moore or Brian Bolland were and was completely blown away! This was a story that mattered. The event's of this book changed the character's in ways that they could never go back, and that's a very rare and good thing in comics. Never has a comic book so brilliantly dug so deep into the nasty bowels of the Joker's mind like this. You see the events that lead up to him going over the top and becoming the criminal who would one day be Batman's arch foe. Then we have Joker's confrontation with Batgirl which would forever change the character's in the Bat books and go on to really show just how insane and demented the Joker actually is. Personally, every time I read it, I can't wait to get to the end of the story when Batman get's his hands on the clown for one of my favorite fight sequences ever! You know a man can write when he get's you feel that much hate for a fictonal character!<br />A first rate story, from a first rate creative team. This story is only second to The Dark Knight Returns.
B000002MP2|4.0|At the time, Green Day was as pop as punk could get without sounding like a bunch of poseurs.  And to some people, Green Day did sound poseurish.  However, this album (Dookie) made punk -- well, pop.  The album itself is a collection of two and three minute tracks full of teenage agnst and somewhat comical representations of suburbia (though, on the surface, it seems like a fun little album with the complexity of a bowl of fruity pebbles).  If I were to reccomend anyone to purchase just one Green Day album, it would be this one.
B00004YC2F|4.0|This recording is perhaps the most satisfying account of Rachmaninoff 3rd in the modern recording era. He draws huge but velvety sounds from the piano. The first movement, especially is a monumental achievement, as Volodos builds the momentum to its crashing climax of Rachmaninoff's original cadenza. The sound is thunderous, but not clanging. He controls the color of his sound even at the most extreme of its spectrum. <br />The third movement doesn't quite match up to Horowitz's jagged, but electrifying account. It doesn't move you to that state of febrile ecstasy. The sense of battle between tutti and piano gets a bit lost, as Volodos chooses to be a bit discreet and politic.<br />There are many good accounts of this concerto by Argerich, Horowitz, Santiago Rodriguez, Berman, Ashkenazy, et al. And I've recently heard the young pianist, Lang Lang, live, playing this concerto with sublime musicality and fearless abandon that left me breathless. What he will offer in the recording studio is sure to be tantalizing, but until then, you will find no finer digital recording of Rachmaninoff 3rd than this disc.
B00003CXZ1|1.0|If ever there were a lesson on how not to translate a popular video game series into a movie it would be Mortal Kombat Annihilation and Tomb Raider. Both movies are B-Grade and only good for an MST3K party at midnight. Tomb Raider was torn apart by the critics, and with good reason. It features no coherent plot, mediocre acting, poorly planned action scenes, and dialogue so bad it makes an episode of Barney seem like Legacy of Kain... not that the games were much better. The game is well known for [poor] graphics, and horrid control, I guess the same could be said of the movie, and while Angelina doesn't pivot around to change direction, she may as well have. The story of this movie is just bad. When asked to summarize it's plot a friend of mine said \\"Jiggle jiggle splash splash, jiggle jiggle\\", and when we pressed further and asked for the moral of the story he simply replied \\"Kaploowey\\". I think that pretty much sums it up pretty well. While Jolie is a beauty, this film is not. It is over hyped garbage if I ever saw it. It is an excellent MST3K (Mystery Science Theater) movie though.
B00005V0X5|5.0|This Megadeth album is kick [bottom].  When I got this I was like, WOW.  Rattlehead is my favorite song on this album.  When I first got this album I thought it was going to be kind of boring but when I listen to it, it was cool.
B00003CXRM|4.0|When I first saw this movie, I didn't understand it and thought it was stupid.  My problem was that I didn't understand anything about Homer's Odyssey.  I didn't realize that this was supposed to be rather silly.<br />So after a short time passed, I thought I would give it another try.  I thoroughly enjoyed it the second time through.  Some of the music is a bit slow for my tastes, but a lot of it is just great, down-home bluegrass.  The movie can drag on a bit as well.  (That's why I gave it only 4 stars).<br />The characters in this movie really are characters in a different sense.  Clooney, Turturro and Nelson do a wonderful job in this movie, and seem to portray people of this era well.<br />I think that if you know ahead of time that this movie is supposed to have some silliness in it (okay, a lot of silliness), you will enjoy it as I did.
0765342294|5.0|This book should be required reading for anyone who wishes to have a broad science fiction knowledge! _Ender's Game_, and all of the series that follow it (with the possible exception of _Children of the Mind_ and _Shadow of the Hegemon_) are outstanding.<br />_Ender's Game_ introduces us to Andrew Wiggin, boy genius, as he is inducted into a militaristic school whose students are hoping to protect Earth from the invasion of an alien species, the Buggers. We follow Andrew (or \\"Ender\\" as he's called in the book) through his training, his trials, and his inner thoughts as he progresses rapidly to the top of his class. Leading the various other children in war games comes fairly naturally to Ender, and soon his peers grow to respect him - with the exception, of course, of those who resent him for his brilliance.<br />Saying anything more would ruin the story, and it's too good a one to spoil it for anyone. Suffice it to say, this is a very satisfying first book in a fantastic series. Card scores again.
B000050XEI|5.0|This is truly a wonderful album. I got this over a year ago and immediately was amazed by the beauty of Enya's voice.  \\"Time\\" is certainly a good piece but \\"Pilgrim\\" is incredible.  A definite buy!!!
B0000509C4|5.0|Creepshow 2 is just as good as Creepshow 1 was. Although Creepshow 1 had a slightly more comic book feel to it, Creepshow 2 still delivers the goods. There's gore, don't worry. The first story \\"Old Cheif Woodenhead\\" is a good story about two men and their leader(who is a son of a father that is in an indian tribe). Their leader is named Sam. ... They rob an old couples store(which has a statue at the front called Cheif Woodenhead). Sam's father gave the old couple stones that are worth thousands of dollars, because the old couple were running out of money. ... I liked this story alot.<BR>  \\"The Raft\\" is about 4 teens terrorized by a man-eating muddy thing in a lake, and \\"The Hitchhiker is about a woman being terrorized by a man she hit with her car accidentally and drove off without reporting it. <BR>   My favorite was \\"The Raft\\" because it was scary,funny, the acting was very good, and it had an awsome TWIST ENDING! I liked this moive very much. \\"The Hitchhiker\\" was creepy too, but the scariest one is \\"The Raft\\"! You have got to see this movie! The DVD is excellent!
B00003CX8J|5.0|Fear and dread crept over me as I first began to follow the making of this movie. I cringed as Ana Paquin was announced as Rogue, I cried when they didn't cast Derek DeLint as Magneto (who looks a lot like Jim Lee's interpretation of the character) and when I found out that Beast would not be making an appearance in this film I lost all hope for this movie being any good. I figured that X-Men would enter the tradition of [bad] super hero flicks along side the Batman movies... Thankfully Bryan Singer and David Hayter (AKA Solid Snake of Metal Gear fame) are geniuses and handled the X-Men, the limited budget, the costumes and everything with a surprising accuracy that made me see this movie almost as much as I saw Episode 1 when that came out. Only with this film it wasn't the title of the movie (though I am a huge X-fan) but the movie itself. X-Men was surprisingly well written, and now I've sworn to marry Ana Paquin... For what they set out to do, although her accent could have been more consistent, she worked perfectly as Rogue, and Ian McKellin is fantastic as Magneto, no... Perfect. These actors (except Hally Berry as Storm) became the characters for me. They worked out so much better than I had though, especially new comer Hugh Jackman's incredibly accurate portrayal of Wolverine. Jackman IS Wolverine as far as anybody needs to know. The story is much better than most comic to movie translations, and the best part is that the movie stays in the grays the way that the comics do, not having any villains that are just pure evil (except Sabretooth, who is sadly under used in this film.) The fact of the matter is that X-Men is definitely a super hero flick done right, it stays true to the spirit of the comics with only Storm being a disappointment. Some of the dialogue is a bit cheesy, but it's mostly tongue in cheek, and over all the movie is a lot of fun for people of all ages, weither or not they're X-fans, I firmly believe that most people looking for a good action drama will love X-Men. (Here's hoping that Beast will be in X2.)on drama will love X-Men. (Here's hoping that Beast will be in X2.)
B0000029DD|4.0|Current music has been sailing through a creative doldrums these past few years. The resurgence of c_ck rock and prefabricated pop acts had left me high and dry so I went through my old records and rediscovered Jeff Buckley's &quot;Grace&quot;.<br />I popped it in the cd player and immediately cued the title track. It was familiar yet it was refreshing to hear such a voice and a melody so alien to the ears. No 1-4-5 chord progessions, no cliched blues licks, no guy trying to sound like Eddie Vedder... I listened to the rest of the album. The haunting &quot;Hallelujah&quot; that Cohen himself couldn't hold a candle to still gives me shivers. I still knew all the words but I didn't dare sing along. It's a cardinal sin for a man to sing like that. But in this case Buckley is forgiven. &quot;Last Goodbye&quot; now carries with it a tinge of irony...<br />It's such a waste. The whole experience just makes you want to think: WHY DIDN'T GOD TAKE SCOTT STAPP INSTEAD?
059035342X|4.0|A Review By Kory<BR>A young boy, Harry Potter lives on Privet Drive with his aunt, uncle, and cousin. His mother and father died from a black magic wizard named Voldemort, even though he was told they died in a car crash. Harry is sent many letters by a school called Hogwarts School of Wizardry, which he is not allowed to read because his uncle treats him very unfairly. The family goes to a secluded house out by the beach thinking no one would find Harry there, but Hagrid comes to Harry's rescue, and later takes him to Hogwarts where Harry meets many new friends on the way.<br />This story was very fun to read. I really liked the way the author laid everything out in the story, and made the story very suspenseful yet adventurous at the same time. I also enjoyed how Harry and Hagrid became good friends and they were always there for each other. During the beginning of the story Harry had a very rough childhood having no parents and having to leave with his horrible aunt and uncle. Harry finds out around the middle of the story that he is one of the most well known wizards alive, because he was the only person strong enough to live through Voldemorts powers. Harry notices that someone is trying to take the \\"whatever\\" Fluffy the three-legged dog is guarding, so Harry, Ron, and Hermione go on an adventure of there own.<br />I would strongly recommend this book to almost anyone. It is a very fun and adventurous book with all kinds of curves. The reading isn't the easiest, but definitely not horribly hard. I am definitely going to read the second Harry Potter and hopefully read the rest.
B000003TA4|5.0|I have now owned five copies of this CD!  Why?  I literally have worn out four of them and am now on my fifth CD.  No other rock band has ever had such a large impact on me.  I can't get enough of it!  It's still, after all the years, since it's release, the most FRESH sounding music in my collection.  Truly amazing music, from a truly amazing and extraordinarily talented group.
0553573403|5.0|I just finished A Game Of Thrones and have started A Clash Of Kings. They are both great if you like<br />reading books in a series. If you just want to read one book this isn't it. As soon as you finish this book<br />you really want to move on to the next one. There is very little supernatural stuff going on in A Game of Thrones<br />and a whole lot of plotting and backstabbing. There is no Hollywood [content] in this book. If they ever made it a movie<br />they would ruin it. Start reading this book far back in your chair because you be on the edge of it<br />soon enough
B00005OAIE|5.0|I listen to this CD over and over again and I just can't get tired of it.  I so highly recommend this CD that I should be paid by Sony for the hype I put out there.  One of my favorite songs is &quot;No Such Thing&quot; which flows and is just so much fun to sing along with.  This guy is good and you can't help but fall in love with it as soon as you hear it.  Buy this CD and enjoy it.  I guarantee it's a great CD.
B000062TU1|5.0|I think that this DVD Could have been MUCH better if they kept more of the basic structure in it. But I still really enjoied the Movie. It did have some really good parts, like when Harry was under the trap door with the chess peices. Smashing Each other to bites. And him fighting Voldermort/Proffesor Querill. I didn't picture Him turning to dust, but I did think of Querill just meling from Harry's touch. That was just birlint!!
1559408898|5.0|Believe me when I say that this is NO regular action movie. This is the emotional story of a man, a cop, and a loving father. <br />When Detroit cop, Alex Murphy, tries to capture the known fellen, Clarence Boddicker, he fails, and gets shooten to death by Boddicker and his men. When Murphys scream is heard all over the factory, the villains laugh with no sense of emotions what so ever. The loving father will never again return home to his wife and son, but they couldn't care less.<br />Murphy is then taken to a hospital. His body is dead, but his mind is still alive. Flashbacks comes to his head. He sees his son infront of the TV, smiling. He sees his wife, also smiling at him. He knows he'll never ever seen them again....<br />A company called OCP, are working on a \\"Robocop\\" project, led by a man named Bob Morton, to make an artificial robot. Everything on his body is metall, but his mind is still the same. <br />After a while being Robocop, Murphy starts getting flashbacks from the day of his death. He sees his killer infront of him ... He knows he'll never have peace with himself until he gets his revenge...<br />Robocop is a film that you must see. Many people have this rule of judging movies by their title before even having seen them. ... I admit, Robocop is a cheesy title, but what about \\"Superman\\" or \\"Batman\\". They're both just as cheesy. Also, many people complain about all the violence in this movie, but in my opinion, I think its necessary to really show how bad Murphy is tortured! If this movie had been like Robocop 3, it would never have been the same! The violence and the swearing makes this movie more lifelike. People DO swear in real life, and people DO get shot in real life, and thats why Robocop is so good, because it totally reflects reality as we know it!<br />Peter Weller IS Robocop. Just as much as Christopher Reeve is Superman and Michael Keaton is Batman! Weller was THE number one choice for Robocop, and I'm glad they cast him. He makes thismovie come to life. His facial expressions at the end are what I like the most. They will bring tears to your eyes...<br />I'm not gonna review the DVD, but I gotta tell you that its pretty good. The only complaint that I have is the grain in the alternate sequences in the Directors Cut version! Other than that, the featurettes, trailers, the commentary, the deleted scenes, and the storyboards will keep you entertained for hours!<br />Get this movie, or there will be trouble!
630587493X|5.0|This isn't going to be a long review. There are plenty of those in this list already and I'll say that most of the positive ones hit the nail right on the head. If you are looking for a movie with:<BR>1. Emotional depth.<BR>2. The ability to provoke deep thinking about what it means to be human.<BR>This is a movie for you. If you are looking for:<BR>1. An over-the-top Robin Williams comedy (like, bizarrely, the trailer seems to indicate). Not that I don't enjoy those too.<BR>2. A fast pace.<BR>3. An everything-turns-out-all-right ending.<BR>4. A movie to show the kids.<BR>Look somewhere else. This movie has/is none of those things.<br />'nough said. I loved it. Hopefully some of you will too.
B00005O3VC|5.0|I first saw this movie by accident. It was one of those free cable weekends they had back when and I just happened to turn my TV on right after the opening credits.  So I didn't know what it was, I just heard horses approaching through the fog.  I knew something was a-wry when the horses didn't show up but some guy banging coconuts together behind a fop dressed as a king.  By the time Michael Palin and his &quot;peasant wife&quot; cut him down and assured him that they didn't vote for him, I was captured, enraptured and rolling with laughter.  A Monty Python masterpiece, one of the funniest films ever made.
B000050XEI|5.0|One of Enya's best work.  This CD is incredible beautiful.  I received it as a Christmas gift and loved it.  Even my 10 year old daughter loves it.  Go buy the CD, you will not regret it.
B00003CWPR|4.0|This movie presents some powerful images of something or another and kept my attention, and that is in part my reason for the four stars. Much has been said about this movie, in no case finding much in the movie itself to cry out loud and clear, \\"Yes, that's the real message!\\". There's little didacticism here for all the effort to find some. With all this going on, I might as well put in my two cents worth, probably again getting little confirmation from the movie that my take is clearly what it's really all about. But I'm guessing maybe as for the viewers who want to see so much about sex in it, the joke is really on them, they being the ones whose eyes we're told are \\"wide shut\\". Whatever message about sex is actually there is rather nihilistic, rather than moralistic as some seem wanting it to be. No one in the film is seen achieving substantial satisfaction from sex. The couple seeking marital bliss find it exceedingly elusive. The privileged filthy-rich, who can seek satisfaction through ritualistic orgies, find no more visible fulfillment. The family where father pimps for daughter seems no more or less fulfilled than anybody else. It all seems to say that sexual satisfaction is as ephemeral and elusive as anything could be, no matter what your station in life or how you can or do seek that satisfaction. What I'm gueseing the movie is really all about is class stratification and privilege. The two classes highlighted here are what I'll call the merely rich and the filthy rich. The main character discovers the limits placed on his privilege by being in the former of those two rather than the latter. Seen that way, the most telling line in the movie is when he's told what gave him away as not belonging at the clandestine orgy - he arrived in a taxicab rather than a limo. That's how impertinent he's told he is as a merely rich person trying to intrude on the domain of the filthy rich. Whether we're in either of those classes or one lower still, our privileges certainly differ. But the happiness they bring us may not differ so much, if this movie has anything relevant to say about the matter.
B000056MOD|2.0|I have decided to rate all four movies here as well as the series because the only way to even begin to explain this mess is to try and connect the dots. Spoilers are in the summaries.<br />HIGHLANDER: Great original story with a beginning and an ending. Immortals appear to originate from a mystical or religious beginning. It is never fully explained which is nice. Each viewer can use their belief system to fill in the gaps. The Kurgon was an original over the top villain. Excellent and beautiful filming of Scotland. This film never felt as though it were shot on a stage. Awesome sound track by Queen. Once Connor won the Prize the viewer was left to draw his/her own conclusions as to how he would use the Prize to better the world. All in all this film was about as close to perfect as one is likely to get in the SciFi/Fantasy world.<br />HIGHLANDER 2:...Gone is the mystical religious origin of immortals. Now they are either aliens from another planet or immortals that can use science to travel through time, depending on which version of this film you watch. Gone is the beautiful scenery and in comes the BATMAN THE MOVIE type sets. General Katana is an unoriginal rip off of Kurgon. The wife Connor married at the end of the first movie dies of a plague. For the second time Connor wins the Prize and in doing so changes the premise of the story from \\"there can be only one\\" to \\"there will always be at least one more.\\" This film reused the first movies sound track and it didn't fit the film. Basically, this movie was as bad as the first one was good.<br />HIGHLANDER-The Series: I only caught the show occasionally. It further destroys the the concept of the original movie. However if you can somehow not compare it to the first movie it it was a good tv show. The series premier had another Kurgon...villain, Quince, but the following episodes had more original and diverse villains. In my opinion Duncan MacLeod was a pale...of Conor MacLeod. I follow the movies more than the series but as I understand it if you follow the series H-4 will make more sense.<br />HIGHLANDER 3: An obvious attempt to eradicate the damage done by H-2 to the highlander story line. However, once again there is a Kurgon rip off for a villain. Kane is an over the top evil immortal that offers nothing new. This film tries to bring back the mystical and religious feel to the film and somewhat succeeds. Connor's wife from the end of the first film now dies in a car accident. It is never explained how she returned from the dead to die from the plague in H-2. Connor has an adopted son that is never mentioned in H-4. Connor goes through another love interest. For someone who in the original movie did not like getting into relationships with mortals, Connor gets more women than James West or Captain Kirk. On the plus side Loreena Mckennitt's song BONNY PORTMORE is put to good use in this film. All in all a good attempt at restoring the story line but it fails.<br />HIGHLANDER 4: The final nail in the coffin. A lame villain who is less menacing than any of the other film villains leaves Connor no choice other than to have Duncan kill him and then Duncan with Connor's \\"spirit\\" can beat this villain. Hogwash!! In H-3 Connor acquired the ability to cast illusions. In H-4 he evidently decides not to use this ability. Duncan now takes over as the only Highlander left to carry the franchise. This may have been a good call. Lambert, although only 2 years older than Paul looks 10 years older. I don't think he could keep portraying an immortal. Anyway, this film is all over the place. It brings back people and places from other movies and the tv shows and ultimately ends up one big contrived mess. Do these writers have a clue as to what made the original movie work? I think noteries but as I understand it if you follow the series H-4 will make more sense.<br />HIGHLANDER 3: An obvious attempt to eradicate the damage done by H-2 to the highlander story line.

B00005T343|3.0|Hannibal Lecter, brilliant, cultured, and murderous, is back, some ten years after his escape as depicted in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\". He's an extraordinary creation, and beautifully acted by Anthony Hopkins in a way that is at once mannered and melodramatic, and yet curiously detached and unruffled in his calm and implacable progress through life.<br />The original film was a much more straightforward and realistic thriller than this offering, despite its delving into the darker side of the distorted human psyche.  There was in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" a series of crimes, a disturbed criminal, and the forces of law and order racing against time to rescue his lastest voctim with the  reluctant \\"aid\\" - if you can call it that -  and advice of an enigmatic  murderer (the cannibalistic Dr Lecter) who is himself incarcerated in a grim hospital for the criminally insane. But although we might be astonished at the  depiction of  mental abnormality provided , basically the story is a credible manhunt :with remarkable little gore and violence actually shown on screen, despite the nature of the subject.<br />But  \\"Hannibal\\" is quite different; much darker, and dreamlike. In fact  - lets face it, - the plot is really rather unbelievable and  does not bear close rational examination at all. Basically  Lecter is now enjoying his freedom under an assumed name, as  a cultured intellectual in Florence.  But he is still being hunted, by the tough and able FBI agent Clarice Starling (now acted by Julianne Moore, who took over the role very convincingly from Jodie Foster) ;  by an Italian police chief who is privately after the huge reward offered for Lecter's capture; and by the twisted and disfigured Mason Verger, (played by a totally unrecognisable Gary Oldman) who, as the only surviving victim of  Lecter's former life, is planning a grisly and over-the-top kind of revenge.  How Lecter has managed to create his new life, convince others of his new identity, and apparently enjoy a limitless income are questions that are not really answered at all.  Nor should we look too intently at other aspects of the plot; they might also turn out to be rather ludicrous. But then, we presumably are not watching this film as a piece of logical and realistic storytelling, are we?<br />And that leads us to a rather disturbing question: Just why are we watchiing it?  It's really a ludicrous story, and it does  not give us any  real insights into the natiure of humanity, or even  the nature of abnormal psychology (although I understand the author, Thomas Harris, has  an expert knowledge of  the weirder aspects of the serial killer's mind. I myself cannot tell  how accurate his portrayals are). We are forced, I think, to admit we are watching  this film because of its sensarionalism,  well-publicised gruesome violence, its gore, its grotesque images. And these are there in plenty ....especially the murder of the police chief (boy, do you feel that in your gut!) and the infamous supper scene....and if you really don't yet  know the details of Dr Lecter's unusual culinary creation, I wont spoil the story for you here!).<br />No, iwatching this film actually shows  that many of us, the audience, have suspiciously voyeuristic tendencies with regard to pain and bloodshed.  Well, thats hardly a surprise. But for all that , the film is well-made,  although it lacks the black humour that can be found in the original book (especially at the end; the surreal and dreamlike finale to the book has been changed to a  simplistic and rather unpleasant scene involving Lecter escaping yet again alone.) Certainly the depiction of Lecter as cultured and highly intelligent is striking; we even realise his choice of victim is in a distorted way, \\"ethical\\" by his standards, although we learn nothing in the film of his horrific chilldhood, which in the book suggests how his mental disorder originated. <br />To sum up, this film may have a glossy and artistic appearence, but underneath isreally  a reasonably simplistic horror film, with some startlingly nasty effects, and a lot of gore. Its actual story - and probably the motives of its makers - do not bear close examination, but it is certainly a good example of its genre, and if you are not looking for intellectual  stimulation, and have a strong stomach. it works well.<br />As a final note, I feel that the film's musical score, subdued and classical in style, adds to its dark and dreamlike atmosphere.  In places there is such contrast between what we hear and the images we  see that  the effect is both startling and memorable. In particular the score uses extracts from Glenn Gould's later recording of Bach's Goldberg Variations:  Gould's version , in my opinion, represents  some of the most sublime music ever recorded, and  its effect, contrasted with the grotesque visual imagery  onscreen is to make you shiver. Well,  causing shivers is, I suppose, one of the reasons this film was made. I certainly will never again be able to listen to  the slow and sombre Variation 25 whilst eating my supper! and I would guess that the gentle Mr Gould, were he still alive, would be horrified by the use of his music in this way. Still, it's effective.
0793518326|4.0|WORTH THE PRICE? YES! PERFECT? NO.<br /> - But still a very commendable attempt to score the Beatle's music.  Considering that this book was written in 1989, you would have to assume that most of the work was accomplished using only the sharpest of musical ears and an old 33-1/3 vinyl record-player.  The sheer volume of the book (1100 pages) suggests that years of work and preparation were involved.<br />The bad news is that there are mistakes here, so even though the scores appear to be hand-written, there are what we call \\"typos\\".  For example:  The ending of \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" is missing (Can you take me back weary people...).  Also, if a song is written in \\"repeat\\" mode, you only get the guitar/bass notes for the first time around.  Finally, the transcribers took the liberty to just \\"guess\\" what the notes were (such as the orchestral crescendo in \\"A Day in the Life\\", but that was an impossible task anyway).<br />The good news is this book contains the most exhausting note-by-note transcription I have ever seen of any Beatles book.  Infinitely many more notches above the \\"fake-books\\" (which only offer lyrics, a simple piano accompaniment and guitar chords, all in the wrong key).  The guitar solos are there, the horns are there; it even includes the sitars and tablas in the George Harrisons compositions...  Hell, they even score Ringo's drums!<br />The great news is that the book is so close to perfect, it has achieved \\"nik-pick\\" status.  In other words, the only ones that complain are the perfectionists (like myself); even though we know way deep down inside that there is no way to score the backward sound-effects in \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\".<br />The format is a little strange.  Staves are almost always reserved for vocals, guitars, bass and drums (which works for most songs), even though they are not used sometimes (leaving pages and pages of \\"whole rest notes\\" for the contempory songs).  Each page yields an average of 12 measures of music composed on 9 parallel staves.<br />The main reason I bought this book was because I was curious how anyone could ever decipher Revolution 9.  It was an expensive gamble, but I won!  If the book was perfect, I would have awarded it the highest score possible.  If only they would only re-edited it...<br />A job well done by those 4 guys (not John, Paul George & Ringo but instead to the authors; Tetsuya, Yuji, Hajime and Goro)!<br />CMcF
0060977493|4.0|One of the best novels I've read.  Such a profound story-telling and believable plot I had suspected that this is a true story.  It wrenched my heart to read some of the parts - when The God of Small Things was brutalized, and when Estha was parted from Mother.<br />Anyway, the language confused me a lot, probably because of the context and culture I'm not really familiar with.  The story got better as I went along.  Also interesting to read how things are as seen by the twin.  Frank and sometimes funny, but always delightful<br />I read the book twice just to recapture the enjoyment of reading it.

6305508550|4.0|I can think about several different scenes from this movie and just start laughing. It's one of those movies. Mike Judge(King Of The Hill), wrote and directed this hilarious look at the mundane life of office workers. Peter(Ron Livingston) has a boring life. He lives in a plain, by the numbers apartment with an odd neighbor(Diedrich Bader from \\"The Drew Carey Show\\"), and works in front of a computer all day in a small cubicle. It's the same rut day in and day out. He has a smarmy boss with an very slow, annoying way of speech named Bill Lumberg(Played by the awesome Gary Cole). This guy is pricelessly funny. Many points go to Mr. Cole. He also, in a very funny joke, has a friend that works there named Michael Bolton. Don't think there's not many jokes there!. The company then begins to downsize and Peter's two best friends are on that list, while he is to be promoted. The three guys then set out for revenge and devise a plan to launder funds from company accounts. All seems to be golden, when something goes horribly wrong and the guys scramble to find a solution to save their butts!. Jennifer Aniston also co-stars(and looking cute as ever) as Peter's waitress girlfriend. Stephen Root from \\"NewsRadio\\" co-stars as Milton, a highly geeky loser who never gets the attention or respect at work. Like Cole, his comedic performance is incredibly funny. The ending kinda just happens real quickly, and one wishes it was a bit longer and more fleshed out. We've come this far!. The movie has many laugh out loud moments that are both hysterical and oh so true!. Who doesn't hate their job, right?. The film hits the bullseye on that front. It's a shame this intelligent film didn't get the recognition it deserved. It is definitley finding a voice on cable and video. Good. If your looking for a fun little movie that you may of missed, this is the movie for you!. As Bill Lumberg himself might say, ' I want you to see this movie, m'kaaaayyy?. Riiiggghhhttt. Teriffic'. Well said Bill.
B00005LC1H|5.0|I already have a previous edition of Fawlty Towers which I really enjoyed. I bought this remastered edition because it was reasonably priced. While I had two versions, I compared them, I did not see too much of piture quality improvement in new remastered edition, subtitles were much easier to read in previous edition. So, thre is not much motivation to go for the new remastered edition, whichever the price is right, go for it. This is the great show, British comedies at its best.

It's filled with 7 common-sense principles for attaining your goals and being happy. All the principles presented are profound yet simple - some more practical than others. All are concepts most of us already believe in but don't know exactly how to express. This book clears it up. If you're going to buy just one Deepak Chopra book, let this be the one. I also highly recommend &quot;Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Book of Eastern Wisdom&quot; by Taro Gold which is a collection of hundreds of thoughts from Eastern wisdom. &quot;Open Your Mind, Open Your Life&quot; and &quot;The Seven Spiritual Laws&quot; are my two favorite books of wisdom of all time.

6304936362|3.0|If you can penetrate (like a B-17 cutting through cloud cover) all the character cliches and a certain old-fashioned hokey aura, you'll find a harrowing depiction of daylight bombing, circa 1943. What you won't find is an accurate account of the real Memphis Belle's 25th mission, or anyone resembling the actual men who flew her that day.<BR><br />Matthew Modine captains this fictionalized crew, with support from resentful co-pilot Tate Donovan, dishonest bombadier Billy Zane, panicked navigator D.B. Sweeney and wiseacre belly gunner Sean Astin. Tailgunner Harry Connick, Jr. gets to display his vocals and piano skills in a musical number, dedicated to waistgunner Eric Stoltz, that stalls the film in the early going.<BR><br />While the real Memphis Belle experienced a somewhat less dramatic run to a different target, this film's mission is to depict the aerial terrors of that year in Europe, when American airmen suffered more losses than any other branch of our armed forces. Direct hit! Massive B-17 formations thunder across the sky, flak rips planes apart, and in one chilling moment, an enemy fighter slices one bomber in half, and our heroes hear the panicked screams of its doomed crew over the radio.<BR><br />The battle scenes are horrific, and the character scenes are just horrible. It's not that the acting is of poor quality; it isn't. It's that each crewmember faces some sort of hackneyed personal crisis and comes through in true cliched fashion, which somewhat cheapens what the real crew experienced. It's literally one thing after another, a bombing run as group therapy. The film relies exclusively on stock Hollywood types, rather than human beings. Plus, Sweeney's fearful character does a disservice to the real Belle's navigator. Modine comes off best, with his youthful appearance and dedication, as he admonishes his crew not to shout their targets over the intercom. John Lithgow has the thankless task of portraying the coldblooded PR officer who's more concerned with publicity tours than the men's welfare, or their mission's stategic/tactical importance. <BR><br />Despite its failings as a \\"true\\" story, this is a film worth watching. Not until \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" would a film surpass \\"Belle's\\" depiction of nerve-wracking combat.
B00000IMYA|5.0|It would be rather easy to attack the original Columbia &quot;Ellington At Newport&quot; albums, especially for those of us who grew up listening to studio renditions of the concert selections and added crowd reactions (did Columia think us too unsophisticated to appreciate the original concert?)  However, with the 1999 release of this 2-CD package, for me at least, all is forgiven. This package of the nearly complete Newport Jazz Festival, 1956, must be considered among the greatest examples of not only Ellington on disc but of any stage band of any era. This is arguably the definative &quot;live&quot; concert big band, alas, now virtually something gone with the wind. Duke Ellington needs no introduction and certainly no recommendations or praise from me. The Second Edition of &quot;Groves Music Encyclopedia&quot; noted that Duke was a combination of the music of Shubert and Gershwin.  Ellington stands alone among Amerian composers in that he wrote and performed sublime music from jazz, to opera, to sacred, to ballet, to...you name it.This two CD Box set must be considered an essential addition to not only any serious jazz collection but to any collection with jazz contained therein. First, we have the incredible Ellington band of the mid-fifties, featuring such legends as Johnny Hodges (alto), Clark Terry, Cat Anderson (trumpets), Harry Carney( THE baritone sax), Jimmy Hamilton (clarinet), Russell Procopej (alto &amp; clarinet) and one of the most marvelous orchestras in history. Several of the essential Ellington compositions are presented, from Harry Carney's legendary solo on &quot;Sophisticated Lady,&quot; to the incomparable Johhny Hodges on &quot;I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good&quot; and &quot;Jeep's Blues&quot; and of course Sam Woodyard's awe inspiring drum work on &quot;Skin Deep.&quot;  Writing about the Duke is difficult as I always find myself running out of or repeating adjectives.Perhaps, however, the most wonderful thing about this set is the remastering to digital stereo.I own several thousand jazz, big band, rock and classical recordings of live concerts.  None...let me repeat that...none, begins to equal the studio work of remastering this concert of great historical jazz importance offers.  As a result the listener is left feeling as if they are actually THERE.  Precious few &quot;live&quot; albums have achieved the degree of &quot;a-live-ness&quot; that &quot;Ellington at Newport&quot; offers.I&quot;ve listened to the original releases since a teenager in 1956 and say, advisedly, that I&quot;ve never heard this concert before.  It is a rare thing, indeed, to honestly say that any recording is as good as having been there. This comes as close as possible with today's technology.  Therefore, I feel quite confident in saying that this is a seminal and essential recording.This concert will still be listened to...talked about...analyzed...and studied five hundred years from today.This is an album for which you may gather the family in front of the stereo, with popcorn, drinks, etc., and listen together. Listening to &quot;Ellington At Newport&quot; is not like listening to any other concert CD, wherein you might start with your favorite track and randomly move about the disc.  Listening to this straight through, from start to finish, is an experience.  A night at the opera. At the theatre, or the movies.  It transcends being just &quot;another CD of jazz.&quot;  This collection has a life of its own. This is serious music and if you're new to jazz, or a long-time fan such as myself, this CD set will keep pulling you back again, and again, and again,..Joe M. HayesDel Mar, CAFebruary 28, 2002

I can only recommend you buying all 4 Pixies' albums. &quot;Surfer Rosa/Come On Pilgrim&quot; is ruffer, &quot;Doolittle&quot; is very direct, &quot;Bossanova&quot; is a beautiful odissey, and &quot;Trompe Le Monde&quot; is rockin'!. The songs in &quot;Doolittle&quot; can be as funky as &quot;Nr. 13 Baby&quot; or &quot;There Goes My Gun&quot;, as moving as &quot;Hey&quot;, as poppy as &quot;Debaser&quot; or &quot;Mr Grieves&quot;, as intense as &quot;I Bleed&quot; and &quot;Gouge Away&quot; or as kickin' as &quot;Crackity Jones&quot;.

B000001Y79|4.0|I bought this album waaaaaaaaaaaay back in 1996 when I was still a college student and it quickly became one of my favorite CDs ever.  The style goes from bouncy quick ska-punk (Sunday Morning) to cute gimmick song (Just A Girl) to mature wistfulness (Don't Speak) and all the way back again.  No Doubt are certainly talented artists.  I had the privilege of seeing No Doubt play live at RockFest in Texas in 1997 and I was absolutely blown away.  They aren't one of those canned studio acts that sound [bad] live....they really rock.
0871137380|4.0|A very detailed account of one of the worst military blunders. If not for the training of our soldiers it might have been much worse. There were very interesting exchanges between the very mysterious Delta Force (D-Boys) and Task Force Ranger. In the heat of battle, Delta will not take orders from anyone. See how the Rangers were vulnerable by not taking night vision goggles, some body armor plates, and bayonets for the sake of reducing the weight. After all, the mission should only take an hour!<BR>After reading the book, I've learned that although Rangers are considered &quot;Special Forces&quot;, Delta and Seals are definitely a notch or two above. Mark Bowden stated, &quot;It was as if the Rangers saw the D-boys as their big brothers, and since their big brothers were around, everything would be okay.&quot; Two brave Delta operators went in to protect the survivors of a downed Black Hawk only to be overrun by a Somali mob. Even the operators that made it back to base, without hesitating, reloaded their weapons ready to go back out in the streets. &quot;We still have men out there&quot;!
B00005214X|4.0|Sorry to disagree with many of you, but I just can't rate this CD set 5 stars, and I'll tell you why.  But first, I can definitely agree that it seems to be George Harrison's most inspired and creative work by far.  There are perhaps more great songs on this set than all his others combined!!  But who the heck releases a triple album?  George Harrison apparently.  I guess he couldn't wait to record all the songs he wrote while with the Beatles which John and Paul didn't allow him to use!  Judging from his later works, he would have been better suited to save a few.<br />There are some wonderful gems on this CD: Nearly every song on CD#1 is great.  My favorites include My Sweet Lord, Wah Wah, Isn't it a pity, What is life (contains massive &quot;wall of sound&quot; courtesy of Phil Spector), If not for you (excellent Dylan cover which my wife informed me was also recorded by Olivia Newton John), Let it down, Behind that locked door.  The 2000 version of My Sweet Lord takes some getting used to, but will grow on you.  Some of his songs have a country flavor to them: If not for you, Behind..door, and Sir Frankie Crisp have that slide guitar and &quot;country twang&quot; flavor.<br />OK, here's where I disagree: CD#2 tails off considerably from CD#1.  Most of the songs sound tired and banal after listening to  the first four album sides on CD#1.  Only Beware of Darkness, the title track, Apple Scruffs, and Frankie Crisp show the zest and vibrance from CD#1.  The instrumentals, while well performed by one of the best jam bands ever: George, Billy Preston, Eric Claption, are overlong and pointless!  Sorry.<br />Don't get me wrong: this is still a worthwhile buy.  I was sad to see George leave us late last year but luckily he had just enough time to complete the remastering, re-record MSL and completely makeover the cover art.  If you buy just one GH CD, this is certainly the one!
B00005JKDR|5.0|Pixar does it again.  The people responsible for Toy Story, Toy Story 2 & A Bug's Life.  I've enjoyed all off them and Monsters Inc. is no exception.

This is a must see fun movie for the whole family.  This will be a must get on DVD when it comes out.  If you like full length animation at all you owe it to yourself to see this movie.
B00005RFAI|3.0|To make sure things are clear from the start: 3,5 stars are a positive rating from me. I have been taken by surprise by this album, I must say. I only knew some of Pink's singles (\\"There you go\\", \\"Some girls\\", \\"You make me sick\\" from her first album, and of course \\"Get the party started\\") and if I found them entertaining, it was not material I would buy an entire album for. <br />I gave a listen to this album out of curiosity at my local record store and what I heard surprised me so much I bought it. I am enjoying the more pop rock oriented turn she took with \\"18 Wheeler\\", \\"Numb\\", \\"Just like a pill\\", \\"Don't let me get me\\", some of my favourite tracks on the album. \\"Eventually\\" and \\"Family Portrait\\" are good r'n'b tracks I also enjoy.<br />The ballads \\"Dear Diary\\" and \\"Lonely Girl\\" (nice combination with Linda Perry's voice) are not bad at all. \\"Misery\\" is a little too sugary for my taste, but if you like the recent ballads by Aerosmith you'll love it. Steven Tyler is true to himself and Pink's voice matches his quite good actually. If you liked the first single, you will also like \\"Respect\\" and \\"Catch 22\\". \\"Gone to California\\" is a slow atmospheric song, I like the saxophone break. \\"My Vietnam\\" lyrics sound very personal and mature. <BR> <br />This was a clever move from Pink, which should keep her fans happy and gain her some interest from non TRL listeners.

B000059RL3|5.0|The 1971 release of \\"What's Going On\\" surveyed an era's social and political issues with a depth that kept the songs from turning into anachronistic time capsules. Gaye's view of his times, and the clarity and fluency with which he expressed himself is as moving today as when originally unleashed. The personal nature of the subject matter and the album-length form represented a leap of artistic freedom for Mavin Gaye, and the breaking of a creative dam at Motown.<br />Shaking off his label's steady diet of singles-oriented productions, Gaye authored a set of songs whose conceptual conceit stretched over an entire album. Gaye's view of cultural politics, and especially the Vietnam war, are couched in the person of his brother, recently returned from service. As pictured by the returning veteran the USA circa the early '70s was not such a pretty sight.<br />In addition to the far-reaching lyrics, the music represented a new dimension for Gaye and Motown. While there are hits singles (\\"What's Going On\\" \\"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)\\" \\"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)\\"), they blend smoothly into the album's overall panorama. Gaye's multitracked singing, providing harmonies and counterpoints, forms songs that are essentially conversations.<br />David Van DePitte's arrangements layered strings on Latin percussion, horns, flute and the usual guitar, bass and drums, employing elements of soul, jazz and funk. Similar blends can be found in contemporaneous work by Isaac Hayes, but the unusual recording and editing process of this album created a superbly fluid result. By stitching the tracks together and overdubbing the album as a whole, an especially holistic effect was created. A scant ten days of recording resulted in the original \\"Detroit Mix.\\"<br />Before public release, Gaye rethought the album and completely remixed it in Los Angeles. While the original form would have made a worthy release, the coherency brought by the choices and overdubs of the final mix are truly compelling. In particular, the multitracked vocals of the final mix find a smoother, more organic balance, creating their effect without announcing themselves. Disc one contains both the final and \\"Detroit\\" mixes.<br />Disc two includes Gaye's long-delayed return to the stage (four years in the making). The recording documents a 1972 performance at New York's Kennedy Center, and combines a lengthy medley of Gaye's `60s sides with a slightly jumbled performance of \\"What's Going On.\\" The medley, which could have been little more than a dutiful tour of hits turned deeper when filtered through Gaye's new found musical sensibility. \\"I Heard it Through the Grapevine\\" found a new groove from the expanded percussion accompaniment and looser vocal, while \\"Pride and Joy\\" and \\"Stubborn Kind of Fellow\\" turned from pop to blues.<br />The first-ever live performance of the \\"What's Going On\\" album shows how deeply the album's music ran in Gaye's soul. While not a carbon copy of the studio recordings, the importance of the songs to their author (and the audience), as well as the conversational musical flow, made a success of the unpolished performance. Gaye's accidental start near the end of the album brought him looping back around to the beginning (leaving out \\"Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)\\" in the process). After completing the song cycle, the chagrined Gaye repeated two tracks by audience request (\\"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)\\" and \\"What's Going On\\").<br />The mono concert tapes are quite crisp, and despite a few jumpy edits, give a good sense of the impact this show had on both its performer and audience. Disc two closes with original single versions of \\"What's Going On,\\" \\"God is Love\\" and \\"Sad Tomorrows,\\" and an improvised-in-the-studio track, \\"Head Title,\\" that would reappear in finished form as \\"Distant Lover\\" on the \\"Let's Get it On\\" LP.<br />Motown's double gatefold packaging includes an introduction from Smokey Robinson, new liner notes from Ben Edmonds and Harry Weingar, numerous photos, complete lyrics and extensively detailed credits. Those unfamiliar with the original album will find Motown's single-CD remastered edition an absorbing (and less costly) place to start.

B0000025JT|5.0|Guilty is an absolutely incredible album. The idea of Barbra working with Barry Gibb was pure genius and I would like to thank who ever thought of it!! Barbra's vocal is brilliant throughout the album, and the duets (&quot;Guilty and &quot;What Kind of Fool&quot;) are breathtaking. Barry Gibb is brilliant in using his voice to compliment Barbra's. Instead of trying to out perform her, Barry lifted her up and the outcome is awesome. I would like to take the opportunity right now to clarify any thoughts about Barry Gibb not having anything to do on the album, or anything about his lyrics being stupid or meaningless. There's a creative poetry in the lyrics in all the songs on the album that could only come from the creative genius that is Barry Gibb and his brothers. And anyone who thinks otherwise is clearly jealous because they obviously don't have and don't understand the kind of brilliant mind that Barry has. I think it should also be said that not many people are of the opinion that Barry didn't have much to do with the album, being since this is Mrs. Streisand's best selling album to date! My favorite songs off of the album, other than the duets, are &quot;Woman in Love&quot;, &quot;Promises&quot;, and &quot;Run Wild&quot;. This is by far Barbra's best album.
B00004XOWM|2.0|This CD is a disgrace. It seems like Limp Bizkit is getting worse each CD. Anyways, why does he have to swear every 5 seconds? I just can't wait till their next one comes out!!! Fred Durst has at least some good in him. He produced groups like Puddle of Mudd and Staind. They're both way better than he is!! I gave this 2 stars because I like My Generation a bit. To all the people out there, please don't waste your money on this!! In 20 years no one will have heard of him unless he's in jail for something.
0792842723|4.0|Bond has been away from the big screen for 6 years before this movie, and now he's back, and he's great! This movie is more like 4-and-a-half stars...I didn't want to give it 5 stars, because it's not as good as &quot;Goldfinger,&quot; but I don't think anything ever will be, so this is a close, VERY close second. Pierce Brosnan is great as 007, I can't figure out why they didn't get him sooner, they could've gotten him, instead they got Dalton, who in my opinion, didn't make a good James Bond at all. This movie has a great opening sequence, which serves as a primer for the great action to come. Sean Bean is great as 006, Onatopp's character is good, as well as Natalya Simonova's. This movie has a great plot as well, I don't want to give it away, because there are a lot of surprises. So, in conclusion, this is a great movie, and a renaissance for the james Bond series,... BUY THIS MOVIE!!
0195067142|5.0|Frequently I am disappointed by things that are given glowing recommendations and then fail to live up to the hype.  This book, however, not only lived up to the rave reviews, it went far beyond anything I had expected.  I can honestly say that With the Old Breed is the BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ.<br />I am fortunate that I have never had to face anything even mildly resembling what Dr. Sledge suffered through while serving his country.  I have read much military history, but this book slaps you in the face and punches you in the gut with its stark realism and brutal honesty.  We all know that warfare is messy business and that infantry combat tries even the toughest soldiers, but this book shows the physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual struggles of the riflemen for what they are---fatal for many, crippling for most, and approaching the unendurable for all.<br />I simply cannot comprehend the fear, suffering, exhaustion, hunger, thirst, wounds, and death that the soldiers and civilians of the WWII generation (of all nationalities) lived through.  Our modern world truly owes them well more than we acknowledge.  I am grateful to Dr. Sledge for enduring the unendurable, and for passing on to us his experiences, so that we can try to stop the same kinds of things from happening again.

B000050FEN|4.0|This movie is definitely fun to watch, and is a visual experience. The director did a superb job envisioning the carnage left by a very, very disturbed man.<BR>The movie's main characters are cops played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt, the former being a grizzled pro on the verge or retirement, the latter being a young detective recently transferred to homicide. Both roles are played well. But the fun of the movie lies in the gory scenes, which are well-designed and original, and following the cops from one scene to the next, just a little too late, a tad too slow to stop the criminal.<BR>The movie is punctuated by a short, but sweet, performance by Kevin Spacey and an ending with definite punch.<BR>All in all a fun movie. A star was deducted because this is no &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot;, though still a very good movie.
B00005Y228|5.0|Where are they now?  I guess that was the question for any fan of pop music when asked about Kylie Minogue and her one U.S. hit from the 1980's, a remake of \\"Locomotion\\".  Well, little did we in the United States know, but Australia's Minogue has been carving out quite a career for herself both in her native land and in Europe...achieving a level of stardom on par with our own Middle American girl made good, Madonna.  Well, Kylie is back on our radar screens and I for one feel cheated that we've been denied her all these years here in the States. \\"Fever\\", her eighth album release, finds her literally setting the world on fire with what I think is one of the best dance/pop albums ever.  The throbbing, irresistible first single, \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" (with it's equally fantastic video) began the buzz on this project and for once, the buzz is worthy.  An energetic, melodic, hook-laden,...shaking, roof-raising masterpiece of dancefloor ditties, \\"Fever\\" is full throttle.  It takes it's cues from the very best of Donna Summer, Kraftwerk, \\"disco-era\\" Diana Ross, Chicago House music and even some early 80's funk (see the bonus track, \\"Boy\\") for a record that starts strong and doesn't let up until the last song is done.  Nothing here would have sounded out of place at New York's famed Paradise Garage.  This is music that's fun and sexy and will have you singing along to every track.  And that's the REAL feat here...not one weak track!  Truly amazing in this day of one hit/all filler.  Another nice touch is that most of the songs clock in at the 2:00 to 3:00 minute mark.  None of this rambling and droning on and on ad nauseam like so many songs we're subjected to, truly leaving you wanting \\"More, More, More\\" (the fabulous track that opens the album).  If you are a fan of dance/pop...run, don't walk, and pick up \\"Fever\\".  You will not be disappointed.  It's an instant classic of the genre.
B00005QATY|4.0|What a wonderful surprise O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU is. I had little interest in seeing the film--the marketing was bland, to say the least--but am now completely obsessed with it.<br />There are a few awkward moments in the film, including virtually all of the Pretty Boy Floyd stuff, but the performances of Clooney, turturro and Nelson more than make up for those small problems. Clooney, in particular, is wonderful from start to finish.
B00004U8H4|4.0|Considering how wrong any adaptation of Ellis' notorious book could have gone, Mary Harmon has fashioned a rompin'-stompin' good film, and was smart and fortunate enough to cast Christian Bale in the lead. Tongue-in-cheek production design and music supervision add to the vicious lunacy exploding from almost every frame. Of course, no one could have expected less from her after \\"I Shot Andy Warhol,\\" another great time at the movies that tossed darts at a bygone era.<br />The film will have most appeal to folks who had to suffer these monstrous urban characters in the 80s and 90s - foul yuppies with little more than status and oneupmanship on their festering minds - so the biting satire will be lost on its targets who, likely, continue to live in abject denial of their past tawdriness. <br />The \\"business card scene\\" rates as classic, the over-the-top chainsaw chase comes close, and Bale swooning over the cultural contributions of Whitney Houston and Phil Collins as he hacks his way through the mediocrity of his own mind is just delicious.<br />One just wishes Lions Gate had not gone for the jugular with its tacky cover art. It's like pasting a Golan-Globus Cannon Films sensibility on top of an art film in order to hawk it to the Great Mass it sees as proles. Typical self-serving Hollywood arrogance offered up by folks who only read reviews and then pass them off as their own opinions.
0875428940|5.0|Absolutely stunning deck, with beautiful images and easy to read imagery. Traditional enough for readers who have used other decks, yet original enough to really stand out. I own several decks, but this is the one I read when I really want to know.
0783223218|4.0|If you want to see Willis in a role other than the good guy this one is a keeper. He plays an asassin called the Jackal. It's a remake of the orginal film called &quot;Day of the Jackal&quot;..It has Richard Gere in a role that is normally played by a guy like Willis. It is my guess that they offered Willis the Gere role and he wanted a challange this time. He wanted to play the villian.  He pulls it off in this one. Perhaps he might have the chance to play one again. It seems like he makes at least a half dozen movies per year.
B00001QEBQ|1.0|This is not what Mulan is like!  Read it from a real Chinese standpoint and you will note the difference.  Why has Disney forced their views on a Chinese one?  They should leave my culture alone.  They know this isn't the real Mulan and I know they don't care.  Otherwise, they would have taken some ethnic responisiblities!
6305013578|1.0|Whatever you do, don't buy this DVD edition. With a running time of 115 min this version is - as are all versions out there on the market, incl. the Moroder version - ridiculously short. The film museum Munich has restored the film as close to the original as you can get with the surviving material and has ended up with a version that runs somewhere around 140min (!). Great care has been taken in improving the image quality (contrast, etc.), only the best material was used. This version was shown at the Berlin film festival 2001 with a new score by Bernd Schultheiss.<br />If you want Metropolis on DVD you should wait a few more months. The film is due for release this year and will probably contain the new Schultheiss score, as well as the original Huppertz score. You'll also have the opportunity to view Metropolis in an accurate projection speed with the best possible film-to-DVD transfer.<br />This DVD version will definitely be released in Germany (for those of you with a code-free player) in 2002. Don't go for less. Any other version on the market is as truthful to this classic as The Fifth Element.
B00003CWTH|5.0|This is a film about the always incomprehensible human condition.  It shows what we do to ourselves and to each other for the sake of love, money, fame, or fear.  In this film, people from all walks of life break down and come face-to-face with their own personal fears and demons, despite the armor they've erected for themselves.  All of the characters are dragged through hell before the rays of hope begin to emerge before the unexpected storm at the movie's climax.  The film's script was written inspired by lyrics written by Aimee Mann who provides the film's poignant soundtrack.  The songs are excellent on their own, but married to the movie's sweep and imagery, it's nothing less than a suicide watch for these poor folks.  But the human condition, although puzzling at times, proves resilient.  There isn't a clean-cut Hollywood happy ending...but there is forgiveness, redemption, compassion, and hope.  That's all that any ONE of us can hope for as make our own way through life.

I'm not usually one to read books, so when I find one, it had really better keep my attention, or it'll be back on the shelf pretty quick.

B00005Y228|5.0|The former Aussie soap star is back after a 14 year-hiatus. Miss Minogue last charted with a #3 hit Locomotion in 1988 when she was under the stewardship of the famous Stock-Aitken-Waterman. 2 other minor hits followed off her debut and ever since, she had no US success until now. Her 90's album are generally solid with the acclaimed Impossible Princess and Light Years ignored by the US. Light Years returned Minogue to dancefloor prominence afetr the lackluster performance of two prior albums.<br /><br />There's never a dull moment on Fever besides the global hit Can't Get You Out. It's pure pop fun on Fever cos despite coming from the Stock-Aitken-Waterman home, Kylie ain't ashamed and in fact, each of her songs borrows some elements of that retro-vibe, and reworks them cleverly into songs that are ultra-sleek and stylish. Songs that reverberate in ur head long after the music's gone! Excellent choices are the title track Fever, 2nd single In Your Eyes, Come into My World, Fragile, Love Affair and the wonderful last song Burning Up...

157330087X|5.0|Both guitarists were on an equal plane. Stevie learned from jimmi and countless other blues players few know about. He did things with a guitar few could follow. You can't judge him on this one dvd.  You have to collect all his CDs and see him \\"Austin City Limits\\" to really appreciate his gifted talents. People outside the US and in the US were not exposed to him as much. He was an unknown. He did some guitar work for David Bowie\\"Lets Dance\\"album. David took most of the credit for that record that peaked his career.Few knew stevie  then. He was just getting exposure in the US when he died even though he had been around a long time. A rising star not forgotten!!! pick up a guitar and try to play like him if you can.
0792838068|5.0|This movie captured everything I have felt about my life.  I have totally been obsessed with this movie since I first saw it 4 years ago.  This movie portrays what it is like to lose everything, and to deal with it in a socially unacceptable way.  Nic plays a drunk like no other could have.  Elisabeth is just outstanding.  I have personally revolved my life around the theme of this movie for the past two years....Ben with an N
1587990717|2.0|It's an interesting subject -- the role of chance in the markets -- it's just too bad Taleb was too busy puffing himself up to get to it. He apparently wants to be a cross between Daniel Dennett and Richard Feyman, but he comes off instead like an insecure blowhard -- like some bore of a party guest who won't stop droning. <br />Is there anything useful in the book? Sure, but honestly, it's not worth the effort finding those few nuggets about fat-tailed distributions and volatility inflation. Read John Allen Paulos's innumeracy series; read Peter Bernstein's &quot;Against the Gods&quot;. Hey, even read some books by Dennett and Feynman, if you want. But don't waste your time on this pompous twaddle. Taleb has an insecurity streak you could spot from high-earth orbit -- and it obscures his entire book.
B000058A1G|5.0|Who were The Action? Simply put, The Action were one of the best of the British Mod bands of the 60's, sadly forgotten in favour of The Who, The Yardbirds and Small Faces by music historians.  They were in many ways superior to these bands in terms of their subtlety and deft arrangements of R&amp;B.  The Action, never released a Long Player, and the material here is culled from 45's.  Songs like &quot;Shadows and Reflections&quot; show a stunning grasp of melody and harmony far beyond that of their contemporaries.  Their approach to American R&amp;B is relaxed and natural, listen to &quot;Since I lost my Baby&quot; to get the truly delicate touch these lads had.  But they could also churn out the dance power &quot;I'll Keep On Holding On&quot; is a wonderful marriage of Soul and British Invasion guitars with rock insistance and soulful pleading.  &quot;Wasn't It You&quot; is another stunning track that showcases the bands masterful blending of British-brewed Soul.  Lots of the early 60's British bands (including the Beatles) were heavily influenced by R&amp;B, but no one married the two genres as well and as natrually as The Action. A wonderful collection of songs by a top-notch band.  Someone should really this stateside, maybe dig up some long lost tracks off of the rumoured unreleased LP.  Even as is this compilation is a stunner.
B00003CX8J|3.0|to the reviewer who said this movie was preachy because of the first scene in poland needs to get a grip.same goes to the reviewer who posted at yahoo.com who said nobody cares about the holocauhst.must of been some young white kid in denial.anyways this movie suffers from bad casting.mainly storm,cyclops,and rogue.the actors chosen for them was all wrong.halle berry is my girl but she just doesn't fit the role of storm.maybe,iman,or vanessa williams.and the make up for mystic was a tad bit too much.and wheres the dialogue?.the action was a bit too restrain.and plus not enough x-men.but the movie did do good by making the comic book semi real life issues real.done verry maturly.hopefully the sequel will deal with the sentinels and friends of humanity.now that story will be good real life drama and sci-fi comic book action.
B00005QIPH|2.0|this album is a joke. reviewer courtney hinton hit it rite on. these guys are a cover bad, a novelty act like tenacious d, except the d basks in their novelty fame. i would differ in the opinion that critics embrace this album because of the nostalgia factor. i'm pretty sure most critics have never actually listened to a lou reed, television, iggy pop, stooges album, but they sure know what they sound like.
6304795254|4.0|this disc uses letterboxed for widescreen insted of anamorphic, and some noticiable white spots poping out from time to time. 3 stars for video qulity.
B000000H4V|5.0|Sepultura might not be the best, but they are certainly unique and they are extremely talented.  Their mix of tribal drums, hard riffs, and powerful gutteral vocals makes a production that is both loud and propulsive.  It's not thrash like some previous albums, but if you want thrash you can just turn to Slayer or Metallica.  This is good hard music whether its slow or not and it makes you think about how a lot of people are more unfortunate than us.  The opening song is probably te best.  This album never slows down or loses interest.  One of the best guitar sections ive ever heard is on the last live track.  This is  must buy for any heavy metal fan and is one of the top heavy metal albums of the 90s.

B00004XQ83|5.0|...I was dazzled by the movie, its cinematography, humor, acting, details, and witty script; but most of all, the music, which seemed to have a life of its own.  I wasn't a country music fan, but the music is what I'd call historic Americana, not country in the slick, dishonest style we hear on the radio nowadays.  (For those of us who grew up in the U.S., who has NOT sung \\"You Are My Sunshine\\" as a child?) The music was so evocative and so appropriate to the chain-gang odyssey tale, I went back to see the movie again, just to experience that unique marriage of story and music.  I'm impressed that so many copies of the album have been sold...\\"O Brother\\" has gotten the public recognition it so richly deserves.
B00005N9CV|4.0|As a guy who is just entering the adult phase of his life, (for those of you who don't know it's when you drink coffee regular instead of a &quot;coffee beverage&quot;), this CD was absoultely great. I can't get enough of this sound. I'm no jazz purist, but I know what sounds good to me and describes a moment. This CD does just that. I can't tell you all the titles of the song because all of them just blend to me. It's great for a soft lit occasion, or when the Houston traffic gets too unruly. Not to mention that Ms. Krall certainly has &quot;The look&quot;. This is the first CD I've bought of hers and immediately went out afterwards and bought her others. It's that good to me. Don't let all the &quot;elitist&quot; music experts that have panned this CD get at you. It's the same crowd who got peeved when &quot;their&quot; band when too mainstream for them.
B00004Z459|5.0|Anyone that can honestly say that this album is not worth 150 + stars is not a true street soldier fan.  As an official Street Soldier, I can tell you this is the best album of 2001 and the best rock album for a long while.   The mix of rap/hip-hop, Chester's soulful melodies and screaming, the electronica by Mr.Hahn, Brad & Phoenix's kick... guitar riffs along with Rob's smashing drums makes a perfect group called: Linkin Park.  I have seen them live and they are as good if not better live then they are on a CD.  This CD is personally really good to me because they talk about real issues.  They talk about abuse, past experiences with drug use, thoughts of suicide and other issues that alot of teens go through.  They don't talk about doing drugs every night or getting with the girls backstage like alot of other rappers and rockers do.  They are real.  They are true to their fans.  Linkin Park is on of the best new and REAL groups out in the music scene as of late.  Anyone that just listens to one song with out even knowing the meaning behind the song and actually know the lyrics, and goes in there already planning on stomping the music is not even giving them a fair chance.  If you give them a fair chance you will find your in love with their music.  All the songs relate to stuff that alot of people go through.  Maybe I find their songs more of an inspiration, because the stuff Chester and Mike went through, is the stuff I am going through now.  And if they can get out, maybe I will be able too.  So end result - Linkin Park is great and so is this cd.
B00000IMTF|5.0|This album is, simply put, a powerful, mystical journey. I've been a Dio fan for years. I love Deep Purple as well. You do the math. Ritchie Blackmore is truly a master of his instrument. I've never heard a guitarist that sounded like him. He goes from classically influenced to blues with ease. Stargazer is one of the finest songs in metal/rock history. It's a powerful, sweeping journey, set to expert guitar riffs, masterful keyboard work and drums that challenge anything John Bonham ever played. Rising is worth owning just for that song alone. Every track on this album is outstanding. I highly recommend Rainbow Rising to any Purple / Dio / Whitesnake fan.
B000003N89|3.0|This is only general review on Diana Krall<br />Listening to \\"Boy from Ipenima,\\" I found the big difference on who really has had the feeling of being in love. Rosemary Clooney sings with what she actually experienced, but Krall just imagines the Boy from Ipenima. You may differentiate this clearly on \\"Every girl he passes goes Ahhhh,\\"(and more) please mark the difference between Clooney and Krall saying it (maybe the intention was a dual point of view). Krall suits more for philosophical themes like \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams,\\" where she sings with thoughts not heart. With \\"When I Look in Your Eyes,\\" \\"Frim Fram Sauce,\\" \\" Broadway,\\" \\"A Case of You,\\" \\"My Love,\\" I feel like the texts are too flat. My point is that Krall does not fit to love themes and she should be considering rationalistic themes instead.<br />Conclusion: It is like listening to Jussi Björling singing \\"Recitar!... Vesti La Giubba\\" from Pagliacci, where Placído Domingo sings it with emotions, and like watching Anthony Hopkins acting as Paul in \\"Peter and Paul\\" (1981).<br />Sincerely yours,
B00000DGUG|5.0|Fans didn't really embrace this album, it was viewed as a disapointment in the shadow of JAGGED LITTLE PILL. I personally love this album, as it offers something completely different and unexpected from Alanis. This album is about her spiritual awakening and growth as a person. The songs have a certain rawness and emotion to them which is just captivating. My personal favorite is &quot;That I Would Be Good&quot; which is one of her more endearing songs in my opinion. The songs are written in an intriguing way, they are very interesting, such as &quot;The Couch&quot; which seems to be about a patient under a psychiatrist who is remembering his/her problems. The first single &quot;Thank U&quot; is an excellent song about what Alanis has learned in the years she was gone, and where she's been. &quot;Unsent&quot; offers an interesting take on a song, its a compilation of love letters Alanis never sent. Elsewhere this cd has other shining moments, such as &quot;I Was Hoping&quot;, &quot;So Pure&quot;, &quot;Joining You&quot; and &quot;Sympathetic Character&quot;, although there's not one filler track to be found. So I would suggest if you are adament about this, to just listen to it as it is, and not think of it as the follow up to JLP, this one its own masterpiece.
B00005TT77|4.0|I was eager to buy this soundtrack because it has some of my favorite artists all  on one album.  Im not a big beatles fan but new renditions of them i was excited about.  Well, the result is, some of the songs are great while some are more forgettable. My favorite songs on the album are Rufus' Wainwright's rendition of &quot;across the universe&quot;, he is also one of my favorite artists.  Also, Eddie Vedder's &quot;Hey, You've got to Hide your Love Away&quot;, and Ben Harpers &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;.  Some of the misses are Nick Cave's &quot;Let It Be&quot;.  I was looking forward to this song being sung with more passion but it just sounds like he's singing it with no emotion.  Also, Grandaddy's &quot;Revolution&quot; is a waste.. Oh well its still a good soundtrack.
B00002MZ12|5.0|Alanis UNPLUGGED was a great idea. Its nice to hear her songs in a more laid back approach, with different interpretations. Vocally she sounds up to par and the songs bring new emotion in this environment. The most compelling song here in my opinion is the vocally endearing &quot;That I Would Be Good&quot;. She also gives interesting interpretations of past hits such as the unplugged version of &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, which is just as good, if not better, than the original. As well Alanis introduces some new songs, a cover of the Police song &quot;King of Pain&quot;, and some new songs such as &quot;No Pressure Over Cappuccino&quot;, &quot;These R The Thoughts&quot; and &quot;Princes Familiar&quot;, which are all great songs, worth the price of this album alone. If you are a hardcore Alanis fan, or even a casual one, you wont want to do without this album, its great to hear the songs in this type of setting. Great!
0679459529|3.0|For those who are fans of John Glover, this is worth the price of  admission.  Glover does an outstand job in performing the adaptation for the audio book.
B000002MY3|5.0|Alanis Morissette blew out of the water with this album, which went on to become one of the best selling albums of all time (up there at least). The album features a vocal honesty and rawness, which is rare to find in artists lately. The songs have deep meaning behind their clever lyrics and compelling songwriting. The angst ridden &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; is a tongue in cheek, face up to your responsibilities, kind of song, which is excellent. Its no wonder it became a huge hit. &quot;Head Over Feet&quot; is a really beautiful ballad. &quot;You Learn&quot; is a catchy song about living and learning, all a part of life. Other winners include &quot;All I Really Want&quot;, the tragic &quot;Forgiven&quot;, and the closing &quot;Wake Up&quot;. Overall if you dont have this album, you might want to look into it, it offers a unique experience and insight into a very talented artist.
B000002U6E|5.0|This album is an instant classic. I can only put it in the league of the album &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. This is an album that will still be sold decades from now... As a whole and individually, - every track works, - yet the whole, is so much greater than the individual parts.<br />Its been extensively been used by Holywood movies, starting with Sliver in the early 90s, to recently hearing it in the Matrix. Probably close to a dozen movies have chosen this album in their soundtracks, - simply because, - it is genius.<br />Essentially, you just have to hear this album - and you will buy it. It is a grand symphony of the human soul.
B00005Y228|5.0|This is a fantasic CD.  Kylie has really grown up in her style since her &quot;Locomotion&quot; days.  I would reccomend this CD to anyone.  &quot;Fever&quot; has everything from pop to trance dance.  &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot; is by far the best single.  This is the first time Kylie has released anything in America since the early 90s and she has really out done herself.  Buy &quot;Fever&quot; !
0440213525|2.0|I have been trying to find a good Grisham book all these time and this one disappointed me again. It made a promising start when this 11-year-old Mark gets himself and his brother into lots of trouble by being in the wrong place at the wrong time. As if witnessing a suicide wasn't enough, they tried to stop it and in the midst, learn of a big secret that puts their family's lives in danger. The entire incident sends Mark's brother into shock. It was fast-paced and immediately, we could tell that Mark was established as a witty and smart kid.<br />However, the middle starts to drag along with how he tried to outwit the police, the Mafia etc. The middle section is boring on the whole, but occasionally the wit of Mark gives readers pleasant surprises. Another major character was introduced, Reggie Love, the lawyer of Mark. She is carefully portrayed as a middle-aged, extremely caring lawyer, not only to Mark but to most of her juvenile clients. I feel that Grisham could have reduced the number of antagonists in this part as the names can get confusing if you try to read fast.<br />Towards the end, the story starts to pick up when Love and Mark breaks out of their limits and tries to uncover their secret. I was expecting a much better ending with a satisfactory conclusion as to what really happened but Grisham chose to leave the end as it is. Maybe he wanted to leave room for speculation?<br />On the whole, i am rather disappointed with this story. It is built on a rather weak plot with some parts rather unbelievable. The description is kept to a minimum and it should be an easy read. Only 2 of the character are built up enough and there are simply too many of the small characters. Disappointing... choose other novels if you are able to.
B00003CXXP|1.0|This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen on the big screen. Or, actually, three of the worst movies, because it seemed to be three somewhat irrelevant movies patched together. The first was actually relatively engaging and dark--the Pinnocchio tale of a mechanical boy given to a family to replace a terminally comatose child. Then--Ta-DUM!--the original boy miraculously recovers, and the second movie, an overblown and disturbingly bad story of a runaway on a quest, ensues. And later comes the third. I wouldn't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it (as if I could spoil it !), but let's just say I laughed aloud. A few minutes later, when I realized they really WEREN'T kidding, I became terribly depressed... I would have bailed at that point, if I hadn't been glued to the floor by a year-old puddle of coke. Chewing my leg off to get free wasn't an option, unfortunately, because I'm a vegetarian.<br />Frankly, I can't imagine anything a DVD could add to this flick. Unless...Perhaps there's a track that features Haley Joel Osment, confessing that aliens kidnapped him and sucked him into this project. Or maybe Jude Law, who actually did look like he was enjoying himself up there, laughing all the way to the bank. Or maybe Steven Spielberg...<br />Naw.
B00003CXI0|4.0|Fans of the Harry Potter book series will find \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" an excellent adaption of the book series.<br />Thumbs up to the actors, thumbs up to the special effects, thumbs up to the movie!!!!<br />(Sorry there are no \\"voting buttons\\", but I don't know how to put them in).
B00005ASHM|5.0|This album's reputation precedes it -- I guess it really isn't neccessary for me to talk about how unique the idea of a &quot;concept&quot; album was to the pop/rock world in 1966, or how innovative the arrangements are, or how great the singing is...<br />What strikes me time and again listening to _Pet Sounds_, is the incredible amount of emotion it contains, and the way it's expressed in the music. Consider the ebulliance of &quot;Sloop John B&quot;... or the high lonesome wail heard near the end of &quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot; - are we hearing a theremin, or an incredibly expressive falsetto voice? Amidst all the famous songs and musical phrases that appear in _Pet Sounds_, I personally think the most unforgettable moment is the instrumental break in &quot;Here Today&quot; - it conveys the rollercoaster of emotions far better than the lyrics. It's amazing that something so sophisticated could have appeared in a pop song in 1966. <br />Referring once again to &quot;I Just Wasn't Made For These Times&quot;, one can only wonder whether Brian Wilson was expressing personal angst, or recognizing that &quot;Let's Go Away for a While&quot; wasn't going to be as popular with the record company and Top 40 charts as &quot;Fun, Fun, Fun&quot; had been.<br />It's a testament to the album's emotional weight that Mr. Wilson has on several occasions expressed a preference for the much-mellower _Friends_ as every day listening material, stating that it requires less emotional involvement.<br />too bad &quot;trombone dixie&quot; is no longer included as a bonus track...
B00001QGPR|5.0|Some of the times an album gets drowned out by an artist's former successes.  If an album, from such a performer, does not break new ground it somehow gains less attention than the upstart's albums.  This, my fellow legion of Bowie fans, is simply a spectacular album.  This is David Bowie easing on the cutting edge for a moment to settle into sound song craftsmanship.  How many artists out there can lay claim to so many incredible and unique albums.  In my opinion, Bowie has had ten albums I would call incredible, and this fits into that groove.  Subtlety rules on this album.  A deft hand by both Bowie and Reeves Gabrels has been used on this album to at times fill the empty spaces, and at other times let it flow.  To say that I am impressed by this album would be a grand understatement.  This is a probably not a great starting point for those not initiated into the Bowie craftsmanship, but to those who love him as much as I do...it's great punctuation to the progressive brilliance.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This visually stunning film does something quite interesting, and even refreshing, which hasn't seemed to have cropped up in cinema as of late: Benigni takes the setting of Europe in the grips of World War II, and uses the stark contrast of blind and outrageous hatred against the love and eternally solid bonds of family. This is not a film about the Holocaust, and thankfully so. Benigni does not bother to tackle questions like, \\"Why?\\" or \\"How?\\" but rather eliminates any attempts to be analytical or preachy: the viewers are left feeling redeemed, and more aware of the love they have in their lives. Far too often, movies and texts about the Holocaust seem to engage in a volley of one-upmanship, in a culture bombarded by all varieties of Holocaust literature and film, we have become almost desensitized to the true nature of the event, and even more important, the bigger picture. LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL doesn't attempt to grab at our sympathy for Guido, or question motives, but is a fantastic reminder that the love, bonds, and people in our lives are the most important, and that with their love and caring, even the greatest of evil can be overcome.
B00003CWTI|5.0|What's interesting about \\"Magnolia\\" is the fact that any one of its many stories coild have been an interesting film by itself.  The characters are so well depicted that  you wonder what happens to them after the conclusion (my measure for determining whether a movie has done a good job establishing its characters).  Of course, they all have to share this with each other, in a film that contains some of the most honest and raw outbursts of emotion that I have ever seen in a movie.  Most of its characters have some kind of breakdown or another--the pressures of life are too much too handle, and they turn to drugs, or anger, or whatever, to divert themselves from their problems.  All this makes for some pretty sad people, drifting through life haphhazardly.<BR>Except for Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) and Phil (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who are the most sympathetic characters in the movie.  Phil is a nurse looking after Earle Partridge (Jason Robards), a television producer bedridden with cancer.  Earle's son, Frank Mackey (Tom Cruise) makes chauvinistic infomercials entitled \\"Seduce and Destroy\\".  Frank hates Earle for leaving him and his mother alone when he is a child.  He comes undone in an interview with a journalist who hammers him with intensely personal questions.  Earle's wife, Linda (Julianne Moore), who married him for the money but who now loves him and is hellbent on helping him, takes prescription drugs to ease her pain.  Earle has a show called \\"What do Kids Know\\", hosted by Jimmy Gator (Philip Baker Hall) and which stars a child whizkid, Stanley Spector (Jeremy Blackman).  Jimmy is also suffering from cancer, and is intensely unhappy, as opposed to his cheerful on-air persona (doesn't it seem like all game show hosts are too cheerful?).  His daughter, Cynthia (Felicity Huffman), is on drugs and plays her music way too loud.  The neighbors complain, and Jim comes to check and instantly falls in love with her.  Jim realizes that Cynthia has problems and wants to save her (the theme of salvation is pervasive throughout the film).  And, finally, there is a former star of \\"What Do Kids Know\\" who everybody calls Quiz Kid Donnie Smith (William H. Macy).  He has just been fired from his job in a department store and needs money for braces.  <BR>These are not happy people (for the most part).  The film's writer and director, Paul Thomas Anderson (he of \\"Boogie Nights\\" fame) travels from story to story effortlessy.  All the action takes place in a single day in the San Fernando Valley.  Often events happen at the same time.  There are sequences of the movie where the same musical score plays for almost twenty minutes, while Anderson cuts from story to story-- often, even, from image to image.  <BR>\\"Magnolia\\" is such an ambitious and emotionally brutal film that it's hard not to respect it for trying--even if you disagree with the film's quality.  This was one of the movies released in late 1999 that were more creative and original than anything that had come before.  The movie is one of those love-hate kind of deals.  Most of the hate comes from the last half-hour of the film, in which a downpour of frogs fall from the sky.  You read that right.  That anyone had the audacity to even think of such a development is hard to believe.  It suggests divine intervention in the lives of its players.  What seemed like a human drama has become much more.<BR>The movie is much interested in coincidence and chance--as shown in the prologue, narrated by Ricky Jay (who also shows up in the film), which tells of three very peculiar circumstances throughout the twentieth century.  One of them is shot with an old, hand-cranked, Pathe camera.  Another includes a replay of the scene, complete with markers that are used in football replays which detail the movement of the character.  The strangeness of the introduction prepares us for the shocking conclusion.<BR>I loved this movie--it feels so real and yet is so original and so skillfully navigated that it feels less like a movie than a complete experience, or a journey.  It contains the grand sweep of an epic.  It sees hope at the end--it doesn't relegate its morose characters to their own bleak destinies that they were creating for themselves.  Chance intervened--or maybe even God, the film suggests.  The movie's final message may be just this--stuff happens.
B000002UAR|5.0|Four years removed from the early R & R spirit of \\"She Loves You\\" and \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\", the Fab Four retired from the stresses and strains of constant touring and became a studio band. With the celebrated guidance of Sir George Martin behind the recording console, the Beatles learned to master a new instrument - their imagination. The songwriting genius of Lennon and McCartney is still present (George Harrison begins to show his skill as a songwriter on this album), and now it's buoyed by their exploration and acceptance of varied musical stylings, from classical to Indian to Motown (and eventually help founding both psychedelia and techno), all under Martin's studio wizardry. Some may argue that \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" is perhaps their best, but whereas there's an air of out-datedness in that Summer of Love masterpiece, it's \\"Revolver\\" that remains not only their most listenable and enjoyable work (they all are, really) but perhaps the finest 35 minutes ever collected onto one recording. <BR>The formula's still the same: catchy, memorable, well-constructed songs that focus on each member's strengths. After all, who out there hasn't ever sung along with Ringo Starr on \\"Yellow Submarine\\"? But as the band evolved from their Liverpool and Hamburg club days, they forged the blueprint that expanded the realm of possibilities for rock music, for better or worse. Opening with the hysterically funny \\"Taxman\\", George Harrison's satirical look at the draconianism of the English income tax system, \\"Revolver\\" allows the listener to be a fly on the wall of sorts, being clued into the now-legendary creative process of the Beatles. It also allows us to glimpse into the souls of John Lennon and Paul McCartney as songwriters. Lennon, through such tracks as \\"She Said, She Said\\", \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" and the exceptional \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", explored his growing pre-occupation with isolation, alientation and even death, while McCartney's lyrics on \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\", \\"For No One\\" and the Motown tribute \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\" revealed both the joy and uncertainty of love and relationships. For this songwriting tandem, there are two tracks that truly stand out. McCartney's \\"Eleanor Rigby\\", spectacular in its' Bernard Hermann-esque orchestration, is both devastatingly sad and hopefully redemptive. It's the story of people that get lost in society, and McCartney ponders the question of what we can do for these people. \\"Ah, look at all the lonely people\\", he cries, and with that, you feel his pain of having to bear witness to Eleanor Rigby's sorrow. Lennon's \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" is perhaps the best track on this album, and the one that best reflects the forward-thinking spirit of \\"Revolver\\". Taking its cue from the Tibetan Book of the Dead, Lennon sounds as if he were preaching from a mountaintop, telling us to \\"turn off your mind, relax and float down stream/it is not dying\\". Yes, there is the suggestion of drug use in the song (Lennon began to experiment with LSD at the time), but it's not a celebration of drug use; rather, it explores the possibilities of opening your mind to new ideas, new cultures, new thoughts. The psychedelic nature, pre-Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane, is fostered by the use of ringing sitars, reversed guitar solos, slightly out-of-time sound effects, steady, thumping bass, and, most amazingly, a relentless, pulsating Ringo drum beat. It can even be argued that \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" can even be called the first techno song - the rhythm section of Ringo and Paul bear much resemblance to the drum n' bass heard nowadays by Goldie and Roni Size, for example. Also, listen to the Chemical Brothers' \\"Setting Sun\\", recorded nearly 30 years later, and make your own comparisons. Similar indeed.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|this was the first maiden CD i bought.. i'm sold! IRON MAIDEN RULES! I love songs like \\"the Wicker Man\\" and \\"Ghost of the Navigator\\". But my favorite has to be Dream Of Mirrors! People say it's not traditional maiden. but that's because it really isnt. it's more..well. theatrical..i think .it's really got this grand-esque powerful feel to it. that's a good thing, i'd say. and THREE Guitars! Whoooo! that's good stuff. Mr. Dave Murray, Mr. Janick Gers, and Mr. Adrian Smith are AWESOME Guitarists, each in their own right. But my personal favorite is Dave Murray--I really enjoy his solos and stuff. especially here. <BR>Up The Irons!
B000003S1A|5.0|This one's not your daddy's prog-rock. That's right, it's King Crimson, a band unfairly lumped together with the likes of ELP, Yes, Kansas or any other of those purveyors of 20-minute organ solos and reworkers of classical pieces by composers famous and obscure, you need to listen to this band again. Unlike the above-mentioned bands, King Crimson's defacto leader and guitarist Robert Fripp always kept his band beyond the cutting edge, carefully crafting and deconstruting music that perhaps was more than ahead of its' time, bring true meaning of the term &quot;Progressive&quot;, which is to look forward, not towards the past. In this instance, the result being the fabulous and very listenable &quot;Discipline&quot;, Fripp resurrects Crimson after a seven-year hiatus (breaking up the band at their creative peak in late 1974, for fear they would become &quot;dinosaur rock&quot;), fueled and inspired by his relocation to New York City, the post-punk and pre-New Wave hotbed of the late 70's and early 80's. Here Fripp is joined by former band mate Bill Bruford (drums), Tony Levin (bass and Stick) and Adrian Belew (guitar and vocals), and what a band they would be. It's a musician's wet dream, and to their instinctive musical credit, they avoid all obvious cliches, careful to stay within the concept of the music and not fall into any needless soloing or posturing. You can say that the title of this album is indeed an apt description of the manner by which these master musicians interplay with one another. In fact, the name of this band was to be Discipline; Fripp did not want to call it King Crimson, but upon the suggestion of his band mates and after taking part in early rehearsals, he felt Crimson was not just an appropriate name, but also a reflection of the type of music that is synonymous with King Crimson only.<BR>Throughout &quot;Discipline&quot;, there's an air of control and anarchy. The band rips it up in high-powered rave-ups like &quot;Frame by Frame&quot; and&quot;Indiscipline&quot;, but yet finds a delicate, introspective side in the lilting lullaby of &quot;Matte Kudesai&quot;, and the gentle Balinese Gamelan interplay found on the title track - here, Fripp and Belew trade a repetitive cycle of guitar fingerpicking. In years past, Fripp's leadership was always stamped on the band's earlier output, throughout their many incarnations. Here, taking a cue from the vast wealth of musical language displayed by his new mates, Fripp takes a step back; he's still the leader, but Belew is truly the star of this band. Having worked with both Frank Zappa and the Talking Heads, Adrian Belew is the revelation here. He brings his entire bag of tricks, lyrically and musically. Witness his innovative elephant-wail guitar work in &quot;Elephant Talk&quot;, a clever word-play that takes into account society's over-reliance on communication. And, lyrically, he injects humor and melancholy, themes which were sometimes hinted but never realized in other Crimson recordings. A sense of humor, really, is prevalent in nearly all the tracks, and Belew, vocally, does a fine impersonation of David Byrne's herky-jerky delivery. This is especially the case in the stark true story behind &quot;Thela Hun Ginjeet&quot;, where Belew rails about crime in the streets of New York while recounting his experience with two potential muggers, all the while being lead by an unbelievable funky bass line from Levin, evoking the hipness and imperil of downtown New York.<BR>In the wistful, exotic &quot;The Sheltering Sky&quot;, the band takes a cue from Paul Bowles' masterpiece novel and brings the listener to the sands of the Sahara, on perhaps a ride on a camel with the Bedouin tribes travelling across the desert. Fripp's experimental guitar work with Brian Eno in the mid '70's pays off in spades on this track, through the use of a tape looping technique he cheekly coined &quot;Frippertronics&quot;, molding his guitar sound into a blaring horn right at home in the bazaars of North Africa, while Bruford, through his innovative work with electronic drumming, gently propels with an array of exotic percussive sounds.<BR>But it's on &quot;Indiscipline&quot; where the band truly shines. Levin, the bald master studio musician (who has REALLY worked with just about everyone you can imagine), begins this track with a lurching, disturbing rhythm coaxed out on a Stick (a hybrid of guitar and bass). Bruford joins him slowly, then impassively, unleashing a barrage of acoustic and electronic drumming that sets an uneasy tone. Belew and Fripp trade furious, nearly psychotic streams of shrieking, feeback-laden guitar, supporting Belew's spoken word lyrics which may sound like, if you close your eyes, the lunatic ravings of a serial killer, brooding in a spare, dingy apartment. The truth is, Belew used a letter his wife wrote him about a painting she drew as inspiration for his lyrics. This track really sets the tone for what this band truly is, to this day - the best and most listenable noise making unit perhaps ever heard.<BR>This Eighties line-up owes much to the experimentalist new wave of the Talking Heads, the fierce feedback and shred of Sonic Youth (who would cite this band as an influence), the power pop sensibilities of the Police, and, yeah, even the booty-shaking funk of Parliament/Funkadelic. For once, it's a Crimson album that you might even be able to dance to, if only in moderation. As Belew shouts at the end of &quot;Indiscipline&quot;, you'll agree when he screams &quot;I like it!&quot;
B00004Z459|5.0|This album is one of the best I have head in awhile. A great mix of rock and rap which is kewl. anywyz, im a girl and i still like it great change from the those ... NYSNC boys. THE BEST
B000002NJS|4.0|Abandoning the dancehall sheen, the obvious Top 40-friendly hook, and the sexual innuendo of her previous efforts, Madonna constructs a body of introspective lyrics supported by stark, spare electronica. While one would think she would perhaps be performing professional suicide by avoiding the controversy and bombast that has made her arguably the most recognized female celebrity since Marilyn Monroe, she skillfully drafts what is in essence her declaration of independence from everything that made her a star in the first place. It's not much of a stretch, this new direction found on \\"Ray of Light\\", but it's indeed both a departure and a re-examination of her roots and her inner soul. It's a direction she hinted at in \\"Bedtime Stories\\". The end result is perhaps her least-accesible album but yet her most enjoyable music experience. <BR>Collaborating with William Orbit, a veteran of the ambient electronica scene, Madonna inserts herself into a new role, in both the musical and spiritual sense. Musically, she owes much to the progressive, experimental stylings of Bjork, without the vocal pyrotechnics, of course. Spiritual, and it goes without overstating, the birth of her daughter Lourdes awakened Madonna, and throughout each lyric on this album, she tries to come to grips with both the uncertainty and exhilaration of motherhood, her spiritual leanings and the price she has had to pay for her universal success (and obviously, the critical beatings she has taken in the past). A recurring theme of loss and salvation can be heard much throughout \\"Ray of Light\\". <BR>We open with \\"Drowned World/Substitute for Love\\", which immediately shocks you with her declaration that all her fame and infamy, her successes and failures, have failed to enlighten her the way her new found motherhood and spirituality have. Okay, for perhaps 90% of the world's population, this may not be so revealing, but in the case of Ms. Ciccone, it's pretty refreshing. And because of that, we are sparedof some of the arrogance and self-righteousness that made songs like \\"Express Yourself\\" and \\"Vogue\\" insanely effective in years' past but somewhat outdated now - she's no longer carrying the burden of the title of Material Girl; instead, she's Earth Mother. The opening track sets the pace for the rest of the album, and it's immediately inherent that much of the hip-shaking exhuberance and slow-burn sensuality that is her trademark is missing. Yet it is that absence that is the strength of the work. While never a strong vocalist, she has always maintained an instantly recognizable voice that was further strengthened by her terrific work in \\"Evita\\". Here, on \\"Ray of Light\\", her new-found vocal confidence, in Orbit's skilled hands, shines like gold. For once, Madonna is able to represent a maturity, vocally, that may have been missing on some of her classic hits. The beauty is, while this may be an \\"electronica\\" album, Madonna and William Orbit careful steer the sound to fit like musical wallpaper, in support of the strength of her voice and lyrics.<BR>Which isn't to say there isn't a hit single to be found anywhere. On the contrary, the title track is perhaps Madonna's best single ever, a joyful, spirited wake-up, a revelation of her growth spiritually, and a Top 40 smash to boot. Some of the tracks follow that danceable blueprint that makes a Madonna song what it is, such as \\"Skin\\" and \\"Nothing Really Matters\\". The other hit track, \\"Frozen\\", fits the Madonna big-hit vein, and, on this song, she evokes memories of torch singers pleading with their man to show them the love they desperately crave. Using a sensuous, trance-like Eastern flavor, it's a song that's heartbreaking, but upon further examination, you have to wonder whether she's addressing a lover or whether it's her soul addressing her, pleading her to abandon the lifestyle she has created for herself in her quest for fame and fortune.<BR>Lyrically, Madonna's not Joni Mitchell (hell, she's not even Alanis Morrisette), but it's a jump light years ahead for her. While the gentle lullaby of \\"Little Star\\" may seem a bit corny for some, it's obvious that it's from the heart, and not orchestrated like some of her earlier output. Mind you, she's still the same calculating Madonna who has charted her own path to fame. Here, she takes a step back to look around her. It's not all good, for she's made many mistakes, but her new-found clarity, as evidenced brillianty on the album, gives her the strength to enbolden and challenge herself, as well as carry on her role as mother to both her daughter and her legion of fans.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Like everyone else, I think this is one of the best albums ever. The newly remastered version sounds much, much better than the original release on CD.
0345448898|2.0|As a parent, I was very alarmed at the conclusion of this trilogy.  I really enjoyed the first two books.  Pullman writes beautifully and elegantly.  If you are a parent, and your children wish to read this series, you might want to read these books first and you should be aware:  1. Pullman is clearly very anti-Christian.  I am not a Christian myself, but found his dark view of organized religion to be so extreme that it was very disturbing.  2. This series is actually not just anti-Christian, but really attacks religious beliefs.  3. It was bizarre that the series never touched on other religious beliefs besides Christianity.  Pullman, ironically, despite his clear anti-Christian beliefs, seems to accept that it is the one and only correct depiction of God, Heaven, Hell, etc.  4. There is definitely a darker sexual undertone to the relationship between Lyra's parents - not explicit, but \\"domination.\\"  5. I am alarmed that these books are targeted at young adults (teens), but the reader and parents are not warned of the nature of the content.  The dark nature of these books could be very disturbing to some young people.  6. Personally, I think it's good to expose my child to alternate views that may not agree with those of our family.  However, a book that is as diametrically opposed to my family's values as this one warrants discussion with my child.  My child read this, and enjoyed the series, overall, and we also had some stimulating conversations as a result.  I am very glad that I read this series as well so that we could have those discussions.
B00005LANG|5.0|Easily his best recording, and now that it's been remastered it's even better than before. A must, along with The Clash's &quot;London Calling&quot; remaster.
B00005Y228|5.0|La la la...<br />Three seemingly hypnotic words have been captivating all of Western Europe since the single \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" first hit station this fall. It isn't until 6 months later that Kylie hit the shores of America. Peaking at #1 on Billboards Dance Chart and currently nipping at the Top-40's covenanted Top-ten, Kylie is taking America by storm... again? Think back and perhaps you'll remember her... next to your hairspray and leg warmers lies a cassette single of Locomotion. That's Kylie, but now we see a more matured and appealing songster, who has spent the last 14 years perfecting her \\"electric pop\\" overseas, and with much success (none of her 30 some singles have failed to break the top 20 in Australia or the UK).<br />So now she's back... a mirror ball that only dance-pros and members of the gay community have given any attention to in the last 10 years... Carly? Kelly? Minogue?!? Her last name rhymes with Vogue boys and girls... and she's been a handfull of indy Oz films, had 4 World Tours (5th starts in a few months...), popped up in Baz Luhrmann's \\"Moulin Rouge\\", dueted with rockers Nick Cave and Robbie Williams, crafted a auto-biographical coffee-table book, 8 albums, 30 something singles, launched her own undie line... ummm... get the point?<br />Kylie's \\"Fever\\" offers us a blend of disco, electric beats, and a moral fiber found amongst only the 80's best, this album proves to be one of the years greatest dance records. \\"More, More, More\\" will surely devolop you an infectious appreciation for disco, and \\"In Your Eyes\\" along with the title track \\"Fever\\" are tracks to be certainly considered for single number two. <br />I rate \\"Fever\\" as highly as possible. Since her initial success, I have followed Kylie's career with great marvel and bedazzlement. Kylie is good. Nothing more to say. Trust me: Buy \\"Fever\\".
B000002HAF|5.0|This was the first Pixies CD I ever bought. I Had never heard any of the songs on here beforehand (the only Pixies song I knew was &quot;Here Comes Your Man&quot; off &quot;Doolittle&quot;) and basically bought this on the advice of a rock critic. And I am so happy I did.<BR>In my opinion, this is the best Pixies album ever made. The later albums lack Kim Deal's songs and much of her voice. &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; also sounds good and rough, like it had been recorded in Steve Albini's garage or basement. Joey Santiago and Black Francis's guitars go unbelieveably fast. Black Francis screams out his vocals like a maniac, but Kim Deal balances him out with her steady bass and even steadier vocals. The harmonies are simply heaven.<BR>The songs themselves are instantly memorable. There are no GOOD songs on here--they are all ultrafantastic. It's impossible for me to pick favorites because I would end up naming every song on the album.<BR>No one who is into real alternative rock should be without this CD. One note though--buy &quot;Surfer Rosa&quot; before you buy anything else by the Pixies, because their other albums are not as consistent (although they are wickedly fun for the converted). I think &quot;Doolittle&quot; is great, but if I had gotten it first I never would have gotten into the Pixies, and I would have missed out on this fabulous album and their others.
B00006312Q|5.0|This is Cline Dion's first cut from her new album entitled &quot;A New Day Has Come&quot;. Its her megareturn from her 2 year hiatus. I think her voice its just sounding amazing, better than ever! This song its quite soft, but really hopeful and with touchful lyrics!<BR>I know her new album will be great, her best until now!
B00005QIPH|5.0|I had only heard one or two songs of the Strokes that I downloaded on the computer. Then I went to go sell some cds at a used cd store. Anyway, they weren't giving money but they said they'd trade me for a new cd. Thats when I saw 'Is This It'. I picked it up and I was definately not disappointed at all. It gave me a newfound excitement for new music.<br />All of the eleven songs are really great. I made my friend listen to it and she didn't adjust well to the low-fi quality that is on some of the songs. But I like this album because its fast with some really great guitar solos and melodies. The drums are fast with precision. I like how the lyrics tell a little bit of a story and its great to find a cd to listen to from start to finish.<br />Buy this cd, try it. If you don't like it you can probably find someone to pass it on to.
B00005QDW1|4.0|Okay - this is gonna be tough. <BR>Q. Is RockSteady the best album No Doubt have ever done?<BR>A. No, not by a long shot. It's easily the weakest album of their 5 available.<BR>Q. Is RockSteady the great big pile of dross that many people are calling it?<BR>A. No, there is some good material here. But it's hard to mentally connect the No Doubt of 'Tragic Kingdom' and the No Doubt of 'Rock Steady' at least on a musical sense. <br />I like this album. There I said it! <BR>There is some great music to be listened too here, and I think No Doubt have made a good move by refusing to be pigeon holed into the \\"West Coast Ska\\" prison. They make music in order to make money (same as Aerosmith) and therefore changing with the times should be encouraged not critically put on trial.  <BR>But saying this I hope they go back to the heavy drum beats of their previous albums when they start writing their 6th masterpiece. <BR>Now, the music.<BR>I've always put lyrics over melody, and this is where 'Rocksteady' is unchanged compared to previous No Doubt albums. Their lyrics are really, really, brilliant!<BR>It works; and the whole \\"I think Cupid is just taking the piss\\" line off 'In My Head' still cracks a smile; as I'm sure anyone who's had a confusing relationship can agree with. <BR>My favorite track? 'Running' actually. Despite the fact that the opening bars sound suspiously like the 'Lemmings' video game music the lryics are poinient to anyone who's had a frendship/relationship affair with someone. <BR>In additon, the photographic artwork is brilliant, and worth the price of the cd alone purely for the insperational perspective it gave me.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I resisted reviewing this album for a long time, because I felt it would be difficult to seperate my personal attachment to it and be objective about it.  But [forget] that!  This is the best album of the 90's, that's right, better than Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Rage Against the Machine, Built to Spill, Smashing Pumpkins, etc. etc. etc.  Every track is a masterpiece, with the lowest point being Climbing up the Walls, although when I saw them live at the Gorge in Washington, 'Climbing'  was one of the best performances. Go figure!  Letdown, Paranoid Android, Subterranean Homesick Alien, and Motion Picture Soundtrack are four of the most fully-realized tracks I've ever heard.  They ooze with tone, emotion, and fragile courage.  Karma Police, Airbag, No Surprises, and Slow Down are a few songs that -although not as immediately impressive as some of the others - have grown into personal favorites.  But this album is much more than a collection of great songs.  It is a near-perfect musical masterpiece in its own right, with a continuous thematic feel to it -- something that you can't necessarily define but it hits you hard on the sub-verbal level.  Yeah, its anti-corporate, pro-human, anti-robotic, etc, but that doesn't really suffice for a description of the thematic element of this album.  Its really sublime..
B00003CY5J|4.0|This movie has enough to be entertaining, though not the best performance of ANY of the actors in it.  Deniro is his usual gruff self.  While he is a great actor, watching the outtakes of him and Brando makes you think that he's done it all before.  Brando on the other hand, while good, is totally out of it and it comes across in the film.  He's trying, but he doesn't know he's there.  Norton is once again great.  This young actor is one of the best out there and delivers a great performance.<br />Now, the plot of this movie is pretty cool.  The whole heist thing keeps you interested and on the edge of your seat.  This combined with the acting makes this a really good movie.  Make sure to watch the special features to catch Brando out of it.  And yes, he was wearing pants as far as I could tell.
B00003CXXP|2.0|In &quot;A.I.&quot; Steven Spielberg attempts to channel Stanley Kubrick, but the connection is bad.  What makes this  cutting edge cinematic achievement all the more frustrating is the central, sad, notion that at a far distant time, humans and human love is a lost, totally alien concept.  Kubrick was among the greatest of filmmakers.  His unique visions, made with engineering-like precision, were often subjectively cool, cynical, ironic, journies of discovery or dissolution.  Speilberg's like a master forger whose work exceeds the original.  But the two directors' personal proclivities do not mix well in this odd tale about a spiritually cold future.  The two disc set has new featurettes on all the primary creative and technical elements.  But all the bonus material does not make up for the one missing thing that screams for an answer:  What is Kubrick's contribution and what did Spielberg bring to Brian Aldiss's story &quot;Super-toys Last All Summer Long&quot;?  This would be a great DVD if Speilberg had deigned to speak to the masses of devotees that gather before the cold light of plasma and cathode ray altars seeking transcendence.
B00003CXTG|1.0|There are not enough bad things I could say about this movie, but I will try.  First off, there are two good things:  1) the battle scenes are beautiful, and 2) the part played by Cuba gooding is historically acurate (check it out, he won the Navy Cross!).  Now beyond that, this movie is a love story.  Yes, its a love story that makes Titanic's look good and interesting.  Two friends, one woman, a mistaken death, then he returns to mess it all up.  My God, Soap Operas do better than this!  Ben Affleck, while cool and likeable, plays this part like he does all of his parts.  You can't tell if he is from 1942 or 2002.<br />If you're looking for a good war movie, this is NOT it.  Go see the Thin Red Line, Von Ryan's Express (Frank Sinatra in a WWII POW movie) anything but this.  If you want to see a good Pearl Harbor movie go buy Tora!Tora!Tora!  That movie is acurate and doesn't have the sappy, horrid love story in this movie.  This could go down as the worst movie ever.
0440180295|3.0|As a novel, this book is a very nice piece of literature. For anyone interested in Vonnegut's writing, however, it appears very \\"done\\" - it seems Vonnegut intended this book for the mass audience, while some of his other books were meant more for a smaller audience, one that was ready for his bitter sarcasm and irony. In other words, this book is toned-down Vonnegut. While it has many interesting twists and turns, they are either to subtle for the average reader, or so obvious that they can no longer qualify as sarcasm, but are rather elementary criticisms of war, human nature, and society (the usual suspects). If you want something truly interesting, read his more thought-provoking novel, Sirans of Titan which is outstanding. If you are looking for sarcasm in general, make sure to check out One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, which is the best book ever written. Don't read Catcher in the Rye, it is irrelevant :)
B000002GVO|5.0|When I first listened to it, I expected every song to be as great as the title track. But that's not how the album works. You might need give it futher years and listenings more to really appreciate it, but it's worth it. It's making good sense in itself, you just have to get it. Maybe you should just give it a try on a laid back morning, afterhours.
1555047793|4.0|This book about Lennie and George, two quite different types, is a book which never will be too old. It has a timeless theme, which is as relevant today as it was when Steinbeck wrote it. Whwn I sat i the sofa back home, and read the last pages, my father suddently saw the book I was reading. He read it when he was younger, and liked it as well as I did. So there we went on chatting... The theme of the book is discussable, but it contains several subjects which encourages readers in all ages to read on. True friendship, the American dream, mercy killing...

B0000009TJ|5.0|Returning to a horn arrangement more characteristic of the 70's Mothers, this 2-CD set catalogues some great live performances. The first CD gently prods the absent Johnny Cash, who was originally slated to appear before his wife got sick, in several of the tracks.  The performance of the &quot;One Size Fits All&quot; suite stands as another testament to the band's technical prowess. The second CD is a little more gimmicky, taking some not-so-subtle swipes at Jimmy Swaggart. It ends on a good note, however, with a nice arrangement of &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot;.
B000000XB9|5.0|This disc contains EVERY single that charted (including b-sides) during CCR's brief career.  As such, it makes it an indispensable part of any serious music fan's collection.  Beginning with their first million-seller &quot;Susie-Q (Part I)&quot; through their 11-minute version of the Motown classic &quot;I Heard It Through the Grapevine&quot; (released in 1976, three years after the breakup of the band, when it peaked at No. 43), CCR put out a string of hits unparalleled by any other artist of the era.  With John Fogerty's gift of melding a variety of influences into a truly American brand of rock 'n' roll, coupled with his signature guitar sound and smooth as sandpaper vocals, CCR produced such classics as &quot;Proud Mary,&quot; &quot;Green River&quot; and &quot;Travelin' Band.&quot;  Although CCR never had a No. 1 single, they did reach the No. 2 spot five times.  In addition, eleven of their singles sold more than a million copes and five sold over two million! As further testimony to their popularity, CCR did something few bands other than the Beatles had accomplished--many of their b-sides also charted, including &quot;Lodi&quot; (No. 52), &quot;Commotion&quot; (No. 30), &quot;Fortunate Son&quot; (No. 14), &quot;Who'll Stop the Rain&quot; (No. 13), &quot;Run Through the Jungle (No. 48), &quot;Long As I Can See the Light&quot; (No. 57--it went to No. 20 in the UK!), and &quot;Hey Tonight&quot; (No. 90). If you're going to own only one CCR album, this is it.  Chronicle Two contains no hits, but plenty of strong album tracks (including part II of &quot;Susie-Q&quot;). ESSENTIAL
B0000009SF|5.0|This 1972 album of big band jazz-rock was also one of Zappa's biggest commercial failures, the result of supporting a large touring band and an album that did not chart. Demonstrating his regard for the album, he said, &quot;They were hits in Scandanavia&quot; - he would not revisit this music later in his career. It's a shame, because the performances are inspired and the arrangements undeniably Zappa-esque (critic Art Lange described them as &quot;bland&quot; and &quot;too mellow&quot;; I wonder if I am listening to the same album). The melodies are memorable, notably in the title track and the aptly titled &quot;Blessed Relief&quot;, which follows the George Duke fueled funk of &quot;Eat That Question&quot;. A great place to start if one is wary of scatological lyrics and other such controversy attached to other albums in the Zappa catalogue.
B00005NW02|5.0|I'm more of a Creed, Greenday, Blink 182 kind of a fan, but i LOVE this CD.  When i first heard \\"Chop Suey!\\" on MTV, i thought it was some annoying metal band, so i changed the station.  Then my friend started talking about SOAD all the time so i downloaded a couple of songs.  I got \\"Science\\", \\"Chop Suey!\\" and \\"Toxicity\\" and liked them all(to my surprise).  So I bought the CD.  I have fallen in love with it.  I take it everywhere.  My favorite songs are : \\"Chop Suey!\\" \\"ATWA\\" \\"Science\\" \\"Toxicity\\" and probably my favorite: \\"Aerials\\".  \\"Aerials\\" is a really neat mix of metal/rock with a softer sound that really defines SOAD.  Probably the only music fan that wouldn't like this would be a country fan, but they can screw themselves, cuz this CD rocks!!!
630438551X|5.0|Part of the greatness of Shakespeare's plays is that they require interpretation - the actors and directors are free to portray the characters however they are inspired to. I immensely enjoy most interpretations of Shakespeare, simply because there's so much room to play with. Baz Lurhman chose to set his &quot;Romeo &amp; Juliet&quot; in modern times, with a modern soundtrack, but retaining Shakespeare's &quot;original&quot; dialogue. <br />I put quotes around &quot;original&quot; because the lines are seriously edited down and, in some places, hacked to pieces. I may have been more satisfied had They done something like Branagh did with his &quot;Hamlet;&quot; use the *whole* script. Ah well, c'est la vie, c'est la guerre.<br />Luhrman makes up lost ground with the talented use of vivid colors, sweeping tracking shots, and dream-like sequences for which he's famous. Further, CiCaprio didn't make me want to gouge out my own eyes with a melon baller - usually I find him intolerable, but he did a remarkable job with Romeo. The scenes calling for angst, in particular, showcase what talent he possesses, when he wants to access it. Claire Danes does a passable job as Juliet, but I largely found her tiresome. Pete Postlethwaite was a very nice surprise as Father Laurence - it was interesting to see him as a different sort of character. Harold Perrineau was a fantastic Mercutio, bringing a wonderful spirit and energy to the role.<br />I really recommend this movie, even though it's assuredly not for everyone; in my humblest of opinions, the aesthetics of the movie should please even the most stuffed of the stuffed shirts. Or, falling short of &quot;pleasing,&quot; it might just make some thing &quot;ooo, pretty&quot; once in awhile. Shakespeare is hardly ever a waste of time, unless the performance is utterly passionless, and this interpretation definitely doesn't lack passion.
B00003CXI1|4.0|First of all let me say that I did enjoy the movie, although I have never read more than book one. <BR>Just one comment, I have never heard of a wizard riding a broom. Wouldn't that make Harry Potter <BR>A witch? ...
0441172717|5.0|...<BR>The Duke Atreides is given control of the planet Arrakis by the Emperor.  Arrakis, also known as \\"Dune\\", is the only known planet to locate the most precious substance in the universe, the spice.  The spice controls everything.  It prolongs life, permits space travel, and is also an extremely addictive drug.  The Duke's son, Paul, and his wife, Jessica, must secure the planet Arrakis and restore control as orders by the Emperor.  Their greatest enemy, the Harkonnen, threaten to retake control of the planet after holding it for 80 years.  The Harkonnen try everything from assassination to invasion secretly backed up by two legions of the emperor's own elite troops, the Sadukar.  Paul and his mother are forced to flee their home and their only hope lies in the Fremen, an extremely rugged desert people. <br />The characters in this story were absolutely amazing.  Each one had is own personality, habits, and ways of doing things.  They sounded like they didn't even come from the same author.  They were very believable and make this futuristic sci fi story even more fascinating.  Throughout the book you really see the main character evolve and change as the story progresses.  He changes from an intelligent young boy nervous on a new planet to an extremely disciplined brilliant man.  All the characters are extraordinarily well woven into this complex sometimes confusing story.  Even the Mentats, human computer like minds, have a whole different view on things.  Everyone seems like a real possible person put into those circumstances.<br />I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes long, complicated books.  This book really makes you think about everything.  Most of the concepts in the book were very interesting.  This book almost needs to be read several times.
B00005R87Q|1.0|Ummm.. Does anyone in this movie know anything about cars or acting or the fact that hijaacking trucks is not cool....<br />Ok..Ok.. This movie helped me realized that I'm not a kid any more. There are other things in life that has told me this, but this sealed it. This is one of the stupidest movies I have every seen. Where do I start. Well, to all the teenagers and those under 25 that believes a hopped up Honda with a tiny turbo and NOS is going to beat a real sports car in a race needs to talk to their dads and uncles about real hot rods and sports cars. (BTW for all of those of you out there that think these cars are real and aren't temperamental aluminum death traps that need.. Umm if you want to spend 50 grand on a car that can do a sub 5 second 0-60 and a 110+ mph quarter mile.. by a 2003 Vette Z06 and pocket the extra 30K.)<br />Alright, enough talk about the fantasy cars in the movie. This has to be the second worse plot I have ever had the displeasure of seeing (the first is Congo.. I hate that damn talking monkey). Did anyone else notice that anyone that was over 25 in his movie and wasn't a street racer was either very stupid or REALLY VERY STUPID. Also are the truckers in this movie suppose to be the bad guys.. because I though hijacking trucks was a federal crime and I found myself rooting for the trucker to blow the thieves away (but then again I cheer for the Indians in westerns thanks to my Cherokee and Blackfoot Great Grandmothers). <br />Can someone explain to me how 20 year olds with no job can afford 20 thousand dollar cars with 60 grand worth of parts? Or where everyone in the movie giveaway $2K on every race with no job? How come there are no fat people in this movie..  every body looks like they climb out of a bad Calvin Klein  ad. <br />The worse thing I can say about this movie is I have people call this the new millennium version of West Side Story. I almost punched that person. This movie isn't even a guilty pleasure. Gone in 60 Seconds is a guilty pleasure. Was it Oscar material.. No, but it at least had real actors in it and they could deliver a line without sounding like they were reading it off cue cards. Any who wouldn't love to own the GT 350 ( a real hot rod).<br />Can I say anything good about the Fast in the Furious... It has GREAT SOUND
B00003CWN3|5.0|When's the last time anyone dared to tackle such a subject? We already know that some of the details of Brandon Teena's life needed to be changed to make a concise and coherent film. There is no question that Brandon is not a nice person; he's a user, forger, thief, etc. Still, it's an interesting person around which Kimberly Peirce chose to center her first film. Certain elements of Brandon's life have been \\"abbreviated\\" but this was for the flow of the film's narrative. There is really no way anyone can fault Hilary Swank's brilliant performance. She was in practically every frame of the film; Chloe Sevigny brought out the sweetness and tenderness from Swank's character. She also personified the boredom of the lower class, mid-Western, stuck-in-a-rut, karaoke singing, girl at dead-end. There are people like this.It's frightening to think that previous reviewers don't believe it. It's a riveting film, and Hilary Swank gives one of the most courageous performances. Even if you don't believe the gender switch, Ms. Peirce's film is an important one.I love this film. There's ugliness, and it's dealt with appropriately. This IS a true story (edited for content), though a good display of red-neck culture. Most instructive. Most upsetting. Most enthrallng. Hilary deserved every award.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I first found out about his movie nearly two years before its release. When i read the plot to it and saw the director i knew it would be a great movie. I saw it the fist day because i could not wait any longer to see. After it was over i realized it was worth the wait. This is one of speilbergs best. Although it was very long it still kept me interested throughout the entire movie. This movie deserves to win best picture at the academy awards and it wasnt even nominated. I recomend any spielberg fan to buy this movie. Trust me its worth the money.
B000002JR8|3.0|The first four songs of this album are really good but after that the songs go downhill and the rest of the album is really boring. The first four songs- \\"Strength beyond Strength\\", \\"Becoming\\", \\"Five Minutes Alone\\", and \\"Im broken\\" are all great songs. The rest of the album pretty much ... though, in my opinion.
B000002KBU|1.0|How can anyone like this talentless woman?  She can't sing and is absolutely egotistical (name an artist she hasn't dissed).  Try listening to some female singer/songwriters who are good at what they do!
B000002H2H|4.0|Metallica released killer thrash metal albums! This album is great with super fast songs and angry vocals. The best song is definitely \\"Creeping Death\\". That shows what kind of metal Metallica is truly capable of. Other good songs are \\"Fight fire with Fire\\" and \\"Trapped under Ice\\". This album makes one remember when Metallica used to make albums that were up to the par of bands like Slayer, Anthrax, Sepultura, and Megadeth and other killer thrash bands. Popularity killed Metallica and made them sell out though. Metallica \\"Kill Em All\\" through \\"Justice for All\\" is true Metallica.
B00005TT77|5.0|I am already a big Beatles fan, but after hearing this CD, I have to admit, that I enjoy their music even more. The songs are reproduced with great skill and talent and they are true to the originals. High points include Rufus Wainwright's version of \\"Across the Universe\\"(my favorite Beatles song), the Stereophonics version of \\"Don't Let Me Down\\", along with Aimee Mann and Sean Penn's contribution, and Sarah McLachlan's as well. All in all, this is a fantastic CD, with great covers done by great musicians. A definete buy!!!!
B000002JOH|4.0|This album is good has some good songs like &quot;Mouth for a War&quot; and &quot;A New Level. It is not as good as The Great Southern Trendkill in my opinion, though. Still a good album if you like Pantera I would buy it.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|At first the direction of the plot was somewhat disorienting; but very soon, this flick became completely fascinating and inescapable. There doesn't appear to be much publicity for this film...but there should be. You will not be disappointed. Try it!
0679735259|3.0|Dont get me wrong by the title, but at times the author seemed to go off on different tangents. I origonally bought this book becase i am a history major, but it lacked on history.  but what it did have for me any way were &quot;&quot;s that appear in the movies that he helped write. movies as in fullmetal jacket. however wordy this book was i thought it was a decent book. i have read worse.
B00005OCMR|2.0|As someone who has seen the wonders of computer animation put to use in such films as \\"Toy Story\\" and \\"A Bug's Life,\\" I can't help but feel nothing but disdain and repulsion for Disney's earlier effort, \\"Tron.\\" Released in 1982, the film was a landmark film in that it was the first to use computer animation as a major storytelling effect. By the standards of its time, it was a breakthrough piece of filmmaking; by today's standards, its technical wizardry would be considered a cheap ploy at masking its absolutely hammy story. <br />Don't get me wrong; I, too, admire the movie's visual trickery, especially for its age. Disney has always been known for setting new standards in animation, and \\"Tron\\" was just another step up the ladder of success. With its striking display of colors, lines, wrap-around sound design and meticulous artistry, the viewer is essentially transported to a place that, twenty years ago, was hardly anything more than a childhood fantasy. <br />But to look at \\"Tron\\" in this day and age, and compare it to the wonders of cinema that have developed over the past decade, and it appears to be a sophomoric effort, providing a striking contrast between two places in time, one when technology was just beginning to get on its feet, and one where it has nowhere to go but up. That's not to say the movie isn't well-made, but I wonder how many \\"Matrix\\" junkies would embrace it. <br />To be honest, despite my praise for the film's achievements, I thought it was downright terrible. The new generation in me looks upon the animation as cheesy but commendable for its time, while the critic inside me cries out for a better, more interesting storyline to accompany the effects. <br />Anyone who thinks many of today's films are ludicrous haven't seen anything until they've seen Jeff Bridges starring as a computer engineer who finds himself trapped inside a computer, fighting for his life against a Master Control Program that grows smarter by the day. In real life, Flynn(Bridges) is a video arcade owner who once worked for a major engineering corporation, until Ed Dillinger (David Warner) came into play and robbed Flynn of his job and his original ideas. Flynn, who has been trying hack into the computer systems, causes a lockdown of the system, leading him to infiltrate the facility with the help of friends, and thus, become entrapped in a computer. <br />But the cheese isn't done melting yet. Oh, no. Once inside the computer, Flynn finds himself in a place where programs are ruled over by the Master Control Program, which delights in sending lesser programs to their doom as they battle one another in video games. Flynn, along with Tron (Bruce Boxleitner), break free from their captors and must find a way to contact Tron's user in reality, before the MCP begins taking over major world corporations. <br />And I thought the plot for the various \\"Friday the 13th\\" sequels were convoluted. Truth be told, \\"Tron\\" possesses a story that is unbefitting of its visual flare, deadening any and all intensity that may have rested within the well-constructed action sequences. At one point, during a game in which players on opposite teams race in a grid-like maze, there is a slight glimmer of hope that the movie might break loose from its moorings and become entertaining, but then it's back to the banal dialogue, lifeless characters, cheesy plot twists, and a steadily rising level of disinterest in anything that happens. <br />Besides the visuals, there is one thing I can honestly say in favor of \\"Tron:\\" it is the true definition of a love-it-or-hate-it experience. You'll either fall in love with the wonderfully old-fashioned trickery of the visuals and the cheesy sci-fi storyline, or you'll look at it as a bland, almost mind-numbing exercise in animated excess.
B00002MZ2T|3.0|Savage Garden's self titled album was one of my very favorites when it came out--it was very unique and all the songs were different and weren't cookie-cutter songs like most of the groups Savage Garden is compared to. (&quot;Most people who bought this album also bought N Sync&quot;? Gag me with a fork). Anyway, as much as I loved their first CD and made a point of buying this one when it came out, it wasn't nearly as good in comparison--it sounded like they really wanted to be radio and wouldn't write something I would like like &quot;Carry on Dancing&quot; because it wasn't poppy enough. This CD DOES have a lot of good songs, that &quot;time will set you free&quot; one or whatever it's called is my favorite on the CD, and it's worth listening to, but not for days on end like the first one. ^_^ I don't think any one song on the CD is good as To The Moon and Back, but that CD was so good it's hard to make a fair comparison. To give it justice, I will say it's a better CD than a lot of CD's out there by junkier artists and it shouldn't be totally disliked because it pales in comparison to the first--so buy it. But don't excpect it to be as awesome as the first one unless you enjoyed the softer songs on the first CD like Universe and Truly Madly Deeply more than the others.
B00005JKYS|5.0|&quot;Those of us who have seen war keep seeing it. In the silence of the night, we still hear the screams.&quot; <br />War is hell, and &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; spends its entire relaying this brutal truth in a story that overflows with patriotic zeal, a convincing sense of chaos, and a harsh depiction of the physical reality of combat conditions. Like Ridley's Scott's &quot;Black Hawk Down,&quot; released in the holiday stretch of 2001, writer/director Randall Wallace, in his directorial debut, is careful to remind us of the emotional impact of war rather than sacrificing it for effects and thrills. <br />It seems that Wallace has learned from previous misfires: the story, adapted from the novel by Lt. Col. Harold Moore and reporter Joseph Galloway, is everything that Wallace's previous script, &quot;Pearl Harbor,&quot; was not. Beginning with the introductions to military life as seen through the eyes of various soldiers and officers, we are given a unique opportunity to become involved in their family lives, bearing witness to happier times before President Johnson orders reinforcements into Vietnam. <br />Mel Gibson is cast as Harold Moore, the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, 7th Cavalry, arriving on base with his wife, Julie (Madeleine Stowe), and five young children. Among those singled out by the story to provide emotional connections are young Lt. Jack Geoghegan (Chris Klein) and his expecting wife, Barbara (Keri Russell), Maj. Bruce 'Snakeshit' Crandall (Greg Kinnear), who shows a great deal of devotion to duty, and Sgt-Maj. Basil Plumley (Sam Elliott), who exacts a brutish demeanor as a result of decades of wartime experience. <br />After a montage of tearful goodbyes that pull at the heartstrings with all their might, Wallace's film nosedives into the hellish combat of the Battle of Ia Drang, as Moore's soldiers are choppered in under heavy fire from the soldiers of the Viet Cong. After splitting into divisions, several men are surrounded, many of whom are seriously wounded, leading Moore to regroup and make attempts to rescue his entrapped soldiers, all the while battling forces surrounding his own. <br />These brilliantly photographed and acted scenes of battle are some of cinema's most memorable, charged with physical intensity that practically jolts the audience with each explosion and gunshot. Wallace brings the viewer into the experience rather than making him a sideline witness to it, wrapping us in a continuous onslaught of sensory perception, from startling images of bloodshed and mangled bodies, to the non-stop firing of machine guns and heavy artillery. <br />Accompanying such moments are a constant reminder of the emotional loss and grievances one goes through in times of war. We see young reporter Joe Galloway (Barry Pepper) befriending a Japanese-American soldier in the middle of combat; ten minutes later, he's rushing towards a rescue chopper, his bloodied friend hanging loose in his arms. We see the tear-strained faces of wives informed of their lost husbands. We see these soldiers, once young, their innocence stripped from them as they stare into the eyes of the enemy, and instantly, the emotional magnitude of such an event becomes a stark reality.<br />But through it all, we see something richer, something well-defined, something forgotten in much of the modern war drivel that has graced the silver screen in years past. &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; not only packs a physical and emotional punch, but brings to light an overwhelming aura of patriotism that is evident in the heroic acts of its characters, a sense of duty and devotion that makes the movie's dialogue ring true in every way, shape and form.  <br />In playing Harold Moore, Mel Gibson recalls the glory and presence of his performance in &quot;Braveheart;&quot; his ability to juxtapose a stern demeanor with true, heartfelt displays of emotion hasn't lost its luster. The under-used Madeleine Stowe portrays Julie as a strong-willed military wife, while Keri Russell makes good use of her onscreen time. Each of the cast members who make up Moore's cavalry give heartfelt performances, most notably Barry Pepper as Galloway, whose narration bookends the film. <br />Movies like &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; benefit from a connection to reality. The inclusion of characters Moore and Galloway serve to remind us of the factual basis for the stunning visual and emotional assault that conveys war and those affected by it. Wallace's film, while being a great tribute to those who fought for a war still misunderstood by many, is a patriotic display of courage, heroism, honor, and the knowledge that for those who have seen war, victory is bittersweet.
B00005QIPH|1.0|I don't own this album but I played the audio clips.  That was enough of the Strokes that I will ever care to hear.  Look, if I wanted 80s music, I would play 80s music.  If I wanted to hear Jim Morrison sing, I would buy a Doors album.  These rich boys have no talent and you should have zero respect for those who write shining reviews about this album.  If you want good new music, look to Radiohead, Squarepusher, Autechre, and Aphex Twin.  If you want to lie to yourself about this band... go ahead.  I'm just not going to do it.
0553573403|5.0|George R R Martin is all over the place in here.  Rival factions, murder, intrigue death, destruction, betrayal, and that's just the beginning.  Not only will you read this, you will read it more than once.  You'll get into arguments with your friends about who the better people are.  You'll be happy when some characters are killed and shocked by what happens to others.<br />Every time I think I really understand what is going on, something else rears it's ugly head and turns the world on it's ear.  The relationships between all of the characters are developed better than anything I've read in years.  If you don't like fantasy, read this.  If you like fantasy, this will probably replace whatever your favorite series ever was.<br />The hardcovers (and hopefully the trade paperback when it comes out have an additional thing worth considering dropping the extra money for, they have a detailed breakdown of all the family and group relations.  With as many people as there are here, having the \\"program\\" to identify the players is a big plus.  Spend the extra money, it's worth it.
0446608955|5.0|A seventeen year old boy named Landon Carter is asked by Jamie Sullivan to join the schoolplay. Landon can't say no so he decides to join. Jamie is one of those girls who helps everyone and everything. All the adults love her but at school nobody pays any attention to her. Landon is casts the lead in the school in the school play and Jamie is the angel. He needs alittle help on his lines and asks Jamie. She agrees as long as he doesn't fall n love with her. He agrees because he thinks this will never happen.During the play Jamie looks beautiful and that is when Landon realizes he is falling in love with Jamie. But, then something tragic happens. <BR>    I liked this book because it's very different from the movie. I like the details that they show in the book and how they begin to fall in love with each other. Also that I always wanted to read more and more. It was a good book because it sometimes made you want to cry and other times make you so happy.<BR>     My favorite part in the book was when he said he wouldn't fall in love with her. But, he does fall in love with her and they spend all their time together. Landon doesn't care what his friends think and isn't afraid to go out with her. She starts to have the same feelings for him. Her father the minister isn't so sure about it.
0553106635|5.0|A Game of Thrones made me go Wow!  A Clash of Kings made me go Whoa!  This one made me do a double take.  There are things in here that I wasn't expecting.  At all.  Just when you think you have an idea of who the good guys are (there are good guys?) and who the bad guys are (all of them) George R R Martin brings out Storm of Swords and you get to find out that no, even in a uniquely gray world, things can get MUCH murkier.  Not only that, but you'll love every minute of it.<br />The bloodbath and carnage continues!  Buy it and then you can join the throng checking the internet weekly hoping for updates on Book 4.
0553269631|4.0|As a freshman in high school, I chose to read, &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter&quot; for a book report.  I can understand how other high school students may have found this novel boring.  However, it is not necessarily meant to be read by the average high school student.  It is meant to be enjoyed by those who read in search of a deeper understanding. Carson McCullers wrote a thought-provoking novel of loneliness and depression that will stay with me throughout the rest my life.
0553579908|5.0|The bloodthirsty carnage continues.  Most sequels have some kind of let down.  Don't believe it here.  George R R Martin's second volume of &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; is just as loaded with strangeness as the first one was, and that means bad things are going to happen to lots of people.<br />Not only will you not put it down, when you're done, you'll go buy the third book.  This makes my top ten for the past ten years, and books one and three of the series (A Game of Thrones, and A Storm of Swords) are right there with it.<br />Buy them, read them, and be chomping at the bit for the next book to arrive.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Pink has done it again! This CD is just as good as her first one. Though &quot;Get This Party Started&quot; got annoying after the first two times you heard it, the rest of her CD is something you can listen to over and over. &quot;Just Like A Pill&quot; is an awesome song with a great beat. &quot;Lonely Girl&quot; with Linda Perry adds a little extra to her CD. Her song &quot;Family Portrait&quot; gets personal. The CD is great and I would recommend it to everyone!

B00005K3OT|5.0|In a time when too many films are produced with no more thought or care than target demographics, with a rigid adherence to the idol worship of a sacred bottom line, it is refreshing that an occasional solid work of film art such as \\"Chocolat\\" finds its way to the cineplex. This unassuming and delightful film is a lovingly layered morality tale that unfolds in unexpected ways, never preachy, always entertaining. Few viewers will walk away from this film without feeling at least a little bit better about their lives. A repressionist mindset that seeks little more in life than a numbing stability and a daring gypsy soul embodied in Vianne (Juliette Binoche) who breezes into town and would deny such predictability are co-mingled in a charming French village in the late 1950's. Vianne prepares for her epic contest with conventionality with an irresistable weapon of choice. She opens up a chocolate shop.  As Vianne offers a sympathetic ear along with her magical confections, the suspicious villagers one by one begin to shake off a lethargy that has stifled their mundane lives. Of course the Mayor, Comte de Reynaud (Alfred Molina) is understandably unnerved by this threat to good public order. He is a decent man with honorable intentions but holds to an unrealistic standard of perfection no one could possibly live up to. The battle of wills comes to a head with the unwelcomed arrival of the river people led by Roux (Johnny Depp). An instant attraction that arcs between the nomadic spirit shared of Vianne and Roux complicates things in unexpected ways, and Vianne discovers that she too, is possessed of feelings of vulnerability that are to be dealt with or denied. All of the actors in this beautifully photographed story deliver a polished performance. Judi Dench as always, is terrific. Johnny Depp's work in this film has once again demonstrated a remarkable talent and in my opinion is under-appreciated as one of our finest young actors.  This is a wonderfully crafted film,given to voice-over narrative that at times, give it a story book feel.  Highly recommended.
B000002B82|5.0|After I had heard Blizzard and Diary I bought this album.  I didn't think it was a good as first, but now I've changed my mind.  It's a bit heavier and just as good.  Zakk Wylde is a great guitarist, maybe not as good as Randy was, but unbelievably talented nonetheless.  As soon as he hit the first chord in \\"Mr. Tinkertrain\\" I thought \\"Oh yeah!  This is gonna rule!\\" and it did.  The best songs are \\"Mr. Tinkertrain\\", \\"I Don't Wanna Change the World\\",  \\"Mama, I'm Coming Home\\", \\"Desire\\",  and of course, the title track.  \\"S.I.N.\\" and \\"Road To Nowhere\\" are also great.  All of these songs feature Ozzy's voice(you either like it or you don't), Mike Inez on bass(I think), Randy Castillo who is a pretty good drummer, not the best, but good, and of course, Zakk Wylde's incredible solos, fills and pinch harmonics.  If you like this album I strongly suggest the Live & Loud and Tribute albums, as they showcase this bands talents better than any studio album.
6305358613|5.0|I've always loved the history and stories of Tudor England-Henry VIII's Six Wives and children (legitimate and iligitimate alike).  And of course, Elizabeth I is the most famous of all English sovereigns, so when this movie came out I was very anxious to see it.  Thankfully I was not disappointed.  It's very enjoyable and stimulating.  WATCH IT!
0375416676|5.0|Daniel Silva's story is set amid the Palestinian-Israeli conflict where patriots on both sides become zealots driven by the unspeakable inhumanities they suffered.  Gabriel Allon, a crack Israeli agent and world class art restorer, comes out of retirement to nail Tariq, the Palestinian terrorist who killed Gabriel's wife and son years before.  Ari Shamron, his cold Machiavellian mentor who is running the super secret operation, offers up Jacqueline de la Quoi, born Sarah Halevy and granddaughter of Jews executed in the Holocaust.<br />Gabriel recruits Jacqueline to seduce Yosef, Tariq's contact.  She's madly in love with Gabriel, guilty about the death of his family and accepts the assignment so she can get close to him.  Tariq realizes she's and agent and plots a suicide mission that will draw all the players in.  Jacqueline becomes Tariq's traveling companion, and the end game begins.<br />The action moves through Montreal to the US where Arafat and the Israeli Prime Minister are in town for a breakthrough in the peace process.  CIA guy Adrian Carter, sleazy President Beckwith and former Ambassador / Senator Douglas Cannon from \\"The Marching Season\\" all have bit parts.  Tariq disguised as a waiter delivering Arafat's prized honey is armed and alone in a room with him.<br />Read on to find out who shoots whom and what Shamron was really up to.  The control guy in a Silva novel always has ulterior motives, though Shamron's duplicity is nothing compared to Sir Basil Boothby in \\"The Unlikely Spy.\\"  <br />All in all, I think this was Silva's best.
0380730367|5.0|&quot;Prayers for Rain&quot; is another awesome addition to the Kenzie/Gennaro series from one of the great writers of today.  Karen Nichols asks Patrick to help her be rid of a man who is stalking her and with Bubba's help they think her troubles are over; an easy case?  Of course not!  Sometime later Patrick finds a message from her on his answering machine and doesn't take the time to call her back because &quot;he's busy.&quot;  Then later, he hears of her suicide and because he feels he let her down he has to find out what could have caused her to take her own life.  So, along with Angie and Bubba they investigate and find distubing things about how she spent her last few months and as in all of Dennis Lehane's novels, the story takes enough twists and turns that you can't help but keep reading to find out how this powerful story ends.  If you haven't read any of this series yet; start now because you won't be disappointed!!
B00005T30L|5.0|Eighteen-year-old Enid (Thora Birch) seems too smart for her own good. She can sniff out counterfeit people everywhere and feels she is navigating through a suburbia of ghosts, waifs, mountebanks, charlatans, and philistines. Languishing through her loneliness, she finds solace in her art, her drawings, her journal, and her cynical soulmate Rebecca (Scarlet Johansson). But after graduation, Rebececca's hard edges soften as she tries to adapt to the business world and she shows her yuppie aspirations. This causes a rift between Enid and Rebecca so that now Enid, living with her effete father who is dating an irritating old flame, suffers even greater loneliness. In her desperate state, she meets an incurably geekish social misfit, twenty years her senior, Seymour (Steve Buscemi), who, unlike everyone else she must endure in this suburb town, resonates a certain innocence and authenticity. A reflection of her, Enid is compelled to bond with him, at first as his &quot;mother,&quot; finding him a girlfriend, and then as his lover, but on both counts the relationship is strained and collapses under the weight of Enid's compulsive desperation.<br />By showing Enid, the cynic, lose her mask and become more and more vulnerable through her love for Seymour, the movie creates a wonderful portrait of an adolescent dealing with the existential crises that any sensitive, intelligent young person must face living in a society that extols consumerism and phoniness and has forgotten what authenticity is. Enid knows authenticity is out there somewhere and we learn to love her and hope with all our hearts that she finds it.
B00003CXRP|4.0|Cast Away is an entertaining movie about an extremely punctual man who gets stranded on an island. The move has some really great moments. It is great to see how Tom Hanks must adapt to his environment. This is no tropical paradise, but more of a tip of  a mountain sticking out of the ocean. The only complaint about the film is the length. The first section could have been shorter, more island scenes, and drastically cut out the end. I just want a good survival movie, so the character builing story of the him and the girl does not appeal too me. This is an entertaining movie.
0792833236|5.0|The Raging Bull is the boxer Jake La Motta, a man whose brain is distingetrating from the vat of boiling testerone that exudes from him so much that he is a prisoner of his own machismo. Jealous, ambitious, full of violent paroxisms, Jack is obsessed with proving himself and achieving the American Dream by being a champion boxer, but his problems with getting fighters courageous enough to fight him and his problems with the mob trying to fix games eventually end his career and he spends his time languishing as a fat man in a night club where, as the owner, he tells crass jokes and lives as a vulgar, divorced, lonely man, rotting in his illusions. Like a miracle, Scorsese the director has taken this beast and put him in a majestic opera, with ballet-like grace, about hypermasculinity and the American Dream.
0375757422|4.0|Once you master the difficulty of the language(some in our reading group never did), you can focus on the story and relate to the witty and impudent Emma. In one incident Emma and her best friend and former governess share a non-verbal communication by stepping on the other's foot under the table when something wild is happening!  So many of these &quot;modern&quot; exchanges take place, that I was able to drop my misinformed presumptions that the english gentry class of the nineteenth century are so different from me.  There are moments of great cruelty (such is the case of class struggle) and there are two hilarious characters; the gossipy neighbor who barely catches her breath, and answers her own questions, and Emma's worrisome and overprotective father. The story seems to be one party after another -- from parlor rooms to ballrooms to picnic luncheons -- you will be amazed at how much time these people have on their hands! Oh, the leisure class. Emma goes through some humbling changes, and there are surprising turns of events. I found myself wishing for Emma's world -- where your neighbors are intimates and you alternately visit and are visited upon, and work isn't in the picture.
0345413377|5.0|While I enjoyed the first two parts of this trilogy, The Golden Compass and The Subtle Knife, they in no way prepared me for the excellence of this concluding volume. Golden Compass is a sturdy and whimsical YA novel, occasionally tedious to an adult. Suble Knife is better; more imaginative, frightening, and tough-minded.<br />The Amber Spyglass, while clearly the work of the same author, represents a huge leap in ambition. Suddenly the odd tale of Lyra and Will is swallowing and transforming great chunks of western theology while racing from one resonant cliffhanger to the next. <br />The book's seriousness of intent is beautifully matched by its playful invention, so it never seems heavy handed, and by the time the myriad armies are clashing for a spectacular war in heaven, Pullman's tale has taken its rightful place in the pantheon of fantasy classics. It's final chapters, wise and heartbreaking, are perfect.<br />Pullman's trilogy has been compared to both Harry Potter and the Narnia books, but it seems to me the better comparison is to Clive Barker's Imajica, another wildly imaginative and intricate reworking of the Bible.
B00005QY5Y|5.0|I bought this album a while ago. I was looking for something entirely new when I found Gold. After I got it home and put it into my cd player, it hasn't left my cd player for weeks. And I still love every song. Ryan is one of those extremely rare talents who can get away with putting 16 tracks on an album and not bore you after 12. <BR>Even though there are a lot of different styles on this album, all the songs do fit in just fine. Adams shows that he knows how to rock, and how to make beautiful ballads and above all else that he is an exceptional songwriter. His lyrics are touching, emotional and sincere. <BR>'New York, New York' is an instant classic. But there are more gems on this album. My favourites: 'When the Stars Go Blue', 'Hollywood Blvd.', 'Wild Flowers', 'Tina Toledo's Street Walking Blues', and 'Harder Now That's It's Over.'<BR>If you loved the single 'New York, New York,' you should definitely buy the album (and everyone else too, of course ;-) ). Go buy it! It's well worth your money!
6304795254|4.0|The game is perhaps the most least understood of David Fincher's movies. While Fight Club and Seven wear their premise on their sleeves The Game invokes expressions of bewilderment and indignation from first time viewers. It was only after I had watched it for the 3rd time that I realized that I understood it. The movie itself is well crafted and fast paced. It has a first class cast and produciton quality. Michael Douglas and Sean Penn are two accomplished actors and they are in good form here. Douglas especialy is spot on as the bewildered and confused banker whose tranquil life is suddenly turned upside down as he redeems a gift coupon given to him by his brother played by Penn. The gift coupon belongs to a company which promises to bring a bit of spice and vitality back in Douglas' life. But it is actually a passport to hell. As the game progresses Douglas' life is turned upside down. He is left homeless and pennyless and $600 million stolen from his bank. Either everyone is part of this elaborate practical joke or this nightmare is for real, you will never be able to guess till the end. Even after the end you are left a little dazed and confused. What we don't realize is that deliberately or perhaps unintentionally Fincher is commenting on the human condition. Have'nt there been times when we feel as if it is fate that sometimes plays the most important part in what we turn out to be.
B00005A1PR|4.0|I have to say that I was really disappointed with the turnout of events from the Grammy's. How could talent like Ms. Arie's not be given it's due credit? This is a CD that can be enjoyed from beginning to end and you really feel the spirit of the artist, not like other artists' trying to fit in someone else's mold. India Arie truly changed the way I view musical talent with the soulful stringing of her guitar. &quot;Video&quot; was given the most credit from the album, but songs like &quot;Ready for Love&quot; and &quot;Back to the Middle&quot; are the best songs on the CD. Though Ms. Keys' debut &quot;Fallin&quot; and &quot;A Woman's Worth&quot; were very good songs,  these didn't beat the acoustic guitar of India. In my book, she is still a winner.
B00005QZ7U|3.0|What a schizophrenic movie this is ... definitely way overhyped in an era where films are made based on video games (Resident Evil coming to a theatre near you). If this is some attempt to revive \\"the musical\\" for the 21st century, then it misses the mark by a wide margin. The first half is such a miserable, cut-and-paste hodgepodge of MTV-style editing and snippets of contemporary pop songs and classic musical tunes come fast and furious, interwoven and absolutely absurdly arranged. Funny? Cute? Ingeniously postmodern? How 'bout lazy and stupid?! (At least for me, it was). I was about to give up on this movie 30 minutes in, but I stuck it out. The second half actually settles down into a tolerable romantic musical that is more reasonably paced and edited, redeeming what would otherwise be a colossal turkey of a movie on the level of Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band or, hey, Ishtar.<br />Other redeeming pluses are the strikingly good and resonant voices of both Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor, even if their acting is a bit tepid at times. Unfortunately, as much as I like John Leguizamo, his performance as Toulouse (Lautrec?) is forced and just plain irritating.<br />In short, this a freakshow of a film that is essentially 1/2 turkey and 1/2 passable musical.
B00005T33W|5.0|This movie was so refreshing to see. It had been so long since I've seen a great comedy that is original and somewhat realistic. Every town has its neighborhood freaks that all the locals see regularly. This movie is great because it gives you a behind the scenes look at one city's freaks and the stories that accompany them. Steve Buscemi is brilliant and Thora Birch does an excellent job as the bitter wannabe-rebellious high school graduate. I don't want to ruin the film by going into details but you need to see this movie immediately.
B00005JKYS|4.0|In recent months, war-related movies Behind Enemy Lines, Black Hawk Down, Hart's War and Collateral Damage have battled it out at the box office. In light of September 11th, their subject matter has gained a profound new meaning, addressing the nature of war and why we wage it. Now, We Were Soldiers steps onto the cinematic battlefield and emerges as the clear victor, well-worth the price of admission.<br />We Were Soldiers tells the story of Lieutenant Colonel Harold G. Moore (Mel Gibson) and the battle at LZ X-Ray in the Ia Drang valley, the first major conflict between North Vietnamese troops and American troops in the Vietnam War.<br />Gibson shines in the role, showing us an intelligent, thinking, brave and determined leader. He won't ask a man to do what he won't do himself: \\"I will be the first to step on the field and I will be the last to step off,\\" he assures his troops. He reads books and studies the nature of his enemy carefully. He trains his men meticulously, preparing them for the ominous battle to come. \\"Men will die,\\" he tells his troops, knowing that he and his men are at a disadvantage against an enemy on their own turf.<br />In addition to Gibson, Greg Kinnear, Sam Elliot, Barry Pepper, and Keri Russell all give outstanding, A+ performances. Kinnear plays Bruce Crandall, a chopper pilot showing determination and courage while still revealing his fear of death in the course of battle. Pepper plays Joe Galloway, the journalist who rides into the heat of battle to get his story first-hand. (Just wait until you hear his reason for becoming a journalist instead of a soldier.) And in spite of my personal disdain for her character on the WB's Felicity, Russell inspires us as a strong-willed mother, in spite of the possibility of losing her husband Jack Geoghegan (Chris Klein) at war.<br />The film does an exceptional job of transitioning from place-to-place, whether from one area of the battlefield to another, to the women and children back home, you always have a good sense of where things are happening and when they're taking place. When one platoon is cut off from the rest of the soldiers, when riverbeds are won and lost, you know exactly what effect it has on the battle. You experience first-hand the grave danger these soldiers experienced. You mourn their deaths and cheer their victories because in spite of the fact that you're sitting in a movie theater, you feel like you're there in battle with them, facing the possibility of death, witnessing the horror of it all.<br />Writer-director Randall Wallace (The Man in the Iron Mask) spends a fair amount of time showing us what is going on behind enemy lines from the point of view of the North Vietnamese. I first heard this was an element of the film before I saw it and was afraid they were going to portray the communist North Vietnamese in a sympathetic light. But, interestingly, these scenes added to the drama and suspense of the film. We see what each leader is thinking and planning for the next attack, which only builds more suspense in anticipation of the next scene to come.<br />A sense of family is well-portrayed among the soldiers, and especially among the wives at home. Madeleine Stowe plays Julie Moore, the wife of Lt. Col. Moore. She heads up the group of wives, giving moral support and preparing them as best she can for the possible death of their husbands. Her and Russell show us the chilling events of how they dealt with relaying the notices of the deaths of their friends' husbands.<br />What is lacking in the film is mention of how the war started, or that North Vietnam was communist. Although these are well-known facts, they are too important to pass over in a film about the Vietnam War.<br />The filmmakers have been saying in their media appearances that this is an anti-war movie due to the graphic nature of the battle scenes. Be prepared: the battles scenes are graphic, but I did not come away thinking they were pro- or anti-war. The sheer quantity of gore can never trump the morality of why we fight a war. These scenes only dramatize the risks of fighting a war, and who and what is at stake. The political elements shown in the film (e.g., how we went into Vietnam unprepared, and failed to properly arm our men in the best way possible) only demonstrate, in my view, that if we do choose to fight a war, we must do so acknowledging the risks and then proceed with the moral certainty that our cause is right, with only one goal: to win.<br />We Were Soldiers is the best war movie Hollywood has released since September 11th, showing us how to fight a battle and how not to fight a war. With outstanding acting and a wide variety of emotions, it is a tribute and a salute to those who fought in Vietnam, and to any soldier who fights for America.ity of gore can never trump the morality of why we fight a war.

B00005JKYS|5.0|I saw the film on its general release day with about 20 other people in the theater, mostly older people who probably were Vietnam vets or families.  I was glad for that privacy, as I'm sure they were.  This realistic and well-done film brought clenched fists, tears and gut-stabbing memories back to most of us there, male and female alike.  I recommend it highly to people who want to understand this war and its participants in a way that does them justice.<br />As gory as it is -- and I recommend it only to viewers old enough to understand why it is so -- \\"We Were Soldiers\\" finally gets the early Vietnam experience right.  It does so without the existential pschyo-drama and anti-war posturing that most previous films of the genre have had, making soldiers into dopers, fiends and charicatures.  It honors the well-intentioned and patriotic men who went to do an unpleasant but necessary job, but who wound up struggling to save themselves and each other in a battle and a war that shouldn't have been fought.  It also honors the women and families at home who waited for them, sometimes in vain and without proper assistance or support.  It also portrays the Vietnamese combatant fairly; instead of being a bloodless monster, he also had a country, a job to do, and a family that he loved too.  The producer, director-writer and actors have all done an excellent job in bringing the real story of Vietnam to the screen.<br />I have two suggestions for potential movie goers.<br />One: If you are Vietnam era vet, consider seeing the film by yourself or with another vet buddy first before taking family and other friends with you.  It will get to you, and it may be hard for you to keep your composure.  A previous look will help you and them discuss it, and perhaps your own experience, with greater ease and understanding afterwards.<br />Two: The theater release battle dialogue is almost inaudible against the background sound track.  That is a reality in actual combat, but in a film with non-military viewers it makes the officers' stategies difficult to understand and the action hard to follow.  Until the producers can correct this in future prints, I suggest reading the book before seeing the film so the flow of the battle makes more sense to you.<br />Go see \\"We Were Soldiers\\".  They got this one right.with non-military viewers it makes the officers' stategies difficult to understand and the action hard to follow.

B00005U1YO|2.0|\\"Come with us, to where the sun is brighter...\\" preaches a voice in the title track of Chemical Brothers' new album \\"Come With Us\\", convincing the listener to a musical journey of extraordinary proportions. Yet the truth is nothing but.<br />I have never been a big fan of the Chemical Brothers. Their meddling of big-beat, rock, trip-hop, and Middle Eastern influences are hardly exciting nor intriguing when compared with other big-name electronic musicians. Now \\"Come With Us\\" is a pretty bold statement for a album title, and I took a chance by buying this CD, hoping to hear something new from them.<br />Yet, what I heard was nothing more than the same old Chemical Brothers I've heard years ago. The overall production was disappointingly dull, and it seems like the duo has changed very little since \\"Exit Planet Dust\\". This may be a good thing if you're a ardent fan who has loved all their previous productions, but if you're a person who's looking for something new, this record will sound VERY boring. <br />It frustrates me when I listen to this CD because I can never get a grasp of what the Chemical Brothers are trying to accomplish. They will hammer you with the melodic trance riffs of \\"Star Guitar\\" one minute (which is one of the few good moments of entire CD), then a lengthy track of a southern-belle singing about cows jumping over fences (\\"The State That We're In\\") the other. I almost threw up when CD closed out to \\"The Test\\", which featured a tawny vocal reminiscent of Dave Matthews (AGGGGHHHHHH!!!). The only tracks that I consider worthy listening to in this CD is \\"Star Guitar\\" and \\"Pioneer skies\\".<br />I was looking for something transcendent and thought-provoking; instead, I heard samples of hippies chanting about going around in circles (\\"Hoops\\"), which well explains what kind of musical state the Chemical Brothers are currently in...
B000051VWW|5.0|After a long way away from music, Sade shows that her music can stand the test of time. Her music may not reach the Top 40 today(which I say is clogged with too much boy bands, J-LO, and Brittney Spears), but it is still a CD that makes for great listening. Many of the songs just come out in a smooth tone. there is passion in everything Sade sings. She now sings for her fans, rather than for mainstream approval. That is what music is all about. It's not about royalties and profits. Sade respects the music. This CD is just a good example. It's great for rainy nights or helping us deal with the sadness of love. Welcome back, Sade. :-)
B00005NWLO|5.0|Comparing it to the original LP and to the original CD, the enhanced overall sound quality of this CD version really helps you to appreciate the virtuosity and cohesiveness that lineup of Skynyrd had. The added songs and interjections are great, too: &quot;This ain't rowdy enough for me....&quot;. My only slight knock on this version is they seem to have changed the mix to de-emphasize the crowd noises in some places. It's most noticeable to me during the opening bars of &quot;Tuesday's Gone&quot;, where I kind of missed that one loud &quot;yyyeeeaaaahhhh&quot; from someone in the audience that's so apparent on earlier versions........but I'd still recommend this album and this version most highly.
0451163540|5.0|Making an atomic bomb is easy to do if you have a nuclear plant and the raw material (yellowcake) to make the uranium needed.  Egypt has been successful in building the plant but now they need the yellowcake. Israel also has a plant and is in dire need of the same raw material.The Russians are backing the Arabs  in this race so we have the agents from the Mossad, the KBG, and the Arabs and a double agent thrown in for an advantage to which nation? Ken Follett is a great writer of suspense and keeps you guessing thru the entire book as to who is going to steal and keep the stolen goods. Schoolmates from Oxford and one of their professors from ten years ago seek to favor one country over the other. We know the prof favors one country but who does his daughter favor? Who comes up with a reasonable way to transport thethousands of tons of yellowcake and who figures out a way to steal it from them? You won't want to put this book down until the end so plan on loosing some sleep. After you finish this book you may want to catch your breath before you start another of Follett's books, \\"Eye of the Needle\\" which is another suspensful spy story of WW II vintage. Both deserve more than a five star rating.
0793518326|5.0|This book is great.  Ive run into a few mistakes, but not enough for me to give this less than five stars.  The fact that its handwritten gives it a great look.  I'm obsessed with the Beatles, and if anyone else out there feels the same way they should buy this book.   ... You should also probably know how to play an instrument.
B00005T343|5.0|Wow...This was even more spellbinding than Silence of the Lambs...I was glued to my screen the whole time, and usually, although I'm not a lover of horror films, I found this one acutely tasteful, and gorgeously filmed. Anthony Hopkins is amazing, sharp and witty, with a delicate edge that brings you to the verge of tears as this twisted psycopath with a sense of humor, and (what is this...?) a heart, too...I love Hopkins in anything, really...But if you want to see Lector at his best, watch this film...Oh yeah, Julianne Moore compliments him well, too...heehee
0446678430|5.0|I have just read all of the reviews on this latest Robert Kiyosaki book and I must say, many people don't understand Kiyosaki's intent.<br />I have given a few of Kiyosaki's books negative reviews, mainly those that he simply wrote the forward on, and then allowed some &quot;Advisor&quot; to write and pass it off as his work in his &quot;Rich Dads Advisor Series&quot;. But this book is more in the tradition of typical Robert Kiyosaki, rather than some babble by Dolf DeRoos on real estate.<br />If you want to read all of the negative reviews of this particular book &quot;Retire Young, Retire Rich&quot;, your going to discover that almost all of them are unhappy because they had a question in mind, and Kiyosaki failed to answer the question to their satisfaction. But, that was not the point of this book at all, and that is stated VERY clearly right up front.<br />Kiyosaki is very clear is saying that he is not going to tell anyone &quot;How-To&quot; do anything. I applaud him for this, as everyone has their own unique experiences and talents. Look at the top 500 Billionaires in the world, there is simply no one way to get rich, it takes the proper mental perspective, and once that is acheived, anyone can get rich using a number of techniques.<br />The point of the book is to provide the mental framework that anyone can use if they begin to apply their own skills for wealth. To some this is real estate, for others it might be retail, or a car wash business. The simple truths in his book were used by all people of wealth, whether intentional or by coincidence. Kiyosaki manages to spell out the &quot;Why&quot; you need to begin to create wealth. I suggest the novice not be to concerned with the &quot;How-To&quot; immediately, but understand the &quot;Why&quot; to wealth, then your road to achieving wealth will be much clearer, and you can avoid the many pit falls of those that have failed before you.<br />If your not interested in understanding the PRINCIPLES needed to be wealthy, and &quot;Retire Young, Retire Rich&quot;, your probably not going to achieve wealth. If you want to comprehend the techniques, skills, and principles to wealth, then I give this book a very high rating and recommendation. &quot;How-To&quot; books are a dime a dozen, but 98% fail to deliver, thus 98% of society are not wealthy, true?<br />After this book, you can atleast understand why 98% fail to accomplish wealth, thus enabling you to use your own talents in a manner to achieve wealth if you so desire.<br />Good job Robert, I'm glad you wrote this book, regardless of what some of your critics have said in the past, namely myself.
B00003CXRM|5.0|From my point of view, if you don't like Coen Bros. movies, you must be a very humorless person. I love the quirky characters with their odd nuances, the plotlines which fly off the wall, the fact that I absolutely don't get bored because the story is constantly moving at warp speed.<br />This is perfect Coen Bros. Clooney, Turturro, Hunter, and the rest of the ensemble cast don't disappoint. The music is great and really becomes an integral part of the story. Wonderful viewing when you need a good laugh. Tonight I am snowed in here in Chicago and this is what I needed to cheer up in what looks like a blizzard. Much fun and craziness and pathos...
B00005JKYS|5.0|For those who have not experience war or battle, read carefully: Lt. Col. Hal Moore (Now USA Ret Lt. Gen) knew what leadership meant: Follow Me!<br />What the revisionists at Berkely, Columbia and the media in general will never understand:  Men fight for their brothers, nothing more.  They execute their duty and live with the execution or failure of that duty all their lives.<br />The movie gives us a tiny glimpse of what it was like to be a soldier in a war that everyone wants to forget.<br />Shame on us for wanting to re-write Viet Nam, shame on Oliver Stone and his ... liberals, shame on us for not smashing the mouth of every single liberal in America.  Shame on us for wanting to forget and ignor our brothers.<br />Lest we forget those who have fallen and those who have survived!<BR>Thomas J. Zaleski
B00005A46T|5.0|If you started off with Iowa before the self-titled, like I did, then you will really be able to appreciate this album for how great it is. The first few seconds of track 2 let's you know you're in for it. The drums on this album are the best drums I've ever heard, and tracks like Gently (far superior remake) and Skin Ticket will give you nightmares. Personally I think for their fourth album, then need to have more experimental tracks like those two. <br />This album is much deeper, much more cerebral and emotional than their self-titled, which I bought later for the sake of comparison. The difference between their self-titled and Iowa is the difference between raw talent and mastery. Iowa is certainly less catchy than Slipknot, but somewhere in the midst of all the screaming and drum-pounding and guitar slashing lies a certain artistic integrity that was lacking in previous recordings.   <br />And all of you heavy metal purists out there who say Slipknot isn't &quot;real metal,&quot; need to sit down and shut up. If you say so, fine, it isn't metal. It is what it is. If being &quot;real metal&quot; would require Slipknot to be any less brutal, or to scream with less ferocity, or to be more melodic, then I hope Slipknot NEVER becomes a &quot;real&quot; heavy metal band.
B000002H5I|4.0|It's almost impossible to believe that this was a debut album, it is that good. There is nothing about it that would indicate a young, untried musician. On the contrary. Tracy's intensity, her poetry, her strong convictions, her musical soul are here for all the world to cherish.<br />Unlike her two later CDs, where Chapman softened a bit, these songs are pure, hard, protest, and what a joy it is to listen to them; what a joy to know that there is a pure, clear, voice out there that is challenging one's conscience. I haven't had the pleasure of such a listening experience since the early Joan Baez. And even though their voices are literally octives apart and completely different in tone and timbre, I rate Tracy Chapman right up there with Baez. Like her, Chapman has a voice that needs no accompaniment; it is an instrument unto itself. But unlike Baez, Chapman writes ALL her own music.<br />This CD is nothing less than a work of genius. I cannot say enough about it except to tell everyone I know to buy it and listen. You'll see for yourself!
B00005JKT8|5.0|Best movie I have seen all year...made me laugh so hard at times that I cried!

1573921394|1.0|Anyone interested in Keynesian economics at work should look at Japan over the last 25 years or so.  The Keynesian solutions employed there are right out of the 'General Theory' and are crystal clear examples of the fallacies inherent in government directed economies.  Hundreds of billions have been spent by the government pouring concrete under virtually every river and creek bed in that country (and least 60 percent of the ocean shoreline) in a vain attempt to stimulate the economy with make-work projects.  Japan is on the verge of a depression.   It is in fact the only developed nation since WW<BR>II to be suffering from sustained deflation. <br />    I suspect few readers who start this book have the stamina or stomach to complete it but if you do I suggest you read Henry Hazlitts &quot;The Failure of the New Economics&quot; (a line by line analysis of the \\"General Theory\\") alongside it and judge for yourself how coherent, logical, or true, Keynes thought really is.  For those of you who are not worshippers, employees, or dependents of the STATE and are capable of entertaining economic ideas other than totalitarian ones check out Mises.org as a starting point for free market economics and the writings of Hayek and von Mises.  One might discover there the argument that depressions and wild business cycle swings are the result of government interference in the economy.  It's an idea at least worth looking at.   Anyone looking for a general introduction to economics could not do better than Hazlitts \\"Economics in One Lesson.\\"  It is short, intentionally clear and intellectually honest; the very opposite of the \\"General Theory.\\" <br />    To the professors who have written in praise of this book and criticized others on this site I suggest reading a beginning textbook on logic and logical fallacies.  I assume a few can still be found in university libraries.   Just as an intellectual exercise, see how many fallacies you can discover in your own posts at this site.Sometimes I do it with my own writing when trying to be precise and objective, applying it like a spell checker tool and find it helps in clearing up sloppy thinking.  Of course when arguing for a position by manipulating feelings because either reason doesn't support the case or one is not secure in its validity, logical fallacies are the tools of the trade.
B00005OAA6|5.0|This album is truly a revelation! Even if you think you don't like the Spice Girls you really couldn't fail to appreciate this album. It is very easy listening, with most tracks produced with a real pop/r'n'b vibe. I wouldn't say this about many albums but I really do not get bored listening to this album... it's on constant repeat!<br />The album opens with the UK top 10 hit \\"Not Such An Innocent Girl\\". This track is one of the few tracks on the album that Victoria did not write. It is a real taster for the album. A mid-tempo track (a consistent theme for this album) that begins with Victoria politely telling us that \\"first impressions can be wrong\\", and so they can be! The next track is the 2nd single \\"A Mind Of It's Own\\" which begins with a laid-back spoken rap and builds up to a catchy chorus. \\"That Kind Of Girl\\" is an up-tempo ballad which talks of Victoria's desire for simple, uncomplicated love. \\"Like That\\" is Victoria in defensive mode. Here she is helping out a friend who is being treated badly by her man. \\"Girlfriend\\" is one of my favourite tracks on the album, co-written with Dane Bowers. Clever lyrics about the telephone confrontation between Victoria and a girl who has found Victoria's telephone number in her boyfriend's Calvin Kleins. \\"Midnight Fantasy\\"... probably speaks for it's self! One of the more uplifting tracks on the album. \\"IOU\\" is a touching ballad about Victoria's beautiful husband, England and Manchester United soccer star, David Beckham. \\"No Trix, No Games\\" is one of the more bland tracks on the album with Victoria telling the listener of her power over men... or maybe one man in particular! The 3rd single \\"I Wish\\" is about Victoria attempting to show restraint when it came to one of her first encounters with David. \\"Watcha Talkin' Bout\\" is my favourite track on the album. The track is about Geri Halliwell and her supposed new found fakeness. \\"Unconditional Love\\" is Victoria's statement about love. Give her fast cars, pearls, money... allshe really wants is to see the love in her child's eyes. Speaking of Brooklyn, the last track \\"Every Part Of Me\\" even contains his laughing and giggling. A beautiful ballad about her love for Brooklyn and how she literally sees herself in him and what he does.<br />A truly wicked album which should have sold a lot more than it currently has. A wider release (there was no worldwide release at the time of writing this review) would see the album hopefuly get the exposure it deserves. Buy it now! You will not be disapointed!
B000006045|5.0|If you are undecided about getting this CD, here is some music advice:  Don't Hesitate, Just Buy It.  Most CDs lose their following as the years go by, but Mezzanine continues to get a stronger following since its release in 1998.  If you heard bits of Massive Attacks' music on TV (The Matrix, Victoria's Secret) and you want to hear more, you will love this album.  This is what music in the 21st century is supposed to sound like - dark but beautiful, abstractly erotic - this music plants itself in your mind and you can't resist listening to it again.  It might take a little time, but be patient with the CD.  The music will be patient with you.  Take a listen and find out what you are missing out on and why everybody raves about Massive Attack and Mezzanine.
B00005QCYD|3.0|Plot and purpose take a backseat in the third addition to the \\"Jurassic Park\\" series. The obvious motivating factor for the production of the film was money, not devotion to the art of filmmaking. Despite that fact, I stll cannot help but enjoy this exciting and fun science fiction adventure ride. It works just fine as that--a fun science fiction adventure ride.<br />Paleontolgist Alan Grant (Sam Neill reprising his role from the original JP) reluctantly agrees to accompany an adventuresome husband and wife tandem (amusingly portrayed by William H. Macy and Tea Leoni), as their guide on a safe distance airplane tour over Isla Sorna, the island still inhabited by the genetically engineered dinosaurs. Things heat up when, to Grant's dismay, they land the plane and reveal their true motive--to rescue their young son who was lost on the island after a glider flight went terribly wrong. All out run-like-the-wind-from-the-dinosaur-on-your-tail action ensues.<br />While bordering on the silly side at times, and lacking the novelty of the original, it introduces new dinosaurs, elements, ideas and sequences that you wished were in the preceding films, most notably, a thrilling pteranodon sequence where the flying dinosaurs swoop down and ensnare helpless human victims. Theories about the velociraptors' intelligence, briefly touched upon in the prior films, are given a more coprehensive exploration here, as well. And the 16ft spinosaurus is truly a spectacle to see; its ferocity rivals that of the t-rex! <br />Although it lacks the Spielberg touch (directed by Joe Johnston a la \\"The Rocketeer\\"), it contains enough state of the art visual effects, spectacular cinematic scenes, wit and surprises to entertain. The climax is a satisfying is one.
B00005V9QJ|5.0|I was one of the lucky kids to see these California tour dates and I can tell you that the audience sat in silence, mouths agape.  (Except for some fool in the back that professed his love between each song.)<br />This album truly evokes my memory of that concert, yet it gives every listener the ability to go back, time and again, to their favorite parts of the night and replay them at will!
B000003S09|5.0|I simply had to write a review of my favourite all time album. It is over thirty years since I discovered its genius and originality and this has never worn off. As close as you can get perfection. They start with the awesome power of Schizoid man. The band's collective musicianship weaves its way through jazz and rock. What a drummer in Mike Giles, what a saxophonist in Ian McDonald, what a guitarist in Robert Fripp, what a ..... After this you need a rest and find it in the beauty of I Talk To the Wind.<br />Then we have the epic Epitaph and the dreamy Moonchild. All of this comes together in the momentous Court of the Crimson King. Rock was never better. Crimson never bettered this debut offering. If you have never heard it you may be thirty years late but it will have been worth the wait.
B00005U18E|5.0|This is a very good movie.  If you liked Pride and Prejudice, you will like Bridget Jone's Diary.  Very well acted.  However, you must be intelligent to like the movie and also be a romantic.  You will enjoy it!!

U must have it as well!
B00003CXUM|5.0|If you were to find a fault in Wong's film it would be the pace: slow, methodical, but inspite and because of that pace \\"In the Mood for Love\\" is an utterly engrossing tale; a tale of a man who suspects his wife of cheating and a women who suspects her husband of the same. As they secretly share their pains and suspiscions they fall in love, a love which, due to guilt and the society they live in, cannot blossom. <br />\\"In the Mood for Love\\" is a period piece, taking place in 1962 Hong Kong, and it captures the period wonderfully with small details like the snippets of Shanghainese speech and Nat King Cole's melodic voice floating in an American-style diner. <br />In this movie Wong Kar-Wai achieved brilliance on every level. Not only does he create a perfect mood with his methodical pace, dark yet beautiful camera work, but he tops it off with excellent performances by Tony Leung and Maggie Cheung and an enthralling soundtrack that ties it all together. I have been a fan of Wong Kar-wai for some time, but in all of his films I felt something was missing. Here he has captured it all. With \\"In the Mood for Love\\" Wong leaves the label \\"a good director\\" behind and becomes \\"a great director\\".<br />The DVD is full of fascinating extras: interviews with the cast, Wong Kar-wai; descriptions of the music used in the film; trailers, posters, images. You can spend hours not even looking at everything but the movie!
B000050XEI|4.0|Enya, with her collaborators, is a trinity, and by doing less on this album, they have done more. By holding back on the production, Enya has released a masterpiece. Her choir technique of singing many parts is also more restrained, allowing the songs themselves to breathe in a new way. If this is a dry day for Enya, may she have more of them.

6304383827|5.0|The first time I saw this movie was when it was released in theaters back in 1996.  I thought it was quite enjoyable and my husband and a guy friend who saw it with us, enjoyed it as well.  However, after watching it, I never really thought about it again.  <br />About a year ago, however, I rented it and just fell in love with it.  After re-renting it so many times, I finally went ahead and bought the DVD.  Frankly, I don't quite understand how I missed how great this movie was the first time.  I suspect it might have been Austen overload, as 1995-96 was right around the time that when Austenmania gripped Hollywood.  Anyhow, I can't say enough about how much fun this movie is and how infinitely re-watchable it is.  The acting by the entire cast, from Gwyneth Paltrow to Jeremy Northam, Toni Collette, to Sophie Thompson and Phylidda Law, is simply superb.  Gwyneth is much better here than she was (IMO) in Shakespeare in Love.  It's hard to take your eyes off her; her Emma just so funny -- supremely confident in always knowing what's right for everyone and, to her and no one else's amazement, invariably is always proved wrong.  Jeremy Northam is also wonderful as Mr. Knightley.  Austen's Knightley in the book is so gentlemanly and perfect that he can almost be a cipher.  Northam however allows us to see into Mr. Knightley's psyche as he battles with Emma and her machinations, and his own exasperation, anger, jealousy and lust.  His body language and eyes convey it all.  Although Toni Collette is a bit of a miscast because she visually doesn't match Austen's Harriet, she redeems herself admirably by being so lovably dim that you can't help but wish her the happy ending she deserves.  And Sophie Thompson is just perfect:  funny and heartbreaking.<br />Although I agree with other reviewers that this version of Emma is not perfect (it loses some of Austen's sense of irony, just drops the ball on the Frank and Jane subplot, and never really let's you get too mad at Emma, who frankly deserves it), I think it makes up for it with the sheer joy, beauty, humor and romance of it all.  To put it another way:  As an adaptation, I'd rank it as 3-1/2 stars; as a movie, I give 5 stars plus!  It's just wonderful moviemaking.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This is a twisting plot of a 'totally innocent' man who can't remember anything past five minutes because he lost his short-term memory due to a knock on the noggin back when his wife was 'raped and murdered.' The color story goes backwards telling the end first then what happened before, then before that, then before that and so on. In this set up the audience is immersed in the same problem as the character, NOT KNOWING WHAT JUST HAPPENED TO CAUSE WHAT IS HAPPENING. Slower than the color story is a black and white story that starts from the beginning and tries to do it's best to describe the situation. And in the end the two stories meet and when the viewer realizes or thinks they know what happened the black and white story becomes color. Only you really don't know the half of it. Now, for me I figured out a few things before hand so it didn't shock me as much as it probably would have (The first time I saw it was on DVD and I had to pause it a few times so I had extra time to think about it rather than seeing it all at once in a theater), but it was extremely worth every minute and there is still even more twists that threw me off all the way till the absolute end.<br />Overall it was very impressive and very well done, and to think it was filmed in 24 or 25 days, UNBELIEVABLE!<br />I think that this movie is a classic. I for one and maybe the only one, think that this movie should have either A) a prequel or maybe even B) a sequel.<br />Don't forget to go ahead and buy this movie, you will regret wasting the five bucks on renting it.
6305531374|4.0|Where in the name of Haddonfield is my damn director/Jamie Lee Curtis commentary?? Apparently I'm oblivious, because in reading another review I just discovered that the ' Bonus Commentary ' advertised on the back cover of my DVD is nonexistent! I just sat down a few minutes ago to watch this movie again ( which I purchased used almost a year ago ), this time with the running commentary, and damned if I couldn't locate it. There is a mistake on the older DVD's apparently that advertises a commentary track that doesn't exist. Shame on you, Dimension Films! Oh well, guess I shouldn't believe everything I read. As for the movie itself..not bad. If you are new to the Halloween franchise, let me recommend that you watch a triple feature, Halloween, Halloween 2 ( takes place the same nite..like one long movie ) and Halloween H2O, which takes place 20 years after that nite.Halloween 3-6 really have nothing to do with the ' trilogy ' , and in the case of #3, have absolutely NOTHING to do with the Michael Myers story. Avoid #6 at all costs..it's an absolutely abysmal movie, which brings up the subject of the new #8 film starring Busta Rhymes that has yet to be released, which has all the writings of a quick-cash travesty on it, but I digress. Halloween H20 is a short film, under 90 minutes, and upon first viewing, it felt TOO short..but now I think it's just right. Michael Myers is back to finish off his sister, but she has something else in mind. Jamie Lee Curtis delivers an excellent performance in this movie, her best in my opinion. Critics may dismiss her performance, because let's face it, this is the seventh Halloween movie, we aren't talking about Citizen Kane here. I urge you to watch this movie once for the fun of it, and then again for her performance..Curtis is in such command of her performance, shows such strength, that it all but screams &quot; This franchise is nothing without me, I OWN this movie &quot;. Great work by her, which will be tarnished somewhat bythe next movie, in which rumor has it, she is killed off early on. What a shame, because they could have ended the story with H20. This is not Star Wars here, but in the realm of horror, Halloween is legendary, and it felt right to end it after the last movie. Oh well, money rules the world. So anyways, if you haven't seen this movie yet, don't watch it without seeing the first 2 in the series, because it will mean much more to you than if you saw it on it's own. Still not happy about that missing commentary track though..I would love to hear what Curtis has to say about the movie and her performance.
B00005U122|4.0|If you got the CD, you missed out. The music is half the point. Roger Waters was never that much of a musician, but is a master writer and virtually invented the concept album. Here he has a killer band, who stand out more now that we can get a clear idea as to who is doing what, and has found the apt way to visualise his songs - such as \\"Perfect Sense,\\" wherein the voice of Marv Albert sports-casts a nuclear war. While Roger's acting is wooden, he puts a genuine feel into his songs that nonetheless comes through quite well. Only picking point is the visuals for his excellent concluding song (hear it nowhere else) \\"Each Small Candle\\" come off too much as a push for Amnesty International, unintentionally dimishing the song's deep message. However, those of us who were too late to get tickets for Roger's tour will be able to see what we missed...
B00005Y228|3.0|Mr first reaction to seeing the video treatment for &quot;cant get you out of my head&quot; was just wow!...just wow!  In awe of the simplicitic production, i wondered where she come from?  So i did a little research and found out that she's garnered atleast 30 UK hits since &quot;Loco Motion.&quot;  I bought it full-price the day before the street date along with alanis morissette's album and i guess i didn't spin her record enough to recommend it to my friends.  I was rather disappointed by the sheer plasticity and lack of emotional depth.  She is definitely no madonna.  Rather, she sounds like a matured, 30yo britney spears, which can be a good and bad thing.  Some of the songs (ie fever, boy, more.., in your eyes, and burning up) remind me a few of britney's own stomach wrenching fillers.  Kylie can sing but her vocal depth is forgettable.  Again, she is no madonna.  Madonna is controversial, in your face, and a true artist.  Kylie needs to prove herself that she can write and produce her own music before i can seriously consider her an artist worthy of contending with madonna.  The majority of the album is just filler.  Maybe my purchase of Alanis' album at the same time is clouding my judgement.  No tracks exceed the brilliance of &quot;cant get u...&quot; Worthy of being singles here in the states are &quot;love at first sight&quot;, &quot;come into my world&quot;, &quot;dancefloor&quot;, &quot;love affair&quot;, and &quot;burning up.&quot;  &quot;love at first sight&quot; has the potential to hit the top 20, but to repeat the fluke Cant get u out of my head is another question.  I dont hate kylie, but she is no madonna.  I cant stress that enough.  Kylie's thin vocals are drowned in a world of spacey bleeps and beeps.  I haven't heard an album as mechanical and predictable as this.  It's def one of the few albums i try to like the first week.  Some wonder y she dropped the face of the earth ten years ago.  I believe that she needed time to refine her image and music.  If this is her finest album to date and at 30yo, she definitely needs time to reinvent herself.  you can only be a dancefloor princesss for so long.  And she will be forgotten if she does not break the mold she has made for herself.  MORE EMOTIONAL DEPTH PLEASE!...And please dont compare this to madonna's last two albums.  Those were experimental, far from mainstream, thought-provoking, pure genius.  This sounds (sorry) recycled britney remixes.  this is more of a response to those comparing her to madonna.  Please, before you dare to put both names in the same sentence, think!
B00005JKYS|5.0|My husband and I don't go to see movies often but felt the pull of this subject.  We don't have many heros from the Vietnam War. Hopefully, this movie will help get the respect that the military always deserves when they perform their duty, even when it is not for a popular cause.  The performances were excellent, the story was very moving.  The sound track can send chills down your spine it was so well done.  Don't go and expect entertainment, but do expect to be overwhelmed.
B00005JKYS|5.0|...<br />This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. Bar none. It is hard for some to understand duty and honor. Movies like this show what most men were made of in the past,....and what a few still are made of.
B00005O5CM|5.0|Don't let yourself be put off by the title, the topic, or the opening scenes.  I was expecting to see a movie about someone who embodied all the worst in blondeness, and in whom I would have little in common and for whom I would have little empathy.    Instead, Reese plays a wonderfuly endearing character, and I had to pause several times to recover from laughing so hard.      The movie was funny, uplifting, and had themes about the differences between USA culture on the east and west coast, about the way we sometimes prejudge folks based on their appearance, and about our motives for doing the things we do.

078401213X|5.0|It is a remarkable surprise that, in a time of science fiction and fantasy films which continually strive do outdo each other in pyrotechnics, one of the best science fiction films I've seen is a little black & white masterpiece that was shot with a $60,000 budget.  Darren Aronofsky, writer and director of 'PI', has created a film that is every bit as engaging as its 'big' brothers - in reality, even more so.<br />Mathematician Max Cohen (Sean Gullette) is on a quest.  He is convinced that underlying the chaos of the stock market is a pristine order, a mathematical rule with which he can prove that everything can be reduced to numbers.  His mentor and teacher is Sol Robeson (Mark Margolis), who was forced to give up his own investigations into PI when he suffered a mysterious stroke.<br />Cohen's investigation takes him far beyond the gyrations of the stock market into the mystical Kaballah and an intense questioning of the basic nature of reality.  His tool for this journey is the silent, inanimate computer, Euclid, who seems to deconstruct Cohen's universe further with each strike of the return key.  Even when Robeson urges Cohen to take a break from a quest which is clearly destroying the mathematician, torturing him with horrific headaches and hallucinations, Max is unable to stop.  He is drawn step by step into the irrevocable gap between the sacred and the mundane.<br />Made with reversal film which heightens the contrast between light and dark, the film provides a continuous flow of symbolic content which plays in harmony with the world of ideas from with it is drawn.  Ants and electric drills, computer chips and the swirls of cream in a cup of coffee all seem to have otherworldly referents.  Aronofsky and Gullette, by some strange archaic alchemy have managed to create the seeming of layer after layer of possible meaning.  To me the film itself becomes a non-repeating pattern where chaos mimics reality.<br />This film satisfies on many levels, starting with a question, finding an answer, and then discovering the next question.  It is visually brilliant.  Film director Matthew Libatique proves himself a genius, and Matthew Maraffi's production design is amazing.  Euclid is created out of scrap and loose parts, but manages to take on a full life of its own.  The acting is simply perfect.  This is a film for late night coffee house conversations, appealing to both the paranoid and the believer.<br />Notable additional contents of the DVD are two full length commentaries on the film one by Aronofsky and the other by Gullette.  There is a section of outtakes, the film trailers and some other miscellany.  Much recommended.h a question, finding an answer, and then discovering the next question.  It is visually brilliant.

0345440757|1.0|This book was mostly a total waste of time. I am the mother of three children.  This book was given to me as a gift and at first held my interest.  But then I realized that this woman was getting paid big bucks for stuff that I already knew and had used and am using with all my children. Example: How many new moms talk to their babies like they are just lumps?  None that I know! I would have loved to have seen Tracy with my first son!(now 6 years old.) He had a mind of his own even at a few days old. He would have challenged a lot of her ideas!  I know, because I tried them! (and I didn't even have her book!) Babies aren't as cut and dried as she wants new parents to believe.  So please! Save your money and use your own commonsense.
B000003TA4|5.0|This album is a piece of art. People say this album has no meaning...They shouldlisten to Something in The Way which is about Kurt sleeping under a bridge after being kicked out of the house. This was revolution. It gave rock a kick in the butt. It voiced a generation ignored by Michael Jackson. Its incredible. Kurt's voice isn't poppy, but raw, powerful, and sincere. This is one for the ages.
0812548094|5.0|I loved the first book, and I loved this 2nd book -- Terry has a great imagination -- totally amazing the things he can think of, the pictures he can paint -- how you are there just as if you were watching a movie and you know, see, feel what's going on.<br />Like the first book, I couldn't put it down - I simply devoured this book and happily went on to the next one!  I bet you do too.<br />Happy reading! :-)<br />-- Nancy
B000051VWW|5.0|Other observers here are right in saying that neo-soul wouldn't be what it is today without Sade first setting the standard in the 80s and early 90s. One would assume that Lovers Rock, her comeback album after 8 years, would ape the style that she influenced (heard and seen especially in the likes of India.Arie and Erykah Badu), so it says a lot that the album actually transcends neo-soul altogether, lifting Sade into a genre unto herself as the album smoothly blends R&amp;B, reggae, acoustic folk and even some hip hop. Few people know (unless they are into reggae) that lovers rock is actually a romantic sub-genre of reggae that influenced the sound of this album in a major way (although the title also works on a different level as a metaphor for the stability of love). Give credit to Sade and her superb combo that the style wasn't just grafted in and juxtaposed with their usual smooth soul, but fused with tremendous gracefulness, delicacy, and respect for the roots of the music. The result? Gorgeous songs that pay gentle tribute to the spirit of reggae in their beats (By Your Side, All About Our Love, Lovers Rock and especially Every Word), but stay true to the silky soulfulness for which Sade is famous. Now that the album just won the Grammy for Best Pop Album, it says a lot about the genre spanning reach of Sade: a SOUL singer winning a POP Grammy for an album named for a style of REGGAE is nothing short of amazing, but then, so is this album.

0688002307|5.0|In grade 12,  my English teacher was your quintessential eccentric.  Students either loved him or hated him.  He always said hate is closer to love than indifference, and given the choice he prefered to have students hate him than not care.  Indifference, he said, is the enemy of education<br />Before writing this review  I browsed through all 218 existing reviews of this book, and noticed that people have intense views--one way or the other--for ZMM  <br />When I first read this (assigned by that same grade 12 teacher) I hated it.  I was 17--what do you expect?  I picked it up 7 years later and something about the book  clicked for me; I couldn't put it down.  It remains one of the most influential book of my life<br />There's a lot of criticism of Pirsig in these reviews--he's a bad parent; he doesn't know anything about real philosophy;  he talks too much about philosophy; he's a hippie--and on it goes.  Some complain that the book ignores &quot;real&quot; philosophical values, or that it doesn't really talk about how to fix a motorcycle.  &quot;Real&quot; zen practitioners state Pirsig is not describing &quot;real&quot; zen.<br />Maybe it's just me, but I believe in things like literature and music, the most important criteria for  evaluation is whether or not you like it.  Clearly there's a wide range of opinion on both sides here.  If you're thinking of getting this book be prepared --you might loathe it.  If ZMM is required reading for a course you're taking  this is a virtual guarantee--I don't think this is a book that should be forced upon anyone.  <br />Remember, this book is a NOVEL--the author makes no claim he's writing a textbook on philosopy or that the facts in this story are 100% factual.  If you're going to read it it expect to have strong feelings one way or the other.  And if you do hate it, try to avoid personally attacking Pirsig --It is possible to hate a book without ascribing this fact to some deep  flaw in the author just because you didn't  happen to see the world his or her way.  I'd like to think that intelligent debate allows people to disagree without having to get personal, but apparently some of the reviewers here need some counselling to get over the fact that they were assigned this book in university, or that they just didn't like it.  <br />Personally, I hate wrestling and Barbra Streisand movies and can't understand why anyone would want to watch either--but apparently people do.  It's a wide world out there--with still more than one way of seeing things (I hope).
B000001DYY|5.0|Coming off from the aural sonic bliss of the Seeds Of Love and surviving the departure of Curt Smith, Tears For Fears frontman Roland Orzabal has managed to pull off a masterpiece that stood as his best solo outing for eight years before Tomcats Screaming Outside toppled it. This album is sort of like The Seeds Of Love but this album is darker, far more pessismistic, and not as complex or colorful but it still ranks side by side with the Big Chair as my second favorite TFF album.<br />The title track kicks off this CD with a bang with a turbulent stormy ambient rock sound and a much darker feel than anything off their Seeds Of Love LP. The song starts off with chimes ringing and then it becomes a dance/rock track to make you get up on your feet and dance. Cold despite it's title is warmer and brighter than it's predecessor. Cold is a rock song to make you feel good with a fun melody and awesome beats. Break It Down Again was the sole top 40 hit off this album. It's a cool song with a beautiful melody, brilliant vocals, and cool acoustic guitars. I enjoy the snares at the beginning of the song. This song is probably the brightest song on this entire LP. We then mellow down with the dark grey cloudiness of Mr. Pessimist. I probably relate all to well with this song just simply from it's minor note feel with small amounts of major notes here and there. Mr. Pessismist is a very jazzy, moody song with electronic guitar sways in the distance and awesome bass hooks. Pessimist earns the crown as the best song on Elemental. This song is kind of like dark clouds racing across the sky with the sun desparately trying to break through the on the horizon. Dogs A Best Friends Dog is a hard rocking number that jolts you back up after the mellowness of Pessimist. Dogs is one song to crank up your stereo to. This song could have charted higher than Break It Down Again had it been released as a single. The song ends with a breeze sound effect introducing the next song. Fish Out Of Water is a more synthesized song with killer keyboards and a danceable. This song was a song that expressed Rolands grudge against his former bandmate Curt Smith. I hope Curt Smith doesn't get mad at me *giggles* but I love this song. Gas Giants is a dark almost New Agey almost interlude track with an airy feel and a cloudy day feel. Power is similar to Break It Down Again but this song is longer and better. This song is another great song. I love the synthesized voice blends in so well with the music, total contrast to the annoying computerized voice effects that have dogged a lot of todays popular music. I do enjoy the jazzy quiet part from 3:22 to 4:00. Brian Wilson Said made me buy this album. It starts off as a very 60s sound track for the first minute and 50 seconds. The song then becomes a very mellow jazzy song that could be played on a smooth jazz station. This song is beautiful.  Goodnight Song is a sad yet happy song that is somewhat similar to Advice For The Young At Heart. It has a similar drum loop although played on different drums. I believe Goosnight is a tribute to the people who attended his concerts over the years. This song almost made me cry with tears of joy. This song is very deep and emotional. Where the title track was a stormy beginning to this album Goodnight Song is like a mission completed and succeeded.<br />It's a pity that this marvelous album was eclipsed by the grunge movement back during it's release. It was great back in 1993 when it came out and today it is an absolute classic. This is no Big Chair. I doubt TFF will ever make another big Chair again. That task might as well be left to some future band who might follow in their footsteps. Fans of the Hurting and Big Chair LPs might not care much for Elemental but fans of The Seeds Of Love will love this album. This is an album that still is fighting for it's place in the annals of rock history.<br />Elemental took my breath away upon first listening back in 1994. Elemental has powerand edge that surpasses the 1995 follow-up Raoul & And The Kings Of Spain which somehow didn't quite match Elemental. This album maintained the crown as my favorite Roland solo album before Tomcats Screaming Outside finally overtook it. Get all of TFFs album and Tomcats Screaming Outside.wer and edge that surpasses the 1995 follow-up Raoul & And The Kings Of Spain which somehow didn't quite match Elemental.

B000051VWW|4.0|&quot;Lover's Rock&quot; unfolds its pleasures and rewards slowly but assuredly like one long dream. You wake up with a heart-ache, but not many distinct memories. Sade croons forlorn ballads of love and sorrow through a fog of dense late night cigarette smoke. It's the perfect couch lounge record, drawing minutes into hours with slow thick grooves and shades of guitars. It's R&amp;B, in liquid form, filtered of all excesses into a fluid work where everything works together to create a lasting mood and coherent impression, rather than unstable hit-and-misses. &quot;King of Sorrow&quot; revels in its melancholy depression, with Sade tugging at the heartstrings with perhaps the centerpiece of the album, if there was to be one. Pull the curtains close, get the lava lamp flowing, light the candles and listen to the Sade lullaby.

An enjoyable treat.
B000001F45|4.0|The songs are classic masterpiece in their 70s hey day, check out them like demons and wizard, Sweet lorraine, kiss of the spider woman, sweet lorraine, stealing, gypsy etc......what a goldies collection it is!<BR>this band is also good as Led Zeppelin, Purple, Black Sabbath in the 70s rock classic era. Long time ago the American journalist at the rolling stone Melissa Mills said that I will rather to commit suicide than listening to this band. Yes Melissa Mills was a fool poor journalist,....she didnt know how good this band is!<BR>In fact that URIAH HEEP sold out their albums/recordings worldwide 30 million albums !! well you know this now,....Is Uriah heep still a bad group ??? you should answer it by your selves! This band is a goldies!
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|This is my favourite elvis costello album. Just would like to correct previous reviewer in his revision of history, re elvis' appearance on SNL... (and you can verify this on the best of SNL CD.)  He goes into Less Than Zero, stops after a couple of bars and says &quot;I'm sorry, there's really no reason for us to play that song tonight&quot; then goes into Radio Radio.  not to be picky, but keep the legend alive by getting it straight.  jeesh!
0802136834|5.0|This is a very unbelievable true story of how a self centered, egotistical man uses women like he would use toilet paper. It gave me a whole new perspective on how women were valued solely on the proformance of they reproductive systems.  Henry's wives were used as royal breeding machines to produce a male heir for him. When they could not accomplish that task they were conveniently gotten rid of. It is a sad yet startling book. Weir gives the reader a real feeling of being there experiencing all the events. Sometimes a little to real for my liking.
B00000IQC8|5.0|The best movie ever.  I think we wore out our VHS tape -  we were so glad to purchase the DVD.  The dialog is superb.
B000003N7Y|5.0|You know, people always talk about Mingus's Columbia albums, but to me this is amazing music that ranks right up there. I love<BR>this record. Beautiful music. It's a rollercoaster of emotion. From the lovely \\"I X Love\\" to the in yo face \\"Hora Decubitus\\". If you want to turn somebody on to the beauty and complexity of jazz, and Mingus to be precise, have them pick this [p]ucker up!
B000062TU1|4.0|I saw the movie the first day it came out. It was very good, but it was a tiny bit disapointing. The movie stayed close to the book, but a few things were diversioned and MANY things were left out. The DVD will have all the deleted scenes and hopefully the entire directors cut! The Harry Potter website says there will be 10 minutes of never before seen stuff, but I don't belive that. This will also have some very cool special features. I think the good theaterical realease will make a GREAT DVD!
B00000JMQC|5.0|Most people think that Oz ended when Dorothy clicked her heals together three times and said \\"There's no place like home\\". Little do they know that L. Frank Baum and other authors wrote Dorothy, Toto and friends in to 40 more adventures in Oz. Return to Oz is based on the next two books after The Wonderful Wizard of Oz(The Marvelous Land of Oz and Ozma of Oz). This wonderful adaption starts when Dorothy is back in Kansas. Although Dorothy is happy to be back with Uncle Henry and Aunt Em, there is still an empty spot in her heart for her friends in Oz. Dorothy can't stop thinking about Oz and this leads her to loose sleep. Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are sure the cyclone that carried Dorothy to Oz made her delusional. They think the only way to make Dorothy forget these sily fantasies is to take her to get shock treatment. Once at the clinic she meets doctor J.B. Worley who tells her the treatment won't hurt a bit. After the interview, Aunt Em returns home leaving Dorothy to stay at the clinic over night for treatment. Later that night, Dorothy is taken into one of the rooms for treatment. When the doctor is about to push down the switch, a lightning storm hits and the power is out. As all the doctors leave the room to check the power, Dorothy is rescued by Ozma, the princess of Oz who(in this world) only Dorothy can see. Before they are out the front door, Nurse Wilson sees them and persuses them all the way to a river. Ozma tumbles in leaving Dorothy to belive she has drowned. Dorothy climbs into a crate and heads down stream. Once in Oz with her now talking pet chicken Ballina, Dorothy starts out from the deadly desert to find the famous Yellow Brick Road broken, the Emerald City a mess and all the citizens, including the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion, turned to stone. Dorothy goes on to meet many new friends like Tik-Tok(the clockwork man), the Gump(a creature Dorothy and her friends created that is a mooses head attached to a sofa) and Jack Pumpkinhead. Togetherwith  Dorothy's pet chicken Ballina, They venture together to conquer Mombi(a witch who choses one of her 31 heads to wear each day), the Wheelers(the nasty servants of Mombi) and the Nome king who has enslaved the Scarecrow(the current ruler of the Emerald City) and turned him into an ornament. This movie, made by Disney, features amazing claymation and an amazing cast including the unbelivable 10 year old Fairuza Balk in a better portrayal of Dorothy than Judy Garland(I do think though that Judy is unforgettable in her portrayal), Piper Laurie as a stunning Aunt Em that seems to have jumped from the pages of the book, Jean Marsh as the well acted part of Nurse Wilson and Mombi and Nicol Williamson in his amazing portrayal of doctor J.B. Worley and the Nome King. The plot is closely based to the books and ventures to the darker yet unforgettable side of Oz. The story may be a bit scary for younger children but still enjoyable. You will not be disappointed with the this version of Oz. Of course how could you be? It's got a great cast, amazing claymation, great scenes, great plot, and it's made by Disney. If I could, I'd give this movie 1,000 stars. Enjoy your Return to Oz.
080019683X|5.0|I absolutely loved Fly Away Home. I know some people may think I'm being overly generous by giving this movie a five star rating, but the movie is just so heart-warming and original that it deserves all the praise it can get. This movie is a great family movie. It has elements of childish wistfulness and it incorporates the beauty of nature into a story about courage and love. Also, aside from the general plot, the cinematography is exquisite. The nature scenes look like they've been plucked right out of National Geographic. Also, the underlying theme song about flying away is strikingly emotional. Thumbs up!!!
B0000028RR|5.0|This is the best album I have ever bought. I've had it 4 years and it still makes me cry. Theres no point in analyzing every track - thay all get 10/10. Zack de la Rocha spits truth like no other, and Morello is more than able. This is a politically charged modern masterpiece. Do yourself a favour though, and by this one last, because otherwise the other Rage discs will seem just 99%, when even Evil Empire is better than most music about.
B000002HMH|5.0|Load is possibly the most scrutinized heavy metal album of the last decade. I don't think any other has achieved such a love-hate situation, and those that love or hate it are quick to examine every little detail about the album to justify their position in the pathetically continuing debate. <br /> I'm going to say right up front that I liked Load a lot. In fact, I wouldn't even say I prefer Metallica's pre-Black album material over it because they're both completely different styles. The album takes a few listens to get into, but after you listened to it may be twice or three times, you realize it really isn't that terrible. After all, Load is not a heavy metal album, nor does it try to be. It's more of a bluesy grunge type album obviously influenced by bands like Alice In Chains. There's also a little of what sounds like Dookie-era Greenday thrown in, giving the album that rather commercial sound. <br /> The actual music here is all around solid. The best songs include Ain't My B#tch with its intentionally goofy lyrics and good riff, 2x4 with its swaggering groove and all around catchy tune, House That Jack Built, King Nothing (which is like a beefed up Enter Sandman), Bleeding Me, and the largely instrumental Outlaw Torn with its clever (almost cinematic) riff and excellent song structuring. <br /> Now, I'm going to describe a few thoughts on this so-called \\"debate.\\" I think a lot of people have a very (and I stress this term greatly) UNNATURAL hatred towards this particular album. They see how a lot of people didn't like it, so they force themselves to dislike it because they're ashamed that they may actually be enjoying it. Then they try to cover it up with such statements as \\"Well, they weren't playing what was in their hearts at the time,\\" or \\"They cut their hair and went alternative, therefore it [stinks].\\" Not everybody who bashes this album is like that, but a lot of people are. True, calling Load a heavy metal album is completely wrong, but calling it \\"N*Sync with guitars\\" or \\"The worst piece of music ever released\\" is definitely a little on the extreme side.<br />In brief, give the album a fair shot before you trash it. There's plenty of good music to keep any fan WILLING to enjoy it satisfied, as well as enough (apparently hidden) innovation/creativity to keep it interesting.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This is a great DVD. My 6 year old daughter seemed a little bored with it though. i think it appeals more to adults who have seen it a long time ago.
B000007WNN|5.0|I've been a cult fan for about eight months now. Ever since I bought PURE CULT I've been in love with them and since then have bought every album they have. This album, ELECTRIC is definately one of the best out there today. I've listened to this album way too many times and yet it refuses to die! Astbury has a one of a kind voice that you never get tired of. From screaming at the top of his lungs and little squeals to hilarious lyrics and poses The Cult are my all-time favourite band. I listen to them almost religiously every single day. There are so many albums to choose from you just don't know what to play next. ELECTRIC is definately a favourite for now and years to come! If you want heavy sounding boogy music well you got it! FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY!!!!!!

6305807086|5.0|This movie is amazing! I have seen it 5 times and it gets better every time I see it. Spike Jonze is a truly talented director (Can you believe that this was his first film? Wow...). The screenplay by Charlie Kaufman is brilliant and very original. John Cusack, Cameron Diaz, Catherine Keener, and John Malkovich all give great performances (Why weren't Diaz and Malkovich nominated for Oscars???). The DVD has great picture and sound, and it's full of great extras. If you haven't seen this film, I strongly encourage you to rent it. Actually, don't even rent it, just buy it. I guarantee you won't regret it.
B00005K9LM|3.0|First off, this album deserves 5 stars. It is truly one of the best metal albums of all time. The reason I gave it a 3 star rating is because of the sub-standard remastering job, which is proof that Sony just wanted to cash in on JP one last time before they disappeared. 'The Sentinal' and 'Freewheel Burning' are the worst, as far as sound quality goes. 'Sentinel' sounds like the tape head was dirty during playback, 'Freewheel' sounds like master tape got wrinkled at the beginning of the song. Overall, the whole CD sounds like it was mastered from a cassette tape that had been sitting under a car seat for a few years. I pulled out my 15+ year old vinyl copy of the album and it sounded better than this so called &quot;remaster&quot;. Just as a side note, I also have the remastered &quot;Screaming for Vengeance&quot; and it sounds far better than this one. I'm curious to find out what other people think of the rest of the remasters. I probably would have them all by now if I wasn't so disappointed in 'Defenders'.

Each new reading brought a new laugh during a dire time...Vonnegut's selective vision and point of view are timeless, every bit as cherished now as three decades ago. If his story telling style doesn't grab you, certainly the artwork will in this, what I consider to be KVJ's greatest achievement.<BR>B of C will make a collector out of you.
630587493X|4.0|Finding a film that is entertaining for adults AND children is a challenge but Bicentennial Man was a perfect choice for &quot;movie night&quot; with my husband and two children (ages 9 and 6).  Previous reviews said the movie was too deep for children, but so what, my kids didn't notice how deep the movie was because they are kids.  They were captivated in the movie from start to finish.  We laughed, we cried.  It was a wonderful film that entertained ALL of us--and it is rare to find a movie that keeps my husband glued to the screen as well as my children.  All in all, it is a great film for the entire family.  <BR>One small note--I rented the DVD and was disappointed in the bonus material.  I was hoping for more of the behind-the-scenes, fun stuff we've come to expect from DVD's.  The movie itself, though, is great.

B000001GXL|3.0|These two concertos, particularly no 3, do not seem to me to suit Michelangeli the way the Emperor suits him. Without a doubt there are some very striking and unique touches -- in the marvellous first-movement cadenza of no 1 the piling-up of the tone and the clashing seconds are particularly effective. M's first entry in the same movement is also striking, though whether it is striking for the right reasons is another matter. He plays his left hand markedly before the right, an effect that can be absolutely sublime in, say, Chopin's prelude op 45 or the slow movement of the Ravel concerto, but which is surely a bit odd in this particular context. Apart from that, although the piano-playing is predictably perfect beyond perfection I can't really feel that M has a lot to say about either of these pieces.<br />No 3 in particular is surely rather average. For comparisons in no 1 I am probably too out-of-date to want to make suggestions and it looks as if there is no shortage of good options, but no 3 is another matter. In spite of a slight sense of incongruity in his pairing with Bernstein, Serkin gives the performance of the first movement to end all performances. The speed is genuinely Allegro con Brio, Serkin digs into the scales at his first entry like a man possessed and follows them with a hushed awestruck reaction and an account of the movement as a whole that is in a class of its own not just for drama but for the humane feel about it. The other two movements, while less spectacular, seem to me just right. On this occasion I don't get much charge out of Michelangeli, greatly though I admire him in other settings.
B00005NOOH|5.0|I could not emphasize enough the quality and quantity of this DVD selection since many other reviewers have done so much more eloquently in their many rave reviews. <br />My sui generis point is that Amazon should reserve a rare sixth star for works like this! <br />Also, I must state that having looked for this DVD series for years (I wisely passed up the early 1990's clunky VHS version), I wondered why has there been a haitus of three years between the first announcements of a DVD version and its final pub date? I can only assume that re-mastered films and the many wonderful extra features must have taken time to assemble as value-added bonuses -- which indeed they are. Twenty-six hours of the finest that television has ever produced! It should be the first DVD purchased by anyone interested in history. <br />It should also get a rare Amazon sixth star.
B00005RFAI|5.0|Hey, I gotta say, I was a bit skeptical about buying this disk, cause I am more into melodic music. But, I really liked the song &quot;Get the Party Started&quot;, so thought I would try it. Pink has a voice that is just awesome. This girl could go to any music genre she chooses and do whatever she wants. What a voice. Up there with the Stevie Nicks of the music world...if not a little higher! Go Girl!
B00005R23S|5.0|When this concert was on HBO, we had a Tri-State area reunion party for neighbors in South Carolina.  This DVD has more cuts than the original HBO special. FANtastic. I wish I had been in MSG for one of those shows!  Having seen Bruce several times live, I guess I will have to settle for this, but it is a great collection and a must have for any Springsteen fan. The audio video quality is why I went DVD. This one sees more play time than any other DVD I own. You don't have to be from NJ to love this one. IT ROCKS.
B00000K19E|5.0|I first saw this movie when it came out on DVD. The first time I saw it, I became flustered. It's was very confusing, but the graphics and special effects were excellent. The more times you see it, the more it will begin to make sense.<br />Neo (Keanu Reeves) plays a computer hacker, when one day Trinity comes and takes him to Morpheus, the head leader of &quot;the matrix.&quot; Morpheus tests Neo both physically and mentally as well. The Matrix is a world where nothing is real, just your imagination makes you believe it's real. Neo goes on an adventure, which is absolutley thrilling. Whether it the cool, Kombat Training, or going to the Oracle- the Matrix has it all- Suspense, Action, and pure Imagination.<br />I recommend this movie to people who like action/thriller movies.
B0000027RL|5.0|Look. I know that Pearl Jam started ruffling people's right wing feathers soon after they became too popular.  Jeez, excuse them for their success. And God forbid if they actually  expressed their \\"left\\" opinions through their songs. That's the real reason it suddenly became uncool to like Pearl Jam. That all said, most people realize that TEN is the real deal.  Late 1991, early 1992.  It was new.  It had balls. It was loud. It was powerful.  TEN was happening.  People were falling over themselves in line trying to buy it at Tower Records when CD's told LP's to \\"get outta the store (see, it hasn't been that long!)! <BR>I don't know if it's as relevant anymore in this new millenium of  terrorist-instigated heightened security and ENRON ripoff mania.  But the bottom line is that this album still sounds and feels good.  Listen again.  The ... is timeless.

0140186395|5.0|I read this book quite quickly, in about a week, for school. I found that it was very entertaining and that it shows the depths of evil possible. There are two sides in this book. Evil and good. The evil is shown in characters like Cathy and Caleb. How? Well, you'll have to read the book to find out. I can ruin it for you, though. All I have to say is that this book has sex and whores, farms and pidgin talk, lies and lies, sins and naiveness.<br />The main character is the towering Adam Trask, whom I think is too gullible. Why? You can figure that out by reading the book. I recommend it. It's quite long though.
0393317552|4.0|This book is everything the book-jacket reviewers(a group not selected for their negative impressions)say it is: important and fascinating. I was intrigued and educated and am glad I read it.<br />I only learned of the book because it was this month's assignment for our book club. Unfortunately, several of our members did not finish it, because they early on became bogged down in redundancies, repetition and endless enumerations and textbook-like lists. And there was a whole lot more about New Guinea than most of us need or want to know.<br />I have convinced the non-finishers to give it another chance.  Read every third paragraph or so if you must, or concentrate on the last two sections, resting assured that Professor Diamond has pretty well proved his assumptions of what are termed &quot;ultimate causes.&quot;<br />I really recommended this book to the lay reader (like me) because of what it has to say, not because it is particularly well-written.  Give it  try.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I think it's outrageous that Alicia Keys managed to win 5 grammy awards, and India Arie won none! Arie's album is much, much much stronger with constant cool laid back vibes!<BR> She has a soulful voice, which reminds me of some classic Motown artists. The song's have more depth and strength than Keys', BUY THIS!!!!
B00005R87Q|3.0|First, I'll confess to being a middle aged average male &quot;shmoe&quot; so you know where I'm coming from. <BR>      For the action, this film was mostly what one would expect. For the most part, the cars and the racing were pretty good. The 4 car street race was intense and the photography was excellent on that.  On the other hand, some of the special effects were really poorly done. For example, if a car left the road (except for the last scene), it stopped so quickly and with so little damage that it was flagrantly OBVIOUS that the action was really going on at maybe 30 mph, not the high speeds consistent with the action/plot.  This was so bad, it makes one wonder if they forgot to hire someone to keep an eye on continuity. <BR>       The other main criticism I had is aside from the first and last race scenes, all the other fast car scenes to me seemed far too similar and got rather boring, frankly.  <BR>       On the other hand, I didn't expect to get ANY decent acting or character development out of this. Vin Diesel was a standout bright spot.  Here you have a supposedly really bad, dangerous, criminal who is clearly spiritual, thoughtful, plays fair, and who only became a criminal because of a sudden life shattering event, and the all-too-human mistake he made in the wake of that event.  Although he is now a career criminal in the wake of the tragedy and his punishment (and the severe limitation the consequences put on his life choices FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE), it is clear his victims suffer no permenant damage, aside from financial.   <BR>       With the &quot;rogue cop&quot; tendencies of the protagonist, it left me thinking first, how easy it could be for ANY of us to become a &quot;criminal&quot; in a flash of emotion in a time of crisis to a horrible event, and second asking &quot;who is TRULY the protagonist here?&quot;<BR>       So to me, this movie reminded me of lot of the surprise I received in &quot;Fight Club&quot; expecting generic brand X action, and getting some actual CONTENT to think about as well. <BR>......<BR>       Oh, by the way, if you're under 21, like hot cars and pretty girls - you'll certainly like this. Don't let all this &quot;philosophy&quot; scare you off!     :)
B00004Z459|5.0|This CD is by far my favourite. When I bought it I couldn't take it out of my CD player! I like their blend metal and rap. Chester and Mike have amazing voices!<br />My favourite songs are A Place For My Head, In The End, and Crawling. Out of those I would say In The End is the best because of its softer sound and lots of rap. <br />This is way better than any of those bands out there. They don't copy people (coughlimpbizkitcough), they have their own unique sound.<BR>1 thing for next album. MAKE IT LONGER!!!<br />It doesn't matter what type of music you like, this CD is for everyone!!! Go and buy it!!!
B00005QG9J|3.0|I read a lot of good reviews about this cd in here, in fact i've read a lot of excellent reviews in here about this album, so i said to myself that i gotta have it, for atleast having 1 Incubus album. and i got it.<BR>From the first song, 'Nice to Know You', i thought it's gonna be a great album because 'Nice to Know You' is a great song, probably my favorite on the cd. I especially like the pre-chorus in this song. so i was excited as it was over and moved to the rest of the tracks. I was dissapointed. I didn't really 'got-in' to the songs. besides 'Nice to know you', i liked also 'Wish You were here', '11 AM', 'Mexico', 'Warning', 'Echo', 'Under My Umbrella'. These are decent/good songs but not even close to excellent. Don't get me wrong, i'm a fan of alt. rock music but this album just dissapointed me, a lot. and what's the big deal with song #6, 'Blood on the Ground'? I think it's one of the worst songs on the cd, but it seems that 90% of the reviewers in here think else. So shortly: an ok album, catchy and repetive lyrics. still i wouln't buy it. I glad i didn't. Incubus sold-out.
B000009HF2|4.0|When I go back and listen to this, I ask myself, \\"doesn't the crowd noise sound like my $125 midi keyboard?\\" This may have been recorded live, but the \\"vibe\\" from the audience seems so obviously \\"sweetened\\" to me. When this first came out, midi and digital or analog sampling were probably new innovations and we were naive enough to fall for it. But we're all more sophisticated these days, and it's clear that the live audience \\"gimmick\\" was brilliantly engineered. I don't have a big problem with this... it's like the t.v. laugh track... but reviewers here who gush about the audience \\"vibe\\" might want to question whether they've been duped. I've been to lots of concerts and the audiences never sound like a midi keyboard and they never sound perfectly synchronized with the music, and some [one] always yells \\"Freebird!!!\\" or something like that, and you won't hear that on this CD.
B00005QIPH|3.0|I'm not sure why some people thought The Strokes were going to be the next best thing in the music scene. I just heard of them through friends, and I decided to give the cd a listen. The first 4 or 5 songs completely blended together and I couldn't tell them apart. The second half of the cd struck me as more unique, but when I was done listening (it didn't take long, only 35 minutes), I didn't feel as if The Strokes were anything special. Some of the songs (i.e., &quot;Alone Together&quot;, &quot;Last Nite&quot;, and &quot;Trying My Luck&quot;) are fun, but nothing more. The Strokes are just an average band experiencing their moment of fame.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Doing a review of a film like A BEAUTIFUL MIND is taxing because much of its impact comes from plot twist that, unless you know the life of John Nash (which I did not), will radically reorient your view of Nash.<br />I encourage you to do two things. First, see this very powerful film.<br /><br />Next, don't read any reviews until after you see the movie. Most have a (necessary) spoiler which drastically weakens first viewing.<br /><br />The film opens with John Nash just attending Princeton in the late 1940s. He is a mathematician looking for that one \\"original idea,\\" which will distinguish him from his fellow students. Nash finds his idea when a group of prospective dates arrive at a local pub. His thesis radically departs from one hundred years of economic theory.<br /><br />The film deals with this quickly and efficiently, because (and lets be honest here) we didn't come for lessons in economic theory. After he writes his thesis, his professor thinks its brilliant and then the film jumps five years into the future. John Nash has begun working at an institution, where he is contacted by the government to help them fight Communism.<br /><br />John Nash meets his wife Alicia (Jennifer Connelly). There is a very poignant moment in the movie where they are outside the governor's mansion on the terrace when John and her are looking into the sky. Nash tells her to pick any shape at all in the sky and he will find it. She finds this delightfully romantic. It's not so romantic, however, when she later discovers her husband has schizophrenia his tendency of discovering patterns has led him into believing he is doing classified government work.<br /><br />The viewer is unsure whether Nash having schizophrenia is a conspiracy against him or the actual truth. Part of this film's brilliance is putting the audience in Nash's position. Being unsure yourself whether he is having disillusions or not makes you very sympathetic toward Nash. Living in a time of conspiracy theory andgovernment cover-ups, I kept siding with Nash. You can feel his terror as his world comes crumbling down as he discovers whole areas of his life as not being dead or gone forever, as Nash's psychologist Dr. Rosen says, but never existing in the first place.<br /><br />If you are familiar with Nash's life or you have been reading reviews of the movie and know Nash is mentally ill, this very powerful part loses most of its impact. A BEAUTIFUL MIND is a better film not for Nash aficionados (if there is such a thing) but for those who nothing about him.<br /><br />His wife helps him through this very tough time in his life. This illness produces a great amount of stress on his marriage. The love and support of his wife is what gets him through his illness, and without her Nash would have spiraled out of control. While a beautiful mind is a true blessing, Nash learns that his smarts won't solve this problem. It's the connection with his wife, the power of the human heart that will keep his life balanced and ordered.<br /><br />A BEAUTIFUL MIND is a testament to the support and love of two people for one another. \\"Chick flicks\\" have nothing on the powerful statement A BEAUTIFUL MIND makes about love and commitment.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|This is one of the WORST of \\"good\\" movies of all time!  Just the sight of Nicole Kidman lipcynching to \\"Like A Virgin\\" and poor, brilliant old Jim Broadbent lipsynching his way through some 90s dance tune was enough to turn my stomach.  WHat were people thinking??!!  How did the creators succeed in pitching this movie to the studio?  As far as \\"good\\" movies go (meaning, well made and big budget with lots of support from the critics), this ranks right up there \\"A Clockwork Orange\\" and \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\"! It is truly horrible.  Painful to sit through.  If you want a movie musical, pick almost anything else in the whole wide world.  Definitely pass on this one.
6304806426|5.0|Superb acting( three oscar nominations:Fiennes, Scott Thomas,Binoche, the three main characters),outstanding musical score,breathtaking cinematography,perfect editing,excellent art direction and costumes,outstanding direction, are all present in this movie.<BR>When I saw this movie for the first time in 1996 ,a few months prior to it's winning  a lot of awards ,I thought that it had   been a while since I had seen a movie of this caliber.<BR>I sincerely recommend it without reservations.
B00005JHAD|4.0|With the recent glut of similar cockney gangster movies that followed in the wake of 'Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels', Guy Ritchie is back to prove that he really is the master of this genre.  Okay so the plot involving a diamond heist and a boxing ring may not exactly be world-class but it's milked for all it's worth with several fantastic characters.  Maybe it's Ritchie's management of an ensemble cast that should really be applauded here.<br />'Snatch' is obviously geared more towards the American market than his previous movie, with the addition of Brad Pitt and a relatively small role for Benicio Del Toro.  The rest of the cast consists of various British actors, and there's even an appearance from jungle artist Goldie.  However, it is Brad Pitt that really steals the film in his best performance to date as an incomprehensible Irish gypsy.  Of course Vinnie Jones pops up again in yet another of his stereotypical roles, but he's still very funny so who's complaining?  It's depiction of hard gangsters and wannabe gangsters also fits in surprisingly well with the movie's artier tendences.  For instance, slow motion is used to great effect and the camera work for the fight scenes is genuinely inspired.<br />Finally though, 'Snatch' is absolutely hilarious with its quickfire conversation that doesn't patronise its audience.  Ritchie sure doesn't pull any punches.
B00000I2PG|5.0|ABC, along with The Human League, were Sheffield England's greatest contribution to the New Romantic movement. They were a fabulous mix of glitz, pomp, beauty and imagination.<br />\\"The Lexicon of Love\\" has been described as \\"over-produced,\\" by none other than Trevor Horn, its producer! There may be some truth to this claim. But the production is intregal to its allure. The album is awash with strings, horns, and other classic sounds usually lacking from rock albums. This is the soundtrack to a trip across Europe by train (just like in \\"Mantrap,\\" ABC's short film by Julien Temple). It touches on most of the themes in life, and leaves the listener tingling. <br />Martin Fry's voice remains one of my favorites from the era. For a recent sample, see his wonderful cover of Tom Jones's <BR>\\"Thunderball\\" from the 1997 release Shaken and Stirred: The David Arnold James Bond Project.
B00003CXA2|5.0|There is not much more I can add to the 'positive' reviews written here about 'Forrest Gump'.  Tom Hanks is one of the greatest actors ever, and the rest of the cast as well.  This is, without a doubt, Robin Wright's finest role, and the magnificent Gary Sinese absolutely earned his Academy award.  Sally Field of course was wonderful as well, and let's give a little kudos to the actor who played Bubba!<BR>There were a few 'bad' reviews on this site about this movie.  Hey, everyone is entitled to their own opinion, BUT, I can't help but wonder what kind of borderline personality disorders these folks have for coming up with ANY KIND of negative perception/assesment of this film.  If you have only ONE DVD MOVIE in your collection, let it be this one.  It was PERFECTION.  And that's all I have to say about THAT!  ;)
B000001Y79|5.0|This album is completely great. I love almost every song, because all but 3 (&quot;The Climb,&quot; &quot;Don't Speak,&quot; and &quot;End It On This&quot;) all upbeat, fun, and full of pep. The bass and guitar parts are awesome, and Gwen delivers amazing vocals. Adrian, of course, keeps a steady drum beat going, as always. I think this was the last album Eric Stefani stayed for. I know how hard these songs can be to play. My band did a version of &quot;Spiderwebs,&quot; and I know how hard the bass and guitar parts were. My favorite songs on this album are &quot;Spiderwebs,&quot; &quot;Excuse Me Mr.&quot; &quot;Just A Girl,&quot; &quot;Happy Now?&quot; &quot;Sunday Morning,&quot; &quot;Don't Speak,&quot; and &quot;Tragic Kingdom.&quot; I love those songs, and the rest are very good, too. This is a very good buy. I highly recommend it.
B00005JKYS|5.0|This is an excellent movie.  (...)<br />I thought this movie was terribly moving but not a tissue box movie.  There is enough humor to keep you from bawling like a baby and the actors did a great job with the roles they played.  It's about time someone made a movie that wasn't politically based about Vietnam.  There were men there who have stories that need to be told to eliminate the large amount of fiction that circulates about 'Nam and this is a great start. (...)

B00005OM4N|5.0|In this latest cd, Britney seems to be expressing part of her true self. That she is coming of age as a woman, that she does not need to be so protected as if to shatter, that she has had her struggles in her rise to stardom and that she wants ppl to listen to her. That is the obvious thread that runs thru this cd. She may not have the vocal prowess as christina aguilera and others but she does have a unique voice that is so beautiful to listen to...<br />I really do believe that in every project that she gets herself into she really is conscientious of it and works hard at it... This being about to be woman will be here for a long time to come and I also believe she will be an icon.<br />There is nothing bad about any of the work that she has done so far I have two of her cds and listen to it constantly. I may even go see the movie!
0060930187|3.0|I had to read the Bell Jar for my English class and write a research paper on it. To be honest, reading it was not one of the most joyous times of my life. The book maily focuses on the depressing parts of Esther and her monotonous life. All throughout the book she is falling down on her knees and has not stregnth not get back up and face the world. She continually hides from people and does not show the true person she is. Esther has no self confidence and wishes to seduce the first man who comes across her path. She is a desperate person with little self moral. But, on a good note, Plath writes about her depression so descriptively, you actually feel like you are going down with Esther. I would not recommend this book to the person wishing to read something for fun, but for the more serious and mature reader. Reading a book for fun is what Harry Potter is for. Hope this helps alot!
B00005JKYS|5.0|\\"We Were Soldiers\\" is better than \\"Black Hawk Down\\" mainly because the characters were more fully developed and we actually care about what happened to them.  The combat scenes were as intense but I felt more engaged by the unfolding tragedy.  BHD is also a great war movie, but it seemed to rely on more special effects to create it's impact.  There is a review here that picks the movie apart, but I don't believe anyone will care about the small points the author is trying to make.  Who really cares if Col. Moore invented the tactics?  And it's always easy to criticize, after the fact, the tactics that were used in the battle.  It was a new type of warfare, and it was the first time those tactics were used to that extent.  What also made this an enjoyable movie is that it wasn't made from an ugly American type viewpoint.  The film makers actually believe there is something good and decent about America, and that shined through in the movie.  After what happened to this country on Sept. 11, we certainly needed it.
6303347657|2.0|This is a terrible, stupid movie. It is VERY sexist, violent, and one of Jim Carrey's most awful films. It is not for kids, even though I watched it and I saying 'ughh' the whole time. There are way to many gun scenes! It gives people the WRONG message. Save your evening for some other video, not this.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Before this album was cut I honestly had no idea who Howard Shore was. I was a bit disappointed; I had hoped John Williams was going to do the score and create another masterpiece like Star Wars or Harry Potter. I was wrong!<br />Howard Shore takes the world of Tolkien and brings it to life in this music. He brings aspects from many different countries-mostly Ireland but there is a hint of India even, in track 14, 'Lothlorien'. It is at times a very dark score but also lighthearted in another aspect-comparing 'Concerning Hobbits' with 'The Bridge of Kazad-Dum'. The voices play a magnificent part in bringing more life and volume to the songs. They almost want to make you cry at parts, specifically in 'The Bridge of Kazad-Dum'. Enya, one of my personal favorites, does another spectacular song in the haunting 'May It Be' and 'Anrion'.<br />Besides the music, I also liked the cover of the album. Inside there are the lyrics written in both Elvish and English, along with various pictures from the movie. There are random collector cards on the outside, which you can see when you buy it. (mine contains Aragorn) Not only is it a wonderful bargain but the music is beautiful. If this does not win the Oscar for Best Score I know many fans will be very angry.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|When I first bought a DVD player I was so dissapointed that this great movie was not published yet on DVD.  I have been waiting for it to be released.<br />It's hard to say enough about this great movie, great cast, wonderful music, and a great timeless story-line.  It is in my Top 5 favorite Disney movies of all time...
B000002ACR|5.0|Even though Fifth Dimension may be the most innovative album of the Byrds' career, Younger than Yesterday may be the most enduring.  Showing the influence of Pet Sounds and Revolver with more layered production (including great trumpet playing by Hugh Masakela) and increasingly sophisticated songs, the Byrds hit gold here.  Dave Crosby really steps up his songwriting here -- Crosby with the mournful &quot;Everybody's Been Burned&quot; and the beautiful &quot;Renaissance Fair&quot;.  (He also contributed the experimental &quot;Mind Gardens&quot;, which isn't quite as successful.)  Roger McGuinn comes up a little short though his 12-string playing on &quot;My Back Pages&quot;, one of their last Dylan covers, is unforgettable.<br />  But it is bassist Chris Hillman, a relatively minor composer on the first three Byrds albums, who ends up being the dominant creative force here.  In addition to writing or co-writing the infectious folk-rock double-knockout of &quot;Have You Seen Her Face&quot; and &quot;So You Want to Be a Rock &amp; Roll Star&quot;, he ventures into country (&quot;Time Between&quot;, &quot;The Girl With No Name&quot;) and unsettling psychedelia (&quot;Thoughts and Words&quot;).  These songs alone justify buying this CD.<br />  The original album was quite short (about 30 minutes), but this remaster of Younger than Yesterday includes several alternate takes and bonus tracks.  The best of these is Crosby's catchy, symphonic &quot;Lady Friend&quot;.<br />  Younger than Yesterday is up there with Revolver and the Piper at the Gates of Dawn as one of the highlights of 60s psychedelic rock.
B00005Y228|5.0|This cd is absolutely brilliant! Every song on here is tremendous, there are no fillers. Out of my vast cd collection, this is the only non-classical cd I can listen to every song on without torturing myself.<BR>You've probably heard Kylie's hit &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot; which is on here. It's a great song with a great feel to it. <BR>My absolute favorite song on here is her current single in Britain, &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;. This song also has a great feel to it, but is different than &quot;Can't Get You Out of My Head&quot;.<BR>This is a great upbeat cd to listen to. If you're in a bad mood or have had a bad day, the songs will lift your spirits with their beats. If you're in a good mood it is also great to listen to because it will just make your day better.<BR>I am a big Kylie fan and I was so excited when I heard she was releasing a single in the States. Congratulations Kylie on conquering the U.S. music scene and a great album! I highly, highly, highly recommond this album.
B00003Q43A|2.0|But it's a two star movie for me.  Hollywood serves up a big old helping of stupidity for it's audience.  Don't you people feel insulted when moviemakers assume you are so stupid that they can write a plot like this movie has?  If you keep paying to watch movies that pander to the lowest common denominator like this movie does, they will continue to make such pabulum. <br />How can you people give this movie 5 stars? That is the problem with Amazons rating system, people give anything they like a 5 star rating. This movie is not a 5 star movie.
B00005Y1Y3|5.0|A great sample of tunes from a variety of Doors shows in 1969 and 1970. Some of these will sound familiar as they are taken from shows that were featured on the 1970 'Absolutely Live' LP and 'Alive She Cried' from 1983. The disc kicks off with a good version of \\"Light My Fire\\" recorded in Philadelphia. The highlights though are songs that haven't been released live, especially \\"Been Down So Long\\" from the 'L.A. Woman' album that was released the same week Jim left us. Other highlghts are \\"Touch Me\\" and \\"The Crystal Ship\\" which also are not on previous live LP's. The version of \\"The End\\" is also good though not quite as strong as the one performed at the July 1968 Hollywood Bowl show (which closes out the 2CD 'In Concert' compilation). Future releases are forthcoming and will be available from the Doors' website which can also be accessed through 'rhino.com'.
1891252089|5.0|This is the only book you need to study the Primary series. I love the flat spine design. Every yoga book should be like this! Get David's videos so you can see the series in action. You should use this book as a supplement. You should take some classes and use this as your home study. Never try to teach yourself yoga from a book.
B00005JKYS|5.0|I haven't read the book that this movie is based on, so unlike reviewer Russell Ross, I have nothing to compare it to....<br /> Judged on it's own, We Were Soldiers is a tremendous movie, telling the story of 400 Air Cavalry Soldiers who spent three days waging a horrific battle with over 4,000 Vietnamese Soldiers. The courage and heart that our Soldiers displayed is wonderfully portrayed, and Mel Gibson does his usual great job as their Commanding Officer. (Sam Elliott is also great as his second-in-command...) We also get to see another, seldom-seen side of the Vietnam War- The Home Front, where wives and families lived in fear of a telegram from The Army...<br /> The movie's violence is VERY graphic, but war is hell, so....<br /> We Were Soldiers gives us another view of America's most unpopular War, and in this time of increased patriotism, it's a welcome view at that. Highly recommended!

B00005OWIU|5.0|John Williams is nominated for an oscar for his score of \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\\"  This music is great, you can actually feel the emotion.  I hope John Williams does the score for the other Harry Potter movies.
B00005JKYS|5.0|we were soldiers is the beest film ever  made  wow god bless
B00005UEAR|5.0|I'm a music fanatic, and a Dream Theater fanatic.  They never cease to amaze me.  The musical complexity is yet again astounding.  This is a fabulous album.  I'm going to see them in concert on December 11th in Denver.  This will be my 3rd time to see them live.  Let me tell you, the album is great, but seeing them live is unreal.  Buy this CD!
B000002TWN|5.0|When everyone thought that r&b had fallen, out of the shadows came young talented D'angelo. When there were simply just booty shaking, meaningless club songs, there came D'angelo with a sound of pure soul that can only be referred to great r&b singers like Barry White, Al Green, and Marvin Gaye. Using his smoothe methods like rythm and rhyme mixed with accousic melodys and timeless music. This cd only has ten tracks but truthfully all of them are  great to listen to unlike new artists who have about sixteen tracks and only about four are even sort of worth listening to. D'angelo uses all of the music elements to his advantage his voice, instrumentals, and a pure soul vibe to every track, not to mention his use of storytelling and a mix of the blues. <BR>    D'angelo is truly one of the few artist who could make any subject sound good, ... \\"Brown Sugar\\" are to getting revenge on a cheating wife and  your so called best freind in the track ..., or even just the simple subject of preaching about how much you love that special girl in the track \\"Lady\\". <BR>    I strongly reccomend it to people who love smoothe laid back soul singers like Lauryn Hill, Carl Thomas, Jill Scott ect. Although this cd was released about six years ago it is still superior to most music today. Take my word for it and hear this, no listen to this, no feel this, better yet love this.
B00005ARDC|3.0|We've heard this before. Black Rebel Motorcycle Club's eponymous debut album is ridden with late 80s/early 90s indie cliches: wall of sound guitar playing, fuzzy vocals, fade in introductions: the whole lot. All this makes the album very easy to hate.<br />That is of course, if you ignore the glaring fact that BRMC have tunes. They may not possess the greatest amount of innovation, but their retro sounds have a certain glamour about them, and the influences the album bring to mind are ones that haven't been unearthed by new bands for a while. My Bloody Valentine, Jesus and Mary Chain, Ride and the Stooges (no prizes for guessing the odd one out) are all in here. However, so are BRMC themselves, in Spread Your Love with its relentless bassline, Love Burns with its repetitive, jump up and down chorus and the mellower Too Real with its psychedelic, intoxicating sound.<br />It does sound good, and it does take the best aspects of its influences, but its not going to knock you off your seat unless you've never heard a MBV song before. 3 stars.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This movie is one of the greatest movies i've ever seen because its sad,touching,violent,and depressing to see.I recommend that everyone watches this movie because its good.
B00004XQ83|5.0|There's not a dud to be found anywhere on this superlative album.  It's a joy to listen to whether or not you've seen the movie (although having seen the movie does lend richness to the listening experience, as you understand what drama was happening onscreen while the song was being played--&quot;Down in the River to Pray&quot; is an especially spine-tingling example).  Gillian Welch should be singled out for her fine work here, as she sings a knee-thumping rendition of &quot;I'll Fly Away&quot; with Allison Krauss and then melds beautifully with both Krauss and Emmylou Harris on the chilling &quot;Didn't Leave Nobody But the Baby.&quot;  Even goofy Delmar (played by actor/director Tim Blake Nelson) lends his voice to the album, singing a funny, down-in-the-mouth &quot;In the Jailhouse Now.&quot;  Too bad George Clooney, with all his great vocal genes, couldn't do the first version of &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow,&quot; but Allison Krauss' Union Station bandmate Dan Tyminski acquits himself with flying colors.

B000059S9M|5.0|This is a great album and i recommend it to any one.  People who like hard rock, people who like soft rock, and people who like pop rock, will love this album... I'm glad i found out about the band, because they make some great music. I thoroughly recommend buying this album.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|I personally adore this movie. I've seen it over 40 times, and I saw the play twice. This movie is beautiful and funny. I think it's a shame that we have to wait untill October for it to be released on DVD. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who has never seen it. The songs are great. My favorites are \\"Belle\\", \\"Be Our Guest\\", and \\"Beauty and the Beast\\". This movie brightens up your day. It is one of the best movies ever.
B00005JL5S|5.0|Stephen Chow has made one of the finest comedies ever to come from Hong Kong. A supreme blend of Kung Fu action, excellent special effects, cracking gags, visual hilarity and lets not forget soccer! It all adds up to Grandstand meets Matrix meets Tom & Jerry.<br />Although it is heavily laden with special effects these in no way hinder the movie, they only serve to add and reinforce it. This is a rare occasion where they could have had more special effects. <br />If you want to see a unique comedy, then look no further than Shaolin Soccer! PS. See the directors cut on DVD, for some reason some of the funniest jokes were cut out?
6303823351|5.0|I laughed myself sick at this movie! The Beatles' performances are fab. You really get a bit of a glimpse of what the Beatles were really like. The supporting characters like Professor Foot, Clang, Ahme, Algernon, and the Superintendent are just as great too.<br />The Fabs are as cheeky and charming as ever. John (my fave Beatle) is witty and sarcastic, Paul has a thing with the ladies, George shows he's not shy and that he's probably the best actor of the Beatles, and Ringo shows how loveable and funny he can be.<br />Of course, the music is awesome. My personal favorite song from the movie is &quot;You've Got to Hide Your Love Away&quot; but they're all good. In the background, you can sometimes here instrumental versions of &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot; too.<br />I'm only thirteen but the Beatles have completely taken over my life! You don't really have to be a Beatles fan to like this movie in my opinion, though.
B00004SA8A|5.0|A very nice set, and affordable to boot. I used to be completely sold on Alfred Brendel's Schubert until I grabbed this set one day. <BR>Most notable difference with Kempff (in comparison to Brendel and Pollini) is his sense of rhythm. He does not incorporate very much rubato which, to my ears, gives this music a lot of drive. Kempff does not seem to \\"rush\\" the dramatic parts and approaches these sonatas as if they were piano reductions of symphonies.<BR>His performance of D960 is my favorite of the set. The sound is awash in analog tape hiss, the piano sounds distant with a concert hall ambience, and though some Gramophone critic would probably hate this, I found it very pleasing. Kempff's patience and introspection win the day, and provide for an extremely moving performance, and that is only one example of what makes this set worthwhile. The second movement of D960 is incredibly moving; sentimental without playing in an overly-romantic style, and that steady rhythm provided by Kempff is such a great way to let the power of the notes come through. The movement is simple ABA form, and while Brendel seems to treat the \\"B\\" section as <BR>a defiant outpouring, Kempff plays with stoicism and resolve. The effect is shattering, and it literally brought me to tears.<BR>Kempff gives himself to the power of the music, rather than attaching the music to his \\"self\\".<BR>No need to go over *every* sonata in this set. It is well worth the investment.
0767802659|4.0|Well, what can I say.  Paul Verhoeven took the great sci-fi novel by Robert Heinlein and tried to do a live-action movie about it.  Well he succeeded to a point in that he successfully created the universe including the hardware, ships, bugs, and troopers.  However he didn't follow the novel closely enough.  He totally left out the second alien race, the skinnies, which are kind of in a limbo status between being loyal to the bugs or against them.  Verhoeven however did manage to include a rather ridiculous love triangle between Rico, Diz, Carmen, and Zander.  And if you thought that the on-screen bit was ridiculous, wait till you see the cut scenes.<br />But on the plus side, the movie is entertaining enough to watch as a space-based WWII movie.  Which is basically what it is.  The effects are awesome.  The spaceships and damage models are thoroughly convincing.  The bugs are well animated and textured.  The splattering goo from the bugs is a little hokey, but not too bad.  But the main point of the Starship Troopers legacy is that it wants the viewer to see that the bugs are indeed the evil bad guys.  No two ways about it.  The bugs' sole purpose is to exterminate the earth and all human kind.  So it's a fight for survival of the human race.<br />Now as for the DVD, the picture is about the best picture I have seen on a non-Superbit transfer.  The picture is bright, sharp, and very colorful.  It looks outstanding in Component Video on a Flatscreen TV.  The DVD also comes with a short behind-the-scenes documentary and a couple effect shot breakdowns along with some screentesting shots.  Of course it has 3 additional scenes which flesh out the love triangle thing which I'm actually glad they left out because it just made that side-plot even more out of place and ridiculous.<br />I gave the movie 4 stars for creating such an out of this world universe to the big screen, but left off the one star for not follwoing the novel any better.  However if you really want the true story of the Starship Troopers, I suggest you check out the Roughnecks: Starship Trooper Chronicles CGI series.  Currently the first four DVDs containing the first season are out.  (20 episodes of a 2 season-40 episode series.)  I've got my copies coming by UPS as we speak.<br />Thankstrue story of the Starship Troopers, I suggest you check out the Roughnecks: Starship Trooper Chronicles CGI series.

B00005Y228|3.0|Let's start by saying I was jumpy when I heard that Kylie Minogue's \\"Fever\\" CD was going to get a United States release February. I heard the first single \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\" and, well, really, it's kind of self-explanatory. The lyrics don't move or touch you, (Boy, your lovin' is all I think about) But a good song is a good song in my book. But sadly, most of the rest of the album can't hold a candle to it. More, More, More, track one, wasn't a smart choice for the opening track, even though most people will turn straight to track three anyway. Her voice is squeaky and annoying. I'm just wantin' less less less here, to be brief, and the pun was intended. Love at First Sight is full of more disco-pop, and guess what? A song of the same title was included on her 1988 release, KYLIE. Should we check it out? Maybe! This song is filler, just like most of these songs. Track three, CAN'T GET YOU OUT OF MY HEAD, I've explained. Track four is a really fun song with lots of medical puns...Fever? (Well, doctor, just tell me exactly what do you diagnose? I'm lovesick when you aren't around, so should I remove my clothes) -or something along the lines of that- This is one of about 4 non-filler songs. Track 5 is pretty cool in the way of plot, it's about her (falling in love, big surprise) but the guy wants to move to fast, and she's saying, Give It To Me (the song title) The Way I Want It. Just skip six, FRAGILE. I don't think this would chart if it was a single. COME INTO MY WORLD is by the same writers of CGYOOMH. It's not half as good, but it's still decent and, hey, listenable. IN YOUR EYES, the second single, track eight, is the third best song on this album (Fever was #2) and is a good disco track (Wow, disco again) with pretty decent lyrics. Great melody anyway. Dancefloor is really cool, although the last of the no-filler tracks. Yet another discopop track when Kylie decides to get over a guy...wow...how original. (Sarcasm alert) Your Love, track 11, is a girlgroup \\"wow i just fell in love with a cute guy\\" track. It's better than some, but of course, worse than others. Give it a listen, it might suit you. Track 12's start is just laughable, and the lyrics are pathetic. As for the bonus tracks, BOY and BUTTERFLY, let's just say that BUTTERFLY (Your love gives me wings like a butterfly) is good and BOY is well, the other one. We'll leave it at that. <br />BOTTOM LINE: Kylie has embarassed herself and at the same time showed the world she's a great singer. So what is she?
B00005QATY|3.0|The costumes, the hair, the background, the settings...all fabulous! The colors were lush and warm, and completely appropriate to the story. But the story was slow and the characters frustrating. There was so little depth to any of the characters, that you didn't really care what happened to them next. This movie does showcase yet another facet of George Clooney's acting talents and if you're a George Clooney fan, you'll probably enjoy this one more because of it. The best part of the movie, however, was by far the singing! Soundtrack is full of wonderful, rich, sing-able songs. Rent the movie, buy the soundtrack.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Let me start off by saying I am not much of a Dylan fan. I picked this one up on an impluse. I figured I'm here at the cd store I might as well get something.Well I done good, this is one great cd.I'm not going to compare this to other Dylan works because this cd stands on it's own. You don't have to buy it because it's &quot;Dylan&quot;. Buy it because it's a fun listen and a great addition to your collection. If you have purchased the soundtrack to &quot;O Brother Where Art Thou&quot;, this one's for you.
6304873441|5.0|Anastasia tells the story of Anastasia Romanov, the lost Russian princess.  It's a really sweet story.  People say it loses the thread in several segments, two words, NOT TRUE! My favorite song is \\"Once upon a December.\\"  It's somewhat akin to \\"Be a Man\\" and \\"Reflection\\" from Mulan, \\"Why Should I Worry\\" and \\"Once Upon a Time in New York City\\" from Oliver and Company, \\"My Lullaby\\" and \\"Love Will Find a Way\\" from the Lion King 2, and \\"Can You Feel the Love Tonight?\\" from the first Lion King.  I actually got my dog's name from Anastasia.  She's named after Anya's dog Pooka.  It was great!
6304077955|3.0|This is certainly a well-directed film with excellent performances, I understand the reason for the awards in those categories. If you appreciate the art of film-making, this would be a good choice. However, the story is non-existent - I prefer more closure in this type of intellectual effort, even if I disagree. It's basically the wanderings of a young, critical, pseudo-intellectual with a quick tongue who can quickly disrupt the beliefs and self-perception of the characters he encounters on the streets, but he cannot provide any conclusions of his own. Modern art seems to have spiraled downward so that a single perception, thought, or emotion is enough upon which to build an entire film or play. In this case, it has to do with the passage of time and how the different personalities prepare for or ignore it.
B000055ZB8|4.0|I don't want to repeat too much of what others may have said about this movie - considering there are over 80 reviews posted at the time of this writing. (87 to be exact)<br />This was an unlicensed movie version of the novel &quot;Dracula.&quot; Names were changed in an attempt to hide that fact that the movie was being illegally made. Somehow the movie survived even though there had been a court order to destroy the prints. Some video editions will have the original names, others may have the characters matched up to their names in the novel. For example, &quot;Dracula&quot; instead of &quot;Orlok&quot; or &quot;Harker&quot; instead of &quot;Hutter.&quot; This DVD uses the original names. <br />I have the Video Yesteryear videotape edition, Arrow Video videotape edition (with music by Type O Negative), the LaserDisc by Image/Blackhawk Films, and now the DVD by Image/Blackhawk Films. I find it interesting that each version has a different version of the onscreen titles. The LaserDisc edition might be the only one that appeared to have original titles. All of the others had re-created the titles for that edition except for titles that involved handwritten notes. This DVD is different - all titles were redone. Plus, it seems to use a different translation. Some of the titles appear to be more wordy on the DVD than some other editions. <br />There is a different style for each type of title - speech, narration, and handwritten stuff. The speech titles follow the more traditional silent film title format with large text, but they don't use a basic font. It's not the best choice, but it's not too bad. Handwritten notes use a simple font that look like handwriting, but not too fancy. It looks like basic letters. I hate the narration titles - overly fancy letters with loops all over the place. It looks more like a handwritten title, but it is the narration. All of the titles were created with a character generator (electronic device used to add titles to video) with simulated scratches added in to make the titles fit in. <br />Overall the quality of the film itself is very good. You do have the option of two different musical tracks - new age or organ. I personally don't like the new age music, and it doesn't seem to fit what's happening onscreen. The same could be said for the organ score, but I feel the organ fits it better. (It may not be new age, but to me it seems like it is.) I felt my Video Yesteryear tape had the best music, and later I found out it was simply Vivaldi's Four Seasons - but it actually fit fairly well. Because of differences in frame rates and possible differences in the prints the companies had access to plus the composition may not have been played in proper order, simply playing a CD of Vivaldi may not match as well. Some parts may have also been repeated. &quot;Summer - Presto&quot; was used for the coach ride to the castle on that videotape. I wish this DVD had some classical style music written for it. <br />You can also listen to a somewhat boring expert on the other audio track. The expert sounds as if it's reading his words and tends to speak in a monotone. He is the same person who speaks during some of the bonus material. <br />The extras on this DVD are very nice. Although I don't care for the voice, there is much information here about each of the exteriors used during the filming - what they were then and how they look now. There is also some information about some of the techniques used in the filming of this movie. <br />The DVD menus are nicely done - a little Orlok head is used as the selection pointer. When you go to the extras menu, you see a part of the movie where a door opens, and the menu options fly through the doorway before becoming an active menu onscreen.
B000001FFJ|5.0|The title says it all! There isn't a bad point in this whole album. A great listen from beginning to end. Of course, the most important thing to remember when hearing a Tom Waits recording is to expect nothing. Don't even expect the unexpected, because Tom will elude you every time. Just enjoy the ride.
6305013578|2.0|Metropolis is essentially a story about rich families living off of the labors of the workers while knowing nothing about the lives of those workers. They don't even care about the workers. A son of a rich family falls for a woman who lives among the workers. The son decides to look into the lives of the working class.<br />Although this is regarded as a classic movie, it has been reported that Fritz Lang didn't like it.<br />Queen (the rock group) based the music video for \\"Radio Ga Ga\\" on Metropolis.<br />This is probably the worst DVD of a silent movie. It appears to have been made from a videotape of a 16mm print. The image is very grainy because of that. The master tape even has a dropout. (A dropout is caused by a tape particle falling from the tape after a recording has been made. This can result in white lines appearing in the image.) The titles do not fit onscreen - which used to be a problem with many of the cheap silent film tapes made over 10 years ago. I've had to deal with that before, but no one should be making editions like that now.<br />The music is simply thrown on the DVD. It doesn't seem to fit the movie at all. I had the same problem with my videotape from Murray Hill - very old edition from the late 1980s. It seems like no one is making a decent edition of this movie for American release. I wouldn't even mind seeing the rock version that was released in theaters sometime during the '80s. ('80s rock music was used instead of classical or organ music.) I hated the music on the tape so much I created my own audio tape  to play while watching the movie. The music on this DVD is a little better than that tape was.<br />The extras are a joke except for the trivia questions. I'm actually surprised I got them all correct even though I hadn't seen the movie for 6 years. (The videotape is in storage.)<br />The case's insert has instructions on how to remove the DVD from the case, and they are the wrong directions for the case they are currently using. It's still a Keep Case, but it's the case where you have to put one finger under the disc at the top. The instructions are for the style where you push on the tabs that hold onto the center hole of the disc.<br />I wouldn't blame the price for the lack of quality. I have some decent DVDs that cost less than this one with better image quality - Boris Karloff and Vincent Price double feature DVDs.It's still a Keep Case, but it's the case where you have to put one finger under the disc at the top.

B00003CX96|3.0|This is a fabulous film, one of my all-time favorites:  a funny, bittersweet, character-driven masterpiece of small-budget filmmaking, shot in a town I lived in for five years.<br />Obviously, this was a cheaply done DVD release by Fox of a film that deserves a deluxe special edition.  Besides the lack of extras, interviews, and audio commentary, I could not believe the poor sound quality of the DVD digital transfer:  street scenes, crowd scenes, etc. sounded like they were recorded in a digital bucket!  We had to turn down the sound during the pivotal Little 500 scene, because the digital garbage was so annoying.<br />Having seen this many times on tape, I know that the sound of this low-budget film was not always good, but it was never horrible until this cheap digital mastering.  Fortunately it does not completely ruin the experience of this wonderful film, but I wouldn't be in any hurry to replace a VHS tape with this DVD!<br />Fox, fix your mistake and treat this film properly!
0441008356|2.0|I love hard sci-fi, but Mr Reynold's Revelation Space is a dull and insipid second-rate tale that belongs somewhere in the Star Trek league.<br />It might all be scientifically squared off, but the storyline is repetitious and confusing, the characters lack any saving graces, and the ending is incredibly unimaginative and sell-out.<br />To me, it felt like Mr Reynolds was trying to distill the best of Iaine M.Banks, Dan Simmons and Peter F Hamilton all into one pastiche of the genre...and failed.  <br />Mr Reynolds, either stick to the hard science you understand, or take a writing course in developing human characters we can sympathize with and actually want to follow across the universe.<br />Sorry Alastair, but Revelation Space reads like Empty Space.
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie is basically a propaganda movie. It shows the world where they are heading and is unintentionally humorous by how it shows the truth directly. This movie analyzes by how people are in need to find comfort that will get the nowhere. In a way, this movie inspires us to re analyze our own lives. It made us ask the question, are you happy? It tells us to stop complaining and do what you want. This movie also shows violence in a way that can be alarming for some people. The ideas in the movie can be unsettling and uncomfortable, but that was the point of the movie. The direction is wonderfully done. The acting should've been oscar calibur. There is nothing wrong with this movie. It's beyond perfect. Please, whoever reads this, please try this movie out.
B00005QDW1|5.0|This is the best CD I've heard in quite a while. Outstanding vocals, interesting lyrics, powerful, moving, innovative musical arrangements. Would make good music for the Bobsligh Ride at the amusement park. So belt yourself in and hang on tight--THIS IS A STRONG RIDE!!
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is fresh, unique, familiar and in every way worth every nickel. Her voice is sweet but not innocent, her arrangements refreshingly, acoustically, airy without being stark and the production is clean and entirely authentic. If you fail to be moved by this stunning debut collection of moving melodies, check in with a cardiologist. IMMEDIATELY.
6300248550|2.0|The original UK release of this mini-series consisted of 11 30-minute episodes (330 minutes of footage) while the running time of this video is only 239 minutes. As you see the startling 1.5 hours of film were cut! Since I had a chance to see both versions I can assure you that the cuts subtract from your enjoyment of the series. And it's a shame as this is clearly the definite adoption of the Bronte's celebrated novel.
B00000064G|5.0|I admit to being one who found Nick Drake just by hearing those few bars of music on the VW commercial, but for once a commercial did something unintentionally great - they introduced me to this guy's hauntingly beautiful music.  My \\"Pink Moon\\" CD arrived in the mail today and I have been playing it over and over since it got here.   ...
0793927501|4.0|All said and done, this is a good movie, albeit one that may take a couple viewings to really get the message.  For me, \\"The Edge\\" is what Charles (Anthony Hopkins) is on, emotionally and spiritually.  The isolationism of a privileged life, the seperation between Charles and Bob (Alec Baldwin) because of it.  The freedom of this lifestyle has allowed Charles time to fill up on seemingly trivial and theoretical knowledge - until the time of testing comes.  And its not just a \\"survival movie\\" in terms of battling the elements and scene-stealing grizzly bears.  Its about surviving yourself, how you've lived your life and the decisions you've made in the past which have put you where you are now.  Sub-plots about the wife being in cahoots with Bob to kill Charles are really only secondary to the true story line - which is all, in fact, about Charles.  In the end, his life WAS saved, although not just physically.  And this, I believe, is the true purport of this film.  We may all want to be put to the test in some way, but it may not always come in the way, or the time of our choosing.  A thought provoking film whose tenents can be applied in any situation.
B000002H6C|5.0|This is true Metallica. This was my first Metallica album I've have bought way back in time. This is the Metallica before they went commercial. On this album (and their previous ones) you hear, you feel why these guys were the pioneers of thrash-metal. <BR>This album just blows you away, just like Master Of Puppets and Ride the Lightning. But what the major difference is between this album and the previous ones is that it's more mature. the riff's and the drumming is absolutely brilliant. The lyrics are typical Hetfield and even better. My favorite track is 'To live is to die'. Everytime I listen to that track, it's like I hear it for the first time. That is the power of this album and of Metallica, the songs are even 14 and even 16 years after release soo fresh and so new! A++++ Quality. <BR>What has to be mentioned is the lame production. It very bad and a shame. because if the production was better it could overclass Master Of Puppets. <BR>Want to be a metalhead? You are a metalhead? Open-minded? Want to know how Metallica sounded before The Black Album? THEN BUY THIS CD!!!! IT WILL BLOW YOU AWAY!!!
B00005R2M3|2.0|To market herself to an American audience, Shakira has sacrificed a lot of things. I don't see the merit of selling to the Anglo world if you're going to wear such a mask and in the process deteriorate your music to the point of not being recognizable. With the artist she was before, she already had more than enough. Shakira's real gift can be heard in Pies Descalzos and Dnde estn los ladrones? &quot;Suerte&quot; is the only good tune in this album. This album freezes her natural gift and turns it into pre-fabricated radio material. I hope Shakira goes back to making music soon. Also, what's with the look? Her black hair was so beautiful as was her simpler way of dressing. I guess she is aiming at an American audience that can't look past the flesh.
B000002H97|4.0|Well, Metallica proved with this album that they are great musicians. Hetfield proves that he is a great songwriter. Ulrich proves that he is a solid and sublime drummer. A good example is 'Nothing else Matters'. It's Metallica's finest ballad till date, great lyrics, great drums, great guitars, great bass, but so overhyped. <BR>Hammet and Hetflied are also solid. This whole album is solid. Nothing more nothing less. It's no thrash and it's no rock. It's metal on his finest. Yes, maybe this is the most finest metal-album ever produced. Masters Of Puppets and Justice For All, they are hard, they rock, they blow you away. But this album is just solid. It rocks and it's hard, but it's so damned overproduced. It's based on a bigger public and you can hear that. It's not only for the true metalheads.<BR>The album is very good and the songs are great, don't missunderstand me, I like the album. But what I miss on this album and that is the reason why I give 4 stars, is that I miss the power, I miss that raunchy, raw touch. My opinion is that it's is great, but to overproduced.
B00005QIPH|3.0|Maybe not...but i've never understood why some people are so passionately opposed to something they have no control over. Music is cyclical. Artists feed off of their predecessors everyday. <br />&quot;This is it&quot; is a great driving album. The lyrics are par for the genre and this album gives me a legitimate alternative to &quot;transformer,&quot; &quot;New York,&quot; et al.
B00003CXI0|5.0|I loved this movie! It had wonderful grapics, the best ever grapics, My daughter said that she thought Daniel Radcliffe Was cute! And I'd recommend this movie better than The lord ofthe Rings!
1573300403|4.0|This DVD is so good I had to order the first volume.  It shows his vintage performance at the motown celebration, his 1995 MTV performance which was just excellent and a host of other videos like scream, they don't care about us, stranger in moscow, childhood, you are not alone, etc etc.  It is mostly for those who enjoyed disc 2 of the HIStory CD.  It may not be worth getting on DVD, but it is still worth getting if you love MJ.
B000009O1U|4.0|A hugely enjoyable movie, despite manifold annoyances.<br />Heston is monolithically wooden. Loren looks stunning, as ever, IMOH the most beautiful actress of her generation, but never entirely convincesÑshe could often be superlative in Italian movies (e.g. Two Women), but never quite translated to Hollywood.<br />Excruciatingly lame bitÑHeston and Loren's marrige night.<br />Other gripesÑhistorical innacuracies. This is 11th century Spain. Why the hell does Charlton first appear toting a sword that wouldn't have appeared prior to the late 16thC? Armour, costumes, bewildering mish-mash.<br />Plus side: decent, literate script, good-to-superb perfomances by Brit character actors in supporting roles (although I have never been able to picture Andrew Cruickshank (Ximene/Sophia Loren's father) as anyone other than Doctor Cameron from Doctor Finlay's Casebook). John Fraser (what happened to him?) is particularly good as the weak young King Alfonso. And non-BritÑGenevieve Page stunning as the infanta Urraca. OK, forget Herbert Lom hamming it up outrageously as the Almoravid leader, and Frank Thring (unkindly known, legend has it, as 'the Thring from Outer Space') doing his usual degenerate-tyrant-who-comes-to-a-sticky-end (cf. 'The Vikings'). <br />Many unforgettable scenes and images. OK, the tournament is wildly anachronistic, but stunniningly good. Beats anything in 'Gladiator'. The Almoravid armies marching along the moonlit shore. Loads of others.<br />I first saw it aged 12, when it first came out, and still play the video every so often. And, I have to say, it compares favourably (IMOH) with most of its contemporaries. Miles better than the overblown,  flaccid and ludicrous Ben-Hur, and at least comparable to Lawrence of Arabia. Most people recall the latter for a few fantastic scenes (Omar Sharif's appearance out of the desert heat-haze, the slaughter of the Turkish column) and forget the longueurs in between them, not to mention the frequently incomprehensible plot.<br />*Not* Seven Samurai. But on its own terms, a fine and satisfying movie, its merits heavily outweighing its flaws.
B000050XEI|5.0|This is one of entertainments number one c.d.s. out there. Enya's lyrics may not be in all english but they are beautiful. She sings great on lord of the Rings too.
B000002L9M|5.0|This is a brilliant album &amp; most people agree their last 'classic',although 'violator' is quite good. If you want somewhere to start you could also try 'construction time again'or'some great reward'which are better,also the stunning 'a broken frame'or'music for the masses',these are all good choices along with this one. Also the latest 'exciter' which is a return to 'classic' mode after the guitar drenched duds of the '90s would be a good choice. A five star classic and depeche modes last real album until 'exciter'.
B00005QZWI|5.0|This is the best c.d. around. The musis doesn't have many words, but the music is words all its own.
B000002KZA|5.0|Don't be misled by the misguided naysayers here,this <BR>cd is brilliant from start to finish. Not a single dud! From the technoish electro beat of More Than A Party to the proto industrial sounds of Pipeline this album is chock full of synthy goodness.Yes Pipeline is excellent!!!! If your a synth fan in any way you MUST have this album! I would also highly recommend the follow up Some Great Reward as that & this album are Depeche Modes creative peak. Violator is also great but forget everything after that as they went seriously downhill in the '90s. This is THE Depeche Mode album!! A synth pop classic! Buy it & dont buy anything after Violator.

B000001Y79|5.0|This album is one of my all-time favorites. I bought it used, and it's such an excellent group of songs. Every song contributes to the over-all quality of the cd. Check it out- you won't regret it!
0790736918|4.0|This film, directed by the legendary John Ford, and starring John Wayne in the leading role is a western that has achieved mythic proportions. Touted as one of the greatest westerns ever filmed, it is, I will grant you, an entertaining film. In it, John Wayne plays the anti-hero, Ethan Edwards, an ex-confederate soldier, who goes to Texas in 1868 to visit his brother and his family on their ranch in Texas. While visiting, a report of marauding Indians in adjacent land draws out the Texas Rangers and Ethan, who joins them. When they discover that a decoy has been used to lure them away from the settlement, they hurry back, only to find that Ethan's family was masacred and his two nieces gone, taken captive by Comanche Indians.<br />Ethan goes to the rescue, joined by Martin Pawley (Jeffrey Hunter), a friend of the family who is himself part Indian. After a while, they discover that only the younger niece, Debbie, has survived. Their quest to bring Debbie back, or so Martin thinks, takes place over a period of five years. At some point along the way, Ethan's relentless quest for Debbie seems to undergo a transition from rescue mission to execution squad in the belief that it is better to be dead than to have \\"gone Injun\\".<br />The film suffers somewhat from revisionist history and its own stereotypic portrayal of Indians. They are portrayed as either savages or buffoons fit only to be the butt of jokes. Moreover, the character of Ethan is an enigma, as he changes from heartbroken uncle to death squad killer in his relentless search for his surviving niece. Ethan embodies hatred and racism, concepts that are tantalizingly laid out but never fully examined or explored, which is why Ethan remains an enigma.<br />Debbie, played as a child by Lana Wood and as a teenager by Lana's older sister, Natalie Wood, is a symbol around which Ethan's character gets its raison d'etre. It is she who gives him the will to go on, whether it be for the right or wrong reasons is another issue. Natalie Wood is lovely as the older Debbie, though the makeup has to go, as it serves to take away from the rusticity of the film and jerk the viewer back to Hollywood. This was typical of films in those days. No matter what the situation, the women were always in full makeup.<br />Still, notwithstanding some of the film's political incorrectness and incongruent production values, it is still an entertaining film and about as good as westerns get. John Wayne is memorable as Ethan Edwards. Handsome Jeffrey Hunter gives an excellent performance as Martin Pawley. Ward Bond, as captain of the Texas Rangers, is terrific. The rest of the supporting cast give performances that vary in quality. Still, this film remains the quintessential western flick and one worth watching.sue.

B00003CXTG|2.0|The biggest bomb in this movie is the film itself.  They supposedly spent a ton of money to produce this film: the pity is they didn't seem to spend any of it on a script that deals with real people or genuine logic.  I came away from this film actually angered.  This movie asks us to believe that the Ben Affleck character participates in the Battle of Britain, the Pearl Harbor attack AND the Doolittle Raid!  Had the film been 30 minutes longer, he could have taken part in the Hiroshima bombing!  It also asks us to accept as a character a military pilot with a crippling stutter!  I am sure that a person who cannot communicate is the one you want flying as your wingman! I can attest to the fact that such an individual would not have made it past the induction center, much less flight training.  The love triangle bit was cliched when it was filmed in '43 as \\"Crash Dive\\" and it hasn't improved with age.  The digital effects, while well done, are of the video game variety, with aircraft performing split-second maneuvers that are in contradiction to the laws of physics.  This film is an insult to the 2400 Americans who gave their lives on December 7, 1941.  Stick with \\"Tora! Tora! Tora!\\"
B00005JKYS|5.0|This is a truly exciting and emotional film that is full of outstanding acting and thrilling battle sequences! But be warned right now: the brutality of the battle scenes were the reason this film recieved the much-deserved R-rating. Definitely not for little kids! A very outstanding Vietnam war movie that is not an anti-war film. God knows we don't need an anti-war film at this time! Grade: A+
B00005QY5Y|5.0|Even better than U2's All That You Can't Leave Behind (and I am a diehard U2 fan), way better than the overrated Strokes' Is This It (which is, y'know, okay), even better than Pete Yorn's musicforthemorningafter (which I love).<br />I heard \\"New York, New York,\\" and I was like, that's an okay song, whatever. Then a friend lent me the cd and I gave it a couple spins in the car. The album proceeded to change my life.<br />\\"Nobody Girl\\" got me first, with its fooled-you-there's-no-hook-yet hang on followed by the let-loose jam and emotive fade-out vocals. Then I bonded with \\"Enemy Fire\\" and its short, sad anger. Then \\"Make You Love Me More\\" was all I could listen to, its energetic guitar and its simultaneously smug and hopeful lyrics stuck in my head constantly. Then I was in love with \\"Touch Feel and Lose,\\" and felt my heart being wrenched every time I heard Adams sing \\"I just wanted you to love me\\" like it was the first time I'd ever heard that kind of sentiment in a song.<br />Long story short, this whole album is wonderful, awesome, addictive. To dissent from concensus, I wouldn't say \\"Stars Go Blue\\" is one of the better songs on the album (the lyrics don't do anything for me and it's sort of whiny), but that's just my two cents. I think Adams is at his best with his attitude on his sleeve, but I gotta say: the low-key numbers take me away too. This guy can really paint a story in both music *and* lyric, which is rare these days.<br />I don't actually mean this is the best album *ever* but damned if this isn't the best new music I've heard in a long, long time.
B00004XOWM|5.0|Alright, I know you all think Limp Bizkit is a sell-out, but what makes a sell-out.  You sure don't know thats for sure.  This is possibly the most influential bands of the late 90's and thats a fact.  This cd is just as good as their first.  Heck, I'm not even a big rap-metal fan but I love this cd.  Wes Borland is a great guitarist even though he really dosent get express himself the way he should on the LB records plus it [stinks] that he quit LB. Fred Durs is gotta be the most agggressive sob in the record business.  I admire him for that he really knows what makes the music industry ticks.  The rest of the band is just as talented.  This cd is good bu you do got to be open minded.
B000005Z0G|5.0|Around the time when 2Pac released his first albulm \\"2Pacalypse Now\\", I recal going to a barbque and having a big argument with these two guys because they called him the greatest rapper ever and all I could think of is \\"how could they think he is the greatest rapper ever when all he has is one guest appearence on a digital underground song and only one albulm which is spanking new?\\" I emphatically disagreed with them. If I could find those guys I was arguing with NOW, I would bow down to them, shut my mouth and listen to everything they say, because by the time 2Pac released \\"All Eyes on Me\\" I was ALREADY a die hard fan. I had become a die hard fan BEFORE the \\"Me against the World\\" albulm though, and the albulm that solidified 2Pac as one of the greatest rappers ever was THIS albulm...\\"Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.\\" This albulm is so very important because it is 2Pac's most political albulm. To me, 2Pac spoke as if he was speaking from MY heart with this albulm. He said what I felt, and he said it so clearly, so vividly and so accurately that the least you could call him was genius or prophet. To me, 2Pac represents the frustration young Black males are put through in Americas racist, capitalist, sick, twisted system. If you ask me what makes this 2Pac's greatest albulm, I dont know what to say to you to convince you. All I can say is that if you are a TRUE 2Pac fan, you KNOW what I am talking about. You KNOW the energy that 2Pac gave off on this albulm is REAL. You KNOW that 2Pac was like the heart beat of Black youth and for you to FEEL this albulm is to \\"TRUTH.\\" I cant tell you what this truth is, all I can say is that it IS THEE truth and if you can FEEL this albulm than you can feel \\"IT\\"
B00005JKYS|3.0|This is a 'good' war movie, but not great.  Alot of people didn't like this because of the cliches and corny acting, I didn't mind that, but what bothered me was the grisly violence.  Take a look at the slow-motion violence of Sam Peckinpah's \\"The Wild Bunch\\" and multiply that by about one hundred.  It's not just the slow-motion stuff, this movie makes \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" look like something you would see on the Disney channel.  I won't say what the types of violence were that made me wince, but it had something to do with napalm.  There's definitely some Oscar worthy cinematography in the film.  This movie really made me feel like I was in the war.  If you are, or know someone that wants to go to war to win medals, be a hero, or something like that, then see this movie first.  It did change my view of war, war isn't honarable or heroic, or glorious, it's just depressing and scary.  This is probably one of the most scary movies I've seen, and it's a war movie.  The acting is good but not great, Mel Gibson does a nice job as Col. Moore, and Sam Elliot (Sgt. Plumley) is in this for comic relief, maybe so the audience won't get too depressed. Other than that the acting is okay.  I would've given this movie 4 or 5 stars, but it's just so violent.  Not for children, or the weak hearted.
0679805273|5.0|Inspirational yet honest, and always rhythmically rollicking, 'Oh, the Places You'll Go!' is a perfect sendoff for children ages 1 to 100. It's a great book for people entering any new phase of life. Kindergartners, graduate students, newlyweds, new employees - all will glean pearls of wisdom about their expansive future.  I also highly recommend \\"Open Your Mind, Open Your Life: A Book of Eastern Wisdom\\" by Taro Gold.
B00005U1YO|3.0|Each Chemical Brother's release is worse than the last.  With the exception of the last track (The Test), these songs are pretty weak.  Chemical Brothers were pretty exciting with their first realease....now there's better stuff out.
0140067477|4.0|A nice introduction to eastern philosophy and a good read for those seeking wisdom. In a modern society filled with superficial standards, noise polution and electronic everythings, this book is a welcome break that may just affect the ways you think and react. I also love and highly recommend the 'Open Your Mind, Open Your Life' book of wisdom by Taro Gold which, like the Tao of Pooh, teaches that life is not about what happens to us, it's how we perceive what happens. Wonderful!
B00005N83M|5.0|It doesn't matter what type of music you are into, you will fall in love with this cd. It's got all, from pop, r&b, latin rock, latin, spanish, and even rap. Jennifer Lopez's 2nd album, gave her the nickname everybody uses, which is \\"J-LO\\". The album starts off with a blend of pop and r&b. That song is the first single called \\"Love Don't Cost A Thing\\". It's a great song, but not a highlight of the album. I loved the song at first, but it's been over a year or so - and I'm pretty much done with it. Track Two is one the best songs on the album, I'm Real. The oringal verison. I think it's much better then the remix with Ja Rule. It's def. my fave single from her, and one of the best off the album. \\"Walking On Sunshine\\" is a dance pop beat song, that Jennifer wrote herself. When I saw the title track, I thought it was a remake, but I was totally wrong. That's another great track off the album. We Gotta Talk is a great r&b mixed song. That was the first song I really listen to when I first got it. My fave track on the album is \\"That's The Way\\", a song produced by Rodney \\"Darkchild\\" Jerkins (Jessica Simpson, Britney Spears, Nsync, Ashley Ballard). That song is a mix of pop and r&b. A must download track. It's my fave Jennifer song ever. I def. think you should get this album. No matta what music you are into, it has everything to make a great album. <br />1.

0688156819|4.0|I like the main idea of the book about deformed children. I also like the humor in it (death, sadistic humor, unholy encounters with kitchen appliances, etc). I wish the stories were longer and a few of them didn't flow smoothly. Most of the 100 pages were filled with one verse/drawing and mostly blank. It doesn't take enough time to finish the book. Other than that it is really good.
B00005OM4N|4.0|I wouldn't say this is Britney's best album to date, but it's really good. I was very disapointed in the first single, \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\", well, if you hate the first single, you will not hate the whole album. If you love \\"I'm A Slave 4 U\\", and isn't into pop, you may not like this album as much. Some pop songs that sound like Britney's old albums, are \\"Overprotected\\", \\"Bombastic Love\\", \\"Cinderella\\", \\"Let Me Be\\". The only slow song on the record is the 2nd single \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\". My fave song off the album is \\"Anticipating\\". It's def. my fave Britney song ever, next to \\"Sometimes\\", it's a bit diff. from her other songs. Another great song, that is very underrated and a lot of people just hate is \\"That's Where You Take Me\\". It sounds like a bit of INOJ's \\"Love You Down\\" and Janet Jackson's \\"Someone To Call My Lover\\". The cd ends in a bit different note, \\"What It's Like To Be Me\\", produced by Britney's boyfriend, Justin Timberlake from NSYNC, and Wade. This album is pretty good. Not her best work. <br />1.

B00005NWZ2|5.0|If you want to hear T-Rex the way they haven't sounded in years &quot;buy this album&quot;!  The sound quality of this CD makes it worth the price of admission!  George Marino and Tony Visconti did a great job remastering tapes that are almost 30 years old.  The drum sound, especially the opening kick and snare drum on &quot;Get It on&quot; never sounded better and Marc's guitar sound hasn't sounded this good in years.<br />If you want crisp original artwork and lyrics, pull out your old A&amp;M record sleeve, or look for the album in the bargain bins because it isn't here.  A&amp;M did a poor job replicating the front cover artwork (my inkjet scanner/printer at home could have done a better job!) and the inside gatefold of the original album (no lyrics or original picture of Marc).<br />A&amp;M did add excellent liner notes from producer/arranger Tony Visconti and pictures and drawings of Marc that have never seen the light of day until now.<br />The extra tracks are great to listen to, but it would have been even better if they could have added &quot;Raw Ramp&quot;,(the B-side of &quot;Get It On&quot;) to round things out.<br />Still, the audio clarity and punch of this re-mastered CD make it a must-have for any T-Rex fan.
1587990717|2.0|I agonized over how to rate this one.  The idea that luck (randomness) is far more important that we give credit is very dear to me.  Unfortunately, after telling us how humble he has become by studying markets, Taleb spends the rest of the book showing us how arrogant he really is.  The good news is that the subject is still wide open.

B00003CY0V|1.0|Wow, this was terrible. I can't believe I sat through the full movie. If you like to watch a series of action shots with no plot this is for you. The movie goes from bad to worse. John Travolta starts the movie out with a monologue on all the mistakes they make in movies and why they turn out terrible. Well this movie seemed to make every one of them. There is no redemming quality in it at all. Entertaing no, confusing and boring. Very painful to watch. Anyway save your self some pain and rent the Fast and the Furious.

B00004TRD8|4.0|Never let it be said that no effort went into the production of this DVD. From the digitally animated menus to the staggering 6 hours of content, this pair of discs has more than enough to compensate for its flaws. The main feature has two basic options- the theatrical release of T2 and the special edition of T2. The difference between them lies in the fact (explained in the documentary on disc 2) that the film ran a little too long, and therefore some scenes had to be cut. While these don't alter the movie in any serious, plot-oriented way, they do develop the characters more (specifically John Connor and Miles Dyson) and are worth sitting through the extra half hour of film. There has been a lot of talk about the secret version of the movie, that you access by putting in the special code on one of the menu screens. I thought this was the weakest version of the film, due to the adding on of a special extra scene at the end. This happy ending, the tone of which is a complete mismatch with the rest of the film, takes place in the year 2030.(or thereabouts) In it, and aged Sarah Connor and her granddaughter are laughing on the playground in an idyllic future paradise. This is pure sugar, obviously filmed to appease the studio bigwigs who found the film too dark, and then cut from the original when James Cameron came to his senses. In terms of packaging and production, &quot;T2 The Ultimate Edition&quot; is superb, and rivals such other masterfully produced titles as Fight Club and Rushmore. Bottom line: if you like T2 and want to own a really nice copy of it, this DVD is well worth the price.
B000006TRV|4.0|A lot of the reviews for this and every Pink Floyd album have a clear anti-Waters mood.  These reviews make this album out to be the worst in the Floyd catalog, which isn't even close to being accurate.  This album isn't their worst, and it isn't their best either.<br />The Wall is a lot different from the Pink Floyd albums that came before it.  Those previous albums were best when played from beginning to end but pretty much any song could hold up on its own.  On The Wall, this isn't the case.  The album is still best when listened to from beginning to end, but there are quite a few weak tracks.  These tracks are mostly on disk one.  &quot;Mother&quot; and &quot;Goodbye Blue Sky&quot; are just awful songs.  They are awful by themselves and awful in the context of the album.  This did not happen on any other 1970s PF release.<br />But this album is different from its predecessors for other reasons, too.  The Wall was the first Pink Floyd album (excluding &quot;Obscured by Clouds&quot;) without a 7-minute song.  The two previous two albums alone had five 10-minute songs between them.  And where is Rick Wright's mellow keyboard work that, along with Gilmour's guitar, WAS Pink Floyd?<br />These changes mean that The Wall has a different feel to it then, let's say, Wish You Were Here.  The Wall is a mechanical album.  It's the band going through a routine, playing notes and singing words.  The only part of the album that doesn't sound rehearsed is the top-notch solo in &quot;Comfortably Numb.&quot;  I rather liked the (pseudo-)spontaneity of &quot;Have a Cigar&quot; and &quot;Shine On You Crazy Diamond.&quot;  Those songs were magical.  The Wall isn't.  It's a good listen, but it's not magical.<br />Like most of the anti-Waters reviewers observe, the songs that Gilmour had a hand in writing are the album's highlights.  But Roger Waters wrote some great songs on his own, including &quot;Another Brick in the Wall,&quot; &quot;Don't Leave Me Now,&quot; &quot;Hey You,&quot; &quot;Nobody Home,&quot; and &quot;Vera.&quot;<br />Like previously stated, The Wall is best when played in its entirety.  It's like Radiohead's Kid A; it has standout tracks that are great by themselves and it has songs that are great only in the context of the album.  The album as a whole is worth buying and very under-rated by the other reviewers.<br />In my Real Jukebox music library I categorize Piper as &quot;Psychedelic Rock,&quot; the albums from '68 to '77 as &quot;Progressive Rock,&quot; and The Wall as &quot;Classic Rock.&quot;  This is a telling statement.  The Wall may be good, but it's not in the same genre as the Dark Side of The Moon.  You could even say it's not even by the same band.  The Wall is good album, but I think I would like it better if it was by Pink Floyd.&quot;Nobody Home,&quot; and &quot;Vera.&quot;<br />Like previously stated, The Wall is best when played in its entirety.

B000002J2D|2.0|This album lacks the kick and stamina of A Trick of the <BR>Tail.  Only two songs are worth listening to, &quot;Burning Rope&quot; and &quot;Deep in the Motherlode&quot;.  Otherwise, this album is quite bland and middle-of-the-road.
1892065290|5.0|Stunning, amazing, beautiful, astonishing, mindblowing. The beginning of what is without doubt the great fantasy series ever written. Like many others I had thought that Jordan's Wheel of Time was the crowning acheivement of the genre. This changed my mind. I have never read a fantasy novel written with such depth and maturity.<br />On with the review. What you've heard about every character being vulnerable is true, to a certain extent. I went into this novel expecting main characters to be dying left and right. That doesn't happen. When Martin kills someone, it makes absolute sense in the story, and you will never be able to predict when it happens, and to who. A second thing commonly said is that it's based on the War of Roses in England. I don't agree with this at all. Surely there are parallels between the Starks and the Yorks, and the Lannisters and Lancasters. But it is not dramatized history at all.<br />Another thing that should be mentioned is that no one is 'good' or 'evil' in this book, except perhaps Joffrey. They all have their own reasons, some justifiable, some not. You will sympathize with certain characters (the Starks and Tyrion Lannister), but that's only because that's who Martin is writing as. As Martin shows in the next two books, he can make you like anyone.
0060229357|5.0|I think that younger kids love this story so much because it's a book that operates the way they do-vivid but simple ideas put forth in a more or less stream of consciousness style that mirrors the very young child's thinking pattern.  Harold's adventure is one where one things move together quickly in a not necessarily logical, but highly imaginative sequence.  <br />Also, Harold is the one in control-an aspect that I think also really appeals to kids.  Everything in the story appears solely by virtue of Harold employing his imagination to his surrounding.  Isn't that essentially that a 4 years olds play pattern is most of the time?<BR>That it is a sweet and fun tale only adds to the enjoyment.<br />A great book that your kids will have you reading to them over and over again.
B00005T30L|5.0|Terry Zwigoff's \\"Ghost World\\" is the anonymous Anytown USA, landscaped with strip malls, drive-up ATM windows, expresso bars, mini-marts, tanning parlors and a burger franchise on every corner. It's the place where the bus no longer runs, except in the mind of an old man on the bench. \\"Ghost World\\" is where everyone has big hair, drives an SUV, wears designer clothers, listens MOR radio, and suffocates their children with benign platitudes and unwanted attention. It's tough to be a kid in \\"Ghost World\\" where your choices are limited to joining the \\"in-crowd\\" or, developing a highly refined sense of irony, as does our heroine, Enid.<br />\\"Ghost World\\" is a brilliantly conceived film by Zwigoff, the director of the riveting documentary about the life and times of undergound comic artist, R.Crumb.  Steve Bushemi plays Seymour, a charmingly eccentric collector of odd cultural artifacts who sometimes appears to be an alter-ego aforementioned Mr. Crumb. Thora Birch's Enid, is a directionless recent high school graduate (sort of) who has lost her bearings in a sea of suburban mediocrity. You will seldom see a more tender and complex relationship portrayed as the relationship between by Bushemi and Birch. They are two doomed outsiders who view the transparency of human relationships with intelligent irony. This is a small movie that should be a runaway success, but never will be. In \\"Ghost World\\", we like big action packed blockbuster movies. Irony doesn't sell well in \\"Ghost World.\\"
0060955775|2.0|It seems that most people reviewing this book are reviewing the message (\\"Life is good\\") rather than the book.  Sure, the moral of the story makes you feel good, but that doesn't mean that the book is well done; in fact, the novel itself is weak.  The story goes nowhere, the characters are as dead as Veronika wishes to be, and the ending is obvious from the beginning. Maybe it reads better in Portugese, but this one left me colder than the Slovenian winter.
B00005B6C9|3.0|Certainly, the best song on this album is the one that was released on the radio and the title song, &quot;This Is Where I Came In.&quot; It's a high-energy song.  I haven't found the rest of the songs to be as memorable, but it's a fun listen nevertheless.  I credit the Bee Gees for being creative.

6304613199|2.0|As for the first JP movie, it was fantastic, with its genuine, suspense, terror and the general scenery. As for JP2, it's a slippery, incoherent mess of a movie, which insults it even further by claiming to be a sequel by boasting Jeff Goldblum, Richard Attenborough (in a brief cameo), the gorgeous Julianne Moore and Vince Vaughn.<br />This movie doesn't seem to be given the typical Spielburg magic to most of his movies. Lots of blood, gore and general grossness are what's this movie based, primarily. It seems more like a slasher movie, with the dinosaurs as the big baddies. The only thing that survives are a few intact scary scenes, a bit of suspense and Julianne Moore, with her bold performance as Ian's latest girlfriend.<br />See JP and JP3. They are much, much better than this slapdash job what Spielburg did. It compares with A.I. as one of Spielburg's worst movies ever directed. If you want to see a good Spielburg film, see E.T., Schindler's List, or either JP or JP3 (though Spielburg only produced JP3, he still qualifies as being involved in the movie's production).<br />What ever happened to the enjoying flicks you used to make about twenty years ago, Spielburg? You KNOW you can do better.
B000002GQK|2.0|Just so you know where I'm coming from, I think that what the Moody Blues produced from 1967-1970 is one of the great legacies of the rock era. Also, some of the material I've heard from 1981-1999 is good (if formulaic), but I am less familiar with it. With that said, the Moodies hit their lowest point with \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\\" and \\"Seventh Sojourn\\".  The only song on \\"Every Good Boy\\" that I enjoy is Justin Hayward's excellent rocker \\"The Story in Your Eyes\\".  I award two stars to this album just because it contains this song.  The other songs are either plodding and dull or sticky sweet, comparable only to the very worst of their prior material. If you are exploring the early Moodies' music, do yourself a \\"favour\\" and try any of their first five albums (see my other reviews for details).  You will find rock that really rocks, and beautiful music that is fresh and original.
B00005U122|5.0|This DVD is a must for all Pink Floyd and Roger Waters fans.<BR>This is a DVD of many surprises, too. <BR>Technical surprises: anamorphic widescreen and the best DD audio track I've ever heard. My listening experiences say DTS is fairly superior to DD when it comes to music track, well, this DD track sounds fantastic and I have no regret they didn't include a DTS track, too.<BR>Musical surprises: the band supporting Waters makes a tremendous job - the only weak performance is of the saxophonist - as for the rest this is the real thing!! OK, Doyle Bramhall isn't Dave Gilmour, but he is Doyle Bramhall!! I mean Doyle's guitar style is different, not worse than Gilmour's. You only need a few listinings to get acquainted with Doyle's guitar, then you'll enjoy all of his solos.<BR>The experienced Graham Broad makes a fabulous job on drums.
B000002GQG|5.0|\\"It's the music, Stupid!\\"  That is what I have to say to those who fuss over this as a \\"concept album\\".  In Search of the Lost Chord is one of the two most consistent and musically cohesive albums the Moody Blues ever did (the other is Children's Children).  Except for the first two songs (\\"Ride My See Saw\\" and \\"Dr. Livingstone\\") it isn't rock music at all.  It is simply their own sound, completely original and unique and you can't get it anywhere else.  There is one bad song (\\"House of Four Doors\\") but everything else is top drawer, even the spacy Best Way to Travel.  Indian and western musical influences are blended more successfully here than any other rock or pop band ever achieved, including the Beatles.  \\"Legend of a Mind,\\" Ray Thomas' cheeky English take on American acid-head Timothy Leary is experimental and entirely successful, working toward a thrilling climax propelled by repeated calling of Leary's name and John Lodge's thumping bass.  \\"See-Saw\\" is solid classic rock.  \\"Voices in the Sky\\" and \\"Visions of Paradise\\" are delightful, but I save my highest praise for \\"The Actor\\".  It is the quintessential and best Justin Hayward song ever, and that is saying a lot - powerful singing, a beautiful melody, delicately textured instrumental backing of acoustic guitar and flute, gentle drumming by Graeme, and very effective lyrics.  It is a song to be listened to with eyes closed.  Singers today attempt to convey emotion through pre-programmed vocal acrobatics, but listen to Justin on this song.  He just belts it out straight and the passion is right there, it comes right out of him, and it's much better than his earlier and more famous \\"Nights in White Satin\\".  The Actor is the song on which Justin makes his strongest claim to greatness as a vocalist.
B00005JKYS|5.0|I have just viewed the movie with my husband who will retire from the Army this year.  \\"When We Were Soldiers\\" is by far the best picture made in this genre in our generation.  When viewing the movie, you want to put down your popcorn, because it feels like you are eating in front of the Vietnam Wall.  This picture is a memorial to all fighting men and their families left at home.<BR>This movie does a wonderful job of showing all aspects of a war machine, showing all the support personel that it takes to carry on battle. It shows soldiers carrying out their mission with bravery and dedication without covering up the flaws of our country's policy making during that era.<BR>Wonderful acting, technical advising, directing and of course writing.<BR>The war gore was intense, but no more intense than movies like \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\"<BR>This movie is a must see for every American who is old enough to understand it.  It will be a sure Academy Award Winner.<BR>Congratulations to everyone associated with the picture and thank you!
B000002GQH|4.0|Threshhold includes more rock songs than the two earlier Moody Blues albums and in this collection they are generally the ones most worth listening to. Justin Hayward's \\"Lovely to See You\\" is the best on the album and is superb high-energy, happy, and perfectly executed - an absolute 2-minute gem. Other good rockers are \\"Send Me No Wine\\" and \\"To Share Our Love\\", both by John Lodge, and \\"So Deep Within You\\" by Mike Pinder. These are easy, relaxed songs, not bound up in the cosmic imagery the early Moodies' are famous for.  Justin's \\"Never Comes the Day\\" starts quiet but turns into rock, very successfully.  Ray Thomas' \\"Dear Diary\\" is indeed \\"moody\\" and the closest thing to blues this band ever did since their original blues band incarnation, with a great flute solo that more than compensates for the questionable use of distorted underwater-sounding vocals.  \\"Are You Sitting Comfortably?\\" is gorgeous - one of the most beautiful songs this band ever recorded.  It refers to Merlin the magician, who is also visible in the cover painting.  Normally I don't care for the Moodies' spoken \\"poetry\\", but Graeme's \\"The Dream\\" pleases me, both in its seasonal images, and in Mike's eerie, orchestral sound effects.  \\"Have You Heard?\\" is a beautiful closing song, but marred by being split in two by \\"The Voyage\\", a kind of tour-de-force for Mike's mellotron that sounds like an imitation \\"2001\\" soundtrack.  Not really bad, but out of step with the rest of the album and tiresome after a few listens.  The only other song I actually dislike is \\"Lazy Day\\", in which Ray evokes the \\"Sunday Blahs\\" with such dead-on accuracy it's depressing - and who needs that?  Overall, a fine album, with a more relaxed, rocking feel than their earlier efforts.  One senses that they had reached the point where they knew they had achieved a gratifying level of initial success, and were enjoying it, not yet burdened by it, as they famously became a few years later.
B00005JKQX|4.0|\\"Beautiful Mind\\" has a wonderful(true) story with super acting.  Crowe will get an Academy Award for it and it will be well earned.  Watching this movie is a good lesson on what this type of mental illness is all about and how people with this disease suffer.  It is also a love story and a great advertisment for enduring marriage through thick and thin.  If you don't catch this at the theatre, be sure and check it out on DVD or video.
B000002GQJ|4.0|\\"Question of Balance\\" was the fifth and last good Moody Blues album of the original seven. The title is ironic because on this album they achieve a more \\"balanced\\" and appealing sound as a band than on any prior album. In particular the proper balance between Mike Pinder and Justin Hayward is finally struck. Mike's electronics are more diversified, playful and subtle, and Justin creates a wider range of sonic expression on electric guitar than in prior efforts. <br />Three songs stand out as first rate. \\"It's Up to You\\" by Justin is the best on the album, and one of my favorite Moodies' songs of all time. It is loose, energetic rock 'n roll, and I remember a rock guitarist commenting what fun it is to play leads like Justin's on this song.  Notice also, his gentle power chords during the \\"we have got nothing to lose\\" section - brilliant!  \\"How is It We are Here\\" is my favorite of all Mike Pinder's songs, thanks to the snappy beat of John Lodge's bass, Mike's brilliant use of electronic keyboards and Justin's guitar solo that seems to throw off fireworks. \\"Dawning is the Day\\" by Justin is also nice and tight.  There is an extended alternating of tonic-dominant chords just before the final section of repeating \\"Listen we think we have found you\\", during which Graeme, the ever-subtle and unobtrusive drummer, punctuates Justin's strums with off-beat wiggles of percussion that make you feel something is about to be born.  Graeme can do that to you, even if you are not paying attention to him.  <br />Most of the other songs are enjoyable, if unexceptional, and it is pleasing to see Graeme, the shyest writer of the group, score with \\"Don't You Feel Small?\\" The original hit single of \\"Question\\" included a knock-out fast acoustic guitar introduction by Justin that in the album version is overwhelmed by the bombastic \\"TA-DA\\" orchestral sound that ruins this segment of the otherwise good song. \\"Melancholy Man\\" includes a spectacular electronic keyboard instrumental section that climaxes with a descending cascade of notes like a shower of falling stars that alone makes this otherwise dull song by Mike well worth listening to. John's \\"Tortoise and Hare\\" tries a little too earnestly to be a hard rocker, but I enjoy it anyway.  \\"Minstrel's Song\\", John's other contribution is enjoyable only up to a point, and overstays its welcome.  Ray Thomas' two songs are overly sweet and I usually skip over them.  Overall, another very strong album from this unique band.
0385505833|3.0|I really liked the concept.  Watching them go through everything to &quot;get out of doing&quot; Christmas was great fun.  The ending was a real let down.
B000002GQL|1.0|Just so you know where I'm coming from, I think that what the Moody Blues produced from 1967-1970 is one of the great legacies of the rock era. I am less familiar with their post-1981 output, but much of what I've heard is likeable.  I'm glad you are interested in the Moodies and encourage you to explore their first five albums.  With that said, I cannot recommend Seventh Sojourn (1972).  Every song is either plodding and dull or sticky sweet. The worst offenders are John Lodge's two offerings on Sojourn. \\"Isn't Life Strange?\\" is like gooey treacle.  Compare it to the unsentimental beauty of John's \\"Eyes of a Child\\" on \\"Children's Children\\".  \\"I'm Just a Singer in a Rock 'n Roll Band\\", with its forced energy and \\"is it over yet?\\" conclusion gives rock 'n roll a bad name.  Compare it to the natural-sounding energy of John's \\"Ride My See Saw\\", on \\"Lost Chord\\" or \\"To Share Our Love\\" on \\"Threshold\\".  Even ace songwriter Justin Hayward flops here, with little cream-puff ditties and inane lyrics: \\"All we are trying to say is we are all we've got\\".  Compare them to the passion of his \\"Gypsy\\" on \\"Children\\", The Actor on \\"Lost Chord\\", or the perfect rock 'n roll gem \\"It's Up to You\\", on \\"Question of Balance\\".  Mike Pinder seems to be the only one of the bunch who's really putting effort into his songs, but the results are ponderous and do not wear well.  Do I blame the Moodies for running out of ideas or cashing in on this album's enormous sales? Of course not. Obviously they pleased many people and they deserved the recognition. But because there is not one song in this collection that I enjoy, one star is all they're getting from this loyal fan.
0156012197|5.0|The first time I read this book was in secondary school. At that time, it was just a story to me. It was about the journey of a little prince from planet to planet. A few years later, I read this book again. The feeling is totally different. It is not simply a story. It can make me be aware of the baobabs in the adult world, the world I begin to go into. It also reminds me of what is important in my life. <br />Adults, in general, are superficial. They only know to work, work and work. They would like to do what other people do. And they are indulged in command and obey without asking why, just like the kings, conceited men, drunkards, businessmen, lamplighters and geographers. Rarely do they think about the meaning of their life. Why are adults occupied by baobabs? Why can't they find what are important in their life? <br />How about you? Do you find what is important in your life? The little prince has already found - Love with the rose and friendship with the pilot and fox. Don't be occupied by baobabs. \\"One sees clearly only with the heart. Anything essential is invisible to the eyes\\" Then can you find what is important in your life.
B000002GQE|4.0|An album of pop songs interspersed with orchestral segues is a dangerous idea that probably shouldn't be tried again, but the Moody Blues pulled it off fairly well.  The first third of the album, where the orchestra is prominent, is tiresome, but once the suite of songs kicks into high gear with \\"Peak Hour\\" and `Tuesday Afternoon\\", you are in the spell of one of the great and most unique bands of all time in a maiden voyage of uncommon beauty.  An overlooked gem is \\"Twilight Time\\", one of Ray Thomas' best songs ever, a rocker pulsed by a hammering piano bass line, Justin Hayward's evocative backing vocal, and colorful imagery that really works.  Unfortunately you can't sample this song here since it is coupled on the same track as the much less interesting &quot;Sunset&quot;.  \\"Nights in White Satin\\" is overplayed, and the Moodies' reputation is excessively connected to this song, so it is easy to forget that it once sounded fresh.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I dont want to bore you with information that you do not need.  I will stick to the point and tell you that this cd is a success no matter what you hear from other people about her age(22) her diva-esque qualities(mature for her age), whatever the matter, Norah Jones has delivered an album that you will find hard to forget.  What i find even more impressive is that she actually wrote or co-wrote some of the songs on the album.  She is very in touch with her vocal capabilities and does not overreach by any means.  This is an experimental jazz/country/pop/blues album that actually works and that is all you need to know.  And on top of all of that, the price is great!
B00001NFCY|5.0|Whoever said that a band cannot rock out with sensitivity and spiritual awareness has obviously not had the pleasure of listening to the inspirational anthems of Creed. &quot;Human Clay&quot; brings forth the most interesting aspects of the human experience -- everything from the pain of losing a loved one (&quot;Beautiful&quot;) to welcoming the creation of new life (&quot;With Arms Wide Open&quot;). Creed has managed to inspire me and change my attitudes on some things without being overtly soft or preachy. Definitely check this album out.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I'll admit:  I didn't understand the Harry Potter phenomenon at all... and I can honestly say it was a good movie!<br />The storyline is familiar to everyone, so I'll spare you the details.  The acting is really good, especially from the faculty of Hogwarts.  Even the kids are decent actors!<br />The special effects are also really good, although they can look a little fake at times.  But overall, this movie is a fun experience.  After seeing it, I read all four books and am anxiously awaiting number five.  That's what a good movie can do!
B00000J7JO|4.0|I've been putting off reviewing this CD for so long; I just didn't know exactly what to say.  I don't really like this CD.  I listen to it very rarely, and I just don't get very excited listening to it.  Blood Sugar is my favorite Chili Peppers CD, and I don't think that's going to change.  So why did I give this 4 stars?  You just can't deny the fact that this is a well written album that shows a lot of emotion.  I loved the all out energy and crazy funk riffs of Blood Sugar, but the songs on Californication show a lot of maturity and that whole &quot;less is more&quot; style.  So instead of giving it 3 stars like I would have, I gave it 4 to show that it is a quality album.  My personal favorites are Around the World, Parallel Universe, Get on Top, Easily, and Purple Stain.  So the best advice I can give is listen to it first.  Borrow a friends or listen to the samples here.
0553213105|5.0|This was my second Austen novel, my first being Sense and Sensibility. I liked the first, but was blown away by this one. I adored all the characters, and although I knew (like everyone else) the whole time what would happen in the end, I was still overjoyed when the novel was resolved. However, I was dissappointed. I didn't want it to ever end! That's the mark of a good book. When you're done with it, you wish you had never read it just so you could read it for the fist time again. That's exactly how I felt with this novel. I could read it forever. I would reccomend it to anyone who remotely enjoys reading.
B00000J7JO|4.0|I've been putting off reviewing this CD for so long; I just didn't know exactly what to say.  I don't really like this CD.  I listen to it very rarely, and I just don't get very excited listening to it.  Blood Sugar is my favorite Chili Peppers CD, and I don't think that's going to change.  So why did I give this 4 stars?  You just can't deny the fact that this is a well written album that shows a lot of emotion.  I loved the all out energy and crazy funk riffs of Blood Sugar, but the songs on Californication show a lot of maturity and that whole &quot;less is more&quot; style.  So instead of giving it 3 stars like I would have, I gave it 4 to show that it is a quality album.  My personal favorites are Around the World, Parallel Universe, Get on Top, Easily, and Purple Stain.  So the best advice I can give is listen to it first.  Borrow a friends or listen to the samples here.

B00005O5CM|4.0|A friend lent me this DVD couple weeks ago and I absolutely had no expectation of the film.  The film actually made its theatrical release during the time of the year when box offices tend to slack - after summer and before Thanksgiving-Christmas push.  Anyway, the point made is that I'm so darn wrong about this film.  The first impression is not always right.  Legally Blonde is fun, inspring but not over-done.<br />Elle (Reese Witherspoon), a graduating fashion marketing major from CULA, had next tried hard for anything in her life.  Her well-to-do parents provide.  She is home-coming queen and the head of the sorority house she stayed in.  She is fashion savy and deeply in love with her boyfriend, Warner Huntington III.  Expecting Warner to propose to her on a very romantic date, her boyfriend instead decided to break up with her and leave for Harvard Law School because Elle was not serious and scholarly (well, hmmm...because blonde is usually flashy and flaunty) enough to be his girlfriend and that in order to be a future senator, Warner demanded a woman of more political charisma.  Her life collapsed and her dream shattered.  Brokenhearted and shattered, Elle realized that her only chance of getting Warner back was to pursue his interest and apply for Harvard Law.  <br />The first part of the film is quite predictable in its plot.  What I really come to like about the film is the portrayal of Elle's character.  It is inspiring to see her transform through the film.  It also surprises many that though a fashion savy, Elle is not some stupid air headed bimbo as her appearance suggests her to be.  Elle is likable, amiable, heart-warming, and good-hearted.  The part where she befriends with the manucurist and helps her get the dog back really touches me.  I'm sure that the audience must have felt for her and wanted to see her succeed among her colleagues in school and win the approval of the Harvard elite.  Elle worked hard and exceled in her schoolwork.  Later on when she worked as an intern on defending a murder case, she was confused and frustrated about how people didn't take her seriously.  The result of that is maturing of her character.  Elle herself taught us how our first impression is not always right.  I don't want to give away too much of the story just so to ruin your viewing pleasure.  But Legally Blonde is a warm comedy that is worth seeing.
B00005U18E|4.0|I really liked this movie. I haven't read the book, but now I plan to. Renee was great as Bridget, and I can most definitely identify somewhat w/ Bridget, except for the drinking. lol! The reason I gave it four stars, rather than five was because, 1-Colin Firth character, Mark, wasn't in it enough, for me to really get a feel for his character--not sure how much he's in the book though, and 2-Renee gained 20 pounds for the movie, I really want to know where. lol! You can tell in her face that she gained weight, but the weight on her body looked just right for her. I think she needed a few more pounds on her body as Bridget--that's the consensus I've been getting from people who have read the book. But all in all, I really enjoyed the movie, and will watch it over and over. It's now in my top list of favorite films. :)
0393317552|5.0|This is possibly the best 'big picture' book of human history ever, and one of the few books i'll give 5 stars.  Diamond sets out to understand why it was Europeans who became the dominant force in human history, and makes a thrilling case for a sort of geographical/biological determinism based on the superior mutability of grains and livestock available to them.  My 16 years of social studies and geography classes was suddenly converted into pale, false, useless colors; it all could have been captured better by just reading this book.  'GGS' is definitely repititive, overly long, and will certainly cause endless arguments among the philosopher kings about this and that, how it is racist, nationalist, blah blah.  At the end of the day debates about this book are the modern equivalent of earlier popular debates: does geology exist? does evolution exist? is women's suffrage the right thing to do?  hmmmm... not so hard to answer those in retrospect, nor mr diamonds excellent points in GGS.
B00005JKJA|5.0|A movie that must be seen to be believed. Don't read any reviews (other than this one) or do any research on this film. Just see it. A superb, wonderfully acted masterpiece that makes every other film released this year seem like \\"Dude, Where's my Car?\\".<BR>The usual Lynch motifs are in place of course. He introduces characters in the film and never explains their prescence (who was that guy in the wheelchair?) and storylines come and go with no resolution. Pay Attention!!!
0060930187|5.0|A small insight into Sylvia Plath's amazing mind, this novel charts the path into psychosis for a young women. Touching, sad, interesting. This is a great book for anyone interested in the human spirit.
B000001I0K|5.0|Not only is this the BEST Cramps album, but it's one of my all-time faovrite albums.  It's one of those records that has never grown old after thousands of plays.<br />There are Cramps original compositions (CAVEMAN is classic - \\"look man, make tool, caveman NO FOOL!!!!) and TONS of cover tunes, but they make the cover tunes their own with the Cramps style.  A classic album.  I like SONGS THE LORD TAUGHT US, but it's  little more 'scratchy' and high end.<br />To quote some of the liner note adjectives, Psychedelic Jungle throbs, bumps, oozes, lurches and is heavy all-around good time rockabilly. <br />I'm a drummer and I continually love to hear Nick Knox beat the skins on this record. Fun stuff. My band has covered GREEN DOOR and THE CRUSHER from this album. Of course, these are covers for the CRAMPS too, but we love the way the CRAMPS perform them.<br />If you enjoy this album, then get THE MUMMIES 'NEVER BEEN CAUGHT\\" another classic.  Thanks for reading.
B00005UEAR|4.0|I bought the record try and find out why the opinions about it were extremely divided: either very good, or very bad (mostly on early Amazon reviews).<BR>Let's see why this record wouldn't please some: the tracks are long (6 total over 2 discs), long instrumental bridges, and, yes, sometimes the album is heavier than usually heard nowadays. Well, those are the very reasons that would appeal to others. And in my heart of hearts, I don't really think that a true DT fan will be disappointed with this CD, because, along with the aforementioned elements, in general I found it to be what DT is about. I think it is a natural step in their music.<BR>I've read some complaints about the unnecesary extent of the instrumental bridges, as if the guys of DT are boasting about their talents. Well, as far as I'm concern, that is one of the characteristics of progressive music, one of the strongest influences in DT music. As long as the musicians know how to play, it's really a plesure to hear them showing their skills. But forget about the players, it's all about the music. What DT is doing is serving as a vehicle to contribute to the almost lost art of listening to music. It's nor easy listening or comercial. But DT has never been one or the other.<BR>So, if you are a DT fan, or musically open minded, give this one a shot. Discover by yourself how good this album is. Otherwise, stay away, and keep listening to commercial radio or watching MTV.
0930289234|5.0|I bought a hardcover copy of this book-without the dustjacket-in a used bookstore...  I sat down and read the volume and was utterly amazed.  This is a classic of the comic book world.  The collaboration between Moore's writing and Gibbons' artwork is jaw-dropping.  I don't know how they began to even start this complex creation of words and pictures.  Intricate, amazing and wholedheartedly fun, WATCHMEN is a must.<br />SIDE NOTE: Rorschach is one of the greatest, spookiest and saddest comic characters ever to grace a comic page.
B000001FS3|5.0|I was an and am a U2 fan since here early days with Boy, War and October and in many cases a band is usually best when there young and hungry, but not in U2s case. They started out brilliantly and got even better. Joshua Tree is just an outstanding album, every song is great and it has a feel to it, a sadness, a beauty, something that is mood altering and allows one when listening to slip into a stare of contemplation. When I first got this CD years ago I played the heck out of it and I continue to play it to this day. It simply is one of those must have rock n roll albums that everyone should have.
0553278223|1.0|I bought this book about a week ago and i was looking forward to reading it. I thought it had a cool cover. You know what they say. You can judge a book by it's cover. The martian chronicles was a horrible book! Anyone who is reading this dont buy this book. It was so loooooong and booooring. It had no point to it besides how peole live on mars. I recommend you don't read this book it was boring and a waste of time.
9626346205|2.0|The abridged audio version of this book boils 800+ pages down to 3 cassettes, which results in a recitation of the plot with little characterization, historical background or social context. The reader was very good however, and if she does the unabridged version I'd opt for that one.
076790382X|4.0|I gave in to a friend suggesting I read Bryson's work, and I'm glad I did, as I got more good chuckles and laugh-out-loud moments out of this book than in anything I've read in many months.<br />It's probably inevitable that Bryson would be compared to other modern humorists.  The comparison to Dave Barry is apt largely because they both write brief essays on specific topics, and both tend to end their essays with sudden and silly references to something the touched on earlier in the essay.  Though the comparison really ends there, since Barry seems more taken with bathroom humor and taking a ridiculous idea to its absurd extreme than is Bryson.<br />Bryson seems more inclined to touch on issues that seem to have gone to a ridiculous extreme on their own, and that combined with his use of wordplay seem reminscent of Douglas Adams (Adams' bit in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy about the notice that Arthur Dent's house is going to be bulldozed being locked safely somewhere that Dent couldn't possibly find it could easily have been written by Bryson).  His essay &quot;What's Cooking&quot;, about the ridiculousness of ordering at a fancy restaurant, had me rolling on my side, and I've read parts of it to several friends.  &quot;Mail Call&quot;, an ode to the US Postal Service (and Britain's Royal Mail) is equally funny, and has real heart behind it.<br />The charm of Bryson's writing here is the perspective of an American having been Anglicized and then returning to the US after 20 years.  The contrast in cultures, portrayed by someone who's experienced both of them, is endearing, and Bryson makes it clear that when you move you're always giving something up, but getting something new and wonderful in exchange.  It's almost enough to make me move to Britain to have the same experience myself.<br />Alas, the essays - originally written for weekly publication in Britain - become less insightful as time passes, and as Bryson acclimates to his new life in America.  He focuses more and more on general ridiculousness in life, and less on the contrast between America and Britain, which is where the book's soul lies.  So, for instance, essays about the difficulty of using a Windows-based computer, or about the film Titanic, fall flat.  And the essay on the US income tax forms seems entirely generic (what, for instance, are the British forms like, I wonder?).<br />Despite this, fans of lively humor essayists should certainly give this a try.  Another good comparison might be with Richard Feynman's autobiographical Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman; both books are funny, uplifting, and make you feel good just to be alive.  It's heartwarming to know that there are people like Bryson in the world.focuses more and more on general ridiculousness in life, and less on the contrast between America and Britain, which is where the book's soul lies.

B00000DHR0|5.0|I recieved this early Christmas in December 2001, from mon maman's friend... (I'm trying to speak French, I'm still learning!). Anyways this Xmas album is wonderful, it's the best. If you buy it now, you'll cherish it for alife time!! I have to admit that comparing to other female pop singers, etc like britney spears (i hate her,lol), christina aguilera, mariah carey, lara fabian.... Celine is the number one singer out of all of them!!!!!!! Celine has a heaven sent voice unlike the other singers that I have mentioned, I don't like other singers, only Celine. (I like gospel music tho)!!!! But that's it. So now back to the album,:)!! This album starts off with O Holy Night, this song is beautiful. Then it ends with Les Cloches Du Hameau, Celine sings with her family at this song, very well made. My fav songs are another year has gone by, the title track, and i'm your angel!! Go out and but this album it's worth every red cent. Celine U R THE BEST SINGER IN THIS WHOLE INTIRE WORLD, YEH!

B00005214X|2.0|Unfortunately, my high-end system really exposes horrible sound recording/mastering on this CD.  Screechy guitar, muddy sounding vocals, etc.  Buy an LP if you can, or maybe the original CDs.
B00003CXXP|1.0|Somehow even my 17 year old couldn't get into this movie. Really was hoping for more, it just kept dragging along.
B000002W9Q|5.0|The movie is one of my favortie movies and so is the soundtrack.  It is wonderful.  It has so many great songs on it.
B000006045|4.0|Massive Attack's third album Mezzanine is a hard album to describe to someone who has never heard it. It has a very dark nature to it that might be expected from an Industrial act but at the same time it can be calm and relaxing. I do not like to use labels on Electronica music but &quot;Trip Hop&quot; is an appropriate term for this record. The feel of the record is a lot like a trip. You can put some head phones on and let it take you to a different world. It has heavy hip hop beats and the male vocal tracks are on the verge of being hip hop. It has the dark and urban feel of DJ Shadow and the mellow and laidback feel of Portishead. It takes some time getting use to. At first, I thought it was average and then I thought it was brilliant but now I think it is just damn good. There are moments in this record that deserve a 5 star rating but the album all together can get repetitive and is not as amazing as songs like &quot;Angle&quot; and &quot;Rising Son&quot; and &quot;Interia Creeps.&quot; It is well worth buying and after buying &quot;Mezzanine&quot; I will definitely check out Massive Attack's other albums.
6302636779|5.0|\\"The Nun's Story\\" ranks with \\"Citizen Kane\\", \\"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\", and \\"Chinatown\\", as one of the very best films ever produced in Hollywood. Its director, Fred Zinnemann, has never received a fraction of the credit he deserves, for this and for other masterpieces of intelligent narrative filmmaking such as 1966's \\"A Man for All Seasons\\", perhaps because he serves his stories so well that Oscar Wilde's dictum -- that the aim of art is to reveal art and conceal the artist -- has been all too well fulfilled. What I truly love about the story of Sister Luke is that it is in no sense a polemic: it is possible to see that, for certain persons (such as the Reverend Mother, played to angelic perfection by Edith Evans), the \\"Holy Rule\\" can indeed be the way to a blissful sense of unity with the eternal, while for a creative and dynamic spirit like Sister Luke's, that same discipline can ultimately only stifle and defeat that which makes her fully human.The scene in which Sister Marcella urges her to fail her medical qualifying examinations deliberately, in order to combat her sense of intellectual pride, is one of the most exquisite moments in cinema -- there is no doubt that this is, in every sense, a monstrous demand, while there is also no doubt that the person suggesting it is doing it out of a genuine sense of concern for the young nun. (Where on earth is this type of mature moral complexity in today's movies?) The only aspect of the film that is likely to trouble intelligent viewers is the racial subtext of the Congo scenes. To hear adult Congolese men casually referred to as \\"boys\\" is cringe-inducing; and that the Catholic Church was perfectly willing to segregate blacks and whites in different hospitals (the one for the Congolese being of course vastly inferior in services and facilities)shows just how far we as a species have yet to go on the road to civilization. But this is a blemish on a large-souled and utterly transfixing work.The relationship between Sister Luke and Dr. Fortunati (the late Peter Finch in a flawless performance)is one that every aspiring filmmaker should be tied to a chair and forced to watch a dozen times, in order to see how real adults interact, when they have something more important (gasp!)than sex at the center of their concerns. Whatever one's own religious beliefs, or lack of them, this is the finest portrayal I know of on film of what it means to seek transcendence in life; and that is, for all decent persons, the Question of Questions. I cannot believe that any person who sees \\"The Nun's Story\\" will not feel that their own search for the lasting values in human existence has not been helped on its way by this beautiful film.
