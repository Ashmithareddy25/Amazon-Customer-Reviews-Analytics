B00GS1WO4A|3|For the price, this was a good deal, but it is a little disappointing. The blades aren't a huge issue. They seem to keep a reasonable sharpness and last me about ten shaves per blade.<br /><br />My issue is with the razor stick. It is heavy and feels good in your hand, but if you look closely at the head you'll see that it is a pretty solid block. This isn't what you want. Check out the head of the Trac II. There are large openings on both the top and sides to let hair and shaving cream to wash out. The stick that I was sent just jams up after every one or two swipes and I have to move the blade to the side and wash it out.<br /><br />I didn't know that this was so important at the time. I'm actually buying a different razor stick now and came back to write this review in irritation.
B004X8AFCI|4|These puffs are decent. I use them for loose powder. I would have rated them a 5 had they been thicker. I cut off the ribbon so that I can easily use both sides.
B000E7SRTA|5|One of my favorite scents.  Very pleasant.
B008YEMWOG|5|A simple easy way to help keep your teeth clean and help to prevent unnecessary extra  build up of plaque on your teeth. True these are not the same professional tools that your dentist uses but this care kit if used properly will make it easier for you and your dentist when you go for a check up or have your teeth cleaned.<br /> The few extra minutes you spend to do the work using these tools as well as brushing your teeth and rinsing with mouthwash, will make quite a difference in maintaining the care needed to keep your gums and teeth healthy. Do no think of it a chore that has to be done, but think of it as help in keeping your teeth clean. It is a simple as that. Now quit your bitching and do the exercise.
B00DBCP6M6|3|Not as big as i thought it was. No room to put your cash in. But like the colors and it does fit my phone.
B00JIN8BTW|5|Sure, you'll look sort of like Hannibal Lector while wearing this along with your face mask, but it allows you to go about normal tasks without your mask falling straight off of your face. Multi-tasking while moisturizing. Daiso has it covered. Buy it from Amazon if, like me, you live nowhere near a wonderful Daiso Japan store.
B003N2TIZK|5|was looking for a wooden razor holder and brush stand for a while, and came across this and it is compact and elegant.  Provided you dry off your razor and squeeze out excess water from the brush before using, it will last a long time.  Happy with this for sure.
B0046QGKVW|5|Excellent
B00FH6XFHM|4|Barrette was a bit smaller than I expected - but I like it!
B008SIO2UK|2|I love the quick arrival of the product.  It didn't look as great on me as it does on the model in the photo.
B004NRDZYE|4|I think I have tried at least 4 different whitening products- major brands, off brands etc and have had mixed or insufficent results with all of these products. Many of them left spots on my teeth and where they did whiten looked uneven with the rest of my teeth.   I tried this whitening product on the advice of a friend and was really surprised to not have the issues I had with other whitening products. And of course getting an extra/free gift (lipgloss in this case) always is a good thing.    Definitely would suggest to family/friends.
B00BA3IKFI|3|It doesn't seem as good as the first one I had ordered from QVC. Maybe its an old formula. alright.
B00J44LM3M|5|Love this stuff! I use this mixed with garlic powder and mayo etc. over salad and vegetables...nice way to take your daily dose.
B000NE6QP6|4|My favorite shampoo...even if it's a little spendy!
B00BEQGC5G|4|My family purchased the Sally Hensen starter gel kit from Walmart some time ago. We had to play around with it a little because the polish peeled so easily. One thing I've noticed is that if you use thick layers of polish it WILL peel off very easily.  That was the issue I believe that we were having.<br /><br />Now, I've purchased this refill kit a few days ago from Amazon and I don't know. It seemed as though the polishes had been used. There seemed to be barely anything in there? I sook it up and all, but the brush seemed so dry compared to when I purchased in stores. I've tried sensational's gel polish and I love their base and top coat. Today I used a different type of gel color along with this kit, so I'm hoping that it doesn't mess up. I do love the cleansing pads, but I prefer to use a little alcohol and a cotton ball instead.
B004HEYPLU|5|It's great. Mom likes it!!
B0080L9FHA|4|Dislike the texture which is a little on the runny side; However, it definitely gets the job done by whitening the teeth.
B000052XZZ|5|works as advertised and is worth using despite the tar smell people note in their reviews. I noticed a change by the second time.
B000S8O3VQ|4|Ezy Dose Monthly Pill Organizer and Reminder. Very convenient and easy to use. Will recommend to friends. Why do you require that I send feedback according to your procedure? It's no longer voluntary.
B0012ZSP40|5|THIS ITEM WAS HARD TO FIND SINCE IT HAS BEEN DISCONTINUED. I AM THRILLED TO GET IT I LOVE IT.<br />I CHECK AMAZON FIRST ALWAYS. SAVES ME TIME. AND SHIPPING WITH PRIME.
B009X62WM6|5|Been using this for years.....no longer can find it in stores.  Love this product.  So.glad to.have found it here.
B00116VG0K|5|I originally found out about this product from the Rachel Ray show.  I thought the product looked really great but was waiting for the high price tag.  As soon as I heard that it was being sold for an affordable price I immediately ordered one.  I love that this product is inspired by threading.  I have been getting my eyebrows and upper lip threaded for about a year now so I'm used to the sensation of having the hair pulled out, so I knew that this product would be great for me. This is a great item, it works exactly as it should and I'm ecstatic that I can now get this done at home and not have to go to the salon.
B00JVZP7NK|4|I actually really enjoy this lipstick & it smells like coco butter 👌
B00AVJ3TJO|5|a great gift
B00SZ3P35G|5|I have a small head for an adult women. I've been through many types of caps, and this is the best one for my u-part wigs. It's sturdy and has a snug fit.
B00WOROGWU|5|I have used this serum for a week now and so far, I'm loving this serum!  The very first night I put this serum on, I woke up with my skin feeing so soft and moist without any irritation. It even smells amazing. After using this for a week, I even noticed that wrinkles around my eye area are less noticible. I'm very happy with this product and I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wishes to have a younger looking skin.
B004V46JQA|5|Oddly enough.<br /><br />it is a pretty color, and depending on what you hold your hand against, the color changes.  If you hold it against red it is an almost neon orange, but against other colors it is a firey coral-red.<br /><br />One coat would probably do with this, as the coverage is very good.  i used two, and cured for three minutes each under UV (which was probably too long.)<br /><br />The matching laquer is a nice touch--and it does match perfectly.  This makes it a wonderful value.
B005LCTIZK|5|My teenage daughter uses this and it works well for her long fine, fair hair.<br />It has no chemicals in which I like...
B0015KHMRS|1|The worst item I have ever bought to get the hair cut. The motor is not powerful and doesn't shave well. I regretted that I bought it.<br /><br />It is NOT recommended!
B003VI0HVA|5|I have thick waist length hair. So when I read the reviews about this product could not wait to try. Finally did and I love it. It does exactly what the sellers said it would. I would definitely recommend this product and repurchase it again
B00OY4JV9O|5|Love this back brush...Curved handle is excellent!
B00SMIIR0W|4|I was able to try out for free the new schick hydro silk trimstyle razor & bikini trimmer from bzzagent. I have used other schick hydro silk products and love the smooth shave this line offers. I love that the hydro silk trimstyle razor & trimmer can work wet or dry. It makes a close shave, but still leaves your skin feeling smooth. I am prone to bumps from shaving and have not had this problem at all with this razor or trimmer! It is battery operated and includes a battery. The battery power for the trimmer makes it work to trim and does so efficiently. It also fits in your hand to be able to hold the razor easily for shaving, but it is a little wider handle than your average razor.
B00016XJ4M|5|Omg only been using this for 2 days and I love it! I bought this toner at GNC about 2 days ago and use it after I wash my face in the morning and at night and I have very sensitive skin which toner usually burns but this stuff doesn't burn and smells like fresh cut roses. I had acne scabs from popping my pimples and after using it 1 time before going to bed my scabs were healed and there was just a little redness from where they were. I have already noticed a difference in my skin after only 2 days. I'm so glad I found this toner!
B0000AFUT3|1|Bought this lighted mirror a year and one half ago. Doesn't work at all now.<br />Spend a little more money and get something better.
B007I6SQEQ|5|great milky soap
B009PJ8DZG|4|As hair clips go, these work fine, and have a strong grip. However, not all the colors came in pairs. I got 2 lime, 2 lavender, 2 lt. blue, 2 yellow, 1 darker blue and 3 orange. I wear a small clip on either side of my hair, so can't wear the blue ones. Just be forewarned... it says &#34;assorted colors&#34;, just don't be surprised if they don't pair up. Perhaps my set was just a fluke.
B001VEK1E4|5|I have tried several electric shavers and none of them worked for my face.  I have a really sensitive face.  I got this product several months ago and it is the only thing I have used 99% times to shave my face with... it took me a few tries to get used to it... it cleans itself. it is really a great affordable shaver.  Around Xmass time I recommended it to a lady I work with as a gift to her husband.
B00CXAE0J2|5|I love the coverage and separation of the lashes. My lashes are full and long. I don't have an issue with clumps either.
B00AW39M4K|3|Color was darker than described
B00CIYD7WY|5|I love these creams. As good, if not better, as the high end brands I have spent far too much on at Sephora! I wish I had known about these earlier. I could have saved a substantial amount of money. I also started purchasing them for my mother, and she has become a big fan of the brand.
B00GC598UK|5|Works really well. smells great, feels great!
B0028Z2PDA|5|We get ours at a dollar store! I love this stuff! It does take the tangles out but that's not what I use it for. My daughter's hair is curly/wavy (wurly?) and I spray it in her hair till it's damp and then I scrunch it. This stuff leaves her hair smelling like watermelon blow pops all day and helps to tame her hair, it doesn't look nearly as frizzy when I use it! :) I'd recommend it to anyone. :):)
B006T9BBM2|4|Didn't like the packaging much though but lovely colours
B000O3UKNK|5|Nioxin really works if you have thining hair or a flaky scalp (althought its effects are temporary). It has a pungent but relaxing menthol smell and removes alot of impurities. It is one of my favorite conditioners.
B00EIN9XTY|5|The bow is adorable and it's even better that it can detach from the headband. I've gotten a lot of compliments on it and I love it!
B00GUNYDAE|4|Got these for my Mom. She's a diabetic and her heels get so dry! These really do help, even without creams/lotions. They slide on easily, and stay put. She wears them as she sleeps, since she says she can feel the &#34;line&#34; where they stop before her toes if she's wearing shoes.<br />I'd give them 5 stars, but they are TINY. Luckily, Mom has tiny feet, so it works, but my big ol' clod-hopper feet would never fit in there. So, Mom doesn't have to share, and she probably considers that worth 5 stars!
B0040BK082|5|Just got my UV lamp in the other night and I opened it immediately. No damage in the shipping, boxed and wrapped nicely. I used it to do my own Gelish gel nail polish manicure at home. It worked perfectly. It has a timer with a switch 120 seconds or 180 seconds. That makes it easy because for Gelish the top coat and dark polish colors need two minute cure times, so that was really convenient. I paid about $30 for this lamp and now I can do my own gel nails at home. It would normally cost $30 per visit to get it done at the salon. Now I have perfect salon quality gel nails and I don't have to make appointments. I love my nails, and now I love this lamp.
B004GINGOY|5|I purchased the fine grain Dead Sea Salt crystals having received no encouraging news from my dermatologist that the sebhorrheic dermatitis which was residing on my face, would ever settle down or be easier to live with. I took the lead and did some searching for holistic/natural methods and found that using this salt as a face wash demonstrated a large improvement. I was willing to give anything a try that didn't involve prescription medication/steroids.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised and extremely excited to see the redness reduce and the burning subside. I use CeraVae wash to cleans my skin followed by a warm solution of water and Dead Sea Salt crystal splashed over the affected areas, then rinse with clear water; pat my skin dry and then if any scaling or tight feeling patches I use a think coat of Aveeno Eczema Relief.<br /><br />I have been following this regimen since late 2014. Sometimes my skin is so clear the SD seems like it's completely cleared up.<br /><br />My satisfaction with the Dead Sea Salt crystals has been exceeded. Thank you San Francisco Bath Salt Company for &#34;saving&#34; my skin!
B000065DJY|4|Does what i want :)
B000V4O1UA|4|(3.5 points)<br />I had bought a Phillips Sonicare on the recommendation of my dental hygienist a month before Ultreo, so I was able to compare these toothbrushes for several days.<br /><br />Brushing action:<br />Phillips Sonicare cleans teeth by using a \\"sonic energy\\" created by 30K+ bristle sweeps a minute. The bristle sweeps do a great job of getting my teeth super clean that they don't feel \\"furry\\" even after the whole day. If you've been using a manual brush before Sonicare then you'll notice that your teeth will soon be noticeably whiter and will feel cleaner.<br /><br />Ultreo by comparison uses ultrasound energy. The ultrasound energy must travel through a medium and therefore you are required to keep the brush wet  and have enough liquid in your mouth. The ultrasound energy then transforms the liquid into \\"micro-bubbles\\" which \\"scrub\\" your teeth clean. The fewer bristles on an ultreo make it a gentler way to clean your teeth as it uses liquid as the scrubbing medium.<br /><br />The verdict? - My gums being sensitive, prefer the Ultreo which massages them with the microbubbles. However, my teeth feel cleaner and more plaque free with the Sonicare. With the Ultreo I don't get the super-smooth feeling on my teeth like I do with the Sonicare.<br /><br />Design and Ergonomics:<br />Sonicare wins this one as it is lighter, has a thin tapered flex design which feels more natural. Its brush head is also smaller than the Ultreo. That makes it easy to maneuver in your mouth and get into those hard to reach places. The bristle design makes it ideal to get in between teeth and do a good scrubbing job.  You can also change the speed from Max to Gentle, a feature not found on the Ultreo because it never gets as intense as the Sonicare.<br /><br />The Ultreo has a rubber band like center called the \\"waveguide\\" and a circle of bristles around it. Somehow I find it hard to keep the bristles of the Ultreo positioned comfortably on  my teeth. Since the bristles are higher than the waveguide in the middle, there is a tendency to apply too much pressure on the brush which reduces its effectiveness. It is also less \\"bendy\\" than the Sonicare which slightly limits its maneuverability. Both Ultreo and Sonicare shut off after 2 mins and play a tune after each 30 sec so you can switch quadrants. The Ultreo arcade style tune is more fun while the Sonicare just gives a beep.<br /><br />Verdict: Both have good design elements but Sonicare has a slight edge over Ultreo.<br /><br />Cost:<br />Sonicare is cheaper than Ultreo and you can get 2 brush handles and 2 heads pack (e9650) of Sonicare for a lower price than Ultreo 1 handle brush pack. But it's the replacement costs that matter more. Sonicare brush heads are available for less than half the cost of Ultreo brush heads. That might be a deal breaker for some as the brush heads are to be replaced every 2-3 months.<br /><br />Verdict: Sonicare scores a big one over Ultreo on the price dimension. Ultreo really needs to bring down the cost of the replacement brush heads.<br /><br />In the last 15 days of usage, (mornings with Sonicare, evenings with Ultreo first week and flip order next week) I prefer Sonicare. However, Ultreo is still a good brush for those with more sensitive gums and I'm giving it 3.5 points.<br /><br />Final Verdict: This seems like a good brush for those who don't like the intensity of a Sonicare but still want clean teeth. If the manufacturer can also give more information on how ultrasound technology is better in comparison with other technologies it would help convince users to pay more for the Ultreo.cy to apply too much pressure on the brush which reduces its effectiveness. It is also less \\"bendy\\" than the Sonicare which slightly limits its maneuverability. Both Ultreo and Sonicare shut off after 2 mins and play a tune after each 30 sec so you can switch quadrants.

B005WWQXB6|5|WHERE WAS THIS PRODUCT WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL? Really, it would have saved my poor mother from endless nights of whining and crying because it hurt when she brushed my wet hair.<br />I have an extremely sensitive scalp and this brush is actually a miracle product.
B00L1S4D3U|5|Excellent moisturizing  skin cream you wouldn't be disappointed. It helped me with my very dry skin.
B00H5LFIAO|5|Perfect !! Received right on time for my huge date tomorrow 👍🏾. I didn't have any problems with the top, everything was perfect and the smell was great. I purchased Fiji , I'm not sure about the other ones but this will not be the last body spray I purchase from old spice 👍🏾.
B00AFCPA26|4|I love that this razor has single blade in the reverse position for tight spots (under the nostrils, for example).  The 5 razor head does provide a clean shave and generally does not require passing over the same spot to get a close shave.  I feel that the 5 razor head may be a bit of overkill because the size does make a precision difficult.  Fortunately the rear facing single blade allows for precision; however, maybe a smaller 2 or 3 blade could do the job without flipping it over (and may also keep replacement head costs down!).
B0016M50K6|5|when I first smelled this perfume in an ulta catalouge I thought the original one was bettter. However, after going to macy's and sampling the original princess and flower princess, I liked this one better. at first whiff it is very floraly and light, it never smells too overbearing or overpowering. As time went on the fruity scents started to come out and blend with the florals and over time it mellows into a soft garden scent. Overall it smelled like a garden and was very feminine. I feel this scent has a wider age range than regular princess (which I love too) and will appeal to anyone from someone in their teens to someone in their 80's. This is a scent for anyone who wants to feel like a princess.
B00JPGLV4E|1|Lots of shedding very disappointed, Ruined my experience. I'm not buying hair anymore
B00NC7NFFA|5|This serum is awesome! I used it for a few months, one pump at night before bed, and my skin was bouncy and hydrated. I don't know if it's just the hyaluronic acid or a combo of all the ingredients but I definitely noticed a difference when I stopped using it (ran out).
B001F51UEE|2|My son used Old Spice High Endurance and after a week his arm pits broke out with blisters and burns. We had to eventually take him to the doctor due to the extreme pain. To heal he had to use A&D ointment to heal. I can't rate it due to we were never able to see how it really worked. But other wise I think it may be a good product.
B001F51TBI|5|nice, and arrived fast, will buy again.
B008H0ASZC|1|Piece of shit! Don't waste your money
B0058H0GA4|4|This color is one of my favorites, a subtle one. I always like e.l.f. products and this one is no exception. Great price and fast shipping on Amazon. It was as expected.
B003UG5ZOC|5|Great perfume and wonderful scent for people who do not want a scent that is to strong. Thank you.  Eileen
B0013TJLQQ|4|Bought this for my husband who has all white hair. Works great but tends to make hair purple.
B006YQ4EBK|4|Both my husband and I use this. He uses it on his beard. We have very sensitive skin and this does well for us. It keeps our hair shiny and soft but not matted down with product. It smells great too and it is a better value than expensive salon brands.
B002C9KWI2|5|Great product. Enjoy using it. It really helps my curly hair and keep it untangled and from being frizzy. Great use.
B009LLDAK6|5|If you're like me you loved your Sonicare until you realized how much replacement brush heads cost. It's like what they do with razors, but on a higher scale. Not that Sonicare brushes are cheap, but you get the business model. These heads are the genuine product and best value I've seen anywhere. Most places give you 3 for this price.. here you get 4. And that's value my friend.
B00HQXVD96|5|This is my favorite shampoo ever! I have tried so many products over the years and nothing works better for me than this stuff. if you like to keep your blonde looking blonde (I have light brown hair with blonde highlights), plus like a sulphate-free shampoo that actually lathers a tad and leaves your hair feeling clean and healthy - this is for you! I have been using it almost 2 years now and have no plans to stop, ever!<br /><br />I use it with Alba Hawaiian volumizing conditioner and it's the perfect combo. I can't speak for the Scruples conditioner as I've never tried it. I think the shampoo alone gets the &#34;blonde job&#34; done :)
B000OYLBJG|3|I wanted to see how the smell was but I acutally prefer the original scent.  This is good but not as good as I though it would smell.
B00005V5OU|5|Best moisturizer for my sensitive skin. I love the light tint - it's enough that I can go without any makeup.
B000CSDDDG|5|This unique wash cloth has been everything I hoped it would be. It's gentle but powerful. I would recommend it for all!
B0057KA3PA|5|This was purchased as a gift.  It came quickly and was packed well.  It looked and smelled like the one seen in departments stores but much cheaper.  The recipient loved it, and has used it a lot since getting it!
B0019FLIEC|5|this is the nicest aroma out of all Camille Beckman products and I am so sorry they have discontinued the scent,. It is the only one I purchase.
B001QENJES|2|I have used this consistently day in and day out twice a day, and have not noticed a difference. I do exercise, and am working hard on my thigh areas. I feel this was a bit of a waste of money. I will continue to use it and see if I see a difference once the entire bottle is gone. *hoping for the best* This did not live up the the reviews I have read on here. :-(
B000GLRREU|5|I used to have one, it broke ...I didn't replace this for years n my mouth paid the price 800 dollars later for a deep scaling but now my check ups are great n I cant wait till my next teeth cleaning in nov<br />I have never had a cavity just bad gums. I am a happy customer now..water get up under my gums to release any food the tooth brush didn't get..highly recommend getting on of these.
B004KEJ27Y|5|I have used this for years and now can only find it on Amazon.  I have gone as long as a year with only one break!  I apply a coat each day for about three days.  Lasts until I need to trim/manicure.  It comes off with normal acetone remover (maybe non-acetone, I have never tried).  The shine lasts the entire time.  Chips do not show and another coat easily correct when you get to it.  Great protective coating since my hands are washed MANY times per day in my work.
B000LUX3VC|4|It's as big as my hand so it's not possible for me to open it with one hand. Other than that, I like it. It's as sturdy and useful as a pocket mirror with great magnification!
B00ILCOJN8|5|Nice jar, use to mix bath salts and oils currently
B000OV3ZDO|3|Not a bad product I like the soap have been using it for about 2 months but have not noticed any significant lightening of the skin but helps maintain clear and toned skin complexion
B00CBESNV6|5|This was recommended by my dermatologist for to my sensitive skin.  I have no skin reaction to wearing it.  It is thick and I have never got any ounce of sunburn while wearing it.  It is a bit 'greasy' feeling upon immediate application but the 'greasiness' lessens as it gets absorbed into the skin (or after rubbing it in better).  It is our go-to sunscreen that I highly recommend.
B005JY8EV4|5|Very tasty! The whole family liked. Refreshes and does not damage the teeth as chewing gum! A very good buy. Would recommend. Ordered another - other flavors to try.
B00J215KOO|4|Nice cover
B000CCZ7ZE|5|Great product!
B00141G48Q|5|Best cut ever
B003IU9HI0|5|amazing product. Use it as a facial moisturizer every night. Soaks into your skin immediately. Have reordered many times. Also works great on burns.
B003CR4PHM|5|I love this eyeliner.  The color is great and it stays on all day.  I used it on my girls for a dance competitio which lasted more than 10 hours and it stayed put all day.
B0015QH3VW|5|I have used this facial soap for years, and I love it.<br />It is mild, and it smells wonderful.<br />I bought several so I could give some as gifts.
B0002M5JO8|1|Just received the replacement brush heads for my Oral-B automatic toothbrush. I noticed that the replacement brushhead shafts are in deep blue color, rather than the light blue color that come with the original ones. Also the 3 brushheads came in with cheap wrapping materials. After I started to use the first toothbrush, it is very obvious to me that the brushhead is very hard, not as soft as the ones that I have been using at all. As it doesn't fit well to the toothbrush, the vibration of the brushhead also spilled the toothpast everywhere. I can't believe these are the original replacement brushheads. Wish I haven't thrown away the original one. Very disappointment on the purchase!
B001G8VOXM|5|It really works on very hard nails!
B008UUL29A|1|This is not the regular normalizing shampoo. It is the dry and itchy scalp normalizing shampoo used for after a perm. False advertising, there are two different kinds.
B00C3N1K7O|4|like it and will use again. Use in shower and really like the way my skin feels afterwards. will order more.
B005DKKBTC|5|I was very skeptical that a shaving experience could be worth the money for this razor, but making this purchase has shifted my perspective. This device provides a powerful, comfortable shave beyond what I've experienced before. I usually go for razors in the $70 to $90 range and have been happy with them. I'm more than happy with this item for the few months I've had it, I'm on the verge of ecstatic.
B004B0U57S|5|Good
B0070Z7KME|5|EXCELLENT SERVICE AND PRODUCT. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE IT IS EXCELLENT FOR RELIEVING JOINT AND MUSCLE ACHES AND PAINS. IT REALLY HELPS WITH RELIEF FOR ARTHRITIS PAIN. I HAVE USED THIS FOR SEVERAL MONTHS.THE ALOE VERA HELPS  THYE PRODUCT SMELL VERY NICE. IT DOES NOT BURN AND ITCH YOUR SKIN AS DOES THE GEL.  I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS PRODUCT.
B000YGKNWK|4|this is really good. it was a lot of help and I was able to fix things without messing anything up and really helped make my makeup look amazing! worth the buy! i wish i would have gotten the bigger one now!!
B001KOTQYG|3|Not a particularly effective deodorant. Not recommended for even office work -it wont last all day - only use if the hardest thing you are going to do all day is be a lady who lunches.
B001E6TZHI|3|I love, love, love Burts Bees, but I find that several of their facial cleansers, including the orange essence don't work for my skin.  I have pretty oily skin and, after washing with this cleanser, my skin feels even more oily than it did to begin with.  Perhaps this works well for people who have pretty dry skin, but not for skin like mine.  Good thing I got the trial size to begin with and will move on to some other Burts Bees items to try for my face.
B00M7XEYNW|4|Exactly what I was wanting! It is professional looking and fits all of my brushes well. It isn't a super high quality material, but for the price point it is a great buy!
B00B1LQTLG|5|AMAZZZZZZZZZING!!!!! DONT WASTE MONEY ON EXPENSIVE &#34;BRAND NAMES&#34; THIS IS JUST AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER!! SLOWLY BUT SURLY BUYING ALL COLORS!
B008FPVHOU|5|A lovely sweet scent. If you like baked goods then you'll love this.
B000GL5576|5|It was cool it got to my home early  new i love you it i will buy it again !!
B0018A32XS|5|I haven't personally used it, but the person for whom I bought it likes it, so...yay!
B000P20R8I|5|I was very unsure about buying this perfume because I usually just stick with the simple body mists from local stores.  But the size of the bottle is definitely worth the price.<br />Another worry of mine was that the smell would be too &#34;young&#34;  for me, but once I smelled it, I didn't care!  It smells sweet and the most noticeable scent is the vanilla cupcake.  It almost has a cotton candy like scent.  This is not overpowering though.  As long as you stick with the perfume rule (spray on wrist and dab at neck)  It will fit perfectly without insulting your loved ones noses.  I would definitely recommend this scent to any sweet people I know!
B006KXDWJC|5|Use to be very pale...I've been tanning 4 months..Tried this almost 2 months ago..FELL-IN-LOVE with it as A Must Have *BEFORE* putting my bronzing lotions.  I've used with and without in all the level beds at my tanning salon..This product works best put on 1st, then my main bronzing lotion..and I use several.  I alternate them.  When I used alone or ran out and tried a cheaper maximizer..Couldn't tell a difference, But..in between, used it as a single pack-COSTLY-that way..Could tell the difference again.  Everyone brags on how dark I am!!! It's A MUST HAVE for the serious tanner!!! Just bought it online..HUGE SAVINGS, along with my favorite bronzer and a new moisturizer/extender, I wanted to try.  Got all 3 cheaper than 1 bottle at my salon...EXCITED TO SAVE SO MUCH!!!
B00SYJE50A|5|This is a great little comb, perfect for my beard, smells great, works great, and has no static. Very Reasonable Price, Would highly recommend to any of my bearded brothers.
B000XEASRI|2|Bought this not for the man in my life, but to bring back a &#34;scent&#34; memory from many years ago. It didn't work, but it does have a pleasant scent.
B00HF3XU8E|4|Works exactly as described. Doesn't seem cheap and cuts nicely..
B00S599POK|5|No matter what look you want to achieve, from dramatic to natural, this set of brushes helps you create it!!  High quality and inspires the artist in you!!  Best part...cruelty free and made in the USA!
B003JA3KDW|3|I ordered the Pantene Pro-V Curly hair Series Moisture Renewal Conditioner and got Curl Perfection Moisturizing Conditioner instead.<br />This product seems to be working okay on our hair, but don't appreciate being sent something I didn't order, or it not being explained to me that this conditioner now replaces the Pro-V Curly  hair Series Moisture Renewal Conditioner and works the same way.
B000VP5IDI|1|The package came beat-up and the perfume smelled stale,as in old and used. Do not buy from this vendor ,unles you want raggedy products!!
B0009R16O8|5|This is great. Lasts forever. Smells clean. Will purchase again. :)
B00FAEOCP0|5|This is by far my favorite mascara.  I've tried many, many brands both high end and drug store brands and all have had marginal results.  I have average lashes.  Moderate thickness and on the short side.  This mascara looks great giving me length, volume and absolutely no smudging but washes off easily.
B001FWXM48|2|This was just ok,nothing special,not too many comments like what you wearing?i will not order it again unless it's on sale for a very low price
B00770PWOU|5|I bought this soap to use as a tool to impress upon my son the consequences of lying.He has told me its far and again the absolute worst thing he's ever put in his pie hole.Even after brushing his teeth he can still taste this soap.He has quit lying.Thank you Amazon for selling such a wonderful product.
B00DV6BX2E|4|great carrier oil, love that it has natural spf  in it.
B0058L24O6|5|I love these lashed I even used some of the thinner lashes to make my own bottom lashes. I like that I can reuse them and they really exaggerate my big eyes. I don't even have to clip the but that probably because I have huge eyes. Awesome!
B00CB83VSW|5|I had to google how to use these instruments but they definitely worked as expected. :)
B0002KHTG6|5|You can't beat your price.  Delivery pretty fast.  I will be ordering soon.  Always want the best price so I will be shopping.<br /><br />Yes I would recommend
B003T4B468|5|My sister had just bought this product a few days ago and so it came in today. I wanted to be the first to try it and see how good it worked. I was really amazed. It worked so awesome! I felt my skin breathe and what nots. Its an amazing product that DOES take away that dead skin and dirt left behind. All you do is take a little and \\"rub\\" in gentle circles on your face. Even after a shower or even washing your face, use this product and you'll see what was left behind and this will take it away. Also it doesn't leave your face dry and tight. Your face is actually really soft and feels really moisturized. I'd totally RECOMMEND this.[[ASIN:B003T4B468 SKIN79 Crystal Peeling Gel]]
B009NNFB0O|3|Good product overall, it does what is says is does in conditioning my beard. I will say now that I am onto my second batch that I am getting tired of the 'scent free' nature and the fact that it just smells like grease/oil. I like the product but I am thinking about buying small vials of essential oils to change up the scent perhaps even on a daily basis.
B0055T22HU|5|My girlfriend saw this color on Flickr at least a year ago and despite going to numerous stores, Ulta's, CVS's, etc could never find it. On a hunch, I decided to check on Amazon & whoomp there it was! Needless to say, when I surprised her with it, she was beyond happy so mission accomplished, thanks Amazon!
B004WRCXRA|5|I used this Siberian White colored hair spray for my son's 8th grade biography day Albert Einstein costume.  It worked perfectly!  I had none of the problems other reviewers reported.  But as a precaution we sprayed this on his hair outside with a big robe on so it wouldn't get on his clothes, and a towel held up around his neck and face just to keep it out of his eyes and off of his skin.  There was plenty of spray to do his whole head and more, and I wish I had sprayed more on to give him a whiter look.  I told him to be careful about accidentally wiping it off on things at school, but he didn't report that that was an issue.
B009RU47NA|5|Absolutely awesome!!! I received these in the mail within a week... Good designs and works well with an airbrush, with enough practice.
B00CBYJOVY|5|They work well and do not hurt my gums like some other products do.
B00B18BYK0|3|This conditioner does not work as well as some of the others that Herbal Essences has in there line of hair care products.  I will not reorder.
B007TC0HIC|5|Great product! Really love it,
B004Z7LBBQ|5|Excellent moisturizer. Hydrates face nicely. Makes the texture of my face feel like silk
B00GOM1YD0|4|I have had several electric toothbrushes and this one is the most full featured, although I seldom use some of the speeds.  I think Oral B brand is the best.  I really like the Bluetooth monitor.  It keeps you on track with pressure and time brushed.  Great idea for kids!  I love the sweep action as it does a thorough job of cleaning your teeth.  It is pretty large though and kind of difficult to hold on to, especially when its wet with toothpaste.  Not enough &#34;grip&#34; material on the handle, so sometimes hard to hold on to and control a large slick handle.  I, nevertheless, like the toothbrush, just wish it was a little easier to hold on to.
B008JHOUGQ|5|Does the job really well.
B0086GT35I|3|I should've listen to the other reviews and got a dovo straight razor. The scales on this thing if made from cheap flimsy plastic. Thought the blade is sharper than a tack, it's uneven and off center. I do recommend this product, if you can afford new and better scales, and fix the alignment of the blade.
B0014P8L9W|2|When I add water to mix, this brand quickly forms surprisingly-solid clumps that do not break up and mix into paste.  The only way I can mix it is if I add another powder in with it, like oat flour.  Then, once applied, my skin gets totally irritated from the mask!  I tried it a few times and gave up.  I'm sorry to say it was a waste of money for me.<br /><br />I've ordered Magick Botanicals Coso Green Clay again which I've used in the past.  It is EASY to mix!!  And it works, but doesn't sting and irritate the skin!<br /><br />I love green clay in general. It works great on taking toxins out of the skin. I can put it on a newly-forming pimple, and one or two applications will do away with the pimple entirely, like a miracle.  Great stuff.  But I'll be sticking to the Magick Botanicals brand!
B001MA0QY2|4|IT'S GREAT FOR ME...MY HAIR IS NATURALLY CURLY BUT MORE THIN THAN THICK . I LIVE IN FLORIDA SO HUMIDITY IS MY ENEMY!!!! MY HAIR DID STAY STRAIGHT ALL DAY WITH RAIN AND 95 TEMP WITH HIGH HUMIDITY.
B001AO0WCG|1|I received this item and the seal was broken and taped shut with scotch tape. Obviously, scotch tape and oil don't work together as the oil breaks down the weak tape. Horrible to spend $30 plus dollars to find out that this is unusable and non returnable to Amazon. So dissapointed.
B00ESYFTVO|5|It came 6days before the expected date. It was packaged well. It came with the case which was sealed and brand new. The mascara did lengthen and i am very happy with my purchase.
B000VEN3RW|3|I bought the neutralizer to use after my peels (of course), but I was pleasantly surprised by the extra items that were in my package! I received the 35% Glycolic-Lactic Acid Peel and the Collagen Facial Cleansing Gel.<br /><br />I only gave this 3 stars because I haven't actually tried the product yet. I will edit this once I test this out.
B0009OAI3G|5|I LOVE this fresh, clean scent! It has been a fav since the 60's for daytime, but hard to find in local drug stores and dept. stores. It has the most wonderful outdoors, fresh, floral, but not heavy scents that you can wear it to the beach, with jeans, to work or anything casual. Just divine!!!!
B004VDGDJ4|4|I had a free sample of this perfume. My 7 year old girl just loved it so I bought it for her this Christmas. Was shipped very quickly.
B00QT14EB0|3|I honestly thought it would be a lot better. It kind of works.. but it's actually really messy. Luckily the glue doesn't stick to anything you wouldn't want it on but doing my nails all my fingers kept getting stuck together which was very annoying. I rather clean them up afterwards then apply this. It's an annoying extra step. Not buying again.
B002XITZLW|5|The words are simple....intoxicating. I am pleased that Amazon Prime had this for me..nothing turns your scenes to a higher level than Tom Fords &#34;Black Orchid&#34; The scent lingers..like it should all..& even more. If you love the deeply intoxicating scent of black orchids~you will not be disappointed..my fav perfume always
B00S20FOAG|5|Daughter loved it, perfect case
B007BN2LS8|4|Reduces noise from the corrugated tubing rubbing across wooden furniture. Protects the furniture. Could be a little softer and more comfortable..
B00103H69E|5|Love these! They work wonderful for my art and painting needs! Can be used multiple times afte being washed out!
B00H2L4KNI|2|The razors felt as though the were refurbished and very DULL.  I thought maybe it was just the first one, After trying the third cartridge, I realizes it would be this way with all of them.  DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM!
B0001Z5OZU|5|Great for helping to relieve stuffy noses.  I always use this when I have a sinus infection.  Order arrived quickly.
B005QPBBO8|1|Normally, I love this perfume.  I've been wearing it for a few years and have had more compliments than I can say.  This latest bottle that I ordered  from you is terrible.  When I spray it on the smell simply isn't the same and when it hits my skin it might as well be water.  No scent at all.  I'm sure it's old and hasn't been stored correctly.  I'm very disappointed.  I have no idea where it's being sent from and you should probably not take any more orders for it.  It may be that I got the one bad bottle; I've ordered another in hopes that's the case.  If not I feel cheated, as there apparently isn't anyway to send it back or get a refund.  This scent is truly wonderful and I miss having it.  I'm so sorry Guerlain isn't making it anymore.  It was an absolute winner.  I would have given 10 stars.
B0040QJH18|5|I have been using this product for years and I love it. I don't understand the bad reviews. It works both ways: with a blow dryer or without a blow dryer, it leaves your hair shiny and in place.
B001P60R0Q|5|This product was recommended in a magazine as a gel moisturizer with sunscreen suitable for acne prone skin. I am in my late 30's but still have a little acne. I looked at the previous Amazon reviews and almost didn't purchase this because people had problems getting it out of the bottle. Would I have missed out. The first time I used the product I hit the bottle on a hard surface for about 10 seconds and then pumped as directed. Both products (green and white) came out perfectly. This is the lightest product I have ever found with a sunscreen (and it seems like I have tried everything). My face is clearing up and getting softer. I also love the refreshing scent. Go Biore.
B002RD1Y8U|5|From korea<br />Very soft<br />U must try if u r sensitive
B007ROD3AG|4|Great dryer!!! The directions were not made for people who have no idea what they are doing, so it tooke about a month or so to actually put it together!!  But I got it and I love it. I would just say, put in better instructions to follow.
B000W405SG|5|The design of the single stick is a little difficult to get used to using, but after a few tries it can do a great job.  Some hairs can grow deep, so its slim design comes in handy.  Have been using for a few months and i am very pleased.
B00152SA1S|5|Same product as the local store for a better price. Makes your blow up doll smell real. Get it. Get it now!
B005OS52HE|3|it was ok
B0065JCV84|4|Pros: This stuff holds really well, i have medium length hair ( my bangs touch my eyebrows) i style my hair to the side(comb over) and after applying this product everything holds in place very well. It has a a medium firmness once it dries up but not hard or crunchy like most gels, no white residue either. its pretty flexiable, i can actually pick up a couple strands of my hair and it will fall back into place when i let go. it last all day too. for the price, its unbeatable. most pomades come in 2oz jars but this is a 4oz jar for only about $12 and it will last a while too since you will only need about a nickle size dab of this stuff to comb your hair with.<br /><br />Cons: im not a fan of the smell, its not a bad smell. i would say its a cross between old spice and axe body spray. good thing is its a mellow smell that goes away after about 2hrs. also the product is really stiff you have to rubs it into your palms to smooth it out before you apply it to the hair. i notice after i rub it to my palms i like to add a little water to make it smoothier so it goes into my hair easier or else its a really hard tug.<br /><br />i'm adding a pic of my hair after 7hrs of having this stuff in my hair and it still looks really fresh :)
B00937VHNA|5|So glad I found this ! Cheapest I've found for this amount . It is the same quality I've paid $16 for one lb from Village Shea that I loved , but needed a larger amount since I use so much.  Very buttery . Great body and face lotion will make your skin look 10 years younger
B000VG7GDW|3|Not as effective as described
B003H897AQ|5|Worked amazing for me! I had gotten semi permanent lashes for my wedding and when they finally came off weeks later I almost cried. I had NO lashes. Well ordered this and within a week I had lashes again!
B005QHYE2M|3|Been using this soap for a while now.<br />Can't really see difference to other quality soaps produced in USA.<br />Too expensive for regular use.
B00ISDFPD8|5|I have been using Minnesota Wood for over two years. Its fragrance is amazing, and I've even noticed that my skin is smoother as a result! As long as this soap keeps being made, I will keep using it!
B0012N2QWE|5|Love this shampoo & conditioner. It is the only kind that works well on my hair. I have thick, wavy, frizzy hair and this seems to tame it the best. I think it's because of the almond oil. I enjoy the scent and the bigger bottles last me about 4 months.
B00336EUTK|5|I am a smoker and coffee drinker. This works for great for removing the stains in between dental cleanings. Just follow the directions and you will see the difference in a couple of days.
B00M6D9AAK|5|I absolutely love this cream . I have cellulite on the back of my thighs and my butt . I never show off my legs until now . Since using this cream the appearance of my cellulite looks alot better than before . There a huge difference . I now show off my legs . I will forever be a customer :)
B0089G00Q6|4|I bought this in conjunction  with the Control Corrective Salicylic Wash 2% - 18 oz on a spas recommendation to fight blackheads.  It wasn't the miracle I was hoping for, but it a nice exfoliator you can use every day.  Not drying, but you must rinse well!
B000WOU3I8|5|I live in an extremely dry climate. In the winter (in the past) my skin was so dry I was globing on Vaseline every night, and even that didn't help. Prescription creams, night masks . . . nothing could keep the dryness away.<br /><br />I started using these after my second son was born, mostly out of laziness. Then I noticed that my skin was no longer dry. Seriously, it's like a skin miracle. I use one every night and only wash my face with water in the shower. A few weeks ago I ran out, and went about a week without them. Just in that week my skin got rashy and dry again. I bought some more, and within a few days my skin was restored.<br /><br />I LOVE these!
B00I134Y82|5|I love using this on my face every night.  I can already see some of my fine lines on my face disappearing.  Great product!
B0012MZ4WE|5|I raise goats, lots of them.  Routine work around the farm includes lots of hot, sweaaty, dusty labor that leaves us smelling like....goats.  I gave up using any kind of anti-perspirant/deodorant in the mornings as a useless exercise.  I'm also no fan of cream-based deodorants/anti-perspirants because of the wet, sticky feeling that lasts until the product dries. Furthermore, I have sensitive skin and occasionaly get rashes from the chemicals in anti-perspirants.  When I was given the opportunity to test this product, I figured I could \\"break\\" it in short order.<br /><br />Boy, was I pleasantly surprised!  When I applied the product, the recommended \\"two clicks\\" worth was a much smaller amount than usual, and it dried very quickly.  The next morning, with temperatures in the high, humid 80's, we headed outside to work all day in the barn.  At the end of the day, my underarms were still dry, and my skin was smooth.  I reapplied the anti-perspirant that evening.  The next day, we ran 30 goats through a chute and then into a stanchion so that we could trim 120 sets of little hooves.  Goats don't appreciate this, so this involves more herding, lifting, and occasional wrestling matches.  Still, by the end of six more hours of work, my underarms were still dry.<br /><br />Of particular note, I have found in the past that anti-perspirants and deodorants may keep you dry, but the chemical smell associated with them by the end of the day is unpleasant.  I did not experience this with Dove Clinical Protection.  So, even though this is not a deodorant, I found it to be more effective for odor.<br /><br />Bottom line:  non-sticky/greasy on application; works under even extreme conditions; outperforms a deodorant for odor control, and will not irritate sensitive skin.  I'm making the switch to Dove.
B00016XJ4M|5|I always use regular witch hazel for a skin toner.  This is especially nice because it has the added rose petal water, which gives it a lighter more pleasant scent as well as keeping the skin soft.  I use it every day, morning and night, its a GREAT toner!
B0009VO8N0|5|I've been searching for this product for years.  Love the scent and really like how well it cleans and rinses (with very little product required).
B000ZFI2PA|5|Shipping is fast! Great product.
B003C7W7WC|5|Very simple to figure out, if the wife loves it, I love it! Smells wonderful on her. Will buy again.
B00IP42FBA|5|Amazing! Leaves skin feeling amazing - I put in on my entire body after a shower.
B004N82RZQ|5|Came fast, looks just like the picture, and clean too! Pieced my own lip and worked great! Just hurt a lot. :0
B003PMINT0|5|I've been using this product for two years, and I love it. It's true that it's probably not a very moisturizing product, but it works really well for me since I have combination skin, with particularly oily spots on my forehead and chin, and it has sort of a mattifying effect. Applied with a brush, it can hide pimples and other subtle imperfections.     My mother loves it also, but she also has oily-prone skin. If you don't have oily skin, I recommend trying another product, like the tinted makeup from Mojo Spa - also a natural, chemical-free brand. (And cheaper too).
B005FO1S0W|4|I've been using this and it really firmed and tighten (made my booty bigger by an inch) I HIGHLY recommend this
B001A3HPT0|5|Hard to find this anywhere in a store. The brush is great and cleans easily, the soap is a pretty neutral smell. Worth the money.
B0011E1BMA|5|This cream was prescribed by the wound clinic.  The problem was dry skin as well as open blisters caused by poor circulation. There was noticeable improvement after the very first application.  The cream melts on applying, and a little goes a long way.  It is fragrance free and does not appear to stain fabric. I would recommend this product to anyone.
B000Q6T6B2|2|This clipper kit worked great the first six month's we owned it, then it just died! I'm sending it in for repair under warranty (Has a 2 year warranty) , I don't know why I'm doing this since it will cost about $6.00 for postage. Hope I get it back before my next hair cut is needed.
B0067F8BBM|5|Excellent sellers. I recommend 100%<br /><br />Neyeska.
B00Q301WXK|5|A company that gives a great product at a great price.<br />I use more expensive lines that don't exceed this product's effectiveness.
B005TI7L7I|5|This is my favorite face lotion. Doesn't clog up pores for acne prone skin, and moisturizes without leaving your face all greasy, but is still heavy enough where it actually moisturizes your face! I switched from neutrogena to this,and haven't looked back! I have been using Simple for about a year and a half, and will only buy this!
B004BD0XWC|5|i've tried dozens of different eyeliners and this one is by far the best. It lasts an insanely long time and I only have to sharpen it after using it about 10 times. It's never broken either. Great value!!
B000C1UF1G|5|It  was a gift but not this one but another by Armani
B006VXXSJ0|4|Dentisse's Natural Reflection toothpaste has a long lasting freshness; provides a pleasant cooling effect that lasts long after you have brushed your teeth.  Nice combination of freshness and cooling.
B00B8ZJBTW|5|I got this as a gag gift for a friend. He loved it. I don't know how it does in the shower since it was a gift, but it looks and smells great.
B0010NYC3M|1|It also turned my hair green. At first it was great. got my hair really dark. but the more i used it the greener my hair got over time. its not super obvious like you can really only see it in the sunlight, but its turquoise.
B00158J0EI|4|This product dried almost as hard as a rock. I thought it would be softer like the dentist would use. It still worked but was difficult to clean edges. Had to use a glass file. Still recommend it though. I might have gotten a bad batch.
B00SWEHZNG|5|Amazing product, I absolutely love it, my skin feels fantastic !!! certainly will recommend, and I will buy more for my loved ones
B008CC3ZIW|5|Great deodorant with a great smell.  My boyfriend loves it and I love the smell on him.
B0095IMNI0|4|works well. feels like a regular dental cleaning. good pressure with the waterpik as well.
B002XITZ08|5|The 6.7oz one was exactly to my expectation. The mini sized one which I was misinformed about over the telephone by a customer service rep. who was extremely nice was not. However, when I received it & called about the misinformation, the customer service rep. was very rude & unfriendly, which surprised me. We then had some contact by email & I found her very condescending. I did return it and was credited the money in ample time.
B000JL5QS6|4|My wife loves this perfume and can no longer find it in any store.... I believe this might be the last purchase for her, since this was the only place I could locate... What a shame......
B0012BNVE8|5|Makes a difference and will keep using as directions ! Takes some time but after over that time it makes a difference !
B005C3QELY|5|Several friends have commented about the Purell holder. They asked where I got it and thought it was cool and fun.
B008HSDZ8Q|4|I love the smell of this deodorant and it works pretty well.  If I work up a sweat from exercising, I do need to reapply it, but otherwise I think it is a great product.
B001QY8QXM|5|Best bang for the buck in terms of sharpness and price
B00DTTYF6E|1|It made me break out. My skin is really sensitive, so if yours is sensitive too, I would not buy this product.
B00CIH9JPA|5|Looks great on my fiance....
B0023XF60Q|5|I have had issues with ingrown/split/impacted hairs from shaving for as long as I can remember.  I started using this and the one impacted hair I've had since then was on the sideburn part of my face, which is easy to pluck with tweezers, and none on the part of the face where the cheek/jawbone go from vertical to horizontal towards the neck which was always the big problem area.  It's smells cinnamon, strongly, but I'm willing to cope with that until they come out with a blend of oils that smells better.
B00AB4ZTEW|5|Nice colors but the mirror wasn't glue well, it was off of its  place
B00397XUIK|5|Appears to be pure, slightly greasy feel that goes away within a minute and absorbs very quickly. I love the little dropper that comes with it, makes it easier to apply it. It also as a slight nutty smell to it but that goes away as it absorbs. Overall, seems to be high quality product. I used it as a face moisturizer and it lasted me about a year. It didn't cause my very sensitive skin to break out so a good product in my book.
B00ASZ25R8|1|I wasted my time and money on this product.  I it did was provide a cooling sensation and smell like vapor rub.
B000R94Q1I|5|Terrific product - goes on smoothly and evenly - I get lots of compliments on how great I look when I use this to camouflage fine wrinkles and creases.
B00ICO4F3Y|5|Too soon to make an honest comment as I've only had for a few days.  Hoping that this works.
B00OZ9WMHG|3|I found this cheaper at greens.howtonow.org - half the price on a 90 day program why I gave this 3 stars.<br />I have been wanting to try the greens drink product for a long time but was put off by having to be locked in initially to buying it for 3 months or overpay for it here.<br />Basically, how it works is you sign up and get a great price but you have to sign up for an auto ship of product for 3 months, after the 3 months you can stop the auto ship and still be a customer and order when ever you want for the discount price. My biggest problem was that I did not know if I would like it so I did not want to buy 3 months of something I hate!<br />I finally decided that I must try it out since you do not have to order the same product for the 3 months so if I hated it, I could try out something else. Well, turns out that I love this product!! It gives me energy and I was able to cut down on my caffeine intake. It is not the best tasting but I just mix in a little juice and no problem!<br />I ordered the chews also one month and they are not that bad - I mean it is not candy - so when you put it in that perspective it is OK I do not think it tastes bad at all. I enjoy the drink better.<br />I take it the greens everyday and when I skip it I can tell, I just do not feel as good. Plus I work around sick people all day and since I have been using these I have not been sick once - a miracle!<br />I signed up and did the 3 months and now I get this shipped to me every month for free plus you earn points and are able to get free product - I love it!!<br />The Greens can help detoxify your cells, which makes them a great supplement to take in combination with a weight-loss program. Not only that, but the plants found in Greens have an alkalizing effect on your body. Basically, having an alkaline body means that your internal pH, or acidity level, is balanced. Disease, mold, fungus and other microorganisms that negatively affect your health can't survive in an alkaline environment, which is another encouraging reason to add more plants to your diet.

B0058UYK1M|5|This product rocks, not only does it keep your lips looking good but also the rest of your body by curving your appetite. This could most likely be the weight loss product of the year.
B000RZPVV6|5|Best thing i ever used on my skin that was so cheap<br /><br />I have heard that some people might be allergic  from someone on youtube . So keep that in mind. I would test it out on my palm first<br />to see what happens after 24 hours .
B0013L7652|3|I was not that impressed with this product! I wanted something that would really soothe my hot achey legs after a long day of being in heels, and this product does not do that! I did however find a Shaklee cream that is for the joints that works amazing on both hot tried legs and feet, and that I love!
B0085DYWTO|5|Fun little temporary Tattoo's. Had a bunch of people asking if it was real at the festival we were at. Will buy again.
B00F8I65KI|1|didnt work well. unfortunately outside of the return period.
B00X53DHIG|5|amazing amazing amazing! cant recommend it enough.
B006FKLRIS|1|This product does not smell like the same lotion from the tanning salon. It gave me a itchy bumpy rash all over my arms and legs. So I won't be using it anymore. Bummer.
B003CSGLT6|5|In fact cleaning device Shaver is excellent and I am very glad to buy this wonderful device is kept on a new razor if an
B003X9YAL0|5|this power has become a staple in my hair strengthening spritz!  i'll definitely be ordering again!

B0016ISD04|5|I use this brush everyday. It really gets all the dead skin off your body.
B001H989VU|5|This is the makeup I always buy, and I was out of stock! It took me literally 2 minutes to get this on here and buy it!
B00013YZ7U|1|I was looking for soap that would work for our gray water system and everyone recommended Dr. Bronners.  All the reviews said that this is the most amazing soap ever.  This stuff is terrible!  Tried using in foam (mixed with water) dispenser for hand washing and also used it to wash dishes.  It leaves this weird film on everything.  Felt like hands were sticky after washing.  Dishes didn't feel like they rinsed clean.  Left a horrible film on my stainless sink.  I don't know how people use this as their miracle cleaning product. Definitely a big mistake.  Prefer the Better Life products .
B000WJ4DYS|3|good. but after using this product, my hairs look not took a wash hairs.
B00CWDBMSM|5|I love this serum it goes on light and is making a big difference in my skin.
B00N65GYQA|5|i have rather sensitive skin, and these products are very soothing and the weekly treatment especially leaves my hair super soft!
B001GIOW3G|4|This facial moisturizer is thick, uncolored, and unscented. It avoids the problems that cause a lot of sensitivities.<br /><br />The moisturizer is thick and tends to stay on the surface of the skin rather than being absorbed quickly; while it doesn't seem to absorb as quickly as other products I've tried, I'm not entirely certain that's a bad thing. If you're planning on using a moisturizer under makeup, I'm not certain this would be your first bet, but this is designed for outdoor use (SPF 50), and most ladies who spend lots of time outdoors have forsaken makeup while out there, as the need to apply sunscreen and bug spray would waste your efforts anyway, as would water from your swimming or just plain old perspiration. So I don't think it's an issue that it's too thick to to be worn under makeup.<br /><br />Besides, I'm a bit uncomfortable with chemicals being absorbed into my skin.<br /><br />One thing I did notice is that while it does give me a longer window before sensitive skin breaks out, I do need to get this off my face as soon as I don't want the sun protection anymore. Left on for extended periods, it did cause my face to break out, just like everything else does. So if I'm going to be outside for an extended period of time, I may just gauge how at risk I really am for sunburn, and take alternative precautions as well, such as a ball cap, spend some of that time outside in shady areas or under a shelter, etc. and limit how long I keep this on my face. I won't be using this overnight, but who needs SPF at night?<br /><br />The price is a bit up there, but so is the SPF, and it's meant just for the face, not your whole body. It will last you a while unless you wear it constantly, and you won't burn when you have this on.
B0006B4W5W|3|This oil is nothing special, it is a great moisturizing oil, but you can get great or even amazing oils at a cheaper price. The smell is okay, it reminded me of some kind of household cleaner, not quite lysol-ish, because there isn't any pine, but something. In my opinion it really doesn't smell like pineapple there might be a faint scent detected, but not enough.
B003K5EYNG|2|I am not sure if it is fake or not. But it seems it was opened before. Also, the expiration day is April, 2013. I got it on Oct., 2012. Think twice before you buy it.
B006HKR50A|2|aArrived all chunky and would not go on smooth. Useless to me. Thought about throwing it away. Will try to get my money back :(
B0001ZYL3Q|5|Works well for dry, itchy skin, that's why i gave it 5 stars. haha  Smells pretty good to boot ya hippie.
B00O57HHE6|1|Didn't give me the amount they advertise.
B00B18C3NW|5|For over a decade, they pulled this stuff off the shelves.<br />When it came back, I thought I'd cry.<br />I'd bathe in it.<br />The way it makes your hair smell?  Amazing.
B003EAIWKI|5|is excelent... good quality, nice desing, and perfect present, thanks so much
B00BEKFCG2|5|I used the aluminum oxide crystals and then put the ultra healing cream on  and it was an instant miracle to my skin. I've tried all kinds of products for my skin before and never had results like this ever and only for the first use. My pores were very tiny and my skin was smooth and soft. I will be purchasing these products again along with the glycolic acid cream for at night.
B005A4P236|3|You have to add several coats in order to achieve the look on the photo
B000C1VW5Y|5|I bought this for my grandmother as a Christmas gift. She sprayed it as soon as she opened it and I loved the smell. It stayed in the room for a while which shows the products worth. Great for its price.
B0008GGH58|4|Great
B00R8GX5YM|5|smells great
B003LNCFPG|4|great except one of the pumps broke during shipping and leaked some shampoo (not much) thankfully I have another pump laying around that I can use.
B0042BZHLK|1|Too much alcohol and sulfates!
B0012F88AQ|5|I like this product.  It actually work really well on the digestive system.  You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />San Diego, Ca
B001KYQF3Q|5|Love it, highly recommend. Can't believe how soft it make my skin feel.
B0081NLUAC|5|This is very soothing and moisturizes your eyes all night.  It's nice to feel this even in the morning! I hate to wash it off.
B001QD3QJM|5|Product was just as advertised. Speedy service!
B000REFH8E|1|The one I received was not the one as pictured. It was rather the one with green leaf extract. I specifically chose the one pictured over the green leaf one after reading the reviews for both.<br /><br />I've been using the one I received, hoping that I would get some result as reviewed. No result after 2 weeks. Again, I am not speaking for the product as pictured, but rather a different version of it.
B002GJPI0U|4|it arrived so quickly, i was really excited. the only thing that annoyed me was it had leaked a bit by the time it arrived, but nothing major.<br />okay, so i tested it out for the first time last night... the stinging did not bother me at all, it merely felt similar to rubbing alcohol. so far no negative skin reactions, which is positive. the roll on makes for a simple application which i like though i have no idea how that compares to the other version. i have not really noticed any changes so far but i know since it's a light peel it'll take a few applications. i'll update further after some time has passed!<br />++++++++++++++++++++++++<br />(LATER)<br /><br />Okay, so it's been about 3 weeks & I've just done my 3rd application. I think this product is terrific! My skin is incredibly soft & smooth. I've definitely notice it has cleaned out my pores, made my skin tighter but still \\"plush\\", I've barely had one break out even during my cycle! Oh & my skin tone is perfect.<br /><br />It didn't really make my skin visibly \\"peel\\" which I'm happy about, but I think that's probably partly because I use the Aveeno Face Pads to wash my face (only the soft side & very gently) so it probably clears away any lurking dead skin cells on the surface. I also apply Aveeno Positively Radiant moisturizer sp15 (my regular daily moisturizer) afterward which seems to have gone over well with my skin :)<br /><br />Oh, it's worth noting that I've had to be extremely careful about sunlight. The first time I applied it to my entire face (instead of a small part as a test) I got a lot of sun on the left side of my face from my sunny window. Later, I noticed a huge red patch on my left cheek which looked like & hurt like a sunburn. I put lots of the moisturizer on it & it faded in about a day or two. No other issues but I've just been particularly cautious with the sun while I'm using this stuff.<br /><br />This stuff has been so fantastic. It does not really burn, in my opinion, and works gently and quickly.<br /><br />Also! If you're considering doing a skin peel, maybe think about what you're eating during the healing process. I've been eating lots of avacados, walnuts, salmon, tomato sauce, green & white teas w/honey, sweet potatoes/yams, & pomagrantes since they all have excellent skin benefits. I mean, if you're going to go as far as a skin peel (even a gentle one) why not go all the way & ensure your new skin is the best it can be? :)<br /><br />Hope this helped anyone who was curious!<br /><br />++++++++<br />MONTH LATER<br /><br />So the amazing effects aren't very lasting though I do still think it was worth it & has helped over all.idering doing a skin peel, maybe think about what you're eating during the healing process.

B00DD6DCK8|5|Saw a recommendation on Pinterest and thought it might cure my pasty winter leg pallor. (I'm a blue-eyed blonde.) I was appalled at the first squirt out of the bottle--darkest brown. But since it was a weekend and I could cover it up with long pants. Actually, it worked great. No orangy color, not too dark, no unpleasant smell, color right away...I'm sold!
B00005V5OW|1|I ordered a different mascara at checkout. And somehow received this when I was suppose to get maybeline full and soft. Not one to cause a stink over a few bucks, and call and complain. This is the worst mascara I've ever used can't wait for it to be empty.
B001FWXMGG|5|Wife love the perfume ran out had to get more
B002XQ1SS2|5|The best fragrance and the best service . Will Definetaly do buissness with them in the future. The price was also the best compare to others online and in stores
B000QCOF1M|5|This is one of the few products I've considered to be worthy of reviewing -- it is really great.  A bit expensive, but with spraying my shoes and sandals after every 3-4 wearings it keeps my footwear much less funky.  The orange scent isn't the most masculine, but after drying overnight (as recommended in the instructions) there is just a hint of a fresh scent in the morning. I get about 3 months out of each can.
B0044FGAUG|5|if you are concerned about the effect chemicals may have on among other things your hormone balance then this moisturiser is perfect for you, free of all the chemicals usually found in these products<br />also applies easily, smells neutral and does not leave your skin feeling greasy
B00OP23U24|3|Nice product but smell could be better
B0000532N9|4|My own experience with Nizoral is that the first time you use it (after not using it for a while or not using it ever before), you WILL get an increase in flakes. It's almost as if it's loosening up and ridding your scalp of everything that was already there. After that, with continued use, it's amazing. I find that only after using it two or three times, I can stop... sometimes for weeks, sometimes for months, without reacurring dandruff! So don't be scared after the first shampoo and all these huge flakes show up. I do wish it smelled a little nicer, but it's a small price to pay for results!
B00B0M608I|4|Leaves beard a little too greasy, but overall works well
B00N2JEYH6|5|This set is beautiful! The blush lasts all day, like all Clinique blushes do for me. The bountiful beige eye stick is the sample size, about half the size of the regular sticks. The nail polish is a Great color for summer tootsies :) ! I enjoy the smaller sizes in these sample gift with purchase bags so I can try the products out to see if they need to be a repurchase for permanent collection.
B00GW1HKHW|4|I get the heeby-jeebies seeing instructions about using numbing cream to deal with pain.  I would never do a home cosmetic procedure that caused any real amount of pain.<br /><br />I use rollers like this, 0.5 size, on rough spots, age spots and such.  I normally apply a anti-biotic cream afterwards to avoid any irritation.  I have never had any pain beyond a very slight prickling.<br /><br />I was offered a free sample of this model and find it does have some advantages.  The head of the roller rotates at the neck, also the needle are on wheels that rotate separately, not on a single solid roller. I think this does allow it to follow skin contours better--although it makes me extra carefully about sanitizing between uses as it makes lots of little areas that dirt or bacteria could get caught in.<br /><br />This review is based on a product sample from the vendor.
B00HYMPIIG|5|I received it as a gift and could not wait to find it. When I did find it I purchased 5 so I could give them away as a gift and will  probably purchase some more before Christmas.  Absolutely wonderful!!!!  It feels good and smells good as well.
B00AUFRXHS|1|This is the first review I have ever written, but I am so pissed off and I do not want this to happen to anyone else. I read some of the other reviews with this same complaint, but I definitely did not think it would happen to me. When I received this the top part of the palette was just missing, the brush was not in the case, and the top was completely broken off. It's like someone used the parts they wanted and then shipped it to me. With that being said they are really beautiful colors with nice pigmentation. I would recommend buying this in the store if you want to purchase, PLEASE save your time and money and do not buy from this seller.
B005CGREGA|2|Here's my issue... this has ZERO staying power as a scent. I purchased some smaller versions that seemed to be better, but this large size is basically scented water. BOOOOOOOO.
B00LPP2DE0|5|Love the long post. It long enough for my tragus 😍
B000C1VSLM|5|This is one of my daughter's favorite scents. We haven't seen it in stores for quite sometime. Assumed it was no longer being made. What a happy surprise when I found it on Amazon. Surprised her with it for Mother's Day. So glad to know we can still get it!
B005TT8T4G|5|I have never stuck my nose into dew drenched flowers but it's an apt description of this particular floral. It's lightly sweet, I can't really smell the vanilla it's more of a suggestion but the combination is lovely. Silage is roughly 3-5 hours, although detectable for much longer on the skin. I love most of this brands scents.
B003FVDNO6|4|I bought this today.  It works!  The only thing is that I have baby fine hair that isn't super long or thick, it's about to the bottom of my shoulder blades or where my bra goes across my back.  So I wish I had gotten the minis, because these stick out a bit at the top and bottom of my bun.  They aren't completely useless to me, cuz I'm growing my hair out and I'm sure once my hair gets about 6 inches longer they'll be perfect, but for now I think I'm going to try to get a pack of the mini's.<br />But overall great product!  Soo much easier than sticking 100 bobby pins in and hairspray and all this and then trying not to move my head too much.
B0049LUI9O|4|Works very well, a little in the large side
B006W2SYF8|4|as expected
B002AQF4F8|5|I was skeptical buying this at first but I wanted to try it. I was estatic when I got it because its cute and amazing. Its super glossy and shiny, and when you take a drink it will not come off like usual lip gloss
B00KZDWL7W|4|Only have been using it for about two weeks.  Toe nail seems to be clearing up.  First time I used my toe got sore and turned red.  Tried again after a week toe was slightly red but no pain, after the second day no problems at all.
B006GQYSGE|5|I purchased this razor to replace a Norelco I have had for a very long time (12 years). That old one still works, but the blades needed to be replaced and the razor costs almost as much as the blades, (I have since found out on youtube how to sharpen them again on an old mirror).<br />This razor is really quiet compared to the old one. I'm not afraid of waking the whole house in the morning when using this one. Being new, it cuts effortlessly. I don't have thick heavy stubble, so I'm no sure how well it would work on a thick beard, but for an average shadow it works great. It charges in about an hour, which is a lot less than the old one, and lasts for a few weeks of shaving once a day. There is a battery light that tells you when it is getting low. The trimmer works as expected and is a nice feature to have. The price was average. I would recommend it.
B0075OYO10|5|My favorite mascara ever.....I like that it has a 'normal' size wand.....anytime I've tried using those jumbo brush wands, I end up losing an eye.
B000GCTFRQ|5|i have been waxing over 30 years and have been very pleased with zip wax- i stocked up when i found it harder to find. using a thin layer of baby powder on  area to be waxed helps wax not stick to skin. using a thicker layer and a bit thicker where you start pulling up should eliminate the crackly bits. also hair has to be long enough for wax to grab so if too short might not come up- i use an old can to heat mine.
B00FML2LXG|3|Very fine powder, good quality, but a little too pink for me to use.
B0043OYFKU|4|Execellent tool to clean any face.  The brush is soft but effective and the two speeds come in handy for control in sensitive are near the eyes.  Product arrived as specified.
B003V90O8A|4|I like it
B00KL77JAQ|5|I love this thing, looks great and covers my cleavage. Easy to put on
B002QFGQAK|5|These concealers blend flawlessly and give full coverage. I use to use Benefit Bongge concealer, but these are better and cheaper! The only downside is this isn't good for travel, but I saw on the Coastal Scents website there are cream concealer quads so hopefully those are the same quality.
B0077S32GW|5|perfect
B002O0D8P8|5|This stuff really works. I have baby fine hair and it makes me look like I actually have hair. It also has slowed down my hair loss.
B0021AG0Z6|5|I hate shaving...I would rather mow the yard than shave my face.  I used the Norelco 985RX for years...it was slow and required many strokes over the same area...then I bought the Brawn 7526 with the automatic cleaner.  Same drill, slow and requiring many trips over the same area...particularly my neck; it requiring up and down and side-way strokes to eventually rid my neck of hair.    So bad was my experience with electric shavers since I started shaving (I am now 64 years old) that I rarely shave on the weekends. On Monday morning I Gillette safety razor it in the shower to rid my weekend hair....because the electric shavers can't handle two days growth.    Enter the Panasonic ES8249 into my world.  This week I have been amazed....unlike the Brawn that near required ear plugs so your ears wouldn't be subjected to noise approaching that of a jet engine while trying to shave the side of your face, the buzz is low and very tolerable.  The shave is closer than the Brawn or the Norelco and it requires only a second touch-up stroke to make it happen.    By no means does the Panasonic make me want to shave, but the morning 'little tiny hair' removal drill is now quick and relatively noiseless.    The side burn trimmer is on par with the Norelco and the Brawn.......which is very good.    The self cleaning feature of the Panasonic is on line with the Brawn....which is excellent.  Although the Panasonic doesn't sound like you have entered a jet engine test cell when it's doing the cleaning....it's relatively quite.      The Brawn is easier to recharge the cleaning feature...one cartridge slides into its little place under the shaving unit takes care of the reload.  The Panasonic requires a little container on the back replenished with tap water and a tiny cleaning fluid cartridge placed under the unit.   Two steps instead of one.....basically irrelevant.    I paid $149 through Amazon.....well worth it for the many years I anticipate it will provide quiet, effective shavingwhile preparing for the next shave by self cleaning.    UPDATE:    Didn't shave for three days....growth was serious...until the Panasonic I would have had to use my Gillette and foamy that resides in the shower to take it off.   Thought I would try before I showered.  The Panasonic took it off as if it were a one day growth.  I have a fast growing heavy beard.
B001CD3M72|1|Product broke with in a week of use. Really don't think my nose hair is that tuff, I do not recommend this product
B00NU3H3KE|5|Product is as described. Very high quality cotton. I have been using this for my vaping needs and it is far superior to regular organic cotton balls. With cotton balls i found that no matter what I would start to get burnt wicks usually within a week of changing wicks. With this Koh Gen Do cotton I have been using the same cotton for 3 weeks now and still no burns. Flavor quality is very good. Koh Gen Do doesnt have that &#34;cotton&#34; taste to it like regular cotton balls seem to have no matter what.
B005TT8X9C|5|Very nice smell
B0009MFUOA|2|I purchased this razor in September of 2005. In December of 2005 the blades were so dull, that it took forever to shave, and I certainly don't have a heavy beard. I am very disappointed with the short life of the blades. At this rate it would cost me $ 120.00 a year for blades. I am sorry to say that I would not purchase this item again, nor would I recommend it.
B00021VWDG|2|I had a bottle of this years ago and was very pleased. I just bought a bottle recently and the scent does not stay on at all. It maybe lasts for an hour or less. I am very disappointed.
B005CRLREY|5|Mom's fave!
B00TIB9530|3|This is not shipped form in the US and I did not receive everything I had originally ordered other than that the product is great.
B004M5VREC|5|Last time I went to the salon, I had vivid purple streaks added to my hair.  They faded over time, so I wanted to revive them, never having done anything like that before.  I bought a Splat purple and ended up with a fluorescent purple scalp, and dull purple-orange streaks.  Thank goodness I wear bangs, or I would have had to cut some.  Then I bought this, and it worked beautifully.  The streaks are shiny, bright, it was much easier/less messy to use, it's not wiping and running purple every time I wet my hair (this is turning into a negative review for Splat), I will NEVER buy Splat again, but I'd definitely buy this - and try additional colors.  BRAVO!
B0006GZ5IU|2|This was a good product at the start. I had bought this along with the conditioner back in February of this year and wanted to wait a while before I wrote anything about either. I had been on the look out for a more natural shampoo and conditioner for my natural hair. I read about these online and decided to try them. The conditioner and shampoo were good, but has seemed to of lost their WOW factor after about 8 months. In the beginning I loved it because it did moisturize my hair very well and I loved how it felt after I washed and conditioned. Now, I'm not sure if it's just because the weather is so humid or not, but it doesn't moisturize like it once did. I have to agree with aabyful, recently the shampoo for some reason was stripping all of my natural oils from my hair and giving me the squeaky clean feeling I don't want. I felt that maybe I was just using too much shampoo and not moisturizing my hair enough in between the times I wash/condition my hair. I changed them both (used less shampoo and moisturized my hair more in between), and the next time I used the shampoo, it was still the same, squeaky clean. As far as the conditioner, I feel like my hair just drinks it all up when I am applying it after I used the shampoo. I would apply more and it still feels the same. I don't get the same feeling when I first used them earlier in the year. I have other natural products that I am going to try. Everyone is different, and it is an on going case of trial and error until you find something that works for your hair. This shampoo and conditioner will no longer be on my fave product list...
B001QWNRRE|5|I loved the shampoo and conditioner. It left my hair feeling silky smooth. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone!
B001IZZX1C|4|Bought this to replace one that I had for many years.  There is nothing else like it and I have never seen it in a store.
B00BNTTD8C|5|It took a while before the nails came but it was worth it.<br /><br />:)<br /><br />I've ordered some Acrylic pain and powder and it's only a matter of time before I put this bad girls to work.<br />Mine were pretty durable. I glued them on my hands and left them on the entire day (a day I was home all day) Just to see how they'd hold up and they did pretty good.
B006UET4XE|5|Love this liner. Even for someone without a steady hand it always gives a wonderful line.
B002B4NP00|5|I bought this product at my local Wal-Mart for $3.00 based off of some Youtube videos I had watched and the lady's really recommended this product for a nice matte finish and I was very satisfied with it. I think this a a terrific product and extremely affordable. I am a new fan of E.L.F product.
B005260HJG|5|Bought a set for travel earlier this year.  They work great- no leaks, cracks after 3 plane trips.  Just ordered a second set to replace other travel bottle that cracked.  Great alternative to the more expensive silicon variety.  Only negative is they come all white- not a variety of colors shown and the labels do not stick.
B00GJXGMSQ|4|I ordered this set of brushes on July 2nd, and received them in the mail today (July 8th)! I haven't used them yet, however, I'm very pleased so far. The bristles are very soft to touch, and they look exactly like the picture. The only issue I have with these brushes are that I'm really not sure which is the bronzer brush, crease brush, etc... But I guess that's really my issue not the brushes! Lol!... Very pleased with the product so far.
B003U4TITW|5|I was very please with this product and I would recomend this to anyone.  I was buy this product again.
B001IDZI0U|1|The only reason I bought this was to get a closer cut than a stand buzzer.  This literally cut my skin.  I tried multiple angles, multiple adjustments, and even 2 people tried to use this and it cut my skin.  I'm not sure if the blades were bent or what the problem was, but I was very disappointed.
B000CRPPWY|5|This is the only hair mousse that I have ever used that actually delivers what it promises:  it gives my hair body and volume, but is still soft and touchable, not all dry and nasty.  $26 is an awful lot for hair mousse, but one can lasts about six weeks (I have medium length hair), and I love how my hair looks.
B001AL4DBA|5|If you want nail polish the color of a Tiffany's box, this is your go-to color.  It matches perfectly and looks great on the nails.
B00CFQ32AC|5|The colors are even better than they look! They all work together for a day or evening look. I am usually a Bare Minerals user, but this could convert me.
B0000532YL|5|I am 67 and have very dry skin and sensitive skin. I love olive oil and I decided to try this soap and it is amazing. It does not dry my skin out at all. I highly recommend.
B00BF26UOW|3|Must have an adventurous nose before ordering. If your comfort zone is traditional smells like CK Eternity etc., do not order this. This has a spice note that some people will find hard to like. For me, it goes alright if used on pulse points, preferably in combination with a light citrus smell..
B004R9GWW0|5|The best cleanser I have EVER used......
B001L7TJC6|5|EXCELLENT
B009QPI6UG|5|perfect travel item.  took it with me for a weekend visit.  it was a big hit.  definitely intended for children as the toothbrush head is quite small, but the size is perfect to put a little tube of toothpaste in with the brush and have everything you need handily in one spot.
B003RS91SY|4|This wig is cute but it did nothing for me!  It has a way too shines to it that gives it a not real look.  I ordered the regular black.  With that being said, I think another lady may find this wig suitable for her.  For the price you can not go wrong if you like the way it look on you.  One other thing to note, it was very comfortable in the fit.  I find it hard to wear wigs for they bust your brains out!  I liked the customer service for they were kind and allowed for easy returns and a quick refund.  They included a catalog in the box which I have already selected some other items!
B000EZQGU4|4|This is a pouf scrubby in towel form. I personally would prefer individual wash cloth size<br />packaged in multiples if available. Shipping was quick.
B000K5E83K|4|my only dislike about this blow dryer is the the comb teeth is made from plastic and the comb teeth bent of of shape need to work on a harder plastic for the comb
B008PAMWUS|5|They fit my Clarisonic and they seem to be original brush heads. Clarisonic works fine with them and this price can't be beat. I would recommend them to anyone.
B00COX5UPQ|5|I just received this last week. There are many types of lavender and this is the real thing. I have tried several types and different companies over the past 16 years of practice and this is by far my favorite. It actually smells like the flower and not the almost medicinal scent of many  others.<br /><br />I use lavender for so many purposes and i really love this. I am buying more now and more  bottles as christmas gifts. It's absolutely worth it. Lavender, peppermint, and tea tree are the 3 essential essential oils that everyone should keep at home all the time. I wish this company had peppermint. Peppermint together with this particular lavender makes a wonderful headache relief.<br /><br />Highly recommend this product and this company provides excellent customer service.
B000AA9HGS|1|I bought this after my mom recommended it. I got it, because i have an oily skin and blackhead problem. At first, it seemed to work- my skin was no longer oily, but really really dry. The nose areas became oily again, but since it was so dry previously, it just began to peal oily skin. And no help on blackheads.
B003LZVIC0|5|Great product. Happy to find it here online since I had a problems finding it in the store.<br />It is a great very light moisturizer that works. I sometimes even put it on my face.
B00L3LB0IG|5|Recently because of medicine changes my face was looking rough and peeling, every morning it always had this husky look.  I received this cream 7 days and I must say, there is a big difference after washing my face twice and day and applying this vitamin c moisturizer cream, it has worked wonders and my family has even noticed the difference.  Now I must order more of this too ensure that I never run out.<br /><br />I received a sample of this product for review purposes. My reviews are my honest opinion and I'm not financially compensated for them.
B00B30SH7E|5|I am a female. Saw this on a beauty blog as a great deodorant for women and it is true and works much better than secret or dove!  Highly recommend for men or women. Smells light. But like a clean candy smell.
B00EOXX5YM|2|it is not what everyone thinks it is .  used on my face just a small amount and after about a hour it looked horrible.... def not something i would recommend for anyone to purchase.  wasted my 37.00
B000ZXDKCM|5|This stuff really works
B00H9T5Z7S|5|This has turned out to be the perfect preventer of the extra-dry skin that winter always brings to me.  At the end of my shower, I put a splash on the washcloth and wipe over the areas that used to itch and break out.
B00B46UFD6|5|Best tanning lotion !!!
B005O30Q0M|5|I love this product it works covers dark circles blemishes and hilites.  Am a big fan of elf make up and the price is right.  I have nothing but good things to say about this product an the others I bought
B009653PQG|5|Love it, wld however like one half the size for certain areas on the face.
B0065R18TY|5|The Leave In Conditioner is GREAT!! It made my wife's hair feel soft and silky; she thoroughly enjoy the product.
B000RL7XFW|5|Pretty Nice product for a Very Reasonable Price.  Helps in Dry Cold and when you are losing moisture in your skin.<br />It is an old stand by and it works well for me.  At the price, it is easy to just try it out.
B004R7R6XG|3|When I coat my whole body after basking in the sun all day, I smell like coconuts and it drives my life partner crazy.  We connect in such an amazing way, that I prefer no to go into detail here.  Thanks No-Ad, you have made my special time really special.
B0037TM252|3|This product is very expensive. I only purchased one bottle and never bought it again. I am going to look for other alternatives out there.
B000GGHT84|5|Not much to review, but I do like the bottle compared to the standard tube.  The price was cheaper than going to my local drug store.  The flavor is fine, and it cleans my teeth.  I obviously cannot give a factual comparison as to how effective it is over another brand/type of toothpaste, so I'll just say I have no complaints.
B00PC33H00|5|Who would've thought there would be a lip balm to stand out above the rest? I sure didn't. My daughter and I suffer from chronic dry lips and have tried most everything we could find from good old fashioned Chapstick to Burt's Bees and everything in between. It all seemed equal and about the same. So when I had the opportunity to try this lip balm for free (being part of the Vine program) I thought &#34;why not?&#34;. But I honestly thought it would not be any different. I could not be more wrong. First, it has peppermint in it which offers a certain healing properties. Second, there is some type of moisturizer in this lip balm not found in any other because I apply this before I go to bed at night and when I woke up my lips were very smooth and moist. The first time in years! So I will be purchasing this from here on out and sing it's praises. The moral of the story is if you suffer from chronic dry, cracked, or chapped lips... this is the lip balm for you!
B00375WFKI|5|I can't believe I got these for $2 each. These are extremely high end liners and I get compliments whenever I wear them. This color would look beautiful on just about anyone I think. It doesn't fade into my brow and stays put all day. Love them. Definitely recommend.
B001M4DY38|4|Purchased for family member and found it easy to form and got a pretty good fit.  Works very well with Opalescence and we're pleased with the cost of trays.
B0046KFZC8|1|These were shipped in a plastic bag with just the tops covered in plastic wrap so they aren't sealed, appears as though they were opened by someone.  Having highlights in my hair I'm used to purple shampoo but this didn't help at all!  Maybe it's just for white hair or I got a defective product.  I have to say though as another posted stated, (my fault for reading reviews AFTER I order stuff lol) this STINKS like all day I smelled like a thrift store or something.  Normally shampoo smells don't stick around but unfortunately this one does.  In the end my highlights still appear yellow instead of bright white and it's not that long after my last highlight so I think this product isn't worth it.  And forget ten dollars s&h for two small shampoo bottles!
B008N6GY94|5|I love this. It is so natural with real spices and orange in it and it smells wonderful like you have a sliced orange right in front of you. It gets your hands clean but doesn't dry skin and not too overpowering of a smell. Great for the kitchen! I love all of the eco soaps!
B00EOXX5YM|5|BEST I EVER TRIED.  NICE, EVEN COLOR.  NATURAL LOOKING, LIKE YOU JUST GOT BACK FROM THE ISLANDS.  I DO THING IT IS A BIT PRICEY BUT IN THE END I FELT IT WAS WORTH IT.
B009TRKJHY|5|Great Quality, fast shipping and this is one of my favorite colors and not sure why. I favor darker tones and this is a very dark green and thats in the sunlight. It has grown on me and I am very happy with the purchase.
B00346U886|5|These needles are great! i ordered them on a friday and they came in on monday! i used one to pierce my smiley and it went through smooth and painlessly. the next day i pierced my best friends septum, she also said she ddidnt feel much. the packaging was discreet which was great.<br />but just remember to have the right size jewlery for the needle. these are 16g so remember youll need 18g!<br />(:
B004883YSU|4|I love Korres lip gloss.  I found this one to be more of a lip stain so I have to use it more sparingly.
B007GZJBKC|5|works well
B00FKSWN8E|5|LOVE this stuff.  It's like Wen, but better and amazingly cheap.  Highly recommend.  My hair gets clean but doesn't feel dried out.  And I had my hair colored and usually when I do my first wash, I see some color go down the drain.  No color washed away when I used this stuff.
B00C224BHC|4|I really like this small shoulder bag  carries my inhaler prescription bottle identification a small notebook and pen now the coin purse in front could use a zipper  but I fixed that I bought a small coin purse to fit inside  the middle of purse has a zipper so no problem there I use it when I am shopping
B00C9QZL3O|5|Love this curling wand. I bought 1 for myself then i bought 2 more for my sisters. Easy to use especially when I brought to Europe. 110-220v feature is super useful.
B002HEW8I4|5|I used this stuff last summer and it worked GREAT. I'm super white if I don't tan but using this stuff last summer I got pretty dark. The salon I tan at stopped carrying this because they got tons of new and more expensive stuff in so I'm buying Smile You're Dark online because nothing else that I have used has worked this well.
B000CQEN5A|5|Leaves your skin smooth and with a hint of fragrance. Not too strong. <br />I was also impressed with how quickly my order was processed, especially during the holiday season. Great company
B00GGH84CW|4|wonderful oil and a great price. I would recommend it for skin and hair. Your hair will be silky and your skin will thank you
B003TQV9PW|4|It's definitely cheap but gets the job done. Hard to clean though so make sure you wipe it at the end of each use if you use product on your hair. It works for bangs really well! Pair it with hair spray when you're done and you're golden!
B008SCUO9Y|5|I wouldn't use any other lipstick once in the morning is all u need, u eat ,drink, it's  still there use a little moisturizer to keep it fresh if u choose
B001NMUWIE|3|I own the larger 1.5&#34; ceramic iron by HairArt which is wonderful because it has so many heat settings and heats  up in 15 seconds.  This iron, I just don't care for as much because there are not settings.  Let me say, it did work pretty well, but I worried that I'd burn my hair out not know how hot it'd get.
B002VWL2BQ|3|The Milk and Shea Butter Bodywash is OK. I far prefer the Peppermint scented Bodywash from Burt's Bees. The milk and shea wash does not foam up. It also has almost no scent. This product is not the type of soap I need.
B004669ILG|4|The styro heads are a bit smaller than the ones found at other retailers and the nose on one was smushed a little in shipping but they served the purpose (hypertufa heads).  We were able to build up the nose with hypertufa on the smushed one, so all is well.  I like the angle of the face on these heads a bit better than what I've purchase elsewhere because they tilt up a bit more in the flower bed.
B0099G0UWO|5|Nice great on a lighter skin tone!!!! Giving to my niece
B0047VSW94|5|Bought this as a gift for the granddaughter. She like it so I like it. This is a great price.
B00XJGVUL0|3|Good price.
B008JWW9VY|5|I came across these brushes and thought they would be nice for my sister to have to start her makeup collection to my surprise they were nicer then I expected them to be especially for the price. She's had them for about 2 years and they still work fine and very little to no shedding when she cleans them.
B00CUGP3OA|3|Good for this price point. It does remove eye make up but I feel like I need to use more than I should.
B001N43JYG|2|Love the spearmint scent, but really not liking the eucalyptus.
B001DKRM8O|5|I bought this for somebody in the hospital after their stroke. The lights were a plus for them and so was the 3X magnification. Has a switch on the cord to turn off if you don't want to unplug each time. It's lightweight and has a metal stand that is good for stability/tilt. The mirror is regular on one side and 3X on the other, it swivels easily. Can't beat the price of around $15.00.
B003BWNR9A|4|Nice brushm
B001VJZEGE|5|for years i've struggled with eczema and sporadic dry skin patches on my face. i opted to stop using steroid creams since, like many of the other reviewers, the problem areas were by my eyes and mouth. this cream not only heals but really soothes your skin - you can see and feel a difference in just a day. i even got my brother into it! i recommend this cream to anyone with eczema.
B004S2G4FG|5|I was not sure how my sensitive skin would react to an oil but I was trusting a good friend who has been using this product and swears by it.  I was amazed at how young she looks, as if she were in her twenties (we are mid thirties).<br /><br />Well, after using this product consistently every day since I received it, I see the results.  My fine lines have decreased, my skin tone has improved and I just look younger!  In fact, I was just carded a few days ago!!!  I will probably use this product for a long, long time.
B00FEES1PI|2|This looks really cool and stylish but it's extremely thin and not very warm. It also runs extremely small and will not fit people that were larger sizes. I got a 2xl and it just fits and I normally wear a medium. So if buying this go up a size or two.
B00J2QH2ZE|3|The item is cute but has already come apart. I am hoping to repair the ends where the leather has come loose from its enclosure. But I would buy this item again.
B000GIJ23M|5|Are you looking for an Instant Panty-Dropper on a budget? Well look no further Friends, this is the cologne for you. Bath in a mist of this on your neck and it will make their panties literally melt off their bodies! I've never met a lady who didn't love Bogart. A few squirts and women will be chasing after you like Zombies looking for brains. Make sure you are well stocked up on Trojans when you check out with this cologne.
B002K8MK0I|2|This is very harsh, I ended up with what looked like/felt like a sunburn and my skin peeled off, that was only with once daily use for a couple days. It did help my acne, but that's because it removed the entire first layer of skin.
B004J6H0F4|5|Love Caviar and the price can't be beat!
B000XFUM4Q|5|love it-easy to use-soft look of a natural brow and worth the money for sure/
B00VJ06PG8|5|Wow!
B003FBQHTY|5|The very best shampoo that I have ever used! I will NOT use another product but this in the future!  Leaves no residue and lathers well.  Hair is left very manageable and shiny.  Steve Gilbert  Denver
B00DCW3PVO|5|The colors are bright and eye catching!<br /><br />My granddaughters loved them; the fact that each Simbi sold purifies a gallon of water per day and provides jobs for the people of Haiti was also a factor.
B00H2T4PR6|2|Not easy to use.  Hair slides off of it when trying to dry.
B003YTMG5Q|4|This product was a great purchase..it was quick,it was easy,and the results were amazing..Normally it takes hours for you to curl your whole head&your arm ends up cramping and hurting.And also the curling irons damage the hair..this took me 7 minutes to do my whole head,and i have long hair down to the middle of my back and i let it dry naturally with out a hair dryer and i had full lovely spiral curls..i wouldnt recommend sleeping on them though. They get a bit ouchy unless you wear a cap over them..i tried it once and woke up with a head ache..
B008FNKWGG|3|These dental guards are also, but unfortunately this particular model does not come with the ultra durable bite material that some others do.
B0002Z8UZ0|1|normally i use jolen mild facial bleaching cream but when i ran out i decided maybe there was something even MORE gentle and i thought i had found in this, since it had such great reviews. my skin is not normally sensitive, but as soon as i applied this (immediately) it burned like hell. the burning sensation does go away after a minute or two but i was so scared i had to wipe it off after like 30 seconds the first time i used it and then eventually i re-read the reviews (some people said they had burning as well) so later i bravely reapplied. as for performance it did not bleach very quickly at all, and even left many dark hairs after the ten minutes. normally i only go 4 minutes or 5 mins with the jolen. the next day i woke up with TWO pimples on my upper lip, im guessing from irritation and i know this is no coincidence. im highly disappointed in this cream, i would never recommend it and i would give zero stars if i could. they should call it burning-pimple-inducing-slightly-bleaching cream! :P i guess i will try to use it for something else..stomach hair or arm hair or something. blah
B00021DO6Y|5|This was AWESOME!!! I'm fortunate to not get too many ingrown hairs since my hair is curly but I had a few stubborn ingrown hairs that refused to go away, and caused scarring! TEND SKIN completely healed and got rid of my ingrown hair. The directions state to &#34;use daily&#34; but I only used as needed. So far my skin is looking nice and clear. If anymore ingrown hairs pop up, I know what I will be using! Great product!
B00005JS5C|5|I love it! Easy to use.
B0037B73N6|5|made my hair looks good and smell very nice
B001BF1EEY|2|The products are just so-so.  My hair is still frizzy. All have a sickeningly sweet smell that overpowers any fragrance you might want to wear.
B00B1W6MNK|1|I would be careful with this one.  Ordered it and box had gold mirror on the outside and a ugly brown color on the inside.
B000HF4PE0|5|My uncle raves about how much this helps!!
B001JE3QQQ|5|I absolutely love the smell of this stuff!  It fills my room and the scent always lasts for so long!
B004G91LAO|2|I use got 2 b products and have always been satisfied until now.  This product does basically nothing for my short hair except fragrance.
B002P8ZF0K|4|Good clipper i bought as a gift to my brother take on the road with him
B006L1DNWY|5|These brushes are great for me as I am just starting out with nail art and designs. They arrived were exactly as described.I love these brushes! And at such a low price thanks.
B000BTARMQ|1|Nice gloss, just doesnt pucker or inflate my lips at all
B000GLRREU|5|Received promptly and working great since it arrived about a month ago.  Used daily by both my husband and I.  Very good puchase
B0037TM252|5|I have been using this product for about 4 months now and have noticed my hair is thicker and does not fall out as much.  I will continue to use this in hopes to see even better results.
B000VCNCPM|2|I bought these scents based on the advertisement to replace some higher end essential oils they claimed to be as good as. The smell was not as good, it diluted even worse.  I don't even use and this is my very favorite scent!
B0053X1G3E|3|Does not have an internal battery and must be plugged in to use. A great inconvience. Should have rechargeable battery.
B002GDMPZC|5|Special Effects dyes much brighter and richer than any other brightly-colored dyes I've tried, and it lasts far longer too.
B00BKOL572|4|Burns.  It only lightened my flat moles.  But it's worth it.  Probably best if you take off the first layer of skin off the flat mole before you apply it.  It does a good job with sunspots.  I use blemish to cover it up.  The peeling came off about 4 days.  Works well.
B00SAX7S8Q|3|This wig is okay, but its really thin and the hair is a bit brittle, sheds constantly, and tangles.  Had it for a month, don't think it will last another month.
B004URZADG|4|I can't say much more than they work as good as when the shaver was new.  You need to replace them at least once a year, or, when you have to really work at getting a smooth shave and it seems to take too long.
B003JTKYZ0|5|I have naturally black hair with a lot of grey hairs all concentrated in one side of my head. Before I used this product I dyed my hair in black to cover those awful grey hairs.<br />I decided to go for a change and dye it using R1 Dark Intense Auburn. At first I was scared when I saw that the creme was turning orange but I still waited.<br />It took forever to rinse and it the shower looked like a crime scene, but it's worth it!<br />The color is beautiful! Inside it looks dark auburn but with sunlight it looks bright red! gorgeous! So if you want to change your color but you don't want a very extreme one, this dye is the right one for you.<br />The only problem I had was that the roots of my grey hairs turned really red, actually kinda pink. So the areas with not many greys look like I have highlights but where there's more of them it looks just funny. I guess I will dye them first in black and then apply this color again!! :)
B009WBJC6G|5|I use this as a makeup primer before applying foundation. It's an excellent alternative to primers containing silicone, which makes me break out. I also use it on my legs after shaving and it prevents any irritation or shaving burn. The pump is very convenient and the large bottle lasts a long time. The smell is very mild and pleasant.
B00A553DIQ|5|present
B0034E702U|1|It made my nails worse!
B008IDBALY|3|I have been looking for the double sided wooded stick q tips since it seems as if J&J has stopped producing them, so I was glad when I came across these. The only problem is the stick party is really thin and once you put any pressure on they snap, so I do not think I would recommend these for personal care use, maybe to be used for crafts.
B002UEQ5AS|5|good
B000Q58BX2|5|This is a bright reddish/raspberry color that looks perky all day.<br /><br />A great color for all seasons.  I do not use the gloss with this one.
B00U9S6TTY|5|Use in my kids diffuser at night. Long lasting scent
B0040880QE|4|I love the price on this item compared to kiosk prices in the malls.  It smooths my nail beds nicely and leaves a great shine that lasts several days (depending on amount of housework/dishes I'm doing!!!).  Would recommend this.
B0046VGPHQ|5|This was so much better than I expected having never used a self tanner. I don't like anything that feels greasy so I was unsure when I ordered it but it was not greasy at all. The application is very easy. Make sure you don't use lotions or oils before applying. This helps the product to soak into the skin and for me it last about a week and is just the right color without looking fake. When it rinses off in the shower the next morning, a little of the excess washes off but doesn't affect the color. Great Product!!!!
B008NZ10TE|5|Received mine already and I loOoOove them! Will need to reorder very soon, haha! Amazing for showing off my latest styles, etc.!
B000NMR0L2|5|Love it
B00CHJUQGU|5|This Axe Dry Solid, Invisible Solid,is for my nephew, he love Axe and all axe products. He said it smells awesome and the girls likes to sit next to him<br />when he has it on. He also said it stays on and keep him dry all day.
B0049DQNYG|1|I wore this without telling my husband and when I got closed to him he told me something smelled like pee. Terrible product
B0018C9EUG|5|The product was exactly as described.  Smooth transaction.  I would buy from them again.
B00HJDIAGC|4|I am a smoker and coffee drinker and for years have tried different things to keep my teeth looking white. I tried this product after using white strips in the past, and I found it to be much easier to use. Since the tray actually formed to the shape of my mouth, I found that more of the tooth area was covered, and it was a much more comfortable experience overall. The price is also great and I am very pleased with the results I got. I would recommend this product to anyone.
B0009IK198|4|Works good if you shave everyday and don't let your hair grow too long.  Still doesn't get every hair or shave as close as I would like but its quicker and more convenient than shaving with a non-electric shaver.
B003H146PY|5|The actual fragrance is a little bit odd or cheap or something, so I added a few drops of my favorite citrus aftershave. Now it's great. I get a lot of smiles from the opposite sex when I wear this, from business contacts to waitresses. Also, it seems to be more effective on younger women, which is nice.
B00J0ZA44I|5|I love this!! Need to order more!
B0088Y7VOI|5|Seller delivered it quickly and as described.  I have been using the product for just a couple weeks and it seems to be helping with the wrinkles around my eyes.  I'll know more when I have used it a longer time, but so far so good.  Much cheaper than the other products on the market.
B004WP28UE|5|This body butter way out performed the better known brands at the fraction of the cost and the smell is stuble and long lasting!
B000QU1602|5|My mom has used this face cream for years and swears by it.  This was a gift for her. I know she will use it forever. She is almost 80
B00MSKDO76|1|Why buy a nose ring when you can have a horse shoe?!
B003WYKQQO|3|I've tried quite a few of the Ann Webb products and I love them all except for this one, really.  It seems to work for a lot of people, but it irritates my sensitive skin and makes everything blotchy the next morning.  SO if you have pale, easily irritated, easily inflamed, translucent terrible skin, this may not be the best option for you.  BUT I love the line so 3 stars it is!
B00L2IO8RU|5|This is a handy gadget for doing nails at a fraction of the cost of going to a nail salon.  It pays for itself .  The LED aspect is safer than UV light.  I will use it often.
B002GQ3FAI|5|I have had thinning hair since my last baby was born 15 years ago. I have been using the Bosley system for a year and I can really notice a difference in the volume and amount of my hair.
B00O90YZGC|4|Loved it.
B0000AFUT3|2|I also have this mirror with light bulb problems.  I have the paperwork that came with it and there is a section about replacement bulbs.  It says not to attempt to change it but to \\"send us your mirror and we will service it for you\\".  Does anyone have any idea where to send it to??
B000GCURBO|5|i had some dandruff problem was embarrassing  bought this , it is almost disappeared in few wash, i would recommend 100% ,
B00397SNMS|5|I love this argan oil from Elma & Sana. I have first tried argan oil from Sephora (the JM brand) and thought the oil was absolutely amazing but thought the price was way out of my range. I researched online to find the best alternative to JM's argan oil and read all the reviews. It took me couple of days to decide and I have finally decided to give this a try because of the great reviews. Now I only use this! I have purchased this 3 times already and I am still in love with this brand's argan oil. It essentially the same thing as JM's or better. :) I love the price and quality.
B001FXUTUM|5|This thing works. That doesn't mean it's fun to use, but it's efficient and does the job and is oh so much quicker than tweezers. Sometimes you still need to do just a bit of a tweeze afterwards.<br /><br />I had this REM spring for a few years but then lost it while traveling, so I replaced it with the slightly less expensive Bellabe version (amazon.com/Bellabe-118-Facial-Hair-Remover/dp/B001RPL902/). After just a few months, the Bellabe one started to oxidize, lose its smoothness and shine and get a kind of galvanized look to it, which also made it harder to use and keep clean. I lived with it for a while and then when the price dropped on this REM version, I bought one.  It's worth it.  The one I had for years stayed clean and smooth the whole time I had it and the new one appears to be holding up as well.
B003J9R50W|5|I love this combination of brushes.  I can give different treatments to my back and finish off with moisture before I towel off.  They only thing it does not come with directions so it took a little bit to figure out.
B0058SY1XQ|5|This is the second Wahl trimmer I've owned - and it is an upgrade from my first one.  I like the heft and ease of use (a push on/off button) and it has an indicator light that shows when it is charging - and when charging is complete.  The plug-in charger works with both 120 and 240 volt power supplies, making this ideal for international travel.
B0083PLA3K|5|The idea behind how this mirror works is very simple, but the effect is profound.  Two specialty mirrors are angled at perfect 45 degree angles to each other reversing the normal reversing effects of a typical mirror thus showing a “true” reflection of yourself…what other people see when they look at you.  The more you look at this, the more amazing it gets (assuming you’re the kind of person that likes to ponder the meaning of self).  There is no doubt Freud and Jung would have had one of these if they could have…well maybe just Freud.<br /><br />Now, LET’S SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT….you are very unlikely to be able to build one of these on your own.  Why?  It comes down to the transition point where the two 45 degree mirrors meet.  In order for the two mirrors to look like one seamless one, the reflective surfaces have to meet in the center with an incredible degree of precision.  To accomplish this, the maker (whose name I unfortunately cannot recall) uses two mirrors that have the reflective surface on the front face, as opposed to 1/8” back under glass the way 99% of mirrors are manufactured.  This allows the reflective surfaces to meet perfectly.  Both mirrors are also mounted on an adjustable mechanism that allows you to dial in the seam perfectly.  This is the only way to really get this to work as atmospheric changes in the environment are likely to cause subtle shifts to the mirrors and box and break the illusion.  In short, while the concept of the mechanics of this are very simple, the construction is much more complicated than it looks.<br /><br />Is it worth $200?  That depends on what your interests are.  I say undoubtedly yes.  I saw these for the first time at Burning Man 8 years ago and was blown away.  The connection you make with yourself is unlike anything you will ever experience through a picture or video.  It is the closest you will come to meeting yourself in person. The experience is uncanny and difficult to describe without seeming like someone who has mentally left planet earth, but it is definitely a one-of-a-kind experience.  I still haven’t ponied up for one because it is definitely a chunk of money, but I thought that while I’m saving up it would be a kind deed to all those who are interested to know how amazing these really are.<br /><br />UPDATE 12/1/2015:  For those of you who are disappointed with the plastic case...I agree.  I know that John used to make the cases out of wood, but it is my understanding that they were more prone to flexing than the plastic ones.  This in turn causes the mirrors to need regular adjustment.  That being said, many wood workers use high grade plywood with real wood veneers for this same reason (most high end cabinets are built this way as well).  I could definitely see the quality (and potential heirloom issue) taking a huge leap forward if John were to construct these out of high grade plywood instead and finish it with solid wood edging.  Solid wood would of course look amazing, but sounds like the payoff may not be worth it.one who has mentally left planet earth, but it is definitely a one-of-a-kind experience.

B000EBFJXS|2|DOESN'T CUT NOSE HAIR VERY GOOD
B005PUZZR8|5|I searched for a couple of months to find the right trimmer. When I came across this one it had everything I was looking for and the price was right also. It is working much better than I was expecting. I use it a few times a week and only had to charge it twice since I bought it December of 2012, 1-year this month. It feels very well made, not cheap plastic like alot of others. I do not experience pulling or any other discomfort. I love the wheel where you can set it for the lengh you prefer. Cleaning it is very easy and the attachments exchange very easy. The best thing is how long the battery lasts. I used it for nearly 6 months before I had to charge it and it is almost another 6 months and its still going strong. I also sounds very powerful when running. You will not be dissapointed in this one. Amazon got it here in 2 days with my prime shipping.
B00LXGKK96|2|It just doesn't work...
B000VV40A4|5|Product arrived quickly! I bought one for myself and one for a friend. I wear it everyday! Great product!
B004MYS2RS|5|The Lavendar, Chamomile and Passion Flowers make a wonderful relaxing blend.  I highly recommend this item.  Great price as an add on item.
B004W349JY|5|Sturdy design. I love it. The 10 wrap coils push just the right amount. Box was fun as well.
B007ROD3AG|4|Great dryer, Dries my curly hair on big rollers in 40 minutes!  That is at 60 •c, which is between yellow and red on the heat setting controll....Just have to find the proper chair to sit under it:)
B00KXMNDOA|5|This serum is a part of my daily skincare regimen, as it works wonders on my dry and sensitive skin. I love its anti aging properties as well and the results that I get from using this product has got me hooked! I am in my mid-thirties and I want to take care of my skin as best as I can, so I don't have to worry about fine lines and wrinkles any time soon. So far, using this serum has been working like a charm!<br /><br />I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services that I use personally and believe will be good for consumers like myself. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.
B000US07YG|2|The lipstick color (caramel) was OK but I had to push on my lips to get the lipstick to even move; not very comfortable plus the odor was offensive.  It is almost a rancid odor. The idea of the ingredients sounds good but not user friendly.
B001E95HJU|5|AN EXCELLENT VALUE AND IT DOES HELP HAVE  BETTER,SMOOTH,AND COMFORTABLE SHAVE
B00F008GFQ|5|Love this brush it's so soft and foundation goes on so nice :) I recommend it for all the ladies
B00AF676NS|1|Didn't work for me at all
B00C7DYBX0|2|breaks my face out.
B007TXSOLS|4|I went to Sally's beauty to buy this gel nail polish for a friend for Christmas. All they had was the mini polish sizes and they were a dollar more. I then went to amazon to find the same brand and color of nail polish in the bigger size (the regular size of a bottle of nail polish) for $1 cheaper than at the store. I was very excited because spending nearly $15 to get that mini bottle of nail polish seemed ridiculous. Now, I got the normal size and only spent about $13. It makes me feel a little better about spending that much on nail polish.
B0054S63JA|5|I love these
B006L1DNWY|5|i chose this rating because as well as the othr detailer brushes these come in every size you could possibly need in painting nails.
B007W608N4|4|Great
B001KZPJL4|5|My husband usually doesn't like me wearing perfume as it's over powering, but this is very subtle, and he likes the hint of it. He says you can slightly smell it as I walk buy, so it's a hit. A bit pricy, but worth it.
B000PKYCJA|3|Very good product
B00AL7X31K|5|I can't imagine how there could possibly be a pair of scissors that could be the slightest bit better than these. These would be an appropriate gift to royalty. These are incredible and are what they say they are and more.
B00H2F85H6|4|Very handy to keep on desk to clean hands after handling money.  I also use them to clean my computer keyboards, desktop, telephone, door knobs, and pretty much anything anyone touches. I prefer to wash my hands, but these get me by until I can get to the  hand washing area. I like using these more than surface disinfecting wipes because they don't feel so harsh on my skin.
B00H1M8R3C|2|ok but not great you get what you pay
B004Y9M0KQ|5|This is my second time buying this product and it's by far my favorite Baby Lips- the smell is amazing and it really hydrates your lips.
B00B0RE61G|2|Don't care for the smell - it smells too chemically for me....threw it in the garbage.  Won't be buying again.
B004RCCPTQ|5|No other shampoo, conditioner or any sort of cleanser I have tried has made my hair feel so good! I have very fine hair, which I blow dry and straighten, and this cleanser helps keeps my hair fresh and strong. It's also a very reasonable price compared to similar products - plus its a cleanser and conditioner all in one. My only small criticism is that it doesn't apply as smoothly as some other products out there, but once you work it through your hair it feels great.
B00HFQQ0VU|5|Better than expected. I wish I had bought one many years ago.
B0035LCW0W|5|I am very happy about this product. I used other brands and they cause irritation, but this one is gentle and definitely works on sensitive eyes, no irritation at all and glues very well. Dry quickly, easy to stick on.
B0026J10CU|5|I was very nervous to order eyeshadow online, with out being able to see the quality of the colors.  Also, the other thing was in the shipping process I was worried that the shadows would be broken.  When I got the product only one of the blacks were broken, so no real love lost there because I have a ton of black.  The colors were just what I wanted great colors I will be buying them again.
B0075EDUVK|5|Quality was as described, new. Delivery was on time. No hassle at all. Was a great alternative compared to paying the more expensive price for the actual perfume and it smells exactly the same.
B00008MOQN|5|Reliable old favorite that still holds up in the market.  Good price, goes on smoothly and stays on.  I need waterproof due to oily skin, and I keep coming back to this one.
B009HMZG9C|5|I like both of these eye pencils - they are jumbo size and so easy to use - creamy and fantastic!  I love NYX lipsticks too!
B00GMP05YS|4|I like it! Pretty good ingredients, I will buy it again!
B0072I8NAC|5|Always wish we could take a whiff of the scent through the computer (maybe someday?), but Michel's soaps are all great...
B00IXZ3T20|5|Love the valued and price.
B00C7OOGKM|3|The top was kind of loose and some of the oil was all over the bottle and the shipping box.
B0007MW2ZW|5|Good Product, works very well, great lather, smell is how it should be, real manly Barber shop smell. Thank you
B0000DK5LW|3|This product does remove hair but didn't work as well on coarse hair...so a bit of a disapointment. I read other reviews before purchasing and decided to buy since some were saying that it works great on coarse hair...but it doesn't. For now I will have to stick to threading with my $1.99 spring hair removal which hurts but works great until I can afford one of those expensive tools.
B004SUPEOK|5|Love it!
B005HF15UM|5|This held a ton of my jewelry for a trip we took abroad.  The weight I had in it I though for sure I was going to tear it or rip it but it came through like a champ!  I would definitely buy again but I hope this one will last for a long time to come.
B003XPXIHQ|5|I love this stuff! I says what it's going to do and actually lives up to it.<br />I have acne prone skin, so when I'm breaking out real bad, I slather some on (it's very fun to play with!) and wait 20 minutes then wash it off and BAM! You can notice softness and your pimples will reduce in size and won't be so red and irritated looking.<br />I would reccomend to everyone! The price is a little iffy for only a small bit, but well worth it!
B005P0I5IE|1|Too much shipping on a small item
B00ON1HASC|2|This foundation was easy to apply. It lasted for roughly 8 hours. It went on my skin smoothly and evenly, and it did not cause me any irritation. I did not like the coverage. It did not hide the imperfections of my skin and actually made some of them stand out. While the applicator was easy to use I also did not like it. It felt weird on my skin. I have a dollar store foundation that I prefer over this specific Covergirl foundation. Extremely disappointing.<br />**I received this item as a free sample for testing and review purposes. The ideas and opinions expressed here are mine and mine alone.
B000CSDDDG|5|I've been using this for the last 20 years, someone from Hawaii introduced it to me.  It's much more coarse than \\"poofs\\" that other people bathe with.  I prefer it more coarse so that it is actually exfoliating me.  I find it easier to use and handle than the poofs (also easy to scrub your back).  I don't know how to shower with out it.  If I forget it while traveling and have to use a face towel, I don't feel as clean.  It air dries pretty quickly and I store it in a ziploc for travel.  I usually keep mine for a couple years, I put in in the laundry and air dry it to clean it every so often.  The old ones I recycle as my travel wash cloth.<br /><br />I used to find it at a shop on Grant Ave in SF Chinatown, and an Asian mart in Bergenfield, New Jersey.  I'm glad I've found it on Amazon!<br /><br />You do have to watch out for knockoffs, they are not as coarse (unless you prefer softer ones).  Whole Foods also has a version which is a little longer, and softer.
B000URYTTQ|3|I love the scent of pineapple and coconut which is one of the reasons for buying this product. The lotion smells great, but the scent doesn't last-I prefer the scent to last several hours. It absorbs quickly and goes on easily, and its not greasy. I don't recommend it if your skin is already dry as I find this lotion only moderately moisturizing.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would order it again because of the lack of lasting scent and I feel it is also over-priced.
B005XCX854|5|I have atopic dermatitus and have spent years of my life itching. The back is the worst because I just can't reach where it itches. Most back scratchers do not have have a sharp enough edge to be effective. I scratch harder and harder trying to get them to work but to no avail. Just when I was ready to file the edges down I bought one of these from my daughter's fund raiser. I then bought 4 more from Amazon. It scratches really well. the retractable handle makes it convenient to carry one around in my purse too!
B007822G8W|5|Really feels great on your skin. Odd at first because it is a gel not a cream. But I really like it and will order it again.
B007RTRQP4|5|I use this daily! It's awesome firming lotion, great for even people with sensitive skin. And it takes care of so many skin issues from cellulite to acne. You can also get it cheaper from a distributor. Jessicamcnaspy11.myitworks.com
B000HB069M|1|Flat iron worked fine until it was out of warranty period and developed internal break in power cord.  Farouk refuses to send replacement cord at any cost so my wife now has a worthless $100 flat iron.  Power cord, which should last indefinitely, is very poorly designed.
B008X0LA12|1|Very hard net not easy to put on bun
B00074LNUU|5|For those with truly curly, not just wavy hair, this is the product line you have been looking for!  It will leave your curls defined yet silky and shiny.  My hair is thick and long with loose ringlets, and I started getting many complements while using this product.  Great for summer as it fights frizz, and gentle enough that it keeps hair hydrated and glossy during the winter.
B00EJMHSH8|3|Combs tug as they go into hair. Don't hold as well as other combs I own, but are okay in a pinch.
B00127X160|4|These are strong and very pretty.  These are also very expensive for two hair pins....but they do sparkle in a chignon.
B000068PBT|5|Great to have sharp blades again.
B00BCK29KQ|5|The package arrived promptly. The seller is very friendly. :)<br /><br />Although the color in the pic is a bit off, the color is a soft, bright pink. Opaque lipsticks look best when blotted on the lip, as opposed to swabbing it across the lip. I love Lime Crime and have a few of their lipcolors! Very happy with my purchase.
B00I55A4TY|1|I mixed the pure henna with coffee and warm tea and after leaving it on only one hour I now have flaming orange hair.
B002WDXGCC|4|I received a repackaged product. It did not come in its original package or have any directions. The suctions cups will not hold it onto the tub, but  I managed to figure out a way to get it to hold. All said and done, my 89 year old mother really enjoys it during her bath and that is all that matters.
B00G7S424O|4|Smells great but leaves your nails kind of oily, to be expected though. Takes some pretty hard running to remove polish. Will continue to use it though since I use all natural products.
B001B7PVRS|5|I find this cuticle pusher much easier to use, and more effective than the usual type.
B007YUZYZ0|4|Heres no adjusting how hard or soft it hits. I woukd neeever use it for black n grey, too choppy.
B00MD28XL6|5|very pleased
B007SIG5HY|1|I would not recommend this product because it is so much like canola oil, I am convinced that it is actually regular refined oil.
B004Q89I4Q|5|If you love citrus scents then  buy this. Its smells like sweet grapefruit and lemon but in a very pleasant way. But dont spay too much; it's a very strong scent. I would say this is more of a younger scent though, itll make you feel young! It smells like Summer to me!
B008RG9MKS|4|size & weight very good but could use a high COOL setting.  that would make it perfect
B007RIEYGO|5|I love the Anew products and Amazon pricing can't be beat!
B00B2ARZC8|5|This is the best product for fine limp hair.  I've used it for years and always get complemented on the shine and body of my hair.
B000JCATHI|3|I love the scent! I spray it on my bed every night. I gave the product 3 stars because the spray mechanism broke on first use. I transferred the spray into a new bottle and have not had any problems since. This was disappointing though.
B00163MX8C|5|I love OPI and I love this color. Great color to add to my collection. I get at least 2 compliments a day on this color.
B00BEUAZTG|5|I love this product I have been using proactive for years and I received this FREE through Smiley360. Tried it loved the results
B00GCZ9X5K|5|i love it
B00H7GHUQW|5|Picture makes it look large and it's reay small.
B00B594L2S|4|I love these lashes! Quick shipping and they are natural! The only thing I don't like is the band but other than that they are amazing!
B00BZOLOSC|5|Bought this for my 1 year old son. Just as described. He loves it. Good price. Fast shipping.
B005Z9RQ08|3|It's cleans hair good, but leaves hair kinda knotty.
B00B6LLXMG|5|perfect
B00MVH9ZM4|5|I was given one bar of Shugar Soapworks Oatmeal and Shea Butter soap as a gift and I searched the Internet to find more.  The fragrance is excellent and not overpowering and I am not allergic to it, which is amazing since I've developed allergies to almost everything, including the pure bar soap that floats. An added plus: it lasts forever!
B007UO79GC|4|This has everything, perfect started kit--I bought this because I wanted to try some ELF products, and this was a great way to try it. Perfect for blue eyes!
B001AXFGC8|5|I love this product.  It is easy to use and quickly cools down the blades of my clipper.  I use my clipper every 2 weeks for approximately 40 min. each use.  I use it to cool the clipper and to clean off the hair from the clipper and between the blades, probably about 2-3 times during the 40 min of use. I think my clipper still works like new because of this.  I have an oster 86.
B000141XQA|5|Of course with waxing pain is inevitable but this wax is so easy to apply and take off. I would highly recommend this to any female/male doing Brazilian waxes. You have to try it.
B007P74SJK|5|Searched around for months at different beauty supplies etc....this was the right perfect fit hose matched my original ones and the best price I found.
B00IUADK5O|1|These lipsticks werent as good as I expected .<br />They are super light that cant even see the color its more like lip gloss not lipsfick disappointed.
B001E0WK44|4|This is a liquid and a better dispensing method would make the product a five star product. The product is very good for the desired intent.
B001LF4G4Y|5|I have very thick, very long hair, and usually when I straighten my hair it takes nearly an hour to finish up... I was really hoping this wouldn't be a dude, and it's not!  I get my whole finished in under half an hour, and I get SO many compliments!!  By far the best iron i've ever had!!!
B009XPRZJW|5|i have a lot of purses but HATE changing them because of moving everything and then having to learn where this or that is now that its in a new purse...and with this everything is in the SAME spot every time you change your purse so so convient
B00A6VN56E|4|Wow!  The products I need to keep my Blow-out activated at a FRACTION of the cost!
B000JNQSIQ|3|Got what we paid for.
B00BVA0II2|1|Warning! This is not herbal nor natural, it's a pharmaceutical product which contains 5% Menoxidil, which decreases blood pressure (as side effect). I have proven laboratory test report here and I suggest vendors to remove the &#34;herbal note&#34; - it contains a synthetic ingredient and it's NOT HERBAL !
B003H9L0TQ|5|☆☆☆☆☆
B001CI6RQK|3|This was ok but I would need a 2nd application to keep from smelling and that is on a cool day where I'm not really sweating.  It also started giving me some chemical burn on one side.  Moving on.
B003Q6VEOG|1|WHEN THEY SAY \\"MINI\\", THEY MEAN MINI!!! Its about 3 inchs and only has 3 groves for crimping. I figured it would be smaller, but not the size of an ink pen!! Havent used it yet since its a Christmas preasent, but hopefully its better the it looks!!
B003G963N0|5|This brand of products is great for hand cream, and the haircare lived up to the brand's expectations! My hair has never felt better. I am really stuck on this shampoo! It is awesome.
B004XWE8HW|2|Didn't lke it. Could not see at all.
B0000530GS|5|Hold is what we gals mostly desire.  Bet you gals are putting too much on your hair and in the wrong places.  Firstly, if you think it is TOO hardish, do this &#62;&#62;  after it is ready to be sprayed spray the product in you hand and take your hand andrub it through you hair at the roots, do this three (3) times and you won't get the impact of the actual Aussie Instant Freeze.  If you feel that is too light try this carefully now spray the front root of head by separating the hair easily.  This give the root-end a stronger dose of the product and the root is a firm hold but not the hair on top.<br /><br />Personally, I love the stuff - used to use Focus which was great years ago but it appears now they have done something to the new formula and it stinks, too, too weak.  You can purchase Aussie at Walmarts for $2.97 for a 7 oz. can.
B00021DJZK|5|I really love this bronzer, it gives a natural tan to my skin and a little goes a long way! I really recommend it!
B006IBM21K|5|Received quickly and as described - very pleased
B00RFM5984|5|In love with these brushes they are quality brushes
B00ISPVQC0|5|all came as expected
B0058SY1XQ|5|Heavy in your hand which feels nice after years of cheap trimmers. Powered through my long beard like a boss.
B00CBGAYR0|4|This is very great product and I also put me on my hair sometime. It makes my hair and body very soft. I definitely recommend this.
B002MHW4MG|5|Tiny and light, just right for carryon air travel. This is my second one; first one lasted for several years with DAILY use. Can't live without it.
B001EJOPHU|3|It just doesn't work that well.  I'll put layer on top of layer and I still stink.  In fact, rather than merely failing to cover up my stench, it transforms it from a bruthy and manly odor to making me wonder if someone in the next room is scarfing pepperoncinis and smoking a doobie.<br /><br />I'll still give it 3 stars for smelling pretty good, and making me feel clean and healthy when I apply it.<br /><br />Warning about the 6 pack: I swear, these lost their scent after several months - the last few sticks didn't smell anything like I remembered the first few smelling.
B003QPGY0Q|2|Not good on my sensitive skin. It breaks me out really bad.
B00IQKPLUU|3|The fragrance does not smell the best and doesn't stay on your hands hardly at all.The pump bottle has a pretty picture but the aroma isn't  that  great.The warm vanilla sugar foaming soap feels soft on your hands but I would not purchase this fragrance again.
B00LNOKC2I|5|LOVE this curling tool! I would give 10 stars if I could! My hair has never been able to hold a curl until this beauty came around...now I can get two good days out of my curls! I have put too much hair in or hair that was tangled. It just gives me a little beep and I take my hair out and try again. I really don't know how you could mess it up or get your hair stuck! Super simple, easy and IT WORKS!!!
B001MA0QY2|5|I, like many of you are reading reviews to see if this product is worth purchasing. I ordered the HSI on line and was skeptical.  The price was great 39.99 and I didn't have to pay shipping and handling.  When I recieved the product, I immediately tryed it out.  I can tell you that I was amazed. I only had to go thru my hair ONE time and the best part of it is that there was no fly aways.  Don't know about you but my past flat iron experience is that althought the iron can get my hair straight, it left fly aways strands.  This is the best flat iron I've ever purchased. I love it!!!
B004WPGXMI|5|love ordered a year ago and still works good
B001LF4B8A|5|I've been using Oil of Olay soap for a couple of years and find that it is very moisturizing and has a pleasant scent.  Recommend.
B004JX8O6G|3|it's ok
B00DS1R8V2|2|It would have been wearable if it was black as listed and ordered. It was OBVIOUSLY brown and didn't match me at all. Useless!
B005356O34|3|the product holds edges 'ok' but it flakes up just like all the others.
B000U03B06|5|30 years of using eyeliner pencils and this is the ONLY one that does the job well. The point ends up so sharp, I can make a precision line that looks amazing. All other sharpeners sharpen, but the point gets flattened or not sharp enough, so I have to keep sharpening, which wears away the pencil too quickly.
B000ZLVUYO|5|I'm African American with sometimes unmanageable hair due to so much new growth(which can be attributed to my lack of a perm in over 3 years.)This hair mask is amazing!Now,I have soft,beautiful hair.Whew,I will always purchase this mask whether it's a little costly or not.Thanks again.
B0013JG3KS|5|This the best product to get rid of oily locking skin. If you have an oily prone to breakout skin this is for you. It lives your skin with long lasting matte finish, soft and, healthy locking . Incredibly it helps to clean up your skin too, maybe because of the rice within.<br /><br />I strongly recomend it
B004Z40048|5|First off they arrived 10 days after I ordered them. Amazon estimated the delivery at 3 weeks so I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived early. For $1.18, I was not expecting much but again I was surprised.  They are soft and the strip is very thin. Some people stated in their reviews that the lashes are too long...well the product advertises \\"LONG Black False Eyelashes\\". There are shorter ones available on Amazon, so if you don't want long ones look else where. I have paid $10.00 for a set of three from Sephora and these are a tenth of the price, a set of ten, and comparable quality.<br /><br /> More importantly I have worn them out twice and had so many compliments it was ridicules. I cannot tell you how many women ask me were I got them.
B005XUNG5I|5|This thing work! my feet were a disaster and this thing has smoothed the soles of my feet so nicely!
B00ANR2AM6|5|BEST lip balm ever! I've searched many other brands in all price ranges. I'm never using anything else!
B00AHAWWO0|5|Great teeth whitening product.  There's a ton of applications per box.  This is the best whitening product I've come across, and the price is reasonable to me.
B000GLRREU|5|This is my 2nd Waterpik . This contraption did my teeth / gums , a whole lot good  !!! I was having problems with periodontal pockets , and with the help of the Waterpik , I experienced SIGNIFICANT improvement . No more risk of my teeth loosing , and requiring more extensive work  . This is a great maintenance tool !
B00Q96XGUU|5|This product is excellent! My complexion is glowing!
B00BGVL4MK|4|I got it earlier than I thought. The product is what I expected, It moisturize my hair even on a rainy day.
B00NO8DT2G|5|I have been having a problem with dry lips this winter and my regular Chapstick wasn't working for me.  I wanted to try something more natural so I decided to check these out.  So far, I love them.  They have a great flavor, not that waxy flavor.  They also make my lips soft and shiny.  I would definitely recommend them to friends.  Also, they came quickly and packaged well.
B000FEIOHW|5|I bought this Sonicare brush on a \\"trial\\" basis and I've found that it works just as well as the more expensive ones with the rechargeable batteries.<br /><br />There are two great benefits:<br />1) Low price of the brush.<br />2) Space saving in that you don't have to have a counter space/electrical plug for the charger.<br /><br />I've had my brush for over 3 months now and still using the original set of batteries provided.  No issues whatsoever.<br /><br />I also don't understand the reports of water leaking into the battery chamber.  I think maybe those are with the earlier designs but clearly, the one that I have is completely sealed and you should not get water in there unless you completely submerge your unit.
B00GNJAHDW|5|Love this hairspray!
B00DLRNSSK|5|All I can say is \\"Score\\" lol.. My wife has a scar that made her self conscious so I searched amazon for a product that could possibly help her out. Found Dermarestore when searching \\"scar treatment for old scars\\" on amazon and they were at the top with over 100 reviews. Gave it whirl and gave it to my wife to try out. She already is seeing a difference and loved the thoughtfulness of the gift along with the [[ASIN:B00ING1Q4M Phytoceramides Gluten Free - Skin Care Products For Women, 30 Day Supply, Anti Aging Beauty Product, Advanced with Vitamin A, C, D and E, Clinical Strength Ceramide-PCD Formula, Made From Rice, 30 Vegetarian Capsules, Works Great with Vitamin C Serum as...]] I got her as well.<br /><br />Win win all the way around. Thanks dermasrestore
B0041TGSYI|5|Love this product.  It lightens my hair at a fraction of the cost then a salon.
B00122VL08|5|First of all, I absolutely love my Cor soap.  I have been plagued by acne my entire life and tried many products, including Retin-A.  Cor, however, has been the best answer to my acne-dilemma.  The number of breakouts I have has greatly been reduced and when I do have breakouts there is less redness and the bumps are smaller (I wouldn't even call them pimples anymore).  Many people compliment me on my beautiful skin, which I am now happy and proud to say is often makeup free-- I'm no longer trying to hide spots or redness with foundation, instead I just toss on a light powder, blush, and mascara and I'm good to go.    That said, I know that the price is high.  However, I have used the same bar (on average twice daily) for well over a year and it still has over 40-50% of its original mass.  I think that with careful use, it will last at least 18 months.  I store my Cor in an antique soap dish OUTSIDE the shower.  When I am ready to wash my face, I simply wet my hands and reach outside the curtain, I rub the top of the soap bar 10-15 times with one hand and use that to put the lather on my face.  There is not very much lather, but you can feel that your face is getting clean. I am careful to rotate the lid of my soap dish on and off, as I feel is appropriate with the humidity, so it doesn't 'melt' away.     I have never written an online review before, but I would like to highly recommend Cor soap.  If you are skeptical, buy the sample size and try it.  I have turned many new friends on to the soap, because it really is great.  If you are careful and don't bring the soap into the shower, the sample should last you over a month.  The samples are $12, so you really have very little to lose and the trade off is beautifully clear skin!!
B002GKC3MU|4|Had an old Oster shaver that bit the dust.  Panasonic has always had reputable products so took the plunge and purchased this shaver.  So far so good.  I usually keep it plugged in so not sure about the charging capacity.  As far as the cutting experience goes, it is easy and painless...I recommend this.
B000GFYPU0|4|I have used MANY different haircoloring products in the past and decided to try Herbatint because of all the good things I have read about this product. I used Herbatint Dark brown 3N (which is my natural haircolor) on my hair. After applying it I noticed a change in my hair. My hair was softer and shinier. The only bad thing was the dark brown color looked more like black on my hair. The Herbatint covered all my gray hair and the haircolor lasted 6 weeks before the grays stared showing. I did use a shampoo and condition for color treated hair maybe that is why the color lasted as long as it did. I wanted to go lighter and I made the mistake and ordered Chestnut 4N thinking it would make my already dark hair lighter....it did not. What it did do is deposit more dark dye onto my dark hair which made it look even more black ...if that is possible. All in all I would recommend this product. The only advise I can give is make sure you pick a shade 3 shades lighter than your NATURAL HAIR COLOR. I guess I should have Herbatint colored my hair the first time with Dark Blonde 6N. I am now trying to get the dark shade out which is a very slow process. Perhaps when the very dark shade is finally out of my hair I will try the 6N shade to see if I can achieve a medium brown color. Also note inorder to keep the hair color fresh and lasting use a shampoo and conditioner for color treated hair or else the hair color will wash out REALLY fast!
B004BRG1YC|5|my daughter loves it
B0009OMU0A|3|This trimmer worked great until the battery completely died and wouldn't hold a charge.  For me it lasted a little less than a year before dying.  I guess I shouldn't expect much from such a cheap product.  Also, one annoying feature is that if the trimmer dies while you're using it, you can't just plug it in and continue use.  You have to wait for it to actually charge.
B00885N5CE|4|I love this fragrance.  The gift set allows me the option to apply lightly with lotion or pen, or spray as desired for a stronger scent.  This is a strong scent for me though and may be applied more frequently in the cooler months.
B0026IJ1IG|4|I love the ease of application and tone of the powder, however I did hit pan pretty quickly. I've had this product for roughly a week now and I have already started to run out.
B00EEGEI7C|4|I bought this to decrease the bags under my eyes and all I can simply say is it works!
B00S7KFZTG|5|I have a skin brush that does a good job, so why would I need another one? Because this one has different heads for different functions. This spin brush not only had the face brush, it has a larger body brush, a pumice stone for elbows, knees, and heels, and a sponge for putting on your moisturizer, which really does a nice job.<br /><br />The spin action is comparable to others I've used. It's gentle enough not to feel like I'm spinning my face off, but strong enough to feel clean and I can practically feel the increased circulation to my face. The brush is very simple to use, the heads change easily, even in a wet slippery shower.<br /><br />A nice bag is included for travel or storage, although I wouldn't store it since I am busy using it.<br /><br />This is a very nice brush and I love having the extra heads for different uses.<br /><br />sample provided for evaluation
B004IH5XQ2|5|I'm generally not a body spray user because they are typically too overpowering and strong (think Bath and Bodyworks and Victoria's Secret).  Kiss is lighter, and although the scent doesn't last all day, it's the perfect amount when applied.  I love it!  And the pheromones work!  My PR consultant suggests wearing this when you need to put other people at ease, not just your lover.  Why not get the benefit of smelling fresh AND the calming effects of pheromones? Anyway, I suggest it (even though I do think the price is a bit high.)
B00RUNZ30M|3|Now that the summer heat has arrived I will try pretty much anything to help the grease ball that becomes my face so anything with the words Matte is gonna b tried. I like the color but the way it dried made me think the product could have been on the shelf for a while before shipping to me.easy lightweight with build able coverage. I will order again though.
B00KDB4BCY|3|Very classy and easy putting on
B0087669DQ|2|The size and shape are good as well as the grip, but most of the lotion gets absorbed from the applicator.
B00LQDL9ZA|5|Everything seems to be great so far, only thing I'd change is the screw to be metal rather than plastic, tends to work itself out after a while. Other than that, this kit is awesome. Well worth the amount paid!!
B00117VR1M|5|I love this fragrance.  It's clean, feminine, long-lasting and never overpowering.  It's beautifully layered so that as the day goes on, a bit of the \\"flowery\\" scent is lost, but the base is so delightful that I don't mind a bit.  The bottle is attractive too, if anyone cares about that.  :)  Five stars in my book.
B00VQHMQWG|5|In love with the way this oil makes my skin feels! I recently got a chance to review a few different brands of jojoba oil and this is definitely one of my favorites. This came in a nice size bottle and even comes with it's own glass dropper. I've noticed no smell with this one which is nice so that I don't mix too many scents while I get ready. I've been using this to moisturize my skin and it feels great. I love this so much more than using lotion as this absorbs quickly and doesn't leave me feeling greasy. I have permanently made the switch from lotion to oil after trying this and a couple other types of oils like argan and rosehip oil.<br /><br />I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.
B00RLX5X74|5|Excellent fit and adorable for for covering my hair when working outside.
B00AKLA16M|5|Good quality and very soft. Doesn't rip or tear easy and are larger then my other covers which I notice is a loose, not tight fit
B008HJRLXK|5|Prevents my hair from being pulled out.
B0000YV83O|4|I can feel my mouth and jaw muscles are really working during exercise. But it's too early to see the results yet.
B0084SDG56|5|Perfect Christmas present for my mother-in-law! She  totally loved it! And even better that it was a lightning deal for 50% off!
B0050ZJ24U|5|This is a clean fresh smell. This fragrance never gets old or out of style.. The scent is refreshing.. I love that it is an oil, it last longer than a perfume
B0012X6O4U|5|The best holding hairspray ever.
B000C235OE|5|What can I say?... it's polo at a great price... My wife loves it!...
B00373HS7K|5|Love it! The brush is so soft, perfect for compact or loose powder. Does the job great and sets flawless.
B002WTC38O|3|It irritated my eyes and made my eyelid near the lash line go from red to a bruised purple. It did make my eyelashes a bit longer but I stopped using it after a couple of weeks because of the side effect which from what ive read not everyone has had or at least not sharing. So, I'm giving this product  three stars because I did see some growth in only 2 weeks and that's what it says it do.... and it did list possible side effects ^_^
B000VOLLLM|4|Great stocking stuffer for 10 year-old son.  He loved the bottle and cologne smelled very nice.  This was a great purchase.
B0000531M9|5|I wish I could get more
B00021B3VM|5|I first bought this a year ago because I thought the color, Gerbera, was so pretty.  After I bought it, I thought I made a stupid mistake because it felt sticky and I thought it would be too heavy and greasy for my skin.<br /><br />But I tried it anyway, and was very pleasantly surprised.  It doesn't feel at all heavy or greasy when on my face.  The color is beautiful and is buildable.  Gerbera gives a nice, flushed look.  It seems to last a long time, also.<br /><br />I've tried it on my lips - but I think it's best as a blush.  The color is only good for summer, and then I have to go through a process of putting lip primer on first and then clear gloss over top to get a look I like.  (That's too complicated for me, I just like to swipe and go.)<br /><br />I live in the Czech Republic, and it's not available here.  When I visit my parents in the States in May, I'll be stocking up and maybe trying another color as well.  I tried using my old powder blush again, and I almost immediately wiped it off and went back to this blush.
B00QZ67O6G|5|This is my second sonicare of this model, after my first one finally died after almost 6 years of use.  This is a great toothbrush, and I can't recommend it enough.
B00K5RZIKA|5|love it great tool for your brush collection
B00HRIH8LW|5|Ship was fast and product live up to its standards.
B00IRKGNR4|1|Don't like
B00DG1B6V2|5|this stuff really works. I defiantly saw and felt a difference in my skin in a week. It's worth the investment
B001UE7D32|5|Perfect for travelling.
B002ULA304|5|I got this brush primarily to do push liner and I'm very happy with it. The bristles are nice and thin, stiff but soft enough not to hurt your eyes. I use this with dark eyeshadows, gel liner, and even with a pencil liner which otherwise applies too thick and smudges. It works well on the lower lashline and eyebrows too. It offers great precision, you can start your liner thin then build it up and easily wing it out. Highly recommended for the quality and value.
B003CTTZQQ|5|I REALLY LOVE THIS STUFF,, NOW I NEED TO JUST USE IT MORE LOL
B0088H1XWG|3|I'm still undecided, not because it doesn't do what it says, but because I'm not a fan of<br />stiff hair. I like, and I don't. Really tough call.
B00017XYNM|2|While this perfume smells good, the scent disappears after less than an hour. The authentic J'Adore Eau De Parume last all day. Unfortunately, this item is non-returnable, so I wasted my money.
B00028M3N2|4|While I tend use higher quality brands of essential oils for most uses, I got this for diffusing and using in my laundry.  The price was very good, and I was actually pleasantly surprised by the quality of the essential oil.  Only caveat with the 4oz size, at least, is that it comes without a dropper/dispenser insert, so pouring is kind of messy.
B001OMI93S|5|Love it!  Irritation free, long wearing lightweight moisture . This is the perfect night cream - from a brand you trust for a price that makes you comfortable.
B00SH46VR2|5|My teenager daughter says this is helping with her facial issues. I'm sure we will reorder.
B003STQ25C|4|This is a good bronzer, it;s rich and pigmented<br />I would recomend this product.also nice color<br />Got to be careful with the powder alot comes out on hr brush.
B00FOH4RN0|5|Cute
B00W8H0BR0|5|These beauty sponges are very popular in Japan and Korea.  They are made of natural, edible konjac corm fibers and charcoal made from bamboo.<br /><br />The small sponge is shaped like a river stone and is very hard until soaked in warm water and then it becomes luxuriously soft and slightly gelatinous.<br /><br />After bathing, use the rounded side to slowly massage the face to both gently exfoliate and hydrate the skin.  It is not necessary to rinse the skin afterwards.  This treatment is a very relaxing experience.<br /><br />The sponge itself should be carefully rinsed after use and then allowed to thoroughly dry.  It has a loop of string attached for hanging.<br /><br />Mayberry Health and Home provided a sponge for evaluation and review.
B0053MNL5G|4|Great, this is what I expected even though it does not look like the picture at all.<br />But an African told me its the right black soap.
B000NLJFNY|3|I got this last week I have washed my hair three times sometimes more with it.<br />I have switched up to this only so it works, so far nothing dramatic at all. It does smell<br />great, makes my hair feel healthy, shiny, tangle free, but length? Not too sure. I won't<br />suggest it just yet...I will send another review in maybe a month or when there's a change!
B00ANLG42O|3|They are not the ones on the picture. These are an off white color and not squared like in the picture. Took very long to get here.
B00KZHP1GG|2|It was very noisy and seemed poorly constructed. I returned it.
B000JNQSIQ|5|Used it once and it worked perfect.
B000NDME6C|5|I used to smoke a pack a day, Ive never done well in school because of attention and energy issues, and I rarely ever exercised, I never really understood how everyone else did so well. I started taking this stuff once a day, or every other day. Three years later Ive been riding about 10-15 miles a day, and up to 50 miles in one day on my road bike, I can run about 9-10 miles, I have not smoked a single puff in over two years, and Ive been making solid straight A's and almost have my batchelors, going for a masters or higher. I literally feel like a completely new, better person. Careful coming off of it though, it can make you itchy. You are what you eat folks, plain and simple.<br /><br />Ps. Ive tried other cheaper superfoods, to save money, none of them work like green vibrance.
B008RYY8S6|4|good
B0086ULJF6|5|This is one of two Sleek eye shadow palettes in my daily essentials makeup bag. The other one is Ultra Mattes V2 Darks Palette. It includes highlight, mid-shade, crease shade, eyeliner, and even brow-filling colors. I need nothing else for my eye area except concealer and mascara. The colors are saturated, blend well, and not sparkly or chalky. My lids are oily, so I have to use a primer to make any eye makeup stay put. I wish this brand were sold in the USA.
B000JS0X64|5|recieved it
B006UET9A2|4|The product itself is awesome.  I really love the way it holds my brows in place, and it comes in many colors to match most brows.<br /><br />My product is older, and it appears that some people have purchased a newer design that has been improved.  This review is for my older product.<br /><br />Like the majority of the reviewers stated, the problem occurs when the presharpened end is used up.  It appears that it would twist, and it doesn't.  It has a plastic casing so sharpening seems really stupid.  There are no instructions explaining what you should do when the tip runs out.  I'm not sure what Maybelline was thinking when they designed this product.  Clearly, they had to know that anyone purchasing it was going to have a problem.<br /><br />I did get around the problem, because I loved the product, and wasting my money was not an option for me.  Remove the brush on the end and the cap underneath that.  I used my teeth, although you may want to use a tool.  At this point, I was just so frustrated.  Now you can use a Q-Tip to push the liner up.  Replace the brush, and you're good to go.  I just threw away the white cap.
B001CT09UE|5|thanks
B004Y9GY44|4|When I first got it, it was difficult to get it open and it took a while to get some product to come out. It's easy to get too much on the applicator.<br />When I finally did manage to try it, I really did like this concealer. It's creamy and blends out very smoothly. It hardly ever creases on me.<br />The concealer is VERY brightening. I would not use it by itself. I use another more yellow toned concealer on top of it (Maybelline Fit Me) just so that it isn't super duper bright. I like a more natural look, so I don't want my concealer looking too obvious.<br />Overall I really like this product.
B007K6K0IY|5|I was given the opportunity to try Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant for free courtesy of Secret, and really liked how it performed. It really does protect you all day, and is especially perfect for the hot summer months. Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant goes on clear, eliminating potential white marks from ending up on your clothes. You also feel clean and dry while wearing Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant. It's perfect for long days at the beach, being outdoors or just being active throughout the day. I would definitely recommend Secret Outlast® Clear Gel Deodorant to anyone who wants a fresh smelling, lightweight deodorant that actually performs.
B000NPBPTC|5|I may be the first person on earth to be disappointed by an &#34;age reducing&#34; product that actually worked, but... I kind of am.<br /><br />A couple years ago, my dermatologist made it quite clear I should be using a moisturizer with SPF every single day. Since then, I've tried a variety, and none of them really blew me away with astoundingly better skin. (And a whole bunch joined a heap of rejects for being too greasy, too gritty, too smelly...) I finally picked up the Vita Lift a couple weeks ago when it was the only thing Target had in stock. And I'm in love.<br /><br />Not only does it soak in smoothly and undetectably, but it doesn't make me more greasy, it doesn't feel like I'm wearing anything, and those anti-aging ingredients? They work. The lines on my forehead are a whole bunch lighter, which is great. And all but my deepest crow's feet have entirely disappeared -- which is kind of disappointing because I actually liked the character they added. Who doesn't want people to know they laugh and smile a lot, right? But for better or worse, they're gone, and all it took was a product that's ten bucks at a brick-and-mortar.
B00BOJTURK|3|I wanted largest size in spray. It was not available if it had been would give this cologne  5 stars!!
B0000DJEJP|5|Very good, long lasting blades
B000P22VS2|5|love it
B001G8XU0M|5|I bought this fragrance because some people said it smelled like Aventus. It doesn't.  However, it is a very nice smelling fragrance that I really started liking the more I wore it.  I got a lot of compliments when I wore it and it seemed to last forever.  Buy &#34;Fresco&#34; by Ilum Dean if you want a fragrance that really smells like Aventus.
B00DP43V22|5|this hair thickening cream is fabulous for fine thinning hair like mine..it is not sticky, has a nice fragrance, and lasts a long time....price on Amazon too high, however, because drugstore.com has it for $13.00.
B00AR2JENA|2|Smaller the I expected.
B00DE1OJPO|2|Thin, watery, texture. I did NOT like this lotion at all. I only gave it a second star because when I added body oil to it, it was okay.
B00JRDESF4|4|Nice makeup brush bag, but I really only need a bag half this size when I travel.  Do women really have this many brushes??!  I have a couple of brushes that are dual-ended, so I have to be very careful when I slide them into the pockets as it can fray the brush hairs.  Otherwise, it's a nice pouch for taking your brushes with you, but I wouldn't use it for everyday storage.  I have a Caboodles case for that and it works very well for everyday use.
B00FZKB51S|2|Wish I could go gaga the way others have, but all the fluffy brushes are way too soft and a chunk of bristles from the blush brush fell out immediately.  And I mean a chunk, not one, two, ten, but the brush is ruined even though I never used it.  A couple of the shadow and contour brushes are great, but overall I wouldn't recommend these or buy them again.
B005OU4J6C|4|I decided to try this BB cream after seeing a review of different BB creams.  I do have pretty light skin but I have rosacea so I'm always looking for something to cover the red.  I have to say this does the trick! My only complaint is that it has a pretty strong fragrance.
B001KYPZ4G|4|Good, does its job..wayy easier and sensitive on the skin than shaving, but make sure you follow directions and not leave it on for more than 10mins. Leaves skin feeling very smooth and soft, and hair growth seems to be slower in comparison to shaving.
B004WIUNCG|3|It doesn't work quite as well as I had hoped, I have owned other Braun grooming items in the past that were phenomenal.  This one doesn't quite hit that mark
B003DKU3CY|1|it says &#34;no damage&#34; to your hair, but it really demaged mine.
B00CJQFUUI|5|Love this color. I get many compliments when I wear this..It is thin so, 3 coats is perfect. It also chips easy, but I love it.
B000KEIO7C|4|hmm i thought it would be a bit different but i'm happy with it. the best part is that sephora has it for 15 dollars and i got it here for $11 so thats a plus!! although my previous hand moisturizer was aloe vera lotion by triple lanolin and was great! it  was even a fraction of the price. I might purchase again because it leaves your hands moisturized but a little sticky for like 10 seconds (literally, nothing to much though) but like it ! It leaves my hands nice, soft, and lightly scented 4 stars it is because its just too pricy for its performance.
B004W5M0ZC|5|When used as directed, this stuff is amazing.  Makes my skin feel clean, super soft and just feel and look much healthier in general.  I don't use exfoliant or masks half as often now.  I got lazy and distracted for about two weeks whereas I only rubbed / massaged the product on my face for about a minute or two, and I definitely noticed diminished affect on my skin, so one really should follow instructions in order to allow this product achieve the results it promises.
B00EJFW9XS|4|ok
B003RKV01I|5|This has been my husband's favorite hair gel for many years.  got2b seems to have quit making this product, so he had me order a second 2-pack.
B003IMLAEM|5|As a licensed Esthetician I've used the Kosmea line in my practice. I was amazed to watch the Kosmea Eight Natural Wonder serum literally begin to fade a very noticeable scar on an employee's forehead from a plastic surgery she'd had years before. The scar not only regained a healthy pink color versus the pale white it had been but it smoothed out and flattened as well. She was VERY happy with the results and began to see them within only a few weeks of using this product. I highly recommend the entire Kosmea line of skincare.
B002BADJVE|4|I wanted to try a BB cream for the longest time. I decided to choose Missha because i've heard many rave reviews. I'm asian with yellow toned skin. I also suffer from occasional break outs and have acne scars on my cheeks. I've been using Everyday Minerals which I think is a great brand but I did not like the feel of it at the end of the day; felt like mud on your face. So when i received my order in #23 I tried it out and surprisingly it blended really well into my skin color. I swatched it previously on my hand and it was almost like a taupe color that didn't look like it would fit me. The smell is..interesting. People love the smell but I feel like it's too \\"perfume-y\\"; it may smell like johnson's baby oil to you but it's too strong and \\"feminine\\". The texture is creamy but not in a thick sense. It looks thick but feels smooth. There is a dewy effect that I think most people will like but for myself, being oily, I decided to set it with a mineral powder afterwards.     I give it a 4/5 because when the shipment came, the box it came in (not the bulky package, like the actual box for the product) was damaged and there were sticky hand prints all over. I almost felt like it was used/touched a lot before sent. The product itself looked decent enough and nothing seemed to have squirted out of it.
B00D8A44Y2|4|Good
B00070E8LA|5|Some people have complained that this clipper gets hot. I found that too until I used the blade wash to remove the protective grease it's shipped with. Now it runs, gives great results and is a joy to use, though it does take a little practice to get good with it. Do get the Oster cutting attachments, but ignore the instructions about putting them on while the clipper is running. It's not only noy necessary, it's much harder to do. They go on just fine with the clipper turned off.
B00WFQ74RY|5|I like my new lip balm.  It was a basic clear chapstick, and I received the second one from the left (brown hair, pale pink robe and tan-color base).  It does last a while, I've had it for a month or two and there's mostly all of it left.  You do have to apply quite often, but it's worth the money, because it is very moisturizing and the smell is subtle but pleasant.  If you did not notice, they do send you a random lip balm design.
B0092BWWG8|3|Love the idea, but not as bright as I would have hoped. Helps to use a razor/scissors to cut/scratch up the top to make it brighter.
B003BM15U8|1|THIS IS THE SECOND TIME I'VE PURCHASED MOROCCANOIL ON AMAZON AND THE SECOND TIME I'VE RECEIVED A FAKE PRODUCT IN THE MAIL. The first time I bought from a new seller with no feedback, understandable that I would receive a counterfeit version. The second time I purchased from a guaranteed seller (Beauty Schools of America Online), thought I was safe, and ended up with fake product AGAIN. Compared to my salon-bought oil, Beauty Schools of America Online's bottle is slightly shorter with more pointed edges. There are small differences on the packaging. The oil is also a lighter color, smells different, and more importantly leaves my hair dull and looking like i'm having a bad hair day. Baby oil will do that.  From a new and unpredictable seller I could understand an outcome like this, but from an Amazon guaranteed seller? Ridiculous. This is bad business, highly unprofessional, and it creates bad customer experiences and bad word-of-mouth. Shame on both of you.
B00ACN0O1A|1|after a normal use (twice a day) of two month, its battery won't hold charge any more. We just ordered two replacement brush head :(
B000E7WI72|5|My daughter loves J Lo's Still and just got Glo from another relative for Christmas.  The fragrances are very different but still manage to smell lovely on my daughter.
B0000AFUTL|5|I installed this mirror to make it easier for me to braid my hair.  I love it.  It doesn't seem like the most sturdy construction but has already lasted a year with regular use and no problems.
B00147FGJ8|5|This lotion is really good for such a low price... I just used this lotion today for the first time and I was pretty impressed with the results. I wasn't expecting much because I have a lot of better lotions and this one was only $15 but I was noticeably darker after tanning with this today. I'll definitely buy another bottle when I'm finished with my first bottle
B000GLRREU|2|I'm not sure what happened here, but while it was great for the 6 months it worked... I just can't give this more than 2 stars given how long it lasted.  I might try getting another one, gambling that I just had bad luck (since it seems the manufacturer support in these instances is a complete waste of time), but not sure yet.  I'm glad I didn't buy a long term supply of replacement pick heads, that's for sure.  I read the instructions and it claims there is \\"no maintenance required\\" (which I found a bit odd and too good to be true), so I don't know what could be going on. Now when I turn it on it just sits- no sounds, nothing.
B00DL5FCHC|1|Not at all!! I receive a total different product, not the one it was on the pic! Worst experience ever just a waste of money
B002IZ8SAY|5|I so love this product!  Again, it arrived quickly, the price was right.  I have recommended this product to a lot of my friends.
B0077LAJT2|5|Bought a 100 pack about two years ago. I shave everyday with the exception of the occasional Saturday.  I change the blade on Sunday night after a week of shaves and my last shave is as good as my first. Great blades and an even greater bargain.  13 cents a week to shave isn't too shabby. I've been using a safety razor for 7-8 years and this is blade I'll use them as long as I can find them. Highly recommend.
B00OQQLNG4|5|I so love this. My skin has never looked so great. It has never felt so great either.  I thought i was going to have a bad reaction like some other products i have tried but it actually wasn't bad at all.  Now it feels as if i had a peel done.  Love it great price.
B008CCO518|4|This seemed to work well, and maybe it helped my skin heal. But it had a weird reaction. I like to mix my amazon serums sometimes, or put different oils on top of serums. When I put this serum on, then put another serum + oil on top of it, my face felt really warm, but I thought it might be in my imagination. But after another couple minutes, I decided to look in the mirror. My face had turned dark beet red like a 1st degree sunburn. I quickly washed off my face, but the redness was a true burn and stayed. I slapped a thick layer of hydrocortisone cream on my face, then took a Benadryl, then thankfully it was mostly healed by morning. But be careful. I tested the other items I used with it separately, but they weren't the burn trigger; this one was.
B0043TQKUS|5|The liquid shine is awesome. It is a great product. My hair is very dull and dry but since i started using Devinya's liquid shine everyone notices a difference. I will be a returning customer.
B00TH1VSIG|5|The backscratcher is fabulous and works perfectly.  The telescoping handle is a great feature and the 'teeth' on the scratcher are just sharp enough to do the job.  Well worth the very reasonable cost.
B00NBAKXIA|5|I was initially surprised by how small the bottle was when I received this eye gel but overall I'm very impressed with how little goes a long way!  I have used other eye gel products in the past and none clear up the darker areas under my eyes like this one!  Has a very nice scent and absorbs quickly, unlike a lot of other gels that sit on the surface of my skin.  Very impressed, smaller bottle is no issue!!!
B00GQU5YY0|5|I was very satisfied with this product. Although i am still getting used to the correct way to apply it is what i expected it to be and a great price.
B001GI0ULE|5|I have used this product over ten years, having first been introduced to it at a hair salon in Atlanta.  The lather is absolutely marvelous, and it leaves my skin silky smooth; I recommend it highly.
B0019V5E96|5|I selected this gentle version over the  max correction and I absolutely love it. It has less alcohol so its great for sensitive  and acne-prone, skin. I am in the in between stage of late acne-pre wrinkles.  I think this product is great for both wrinkles and acne.<br />To extend the life of the product, I only use half of a pad per application and I only use this product twice a week.<br />The result is a gentle exfoliation that leaves my skin glowing!<br />Gentle AND effective!
B00HFZR704|2|This oil just isn't for me. I gave it to a friend who does like it though.
B004L99SFE|4|This is a very fresh fragrance, very clean. It last and I never tire of it. My husband likes it as well.
B0056GDG90|4|Works fine. I really dislike the power switch. It's difficult to get to high heat without going to the cool air. The power switch seriously sucks
B000FS05VG|1|I dry my hair inffrequently, maybe couple of times a months. Bought this in may last year and it just stopped working completely. Just wont turn on. Its cheap, so I guess you  get what you pay for, but still...
B00I531Q7U|4|Would give it 5 stars for the product.  But the tube is so hard to squeeze it is almost impossible to get it out.  Keeps lips moist and soft.  I put it on at bedtime and it is still on in the morning.  Even though I like the product, I do not know if I will reorder, since it is such a struggle to get out.
B005TT8RPM|5|WOW!!!!<br />This oil smells amazing!!!! I started to swoon when I got a whiff of this oil!!<br />I frequent on Fragrantica and some reviews said it smelled like lemons but when I first smelled this,I didn't pick up lemons,till now.<br />It's sweet but not sickeningly sweet. It's supposed to be unisex but  it's way too feminine.<br />It's also musky on the drydown.<br />It's just a sexy,sweet,floral,musky,gouramond. That's the best way I can describe it and I def recommended it :)
B004U28JRA|4|Surprisingly hard to find item in the dead of winter, except on amazon.com!<br />Unit is bigger than I thought, but really only holds 1 towel. Does not fit on the back of the toilet like I'd hoped for a small bathroom. I preheat before I start the shower because it takes longer to heat than I take to shower most mornings. Sometimes do two cycles. Don't roll the towel, but fold and wrap with most contact of towel and container.<br />Doesn't get uniformly hot, like fresh-out-of-the-dryer feeling, but better than a towel bar warmer that only warms the part that contacts the towel.<br />Safety wise, if you have kids, this is a safe product that gets warm, not hot, and sturdy for use.
B000Z85RY6|5|This is a GORGEOUS color. It works really well on my very pale skin. It dries quickly and looks ok with just one coat if you're in a rush.
B0002G214U|1|The bonnet is way too small. I barely got it on over my hair rollers and I was using only medium size rollers. When the hot air was blowing into the bonnet it only blew up the bonnet within the first couple of inches from where it entered the bonnet, the hot air did not go into the rest of the bonnet. I returned the bonnet hair dryer.
B000127VYU|5|Great fragrance!  Love it.
B0076J9RZW|5|This bath size bars are an excellent choice. They have the perfect size and you can control how much of it you will every time.
B00PI6GHXK|5|Smells great, and shipped earlier than expected
B00912CL5K|3|Thank you, I received my item and it as pretty and I was happy :)
B001FWXIC4|1|Came without a box. Does not compare favorably to the 'real thing'. The color is not the same and neither us the smell. It's a rip off.
B00D3G6JAS|5|I have been using this product for the past several years, approximately once every 12 to 18 months. I have actually had people stop me on the street asking what I use to keep my teeth so white. A great product!
B00KB4EQOG|3|Delivered as promised. This rating is for the product which didnt do much for my roots because they became puffy once humidity hit.
B004WSXD4G|2|Nobebefits
B004VFXVJW|5|I bought this item for someone who enjoys shaving in the shower.  The last shower mirror began falling off the wall within a week of purchase.  The clip system on the Shave Well mirror is holding fast, with no slippage.  In addition, the mirror, although small, is perfectly sized and does not fog up at all.  He is very happy and smoothly shaved!
B003OXT3OY|4|it does weigh a little bit heavy but nice and sturdy very comfortable... could be a little more sharp and polished :)
B00HZ7IRTW|5|Good stuff
B007RTR8UM|5|As stated with the shampoo review, these two products used together do seem to create some additional fullness of my fine hair even with the hard water here.  Again, the fragrance is pleasantly mild and I've not experienced the usual itching and/or burning with a fragranced product.  Time will tell, but I think these two are going to meet the manufacturer's claims.  Both bottles have a substantial flat base with opening end down to enable using those last few drops, and they are not going to be falling over with the slightest hit of water from the shower head.  These are products I will continue to use if they live up to claims.  Thanks!
B004GYU7GI|5|I love this conditioner, the texture is light and it really moisturizes the hair.  I have less breakage and there is new growth.  This is a great companion to my shampoo.  And even though it contains garlic there is no garlic smell.  The scent is wonderful, it is a must have and I will be reordering soon.
B005PUZZR8|5|Replacement for 10 year old Remington. Love it! Cuts great, very powerful, stayed charged for over three weeks before first recharge.
B001JYBTBA|4|My husband used Clubman shave foam for years, but it has been discontinued for quite a while. Fortunately I found Proraso shave foam at Target because he doesn't like gels, creams or even the Gillette or Barbasol foams. Proraso is the closest thing he has found to Clubman. After Target stopped carrying Proraso, I was so glad to find it on Amazon.
B003VP1EFG|5|LOVE IT
B004COB59A|5|I don't Usually Comment  on Product but ..Hair zone got me one .. i really felt a lot change about my hair lose i am using this product 1 month now i don't see the hair that use to make my sink full anymore and i am sure it will help anybody who have the same problem that i have ..to me hairzone is more effective and solution to my hair lose  ...
B0012DL8B4|5|ok
B00IQMRHP0|3|It was not white! Was totally gray
B008J2BS3O|5|It is the best shampoo I've tried in 50 years!  No frizzies despite the most humid conditions even in the tropics.
B00SOXI584|2|The size of the bar is awkwardly large. Stick with the normal sized soap.
B0106BGPW4|3|I opened the first one and the whole thing came apart including the sping  I have it back together  but every now  and then it comes apart .. I have used this product  for years now  and wont quit cause of this little malfunction.
B001KWB85S|5|Love this red shows up great  works well would definitely recommend I Love konad got here on time as well
B00827ILWM|1|I received this as a Christmas present from wife.  My beard/body hair trimmer had recently broken after 4 years of use, so this was to replace it and use to cut hair.  I put a battery in the trimmer and it broke immediately upon getting some hair into it.  I am familiar with the Wahl brand as a quality product, but am surprised this has its name on it.  I would keep looking at other cutters/trimmers.
B001E96PM8|5|Incredibly good deal, received the products fast and am still using them even after daily use!  It works wonderfully definitely shower to shower.
B003V21WO2|1|Bad trade mark it damaged second time I used it.
B00CC7Y0G4|5|good.
B000MW8G5C|2|couldn't wrap it enough to keep it in my hair. too expensive for what I got.
B000FJ4AWK|1|I thought I was getting a &#34;hard rubber&#34; comb. Hard plastic is not the same as hard rubber!!! Product description was not clear! I put in an internet search for a hard rubber comb!!
B003AKZCPU|2|After only about 4 uses, the one of the nipper handles broke cleanly where the cutting edges hinge.  I was underwhelmed before the break-- not that easy to control, particularly 'other handed', unlike conventional clippers.  Give this a pass.<br /><br />Seki will honor its guarantee, and another nipper is on its way-- but I'm still not sure it works all that well...<br /><br />Update.  New clippers have arrived, and while they are an industrial work of art, I'm not getting any better at using them.  I've pretty much gone back to conventional right-angle nippers.
B0074OLDLK|5|The girlfriend adores it so I love it as well
B003E7UNE4|4|I just bought this product last week. I have only used it to lay down my edges for my rod/roller sets. The hold is firm, but it doesn't make my hair unusually hard, crunchy, dry or brittle like other gels. And I like that this gel has no alcohol, which isn't good for the hair.<br /><br />After a few days, the gel does show a little white flaking and build up, but I think most gels do.<br /><br />I haven't tried this gel yet to set my curls with rollers, but I do plan to try it since other reviewers have claimed that it works well with rods/rollers.<br /><br />I think this is the ONLY gel I will ever use from now on.
B00164FKWW|5|I've Been using this BP since 2010, it really does work but you just need to follow the regime so precisely. And you will see results :)<br />I've had acne for 10 years across my face and body it's been a nightmare, this has been a miracle for me<br />The only downside is the dryness it causes, it really can make your skin appear older because of the elasticity it looses.
B0054MSCI6|5|Love it!  I put this on my hair once a week. Sometimes use a disposable shower cap and leave it on overnight--this is the best.  My hair is super soft for the rest of the week.  My stylist often comments on how great my hair feels and looks. She has had others touch my hair and they have &#34;oohed and awed.&#34;  I'm rough on my hair, so try to do what I can to help it.  I dry it, straighten it, color it, ugh.  This product keeps my locks happy.
B0018QHXOG|5|Have used product before, so, nothing different.  The good part was finding it.  It's been discontinued by Cover Girl. The best part---the price!! Super value.
B00L1I1V3U|4|I received the product I am reviewing as a try it product from Bzz Agent. I like it, but not as much as the regular one I buy. Tube is smaller and you need to use a bit more of it than normal. It is not as easy to squeeze out. No taste which is okay. Biggest question is this, would I buy it. Probably not. Prefer the other types Fixodent makes.
B0001Z97L2|5|My dermatologist recommended this product to me. Sure -- it cost $40 through her office. But when I used it, I actually got compliments on how good my skin looked! Costs a lot, but it lasts for months -- you only need a very small amount. Amazon's price is much more reasonable AND more convenient than trying to get to the doctor's office for a refill.
B00BJRTCYS|4|This product totally works. You have to use it properly to avoid making your hair white, but if used properly it will save you time from having to wash your hair every single day, which is especially good for those with keratin treatments.<br /><br />I'm not giving it five stars because it's super expensive and the bottle seems like it's half empty when you buy it -- and it goes fast! I look forward to when another company makes an equally effective product for less money per use. But to date I haven't found anything that works this well.
B000817ZJK|5|This product worked well for the whole family.  It seemed to reduce symptoms and speed the healing process.  Normally, natural remedies taste nasty.  This one is easy on the palate.
B000WOU3I8|5|I've been using these for 5+ years and glad that Amazon has them as part of Subscribe & Save program. It works very well to remove mascara and eye shadow, and does a clean job of erasing foundation from your skin. It does leave a little oily residue, so I do rinse my face in cold water afterwards. Only negative (not going to deduct a start for this) is the packaging. Once half the towelettes are used, I have to make sure that the closing flap is tightly sealed so that it doesn't dry out. I usually invert it so that the closing flap is faced down.
B000W8R5OY|4|I am absolutely a hair fanatic and always looking for new products to improve the texture and grown of my hair. These drops are amazing. It makes my roots feel tingling and I do see a difference in my hair texture. It is getting more thicker and more bounce. I love this . i purchased this along with the oxygenation mask, deep conditioner and the gloss for repair. These products are pricey but worth every dollar.
B008RLQLWA|5|Great price for a good product
B002VWJY8Y|2|I was disappointed in that it wasnt' the Cutex brand that I wanted.  I was<br />given a different brand.  It's ok but not what was advertised.
B000PY17PI|5|Finally, a hot air curler with a brush.  I love this product.  I need to buy another one just for a spare in case they quit making this product.  My hair is about 3'' long and it's perfect.  It wraps and stays around the brush.  Thank you Vidal Sasson!
B004Q8GYES|5|I loved it, it feel very clean, i used only once yet, it heavent broken yet, like i saw in many reviews, so far, is very good, i liked!!<br />Will replace the cleaning pads for regular cotton when i run out of the one that come whith, and see if is good too!!
B001AX0U5Q|5|This incense gave me a buzz the first time i burned it. I don't know if it was the environment or the mood i was in or what, but after a few times it went away. Sorta smells like the peace incense (buddha devotion) only not as sandalwoody. Reminds me of a campfire. Very relaxing and social.I'm almost done with the pack from last year and already ordered another one.
B00B5HRXHA|5|Absolutely love this product!!!! It has a way of making the skin look baby smooth and flawless! I have the original pallet as well and will never use another foundation for my personal kit! All my clients love it! I can not say one bad thing!  :)
B00NF2PJ7E|5|100% almond pure sweet almond moisturizing oil is awesome. I used it for the first time today and can feel the difference.  It has my body feeling smooth and glowing. I love this product.
B00DG7YJQA|5|great brush
B002AN5IPC|5|I have thin hair and this leaves it silky smooth but not weighed down.
B007M81A6Q|5|my face loves it
B00BQ4KP2C|1|These towels are thin, scratchy and stained after one use. Not worth it at all!
B000JNQSIQ|5|Works very well! Got my money back with one haircut! Been paying $11.00 per haircut at &#34;the McDonalds of haircuts&#34; can't mention the name!
B00D76IPK6|5|I was suppose to receive this brush in 2 weeks and it came in just one! I love it it blends my foundation very well its soft yet sturdy, the hits stay in place, easy to clean. A great dupe for the sigma brush
B00M4IK308|5|What can I say........I am a coconut oil addict.
B003OGPAUC|2|Boy, do I love the scent of honeysuckle.  That, combine with a love for all (well, most) things Italian, I thought this perfume would be perfect for me.  The other reviews were so positive.  But, this doesn't smell much like honeysuckle at all.  The scent isn't bad, it's just not at all what I wanted or expected.  Spend your money on a different brand.
B0056GDG90|5|My hair stylist suggested this to me after noticing breakage from my hair straightened. I have stick straight hair, but I wanted to get rid of frizz. Best thing I've ever bough for my hair. I have really baby fine blonde hair that struggles to get volume. I use this with the John Frieda spray and my hair comes to life. It's bouncy, shiny, and frizz free.
B0001TO3NA|5|I had a terrible case of PUPP rash when I was pregnant with my daughter.  My doctor said it was the 2nd worse case she'd ever seen.  Before I got my prescription steroid cream, this soap was the only thing that really seamed to help.  If I ever get pregnant again, I'll be sure to have some of this on hand, just in case!
B0054KE99O|5|I was looking for something to help control the dryness of my hair when I straighten it, because it is so curly, and this is exactly what I was looking for.
B00IK4H65A|5|great product as my wife loves it..Good  pricing as well
B003I329EG|5|I love this color. I have fair skin and dark hair and look best in pinks. This color is gorgeous and the lipstick feels great on your lips, but it's a little bit of a cooler pink than it appears in pictures. Definitely not an every-day color for me but great for getting a little dressed up!
B000Z9449Y|5|This is one of the best soap cases I've purchase, also I like that the case locks so that that soap doesn't fall out. Will recommend to others.
B004J0YHVA|1|It is not brushed nichel & the mirror magnification is distorted.  I am shipping it back.  Very disappointed!
B008O5JCG6|2|I bought this kit to try out this brand.  I mainly needed the hydrating moisturizer.  I LOVE the collagen boost (smells like fresh oranges!) and the eye cream (thick and feels great!).  But the moisturizer smells bad.  I can't stand to wear it.  I may try to return it, but I want to keep the collagen boost and eye cream.
B0009XH6OG|4|Used this twice since I received it.  Works fine but he blade gets pretty warm quickly.  this comes with guard sizes, 1/16\\", 1/8, 1/4, and 3/8; not sure if it lists the blade sizes in the description.  If you are a barber, it doesn't have a hook on the cord.  Hopefully this is the end of ingrown hair on my neck.
B007P1T7JC|4|Shaves good, nice to be able to use as cord or corded.  Also easy to clean. Good price, arrived quickly
B000F4EMP0|1|Glad I read the new reviews before making a purchase...I used to use Nioxin years ago and was looking at getting it again after a few years of not using it (having tried Keranique with sad results). Proctor & Gamble needs to bring back the original formula, I won't be wasting my money on this until it changes back...
B005J6FGUE|5|This foundation made my skin look flawless.  Mae-up stays on and did not irritate my skin at all.  It felt very light on the skin but gave me the flawaless coverage I wanted.
B00GAC0Y2G|5|This product is priced favorably, in view of the cost to produce it.  We would recommend it, and will inform our ophthalmologist, who prescribed it.
B002RBF1PO|5|After 40 years I recently decided to return to the shaving instrument of my youth - a double-edged safety razor.  Like many who've switched back or switch over to a DE, I was tired of the high cost of name brand disposables, and sick of the shave quality of the cheap off brands.  I did quite a bit of research about which razors work best with which beard types, and the Edwin Jagger De89lbl, along with the Merkur 4C kept coming up as a good option for me.  I leaned towards the EJ based on user reviews and comments, and the fact that the handle was a little longer than the Merkur.  But what closed it for me was the aesthetics.  The chrome is incredible and obviously of good quality, and the lined handle, while maybe only improving grip over the unlined handle model marginally, gives off a beautiful faceted shine that you have to see to believe.  It's really an heirloom quality razor at a great price.  You'll want to take care of it to ensure it's beauty and quality last.<br /><br />Oh, and it shaves beautifully too - just like so many have said.  Even a lot of DE pros with multiple razors, some of which cost several times what the De89lbl costs, consider it the best or one of the best razors they own.  I wasn't expecting much from my first shave with it, given the need to re-learn DE technique.  And my old cheap brush and soap don't provide the rich lather you see in some instructional vids.  Nonetheless, it shaved closer and more comfortably than my Bic 3-blade disposable right off the bat.  The weight and balance do the work, so no need to put pressure and dig in to get a good shave.  Can't wait to get my good Semogue brush and Proraso soap so I can really bring out it's potential!  I also ordered some sharper blades than the Derby's that are supplied, so will be anxious to see what they can do
B00ATGYBEQ|1|Totally disappointed at the polish I received. I expected it to be similar to the color of the picture provided. However it's not.. I don't wear these kinds of colors so I will be giving it away.
B00UO009HU|1|This is a great product, but this price in INSANE!!! You get a full box for 74.95 plus shipping through an actual Jeunesse web page. If you don't want to get ripped off, go to www .sweetfreshness.jeunesseglobal .com
B004EE2DJY|3|It was pretty great for a laugh, haven't opened it up yet since I kinda wanted to save it. At 6 or 7 bucks it is a little expensive for what it is.
B0037HP9OA|4|Good product. But I prefer the previous model for better results! An elegant finishing, a little bit heavy, good price.
B001CT0954|5|excelente
B009ERVUNG|5|Its fast shipping. I personally love it! I still have allot left and I used it once with allot of conditioner I recommend it &lt; 3
B006HRVFMM|3|Did't like it!
B00P00O83U|1|The shadow didn't meet my expectations at all
B0035LCWAW|3|When I was using the product, I found Ardell to be the best of the eyelash \\"growers\\".  My lashes which are short looked great after just 2 weeks.  I used the product for about 2 months.  I was always happy with how full my lashes appeared.  But that's just the problem, your lashes just appear to look fuller, they don't get fuller.  Today, months later my lashes still appear as short as they ever were. So I believe you have to go for the real prescription based product. I say that because a friend of mines lashes grew almost a 1/2 inch with the prescription based.  I tried some of the highly touted OTC ones, and they were no better.  At least Ardell's price was a keeper.  If I ever used it again, my expectations would be much lower.
B0041VH016|5|This is the best-smelling, all natural, SLS free soap I have ever tried.  There are absolutely NO harmful chemicals, just pure, all-natural ingredients that will not dry out your poor winter hands.
B008GOR6O0|1|This product is not real.  There is no such con sealer like this.  This product should be removed from shelf. Bad bad bad
B00006K14U|4|I've owned Nivea products before (aftershave balm), so was expecting a good quality product here as well. This was OK, better than OK maybe, but I was a little surprised there wasn't more &#34;grit&#34; or exfoliating substance in what is labeled a &#34;scrub.&#34; The almost-menthol scent and refreshing feeling was as good or better than the scrubbing aspects. In any case, it is what it is.
B004DK4CH0|4|My hair felt like silk after using this!!! I put it on wet and it still dried kind of frizzy. I put some more on when my hair was barely damp. Once it completely dried I just wanted to run my fingers through it. I have long, thick hair. I also think it added some shine.
B0099OAOUO|4|I spray Keratin infused Argan Oil on to the palms of my hands and lightly apply it to my hair.  My hair has bleach and this keeps the whispys down to a minimum
B00FYUZKW4|5|I've certainly developed my fair share of fine lines and wrinkles, and VITASkin Vitamin C Serum by Whole Spring is an anti-aging serum which helps to firm skin and soften fine lines and wrinkles.  I've used this serum for several days, and although my wrinkles have not disappeared, they are less noticeable, and my skin appears to be firming up.  I know my skin is softer, and I'm impressed with how quickly my skin absorbs this serum, without leaving it sticky.  I was able to purchase this serum at a discount in order to try it out and share my experience.
B0017JV7HI|5|Very, very powerful scent.  I LOVE! LOVE!LOVE it!  Great value for the cost!
B000SRTOC0|5|no rust, or problems.  does what it is made for.  it does not chip my nails.  sturdy.  very good quality.
B00DUFZYC6|5|Good stuff
B00HBSC3JA|5|My husband loves the way it cleans and conditions his beard. I love the way it smells.  Definitely will purchase again!
B00M7MOQXQ|4|Large wheel, but almost empty not as full as it shows, not even close and not with decorations it show, barely random :(
B009ZKLOWO|5|love it ... holds my very fine hair very well :)
B00005JS5C|5|This shaper/trimmer is a nice tool to use to keep things tidy. I like that it has multiple lengths, and it is also very easy to clean and use.
B000NN7FSO|2|This product has little hard something in it. It goes on rough like it has little crystals or something. It works but it does not go on your face very smooth.
B0006NXOVS|1|This was not at all what I expected---- the bristles are much too soft -- very disappointed as I bought one as a small gift for my husband as well as mine and he said the same thing! Waste of money!
B001JKRNX2|5|great product to use with adhesive of any kind..especially wig it gripper....love this product...
B00L0R8KN6|4|I will say I only bought these because I can't afford the sigma ones so I can't compare but they did arrive quicker than estimated time. However mine smelled bad. But wad wrapped well. They are dense but I would assume not as dense as sigma. They seem small to me as well don't cover much area at once. But over all they are great for the price.  You get what you pay for.  I would recommend if you can't afford the sigma set!
B00J9TE8KQ|5|very light & still seals, easier to work with than shae butter, 'very light' and not overpowering scent.
B001THWUGK|4|I got this to die my white hair because my three year old granddaughter wants pink hair and I thought that this would make her reconsider.I have been doing pink streaks and I really appreciate how gentle this product is because I started out doing the minimal time and got just a faint pink color and stepped up to using the hair dryer to get more intense shades. The directions are very clear. As I said because I was using a color on white hair and was super cautious, I ended up with a pale color at first but now I know how to increase the intensity of the color. Because it is a gel, it is not as messy to use. I like it. Not tested on animals is a bonus and it does not have a strong smell either.
B00159Y23Q|5|I hesitated about buying this product because there are some negative comments about it.  I was almost out of the product I had purchased at a mall store and decided to order it anyway.  I am glad I did as I have had absolutely no problems with it.  My favorite feature of this lotion is after applying it to my very dry skin, there is no stickiness and gooey feeling as with some lotions.  There is very little smell and does not bother my sensitivity to fragrance.
B0057TPUPY|5|Very pleased with this sunscreen product.  Best I've ever used and woks well under makeup.  Blocks sun very well.
B001G7PLBY|5|Excellent
B0091K5QQS|5|Smells great.  No oily residue in tub when finished.  Skin feels great
B000GG1944|5|I have been searching for a good protein treatment to help my breaking hair for months.  I first tried the Organics hair mayonnaise, with no success.  My hair still was weak and breaking off.  Then I tried Aphogee 2 step protein treatment, and instead of helping, I experienced even more breakage once I was through with it (and I followed the instructions to a T). After reading all the great reviews on Nexxus Emergencee, I decided to try it out.  I am so glad I did! I used it with the Nexxus humectress as advised on the box. For the first time ever, my hair felt silky, smooth, moisturized, I was able to comb my hair with a very fine tooth comb with NO hair remaining in it!! I usually get knots when I comb it while it's wet, and it keeps tangling up, not this time, the comb was just gliding right on through!! I highly recommmend this product, used in conjunction with Nexxus humectress, it truly works wonders!
B00AATHKPE|4|Good product, fast shipping.  I liked it.
B00ANR2AM6|1|Product was not moist on my lips...I would never buy this again
B000FQ73O0|2|I'm still basically bald after 6 months of greasy rubbing on my head.  My wife said she could see some short peach fuzz but that is all it ever amounted too.  Just ordered the Oster 76 and a 00000 blade to take care of the pipe dream of ever having hair.  Good luck, but I think you will meet my same fate with this product.
B001KYQABS|5|BOUGHT THIS FOR MY FACE . IT IS EXCELLANT SOAP. NOT DRYING. NOT PERFUMEY.  WOULD RECOMMEND IF LOOKING FOR A GOOD GENTLE SOAP.
B00MNRA7LU|5|I saw this on a home shopping channel and tried it.  Love it... I see the difference in a few weeks in my neck and chest.  So many women and men have wrinkles there and it shows your age.  I definitely recommend this product and will buying it again.  4 oz for this price is so worth it.. I'm sold and have tried many products!
B0051E36HY|5|great
B00I32AN4K|5|My wife started using this last week and its worked wonders on her hair.  Her hair is much softer and healthier looking.  The only thing she's changed is using this about 1-2 times per week.
B003G1I4WG|4|This product smells great and I've recieved many compliments on it! I recommend to anyone looking for a good cologne.
B0047HGD4E|3|I like this sauna it works well and it's easy to use . The only thing is that u have to use it for at least 20-30 min to see your full pores open but my neck hurts just bending over . But if u have patients get it. I don't mind the wait because it does work and the price is great. You just have to be patient with this product. The steam comes out in few seconds so that's great.
B00ZPT5RJ0|2|I tend to wear liquid to matte lipstick that lasts all day.  I loved the color of this Covergirl lipstick, but it doesn't stay on as well as expected.  Don't get me wrong, it stays on, but I frequently need to reapply.  I am a little disappointed because I thought this was going to be great.  I am glad I did not pay for it and it came with my #voxbox.
B000XPB60U|5|Update: Another consumer was awesome and contacted Now Foods to find out the RDA levels (as it's not indicated on the packaging). According to the user, Now Foods indicated that the RDA Value is 85 for those concerned about abrasion. Thanks again S. Ghosh ;-)<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I normally rely on Young Living toothpaste now (me and my younger son are fans of their thieves toothpaste), but we recently ran out and Young Living has all of their toothpastes out of stock...sooo, I decided to try this stuff and I must admit, I LOOOOOVVVEEE IT! This stuff actually makes my mouth feel like I'm using \\"normal\\" toothpaste (those that use \\"natural\\" toothpastes know what I mean). Out of all of the natural toothpastes that I've tried, this actually makes my mouth feel super clean. It it even foams (which is rare for a natural toothpaste). My tongue even looks great and it does well with my coffee stained teeth/tongue in the morning. Further proof--an unsightly blackhead turned white pus-filled pimple that's been lingering for a few weeks now. After I squeezed all the yucky goo out, I applied this toothpaste and it FINALLY seems to be healing. I'm a Now Foods fan (I use a ton of their products), but this one is definitely up on my top ten list. I'm still gonna try some Squiggle's that I bought to help with my gums (I have sensitive teeth caused by receding gum lines) but I'm most likely gonna stay with this toothpaste even if my YL comes back in stock.
B00006FRW9|5|Great gentle, yet effective cleanser.  It is important if your skin is inflamed to give it a good thorough gentle cleaning, and this does the job beautifully!
B00H9A40R8|5|very good
B001GGMQXG|5|Love it I can never find this perfume at any stores anywhere. So I was extremely excited to see it here :)
B002TSA934|5|Love the smell of this body wash. Leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth.
B00RC6D6VA|5|Bottles I ordered came on time and look nice. I haven't filled them yet but I am pleased so far .
B004MBJHVQ|5|I bought this last winter. (It's now this winter). And it lasted and still works great. After a couple uses my chapped lips were gone. It's minty yeah. But that's better then cherry or bubble gum. The flat shape of it makes it fit in your pocket perfectly. Ad long as its around this will me my chap stick. Boom!
B004VJ7DG0|5|I hear lot's of people say that they use A&D for tattoo care.  That may be fine, but what about keeping your skin clean right after it's been irritated from getting ink'd?  That is where this kit is awesome.  The foam soap is very gentle on mine/your skin.  The cream is not goopy nor greasy.  It absorbs nicely into your skin, keeping one's tattoo moist while not clogging your pores.  I use the foam lock in stuff before I go to bed.<br /><br />The folks at H2Ocean are great too.  I called them to get some after are tips, they were helpful.  I wouldn't use anything else for my tattoo care.
B0084JNI4E|5|I love this stuff but it is hard to find. It is light, doesn't weigh my hair down, keeps away the frizz, my hair stays soft not crunchy!!!! Love it!!! BEST MOUSSE EVER!
B00198XSG0|5|works great for home wax and hair removal
B002BU665K|5|Excellent tweezers!  you get what you pay for - these are much better than the less expensive brand, don't know why but they just are - can tweeze smaller things and hold them better
B008U12YV4|4|It's a very handy size and perfect for the short distance I travel once a month. The sturdy fabric wipes easily.
B007JLL9J4|5|Works well. Fast delivery
B007IZZ2KS|3|I bought this based on price and ratings but i am not sure if it did work or not,,,, i wanted my hair pin straight. My hair is soft and long and wvy and i did alot of things to it so its pretty damaged,,, i purchased this product baed on the ratings and i don't think i got what i was looking for which is pin straight hair,, it just feels softer but less frizziness and i also apply yuko phi ten bella treatment which makes it soooooo soft and alot less frizzy with no sticky or greasy touch,,, its not a blowout treatment or a real brazilian keratin,, i guess i like it coz my hair stayed natural looking ,,, i would give it a 4 star i guess just for me<br /><br />Update: this is the third time i do it and this time i left the straightener a few more seconds and more passes so i got a wonderful result that am so happy with, i still have a few more times in the bottle,, this is actually quite good and i started liking it
B005X6M7JS|5|I was hesitant to purchase this at first because it is a bit pricey, but I thought about it as an investment. You see, if you take good care of your skin, no scars (from pimples) will surface on your skin, that way you dont need to get other treatments to treat all the scars. In the long run, this will cost you less. Like they say prevention is better than cure, so I decided to finally give it a try, and Im glad I did! Im really really glad I did!!!!!!<br /><br />I received this package 2 days ago. I was trying to zap my pimples but I just get a steady red light indicator so I decided Ill charge it overnight. The following morning, I used it to zap my zits and one cystic pimple on my cheek. This cystic pimple has a lump that is very hard to go away, sometimes its there for months - same spot, all the time, so I zapped this cystic pimple too! I tried it again in the evening and boy I noticed the cystic pimple/lump went away!! I cant feel the lump on my cheek anymore!<br /><br />I always get zits everytime I use makeup, mmmmnnn... I wonder if I can now use makeup and not have zits now that I have this wonderful device!this i dont know yet....we'll see..but for now, im so impressed! Even thinking about buying their tanda rejuvenation gizmo over Tria Laser, has anyone tried the tanda rejuvenation set? Does it work for you?
B001GIOVXW|5|Though it does not foam, it is NOT watery. I've ordered this product a few times with no disappointment. My 4 y/o loves it. We didn't buy it for the fluoride/everything free aspects. My son disliked all of the mainstream toothpastes that we bought. This is the only toothpaste he has never complained about.
B00LLMB3W0|5|This mascara did wonders for me! The were noticed by many people and I wear them as often as I can! I recommend this to everyone that needs some new mascara!
B00A3LVMMQ|5|This stand fits my Merkur 180 and Escali brush perfectly. It feels like it's solidly built, and I expect it to last a good while.
B0011DMYMC|5|I use this everyday. I have acid reflux. I use this(about 3/4 cap full), along with 1 Tablespoon Psyllium Husks Powder and about 1/4 cup apple juice. This is a great help.
B002MZ8BK2|4|The two sizes on the stamper is very useful/helpful, but the scraper damages the plates - just use an old credit card instead.
B0006BDRE4|5|I love this product!!! I use it on my lips,also on cracked ,dry hands,and also dry/calloused feet!!! It works wonderfully and love the subtle scent!!!  Wish they made it in a larger container!!! Thank you!!!
B001ET76Y4|5|great product
B003K5B05Q|5|Simply put ! The best !  No other cream leaves your skin soft and protected and matt.  INgredients list is top notch !
B001MA0QY2|5|Love it!
B00OHXPMCM|5|i like the feel of the moisturizer and that it absorbs quickly.  i live in the northeast so i'll be anxious to see how it is in the winter.  i only use it once a day so it took longer to see a change
B00GBZCK7O|4|These were a really good deal, considering how many I got, but they are for kids not babies, unless your baby has a huge head. They are really bright as well so if you want something not so bright theses are not for you. That being said, they are sturdy, and fit my 5 year old great!
B00JX133OW|1|Get what you pay for. Very flimsy.
B00J97OA10|5|Worked perfectly for my daughter's Halloween costume.
B00E4MNQ24|5|very effective cleansing cream
B0009W7MKU|1|Great toothbrush but can't replace the brushes and will not buy another one!!!  Would give it zero stars if possible.
B000BFM37M|5|I bought both my mom and I each a tube of this wonderful rose scented lotion during our mother - daughter trip to Ireland in 2011. Now it is my go to gift for my mom. It immediately brings memories of our amazing Ireland adventure and her eyes water with joy! :) Its like a song that places you in a moment in time. I must admit, that each time I purchase one for her... I purchase one for myself as well!
B0095IMNI0|5|Great deal
B0012OQEOY|5|Works great and a great price.  Best foot massager in my view and great for plantar fascitis.
B007UVAHZ0|5|I've used Pronamel pretty consistently for a while and it really had seemed to give my teeth some of their strength back. I have soft enamel which leads to problems, but I have had less problems worth consistent use.
B006L2137U|5|super nongreasy easily absorbed sunscreen. I actually dont use it as a moisturizer but a sunscreen over my regular moisturizer
B000OO2PC8|2|I used this device maybe five times.  The first couple times I noticed the scent was strong for about an hour, then it faded quickly.  The last couple times I used it I barely noticed the scent at all.  I'm disappointed.  I had hoped for a continuous, light scent throughout the day.  This device did not provide that.  Perhaps I'm using it wrong.
B007200GAA|5|Most all natural bubbles do not give you a good amount of bubbles.  This smelled great and produced lots of bubbles that lasted a long time.
B007RYVFC4|5|This is a great product and I would highly recommend for anyone especially men that travel.  There is nothing worse than having to fly long distances and have to walk into a meeting right after a long flight and feeling funky.  With this Cool Wave by Gillette you will never have to worry about that again.  The idea of this lasting 48 hours seemed absurd to me but seeing strong it is going after 24 hours of travel and meetings and waking up the next day and feeling fresh says a lot.
B000PNTQW0|2|It really didn't work, I didn't see any changes and I used it multiply times as suggested yet the spot on my leg looked the same.
B000S8HK48|5|This product arrived a day before it was expected, which was a nice surprise. It is well made, works well, and makes my hair nice and silky. The seller included a buffer as a free gift. The only thing is that it was supposed to come with a heat resistant bag and it didn't. I contacted the seller and was told that I would be sent the heat resistant bag immediately at no charge. Would buy from this seller again.
B0036WTV2C|5|This is my third.  I love them so much, although I have to keep re-purchasing because I somehow lose them.  Make sure to soak after each use with a denture tablet to keep fresh. It fits my small mouth.
B0009ET8AA|5|After I read that the FDA has no studies showing conventional sunscreen prevents skin cancer, I decided to go the natural route. My husband has had basal cell skin cancer and won't go in the sun without something. He is a fishing guide and uses this while fishing because it isn't greasy and it isn't smelly.  We used this product on our April vacation to Cozumel, too. It worked wonderfully. It makes me feel good to know what we are putting on our skin to reduce sun damage doesn't cause cancer.
B0045L7CNS|5|I feel in love with this flowery sent when I was killing time in Heathrow airport and had to buy some more since I was using it so much. Shipped out on time and in great condition.
B006VDXFYS|5|Great product, love it!
B00MGVUKWY|5|Makes my skin smooth, and fine wrinkles disappear.
B007MF7HTI|1|No difference in skin tone.
B004KRYVZ4|4|i love the brush and the blade. but the scissors is kind of difficult to use. i have to be extra careful not to shave my eyebrow
B00EUG831I|5|The spoolies were exactly what I expected and arrived in a very timely manner.
B004O3XXIU|3|I found this wig too shiny and fake looking
B0069SQNIU|5|Thanks
B00IM3H3HU|5|Excellent
B003YZ7Q0K|1|Didn't work
B001EXJUTY|4|I like the results with this!
B00GTZ6E9G|5|Love the smell.  I haven't noticed any fading of my tattoos.  I am very very pleased with the tan results and have absolutely no streaking!
B000SDTM3A|5|smells just like what it is......
B00BSVPJ1K|4|some pearls came missing 😔
B000VVT94G|4|These are a nice set of clippers... and I've test out several including the bald fader. What I do not like is that these clippers do not come adjusted properly and I ended up having to use a different set of blades (the blades from my bald fader) because these were so sharp (which is good) that they cut into my skin. I still have this problem and can't seem to adjust them to a level in which I'm not cutting into my scalp. I wish there was more guidance and assistance with adjusting these sharp blades.
B003BQ6QXK|4|NOTE: Does not use suction cups!  If you are looking for one that uses suction cups this is not the mirror for you.<br /><br />I hate suction cups they always fall off the wall eventually and your mirror breaks.  This mirror comes with silicon glue to attache the mirror to the wall.  Silicon is removable with a razor blade so I am not too worried about removal some day.<br /><br />Works as descried, now we will just have to wait and see if it holds up for several years.
B00ASQFIK8|5|Prell Gentle Care works great on my hair!  The water in our area is a little hard.  It leaves a build up on the shower door.  This shampoo helps keep my hair looking and feeling clean and fresh.
B000WF4I3S|5|I love this fragrance!  I usually don't like rose scents but this one is not overly \\"sweet\\" and has a muskier undertone.  It is long lasting but not excessively heavy.  I have sensitive skin, but haven't had any reaction to this perfume even though I wear it daily.  Once again, I found the best price at Amazon.com!
B00P30SJKU|5|Very handy and comfortable fit
B00JB6JKZU|5|Great stuff
B00CK6SLTY|5|My 2 year old loves brushing her teeth with her new Doc McStuffins toothbrush.  I like the electric toothbrushes because it adds a few more brushstrokes for kids who might not do as well with a manual toothbrush.
B00HLUUG0Q|5|Very pretty soft gold shimmer with a really cool &#34;satin finish&#34; that gives it a really cool textured look almost like the look of liquid sand if you've ever used that.
B002XHJHKC|5|I don't know why they discontinued this, I should have kept it on the shelf since it is all I have used since it came out! So glad to find it on here and it has a good shelf life.  It is the best for thin eyelashes.
B007WW1AOE|5|Bunch of lashes, now I just need to figure out how to glue them on right.
B00XN9TUQU|5|The metallic tattoos were overall worth the price. With so many tattoos to choose from, I couldn't decide which ones to put on first. They lasted for at most, a week and a half. There were several that only lasted for four days at least. Overall, I would recommend these metallic tattoos.
B003YJAZZ4|2|After 5 cleans the cleaning station no longer works. Same thing happenend on a prior Braun razor. Braun requires you to ship everything back including the razor for Warranty Repair/Replacement. This process takes 3-4 weeks to complete and the shipping is on my dime for their poor quality product. Crazy, just replace the $20 plastic part! Not very forward thinking customer service.<br />The razor works fine but not worth the nearly $200 price tag. Last Braun product I ever buy.
B00OVNTX1Y|2|Ok
B00ONGBR0Y|5|Excellent product highly recommend this butt cream.
B00B5KJQNQ|5|very good
B0034F7F5G|5|A+++
B003ATS2QC|5|This scale is very slim which is exactly what we wanted. The display is very bright and easy to read.You do not need to tap it like some other scales. Just step on and once it settles on the correct weight, the weight number will flash. Great purchase for anyone wanting a slim scale.
B001V9JU6E|5|Excellent quality & lighting fast delivery!
B0049QELEC|5|We received what we expected with this purchase. Appreciate the detailed description. There is nothing unusual to report.  Would buy again if needed.
B000UZ9ZC4|3|it s okay it different and the color I wanted
B006Z9UPQO|1|Didn't work for me at all waste of money
B004Y0VCAE|1|Didn't work for my hair..make it dry
B00DIP4G4A|1|They were so bad, I threw them away.
B003YJAZZ4|5|Before this model, I owned a Series 3 Braun Razor. It was on its last leg, so I decided to upgrade to Series 7. Probably the best decision I've made in a while!<br /><br />It now takes me about 5 minutes to shave instead of 20 (my Series 3 was THAT bad) This gets 99% of the hair the first time over, while in return doesn't irritate your skin as much.<br /><br />When you put the razor in the base, it will automatically charge and tell you how dirty the razor is. There are three levels of cleaning, and the razor will tell you how much of a cleaning it needs. You then click the start button and the base takes over from there. My series 3 would clean every time, no matter how much you used it. It's great that you get to choose because you end up saving on cleaning solution.<br /><br />The razor itself has a screen that shows hygiene levels and battery level so you know when it's time to plug it into the base if you don't keep it there all the time.<br /><br />The razor has three levels of speed, a slower speed to get the sensitive areas like the neck, and medium speed for normal shaving, and a high speed for when you haven't shaved in a while and need an extra boost of power. The pop out trimmer is also great for cleaning up lines and sideburns.<br /><br />Overall, this is the best electric razor I have used since 2005!
B00K7MHZ1I|1|Not sure if this works, as when you use it, it's so oily, you can't wear makeup, and your eyes are all greasy. How are you supposed to be able to apply twice a day??
B0068OAL2E|1|Having bought this before in whole foods.... I was disappointed when I received it. It's hard to explain the smell. Totally different than the store one. Smells old and stale. Don't waste your money.... just take a trip to your nearest Whole Foods.
B0054MS97A|4|Keeps the skin looking and feeling healthy. I use it for face and body and I do see a little bit of brightening. i may order this product again or may try something else. This soap doesnt have much of a fragrance and that is good.
B00FQPYLIG|5|Tightens and cleans out my pores. Does hurt on your baby facial hairs. But what can we do. Beauty hurts.
B002LPAFRA|1|This is the series 3 in disguise.  Buy the cheaper one they are the same.  The picture for this item is an old customer picture according to the company selling it.
B002Q7VA3G|5|My daughter and I use this for our dandruff and it has made a huge difference so far just with my scalp. My daughter hasn't washed her hair enough to show a big difference. But I noticed that my scalp isn't as flaky, red and over all irritated like before. For the price on amazon, the product is wonderful. I have colored, and curly hair.. and this product is just wonderful.
B00GFAG1IE|5|To be clear, I got this at one of the Daiso's in the Seattle area. Not on Amazon.<br /><br />I love this mask. Its wonderful. Once I'm out of my evening shower, I put on a serum. I let the serum absorb for a few minutes then I put on the Sleeping mask. When I wake up, my skin is soft and nicely hydrated. I dont bother to wash it off like the directions say to.
B00IT1HKV4|5|I am very pleased with this Argan oil. It smells and feels like the real deal. This oil can last really long depending on what it is used for. My husband uses it for his wrinkles and the transformation has been amazing. The only facial products he uses are a trader joe's cleanser and this argan oil...nothing else!! I marvel at the effectiveness of this oil, My daughter and I use it for our hair and skin and it takes care of dry hair and skin like no other. I love how it relieves my dry, cracked heels with long lasting effect . This is an awesome product one which I highly recommend.
B003YJAZZ4|4|I would give it five stars...because it's all there!  But, one detail...that you can only use this on a dry face.  I wish I'd known before purchase.  But you live and you learn.
B000JI9JYQ|4|This product actually works quite well for fine hair that is very straight and very long... both wet and dry.  (better wet)  I don't see a huge improvement over my favorite detangling brush though.  I see a slight improvement ... but it is an improvement.  I think the best improvement over my tangle tamer brush is less hair loss and as we know hair breakage is damage so that is not good.  That is why I use this after a shampoo and stick to the manual detangler brush when the hair is dry for convenience sake of just tossing that in the purse.  This product does travel well, hold a charge and get you through a rough spot on a trip when you need your hair done.  I got mine for a ridiculously low price here on Amazon so it was worth experimenting with.  Glad I took the chance on it.  Fine straight very long hair is the worst nightmare of tangles in all the hair world. I think if it worked on my hair... it can work for anyone.  I have never had a hairdresser yet who will do my comb out after washing.  So yeah... I think this gadget is worth it to try if you are having problems.
B00AE2FJTQ|5|I use this drill every day multiple times a day at work and the foot pedal is great. It's a little light weight (PEDAL) for my liking but so far so good. It seems to be holding up great!
B002B4LTYE|5|These pencils are so perfect! Creamy, easy to apply, long lasting, smudge proof! I wish I could find them locally since ELF is only $1 in stores...but as an addon item with no shipping it's worth the extra money on amazon.
B003O6FT4Y|5|Very strong.
B001V9LV6G|3|Not sure it adds much to my cream regime!
B00BDKLCA8|5|I'm crazy for this scent.  Bought it for my husband.  Just wish I could get him to wear it more often!
B0071FWHJ4|1|Burned my mouth.  So awful, I had to spit it out.
B00F3T4TIW|1|The product does not work. Do not buy this machine. I lost my investment. The product came to me one month after purchase and arrived damaged. DO NOT BUY!
B006UR2DNO|4|I really love this snake skin pattern, and I think it looks even better when you actually wear it! I knew it won't stay on my nails for that long, so I put clear polish over it, but it still didn't last very long (5 days?). It still chips. I got another pattern of nail polish tapes from Salley Hansen, I've been wearing it without the clear polish and it's lasting much better. It's been 3 days already but pretty much no chip, except on the bottom that I've induced by picking on it (I didn't put it on neatly the first time). I think the trick to having it last is having this half-dried sticker product dry on your nails after you stick them on your nails, kinda like how you wait for the super fast clear nail polish to dry after you do your nails.<br /><br />I can totally make multiple uses of this product, even though this product is only intended to be worn on all your nails only once. I don't think I'd recommend other people doing that tho lol. Overall, I really enjoyed this product, and dang, snake skin pattern looks awesome, delicate but dangerous on your nails, and in a strange way, it looks almost natural. It must be because its color is somewhat like your skin color, more so than some other nail polish. I just really like this product. I think I might be buying another set.
B00755JCDO|5|I have purchased many products and taken him to the doctor too!  I use some of this company's stuff myself and saw the Yes to Tomatoes product on Subscribe and Save. I believe this is the most effective acne product he has used! It is a permanent item on my list now!
B002QFGQAK|5|This product is wonderful!! There are so many colors and tones that can fit just about any skin color. The concealer  blends wonderfully and does not break me out, which is a plus. The product is smooth and completely worth the price; You can create many makeup looks, and I am sure it would be perfect for any makeup artist.
B000QYEK88|5|My husband loves it. He says it is by far the closest shave he has ever had. I love it too- his face is so smooth.
B00KO6I1Z6|5|M so happy and want to try this product so much !!!!!!!!!!!<br />So sad !!! This Not ship to Australia !!!
B00HV2L0PE|1|This is odorless but the drying time takes hours and it becomes very sticky and clogs up the brush. Not pleased with results takes to long to dry but liquid goes a long way with just a a few drops.
B00CAWHN88|2|My applicator arrived bent in the opposite direction to which it should go, and I was not able to get it to stay bent the way that it needed to go.  I straitghened it as best I could and attempted to use it that way.  When I touched the pad to my back, it immediately fell off.  I then bent the applicator the correct way and put the velcro band back around it to keep it in that position.  I will try using it again another day, but I am not too impressed with it, and I am concerned that the applicators will not stay on.
B007IVTA0U|5|perfect
B005967L7U|5|Great bubble action very nice tub great kit that comes with it.
B003A722RE|2|too awkward to use.
B001DRIFWE|3|Its ok, nothing great.  I wouldn't bother spending money on it again.  I will use it, but never buy it again.
B001MA0QY2|5|This flat iron is great!  Super hot, better than all the Chi's I've ever had
B001ECQ7G4|5|This product works amazingly.  I've used many others that cost less but did not work and were actually rejected by my skin as toxins - what happens when you feed the body's largest organ with crap.  So Tend Skin, although pricey is wonderful.  The alcohol and aspirin kill bacteria and several humectants work to extract moisture from the epidermis and the general atmosphere or environment.  This is important because I put LOADS of this stuff on my skin and it doesn't dry my skin.  It has also greatly reduced the acne on my face by drying pimples, exfoliating (also keeping skin very soft), and disinfecting.  So basically you should buy this product.  Thank you God for Tend Skin!
B00NY5NGPE|5|I loved the texture and moisture that this product provides. Unfortunately the oils in the product did not agree with my skin. This company is 5 star when it comes to customer service and they guided me through the process of trying to acclimate my skin to this serum. I will definitely try other products from this line.
B004K0CRIY|5|I read some reviews that this product didn't always work. So far I have not had a problem with it and have been using it for more than a year now. I've use it about every two weeks to do my hands and every month to do my toes. And for a period of 4 months I was also doing my mother's nails and my mother-in-law's nails too. This machine has gotten it's fair share of use and it is still working great!<br /><br />The machine is big enough that you can put your whole hand in and don't have to do the thumbs seperate.<br /><br />I have been using the 120 second timer for each step in the process of putting Harmony Gelish nail products on and have had no issues. It cures them and they look great.<br /><br />The machine has a 120 sec and 180 sec timer. I wish it had a 60 sec timer instead of the 180 sec. You can also use it without the timer but then have to use the on/off button each time to get it off.<br /><br />This is a great machine especially for the price!!!!
B004MFSFFG|5|Three drops is all it takes to give my face a fresh appearance.  I concentrate on the wrinkles under my eyes first and they visibly improve immediately.  Then I tap the rest lightly across my forehead, cheeks and chin and blend lightly.  It's amazing how far it goes.<br />Since you use so little, this bottle lasts a very, very long time.  I can't say I have seen lightening of any age spots but they are definitely not getting any darker.  This is my 'must-have' product!
B000H46K1C|5|We are seniors.  We purchased this item to accompany the Resistance Chair that we purchased from another on-line site.<br />The reason we purchased both of these items is because my wife has an old shoulder injury that has restricted her raising her left arm above her shoulder.<br />We are trying to rectify this limitation and the reviews indicated this exercise pair has done that for other people, both young and old.<br />My wife loves this chair and has been using it daily since we have received these 2 pieces and since I have set them up.<br />I will be starting to use this chair as well even though I do not have such movement limitations.  However, I do expect to get a help with a greater range of motion in my upper limbs.<br />Thanks for offering this great product.
B009DU4QYE|5|I just recently tried this product to see if it would help relieve my scalp itching.  I color my hair and as a result have a sensitive scalp.  The common products available at the store have not been helpful but this shampoo really felt soothing on my scalp. My hair looks and feels better than before.  Give the product a try if you have issues with your scalp.
B00PUMEREI|5|Love this !
B00MMKAM5E|5|I saw this advertised on tv (lol, i have a dvr and rarely see ads but caught this one, thankfully) and purchases it at Wal-mart for 9.98.  Pricey for me but it is 8 oz.  I've had great results!!!  I started on my forearm from elbow to wrist where I had tiny rough bumps. I saw improvement within a couple wks.  I was pretty good at using it twice a day every day but may have missed a couple days.  Now, about 6 wks later, that section is quite smooth.  I am using it on the rest of my arm and having great results!! It is non-greasy but it definitely leaves &#34;something&#34;, I can't describe it.  I  have to wash my hands after use.  I high recommend this cream.
B00BCRD9V2|4|Peppermint is the best, and the only one that tastes good, but my teeth feel super clean!
B001FY19DC|1|My grandson's OT suggested this since he exerts unnecessary pressure when writing. It helped in his OT sessions so we're using it at school and home now.
B0046ZOWJU|5|Didn't care for this curling iron, had a hard time using it but it<br />could just be me, burned my fingers a few times.
B004M1BO3U|5|Great toothbrush. It holds a long charge and leaves moth very refreshed. Philips customer service is great if you have a issue, so buy with confidence. It's the best toothbrush you can buy, in my opinion.
B004L2B3BS|1|the ad shows a big bottle and all you get is a tiny one. Hate the false advertising it should be illegal. The product itself was worse! Has ingredients in it that are known to cause problems for scalp...sodium laureth sulfate (largest ingredient besides water)...and my scalp itched worse and got worse since I switched to this from Demarest. Worst money Ive ever spent and first time Ive ever felt the need to review or complain in print! Dont buy this!
B00ARF42D4|2|Don't like it. Have to charge after every use, else it goes dead.
B001QVGZ3I|5|Clean resin, which burns evenly. The fragrance is true to my memories of sitting in church as a child. I only wish there were more of the stuff in a bag!
B00D8ZOVMW|5|I have ordered 2, one for myself and one for family members. The diffuser is easy to use and clean, read the directions. I use it almost every day and have had not problems with it.
B00D2959I4|5|The name says it all. Use it for both work days and sports/exercise days. The downside, as the directions say, make sure you wash your hands WELL. The liquid can sometimes get caught around your finger nail cuticle creating a mess.
B0091XLGO6|5|cool product!
B00KS6QQEU|5|Everthing was as discribed and full met my expectations.
B0046KGF54|1|I received my order yesterday and the size is wrong.  The description clearly states 1 liter 33oz however I received 2 10oz bottles.  I am returning the order.  Only order if you want the smaller bottles.
B003AYEFU4|5|This was my first time trying an Aussie product and I was very pleased with it. My hair is very curly and it worked great by holding the curl. I loved the scent and the fact that it left my hair soft and not crunchy. I tested this product at no cost courtesy of Influenster, but all opinions are my own.
B0056TA0NM|1|I will never buy this again.  It is not even close to being soft & you can buy it in the store's for half the price
B0019JF0PG|5|Light spray, firm hold, very very light fragrance. My hair doesn't hold a curl very long, and this really helps extend the \\"do.\\"
B006W2SYHG|4|Decent shave, very smooth, maybe too smooth almost.  Seems like it isn't doing anything and then the stubble is gone.  Better on short beards, take a bit of repeating the same areas for three-four day stubble. Kinda weird charger, would prefer just sticking a cord in it, but it holds a charge for quite a while, a few weeks at least for me, so you can stash the charger under the counter till you need it.  Charges real quick, like an hour, tops. Took a while to get used to for me, very light compared to my Braun this replaces. Could use some more heft honestly.
B000C234ZY|4|cologne quality, soft silage, great for layering perfumes
B004ZNH4YS|5|excellent product
B000C1UEWG|5|I don't understand why this cologne has such negative reviews on the net on various websites. I used this way back when it was new and quite popular in my high school. I remember telling my dad I wanted it for my birthday. I always got compliments that I smelled nice and girls always seemed to like it. After that first bottle I had moved on to more expensive colognes like armani code, 212 etc.<br /><br />I have quite a collection of colognes and you can say that I am always wondering what to try next. As I was getting bored of some of the scents in my collection I decided to search on amazon for something new to try and ran across this in my search.<br /><br />At the price it is being offered I saw no loss in adding this my order along with Bvlgari Avqa Marine. Both arrived today shipped and sold from amazon llc in perfect wrapped condition. Surprisingly FCUK him smells Fcuking great just like I remember. It has a fresh kind of floral yet clean masculine smell. I smell hints of lavender and even a slight sweetness. Yes it smells a little synthetic and &#34;soapy&#34; at first but the dry down smells great.<br /><br />It lasts long too, I sprayed my wrists like 5 hours ago and can still smell it on me as I write this review. The bottle design looks cool and my bottle sprays perfectly.<br /><br />Overall FCUK him is a good clean fresh fragrance. Obviously its no Gucci, Armani, Versace or D&G but its not priced like them either. Its a &#34;good to have in your collection&#34; cologne. I recommend it for casual wear and work or daytime use. It can work as a nighttime fragrance as well although I wouldn't use it for special occasions or dates. Great fragrance for a great price. Buy it!
B005P0WQHA|5|This is the best face moisturizer I have ever used.  It has a great scent and makes your face feel great.
B00FW2BR0S|5|Excellent for diabetic feet
B001U243H8|5|This scrub is gentle yet effective.  I recommend this to everyone I know.  Gently exfoliates and makes skin smooth and fresh
B002RBF1PO|5|Great razor
B00JMIXBEI|5|I didn't buy this on Amazon (yet), but found it randomly at Rite Aid while looking for for dry shampoo. I'd have to say hands down best dry shampoo I've ever tried! Excited to find it on here for 1/2 the price too :). I had my can last me an extremely long time. I have no idea what people are talking about it lasting only a few times... You are supposed to spray dry shampoo in short bursts on your hair not hold it down like an aresol hairspray... I'm thinking other reviewers are over-using their product and that's why it isn't lasting. You don't need much for it to be effective. Spray (in short bursts) on your roots, wait a few minutes and hold your head upside down and shake your hands through your hair and voila! Volumized, non-greasy, fresh hair that smells great.
B004KXJRCK|5|Perfume is great. Delivered even earlier than expected.
B00005IBW0|5|I personally use this product from the stores. I was going back to India and decided to buy several multipacks for my family and friends. It was very well packed and allowed me to take this item safely by flight without risk of spilling on the clothes. St Ives produts suit most people i know and they all were very happy using it . There were no side effects on skin to anyone i know. Its a very good gift item for someone who has not tried it yet.
B00DLLYVK0|4|This brush is cute and colorful. I'd bought it because I love the Wet Hair Brush that I'd purchased for my five-year-old daughter and wanted something like it for me. I found, though, that the Wet Hair Brush is stiffer than this one. This one didn't comb through my thick hair as well, but it did wonders on my tender-headed daughter's hair. I ended up giving this one to her and keeping her Wet Hair Brush for myself. She's thrilled with the swap because this one has such a fun pattern and it is gentle on her tangles.
B00D2PF1SG|5|The product is excellent!
B00E4PMQAO|5|I've tried them all.  They all break.  They're all cheaply made.  I've only had this one for a week, but I know it will be long-lasting.  It is truly solidly constructed, and is extremely efficient and effective.  I don't often write reviews, but this one deserves it.  If you're looking to deal with those pesky hairs coming out of your nose and ears, this is the best solution available.  And, the light, which I thought would be a frivolous addition, is incredibly helpful.  The trimmer came quickly and without a hitch.  Thank you Toilet Tree Products.
B0037771PK|5|I discovered this perfume when I went looking for the scent of tuberose mid winter in the UK a couple of years back when I was just yearning for the smell of my tropical home in northern australia - and this shower gel (along with the rest of the Do Son range) leaves a beautiful lingering (but not overpowering) aroma exactly as I wanted....  Lathering up in this stuff feels like pure luxury....  But be prepared - it is pricey.
B00BQUK7BA|5|I don't understand people who write reviews and state that the product is cheap.  Heelloo, how much money do you think you spent for it? Of course it's cheap, isn't it why you bought it?!  This product is very well made, and the material is really good.  What you see is what you get! (see photo too) It fits in my bag nicely and zippers work fine.  It's not made for you to put weights inside, but it works well for your wallet and make up and small things around your bag. I'm ordering a few more as gifts. Edit: I got two more and they're the same quality as the first one I ordered, and I have two more on the way.  These make organizing so much easy.  I used the first one as a bag/purse insert and I'm using another one as a make up organizer, and the other two are gifts.   Thank you to the seller for making these so neat and my last two came in a week!
B003ZGH4VO|5|love this stuff, best aftershave ive ever purchased, but if possible mix with a skin oil ( i use vit E otherwise its too thin and evaporates a lil too vast.
B004GBOESI|5|This makeup organizer is AMAZING!!!! It's huge!! Such great quality and can fit tons of makeup. I am very pleased. It looks very high end and is very well made!!
B004FKCZPE|4|Interesting stuff but I would only wear it at night as it tends to give the skin a weird  shine if used outside during the day. Otherwise it works or at least I think it does. I'm going to keep buying more with what I've seen from it but if by chance they add an ingredient to it making as if a sun block this would turn into a monthly staple instead of a luxury item.
B0060NQ0PU|5|Love this stuff. I have been wearing it for many years.  I've had compliments all over the world. Literally.  I've been in all parts of the globe, every woman asks what I'm wearing,  and it smells soo yummy! !!  Gale Hayman makes the best cotton candy scent, hands down. Layer the scent, lotion - then perfume and it will last for hours. It's so sweet and well, DELICIOUS,  I promise you won't be disappointed.
B00H81GP26|5|I've been looking to transition to aluminium-free deodorant for some time now. It's been....stinky. I'm a bit of a deodorant addict, and when I was younger I would apply it 2 to 3 times a day. I've tried other aluminium-free deodorants and I could not stand the smell of myself, so I would end up going back to my old deodorant as I felt I couldn't be out in public. This works! Yaaay! I'm dry and not smelly by the end of the day.
B000NJHS08|5|Good quality.  A lot of rollers for the price
B0037CJHQQ|4|This product is creamy and gentle especially on my edges.  I wear lace wigs often & I use citrus glue remover to loosen the glue from wig & edges first. Then after wig is off to get the remaining glue without rubbing my edges roughly I apply this creamy bond remover and then shampoo.  It removes any remaining glue residue.
B008Y8D7NC|3|These rollers do not hold where I place them.
B00F1ATGUE|1|The color is a pinkish plum that I can't wear. I don't know anybody who can wear this color, either.
B0060P0UUO|4|ok
B000C1W6YA|5|Exelente
B0029OSN4U|2|i started using this product 4 months ago and I'm dark haired with a light- medium skin tone. I used it on my legs, bikini, underarm, arms and upper-lip as directed in the manual. It's kinda easy to use, safe but it's extremely painful. I can not tolerate the level 5 except on my upper-lip coz the hair there is fine, light and not much . The level i can tolerate depends on the area i use it for and how sensitive it is. The problem is if u wanna get results you have to use it on level 5 on all the areas to be treated which is impossible for me. About the results there is a result but not good enough for me. yeah the hair is lighter, finer and grow slower but i still need to shave even on my legs which i use level four and sometimes 5 for it! and the reduction is not more than 30% for the legs and all the 30% in the quality of the hair not the quantity!!! the arms i use level 4 or 5 too the reduction is 10-20% and this percentage goes for all other areas i mentioned in the beginning but i use a lower levels except the upper-lip area the reduction is 50%<br /> There is a tip to reduce the pain shave well the use ice to numb the area you gonna treat then treat it quickly. This will make you tolerate a level up or even tow if you did it in a very cold room.
B000QUJ0IC|1|It leaves a burning sensation on my eyes and face.
B00U9PO9DK|4|I love the way my hair felt clean.
B001OVQSJG|5|super deep clean you hair
B000MJUAFE|5|i am happy for my buy! thanks, every things it's AMAZING.<br />i wish visit your products next time. see you!
B00I6IINM0|2|Just fine
B005ODJ5TK|5|This product is wonderful for wearing ethnic hair naturally (unprocessed).  It leaves the hair curly, shiny, healthy looking, and without &#34;friz&#34;.
B00B83RN7Q|5|It is a great value for the price and the product is wonderful.  Nothing tames my hair the way this does.
B0020MMD06|5|Love the scent it's light not too strong.. One of my favorite perfumes.  Expected delivery was two days got it next day.
B002KQ05SO|4|Great shampoo!! The smell is a little strong at first but got used to it.
B0006PS3KI|5|Fast.
B000ZK1F7M|4|This was a repeat purchase of an excellent product , I've found it works well to smooth my aging skin.
B001PBOKRM|3|This is NOT the Cherry Almond scent...This source is sending the ORIGINAL scent, which I don't like and didn't think I was ordering....<br />I gave the 1st bottle away, thinking I had made a mistake in ordering, and ordered again, receiving, once again, the ORIGINAL scent and NOT the advertised CHERRY ALMOND, fragrance.<br /><br />A shame, I was trying to get cherry almond as I love that scent and use the hand soap with the fragrance......<br /><br />PLEASE be aware that this will not be the cherry almond scented hand lotion if you order.
B001JBC4FI|5|My first eyelid primer was Urban Decay's Primer Potion, and while I liked how it made my eyeshadows more vibrant, I felt that the texture was a bit too moist for my liking (I naturally have oily lids).  My friend recommended I try a MAC Paint Pot instead; my first choice was Soft Ochre.  It's now my go to eyelid primer, here's why:<br /><br />1. It has a smooth, matte finish.  For people with oily lids, this paint pot works like a dream.  Be warned that you will need to warm up the product first, but once you do, it effortlessly sweeps over the lids with little tug.  I find that the matte finish also makes it easier to apply and blend eyeshadow.<br /><br />2. It's a good base for neutral eyeshadows.  Soft ochre is the perfect neutral shade for my eyelids, and helps intensify brown, tan, and other types of neutral eyeshadow colors.<br /><br />3. You can also wear it alone as a way to brighten up your eyes.  I've never really like the concealer method for making my upper eyelids look brighter because it gets sticky, but this paint pot provides a soft, natural finish that makes my eyes look more awake.  Love it.<br /><br />Overall, I literally have no complaints about this product.  If you have fair skin and need a matte primer, then this paint pot will do the job.
B000V5BXO6|1|I used to use the revlon eyebrow pencil that came in a two pack similar to this. Unfortunately they stopped selling that so I was happy when I found this on Amazon, looked similar and I have the medium brown a shot. I have brunette hair with tones of red. Sadly the medium brown is more like a henna brown, very orangey.
B002GP62KY|5|This stuff heals cuts, bruises...it doesn't sting and has a pleasant smell. Children never run away screaming. Give it a try.
B001AM6452|4|I rub on vein away after a hot shower, and I can see a great improvement in the looks of the veins in my legs. The area above my left ankle was showing a lot of broken black and blue veins, and they are almost gone now.
B0016JDMS6|5|Love the smell of this cologne on my husband!
B009IBQ614|5|I bought two - the rose and this purple one - and both are pretty and don't look cheap.<br />You don't need to be swamped in essential oils to benefit from them, so this necklace is perfect. Gives off a gentle scent for days or weeks(depending on oils, of course -- more volatile ones may need replacing sooner; heavier ones might last weeks).<br />The stop is made of cork tipped with metal (inside) and has stayed in place perfectly, throughout daily routine and heavy travel. I heard that the cork may not last but one month of wearing hasn't shown any problems yet. Appreciated the packaging including 2 plastic bulb droppers.
B00KQX6AHS|5|Love this oil.  Recommend!!!
B0073WOJUU|1|Doesn't work. I used it every day for 15 months with no results.
B004NYWR7S|3|The polish is super thick & brushes are too big for the bottle.
B00BN4BD5S|5|IT CAUGHT MY EYE IN MACYS AND IT WAS TO EXPENSIVE SO I LOOKED ON AMAZON... BUT THIS IS MY NEW WINTER PERFUME. I LOVE IT. GREAT PRICE & SMELLS GREAT!
B006FN587Q|3|I thought these hair ties were going to be much larger.  I envisioned something a little more 70's retro when the hair tie was as long as your pony tail was.  It's basically exactly the same size as a typical ponytail holder, but with a one inch dohicky hanging at the end.
B00DPE9EQO|5|At first I was thinking oil? All over my face? Hmmmm. But then I used and it soaks right in without leaving any trace of oil and leaves my skin so soft. I've been mixing my with Hyaluronic acid serum and use everywhere on my face and eyes with no problems.
B00GCYLKC0|3|Very small amount and doesn't go far due to the consistency (not very rich.. Seems like a regular hand lotion consistency). I used eminence before this but didn't want to pay the high price tag so I decided to give this a try. Eminence lasts forever! However I have very sensitive skin and typically break out with new products and this product did not break me out at all.
B004NHVTJW|5|LOVE THIS FLAT IRON VERY EASY TO WORK WITH AND THE SIZE FITS IN MY HAND JUST RIGHT NEED TO GET A MINI FOR TRAVEL.  HAIRSTYLER IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT IVE HAD A HAIRSTYLER FLAT IRON  BEFORE I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR A GOOD FLAT IRON
B00BIGBIWE|5|I will always have this is stock at home. Great dry shampoo but I also use it after styling my hair for more texture and it's good to take oil out of your hair if you accidentally put to much moisture or oil in your hair.The scent is very clean too. This stuff is addictive, buy at your own risk!! I do have blonde hair and have heard this isn't good for dark hair colors.
B000I6NG66|5|Got to me really fast.  Have not tried yet, but reviews speak highly of this product.  Looking forward to trying it
B00112FLO6|5|This is a very pretty shade of rose.  I have olive skin tone and many lipstick shades don't work on me.  I finally found Maybelline's 'wine on ice' and it looked great with my complexion.    However, when I went to buy it again the product had been discontinued.  I was excited to find it on Amazon and bought three tubes.  The lipstick is moist, a little shimmery, and is a color that almost anyone can wear.
B005XUNG5I|5|Like alot works
B00641UCY8|4|I bought it at Wal-Mart for about $8. It's great. Your hair will drink it in. I'm Hispanic with curly hair & my curls are bouncy & soft. The smell is beautifully coconutty. It really is medicine for your hair. Thank you to the makers of the product ❤️😘
B008LOI2X4|5|melts and mixes well
B00PCRDMYC|4|This lipstick is very easy to apply. I got this shade because of my light skin tone and thought it would be a great addition to my make up game, or as my husband calls it, &#34;warpaint&#34;.  This color is very rich and pigmented for a lipstick. It does not run over your lip line and does not smear after you put it on. This color is on the pink side with a more brightening effect. I think this would be great on someone who has a tan or slightly darker than me (fair skin tone). I would say this is a great date night or evening out color. They should do more colors and I would purchase from them again. I was offered this item at a discount in exchange for my honest review.
B00M4PLBDE|5|Works great.
B00RQYL3GS|5|Awesome I was having a reaction to the plastic on my cpap. I can use it with these very comfortable.
B0006NY1NS|1|Totally not anything like I have purchased before.  If it wouldn't cost as much to return it as it cost I would definitely do so.
B000CNKC62|5|This scent for men is heavenly. Was recommended by someone. Got it for my husband. Would definitely get it again. Love it!!! Highly recommend.
B00P33M6FQ|2|This product did NOT reduce my stretch mark lines at all. I used twice a day for 30 days exactly like the instructions say. I also used the product right out of the shower thinking it would lock in moisture and maybe help. My stretch marks are exactly the same as they were 30 days ago. No improvement at all. The only positive about the cream, it does leave your skin feeling very soft. I would NOT buy this product again and would not recommend anyone waste their money.
B004SS8WWS|2|I have a ton of gelish colors to do my gel myself at home. This color every time after about 2-3 days will fade to a weird yellowish pink color to the point it looks so bad that I end up removing it. I love the color but I don't like having to remove my gel after just a few days. Maybe I got a bad bottle or something but this is the only color that seems to do this.
B000KEIPC6|5|Been using it for years.  I have thick short asian hair.  Product is not too strong or light for hold.  If your hair is somewhat damp then apply the product, it's leave a slight shine.  If you don't want the shine, just comb it thru.  And no flaking.
B003WHF148|5|I use skinceutical products so I like good products. I bought this one because my sister insisted it was good. So I went along. It is a very good and mild exfoliant for the skin. It smells wonderful and I am sure it will last forever because it takes such a small amount to do wonders. Definetely will buy again when it's over. I like it very much.
B00AJGTIFI|5|Have acne marks? Try. This. I think it is the niacinamide, but this is the only product that actually lightens my skin by the next morning after I put it on at night. It is amazing!<br /><br />At first I didn't really &#34;get&#34; how to use this product effectively. I was using it as a spot treatment after getting a blemish. The next morning my mark was lighter, but so was the skin around it, basically where ever the cream touched. Once I started covering a larger area, and being very generous with the portions, I really started seeing improvement. The entire area would just look WAY more even in the morning. Now, it does not get rid of scar indentations. But it corrects the redness. Like other products that really work (vitamin C for example) my progress plateaus after a while where I start to get diminishing returns. But, I certainly can't complain. This is THE most effective blemish erasing product I have ever used, vitamin C being a close second. What works for me may not work for you, but this is something I would easily recommend to a friend. Just please be sure to patch test every new product you use.
B001F51PXA|5|OMG. My dry/frizzy/over processed/ damaged/burnt-hair went from looking like straw to salon smooth! This is truly a miracle product and I can't believe it's so cheap! Clearly a winner!!!!
B0020MMD4W|5|It is very unique, crisp, light, perfect for summer.  There is nothing out there like this.
B0046797WK|4|I have thin, fine, completely invisible without mascara lashes. This mascara is one of my favorites, it gets my lashes just right, gives them good volume in the first coat, dramatic lashes within 2-3 coats easily, and I've never had an issue with clumping. P.S. BEWARE of ordering from the seller Two Whole Sailors, their packaging is terrible, as you can see from the customer images I uploaded.
B000G2951C|5|I don't find my stand to be wobbly at all. Very sturdy, does not look cheap, and sits flush with the system, it did surprise me how big the system is overall though. I would recommend this counter space system only if you have a lot of room on your counter, otherwise i would try and mount it on a wall somewhere.
B00B8KWFJU|3|I thought this was just OK. You can't really compare to a gel manicure. I followed the instructions and was pleased, but not thrilled.
B00DU6DWVA|5|Why weave it when you can clip it? Non slip firm grip- excellent
B00BJRTCYS|4|Great product but too little product for cost.
B000TG6FEK|5|I love this color.  Try it.
B00KBOCL0W|5|Love love love this wig. Such good quality!
B008SCUHBE|4|Love this product.  Only reason not a five-star is because sometimes in cakes a little.  BUT, it stays on all day!!
B005OFT14C|1|I read many reviews before ordering this toothbrush. The bristles were not very soft and the handle was very difficult to hold.
B005WQB6G4|4|This product is great, however:<br />You need batteries, there is not a wall outlet cord included... No big deal.<br />Also, to make it function, there's a pressure pad inside, sometimes it takes a little extra pressure to get it running (kids might have trouble).
B00J2EDS7C|5|very high quality
B005OTFGI8|4|Nice
B00VSPYFSO|5|I use this to remove my eyeliner so I don't have to get any of the eye remove in my eye. It's great for this purpose!
B00G9XP04S|5|Soft!
B00IALDHDI|3|Bombshell Curvaceous mascara makes my eyelashes look amazing! My only compain is it is difficult to remove. It is very hard to get off even with makeup removers. And I feel like I am ripping out my own lashes to get the mascara off. Good mascara, but I don't think I would buy.<br />I received these products complimentary from influenster for testing purposes.
B002NR5EOA|5|It taste great and makes my teeth squeaky clean. I'll know in a few month how it worked on my gum
B00LNJYCQK|3|work ok.....
B009R4O1CS|1|Did not like this at all. Nails do not really fit into available slots so the mess is just as if I didn't have a guide.
B000IEMK6U|5|A wonderful product! Perhaps a bit on the expensive side, but with one overnight treatment and continued use (about once per week) of this masque, the dry, brittle hair I always get during the summer months was no more!  My hair is shiny, healthier-looking, and no longer tangles.  I swim almost every evening, and the chemicals have wreaked havoc on my hair -- this product seems to be an excellent tonic for problem hair. As an added benefit, it smells lovely, too.
B001G7PIJO|5|I love Dr Bronner products and Amazon had the best price I could find.  Would buy again and would recommend to a friend.
B0017BI80K|2|Suck quality
B00C7DYBX0|5|bought it for a friend and she loves it
B00BJ6BH6K|4|love these lashes!
B003YCVWXK|5|I get many compliments from this blue mascara.  I use it the most.
B007HU4C3C|1|I ordered this from this co, and just recently opened.  It is only half full, is pale in color, and does not smell like it should as I have been using this product for years. There are also holes in the bottom of the silver container appearing to be tampered with. It is not white like the picture shows which is Skinmedica's new label.
B001B8OLXM|5|Works really well for my hair!
B00027DDOQ|5|I've always loved this stuff. Makes a noticeable difference overnight. And I LOVE Amazon's price for it.
B001ATBOCS|5|I just started getting Brazilian waxes done and went about five times to a professional. I would recommend doing this before waxing yourself. The reason being that the hair starts to grow back in much finer and makes it easier to do yourself. Also, you can kind of see/feel the way the professional does it first.<br /><br />I was totally blown away by how well the GiGi stuff worked. I was WAY less sensitive and did not get nearly as much post-waxing irritation as I did at the salon. I didn't find it to be all that messy (I sat on a bunch of paper towels which worked well) and kept the wax on a candle warmer during the process. Incredibly impressed with the results and can't believe how much money I am now saving by doing it myself.<br /><br />Also, I would highly recommend getting the kit first and then going back and getting the individual items as needed.<br /><br />Lastly, I would also recommend getting the [[ASIN:B001DLAXAW PFB Vanish Ingrown Hair Treatment Roll On Gel - 4 oz]] if you have trouble with bumps after waxing, as I did. Works great!
B00O7CEFKI|1|Very poorly made and falling apart when I got it. Also WAY too big
B0019ZEVZU|5|Works as described. The battery is great, I charge it maybe once a month and use it once-twice a day every day. The actual brush-head also lasts for a lot longer than they say it would.
B00F9X34XS|2|purchased Jan 6th. On April 12, the on-off switch stopped working. I had been noticing the unit needing to be recharged more and more frequently. Now, after 3 months, it no longer works. This is the first time with am Oral-B  electric toothbrush I have had a problem. I will try and get factory Warranty service and write an updated report later.
