B00005JOHC|5.0|This is some of the best funny TV ever put to the tube. Hard to figure there were a<br />few people who gave the show a one star. A must see program, don't pass this up.
B003IY48PS|3.0|I absolutely love this movie BUT there is better releases out there. I ordered the UK steelbook from Amazon.co.uk and the features are way better and there is a bunch. So if you are not a person that cares about the making of's and interviews then this is the release for you. But keep in mind there is others.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Nobody can doubt that when Spielberg does something it has to be perfect.  Lincoln is no exception.<br />Firstly, you choose one of the world's best actor to play the lead role.  Daniel Day Lewis is very selective in his roles and he also studies his character to ensure that we are not just watching Daniel Day Lewis but Abraham Lincoln (Tom Cruise take note!).  DDL's portrayal is superb.<br />The movie is beautifully produced but it is an historic record and is therefore tough going at times.  It shows another side to an iconic president, desparate to unite his nation and start the end to barbaric ownership of fellow human beings.<br /><br />Supported by some amazing actors, DDL delivers a powerful performance.  Well worth watching.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I am hooked.  Really helps during the down time at work.  I recommend this game to anyone that loves the hidden objects games.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really love this. You have infinite blocks in creative.<br />You have to get your fight on and show mobs your bite in survival.<br />I hope the 0.7.0 update comes soon.<br />Minecraft- My favorite block game... ever
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|This show is so amazing! It has humor, drama, heart, and mystery. I think the actors are at the top of their game in this series!
B008OOYALE|4.0|It is cute app. Wished you could earn gold to feed the dragons. It is cool you can visit other dragon villages.
B00000JGOH|5.0|I love this movie! Used to have it on VHS & was really wanting to watch it- hard to find on DVD but of course found it on amazon! :)
B0037W68F4|5.0|MGMT is my favorite band, they are so different and wonderful. Their music takes you to many different types of universes. Each song sets you to a different mood and you get lost in the exquisite sounds. If I had to make a recommendation list of albums for someone, Congratulations would be #1 on my list, secondly, followed by MGMT's first album Oracular Spectacular, both albums are equally amazing. The first time I listened to this album, I wasn't quite sure if I liked it or not, but as I listened to it a few times more it became addicting to listen to and I couldn't get my mind off it. The songs never get old. If you have a good taste in music, get this album you won't regret it. If you aren't sure if you like it at first, that is what good music is always like the first listen, then it's amazing. Also check out MGMT's new song Alien Days they released, their third album comes out in June!!
B005USZYDU|4.0|This book is about a boy named theo who's parents are lawyers and wants to be one himself. Theo's town is facing the biggest murder trial ever, but the defense is so good the guilty man might walk. Theo finds himself in the middle of the case, and doesn't know what to do!<br /><br />This is a good, intriguing, book, but I wished it would have been scarier! The plot is well done and the book keeps you on your toes! The ages that would enjoy this are probably 5-8 grade, but it could be a good read for all.<br /><br />ENJOY!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I loved this book because there is never a moment when you are not at the edge of your seat. The only bad part is trying  to be patient  waiting  for hopefully the next book to come out. Thank you so much Kiera Cass for giving me hope to finding my own true love someday.
B00BGGIW2K|5.0|many have commented on the feminine quality of Mike Milosh's voice and all the accolades are more than deserved. Without any vocal pyrotechnics, he is able to make you feel each phrase in the song. There's a sense of intimacy to his voice that is captivating. The reason I think the album is so good though is because the music complements his voice so well. Each song is so carefully produced that even after many, many listens I still find new things in each song. Melancholy and beautiful.
B00683JLXA|2.0|This is an angry birds remake but instead of throwing birds your throwing baby pandas (that's sad) and instead of pigs your killing ninjas.  Its an okay game with a good idea just needs a little more work on the graphics and physics department. Also its a complete ripoff of angry birds.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Sounds not bad.<br />Pandas are awesome! (though not quite as cool as penguins.)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Graphics are pretty blah<br />Physics are not very good.<br />Remake of another game (although popular game)<br />The controls are very anoying.<br />Has to many permissions I am really not sure any are needed.<br /><br />If you really love angry bird games or their rip offs I suggest you give this a try but otherwise move on.
B000SW4DV2|5.0|I remember seeing this movie years ago and  loved it. Robin Williams is hilarious. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes him or robots in general.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|after hearing many talking about this show, I thought I would give it a try, though I don't like zombie movies. Oh was I surprised. I loved this show. Its great. Totally hooked on it.....
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down :) wonderfully written and amazing for a first time writer. Can't wait for more books by him!
B007CIQ4B2|4.0|I like this CD.  The music is mellow and relaxes me.  It is not my favorite cd that I have ordered on Amazon, but I still enjoy listening to it occassionally.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Once again the over abundance of ads detracted from this game getting a 5 star rating otherwise it's exactly as advertised.
B004132HZS|5.0|Great show! The modern day adaptation of Sherlock Holmes captivates the viewer and has great interaction between Sherlock and Watson.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I'll be anxiously awaiting the final book of Follett's Century Trilogy. I am so attached to these characters, thanks to the brilliant way Follett brings them to life for his reader.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|Great show, each &#34;episode&#34; is an hour and half mini-movie with snappy dialogue, great pacing and driven by phenomenal acting.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is not endless drivel.  It brings out the sci-fi, works the brain and reads like a book.  Can't put this down.  I recommend this from ages 10 to 70.  I'm 55 and love this game!
1423140605|4.0|Rick Riordan has done it again. He again explores ancient mythology in an interesting and engaging manner. In this new series for middle school age and up he explores the myths and stories of Ovid's Metamorphosis.
B00908DDZM|5.0|Bought it for the thrift and listen to the whole CD constantly. He has a lot to say about equality for everyone. Great CD recommend to anyone no matter what you normally listen to.
B00B6OEDS4|2.0|These folks focus on contralto voices with very smooth transitions.  They surprised me,with their musicianship which flows with ease through passages that delight and relax the listener.  I was very surprised, you will be too.
B0091REZMW|3.0|The rules of play for this game are difficult to determine. There are also bugs: for example, I was told that I have a collection to charge, except I can't charge it. sometimes I can't stop the wandering critters or open a room I've been to before. one night I couldn't change floors. this could be due to my first gen Fire. I think some of the items are absurdly hard to find. and sometimes I have to press on an item three or four times before it will disappear. very frustrating, but otherwise fun to play.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Definitely for adolescents.  I found it refreshing that many characters were good, supportive people, which is rare in books targeted towards this population.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Great for a quick, fat burning workout when pressed for time. I'm a runner and in fairly good shape and this video still challenged me- it felt great! Jillian Michaels is a great trainer and doesn't let up- which is exactly the purpose of the entire workout. Highly recommend for all!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This second in the series book was better than the first.  It wasn't all about the playroom and revealed more about everyone involved.  If you read the first and thought this isn't for me, give the second book a try -- you will love it!
B00BJA2VFW|3.0|Cute game but more for children...but it was free and its a good time filler, my grand kids enjoy it
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This was an eye opener.  It was so descriptive and much more deeper than what I expected. Once you finish this book you will be more than ready to move on to the next!!!
6305609691|5.0|This is one of the best movies of all time. My opinion, if you get Apocalypse Now: Redux, It kind of slows down the movie. Get the original one.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Lots of fun.  My grandson is very much entertained by it because he gets to make his own decisions about what to buy.
B0091REZMW|3.0|good game. hard to see objects,  rooms are shown too small. enlarging them cuts down on visable area. just started playing. hope I improve.
B004UID2LC|5.0|need a song just search and it there love this app it is by far the best ive downloaded love that you save the songs
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I am a huge My Little Pony fan! I absolutely LOVE  this game! True, really young children might accidentally spend money on it. But, if you think about..if someone young enough to do that, should be supervised to play this game. It's a fun game, and shows the story of the actual show perfectly with just enough game. Just believe me, it's a really good game!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|As the book is the last in the series, it completes the story and did so very well.  The Hunger Games trilogy was an easy read and very enjoyable.  I recommend it to all.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|I was lollipop mad it ended so fast took me a few hours to read.....can't wait for the next one.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I can play this for hours on end.  Love the challenge !  But the only bad about this game is it keeps me from my work,.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is a good game it's fun and awesome game it is addicting I bet other kids love this game and this is my review
B0063IH60K|4.0|Plays well... I am addicted.  I like all kinds of games and this one is especially good.  I would recommend
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is an amazing game I love it fun for every one :)<br /><br />It will entertain kids or yourself you'll have a blast have fun with this game
B00881PTRC|4.0|It plays well.  Love the challenge.  Can sit and play it for hours.  And whats more it is free and keeps me entertained.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it. Its addictive but yet perfect. I play when not busy. I reccomend it for people 3 and up because my 4 your old can play it just as well as me
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Beautiful story of regret, heartbreak and redemption.  Constructed with a flow and precision reminiscent of the classics.  Moved to my core. Bravo!
0345803507|1.0|I read the first book because I wanted to participate in the office dialog. the second because I heard it was better, and the third because I was looking for something fluffy to read while recovering from foot surgery.  and it was given a rating of 4+ stars, so o.k.<br /><br />I was 400 pages into it, and still waiting for the plot. Agree with all reviews that state this would have been better with an editor. and the sex was quite boring.. repetitive. at one point, I thought to myself, it is impossible to work an 8 hour day, get any sleep, run away from the bad guys, fight w each other and have that much mind-blowing sex, unless the trysts in one day unless they were confined to 15 minutes or less.<br /><br />The book was given 4+ stars, however one thing I noticed when re-reading the reviews tonight. Most of the reviews I read w 5 stars had 1 or 2 comments. while the 1-2 star reviews had up to 70 comments echoing &#34;what they said&#34;. Gives me a new perspective on Amazon reviews!<br /><br />on the plus side, I read most of the book while coming off the painkillers, so was thankful I didn't have to think too much.<br /><br />oh, and btw- if you do read the book and enjoy it.... avoid the epilogue. it will only lower your opinion.<br /><br />Simplypeg
B000MKD9P6|5.0|This has become one of my favorite movies of all time.  I watch it over and over and over again.  I truly love this movie.  Everyone needs to see it at least once and then they will be hooked as I am with it
B009LMTDL0|2.0|Just could not get into her head in the book. . She is<br />Much younger than I but clearly did not hear the messages  I did from my mom and others- both men and woman  in my life --who never said \\" you cannot\\" to me.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This is a great game I think lots of people would like it. It's a amazing game. You know you want it u can have it. The part o didn't like WAS it cost money but the rest is fun it's worth paying 00.99 cents
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|I was at this show in '88, and I remember it well. That, plus the part 3 of the band's history and the inclusion of &#34;12 Wasted Years&#34; make this a must-have for Maiden fans.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game!!!!!! I especially like survival mode. Once I knew what it was,and started playing it, I just kept on going!!
B002MTTZ5I|5.0|If you like 80's heavy metal, and sex of course, you will love this album.  Every song on it jams!
B0067TQQI8|5.0|The Anker battery pack is working as intended. My wife is in sales. Each day, she spends hours either talking or responding to email so her phone is usually complaining about running on a low battery. Maybe if Siri would talk less ...  :)  I also carry one for my phone, because angry birds can be hard on battery life.<br /><br />My wife now has multiple Anker products for a variety of her days. On a normal day she carries a lipstick battery in her purse. While traveling she carries the 8400 in her luggage and the<br />lipstick battery in her purse. Now at the end of the day we can actually have a conversation instead of \\"battery dying, call you later.\\" I miss my wife enough when on the road, but the battery packs now make her trips a bit easier. Can't you see their next marketing promotion \\"Good communication and Anker battery packs are a key to a healthy marriage.\\"  Ha!<br /><br />I had to place a second order for the charger because I can be a bonehead at times and did not read. Boneheads aside we are enjoying our Anker products.<br /><br />From what I can tell the company actually cares about their customers and their products. Now, I gotta go --- laptop battery running low!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Game of thrones is a great story, long but great. The characters draw you in and leave you wanting more. This series is not for children.
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|Paul Anka has outdone himself.  This cd is better than Michael Buble's new cd in my opinion.  The new arrangements of all the songs he originally wrote are wonderful and I particularly like &#34;She's a Lady&#34; with Tom Jones.  Fun for me.  I like who he chose to sing with and I hope he does more cd's like this.  I don't think Anka has ever been given the recognition he deserves.  All of the wonderful songs he has writtten span years and years.  Thanks for the memories.
B0002J4X1Q|4.0|Yes, this movie has technical and script flaws but the action, fear factor and (Alice) Milla Jovovich make that all go away.  This is pure action/science fiction/horror with a capital \\"E\\" = escapism, excess, evil, and eye-popping.  It is beneath it all an amped-up zombie movie with an evil 'big brother' (The Umbrella Corporation)twist thrown in for good measure.  This film is more horror than the sequels.  This first film in a series sets one up for where this is heading, a futuristic world being manipulated by an evil conglomerate.  The plot is this, someone has released the T-virus in the underground labs of the Umbrella Corporation.  The only none survivors are Alice (Milla Jovovich)and Spence parks (James Purefoy), the 'married' security officers. A special rescue/security team (led by Colin Salmon and Michelle Rodriguez) takes them and a 'police officer'Matt Addison played by Eric Mabius with them into the underground Racoon City complex.  There, they must deal with the super computer, the 'Red Queen; (voiced by Sophie Vavsseur)- the daughter of the computer's inventor and designer, the former complex staff turned zombies by the T-virus , zombie doberman dogs and mutants.  Along the way, they discover betrayal, an eco-advocacy/terrorism plot and corporate greed. In the lead role of Alice, Ms. Jovovich shines as the initially confused and drugged security officer who slowly realizes her role in this tragedy and is able to deal with the evil that exists all around her.  She comes out the hero but is soon at the mercy of the Umbrella Corporation which designates her as ''Project' Alice and the other survivor, Matt Addison as Project 'Nemesis.'
B00BIVN82M|4.0|I think &#34;Crazy Love&#34; is better than this cd.  I am puzzled as to why Buble keeps singing Sinatra (which he does well).  There are plenty of other artists songs which I know he could turn into magic.  And why he chose to sing &#34;Something Stupid&#34; with Reese Witherspoon is beyond me.  The songs he wrote and sings on the cd are good.  I hope his next cd doesn't repeat Sinatra so much.
0767834739|4.0|Resident Evil: Apocalypse manages to be a better action movie than the original.  The movie picks up a few weeks after the end of the first. The action sequences dominate this movie.  'Project' Alice (Milla Jovovich) really breaks out in this sequel.  She awakens stronger by virtue of being injected with the T-virus in the Racoon City Research Center.  We see her being monitored before being released by the conniving Major Cain.  Outside, Project Alice  is confronted with a ravaged Racoon City (seen at the edn of the first movie) and takes up arms.  Alice is now is full at war mode against the zombies and eventually Major Cain and The Umbrella Corporation.  Along the way, she uncovers more lies and betrayal as she wages a war against the evil conglomerate.  There is a side story about the renegade police officer, Jill Valentine and the attempts to rescue Angie Ashford (who has good health thanks to the T-virus injected into her bu her crippled father, Dr. Ashford.  This film provides more background on Alice and the Umbrella Corporation.  There are some good supporting characters in L.J., Carlos, Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) & little Alice Ashford (Sophie Vavasseur) (AKA as the voice of the 'Red Queen' (The Umbrella Corporation's supercomputer).  The villains are Major Tom Cain played by Thomas Kretschmann and Dr. Isaacs played with gusto by Iain Glen. The anti-hero, Dr. Ashford (the designer of the 'Red Queen') is played well by Jared Harris. All these characters help the story line and provide more background into the movie.  The battle between Project Alice and Nemesis (an acquaintance of Alice's) is very good. The twist ending is good and tells you there is more afoot.  I enjoyed this action movie with zombies thrown in for good measure. PS, the zombie dobermans are back for another bite.  Overall, this is a very good action/science fiction film with some scary moments.
B00066FBQG|5.0|I got this for my daughter and her boyfriend.  My wife and I grew up with great movies like Cool Hand Luke and Three Days of the Condor, but this generation did not.  So the response from both of them was how neat it was to see a movie with great acting and storytelling, instead of Friday the 13th, Freddie Kruger crap.  I think a whole new generation is ready to see old movies as hip.  Still highly recommend, from the day I saw it in the theater.
B001P7HUF0|4.0|Love the story line. Young, shy attorney takes on a big insurance company and wins a huge amount for the deceased man's family. It has action and humor. Both of the main characters are great. If you like seeing the &#34;good guys&#34; win, this is a movie for you.
B005OCFGTO|3.0|The movies all showed up in great condition and delivered very fast. Although when I recieved the case it was cracked and missing pieces. All the movies are fine though snd thats the important part.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|The series is brilliant.  I am a big fan of the SCI HD channel.  I wasn't all that great in science, but I always enjoyed it.  It is wonderful to see a series that incorporates many of the concepts being explored by science into a presentation to the masses.  It is an extremely interesting series.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|Good cd
B0014YPEI4|5.0|A very great dino with the features on him and the texture of his skin. He is a great teaching tool for my grandsons when the play with him. The size is large and because of &#34;Papo's&#34; size ratio of 1/40 it is easy to understand how large he is compared to other Dinos.
B00683JLXA|2.0|No originality but entertaining and funny sound effects. It would have been nice if it was a new concept but might as well call it Angry birds ninja edition.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|As a daughter who dealt with a parent who lost her memories, I found this book difficult to start reading. But I hung in there and could not put it down until I had completed reading the story. Totally captivating with lots of suspense and mystery. Perfect ending.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I could only think of the movie What Happens in Vegas with Cameron Diaz and Ashton Kutcher. I'm a sucker for any love story which is why this gets 3 stars. It just wasn't anything amazing.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Meryl Streep is one of my favorite actresses and I love all of her pictures.  The movie was entertaining and funny and I liked it. I think most adults will love it.
0451450523|5.0|This work resonates with the power and poetry of a classic, a slim masterpiece. I know of no one who has read The Last Unicorn who hasn't fallen in love with it. Get it. Read it. Be transfixed and transported to a place of magic.
B00881PTRC|5.0|This is the cleverest game of hangman!  The graphics are so entertaining.  I would definitely recommend this game to everyone.
B00B5JBZGS|5.0|This album has not disappointed! If anything, I'd say it's right on par with 'As Daylight Dies', although more mature in a way. This is what a band sounds like when in its prime. When the drummer, bassist, guitarists, and vocalist are so well practiced they can create whatever they want and everything they touch turns to gold. I listen to Killswitch at work and when I jog at night and it's like sonic caffeine. I'm 39 years old so I need any edge I can get. My wife and kids hate Killswitch. Killswitch music is not intended for housewives and small children, or the elderly.
B000O14VAU|5.0|Don't usually watch this type of movie, but this is so well done.  I watched all of them. And then bought all of them.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|How many life of pi books are there? Perhaps it was my mistake thinking the cover was connected to the story of a boy in a boat with a tiger. This book is more a lecture on religion.
B00456PKG4|5.0|Would watch it more than once.  It has something for everyone.  Have watched it many times now.  Would purchase this one.
B00CJ6Q1GU|4.0|I'm a huge fan of the movies but never read the books.  I've watched Manhunter so many times, I practically have the entire script in memory.  So I was unsure how the two leads, Hugh Dancy and Mads Mikkelsen, would fill the roles of Will Graham and Hannibal Lector.  To me, Will Graham will ALWAYS be William L. Peterson and Lector will ALWAYS be Anthony Hopkins.  I just didn't see how you could replace those two characters!<br /><br />But, when I watched, I was surprised.  Mikkelsen does a fantastic job creating his own image of Lector.  He's not the Hopkin's or Brian Cox's Lector -- but he's not trying to be (which is a smart move!).  As far as Dancy's portrail of Graham, I'm still unsure.  Clearly the writers have created a more fragile Will Graham than in Manhunter or Red Dragon so I kind of miss that charater a bit.  Hopefully, as time passes he'll build up some tougher skin and learn to deal with his deamons a bit better.  It should be interesting to see.  I really like the sleep walking bit; nice touch!  Regarding Lawrence Fishburn's portrayal of Jack Crawford, I think this was a good move, too.  While I really liked Dennis Farina playing of the character, I did not like Harvey Kietel's.  I think Fishburn will do nicely.<br /><br />The series seems to really be taking shape in just the first four episodes that were available when writing this.  I am really looking forward to how it progresses.  I know we all can't wait until Lector's true identity becomes known but we have to remember that when it happens, it will be the beginning of the end of the series.  I also like the idea of flipping the sexes of Dr. Bloom and Freddie Lowns.  And the overall modernization of the franchise (taking place in 2013 and not the 1980's) will prove interesting given the huge advances in forensic science.<br /><br />I've rated the series as 4-stars (5-star TV show ratings are reserved for shows like \\"The Wire\\" or \\"Babylon 5\\") and hope NBC renews it for a second season and more.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This app is awesome. It works great with no trouble what's so ever. I highly recommend app to everyone. Best app out there for music videos.
B007R6X9IK|4.0|I am a die hard Mark Lanegan fan and of his past work with Soulsavers. So when I heard they were now working with Dave Gahan I was a bit skeptical. I don't have anything against Depeche Mode, just not my thing. Well, I was pleasantly surprised! His voice and songwriting match perfectly with Soulsavers. Check it out!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This book is full of twists and surprises. Again and again events seem to be at their worst, with no hope of redemption.  Five stars if the language were cleaned up.
B00APKIN1I|5.0|But coming from Dave Grohl and the rest of the Foo Fighters along with special guests, what did you expect?
B002RKRTGO|1.0|Confusing missing pieces of the book  missing punctuation<br />Age 12+ just for format sorry  sir Arthur Conan Doyle no hard feelings
B0091V6TF4|5.0|Great mix of the 007 Bond music. Would have liked a little more variety on the additional instrumentals but overall it is great.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best horse game invented.  I love the game My Horse. If you get a chance get the game.MUST HAVE GAME!!
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|I found this game very difficult to play.  I could not seem to get it to work properly. Will not be wasting my time on this one.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|It was well written and the characters were well defined. I would recommend it to anyone. It was a look at a time in history that I was unaware of.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is great I live in the country so there is no steady cell signal now I can watch my videos with no buffering!
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This game is awesome. I love card games and this one's the best. I can't wait for updates. I can actually delete thus GAME off my kindle unlike Dragon Hunter 3. This game is good.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Amazing book. Carries a lot of emotion and joy. Shows how a few simple events can save ones life. Great book.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I enjoyed this book. I am from SC so the setting alone intrigues me. I would visit Gatlin.....if it existed. I like that the book takes place in SC. The story is very well written.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Lately, I've read too many highly recommended award winners that haunt me. The beauty of this novel is that hope reigns. McKenna doesn't gloss over the realities of that horrible institution still she situated it in the multiple lived realities as well. I closed the book glad I'd read it AND will enjoy thinking of these characters long after.
0061801313|5.0|I love this show so I wanted to read the books. They are semi short and easy to read, The story line is different from the show so it keeps my interest.

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|\\"Wild\\"  is a personal account yet has common themes that is part of our human predicament.  When I read this book it was like looking into a mirror.  Beautifully written.  Honest.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|Tokens are very expensive. Games often hang up and tokens are then lost. Guaranteed second chance is a lie. Game pieces cannot be all collected even after 100 cards!! What a rip off!!!!!
B005K17RU0|1.0|LOVED the original version! Can't figure out why it was necessary to &quot;fix&quot; this app. Previous version had all the info you could ask for.  It was presented well, easy to navigate, the color layout was easier on the eyes...etc. I used this app constantly being employed in the transportation industry and was able to access my list of locations and get accurate up to the minute weather info as well as extended weather info in a matter of seconds at any one of ten or fifteen locations I had saved. Which by the way did &ntilde;ot transfer to updated version. Short story long...VERY DISSATISFIED
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This novel gave a lot of information on those bouquets we all buy at our florists shop...however, now, after this read, one may pick the varieties with more forethought!

Acaveda and Mackey engage in a battle of wits for control of the helm with a host of interesting characters swirling around. The Shield is a MUST-SEE for anyone who loves good tv!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This one goes nowhere. I enjoyed the first two books much more. Now I hope to read something a bit more upbeat.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|It is amazing how many times this cute app can figure out which character you are thinking of with a minimum of questions! Well worth the price!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I bought this for my daughter in law for Christmas Dec. 25, 2012.  She is very happy with it.  It seems I made a good choice for her.
B002IUKBJU|5.0|I brought this dvd for a friend and he loves his musicals and this dvd is one of his favourites.
0399226907|5.0|Very very cute book for children.  I like giving my grandchildren and great grandchildren books for special occasions.  They love reading them and being read to.
B0053O89IS|4.0|i think this is another great season from bones just feel that is was a lot shorter than the other seasons.
B0007MWZEK|2.0|The Battery for the Swivel Sweeper lost it charge very quickly.  This continues to happen after many uses after charging.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|As with all AMC top shelf shows, &#34;Story Matters&#34;. Zombies are only the condition they live with. The real story is the characters, their evolution and interaction. Start with season one and work your way to the end of Season 3 you'll be glad you did.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|THE HUNGER GAMES is one of those films that can interpreted a million different ways. . . or can just be just watched for pure entertainment. Excellent cinematography, costume design, and soundtrack along with a very unique storyline help to create a really memorable screen experience. The acting-in-general is contrived and overly perfecto, and there are definitely a few holes and cop-outs in the plot. Yet, THE HUNGER GAMES is so one-of-a-kind that its flaws, some of which might be ruinous in a lesser film, are quite forgiveable.<br /><br />All the same, there are ways that THE HUNGER GAMES might have been better; e.g., it would have been nice to see more virtually created creature phenomena such as  the were-pitbulls (or whatever they are)toward the end. Another thing: Considering the brutality of the premise, what actually happens during the \\"game\\" is fairly tame. Having said that, I'm not sure how it would have worked better--It certainly would NOT have been enhanced by creating a horrific \\"It's either me or you\\" gore-fest. It often descends into sentimental, politically correct, teeny-bopperish romance, but just when things start to get too maudlin, new things come up.<br /><br />I am sure that this film does not do complete justice to the book trilogy, which I have not read but am now very eager to read. The mere fact that the movie made me (and I'm sure many others) want to read the books speaks for itself.
0143036270|4.0|The Meditations, per se, are without equal. The translation is crisp and clean as is the physical printing and appearance. Everyone should have a copy of Meditations in their personal library and this example is excellent.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A gripping tale that keeps your interest throughout.  The writing was so realistic,that many times I thought I was reading a true life story.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Okay, it is not bad but I simply do not like the storyline of this third season all that much.
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|I just purchased one of these so I could practice in the evenings when I come home from work without disturbing the rest of my family or having to setup my amps and pedals.  At first I was skeptical but once I plugged it in and attached my headphones I was amazed how great this pocket amp sounds for such a small device.  The sound is great and the tones are adjustable (the only thing you don't get is a \\"clean\\" sound). It's small size makes it perfect for being able to practice anywhere since you are not tied to your amp with cables. I even tried it with my bass and it gave it a nice metal style distortion.  Based on my experience with this one I will be ordering the Bass amPlug from Vox next.
B00A6J9SM6|5.0|I'm an avid Excel user and I picked up Rob's book on Powerpivot as essentially an introduction to the software. I've been hooked ever since, and the book is much more than just a primer. I've been referring back to it often for some of the tips and tricks that he teaches and have been able to do things with data and reporting that were extremely difficult or impossible to do with just Excel.
B0025UHKNS|3.0|I do not love the bezel or the band. I miss my Garmin 305. But for the price it does do the job.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Really enjoy the different layouts. Love the colors. Especially enjoy the &quot;shuffle&quot; feature, I don't feel like a loser. I like that the layouts also state the amount of tiles so you can start with a small amount of tiles and build yourself up.
B001VS46DC|5.0|Wonderful concert! Diana Krall is a musical genius and this concert was superbly recorded. And what a terrific rhythm section!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book told a beautiful story and was written so brilliantly.  Markus Zusak brings you right back to Himmel street with Lisel and Rudy. I would recommend this book for mature minds. It was wonderful and I can't wait until I feel the need to read it again.
B00881PTRC|5.0|Easy game that we all have played with a cartoon that develops as you suss it out.  Caution-you can get anxious when the cartoon character is in eminent danger of falling through the trap and you have not figured it out yet.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I love playing this game but am having trouble getting updates for the Kindle Fire.  It would really be nice to be able to receive them.  Any suggestions?
B00BEJ5O6Q|5.0|Another great cd by blake shelton!!!! Ready for a new cd! Blake has the best all aaround music that truely anyone can listen to
B0030E5NLE|5.0|I really enjoy this album and have listened to it often.  If you are up for a little change of pace with your blues then you will probably like this, too.  I also purchased the companion &#34;We're New Here&#34; that adds more of the electronic beat and re-imagines some of the songs.<br /><br />Excellent sound quality.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|Excellent quality of movie , I love the sound and high definition  .. 5 stars !! I would like to recommend to anyone ... You must need see this one.!!

1457514508|4.0|In a small, upper middle class, Savannah, Georgia neighborhood lies bitchery, trickery, and enough drama to run a season of reality television. Behind this drama are four, older women, who pride themselves with poking their noses into everyone's lives, scheming behind each others back, and a nice cocktail at the park every afternoon at four, while the dogs frolic around. That is until the demise of poor Thelma, wife of Elliot, Mayoral candidate. Upon her death, her supposed two best friends unleash their cat claws to sink them into poor grieving Elliot, even before Thelma's body has hit the dirt.<br /><br />\\"Now you be careful, \\" said Cindy as Carla's lips touched the rim of her cup. \\"Don't you be smudging your beautiful lipstick. Is that a new shade, honey? It's so red it's almost scarlet.\\"<br /><br />As the neighbors darkest secrets unravel beneath them, unbeknownst to them all is there is a killer amongst them. Will it be Carla, the ex-showgirl who had a boob job within days of Thelma's death? Heidi, who has a secret room nobody, even her servant has ever entered? Or how about Kelly who just won a dream vacation to Paris and $25,000 cash she is hiding from her hot and sizzling fireman husband, Tom? Or one of the plethora of neighbors who always seem to cross paths while walking their dog in the park?<br /><br />While I'll read any book put in front of me, I generally don't pick up this dark satirical style of reading, and I am unsure why as I could hardly put this book down. It didn't have real action, or suspense, or really anything to shocking (like the normal books I read)  until up until the very end. However, it did grab me and suck me in with the bitchery, slyness, and unique character roles all vital to wrapping this story into a delicious treat that I was eager to eat up and search for more. If you're looking for a change of pace from your typical reading material, or just wanting a fresh spin on writing, Duncan Whitehead will definitely fill your plate full and have you craving more.<br /><br />Pick up your copy today!<br />[[ASIN:B00AHHODH2 The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club]]ull and have you craving more.<br /><br />Pick up your copy today!<br />[[ASIN:B00AHHODH2 The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club]]
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|My husband, myself, my friends, my grandson...we're all hooked! A wonderful story as only the Brits can do! My only caveat: my husband said we HAD to go to Highclere Castle (where it is filmed) and it was a great disappointment. Expensive, not in good shape, the gardens a mess! Go to some other wonderful stately home instead. If you DO go to see the Castle, particularly avoid the extra charge for the &#34;Egyptian&#34; exhibit, as that is a total rip-off!
B009Y6OIWC|3.0|Bought this for my Kindle Fire. Had a hard time getting it to work.  It might be ok, if I can do that. Just not easy to work with.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|You need to love Tarantino, but everyone I know has really enjoyed this film Everyone is great and the Best Supporting Oscar well deserved!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I am rlly pleased with this app. We were on vacation an  has to get up rlly early and this worked great. The weather part was also so cool. I had fun with that part. All in all this was a great app.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The movie had a great story-line that kept me interested , the effects were incredible, and Suraj Sharmas performance was great. What else can I say?
B0030F5W5K|5.0|Just watched \\"Ghost\\" again for the first time in many years. Love this movie!! My daughter watched it for the first time and loved it as well!
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I pick 4 stars because a dictionary is a dictionary which is boring but its  it really alot of reading
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love the size of a Kindle calculator.  Some reviews are mocking it due to simplicity, but swipe the memory keys and there are additional functions.  Not a scientific calculator, but this ain't highschool calculus, my friend.<br />Love it!
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|What a concept. It scares me and entices me. There is a lot of plot set up. Enjoy the ride
B007TXN4TK|5.0|My toddler as well as myself love this game!  It is great for all ages.  I dont mind him playing this game for as long as he wishes.  It keeps his attention and he loves to making music.  I love to play this cause it makes me feel like I have a hidden talent as master pianist.  It is simple and fun and it doesn't have an annoying sound if you mess up a note.  It is really a GREAT APP!
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|Great performance, but hard to root for a character who is such a sad sack. Great visuals, great dramatic portrayal of catastrophe. But left with a &#34;so what&#34; sensibility after all is said and done.
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|This game surprised me!  I really enjoyed the complex nature of this simple game.  You can build a bridge with different supplies and then you send either cars or trucks (for a bigger bonus) over to get points.  There are lots of different ways to build it and lots of different ways to get points, so its either as easy or as difficult as you would like. Overall great fun!
B002MG2ATY|5.0|The guiding principal is as usual &#34;follow the money&#34;.  Kevin Costner was relentless in his pursuit of the &#34;truth&#34;.  So many colorful characters were included.  The best scene was between Donald Sutherland and Coster.  Listen carefully.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|The 3-disc symphonic recording might feel more \\"complete\\" because of its length, but this is the most complete cast.  Must-own.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This film portrayed the experiences of a family during and after the tsunami that hit Thailand.  My husband and I were exhausted after watching this. We both also had dreams about this the same night we watched.  So if you want to leave your reality for a while this is the movie.  The actors were superb.
B005C9YZIW|1.0|I bought this for my birthday this year as i've had my eye on it. I got it last night and decided to open it.. First thing I notice was disc one was damaged. As I checked the rest I found every disc had scratches on it ranging from minor where it will make the bluray skip, to full on freezing and not being able to read the disc. I don't know if this was bought, used, and then repackaged for sale as new or not but that's what it seems like to me. Why they would have significant scratches on arrival for a new product is beyond me.
B0001EKZOQ|5.0|This guy is one of the great song writers of the 20th century & I'd never heard of him.  Ignorant me!  And his seemingly plain, untrained voice is memorable, leaving me humming (no one will tolerate my singing) these songs that I've heard others do.  What a discovery for anyone!
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Good plot, well-written characters, Reic<br />h.  scores again.  Up in the far north, Tempe once again beats everyone else to the solving of the case with lots of twisting plots and schemes.
B009KYXEY6|5.0|Not sure what everyone is complaining about, I got my copy of the Paradise Edition, and all the bonus tracks were present.<br /><br />Great record, and the bonus Paradise album is even better! Love Lana. Buy this.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|Excellent photography, plus it was filmed in my home town &#34;San Francisco&#34;<br />Very good story line, with a 'Human Touch' Highly recommend same!<br />Surprise ending, keeps you on the edge.  Believable – with todays science !
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game so much. It is my favorite games out of all of the games out there. I wish I could get more chips to play With. I am so addicted!
B005Q1W10A|3.0|Killing-off the main characters was too much. What was once great 'Theatre' has not turned into<br />an 'American TV Soap Opera' – purchased the first three seasons, but won't waste my money or<br />time on any more.  New characters are very childish and ultra 21st Century.<br />Thanks, but No Thanks for any more.
B0090P98Z4|1.0|It causes my kindle fire to crash and makes it take for ever to reaboot it did this twice! don't get this app unless you want your kindle fire (not HD) to crash.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Excellent Motion Picture.  You want to believe in the word &#34;HOPE&#34;, but I don't.<br />At least NOT in today's world. Very moving emotional story, with a 'Disney Ending'<br /><br />Unable to find 'WHO': &#34;Allen Greene&#34; ... In Memory Of was/ at end of film.<br />GOOGLE is very frustrating on this one ... somebody they don't know about ?<br />Also, is this story 'fiction' or based on a true prison... wouldn't doubt it.
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|I never got a chance to watch this when it originally aired so I was thrilled when I found it on Amazon instant video. This show makes you think and leaves you guessing with each plot twist. Sure, you can analyze it and figure out what will happen next, but that defeats the point of watching. I just really enjoyed all 8 seasons.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|Fun enjoy getting to each new pet all of them so adorable. It would be great if more pets could be added like turtles or even make the hedgehog a collect able.
0596009208|2.0|First of all this isn't a how-to book, anyone without some prior knowledge of programming will immediately get lost after page 19 or so, On top of that, a lot of the humor and \\"fun\\" is very distracting and chaotic, puzzles and such tend to take away from the focus of what the book is trying to teach. It jumps from one thing to the next without really describing or going into detail what they actually mean. I only recommend this book as a companion or a refresher text to an actual more extensive java textbook.
B005Q186DQ|5.0|These Crocs are very nice because they're a bit more dressy than the regular ones giving me a bit more flexibility i  where I can wear them.
B00AQM8H9I|4.0|This free app of the day is fun on my Kindle Fire.  It has graphics with funny animations.  For example, one of the penguins wears ear muffs that fly off of his head into the air when he gets attacked.  The colors are very bright and eye-catching, and seem to pop off the screen.  And the music is bouncy, but unobtrusive.<br /><br />I'd never heard of the board game, so I can't compare the app to the board game.  So far, however, the app reminds me a bit of the board game, \\"Risk,\\" in which you isolate territories and try to take over the world.  Instead of the war-based theme of \\"Risk,\\" however, \\"Hey, That's My Fish!\\" is based on penguins competing over a limited number of fish so they can stay alive as long as possible.  When they run out of fish to eat, they get eaten by the sharks.  The app is also played at a much faster pace than \\"Risk,\\" which can drag on for hours.  So it's like a cute, animated version of \\"Risk.\\"  Here's a link to Risk, if you aren't familiar with it: [[ASIN:B004MRZGC4 Risk]]<br /><br />There are a lot of game options.  You can play two-, three-, or four-player games, and you can also set up any, all or none of your opponents (players) to be the computer.  The skill level can be set to easy, normal or hard.  The ice disappears as the penguins move around.  You have to be careful not to get stranded, because the sharks are right there, waiting to feast on your helpless little penguins when they haven't got any moves left.  You also get to select the pattern (or style) of the ice flow for the beginning of the game.  The more difficult patterns have more blocks of ice missing at the beginning of the game. You also get to compete for achievements.  As you get better, more difficult levels get unlocked.<br /><br />The game doesn't quite make it to five stars for two reasons.  First, the opponent penguins move around the board so quickly that you aren't able to follow their moves, and I haven't found a way to slow them down (or replay the action), either.  With all of the options on the screen, the action can be a little hard to follow. Second, the names of the achievement levels aren't consistent or logical.  (Since this is a game based on logic, I found that odd.)  The first three achievements are named after types of fish (guppy, minnow, sardine), and the next two are game-strategy related (clever and scheming).<br /><br />Luckily, a single person can play against the computer, so I'll have something to pass the time while riding on public transportation to work.  The game has been easy to learn, but the harder levels will keep me interested.  A good challenge always provides a lot of fun, so I'm looking forward to mastering this game.  And it was free today, too.  What a deal!ither.  With all of the options on the screen, the action can be a little hard to follow.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the most succcessful tv series ever made. It gives the viewers a real  and accurate insight into an age gone by. The production in everyway is superb, the designe is amazing and it is a wonderful experience to visit &#34;Hycleer Castle&#34; which becomes Downton Abbey in the series. As the creator and writer of the series, Julian Fellows gives us an insight into a true aristocratic lifestyle - to which he belongs.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Everything I could have wanted in the conclusion of one the best series I've ever read. I couldn't fall asleep at night and almost missed work twice because I just could not put it down.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I love this game!! One of my favorites!! From the excitement of hearing the bubbles touch and seeing them fall; a realitive matching game with good aim and<br />even some trick shots will help you!
B002GYS1FO|5.0|This CD is great. I purchased it because it has the theme song of one of my favorite shows, &#34;Strike Back&#34;! And I discovered that there are a lot of other good songs on the CD as well!
B005EHILV4|5.0|this board is great for the budding music enthusiast. I use it for recording commentary on videos and it works great. I can easily take it around if I need to do a little traveling. I have it capture a mic and my game audio and pipe it directly into the recording program. It completely removes the audio cleanup step from post production.
B005LAIGP0|5.0|I really enjoyed this  movie. It kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie.I hadn't seen him in any movies except the Harry Potter movies but Daniel Radcliffe was excellent in his performance!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It may be a book for adolescents but this senior citizen couldn't put it down.  Parallels to the culture we live in are very apparent
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|Paramore really went above and beyond on this album, the fact that they can completely change their style and still keep us satisfied is an amazing feat. I have a new found love and respect for the group. It legitimizes them as artists, rather then just a band. My favorite track is &#34;Hate To See Your Heart Break&#34;, because it is such a change up and Haley's voice is wonderful. She is a great vocalist, and hot as hell. I love the new direction, keep up the great work guys...
B0002IQJUK|5.0|This is my favorite Gavin DeGraw CD by far. I love all of his music and also how he's evolved as a musician/songwriter - but I keep coming back to Chariot. Gavin is so talented and he's a natural performer. I highly recommend this CD in particular. Oh, and the stripped version is like an extra present that makes this purchase so worth it.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|Granted I am 72 so naturally like the standards the best and that is why I buy all of his stuff.  Not so crazy about the upbeat new things but I can understand he does not want to be pigenholed.  He is one of the very few saving the Great American Songbook so I will always support him and grateful for tracks like \\" Nevertheless\\" and \\"Young at Heart\\"

B00683JLXA|2.0|While not a terrible game, it is certainly NOT great. The launching is off; meaning sometimes you can grab and launch with no issue and other times, your screen just wants to move...even if you are clicking directly on the panda. My other problem with it is you can't rely on the arrows to tell you where and how fast your panda might hit. Sometimes it zooms and goes further than intended and sometimes, you hit where you weren't even aiming. I know that's a crap shoot even in Angry Birds but your chances of an accurate shot are much higher in that game. Kids might like it but my advice is, stick to Angry Birds.

B005GFPZYK|4.0|Very inlighting as to the life of a military sniper. He kept it very interesting and entertaining. I would recommend to anyone interested in learning more about military life and the war in Iraq.
B003IEJZUG|4.0|Like other shipwreck stories, except for the zebra, hyenna, and tiger.  Richard Parker, the Bengal tiger,a major character.  I can imagine a good movie being made of some of the scenes.  Teenager Pi, a likable youth, part Hindu, part Christian and lover of God.
B008Y73940|4.0|I thought that Matthew McConaughey did a superb acting job in this movie. The plot kept my interest. This movie was entertaining.

B00C5W3SBE|1.0|I have not even seen this movie, have been looking forward to the release-I am so glad to see SOOOO many other avid Disney fans completely outraged by their packaging for this movie-having to buy all copies SEPERATELY, I do not even own a 3D tv yet, I BARELY just bought a blu-ray player less than a month ago-BUT I have been already buying 3D and Blu-ray as many others have anticipating the upgrade one day.  I have been a Disney fan through and through since childhood and am now 36 and have upgraded my VHS collection, and I had the original Little Mermaid with the pee nis on the cover---Anyway now I got EVERYTHING on DVD and am AGAIN upgrading to Blu-ray and 3D-I like many many others are outraged that Disney has chosen to split all the copies up, and then to add insult to injury they offer neither at even a slightly discounted rate-I have been really looking forward to pre-ordering this in order to have in on my door step the DAY of release! but now :( until they come to their senses and release it in their 2,3,4, or even 5 dics sets, such as Monsters Inc. And Finding Nemo which I absolutely had to get even though my DVD copies are in perfect condition--they get you with that Vault don't they...but this is insane and I am so glad to see there are so many people that feel exactly the same way-with enough people with the exact same review and I am guessing if we could give it a 0 we would, and the fact that No ONE buys either blu-ray or 3D or probably even DVD, they'll find the one or two people who bought it and borrow it until they get this straigtened out! This makes me Grumpy and Beyond...
B009ZQHQ84|1.0|We didn't finish the movie.  After 5-10 minutes that movie just wasn't going anywhere.  What we did see was sort of a downer, so we went on to another movie.
B00B7PIRIE|3.0|Season three, disk one, part one, will not play.<br />This is my first DVD purchase on Amazon and I don't know how to resolve, getting a new disk.<br /><br />Just disappointed
B00AYQNOU8|5.0|We loved this movie.  The filming was great.  It really shows great use of time lapsed photography and filming of nature.  It was a great story that told of the circle of life, from birth to death, along with man and nature.
B009RX85N0|5.0|This season has taken new heights it explains the questions from the first season and answered them I love the Creativity of once upon a time. I have always loved fariy tales I like how the creators of this show have given snow white and prince charming a whole new story This show is Awesome because of that!!
B003FHGI9W|5.0|My wife and I enjoyed this movie.  The story was well told and held our interest for the duration. Would recomend it to others.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|It is a good series.  We have enjoyed watching it.  However, we didn't like the result for Matthew.  It may be nearing the end of its run.
B00AYB1GAS|5.0|We watched the movie SAMSARA first and loved it so searched for other movies by Ron Fricke.  This did not disappoint us.  He takes you to far away places on earth and really captures the spirit of the location.  The art is how he transitions from one location to the next to show the symmetry between man vs animal and nature vs man-mand.
B000VLOKQI|5.0|Wonderful.  Really enjoyed it.  Very good value for a low price.  (I paid only $6.19 for it.). Glad I got it.
B005HSL626|5.0|This is a great game for kids. My 5 year old grandson loves it. Don't hesitate to get it for your kids
B00ADHYEYI|1.0|The show is good, but I am finding that I am getting disconnected. Never had this problem with Netfilx or other digital media.
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|Indie...check!<br />Great songs...check!<br />Great music...check!<br />Feel-good feeling...check!<br /><br />I purchased this CD -- it's been so long since I've done that, thanks to downloading individual songs from iTunes or Amazon -- and I do not regret it. The whole CD is really good. My favorite song of course is \\"Sweater Weather,\\" which has been my ringtone since March. First heard their music, or that particular song, on Pandora and fell in love. Their music is feel-good. Makes you wanna drive down a road on a clear day in your car with a couple of friends with The Neighborhood's songs as the soundtrack. Much like the music video for \\"Sweater Weather\\" and their promos for the album.<br /><br />The Neighbourhood's sound is casual, yet relaxing from lead singer Jesse Rutherford's vocals. Their style is cool too, very California-esque. Also, their music videos are all black & white and the band, itself, give off that '50s style from clothes to hair.<br /><br />Their music is like a blend of Alternative with R&B flair and Rock. Songs like \\"Let It Go\\" and \\"W.D.Y.W.F.M?\\" are reminiscent of a bit of hip-hop and R&B.<br /><br />11 songs total and worth it. Can play it on repeat. Great album, \\"I Love You,\\" I love it.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|I had watched stargate sg-1 growing up and I was excited to find a series that could hold up to the original.!!
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|I have read this book several times and every time I find something new that I love!! I just hope the following books are just as good.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|Excellent movie perfect condition on arrival and arrived in specified time! I watch it all the time on TV and have read the book and its one of my favorites so I decided to purchase the DVD to have to watch all the time :)
B000QY9WOU|5.0|Show includes all of my favorite songs. Cher is so funny!!! I would recommend this show to all Cher fans.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|User friendly for every day type calculations.  Use it all the time.  Can not imagine anyone giving less than five stars.
B009NQLT0M|5.0|great fan quiet yet effective.<br />First time noctua user and i am sure i will be getting more of noctua fans.
0345803493|5.0|Second book in the series of 3. Keep you interested, could see the love story starting to bloom. A very entertaining read!
B006DRVFRQ|5.0|Since word of ending, have been trying other readers but none can compare.  Google Reader is so easy to use...look forward to reading blogs with ease...
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's a great App that I use on a daily bases, easy to read and share with others.  I would recommend this product.
B005LAIIHG|4.0|I enjoy this type of movie.  It was quite an adventure, which was well acted.  One felt they were really in the boat on the ocean with a tiger and other animals.  I liked the way it started and ended also.
B005IEGUDY|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. Makes you want to read the next book. So I read London and The New Forest!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|The story about Rodriguez is amazing.  So glad he is getting the long over due praise he so rightly has earned.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Perfect mix of a good story and all the mini games you could wish for in a hidden object game. The on and off zombie sequels are really good,too.
0802473164|5.0|I bought several of these as gifts for the men in my life.<br />Brothers, father, brothers-in-law and boyfriend.<br />I had read the other editions and found what Dr Chapman had to offer as timeless.  It helped me to better understand all the people in my life, not just relatives and partner.
0062238868|5.0|Well written, this is the autobiography of recently assassinated Navy Seal Chris Kyle.  The book is entertaining, with the proper amount of humor, and riveting as you want to keep reading to see what is coming next.  He shares just the right amount of personal information.
B007REV4YI|5.0|The movie was very good as are most Bond films.  Great special effects, especially with the car.<br />The blue-ray quality was as expected.  Loved having the digital version to upload to my other electronic devices.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Ben Affleck never was at the top of my actor list until this movie. He directed it to perfection and did am amazing job as as actor.
1881273873|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my two grown sons.  I found the material timeless and appropriate to all the people in your life, not just your love interest.
B00633W614|4.0|I found it slow in the beginning, but really did enjoy the book. Found that the sequel was pretty good too. Apparently a third book is coming out soon & planning on reading it too.
1575666286|3.0|Its more of a text book.  Gives thorough guidance to the program and the success it has had with various physical maladies.  Just haven't decided if it is for me
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|I enjoyed parts of the book very much.  It was very thick on description.  Taking over 400 pages to describe a few months was tedious.  I wanted to know more about the outcome of the father.  There was so much descriptionabout the landscape but no information as to why the mother thought sending her children to this unknown environment was a good idea.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I've been getting flat sick of downloading files to just be able to view them once.  I knew the files were taking up room on my kindle but I just couldn't get to them. I find this app through the help forum for someone who asked this same question. I absolutely love it and have put it in my favorites. I do a lot of gardening, so I want to keep a lot of documents for companion plants, seed starting dates, etc.  I don't want to print out everything....I mean that's why we get kindle 's, right?  Get this app, you won't regret it.  So easy to use and your files are in the download folder.
B000B7QCKO|5.0|got great service and loved the dvd when i received it would highly recommend. watched it a few times since i got it.
B000OVLBFS|4.0|I enjoy the trials and predicaments Jesse gets into and always manages to find a solution to the problem at hand.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Season ten has shown alot of flashbacks on the characters. The acters always keep the audience in suspense on what they would like to happen, but keeps you wondering. The actors that have been in the past eight years, should stay for season 11. I feel season ten has been just as good as season 7-8.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This outperforms the i7 (first gen) it replaced!  I strongly recommend the MSI board(s) for this CPU, as well.  They are very cost effective, and the drivers that come with the boards are very current.
B00111YM5G|1.0|I can't even believe I watched this all the way thru to the end... just curiosity, I guess, to see how it ended.  It's in my top 5 worst movies ever watched.  I love Prophecy and movies of that sort, but this one was absolutely a waste of time.  Overacting and bad acting galore, very slow moving...  I cannot recommend it.  Terrible movie.
B000XUBC5E|5.0|This is the third book that I have read from Harlan Coben.  I will continue to read his books.  A friend had this in paper back and she loved it, too.  I immediately downloaded it on my Kindle and couldn't put it down.
B004XQO8VO|4.0|Good story , acting ok  would have gave it 3 stars except for the  fact of watching Sandra bullock running around the whole movie  in tight pants , two thumbs up!
B009X01D9U|5.0|I just bought a Kindle FIre HD 8.9&#34; and wanted a case to protect it from the start.  This case is very well made and easy to use.  I love the strap on the inside cover that allows you to hold the kindle with one hand.  In addition, you can easily move the kindle to other positions, just in case you want it landscape or vertical.  The notches on the inside cover also allows you to &#34;lock&#34; in the angle so if you are watching a video or listening to a radio app, the kindle will not fall down.  I really like the color too, very bright, and allows you too see it and not sit on the kindle if you accidentally leave it on the couch.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love playing mahjong but for me this version is not as clear as some, the tiles are smaller. But I still enjoy my time scores not as fast.
6305128952|4.0|The acting is good and the story, quality.  I liked it when it was released and continue to like it now
B003NHRIVQ|1.0|Really enjoyed this movie as I do all Nicholas Sparks work.  The acting was good and it was almost as good as the book
B00AEFY08O|5.0|BluRay makes Forrest Gump come alive!  Who doesn't love &#34;the Gump&#34;.  Most people know the movie but this is the way to see it..........
B005S9EK5Y|1.0|The movie was terrific and so were the actors and singing.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and the music too.
B0014BQQYS|5.0|There is only one &#34;Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid&#34; and in Blu-ray it is even better than before.  Got to love it...
B000W4D94I|5.0|It is interesting to see what can happen when a tornado hits and that there are ratings for tornadoes depending on how much they destroy.  This film should make you take seriously taking cover whenever there is a siren.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|As the grandson of a WW2 Naval Officer I had yet to read a book of this nature. I can say this book opened my eyes to the horrors of war!  Sledge's honest account and distain for combat takes the romanticism out of battle and makes me truly grateful for service men and women who gave their lives so that my family can enjoy peace.<br />A must read for all who cherish freedom.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|I normally shy away from subtitled movies, as for me it take a bit of the involvement away. But I will promise you that if you don't get totally immersed, and laugh and cry, I'll give you your money back : )  You will love it.
B00A83075M|4.0|While it wasn't my favorite Disney movie, it was funny and worth watching.  It also has a nice wholesome message for kids.
B0012GMXSS|5.0|Amazing songs, not your regular grungy 1990s sound, some kinda low key and melancholic lyrics courtesy of Mr. Lanegan over a true american rock, clean sound with nuances of folky and heavy riffs in a gloomy atmosphere.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|Surprisingly entertaining.  New twist on an old theme - still this cast could make any movie amazing.  Had to buy it.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Movies are never as good as the books. The movie is fast paced and fun to watch. Worth gathering the family around and making some popcorn great fast paced movie.
B008393Q2O|3.0|OK, I'll admit I haven't messed with it tons, but for the few lists I have created, it is a little confusing when trying to get it to add new items.  If I get the hang of it, then it'll be handy.
8866130915|2.0|Its really small! might have been an oversight on my part but i was hoping for the size of about half a normal notebook not the size of a credit card. it makes it hard to write in. other then that its well constructed and i feel that it will last the whole year without breaking apart to much.
B00683JLXA|4.0|Just downloaded this and have played some of the first level.  I love the music and the sounds of the ninjas.  Other reviewers are correct, this is like Angry Birds with not as much throwing power.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It runs nice and clean haven't run into any problems<br />And it a game that makes time fly when you want it to
B003F3NDWG|4.0|Started with &#34;Firefly&#34; but one viewing of &#34;Castle&#34; hooked us.  Buying up all the available seasons so far.  Best when they keep the whimsy going.
B00571F26Y|4.0|A read for everyone interested in their own well being and basic nutrition. It truly astounded me with the basics this book present.
B003HLM2QO|4.0|ok I have been reading reviews on here good and negative.  Alot of the negative comments say that none of the songs are memorable or over mixed.  I have listened to the album several times and I think the mixing is great. As for memorable songs its still new.  Not brand new at this point.  But its not been out long enough for anyone to say oh wow that song was awesome in its time.  Now the title track \\"Scream\\" I'll bet it becomes a memorable song as far as popularity goes. He did after all play it live at the super bowl one year.  And I think the song is a pop song more then a ozzy classic I will give the na sayers their due on it.  It doesn't have meaning behind it.  Its more of a radio friendly jam to get people fired up.  Still nevertheless it is a good song. Not a great Ozzy classic but still it will one day be a classic. As for other tracks on the album I think alot of them have great meaning. Let it Die starts the album out with hard riffs and setting a darker tone for the beginning of the album while in the lyrics seeming to tell the listener to let all the baggage die.  Live for the day and Let the past die.  Is what I get from this song and I love it. the second song is of course the title track \\"Let Me Hear You Scream\\" Again maybe not the best song for long time ozzy friends. But it seems the meaning is still the same saying to get up and fight. Show your strong and scream like you want it. To live to fight for what is important is what I get from the track. The guitar solo and sound of this whole track is weak compared to other title tracks like \\"No More Tears\\" or \\"Diary of a Madman\\" but those are both classic songs on albums that have lived and has stood the test of time.  In time maybe \\"Scream\\" will be the same as these tracks.  \\"Soul Sucker\\" is the third track and starts out with some heavy chords and bass lines.  I love this song.  It sounds like a simple song not alot of change ups in the guitar but its heavy and the solo is pretty amazing. Its no Randy Rhodes but no one is or will ever replace him.  Not even the great Zakk Wylde surpassed Randy's greatness.  The song to me sounds like he is saying let the past be.  Get it out of your mind out of your face as you run through to the future. Don't let the people of the past way you down. As you can see a pattern appearing. \\"Life Won't Wait\\" this song means alot to me. I think that it is a well written and very emotional track.  He talks about watching time pass him by and everything changing.  Saying that you have to let it all go. The pain, the injustice, the greed and to stand up and be strong.  Be true to yourself and live for the future.  Not to sit and let life pass you by. Which alot of people including me do. We take life for granted and we never know when it will all be over. The guitar on this song is great and the solo is amazing. Showing Gus has what it takes to hang with the great legends of guitar that Ozzy has had the pleasure of sharing the stage with. This is just a great song and I love it. \\"Diggin' Me Down\\"  Now this song I can see being a classic.  It has the beginning guitar intro that reminds me of Randy Rhodes and Diary of a Madman so much its eery.  the Intro leads into a hard hitting heavy riff filled song.  The solo is also absolutely amazing on this song.  As for meaning on this song.  It seems to me its about the world being so corrupt and the government being full of greed.  Watching the rich get richer and the poor getting poorer.  Asking where is God and when will Jesus come to save us?  Saying the pain of the people and the world is digging his grave and testing his faith. Asking how long will have to wait for help? This is an amazing song and I totally recommend listening to it. \\"Crucify\\" is another great track. Its probably not the best song on the album but it is a great song. From what I hear it sounds like it is about the devil and sin. Giving into your darkest temptations.  It also makes me think of the story of Judas being one of Jesus oldest friends and then betraying him in the end to be crucified for our sins.  \\"Fearless\\" another great track.  This one seems to be about being a warrior and standing your ground.  Saying he is a warrior and he would rather die fighting then serving someone he doesn't believe in. \\"Time\\" this is another great emotional song.  Has the same meaning to me as Life won't wait. Telling you that time will pass you by. Time waits for no one.  To not let your life fade away from you.  To stop living in your dreams and actually live your dream. Its a beautiful song and I love it.  I think its very well written and has great meaning. \\"I Want it More\\" This one starts with a small melodic piano intro leading into a hard riff and rock feeling song.  \\"I Want it More\\" this song to me seems to be about mans greed.  Asking is this what you wanted?  How much will you pay to have it?  Was it worth what you paid to make the deal?  What was lost? Not positive of the meaning of I want it more\\" Maybe saying the person has more greed in them then anyone else. He'll take what you give, get what you want, and more.  \\"Latimer's Mercy\\" This song has a very dark tone to it.  A very evil and melodic vibe. And it is based on a true life event. It was written about Robert Latimer and his daughter Tracy Latimer who during birth he oxygen supply was cut off causing her to be born with Cerebral palsy which lead to severe mental and physical disabilities including seizures.  Apparently there was not mucht hat could be done to help her. they had her on medication to control the seizures and she went through several operations. One day while the rest of the family was at church the father \\"Robert\\" attached a hose to his truck exhaust and placed his daughter in the truck with the hose running into the cab.  He didn't want his daughter to suffer anymore.  He went to trial and was convicted for second degree murder. there is alot more to the story and its a very interesting read. If you want tocheck it out please visit [...] by copying and pasting the link. This is a good song. Not a great ozzy classic but it has meaning and a story. think what you want. Was the father a murderer or a savior?  Either way his daughter was suffering and he did what he thought was best for her. \\"I Love you all\\" Not a very long track. Its really a short thank you message to everyone who has stood by him over the years and telling them God bless and that he loves you all. Now all this being said I think this is a very meaningful album.  To me it screams \\"No pun intended\\" about life and choices.  To get up and do something before life passes you by. It also has a religious vibe speaking of sin and the devil. Also of God and where he is in this time of hardship.  To have faith and be strong.  It has a strong message and a powerful sound. Gus G Does not disappoint on guitar at all.  He shows he has what it takes to be the lead guitar man for perhaps the greatest heavy metal front man of all time. I recommend this album 100% it may not be a classic yet but in time who knows. This could be one of his greatest albums of all time. Only time will tell.
0061730335|5.0|I could smell the smells and hear the sounds, a perfect balm for a heart that loves Malawi.  So beautifully written, I felt I was right there with you.  God bless you for overcoming such huge obstacles.  A classic example of Malawian &#34;make do&#34; mentality.
B009R8DJ72|5.0|This book is awesome, cool, boyysh and Manny words more.<br />Thanks Jeff Kinney fore righting this book.<br /><br />From Gorge, Jessika and Stephen.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|We all go through the earlier parts of our lives at breakneck speed either not having the time to absorb and reflect upon it or choosing not to. Events occur that shape us and cause us to go off in our own directions which sometimes brings us closer to those around us or causes greater distance. Harold and Maureen found each other at a young age and start on their journey together, happy in living the simple life by just being able to share it with one another. Then, as with most of us, our past lives and history and other events occur and life takes on it's challenges. Harold and Maureen take a couple of these significant events and allow them to come between them. After receiving a letter from someone who was dying and, in the past, had selflessly saved Harold from himself, Harold writes her a note in reply. As he's about to send it, he makes a decision to deliver it himself although it means a very long journey on foot. He meets many people along the way, ordinary but all with their own life story, who help Harold to analyze his situation or, in many cases, he helps them in their life journey. The writing is beautiful--descriptive and flowing without being over the top--pleasurable to read. And the story makes you introspective of your own past, your own relationships in life and maybe, how you've gotten to where you are. Maybe you're still early in your own \\"pilgrimage\\". Once again, another book that I didn't want to put back on the shelf.
B000008GVG|5.0|What is there to say about this, nothing that hadn't been said already.<br />Is this the best debut album ever?<br />Bought this just to get the US versin in my collection.
B00683JLXA|2.0|First off I am not seeing the in app purchase icon that another poster is complaining about. I can only guess they patched it to remove it.<br /><br />Now to the game itself, it's basically a Angry Birds clone but a average one at best. The animations are clunky, sound effects are poor and controls a bit off. No where near the quality of Angry birds. I will be turning off the sound effects for sure. Also it doesn't properly rotate your device. It forces in game the rotation while the os is still in portrait mode. On a nexus 7 all my software based buttons are still in portrait mode. I also find the permissions kinda steep for what it does. I am not seeing the need for a lot of them.<br /><br />But it still has a lot of levels to complete and if you like AB then you will enjoy this game so play it. I know I will keep it and beat it.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This is the best movie that we have seen in quite a while.  It is a touching story, based upon true events, of an invalid man and an unlikely assistant who turns out to be the best thing for both of them.
B00CBKXGPI|2.0|This game could be really good but as soon as I paid for the full version it stopped working!  It will let you go into the gallery for example and you can buy sell what have you and as soon as you exit it exits off and when you log back on it acts as if you did nothing anything you bought or sold is reset!!!
B00C5ZORES|5.0|Fall out boy returned and kicked ass with this new album if your a fan get it if your not a fan still get it
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I love it it has great graphics and it reminds me of pwi<br /> I hope other s enjoy it<br />Like I dis
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This book was not quite what I expected.  It's a &#34;beauty and the beast&#34; tale about a woman who gets a job taking care of a disabled man.  Mostly, she's there as company.  I was quite impressed by how much I enjoyed this book.  The characters are very charming (even when they're purposefully being the opposite) and you can't help but wish for that fairy tale ending.  This book takes a real look at the quality of life of a quadriplegic.  It's tough, at times, but a beautiful book overall.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|It was met my high expectations for a Nelson DeMille, &#34;John Corey&#34; book.  After reading it, I had to go back and re-read previous John Corey book, as I didn't want the &#34;smart-mouth&#34; Corey story to end!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was a lightning fast read and very refreshing; definitely not your typical &#34;woe is me, my wife is missing&#34; type novel.  I was instantly engrossed and my inner detective was hard at work, trying to figure out what was going on before it was revealed to the reader.  Be prepared for twists, turns, and love/hate relationships with the characters.
B000002PC6|5.0|I love Olivia Newton-John's voice.  This CD is special.  Most CD's only have a few songs that sound good, but every song is good on this CD.  This has always been one of my favorite Olivia Newton-John CD's.  She's a great talent and she works with the best, specifically John Farrar.  He's a great song writer and record producer.  Yet Olivia Newton-John's vocal talents are what make this CD the best she's ever done in my opinion.  &#34;Heart Attack&#34;, &#34;Physical&#34;, &#34;Silvery Rain&#34;, &#34;Carried Away&#34;, &#34;Recovery&#34; and &#34;Make a Move on Me&#34; are great songs, but there are others.  This CD is A-one and I love it.
0812983459|5.0|This book is a gentle giant.  It brings to mind the quote &#34;The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation.&#34;  Transformation through action and communication brings the reader full circle.
B008602KQI|3.0|I thought this movie was kinda boring. Some parts of it was kinda cool though, like the tracker jacker scene.
B00AO7HQ06|4.0|We try and immortalize the Great Musicians that shaped our Rock Roots!<br />For Me Duane Allman (Allman Brothers)was one of those Rock gods.<br />I saw Him Practice in a Garage in Melbourne Beach FL as the Allman Joy<br />back in the 1960's, and have never been the Same!!<br />This Compilation puts together a lot of stuff,<br />Really hard to believe Duane Accomplished so much in the such an unfortunate short<br />Life Span-Still like The Live at Fillmore the Best!<br />Cheers! Curt<br />&#62;~iii~&#60;( Crank it up!
B00AEQYM6S|5.0|Great album. I especially enjoyed the Lohengrin extended scene. Beautiful singing. I have never heard a tenor since Melchior that<br />could do justice to Wagner like Kaufmann has. Congraduations to him.
0385349947|5.0|This book should be assigned reading for teenagers in school and their parents, too. It drives home the obvious and not so obvious role of women and men in and out of the workplace. I'm buying multiple copies and giving them to friends and their daughters. To paraphrase two of Sheryl Sandberg saying's...take your seat at the table and don't leave until you leave! Read this book.
B00A2IUDO8|5.0|This will be a cult classic...hysterical, and highly quotable. Be careful, if you watch it once too much, you might find yourself talking with a Boston accent! (I did)
B006LSZECO|5.0|A lot of discussion surrounds this book.....especially the ending ? Who is the most crazy ?  All I can say is &#34;wow&#34;
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Lately I buy buy movies that I can stream, but I had to by this DVD to continue to add to my Lord of the Rings collection. Now I am starting my Hobbit collection. I plan to buy the other 2 movies once they come out.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I purchased this due to all of the hype surrounding it.  It is very poorly written and at times seems to be the same story as Twilight.
B003UYUP6M|4.0|Levy get's access like no other journalist. But you get the feeling that the information is controlled by Google. Still a good book.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|Best album I've heard in a long time! I love it! Have listened to continuously since I bought. That girl can sing!
B0058DRSHW|5.0|I've heard a lot of good things about this book. They are all true. Five star rating is what it deserves.
B00AKEMHCA|1.0|my friend said it was awesome but it wont download this is a really great app but I cant play it because it wont download
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book is amazing I wish it would never end. It the kind of book u never want to put down
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Have been a fan of Justin and the Moody Blues for many, many years.  This CD is a variety of styles and music.
B0090SI3ZW|1.0|No good. This is about the worst movie I have seeing. I just didn't like it at all, hate it.
034580404X|5.0|Very comfortable for typing.  I use them at work all the time.  I love them and will be ordering another pair!!!
B0094K1WZE|3.0|Your basic action film. If you're one of those who complains that \\"that could never happen\\" then it's not for you.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|I am a Trek purist. I love the original series and DS9 and enjoy TNG and Voyager, though somewhat less than the first two. Growing up watching the original and it's cheesy props and Enterprise fly-byes, I could not imagine the &#34;updated&#34; look would fly. I took the chance however, and even I admit it looks phenomenal. The planetary props and skies have not been touched, and look as cheesy as ever, and the remastered looks from space look amazing on a plasma tv. I was very impressed with the &#34;galaxy edge&#34; in Where No Man Has Gone Before.<br /> I do not feel it takes away from the show nor does it disrespect the vision of Gene Roddenberry in anyway. It gives Trek a legitimacy it never could have achieved in the 60's with the limited budget.<br /> For all you Trek purists, the new Trek movies are more of an insult to the Trek universe than these remastered dvd's.
B004LQEYAG|5.0|Why five stars?<br />Great work from all involved in making this film: great direction, great cinematography, great story to bring to film, and of course the stars Newman and Redford, who define this picture.<br /><br />Downside: in line with “all that follows is mostly true.” Indeed the characters were factual, and the basic tenants of them as living outlaws is historical. However, it can be criticized for bringing more myth than fact to the screen, which is okay - it’s wonderful story telling.<br /><br />Who would like it? This was the first of its generation to redefine and modernize the western. So, most dyed-in-the-wool western movie fans may balk at that revision here – especially those who want the outlaw to stand and fight back not run away. I think the characters were developed nicely and there is enough “western” in it to make it authentic anyway.
0439023483|5.0|My entire family from adults to children love this series. Already owned books two and three. Now we all ave re-read entire series again. Leads to good family discussions on things happening today.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|if you have the skills the jump and dodge over things your ready for this game but have fast pace
B0064NTZJO|5.0|This film represents the best integration of music and film since the original Star Wars trilogy.  Front to back, this movies kills it.  Gosling does his best Clint Eastwood impersonation in, \\"Drive.\\"  It takes a truly gifted actor to have such little dialogue, yet say EVERYTHING with his eyes and his body language.  He doesn't have to spew a bunch of witty banter to fill the silence.  The viewer understands it all through his movements and his actions.  Probably Gosling's second best performance ever, after playing the most wicked and convincing Nazi Skinhead in, \\"The Believer.\\" (another film you should watch if you like Gosling and indie arthouse films).  As someone previously said, this movie is in love with itself.  That is true, but in doing so, it convinces you to love it too.  Pay no attention to the negative reviews.  If you love great acting, a great motion picture soundtrack, and a great story....Drive is the perfect choice.
0765325950|4.0|I've waited a long time for this book to come and the series to come to a close.  Overall, I thought the final book wrapped things up pretty neatly.  Of course no one likes to see their favorite characters die but all things must come to an end.  For me, the most difficult part was slogging through endless descriptions of battles.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I love this music!!!! It makes me feel as if I'm in forks itself, waiting for my Edward to come and sweep me away.  When i listen to Bella's lullaby it makes me feel like Edward is right there with his cold stone arms around me whispering the song into my ear as i fall asleep in his arms.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Every student should be required to see this movie that just concentrates on the time in history to pass the 23rd amendment
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I enjoyed the way the words rolled off the page full of so much imagery and emotion I experienced the book.
B000NA77YO|5.0|All was good and I would recommend it to anyone. The Lord gave us an awesome gift and he was taken too soon.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn does a great job revealing the depth of her characters. This is my favorite of her three books, and I can't wait for more. Suspenseful, intriguing and well written. You won't be disappointed.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is just beautiful, the series out put together even better. I'm so glad I read the hunger games trilogy. The visual images are so powerful it's almost to hard to read, but in the end the books just shine. I think Suzanne Collins made a good choice writing these books. She is a great author,I love her books she writes such good books
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Watch it gain and again.<br /><br />Love the music, actors and the fact that the actors sang with emotion and such sincerity and not like a studio production.<br /><br />Wish there was another movie with such a moral theme and beautiful expressions of different types of love.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|One of the better romances I have read in a long time. The character development and clarity of scenes makes the book almost a movie. Highly recommend this to a woman who loves love.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I like the diversity of court cases and the romantic drama the characters go thru, with right from wrong decisions made.
B009AMANBA|5.0|The conflict and controversy surrounding the liberating the slaves mirrors similar fights of the 20th and 21 centuries -- civil rights in the 1960s and marriage equality in the past few years. It's a detailed snapshot of the House of Representatives in action.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Would recommend it to anyone. Some great surprises and a wonderful change from most vampire novels. Can't wait to read the next one.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Very unique way of writing a novel.  It was difficult reading it at the beginning, however, once you get over the 5 year old talk it is quite remarkable.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|My husband and I are still playing, we LOVE it! We are having so much fun and I love figuring out all the puzzles...Buy the game you won't regret it!
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|It was a lot more than I expected! The story was good and a lot of fun. Great animation as usual and the spectacle and adventure war great. Love this movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best game I've seen in all the searching I've did good graphics good almost everything. It's better than all those fake knock off pieces of crap.for God sakes I think my dog could make a better game than every other one out there other than all those fake knock offs it makes a wonderful game so I think you should buy it.the rest of them are freaken ridiculous.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Wow! What a great book to read.  I could not put it down once I started.  The story just sucks you in !
B000K4WPCC|5.0|This movie is awesome.  It arrived on time and in good condition.  As a matter of fact, I am watching it as I type this.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I really enjoyed The Good Wife.  It's interesting, thought provoking and entertaining. I like it because although the content of the story was adult, there's not a bunch of cussing and skin.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I feel compelled to write a review before I've even finished this game.  It's very imaginative and tough; well at least for me - that means I love it!  Want MORE!  Didn't really think this game would grab me because I was really hooked on the visually changing scenes in most point and click type games - fooled me...really appreciate the folks who developed this game as it appears they have tons of imagination.  Thanks for a terrific game--please do a sequel.
B004VD3YIM|1.0|what the hell , i didnt even know nething about this ,if i ordeng tred something like this i was tryin to get an axtually camera

B00005O3VC|5.0|Great movie bringing back comedy without all the high tech stuff...<br />A barrel of laughs all the way around, a good way to spend a few hours on pure comedy.  Let us ride to Camelot!
B000IZ8SD8|4.0|This is great Star Trek along the lines of the early films. Great acting and special effects. The streaming on Amazon was good with no breaks in the film's continuity to buffer content.
B005HSL626|1.0|THIS IS THE STUPIDEST APP EVER. IT IS RETARDED :-( DO NOT LIKE IT AT ALL. I ADVISE TO NOT GET IT.
0345803507|3.0|about half way through ths book. It is a nice read, wasn't sure i would read this sexy trilogy after all the hype on the talk show circuit but a friend loaned them to me=what can I say curiosity.............
B00A3DZ61W|3.0|It's okay, doesn't like android. I tried to play it but it kept freezing up. Other than that, it is a pretty fun game.
B00BG4UWPC|5.0|I love this release. It is on heavy rotation at home and will form a big part of my Summer soundtrack.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|This book is hilarious and when I was petting my cat I did an a plus! This book is a must buy I give it five stars
B00BESKTMG|5.0|A great movie. A lot of fun and a lot of pun. The Blacksmith, the Jackknife, the Dagger were not stereo-types; yet went beyond description. Bring some more.....MLJ
B005LAIISA|5.0|We love the Ice Age series as they are suitable for all ages.  We love the squirrel & his acorn that causes all the trouble. Great voice overs.
B00821OX98|3.0|The story is there...the acting not so much. Great series, Very enjoyable, Not sure it has me coming back for more though
B0058YPILY|5.0|I absolutely love this series & this season would have to be the best & most dramatic yet. Loved the ending - can not wait for the next series. We have brought lots of DVD's from Amazon & never had an issues with them being sent from O/S.<br />Kym<br />Australia
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Great story. Morgan Rice is an excellent writer. Some of the plot is a little cliched , but the author still makes it very exciting. Can't wait for the final book in the series to be released.
B00BJO5SXK|5.0|This is like awesome and stuff, apparently I need 14 words more so like I dunno, it's like good at being a CD
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Very interesting book.  I feel sorry for his wife because some of the things written have different meanings now.  Thank you Chris for your service
B00CDT41RY|3.0|The only high spot is the dentist has some great lines . The rest of the movie is like a remake of a Clint Eastwood movie especially in the comic relief The only thing that struck me as original was the use as slavery as the centerpiece  of the  quest by the heroes  That was original and showed some of what was the  best moments of the film
B00000AFWZ|5.0|You can find here both new and second hand editions in perfect conditions, and from each place in the world.
B005PK56TA|4.0|The characters are well-developed and the actors did a great job. The writing is first-rate and the level of blood and gore is consistent with True Blood and Justified. It could have easily gotten out of hand, but I thoroughly enjoyed the whole season and was kept entertained. I liked the rate at which the plot developed giving the viewer glimpses of what was really going on; good twists to the plot.
0062059963|5.0|First off, I must state that I began reading this book at precisely 10:23 am this morning and haven't stopped since. Seriously. I was walking down the sidewalk on my way to subway with my nose buried in The Elite. I'm quite lucky not to have been run over by an SUV. Anyway, there have been many times I have been tempted to give this book a ranting review in lieu of a raving one because, in certain places, the storyline really ticks me off. That, I believe, is what makes this such a well-written, great book.<br /><br />A talented writer knows how to get real emotions out of its readers and in both The Selection, The Prince, and The Elite, Kiera Cass succeeds to an atomic level. Throughout my one-day journey through the twists and turns of The Elite, I have laughed, cried, growled, and even screamed at the pages (which got me some strange looks at dinner) due to the pure power of the words in front of my eyes. Out of all the books I've read, this has gotten the most prominent physical and mental reactions from me. Some parts actually left me aching inside.<br /><br />The story initially starts with a quiet moment which set me off slightly in the beginning. The first few pages were sweet but slowly paced and, after finishing the book, I know why. Despite the first chapter or two being, more or less, uneventful, it can be undoubtedly compered to the calm before a storm. Once you leave the safety of the dangerously calm eye, you are trapped in the unyielding power of the hurricane and there is no turning back.<br /><br />The thing that I believe sets The Elite apart from The Selection is that, while the first book exists to introduce the characters and the society, get you to love America, and make you feel absolutely certain about various things, The Elite puts the REAL story into effect. The real plot. It answers scores of questions while forming new ones at the same time and leaving you wondering who you can trust. You find your heard fluttering with fear and anger and uncertainty and passion and joy all at once.<br /><br />As for the title of my review, I do admit it is absolutely true. This book has a cliff hanger ending that leaves you unsatisfied to some extend and hungering for more. However, do not let this turn you off. This book is totally worth losing sleep (and a few meals) over simply because of the pure passion and emotion it draws from its readers. Kiera Cass, I assure you that I totally blame you for creating a book that leaves me restless and squirming but here's a piece of cake as you've just given me the best day of my life.<br /><br />Long Live the Queen
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The best game in the world here's a story about this game MY sister daughter kindle got lost so I gave mine to her and she spent all of my money I had like 24580<br /> But I for gives her cause she was 4 years old
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Ok I absolutely love horses and this is so realistic to I would recomend this to anybody you got to feed it train it enter it in competitions I mean if you love horses as much as I do you should get it
B005PK553C|5.0|I love horror shows, and this one is one of the best I've ever watched. If you enjoy horror moves this is a must see.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|It stayed with the historical facts. I felt the actors did an excellent job protraing their characters. I could feel the emotions he or mary would feel.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The story of this supposedly affluent family takes many turns and twists. This season holds many surprises within the family and their servants.
B003JYOEYM|1.0|give it up George you had one good movie back in the 60's and since then you have coasted on an undeserved reputation. This movie might have been worse then even Land of the Dead because it had a couple of great ideas that the hack couldn't be bothered to explore. If I could rate this movie less then one star I would but I can't so AVOID it. Dropping a hammer on your foot is better then watching Survival of the Dead. I recommend that over watching this dreck.
B00881PTRC|5.0|Really glad I downloaded this game, it's extremely fun and love the animations on it! :)<br />Lots of catergories to choose from.
B002M0HHC0|4.0|this book was referred to me by someone and I am glad they did. I have used this knowledge in other areas and shared this with others.
B00BESLHEA|3.0|The 1st and 2nd act were good, however the 3rd and final act did not deliver. The three final fight sequences were terrible, if you've seen any old-school martial arts film you know the final fight(s) are the grandest and best choreographed. It seems as though the ran out of funding or ideas on how to stage them.  There is no reason they left this open for a sequel.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Just love to see all the goings on with the family and the staff.  So real and quite interesting!  Just love it!
B000002NZO|3.0|Trespass is a transitional album. It's leaps and bounds ahead of the band's debut album From Genesis to Revelation in nearly every respect, and shows early signs of what they would sound like on their classic 70s albums, but isn't quite there yet.  Peter Gabriel's voice is distinctive but still rough around the edges.  You can start hearing the instrumentalists - especially Tony Banks - beginning to express their personal styles.  And the compositions, most of them longer than 6 minutes, are memorable and strive at the structural complexity that would characterize the band's later work.<br /><br />BUT, as I said before, the music \\"isn't quite there yet.\\"  The compositions are long, but the musical ideas aren't always interesting enough to fill in the space.  Two of the band's most important instrumentalists, Phil Collins and Steve Hackett, wouldn't show up until the next album.  Collins is particularly missed as the drumming here is quite mediocre.<br /><br />Still, who can argue with Peter Gabriel's plaintive singing at the beginning of \\"Looking for Someone\\"?  Or the intensity of \\"White Mountain\\"?  The haunting, droning harmonies of \\"Dusk\\"?  The harsh rock of \\"The Knife\\"?  And of course, \\"Stagnation\\" is probably the best thing here.<br /><br />I would probably pick up quite a few Genesis albums before this one, but there's stuff that's worth hearing here.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I like the game when I was able to play.  Ran fine on Kindle Fire for a day or so, now refuses to open. Deleted app, reinstalled, but still won't open.  Will change star rating when game works again.
1476719071|4.0|Loved this book. Have read it a few times already. I think the ending is a tad unrealistic, but still really enjoyed.
B00A3NQNUU|3.0|I bought this during a time when I couldn't access my tiny monsters. Very similiar but I like tiny monsters better.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|I have yet to be disappointed by an album by Mr. Buble!  A fun album to listen to!  Some great new songs and some great classics!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hugh Howey has now made it to my personal Author Hall of Fame (along with Scott Sigler and Seth Harwood)! I'm so anxious to buy more of his books. Wool Omnibus Edition will go down as a classic as the years go by. The twists and turns in this book were paced perfectly. The story will make you think. It will make you wonder if our world will really come to this.<br />Bravo Hugh Howey. You are damn good!
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|Not quite what I expected but enjoyable.  Have not finished it as it did not hold my interest. Will try it again. Later.
0446547638|4.0|First off, I am reviewing the story itself.<br /><br />The main character, Dawson, works on an offshore drilling rig. The author did not take the time to properly research this industry, so if you are in or familiar with the oil and gas industry the beginning of the story will drive you nuts since much of it does not make any sense and is wrong/not how it actually works on a drilling rig. But fortunately that is a small part of the story & the rest of it is great.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|its great to play love it only one problem you need a lot of pearls they should have plants give pearls as you play.
B000002KN8|4.0|Just received this in mail, had a few listens and can feel the youth in the band, a little less sophisticated than the later albums but still definitely one to have.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was a good book. Really easy to read. I would recommend for an easy classic. If you aren't a big reader and need to feel progress the chapters are really short and you feel like you are moving along quickly.
B000002L75|5.0|I just love Depeche Mode, especially the old recordings, this one is no exception, this sound does not get old, definitely a classic for me.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Great book amazing story of how she recovered and has been able to move on with her life and cope
B00AQM8H9I|2.0|not as great as everyone else's review implies. if you're in to chess it might be your kind of game ... but definitely not my style. yawn.
B000001E3V|4.0|Just so you know, I am probably the biggest living fan of Derek and the Dominos. I love that studio album, absolutely love it. And the chemistry between Clapton and Duane Allman on the that record was so intense it would be tough to imagine anyone duplicating it.<br /><br />And, that's the case here. Duane had returned to his own band by the time the Dominos recorded this. Clapton is still there, of course, and in top form, but the band simply needed Duane's guitar to sound complete. The hottest solos on the studio album were played by Duane, and the back-and-forth between Duane and Clapton made it cook like it did. Clapton's effort to replicate one of Duane's solos from \\"Key to the Highway\\" hits some of the same notes but doesn't do the same job, and without the other guitar there the band doesn't sound nearly as solid. One of the reviewers here offers his opinion that the songs \\"go on for too long,\\" and I'm afraid I agree with him. But hey, the Dominos were still a great band, and they obviously put on a great show. If you love them like I do you will enjoy this recording very much.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Great graphics, soothing and calming, it's a distressed to a very hectic day at the workplace, great for kids and adults give it two thumbs up!
B001CDWFPC|5.0|I have read it through and find the translation accurate and rreadable, and the notes scholarly. It is God's book at my disposal.
B008B68IEA|2.0|on foto it appears better...<br />in reality it is something in gray :))<br />daughter plays with it but mother's expectations are not responded
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Fun little game for young and young at heart.  Beautiful graphics. Fun little fish and beautiful plants and corals. Nice way to kill time
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This game is great, funny, and some what difficult.<br />It is cute too. There is a lot of fun  levels. Can't wate for the updates!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Been waiting for this for a long long time. Good lord. One two three four five six seven eight nine.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Hello my name is Dr Cooper. I'm a fully trained Nero scientists. My colleague and I play this minecraft during our break. Dr Terrell doesn't think to much about this game. Neither do I. There is definitely no such things as zombies, spiders that attack only at night, and absolutely no such things as blowing up creepers. There is no such things as a type of bone meal that makes your plants grow instantly right before your eyes. Seven dollars for an app that doesn't even make sense. We've done a thorough investigation of dead carcasses and there is absolutely no way for one's dead body to come back to life and attack. Go to my website minecrafttherealtruth.org watch my demo movie if you stop playing minecraft long enough. I could say boat loads more but I guess I'm through on this review for apps. This is Dr Cooper saying goodbye and good life for we are all better than we deserve.
B000FA675C|5.0|This is my 3rd reading of the DaVinci Code and it won't be the last.  As always I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. Am looking forward to Dan Brown's next book Inferno. Can't come out soon enough.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Coin dozer is really fun and I personally love it. The only thing that annoys me though, is that once you run out of coins, you have to wait and wait and wait for more. You could buy more, but who wants to waste money on some virtual coins that will be all used up in under three minutes? Not me certainly. But overall, I gave it four stars. Great game.
B00BG5CXGM|5.0|The case is low profile, right fit. I am pleased with the appearance.<br />It is ideal to include a screen protector with the case. You have to spend another $5 to $10 for the screen protector.
B0084HJE0S|2.0|I get it, it was free.  The book was very short.  Consider this &#34;book&#34; more like a (semi)scholarly article.  It is well written and instructive but once I started reading - 'poof' it was gone.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I truly enjoyed following the tentative existence of intrepid Mars mission survivor, Mark Watney, as he struggled to survive the hostile Martian environment. His ability to overcome every new challenge and potential catastrophe reminded me of the old TV character, &#34;MacGyver&#34;.<br /><br />This is science fiction that appears to be grounded in real science and tells an exciting story of a mission that could conceivably happen in the not too distant future.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Where is the tiger in your life ? Ok that may be a false question to ask but if you see Richard Parker give him twenty minutes and a drink of water because you know he has a great story to tell.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|A fun, quick read. The dialog makes me laugh and the plot keeps me guessing. If you're looking for something fun to read, this is it.
B001VIMCW4|5.0|I am serious when I saw Quantum of Solace I was confused. What was the whole purpose of that movie where was the reasoning for the movie and why did that girl nearly die...oh trust me on this
1451695195|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it is very well written. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the subject.
B0020M99LC|5.0|So nothing is more hotter than a man who can honestly play poker and win because that what James Bond does. The rest is for you to watch and see. Oh and now I think after having hands free systems in all cars I want a defibiliator too with a direct number to a cardiologist
B00CAJMGDI|2.0|I bought this album expecting some awesome instrumental music in the vein of the Piano Guys save with a violin. However, after listening to the album a couple times I find myself barely able to tolerate getting through 1/2 of a song before changing it. All of the tracks blend into one with the same high note low note violin tune and dub step-like electric beat in the background. Once I began to listen to each component of the tracks I started to hear to pattern in each song which, when played back to back, becomes monotonous. I really like the idea and I hope she comes out with another album but I think the next time I will use much more discretion before purchasing everything at once.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|While I am sure life is boring for anyone over the age of 25 Judd aptow made this movie with his wife and two kids being starred in it. Yeah there are funny moments but I think I actually thought about getting therapy after this movie because when i read the reviews it just seems like Judd aptow pimped out his family to make a movie..how sad...
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|It was a very good book!! But it got kind of boring towards the middle of the book. But overall it was a very good ending to the hunger games series.
B0091REZMW|4.0|its ok it keep my mind off of stuff I don't want to think about when I don't want to think about them
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Ummmmm...what did Colleen just do to me. I am pretty sure she ripped my heart out, stomped on it and then handed it back to me like nothing happened. Love, lies and abuse....no big deal.  NOT!!!!!  Why did someone not tell me...no, demand that I read this book sooner?? All my book friends SUCK for not making me read it before now. Everyone needs to meet Dean Holder!<br /><br />\\"I need this. I need to know for sure that you're feeling every single thing that I'm feeling the moment my lips touch yours. Because I want your first kiss to be the best first kiss in the history of first kisses.\\" ~Holder<br /><br />Where do I even start?? I feel like I can't tell you how I feel about this book without ruining something and NO ONE should have this book ruined for them. Again, I started this one without reading any reviews or even the synopsis.  I started reading about Sky's life without a clue of where this will lead me. I LOVE reading that way. I love me some surprises!!! And there are lots of those in this story.<br /><br />Sky is living what she thinks is a good life. Yeah, her mom might be a little weird but she is still awesome in Sky's eyes. And Sky has this great best friend named Six...not her real name but her real name is Seven. Yes, weird!! I love Six's personality. Awesome best friend!! Until she leaves for school halfway across the earth :(<br /><br />But don't stress, Sky makes 2 new friends. One is a gay Mormon and the other is a moody bad boy. Wanna guess which one is Holder?? I will give you a hint, Dean Holder isn't gay ;) But he is one AMAZING boyfriend after his and Sky's initial miscommunications. Wow, I had to keep reminding myself that he is only 18 years old and I needed to get my 34 year hormones under control. LOL!! Holder knows exactly what to say and when to say it. In my next life, I want a Holder, please!!<br /><br />\\"The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss. Because if you've never felt anything when someone's kissed you, then no one's ever really kissed you. Not the way I plan on kissing you.\\" ~Holder<br /><br />Ok, enough about Holder though. Why did Colleen have to make me cry for Sky?? Give the girl a break!! If I was her, I would have curled up into a ball in the closet and never come back out. My stress level would have been pushed past bodily functioning level. OMG, the situations that are discussed in this story still make my heart hurt :( This one will take me days...no, weeks to get over. But, darn the woman can write a book!!! If Colleen Hoover writes it, I am reading it :)<br /><br />*review copy provided by Netgalley for an honest review*no one's ever really kissed you.

B00AB7HESI|5.0|at first i was going to rip their heads off because i couldn't get it to open but after i got it open i almost finished the game in two  days. only one problem they should give you all of the worlds more levels. otherwise its aaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaaassssssssoooooooooommmmmmmmmeeeeee
B00005N6KG|5.0|They are wonderful. They stay put. They block out noise much better than ear buds. So happy I bought them!
B00AEFXOKO|5.0|This is a motivational, inspirational, feel good movie that everyone needs to see. And the bonus is you get to look at Channing Tatum :)
0802473156|5.0|I loved this book!  It was very insightful.  You can tell that Dr. Chapman really has spent a lot of time working with couples and is sincere in trying to help them.  I think this could make any relationship better, even if everything is okay to begin.
B008220D5K|5.0|Obviously the Amazon customers who wrote these reviews have no sense of humor, or else they would LOVE this movie!  Go away haters and take your negativity out on a different movie.  Any way, this movie is such an original and is representative of Apatow's hilarious sense of humor and Mann's uncanny ability to bring life to the ironies of everyday situations that couples find themselves in.  If you have a sense of humor, want to be shocked, and have a good laugh, then this movie is right for you.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|This camera is more for skyping or face-timing.  Not really for taking pictures.  I initially thought I would be able to take better photos with it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Because of the way it was written.  The husband tells his side and leaves you hanging and the wife tells her side and leaves u hanging. It has a lot of unexpected twists and turns.
1250010403|3.0|Here we have two people who just love each other and they finally get together, not much is happening. Here we have this women who lives her baby behind?  The war aspects was very good,and i enjoyed that part, but everything else just didn't compare.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|It has a very typical angry old man story with a nice addition of Amy Adams and Justin Timberlake story line.  I would recommend it for the nice message it gives.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show was a little hard to get into at first. Now I'm hooked! I can't wait to see the next episode and it's beginning to become a problem because I'll be exhausted and have to keep watching.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I love the LOTR books and movies and while I found the Hobbit book went on a lot of bunny trails the movie keeps the entertainment going.
B004ZN9UZO|5.0|I remember being a teenager and seeing this in record stores the week it came out.  Since FM radio wasn't playing anything off of it, I never knew what a gem it was until about 11 years later when this one buddy of mine stated I should listen to it on headphones, several times at a minimum.  He said it was better than DSOTM, as well as Wish You Were Here.  I never rated DSOTM as their best, but Wish You Were Here???  No way I thought, this dude's smoking some bomb ganja to make a claim like that.  25 years later, if I could find him now I'd buy him dinner for him convincing me to get into this album.  This is the best thing Floyd ever did in my opinion, and now that it's been remastered the CD finally sounds as good as the music that's on it.  Gilmour's guitar on this is just freakin' awesome, never better.  I could listen to this album from start to finish, and then start to finish again, and again, over and over and over, and never get tired of it.  There are very, very few albums I could make that claim about.  Don't worry if you've never heard any of the songs on here.  Trust me, it doesn't matter....
B008OOYALE|5.0|If your looking for a fun app this is the app for you!!! Dragon Story is such an addicting game and all of the time you are either feeding your dragons, waiting for things to build and much more. If your friends play you can even visit there place and see how they are doing. This game is way better than any other Dragon game in the app store!!! You will be playing this game all the time, checking on your place and doing many other things. All though, this app does have in app purchases witch means that you can use real money to buy things that you will eventually get over time if you wait. So enjoy the game and go wild!!!
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Fabulous!  I have hooked many a friend on D.A. by sharing the DVDs.  A collection I'll treasure for years.  Great quality product.
B001NLKXK2|3.0|I really wanted to like this book but was quite disappointed. The story starts off well enough, but once the protagonist starts decompensating from the effects of dementia it becomes quite repetitious. Furthermore, seeing as she becomes quite incapacitated, she is no longer able to make decisions which is a real problem for a protagonist. And it becomes quite tiring to read the word, &#34;Harvard&#34; over and over again.  Okay Lisa Genova, we get it. You went to Harvard and we're all very impressed!
0061124958|5.0|The book was in good shape and served its purpose! The students will enjoy reading it I think, I dont see why not
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Good read. Not too simple, not too technical. Just enough humor. Good lessons. Good ending. So glad it's a series!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Come on George, get the next one out!  Really ended on cliffhanger, but then this series seems to do that.
B00005LK94|5.0|Such a touching story of human and birds interaction with a positive outcome.<br />My grandchildren watched it and I loved it.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was a quick and easy read but touching and thought provoking. It made me feel emotional, but in a good way, and the lesson has hung on my heart for weeks now. I would recommend it to my friends.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|Ken Follett shows the well told events of World War II from a different angle; a very interesting different angle.  His characters are realistic and I'm looking forward to reading the third book of this trilogy.
B001HNE3NO|3.0|I thought the author wrote in a lovely way but the story itself lacked for me. It was depressing and I felt in a funk the entire time I read it. After a few days of reading I wanted to just finish it... I was anticipating a happy ending, something to better resolve all the sorrow the book held, something to pull me out of the funk the story was pushing me into. Unfortunately, after all the characters go though, it was very anticlimactic. I have had enough sorrow and hardship in my own life that I desire a happy ending. I love to read books that lift my spirit and leave me feeling there is so much hope. If that is what you like, too, then don't read this one. You will think it is going there, but it does not. - I  do need to be  honest, I don't think I would have ever picked this book myself. It was a book club choice not one of my own. I am sure it will make for a great discussion when we next meet.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is great for all ages and helps develop hand eye coordination. I recommend it for all animal lovers. Earning gems is a little tough.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app has made it fun and easy to take notes and stay organized. I definitely recommend it for any student or professional!
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|This game is a lot of fun. It is also rather addictive, sneaking up on you and you find yourself playing it constantly!
B005EGXTL2|4.0|It's is a great story. It's written for young adults but its still a great read. I wish it were longer
0307346617|4.0|The concept of a zombie apocalypse evolves into a fictional historical event of eerily realistic proportions in Max Brooks' World War Z. Like their fellow horror counterparts, vampires and werewolves, zombies have wrought their existence back into the limelight and have received mainstream levels of attention within the past decade. However, the endless amount of undead content that is nearly impossible to miss in any bookstore or Netflix browser paints the genre's reemergence as a cyclical fad that gets increasingly dull with each new OMG I'm a Zombie app on your phone. Yet beneath the banal pile of rotting corpses lies gems of actual quality and depth, which is exactly what Brooks' World War Z brings to the genre's revival.<br /><br />The uniquity of Brooks' novel detailing the aftermath of humanity's war against a global zombie outbreak comes from his choice of a journalistic approach. The book is formatted into a collection of interviews of war survivors telling their stories to an unknown journalist. The interviewees themselves consist of numerous ages, races, and positions, which create distinct personal survivor experiences whilst also establishing a global view of the epidemic by trotting from Denver, Colorado to as far as Sydney, Australia.  It is this approach that is the book's true success by keeping the story constantly fresh with detailed and realistic interviews along with the well-known and unheard of locations the stories take place in.<br /><br />Comparable to books that catalogue interviews of holocaust survivors and Vietnam veterans, World War Z's horror is brought to life within the interviews through subtle and specific details told by civilian survivors as well as politicians and soldiers. It is clear to see how much Brooks had done his homework when writing his book through the vast amounts of political, global, and military information in the book that are both factual and fictional. At times it's hard to tell which is which. In addition to the political realism is the personal realism told through the survivors of every facet. It's one thing to read a book about a group of people who survive a zombie outbreak, but it's a whole new experience to read about dozens of individuals and families from every country in every situation imaginable surviving an end of the world scenario, a scenario that Brooks makes more heartfelt and believable than it has any right to be.<br /><br />Readers may occasionally find themselves turning away from the page in either reflection or remorse after hearing such compelling and haunting stories of survival. Whether it's the young woman with a child's mind whose mother tried to kill her out of mercy or the operators who committed suicide after the war after listening to every broadcast for help, it's this kind of detail and believability that truly encapsulates World War Z. It turns the idea of a zombie apocalypse into a record of convincing and emotional events that almost make the reader forget that they're reading fiction. World War Z has been referred to as a modern day War of the Worlds radio broadcast and that is rightfully so. Anyone who is looking to read a book that is capable of educating, horrifying, and displacing you from your own world history will find their fix within the recorded voices forever imprinted on the pages of Max Brooks' World War Z.the political realism is the personal realism told through the survivors of every facet.

B006P0FIB0|5.0|can't wait for the next one!!!!I have this in 3D and it is wonderful!!!!!!!!! I also love this in Blu-ray also.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|talk about 'roid rage.  on 'roids.  nice, very nice.  The chase scenes are very well done, but not much different that a reprise of something from the latest bond stuff.
B004APVI1G|5.0|didn't get this movie when it first came out but I finaaly found it and I got it in #D also and I really love this movie
B009LMTDL0|5.0|As a psychologist, I don't often take the time to read books that aren't clearly related to the work I do.  I am so glad that I heard about this book on NPR and decided to read it.  Sandberg inspired, entertained, and informed!  I highly recommend this book to women at all stages of their careers, even if they don't think of their careers as business careers.  I have also been discussing this book with men and women in HR and management positions.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This book gives great insight to the oppression of women in Afghanistan and yet how love and hope remains true.
B004LROUNG|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed The Litigators. Grisham always provides a nice escape from my reality. This one was a little predictable, but I liked it nonetheless.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Once again James Dashner has amazed me!  What a rollercoaster ride the trilogy was, it never slowed down.  I started with the prequel The Kill Order, it was my very first Dashner book.  I hope you have some more exciting stories James.  Thanks!
B008J2GAKU|3.0|Interesting start to a story ark although I still find the DC multiverse an awkward device.<br /><br />The Kindle version has a neat feature called panel view which zooms panels and allows swiping to the next panel. Unfortunately it's glitchy and doesn't always work. Also several pages are printed upside down. These issues detract from a well written and drawn title.
B00846REIS|4.0|If you enjoyed fifty, then you are going to love this book. Yes, the relationship between the characters is obsessive and possesive, but i just couldn't put the book down, i had to find out what was going to happen. I loved it!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Some complained that there was too much dialogue. I thought this was the strength of the film.  It brings to light the complex political environment President Lincoln operated in, even though Congress did not contain Southern Democrats (except from the border states).  The film also showcased President Lincoln's political skills. The film gives some perspective to today's Congress; which if you compare to the antebellum Congress, is  relatively tame and effective! Lastly, good acting all around. What a cast!
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Did you really think we would just stand by, Bin-Laden? Thought we were through hunting you like the animal you were? No one believed that a tireless, determined, driven woman could piece together shards of a trail that, insignificant standing alone, would come together as a full puzzle to eventually bring down the most hunted person in today's world. Bravo! Must see!
B0009P5YXO|4.0|I love this item. I know it says up above I like it but that's because there is a flaw or two with it. First flaw, I don't know if it's just me but in the middle of the extending action the emitter will turn on without me pressing anything. Flaw two, loose cap. The cap that covers up the screw on the slider is pretty loose and after extending the screwdriver a few times it falls off (again this could be something with my model) Now for why I like it. The sound and light is amazing and looks just like the show's. It extends effortlessly. Batteries are easy to put in. The UV ink nib and black ink nib is a cool little feature. And finally, with a bit of imagination you feel just like The Doctor.
B007REV4T8|5.0|So this is the way of the 00 operation. In this case &#34;7&#34;. We now know where he came from but would be interesting to see WHY he started. A brilliant new spin on Moneypenny as a field agent? Wow. M gone? Crazy. Must see. Hope this doesn't end as a trilogy. We need more
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Very well written! Will read the next book. Entertaining!  Good mix of comedy,comedy romance and danger! You have to read this book!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|My pastor has started putting his sermon notes on the live part so we can follow along in church now. I also find myself looking at  how other versions word verses because it is so easy to do. You version is only a tool that is going to help you grow in your faith. The best app ever

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I have always wanted a horse but I don't live  on th  property to own one. Nor has my family ever had the money for one. Well now it seems like  I really have one thanks to this app store, so if you LOVE horses then this is the app 4 YOU
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is great. It has all the fun of Minecraft on the PC , and it's mobile! It also is a lot cheaper. Plus with the two game modes you can either build a mansion in creative or, try to survive and thrive in survival mode. A great game that 8-12 year olds will all ways enjoy.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This book was so moving.  It was eye opening and very emotional.  I didn't want to put it down.  However, in the end I was left wanting to know more of the story.  I wish there was a continuation of the story, a second book.  I want to know what happens next.
0399156577|5.0|I liked this book a lot. I am a huge Nora Roberts fan and this book did not disappoint. The characters were interesting and had good chemistry. The descriptions of the setting make it sound really beautiful. I enjoyed the dogs in the story. The dramatic element of the Red Scarf Killer was engaging. Recommended!
B001KZJQOU|5.0|If you are a fan of Soft Cell, you will absolutely LOVE this release.  I will admit that it is not for everyone, but the mixes on the second disc are outstanding.  I have multiple version of Soft Cell releases and have - at times - been very dissappointed.  The Singles, and Non Stop Erotic Cabaret - Extra Tracks are good, but do not compare.<br /><br />The Singles has many reworked editions of songs that you will not find recognizable as the vocal and/or production have been completely reworked on all of your favorites.<br /><br />Extra Tracks has exactly what is stated: extra tracks.<br /><br />Deluxe Edition has EVERYTHING from Non Stop Erotic Cabaret, including extra tracks and ORIGINAL remixes of the classics.  Although Tainted Love / Where Did Our Love Go is included in it's original version, it pales in comparison to many of the gems that are included.  The Heat version of Bedsitter is wonderful, but the original extended version on disc 2 is by far my favorite track. As with the Heat version, you will find the additional verses - but in their original glory. For me, this track alone is worth the price.<br /><br />Lesser known masterpieces such as Fun City and the original extended What are not to be missed.  I am also highlly fond of the original extended Memorabelia.  As with many Soft Cell songs, there are dark moments.  This aspect of Soft Cell is, perhaps, an acquired taste, but are agonizingly and beautifully rendered.<br /><br />After purchasing this set, I played it non-stop [pun intended] for more than a week.  I was in sheer heaven.  There are those who can appreciate Soft Cell's Tainted Love, but nothing else.  For those that fancy other tracks you MUST purchase this.  This is - by far - the best Non-Stop collection you will find.<br /><br />On a somewhat related note, I highlly recommend that you seek the original Gloria Jones version of Tainted Love.  I love her rendition as well.  It actually makes me appreciate the Soft Cell remake.  It is unfortunate that Soft Cell chose to release their best-selling single with Tainted Love backed with Where Did Our Love Go as they are not the composers of either song.  The royalties they received are, thus, much lower than they would have been.<br /><br />BUY IT !!!tunate that Soft Cell chose to release their best-selling single with Tainted Love backed with Where Did Our Love Go as they are not the composers of either song.

B00BEL4P9Q|5.0|A co-worker told me how good Downton Abbey is and that I should see it, that I would love it. Well, she is right. I am absolutely in love with DA; can't wait for Season 4. As for \\"Matthew,\\" Dan Stevens let it be known to Sarah Crompton of The Telegraph (12/26/12) that he wanted to do other things. I'm sure it was a decision he thought through completely before making it official. I'm sorry that Dan's left the series but I'm sure that Season 4 will be as great as Seasons 1-3.
B00C2VIA52|4.0|I've gotten pretty addicted to this game, but it can get pretty tough without higher level cards that you have to buy
0765325950|3.0|I found the book unnecessarily long.  As Jordan often obsessed with the details of women's dresses so here I found many of the battle scenes pointless.  But these you can skim through.  Most questions are answered and I finally got to see how the story ended.  If you stuck with the series this long then you should read this book
1476734941|5.0|There are so many diet books out there and sometimes I feel like I own most of them.  I found this diet to be easy to follow and it works for me.  No special ingredients to buy or eliminate.  Straight calorie counting for only 2 days a week....  Easy Peasy.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|This book is great and I love that the show on TV goes along just perfect with the book.  It's great....
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Maybe not as challenging as the original but just as much fun.  Loved the time travel element.  Will definitely get future episodes.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|I enjoyed this quick read about a young man struggling with mental illness. It was an engaging story, easy to visualize characters and setting. Now I will see the movie!
B0098VXBIA|4.0|Although this wasn't at the top of my list of movies to watch, (or in the middle either), sitting up late last night with sleep no where in sight, for whatever reason, this movie caught my eye. Having had two sons myself, i could DEFINITELY relate to the things these women were having issues with, (made me feel like i was part of this unique group of special people---'parents'). Some parts made me laugh hysterically as my own mem'ries came fluttering to the front of my mind. While other parts only served to remind me oh how fleeting those precious moments of childhood can be.<br /><br />All in all, i thought it was worth a watch!  Enjoy!!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Bingo Blitz is a great game to play. The only thing I didn't like is the glitches and occassional freezing. Great game to pass the time.
B007PKDW44|5.0|In a time when good rock bands are getting harder and harder to find, this is a band worth checking out. This Cd is one of the best I have bought in a long time. Check them out!
B006BDHAX0|4.0|Plenty of games so it will hold my attention for a long time.  I find I cannot stay away long without wanting to play some more.  I am well entertained by the different layouts.
0143034901|5.0|I enjoy fictional stories set against historical events. For me a little entertainment, a little education, a couch and a cup of tea are the ingredients for a lovely afternoon. This book delivered the entertainment and education, and delivered them so well that I finished the (quite long) book in a very short time. Thoroughly enjoyable.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|It is all the money worth. What a feeling to 180 g of vinyl, instead of the lesser quality in the blue vinyl box. Though I miss some tracks from the rareties albums.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Of course my screen is smaller on my phone, but now I don't need to lug my Kindle with me when I go to a doctor's office.  I can just use my phone, and it knows right where in the book I am!
B008602KQI|4.0|I watched the movie before reading the book. I understand how the script for the movie had to be revised, and it wasn't bad at all. Despite narrating differences, I think the movie conveyed the \\"main\\" story well---cruel dictatorship in Panem and oppression in 12 districts. Violence during the Game was soften too, considering how it happened in the book.<br /><br />However, the movie left out a lot of backgrounds and relationships. I started the book because there were things in the movie that I needed to fill the blank. For example, Katniss' father wasn't mentioned earlier in the movie; he just popped up when Katniss recalled his death. I found out from the book that he gave her skills to survive---hunting, trading, finding edible plants, etc. Moreover, her relationship with her father and his death shaped Katniss characteristics.<br /><br />To me, this story (and the whole series)is a complete version of Battle Royale. If you could see the point of the story, I think it's a good movie to watch. If you think it's purely violent, steer clear from it. Either way, I won't let young kids watch this movie.
B00514HDNW|5.0|One of those books that, once it gets going (and it takes a chapter or three to get going), the thrills don't stop. A true page-turner. All of the movie versions pale in comparison. Looking forward to reading more by Matheson.
0670026603|4.0|\\"This book, this terrible beautiful love story, left me wounded and slightly elated. I finished it at 2 am and was so wrapped in it's nightmarish drama I cried till morning. The pain of the loss, of dreams never to come, of the Hollywood ending I hoped for. No, this story is gritty, heartbreakingly realistic and truthful.<br />My heart bleed for Will, Lou and his parents. Modern medicine created this level of life, where perhaps it's not worth the pain. We now have the ability to keep someone alive, on the very edge of existence for years. What of the person trapped in the body ? Do they have a choice ? Must they live through unending pain and humilities ? Is that right ? I really don't know and that's what hurt me the most. What choice would I force upon my family if I was faced with this nightmare ? I don't think there are two people who are going to come away with the same experience after reading this book. Life's experiences will tie each of us to different aspects of this tale. I learned something, I felt humbled, and I gained and new appreciation for others.<br />I don't know how to rate this one. 5 stars is for a book I want to re-read, and I don't want to re-read this. No, once will stick forever. I didn't enjoy reading it, it hurt. It was very good at bringing forth emotions that I like to keep contained. So 4 stars it is

B00AFYZDL2|5.0|What can one say about SAXON? While other bands from this era are content to recycle the same sound/tunes(whoa, DAVE COVERDALE yet again) these titans keep coming up with great CD'S, and it must be said, this is HOW Metal was meant to sound, Biff learned a LOT from all the time spent in Germany, as the Germans have no peers at making great sounding Metal, especially how to record drums, sorry, they can't be beat, and every SAXON CD has great sounding drums, the guitars bite, and as for Biff, what can you say, the cat just ROARS, nobody is any better, saw 'em on one of their few West Coast trips a  while back, the guy is a LEGEND, just buy this, roll down the windows and sunroof, blast it out, and be happy that SOMEBODY can, and still DOES, know how to do this stuff on a consistently GREAT level. Now, if ONLY PRIEST could put out a CD this good, all would be WELL in the Metal kingdom!

B0062NAVXA|5.0|Turning tragedy into triumph.  Yes this movie has an overarching Christian theme and message.  If you don't like it don't buy it.  I wanted that in a movie and got it.  The acting is decent, the movie is sometimes funny (Javier and the Snake Kings) but the message of being a man of valor and taking charge of family is appropriate.
B000XR4OC0|5.0|I've had my Toms for about a year now and the only part that shows ANY wear is a little on the soles.. canvas is perfect still and they are the most comfortable go-to shoes I own.  I wear them in my low-key workplace at least once a week and out and about, couldn't be happier.  They literally took no time to break in, and I found the sizing to be true.  I wear a 6.5 and ordered a 6.5 and they fit perfect right out of the box.  People must be awfully hard on their Toms to say they break down after 3 months etc.. I wear mine constantly and they are almost as good as when I first got them.  Don't buy the knock offs.. get the real deal and you won't be sorry.
B001AQT0RC|3.0|Only bought it because it was $5 and I remember sort of liking the movie.  I still sort of like it but it is majorly flawed in many places.  I won't review the movie itself but only the Blu Ray.  Picture and sound were both really good and enjoyable.

B009HV2JT8|2.0|Obviously, I didn't have the highest of expectations for this movie but I was hoping to at least be entertained. I found that the story dragged on and that the movie was pretty much boring overall.
B00A757EFW|4.0|The joystick control is a little hard to use on a touchscreen - but then the game was never designed for a touch screen.  Fun to play regardless.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Once you get past the fascinating likeness and brilliant performance of Daniel Day Lewis, you'll find yourself bogged down in a tedious political essay on the Thirteenth Amendment. There are a few glimpses into the life of this great man which could easily have been turned into an interesting bio-pic. Sally Field is terrific as Mary Lincoln but we see too few scenes of her. Brilliantly filmed with great attention to detail...but ultimately boring!
B005LAJ17M|5.0|I really enjoyed this first season.  It has such great atmospherics and dramatic tension.  Trying to separate the good guys from the bad guys is most of the fun.

B0011ZYBQM|5.0|I have owned this CD for over 10 years. I just re-purchased the mp3 version because the CD is now scratched. This is probably the best Pat Metheny album ever.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|My previous watch was a Luminox Navy Seal that I wore for 10 years.  It had a mineral glass lens which is now scratched beyond recognition.  This Seiko 5 has a Stainless Steel everything and both the front and back lenses are Saphire which is almost impossible to scratch.  It keeps accurate time to within 1 to 2 minutes per week.  The band is sufficient.  The case and everything inside of it is just as it should be.  It is not a swiss watch, but I don't see why it wont last a few years.  If you're sick of everything around you being electronic, try this mechanical watch.  I chose this one over the big and fancy Invictus watches and I haven't looked back.<br /><br />If you get one and something seems off about it, give it a few days, if there is no improvement then send it back.  When you get a good one it will function properly.
1476734941|5.0|If you are willing to utilize some self-control 2 times a week, this will definitely work for you. You have to decide in your mind that for 2 days a week, you are going to eat much, much less, but that is also key.  As with anything else it truly is mind-over-matter.  You do get to eat, it's not a complete fast, but you have to do it, and be consistent. You have 5 days a week you can eat as you normally would, and as long as you don't over compensate those five days for the 2 days you &#34;fasted&#34;, this works.  I believe it is something you can handle, and live with the rest of your life to keep your weight under control.
B00124PXW8|3.0|While i do believe in a spiritual realm inhabited by both good and evil entities, I don't think this movie is indicative of that total reality.  I do however, find that it is a good suspense building film with a lot of excitement that inspires wonder and curiosity as to whether or not a real spiritual world exists.  Perhaps I am too jaded and too old to be affected to the point of physical symptoms or psychological trauma by the horror in the movie, but all in all, an interesting film.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This app is a great way to stop boredom! I can't wait for more cartoons to release! I only got the app 2 days ago, but I completed the whole thing because that's how awesome and addicting this app is. If you enjoyed cut the rope experiments, the new devices like bombs and razors and 2 om noms will keep you wanting more. And the voices for the new om noms are adorable. (Except for the Greek om nom, that voice is too deep.)

B009NG1Q96|5.0|America and Maxon kept me in suspense the whole book! I never knew what was going to happen next. The turn of events at the very end of the book was awesome! I shouldn't have read the book so fast because now I will have to wait for what will seem like an eternity for the next one. In several series I have read the second book isn't as exciting as the first book, but this book was well worth the wait! Hoping the 3rd book won't be too far behind.
1451695195|5.0|Reading this book was like being on the journey with the author.  It is a very emotional narrative; and then shares the emotions and sensations of victory and eye-opening knowledge with the author.  It is a very sensory  narrative of the author's experience...worth reading and re-reading!
0374531269|4.0|This book made me want to know more about what children in Africa go through. Not only does the main character narrates the story in detailed gory way, but he tells his story in his perspective and the experiences he went through. He not only tells the story on what happened during that event, but he tells his opinion and mentions the past sayings he and his significant other went through and talked about. It is really sad and tragic to read about his family dying and lots of people dying in this book. He represents in his story how they die in specific details, which will only make you think how awful the army in Africa are. You will just hate their guts! Ishmael, the main character goes to America and experiences a new lifestyle. Ishmael is opened to a new view on how children in the West are treated way differently from where he was. It will make you realize how much thankful our lifestyle is in the West, compared to other children living for survival for their life and not living in peace. This book will make you learn so much things you will not be taught in school and open your eyes on other people's experiences as well. I recommend this book if you want to know what other people experienced and how they managed to get through their horrible situations, especially Ishamael's.

The combination of their voices is incredible. I absolutely love every song on this album. &#34;The Prayer&#34; really showcases their powerful voices. &#34;Caruso&#34; is one of the most beautiful melodies of all time! This is a true collectors item as this duo will go far if they stick together and stay humble.

0553386697|4.0|Dan Siegel and Tina Payne Bryson's \\"The Whole Brain Child\\" fails to deliver on the titular promise of \\"revolutionary\\" parenting strategies to \\"truly help your kids be happier, healthier, and more fully themselves\\"; it does, however, provide innovative and effective explanations, packaging, and delivery of many tried-and-true parenting techniques that turn out to be neuroscientifically based.<br /><br />The first four chapters are the love child of the Johns - Medina's \\"Brain Rules for Baby\\" and Gottman's \\"Raising an Emotionally Intelligent Child.\\" Like Medina, Siegel and Bryson show great talent for breaking down complex science into readily understandable terms (they even surpass him when explaining implicit memory). Yet whereas Medina carefully limits himself to truly definitive (i.e., research-backed) conclusions, Siegel and Bryson - like Gottman - go further, using available data as a theoretical springboard for vaunting specific, mostly emotion-related practices. The following seven strategies result: (1) \\"Connect and Redirect: [Helping Kids Learn to Surf] Emotional Waves\\"; (2) \\"Name It to Tame It: Telling Stories to Calm Big Emotions\\"; (3) \\"Engage, Don't Enrage: Appealing to the Upstairs Brain\\"; (4) \\"Use It or Lose It: Exercising the Upstairs Brain\\"; (5) \\"Move It or Lose It: Moving the Body to Avoid Losing the Mind\\"; (6) \\"Use the Remote of the Mind: Replaying Memories\\"; and (7) \\"Remember to Remember: Making Recollection a Part of Your Family's Daily Life.\\"<br /><br />The fifth and sixth chapters, however, throw a little of Susan Stiffelman's \\"Parenting Without Power Struggles\\" into the mix, offering child therapy techniques and explaining why they work through the prism of brain science. Strategies eight through twelve are: (8) \\"Let the Clouds of Emotion Roll By: Teaching That Feelings Come and Go\\"; (9) \\"SIFT[, or Sensations, Images, Feelings, and Thoughts]: Paying Attention to What's Going On Inside\\"; (10) \\"Exercise Mindsight: Getting Back to the Hub[, or, Learning to See Your Internal Forest for the Trees]\\"; (11) \\"Increase the Family Fun Factor: Making a Point to Enjoy Each Other\\"; and (12) \\"Connect Through Conflict: Teach Kids to Argue with a `We' in Mind.\\"<br /><br />Their premise is that these twelve strategies help \\"integrate\\" children's brains, that is, \\"coordinate[] and balance[] the separate regions of the brain\\" so as to optimize mental health. Using the image of a child inside a canoe floating down a river, they explain that veering close to the bank of chaos leaves the kid feeling too out of control to relax whereas drifting close to the bank of rigidity makes the kid too rigid to function ideally (instead \\"imposing control on everything and everyone\\"). \\"By helping our kids connect left [brain] and right [brain]\\" - as well as their \\"upstairs\\" and \\"downstairs\\" brains and implicit and explicit memories - \\"we give them a better chance of [finding] . . . harmonious flow between the[] two extremes,\\" which in turn will minimize tantrums and other results of \\"dis-integration.\\" Of course, they warn, the results won't be perfect both because we should expect imperfection in ourselves as parents and because kids are biologically unable to always \\"be rational, regulate their emotions, make good decisions, think before acting, and be empathetic.\\"<br /><br />So far all we've got is clever packaging and some fun analogies for pretty standard knowledge regarding keeping kids calm. The true deliciousness of what Siegel and Bryson bring to the table is a self-awareness that is two-fold, one not unique and the other truly so. First, like Medina, the authors apply their knowledge of the brain to their own project, creating a structure that maximizes retention and usefulness, including the descriptive \\"strategies\\" as chapter sub-headings, a \\"refrigerator sheet\\" that summarizes a few details under each strategy, an \\"ages and stages\\" chart that emphasizes different applications for children of different ages, and acronyms (e.g., \\"before you over-analyze the situation, HALT and check the basics: is your little [one] simply hungry, angry, lonely, or tired?\\").<br /><br />Second, and most thrilling, the authors provide graphics and suggestions for talking to kids about the way their brains and bodies work, giving children an opportunity to consciously take part in regulation of their own emotions and behavior. For the past few years, I've tried to provide my toddler with ownership over her well-being, telling her about some of the parenting techniques I read about, giving her a head's up that I intend to use them, and then chatting about their effectiveness. But I've never read about doing this in a parenting book, and certainly haven't heard anyone suggest starting with brain science. At their suggestion I said to my toddler, \\"You know how when you're happy, your brain puts a smile on your face? Well, the same thing works backwards a little. If you smile for a while, even if you're sad, you'll start to feel a bit better.\\" And that's just the beginning. Pretty freaking cool, guys.<br /><br />Finally, I want to share two interesting tidbits from \\"The Whole Brain Child\\" approach that contradict standard parenting advice but perfectly align with my parenting instincts:<br /><br />\\"An upstairs tantrum occurs when a child essentially decides to throw a fit. . . . A downstairs tantrum is completely different. Here, a child becomes so upset that he's no longer able to use his upstairs brain.\\" With respect to the former, parents ought to follow standard advice, ignoring the antics and enforcing pre-established boundaries; when the latter type of fit is in play, however, \\"a completely different parental response is called for . . . much more nurturing and comforting.\\"<br /><br />\\"In high-stress situations, engage your child's upstairs brain, which is where his higher-order thinking takes place. Rather than triggering the more primitive and reactive downstairs brain with the `Because I said so!' card, ask questions, collaborate, and even negotiate. The more you can appeal to the upstairs brain and engage him in critical thinking and processing, the more your child will think and act and decide, rather than simply reacting to what he's feeling.\\"<br /><br />On the \\"eh\\" side of the scale, \\"The Whole Brain Child\\" is more useful for older children than younger ones, is often redundant and long-winded (darned brain scientists trying to make information stick), and isn't as comprehensive as \\"Parenting with Love & Logic.\\" But there's quite a bit to celebrate here. Though Spiegel and Bryson don't offer much that's new in the realm of what parents ought to do, \\"The Whole Brain Child\\" adds value to the genre in providing the why and organizing the what into an easily understood, memorable, and, yes, at one point even \\"revolutionary,\\" how.before you over-analyze the situation, HALT and check the basics: is your little [one] simply hungry, angry, lonely, or tired?\\").<br /><br />Second, and most thrilling, the authors provide graphics and suggestions for talking to kids about the way their brains and bodies work, giving children an opportunity to consciously take part in regulation of their own emotions and behavior.

B0090SI4OC|5.0|My current top three directors in no particular order are: Joe Wright, Joseph Kosinski, and Andrew Niccol. All three of them know how to use visuals to tell an amazing story, and harken back to the good-old-days of film-making when it was a craft perfected by great directors. I've been a fan of Andrew Niccols (okay, a raving lunatic fan) ever since I saw GATTACA as a teen and had my mind blown into a million pieces. Since then I've contemplated how much better Truman Show would have been if he directed instead of just wrote the script, I've been deeply encouraged and satisfied with the Bonnie and Clyde masterpiece In Time, and now, in opinion he may have FINALLY cemented the kind of attention he has always deserved (according to one Website I checked prior to this film's release the box office average gross of all of his films combined was a measly 20 million).<br /><br />GATTACA had amazing cinematography and acting (and a very good musical score), Truman Show had a great concept, and In Time had a an incredible idea and compelling world that made for an incredibly entertaining film. And this film....demands that you buy the Blu Ray as soon as humanly possible.<br /><br />When I realized that this movie was based on the book by Stephenie Meyer the first time I saw the preview, I was ready to write it off as an afterthought. But as the trailer progressed the same thing happened to me that happened to me when I saw the Tron:Legacy and Pride and Prejudice trailers. The visuals were SO well done, the film looked so well made and excellently crafted, I was instantly made curious. And when I saw that it was written for the screen and directed by Andrew Niccol I was ready to laugh like a madman for joy. This feeling was not misled.<br /><br />While the fans of the book (which I have not read and am in hurry to do so) may have issues with truncated story, removed characters, condensed plot, etc, I have no such issues. I am watching this film on its own merits. And great merits they are. This film is superbly well directed. The cinematography could be a showcase for you Blu Ray player and plasma TV. Some of the sets look like the director took one look at the best concept art and said \\"I don't care how much it costs I want this image EXACTLY on screen and breathed to life.\\" Between waves of wheat under a ceiling of solar panels, vast desert vistas, and canyon vistas, the scenery on this film is spectacularly filmed. The actors all do a very admirable job with their roles, but the characterizations have a feel that some people may not care for.<br /><br />I suspect that like me, the director may relate more to the undercurrents and backgrounds of life, and the internal thoughts and emotions of people rather than their outward appearance. What I'm saying is that this film is outwardly awkward and internally subtle, and I think introverts will be drawn to those kinds of characterizations more than other types of people. For others who just read the surface, they will find the characters are much too cool and distant, the romance laughably bad rather than laughably enjoyably good (think Star Wars or Hitchcock romance). And despite the awesome acting on the part of the main character, some people just might get tired of the endless internal monologue. I didn't. But some people might.<br /><br />As for my point of view, both me and my wife enjoyed the film enormously despite its shortcomings and perhaps a few flaws or holes (mileage will vary on how excusable they are). This is a movie that I can just sit back and enjoy, soaking in the gorgeous visuals and entertaining characters. I'll be picking up the Blu Ray along with Oblivion sooner rather than later. Now if Joe Wright would just make a version of a Tale of Two Cities I could die happy...rits they are. This film is superbly well directed.

B003QP4NPE|1.0|Anti-utopian world is woven from technology and philosophy that meets economics and behavioral science. The author creates a world where the rules constantly change, slowly defining through steps forward and backward a sort of logical hell that we live in. One can easily admire the architect of this world. Plato would be proud.<br /><br />However, Steinbeck would not. The reader searches for a protagonist, finds one, and then agonizes over the removal of the character. This happens repeatedly until there is no concern left for these characters. As the abrupt ending nears we are buried in manipulated violence without a care for the outcome of the individuals or the society itself.<br /><br />Yet the seeds of excellent characters are planted repeatedly. Clearly the author removed them with bold intent as he constructed and deconstructed his worlds. It's entirely possible that other readers will find this novel brilliant in the way it violates accepted methods of writing and rips into the fabric of our culture.

0765325950|2.0|I just finished this thing today, finishing the series 18 years after beginning the first volume. The last three volumes of this series contained enough plot to last about a book and a half. I read the first 11 books over the course of about 10 years, and enjoyed those very much, with my satisfaction beginning to wane after volume 10.<br />The pace of the plot had begun to slow after that point.<br />The plotting of the last three seemed designed to stretch the story out as long as possible.<br />This volume wraps up the saga in 906 pages and could have been cut by a third without losing anything significant, in my opinion. Lots of action, and all the threads neatly tied up,  but about midway through, I began to wonder if Mr. Sanderson was being paid by the word.<br />I got the last five volumes in the series from library because I knew I would never read them again.<br />One of the things I liked about the book was the confrontation between Rand and The Dark One, where they discussed the nature of evil.<br />For those who enjoyed the majority of the series, as I did, by all means read the rest. But I found this last volume overlong and utterly predictable.<br />I hate to be blasphemous to fans of The Lord of the Rings, but this overlong tale reminds me of a criticism of that series -- that three-volume work is essentially the same story told The Hobbit, which in my opinion, was far more enjoyable.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This book is far from boring, a bit silly at times but not boring. It depends on what you like, it's a story about college kids. It had good parts and the parts others thought were bad, was just kids learning to grow up. I would prefer a more mature book but base on what the story was about, the book was good. Silly but good
B006Z476J8|3.0|Holy keeerap, I'm about to buy this again for what, the fifth time now? Why? Because each subsequent reissue has different unreleased tracks. It is one of my favorite albums, but I'm docking 2 stars for greedy record companies (Charly, Fuel 2000, now Universal) who can't get it together and just release ONGF with all the subsequent singles, studio, live, and outtake tracks. Really, to get anywhere all this material now, you have to get this, BOTH Charly versions, and Darlings of Wapping Wharf Laundrette. Yes, there is lots of duplication with that. Universal gets docked stars for spreading less than 2 CDs worth of material across 3 CDs. Pure greed, really. They could at least have thrown on the singles and more outtakes.

B00BD05PEW|5.0|Carnotaurus is my favorite dinosaur, and when I saw this one from Papo, I had to pick him up. I already had the Tyrannosaurus, and I love it to death; this figure is just as great, if not better. I don't know a ton about dinosaur proportions, but being an art student, I'm VERY picky about a figure's detail before I buy it. The Carnotaurus has beautiful detailed scales all across its body, and every other aesthetic detail is fantastic. The teeth are well-defined, the tiny spikes and bull horns on the head are pointed and fearsome, and the puny little arms are laughably accurate. My only complaint is that I wish the stripes were as dark as in the stock photo; they are a bit faded. That's nothing to really complain about, though. Another thing that was more surprising was his size; I thought he would be much bigger, but it's a good size as it is and scales great with my Rex. I can't recommend this Meat-Eating Bull enough. He'll fit in great with any dinosaur collection!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Colleen Hoover is becoming one of my top 5 authors.  This book was well written & intriguing. Can not wait to start Point of Retreat. Start reading the series & you will not regret. You can relate to these characters. Will be a rollercoaster ride of emotions.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show, I have the first 2 season and I go back to view them at least every 3 months or so.
B00683JLXA|2.0|awful sounds, this was my first impression.. why u did this to yourselves? destroying such a promising game with such horrible sound effects?
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book is nice to have by your bedside and is a good read before going to sleep.  Motivational and gives you a new perspective on life.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Love the Reacher books. This one had a lot of twists and turns. Very enjoyable. Lee Child needs to write faster.
B00BIVN82M|2.0|Big Fan of Michael, have been so even before he was known here in the USA and have followed his career since then.  Love this man's performance in a live setting.  Have been fortunate to have seen a few of his shows and was thoroughly entertained. And, I do agree that he, indeed, will have a long presence in our life as a musician, an entertainer.  But, I just can't give this album a good review.  This one just does not do it, for me, in-fact, found it to be quite boring and not up to par with the quality work of his that I am so used to.  First off, the sound quality of the entire album is nothing to be desired, feels like it was recorded in someones garage with not the best recording equipment.  Michael sounds as if he's just going through the motions, not really putting any effort, or at least that's how it came across to me.  I have an awesome sounding stereo, both in my home and in my car (audiofile freak), but even so, the Cd still lacks in sound quality.. what happened?  Also, the song selections of most of the covers are weak and Michael just does not do them anything special, like he had in the prior older releases.  With his new stuff, I had to skip each one, not pleasing to the ear at all.  I really hate to give this such a bad review, as I did try very much to like it but, no.  Bad is bad.. There are a couple of songs, worth mentioning, that were very nice, Have I Told you Lately, Young at Heart & Never the Less.  Glad I did not pay more then $10.00 for this one.  Will be selling mine.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a great series.  I'm looking forward to seeing the next season.  Great show!  Thanks PBS for airing it
B00683JLXA|2.0|This game is OK but not great. We as consumers deserve better, but as a free app of the day it's not bad.  Would I be happy if I paid for it: no. But for the most part I'm just a miserable human being too begin with, so...
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|The movie started out good and had a lot of action.  Then it just slowed down until it landed at the end
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|Read the book first,then watched the movie. Loved the book and loved the movie, though they were totally different. I thought Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper were phenominal. The supporting cast was great and the story itself was true to the book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Wow. Keeps your interest from start to finish. Can't wait to start book two. I hear the other. Two books are just as good.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I just got this and have not examined its features, but I love the selection of sounds.  The volume can be turned up, so I plan to use it as a white noise source in my office.  Maybe I'll use it as a sleep aid as well.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|We love this movie! I was especially pleased with the price and how quickly the movie was shipped. I would recommend this movie to everyone!
B00006G8HX|4.0|Finally, now we have Star Trek II, III and IV.  Hubby is an avid ORIGINAL Star Trek series and movies fan.  Love Amazon's quick service.
B0051UH6YM|5.0|This book is highly entertaining, whilst educating in an almost subliminal fashion. I totally fell in love with the humor, and learned some valuable lessons along the way.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|This movie has a bit of everything and especially great acting. One of the best movies I have seen in a while. I'm not a big Tarantino fan but he nailed it with this movie.
B00A3VLJCE|1.0|No instructions, no guide.  For one who is not tooo familiar with Photoshop, it is too hard to manipulate. I have no idea what to do with it.
B0064W67IM|4.0|The Sandman is a novel for those that like to think about the tensions that lie between good and evil, pleasure and pain, the mundane and the divine. I enjoyed it immensely. Neil Gaiman did a wonderful job of mixing in Greek mythology, Judeo Christian narratives, and various superhero anthologies into his fictional creation.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This is a great story. I love a book where you get so into the characters that you cry for them. Very emotional and intense by times, but happy too. Informational and thought provoking.
B000W93CXQ|4.0|A quick read. Makes you think. Good narration and easy to follow dialogue. I gave it four stars because I am 29 and it is clearly a young adult book. It would be a good book to read in a high school class to start a discussion on suicide.
B0089XH38M|3.0|It is one of the best \\"free\\" virus checker.  I like it and have use it for years and they keep improving it but, of course, you do not get all the features with the \\"free\\" version so the \\"free\\" version is sort of a \\"teaser\\".  I use Microsoft's \\"Defender\\" and I buy IOBIT's Advance System Care, but that's about it for my PC's.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I like the case and  the price was good. I recommend it to Kindle users who like the color purple.
B006LR0XLM|2.0|Tried it for a little while but removed it in favor of a better \\"cloud\\" product with more storage and easier to use.  A private product on more secure servers.  Enough said.

B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I had heard SO much about Angry Birds that I decided I had to try it.  Play goes fast, but it's just kind of without purpose.  Maybe I'm missing something.
B006GWO5NE|2.0|what can i say about this cord, besides you get what you pay for? I got this for a couple bucks, compared to the $10 for an actual Amazon brand. My kindle does not like it, says its a low power charger, and because of this, takes my kindle 10+ hours to charge from around 24% to 100%. great if you need a backup to use to move content only, but horrible as a charger. Would not recommend to anyone needing a replacement charger.
1416955070|3.0|The Upside:<br /><br />Most of the classic tropes you expect of 2000s YA low fantasy, City of Bones executes exceptionally well. The magic of the world is beautifully integrated and described, the good vs. evil stakes appropriately, earth-shatteringly high. You've got your heart-wrenching triangular romance, both of the boys surprisingly deep and alive given their rigid badboy/safeboy archetypes, and also plenty of fun, easy, unforced jokes and banter.<br /><br />The Downside:<br /><br />Six words: The beginning, the ending, and Clary.<br /><br />I know, that sounds like the whole book. Keep in mind there's still very enjoyable magic, banter, and lovable boys stuffed into the spaces in between, but those are three pretty serious problems.<br /><br />The first chapter actually made me put the book down the first time I tried to read it. In it, Clary sees what she thinks is a murder, follows the murderers into an isolated room alone and unarmed, helpfully reminds them that murder is illegal, and threatens to call the cops. With a straight face.<br /><br />Seriously. I couldn't stop laughing.<br /><br />Clary doesn't wise up much after that either. She stays the bland, whiney, generic sort of character one expects to find bearing the writer's name (Sorry, Ms. Clare, I know George Lucas did it first, but it had to be mentioned). She spends most of the book gaping in passive awe at new bits of magic, describing the more interesting characters' deeds from the sidelines, and being manipulated through what little action she does have to participate in.<br /><br />Her treatment of Simon (the safeboy corner of the triangle) is reprehensible, much worse than the usual painful but relatable \\"I don't know how I feel!\\" or \\"we're best friends, why do you look hurt when I talk about my love life?\\" She's not just confused about their relationship; she routinely forgets about it entirely. This habit does set up one of the most intensely heartstring-yanking scenes when Simon himself points it out, but she doesn't improve at all because of it.<br /><br />The end isn't laughable, but it does go on for chapter after chapter of different combinations of character confrontations and monologues about complicated ancestral drama, long enough to wear out the patience that the fast-moving middle saves up. The previous generation's story eclipses the current one, with some of its fine points explained and analyzed to excess while present day details (like how everyone who dislikes Clary gets a total personality transplant in the last chapter) are given only token mentions. And still, Clary does next to nothing of consequence.
B00AH8FTT2|3.0|much and all as i read the whole collection it was mainly because i bought it and don't like to waste:)the last book was a let down didn't seem to add much to the collection.

1936608898|4.0|I have never seen my son dive in to a book like he has this one. Not even Harry Potter, which he absorbed like oxygen. He's gotten to be a fitness freak and his food intake has become a crucial part of his being. Killing his mom and me (slackers) as we have to be a bit more circumspect in our grocery shopping. I mean, I just got a call from my son from the grocery store asking me to look up a sauce recipe in the book and IM him a pic of it so he could get the ingredients.<br /><br />So... if you're into total fitness, this must be the book for you.
B000001ZSE|5.0|Great music, and well worth the cost. This CD has an early 80s, European feel to it, that will lift your mood. Just great!
B0089LOG02|5.0|Our book club chose this for the book this month and truthfully, based on the synopsis, I didn't think it would do much for me.  I loved and hated to see the book end.
B00B2166BS|2.0|Does it work? Yes. Is it convenient? Not for me.<br /><br />I have a leather cover that has an opening for this cable, that said, the magnet is weak and doesn't stay attached. If I use it without the cover, it works and stays, but still it is too easy to move the table a bit and have it unplugged. I'll wait for Google's move on this.

B009R659L8|5.0|Ins and outs and unexpected outcomes. Delightful reading experience. The author takes you for an adventure. I would recommend this book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|A very, very good story. It's a well written emotional look at the joy and sorrow of life, the cold but sometimes tender universe and how they can impact young people forced to be mature beyond their years. I'm a fan of Mr. Greens different Youtube shows and decided to give the book a try though it isn't a genre I would normally read. Once I began it was very hard to put it down. Excellent work!
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I really enjoyed this show as I'm a big fan of Broadway.  It makes me feel like I'm part of the production.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|The storyline was wonderful you did not know if the charter was going to run again when things got serious. And meeting the man and his two children It was the best thing or was it for her at that time in her life. Then the story took another turn and you did not know when the next one was coming. I recommend this book to anyone who likes surprise in their books.

B00BDSRKHO|4.0|My favorite genre of music is New Wave. I grew up with it. There is something about the post-punk, synthetic quality of New Wave that has always fit comfortably like a glove for me. Whether it was OMD, Human League, Eurythmics, Howard Jones, Thompson Twins, Thomas Dolby, New Order, Kraftwerk, Joy Division, The Cure, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Creatures, Depeche Mode, Yaz, Erasure, Naked Eyes, Men Without Hats, When in Rome, Alphaville, a-ha, Dead or Alive, Pet Shop Boys, Simple Minds, The Fixx, Wang Chung, ABC, U2, Big Country, Information Society, Ultravox, and many others, they all hold a special place for me.<br /><br />OMD came later, as they did not become popular in the U.S. until about 1985, when \\"Crush\\" was released and \\"So In Love\\" climbed the charts. In fact, my first OMD album was 1986's \\"The Pacific Age\\" when I was 14. It wasn't until the early 2000's that I actually completed my OMD catalog and discovered their earlier works (I obviously had some select tracks from their early albums on their numerous compilation albums, but never a complete picture).<br /><br />I'm not sure why OMD weren't as big as some other New Wave artists of the day. They had all the right ingredients to have more than \\"So In Love\\", \\"If You Leave\\", \\"(Forever) Live And Die\\" and \\"Dreaming\\" be their only true hits in the U.S. But that is history, isn't it? Hindsight is 20/20 and all.<br /><br />So when, in 2010, they released their first new album of all new material in 14 years, I could not have hoped for more. When I heard they were going to continue to make new music, I thought it was terrific that they weren't just cashing in on the New Wave revival craze of the past decade, but that they were actually going to carry on as a band--something many New Wave artists have not truly done.<br /><br />And then there's something different about OMD. They are actually trying to give their fans, particularly their long time fans, what they want. Go figure. Instead of sounding tired and rather out of ideas like Depeche Mode does to me now with \\"Delta Machine\\". OMD sound reinvigorated. Regenerated. \\"English Electric\\" is a testament to this. 12 tracks that all work together nicely. 12 tracks that are much more concise and focused that the diverse sprawl of 2010's \\"History of Modern\\". 12 tracks that capture the essence of OMD in their earlier and later works, and yet, somehow the band has pulled off something entirely likable and memorable at the same time.<br /><br />The \\"Dazzle Ships\\"-like sound collages of \\"Please Remain Seated\\", \\"The Future Will Be Silent\\", \\"Decimal\\" and \\"Atomic Ranch\\" all set the futuristic tone of the album--the Kraftwerk-like, robotic future of a post-apocalyptic world. This is framed with tragic relationship debris such as first single, \\"Metroland\\", plus \\"Night Cafe\\", \\"Helen Of Troy\\", \\"Stay With Me\\", and the failure of science in \\"Our System\\", \\"Kissing The Machine\\" and \\"Final Song\\", plus a tribute to robotland in \\"Dresden\\".<br /><br />I am hoping this isn't the end for the band, and that in two or three years from now they release another gem. The great thing is that \\"English Electric\\" is not a carbon copy of \\"History of Modern\\", nor is it a carbon copy of their earlier works \\"OMD\\", \\"Organisation\\", \\"Architecture & Morality\\" or \\"Dazzle Ships\\". It's good to have OMD back in the game to give us New Wave fans an alternative to Depeche Mode's \\"Delta Machine\\" or Pet Shop Boys \\"Elysium\\" (both released in the past 12 months).<br /><br />Here's how \\"English Electric\\" compares to OMD's other works:<br /><br />1980 Orchestral Manoeuvres In The Dark: Three Stars<br />1980 Organisation: Four Stars<br />1981 Architecture & Morality: Five Stars<br />1983 Dazzle Ships: Four Stars<br />1984 Junk Culture: Four Stars<br />1985 Crush: Three and a Half Stars<br />1986 The Pacific Age: Three and a Half Stars<br />1991 Sugar Tax: Three and a Half Stars<br />1993 Liberator: Two and a Half Stars<br />1996 Universal: Three Stars<br />2010 History Of Modern: Three Stars<br />2013 English Electric: Four and a Half Starse Stars<br />2013 English Electric: Four and a Half Stars

B00CDT41RY|3.0|If Gene Wilder, Harvey Korman, and Mel Brooks(from Blazing Saddles) had been featured, it would have been complete.  I found the humor too subtle, the gunfights too surrealistic, and the use of gore way overdone.  But if you are in the mood for mindless viewing, it was ok.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Once I started this book I could not put it down. Then, when I finished it, I needed to read the second one right away....and then the third. It became my obsession for a while. Exciting, addictive and an &#34;on the edge of your seat type story&#34;.
1451668945|4.0|This book had too many characters which was a little too confusing. I had a lot of trouble keeping the many characters and their names straight while reading this book. I feel the main characters could have been more well developed. MHC did keep me in suspense however this was not one of her best books but not a bad one.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I do like books with a happy ending. Good must always concur evil for me. There was a lot more action in this book. I would recommend it to most people.
B0036S4C6G|5.0|One of the best books I've read in years. Stories work both as separate entities and as a whole. Characters are real and vivid, Egan's writing is masterful. Highly recommended.
B003Z49LYO|4.0|If you like novels or movies surrounding the late 1800's to early 1900's with romance, heart break, and all the emotions we as human beings are prone to, you'll like this movie very much. Although I would have chose a different ending to the story, it was still worth watching.
B00CEF014E|5.0|What I loved about this book, was that I honestly did not know what was going to happen next.  A girl wakes up to find her husband gone.  As she tries to track him down, we start to wonder -- is he real? Did she make him up on purpose?  Is she delusional?  Is she being set up and manipulated?  I won't give away the twists and turns that ensue, but they are well thought out and genuinely surprising.  This book was a quick read and as it got going, I could not put it down.  I wanted to find out -- what's going on here?  And -- no spoilers here -- was shocked by the truth of this situation.  Very cool suspense novel with a dark and twisted path to the  end.

B003JBI4F0|1.0|I don't hate this book. It's just that I was expecting to use actual VBA coding for Excel, not building Macros USING Excel.<br />FWIW, this book is probably ok for an intro to Excel and the 'Dummies' people would have been better served if they had just dropped the 'VBA' from the title.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|This is more simple than a lot of fantasy flight games, but it's still awesome. Great FAOTD. I'd love to see more board games turned android apps. I'll pay good money if they work well.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a game that will definitely challenge your powers of observation and creative thinking. Amazing graphics, even on a basic Kindle Fire. Well worth the price, and I'll be keeping a lookout for new chapters.

B001TKD4ZI|4.0|I enjoyed it and I would like to read more. I can't wait to see what happens when the next book is released.
098478280X|5.0|This is pretty much interview for dummies. If you have no clue how interviews are done and what kind of questions to expect, then go ahead and get this. The book is insightful, up to date, written by an author who knows what she's talking about.<br /><br />However be aware that you're interviewers know this book as well, that how they got their jobs. So the evil masterminds that they are, will surely try to twist the questions a bit. They may even ask you questions that are not at all in the book (how rude of them!) but this is a good starter, after which you should build up your knowledge of algos and structures by travelling through the magical world of internet. This will not get you a job per say but it will help you in being considered for one.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|this movie was depressing and not at all what it was depicted as, a comedy. It made marriage and kids seem like the worst thing in the world and how much it sucks.
B008764ZQ4|5.0|If you liked the movie and its music, buy this.  We listen to it straight through over and over and there are some great party tracks and medleys on here, too.
006056251X|4.0|I enjoyed this book from beginning to end. I loved the witty and at times sardonic words that flowed from the mouth of Sebastian. You love to hate him...but you DO love him. For a rake, he is thoughtful in his gestures and  hot as hell with his kisses. I would recommend this book because even though the story may sound familiar, Sebastian and Evie are in unfamiliar territory and their story will keep the pages turning. I had to re-read the book the next day to be sure I didn't miss anything.
B00632HWOG|1.0|It worked good in the beginning.  I got my Fire for Christmas and about 4 months later it won't open MOST of the time.  I shouldn't have to get on the computer to check my mail, when I have a nice lil device.  They really need to fix these damn bugs.
B005LAII80|5.0|As a fan of Judge Dredd in comic form since 1987, wanting a kick ass Dredd movie has always been a dream. 1995 saw Stallone placed as the lawman, and that, for lack of a better word - failed.<br /><br />This time around, we have Dredd. Karl Urban was slotted to play the lawman. My first Urban experience was in RED, and I really liked him there. Picturing him as Judge Dredd, was hard for me, but I kept an open mind, because I felt he couldn't do worse than 95.<br /><br />Can I say I was totally floored and mesmerized on opening night? Not only did Karl Urban pull off Dredd, there were times you forget it's Karl and can just see Dredd from the comic come shining through. Finding out later the Karl Urban, himself, is a Judge Dredd fan as I am was icing on the cake. Olivia Thirlby and Lena Headey added so much more to the movie with their portrayals of Cassandra Anderson and Ma-Ma. I made sure I purchased this on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />As a side note, I have heard about the knock off RAID-Redemption. And I can say Dredd holds it's weight well. Raid, is nothing but a knock off made with Dredd's storyline and few changes here and there. Yes, I watched Raid, and I was appalled at the blatant rip off done by the director. So much so, I went back and watched Dredd twice in a row, to clean the film from my eyes and mouth.
0142410349|4.0|I had to purchase this book for a literary theory course, and it had a surprising amount of material open to discussion! Quentin Blake's iconic illustrations add a new discursive dimension to the text, whether it be through the lens of Marxist, Gender, or Feminist theory.<br /><br />The story is also very short--students can finish it in like an hour. If there are any lit theory teachers out there, please consider this book.
0385349947|1.0|I am writing this comment without having read this book; I did see the author on an interview TV show. I am 67 years old and have \\"grown up\\" twice. The usual way first; the second time after suffering a traumatic brain injury with coma. I love to read scientific books about how our brains develop and what makes us the way we are. I'm currently reading \\"Brain Sex\\" by the Geneticist, Author, Psychotherapist, Neuropsychologist, BBC Producer/Director Dr. Anne Moir.<br /><br />Dr. Moir scientifically demolishes the we're-all-the-same idealistic feminist notion in her well written book. The \\"will to lead\\" is stronger in male brains, except in social situations where female brains are superior to males. Ms. Sandberg is a successful business woman who seems to have extrapolated her female strength in social (networking) success abstractly to all other women. Abstraction, is not one of the average women's brain strengths.

B00A8MGLAI|4.0|One of the most beautiful films I have ever seen, I believe that the message of the movie was so ahead of its time that in the future, people will look back on this movie in awe at how masterfully it was accomplished. The critics were wrong with this one; this movie deserves a place in every film library as it is a lovingly crafted film by very talented film makers.

That being said, the characters are very well developed and you find yourself really pulling for the protagonists.  You will not be disappointed reading these books.  I've lent the set to over 15 different people with various likes and dislikes and they all reported loving them.

0307474259|4.0|I am not giving this 4 stars because I particularly care for the hard to swallow message that all those delicious cakes and breads I so enjoy baking are what is secretly (or not so secretly) making me fat and are probably going to be the death of me, but more because unlike everyone else who apparently read this book, I actually *enjoyed* the scientific literature.<br /><br />Even though I am overweight (boo), I am not sedentary nor do I have no control over what I eat or how much I eat and it was nice to read a book that more or less proved my point. The fat-shaming that seems to go on these days (and now thin-shaming) is ridiculous. A person is not always overweight simply because they lack self-control and moral fiber. The scientific research that went into this book is actually pretty compelling and it was nice to see that it spanned more than 40 years of research. I also enjoyed the little anthropological studies Taubes threw in as well as being sure to include some slight differences for men and women (like the fact that women typically get heavier after menopause due to the deficiency in estrogen experienced, which has a big part to play in insulin production and how your body utilizes either hormone).<br /><br />I am not sure how his lifestyle would work for someone such as myself (and maybe you), who really loves sweet things in the form of bread or cookies and enjoys cooking for other people as well, but hey, I can always give it a try in moderation. Some literature online from people who advocate the paleo diet suggests restricting carbohydrate intake to somewhere between 100-150 grams daily for sustainable weight loss, but I imagine that with most things, it works differently for every person. Certainly, curtailing your carbs down to less than 20 grams daily off the bat is crazy for most people. I would think adjusting your diet to reach that point in slow moderation might be the best for most people who are so used to eating carb rich foods than just swearing them off cold turkey as he advocates, but hey, that's just my input on the subject.<br /><br />In any event, if you enjoy reading about food nutrition with a bit of science thrown in, you will probably find this an enlightening read, even if you hate his message of 'carbs are evil and you should shun them'.earing them off cold turkey as he advocates, but hey, that's just my input on the subject.<br /><br />In any event, if you enjoy reading about food nutrition with a bit of science thrown in, you will probably find this an enlightening read, even if you hate his message of 'carbs are evil and you should shun them'.

I remember playing a version of this on a pc at one time and found it fun, but there is no functionality here...at least not in my experience.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|It just was not as good as I thought it would be, I think the ending was vague and a let down

B003TSEL7S|5.0|I have been avoiding the Percy Jackson book because they seem very juvenile and I'm nearly 30. When I downloaded the book onto my kindle I didn't realize it was part of that series but after the first book, I'm hooked. Very well written and the story really draws you in.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Boy. You either love this film or you hate it -- no in-between. As for myself, I'm in the former camp. Yes, it has some rough edges and a hestant jerkiness in the acting and editing, and Napoleon himself is not entirely sympathetic, to say the least. There is, however, an earnest sincerity about the picture, and its tone and set of messages hit the bull's-eye when it comes to speaking some deep emotional truths. If quirky and offbeat and iconoclastic are adjectives you feel at home with, you'll take to it. I certainly have over the years.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I could not stop watching this series, however I prefer to get this best deal so I watch it on MTV.com instead of paying $2.00/episode.
0316056863|5.0|While the hardcover book is easily transportable and by turns hilarious and moving, I highly recommend the audio version of the book read by Tina herself.  Her humility, comic delivery, intelligence are all inspirational.  Her stories of an awkward childhood and her break into comedy, her adventures in dating, the trial-by-fire foray into writing and performing for Saturday Night Live show us that there is hope for ugly ducklings who just happen to be smart and funny.  We've heard her audio reading on more than one long car trip, and it never ceases to amuse.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|This movie was mildly interesting.  It seemed like more of a same old story.  Acting was good and the special effects were ok.  Probably would never watch it again.

B000FA675C|3.0|I have read this book twice. Once in paperback and once on kindle. There is no doubt that the book is a commercial success but that is no guarantee of literary excellence. The beginning is slow and full of descriptions that have little to do with the plot of the story. It seemed to me that the author had done a great deal of careful research but couldn't resist the temptation to dump it all in the story. The man dying from a bullet in his stomach seemed implausible. How could he place clues in different locations and think up ciphers for his granddaughter to solve? I think he would have been screaming his head off until he bled out. The pace picked up in the middle of the story which I thought was the best part. The escape from the bank, the private plane were all plausible in the story if a little far fetched. The end is a let down. It appeared to me that the author didn't have a satisfactory conclusion and just threw in a few miscellaneous ideas. There are a number of sinister characters, an archbishop, an albino monk and a police inspector who may have been bad or possibly on the good side. Plenty of security breaches and treachery. A good one time read if you haven't got anything better to do.
B00280LYIC|5.0|The only word I can use to describe this book is Amazing! It's a wonderful story with lots of twists and turns, I couldn't stop reading! By the way I'm a 13 year old and this book is good for boys and girls of all ages.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I'm 300 pages into the book and loving it! It's a page turner. It is nice to know how politics came about and hearing about Lincoln, I wanted to a little bit more of the history of this great President. Would recommend it to anyone. :)

0446554995|5.0|The last in a trilogy featuring FBI agent Aloysius Pendergast who has discovers that his wife, who died in an animal attack while on African safari, actually survived.  In this final installmant, Pendergast discovers his wife's true origins and her role as a victim of a massive conspiracy and targets the perpetrators. In the process, he also discovers a link to a New York serial killer.<br /><br />The plot is as wild as Preston and Child get, taking Pendergast to South America for resolution.  I dislike trilogies on principle...by the time you get to the second or third book, you've already forgotten the details of the previous, much less the pleasure of reading it. But this is a good book and hopefully the authors will resist embarking on any more trilogies for awhile.<br /><br />It irritates me to admit that to describe any aspect of the plot would be to give key elements that make reading the entire book so enjoyable.  So I will refrain.  But you won't be disappointed.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I was actually upset that there wasn't a next book in this series. I liked the progression of the story and the characters. I hope the next book comes out soon.
0156027321|5.0|The \\"Life of Pie\\" tells the story of a survivor of a shipwreck in the Pacific Ocean. We know he survived because of the Author's Note to start the novel told us. (You must read the Author's Note to understand what's happening in the novel.) Mr. Martel tells us about a man he encountered from Pondicherry, India told him, \\"I have a story that will make you believe in god.\\" He was skeptical but assured by the man that this would be the case.<br /><br />Mr. Martel set the tone early.<br /><br />\\"My suffering left me sad and gloomy. Academic study and the steady, mindful practice of religion slowly brought me back to life.\\"<br /><br />Religion is a part of the story. It's a part of the narrator. It's a part of his life in India. It's a part of the survival on the boat. And it's a part of the story that may turn off many readers.<br /><br />There's a scene early on, after we learn how Piscine was named, and nicknamed, where holy men argue with themselves and Pi's family about his religious beliefs. It felt a lot like the jokes when you were a kid that started out with, \\"The priest and the rabbi enter a bar...\\" It felt satirical, though I'm not sure if it's Martel's voice or that of his narrator. It felt like we were being told, \\"It doesn't matter which religion you follow as long as you believe in God.\\"<br /><br />Ravi, Piscine's older brother, had the following reaction to news that Pi was trying to follow multiple religions at once.<br /><br />\\"Ravi had a field day of it when he found out.<br /><br />\\"`So, Swami Jesus, will you go on the hajj this year?' he said, bringing the palms of his hands together in front of his face in a reverent namaskar. `Does Mecca beckon?' He crossed himself. `Or will it be to Rome for your coronation as the next Pope Pius?' He drew in the air a Greek letter, making clear the spelling of his mockery. `Have you found time yet to get the end of your pecker cut off and become a Jew? At the rate you're going, if you go to temple on Thursday, Mosque on Friday, synagogue on Saturday and church on Sunday, you only need to convert to three more religions to be on holiday for the rest of your life.'<br /><br />\\"And other lampoonery of such kind.\\"<br /><br />There are italicized chapters in the first part of the story, before the boat sinks, that pull the reader out of the story. I didn't mind them. It lent credibility to the narration of this tale being given to Mr. Martel, rather than Mr. Martel feeding us text. It attached emotions to the \\"present day\\" Pi and his family. In one of the present day scenes after the allegoric ones, there are references to the man still following several religions, which made me question whether the message was in fact meant to be satirical, or if we were supposed to believe that men of religion would act so over-the-top. I also found it odd that Pi grew up with a cosmopolitan family--neither the father nor the mother emphasized religious practice--yet as a young boy he felt a need to identify with God. (Perhaps that's the American in me talking, I don't know, but I was raised Catholic, and my mother had to pull me, nail marks on the floor, to get me to go to religious studies, lest I miss my Saturday morning cartoons...)<br /><br />The religious aspects of the novel quickly descend to the background, and once the boat sinks, you're there with Pi, the zebra (that poor zebra!), Richard Parker, the hyena, the gorilla, the turtles, the flying fish and the dorados. Every time I picked up this book I was back on the Pacific Ocean and while I never worried about Pi's survival I did worry about Richard Parker, and I wanted to find out what all they faced and how it all ended up. How did Pi make it to Canada?<br /><br />\\"Richard Parker has stayed with me. I've never forgotten him. Dare I say I miss him? I do. I miss him. I still see him in my dreams. They are nightmares mostly, but nightmares tinged with love. Such is the strangeness of the human heart. I still cannot understand how he could abandon me so unceremoniously, without any sort of goodbye, without looking back even once. That pain is like an axe that chops at my heart.\\"<br /><br />The bottom line: \\"Life of Pie\\" was the winner of the Man Booker Prize, so you don't need me to tell you the writing is excellent; from the characterization and descriptive prose, to the pacing (a 319 page novel with 100 Chapters makes you feel like the story is flying, like those fish into Richard Parker's grasp) and the strategic use of repetition and foreshadowing, Mr. Martel's product is top notch. That said, if you are the type of person who can't stomach reading about religion, or even the hint that you should believe in God, move along; you'll hate \\"Life of Pi.\\" But if you can suspend disbelief and take the religious symbolism for what it is, Pi's life will be a most enjoyable ride.<br /><br />-Raeden Zenould abandon me so unceremoniously, without any sort of goodbye, without looking back even once.

B009AMANH4|5.0|This film fills me with a sense of nostalgia that leaves me wondering if we are still fighting that age old civil amongst ourselves only this time everyone could end up being a slave. I truly understood him calling slavery and oppression a disease that must be purged from our union if we are to become one. The amazing acting of Daniel-Day Lewis and directing of Steven Spielberg really brought the era of the civil war to life in a way no seen for quite sometime. I am happy to recommend this amazing film to anyone who enjoys a little natural history.

However I was not enthralled by the bland way he represented the Iranian people and their culture in the movie even if it was a true story. I do feel after watching the wonderful film but I would really like to see a movie from his own heart rather than regurgitated facts from past obviously meant to instill the public's trust in the government.

B00AN0KGWE|5.0|At first I was not sold on it, sounded like another boring lords & ladies drama. Don't get me wrong I like King Arthur, in small doses like a 2hr movie not a Season.<br /><br />Well thanks to the flu & HBO's talent for TV marathons I happen to catch a season 2  episode where more than a little drama was going on... Not sure if the fever was inducing hallucination's I kept watching & liked it. It kept my attention, the characters, the story, the depth! So now I have to start from the beginning while my DVR records S3 & I don't tell my friends I'm watching it so they don't spoil it for me.<br /><br />Although I did see S3 opener, it just makes it all the more interesting and draws you in. Yes it's lords & ladies but with Dragons, Wolves, Zombies, Witches, Warlocks and enough plot twists to make your burst. Don't get to attached to anyone, everyone is fare game to be killed in this epic series.<br /><br />A mush watch over & over!

B004KTSWYS|4.0|This movie bears repeated viewing, thanks to the smart plot and brilliant performances by the lead actors and actresses. It's such a delight to watch Helen Mirren work the heavy machine gun relentlessly decked out in a gorgeous white gown. Bravo!<br /><br />The crisp Blu-ray transfer beats the DVD transfer, even when the latter has been up-scaled to 1080p. Multi-channel audio was expectedly rich with good dynamic range.<br /><br />As for the keepcase, upon unboxing the Amazon cardboard shipping box, I discovered that it was cracked at several locations. Fortunately, the enclosed Blu-ray/DVD flipper disc seemed unharmed. More care should be taken to prevent such damages from occurring.

B005K17RU0|2.0|This app worked half the time and the other half was updating.  It would give me weather in my location and every day I used it, I would have to reset it.  Don't download, it's not worth the hassle.

B001B6EAOY|5.0|I would say this product works as advertised. I have used two 32GB MicroSD on this adapter for a total of 64 GB memory (59GB when formatted).<br /><br />Here are some tips to make sure the card works:<br /><br />* Make sure your two MicroSD cards have the same class (A class 4 cannot work with a Class 5, it has to be both class 4 cards). Haven't tested with a Class 10 MicroSD some people are reporting it won't work.<br /><br />* If you intend to use the adapter for PSP/PS3. Always format the card with your PSP or PS3, don't use a PC to format it as your PSP/PS3 won't be able to read it.<br /><br />* Make sure the MicroSD cards are correctly alignment, don't force the card it as it might break the adapter.<br /><br />* Beware of fakes. The older models of the card will only accept up to 32GB RAM (16GBx2), the new models CR-5400 will accept up to 64GB/128GB.<br /><br />* When you format the card they are essentially in RAID format. You cannot use the cards unless you format it again if you ever decide to upgrade. Card in slot 1 cannot be used in Slot 2 and vice versa. You will get corrupted data.<br /><br />* It works when you use a 16GB with a 32GB or any memory combination configurations as long as they are the same class of cards.

B00AFROVQC|5.0|I stumbled upon book#1 in the fantasy section and decided to give it a try.<br />I couldn't stop reading it.  A fun escape and coming of age story of young boy learning that he is destined for greater things in life than herding sheep.<br />After 4 days, i found I had downloaded the 4 book in the current series and eagerly await the next installment.

1439153663|5.0|Kathleen Grissom breathes beautiful life into each character, layering them in ways you sympathize, love, hate, etc. with each one. They are each distinct and when you read in that POV, you feel exactly what the characters feels. When you switch to another POV, you enter into their psyche. I hated to leave them and miss them even now. The storylines are woven expertly with no frayed hems or loose threads. You will want to leave the big house and live in the kitchen house too and wish never to return.

B00027JYLC|5.0|Image: The transfer from the ancient B&W is well done.<br />Sound: Clear and perfectly adequate.<br />Extras: Most informative.<br /><br />It's a pity that there remains only about 62 minutes of the original film. Why no more than this? See the extras.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great stories, acting, location, can't wait from week to week to see what is going on with this family and the wonderful staff in the Abbey
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Starting with &#34;Songs About Jane&#34;, Maroon 5 has captured some great rhythms and lyrics in most of their albums and &#34;Overexposed&#34; is right up there. &#34;Fortune Teller&#34; is a gem, &#34;Payphone&#34; get some anger out, and of course all the Top Ten tunes like &#34;Daylight&#34; and &#34;One More Night&#34; are catchy. A good collection of songs you'll enjoy listening to for a long time.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed and can't wait for Season 4! Characters and all their foibles are so interesting .Loved the authentic abbey and costuming...
B00136NUG6|5.0|EW & F is a blast from the seventies past with dance tunes to keep your platform shows moving. Some of the best of the Funk era are here such as &#34;Serpentine Fire&#34;. Great compositions, lyrics, and jazzy funk.
B009G7ZYPY|3.0|Ok, so first I want to say that Susan Boyle has an amazing voice to rival such leading ladies as Elaine Page or Patti Lupone. My faith in her ability is not in question.<br /><br />My problem with this album is that she sings every song to the same tempo. Almost all of them sound alike. One or two are actually supposed to be sung at that tempo and those she comes close to hitting the nail on the head (Bring Him Home and especially Memory). Unfortunately there's not really any song that sticks out. The only exception is This is the Moment. In this song she has some more gusto and actually comes close to singing it the way it's supposed to be sung.<br /><br />It is a huge pet peeve of mine when artists take a song and slow it down. I very rarely like that. Now, Linda Eder's version of On the Street Where You Live is a fine exception, for she makes it very different with all the jazziness. But Linda Eder knows how to mix it up on her Broadway albums.<br /><br />So, all in all, this album: very fine voice, but boring continuous tempo. Appropriate for my grandma, but probably isn't to to catch the ear of those below 40.

B001OQCV6A|5.0|I finished reading The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes collection shortly before buying the movie.  I loved the stories, and was joyously entertained with this movie rendition of the sleuth and his chronicler, Watson.  Robert Downey, Jr. perfectly played the part, even though the storybook character is older.  Irene Adler's presence in the movie was a great nod to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Comparisons to the book aside, the movie is action-packed, with sophisticated humor. It will keep its entertainment value for repeated viewings because it's that well made. Solid 5 stars!

This and Lonerism by Tame Impala were my two favorites from 2012.
B004N6369Y|4.0|I love Danielle Steele 's ability to rope me in and keep turning the pages.  I liked being a part of the life inside a fancy hotel.  Sometimes I find her writing repetitious but usually it works to emphasize something about a character.  It couldn't' get top ratings because there wasn't much of a story.  Some of her books have stories that remain in my memory.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|It was written so very well. The author brought me through the progression of the disease and how it effected both Alice and each of her family.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Enjoyed the book immensely.  Look forward to seeing the movie.  The book is definitely character driven and the<br />author did a fine job.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great app to have a quick calculator, especially when sharing what your crunching with others.<br />The directions come up with the app to help show how easy it is to use.<br />I have this on my favorites!
B00BI6SSMC|1.0|I've been a fan of Iron and Wine for a while, but the change in direction of the music has slowly been losing me.  I don't like this album at all.  I prefer the stripped down acoustic songs Beam used to do.  There is nothing here that engages me at all, sorry to say.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I asked a friend – a sound editor & filmmaker who works on a budget – what kind of headphones I should buy and he said this model without a moment's hesitation. Clear, true and crisp range, almost surround-sound dimensionality, and profoundly dynamic bass response. Extremely comfortable padding, muffles outside noise without being completely sound-eliminating (so you could, for example, still hear someone shouting across the room at you) & a cord extensible to about 9ft I think.<br /><br />What are you waiting for? Buy this. It's probably the best $100 I've spent in a long time.
B005HEVBGG|5.0|Loved the show the first time. Even better now that I can watch it whenever I want. No problem with downloads and speed is great.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I completely and totally enjoyed this wonderful novel!<br /><br />Ms. McKenna has spun a delightful tale that has depth, humor, and realism. I do hope she considers writing a sequel with these two great characters!
B009X01C64|5.0|Other than the price, what is there not to like about this cover? It is thick and very protective. It is sturdy. While it is thick, it doesn't seem to add too much bulk to the Kindle Fire HD. It has a lot of options for standing the case, both in landscape and portrait mode. It has a little handle for you to hold on to while it is folded in the back (granted, I never use it, but I know some people like that feature). And to make sure it stays closed, it has a little elastic strap to hold the cover closed. Also, when you open the cover, it turns on the device for you. I've got no complaints about this case and it is the perfect way to protect your Kindle. That only thing is that you have to spend some decent cash in order to do so. Right now, it is $55, which is a quarter of the cost of the device itself. But, you aren't going to get this much protection and features for less, and this truly is a wonderful case, so you have to decide if the cost is worth it. I decided it was and have no regrets with this.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Some people post stupid reasons to hate this game. For one example people complain about the update not being here yet. I too am excited about it, but I understand that it takes time. They also blamed this on Notch, technically though it is Amazon's fault. Others I can understand such as not downloading and some glitches. That is also because Amazon simply doesn't have as much quality as Apple. They are cheaper though. I also saw a scientifically based reveiw, which is stupid as minecraft is a fantasy game. It's a game idiotic people!<br /><br />As for me I love this game! I also play on a Xbox 360, but this makes playing portable. The multiplayer works great too. I do wish it was cheaper, but it is really fun and is worth the money it costs. Yes, they could add more things. Awesome game!
B000FA675C|5.0|Great story! I bought the Spanish version for my dad and he loved it also. Very intriguing and entertaining. Definitely recommend it BUT keep an open mind.
B005FQ2H8W|2.0|I returned (AT MY EXPENSE) the first DVD (a 1980's western ????).  I then called the sender's listed number and re-requested that I wanted the ORIGINAL Philadelphia Experiment documentary based on the 1940's actual experiment. They reassured me they had it. When I received the order it was the &#34;Fiction&#34; movie based on the 1940's experiment !!!<br /><br />I kept it and watched it anyway -- not returning a second movie.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Nice interactive simulation game. I've played other interactive animal games and this one by far looks the best. Only complaint so far is that it seems to take forever to earn gems.

B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|Emma I believe, is Austen's longest novel, and may be considered the most complex, indepth one.<br /><br />The plot in short goes as follows: Emma Woodhouse, a wealthy, well-meaning but immature heir to Hartfield, in the village of Highbury, takes up the hobby of match-making. Emma attempts to bring together her friend Harriet Smith and Mr. Elton, with unsatisfying results. When Frank Churchill comes to visit his father, Mr. Weston, Emma and he make fast friends, much to the dismay of Mr. George Knightley, and sceme about Ms. Jane Fairfax. The story ends when Emma discovers her own true match, after many trials and tribulations.<br /><br />The book starts out a touch slowly; don't give up too soon! This novel is well written (most Jane Austen stories are) and very funny, Emma Woodhouse is nearly impossible to dislike, even if you don't approve of what she's doing. There are many different characters, so you may have trouble remembering them all at first, after the first read it gets easier. You may find it helpful to see it as a movie first, [[ASIN:0767020308 Emma]] with Kate Beckinsale in the lead role is the best in my opinion.<br /><br />This book is definately worth a read, it is most enjoyable.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Do not get up for a break, if the popcorn is not with you forget it. You do not want to MISS a second of this film. HOLY COW this movie is an emotional roller coaster (all good). This is one of those movies I will buy and keep in my collection. The acting in this movie has OSCAR nomination written all over it. Just a great job overall on this movie.

B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book thoroughly, and couldn't put it down. I found myself staying up later than intended just to keep reading on once I was hooked. I really enjoyed the way it was written, and would've given it all the stars possible, but the ending left me a bit deflated. I kept waiting for justice to prevail. Once I got to the end I couldn't believe that it was over and it was a bit let down. A sequel perhaps?
0486290492|5.0|Sense & Sensibility is one of Jane Austen's more popular novels, and for a good reason; it is a wonderfully entertaining, humorous, and romantic story.<br /><br />The plot in short, goes as follows: When her husband dies, Mrs. Dashwood and her three daughters, Elinor, Marianne and Margaret, are forced to move from their spacious estate Norland Park, to a cottage in the country, offered to them by her cousin, Sir John Middleton. In the process, Elinor, the more realistic and pratical sister, is separated from her newly aquired friend, Edward Ferrars. Marianne, always romantic and idealistic, snubs a friend of Sir John's, Col. Brandon, and turns her affection toward John Willoughby of Allenham. The two oh-so-different sisters learn to cope in their changed world, as they search for their partners in life.<br /><br />This is one of Austen's best works, and a personal favorite of mine. The storyline is fairly easy to follow, and though there are not so many characters as in her other books, they all will absorb your attention and sympathy, they seem so real and human. To make understanding it easier, you may want to see it as a movie first, [[ASIN:B0012OVCE6 Sense & Sensibility / Miss Austen Regrets]] with Hattie Morahan and Charity Wakefield is the most true to the book.<br /><br />This is a fun and engaging story, I hope you like as much as I do. Enjoy!

B00BIVN82M|5.0|I was a little nervous about buying \\"To Be Loved.\\"  I did not like \\"Crazy Love\\" AT ALL, so I made sure to listen to all of the track samples before buying Michael Buble's latest offering.  I am so glad I bought this CD!!!  It is rich and textured and diverse, and BEAUTIFUL!!!!  My personal favorite selections are  \\"Who's Lovin\\" You\\" (very soulful and sexy!), \\"Something Stupid\\" (Reese Witherspoon's voice blends nicely with Michael's), \\"It's a Beautiful Day\\", (very catchy and upbeat for a break-up song), \\"After All\\" (nice pairing with Bryan Adams), \\"I Got it Easy\\" (a heartfelt homage to his wife), and the swing mix of \\"It's a Beautiful Day\\" (this is on the extended version of the CD, which was well worth the extra money for this track alone).  Michael Buble's song choices can be surprising, but this time he chose very wisely.  He sings passionately and elegantly on each track, and it sometimes feels as if he were singing only to me!!!!! (I wish!!!!!) In my humble opinion, this is Michael Buble's best CD since \\"Call Me Irresponsible.\\"  If you buy \\"To Be Loved\\", you will not be disappointed!

B00C1XZ2LQ|3.0|One of the things I love most about being a film score reviewer is the opportunity to discover new composers at the beginning of their careers. It's even more exciting when the said composers find themselves attached to a potential box office smash - which is exactly what has happened to Anthony Gonzalez and Joseph Trapanese with Oblivion. Both these composers worked on the soundtrack for Tron Legacy a couple of years ago, with Trapanese orchestrating and conducting Daft Punk's score, and Gonzalez having some fun with various remixes via his band M83, and Tron's director Joseph Kosinski has continued his mini-oeuvre of taking a popular electronica band and translating their music to film with a larger orchestral component. French-born Gonzalez's band M83 is already pretty well-established, having had several successful albums over the past decade or so, but this is his first film project as a composer in his own right. Similarly, New Jersey-born Trapanese had only orchestrated for Daniel Licht on the TV show Dexter before working on Tron Legacy, which was his first major motion picture experience.<br /><br />One thing not to expect - from either the film, or the score - is much originality. The film stars Tom Cruise as Jack Harper, an engineer on Earth decades after a war with invading aliens wiped out most of the planet's population. As the trailer says, \\"we won the war, but lost the planet\\", with half the world an irradiated wasteland, and the other half unfit for human habitation. With the survivors housed off-planet on an enormous tetrahedron-shaped space station on its way to Titan, the moon orbiting Saturn, Jack spends his days tending to the hundreds of automated drones which are extracting the uncontaminated water supply for transportation to Titan, and battling the alien \\"scavs\\" trying to sabotage the machinery. But Jack is having vivid dreams of the past, and has the uneasy feeling that something is not quite right with the situation in which he finds himself. The film, which also stars Andrea Riseborough, Morgan Freeman, Olga Kurylenko, Nicolaj Coster-Waldau and Melissa Leo, is a thought provoking, visually impressive, and engaging sci-fi romp, but it steals concepts, ideas, and visual markers from a multitude of other movies, including the entire Alien series, 2001: A Space Odyssey, I Robot, Moon and even Independence Day, meaning that any serious sci-fi fan will be suffering from a heady case of cinematic déjà vu for a lot of the time.<br /><br />So too with the music, which essentially plays like a combination of the scores from Tron Legacy, Inception and The Dark Knight Rises, with little bits of 80s-era Tangerine Dream and Vangelis thrown in for good measure. The Zimmer influence on this score is much more apparent here than it was in Tron, with large chunks of the score repeating the ostinato-driven moodiness of Inception almost verbatim, albeit with less creativity and panache than Zimmer brings to his works in this genre. Written for a full orchestra with major accompaniment from Gonzalez's electronics and an occasional rock band percussion section, Oblivion works well - and is indeed very fitting - in the context of the film. On CD, however, the limitations of the score quickly become apparent, resulting in an album which is inoffensive and generally agreeable, but somewhat underwhelming.<br /><br />It's very clear that Gonzalez does not have the knack for catchy themes and rhythms Daft Punk have, and as such Oblivion is clearly inferior to Tron Legacy on that front. The piano theme that opens the score in \\"Jack's Dream\\" is pretty, if a little lightweight, and its re-appearances in the rest of the score (in cues such as \\"You Can't Save Her\\" and \\"Undimmed by Time, Unbound by Death\\" for example) are more textural than melodic, and are so slight as to barely register on the audience. The actual main theme - a long-lined heroic piece for strings which comes in for the first time towards the end of \\"Tech-49\\" -does have a sense of nobility to it, but it doesn't have the power or memorability of others from the genre; Oblivion is not a score which lives and dies by its main theme.<br /><br />Instead, the score oscillates between pseudo-ambient textures and some larger-scale action music, accompanying scenes where the indestructible Mr. Cruise does his usual array of amazing stunts. On the whole, the more ambient music is generally very pleasant; Gonzalez and Trapanese firmly root their music in a tonal world, the orchestral lines are clean and appealing, and the synth elements are never abrasive or irritating. There's just not much meat on the bones; cues such as the distinctly Tron-like \\"Waking Up\\" tend to noodle around, presenting a series of dreamy electronic tones accompanied by rumbling ostinatos and warm orchestral major-key chords, which certainly capture the isolation and starkly futuristic beauty of the world Jack finds himself in, but do very little in terms of presenting an engaging or truly memorable musical environment.<br /><br />Some of Gonzalez's sound design ideas are admittedly quite clever; the moody, haunting textures at the beginning of \\"StarWaves\\" are effective, as are the pulsating crystalline tones that combine with a more sweeping orchestral section at the beginning of \\"Earth 2077\\", which stands as probably the melodic highlight of the score. But the bulk of it is all so underwhelming, so (for lack of a better word) sterile, that it makes the listening experience go by without much excitement. Now, it could be that the sterility in the music is intended to mirror the sterility of the environment in which Jack and Vicki reside, and if that's the case then Gonzalez has done his job perfectly. It's a stretch, but you never know.<br /><br />One major set piece, the \\"Canyon Battle\\", is easily the score highlight, a rollicking, thrusting action sequence which starts steadily, building up steam, but really lets loose during it's second half with an arrayof flashing string rhythms, brass clusters and electronic pulses that raise the adrenaline levels considerably. Elsewhere, \\"Odyssey Rescue\\" clearly owes a debt to the \\"Outlands\\" sequence from Tron Legacy with its enhanced brass section and throbbing percussion element, which gradually grows to showcase the first appearance of a more rock-based sound, with a standard drum kit and a more urgent rhythmic element. The final third of \\"Losing Control\\" is Inception-lite, while the opening minute of \\"Radiation Zone\\" and the middle section of \\"You Can't Save Here\\" are obviously less cacophonous versions of The Dark Knight Rises, although \\"Ashes of Our Fathers\\" is pretty decent.<br /><br />Later, when Gonzalez brings his rock band drum kit out to play again - as he does in the second half of \\"Radiation Zone\\", in \\"I'm Sending You Away\\", and in the conclusive \\"Fearful Odds\\", for example - the music embraces a sort of pseudo-1980s synthetic power anthem style, which reminded me a little of John Carpenter, or perhaps something from Blade Runner, and develops an undeniable old-school charm which is quite engaging. A cue from the score's big finale, \\"A Temple of Our Gods\\", also sees the composers breaking out the choir for a sense of ooh-aah wonderment, which gives the denouement a certain epic grandeur. The conclusive song, \\"Oblivion\\", takes the more prominent heroic melodic element of the score and sets it to lyrics written and performed by Norwegian vocalist Susanne Sundfør, who brings a vocal range and sense of dynamic drama that is actually quite impressive.<br /><br />I wanted to like Oblivion a lot more than I did, because I always want to try to be supportive of new composers making their way in the film music world, and I was a big fan of Trapanese's contribution to Tron Legacy especially. I guess I just had trouble connecting with Oblivion's general sense of unremarkableness; this, combined with the intentionally old-fashioned sound of some of Gonzalez's electronic samples, the familiarity of the orchestral lines, and the obvious over-reliance on it's Zimmer-inflected temp track, left it firmly in the middle of the road. There's nothing really wrong with Oblivion at all, and in the film it leaves a positive impression, but as a standalone album it somehow gets lost in an overall sense of \\"heard it all before\\" .

1475143389|3.0|This book focuses too much on childish, egotistical bulk building instead of developing ideal fitness and of course the nutritional advice is hugely flawed as in most health books following government/industry nutritional guidelines corrupted from special interest groups such as the pharmaceutical, agricultural, and food processing industries.

B003UBTX72|3.0|Kind of like the guy who &#34;wrote&#34; it. If you can get past the boring time of his early years you will find a bit of insight into one of the greatest bands of all-time. I'd rather read Charlie Watt's take on things.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I loved this quirky book. Rarely does a book keep me up at night but I found myself reading into the wee hours. The authors style reminds me of Nick Hornsby only better. The main characters so likeable.  I highly recommend this book!
B000FA675C|4.0|I saw the movie when it was released and thought it was interesting, but just OK. After reading the book my opinion of the movie is one where I wish they had actually done the book justice. I really enjoyed the book and found it fascinating.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|I discovered Ellie Goulding purely by accident. I meant to watch a video by Lana Del Rey and accidentally clicked the link for Goulding's Halcyon. Once she started to sing I realized I clicked something wrong, but there was something about her voice that held my attention. So I also listened to Lights and liked that too. I went ahead and got the Halcyon CD. Now I have to admit that it had to grow on me. After the first listen there were only two songs that I thought I liked (Halcyon & Lights), but strangely I found myself singing the chorus to 'My Blood'. Strange, since I didn't remember liking it... So I listened to the whole CD again and again and again... Not forcing myself to do so, it was just the more I listened, the deeper I listened, and the more I started to really really like this CD. Goulding has a very unique vocal style. I'm not very good with vocal terms, but it ranges from the bird like highs to this breathy tone. I liken her voice to Lykke Li's, but Goulding's voice stands out on its own. With Halcyon she has done a Phenomenal job of  combining lyrics, instrumental and voice together to convey the emotion behind each song. I'll be recommending this one to my friends.
B001ENS0BI|5.0|This is a fantastic series.  You will not be able to stop watching it until the end.  It will leave you wanting more.  However, the ending is a surprise and not what I wanted to see!
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Growing up I enjoyed watching Columbo. I got the collection on a whim. I figured it would mostly sit on the bookshelf and I'd maybe watch an episode here and there when I was bored and had nothing else to do. Wrong!! LOL!! I'm on season 4 now only after having it about 4 weeks. I actually don't recall any of the episodes I've seen so far (guess it was just to long ago), but I do remember Columbo's mannerism and I'm enjoying watching him again. Now I normally do not buy old TV series because the plot/story lines tend to be to outdated for me to really relate to them now. I'm not really having that problem with this series. The only fault I see in some of the episodes is that without the perpetrator's confession, I don't think the evidence would have stood up in court, but that can be said for just about any reccurring crime drama, even today's. So, all in all I think Columbo was a great crime drama and definitely worth having.
006074815X|4.0|As with all of the books I have ready by Ken Follett this was another good read. I did not try to pick it apart, just read it for the enjoyment of reading a good book.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|Sharp-eyed wisdom of people and society, masquerading as a romance. Austen knows as much about the human heart as anyone.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Liked the story- written in a fast paced narrative that keeps the reader intrigued.Plot and characters combine to deliver a suspense packed roller coaster ride. Great ending.
B00683JLXA|2.0|Overall not a bad game. But not very good either. The graphics are pretty standard for a free app, what kills it for me is the physics engine. Get angry birds if this is your type of game. Slightly better graphics with a far superior physics model. GL all.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|The fact that Mr Kyle was killed by a troubled vet right here in the USA after all he went through as a seal is quite ironic.  Hero is often an overused word but Kyle comes as close as I can imagine.
B005AKFXZW|4.0|I didn't think id like this book but it is so strong visually that it just pulls you in. The story is not without some flaws such as under developed characters and incomplete stories however enchanting all the same.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Great story.  Don't miss it. It is a riveting story that was really hard to put down.  The fact it was all true makes it even better.

B003405MF6|3.0|I have a lot of Beck's music, and purchased this CD on a recommendation from a friend. It wasn't as good as I was told it would be. I was a bit disappointed, but I will keep it and listen to it from time to time. Rock fans gotta love Jeff Beck.
B00001ZT6Z|5.0|Although I can't deny it: there is that \\"funny-cheesy\\" 80s' presence there in the very beginning of the album, however, I gotta say that, musically, this is one of the very best hard rock/power metal albums of all times. It is a very solid effort with not one song lagging behind. The words I would use to describe it are: \\"enchanting\\", \\"mesmorizing\\", \\"epic\\", \\"riveting\\"!!! A collection of musical masterpieces!!! Although every single song there has someting unique & refreshing to offer, I don't want to \\"detail\\" each one of them individually. But I can't not stop & mention \\"Black Moon Rising\\". I've always been fascinated by the riff/vocal inter-change there. It's like Tony Martin is hopping so effortlessly over the riffs that Tony Iommi lays down so beautifully & with presision. This album will always be one of my Top 10. If you're one of those \\"in denial\\" types who's still bitchin' about Ozzy or Ronnie gone, my advice is: just shut up & give it a few more listens because it is a really really good album!!! And I think it is definitely the most cosistent & solid release of Sabbath's Tony Martin era.
B0012GMYUU|4.0|I have been a Beck fan since I first heard Blow By Blow. I have a lot of Beck CD's, some I like better then others. &#34;You Had It Coming&#34; is a good CD with some really good tracks. I recommend it fir Jeff Beck fans.
B00BG4UWPC|5.0|Love this album! Trying to be cool is my favorite, but I can listen to the whole album without flipping through songs.
0307592731|5.0|Captivating from beginning to end. Everyone deserves to take a solo journey and this book will encourage it! The author is honest and holds nothing back about her experience. This book is not a camper's manual but rather an inspiring book about life's ups and downs and conquering your goals.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I didn't know what to expect becaise I hadn't read anything explaining what the book was about, just that people loved it. I love it.  So happy I read it and can't imagine anyone not wanting to finish it.

B0000509C4|4.0|I got this because I've seen the first one half a dozen time as a kid and thought I should see the second. I wasn't disappointed but I also grew up seeing the Nightmare on Elm Street movies so watching this wasn't too different than most of the 80's horror flicks. This movie is three seperate stories meant to entertain people who enjoy a good horror tale. My headline says it all, the last story was the best.

0307341550|5.0|Read Gone Girl, then Dark Places, then the book that felt like I'd just watched Pulp Fiction for the first time again.  This book is disturbing on so many levels.  I've grown used to disliking Flynn's characters, the protagonist in this story is probably the most likeable of Flynn's characters, but incredibly disturbed.  I HAD to put this book down a lot, leave it for a while, give myself time to rest my brain and emotions, then come back to it.  Flynn does dark, dirty and disturbing better than anyone I've read in a long, long time.  After reading her books I feel like my brain's been dragged through the mud and in need of a good scrubbing.  I absolutely love Flynn's writing, she's so honest and matter of fact in her writing style.  Highlighting sentences has become big for me reading her work, there are things she writes that just hit the mark for some reason.  I can't wait for her next novel, I'll be downloading the minute it's available.
B00013RC8O|5.0|This is one of the top 100 movies to own. I enjoyed the movie but wish it did not have so many colorful metaphors.

B00CEIGYAG|5.0|This song is incredibly catchy. But more importantly, it's also very accessible: smooth, funky, easy to listen to and even easier to dance to. I can't help but move when I hear those opening notes, and from what I'm hearing, I'm not the only one. More notably, it's getting a lot of radio play in my area.<br /><br />I have a feeling that we'll be seeing a lot of new Daft Punk fans in the next few weeks!

B00AFROVQC|5.0|I have read all manner of books in my life and am happy to have stumbled upon this series. They are well written an keep you on the edge of your seat, the characters are well written and each one slowly develops a personality of their own. Great read for the price.

B002MW50KO|3.0|Not a classic for a holiday collection. Dylan croons more than sings so don't expect to much from the album. Still it's a fun to have on the disc player when it plays on random.
0307950654|3.0|The mystery is not bad set well in early 19th century England, and does a good job of capturing the Austen characters, language, and background, which does speak of PD James' skill as an author certainly.  That said, I was a bit disappointed because the story revolves more around the Wyckhams than the Darcys.  Perhaps as more flawed characters, they are better source material.  The interaction between the Darcys is on the sidelines except at the epilogue when the the Darcys finally talk - and its a bit of revisiting old history from the book.  The rest of the time the story is mostly told in narrative with minimal dialogue between the characters.  The great delight of P&P is the dialogue between Lizzy and Fitzwilliam (Darcy), so if you're looking for a story along those lines, Death at Pemberly is not what you're looking for -- but no one can replace Jane Austen of course!
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|Simple story for today's holiday time. Our addition to Holiday Movies. Not as sentimental as a Wonderful life, but a fun watch for everybody. ( Billy Niegh is a real scene stealer)
0307476073|4.0|Very enjoyable book, but don't go into it expecting outdoor adventure writing, a la Jon Krakauer. Cheryl Strayed is a people person (also a book person), not really a nature person. The nature writing here is not exceptional--in fact, not even terribly good. But the writing about herself, her family, and the people she meets on the PCT are all excellent. There are lots of wonderful sentences and observations in the book and she knows how to weave stories about her life with a hiking narrative.  There are some good backpacking tales in the book (I connected with her food cravings, sore feet, heavy backpack, and wet sleeping bags, as someone who also did long-distance backpacking as a young woman), but all that's secondary to the people-stories. Good book, but more in the \\"Eat, Drink, Pray\\" mode--not at all \\"Into Thin Air\\" or \\"Into the Wild\\".
B002SR3T10|4.0|Not the standard holiday traditional music. But if you're a fan of Jethro Tull you'll enjoy having it a your holiday collection. But I do recommend it being played in a random setting with other cds rather playing the album straight through.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game it is the best bingo ever I play it every single day I would tell all my friends to play its awesome
B0034G4P80|5.0|One of the better adaptations of a comic book. Kenneth Branagh did a surprising  job of directing. The visual effect with creation of Asgard and costumes were superb. The only draw back to the film was Natalie Portman (weak acting) Though I found the rest of the cast great and covered her flaws.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This series was filled with country beauty, humor, and wonderful characters.  I have enjoyed revisiting Lark Rise and Candleford......one video that has surpassed the book it was based upon.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I chose a five star rating because this is a wonderful and thrilling book.I loved it so much I read it in 2 days!!

B000M4RG42|5.0|One of the best things about growing older is that you have an ever-wider range of memories. For example. when I was in the first grade, I can clearly remember the onset of World War II.  We all sat around that night feeling very anxious as we listened to the radio hearing the account of the bombing of Pearl Harbor. It's something I'll never forget. Within about six months, Dad was drafted and we had to move about half way across the continent where Dad worked in a Kaiser Shipyard making Victory Ships for two years in Vancouver, Washington. We'd have air raid warnings every now and then just to get prepared if the bombers were ever to actually arrive. It was scary for a little kid, and probably for the adults as well.<br /><br />Then I remember one day how the newspaper carried a good-sized photo of a half-dozen marines raising the American Flag on the island of Iwo Jima. Everyone seemed so proud and felt that the war was essentially over. Well, it still had a long way to go but that event was a real uplifter for the American spirits. The movie tells the tale of that raising. What your reaction might  be depends on your mental framework. If you're a bit of a cynic, you might find it interesting and informative. If you're more of a blind patriot, you may find it disturbing and despise the movie. Either way, be prepared fora lot of violence and some really graphic photography. War isn't pretty, and this film will provide a lot of stomach-churning stress if you're at all squeamish. The story isn't straight-line telling. Be prepared for a lot of advances and flash backs interspersed so that the flag-raising event can be studied from many different viewpoints. Be prepared to find out that the event is not what you thought and was probably more propaganda than you had ever imagined. However you view it, the flag raising was probably one of the most important visual events ever and you'll still see the photo dozens of times per year even  though this event occurred about 70 years ago.<br /><br />This movie is very interesting and important. Don't miss it if you're interested in U.S. history. It's exceptionally well done, although it can be hard to follow because of  the structure. Well, the story isn't as simple as it might appear from a distance. There aren't any \\"movie stars\\" in the picture. If  there's a star, it should  be Clint Eastwood, the director and he should receive some big gold metal or such. Well  done! If you get interested in  this WW II event. be sure to also watch \\"Letters From Iwo Jima,\\" a story of  the same battle but with a Japanese perspective.<br /><br />Gary Peterson0 years ago.<br /><br />This movie is very interesting and important.

I'm almost done with the season and can't wait to start the next season.  It is super eerie, but great acting and some twists that I wasn't expecting.

B00B69UQEO|5.0|I am always happilly surprised with each new Depeche Mode album and this one is again a piece of art :)
0783226063|4.0|When I obtain the extended version I will have more to say.  For now, this is a pretty decent rendering of the novel, with some good casting and mostly impressive production design.  The problem is that this is the chopped-up version and you can tell that a lot of parts are missing. Most notably, the Shadout Mapes is barely there although she has a much more important position in the story.<br /><br />Otherwise, for the early 80s, they did a nice job overall.  This is the depiction of a messianic figure who comes to save the universe from evil.  Great music too.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed The Borgias....the anticipation of the each segment was fulfilled.  The actors are amazing true to character, the scenes, music, wardrobe, writing and directing had me feeling like a fly on the wall.  I want more................
B00BAYLQI0|4.0|The real family involved in this was not from England, but if you don't mind that, the cast does a fantastic job, including the three young actors playing the boys, in this moving and very emotional tale of a family separated by the tsunami in Thailand while on vacation there.<br /><br />The production crew in particular did a marvelous job recreating the chaos, confusion, and destruction.

B00AWQEKIK|5.0|I have been a fan of his since I first heard  'Bluebird' from the Buffalo Springfield's 2nd LP. THe three major influences of Blues,Latin and folk  triggered something in me. It has also been my personal musical sources of main inspiration in my own playing of music.  That said...this set is more than a 'Greatest Hits' package has all his well known songs that have had radio play over the years...but also some great demos , some variations and some nuggets from his closet .  Hearing the acoustic 12 string demo of \\"So Begins the Task \\"  that includes the verse left off his official release on the first MANASSAS LP ...that was worth the cost of the package.<br /><br />A completely enjoyable four disc set ...not one cut a dog. THank you for the great music over the years .THis made my year.<br />Want an education in clever songwriting ? then buy this set . It is impressive from start to finish . Thanks to Graham and Joel for assembling this great set .<br /><br />As to the omission of Manassas material ...............there are plenty of concert versions of songs  that were not recorded in the studio. I believe we may see a MANASSAS  box in th e near future along with a possible DVD.  THAT would really make my day .
B000UJ48XG|4.0|Some folks will hate Beirut, and think the music is pretentious & /or boring. I like his music for a change of pace, and thoroughly enjoy the unusual instrumentation. I like The Rip Tide also, and think his more recent albums are better than the early ones (like Gulag Orkestar).
B0018CVQFM|5.0|A capsule of songs that show the huge depth and talent of Mr.Nash . He is far deeper than  'Our House' or simple pop songs like 'On a Carousel' .  He is a passionate human being who looks at our condition .... feels moved by something , then sits down and writes a song.  THere are so many great songs here . REflections indeed .  I think everyone will be surprised at all the great songs found here...and some great songs that radio has not played .  'Love Work Out '  was a song he says was hard to stop recording ..they just kept playing ... well that can also be said for this set.

044024367X|1.0|This was a major disappointment especially after reading 10 previous works.  It felt rushed and slapped together and little more than a vehicle to allow Lee Child to have his tough guy character espouse half baked anti military  political positions.  I thought I was paying $10 for a Jack Reacher novel and I got a Cindy Sheehan Code Pink Manifesto instead.  If I had not already bought the next in the series to take on a trip I would be done with Jack Reacher.  Disappointing.

B00B9HEAVS|5.0|I am very surprised that Inna isn't more popular in the USA bc her music is phenomenal. Her newest CD, Party Never Ends, is definitely the best album by Inna so far and the best dance album of 2013 so far. Everything is here, from a nice Latin rhythm (Caliente, Dame Tu Amor) to Indian drums (Inndia) to just straight up awesome house music. Every track is well produced and the album flows flawlessly. I highly recommend that if you haven't heard any of Inna's stuff yet to purchase this album first. Her sound has matured, and Play & Win (her music producers)have also matured in music composition. Here are some of my favorite tracks:<br />1. In Your Eyes: (Probably one of the best songs on the album)--Love when she says \\"Ring a<br />  ding ding ding a ding a ding\\" over the chorus<br />2. Live Your Life: Just an amazing dance song with great motivational lyrics<br />3. Caliente: Simple, Sexy, and I always love hearing Inna sing in Spanish<br />4. Inndia: The snare drums rattled over a well produced song and a nice hook from Inna<br />5. Energy: This song rocks, and lives up to it's name--high energy<br />6. Shining Star: Great song, simple, good hook<br />7. More than Friends: Her collaboration with Daddy Yankee is superb, and the song has a<br />  nice, tropical vibe to it.<br /><br />Although I just listed a few of my favorites, every song is great and definitely shows the improvement of Inna as a musician, songwriter, and the evolution of her music producers Play & Win.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|there aren't a ton of truly free apps. This one isn't that either. But it also doesn't require money. You can play and earn money, adds to the challenge of playing.
B00881PTRC|5.0|the  graphics are cute and the categoies are numerous - let's of fun. I like that you can play again other players in your<br />own house - not facebook - one of the better hangman games - works great on the kindle hd
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|I love the way I feel after fasting days<br />Easy read and allows one to find his or her own way using principles from the book.
B000VX4X2W|5.0|Perfect fit, color is very nice, looks like an updated boat shoe.  My husband loves them says they are extremely comfortable.  My grandson and his two friends came over  ( they are 25 years old) and they thought they were great and that they would even be good for golfing.  My grandson wants me to order a pair.
B005K17RU0|5.0|outstanding. everything you need all in one place. I would recommend this app to anyone. accuweather did it right<br />yes
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Entertainment that keep me interested throughout the entire room.  I will definitively purchase the next version of the room.  A+ entertainment
B009VYF5E2|5.0|This is my all-time favorite show and I just can't get enough of it. The fourth season is possibly my favorite of all of them because of many reasons: Arthur shows how much he needs Merlin in several different occasions, Morgana's hunt for Emrys is so ironic that I can't help but laugh sometimes, there's a baby dragon, Arthur and Gwen are adorable, and of course Merlin's powers are as epic as usual. I've probably watched this season five or six times through already, and now that I own it I can watch it even more!
1402793375|5.0|Very interesting indeed! Their are 2 sides to every story... And television has always depicted Indians as savages, yet in reality, it was the white man who justified savage and ruthless behavior to acquire material possessions. A MUST read!!!
B007UQ5Z1G|5.0|I first fell in love with Castle of Glass, especially because of the wonderful music video. Then I found In My Remains and several other songs from the album and decided I may as well just purchase the whole thing. They're all really good songs and I'm very glad I bought this album.
B0006AUQJE|2.0|The book I received has a different cover than the one pictured. I'll still keep it, but I'm disappointed. I collect copies of Pride & Prejudice, so the cover does matter to me. I think it's fair to expect the product to match the picture.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book is a snapshot of more than one perspective on the events on a plantation.  The muli-person point of view gives great perspective on the events of one household and their extended family.  It deals with the subject of interracial relationships that are not within marriages.  My five-star review is based on the fact that the book is beautifully written, yet not beyond the reach of most readers.  The subject area is dealt with in a mature way. I would highly recommend this book.
B001QWBM62|2.0|This item was defective, as one recording mic did not work.  It probably is normally a good recording device, I just happened to get a bad one, so I sent it back and got a small Roland, which works very well and is a little simpler to use.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|it is weird because u have to buy the pets why can't go catch them or something. its just weird.
B002VHI8J0|1.0|This book is really an acquired taste and really difficult to read both in the way it is written and the language.<br />I fought my way through about one third of the book and then gave up...It was exhausting just trying to stay focused on the story line.<br />I really hated this book.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love the app. It's really fast and its  a great way to talk to your friends. You can have multiple conversations at one time. If you have any more questions about any app. Please add me to your kik contacts. Awesome101. Thanks I hope to give you more tips and answers on any app u have.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|What a great book! I spent the first nice day of the year inside with this book and have zero regrets.
B001VPJYZK|5.0|looked forever for this season. found it but the prices were outrageous. this was a great price and pretty good quality...thanks!
B009AMANBA|5.0|This is the movie that should have won the Oscar!!  Daniel Day-Lewis's performance was mind-boggling.  I felt as if I knew Lincoln as I never had before.  The rest of the cast was also great.  Also saw this in the theater & had to own it.
B004N6369Y|5.0|No surprises, but a nice story line.  Spanned several decades and flowed well.  Enjoyable, light read.  Enjoyed the vivid details.  Felt like I was visiting the hotel too.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|This is a fantastic movie that truly deserved it's Oscar nod.  Interesting throughout.  I saw it in the theater but had to own it.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|Russell Crowe was masterful in this movie.  As a professional musician, I found the constant speech/song thing irritating and distracting.
B000A59PMO|5.0|This show is so amazing, when I started watching this show I was not expecting much. I was SO wrong! If you think that this show is a teen drama knock-off. THINK AGAIN! I can not stop watching, please just watch it, it is for your own good.
0553801473|5.0|I was hooked after reading the first book in the series and this was number 5. I cannot wait for the next book but will have to wait 3 years. I want to see what happens especially to the characters Arya Stark , Brandon Stark, and Rickon Stark because their lives were turned upside down.
1451668945|2.0|THIS IS THE WORST BOOK OF \\"MHC\\" THAT I HAVE EVER READ.  IT DOESN'T EVEN SOUND LIKE HER WRITING. IN THE MIDDLE OF SOME PARAGRAPHS SHE GOES FROM FIRST PERSON TO SECOND PERSON.  TOO MANY CHARACTERS UNANNOUNCED IN THE BEGINNING AND TOOK A MAJOR PART OF THE BOOK TO GET THEM CONNECTED.  I HAD FIGURED OUT THE PLOT LINE ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH THE BOOK - USUALLY DOESN'T HAPPEN FOR ME IN HER BOOKS.  IF SHE HAD A GHOST WRITER FOR THIS ONE - GET RID OF THEM AND GO BACK TO WRITING HER OWN NOVELS.  SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|It was interesting to see how they put the books on film. It helped that I had read the books because they only touch on the different stories, in highlights, to keep the story line moving. The books are full of details to explain things and give the characters more depth. The film gives you an overview of everything going on simultaneously. It's a complicated story line.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|This is getting more and more useful every day! I have to do lists, notes from meetings, even draft documents. and I haven't even touched any of the other cool stuff yet.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I read Dark Places the last out of all three of Gillian Flynn's books... and I guess it's true what they say, save the best for last. I enjoyed all of her novels but Dark Places by far, blew my mind.<br /><br />Libby Day, much like all of Flynn's female characters is crafted to be unlikable. She is hateful, depressed, cranky and snarky. I LOVED her. I've realized as of late, I absolutely adore unlikable characters.. those bitches that you just can't STAND... the ones that would be your worst enemy in real life. Libby has all of the reason in the world to be hateful though... her entire family(with the exception of her older brother) was murdered, basically in front of her eyes. Her brother is currently in jail for the murders, her trust fund is dwindling and now an obsessed crime follower wants her to dig up her past that she has so carefully hidden away. Libby was the only character I felt any sense of attachment to though. As much as Ben was featured in the novel, and of course the focus is on trying to \\"free Ben!\\" as the Kill Club wants to, I just didn't really care about him. I felt sorry for him quite a bit during flashbacks but at the same time I wanted to punch him sometimes for his idiotic decisions.<br /><br />Of course, OF COURSE, there were about a dozen plot twists that just leave you either starting at the page like, \\"what??\\" or wanting to throw the entire book out a window.  Just when I thought I had it ALL figured out then something else would happen. Oh... and the descriptions of the book are disgusting. I have a stomach like a dog... I can basically swallow anything but at parts I just wanted to throw up. I honestly didn't eat meat for the several days I read this... I just kept picturing Debbie's doughy little leg hacked up. See... gross. And I'm not saying that in a negative way... the fact that Dark Places sickened me but I still had to keep reading that, that attests to Flynn's writing. And to be honest there is nothing I can say negative aboutthis book. Also I love the different points of view AND the different time periods. It really helped to string the entire story together piece by piece.<br /><br />The writing, of course, was phenomenal. The game changing plot twists kept me steadily reading and the Satan worshipping that took place in this book just carried it to another level. It was weird and strange and I loved every bit of it. If you loved any of Gillian Flynn's book you will adore Dark Places. It's the perfect mix of thriller, mystery and a little bit of lunacy.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|Nice book helps me talk to people because I am very shy.  It helps you start a conversation with someone of any kind.
B0063IH60K|5.0|A great solitaire app with lots of different options for play. Allows for play against other users, Vegas style, single draw and three card draw.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very deep kept your interest. Coming from Dr. That study's the brain leaves no doubts. Thanks for all the proof. God bless you.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I was surprised at how good this app is. It does everything I wanted and being free was a big plus! The ads are a minor inconvenience.
0385341008|5.0|A mystery and a love story. A friend lent me her copy and I was immediately transported to another time. I could not put it down and decided I wanted my own copy for my personal library! It is a gem!
B001UGB1X8|5.0|I caught part of this film on cable... and watched enough to know that I wanted to see it all. Imagine my surprise when as an Amazon Prime member I could watch it for free! Tommy Lee Jones, Ned Beatty and John Goodman certainly turn in stellar performances. It is rare for me to watch a film and then want to read the book (we all know that movies are never as good as the book, right?). I will be at the library as soon as it is open. Great film. Fantastic soundtrack.
B00000IZOR|4.0|Very simple and traditional good for the eye. Unfortunately the only thing I dislike about it is that the cord is to short. however, my son loves that we pretend having phone calls for him.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Now that I'm starting to get the hang of it, after few crazy mistakes (like deleting some tables and chairs), it's fun to play.
B00BRR66SA|3.0|I bought the album based on his prior work and found this current offering lacking the same quality.  Suit and Tie sounds great but the rest of the album is filled with more 'hook' than lyric.  It sounds cool to relax with but not what I expected.  I'd give this a three and a half star rating if it where available.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This installment was fantastic! Good for Kiera for making a realistic heroine! This one was a lot more intense than the first book. She really knows how to shock you! I am so excited for the final novel!!!!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is the coolest game in the universe and im not lying to you I guarantee it is so cool I like the safari were you get to find the animals
B000N2HBSO|5.0|By writing about President Lincoln interacting his \\"rivals\\", friends and family, the author gives us a greater appreciation for his moral character and brilliant mind.  The book left me with the thought that this may have been the only president in all our history that had the qualities necessary to get the country through that terrible time.  It also gives an interesting view of the Civil war as seen from his view point.
B004U8VWLE|4.0|This movie was interesting but in a good way because it had you thinking in a psychology type of way of how people in real life are also similar.
B003PJ6UHA|4.0|Just like the age old question: \\"which came first...the chicken or the egg\\"... I must admit that it is quite difficult to break out of the widely accepted  mindset that the universe came before life. Often, when I ponder my very existence, I wonder about the notion of what it would be like to exist OUTSIDE of time. But when I think about where I could have been before my birth,  or where will I be after I die...it becomes a fascinating yet challenging and almost inconceivable notion that I did not exist...or will not exist.<br /><br />I also have to admit that I was always intrigued by the fact that this universe and life itself is so perfect. I always carried the notion that \\"this universe is perfect....almost too perfect...\\".  And there are so many aspects about life that the most brilliant scientist either cannot answer or choose to ignore,I am forced to believe that maybe there exists a different explanation of why things are the way they are.<br /><br />So while looking up ideas on the concepts of death on the Internet, I ran into some of Robert Lanza's articles on death... and that lead me to this book.<br /><br />And let me tell ya...This book is pretty radical. And that is what I like about this book.  The ideas presented in this book pushes beyond the limits of what we consider as conventional wisdom about our universe. But if you study history, you will find that some of the most revolutionary people in history are people who thought outside of the box.<br /><br />But what I also like about this book is that the author talks of modern discoveries regarding quantum physics and suggests that biocentrism is actually compatible with modern quantum discoveries. I just love that!!!<br /><br />I look forward to hearing more about the ideas of biocentrism.
0425263908|5.0|Holy freakin crossfire!!! This book was amazing!!! I couldn't put it down!!! The relationship between Eva and Gideon was ... Yeah, I think you get the point. Even though they both have some serious issues of their pasts, you can see how they try to work through them in their own ways. There's a lot of possessiveness and jealousy going on in the book, but don't we all want to be possessed sometimes. Especially, if we have our own type of Gideon Cross in our lives. I definitely recommend this book to anyone and everyone that loves hot and steamy books. I can't wait to read the next one!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is awesome because I love playing it although, it is kind of confusing but after you play it for a while you start to understand how to do this and that...

B003YL4LYI|5.0|I long for the series to continue.  I can't wait for the next book.  It's an addictive tale with so may more possibilities.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Of course its a TV series, but how does DA manage to pull me in and manipulate me so? This season is just as engaging as the others, and I was a newbie to DA catching up late. You'll be as surprised and engaged and entertained as you've heard. DW does not disappoint in this manner.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I think I like this app, but I can't really remember, actually I don't even remember if I still have it on my phone......
B0040UAYI4|1.0|Not easy to set up for battlefield 3. customer support didnt help me at all. when I tried to return it they said they can not accept returns if the package was opened. how else can you you try this product if you dont open the package?

B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was okay at first, but it really lost my interest in the middle.  It has been a couple of weeks, and I still haven't finished.  I will probably finish it, just because I don't like to leave a book 1/2 read, but it is not one I would recommend.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|A love the story/plot and just teaches so much in so lil time. the next ones follow up just as well.
1427200246|5.0|Read a couple of the fish and fish stick books, moving my cheese, ducks and eagles, then this one. This is a winner. Forget the fish books, the others are good, this is great.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved this series! I was intrigued when it first came out, but I'm glad I waited to read the episodes all at once. Waiting would have killed me. There was a whole lot of description of the stairs in the silo in just the first few pages, but when you take those paragraphs against the whole of the story, it's so deep and thought-provoking, just like the titles of each segment. What a talented writer. The overall story was full of twists and unexpected events, such a thrill ride. My only complaint lies with the ending. It felt a little rushed and even slightly predictable. Also(DEFINITE SPOILER), I was concerned about the amount of time Silo 17 (the other silo) had been abandonned. Solo said it had been 34 years, but Jules steps on soft, decomposing bodies upon entering. These would have been just a pile of fragile bones after so many decades. Also, the band of children that are found are only in their teens at most, impossible if the silo had been empty for so long. But the writing is so superb that I have to give Howey the benefit of the doubt and assume I missed something as a reader. Great story, can't wait for the movie adaptation. Also just downloaded the next omnibus in the series, Shift.<br /><br />UPDATE: Never mind me and all my silly over-thinking. Hugh Howey is a genius and the stupid details I was hung up on above are totally explained later in DUST. :-)
B008JFUO4U|4.0|This film was way better than I expected going in. It features some of the best visual effects I have seen in a long time, but it doesn't sacrifice character development or a good story in the process. Oblivion feels like a much more complete movie than the director's last effort, Tron: Legacy, which was pretty much just eye candy. The musical score is also a thing of beauty. I need this soundtrack!<br /><br />I may not like Tom Cruise the person, but he can more than hold his own on screen. Morgan Freeman is always good, even in a tiny role like this. The two female leads are easy on the eyes with Andrea Riseborough turning in a memorable performance as Jack's (Tom Cruise) mission partner/lover and Olga is well...easy on the eyes.<br /><br />The story does get a little confusing from time to time and some of the twists were a bit obvious (at least to me), but by the end I pretty much had it all figured out. I will surely be adding this one to my blu-ray collection.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Of course I read this book in anticipation of the upcoming movie. I was delighted with the cool, journalistic writing style, which I thought was such a fresh and interesting angle for a genre that has basically been done to (un)death. You would think the different interviews would all begin to sound the same, but they don't. A serious testament to the author's characterization abilities. It was also interesting to see how the different nations around the world dealt with the issue, as well as their own geopolitical conflicts. (Admittedly, I had to google some of these issues just to keep up with WWZ.) As for the negatives, the journalistic style that I loved so much also kept the story from being linear, therefore, no build-up or climatic ending, which was weird. Also the appendix, though an realistic touch, often pulled me from the story, sometimes for something so trivial it didn't add anything to my understanding of the current interview. But overall, the author really thought of every possible logistical angle of a zombie breakout, from military shortcomings to clearing different sites of infection (such as the open oceans, the catacombs, etc). Excellent job. Can't wait for the movie to not measure up to the book at all. :-)
B004R0WKNE|4.0|Morning Glory a Movie for the young and old with a wonderful cast and Full of Fun, as well as Comedy.  Cast Rachel McAdams, as Becky Fuller, Harrison Ford, as the cranky News Caster Mike Pomeroy, Diane Keaton, as Day Break host Colleen Peck, and Jeff Goldblum, as Jerry Barnes who hires Becky for the Producer of Day Break.  Becky is young and has only had one other job before in producing and is let go by the New Jersey Network.  She takes her resume and sends them out getting a call for the Day Break Morning show and sells herself to Jerry Barnes who hires for the Producer of Day Break a show that is dying on the air.  She builds moral and does some zany things to make the show move up in ratings and while there falls for one of the high management News Casters who fell for her the minute he saw her.  Patrick Wilson is Adam Bennett the News Caster who is disliked by Harrison Ford's character Mike Pomeroy and so the love begins between Becky and Adam who are great in the roles they were chosen for the movie.  Great movie for a Friday or Saturday night enjoyment at home.<br /><br />Enjoy the Movie Below with the Link provided:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004R0WKNE/ref=wtls_list_pr_10/ref=avod_wl_watch_now
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked the final installment of the Hunger Games.  Personally, i liked the first two more than the last, but all three were great reads.
B000HF0ISC|5.0|The Movie \\"Sleepers\\" was a True Story and I am a New York and know just how much is covered up in institutions all over our country.  These boys suffered unbearable things by being put in an institution for boys by the Judicial System.  Most are closed now and that is a good thing.  These things still do happen and that is something this picture brings to light.<br />The young boys who acted in this were marvelous, and of course with names like Robert De Niro, Kevin Bacon Dustin Hoffman, Brad Pitt and Jason Patric they do not take on roles unless they feel the roles and movie are worth while for them and the movie audience to see.  Watch and learn what still happens to children in our country then and now.<br /><br />Here is the Link for a great movie that was ahead of it's time:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HF0ISC/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
B0074ALZ7Q|3.0|It's strange how your perspective changes as you grow older. I first read this as a teenager and saw Max as the quintessential hero tall, handsome and urbanne. But with the second reading I saw Max in a very different light. Even Mrs Danvers the epitome of gothic evil I now see in a somewhat different light.  The story is told from the second Mrs de Winters POV.  With this reading I couldn't take her perspective as being reliable, she was completely overshadowed by Rebecca<br /><br />There is a lot to love about this wonderful mystery. The stage is set with the classic opening line, \\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again\\"....It has a wonderful air of dark, dreamy foreboding and suspense. A true classic.
B009FZFONO|5.0|As a Walking Dead fan who doesn't have AMC, I was SO THRILLED to be able to keep up with the show week after week because of Amazon and how quickly the episodes became available. I will say, that since I always got the HD versions, and because I bought/downloaded the show one episode at a time, that this DID end up being rather spendy (especially given that I don't have anything to physically show for the money and buying the season in store would likely have been cheaper).<br /><br />But I have no regrets! It was always great quality and if that's what it costs to be up to date and not own cable, so be it!
B0085MK2KS|5.0|I already had a complete set of Mozart piano sonatas by Daniel Baarenboim and most of the sonatas by Maria Joao Pires, so I wasn't really in the market for another set but after hearing all the controversy over Glenn Gould's set, I was real curious.<br /><br />Glenn Gould's interpretations are entirely unique.  No matter how many other versions you have heard, you have not heard them like this.<br /><br />Mozart wrote his Piano Sonatas for his students, so they are fairly simple to play.  Glenn Gould is a master pianist and a genius and if he were to try to play these as they were written, he would be completely bored.  So what he does is he has fun with them.  He changes the tempos, phrasings, and dynamics and it sounds like he might have been improvising.<br /><br />Although these are radical interpretations, it really brings out the joy of Mozart.<br /><br />It occurs to me that Mozart was also a genius and a master pianist and I imagine that after a long day of hearing his students play these works, he would probably improvise on them if he were playing them for friends.<br /><br />Obviously, opinion on Glenn Gould's interpretations is going to divide a lot of people.  This is probably not the best set for someone who is new to the Mozart sonatas but if you want to hear them played in a completely new way and you have an open mind, you might love them as much as I do.
B008NW67E0|5.0|This is a wonderful CD by Mumford & Sons, signature sound. Well done, and need to keep up with all of their stuff.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great creative story!!  The suspense!! It was recommended to me by a co-worker and I've recommended it to others. Because its an e-book only, it made me by a Kindle since my coworker kept asking if I've read it yet. Now I'm a Kindle convert. Can't believe I haven't been an e-reader  before now!
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I really love this show, and am anxious for season 5 to be available. I am sad to know it will be the last season, so I'm glad I have bought all seasons.
B005ERYEGU|4.0|This is one if the few get to the point books. No fluffy language, no theory. Downright practical, downright implementation-ready. If you are using Salesforce.com or Marketo, this is is what all your sales reps, especially the outbound callers must read. If you have not invested in such callers, you will know why you are losing millions in not doing that.<br /><br />Again, I have made this a mandatory reading for my team.
0786955554|4.0|Lots to like here, Good variety, outstanding artwork, good heavy cardstock, You won't create massive dungeons, but the ones you lay out will be very nice. I recommend using this along with one or two of the smaller tile sets, maybe Caves of Carnage and Urban Underdark.

B00BWJARHO|5.0|This was so well done!  We enjoyed every minute of this movie.  They achieved the right mix  and brought the book to life.  Thank You.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Facebook should be optional. Not everyone even has a Facebook or want to post game spam if they do. It's not as user friendly as say sim city 2000.<br /><br />Update: I stick with my review. I have 20 million coins but cannot continue without investment points. There has to be an easier way to get these points to continue playing. It costs 30 to build big Ben but I need to expand to have space which now costs me 14. I'm not sure how long I'll stick with this game if I can't do anything for long periods while I wait to accumulate investment points. Additionally there is a problem when I click buildings if there is a truck really close to it it selects the truck and not the building no matter where I touch.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|A visual feast.  the tiger came to life and all the animals appeared so real, they exhibited the reality of the situation.  Pi is faced with a choose life or death situation. Survival in a horrific situation was made real, possible.  The photography was superior.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|too hard to follow the story line and plot<br />easier just to watch the movie.<br />might make more sense in French
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|game is one of my favorites..was so glad when the app became available for my kindle &amp; cell phone.  Only thing that I&quot;m not pleased with is the sound effects..sounds weird ...not the best game sounds..sounds like s broken record echoing in outer space
B004TI5N38|3.0|Overall a good crime story.  The end left something to be desired.  Nothing like a long complicated plot wrapped up in 4 pages.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|the game is realy to but needs an ejector seats for the jets I pesonaly think I also think you should make the hardier free and ad the superfortess
B00BD6RFFS|5.0|Great reading for beginners like me. Use of case studies is great as it clarifies more how the different models were applied in real life.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Loved this documentary; was happy to receive sooner than I expected.  No problems with quality of disc. All the questions you have about this artist are answered.
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|This movie should have cleaned up the awards.  I found the technical elements and the actors' fantastic portrayals of so many characters enjoyable and fascinating.  While I understand that other reviewers found flaw with the disjointed storylines and the time jumps, this movie actually builds subtly and thematically (as opposed to following a linear plotline) as we move around in time from one scene to the next.  It's a bit complicated for some tastes, but the end result is quite emotional and powerful.<br /><br />Other reviewers weren't pleased with the 'liberal' message and the portrayal of a homosexual relationship.  It's true, this movie is about questioning boundaries; one of the most compelling questions this movie asks is not only what constitutes transgression, but what are the relationships between transgression, empathy, love and courage to human evildoing and the boundless triumph of the human spirit.<br /><br />And despite some cliches, this movie does a good job of pointing out that quite often, there is a very real cost for daring to have the courage to hope, dream and act.  You may not be comfortable the entire time while watching this movie, but this isn't some trite, neatly prepackaged-plot Hollywood blockbuster.  You can get that any day; Cloud Atlas offers us something far more uplifting and intriguing.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I liked the way the story developed but was disappointed with the ending. Learned a lot about zoos and am really pleased that the author has lots of cautions about humans response to animals. I like closed endings so this one made me a little sad, but thoughtful, about all those stories out there which will never be known unless someone tells!
0802473156|5.0|Wonderful, Amazing book. I read it alone, and then my husband and I read it together. After reading, you wonder why you didn't figure this out. Such a life changing book! I would recommend for ANY married couple
B005AVIZ6U|5.0|Loved this one - full of surpirses and hard hitting Jack Reacher justice and morals. I have never been disappointed by Lee Child.
B009ICQ6KO|4.0|Interesting combination.....I'm a long time fan of Charlie Musselwhite. Not familiar with Ben Harper but enjoy this CD! Old South.....
B002R2B6NE|5.0|very good plot with excellent acting, kept one in suspense the entire length of the movie.  this is a great classic
B005S9EJ46|5.0|I really didn't want it to end.  I will keep it and share the experience with others.  Looks like no sequel on this one!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game and really good graphics. I love it. It's really fun too. I like that you can play and take pictures of the horse.
B00CBKXGPI|1.0|The free play on the app was fun but after purchase, the app shuts itself down. When you reopen, it hasn't saved any of your progress. So unless you like buying the same painting again and again, don't. waste your money or time. Look elsewhere for entertainment. No more G5 apps for me.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|There is a lot of glitches but it's pretty cool it fun really fun but I can't give it a 5 (sorry)
B009UWYFFK|5.0|My family has watched this movie several times already and love it! We are planning on watching it again tonight.  You won't regret buying this movie.
B004J64QSI|3.0|The overall quality of singing was far superior for 10th than 25th, in my opinion. To me that 25th version is more commercialized in order to attract new generation's attention and seek for extending the musical's popularity.
0307346617|5.0|Awesome book! If you like zombies, you'll love this one! Well written and put together ! A little slow starting, but gets better with every page!
B001NLKXK2|5.0|This was a powerful book. It had me thinking about the story long after I had finished it. Highly recommended.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|This one is definitely as good as the first one if not a little better.  More action, more characters and great character development.  I felt like I knew a lot of the girls personally.  I really hope she ends up with Maxon.  I found myself routing for him bc of all the obstacles they seem to have keeping them apart.  I thought the ending to this one was better bc it wrapped things up more than the first one.  The reason I only gave it four stars is bc the back and forth between Maxon and Aspen started to get old.  One minute she was SURE she loved Maxon and the next minute she was SURE she loved Aspen.  Back and forth, back and forth.  Overall, great book!!  I will definitely be recommending!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a satisfying read. I enjoyed the he said/she said point of view. The characters were well defined and the story took some interesting twists and turns. I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a book as much as this one!
B001AITH50|5.0|Love this movie!! Happy I could rent it, love that its low price 48 hr rentals!! Thank you for having this title
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This movie is about believing in things you can't see or explain.  It takes you back to chidhood, where life was simple and you didn't havealot toworry about.
B001TCNSOI|5.0|This movie has a great story, fine acting and holds your interest throughout.  The photography is very well done and this movie has a human interest 'till the end!
B009UZBLSG|5.0|This is a great item, and it works perfectly for me.<br /><br />I originally had some issues with my HDMI cable, it was going bad. I replaced it with an Amazon basic cable, and it's working great now!<br /><br />The only downside is that it does cost a lot for such a small cable, but I guess it's all about function.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I really like this game because it has a lot of dinosaurs and because you bild stuff that is why I like it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is a great game it is great fun and FREE.I like this game because it is highly addictive and I can't seem to be able to put my kindle fire HD down it is a fantastic game for people of all ages and I can't find any problems with the game at all the creators have done a brilliant job!! WELL DONE!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best character development I've seen for a zombie flick. Daryll is hands down the best! Got rid of Andrea<br />thank god.
B00364K6YW|5.0|This is probably the best and closest version to the Jane Austen's novel Pride and  prejudice. It is sophisticated and yet very entertaining.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Okay movie. Visually stunning like Lord of the Rings, but tends to drag after awhile. Should have done better editing and gone for a two movie setup rather than with all of the filler scenes that obviously got created to get three movies worth of money out of the book.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|This is second book of series and believe there is some of Jack in each of us. I enjoyed it but wish there would of been more with Sorenson and Jack teaming up in future adventures instead of her dying as she did, maybe a love interest.
B0024Y9EYS|4.0|Good start for a series. Nice original writing. I hope they are able to keep it together and not crash in season 2. It gets a little weak toward the end of season. Writers are falling into the habit of using same plot whitewashed with different details.
B0055PMJMW|3.0|I'm a Michael Connelly/Harry Bosch fan & was disappointed with this purchase. The stories  were short & lacked the usual substance I've come to expect from Michael Connelly.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Fun visual movie but a little lacking in plot. Daniel Craig still shines as a straight to the point, able to be cold to the bone, do what needs done Bond. Villain was very weak. Javier Bardem's acting skills could have made him one of the top Bond badies but plot holes and mediocre writing causes villain to never really come together. Judi Dench still cracks it as the best M ever, but she too gets burnt by the movie's general failing. Toward the end, I kept expecting one of these very talented actors to look at the camera and apologize. Worth watching but they really need to rethink Bond movie direction.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Their games really cool but needs updates there no mine cart and you can't  put water but besides it's cool
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|will have to eventually get all 3 when they come out but love the Lord of the Rings trilogy and had to have it and service was so fast, thank you!
014241493X|3.0|Given the reviews for this title as well as the stellar reviews of his other works, I had high expectations of John Green's \\"Paper Towns\\". Unfortunately, \\"Paper Towns\\" fails to deliver on a number of points. From the decidedly unsatisfying ending to the beat-'em-over-the-head philosophy lessons, this book leaves much to be desired.<br /><br />\\"Paper Towns\\", for its faults, does offer readers a fairly exciting plot (complete with ticking clock down to the last hour) and a cast of characters with whom many in the target audience will relate. The voice of the main character, Quentin, rings true. Quentin's friendships, romantic interests, and familial relationships are believable and multi-dimensional. Readers will find themselves rooting for Quentin et. al every step of the way.<br /><br />The most off-putting element of \\"Paper Towns\\" is sprinkled lightly though the first two thirds of the book, and poured on far too heavily in the final chapters. Beating readers over the head with blatant thematic statements and philosophical descriptions of the extent to which one can truly \\"know\\" or \\"imagine\\" someone outside him/herself becomes irritating very quickly. Teens and young adults are quite capable of inferring meaning from text -- stating it outright, OVER AND OVER, borders on insulting. At some junctures, reading this book felt like sitting in a poetry class, where Whitman's \\"Leaves of Grass\\" is being taught to a classroom filled with yawning students.<br /><br />Although there is a lot to like about \\"Paper Towns\\", its merits are decidedly offset by its flaws.
B00395ZYVS|2.0|The story started out very intriguing, but sort or fell away toward the middle and after that.  It was an okay story, a little boring.  Some of the characters she intoduced in the story, were not elaborated on and left the reader kind of scratching their heads about them.  The ending was good. The author told the story very one-sided culturally, and only detailed the women in the story more than anyone else.  This was a book club read, and I would not recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game. I just wish there was a greater variety of horse breeds. I'd like to see arabians added.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I laughed aloud at the Irish humor,  and wept inwardly at the pain inflicted on Eighty-six. One of the most moving books I've read.  Kudos.
B00354Y9ZU|4.0|I appreciate Seth Godin's ability to look at things from a slightly different perspective for everyone else. This book is an inspiring call to unleash your best self and stop asking for permission to be great. Godin mentions Stephen Pressfield's &#34;The War of Art&#34; a few times, and uses Pressfield's definition of &#34;the resistance&#34; throughout. Having read Pressfield's book prior to Godin's, I believe I got more out of &#34;Linchpin&#34; than I otherwise would have.
1451648537|5.0|This is a terrific book. It's extremely entertaining and informative. It tells the true story of Steve Jobs -- warts and all. I wrote a blog about it after I finished reading it -- which meant that I read it twice -- once for enjoyment and once for taking notes.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|i just love this tv programme, its the best, i have watched it more than once and i never get enough of it. so happy they put it on prime too i get to watch it fr free, one of the best shows to come out of england. being a british person living in america is hard sometimes, trying to find british tv can be a challenge. Thankyou amazon for the kindle fire and prime.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|loved playing this game. awesome graphics, hidden object games &amp; story. hope there are more where this came from. can't wait for the sequel.
B0017QSZW6|5.0|nce again, i love this show, i have watched the whole seaso numerous times and i'm in the middle of the final season right now. i try to find as much british tv as i can on prime, and i cant wait to see what else amazon manages to get in the future. &#34;Footballers wives&#34; on prime would be good too. keep up the good work amazon.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|I love Huey Lewis.  This is a GREAT CD and I play it all the time in the car. I sing along now because I know most of the words. It is a feel good CD.
0345529057|4.0|Came well packaged with the books intact. Would recommend for any fan of the series. Good deal for what it is If you don't mind paperbacks
B009NZQDW2|5.0|Anything that invves Tarantino is an instant hit. This movie is no different excellent group of actors and a great original story 2 thumbs up!
B0076DELIG|5.0|This book had an excellent main plot with several subplots.  It was engaging and complex, yet easy enough to follow.  That doesn't mean that it was too simplistic, however.  There were subtle human interest stories, and I never knew exactly how it was all going to turn out.  Several characters had enough details to flesh them out into live personalities. That way, I was truly interested in them without getting overwhelmed with too many characters or too much detail.  Quite absorbing and satisfying.
B0097AQEOK|5.0|joni mitchell, one of the greatest songwriters of the 20th century, is presented here in her prime.  packaging is attractive though simple, but music is sublime.  highly recommended for fans of music that is melodic, intriguing, challenging and a consistently rewarding listen.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was well-written and kept me involved.  The plot kept moving with a variety of twists and human interests.  It never became stale and it was intriguing.
B00BCV3HGU|1.0|Well, it HAS been a while, hasn't it? What with one thing and another, this is going to be my first negative review in almost a year. And a whole lot has happened in the world of music since then; Justin Bieber has went from kid friendly pop scrotum to being more hated than the Boston Bombers. The UK version of The Voice continues to be a high profile mega-flop and a song was broadcast on Mars for the very first time, an auto-tuned headache called \\"Reach for the Stars\\", which could very well cause the first interplanetary war.<br /><br />So what do all of these have in common? Music's public enemy number one, Will.I.Am, of course. For it is he who is one of the four egomaniacs sitting in the revolving chairs in The Voice, AKA World's Worst Talent Show, it is he who has brought in the, er, \\"talents\\" of Justin Bieber for this record and it is he who unleashed that unprovoked and aggressive attack on Mars. For better or worse, and it is most certainly worse, no matter how bad he gets, no matter how much he lowers his own personal bar, Will.I.Am just keeps getting bigger and bigger. This is a problem.<br /><br />The Curmudgeon has reviewed this man's work before, of course. His time with the Black Eyed Peas has resulted in some of the worst pop singles in the last 30 years, and yet he seems to have the sinister drive to make whatever atrocity that came before seem not quite as bad as what comes after it. I've done a bit of research on this, and the results are fairly alarming. Feel free to take notes, because this is serious business.<br /><br />When the Black Eyed Peas first started out, minus plastic faced anti-talent Fergie, they were a socially conscious hip-hop act, not opting for gangsta rap and instead using live instruments on stage. They released some pretty acclaimed material back then, as well. When Fergie joined the group, they had a string of huge hit singles, some of them admittedly not that bad at all. \\"Where is the Love\\" had a nice, MJ style chorus and a positive message and \\"Shut Up\\" was kinda fun as well. The stink and rot would set in soon after. What follows is a series of horrors and hate crimes so severe they will taint and possibly damn your very soul. You have been warned.<br /><br />\\"My Humps.\\" Appalling in every single way, yet \\"Boom Boom Pow\\" was arguably worse. The next single, one of the biggest hits of all time, \\"I Gotta Feeling\\", is one of the worst songs ever written, yet it's STILL not as bad as the Dirty Dancing inspired \\"The Time (Dirty Bit)\\", which I'm reliably informed James Holmes listened to on repeat before stepping into that cinema. And you think to yourself - well.. this is IT, surely? You can't GET worse than that. Unless you record yourself torturing a donkey and putting a dance beat behind it, this is surely the lowest that mortal man can stoop?<br /><br />Not for Will.I.Am.<br /><br />And so, ladies and gentlemen, we have #Willpower. Note the use of the hashtag, because hey, Twitter is where the action is now, kids, and we all love guys who are hitting forty putting hashtags in front of words for no reason. The last single from this aural groin punch was the truly, deeply dismal \\"Scream and Shout\\" with Britney Spears. Now, it's no secret I actually like Britney Spears a whole lot. She's verging on talentless, granted, but she sure is nice to look at and the guys who pull her strings manage to knock together some enjoyable pop records. Those guys clearly had the day off here, because Scream and Shout is worse than all of those songs I just mentioned. Why? Oh my.. where to begin? The lyrics? My God, what drivel. I mean God DAMN what drivel. I could cut and paste the lyrics but I fear my keyboard and monitor may revolt and self destruct in protest. And then you have Britney's toe-curling \\"British\\" accent and it was a sure fire winner of worst song of the year.<br /><br />Notice that past tense? What could possibly top \\"Scream and Shout\\" for wretchedness? What is now THE worst song of theyear? Keeping that cycle going, it's Will.I.Am's NEW single, the quite simply jaw-dropping #thatPOWER, the collaboration with everyone's favourite super-douche, Justin Bieber. You will not believe this music was recorded and released by professional \\"artists.\\" You will not believe that lyrics such as \\"I take it higher, And high, high and higher, I stay and buy attire, Keep burnin' like that fire\\" are now classed as acceptable for inclusion in a pop record. You won't WANT to believe it, but believe it you must.<br /><br />Because it's REAL, people. It's happening NOW. Will.I.Am is still creating music as you read this, each song more diabolical than the last. Ladies and gentlemen, I am of the firm and unwavering belief that by the year 2015 Will.I.Am will have created a piece of music so inhumanely terrible it will tear a hole in the very fabric of the universe.<br /><br />Therefore there is no other option. Will.I.Am, destroyer of music and potential destroyer of earth, must be eliminated at all costs. We as a species cannot rest until Will.I.Am's head is severed from his still twitching body and fed to a hungry lion.<br /><br />If you SEE Will.I.Am do not hesitate. Do not think. Do not give him a chance to run. He simply must be killed.<br /><br />You could be mankind's last hope. I only hope we're not too late and he's already recording a duet with Susan Boyle.<br /><br />#murderwill.i.amyear?

B007HACDLK|5.0|Another great piece of work by Mr. Vince Flynn. Began with a different approach compared to the other books but in the end great work. I think it may be his best one yet.
B0030ZOYHC|5.0|This exceeded my expectations of what anime is.  I really loved the somewhat retelling of the show but its also a stand alone series.  I can't wait for more.
0061733199|5.0|i really think this is a great book!  easy to read and extremely helpful.  donated it to the library so more people could enjoy it.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|This was an awesome retelling of the series.  In some ways it was better than the original.  The ending left me hungry for more.
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|I'm not going to lie I was a bit nervous when I bought this cd. Paramore hasn't put out music in a while and with all the changes of band members, I was worried they may have lost their mojo. I gotta say though they completely blew me away. It's a little bit of their old school sound mixed with some new styling. All in all it's an awesome cd and worth the purchase!
B00AB7HESI|4.0|The game is a great mobile version of the other scribblenaut games. It doesnt add to the recipe, but it is a faithful time killer. If you like scribblenauts, this is a good version to have, and this is a great version to have if you arent sure you want to spend a lot of money on the more expensive versions.
B0086VWCPG|3.0|Just started using the app.  Liked runtastic, not sure the upgrade was worth it.  But I have only used it once.  Hopefully it will win me over.
B00AFQC4QC|5.0|I was gifted this book by the author in return of an honest review.<br /><br />I was enthralled by this story, \\"The Luck of the Weissensteiners\\" offered so many emotions.<br /><br />While I read this story it felt more like I was having the story read to me, I could hear the pain and suffering that Greta and her family went through in the authors words. How difficult life for them was no matter what they tried to do. Having to change their names, their ethnic background, religion everything just for acceptance and safety/freedom. Having to separate from one another and sacrifice so much just for them to try and find safety. While along the way they found few people that were willing to over look things and help them, but also came across many that would just a soon turn them in and hope that that doing so would help themselves.<br /><br />This story tells the tales of Pre-Holocaust leading up to the end of WWII. Christoph Fischer did an amazing job on telling this story, and did an outstanding job researching so much history. So many times while I read I cried, got angry and even laughed. This is definitely a book I would recommend to anyone who loves a little history.<br /><br />Thank you Christoph Fischer for giving me a little more insight as to what history has to offer.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Again, very well-written but it really can't be read independently of the first book. You need to read The Hunger Games first in order to appreciate the complexity of the story in Catching Fire.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This show is awesome and came with episode guides, a map of Westeros, and special offers for Game of Thrones merchandise. Couldn't ask for more
0544002318|4.0|While, I truly enjoyed the story of Scott's life and running, I found his arrogance annoying and found that it took away from the greatness of his story. Comments like the one referencing a statement made by Tony Krupicka about while he was in high school he considered Scott his idol. Or the one about how the entire country of Greece considered him a hero. Statements like these really add nothing to the story and actually made me consider putting the book down a few times. I am not arguing against his greatness, that's evident in what he has accomplished. But that's really my point. The book would have been better without such statements BECAUSE his greatest is evident in what he has accomplished. Humility is so much more respectable. However, that is my only criticism of the book. Amazing story and great recipes.
B001NA6096|5.0|This movie creates a desire to find out what happens next. Great movie with a great sequel as well. Thumbs up!
B001NZEHMS|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite records. 28 years after its release and I still love every track. To me it's pure genius.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a really cool game. I love it. It helps when I'm sad. So yeah um idk what else to say.
B00B2TTVNU|4.0|Wonderful recordings of the Concertos.  Ms Lisitsa is delightful as usual and the interpretations are sound.  A major accomplishment for Lisitsa.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|Wonderful story about what you can achieve if you really want something bad enough and are courageous enough to go after it.
0307887960|5.0|The book was recommended to me. The Dukan Diet is the best program I have ever done and it's so easy.
B00001ODGR|5.0|Ah, I recently found this DVD in the corner of a shelf and popped it in.  What memories...<br /><br />As a native Chicagoan (and a well seasoned one at that), I remember seeing Styx when they were a garage band, when they played High School gymnasiums.  While popular, with local airplay of \\"Lady\\" (and Tommy Shaw joining the group after Equinox), the group took off to super-stardom, until their live album Caught In The Act.  After that they sorta just faded away.  There was a short revival six years later, with Edge of the Century, but without Tommy Shaw.<br /><br />The grand reunion would take place in 1997, 13 years after Caught In The Act, when the entire group (sans John Panozzo, who died the year before) reunited and started the Return to Paradise tour.<br /><br />Their last show, held on the Autumnal Equinox (Saturday, September 21 1996 @7:30pm) was recorded, and is what's on this DVD.  I was there.  It was a great show.  Cost me $24.75, plus a $2.25 parking fee at the Rosemont Horizon near Chicago.  (I have the ticket stub in the DVD slipcase.)<br /><br />As far as I could tell at the time, the only thing missing from this video was a short segment reintroducing the group, where they played a few bars from a Lynyrd Synyrd tune, which is probably why it's not on the DVD... :-)<br /><br />Anyway, this is the last show you can see today that still has De Young as part of the group, who is, as far as I'm concerned, the heart and soul of Styx.<br /><br />If you're a Styx fan, or would like to see what I think is their definitive concert on DVD, this is it.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I loved this book.  Having just lost my mother it was the perfect book  for me. I felt all of her blisters and her hunger.  I felt like I had walked with her. I was afraid for her but so happy that she made it.  I am so proud of Cheryl strayed.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|Truly one of the worst movies that I have seen in a very long time. Wonderful cast but horrible movie. Not at all close to what 40 is like. Shows a very poor use of the F word. I don't mind the foul language if it is used in a relevant manner. The movie drags at a snail's pace and is very predictable. I hate that this awesome cast is even remotely associated with &#34;This is 40.&#34; The only thing saving this movie from 1 star is Paul Rudd.
B000002O1Q|3.0|I loved all of the music when I bought this on vinyl many years ago. However, although the cd quality was great, some of the songs are just monotonous and drag on way too long! The best song is still Dan Hartman's classic...I Can Dream About You!
B0054VVRBQ|3.0|I have all Transcend cards and find them very reliable.  I have a SanDisk CF Expresscard reader and have never had problems with it.  My 5D Mark III takes both size cards, so I thought this flush mount would be nice to just leave it in the computer.  I love this device.  It fits flush inside my 17\\" MBP.  It reads cards well and has given me no trouble in this regard.  But more than 50% of the times when I insert my 32 GB Transcend SDHC card, my system locks up requiring a hard reset.  I try to remove the reader from the computer before inserting the card, which has worked, but the last time I did it removing the reader locked up the system.  I have inserted and removed my Transcend 16GB SD cards a few times and not encountered the problem, so I'm not sure if it has to do with high capacity cards or what.  I may have to look for a new solution as Transcend's website states their drivers are for 10.7.4 and earlier can't remember if it even said 10.7.4 was ok.<br /><br />If you have a Mac, I would look for another reader with updated drivers.
B0026NWBY2|5.0|This cd is high quality and has all the songs you love, some songs you loved already but never knew George sang, and others that you will love for the first time...and then forever! Superb cd!
B0064MT1QW|5.0|It's a grand love story! Told with flair with excellent character development. Well worth the the price of admission. I recommend this.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Before watching, I read many negative reviews and box office standing and was turned off.  But after watching, my feelings has changed.  It is a powerful work on so many layers. It is emotionally charged from beginning to end. In the first 10 minutes I question how could this movie interest me for 172 minutes.  Could Atlas tells stories of people who's lives meant something. It is one of those tales that you would gladly escape your normal life of responsibilities to take part in no matter what the outcome is. The acting was incredible, I lived through the stories of each character. Its worth watching for yourself.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|The new 4.03.1 isn't saving downloaded apps to device.  Every time I turn the tablet on, I have to download again a previously loaded book.  Rick Steves \\"France\\" takes minutes to download each time.  That's no good.<br /><br />I'm experiencing this on two different types of Sony Android tablets.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love it!  The hardest part is having to wait until January 2014 for Season 4.  Great character development, beautiful scenery, learning about a period in time that is fasinating.
B007XGJK4G|5.0|Definitely a 5 Star documentary of the life, legecy and history of The Legendary Reggae Music Icon, Bob Marley. A must see if you're a Fan of Reggae Music... Thanks and much respect to the Marley Family.  GeoSan
B0061QD88S|5.0|I am building a DVD library of Disney classic movies for my granddaughter. This was always one one of my favorites and now she's enjoying it too,
B0006AAS5G|5.0|I bought this for my and I can say I'm totally satisfied with it!! I'll keep an eye on you guys
B000YXMMAO|5.0|Radiohead has done again with &#34;In Rainbows&#34;. This is definitely a masterfully composed and written album, and the sounds produced from this record are very pleasing to the ear. The meaning embedded in the songs is mysterious, and always leaves me much to interpret. Through and through, this is an amazing album, and current fan or curious listener should definitely give this album a spin.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a great game to keep you occupied when waiting for your dinner at a fast food store or eveyone else is asleep and nothing is happening.  Great graphics and keeps your mind active.
B000095K7A|5.0|The Postal Service have really made their mark on musical history with this album. Ben Gibbard is a masterful artist, and he has composed a true masterpiece with &#34;Give Up&#34;. I definitely recommend it to any fans of his other work, or someone looking for some new, deep music to listen to. Definitely worth a spin.
1427210241|5.0|Robert Jordan has out did himself in the book. I can't wait to move on to the next book in the sires.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|It's an amazing ending to the most perfect saga. Couldn't have expected more by far the absolute best movie. Huge fan!!
B004UPANGM|5.0|For a good &#34;scary&#34; laugh this is one of the best. The Evil Dead, The Evil Dead 2, and the Army of Darkness is a trilogy of classic &#34;scary humor&#34;
0736092269|5.0|used to work out 25+years ago took a break a long break had 3 children and 7 grandchildren now if i can back in shape this book can do it
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|As with numerous movies, it helps to have read the book.  We did find the accent of the Pi to get in the way sometimes to understanding what he was saying.  The animation was tremendous.
B00122K1SQ|5.0|I can't get enough of vintage Prince. I wish can come on tour in Chattanooga. He will definitely sell out.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|have only had one day but did some shoots with d300, d2h and my d5000 with great results. great for the pocket when you need it just pop it on. take a lot of pictures of the Grand children and needed some thing better than the pop-up flash. highly recomend
B000025XKM|5.0|This is less of a review and more of a sonic comparison to the two \\"Pink Moon\\" (lps) I own. I own this latest remastering and the Simply Vinyl reissue. The new one is more transparent, guitar strums have nice tone and resonance, transient response is greater. Overall, I'm glad I decided to purchase this latest remastering from a great artist.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|I have used this on every round that I have played every since I bought it! Very accurate yardage and easy to use.
B00BBI9WD6|3.0|havent finished it yet but so far it kind of drags.<br />he takes much too long to get to an exciting part
1451695195|1.0|If you believe in heaven save your money and buy another book. The author seems detached and too wordy at times. Either you believe or not and a Dr. Isn't going to alter my mind.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|all of his music is outstanding, each recording gets better then the last one. What would we do without Willie
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this  app! I don't have the space to build puzzles, so this app is amazing. So many puzzles!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is my favorite game, so when I find a program that is good, I put it on all of my devices.<br />This is one I have on all of my devices.
