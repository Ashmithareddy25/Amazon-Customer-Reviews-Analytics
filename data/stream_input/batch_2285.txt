B005C8ENI0|3.0|At first you say to yourself, &#34;what exactly is this movie about&#34; because too much is happening.  At the end, it feels compelled to tie all of those little pieces together.  However the ending just seemed weak.  For the middle portions, it gets very smart; but it fails to conclude with the same brains and finesse. With such a great cast, you have to blame sub-par directing.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Could not stop watching it.....even when it had me scared.<br />It is a must see without a doubt.  Enjoy it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I loved this book.  I learned so much about Pat's problems with that kind of disability.  The characters in this book were wonderful but most of all Patrick and Louisa, what a story.  I will be reading more of Jojo Moyes books.
B00BF11STU|2.0|Rent don't waste your money and buy it.  I can't believe this was nominated for best picture.  The low budget docu-drama was better believe it or not.  Faster paced and more detail on finding UBL and preparing for the mission. very disapointed.
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|Hard to navigate.also not able to change screen orientation to make readable.  Looking for alternative pdf reader, open to suggestions.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|First, I am NOT a fan of soap operas. Second,  I always found BBC/PBS shows rather rather bland.  Third, period pieces are not my favorites. Downton Abbey has trashed all three of those misconceptions.<br />I tried an episode from season 2 under duress from my wife who heard of it from Jessica D. After that one episode, I was hooked.<br />From the storyline through the ensemble, even the theme. Everything was exceptional. I was amazed at how stark the separation lines between the house and staff were. And yet the affection of the two for each other was obvious. The interaction between the two classes AND amongst themselves is the basis of the series and it succeeds immensely. Humor, sarcasm, intrigue, love, grief and many more emotions are expressed with realism and honesty.<br />I wish I could express how captivating this show is without sounding like a studio flak but suffice it to say there is NOTHING about this show that I don't like.<br />Zo!  Maybe this review is not a good candidate to base your decision on, butt &#34;Try it.&#34; &#34;You'll like it!&#34;
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This was such an amazing book . It kept me reading all the time. I absolutely adore renesme . I wish there were more books to read.  You could read this 24/7 because it's so suspenseful. Thanks so much stephanie Meyer for writing this extraordinary novels!!!!
B0090SI460|5.0|Awesome movie @ great price.<br />I would highly recommend this particular item to anyone.<br />Blu Ray 3d, Blu Ray, DVD, & Digital Copy..
B00908DDZM|5.0|My new favorite CD. This CD features an extremely talented bunch of artists. I am totally addicted to each song. Infreakincredible.
B00AUO7S42|5.0|Taking her classes has been very helpful.  I enjoy the atmosphere and the step by step instructions.  I'm sure her book will be just as good.  Thanks.
B000YJ85BI|4.0|Of course &#34;old man's war&#34; is still at the top in my rating, but probably just because it was new, though I can't give less than 4 stars to both this one and the ghost brigades, they're SO entertaining, I love his mix of irony and action.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is the best out of the series.  The kindle addition is cheaper too. I recommend this to every Jeff Kinney fan.
B000FC130E|5.0|Another great read from gaiman! Great pace and style! He never disappoints. If you enjoyed the graveyard book or American gods, you will like this!
1118109791|1.0|Company stated gently used. Every page is scribbled on. I will never purchase a book from that company again. I should have purchased a new book.
B0053O89KG|5.0|In a time when so many TV programs are either bad &#34;reality shows&#34;, or terminally lacking in intelligence, or totally lacking in humor, l love this show, and love having it available on DVD.
1452110581|5.0|This is a delightful, funny book and I have sent my friends a copy, because I couldn't help it. I knew they would love it just as i did.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Let's just say, a book that you can't put down because you want to know what happens in the next chapter!!!!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|This case is an insane value. It is Large. Holds Nikon D7000 and D300 bodies, plus 4 lenses, chargers, etc. Great way to keep a system organized.<br />Now, I wish Amazon would offer a slightly scaled down version for Olympus and Panasonic Micro 4/3 and other mirror-less, compact systems (Sony NEX, Nikon 1, Fuji X, etc).<br />These popular compact systems swim in this large bag.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|This was a surprisingly good film for a part-three. I enjoyed the movie, though I don't remember seeing it advertised at the theater.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I cant wait for Despicable Me 2, coming out this summer!! Gonna be a real HOOT and definately added to my collection!!
B00BF11UM0|2.0|Too much time with in the dark scenes with no detail. The viewer was left to figure out on their own what was going on.
B00499S9YC|5.0|What's not to love about Sade??  This is her best work.  It's one of those albums you can have on repeat all the time.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|I missed seeing this at the theater, so I was pleased to be able get it so quickly on DVD.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|The whole collection of Harry Potter is a must have for all you fans out there! I never read the books, but surprisingly, my kids have!! Wish I had that kind of time.<br />Seller was very professional, and fast service. Disk was in condition as promised!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Again, we did not purchase it-we are watching it on Roku.<br />I do sometimes have a hard time finding the series.  There is probably  an easier way to find it but I do not know how
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Ok I just go this game and its the best!!!! I love this game so much! It's addicting  and fun! :) everybody should  get this app! You will enjoy it! I thought it was a boring in the pictures but when I started playing &quot;Jetpack Joyride&quot; it was not even close  to boring!!!!!! If you get this app it will not be  a mistake but if you don't well okay if you say so :P
B005LAIISA|4.0|Perhaps this was not quite as good as the other installments, but it was still a good movie. The characters are classic.
B004G600A4|5.0|This is one of the BEST movies Disney came out with. You collection wont be complete without Tangled!!!  Even when the movies isnt playing, I find myself singing the songs, and my Grandaughter starts singing with me..and shes only 2!! what a joy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is the best get it for ur kid or even you ... it has the best updates too.So I recamend you should get minecraft. :-)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I like the cast. I appreciate that they can tell a story without profanity. I visited Biltmore Castle in NC this past fall and that looked a lot like the home they live in, and how grand it is. Love the series.
B00BEZTMQ8|1.0|Until Flixster/Ultraviolet get their act together, recommend everyone AVOID this type purchase.  They can't seem to properly link the two accounts they forced me to create, and once they finally accomplished that, they inform me that I've used my redemption code too many times.  This is a PURE RIP OFF.  Next contact: Better Business Bureau.  Amazon: I expect better.  If it were possible to give \\"ZERO Stars\\" that's what I'd give this rip off
B000H5U832|5.0|How would you not LOVE Cars??  Awesome movie, and in condition as expected, supreme and fast delivery! If you dont have this movie in your collection, you need it.
B004HD61KE|5.0|Really held my interest.  This is the first James Rollins book that I read.  Am interested to visit the sights that they used in the book!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so awsome i would recomed it if your looking for somthing fun to do.... great game yes it is
B00BESNKB8|2.0|I was so frustrated by the mediocre acting and the excessive special effects, I almost stopped watching this gaudy, fantasy film.
B009KEN87O|5.0|this game is seriously the best. I got it as the free app of the day. but it is easily worth 2.50 or whatever it costs. I love the one hand style game play. and it's super addictive.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|I wanted speed and with this processor I got needed speed. It comes with cooling fan and all and is ready to go. I'm not the techie so all I can tell you is it is fast and was a snap to install. If I want to overclock I can do so with little effort.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this novel. Would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good story a bit different compared to some .I'm over 60, so couldn't say what specific age group would enjoy this. As usual it turned out the way I thought it would, thank goodness!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is great.  Our family all have it on our devices and play it all the time.  Very addictive.
B009KEN87O|2.0|the top and bottom of the display are cut off on my device with 3:4 screen resolution, so not all enemies are visible
B00821OX98|3.0|What &#34;The Librarian&#34; (another Noah Wyle vehicle) was to action/adventure, this is to alien invasion sci-fi. If you go in without huge expectations, you might enjoy it; but, personally, I just couldn't get into it. It just never managed to pull of the sense of tension that it was obviously shooting for.<br /><br />It works as background noise, but I found it pretty easy to put down the remote.
B008B9JTLI|5.0|This was a very good show. A little gross when he found out something about his life. I won't tell because I don't want to give the show away. But be prepared. Loved the ending too.
1452110581|5.0|OMG  this is hysterical, I couldn't put it down...  And it arrived the day one of my cats peed in their toy box.
B004H6G0TI|1.0|It's not playable due to non-functional touch input on my tablet with CyanogenMod Android 4.0 (as people already pointed out on some other devices: transformer, some kindle fires). The touchscreen coordinates are completely wrong - tapping on the bottom of the screen acts on the top-most menu item, and tapping on anywhere else does nothing in my case.
B004H6G0TI|1.0|I can't get the game to start.  I have to tap nowhere near the button to get it to activate and I'd have to press off the screen to get the start button to work.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|After reading quite a few reviews, good & bad, I decided to read the book. Yes, there's a lot of sex, and although it's pretty soft, it's still definitely a book for &#34;grown-ups&#34;. A lot of the negative reviews described the writing style as something they'd expect from a 16 year old and the repetitiveness (female character biting her lip, for example). Even though the female character is graduating college, she still a virgin and has had no serious relationships - the writing style fits. As for the lip-biting, it's one of the catalysts/triggers in the story. What I take away from this story is that the author successfully got inside the head of a young, naive, unworldly person going through an intense emotional & psychological upheaval, & how she learns & evolves as she tries to get through it. If you're looking for salacious material, this might not be strong enough. If you like psychology and strong female characters, give this a try!!
B000SFD21Q|3.0|There are some good new ideas here about the benefits of exercise for mood and anxiety, and evidence for the plasticity of the brain in response to physical activity.  But there is far too much repetition, and endless and and disorderly presentation of brain chemistry and physiology.  I got the main ideas skimming the first few chapters and let it go at that.  I has helped spur me to exercise more, and I do feel better!  well worth it for that alone.
B008133MDK|5.0|Sherlock is smart, edgy, and engaging. A long time Arthur Conan Doyle fan, I've thought I had seen it all when it comes to Sherlock remakes and re-toolings. Not.At. All. Benedict Cumberbatch is truly wonderful. I never want to see another Sherlock ever again unless he's part of it.
0316069884|5.0|This book does a great job presenting varying views on animal agriculture.  Everybody should have to read this before they eat another animal or animal product.
0307454568|5.0|I ordered a used book and this book is practically new looking.  It arrived early and was packaged appropriately.  It is the third book in a series which begins with The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  Very interesting story.  I would recommend all three books in this series - the second book is The Girl who Played with Fire.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|grafics are very very cute so buy it right now or later you should buy my little pony just look at apple bloom........right now
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season 2 of Downton Abbey is coming along fine. We continue from Season 1 with a good story line, good actors and excellent production values. Looking forward to watching the rest  of this series and then on to Season 3 and I now understand they  are making a 4th season.. Thank you Amazon for bringing this along to us. R. Kirby
B008Q09K2U|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book, I will definitely be picking up more of Mr De Mille's books from now on.
0307949508|5.0|Even though I ordered a used book, this book is practically like new.  The pages are not torn or even dog-eared and there is not writing or highlighting in the book.  It arrived early and is a very enjoyable read.  It is the second book in a series, following The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun! really fffffuuuunnnn!!! you can get a unicorn for 325gems and they are easy to get no money unless your lazy.....
1400067820|4.0|Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder is a very important book. This is one of those seminal philosophy books that can (hopefully) change the way people as a whole think. The book covers the concept of antifragility, things that improve in some way when subjected to stress. Although the concept has been around forever, the word itself is new. Taleb is highly distrustful of complex systems and models, believing that the only thing that can reliably be predicted is that something will go wrong somewhere. He noted the fragility of the banking system, and has made a fortune multiple times by betting that the stock market will crash.<br /><br />Some examples in the book include the fact that if one airplane crashes, lessons will be learned and all future airplanes will be less likely to crash. However if one bank crashes, the other banks become more likely to crash. Humans introduce fragility by trying to constrain systems. If we put out small forest fires, we are setting ourselves up for a large fire.<br /><br />The book covers a large number of topics including ethics (bankers should have to pay back past bonuses if the firm later crashes), government, medicine (where much harm is introduced with good intentions) and general philosophy.<br /><br />Reasons for four stars instead of five: The author is condescending throughout, and the book could have been shortened a good 50 pages if he wasn't always trying to convince everyone how smart he is. Also, convexity and concavity were central points when they are really the same thing (ie, convex to harm = concave to benefit)<br /><br />Overall this is an important book that should give much useful advice to individuals, companies, and governments.<br /><br />Review by Bill Pottle, Author of Alizel's Song
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is definately worth getting. I download all of my videos with it. You can also use it to download music videos as mp3's.
B00BJZHSOQ|5.0|I love this song, and I like Michael Buble music, and this is a great addition to my music playlist.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille scores again.  No one better.  Sarcasm, intrique, etc... Good stuff as always.  Wish he would publish more.  Always makes me laugh.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|This edition is one worth buying for keepsakes. If you were around in the last part of the 20th century you will know what an impact the Bee Gees had on music, so this is one where I can sit back and remember the times past and the great music of that era.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I have seen and heard Le Miserables many time over the years, but this time I heard the lyrics as part of the story. The acting was fantastic and the quality of the singers was for me beyond description.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel played a character that made me so angry as I was watching the movie but of course he redeemed himself in the end.  Hope I didn't spoil it for you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I know, it is a little pricey, but it is really worth the money, do not listen to the 1 star reviews, they do not know what they are talking about. it also is very addicting. take my advice, and get this game right now. if you never played this game, you haven't lived a full life yet.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|This video presents another interpretation of Sherlock, a bit less Brit, and a bit more Hollywood. The new Holmes here  is a tough guy, and Watson a bigger part of the show than previous interpretations.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Fun game and very addictive. It does take a long time to restore energy though. However I really like the game and look forward to updates
B007MB5OCE|1.0|I tried to read this through, but the story was boring with a bunch of silly characters. I did not see the point of the story.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen about Lincoln!!<br />As a history teacher, I'd love to show this one in the classroom!
B008TMA1LY|5.0|I Got this for my grand daughter back in September, and I have to admit that WE LOVE IT.  Only problem is that I MYSELF am the one addicted....setting alarms for my daily rewards, LOL<br />I have taken over the Player 1 &amp; has to make her a new player cause my case is ROCKIN LOL.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Alright minecraft is jolly happy Christmas but I'm in football and oh ny word is it fun! So u mean oh my word that's cOOL is that what you're thinking right no w
B007HC3LHS|5.0|Well written, much intrigue, and the story made me sit on the edge of the seat with suspenseful anxiety. I've been double checking the door locks!
B002RI9YCI|4.0|Enjoyed reading this slightly tongue in check musing through an uncommon reader. A great title fitting the story perfectly.  You wonder if her Majesty could, would, should be thinking what is happening as she uncovers a different world through reading.  Very much worth a journey through these pages.
B004I1AGTM|5.0|This is an action packed, comical, entertaining movie to watch, worth while to buy even for a woman, fun to watch!
B0002A2WDQ|5.0|My husband & I love this movie.<br /><br />The story is awesome, the action, the music ... for an older movie, I dug it.<br /><br />If you like rock n roll, you get a kick out of this movie.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book was a lovely surprise. I felt like I knew each character, and found their personalities endearing. I felt Jamie's pain, and his life story brought me to tears. Rose made me laugh out loud.  This was a book I looked forward to reading, and was sorry to have it end.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is so great I could play it every day.temple run is a good game so check it out and download to play and u would love it.
B003INBOEC|5.0|I'm a woman and I enjoyed this movie, entertaining, comical, fun to watch, a must buy for this type of movie
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Really enjoyed this book!!<br />Well written and totally enjoyable and exciting characters!<br />Can't wait fir the next one!!!!!  Love love!!!
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|When I listened to &#34;Somewhere&#34; for the first time in February 2013, I was catapulted back to 1969, when I was 13, listening to Jimi playing &#34;Purple Haze&#34;. What an incredible thing, for these tracks to be made public. New Hendrix in 2013, who would have ever seen this one coming???????<br /><br />This is an incredible album.
B004CURZFC|2.0|My daughter got an Eglantine owl beanie baby for her birthday and got interested in Legend of the Guardians.  She and her sister and I were all disappointed in this movie.  The primary reason we didn't like the movie is because we couldn't follow it.  The Australian accents were too strong for even an adult to comprehend without straining.  On top of that, two of the main characters, Soren and his brother, were hard to distinguish from each other.  We stopped watching the movie 45 minutes before it was over and the birthday day girl was very disappointed.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Could not put it down. Cannot wait until book 3 comes out in June! I'm hooked! Excellent series. Sylvia Day is great!
B00881VLCE|4.0|Love the puzzles, but it keeps shutting down on me and when it does I lose what I was working on.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|A whole new direction for the FBI recluse Pendergast. The next book should be very interesting to see what direction Preston & Child take in the series. This series, if you get into it from the beginning is a go to for me. Not many series can sustain an ongoing history. This series does...so far. I recommend, if you're new to the series, by starting with the Cabinet of Curiosities. The first 3 books are in what us readers consider the start of the series and Preston & Child have a comment on that), do not need to be read in order but will familiarize a new reader with the characters. Elements of medical sci-fi make this series very different from others. If you've seen the movie Relic (on TV every so often), this was the first book they wrote followed by Reliquary but are not crucial to the series. For this series start with the Cabinet of Curiosities. Exremely enjoyable.
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|Fabulous all venues in one DVD! Various of Music themes, travel scenes beautiful across the world along with unbelievable artistry
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I don't know where I have been but I just discovered Downton Abby a few months ago now I am hooked. It's a great demonstration of Victorian England and the values they upheld. The story has great characters and story. Just enough drama and humor. If you haven't seen it check it out. Downloading to amazon iPad player was a little cumbersome but it worked out in the end.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|Disc froze about 1/3 into the movie. Never played past that point. My kid was really looking forward to this, as she had read all the books. The window for returns is short. Amazon sent me a piece of garbage.
B00BF11STU|1.0|over dramatized crap. i want a refund because i cant even watch a movie that is this bad even my review is better than this garbage.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had watched the movie Serenity, but I didn't know there was a Firefly series.  I was over joyed to find out that Amazon had the whole series  It was even better than I had hoped.  I recommended it to a friend's son.
B009K86D86|5.0|This movie is a must see.  You wonder why people get foodborne illness?  Here's your answer.  This movie will make you think before you consume meat again.
B00A0NOF7G|1.0|Weak plot, poor character development, atrocious grammar (didn't this woman ever hear of editors?)...this was a total waste of time.  I got it free, and even at that it was overpriced!<br /><br />If you want to read an enjoyable cozy, check out Jenn McKinlay's Cupcake Bakery Mysteries and don't waste your time on this garbage.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is my favorite app ever! it's so fun and very addicting. get this app now and you will never regret it!
B009RH973I|4.0|Perfect and great price point.  Love the color (pink).  Easy to find in my bag.  Not heavy or thick but a nice light protection.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I absolutely love Pinterest! The only thing I think they need to improve is to be able to search within a category.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|I'm a big fan of the Moody Blues, I just love his voice, beautiful and mellow songs, till the end than it changes to techno.
B00632HWOG|5.0|My son gave it to me for my birthday. I just love it I just to get a book telling me how to use all its fieatures
B007JCP8FE|5.0|Another great album from Shinedown.  These guys were fantastic live and this is just another CD to add to everyone's Rock collection.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|Ever since I found this app for my tablet I haven't done anythibg else but get more apps. I may be found in 100 yrs with my tablet in my cold dead hands
B007HC3LHS|5.0|There are a few things that really made me love this book. One was the fact that it took place in Europe, the other was about the main characters issue with OCD. I found it very interesting how it was woven into the story and how she had to cope with that. I'm looking forward to reading more from this author.
B002QNTNL6|3.0|Another feel good movie. Just pray that peoples hearts will be softhened and families will start being families again. Was worth watching.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Muse has a unique sound that really just sucks you in.  I like to call it fantasy rock, but it could fit many other genre's.  The important point is that this CD is fantastic.
B007K3JCAE|4.0|Even though I didn't like this one as much as the first, it still had its good moments.<br /><br />I enjoyed the continued interaction between Holmes and Watson.  I enjoyed that Holmes was truly challenged by an intelligent foe.  The bad guy came up a bit short for me in the end, but all in all it was a very enjoyable mystery.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|this game was better than any of the mahjong games I've played & installed on my phone or computer even better than the ones I bought
B006C1DH92|3.0|grand daughter likes the game.  she is very good at slicing the fruits.  she is five years old and enjoys games
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This is brilliantly acted, staged, true to the books. Game of Thrones s a powerful story told by a great cast. It brings the books to life and compels us to stick with it. I indulge in marathons and my 15-year-old nephew does the same. He borrows them from me as soon as I get them and shares them with his parents. That amounts to three generations of enjoyment. It is a story that spans generations. Wonderful!
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This book was super super good and I could not set it down at all.<br />Why did the series have to end here I wish that I could keep going.<br />You have not ever failed to impress me James Dashner!!!!!!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|In my opinion the soundtrack is calming and the game is awesome and i love the way the game makes you think and keeps you always in a thinking state awesome and the display is just awesome great game
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is amazing just like the movie. Both are a must see/read. A beautiful story that had me laughing and crying. By far one of the best books I have read
B001UTW7QU|4.0|From a life long sci-fi fan:This is astonishingly well written, directed and acted. It's a prime example of just how far the TV. genre has come. Another example of why people are staying home instead of feeding the greed of Hollywood.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is so cool it actually feels like you have to take care of a horse love.!!!!!!!!!!! this games<br />I love horses
B008220DGE|5.0|Based loosely on the life of a famous 20th century writer and philosopher, this film delivers the goods, artistically presented.<br />Frankly, I was expecting a smear-job of one of my most-respected heroes; and was delighted that I was wrong.<br />Screenwriter and film director, Paul Thomas Anderson, neither demonized nor deified the Master character - rather he humanized him.  True, Anderson took creative license in portraying actual events, names and techniques to spice-up the story and his presentation; but I haven't seen a biographical film yet that didn't do the same thing (e.g. the lives of Hemingway, Hammett, Christ, Buddha, Einstein, etc.).  The story takes place in the late 1940's and early 1950s and is loosely based on true events which bear an amazing similarity to those of writer L. Ron Hubbard and his break-out success Dianetics, which to this day sells millions of copies annually and consistently wins publishing awards and accolades from other religious leaders, scholars and famous celebrities.  Controversial?...perhaps.  Intriguing?...Absolutely!  It deserved its Academy Award nominations.  A good one.
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|By this time  clarity of the plot is getting lost in the convolutions of the scripts. The acting remains very good.
B00BF11UM0|4.0|It was very interesting but I think they jazzed it up a little to much trying to prove that the girls could out MF the guys. Also Amazon needs to find a way for closed captions for the hearing impaired.
B005ETA5K2|2.0|Needed a device with a little more signal to reach my AP.<br /><br />Worked great for XP-32 and Win7-32 .<br /><br />Wouldn't work for Win7-64 (which is what I purchased it for).  Would install, and Device Manger reported<br />\\"this device is working properly\\".  It could never detect any AP's in the area or receive any signals.<br />Windows could not resolve the problem.  Tried CD drivers, and drivers from the vendor's website.<br /><br />Have two other usb adapters, and they are working fine.  Instead, I purchased a better antenna for<br />these devices to reach my AP with the Win7-64 system.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|My librarian recommend this book to me and I didn't think I would like it but man did I!! This is a story about a girl who gets this mysterious notes saying \\"I am coming to save your friends life, and my own. This is a story about friendship and how we need not look at the world with our veil closed.(you will get it when you read the book.) I would recommend this book to everyone.
B006SMLAMQ|4.0|I like this ap it has great graphics and is easy to use. I like how you can se the weather to the hour.
B00BOL126U|5.0|I grew up with the old \\"The Celts\\" series on PBS many years ago.  It was my first introduction to Enya's music and loved the series.  I also tuned in to a pseudo \\"news\\" show that reported on ancient history as news.  Meaning that they sent \\"reporters\\" in period clothing to battle scenes and historical events.  I forget the name of that show but it also ran on PBS for one or two seasons.  So here we are with \\"The Vikings\\" and seeing elements of those shows is so refreshing.  Having unfamiliar actors is such a treat since I often look for German and Scandinavian films just for that reason.  Mr. Byrne is just fine as the bad guy, but he does not get in the way of a great series.  Anyway, this is a show with great acting and a great story.  If it looks like we're skimming over the bad side of the Vikings (the slaves and the raiding),  I don't really care.  If these guys had gotten to the New World instead of Columbu several hundred years later, we would be better off now. History was written by the men with the most swords and the time to do it better was then.  So this show gives us \\"what-if\\" speculators are lot to look forward to. (BTW I was born in the Caribbean thanks to that guy that sailed in 1492.)
B00942X8PY|5.0|A good puzzle game with the proper balance of elements to challenge but not overwhelm. While the ability to beat the  clock is fun solving the puzzle is what lets you move on so you don't get stuck and become bored without being to easy.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book is interesting to read and gives a great deal of insight into Jobs view of running a business. To sum it up, pay attention to detail.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|Act 1 Scene 1 begins with silence and within seconds the sound trumpets loudly with the force of Beethoven's 5th symphony. We see a French Warship leaning to one side and at least half a dozen ropes running from it when the scene cuts to prisoners righting the ship and pulling it into dry dock.<br /><br />The singing begins and surprisingly, Hugh Jackman (As Jean ValJean) does a decent job with his vocals and can actually carry a tune, \\"Look Down, Look Down\\" and a cut to Javert standing on the side of the docking bay starring down at the convicts pulling the boat into the bay.<br /><br />Within Minutes, Javert is up and man, I have to say I am starting to question the casting of Russell Crowe in this part. I cannot tell you what Javert was singing because Crowe's voice was horrible at best and easily the worst in the movie, so bad in fact that I wanted to mute the movie (but, I resisted).<br /><br />The scene finishes with ValJean getting parole for the rest of his life. He served 20 years, 5 of which was for stealing a Loaf of Bread, 15 were for running from the law.<br /><br />Scene 2 is ValJean realizing his past is following him but, he gets taken in by the church, given food, and a bed. He repays them by stealing most of their Silver and is rounded up by the police and returned to the Church where, the priest corroborates ValJean's claim that the Silver was given to him. Later in the scene the priest tells him that his soul was purchased for God by that silver and he is now a changed man. ValJean struggles with the idea that somebody holds that much value in him and uses the Silver goods to start a new life.<br /><br />Without going much further into the story, a whole series of connected events lead up to ValJean taking on a new identity, violating parole, being exposed and adopting a child with whom he takes on the run with him. The whole time is set on a burgeoning Revolution and his whole life is spent running from Javert (maybe if he stopped singing ValJean would have stopped running) and raising his adopted Daughter.<br /><br />The highlight of the movie comes with Fantine's solo (Anne Hathaway) and is really one of the most powerful performances I've ever seen. I honestly believe that Anne Hathaway was feeling very deeply when doing that take as there was a point when she seemed truly distressed and she is easily what put the movie over the top.<br /><br />The lowlight was clearly with the casting and there's no way, I would have even considered casting Sacha Baron Cohen in any role of this nature and yet they did! There was one scene where the Inn keeper was peeing into the wine bottles of his patrons, no joke and it really seemed awkward. Also, as soon as Crowe started singing I would have found a replacement in a hurry!<br /><br />The biggest surprise in the movie, Samantha Banks as Eponine. She has a fantastic voice and really shouldn't have been playing second fiddle to Amanda Seyfried (Cosette) as far as continuity goes.<br /><br />Did I like the movie? Yeah, it was a very good and solid movie but, the lack of french accents in France, some poor casting choices, and set design that seemed to peak early on left you with an incredible begining and an average ending.<br /><br />Is it worth watching? Yes it is but, I preordered the movie and now I know why it was only $14 as it was good but, failed to live up to the hype so, rent it first and if you like it that much, then buy it.<br /><br />It is really a 3.5 star movie but, I'm giving it the benefit of a 4.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Denzel delivers the most amazing performance!  He is self destructive, intense and amazing.  The whole story line up until the end was dark.  Some other great actors contribute in such perfect roles.  It's a must see!!  One nude scene in the beginning they could have done without.  But outstanding for sure!  See it!
B00008FCXI|5.0|Skynyrd has always been a great band and its roots in country rock are legendary.<br />When in doubt go to what you know best--Skynard.<br />Fast delivery--great packing---5 stars as always A+++++
B00992CF6W|4.0|I really love this game. I play it all the time but why can't people with  kindles play with Apple device users. My brother has and ipad and I can join his game but he can't join mine.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|So many features, brushes, pencils, markers, airbrushes, layers, and other options are included in this app.  I cannot believe how well this fits the tablet market and how much they're giving you for $5!<br /><br />My favorite tool is the Mirror Tool that lets you draw in one spot and it is mirrored on the other side.  I cannot tell you how handy this is for drawing repetitive items or balancing out facial features but, I wish it let you have more control over the tool as it only works in Landscape and only on the exact same plane that you're drawing on.<br /><br />I highly recommend this tool as this can easily do for artists what Photoshop touch failed to do for Photographers.
B00068ULLY|2.0|The item was described as like new, but I disagree. The case was damaged in several places. Scratches, dents, rips. It was unacceptable
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|It seems that Kate Morton gets better with each new book ! Unexpected twists in the story makes you want to read on and on. I thoroughly enjoyed the Secret Keeper and would certainly recommend it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|The fan  is alright but the random dealing it make you lose more than win. But overall it is alright to play on off time.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Amazon makes their Fire from Android but, refuses to give customers using Android Tablets the X-Ray feature...  If you look at the iOS App, they delivered the X-Ray feature for the iPad so, making Android users feel like second class citizens will have many of us running to Google or Barnes and Noble for our E-Books and honestly, both of those are better reading Apps.
B00563M11M|4.0|Every Pratchett book is good. And the Watch is always funny. Every book gets better and deaper. A nice way to read about the world without all the pesky hardness of the real world.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Fun to play while watching tv and the rest of this is a great deal with a new one that is fun to play
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Rick Riordan did not disappoint with this new installment in the heroes of Olympus series. It was funny and entertaining and i couldn't want the next book to come sooner than i do now.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This is a whole lot of mindless fun that can be played with a single finger!  Unlike many of the other mindless games, this one actually has plenty of goals and missions for you to achieve and it will keep you playing for a long time!
1573301051|5.0|Great product.<br />Easy listening and brings back memories of times past.<br />Would recommend this product to anyone interested in the &#34;good Ole Days of Music&#34;
B004W4N55C|1.0|Used to love this app but now it crashes constantly on my Nexus 7.  Please fix this soon! These are some additional words to get the word count on this review over 20.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Awesome , now, what to read?  I'll miss it, weird huh! Wonder what's next? Don't think a fourth would be wise though, enough letters?
B002SAS26E|4.0|Don't be put off by the artwork or what appears to be a simplistic game. This is a little gem of a game for 2 players. My wife and I regularly play Jaipur together and thoroughly enjoy it. It is easy to learn but fun and competitive. The game play flows well and can be fast. The counting at the end can be a bit tedious but not enough to put you off. I have also taught this one to my 10 year old son and he easily mastered the rules. I have had friends be a bit put off by this games looks but open minded enough to have a go and they have been converted. Highly recommended.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great read.<br />Would recommend this as a source of information from our point of view.<br />Easy to read and very interesting
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I fondly remember this series.  Now that I'm watching while Downton is finished for the season, I've rediscovered the intricate plot lines of this series and how carefully drawn the characters are, both up and down.
B00886XQO0|4.0|i would have loved this but i had to send it back to turtle beach and they replaced it.it came to my door in a box that looked like it was used as a soccer ball,and the reciver was broken
B000GOY3I0|5.0|my kids love this show.  They ask to watch it over and over.  Makes it even better that is one of the movies that we can stream for free!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I just recently saw the last episode of season 3 and was amazed how I never got into watching this show !!! I immediately got a Roku and signed up for Amazon Prime  so i could stream all the episodes from the 3 seasons between Netflix and Amazon. I am almost at the end of season 2 watching from Amazon and can't wait to get home each day to see more !!!  Amazon Prime has made it so easy.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|This app was perfect as soon as I read the description. The stars respond really well to your touch. The only suggestion I have is that maybe the stars stay the solid sheet like in the beginning and not fly seeking everywhere, just curve and twist. Totally get this app.
B005721W9O|5.0|Galaxy Quest is a comedy filled sci-fi film- perfect for a date night or a family night in! It will always be one of my favorites.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its always so fun and easy to play me and my friends always play it together
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Excellent. Love it! Truly a simple and easy to use app. But for something so simple, why does it take so long to load?  I'd give it 4 1/2 if I could.<br /><br />Galaxy S3.
1612185495|4.0|After seeing the movie a number of times I was curious to read the book. I found the author painted an interesting picture of the personality of James Bond. He is a little darker than the impression one gets from the movie.  The story moves slowly through the first few chapters and accelerates through the challenges, successes and failures of Bond as he is pitted against the Dr No organization all while getting to know and trying to protect the &#34;bond girl&#34;.<br /><br />Not the work of a literary genius, but entertaining and different enough from the movie to provide easy to read entertainment.
0470932139|3.0|I was expecting more from the website I found this book on.  The information and illustrations using photos are good, but not quite what I was looking for.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Nice job I like it awsome I like the graphics nice how much editor's did it take<br />to do this.
B00004T9UF|5.0|This CD was purchased for m Granddaughter. She has just recently discovered Eminem. She loves it. She understands and appreciates his style.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|One of my favorite movies. Have watched this over and over. Had a problem with the first copy they sent me, it was scratched and would not play. But the company let me return it and I had a new one within a week,
1439152799|5.0|One of the first things I noticed about this book was how beautifully written it is. The author has a lovely, intelligent way of expressing herself. Although I did not find it difficult to figure out, for the most part, what was coming next, I still enjoyed the telling of each part of it--except the end.<br /><br />The ending pages of the story, where we knew what had happened but not exactly how it had happened, dragged for me. At times I felt it was excruciatingly long. This, however, did not dampen my overall enjoyment of reading this book. Although I would have liked a different outcome for some of the characters, it was satisfying enough for me to consider it well worth reading.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Very enjoyable can wait t  players next one. Recommend it to anyone. Very like sim city which is good 5/5
B003KUSUG8|5.0|This CD was purchased for my Granddaughter. She has just recently discovered Eminem.She loves it. She understands and appreciates Eminem's style.
B0054LJGWS|1.0|I read a lot and will finish even mediocre books, but I was so bored with this book half way through it that I put it down and never picked it back up. I read so many great reviews of this book, I am very disappointed that I did not enjoy it. I just kept waiting for something to happen and nothing ever did.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Not a flaw in this show.  It's well acted and directed.  That it's stunning to watch certainly gives viewers even more reason to stay engaged.  Who knows how accurate the lifestyle is, historically.  The show manages to create and capture polarities of life that resonates no matter what time period.  I highly recommend the first two seasons of this show, and am enticed to see more!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is great! I downloaded it a couple days ago and I have not been able to put it down! It is sooo much fun! I recommend this game to everyone who doesn't mind a little gore.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Enjoyed thisbook very much.  Characters were interesting and I will by the following book,<br />Baldacci has come up with some great new reads.
B007KDFWRG|2.0|The instrumentals on most of the songs were so long, I forgot what song I was listening to! Album 2 was seemingly unending and the instrumentals were a show case of &#34;look how many different sounds I can make&#34;. No wonder there were only 4 songs on that disc...they may have run out of room. All in all, I wasted my money.
B004YXE438|5.0|Even though this game is $1.49- its worth the price. Spectrum Puzzles is a jigsaw puzzle. They give you tons of pictures to do. You have a choice after you pick your picture-small (12 pieces), averge (20 pieces), large (30 pieces), and last but not least, huge (48 pieces). Next, you will get to pick a difficulty, easy, medium and hard. Finally, you can do the puzzle. The puzzles are a nice challenge. When you are doing the puzzle, there is NO annoying music. If you do not want to pay money for this app, luckily there is a free version. Get this game! ;)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Really do like playing this game.  Understanding it better would be nice though. Had a ball playing against a friend on a trip.  The three of us had three kindles and we were trying to beat each other.
0765325950|5.0|A very nice conclusion to the Wheel of Time series. I especially love the last two pages. Definitely worth the wait.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love having his on my kindle app for my ipad and iphone. i was able to read it where ever I went- literally couldn't put it down and this is coming from someone who hates reading. Can't believe i've been missing out all these years. Wish they made it mandatory to read for assignments in school!
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Fun movie for the whole family. Keeps you entertained. Graphics are neat. Storyline in imaginative and creative. A must see!
B00009NQQO|5.0|This item was picked out as a 1st birthday gift for my daughter & she plays with it in the tub now & so does my 3 year old. 2 gifts in one I guess. Can't really go wrong with bath tub toys when your kids love taking a bath, huh?
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Thought the story was well written and made me feel I was right there along side each character.  Loved it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love having his on my kindle app for my ipad and iphone. i was able to read it where ever I went- literally couldn't put it down and this is coming from someone who hates reading. Can't believe i've been missing out all these years. Wish they made it mandatory to read for assignments in school!
B004VD3YIM|5.0|Well thought out usable UI. Don't do anything fancy with it other than view my multiple Foscams, but works great for that.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Great game! Many levels. Would like to have unlimited hints at times.Game functions wonderfully. I like that the game views well on my tablet, mahjong is one of my favorite games!
B009GX69RK|5.0|New Girl keeps getting better as the episodes air. Because my DVR malfunctioned and didn't record a much anticipated episode I opted to by it here. It was available the day after it aired. I love that I can view this on either my kindle or my blu ray player. I know I'll buy an episode from here if ever my DVR screws me over again. The ads weren't that bad.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|i love this album and when the price dropped it made it an easy decision to purchase it great price for a great album
B0000CDJPQ|5.0|I have two scanners (both at least 5 years old) with Firewire 400 cables that plug into ports in the back of the Apple Display that I bought with my 2008-era Mac Pro.  The new Mac Mini has a single Firewire 800 port and without an adapter like this, I could only connect 2 of the 3 cables from the monitor (USB, and DVI using the supplied DVI-to-MiniDVI converter that came with the computer), to the Mini.  I'm using the 400-to-800 converter to connect the 3rd cable (Firewire 400) from my 2008 Apple Display, which in turn lets me continue to use the pair of Firewire 400 ports on the back of the monitor, for the two scanners.<br /><br />At first, I didn't think this converter was working because I couldn't detect either scanner from the Print & Scan option of the Mac's 'System Preferences' screen.  (Both scanners are too old to have updated drivers for recent versions of OSX including 10.8; I imagine that's why the system doesn't see them.)  However, after downloading Vuescan, which drives many scanners, I found that Vuescan has no trouble in communicating with each scanner through the Sonnet 400-to-800 adapter so... all is well.<br /><br />There are 9 cables in a single row going into the back of my Mini, and space along the line is tight.  There are 2-3 millimeters to spare on each side of this adapter before you run into the adjacent plugs, so it fits into the array easily.  Another reviewer thought it might be a bit longer than necessary, possibly leading to working loose over time.  That might become an issue, but in my case, the Firewire 400 cable I plugged into itt takes a sharp right bend after leaving the adapter, and is draped across the power cable, 2 cables away, before going the rest of the way to the monitor's cable set.  I don't think it will go anywhere unless the cat gets excited behind the monitors some day.<br /><br />The Sonnet adapter is doing the job I hoped it would do.  I needed to use the scanners over the weekend, so I ordered it on 2-day shipping, and Amazon delivered the package exactly on target.
B0004Z33EG|5.0|I have been satisfied with all purchases and haven't had any problems with films or condition of films I have ordered.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Acting superb; excellent thriller; will keep you on the edge of your seat. Every episode brings a new twist and keeps you guessing
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|was playing and got to hammerhead level 10 wanted to upgrade to next shark I turned the game off for a bit and turned it back on and it reset I lost everything 170000 I didn't use any real money but still not fair at all
B001FB4VXU|5.0|This item was purchased as a gift.  The item was shipped directly to the person receiving the gift.  No problems at all with order.  Very satisfied.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Each episode is so pleasant to watch.  I cant wait for Seasson 4 - to return.  I would recommend this to all my friends.
B0098VXE50|5.0|Great movie. A bit dark but the actors did a great job of capturing the heart of each character.  Would not recommend for younger audiences --younger than 14 yr olds.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think it is great except there should be chat for multiplayer because I had to use signs I meet two peoples at the hotel I was at and we used signs it is so worth it best game ever
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|...and it's been pretty good. Story's good, little twists here and there, keeps you engaged. Acting's good as well, I appreciate the development if each of the main characters.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|What a waste Movie was OK what there was of it till the end then they abruptly end it for another sequel.  I won't be throwing my money away again.  Bad enough you pay premium for a movie but to do so and see just a third or half like this I feel like a fool.  Don't waste your money till it is free and all episodes are available.[[ASIN:B00BWJARHO The Hobbit : An Unexpected Journey (2012)]]
B007NVIB5U|4.0|This British version is different from original American one with gayle harrold. I like this story line better. Not so dragged out either.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|The third season does not disappoint.  The season ends with another cliff hanger which promises even darker things to come.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|I love the mission impossible series. Tom Cruise does an outstanding job. This one was better than the last one because there are fewer face changes that were hard to believe.
B003U4UPHG|4.0|At least the first two seasons are good.  Gilligan's Island with more background info and more people ;)  I'm hooked.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|I'm a hugh fan of this period series, which reflects the&#34;golden age&#34; of advertising, when the three martini lunch and two pack a day cigarette habit were commonplace.
B00BDRJ3Z2|2.0|I think Luke forgot that he has 48-year old women who also like his music!  This CD is targeted 100% towards college kids.  The word &#34;buzz&#34; is just about in every song.  I know a majority of country songs are about drinking, chasing women, etc. but there is a better way to tell the story.  I have seen Luke in concert twice; once with Jason Aldean!  He outshone Aldean by a mile!  His showmanship is superior and reminds me of Garth Brooks' heydays on tour!  I've listened to this CD once and that may be the only time I'll ever listen to it.  Very disappointed in this &#34;party!&#34;
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I DONT LIKE IT I LOVE IT its so cool THE BEST PART ALSO ITS FREE you should buy it
B00139XSBA|5.0|I absolutely love Tom Wolfe, since first picking up his books back in the early 70's.  I never have gotten around to reading this novel, though I saw the movie version some years ago.  The book is way, way better and paints a vivid picture of the late fifties Sputnik scare, and the U.S.'s paranoid catch up at all cost mentality.  I'm sure the original astronauts nor their handlers were overly happy with this portrait of America's space hero's, but I'm sure it hit home more than it didn't.  A great read.
B00BMCLCG6|5.0|JBJ and crew never disappoint!  Saw them in concert a few days before the CD came out and they played a good portion of the CD in concert!  It was great then and the CD is great!  Typical Bon Jovi, which is always GREAT!!  Thanks for keeping it real guys!!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|The game is fun to play. I enjoy playing this game every day. You get to play a free tournament every day.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I'm trying to get up to speed on this series.  Great acting and a story that gets darker with every passing episode.
B002ZG975Q|5.0|Such an interesting way to do Beauty and the Beast. I loved it actually. It was different. Alex was a total hottie ;) so that definitely helped! It was a sweet movie :)
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book is very educational and enteresting too.. I am not much of a reader till now. This is the second Seal book.. 1st an officer and now an enlisted man's story. The hardship, the sacrifices made for our country are illustrated here. Easy to read and follow.. I spent hours reading this.. couldn't put it down..
B001UTW7QU|3.0|I like science, I really do. I may not agree with many of the conclusions modern scientists have come to, but I believe in the process of careful science. This show is not that. With giant leaps of logic and absurd actions, they always manage to figure things out. So, that being said, please don't watch this show to learn about scientific method, or police/FBI procedures for that matter. However, if you, like me, love seeing heads explode, maggots burst out of abdomens and faces melt and transform, this show will bring you delight. The characters are not engaging, although I do enjoy watching John Noble as Walter and Astrid is cool. I am told that in later seasons I will like them better. Guess I will find out, because I really do enjoy all the special effects and gooey-ooey messes.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It occasionally will try to force close but overall it is good.<br />I enjoy the ease of using the app.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I love this app. If you need help with fractions or even decimals this is the app to get. Not only does it simplify fractions it shows the conversion of its decimal form in top right. I got this to help me prepare for placement test and it has been heaven sent. Highly recommend!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You will love this app.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I purchased this CD about 6 years ago and it is still in perfect working condition. Despite the fact that I've listened to it numerous times
B006YTTVHO|5.0|Simple steps to improve communication. It tells about how happiness depend on once own control rather depending on others reaction. Gives points on how to make others comfortable with us while meeting first time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so freakin awesome. Absolutely love it! Would recommend it to anyone! If you ever needed a fun thing to do this is it!
B00BHMF578|5.0|If this doesn't keep you fully focused on the screen, nothing will. Absolutely great film from the takeover to the bios at the end..
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|This show is awesome, I received the DVD's super quick and they were a great price. Way to go amazon and way to go my new favorite show.
B008J05EL8|1.0|This isn't what I thought it was.  Now it's just taking up space on my desktop.<br />Four more words required.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Once again, Ken Follett does not disappoint me. The characters were well developed and the historical information was well researched. Bravo. I can't wait until the third book in the trilogy is published.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Why can you people noy just updare it like minecarts would help switches help a whole lot I also want to make cakes but you can not without milk from cows or without eggs from chickens Amazon if you want people to get this app more than GET UPDATES.
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|Excellent game. I enjoyed playing it on the pc and am thrilled to see it works just as flawlessly on the Kindle Fire HD.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|In my opinion this app is awesome!One thing they could fix would be when we accomplish our goal it should give us one gem.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I think this game is so awesome I had to change the controls to tilt but that's like the only problem I have with it oh and I have been playing this game on my iPhone and I've been waiting for it to come out so I can play it on my kindle fire hd and  it finally has
B004J4WKTW|5.0|A do not miss read. I could not put this book down.  Fantasy galore, and some of the most interesting characters
B006NFKUF6|1.0|Do not get this app it stinks. First aiming is hard. Second there are obsticals. And third if you like reading it a good game for you cuz if you don't read everything you are confused
B00A9V2JSG|4.0|Great book. Only problem is that she describes each page a little too much. Really slow moving. I would love it if not for this problem
B009FZHYKU|5.0|As a lover of the comics, I was a bit hesitant to watch the TV show. However I'm happy to report that it's amazing! Yes, it differs in many ways from the original comic storyline, but in awesome ways and interesting results. Highly recommend watching for any zombie or apocalyptic fans out there!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I like it could give more cool free puzzles but I do like it it one of the better apps for puzzles
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that you should have a make your own character thing that would totally make more people buy this app
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My favorite show. Did away with cable and went to streaming due to the lack of more quality content and amazon is perfect for buying the few shows we do enjoy watching. And we own them! Less money and more opportunities to watch them.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the walking dead you're missing out. Start with Season 1 and work your way towards being caught up. It gets better and better and I'm curious how long they can keep it up!
B005IQ39AY|5.0|So much fun to play. A good way to relieve stress and get your mind working. Makes time pass by so fast.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Love this game. The graphics are wonderful. Totally recommend this game to anyone who enjoys hidden objects games. The mini games were not too difficult to do. And if they are there is the skip button to use. Will play again and again.
B001ECDVKE|5.0|I like to let foreign visitors know what the USA is *really like* so I have given this to a number of international college students. They get a tour of the White House, Congress, the War Room in the WH basement and see what a WH Press Secretary does in his off hours. Of course, maybe our presidents have not been as loony as Jack Nicholson, but seeing Martin Short's representation of a Press Secretary cruising to find an attractive playmate late at night was spot on. I am pretty sure most of these modern Press Secretaries have to resort to something like courting Martian beauties to offset the tedium of their jobs. All around fun at every turn. But hasn't everybody already seen this? Maybe not your foreign friends. Send them a copy!
B00BR476TG|2.0|Don't know what idiot thought of making people click on a purchase to watch a long trailer, but they should be fired. Looks like a good movie and I will be renting it. (Not from Amazon).
B0024FADAQ|5.0|Terrific to see Robert Preston in this role. When I first saw this flick I remembered being drawn in by the lazy, pleasant mood of the thing and the numerous surprises that delighted at every turn of this sci-fi fun fluff. Still worth a revisit every few years. Too bad there wasn't a sequel.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|An incredible story told in the most natural and spontaneous way.All the characters are utterly believable.There is nothing not to like about it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I had heard so much on these books and it seemed there were alot of mixed feelings about it.  So I decided to keep an open mind.  I loved these books so much, I ended up reading them a second time.  The storyline is great and explains why people are the way they are and it is a good love story to top it off. I would recommend reading it for yourself and decide.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The new USB cord works to charge my Kindle.  I was having trouble with the cord that came with my Amazon not charging it. I contacted Amazon and they made it right by supplying me with a new cord which works very well.  Thanks Amazon!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|As I gave the review for book 3, it is the same for book 2.  I loved the trilogy of this series!
B006OOHYIC|4.0|well its ok. it is something to do whating for the bus. for a buck you cant go wrong. its only a buck
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book and hated to see it end but looked forward to reading the 2nd and the 3rd book of this trilogy.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|I like this book. It's a story that somewhat takes off where the lightning thief series left off but introduces New characters and concepts. I will probably read the next book as well
B002YCVX5S|5.0|If you haven't seen this one it's a great story with great actors especially Christoph Waltz and Til Schweiger.Must see.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I bought this after I found myself ordering it from PPV for the fourth time. It has some weaknesses, and it certainly doesn't match up with \\"Alien,\\" but it still has a, what, mood to it that draws me back. The Blu-Ray is excellent.
B007LE3PXW|5.0|Heard some of this album on the radio,then the internet.Caught my ear after a few listens then I kindof go hooked on it.It was a great preview for seeing the concert this summer and the concerts that I saw were pretty good especially considering that they sold out most if not all venues that She played at for the tour.She's happened to have the best year among musicians as far as ticket sales for Her Mdna concert.She seems to have worked Her ass off to get where She has gotten.An American success story.<br />As far as this album,favorites include Love Spent,Turn Up the Radio and Girl Gone Wild.<br />Hope you find it as entertaining as I do.
B00BF123WG|1.0|This movie was terrible boring and too long Seal Team Six was much better can't believe this piece of garbage was nominated for anything but understand why it didn't win I kept waiting and hoping for it to be over but just kept going and going.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We just love the British story lines and the history behind them.  At Downton Abbey, the family are so kind and down to earth, not like royalty has been portrayed in other stories, and the servants are treated fairly and like family.  Maggie Smith is one of our very favorite actresses.  Her sense of humor brings so much life to the story.  Can't wait for the next seasons!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this app is fun and crazy I always play it I think it is fun and if you get it you will love it.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Unfunny, painful to watch, depressing, pointless, unrelatable characters and situations... if that sounds like your type of movie then go for it.  I hated this movie and most of the characters in it.
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|one of the best shows ever.  the first episode will suck you in and then you will be hooked! Great
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Simply amazing. Another top-class product from the producers of &#34;Fireproof&#34; with performances that deserve highest commendations.<br />It has something for everyone...action, humour, romance, drama and most of all a great message.<br />The story flows well and the different plot lines ensure a multi-dimensional cohesion that drives the viewer to one conclusion: Healthy Families Need Men of Courage.<br />Two thumbs WAY UP!!!
B0043VDIAG|5.0|Fantastic book,  I couldn't put it down and was so pleased I read the book before I saw the movie
B00BJNHACS|1.0|I really hate to download a FREE game app. Only to find it is not At all playable unless you \\"PURCHASE\\" items to go with it. Probably a great app. Looks cool .....but definately not FREE. SHAME ON U.
B00622B3MY|1.0|My son (and both my husband and myself) absolutely love Cars, the original. We were so excited to get Cars 2, thinking that the first one was so great, the second one must be great as well.  We were very very wrong.  Cars 1 is a classic, an original and fun story that you can watch over and over and continually enjoy.  The sequel is nowhere near as fun, as smart, as creative or as enjoyable.  It goes from being a film for all ages, to a film for a much older audience of children but not as enjoyable for their parents.  Its bland, boring, and just plain dumb.  Total disappointment from these Cars 1 fans!  Spend your money on a different film.
B00AA7O6QC|4.0|It had a lot of action and humor.  I found it entertaining. I would definitely recommend it if this is the type of movie you like.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Outstanding Sci Fi book - great reading could not put down.  Started reading at night and couldnt sleep it was that great!
B00BHMF578|4.0|I really enjoy movies that are based on true events.  I knew of the hostages, but never knew about the 6 that had escaped.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|It was a great book, easy to read, and it wraps you into the characters very quickly. I recommended it to a lot of my friends
B009AMANH4|5.0|Not much to say here.  Anyone who has seen the movie will understand what a great job Daniel Day-Lewis did.
0316069434|5.0|All of Michael Connelly's books are well written mysteries, that show meticulous procedures of the protagonists careers. In the Harry Bosch series we see old fashioned, non computerized police procedure. Harry is a smart, dedicated and effective policeman with a need to speak for the dead. His specialty is cold cases.<br /><br />The Black Box is the key to any airplane crash. The Black Box in a police procedural is therefore a metaphore to the key to the mystery.<br /><br />In this story Harry is forced to take a vacation in order to follow the leads to a case his department wants dropped for fear of racial reprocussions. It starts during the 1992 Race Riots in Los Angeles when Harry has a only few minutes to assess the murder of a foreign correspondent. We meet all the characters important to the story in that prologue.<br /><br />20 years later this cold case heats up due to a newspaper article on The Riots. It is a case Harry has never been able to forget. Was she killed because she was in the wrong place at the wrong time? A blonde in an alley near the intersection Crenshaw and Slauson, a hot-spot during a race riot? What was a Scandinavian reporter doing there anyway?<br /><br />Someone in central California has an interest in the case. Why? Harry goes looking and finds more dead bodies along the way.<br /><br />Add to the cold case the fact Harry is being investigated for wrong doing by Internal Affairs and you have a compelling mystery well worth reading by any mystery fan.
0395925037|5.0|Everyone has heard of Hitler's \\"Mein Kampf\\" but few have actually read it. The work itself is a rather dry analysis of the German political situation following World War One. The book was largely composed by Rudlf Hess, the future deputy Fuehrer, not Hitler. However, anyone who plows through it will find a fairly cogent political analysis, not the raving lunacy popularly alleged. Hitler actually says that he was originally sympathetic to the Jews and only changed his mind because of the tremendous Jewish involvement in Marxism. No one any longer disputes this; it is admitted by one Jewish reference work after another.<br /><br />\\"Mein Kampf\\" is of historical value only; it no longer corresponds to actual political conditions. It does show, however, that Hitler had a very analytical mind. He thought quite clearly - and many of his positions were carefully thought out.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I am becoming more interested in reading history the more I am exposed to it .I will probably look for similar books.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|if this app had a built in razor wooo hoooo ! really nice sleep timer i needed one and it works great . Kindle FHD, has no timer for music so i had to get this app .Would have given it 5* if it didnt shut down when you klick out or turn the page so to speak has to be left open and on or it shuts down oh well still nice !
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book was typical of John Grisham's writing style .I will eventually plan on reading more of his work next.
B005K17RU0|4.0|great app i like to stay in tune with my environment and Accuw.  really fits the bill ,a little slow at times but its free so buck up little doggy!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|To play this game you have to have very good eye and hand coordination. It's very good for young adults.
0545157617|4.0|We have lots of the Julia Donaldson books and I like them so much for  my own children that I bought the for a friend's birthday.  We're not friends anymore, but I guess she liked the books because she kept them.
B005HS4CUY|3.0|I did not read the fine print, but only 3d no regular blu-ray movies!  would I recommend this. Yes, if you want 3D blu-ray nothing else then ok!
0060005696|5.0|When I first read it I saw myself described in the book. Now I understand why too much choice is not really good for me, everyone should read it.
B00785P2QC|3.0|The game is ok, nothing more... I am only writing a review because it is one of the goals of the game so I am....
B0087GF8ZG|2.0|It was working at 1st, not great. I can live with it. But now 2 weeks later, motion-sensing no more. It randomly turn on. My other light from Megabrite are much better. I dont have the packing anymore to return.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I mean it's ok, but it gets a little annoying after you learn that you could easily lose all your stuff so fast.  If your cell phone, ipod, or tablet goes to sleep or turns off, you lose all of your stuff.  Whether your playing with a friend or by yourself, it's so easy to lose all your stuff all at once.
B004XZ99LO|5.0|I had seen this before and actually bought it as a gift for a friend. They just bought a BluRay Home Theater system recently and I knew this DVD would blow them away - it did!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I've been a Harry Potter fan since the first book was published. This means that I love the movies and this movie was perfect for me because it didn't have any of the extra nonsense I don't use (blu-ray, another DVD with extras, etc) and was a great price! I loved the movie once I finally saw it and am sad the series has ended. I would recommend this version to anyone who doesn't care about the extras and just wants to have a DVD version of the movie.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|This album has such a variety of music that it's hard not to get tired of it! Radioactive is also a good workout song!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I've been a Harry Potter fan since the first book came out and I purchased this movie because I just needed to see it. I hadn't seen it in theaters and I have all the other movies so I bought this one and Part 1 while they were discounted. I would recommend this movie to any Harry Potter or fantasy fan, especially if they don't care about DVD extras or blu-ray.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was one of those books that I couldn't stop reading until I was done. I was hoping for a more complete ending but who knows maybe another one is coming.
B00BP4Z8XY|3.0|There were some moments that my heart filled with nostalgia but overall it doesn't compare to other kids' movies. It may be because I  had high hopes for it because several people said it was good but it was boring and overall plot was not great (lonely character seeks to be accepted into a larger society but in the end he realizes that even though he is lonely and not the 'good guy'  that his role as the 'bad guy' is equally important because he keeps balance and the game from getting ruined and put out of order.
B000KITQK2|5.0|I thought this brand makes puny devices. I was looking for something that would improve my acoustic guitar's sound on an amp to make it sound more acoustic. This device did not disappoint. If you need your acoustic guitar to sound acoustic on an amp, this once good device will do the trick.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Completely addicted to this season! Every week I can't wait for it to come out on Amazon since I am not in the states to watch it on Sunday night! Great quality and Amazon releases it fairly quickly after it premiers on Sunday. So happy I found it!!!
B00BWJARHO|3.0|I found myself wanting to take several breaks from the constant violence in this film...it just never lets up. The production is amazing, but the story just relies on too much violence.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I have looked forward to watching Argo. Ben Affleck's latest film is a memorable dramatisation of the CIA's rescue of six diplomats from Iran and does a great job at providing tense dramatic action with some dark humor thrown in. Although there a few mistakes from the era that aren't totally accurate, I think Affleck does a good job at recreating the situation in the late 70's with Iran. Some with say that there is some dramatization of the CIA's role and I won't argue that, but for the most part I think it provides a good feel of the situation at that time. What true story movie doesn't take a dramatic license in story telling? The acting in this is solid and the characters look very true to the original people from the real situation. Maybe not in the league of other Oscar winners but still a good movie nonetheless.
B002HJ9PTO|3.0|This turned out to be a pretty average mic. If you don't have a mic, it's fine, but if you're looking for an upgrade, this isn't it.
B00679T1EO|5.0|One of the best TV shows. I will highly recommend to any one. The language is so beautiful, the acting is superb. I loved it every minute of it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved this book and series. I would recommend it to any adults, good read. Very informative and will pique your interest.
B00BSHVSQ4|3.0|I fell for a similar \\"Sales Gimmick\\" Amazon pulled when they released the bluray of the Star Trek Reboot. Amazon offered a \\"Star Trek Limited Edition Replica Gift Set (Three-Disc + Digital Copy) (Amazon Exclusive)\\" for sale. Amazon made it clear that there were only a total of 5,000 pieces they were selling in the Limited Edition Set. Great, I thought! I'll buy one then immediately purchased an additional piece the following day. I opened one of the 2 that I purchased. NO CERTIFICATE ANYWHERE IN THE BOX NOTING WHAT NUMBER OF 5,000 I HAD RECEIVED !!!!! I posted comments about this on Amazon and found others who had purchased this set, wondering the same thing. The set included a nice metal replica of the new Enterprise. With Christmas coming up, I wondered how long it would take for the 5,000 pieces to sell because the price wasn't too outrageous. I thought 5,000 pieces would go fast with the price being reasonable and all the fans out there who would scoop them up. Well, I watched and waited. I kept seeing Amazon selling the set a week after its available shipping date. Amazon was still selling them the next week and the next week. These pieces were being sold from Amazon, not from outside companies or individuals. Christmas came and went and Amazon was STILL SELLING PLENTY OF THESE LIMITED EDITION SETS ! This was 6 weeks after the 5,000 \\"Limited Edition\\" started being shipped. How can you tell if Amazon is selling a lot more than 5,000 copies if the pieces are not numbered?? You can't. That's the problem. Again, each set sold for a reasonable price (right around $100) for what you received when you're thinking you're going to receive an item that will include a certificate telling you which number of the 5,000 you received. Why Amazon still had pieces left of the 5,000 copies in their warehouse 7-8 weeks after they went on sale (well throughout and after the Christmas Holidays, mind you) had me and several other customers questioning whether we had been \\"SUCKERED\\"!  BUYERS BEWARE! Unless Amazon is willing to Clearly State that each piece of the 5,000 pieces will include a Numbered Certificate, there's no way to know for sure if Amazon is truly limiting the sale of this item to 5,000. You've been warned by someone who feels like he's been burned by Amazon pulling a similar tactic when I (and many others) bought our \\"Limited Edition\\". Amazon needs to guarantee each piece will be numbered before they ship even one piece of this product! Feel free to review some of the comments that came up during the Star Trek Limited Edition Gimmick at the Amazon link I am providing. http://www.amazon.com/induvidually-numbered-really-gonna-worth/forum/Fx28S372GYAR5JE/Tx1RTF5BZTETPSV/1/ref=cm_cd_fp_ef_tft_tp?_encoding=UTF8&asin=B002HWRZH0
B0076DELIG|5.0|The book was thrilling and is a good read.<br />The ending provides  a glimpse of what you can expect from Michael Connelly
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I enjoyed this story, the twists/turns and the pace was excellent! Those who like Grisham teasers will not be disappointed!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Great movie to watch with the family, very well done, another Disney hit, very touching movie for everyone to see
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Trip Advisor makes planning a trip so easy!  The search feature for a city or zip code makes locating your destination, places to stay, places to eat, and things to do so convenient.  The save/favorite feature allows you to quickly and easily return to that location.  Links to websites and phone numbers are a click away as well as navigation to where you want to go.  The reviews are plentiful and helpful.  The app identifies popular as well as off the beaten path locations/activities.  What a great way to discover a new place or make the most of stops along the route of a road trip.  I downloaded it to my Kindle Fire as well as my iPhone.  Love it!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have purchased a couple kindles for my wife and now I am able to use my notebook just like the kindle.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|This app was exactly what I was looking for.  A place to store my notes and reminders on my Kindle Fire.  An electronic note pad...keeping me organized with my thoughts all in one easy to access location.
0553386697|5.0|this book is fantastic to learn new ways to be<br />with our children and their learning.  Easy read and<br />yet quite smart!
B00899F0G8|5.0|This is a great series. Very suspenseful and always keeps you guessing. And i Can not wait for the next season.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|A great gift for Xmas! My nephew enjoyed it as he is a big fan of the show. Great series.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great enjoyment for the whole family with rewards and puzzles pieces needed to get to the next level. Can't wait to see what's next.
B00BBQXQFI|3.0|It was nice to sit down and watch something that everyone enjoyed.  It was not just a baby version of characters
B003TTMFCK|5.0|I love this show, and have since season 1. I've missed watching for the past several seasons so it's awesome to be able to go back and catch up with episodes on my Kindle! Overall, I'd recommend Grey's Anatomy to anyone...the storylines and love triangles make for a great way to spend 60 mins.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Game presents a challenge as it not easy to win.Shows different moves and keeps you on your toes! Like the hints it gives and helps you get better.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put this book down and read it in one day!  The events and suspense were first class. Can not wait to read the final book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|my son plays this game constantly!  it is a great game to have when we are on the go! I wish it was a little cheaper to purchase but has been worth paying for!
B008MEM24S|3.0|Merlin is my six year old I got it for. It is only 99 cents and he plays it so I say go for it
B007PTJOV0|5.0|my son loves this game reminds him of Mario bros! he enjoys throwing the acorns! great app for the kindle.
B0091REZMW|5.0|What an amazing game. Especially since it is a mystery game and I absolutely love mystery games! This is the best game EVER!!!!!
B003B02O3C|5.0|I like John Grisham. But this book is an eye opener for me about how lawyers work and how difficul it is to establish themselves. I am not done with it yet but I am looking forward everyday to read some more.
B005XN0SGU|3.0|I've had to re-install it a few times. Don't know the cause of the issues. When it runs, ot runs smooth. I use it as a back-up reader because Comicat has trouble with ramdom cbr's and displays black pages. Perfect Viewer seems to not have this issue, which makes ir superior to Comicat. However, I prefer Comicat's imterface. So far, I have not found a really great comic reader app, but I would recommend this one. It does get the job done.
B000002NCW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this CD - something to have playing in the background - very soothing.  I especially love the Scottish tunes played by Mike.  An excellent purchase.
B000L53D4O|5.0|The kids love this walker. My grandson and great nephew both have one and play with it all day.  The activities on the front are fun for them and it is very stable when walking with it.  Easy to steer and get over bumps.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Well done mostly true story about a young surfer who had passion and chased his dreams. The movie did not rely on the usual sex and drugs that hollywood seems to put into every movie in an attempt to get ratings.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|What else can I say... It's Downton Abbey!!  Best series ever!  Even though I watched every episode on PBS, I had to own the entire series.
B000VX042U|4.0|My husband has been buying this shoe for almost 30 years, and this is his third pair.  It's heavy, durable, and comfortable with jeans and khakis.  The only drawback is that shoelaces have to be professionally replaced when the leather breaks because a single laces runs all the way through the back.
B00846WWVM|4.0|The basic challenge is always the same, put out the fires. The variety of maps and the added dimensions of other objects keeps the gameplay refreshingly original. The game is sort of like Where's my water.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|I like it because its really fun and the animals are cute but........ its a little confusing....... I STILL LIKE IT! :-P
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Complex and spellbinding. The multiple points of view add to a sense of mystery and discovery as the plot advances through different character's eyes.
1616550414|5.0|Amazing book, with lots of pictures, artwork, back history and the official chronology....<br />Zelda fans cannot miss this! ;-)<br />Totally recommended.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Its full of action around every corner and never gets old. I recommend it for all ages and keep running
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It isn't as much about Zombies, its society and individual relationships. What would you do to stay safe?<br />More than you might think!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I have been enjoying the music since the show came on and am thrilled to be able to listen to it anytime I wish.  Fans of the show would love it!
1449325947|5.0|If you are interested in learning CSS3 this has got to be one of the best books to learn it. I have read other books in the Missing Manual series about complex programs.  The learning curve for the programs was steep, and the books were too.  Even though CSS3 can be complex, this books explains the subject matter in easy to understand chunks.  You just follow the code in the examples and voila it works.  One problem is a few of the examples are a little confusing, but if you think about it, you can figure it out.  Once again, one of the best books i have ever read and and it really explains CSS3 thoroughly.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|I enjoyed this book. Mathmatical topic is difficult for me to get it, but the last half is very adventurous.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a fun and addictive game.  I remember playing this game on the boardwalk at the beach.  I've solved all the puzzles and have so many coins.  It's not a game with alot of strategy but fun to pass some time.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Have really enjoyed the game. I am not a person who usually enjoys games but this one is addictive. Brings back memories of the classic game but is a lot more fun.
B004ZGI2KK|3.0|I can see a lot of Twilight in this film and that's not a good thing to me.  This wasn't a far stretch for director, Catherine Hardwicke, and it just felt poorly done.  There was no reason for me to care about any of these characters, therefore I didn't.  If you're a Twilight fan, see it.  If you like forbidden love, which I do, you'll probably feel the same way about it.  It all around could have been better.  Especially with Seyfried as the lead, this movie had more potential.
1616550414|5.0|Great book. The legend of Zelda comes to life through the vivid pictures and amazing historical details given to us through a new timeline. I've always wanted to see the 20 design sketches for Mida. Is that a character? It should be! No but seriously it's pretty cool for the Zelda fanatic. (Aka me)
B000W453KQ|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie in years but it still has the same affect no matter how many times I've seen it.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|NO spoiler's here, Just an amazing movie really lets you get a better understanding of how things were set into motions for<br />Lord Of The rings. I was at the edge of my seat the whole time, when the end came i was like  &#34;NO TO SOON&#34;. I was wanting more<br />can't wait for part 2!!!!!!!!!! :D :D :D :D :D
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Start with Season 1 and continue on through all the seasons. You won't be disappointed. I hope season 4 is in my future.
0425264386|5.0|Since Mr. Child chooses to write half his series in first-person, this one is the last in third-person so I'm all caught up with the series, except the latest which is still in hardback only and will have to wait a while. I hate first-person so I'll never read those books.<br /><br />Having gone through at least half the series, I've become well acquainted with Jack Reacher. For the most part, I like him as a hero. He's quiet, a loner, basically a good guy with no real direction, no roots and no friends, except who he's around at the moment. He takes no bull and pulls no punches. Somehow, he ends up in dire situations and comes out ahead in the end. This final story, at least for the time being, was no exception. It stood above some of the others not only in plot but in enjoyment.<br /><br />As with all the other reviews I did, I won't go into the plot details as I'm sure with 600+ reviews already, I've come late into the game and others have surely spoiled that. Instead, I'll give my take on what I liked or didn't like about this read.<br /><br />One overall impression is Child's take on militias. As I read deeper into the story, a lot about militias unfolded. The author's political views could have easily spoiled things either way, but he kept at least neutral enough to hold them as a bunch of ultra-right wing whackos without going into any political rants, one way or the other. The characters, especially the bad guys ranted in spades, but the good guys never really went all out condemning them more than saying they were crazy criminals. They could easily have devolved into lectures on the right and wrongs of militias. I read a book a while back by Dan Simmons that turned me off big time because he became very political. The militia aspect was more a plot device rather than a political statement.<br /><br />As for the action, there was plenty, from the moment Reacher helped hold Holly, the heroine's, dry cleaning to the final gotcha' moment just before he fades into the sunset.<br /><br />Some would take issue with the militia themselves as untrained backwater hicks, especially their whacked-out leader. In the case for entertainment, I didn't find it any worse than your typical Hollywood movie and there's probably a good bit of truth to it. However, whether there are many people with the kind of skill Reacher has is purely speculative.<br /><br />As with most of this series, I was glued to my seat, always wanting to find out what happened next. The usual quirks were there. Child tends to write very passive at times with enough \\"was's\\" to fill about a third of the book. He also has a nasty habit of using \\"He said nothing.\\" a lot. At least in this one he didn't over use \\"K-turn\\" because they didn't spend much time in vehicles for the majority of the action.<br /><br />There were some great set pieces here and the ending came out just the way I like it. Highly recommended.to the sunset.<br /><br />Some would take issue with the militia themselves as untrained backwater hicks, especially their whacked-out leader.

B0087GJ8KM|4.0|I've used this book in team meetings to show how we may put other tools in our arsenal.  We are employees no longer hold all the cards to a sale.
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|This is not her very best work, but it was an entertaining read, as always.  It's a nice development of Ivan's character.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Good Summer read......good romance....somewhat predictable, but not offensive.  Really hate that I have to have a certain number of words for this review.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I found this book to be well written and superbly interesting.  It is a true story which makes the details ever more amazing.  A must read for WWII infectionadoes...
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|One of the best futurama dramas in a long while. Very noir-ish and folds back in on itself (see: Blade Runner). Sound track and ambient sound are incredible. Definitely watchable and re-watchable. Caveat: Not for under 14 or so. Graphic violence (though not casual or unrelated to the plot).
B007N85POS|4.0|I am enjoying this version of  Angry Birds most of the time.  However,  I find the power ups to be very frustrating!  They absolutely do NOT give you any noticeable boost. Just working with angle and shot trajectory has more effect than power ups.  I have actually had boosted birds bounce right off structures that the normal birds take down.  Once the free boosts are used up I will definitely not waste the money to buy the power ups for this version of what is otherwise a mostly fun game.
B002S45V32|5.0|Timeless and wonderful, this movie always brings back great memories of high school and earl relationships. The soundtrack is one of the best out there.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|This is my fourth version of Angry Birds and I am quite disappointed with it.  The graphics are good, but the birds' powers are not.  I am fairly adept with the other versions of this game and enjoy the challenge of figuring out the necessary angles and trajectories needed to win the levels.  In this version it is extremely difficult to over come the handicap of weak bird powers and the inability to actually be able to aim the birds.  However, my 10 year old grandson, who is a whiz at the Angry Birds games, and also struggles with the version, is enough of a Star Wars fan to still enjoy it; thus the 3 star rating.  For my personal rating of enjoyment and playability I would not give it more than about a one and a half.  I am glad it was on sale for .99 when I bought it as I feel it is not worth the usual $2.99 price.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is fun my friends play it so I thought it looked fun it is fun its addicting too.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|Will not work with my Kindle Fire HD. I get a prompt box that says it's not compatable. But I still paid for it.
B00012QM8G|4.0|It begins in 1939 after German forces defeat the Polish Army. In Poland, Jews are being ordered to register all family members and relocate to major cities. With World War II nearing, all Jews from Krakow and surrounding areas are forced from their homes and required to crowd into an area of only sixteen square blocks. During the Midst of everything,a German businessman named Oscar Schindler who also happens to be a member of the Nazi Party, is trying to start and run a factory with the help of an official of Krakow's Judenrat named Itzhak Stern. Since Schindler doesn't have any money, he tries to persuade Jewish businessmen to lend him some in return for a share of products that will be produced in his factory. Meanwhile, Itzhak Stern is going around recruiting Jews to work in the factory and to also prevent many from being sent to concentration camps. After the Plaszow concentration camp is completed, SS Lieutenant Amon Goeth orders troops to force Jews out of the ghetto and to kill anyone who tries to resist. Those who stay behind and hide are later found and also killed. Schindler witnesses the massacre of many Jews and becomes somewhat horrified by it and therefore tries to save as many lives as he can including those of his workers. After hearing that remaining Jews would be sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp, Schindler persuades Goeth to allow him to keep his workers so that they could be relocated to a factory in his home town. This of course comes with a price, which Schindler can afford at the moment. Upon agreement, Schindler and Stern make a list of the workers and people they wanna prevent from being taken to Auschwitz. The majority of the people from Schindler;s list arrive safely at the new site but the train carrying the women accidentally makes its way to Auschwitz. In order to release the women, Schindler has to bribe the camp commander with diamonds. Most of his fortune is utilized to bribe Nazi officials in order to keep his workers alive,which results in him running out of money towards the end of the war in Europe. In 1945, Germany surrenders to the Allies and Schindler packs his bags and leaves to escape the Red Army. The next morning, the Schindler Jews receive great news that they have been liberated.
B00571F26Y|2.0|Some of the Science seemed a little out there to me.  You do lose weight when you stop eating wheat because wheat is in everything!  When I give up wheat I cut out 75% of the carbs I eat and I feel like it's the cutting back on carbs that loses the weight,  and that the wheat is not as toxic as this book claims.
B007SGM084|2.0|I wish I had not fallen for the hype. It was definitely NOT everything that people said it would be. It does have the potential to be a good story though.
B009HV2JT8|2.0|It starts out entertaining but quickly becomes quite boring. Needs more vampires and less politics. More action would have made a much better movie.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|Definitely a wonderful story. Touching, and with such a great twist at the end! I enjoyed it plenty. The movie did NOT do it justice.
B001P06GX4|5.0|blokus is a great game ,i played with my kids and we all had a great time ,its also great with adults its just fun fun fun
B000FA675C|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book! I remember when it first came out and I bought it in hard-cover, I could NOT put it down.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Impressive animation and heart-touching story.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who is a Pixar fan, or even if you aren't.
B00BSBY38A|3.0|I Was expecting a lot more considering all the attention the movie got. The story was good and the cinematography was awesome, but definitely to much hype, still worth watching.
B00AYDC3CG|3.0|My grandaughter (age 9) enjoyed this video.  It was kind of strange, but that was to be expected from Tim Burton.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|An entertaining game with plenty of challenges.  The levels are best if one takes the TIme to figure out that in life most things come when one  is patient and takes the time needed to feel their way through the poo problem.  A game which makes one rely on their instincts.<br /><br />.<br />Yes
B002KEZ96Y|5.0|Who would not LOVE this movie. Not only is it hysterical, but it is actually a really great character movie. Fantastic all the way around.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The passion, the heartbreak, LOVE & loss! Every single emotion will take you as you followed Sky through her journey of discovery. Seriously, a must read!!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Absolutely amazing. One of the best series out there. Great show and fantastic DVD with awesome extras. Epic. It will make you shed unicorn tears.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Very classy blend of older, classic Bond moments with the modernized ones. Good movie! Fun action movie for Bond fans.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Fascinating story line. I could not put it down. I love the way King writes. I highly recommend this book!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Great novel.  I did not want to it it down.  Can't wait to read another one of her books.  A good, fast read.
B0047SHEAK|5.0|Awesome! A must see for predator fans and a great addition to the legacy. Hoping for more more more !
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like all of the information this app gives you in regards to your battery.  I have used it to know when I need to plug in for what I need to do on my Kindle Fire HD.
B0084HJE0S|4.0|The content covered in this knidle book was very helpful in understanding how the newer HTML5 standards are implementing javascript.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Very thought provoking. A different take on other books I read about peole dying and going to the &#34;other side&#34;. Since it was written by a neurosurgeon there was a lot of physical evidence that accounted for the reality of after life. I found it profound and interesting.
B003L77G8I|5.0|Video was delivered almost immediately and in good condition. The price was right. I enjoyed the movie and it is a good addition to my collection.  The only negative comment is that I ordered 4 other videos of this same collection at the same time but since they were delivered at different time I had multiple shipping & handling costs added to my order.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was very interesting and thought provoking. The end presents an unexpected twist to the story. It lends itself to a very good book for discussion.
B0053O89IS|5.0|Video was delivered almost immediately and in good condition. The price was right. I enjoyed the movie and it is a good addition to my collection.

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book gave me chills to see what one man had to endure in the camp. It also provoked much emotion as you read it. There was alot of food for thought here.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|My 26 yr old son suggested I watch this series. I wasn't to keen about watching them. I said monsters and demons come on how good could they be. Well, for the last month my husband has been working out of town, so I have had extra time on my hands, and I have watched all eight seasons. I'm hooked I love them I even have some girls at work watching them with me on my PC. I would definitely recommend them.
0345803485|5.0|I'm not an avid reader, but I could not put this book (or the following two) down.  I finished the trilogy in just under six weeks, where it would have taken me that long for just the first book. I recommend this to anyone who is curious and wants to see what this is all about.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Great second installment, can't wait to read the third and final book. Wish I'd found this series earlier it's been too quick to read.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|My 4 and 7 year old love it.  The controls could be a bit better, but we may not have it dialed in yet.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Another real page turner but the end was a little to neat and a little too short. Can't wait for the movie.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This was a really great movie. I'm not sure if I would let my 3 year old watch it until she's a little bit older but I enjoyed it.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Now I know what all the fuss was about. It is a great book and to be honest after the first few steamy scenes I forgot about that and concentrated on the relationships and story.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This book really captures the pain and stress that the troops go through while in a time of war and hell
B00B671W6W|1.0|I'm a huge Anthrax fan, but never been a fan of albums comprised of only covers, but figured that the band would put \\"their sound\\" into these songs. Not so. I'm not being cruel here, but I've heard garage bands do better covers of a few of these tracks, and several of them are down-right embarrassing. Remember Pat Boone's album of Heavy Metal covers? I'd seriously rather listen to that album.<br /><br />I've got to give credit where it's due; I love Anthrax. In fact, I've never heard an Anthrax song that I didn't like....until now.. I've got 7 of them, and a remix. I should never Never say Never!
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|Exciting season!  I love this series.  The CD's arrived quickly and in good order.  The CD's played without much freezing.  Good Price too!
B008DVJMAW|5.0|First listning of this CD gave me goosebumps, this is 2013 troubadurs telling storys of their lives, lokal coulorite and standarts. Everything done in a simple and humoristic way. Super CD! Ps. Why is their oldere CD´s so expencive? Wanna hear more from those guys..
B004YCKK6Y|5.0|A lot of people do not know this movie, but they should. The reason I got it was for a friend to watch it. I tried my best to describe it and just couldn't. LOL It's very funny, although it's not as funny as I remember it being, but I still got a bunch of giggles from it. It's an adult movie, not R but racy. After my friend watched it, she handed it back to me with a huge smile saying, &#34;That is one messed up movie.&#34; It's Tarentino, what sis she expect?!
B0094K1QR8|3.0|My grandson made fun of me for watching this movie he said it was a &#34;chic flick&#34; but I found it to be cute.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|I have always been a fan of the Crüe.. It is a very raw look into the life of someone who has it all.. My heart and prayers will always go out to anyone that has to deal with such struggles in life.
B004VMUS9G|3.0|An excellent app.  IIt has a  limited function that is done well as well as being cool and attractive to the eye.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book started out exciting and was fun reading I really enjoyed it I didn't want to put it down. Also it was easy reading.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|Once I started using feedly, I can't stop. It is so very convenient to have everything in one place. It saves me so much time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I . Would recommend this book to everyone I loved it read all three in less than a month didn't like that the ending felt rushed but I hope for a fourth and defiantly ready for the . Movie!!!!!!
B007FRA8Z8|5.0|I have worn this album out! I did not enjoy many of the songs on her first album but this one is full of girl-power anthems. I could not wait until it was on iTunes to buy it so I had to order it from the UK.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I have never been more impressed with a 3d movie. i could literally stop after watching disc one and be content. Amazing!
B000SVZIGC|5.0|I loved this movie when I was a kid and still do. I had to update my VHS collection with DVDs and the price on this one was great. Worked perfectly and I'm happy to have it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is a great game .Maybe even better than Temple run 2 . My kids can't stop playing even me !
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Really fun to play. However; you can really tell when you need to take some art classes! You also need to have a friend that will play the game with you often.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely adore this app!! Great quality and lots of fun! I would definitely recommend this app to anyone who loves horses.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I think that PBS should have waited until the series ends to release a box set of Downton Abbey. I will hold out and wait for the complete series box set. If anyone releases a box set of a TV show, they should wait until the series ends.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I think this book was full of surprises that no one could expected. I loved the book and recommend the book to everyone
B00AREIAI8|3.0|makes me miss my horse.<br />love the grafics it takes alot of time to earn rewards but still lots of fun .. good for kids too.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Someone selected this for our book club and I am so pleased I had time to read it. You get pulled in quickly and ache so desperately for Victoria to be okay.
B001L26THY|5.0|This is Clapton as he should be....good down home blues and covers. You can hear and feel the passion he puts into every note. I could listen to this CD over and over.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|I wanted to swoon, to float away in the drama of fictional folk.  But I found myself unable to care about either their loves or their alleged lives. My guess is that the beauty of the production sucked the life out of the characters--creating a distancing that left them as stick figures in elaborate costumes.  Oh yes, the production is lovely to watch for a short time.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This application is easy to play and navigate through. I detest all the pop up ads, but that's the price for &#34;free&#34; downloads.
B008220D7S|1.0|I usually love Paul Rudd movies and I bought this sight unseen.  I'll probably sell it back to Amazon for a gift card.  In order for a film to be meaningful or entertaining, the audience has to care about the characters, and that's very hard to do in this case.  I disliked the wife right off the bat and nothing during the film changed my mind.  Her character arc is as flat as most of the arguments she has with her husband.  I never developed an affection for the husband (Rudd) as much as sympathy and a nagging curiosity as to what on earth ever attracted him to that self-centered witch in the first place.  The problems the daughters have with their own relationship isn't helped by the fact their parents have poor communication skills and difficulty defining their own boundaries.  It would be unrealistic to expect them to raise two children with healthy concepts of self-worth, much less self-respect and respect for their elders.  The family in this movie is not funny.  It's dysfunctional with a capital \\"D\\" and that's the grade it deserves.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I am a 37 year old guy and I loved this movie.  I thought the actors did a good job (yes I include Crowe in this for all the naysayers).  I think what he did works for the movie.  I don't think belting it out like Quast would have worked in this medium.  It might have been a little too overpowering.  But that is just me.  Anne Hathaway was good as Fantine, and Samantha Barks was a good Eponine (I have always been more partial to her than Cosette anyway).  Hugh Jackman gave a good performance once I got used to his singing voice.  Could have easily won the Oscar if not for Daniel Day-Lewis.<br /><br />A lot of people complain about the close ups.  They work.  The characters emotions are unflinchingly in your face.  To mis-quote on of Javert's lines \\"there's no where you can turn\\", it's right there, so you can't help but be pulled in.<br /><br />I also would like to comment to those who said the actors can't sing because they don't sound like their Broadway/West End counterparts: get over yourself.  Just because they change one precious note of your musical doen't automatically make them horrid singers.  I would consider you Broadway/West End snobs.  And before you hack me to pieces, yes, I have seen the 10th and 25th anniversary concerts and I have seen a US touring production that came to Toronto a few years back and I plan to see it again this October when it returns with Ramin Kamerloo as Valjean.  So I do know what it sounds like on stage.<br /><br />Finally, to E. Sadowski who felt she had to click on every other comment (at least on the first few pages I quickly scrolled through)and bash the film over the head: why?  Why waste your time?  I am not being mean, I am simply curious.  I mean, if you hate a thing as much as you do why do you keep coming back to it?
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I love the LotR stories and this one is just as good. The actors nailed it, probably better than the other ones too. Must buy.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|It is nice to finally have a decent app to watch youtube videos, since youtube doesn't always work on the Kindle due to its lack of flash capabilities.  It is best if you know what you're looking for and can type it right in, and it will bring it up.  I do think it could look a little better, but that is just being nit-picky.  Overall, nice app!
B007FTZDN8|5.0|If you're an information junkie, this will satisfy that itch, one 5 or ten minute chunk at a time, then leave you with LOTS to think about afterwards!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app looks very good and has great functionality.  On top of that, and more importantly, it has very accurate forecasts so that I'm prepared for the kind of weather I will be experiencing.  Just a solid app!
B000FA675C|5.0|I downloaded this book for the limited time free offering, primarily to take a look at the new chapter of his next book. But what I realized is that I am just as involved in this book as a I was the first time, even having read the book and seeing the movie, it is still a page turner after all this time.
B007QNRMUU|5.0|Mraz fever over here. Jason Mraz is simple amazing and he is such a talented singer. I love this album so much! I even went to his Love is a Four Letter Word Concert and it sounds so much better live. Love you Mraz.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This is one of the most watchable series that was ever played on TV. There is no better Sci-Fi, Western, Kung-Fu, Drama, Comedy, romance, shoot 'em up, lovable loser, pirate, Buddy show that I have ever seen!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I enjoy playing this game because it has many different things for you to do to take care of your horse and even has competitions! Love it!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My niece got me hooked on  TR 1, this one is even better. I play it every day, it's not easy.
B0006Z2LH4|3.0|Cube Zero, where do I start with this one? The first movie (in release, not sequence) is a great one and the subsequent sequel to it was poor (see my reviews of the other two on my page)so where to go from there? Well if you said a prequel then you are not only right, you are one to understand the pattern of the Hollywood factory these days. If you capture lightning in a bottle, sometimes it is OK to leave it there, watch it glow in the dark and then either let it out to be free again or in this case: smother it with inadequate copies of it. The first [[ASIN:B001DM1V3E Cube]] (aptly named: Cube) was the lightning that started this ride and it is where it should have stayed. Cube Zero is not Cube, but thankfully (and mercifully) is not [[ASIN:B00008DDVY Cube 2 - Hypercube]] either.<br /><br />Here we have an inside view to the machinations of the evil company that created the Cube and a slight nod to the reason it exists. We have a group of varied strangers, all with a secret that makes them dangerous enough to put them into [[ASIN:B000XSEPYQ Jigsaw's]] wet dream of a prison space with little to no regard to their health or well-being; in fact it's a life sentence! If you have seen the first one, you will see some tiny glints of the original deep within this entry and I will let you know that despite my middle of the road rating, it is not as terrible as the second one (I know, I know: stop hating on Cube 2 but I cannot help it!) We have a solid story-line, some very interesting traps (aqua regia anyone?) and a few chances to see what would eventually become the basis for the device in the first movie. Other than that, you can kind of glaze over the parts that were added like the dream sequencing (WTF?), the odd politics of the \\"man from corporate\\", and sit back and watch the writers try and make this a very long episode of the Twilight Zone. Thankfully for Mr. Serling: it was not submitted for his approval.<br /><br />3.25 out of 5.0 stars.<br /><br />-K
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I borrowed this book on my Kindle from my mother, who really enjoyed it. It started out a little slow for me, but as the story progressed, it really drew me in. It became very easy to know the characters, and to feel appropriately for each one. The ending is rather abrupt, but I think that's okay. The story, after all, is about life up to that point. And the end at least gives enough information that you don't feel cheated. I would recommend this book.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I am not normally impressed or inspired by non-fiction books or biographies, but this really is a story of overcoming pretty severe odds to reach the pinnacle of his profession. Someone I would have loved to meet.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I got this as a FAOTD and I absolutely love it. I haven't played too far at this moment, but it is definitely a keeper for those moments when i'm bored! Highly recommend!
B009K916ZK|5.0|the item is very good.  it worked as expected on a daily basis.  just wish the price can be even lowered.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Downtown abbey captures the upper class during major events in history and how they adapt to them. The Crawley's see some unexpected happenings that highlight England during the middle of the century.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|I love, love, The walking Dead 1 & 2, but TWD 3 it's starting to have a little to much<br />sleaze; when you start throwing in nude bodies all the times it usually<br />means your running out of good writing direction.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|I love how fast the shipping process is. Good Job Amazon! Also, the ability to download the MP3 is great. This allows me to have instant access to my music and then store the unopened product when it arrives.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This solitaire game is a classic. I am retired, and I play it at least once a day. I recommend it to all my friends.
B005LW5J9O|4.0|It tells a fascinating story of the conservation of classical documents and how some have demonstrated the incredible scientific instinct of the classical writer, Lucretius. The history of the fight of the Catholic Church to supress all such ideas in order to hang on to their absolute power over the hearts and minds of the Christian faith over the centuries, still resonates even today. This book has been a real eye-opener as well as a gripping read.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Interesting plot with less obnoxious special effects than Quantum of Solace. I also liked the absence of the traditional \\"Bond girl\\" while still having Bond be Bond.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Only problem is too many advertisments. The video ads are annoying. Otherwise the game is very good and easy to play.
B00271HAK8|4.0|This is a no-frills, in-your-face, punchy movie that really ignites the hooky player in me. I highly recommend it to everyone.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I have downloaded a lot of free apps onto my Kindle Fire. Many are pretty much worthless and I get rid of them after only a few tries. Either they don't work or they are just lame. This app is very cool because it's so simple. It's designed to allow the download of You Tube video and mp3s and it does it smoothly and without any bells and whistles. I am supposed to chant the Exultet for the Easter vigil and it's a difficult piece. I couldn't find any source for this one version other than You Tube. So I &#34;googled&#34; and found this app for You Tube. I downloaded it and had my video in less that a minute. I really like clean, functional apps that do what they say. This one is excellent. It's so smooth in fact that if they offered and upgrade that included a small charge, I would do it. End your frustrations. Get this app.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|I love Ken Follett's style of writing I find him easy to read, his character fascinating and his topics very well researched. This book will be loved by all ages. For the young it will be a delight and a history lesson for others a really good read. I look forward to reading his other books
B009HUB40Y|5.0|booty quest is one of if not the best match 3 game out here now. I wish I had found it sooner.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A beautiful and unique love story that everyone should experience.<br />A book that will lift your spirits and break your heart at the same time.
B007L5KT76|5.0|Seen it several times. It deserves more than 5 stars. Really really really really really really good movie.  Highly recommended.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|Some of Simon & Garfunkel's best songs have been compiled on this album. Please note I say some, in order to have all of their best music, you might as well buy all of their music.<br /><br />This doesn't sound partial, does it?
B003JTHXOK|5.0|After reading the book, i would like to go see the movie.  I love so many of Nicholas Sparks books!  Great read!
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Really enjoyed the show but had interruptions and had to reload several times. I love the ability to watch at my convenience.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app right here is addicting, challenging, and fun.<br />Who wouldn't like this, some one who isn't addicting, challenging, and fun. Soo ...
B00005JLPK|5.0|This movie it's great I love the screen effects and the story line it's amazing! 100% recommend it especially if you are an artist.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Masterpiece Classic has outdone itself with this series. Loads of drama, fun characters, and story lines that will keep you wanting more.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|Love the show so I got the book for a good read. Was not dissapointed. Glad they made the show a little different because I still want to read the books to see the outcome.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Very boring read. Although the NDE parts were interesting most of the book was medical jargon and the last 25% could be cut off book altogether.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|After the second season I was beginning to wonder how the action would pick back up. And as I suspected the season premier did not disappoint. Action was evident throughout every episode and the twists kept me on the edge of my seat. A must watch if you enjoy zombies! If you don't follow the other seasons however, you will be lost in alot of their daily lives so try and catch up before watching!
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I like this product over a mere web browser access of YouTube.  What seems best is the way it lays out popular choices to select from, or you can input your own.  I cannot say if it will glitch up anytime down the road, but it is user-friendly, and that is important.  To say at least, it works on my Kindle Fire HD.
0385493622|3.0|I had to get this book for school. All things considering, it could have been worse, but I wouldn't willingly choose and read this book
B005VT42BS|5.0|Trying to access it although it is secure.  I have not fully explored what this app can do, but it provides a level of confidence knowing you have eyes-on any network you're using, and can identify users by IP address as well.  A must for wireheads who can understand and manage such information.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely loved the book and cant wait to read the next one. Usually don't like futuristic novels but I honestly couldn't put it down. Read the entire book in one day. Very engaging, kept my interest and really felt I got to know the characters
B007BFSYMS|5.0|What a wonderful app that works through headphones or openly.  Set your sound environment, either block out daily noise when wearing headphones because you can find a &#34;noise&#34; canceling sound, or use it openly to apply a soothing sound to fall asleep by.  It even works as an alarm clock upon selecting an appropriate noise to wake by.  Universally useful on my Kindle HD.
0316067598|5.0|Read this book right now you must for the country, it's time it's time it's time it's time it's time
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|That is what it was designed to do.  Anyone familiar with this product on their PC, knows what to expect.  I cannot give it a higher review because it just is what it is -- Adobe Reader, something most have used before.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I give this book a five. It was constantly pulling and lureing me in to read more and I found it was difficult to put it down.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Loved the movie. Two guys in the dope business (one cool and level headed, one is the enforcer) share a common thing - a single woman who is loved by both guys. She's abducted by the competition who wants in on their business and it's no holds barred to get her back.  I truly loved the ending and glad it didn't end with a &#34;Romeo and Juliet.... and Romeo&#34; spin.  Will definitely watch again!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This app is amazing I thought very hard before.I bought this app but I love the app I love to play this app all day I rate this app five stars because this app deserves five stars yeeeeeee I LOVE TOCA HAIR SALON YEEEEEEEE
B0095VP8D4|5.0|I love this processor. It's so fast and quite and the graphics is superb. For it's price it's unbeatable. Very good processor.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very impressed with this book. Many twists to the story. Never a dull moment. I would definitely recommend it. Great read
B00005JNS0|5.0|My DVD arrived within two days.  I couldn't believe it.  My grandson loves the movie.  The extra Cars 2 car was a wonderful extra.  Thank you!
B00BF123WG|1.0|Never ogt to see the movie.  ZIt kep dopwnlaoding and stopping and froze up after awhile.  Went to Netflix and had no problem<br /><br />So I never got to watch the movie and feel I was shorted out of the rental fee.
B004EPZ03E|5.0|My two year old grandson has watched this movie too many times to count.  He loves it!  He now has Chipmunk friends.
0792839749|5.0|This has always been a great movie for the whole. This is a timeless classic that is ageless because everyone will enjoy it no matter how old or young they are.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I couldn't stop playing until I reached a level I couldn't master easily. You need patience and to learn the gravity of the situations.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Kept us thinking,interesting story line.  A little too graphic around the violence aspect.  Compelling and suspenseful look forward to the next book.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|The book was a fast read. I've only done 3 fasting days but I like how I feel. I'm doing this more for health reasons than to lose weight, I want to lower some numbers and for this to become a lifestyle for me. I like that they have given suggested meals but It's easy to create meals that fit within the 500 calorie days.
B00BP4SJKI|5.0|Peter Pan is a classic.  What more need I say.  My son enjoyed it his only past exposed was Jake and the Never land Pirates.  And unlike Pinocchio Peter Pan is still appropriate, minus cigar smoking.  Overall it was fun for everyone.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best tv series I have ever watched. You will get hooked from season 1 through season 3 and be impatiently waiting for season 4 to start.
B008MEM24S|4.0|My son always wants to play &#34;Where's My Water&#34; but would need me to do it with him.  This is a good alternative for him to do by himself.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This is the first Landay book I have read. The structure of the story is excellent and keeps you reading with the developing plot.  It is a real page-turner.
B00AYDC5HY|2.0|I found this movie to be very dark and I would not recommend it for young children.  My 4 year old found it to be disturbing.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app gives you all the functionality you love from pinterest with the convenience of a solidly built mobile app.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|We loved this movie.  Once the Boogie Man showed up on the screen I got a little nervous about my 4 year old.  But the move is so magical, all the talk of wonder, and the power of believing!
B007W1BLN0|5.0|Kept thinking about it all the next few days.  Wishing he could have been saved and wonder why he didn't read his book better.
B00AIUUXHC|1.0|I liked the game but when i ordered coins and gems from them I never recieved them.  Could not get a  hold of them for help and amazon wouldn't help so I am out a lot of money with nothing to show for it
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Story line getting much better.  This season is best by far.  After getting used to all the gore, the story line has picked up and focuses more on the characters.  Love it...
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Wish my sister hadn't told me about this game.  Now I can't stop playing it at every opportunity, and anxiously waiting for the next chance.  For us highly-addictive folks, this is a keeper, so don't expect to get much done around the house!
B00BSW6F26|4.0|NOT TOO HARD. WAY TO SHORT. ONLY TOOK ME ABOUT AN HOUR. BUT AN HOUR OF FUN IS BETTER THAN NONE. I ADDED ONE STAR JUST FOR NOT HAVING HIDDEN PICTURES. THANK YOU!
B000I9U9A4|5.0|Remarkably accurate portrayal of life aboard an early 19th century British man of war.  Does not follow the book by Patrick O'brian but uses a compilation of characters and events from O'brians Jack Aubrey series.  If you like tales fromthe period when &#34;men were iron and ships were wood &#34; then you won't be disappointed.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|Big Twilight fan. Who isn't?  Had to see the extra minutes promised. Wish all that was going to be offered would be in the original releases though.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Search for Atlantas was awesome.. Then I beat it.. Craved it..<br />This hits the spot! Nicely done.<br />...No more cravings.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Liked it a lot very easy read would recommend to everyone<br /><br />Loved the happy ending  would recommend to all of my  friends
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great show if you like drama, suspense and horror. Very realistic. Great complex characters, keeps you on the edge of your seat and isn't predictable. I normally am not a scary movie or show kind of girl but this just sucked me in. One of my favorite shows.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This young woman found the strength she needed to survive through true love. I thoroughly enjoyed this read. 5 stars!
B003TTH4IU|5.0|I WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING. I LOVE THIS SERIES FROM THE FIRST EPISODE. THE CHARACTERS ARE VERY ENDEARING AND MAKE YOU CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT. IT KINDA MAKES ME WANT TO GO TO SEATTLE.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|In thid.album JT truly has a soulful soul . Im.soo.happy that he.is in love as its flourishing thru.his.music! Quadruple thumbs up!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Find some of the inconsistancies distracting.  As a West Point graduate, I have to suspend the reality of what I know while reading about the character.
B0098460O4|5.0|Saw YouTube video of Britian's Got Talent.  Bought CD.  There are several &#34;standard&#34; Italian opera pieces, but some outstanding songs I have never heard.  Charlotte's voice sounds 100% better than the YouTube video.  Jonathan has remarkable control and range.<br /><br />Well-worth the bucks!  Enjoy!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it and you will to because not only is it a fun game, but it never tares up on you. Good game and everyone needs it!.
B006RJTEIC|5.0|This is a classic... way before its time.  Great book, and really well made movie for its time.  Enjoy it...
B0018J2QB8|5.0|I said &#34;no thank you&#34; to all those who recommended I watch Dexter when it first came out on Showtime - why would I want to view a series about a serial killer. Now I know. It's awesome I can't wait to see what happens in Season 3 and beyond. Thanks for making it available, Amazon. Amazon Prime is worth every penny - and I haven't even mentioned all the other perks.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so far its fun, enjoy the realistic feel of the horses.  would love to name my horse would love tobrqid the tail
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I thought this was a very good movie.  It had a lot of action and the plot was very good.
B0000AUHPK|5.0|Even though there are several movie versions of Emily Bronte's book &#34;Wuthering Heights,&#34;  I think this version is simply wonderful.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|This is a great mini series in the tradition of Jane Austin .The character development is wonderful and make  you feel like you are a part of their lives. This is British entertainment at its best. Very engrossing  with  wit and subtle humor.
B005F9CPG8|5.0|Long overdue purchase.<br />Thought it was time to add this to my expansive Beatles collection.<br />The included booklet was fascinating trivial about the songs - thought I knew everything about the Fab Four, but there were some cool gems included.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Once I start playing it takes me hours to stop . Very nice game style, with an awesome flow.  Just wish the accessories weren't as privy
B002Q7JYPC|5.0|This is a long, over-due album by one of my favorite American bands.<br />Matured with age, the Eagles put forth a quality two-disc set that shines with some of their best vocal and instrument work.<br />Of course, seeing them live shortly after this album was released was the icing on the cake.<br />But the album is a great way to remember that live event.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Awesome!! My aunt got me started watching the series!! Love it!! I can't wait for the new series to start again!!
B0018D4SHY|5.0|You can't go wrong with Little Richard: he's a one-of-a-kind original.<br />Only someone who could have been a product of the American dream.<br />Excellent singing and songwriting.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The quality of the download on my Kindle Fire is excellent.  Audio is perfect--I don't even need the closed captions to understand what is being said.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like it better be then the first Temple Run. Graphics are better. Overall I just like the looks of the game .It seems to go at a faster pace then TEmple Run<br />.
B008XG1X18|5.0|My 15 year old daughter just had surgery.  Pintrest was great for waiting for doctors appts, diagnostic test and procedure.  It kept our minds on something fun and entertaining.  Works great on my Kindle Wildfire.
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|I startesd watching Lost about 3 months and I love them all !!!! I really love that I can watch the episodes when ever I want and 4 shows babck to back.  This show is so addictive.  Watch it from the beginning or you will get LOST lol.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this ;game.  Basically mindless entertainment.  Great for waiting at doctor's offices or any appointments.  My whole family loves it.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|I thought this was a good sappy kind of movie and would recommend it!  I always look for movies based on true stories because someone actually experienced the events in the movie.
145470246X|5.0|This lovely and well-designed book takes you through the basic supplies and techniques, and then there is a series of projects to make necklaces, chokers, bracelets, earrings, brooches, and more. I appreciated how this book focuses on how to use a variety of stitches and approaches to add a third dimensionality to your work, in order to create ornate and elegant pieces which are as dazzlingly dramatic as they are lovely. The simple color diagrams show you how to arrange your beads and stitches, and compliment the many beautiful photographs throughout the book. Some of the pieces, like the Nathalie Pendant, show you how to sort of encase a number of larger, colored beads within a lattice work of small, golden beads, which immediately suggests a style that is simultaneously Celtic, Art Nouveau, and Contemporary, for a sophisticated look with a beautiful impact.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|rented this for my grandson on a flight to Colorado.. He loved it.  He watched it 4 times in all.  I only wish my Kindle Fire had a place for a second set of hed phones,
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This was a book that was difficult to read because of the topic it covered.  It made me thankful to have grown-up in the north and to have grown up in the 20th century.  I don't understand how people can be so cruel to others.  Grissom did a great job of bringing slavery days to our attention.  In spite of the topic I needed to read to the ending.  Thought provoking!
B00APJLFEG|5.0|rented this for a return flight for my grandson. He loved this and watched it about 4 times.  I wanted to listen to it also but on a plane and only one ear plug was not going to work.  I wish my Kindle Fire had a place for a second set of plugs.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I didn't think that the kindle would be able to edit pictures to this extent. It's like a mini photoshop. I use it a lot.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|i was kind of funny but for some reason it wasn't as funny as i thought it would be, regardless good movie. i like it.
B003DXSXCI|3.0|Halting flow, Bullitt's non-answers might have been cool 45 years ago but seem rude, almost dumb today. After a buildup to perhaps the senator being the culprit the movie just ends. Actually consistent with the non-answer, audience fill in the blanks set from the beginning.
B005OI0ZYY|5.0|The details are fascinating!  And M. Poirot engages in &#34;the method&#34; in such elegant fashion as he always does.  It's a page-tuner, like all her mysteries.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|The story is well written without a lot of unneccessary filler dialouge.  The characters are intelligent and interesting and it holds my attention.  Kvothe is a great story teller.  The adventures, mythical creatures and lands lead you into a drama well worth following.  Some of the story telling has lead to life lessons for myself.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I just love all the places you go. They will all love it eveyone will like it.  When someone lose will cty
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I still want to check it out alittle closer...on my new Kindle HD!  But having The Bible anywhere you go is great no matter what.  I'll let you know more later about how well the app works.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|They loved it so much we watched it twice in 12 hours.  they are know quoting the movie.  Hero &#34;Dudee&#34;
B005LAII08|5.0|I sent this DVD to Australia to our Son,and family they enjoyed it very much and it brought back many memories to him having left Scotland 8 years ago.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|This is a great concept, but they have made it too hard in my opinion. It should be easier to collect more coins and you should get more time to get to the next checkpoint at least in the beginning. I also think it's a little too hard to control the vehicle. But it really could be a fun game similar to Temple Run if the above were true.
0452289963|5.0|this is a great read and perspective of ego and healing and realizing your core feelings and letting go of stuff you didn't know the origin from.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I love playing  Pac Man makes me remember my early days playing the big stand up machine. Telling my age now.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This is a great way to pass time with. The only reason my sister gets on my kindle fire is to play Lep's world.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I was able to save my pictures from my computer to my Kindle Fire.<br />Thank you for your help it really solved my problem.
B009CPGZFS|5.0|I have enjoyed every season of The Mentalist. I finally caught up to the present day episodes. Worth the money to buy. I hope they resolve the Red John aspect of the story.
B003O86FMW|4.0|the second book kept the pace of the first book and just a book you did not want to put down till you were done.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I enjoyed the story. Not a big fan of the overuse of the F bomb. But overall a good story.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|the final book was very slow paced until the last 25% of the book the ending was a total surprise.
B0094ZJK4O|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this album. I didn't like Sambora's second album at all, and the first album, while good, was a Bon Jovi knockoff. This slbum has its own sound, progressive engineering techniques, and is more hard rock than anything the band has done in ages. Maybe ever. This is EXACTLY what a Sambora album should be. All of the meat he brings to the boys from Jersey, and none of the sap.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|the first book really got me hooked to buy the second book immediately upon finishing.<br />the only thing that i did not like were the strange names. never did really figure out how they were pronounced.
0385536828|2.0|This novel attracted me because I am the same age as the writer and I lived in Britain during the time that the action is alleged to have taken place.  McEwan has also had a lot of publicity.  Unfortunately, the book is tawdry, and it only because I admired the dedicatee, Christopher Hitchens, that I give it a second star.  This is inbred, academic trash.  To McEwan's credit, he does entitle the book \\"Sweet Tooth\\", acknowledging with a nod and a wink that it is not to be taken seriously.  But he should simply give the book away freely, rather than cheating his audience out of their expectations of a serious novel.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was awesome it was suspenseful I could not stop reading it . This book is great for ages 10-100
B004LROUNG|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable. John Grisham draws the reader in from the beginning. Character development is brilliant. The reader is cheering for the hero from page one.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|If you need something quick and at a good price-go to Amazon. My original USB cord that came with my Kindle started to fray (from too much use)- so this works great!
B004I744AS|5.0|Found this to be a valuable app. that is easy and fun to use without the confusing steps required by some other apps.
B0096CDG0O|4.0|If only it would present next games in oldest first.  I find myself finishing games I just started quickly when we are both on line at the same time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is so realistic and make . You feel like your taking care of a real horse. I really love  this game.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Great graphics, great replay value, earn upgrades, ever changing scenary, very challenging, and all for the astounding price of nothing!
B00BF11STU|3.0|I liked it and would recommend it, but I didn't get a feel for any of the characters.  It was as if they were all robots of political or espionage machinery.  At least one character made mention of getting away from the grind of interrogation, but it was kind of off-hand throwaway comment.  He never really seemed tired or exhausted or even much annoyed by what he did - he just went at it like a machine.<br />Probably to really give it the depth the story really needed it would've needed to be a 5-hour, BBC-style, TV drama with each \\"part\\" of the story getting it's own slice of time.  I know that seemingly makes no sense given my title review, but because the characters were so 1-dimensional the pacing dragged. I think if there was more depth, then the time required to add depth would've made it longer but it would've *felt* shorter.<br />So anyways... for a pseudo-documentary/drama of the events that may or may not have happened just like portrayed, it was good.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent writing, acting and plot! Highly recommend. If you loved Season 1 and 2 you will be in for a treat with Season 3.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This is a wonderful series. I enjoyed the first book but this one was even better. The story just wouldn't slow down. Passion, desire, hate, lust, anger...you feel them all along with the characters. The roller coaster of emotions wouldn't let me put this one down.
0307887898|5.0|A must read for anyone who wants to start their own business or already has one and wants to find better ways of doing business!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I loved every page.  Great job!  I will reread this one, and pass it on for others to enjoy.  Season!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game, fun to play. This is a game I would expect to pay money for. I can play it and so can my kids.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Accdg to my son:  The game is really fun but it takes an hour for the game to open so he can start!
B0091REZMW|1.0|Doesn't regenerate You are forced to purchase to be able to get more time and features. I don't like the way that this game is played. I don't recommend it to others.
B000FCKIFU|4.0|Like all Baldacci books this one is also a great read.  Baldacci books are easy reading, they can be put down but when you get back to it at a certain point you get hooked!
B006YC74E8|4.0|This app works very well. I enjoy using the various options. I just wish that I could upload the pictures to a flash drive to be able to print them after editing. Perhaps I can and just haven't been able to find out how to do that yet. I have photoshop CS6 on my laptop. This on my Kindle Fire and am ready to edit wherever I go.
B000UZNRS2|4.0|I like Baldacci books because they are easy to read.  This book is no different.  It started slow but as the suspense builds up you can't put it down anymore.  I enjoyed it a lot.  I only read on my free time and this kind of thriller forces me to finish my books sooner, and therefore relax more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is one of the most realistic I've seen with horses. It's great! Very worthwhile even if you are not paying for it. It is just fantastic!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My son really loves the game.  He likes to play it a lot.  He says it is challenging because it requires a lot of skill, but when you get the hang of it, that is when the fun starts.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I thought this app would give me the info I needed short & sweet, instead the reporting is in metric measurement. I grew up with inches, quarts, miles per hour and degrees. This app is a waste as far as I am concerned.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|just as the title says, it works perfectly for what i need it to do, which is read pdf's allow me to fill forms and what not, much better than the stock program the device came with.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Great acting - each person demands a love or hate reaction from the viewer at some time in the series. looking forward to series four
B000022TSW|5.0|I have love south park for a long time and now I get to enjoy it everyday. It is a great quality dvd and fun for all adults.
B004I744AS|4.0|The little that I've got to try it out, only having had it two days, I know that I like it. If you had waited a while for the rating then I would have had a broader range of experience using it and therefore could have given a more focused review.
B005PK56TA|4.0|I enjoyed all of the characters and especially the housekeeper. Of course Jessica Lang played her character so well. The lady still has the right stuff.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|Bueller, Bueller, Bueller... it's a classic!  It's 80's teen rebellion but with sophistication the sophistication, charm, and warmth that only a young Mathew Broderick could deliver.
B00957T6X6|5.0|After watching Seasons 1 & 2 on JOB, I decided to finally read the books.  I just started Book 2 and can't put my Kindle away. My daughter suggested that I pace myself,  but that's not going to happen!!!!  Some time later (but not too much time) today (10/30/13),  I finished Book Five.  I want more to find out what happens to my favorite (and not-so-favorite) characters.  I love this series, both the books and the HBO TV Series!
B004H6G0TI|5.0|Most of these games lose me after a few minutes.  I found myself playing all the way through two complete levels and earning a few planes before I was ready to give it a rest.  This one is incredibly smooth and very controllable on my 17 month old Galaxy Nexus,  and the music fits very well.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Perfect way to relax my mind after hours of homework/work stress. This app sends a signal to my brain that it is sleep time.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|When love isn't enough to live for.  Is he a coward or courageous .  It was a delightful read on a terrible situation.  I would recomend this book.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Enjoyable game good time passer. Can be challenging. I have gotten quite a ways in the game with no problems or errors. Nice graphics.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|Not worth the time and cost to me. Should provide a complete list of printers for which it works in the ad and users would be happy to know ahead of time if their printer will work with this app. Ome star is too many stars for this one.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|I have listened to The Archandroid hundreds of times.  And many more to come. Waiting for next Cd to come out.
B0055S348W|1.0|Very limited. Disappointing. They should put a list of the printers that it works with in the ad so you don't waste time and money to be disappointed.
B0086HGW42|5.0|i love ed sheeran! his music is freakin awesome. this CD is really good for listening. everyone should have this CD
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I truly loved this heartfelt book about teens battling cancer.  Subject matter was deep but the author made it a most intriguing journey with the characters.  I recommend this as a must read.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Tragic, sad, and heartbreakingly funny. In some parts of the story, I laughed until I cried. Orphanages and homes for foundlings could be horrific in the 30s and 40s when this story takes place. I only hope there were some kind ones that didn't leave wounded victims strewn in their wakes.

0425263908|5.0|finished first book,, starting second, Reflected in you.... So much like Fifty shades, only better written.  After reading Fifty shaded, the similarities between the books is noticable... except the first book of fifty turned some people off.. Bared to you will not do that... Cannot wait to see how this one plays out... I recommend this trilogy highly.  Good read that grabs you from the beginning, doesn't take a couple chapters to draw you in,, it starts out good and continues that way...I'm afraid i will be done the second before the pre ordered third will get here leaving me a month or two in suspense, but i know it will be well worth the wait.. Well done Ms.Day.. You have a fan in me...  Don't know if I agree with the YOU BELONG TO ME  premise, but for the story about them its great.

159659201X|5.0|Granted, I've only read two, but I'm extrapolating that, barring randomness I'm not going to guess at, the ones I still have to read are just as brilliant and fascinating as the two I have.  Fooled By Randomness is a run-down of all the ways &#34;what are the odds?&#34; thinking can lead us astray.  Turns out the odds are far better (or worse) than we imagine.  Don't be put off by the &#34;and the Markets&#34; part of the subtitle.  Though imminently applicable to investing of the financial sort, the theory of randomness (that's statistical theory, not conspiracy theory) is equally important in our daily lives.  Without the recognition of the huge role random occurrences play in our lives, we make some very bad choices which are best served up in videos on social networking sites.  Highly recommend this book and this author.

B0099Y2YL6|5.0|We had already purchased the first two seasons of Downton Abbey because we couldn't arrange our schedules to watch when regularly scheduled on tv.  The first two seasons got us hooked so it was just natural for us to follow up with the third.  As long as this series continues at its current caliber, we will continue to purchase season after season.

B0037VNX44|2.0|If you like movies that don't make a lot of sense, Bronson is for you.  There really isn't much of a plot, and the scenes are freaky in an artsy sort of way.  I don't know how else to describe it.  Definitely not a movie I'd watch twice.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|As usual, Gregory's historical novels are wonderfully researched, intelligent and also worth reading. Although, it's better to read her novels in the correct historical order. ...
0345522478|4.0|First and foremost, I absolutely would not have picked up this book if it was not for Missie @ The Unread Reader.  I saw her review and added it to my list but like typical me, I forgot why I added it to my list.  Then came Missie's lovely read-along and Jade's (from Sort of Beautiful) review.  I decided to give it a go because I wanted to participate in the read-along (which I did in spirit).<br /><br />Atticus, a 2000 year old Druid (shh don't tell, he doesn't like people to know his age), and his pet wolfhound, Oberon, have settled in Arizona where Atticus runs an herb shop.  He soon receives word that a Celton god that has held a personal vendetta for some time is finally closing in on him.  Tired or running, Atticus decides to stand his ground and hope that his magic, connection to the earth, and his fab-tastic sword can keep him alive.  Throw in some crazy witches, a vampire, a nosy neighbor, a pack of werewolves, and a sweet old lady and we have a fantastic story.<br /><br />On the story...<br />I thoroughly enjoyed this story.  While I recognized some of the mythology, I found that the premise and mythical beings were all introduced in a refreshing and completely unique fashion.  Atticus is sarcastic and witty.  I can't leave out Oberon who made me laugh because he is the definition of a trusty side-kick.  Being dog, he was quite literal which made for some interesting moments.  I never knew what was going to happen and found myself fascinated from start to finish.  I think it is interesting that almost every supernatural being is mentioned in this book but I didn't find it overwhelming or difficult to keep up with.  I became immersed in this world.  It felt normal to have all these crazy characters introduced in one book.<br /><br />On the narrator...<br />Mr. Daniels was awesome.  I really found myself smirking and laughing out loud.  It was only through Mr. Daniels exceptional ability that I was able to fully enjoy the humor in this novel.  I don't thinkI would have been able to pronounce some of the names mentioned throughout the book so I'm glad I had a narrator to read it to me.  It made for a very fluent read/listen.<br /><br />Overall...<br />I definitely enjoyed this book and will continue the series on audio.  I'm having too much fun to give it up.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Good picture quality and good content.  It being the best picture was behind the reason for purchasing this video.  A satisfying purchase.
0385342039|5.0|Oh my gosh where do I begin?!  Lara Linton has a lot going on in her life right now.  She's starting a brand new business with a friend who took an extended vacation before showing Lara the ropes.  Lara is coming out a break-up where she finds herself wondering what went wrong and tries to fake indifference at the same time.  On top of those very real and very stressful problems, her great-aunt Sadie has returned in her young fun-loving twenty-five year-old form wanting Lara to find a beloved necklace.  Of course, Lara is the only one who can see her.  So now Lara must keep her business together, try to get back together with her her ex-boyfriend, and entertain a fun-loving and sometimes annoying ghost all at the same time.  Sadie further complicates things by wanting to do live through Lara's life.  Surely anyone would go a little insane trying to balance it all.<br /><br />On the story...<br />This story is so cute.  When I chose this audiobook, I had no idea what a fun story this would be.  Lara is a somewhat quirky character who finds herself in the most amazing scrapes.  I loved that she persevered despite being in the most embarrassing predicaments that I could ever imagine.  While she doesn't escape unscathed, I found her loyalty to Sadie to be endearing and heartwarming.  Like Lara, I found myself quite annoyed with Sadie and her antics but by the end, I was just as attached to the snooty little ghost.  This is a book where you just sit back and enjoy yourself.  You will laugh and cry and laugh again.  Everything is not wrapped in a pretty little bow at the end, but we get a pretty satisfying ending.  There is a little bit for everyone.  We have a mystery, paranormal elements, romance, and historical fun.<br /><br />On the narrator...<br />I loved Ms. Landor.  While this isn't my first audiobook by her, it was my most enjoyable.  There are so many characters in this novel but she manages to make them all distinct.  Her voice is easy to listen and sh handlesthe accents quite well.  After finishing this book, I went looking for more books narrated by her.  She does a remarkable job.<br /><br />Overall, this is the best audiobook experience I have had to date.  I recommend this book in both book and audio form.  However, I think the audio form might be preferable.  Read this if you enjoy books about friendships (and train wrecks).
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show, the acting, the characters.  Hate that Matthew died........we loved him!  Can't wait for Season 4 .... we'll be watching that one too !
044024238X|3.0|Samantha Sweeting's only life is her job as an attorney and her only ambition is to become partner.  When her dream is within her reach disaster strike and Samantha is left reeling and with few options.  Wanting to get far away from anyone who would know or recognize her, she finds her self at the door of beautiful house where she takes a job as a housekeeper.  A job which she has no actual skill which is readily apparent to everyone but her employers.  Being the perfectionist workaholic that she is, she throws herself into being the best housekeeper she can be and stumbles into a romance in the process.  But her past soon catches up with her in the most unconventional manner Samantha wants to have it all...but can she?<br /><br />On the story...<br />While not my favorite Sophie Kinsella book, I enjoyed this one all the same.  The reader has to suspend their disbelief a bit to imagine that a prominent and successful (and likely wealthy) lawyer would take a job as a housekeeper.  I mean her mistake was HUGE but I'm not sure that being a housekeeper is the next logical step.  There are fewer random plot twists that I've come to expect from Sophie Kinsella but endearing characters are present.  Let's not forget all the trouble the characters often find themselves in.  The romance is sweet though not my favorite.  It's a solid funny read for one of those days.  I'm not quite sure what I think about the ending.  I really couldn't see why her decision had to be so extreme but I would love to hear thoughts on that.  I'm a bit biased.<br /><br />On the narrator...<br />I love Rosalyn Landor and she did a fantastic job here as well.  I especially loved her voices for Samantha's snooty but lovable employers.  Her accent is right-on as usual.<br /><br />Overall...<br />If you haven't read Sophie Kinsella or listened to one of her audios, I would probably start with a different one but definitely get to this one eventually.  It was a fun read, but I couldn't help comparing itto some of the others I had read.
B004U8VX2M|5.0|This is a great show. The cast do a great job. They are able to portray their rolls to perfection. Each show you watch, makes you want to get to the next one ASAP.
0307582884|4.0|Thomas wakes up in a box and the only thing he remembers is his name.  He finds himself in a world run by teenage boys who no little more about how they got there than Thomas.  The walls close at night and mechanical monsters try to kill those caught outside the walls.  Ever day the boys hope to survive by performing jobs within their community and trying to solve the riddle of the maze right outside their doors.  They simply want to go home, wherever that is.  Though Thomas can't remember his past, some boys find him vaguely familiar.  They do not remember the details, but simply know him as a threat.  When a the only girl ever to enter the maze comes up in the box shortly after Thomas and declares that things are about to change, the boys know that they must solve the maze soon or all perish.<br /><br />On the story...<br />This is one of those stories that didn't sound like my kind of book.  I gave it a try because I running out of dystopian options on audio.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The book took a little while to get started and the writing wasn't especially exciting but the plot and characters were amazing.  The boys were well developed and I found myself attached to a few of them.  I was intrigued by the maze.  As I learned more about the boys' lives, I became even more fascinated by the entire premise.  Things are unveiled bit by bit with plenty of adventure in between.  I loved how each boy's personality showed through and I found favorites in Meinho, Newt, and Chuck.  I was so invested and wanted them to succeed.  It really drew me in.<br /><br />On the narrator...<br />Mr. Deakins did a great job.  The voices were distinct and well done.<br /><br />Overall...<br />Very intriguing story that kept me guessing from beginning to end.  Just when I thought I understood, the epilogue told me I didn't.  This is another example of a dystopian that doesn't look like the rest.  This is a different type of dystopian.
B009ICQ6KO|2.0|Read a review on Rolling Stone, They must have been listing to a different album. Gave it to the library the next day.
1250007208|4.0|Cinder is a cyborg, an outcast in a world where she is already alone.  Adopted at a young age, she is hated by her step-mother who blames her for the death and illness that has struck first her adopted father and then her step-sister.  To earn her keep Cinder works as a mechanic.  When she realizes the full extent of her step-mother's hatred, she wants nothing more than to run away.  Unfortunately it isn't an option and she is taken away to be experimented upon.  But this has major consequences.  She develops a friendship with Prince Kai, learns more about herself, and realizes the threats to earth.  She soon faces choices that test her loyalty, friendship, and love.<br /><br />On the story...<br />Cinder is a lovely retelling of Cinderella with a new futuristic story line.  the world-building in this one is fab-tastic!  It was truly my favorite part.  I could picture everything viivdly.  I also love that it took place in New Beijing instead of America.  Cinder is a feisty cypoarg (part girl and part machine) who has gone her whole life despising herself and feeling unloved.  She doesn't mope.  She plans and does the best that she can.  She isn't over the top or predictable.  Prince Kai is sweet but I'm sure there will be a lot more to learn about him so I look forward to that.  Cinder is action-packed and I was sitting on the edge of my seat the whole time. People who aren't a fan of dystopias that focus on violence and death will like this one more.  There is death (mostly because of a plague) but this one feels less violent so far.  The adventure is the search and find variety rather than the violent fighting variety.<br /><br />With all retellings I mourn a bit because I feel like I know where thing are headed.  Cinder isn't really any different.  My only negative for this one is that I knew the big reveal well before it was revealed.  I found myself impatiently waiting for it, only caring about the consequences.  I didn't get to entirely enjoy the build-up as much because I really wanted to know about that one issue.  I was revealed at the very end and then the book ended and I was a tad disappointed.<br /><br />On the narrator...<br />Ms. Soler was awesome.  Everything was perfect.  Voices were distinct and the tone was right on.  I loved when Ms. Soler did the android voices because they were slightly robotic without being over-the-top.  It made me smile every time.<br /><br />Overall,  I quite enjoyed this book and look forward to continuing this series.  I also recommend this to those who don't read dystopia because they find them too depressing.  This has a different feel to it.
B0092EE5HY|3.0|Started off real good.  I loved Haviland Tuff's quick repartee.  Slowed down a bit as it went on though. Can't wait for more of Martin's Game of Thrones books.
0440241901|5.0|The description kinds of sum it up pretty well.  When her airplane experiences major turbulence, Emma thinks she is going to die so she shares all of her secrets with a stranger on a plane.  But the stranger turns out to be the CEO of her company, Jack Harper, and she sees him again and again.  At first Emma is nervous that someone could know so much about her but she soon relaxes as his knowledge seems to be more helpful than harmful.  But just when Emma lets her guard down, disaster strikes.<br /><br />On the story...<br />This is my second Sophie Kinsella novel and audiobook and I have to admit that I'm hooked.  I'm starting to think that the description doesn't matter because you really have no idea what you are getting into.  The plot twists are unexpected and fun.  The characters are quirky and endearing.  Plus, all the fun comes from the thoughts and mishaps of Emma.  I loved Emma and her best friend, she seems like a person I would want to be friends with.  I even enjoyed her snooty flatmate.<br /><br />I'm not even a huge fan of chick-lit but I'm constantly amazed at how Ms. Kinsella thoroughly entertains.  Granted, I've actually never read one of her books, I've only listened.  I feel that I've finally found books that might be more fun to listen to than read.  The voices and accents are awesome and I truly have so much fun.<br /><br />I always say that I only listen to audiobooks when I can't read, like when I'm driving.  But with this one, I took it out of my car and listened in my room because I couldn't bare to stop listening. I laugh out loud, cover my face, and make all these crazy faces.  It's kind of like girls night but...with me and an audiobook (okay maybe that sounds sad but it is really fun...I promise!).<br /><br />On the narrator...<br />Kate Reading did a fantastic job.  I could easily discern the voices of the different characters.  She was dramatic but not over the top.  I really feel as if this was a performance and not just a reading.<br /><br />Overall...<br />This is a light and fun read where the listener gets to sit back and listen to a great performance.  Even if you aren't a fan of chick-lit, you might still give this one a chance because... I can't really imagine not liking it at all.  Oh now I'm gushing.  I hate when that happens.
B0034G4ORC|4.0|I hate to quibble over the details but in my opinion this is a sci-fi movie first and foremost and will appeal to sci-fi fans over action fans by a long shot. Sure, there is very little development of the Alien Menace being faced (hardly even a clear view of them). Sure there is a great deal of attention paid to the military aspects of the story. But the constant theme is one of battle against a unique and nearly overwhelming foe.<br /><br />In any reality based war drama there is always an underlying understanding of who will win and who is the foe. Absent is any suggestion that the end of the battle will be world annihilation. Not in this movie. There is a constant theme of terror of facing an unknown foe. There is a constant suggestion that the battle may be un-winnable.<br /><br />The attention to detail paid to the military aspect of the story is a deliberate attempt to create believe-ability and allow for suspension of disbelief. Once you believe that Aaron Eckhart is a career Marine nearing retirement and about to lead a team of un-trusting jarheads then you can accept that armored bio-aliens need Earth's water. Such is my opinion anyway.<br /><br />But to the bigger issue; why all the nasty reviews? Look I appreciate Roger Ebert's opinion more than most and read all his reviews. But if you dislike a genre, how can you ever appreciate seeing it done well. Ebert compares this film (unfavorably of course) to a Classic Western and it's sacrosanct rules of good and evil and the staging of action. What he misses is that sometimes breaking rules creates new opportunities. This movie is something new IMO. I think District 9 fits a similar bill. Independence Day comes close as well but isn't nearly as good. This is sci-fi with a military angle added for realism. I haven't seen World War Z yet but I imagine it will join this list.<br /><br />Ultimately I own this movie. I have watched it now 5 or 6 times. If you like movies that fare well on a big screen with good surround sound and the lights turned down and if you like sci-fi, give this a try.round sound and the lights turned down and if you like sci-fi, give this a try.
0061978078|4.0|Lena has made it into the Wilds but things aren't what she expected.  She expected it to be hard.  She expected it to be different.  But she expected to be with Alex.  She learns more about the Wilds and the tough life.  She wants to do her part to help those that have taken her in, but it seems that there are few she can trust.  She must decide whether she can go at it alone.<br /><br />I'm going to start with the bad.  Pandemonium switches from \\"then,\\" the time period when she first entered the Wilds, to \\"now,\\" the time period where she has returned to the society that requires the cure (though she is in a different city where no one knows her).  this format is the only downside to this book.  Because of the continuous time jump every chapter, I had a difficult time settling in Lenass head.  I could connect with her on the same level as I did in Delirium.<br /><br />That being said, the writing is still gripping and beautiful.  The plot is more fast-paced than Delirium.  Oh and the twists and turns were exciting.  There's a bit of heart breakage but I'm really starting to expect that in Dystopians.  But probably the most important part of the books is the very last word.  All you fellow cheaters out there who flip to the back to see what will happen...DON'T DO IT.  Just don't.  Luckily I didn't, but that was pure luck.<br /><br />This book ends with a cliffhanger of all cliffhangers.  I wanted to be mad.  I should have been mad, but it was  oh so exciting.  I just couldn't help myself.  Pandemonium set the stage for Requiem in the most epic way.

0385344228|2.0|Defending Jacob was a disappointment after all the buzz I had heard about it.  The characters are fairly one dimensional, especially Jacob, and not very interesting.  It becomes clear early on that Jacob is not the nice boy his parents think he is.  Of all the characters, Jacob's mother is perhaps the most appealing and her eventual breakdown is sad to watch.  One good note -- the author pretty much nails the invisible, secret world of teenagers.  It isn't until the father/lawyer starts talking with Jacob's friends, few though they are, that he gets some real insight into his son's creepy true self.

I need to listen to it more to really get to know the songs and say what my favorites are, but that is hard to say. I want to say that none of the songs stand out, but that is only because there are no weak songs on the album. It is strong through and through.

B0059R5Q08|5.0|overall i loved this movie.  i didn't really know anything about the story before i saw it, and it was 1 of those movies that stayed with me for days afterward.<br /><br />i do have some problems with this movie.  first of all i really don't like mia wasikowska.  people have talked about how talented she is but yet i find her emotionless throughout most of the film.  also i think there was a lot of interaction between mr. rochester & jane that was cut out from the film, because i still sit here and i wonder why he was so besotted with her.<br /><br />that being said, i would still recommend this movie.  i've seen clips of the other versions of jane eyre and many of them seem really cheesy.  this film is really up there with the other films based on english novels like pride prejudice, and sense and sensibility.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series keeps getting better and better. Season three saw a prison over run by biters and a small town run by a man referred to as \\" the governor\\" definitely worth watching.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|What's not to like?  This is the Broadway production and it is superb.  An enduring musical for everyone to enjoy.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have the kindle fire hd and I haven't had a problem with the app. All the news feed comes clearly, I can like posts or comment very easily, and its just user friendly in general.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|New Jack Reacher movie motivated me to start the series. Now I can picture Tom Cruise as the hero, the reading is more enjoyable.  Although I understand he is not the original depiction-he's not objectionable!
B009H5IS1W|5.0|This show is still as wonderful and realistic as Season 1. It seems to just get better and better with each passing season! Each story line of each episode keeps you wanting more and more!! Definitely worth every penny invested since we have bought all 8 Seasons!!
B005L38QHA|5.0|The previous attempt by Steel Series to make a mouse was a \\"large and in-charge\\" mountain of a mouse that I owned previously to this one.  As a regular player of World of Warcraft, I craved more buttons.  This mouse reduces the button count by 4, most likely due to the fact that the previous 15-button version had buttons that weren't even remotely feasible to use.  Maybe Shaq's fingers stretch that far, but not mine.  What we got in version 2 was a sleeker, smaller, no-cramp-your-hand mouse that still had a lot of extra buttons that tightly integrate into the Warcraft interface control panel.  It is a solid win, and I utilize every button.
B005K17RU0|1.0|The newest upgrade is horrible.  The other is version much easier to navigate.  The upgrade is confusing and difficult to navigate. The screen is very cluttered.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|The plot never fails to satisfy my craving to be the fly on the wall, and Shemar is always easy on the eyes.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I liked the characterizations of those up and downstairs.<br />I felt the character of Percy is a bit off the wall. There seems to be no reason for her disloyal behavior except that she has always been that way. She comes from nowhere.
0811875555|5.0|Just reading this book inspires me! It has so many of Glen's original drawings and really shows you just how hard they worked on this, how much effort they put into this movie and the art.<br />Really amazing C:
B009KEN87O|4.0|Great retro game, have some trouble with the graphics going wacky and displaying code on the game screen - HTC Inspire
1452101426|4.0|I really enjoyed this book! It's got some nice concepts and designs.<br />I was pretty disappointed however, since I felt like they didn't include a lot of the concept art. I would have loved to see more of Merida and the main characters sketches and drawings that led them to what we have now. I received that from many other art books so I felt this one wasn't taken to it's full potential.<br /><br />Really wonderful book however!
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|I really liked this game. I like the fact that I am not under any pressure to buy more or connect to anything else. It has a good, simple story with challenging puzzles and clear graphics. Well worth checking out.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|Lost my original DVD.  This was a 3 in 1. The digital download and cloud redemption are a plus. Very happy.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of the best book ever. I couldn't put the book down. A must read for anyone who likes to read.
B001AUKUTU|5.0|There is nothing much to say about this album besides it is a classic.  Holy Diver, Last in Line, Sacred Heart and then Dream Evil are must owns for fans of metal and Dio.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|This was one of the best 3D movie remakes out yet,it made the movie so much better,it is unbeleaveable..I would tell everyone that likes this type movie ,to get it... It's a must have..
B000002LR6|4.0|This album is worth having for any fan of aggressive music.  Came out when I was in high school and is a solid and driving album.  If you are angry or want to rage then this has it for you.  It will get the blood pumping.
B008NEMN0K|4.0|would say this is a must have,real good 3D movie,made the first movie look so much better,wife din'nt like the first but loved this one in 3D.
B005JCT4B0|5.0|What a deal I got for these.  Like 13 bucks for all 5 albums.  That is amazing.  Pantera was a brutal force that helped save metal and their sound is still relavent today.  I saw them one time thankfully before Dimebag's passing.  At the end of the show, Phil Anselmo decalred Pantera the &#34;Undisputed kings of Metal&#34; and at that time they were on tour with SLAYER but they were so tight that you couldnt argue that.  Metallica was busy making crap and Megadeth was whinning about this and that.  Get this set.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I loved babel so much that I ordered Sigh No more .  The songs are unique and the lead singer has a wonderful voice.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|get this game it will blow your mined so adicting get this game get it get it get it get it
B00992CF6W|5.0|Why do all if these other companies keep making different versions of it? The regular version is perfect and works flawlessly. Cool though skins available to purchase don't work on pocket edition. They only work on PC.
0345529057|4.0|For a mass market paperback series this set is very well put together. I do not know if others got a bad batch, but mine is good with decent binding and no missing pages. My only gripe is that there was a &#34;dent&#34; in the box caused by shipping.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking dead is a great show we are excited  to watch it every Monday as we don't have cable so we buy the episodes every week for $2
B003ODIZL6|1.0|This book we as enjoying my spirit, but as I went further..not as much. I gave the book a star. Good dictionary,but not for my age.
B009GED3HS|5.0|We Love this show! We can watch the same episodes several times over and over and still laugh out loud every time!
B004BSFC6Y|5.0|My 7 week old daughter loves these!  She smiles and interacts and wiggles like crazy with them on.  Great purchase.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Would recommend this movie to any one, any age. Very spiritual and deep with a great story line, don't pass it up.

B0089LOKHG|5.0|Title: Requiem<br />Author: Lauren Oliver<br />Rating: 5 Stars<br /><br />My Review - This has SPOILERS!  It's book three in a trilogy, peeps...<br /><br />For me, this was the perfect ending. What's funny is at first I was like, \\"I called it. This is really about Hana and her mother more than it is about boys.\\" *pats self on back*. But no, as always, Oliver is more layered than that. Somehow she took an essentially fantasy story (Dystopian, I know. But still fantastical) and injected it with a huge dose of real.<br /><br />It was real that Alex tried to let Lena move on, and that she tried as well, and that Julian will suffer in the end because they couldn't. Messy?  Yes.  But real.  Real people do these sorts of things: lie to themselves, take what they can get, hide...<br /><br />On the surface people might call this a love triangle, but I find that to be an over-used term, applied to any situation in which there might be more than one love interest for a major character.  In this case, Lena really only loved Alex.  She took comfort in Julian's love for her, but her love for Alex never wavered.<br /><br />Another dose of real?  The fact that Lena and her mother, now \\"Bee,\\" didn't just fall into each other's arms and make up.  After so long and so many scars, how could they?<br /><br />The same thing is true with Hana.  Oliver really twists your heart with the knowledge that Halena is gone forever.  That pretty moment of love, the innocent, share everything including gum, lie on your back and watch the clouds, \\"I promise we'll be best friends forever kind of love,\\" is gone.  How often are the Halenas lost forever?  How many of us set aside our childish things in favor of what is expected, acceptable, and predictable.  How much do we \\"cure\\" ourselves, stripping away the things we love until there is nothing left but data: your favorite color, favorite meal, hobbies...<br /><br />In this story there is real love, the kind that slips and slides and refuses to just sit down and stay put where we want it.  It was critical that Oliver show you real love in this story, seeing as its extremes (the agony and the ecstasy, if you will) make up the critical commentary.  Is one worth the other?  Does one give the other *more* value than it would otherwise have?<br /><br />\\"You know you can't be happy unless you're unhappy sometimes, right?\\"<br /><br />THAT is the core of this story, the heartbeat, and it's a question we ask ourselves every day.  And so I am struck, finally, by the dragnet of this story...not the surface of dystopia and cures and subterfuge, but the deeper hooks, the ones that dig into you and drag, bleeding your answers from the wounds.<br /><br />No.  I don't believe you can ever truly be happy if you're never unhappy.<br /><br />Is that such a strange concept?  I think we all agree on this, and yet, and yet, we seek heaven on Earth at every turn and curse our ill fortunes rather than feeling the balance of it all.  That's the way of it, I guess.  I rail at the injustices along with everyone else.  I can understand wanting a cure...<br /><br />She's got me thinking, as usual.  Back to the story...<br /><br />I LOVE Alex.  That doesn't mean that I don't love Julian.  Julian is lovely and delightful and one day he'll find love again; something that those of us that are older come to accept...even though that is a little tragic, too, in a way.  But I LOVE LOVE Alex.  He's exactly the right match for Lena, in the end.  And it was inevitable that they would find their way back to one another, in the end.  I was glad that Oliver gave us that.  She had, had, had to give us that.<br /><br />The Crew.  Raven and Tack, mostly, but also the others.  I loved the little crew that Lena found and helped in the Resistance.  It was all caprice that she was found by them in the first place in Pandemonium, but she was loyal and she stuck with them through the end.  I liked some of the new characters they came across, like Pippa.<br /><br/>When Oliver wrote the end of Raven's story, it had to have hurt.  Because it hurt me to read it.  She'd been so important to Lena, the missing mother that she needed.  Even though Raven was tough, she always understood when Lena was at her limits and gave her room.  Her loss was a deep blow.<br /><br />The Retribution.  I LOVED when Fred Hargrove went BOOM!  Also delightful.  It was amazing the way Oliver deftly traded out psychotic villians in each tome, with the young Fred Hargrove being introduced in this one as the most nefarious of the lot.  You get the idea that he's probably the kind of guy that has no problem hitting a woman *real* quick, but the extra layer of torturing animals and the Bluebeard story suggests full Dahmer-like sickness.  You're very, very happy when Fred Hargrove goes BOOM.<br /><br />Hana.  Given that her POV was half the story, you'd think I would have talked about her sooner.  But it's easier to talk about Hana's loss than it is to talk about Hana herself.  When I saw that Oliver chose to write from the POV of one of the cured, I was surprised.  It was a great idea, but also so challenging.  How do you write from the POV of someone with no feelings?  I have to say it was extremely well done, and even though Hana's cure wasn't \\"perfect\\" because she still felt pangs and had dreams and memories, you could tell it was dulled.<br /><br />In fact, even though she is somewhat \\"released,\\" her story makes it clear that the cured will never be free.  They will always be dulled, cut off from the others and their feelings.  It's tragic.  The walls will come down and the uncured will go back to being the messy, unpredictable, hit-or-miss creatures that they are, but the zombies will never be the same.  They will not care for their children, or spouses, or selves ever again.<br /><br />So was it a happy ending?  Yesish.  That will have to do.  Was it satisfying?  Extremely.  Have I given up thumping Oliver for not making it more sci-fi detailed for me?  Yes.  I loved it.  Go get it.  One of the best dystopian trilogies, bar none.<br /><br />BTW - Oodles of people wanted more at the end.  I understand that feeling.  I did too.  I wanted to see Lena and Alex happy together and have a big, pretty bow...but I didn't feel it.  The ending works for me./>When Oliver wrote the end of Raven's story, it had to have hurt.

B004GHNIRK|1.0|TRied this for third time....crazy that I do not get into it. So many adore it as book and as movie....no thanks for me
B00992CF6W|5.0|I want this app so bad but it cost to much and my mom wont let me get it I am sad;-(
B009FZFONO|5.0|Netflix had season 1-2. Amazon had great price on season $15+ cheaper than iTunes. I stream it right from my MacBook Air to my tv. :)
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I love sci-fi never have watched a movie that gives us direct answers to the big question why would someone do this to a race of people and why?  The story, characters, acting, scenery and special effects were brilliant but it still leave one wondering.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Always love Josh.  I like it more each time I hear it.  No familiar tunes, but his mellow voice always soothes me.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|This is not like any other series you've ever seen.  This is so uniquely and work series.  This is a thinking series and it does show what happens.  One of the best series I've see so far.
B000002GXS|5.0|They say there is no accounting for taste.  Well I just ate up Waits' performance and licking my fingers and planning to get more the next chance I get.  Wait isn't breaking any new ground here, but this is the perfecting of the menu he has been developing for a long time.  He cooks up such an honest mix of neglected word play (puns) and heart rending melodies, you sit there with your mouth open waiting for him to spoon feed you some more.  I am very satisfied with my purchase and I will be saving my dime to get some more.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Rather than waiting around to die in God's waiting room of senior living facilities back in England, these folks set out to spend their days in the mythic day so the Raj and the sun never setting on the Empire. One could spend two hours listening to this cast read the phone book, as they are all the best in the biz, but the story of dreams shattered and realized is worthwhile.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I honestly didn't expect much from this game but it surprised me, it was pretty challenging and has an interesting storyline :)
B000IKQMFO|4.0|By Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes, this is Downton Breaking Bad. Instead of the honorable, if doltish, Lord Grantham, the master of the house is murdered. A who done it with upstairs and downstairs suspects.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A little tricky to get started, but- fun-fun-fun.... makes you want to keep playing..good for building eye to hand coordination,and reaction time
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|This movie was really cute.  I rented it with my grandma and grandpa.  They liked it as much as I did.  I'm glad I talked them into renting this movie.  My grandpa said it was okay for to write this.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|When I am tired and i want to hear the word of God I turn on my kindle and put my ear phones in my ear and relax and listen to the word of God.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|This game is very fun, adictive, and I love how you can pick from a ton of planes (once they are unlocked). This app can simulate pitifuly to real live, but its a game, what can I exept? A good game I would recommend if you love this will be Dogfight
B00785P2QC|5.0|It is a really cool game you can do missions to get investment points and coins.<br />You can upgrade your buildings.
B004LWZWBU|4.0|I am a beginner birdwatcher so I made sure I would see the movie when it came out. I liked the movie but was underwhelmed with the relative little footage of birds but much wasted time on human drama, especially the marriage crisis caused by the husband not showing up at the hospital at a critical moment.  That story line felt fake.<br /><br />Anyway, I got the book after seeing the movie and the book is fantastic!  I think the best movie that could have been made of the book is probably a documentary.  Second best might be a drama.  Truth be told, this is not an easy book to adapt to the big screen.  Birds are main players and they don't act on cue.  The characters in the book are so inspiring I think a drama that highlights their ordeals and their determination would have proved a more moving experience than trying to amplify the personal rivalry among the three and poking fun at them through the process.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|i loved everything about this watch, but then its not an expensive automatic, so facing a little power reserve issue, still not able to sync date day perfectly as it changes during noon...i rate this watch really good value for money and really salute human mind who created automatic...its a cheap automatic though and behave like wises.
1476734941|5.0|I read this book all in one day and was so impressed with the amount of information and studies that I learned about.  I would definitely recommend this book to others.  I have lost a size in my jeans and also 8 lbs in three weeks due to using the information in this book!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved the book, all the characters and it was a great story.  I liked the mystery and how it all came to light in the end.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I enjoy this app. Great way to pass the time. My children like to watch and help with tasks as well.
B001FVV2X2|3.0|I went into Fringe expecting a nuanced psychological thriller, and was disappointed to find silly, gruesome, predictable plots and one-dimensional characters.  We gave up on it after a few episodes, but based on the enthusiasm that several friends had for the show, gave it another try.  Then we were hooked.  This is a show best viewed on its own terms -- it is a cross between the X-Files and Dr. Who -- and it IS  more than a bit silly.  But as the first season went by, the characters became better developed and the mythology more intriguing.  It is a great vacation for my brain after a long.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|It is a great family movie. I thoroughly in joyed it. Had popcorn  here . Didnt have to take children  out in the weather
B0045TYDNC|5.0|But, it's great to have a few spares around, so when (not if) I misplace one, I have a ready spare to grab to keep the inside of my lenses protected.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|10 movie laugh though the whole movie. It is a great family movie. So pop your popcorn grab your blankets.Watch the show.
B00BF11STU|4.0|This is an odd movie about an obsessive female nit-picking analyst searching for someone who doesn't want to be found.  She is a solitary single-minded lioness on the prowl.  Nobody would care about her or her obsession - or who she is trying to find - EXCEPT for the fact she is \\"tracking\\" Osama bin Laden, someone an entire nation wants dead.  And, the only rule of this nearly decade-long hunt is to kill or be killed.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|The contents of the show did not live up to the hype.  Its ok, but certainly not the best Bond film.
B005LAIHR2|1.0|Julianne Hough's voice is so irritating (helium balloon sucking sound)  and there is zero chemistry between her and the lead. I hate when they adapt great musicals into movies and ruin them (Rent). They need to keep the broadway performers that made the shows what they were and stop ruining them. Even Alec Baldwin is wasted in this movie.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very exciting story that keeps the reader wanting to keep reading to find out what happens.  I really enjoyed reading this book.
B007W1BLN0|4.0|I enjoyed this story a lot. Amazing that it's a true story, but I can see a young man thinking he's invincable taking on this adventure.
B000VMFDW2|4.0|The Old Breed puts you with the men fighting the war on Peleliu. It is an excellent book and should be required reading for every High School Student. We should never forget the sacrifice of the men and women of that generation.
B008Y73940|4.0|I liked this movie and thought that it was believable. The acting was very good, if there were half stars I would have given it 3.5 stars.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I just got this app but so far it works great. I like the Colorado and grafics. I'm enjoying this game. It would be good for when you have to wait such ss at the doctor's office.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|It was fascinating to follow the characters and the next generation through World War II and the Cold War that followed.  Follett is a genius at bringing history to life and showing all sides of a very complicated world.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love the challenge of planning my strategy to get through.  I find that I have to think it through before moving.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Captivating and again masterwork by Brandon Sanderson, this book kept my wife and I spellbound as we listened to it via audio on a long trip.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|I just don't enjoy this game very much.  It doesn't require much thought or planning.  It is certainly not my favorite game.
B001NFNFIK|2.0|Tommy Lee Jones plays Dave Robicheaux, a black and white, right or wrong style police detective in Louisiana. Two cases land in his lap at the same time that frustrate him for their lack of evidence. First, someone is killing and mutilating hookers. Second, remains of someone killed 40 years ago are found and Robicheaux believes they are of a black man he actually witnessed being shot when he was a teenager.<br /><br />His main suspect in the hooker murders is a mobster played by John Goodman which leads him to another man. Robicheaux knows he must be getting closer to the truth when a bullet meant for him kills a young actress his family has befriended and then someone tries to frame him for another killing. In a bizarre scene Robicheaux attends a party where someone spikes his drink with LSD leading him on a trip where he encounters a civil war general. The general appears to him several more times in the movie, seeming to try and help him with his investigations.<br /><br />In the Electric Mist does not work. The story is not very interesting to begin with, several actors (Mary Steenburgen, Peter Saarsgaard, Ned Beatty) are given few scenes and little to do. Tommy Lee isn't even acting, just being himself. John Goodman tries a little bit but seems to know the movie is a loser so why try too hard? The editing is choppy, the story does not move from scene to scene with any fluidity. The detective's investigations don't seem to lead anywhere but in the end he solves both cases. I read somewhere that a lot of editing was done post production. Maybe somewhere there's a copy of this film that's interesting and makes sense.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|If your a fan of the Jurassic park series you will like this game, my kids love the fact they can make it their way
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Very difficult to put down...This one grabs you and doesn't let go. I still have a little left to read but you won't be disappointed.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|Pretty bad. Long story short, this is like a musical version of Lord of the Rings (yes, there is a lot of singing) meets the last indian a jones movie. It's pretty horrid and puts to shame what a great set of movies came out of the LOTR trilogy. Don't waste your money.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a very good game I love it<br />It isn't hard I love it it is one of my favorite games :)
B005OCFGTO|5.0|My husband and I travel to our lake home often and this is a perfect and easy way to bring all of my favorite movies with me!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This book was sooooo good. The book could not have been written any better. The words had a way of flowing that just sucks in the reader. I recommend this book to anybody who loves to read supernatural novels.
B007GFDVEE|3.0|I am kind of dissapointed because i got the Lego set but i didn't get the mini figures!<br />I like the set but the point the mini figures didn't come with it made me a little angry.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|The movie slow on adventure at the beginning but got better later in the movie.  The internet on amazon stopped a few times durung movie which which I had to resume back to movie which lowered the tone of excitment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game I've ever played (on a tablet) but either way if you like<br />Games like temple run this is the game for you!
B004JN1CW4|4.0|It was the best book in the series!! If u like the hunger games u would defenately love this series!! I have no clue what I'm gonna read now... This book was full of action though
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! It is a really fun and it makes you feel like you are riding a real horse!
B00B5VW1SC|3.0|I really enjoyed watching the movie.  It was very easy to purchase and view the first time.  Afterwards, when I tried to play the purchased movie, I was only allowed to watch the trailer.  Not what I spent the money on.  So, I am a little disappointed and if I can not resolve the issue I will ask for a refund.
B0068LYEHA|3.0|It's great that Moran has written a feminist book that isn't too serious or difficult. I think this book can be a good introduction to feminism especially for younger readers who don't know that much about the subject. For me it didn't offer much food for thought and I thought Moran focused too much on appearance and looks. I also got tired of contant joking: you really don't need to make a joke everytime you want to make a point. However, the chapters about abortion, children and getting old made this worth reading for.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book is certainly not boring.  Kept me on the edge of my chair through the whole book.  Excellent if you enjoy suspense.
B004BBDHEK|5.0|Its Yanni,what more needs to be said.Verry well composed and orchaistrated.a great way to walk a mile in pure happiness
B005Z28M58|5.0|I loved this show when it was on and decided to by all the seasons .This  was the final season .Sad  to see it go......
B000B8QG22|5.0|I would recommend this DVD to anyone (as I already have).  I liked the casting and director.  It was a &#34;breakout&#34; for Forest Whitaker<br />and another feather in Robin Williams' cap.  Being former military, I could relate to some of the scenes.
B003Y5HWGI|5.0|If you love this show you will love this season This one has Venessa  Williams in it .She brings lots of lauhgs.
B0095P31L6|4.0|Brilliant story and very well directed! Not quite a child friendly production and it does glorify fire arms a bit...but if you look past that, it's quite well-written and nicely played out.
B001VPJYZK|5.0|I loved this season lots of funs, suspense and action .Sadly this was the last  season for Edie Britt .
B0037AGASG|5.0|This had every song that i liked on it this was the perfect bieber album i would totally recommend if u have bieber fever!
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I enjoyed the book a lot but felt when he finally came back to some of the interviewees it was hard to remember their initial story. Since you aren't connecting with a character and there are so many I had to go back and recap who they were. But it was a good book and I recommend it.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This was yet another great book by Rick he has outdone himself it was the best book of the series
B00881VLCE|4.0|There are only two things I need that would make this app perfect. Removing the snap-to-grid for unplaced pieces while keeping the snap-in-place and allowing the puzzles to have up to 750 or 900 pieces. Otherwise it's great! I also love the background music. Atta-boy to the developers on this one.
B0067R0APK|3.0|I loved this app b4 this last update. I find the hourly forecast hard to read now ( suddenly the Weather Channel free app is easier to use). It is nice to fluidly look at move than one location
B009WHDFPE|4.0|Hilarious movie. My family really enjoyed it. They especially liked Scratch making cameo appearances in the movie. Very funny movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think it's great for kids and adults. It's my favorite game ever. I like it even more because it's free.
0226039331|5.0|HST requires this for its Greek 3 students and I will be taking the class in the fall.<br /><br />I have not spent much time in BDAG yet to properly evaluate it, but it looks and sounds great and the one I purchased came in very good shape and quality.
B00BEIN9VO|5.0|Love the album!! I'm glad that vinyl versions are becoming more popular--nothing beats the sound of an actual album (as opposed to CD or digital download).  Hope he does of a tour than his summer outing with Jay-Z.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Loved it. So well written in such a creative manner. It's one of the few books that lingers long after reading the last line.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Plenty of YT downloader apps out there; this one works well and has a simple interface.  Would recommend.to others.  Installed on VZW Droid Incredible
B0052ZQMLO|3.0|Does its job well. It is an essential adjunct to the Kindle  and iPad.<br />But if you travel and have no basic knowledge of the language - no dictionary or phrase book will be of significant help.
B008J34466|5.0|I wish I had been able to see P!nk when she came to town in support of this album; it's great!! I also like the ability to download the item from Amazon as part of the purchase.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I can't put it down!  What a thriller!!  Want to read more from this author.  I highly recommend this book!
B0091CWYQ6|5.0|This is a unique product. For its price, it allows you to use any headphone and allows you to control your iPhone (volume, change tracks, answer/make calls, use SIRI, etc). Don't expect the amp to be as good as other Fiio amps (look at the price again). I'd go so far to say that if they made a more powerful e02i, say in line with the capability of an e11, I'll be first in the queue. And I told Fiio so.
B00BF11STU|3.0|I expected better. The flick starts well and ends well, but the middle is a little dry. Still not a bad movie, some great tourture scenes
B007R21JJK|5.0|I used this board on my first gaming rig i built last year. The build went very well. I used an i5 with an upgraded cooling fan. I play BF3 on ultra with this board and it is so good that i built another for a gaming rig for my grandson. This time i bought all top of the line items to include i7, GTX680, cooler master case, water cooling, etc... Another great build, no problems whatsoever. I even used a 256 SSD hard drive on this one and it flies. Not sure why a few reviewers on here have had issues but i have nothing but good luck so far. Go get you one!!!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Good game but hard can't get out of rooms but would like to do better will play till I figured it out
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|This movie was not very good. It was really about nothing. Neurotic wife, spoiled rotten dis-respective children, with no discipline and<br />just not a good movie all the way around. No real plot, messed up family, not funny and not good. I was very disappointed, actually fell<br />asleep 1/2 way through.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Missing ability to see how much precipitation has fallen in location thru the year. That would make transition from weatherbug complete.
0345803485|5.0|Loved this book!! Would defently reommend! Have to have a open mind! But is a good book! loved loved it
B0094U0RJQ|4.0|This boomer became a Dylan fan late in life with Modern Times, Time out of Mind, and Love and Theft.  Tempest seems a somewhat darker step beyond those albums, but well worth a listen.  I expect this album will grow on me as the others did.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|We picked this movie because I loved the book, thought at the very least the great actors and costumes would be enthralling. But we just hated it. Hated the movie within a movie idea (the flipping stage sets), although I can understand artistically, why someone thought this would be great. Felt nothing for the characters, didn't find the guy at all appealing (he seemed like a supreme jerk) and it didn't really seem that there were any true sparks. And that's what I remember most about the book: that longing. But we just couldn't be drawn to anyone, and the story was confusing with all that stage setting and moving of time. So we just bailed. Perhaps if we'd continued it would have improved? I'll never know.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I've tried stones, steels, ceramics and electrics, but this little inexpensive sharpener outperforms them all.  The feature for serrated knives works well and is an added bonus.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I loved the show so I just had to get the movie so I could watch it whenbever I wanted. I think everyone would enjoy watching this movie.
B002ECJZ76|5.0|I first found this movie on Netflix and had to make it one of my go-to Christmas movies. The main character, Nicholas, is adorable in his youth and inspiring in his ater years. It's a fantastic movie for young and old.
1405248378|4.0|Great for easter basket or stocking stuffers. Plenty of words and cute pics for your timmy time fan. Would buy it again
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The song of ice and fire series books are the best I've ever read. I'm actually reading them for the third time now. Just bought the kindle edition.
B000FC2NGM|5.0|Loved this book.  Would highly recommend.<br /><br />Love Agatha Christie, Miss Marple. Hercule Poirot murder mysteries.  Some of my favorite reads.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Amazing cinematographic backdrop  to an artful metaphorical tale. A spiritual tale at many levels, all interwoven with riveting action on the high seas.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I Definitely recommend this book to anyone who loves a good action and romance... Loved this book and it's plot twists and beautifully written words.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game... its very intertaining. The only thing I don't like about is that every time the theme changes the data is completely erased.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I thought this moving was thrilling.  I was sitting on the edge of my seat hoping the six embassy workers would get out of Iran safely.  Very well done.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|I am just 3 weeks into the diet and like it but don't feel I can give it 5 stars since I have not lost a pound yet.  I do like the way of eating and am hopeful that the 20 pounds that I have gained with menopause and hypothyroidism will melt away.  I plan on sticking with it because of the health benefits(i have high cholesterol also).  The book is an easy read and I like the recipes that you can make on your fasting days.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The cast is great. The writing always keeps you guessing. The plot twists last over a few shows but never leave you wondering for too long.<br /><br />Oh and there are zombies! I'm hooked.
0679805273|5.0|I love love this book. I have given it as a graduation gift to all three of my children. It is still one of our favorite books.
B00992CF6W|5.0|great. but you cant use tnt in creative mode, you  cant collect redstone yet and no ender portals, mine cars, enderman gasps and so on. but other than that its worth the money.
0345803493|5.0|E.L.James knocks it out of the park. This book is thoroughly entertaining. It is full of sex and love and a great story. You can't lay it down and you need to have the third one on hand cause you'll want to jump right into it.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game is very addicting. I can't put it down. Love this puzzles that you have to solve.<br />Well worth the money if you enjoy these kinds of games
0345803507|5.0|These books are awesome! This writer has a way of keeping you glued to the very last page and then you are left wanting more. I recommend these to anyone wanting more entertainment outside the normal same ole boring stuff.
B00AEBB8BA|5.0|Well written. Well Directed. Cast and Acting fantastic. Blue Ray just makes this movie. Great action movie. I highly recommend this movie.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This game is very fun match 3+ game! I enjoy its story line and gameplay. The graphics are good too.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Terrible &quot;upgrade &quot;  very nice app before the improvements. Background colors are gone. Too much data on the page.<br /><br />Where can I get the old version?
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This app saves me so much time! It is scary accurate and easy to use! Don't waste money on any other keyboard app! This is the only one you will ever need!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Free app is worth trying out. Can't stop playing. Wish credits and energy points were easier to acquire without having to spend real money but the game becomes so addictive you stop caring and start tearing the house apart looking for your debit card..lol.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I love this game ! It is super fun and a great way to pass time ! A must have for every tablet !
B009X2CUYA|3.0|loved her other books very much. She writes well but there is no building into the plot, frustrating, lots of pointless writing. It is a novel and not an essay. long , dull, no action. I stopped reading.<br />Sorry for a talented write
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I read the book and didn't think they could do such a good job with the movie.  I recommend it!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This was a hard movie to watch, but well worth the watch. It was not relaxing, but a powerful drama.  I like Denzel Washington as an actor in other movies, so I guessed that I would like this one. I was not disappointed in any way.
0887081770|4.0|This book was for twin boys who love the moon and it was a perfect hit. The illustration are beautiful!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I`m very impressed with this App for my Kindle Fire HD.  It gives me piece of mind that I will have all the juice I'll need for whatever my device requirement  will be.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app.  Very well done.  Easy to use.  Very nice set up and feel of the app.  I would definately suggest this to everyone that needs a basic calculator app.
B004DM0UII|4.0|This app is primarily intended to advise those who are from outside the USA that his/her home station may be available using this app.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|Excellent record.  Yes, hes one of the most fortunate musicians on the planet to have the producers, writers and musicians he has to work with as such good friends, and the entire record has their vibes throughout.  But in it all, his personal charisma and soul style shine through and truly carry the day.  The first time you hear the entire record it may not truly grab you, but after a few listens it really does.  Just like all of his past records, this one is excellent and again, seems beyond his years as well.
B006C1DH92|1.0|There's nothing to review therefore I am neutral. The game never downloaded even when I tried three times to redownload the game.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Was looking for another book, when my search happened upon this. I love books, bookstores, and it sounded interesting.Llittle did I know that the tale with involve codes, mysteries, great friendships, typography, fonts, all of interest since I work in the printing/publishing business. The involvement of computers, Google, warehouses filled with museum quality items...all made this a quick read and fun book.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|its pretty fun, i love the worm upgrade, although the zombie upgrade isnt letting me purchase it :( worth the .99 cents for sure!
B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|So good a must see. And this is coming from a guy who hates ben affleck. five stars all the way.
B002PZC8BM|5.0|Love this show, and Simon Baker. This was a great 1st season, I can't wait to watch season 2. Love all the cast!
B00BMVTS1S|4.0|I liked the Hobbit. THe bonus material was all right you can find it all online if you don't want to buy the movie.
B009PAETCG|4.0|Not much to this game but it becomes addictive nevertheless.  The object is to score goals by flicking the soccer ball at a goal.  Simple enough but at the completion of each level it becomes more difficult.  Shoot at an empty goal with targets providing additional points when hit with a goalie added in level two and defenders added with each successive level.  The angles from where the shots come get more difficult as well.  Once you start be prepared to get lost in it and forget about time.
B00BAYLQI0|4.0|I just watched a 12-year-old boy become a man. After 114 grueling minutes of calamity piled upon disaster followed by tragedy, I got a lump in my throat along with the rest of the audience as we saw a dauntless family do its best to cope with a vacation gone very, very wrong. \\"Lo imposible\\" is based on a book by María Belón which in turn was inspired by true events that occurred during the catastrophic tsunami that devastated southeast Asia in 2004.<br /><br />We follow:<br />  * Naomi Watts (\\"J. Edgar\\") is María, a physician who has suspended her career to raise a family.<br />  * Ewan McGregor (\\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\") is Henry, her husband, who has concerns about his job but most particularly whether or not he re-set the house alarm when they left for their vacation.<br />  * Tom Holland (voice:\\"The Secret World of Arrietty\\") is Lucas, a mildly rebellious tween but a good kid. Once he and his badly injured mother are stranded in the bewildering detritus of the tsunami, he is the stronger and the healthier of the two. He never hesitates.<br />  * Samuel Joslin (in his first movie role) is Thomas, the tyke charged with the responsibility to watch over his even littler brother. He is truly alarmed and his scene with his father is brilliant.<br />  * Oaklee Pendergast (\\"EastEnders\\") is Simon, the little brother who really has to pee!<br /><br />Much has been made over the myopia of Western Europeans making a movie that features a white family in the midst of a tragedy that killed over 200,000 (mostly local) people. I could argue that these locals are portrayed in the very best light: they instantly spring to the aid of any and everyone, are kind, considerate and life-saving whenever possible.<br /><br />Director Juan Antonio Bayona (\\"The Orphanage\\") has created a masterpiece that is surely the envy of directors who specialize in disaster films. The scope of this one is astonishing. I have no idea how much of it is Computer Generated Imaging, how much is fromnews clips and how much was staged, but suffice it to say, it is truly impressive. First the tsunami itself, then the ravaged land with the villagers who immediately come to help, the field hospitals that are quickly set up and the emergency care that is mobilized, are mind-boggling. All combine to make me proud that I'm a human being.<br /><br />As expected, the adults in this film are terrific, but the children are exceptional! The PG-13 rating is for the intensity of the suffering and the scope of the tsunami. A loving family is what we are there to see and we get to see it! You'll enjoy your DVD from Amazon.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|You really had to pay close attention to follow the plot, and know who players are.  It spelled out exactly what went own during the long plot to rescue our people.  I can't believe that they made it home. Ben Affleck is great.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app is accurate almost always! It's also really easy to use. I recommend it to everyone even if they already have a weather app they use :)
B006LSZECO|4.0|I have never had so many mixed feelings about leading characters in a book.  This book was VERY WELL written.  Kept me wanting to stay up late to read more of the craziness..  Totally recommend this book!
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I got hooked on Dexter and have now purchased all previous seasons. I'm just waiting for the 8th season to begin! I hope they don't terminate this series after this season.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|lots of fun. keeps me entertained. could use a faster server for friends and competitions. I wish it was easier to get diamonds.
B008YW5RH2|2.0|The game does not recognize my stricks.  This a mounts to a little cheating.  The programmer have a little work to  do.  Overall a good tennis game and intense. Get Virtual Tennis Challenge.  It is the best tennis game the is out there.  It makes Stick Tennis Child's play.
B0009MDPYM|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies
B0054LVP3Q|5.0|Wow I'm recommending this book for sure. Crazy how our mind works. She gave me chills each time she awoke to a new day
B005LAIHCM|3.0|{2.5 stars}<br /><br />HOUSE AT THE END OF THE STREET does a fine job of following the good ol' psycho-horror flick formula. Attractive and popular high school senior Elissa (Jennifer Lawrence of HUNGER GAMES fame) and her mother (very well-played by Elisabeth Shue) move into a house next door to the infamous one where the parents were murdered by their own \\"daughter,\\" Carrie Anne, three years earlier. (No one knows for sure what happened to \\"Carrie Anne\\" afterward.) Anyhoo, Jennifer enters into a forbidden friendship with Carrie Anne's older brother, Ryan, who still lives in the murder house. Though pale, strange, withdrawn Ryan is disliked and antagonized by Elissa's rowdy classmates, he seems nice and simply misunderstood at first. But wait, there's more to the story. . .<br /><br />Despite many attempts at tension and foreboding, the first hour is uneventful and difficult to get through. Nevertheless, there are some tried-and-true horror flick twists and revelations towards the end. Some violence and gore, but even the unrated version is quite tame. A modernized [[ASIN:B000TSIJWY Prom Night (Widescreen)]] or [[ASIN:B000RIWAVW Halloween]]: Nothing terribly original, but if you enjoy conventional horror, aren't too demanding, and miss the oldies but goodies from the 70s/80s, you should find HOUSE more or less worth watching. It probably won't scare you at all, but at the very least, I think you'll agree that there's nothing else fundamentally wrong with it outside of a few basic questions of plot that are left completely unanswered. But oh well. . .
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|The vast majority of this book deals with the war from the German side.  That being said I think it is worth the read.
B006Z9K97E|4.0|Must be told story from a guy who is obviously in need of speaking and being listened to....<br />These stories must lead to some sort of capitulation - HELLOOOOOOOOO! This is the 21st Century and we do as though we know nothing whilst our satellites show us clearly that a nation is operating permanent concentration camps (without the gaz chambers, admittedly ....... yet)
B0063IH60K|4.0|It works as advertised. I have used it numerous times with no problems. The only annoying feature is the ads when you start a new game.
B004PYDBVM|3.0|A good story that has been told a number of times and surely must be told - but is anything being done about it?
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Visually stunning. I really enjoyed the movie from start to finish.<br />Would definitely recommend this family movie.<br />Ang Lee did a nice job keeping the story along the lines of the book.
1451675046|2.0|This book is my first exposure to Dawkins writing; after hearing many good things about him, I am somewhat underwhelmed.  Like Dawkins, I am a biologist, and I consider myself well-versed in many other scientific subjects.  In this book Dawkins covers basic geology, cosmology, evolution, and perhaps some others that I have now forgotten.  His explanations of these topics are certainly good, but VERY BASIC.  As other reviewers have pointed out, it is not so informative beyond the level of what a high school grad should already know (this is ambitious, I have assisted in teaching college courses and know that many high school grads could potentially benefit from even the very basic science in this book).<br /><br />With that said, there are so many other sources for more in depth scientific information [read THE COSMOS by CARL SAGAN, or many others], that I can hardly see this book as anything other than a poor-mannered attempt of Dawkins to inject his own clear love of atheism into his readers.  His method is so formulaic it makes me uncomfortable: Step 1) present many basic scientific facts that are well known and well accepted.  Step 2) Introduce ideas such as \\"the universe has no conscious.\\"  Step 3) Assert that those who believe scientific facts cannot simultaneously believe that the universe can also have a higher conscious.  The message is clear \\"If you believe the science, you cannot believe in anything supernatural\\"<br /><br />I cannot explain it perfectly, but even from a non-religious standpoint this message all but kills the \\"magic\\" of science for me.  Where the heck does Dawkins believe that science came from?  The existence of a such an intricate and marvelous thing such as science is in itself supernatural; UNEXPLAINABLE.  And again (I am in no manner trying to force anyone to accept a higher power in the universe), but Dawkins HAS NOT, as he would like to believe, proven that there can be no higher power with this book, even though he tries to lead thereader to believe that he has succeeded.<br /><br />Simply stated, I don't believe this book was worth my time; if your already a scientist you will be bored by this, if you are not a scientist and have minimal scientific knowledge, there are much better sources for pure scientific knowledge that bring about a much more \\"magical\\" picture of the universe and science; and finally, if Dawkins were a true scientist he would understand that NOTHING is ever proven; there are only theories, as strong as they might be, we can never know for certain, anything.<br /><br />I hope you find this helpful.
B00275EHJG|5.0|I got this movie for my father for Christmas and we l love it. Fast delivery, great condition, many laughs as we watched it!

B001GUXJQA|5.0|I am a big fan of the Harry Bosch series, I have read them all and never have been disapointed.  I am always waiting for the new one.  I recently started to reread some of the first books in the series because it has been many years and I am forgetting some of the details. At my age  I am finding that it is all new again.<br />Michael Connelly has a way of fleshing out his characters so that you feal almost involved.
B002ZG994U|1.0|Colossally stupid, obnoxious, loud. And not in any good way. A pointless rehash of a television show about former soldiers framed and now on the run. The actors take up the roles of the gruff leader, the smooth talker, the tough guy, and the nutcase, and at least Liam Neeson should know better. Bradley Cooper, a long way from his days when he was a likeable actor in Alias, is deep into the sleazebag phase of his career with this role. Add to that over the top cheeseball stunts and a nonsensical plot that should see every single one of these people dead (is it that hard for a villain to shoot a main character?), and there's two hours I'll never get back.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|What a hero! Couldn't stop thinking about what a loss that his life was shortened so suddenly while trying to continue supporting his fellow comrades!
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Fun game but to repetative in each phase. Have played for five days and seem to get bored with the same challenge in each step. Now way to stop the timer and I like to play my games at my pace.
B00241YHMU|5.0|Great story. wonderful special effects. love watching this movie. I was happy to be able to purchase it from Amazon instant.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My daughter loves this horse game. It reminds her of the horses that she takes care of in real life. She is always begging to use the kindle to take care of the horses on the game.

B00BSBY38A|3.0|This was a LONG movie, or it seemed long anyway.  It was a good story, just a bit drawn out.  Sad in many parts, I wouldn't let a young child see it.<br /><br />Just okay.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This book and the whole series is a page turner. If you like the hunger games then you're going to love this book. I'd recommend this book to any one who likes action,little romance,drama and just enough sadness to make you tear up but you still wanna now what's next! That's why I give this book A 5 OUT OF 5 ;) I'm just sad there's not another book to look forward to;( BUT  everything GREAT must come to an end so if I were you I'd buy this book IN A HEARTBEAT!!! THAT'S why I titled THIS report ''THE BEST FREAKING BOOK!!!!!!!;);p''
B004H6G0TI|4.0|I don't know why some Kindle users are rating this so low, it works fine for me.  Takes a little practice to get used to the controls, but the game plays very well after that.  Lots of fun.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This racing game gets better and better the longer you play it. I can't wait to get all the added bonuses.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|For pure class The Lincoln Lawyer proves the merit of a committed writer and a production company willing to maintain the true feeling of the story. And it is fun. And it is fun to be surprised.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|My daughter (13) and I went to see this at the movies and loved it so I had to buy the DVD. It is so funny and has great music, so much so that I bought the soundtrack too. Even my granddaughter (5) loves it. Rebel Wilson is hilarious!!!!
B000SVZIDA|5.0|One of my most favorite movies of all time, quirky, cute and somewhat psychotic all in the same crazy mix.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|Only very recently I discovered that such an app exists too! And now it has become indispensable for me. I use it to fall asleep (which I have terrible issues with), to concentrate while I am working and increase focus while doing  yoga! It would be interesting if more sounds are added.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is cool and fun.  You get to smash little scientist guys.  You can also get nerd repellent! AWESOME!
B00005V9HH|5.0|The dvd comes with a full screen or wide-screen option. I love the ending every time I watch it. You're missing out on something if you haven't watched this movie. All for 5 dollars!
B008602KQI|4.0|It's a good movie over all a little violent when it comes to the Games part of the movie but good
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|This just wasn't my type book after i got into it.It kept repeating thoughts and not interesting,I don,t recommend it

B007HACDLK|4.0|Always a great read!! Some authors become very formulaic when they get the big contracts, however, Vince Flynn seems to find new ways to present his characters for a fun read
B009G41CG2|3.0|this mahjong ,,to me ,,is old school..the tiles are kinda hard to see,, only one layout,,  but the object of the game is good..
B00785P2QC|5.0|the best ever better than Sim city<br />addictive game but worth it<br />highly recommend to evrryone<br />download this app now
B0063GORYU|2.0|Not want I thought it would be...it places your cards where they want them; so you make no wrong moves...

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Yes I like this.  I can play this game while sitting in the living room while everyone else watche their favorite programs...
B007FROH4G|4.0|I am still reading this book and i am loving every minute of it.<br />I have friends with Alzheimers and am at the age where it is a bit scary to contemplate such an outcome.<br />The book is well written and is written with compassion and love.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It's angry birds it's the whole reason to own a tablet or a smart phone. You get addicted after one level and once you finish it you want to go back and 3 star every level. Then once you do that you will download angry birds star wars, space and so on.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I have been playing this game for 5 years and I have NOT had to pay a penny so for all of you who say you have to pay are lying. this game is the best thing that has ever happened to me. I have Soming to say to you. and here it is.  STOP LYING NOW
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Angry Birds space lives up to the original Angry Birds. I find it to be more fun and challenging. Some levels you really have to think it through if you want 3 stars. So worth it. AND IT'S FREE!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazingly good book! Well written.<br />With a topic that it is so sad it is wonderful to be able to laugh due to the authors funny intellectual writing
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun game, addicting. I do wish it would let me move to the next puzzle and return to one that I was stuck on at a leter time.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|You can't miss with this show....they are all hysterical. I had a marathon watching this disc. Keep it coming...I am ready for season 4.
B0053TMP24|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read I wish they would make movies for all the books cause they are great
B007U4DB4G|5.0|An all around fun movie that my grand daughter and I loved. It has an easy to follow plot, snappy music and of course, those adorable chihuahuas.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Great movie, but didn't mean to order 2 of this movie. I don't have anything else to say about it.
1616550414|5.0|Excellent book ! Fast shipping<br />Great service as always<br />Talk about everything zelda games , u get to really get to know the game and the history behind it !
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator app is a great size for using in class.  My students can see it clearly when we are working in a small group setting.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|I downloaded this game years ago when I first got my droid 2. Totally forgot about it until I saw it as faotd today. This game is great and definitely worth giving a try. People who rate an app 1 star because it doesn't work in their device shouldn't even review, message the dev directly, don't rate the app down for it.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|I found this game to be very fun and addictive.  Kept me entertained for hours and hours. 3 dimensional gave it a way different feel than most matching games.  I'd say this is great for kids from 2 to 108 :)
B003CFBQBW|5.0|I really enjoy listening to the CD, it's like watching the movie in your mind as you listen.  Absolutely beautiful!
B007MCTTHY|4.0|I have not finished all the levels yet.  I am still finding it challenging.  The concept of how it works is not difficult, but sometimes its hard to figure out the best way to do the puzzle.  Tip: you don't always need all the pieces offered to complete the pipes.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I can't wait to see how thy make this book into a movie. Their was a shocker waiting for you around every corner. You just couldn't believe where Gillian Flynn was taking you next, love this author.
B004PYWRQC|5.0|Well, this is one of those films in which you love it or hate it.<br /><br />In my case I love it. One of the films charms is its pacing. The film takes its time to tell a story and it is fun to watch Depp take his time as well. Also, the mood/tone of the film is compelling. I feel like I'm turing the page of a ancient book while I am watching this film. I also like the soundtrack which surrounds the film with a mysterious tone and a quirkiness all its own.<br /><br />You may find yourself filled with questions by the end of the film, but the journey to the end will entertain.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I wasn't intrigued by the movie, still haven't seen it, but I am thrilled that I was talked into reading this trilogy.  Cannot wait to read book 3!  I stayed up MANY nights unable to put this book down.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|I can't say that this book changed my way of life, because I had already decided to change long before I bought it. But it did help me with great advice on better eating and controlling my process of loosing weight in a clever/health manner.  I love the advice on having a day in the week for self indulgence in food !
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This trilogy has made me a huge fan of Colleen Hoover.  I love her character development and LOVE the romance!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game, my sis plays and I don't really have to worry about anything. I also like how you can earn Uncle Hector's black horse (5 medals away!).
B003O86FMW|5.0|I had just finished the &#34;Girl with a Dragon Tatoo&#34; series and really wanted another compelling read.  Boy did I find it in Hunger Games!  It kept me up at night, loved the characters, loved the plot twists, and can't wait o see what they do with the next movie!  Super enjoyable suspenseful fantasy trilogy!
B00BSBXA98|3.0|Very beautiful and colorful.  Would have made a great short but way too long; too repetitive for a full length feature.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I hadn't read a lot of Stephen King books, but now I will. Loved this one, loved the central character and loved being challenged to think about the &#34;what if&#34; of history. As soon as I finished the book I researched what King did in order to write this novel and was blown away by the enormous amount of research King put in order to make every moment of his tale so accurate and compelling.
B00BF11STU|2.0|I'm not sure how you can turn the most fascinating story of the last decade in to a total snooze fest, but congrats Kathryn Bigelow! I tried to watch this twice, but never made it past the 45 minute mark. It is totally boring. Cray, right? This film could've been amazing.  I think I'll just FF to the end and watch the attack on the compound b/c it is just way too tedious to sit through.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I haven't bought myself to see the movie, fearing it won't be as good as the book.  I loved the characters in the boom and held my breath as the story took it's plot twists. Could there really be a happy ending to this story?  Would her past find her and destroy her chances of a happy normal life?  And if her abusive ex found her, what would happen?  Would he drag her back, kill her so no one else could have her, or kill the new man in her life?  I love the suspense of it all?
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|There needs to be some more comedy in this show. It is way too serious and dramatic. Great show otherwise.
B0037B6QSY|5.0|Jon Kabat-Zinn changed the way I look at life with this book. It taught me that I don't have to react to everything in life, that how I CHOOSE to react can determine my future.  I remember when I was a child my mom always to.d me to &#34;look at life though rose colored glasses&#34;.  She was an eternal optimist.  Jon Kabat-Zinn takes my moms simple concept to a whole new level.  You will be a better person for reading this book.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This show is intense, action filled, amazing and shocking plot twists. Excellent cast. I really like the idea and igenuity put into this show.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this trilogy.  The author paints such amazing pictures with his words that you feel you are in that city, and its not difficult to imagine what the characters look like and how the action is unfolding.  The books in this series kept me up night after night.  Highly recommend.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|if you do multiplayer I recommend Asia because they have the best people but when I got a game to get 10 gul coins I did not get it and also I luv pie!!!!!!!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I gave it four stars instead of five only because the ending was quite abrupt, in my humble opinion. Otherwise, a great read, and well worth the purchase. Well written, interesting, and different for a US reader reading about something from Ireland, but it could have been written with any background, probably. Really enjoyed it!
B002PL8SWY|2.0|It appears damage for all sets occurred before shipping as the outer shipping boxes were always clean. Most of the vinyls(9 in all that I inspected) were mildly to majorly flawed as to visual inspection, I.e.,, sloppy labels, loose vinyl shavings in spindles and rough outer edges. 3 of the LP had light scuffs,abrasions. I don't know about the actual sound of the LP, as I don't have a working turntable. The cd I listened to had to be cranked to 100% volume on my car stereo and still was not adequately loud, and slight distortion. If you can find one in good shape might still be a worthy collectible. The book with photos and fascinating commentary on the 1969 tour and the concerts was great. Also, included in book is entertaining account of these specific shows, how MSG tried to high jack show by not signing proper contracts and Stones road manager holding firm. Also Janis JOPLIN NOT TOo happy about being barred from back stage.. Might be 4 stars, but I'm done with damaged products.<br />AMAZON is at least always cooperative in returns, so it gets 2 stars for tthat and the book.
B000654YRY|5.0|One of the best concerts on film from Dire Straits - Fidelity is awesome - I saw them in Toronto - it was this tour and one of the greatest concerts ever attended - TURN IT UP - ENJOY
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|Simply put I love it. I just wished there were more season. NBC should have kept it going. Why deny fans of what they wanted
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Regardless of how many times I see this movie, I still laugh my ass off and can't get enough of it!
B004ZGI2KK|5.0|Summit always makes the best movies for females anyways. Much like the Twilight saga very dark so somewhat daring appeal to it. Female in distress and two handsome men to protect her. Oh and happy ending! Cannot stand watching the whole movie to find out it has a sad or bad ending, leaves a bad taste it your mouth. All of the cast were very good, overall great movie.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I thought Gone Girl started out well but fizzled out somewhere about 75% through the book. Still pretty entertaining though.
B000IDEORY|5.0|Will always be one of my favs. Patrick Swayze was great in everything he starred in and Jennifer really made the movie so believable. Who didn't want to be Baby back then? lol
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|awesome game except no exit button on kindle. you should fix it so yah thanks sweet right on that's nice yay twenty words
B0013TTLDE|4.0|I recently read The Secret Keeper by Kate Morton. I was so impressed that I wanted to read more of her work. This was full of twists and unexpected turns. I enjoyed it and look forward to reading more of her books. I enjoy the historical settings of her writing.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|It's a battery charging information thingy and that what it does I can see how long I can read or web search act so great
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Whenever I'm not doing anything I sit down and play this game. The graphics are great. No game could be better. I recommend you play this game. You will hear nothing but good about this game.<br /><br />Play this game and see what I mean!!
B009YX02T8|3.0|Compared to the other Twilight soundtracks this one is not the best, but for movies that aren't very good the soundtracks have been pretty good. This one may not be as good as say the first one, but is still good.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Cross fire series is a must read.  If you liked Fifity Shades you will love this series.  I actually liked thus one more.
B003YV64OI|3.0|This CPU is adequate for everyday demands, multi-media chores and moderate gaming ( or for a replacement ). The included heatsink and fan, I have to say, are both utterly useless though and included solely out of necessity, so you'll need to supply those upgrades separately. If you're upgrading or doing a DIY rig, spend your money on more power.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Easy to see and use, availability at my finger tips.<br />Color scheme of the purchase is pleasant to look at.
B0099G4Y26|4.0|Great music from beginning to end.  Her best album to date.  Multiple number 1 song possibilities on what haven't been released yet
006079383X|4.0|Great book but the concepts are too old. Also the Audio is definitely not 3hr/3CD as the cover says. It's much shorted than that.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|at first itsnhard to learn to control. but once you get into the game and learn how to use them this game is amazing. the graphics are pretty sweet too. a must have if you like flight simulation and being able to take down other aircraft. even if you've never tried a game like this you should. this is my first flight game. I normally don't play these games but once I tried it I was hooked.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|This was my first Amazon movie watched over the Internet. I was happy with the viewing quality. I will continue to watch movies on Amazon.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing and kept me in suspence the whole time<br />At the end I was absolutely in tears because I couldn't stand to see them be apart

B00AREIAI8|5.0|the only problem I have is that it does not always load when I want it to. other then that I love playing the hires game.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|If you have never seen this, where have you been?  This is one of the all time classic teen movies.  Farris and his friends take the day off to live life rather than waste away in school.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|Still the best Christmas story ever written. My kids like it as a read aloud, and I like it too.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS IS SIMPLY WONDERFUL. I ENJOY TRYING TO BEAT MY LOWEST SCORE JUST TO GET THREE STARS. THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO STAY BUSY WHEN TRAVELING WITH CHILDREN. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CREATING THIS APP I LOVE IT SO MUCH.<br />Karen Smith ( sister.karen@yahoo.com)
0374531269|2.0|A book about the author's time as a child soldier in the Sierra Leone army during the time of the war.  He describes the atrocities of war, from the viewpoint of a victim, as well as a soldier.  Some details are chilling and horrifying.  The book is written simplistically and is a quick read.  At the end he escapes to NYC- but how he does so is not explained- that would have made the book alot better.  Although I am more \\"educated\\" after reading this book, I did find it very disturbing. The descriptions of cruelty, torture and pain are pretty graphic and gruesome.  Read it if you care about history, or if you support these types of humanitarian causes.
B00BMVTTJ4|5.0|The movie started out great and gave a great intro into tying it to the LOTR.  The entire movie was filled with mystery and hobbitty-quirks that had Tolkein and Peter Jackson all over it.  Can't wait for the next movie.  Hurry!  Please!
B004H6G0TI|4.0|MiniSquadron has great HD Graphics (better than the sample clips).  The Controls are an ON-Screen Joystick and s Fire Button that work very well once you get used to them.  You get to choose from many different cool Planes after you play awhile and they all have different specifications like Weight,  Speed, Weapons, etc.  They can STALL like real planes and recover if you pull up in time properly.<br />Game play is lots of Fun and has Realistic feel to it.  Blue arrows tell you when and where OFF-Screen enemies are approaching so you can get ready for them.  Messages pop up when you are starting to Stall or when you fly TOO LOW so it helps you to attempt recovery before you crash.<br /><br />Graphics are high quality HD and the Music and Sound Effects are very good.  Sound levels can be adjusted from Options Menu.  Controls are easy to learn and work Smoothly on my Tablet.<br />Lots of Power-Ups (like Stars and Hearts) can be acquired by catching them in flight.<br />Information Bar on top of screen tells you how many Lives you have left, Enemies left, etc.<br />It is fast paced but not a FRANTIC level from what I have seen so far.  Very simple and ENJOYABLE.<br /><br />Seems like a well designed game with no obvious flaws or annoyances that I have seen.  The only thing I would like to see different is an OPTION TO REVERSE CONTROLS from left to right Joystick so people (like myself) with hand disabilities or weaknesses in dexterity can compensate by swapping.<br /><br />It is very Enjoyable, Challenging, Entertaining and Fun to engage the other Aircraft in Combat.  I like this app and would Recommend it to anyone who likes this type of game.  It is a Keeper.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book was recommended to me by several people. I could not wait to read it. The entire book was slow. It took me weeks to read this book and it should have taken me several days. I am giving this two stars because the story line was different but I could not stand the characters.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the best show on TV. Can't seem to get enough of it, I have gotten everyone in my family watching it now and they can't wait for the next show to air.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|jim parsons and kaley couco are the new laurel and hardy knock knock knock penny will go down as a telivison legend also howard aka simon should get his own show he just that good  BANG!
B005HJWWW8|5.0|As with any speaker, under-powering produces more distortion and cause more speaker damage than powering them properly. The same is true for headphones, especially large circumaural headphones. This amp is not just for those who like it loud (like myself) but for anyone who wants a cleaner more accurate reproduction of their music. I've already purchased a second one for my brothers upcoming bday. He's gonna love it, and so will you.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|we needed a new super hero after smallville was eaken off the air characters are great green arrows blond side kick is awsome diggle is great i love the way he keeps going back to the island it breaks up the scens well
B00BPLDCVM|4.0|This album features several of the terrific and moody songs that are played at the end of the episodes of this terrific and moody show.  The track listing is only 8 songs, which is meager I think, but the songs are good.  The theme song from the show on this album is a remix, not the pure form featured in the episodes.  However this is a soundtrack album, not a score, so the folks who are disappointed that there isn't more, or any, representation of the original score, are simply suffering from misplaced expectations.  Overall a decent album featuring several solid songs - mostly I just wish they had put more songs on the album!
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Since it is a pretty famous movie, I do not have to say anything. Good quality and buffered without any delays or erros
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Easy to learn, great for co-op or 1vs1 :)<br />I just hope they have more hard designed level for serious challengers
B009VMN3RA|4.0|I think the book was written from the heart, interesting to learn about the strange relationships in that so called family.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The show is great and the seasons just get better and better. Can't wait for the next one to come out.
B007FFL45S|5.0|Loved the book - helps give a positive feeling - if I try hard enough I'm sure it will work!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|How do you even review this book without giving away the premise or story.  All I can say is that it is set in 1898 to 1904 and is a wonderful fantasy that weaves its way to a not unexpected ending.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|A great story and movie.  At first you think that there is no way I can watch an entire movie with nothing but singing, but give it a few minutes and you are drawn into the  characters, and emotions of the story.  I think it is well done and gives you a  real feeling of what is happening since the actors actually sing their parts live as filmed, and their true emotions come thru with the character.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I've seen the movie and the play, but never read the book. The book is wonderful! A classic read for young and old.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|An easy read with a great idea that seems to work so far.  Not hard to stay with if you are serious about changing your weight or health. Lost 6 lbs. the first week.<br /><br />It has been 4 months now, and I have not gained any weight.  I hit a plateau at one point, but the weight still is coming off.  I have lost about 15 lbs at this point.  I am sure I could loose quicker, but I do eat whatever I feel like on my non-fast days.  Sometimes I am better than others on those anything days.  Will continue with this \\"life-style\\", as it does work.  I do not work-out during the week, but I do take my dogs for a walk a couple times a day.  I also like that I can switch my fast days to fit my schedule, but always try and do 2 days a week.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|love the turns and twist. in true cornwell style. keeps u wondering what is next. tk u patricia cornwell. great
B007V65R54|5.0|Excellent balance of statistics theory and everyday (but vitally important, in some cases) application.  Will make everyone who reads it a little bit smarter, and that can't be bad!
B000001ES9|5.0|Good Canadian rock & roll to jam to.  Rush always puts out the best lines & lyrics of any artist.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy playing it when I want to get away from reading and do something quick. The games go by quickly and it is fun
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|It is awesome app because it as people,sharks and fish you have to play the game and it's better than my odd app because my odd app stinks.
B004SBS8LA|2.0|I do not like there are no instructions,  I am stuck on two levels and can't get past them I do not know what I am doing wrong
B0085TKAW6|5.0|Gave a wonderful insight into the lives of people of those times. I would recommend it to anyone as a
B00B1OWEVC|4.0|I remember learning in a college humanities class far too many years ago that much of our 20th century art (and much of our 21st century art too, I would presume) is about the process, not the object being represented. So when Jackson Pollock dripped on a canvas, he wasn't trying to capture the world and depict it in any meaningful way - instead, he was teaching us something about the process of painting itself, about what it means to create in the first place. I wonder if &#34;Welcome Oblivion&#34; isn't doing the same thing to a certain degree. What I hear are two souls - Reznor's and Maandiq's&#34; - working out two very different views of the world in these songs. I realize I'm shamelessly generalizing here, but Reznor's vision of life and living as channeled through NIN has been, more than anything else, angry. So what happens when that fundamental rage comes in musical contact with a view of the world that is much more hopeful? &#34;Oblivion&#34; documents that clash - and its ultimate resolution.<br /><br />The album opens by immersing the listener in a fever dream - a bleak, nearly featureless landscape with precious few landmarks or way signs. Somewhere over the course of the first several songs, that backdrop discovers sunshine. Sure, the lyrics are trite, almost childish in their simplicity - but can you imagine this lush, sunny voice singing anything else? Eventually over the course of the album, though, the sun sets (as the sun always does), and Reznor's wind-scarred world once again claims center stage. By the time &#34;The Loop Closes,&#34; (not coincidentally, the most NIN-reminiscent song on the entire disk), Maandiq is nowhere to be found - she's fully resigned herself by this point to Reznor's bleak, bleak vision of the world as &#34;oblivion.&#34; Interesting That as &#34;Hallowed Ground&#34; brings the adventure to a close, something like a melody keeps trying to assert itself, but the effort ultimately fails. Reznor's more insistent musical vision has asserted itself once and for all.<br /><br />Yes, I know there are other creative voices involved, but this album is about Reznor and Maandiq, about working out vastly different ways of seeing and being in a relationship - and we are the lucky beneficiaries of this peek into art not having been made, but art BEING made.<br /><br />Not sure how many more spins I'll give this one from here - this is really demanding stuff, and as others have more eloquently noted, individual tracks from the album don't stand up well on their own - all about the journey, I suppose. But for those who like their music to make them think as well as feel, &#34;Oblivion&#34; comes highly, highly recommended.

B00870Z05U|4.0|A really sad, but how else could it end. Most of the music was exceptional of course.<br />I didn't really appreciate the Coney Island music and scenes as much, but I am more<br />hooked on the haunting music of Phantom... But the rest of the scenes and music<br />touched my heart deeply as well as the boy being the his son. I am a very big Andrew<br />Lloyd Webber fan. So should really say 5 stars
B006R8GK2Q|2.0|I really enjoy hidden objects games.  However the screen area on my KIndle is not has large as a computer screen so the objects were very difficult to see.  Also, some portions of the game only showed an outline of the object which made it even harder.  I think I might like this game if I were playing on a computer with a larger screen.
B00BGD07KS|5.0|While watching/ listening to the ending credits of the movie I heard this song and loved it! Great lyrics, great music!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this app is so fun and its super addicting ! one of the sord of sucky things is tht the shark sometimes goes super slow but besides tht its awesome!?
B00932A4XE|4.0|Great movie to watch when your pregnant. You will be able to relate to at least one of the woman.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great movie. Maybe not exactly accurate, but well worth my two hours of entertainment for the night. Thank you Argo.
B007V508CC|5.0|Maroon 5 has a lot of lovely songs on this cd, my favorites are One More Night, Payphone, Daylight and Lucky Strike! Love the CD HIGHLY recommended!
B008GXHOFW|1.0|My son bought this app for his kindle. We couldn't download the extra software to get it to work on the kindle due to network error.  Our network was working fine.  We tried several attempts before giving up.<br /><br />On a separate note there doesn't appear to be a process for getting a refund on app purchases.
B000F9RB8K|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time! I love the script and every time I watch it I start to cry. Lovely movie and highly recommended to people that love family movies and a combination of love, adventure and brothers!
B00005TQKQ|5.0|I recently purchased this head cleaner because I was receiving only static when trying to play my 8 mm cassettes.  No picture whatsoever.  I popped the cassette cleaner in, followed the instructions, and to my surprise, my picture returned, and my camera is working great again.  A GREAT product, at an equally GREAT price.  I couldn't be more satisfied.
B0095WNNK8|5.0|Love these songs a lot and thats the reason why I bought it. Also a bonus that it includes bonus tracks and is limited!
B000UU4NE4|4.0|I would have to say this was ok, but kind of stale after 1 and 2, this seems to be the problem with sequals.

B0036UMM84|5.0|What can you say about a love story that is centered on two great actors and surrounded by wonderful music? This is one of my all time favorte movies.

0893860468|5.0|In writing this short review I want to state up front that I am a dedicated Christian with all of the theological implications that term implies. Reading a work that offers insights into the spirituality of a different cultural world-view can be challenging; it's easy to dismiss such material as anti-christian or pantheistic. Especially when one notes that Eastern (primarily Indian) religions often speak of transcending religion -even God, as deity.<br />At face value, it seems that this work does just that.<br />Yet, I had to probe deeper. And I'm glad I did. The discourses held in this work are treasures to be sifted thru and examined closely. The more I did that, the more I found nothing to really disagree with the mystical theology of my religion. Indeed this book is not about theology. It is about dropping labels and learning how to Be.<br />I loved what I found here. I've underlined numerous passages and creased as many pages. I will be studying this book for a long time, I'm sure of that.<br />Here's my bottom line: As as a thinking Christian, my three most beloved books are: The Bible, The Triads, by Gregory Palamas, and I Am That.<br />It is just that amazing. Challenging. And transportive. To find out what that last word implies, read it for yourself.<br />An added note:<br />When I read the reviews for Amazon books, I often scroll down to the one-star reviews first, to see what problems might exist in the material. To be honest, I was surprised to see that there were quite a few of these for I Am That. But look at those yourself and you might notice the poor grammar and weak arguments that readily accompany a shallow reading style. This book is not for everyone, I suppose. Just for those who are ready for the breadth of its content.
B000CNEO1G|5.0|I have been ripping through and comparing a lot of classical music recently. And for some reason I have been focusing on trumpet pieces. The Marsalis version of the Brandenburg second has me obsessed. And everywhere you go is Miss Balsom. I wondered, could this beauty really play. Well, good Lord, I can see why she has groupies. These Bach pieces are enough to make one seek a live concert. Seriously, this human has chops. The suite is enough to make this disc worth the Amazon mp3 price. I don't see where it is available in vinyl or I would buy my audiophile friend a copy too.<br /><br />Get it. Listen to it. It is one of the finest things I have put in my ears this week.
B001GWK2MC|2.0|We owned the same caste before because I really liked the high sides and price so we ordered it again because the first one got a hole in the seam.  But after the first use, the second castle got a big hole.  Kids were bummed.
B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|i was excited to try this new method of losing weight.  it sounded like something i could do and i really liked how 5 days i could eat normally.  well the first week seemed tolerable, although the fast days were a little hard on me.  i had to send my family out to eat for dinner because it was too tempting for me to break the fast.  i sat home with a big bowl of lettuce and a little roast chicken and felt sorry for myself!  on my normal days i ate normally... pretty healthy i must say.  i start each morning with a kale smoothie and then if i get hungry before lunch i munch of unsalted nuts.  at lunch i usually have a sandwich made with low-calorie wheat bread and then for dinner i will have something healthy.  my only downfall may be late in the evening i might have a few chips... but no sugar type foods.<br /><br />week two seemed a little harder for some reason but i made it through.  week three was harder still and one night for dinner i just broke down when my daughter brought home some yummy hot dogs!  i had to have one!<br /><br />this is the start of week 4 and i am not looking forward to tomorrow ... my first fast day of the week, but i'll do it!<br /><br />what makes this harder still is the fact that i haven't lost a pound!  although i've been busy and do walk my dogs daily... sometimes for 2 miles, i haven't really seen any difference.<br /><br />i'll try to stay on it for a while but if i don't see any weight change then what the heck?
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob was full of twists and turns and was impossible to guess the final outcome.  If you like court and trial stories like I do,you will love it. It drew you in and was a page turner.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love that Amazon has this app available for non-Kindle devices.  I love Amazon and its many services and features, and it's great to be able to download reading material to my various devices via this application.  When my kids need to get books for required school reading, I just download them via Kindle for Android so they can read them on their phones, my phone, or my Android-based tablet.  It's a fantastic app to have and I'll continue to download it on every Android device we get!
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|I have read several of his books. While I find them intriguing, I feel they have become a little predictable. Each book is a riveting tale of true love, that leaves wishes we could experience a love like it.
B006UKFFE0|4.0|Ash takes a lot for the core principles laid out Reis's work [[ASIN:0307887898 The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses]] and presents a very practical implementation story. Especially helpful are the checklists and case studies from his own experiences.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good random shuffle of cards. A relaxing way to spend a few solitary minutes after a hectic day, a most enjoyable game.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Considerable hiss, but still better than the cheapy wireless systems.  Get a foam card - about 12 inches by 4.  Cut out a segement from each end to use as a cord wrap (think electricians extension cables).  Otherwise it'll become a tangled mess.  Write on the Card:  TURN OFF!  You'll eat up batteries otherwise.  Really very good considering the price.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this game is awesome! it gets challenging at some point and frustrating, but I guess that's the whole point of the game. anyways I just love this game.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|This is a great game.  The story line is good, the music is soothing, and the game gets more challenging with each level.
B007IK44CK|4.0|At my leisure time, I usually pick up a film to watch. Amazon.com gave me the free of watch! This film is thrilling, stimulation, and attractive to adults.
B00B1E6FF8|2.0|I may be wrong but I think the same person who made the \\"Hurt Locker\\" produced this film and it shows.  It's one of those films where one thinks it's going to be an excellent film (certainly the story is compelling) but in the end, it's just... boring.  Just plain boring.  Because of the length of time this film encompasses and the complexity of the story, I'm certain that a book is the medium for which to tell this story.  All in all, it's worthwhile to watch the film once, but only as a rental.
B005C0DHEY|1.0|If you want to hear the latest Environmental Disaster Fantasy, this film is for you. If you want to see the truth about Fracking, and understand just how pathetic is Josh Fox's film \\"Gasland\\", you should see \\"FrackNation\\" by Phelim McAleer.<br /><br />Fox refuses to answer specific questions about his film, such as why he neglected to point out that the \\"burning water\\" in Dimock PA was a natural occurrence that had been present since before the technology known as \\"Fracking\\" was first invented. Such as why the one family in Dimock who demonstrated the burning water is now completely unable to draw water out of their wells that looks anything like the water he showed in his film. Such as what the EPA scientists had to say about that family's wells and the water therein. Fox claims that fracking is akin to earthquakes, and suggests that fracking could cause one. Except McAleer interviews the nation's expert seismologist who states that Fox is completely wrong. The Texas mayor who makes claims about the damages caused by fracking is refuted by Texas' own environmental protection agency, second in size only to the Federal EPA, which demonstrates that the water in the mayor's district is cleaner than it ever has been.<br /><br />One of the first sequences in Fox's film is of his attempts to ask questions of Halliburton; McAleer cleverly parallels that with his own similar, and similarly resulting, attempts to ask questions of Fox. Apparently, Fox is happy to express his fact-starved opinions in camera - where the audience cannot make him feel like an idiot - instead of live.<br /><br />The \\"Lease Agreement\\" that Fox shows as evidence of something mailed to him to lease his property - was a redacted draft lease that had nothing to do with him, and was never sent to him.<br /><br />The Russians, led by Vladimir Putin, are weighing in against fracking, because the Russian natural gas company Gazprom - partly owned by Vladimir Putin - is dead-set against letting Poland, Ukraine, and other European countries enjoy the benefits of fracking their own natural gas, and the benefits of not having to pay the Russians. Imagine that - a corporation funding environmental activists to prevent the corporation's profits from declining. Does Mr Fox point out this conflict of interests? Not in his film. Does Mr Fox point out that Russia has used its delivery of natural gas as a weapon by reducing shipments during the winter, in order to force Ukraine to toe Russia's political line? Not in his film.<br /><br />Gasland is a propaganda film, and Mr Fox demonstrates he has learned a lot about Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia.
B008NNNF7G|5.0|I bought this CD for my husband, and want to take it back.  :)  We have listened to it over and over, these guys are great Musicians, love their songs!  Can't wait to hear more from them... LOVE IT!
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Gorgeous graphics, addictive play.  I fell in love with this game when Big Fish put it out for beta testing.  Happy when it came out for the computer, ecstatic now to play it on my kindle!
B007MB5OCE|3.0|This was  fun to read. Fantastic, and  eye-rolling unbelievable situations, but It is  not made to be believable. Its sooocorney, that its  a blast. Great escapist fiction, but It kept me reading just to see &#34;What next&#34; - even though i knew what would be coming next would be outlandish
B004U8VX2M|5.0|This period series was a favorite when it first came out. I am thrilled to be able to see it again. Love seeing history unfold through the eyes of this household
B0087ITBT8|5.0|I didn see this movie in the theatre, but I love Barbra. I am glad this movie comes with the digital copy, that way Ill have it in my house and on my computer. I will now make sure I always buy the movie that provides a digital copy.<br />Ive seen many reviews and none of them are bad so Im sure Ill love it.<br />When I get the movie after the end of april I will addd to this rating.<br /> Yes I watched it yesterday and yes indeed I love it. Barbra was funny  and the chemistry between she and Seth was perfect. They got along they had words and they found out they love each other. I wish my mom could have seen this one.<br />Make a second one on that trip to Europe you talked about.
B000FC1HQY|4.0|Just back from Botswana, I was interested in how someone's childhood would be in the area.  Fuller's book was eye-opening. Her life was unpleasant and most would consider deprived--yet she captured the joy of youth and that sense of children for whom what is, is normal.  Her enthusiasm and determination to live in the moment to the fullest gives the reader a take-away value far beyond the descriptions of a hard-scrabble life.  And look at her now!
B001AEF6BI|5.0|Nothing wrong whatsoever. Still in the wrapping, fast delivery, excellent service. EXACTLY as described!! Thank you!! And of course, the  movie is a hit with everyone too!
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|While I enjoyed the book, This movie struggled to keep my interests. I wouldn't think of watching again. I was bored and ended up napping through most of it.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|ok this game is Awesome!!!I played it all the way to San Antiono!!!BUT ...it sometimes wouldnt work when I pull the controls otherwise.........AWSOME!!!!!!!'
B007HACDLK|4.0|Like all his other Mitch Rapp books exciting and difficult to put down. The book is very timely and the character is an up to date modern version of James Bond. I hope one day someone decides to make a movie series. His character is more real and appealing to Americans than Bond. Matt Damon would be perfect for the role.
B0029ZA49Q|5.0|I've been using this strap for 6 recent backcountry ski tours where weight, balance, stability and function means a lot to me. I carry about 25 lbs of backcountry equipment and supplies and carrying my 5d mkii and 24-70 mkii with this chest strap works great. I shoot on every trip (my photo site trucallenmedia dot com).<br /><br />As for fit and performance: The slim and simple design means I don't notice the straps between my back and pack. I've recently found that by flipping the strap system upside down (literally, back logo upside down and attach the plastic buckles on the upper d-rings of the toploader and the metal thumb release clips on the bottom d-rings) it fits like I want it too. I'm 5'7\\"ish and found that the top sagged a bit the buckles bottomed out quick. By flipping it, you now have so much more adjustability with the top straps - which is where the problem was - it was driving me a little crazy.<br /><br />It's light, simple and does exactly what I want.
B00AV68GOA|5.0|In thought it was very interesting to read Julian Fellowes background information.  Be sure to read them comments along with the script.  I read the Kindle edition and did not realize that I could click on the little blue icon included in the scipt and go to the comment that had to do with that portion of the script.<br />I have seen all of the first season episodes at least twice, but I still I enjoyed reading both the script and the comments.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|I wish the show was not cancelled!  :(  I would love to see another sic-fi flick, without smut in it, that is action-oriented.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read mocking jay over my Chistmas break and I loved it. The story line was intense and I'm very sad the trilogy was over. I finished the book in two days and that was while I was out and about doing things. I seemed that once I started reading I needed the book wretched from my hands. I would sugggest this book to anyone that had already read the first two books of the series.<br />I was a little worried going into the final book becasue some of my friends had mentioned how much they hated it so I was worried the whole book was going to be a total disatster. It wasn't, at all, it was amazing. This could be becasue I'm used to reading series and the endings that are hard to except that come with them many of my friends aren't. But I definitely suggest it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love love love this app. I will be buying the full version. I have anxiety and insomnia. I use this app not only to help me fall asleep but to meditate and unwind too. If you love the rain you will love this app.
B006IDG2T6|4.0|I had already seen Harris lecture on this issue and it seemed to cover all the same ground, but I did still enjoy revisiting it. Very thoughtful and sincere.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it I play it all the time it is soooooooooo fun. I have so much fun playing it. heeeheee I love it
B00BF11UM0|1.0|Movie was good just had a problem with amazon instant video I started watching on my PC then went to my living room to finish on my wii u but couldn't said I was watching movie on another device even after I completly turned off my pc tried restarted wii u still didn't fix it so didn't finish movie that night<br />The next day turned on my pc to try again still said same thing<br />So I did a google search and found out its a common problem that has yet to be acknowledged or fixed by amazon<br />Later that day tried on pc again and it started working so finished the movie but wasn't good enough movie to worth all the trouble I had trying to watch it
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I like this book in this trilogy better than the first one. I am on the waiting list for the final book as well.
B009JTCBLE|2.0|I love BCC but while the first two albums captured a creative 70's retro metal sound this album ended up mired in familiar 80's metal hack. This album drones to an incomplete and rushed vibe. Joe's guitar is locked in repetitive power chords and lost while the keyboards are punched up to fill the lack of crunch. Dubbed crappy Van Halenesque back up vocals litter the tunes to mask the lack of musical invention going on. It lacks the growl and inspiration of it's predecessors. (But I will say Bonham does some great drums here.) The lyrics have this feel of trying to be cool rather than real. I could speculate about the reasons why with the band dynamics... but it doesn't really matter. What I'm listening to is an album that goes through the motions but is not an extension of the previous efforts in sounds or quality.
B00846REIS|4.0|Tho the similarities are vast, this trilogy is not the infamous 50. However, I read both books out of this trilogy in 2 days. The second book, IMO, was better than the first. And I am on the waiting list for the 3rd.  I feel if you loved 50,  you will enjoy this series.
B004P7NPWO|3.0|This album sounds like a demo. It's not that I don't like raw but this just lacks any real groove. Very straight forward. Sounds like something that could've been built on like the first draft of a script. There's some interesting stuff here but it could've been so much more. Ironic that Coverdale Page album sounds better than this.
B005NPCUC8|2.0|Sound was fantastic,  but the songs are supposed to be tightly linked,  and the gap between the songs is very distracting.
B00BEPVAV8|2.0|the graphics are great but they time you to race I mean why cant it be like Mario cart when you just race
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Amazing series. Beautifully acted, powerful story. I was home sick for the week and watched the whole thing non-stop! Must see.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|i thought it would be alot funnier knowing family guy where you cant stop laughing this was not like that
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I am a big fan of Mars exploration (even to the point of spending 2 weeks in 2005 in the Utah desert at the Mars Desert Research Station - a Mars simulation). Mr. Weir did some serious research to make this as realistic as possible both with science and human emotions. Fun, Funny and Engaging. My wife and I both enjoyed it immensely!
0307744434|5.0|The NIght Circus was a book club selection.  We have six members.  We all loved it.  It was a charming story.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Love her singing ...................I can only hope .....that she does not loose her beautiful voice again!  That would be very sad!
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I like the app.  It gives you a choice of full Facebook just like on your computer or the mobile version.  I like the Full Facebook version, except it will not let me look at my notifications.  When I click on it, nothing happens.  Otherwise, I haven't had any other problems.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Enjoying this series so very much and extend my deep appreciation for production of such quality entertainment.  Such a joy to relax in the comfort in the knowledge that each moment of this series will not insult the intelligence nor sensitivity of the viewer. Thank You !
1451695187|4.0|My neighbor asked me to order this book so my knowledge of it is secondhand. She is content with it. As to my thoughts I'll go on faith ntil I get there.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Entertainment that delights and continues to give hours of viewer pleasure.  This series brings to the audience such talent, by all involved in the production, that the viewer is drawn into the time and place and becomes a part of the story.  Thank You !.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I rarely give anything 5 stars, let alone music albums but it was a pretty easy 5 star rating.  I've listened to this album countless times and find a new favorite song after each playing.  If you are considering it, just get it, you won't regret it.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Saw the movie the american version and the sweden. always love to read and it was a good choise . Im very please with this purchase. very convinient lound load to my ipad ,and cell phone
B001EYK54W|5.0|This was a great movie Steve McQueen invented cool and this movie shows him at his best exciting movie with out those crapy special effects..  Great movie
B004WMKSH2|2.0|Found the movie boring, predictable, and redundant. Hollywood's way of stretching the story to milk out a few more million from the Potterites.<br />Just skip part one and watch part two, you won' t miss a thing.
1592407889|5.0|Interesting but sad story about how just cause you have rich and famous parents doesn't mean you get love and attention.
B004UFEJVW|5.0|oh how this made me cry. A MUST watch even if you may not be into cartoon movies!!!!! Highly recommend
B008OOYALE|5.0|its great if you love dragons but some times you have to wait alot<br /><br />you should get it! I luv it
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Crazy good... wish there was another book already so I can put some of the loose ends to rest...hopefully we don't have to wait too long!
B005LAII12|5.0|Great movie lot of laugh's. Enjoyed the movie with one of my friends. Actually  I bought the movie as a birthday day gift for him.
B007IK44CK|3.0|This is an OK movie that does not require any special effort on the viewers end to be followed. The spectator is not even required to have seen the previous MI movies. Very irrealistic, which might not be bad in a movie of this genre. Just open your eyes and enjoy the action. It's nice enough to entertain and to make you want to watch it until the end.
B001B6M0F0|5.0|Wow! Recorded in Ohio even! Epic album, especially the 11minute anthem Rock Bottom! Phil, Michael, Pete and co at the high point of their career. 5 stars baby!
B009YX02T8|5.0|Love the Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn album because its great for listening and remembering how the movie was on the screen.
B00005LOUP|5.0|Jim Carrey annoys me. But I love this remake of the grinch. Very entertaining and fun to watch for Christmas.
B00A3SGWYC|5.0|I love the beat of the music and the words.  I is as good as his other album.  I want to hear more of it.
B000641D2Y|5.0|Great movie, great sequel. It a Christmas favorite of me and my husband. We watch it every year. Its that good.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|Love the Simon and Garfunkel's Greatest hits because it lets me remember growing up and how simple life could be.  I miss my mom who loved to play the records all the time.  She also loved to sing which was great.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|This movie is so cute and funny. Even grown men get a kick out of it. It is a new Christmas favorite for me.
1616550414|5.0|As A Gaming Fan and a big Nintendo Its  a must and its got ot be in your collection But well worth the wait
B003NDC07M|5.0|I love Marina and the diamonds :) I purchased this after falling in love with Electra heart, her latest album. I was very pleased, not a bad track! I especially like the I am not a robot remixes.
B00846WWVM|5.0|not only does it make you think of what you are doing but makes you laugh at the mistakes you make  great game
B0002F6BRE|5.0|My favorite recently made Christmas movie. Elf is so cute and funny...and quotable! We watch this movie every Christmas season.
0061438294|5.0|Body language does not tell you when someone is lying, but it tells you when they are uncomfortable.  This is one of the many concepts in the book that just make sense.  This book is enjoyabe to read with lots of stories from Navarro's FBI career.  Being more aware of people's body language helps you to become a better listener and communicator.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|I think it set the stage very well for what's going to happen in season 3, which should be pretty exciting. Again, I have to criticize the carnal for the sake of shock value. The books have some of these parts but the writers of this show really seem to revel in focusing on them. In the few instances in the book where descriptive sex scenes occur, there is usually a good bit of character development that also happens during these scenes. The show seems to gloss over this nuance. I feel like it's distracting and a slight waste of time to throw these scenes in simply because it's HBO, it's shocking, and they can.<br /><br />But, overall, it was an enjoyable season, and I look forward to season 3.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Always a fan of Sanderson, The Emperor's Soul did not disappoint. It did lean heavily on the explanation of the magic system in question, but had quite a bit of depth beyond that.
B00BYOEMTQ|5.0|GREAT MOVIE.  SETS AND ACTORS WERE AMAZING ONCE AGAIN. THE SCENERY WAS BEAUTIFUL. THE DIRECTOR IS MAGIC AND ONCE AGAIN TRUE TO THE BOOK.
B0081336FO|5.0|My favorite BBC show just got even better! This is one of my top shows. This season is better than the first! Maybe because of the third episode or the fact that it is back and just as good if not better than the first season. Love everything about this show!
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Loved Anne!!!!! The singing in this movie was great. Think I'll watch it again now. It is a must must see.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Benedict cumberpatch and Martin freeman.....  Bow to them!  They make this show one of the best I've ever seen.  Everyone needs to see it!  Smart, funny, mysterious, witty, and fun.  This show is awesome!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great book about this mans life as a NAVY Seal, and what really happened in Iraq and Afghanistan. All revolving around how great this man was and how he saved so many soldiers lives............
B008RC72G8|3.0|I expected a comedy, but it was more like a light horrow movie.<br />Defiantly not one of the better Johnny Depp Movies.<br />it was not worth the price I paid.
B0095J0AL6|5.0|My daughter really found it really good.i have followed their music with my daughter from the start there are true boys no airs about them.I have found them goofy in their videos no practices spontaneously with their music they like to just do something on stage have fun.the kids love it parents don't be afraid for kids to like their book.these boys have come along ways & have done well. I wish them Great success to them all.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Excellent and easy read!! I always enjoy movie books and this one has not cease to satisfy. I would recommend this to anyone.
B007MCTTHY|5.0|Challenging but fun and made me think outside the box. A good way to kill time without rotting your brain.
B00AHJL7BK|1.0|I love playing Kakuro, and I had been impatiently waiting for a game to come out that would work with my Kindle Fire.  Well, this one works, but it's really BAD.  First, you have a choice of game size, but not level of difficulty.  I started two games, in different sizes, and they were both way too easy.  In other words, boring.  People new to this game might find them challenging, but I've been playing the game for 30 years.  Second, and even more annoying, is the design.  Did anybody play the game before the release?  An annoying problem I found was pencil mode. I like using pencil mode, but it's very poorly set up.  Let's say the &#34;answer&#34; is 3, and there are two blanks.  I want to pencil in 1 and 2 in each blank.  First, highlight the 1st blank.  Highlight &#34;pencil mode&#34; (PM) at the TOP of the screen.  Type in 1 and 2 in the first blank - those numbers are at the bottom.  Highlight the 2nd blank.  Back to the top and hit PM again.  Back to the bottom and type 1 and 2.  Let's say I've decided the correct order is 2 and 1.  Highlight the 1st blank, turn off PM at the TOP, type 2 at the BOTTOM, go to the 2nd blank, turn off PM at the TOP again, type 1 at the bottom.  Horribly time-consuming, and all those keystrokes take away any enjoyment.  I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!
1451695195|5.0|I loved this book. Dr Alexander does a great job explaining his experience in the coma and why perhaps people don't come out right away, or ever, because it is such an incredible place. I, especially, liked his honesty about being the typical doctor, believing only in science, until he himself went into a coma and when all the top neurosurgeons, including himself, would have declared him brain dead, the miracle happened and he not only recovered, but recovered back to perfect health without any disabilities. Miracles do happen and doctors, though often brilliant, are not always the last resort...there still is prayer and positive vibrations...and God.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Really enjoyed this book!<br />Loved learning such amazin details about India through a fictional story. I could not put it down !
B008YKGQR4|3.0|Using this app I was able to make the screen view bigger on my Kindle Fire HD. I was never able to that on the android version. Also having the option to choose the full version makes it feel more like the original PC version.  Great so far.<br /><br />***UPDATE*** after using for a week or so.  I only use this now when I absolutely need to enlarge the print to read.  The app crashes a lot and does not allow you to return to Facebook once you click on a link.  So I am stuck using the original android version and dealing with the smaller print most of the time.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|easy to play and easy to enjoy.  my 2 year old loves hoses and he can feed and wash this horse without help.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|tHIS MOVIE ACTUALLY HAD A STORY TO IT INSTEAD OF ALL ACTION, This movie had both a story and great action in it.
B004UPAN6W|4.0|Some people groan when their comic book heroes are portrayed too seriously, but Wolverine is a pretty serious guy.  I thought it worked really well.  And I really didn't mind spending a couple of hours watching Hugh Jackman.
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|British TV at its best.  Superb!  Ian Richardson as Francis Urquhart is brilliant.  We were so hooked that we spent several nights of marathon viewing.  The loss of sleep was well worth it!
B00APUYWYA|1.0|This movie went for the cheapest laughs possible at every turn.  OK, sometimes I laughed, but much of the time I was horrified that I was letting my middle schoolers watch it (and yes, that is the target audience; my daughter said she was the last kid among her friends to see it).  As I explained to my 9th grade son (who thought it was hilarious), it's possible make a stupid movie with cheap laughs that also has some character development and a worthwhile message, such as The Benchwarmers or Dodgeball, which he had coerced me to watch and I liked better than I expected.  The main character seems to end the movie as exactly the sort of nasty girl she hated at the beginning.  The movie might have been redeemed somewhat if the music had been better. They had a couple of good songs, but they could have done much more with the talent they had hired.  I'm not faulting the actors, who were actually pretty good and had nice (not awesome) voices, but this movie was a complete trainwreck.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was completely blown away with the ending.  Never underestimate the power of a woman scorned.  The author has quite an imagination
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This is a Great show for a great price. Happy to have it to watch when ever I want to
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|the movie was OK but not outstanding.  It's not the type of movie that I would want to watch over and over again.
