0061122416|5.0|I read this book a few times and find something new each time I read it.  It suggests to me that I too can follow my heart.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Childish writing. I felt irritated by the main character and her expletives at every turn. How foolish can a girl be?
B000AYEL6U|5.0|If you like love stoies you will want to watch this movie more than once I have watched it 5 times sence I got it.I like most BBC  shows and movies from the time period this is based on but this is the best I've wathed you will love it as much as I do.
B000HF0ISC|5.0|Good story. Good star cast. True story told very well about what goes on with Juvenile Detention Centers all around the Country.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use and practical, especially in church (part of a house church that has interactive ministry of the word rather than a traditional sermon), I like the capability of off line versions when I cannot access a wireless connection. Quick navigation. Anyone who needs the compactness will love this app.
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|Not sure why, but I felt like having an enormous beard makes reading this book even better.  Grow a beard then read this book (ladies do your best). All seriousness, a great read to help get back in touch with how &#34;wild&#34; we all really are.  At times you empathize  to an almost uncanny degree.  Just read it.
B005DOKM9M|2.0|My Kindle Fire with its marware case does not fit inside the Zip Sleeve as I was led to believe.  Do you have a larger Zip sleeve that I could exchange the current one?  How can that be accomplished?
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is awesome , it's short but worth it. If you want something new, fresh, this is it. Tired of h o games.
1400049628|5.0|THIS HAS GOOD FOOD FOR THOUGHT WITH HUMOR AND PAST HISTORY OF THE SOLANUM VIRUS.IT HAS TIPS FOR ANY DISASTER AND REMINDS US THAT THIS ADVENTURE CAN CHANGE AT ANY TIME .NOT A PARANOID FEAR MONGER BOOK . GIVES HOPE FOR A POSITIVE OUTCOME. MAKES A GREAT GIFT.
1451675046|4.0|The Magic of Reality is a wonderful book. Dawkin's masterful prose is once again well deployed to popularize science. Unlike Dawkin's other books (except the God Delusion), this book is written for a wider and a younger audience. Dawkin's project is to convince readers that scientific explanations for the world have an inherent beauty and are far more fulfilling the other explanations. The books is structured in a formulaic manner in as much that every chapter begins with a questions which is followed by a non-scientific answer which is meant to be in sharp contrast with the rest of the chapter where Dawkins proceeds to answer the question scientifically. In effect Dawkins wants to convince the reader that \\"the only good reason to believe that something exists is if there is real evidence that it does\\" (15). He suggests that this can be done by \\"creating models of what might  be real and then testing those models to see whether they successfully predict things\\" (16). Dawkins proceeds to introduce different definitions of magic and claims that science imbues the world with poetic magic. Ultimately, Dawkins wants to show readers that \\"the real world, as understood scientifically, has magic of its own - the kind I call poetic magic: an inspiring beauty which is all the more magical because it is real and because we can understand how it works\\" (31). Never mind, I must add, that this beauty is a strange one for it is not inherent but it is attributed to facts, ideas, and theories once these are deemed to have explanatory power.<br /> I will briefly describe the contents of the book (spoiler alert!). Chapter 1 seems to answer who was the first person (no one; these distinctions are difficult to discern, parental generations and offspring always seem alike but we can notice difference when we compare points that are separated by many generations). Chapter 3 is about \\"why are there so many different kinds of animals?\\" (the answer is natural selection) & describes animals as \\"what am I looking at is an elaborate machine for passing on the genes that made it. I'm looking at a survival machine for genes. Next time you look in the mirror just think: that is what you are too\\" (75). Chapter 4 is \\"what are things made of\\" Here Dawkins discusses how Greece, China and India all came to belief that matter was composed of air, water, fire and earth. Until one ancient Greek Democritus thought they were composed of indivisible parts (atoms). Here Dawkins defines elements, compounds, isotopes, protons, etc. Chapter 5 is about why we have night and day, winter and summer. Seasons, Dawkins writes, are explainable by yearly orbiting of the Earth around the sun (at about 93 million distance), and the daily changes are explainable by the planets spinning round and round (103). When a part of the planet faces the sun they have day. The Earth  revolves around the sun in a circle like ellipse but it is also on tilted axis of 23.5 degrees; thus the part of the Earth tilted towards the sun experiences summer. Chapter 6 is about what the sun is (a star where elements a produced). Chapter 7 is about \\"what is a rainbow\\", water bends light and as water droplets fall the ones they are replaced by bends light in a similar fashion thus to an observer a rainbow appears (he far end of the droplets behave as mirrors). Each colour bends differently and each droplets bends all light that pass through it; however, we only see one colour per raindrop. Chapter 8 is about \\"when and how did everything begin\\" (big bang). Chapter 9 addresses the question of whether \\"we are alone\\"; Dawkins speculates that life exists on \\"probably on millions of planets\\" (186). He also makes argument about traits we should expect to see (i.e. eyes). Chapter 10 is about Earthquakes. Later, Dawkins moves on to less scientific questions like Why do bad things happen (Chapter 11). This is mostly because being good or bad does not affect what happens to you. Chapter 12 is about miracles, here Dawkins talks about coincidences that may appear significant but actually must, by definition, occur quite commonly (i.e. thinking of someone and that person rings you up while ignoring all the times this has not happened). Phenomena that remains unexplained is not necessarily magic but rather it is a puzzle waiting to be solved.<br /> This is a book aimed at children or at readers with basic questions about basic things (although many well educated folk may have forgotten the reasons why some of these things occur (like rainbows)). The book is well written and the inclusion of myths at the beginning of most chapters provides a contrast with the scientific explanations (and the myths are also interesting in of off themselves). Ultimately, Dawkins wants to convince readers that \\"I hope you agree that the truth has a magic of its own. The truth is more magical - in the best and most exciting sense of the word - than any myth of made up mystery or miracle. Science, has its own magic: the magic of reality\\" (257). Dawkins does marshall a convincing set of explanations that show that science can be marvelous, exciting and poetic. However, in his zeal to maximize the poetry of reality, the book may be undervaluing other important aspects of our lives. Nevertheless, this is a wonderful read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game ain't like &quot;OMG this game is sssssoooo awsome,but it's good and its kid friendly. But for me it was a bit confusing
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Thought it would be violent. It wasn't. Well woven plot. I' already ordered the next book and watched the movie.
B00BGIC170|4.0|Anything these guys play in together is a have to see! I just Love her in any movie she acts in. Most female actors aren't funny in every movie they act in but love her.

B00821OX98|5.0|Falling Skies season 1, was very exciting and suspenseful. The aliens were very believable and they did not over power the story line. This is a true underdog story, a struggle for humanity with aliens.<br /><br />CMB
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I know this didn't go over at the box office as expected, but I really loved the movie. I laughed, cried, and even cringed some. It is a movie I would definitely watch again.
8478886559|5.0|the books were on time, on perfect shape and where brought in a box to protect them. My best purchase so far
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|This is easily one of the five best TV series of all time.  It was highly original, well casted, and had innovative ideas on special effects.  Only one of the regular characters (Sulu) was weakly played.  The other characters were handled extremely well by the actors.  Those unfamiliar with this series should not be deterred from buying it, because you saw one of the later Star Trek series with a different cast.  All the later Star Trek series and movies were abominations and an outrageous insult to the original series.  Only, the original series was truly \\"original\\" and a masterpiece.  This series still stands out after decades and decades of garbage on TV.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|An okay book not awesome though!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!so yeah it's not like I love the book I just think it's a good thing
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I enjoyed the flow of the book. Got a little slow in a few places. Story line was good and interesting.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is a great game makes you think one step ahead. Can also be addicting in a good way. Enjoyed many hours of play.

B0074MZSWW|4.0|Saw this group on Saturday Night Live.  Quite unusual.  Bluesy and jazzy, strongly resembling the sounds of Janis Joplin.  I truly enjoyed it but then I am an old Joplin fan.
B008OOYALE|5.0|my daughter love to play it. and i love it too.make your stress go away.and very helpful to bring if you have doctors appt.
B005LAIIGC|5.0|The visuals are fantastic and it gives a new twist to classic childhood characters. The story isn't perfect, but it's still pretty enjoyable.
B005K17RU0|5.0|That's all I wanted in a weather app. This app fits the bill perfectly. The Weather Channel app is just too bulky.
B000002OX7|5.0|Rock wouldn't be rock with out these guys. Baba O'riely rocks as one of the greatest songs ever written in the top 100 all time rock hits. Cool cover. &#34;Timeless&#34; nature calls on the wall cracks me up every time. A must have for your collection of who albums or cd's.
B006CHML4I|4.0|I got this watch because my Hamilton's case  was getting too beaten up. This watch has turned out to be a rather pleasant surprise.Although it is pretty small by today's standards, the dial is easy to read and the hands have pretty good lume.It keeps better time than the Hamilton, only gaining about 2 seconds a week and is quieter, actually, it's almost silent.The time and date is a little difficult to set up owing to the small size and inconvenient location of the crown, so I suppose it's better suited for an everyday watch which is how I use it All in all not a bad watch considering it cost about a sixth of what the Hamilton cost.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|About what I expected, really nothing special. I thought it was a tad overacted with a particularly poor performance from Tommy Lee Jones.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|I have loved this show from the first episode in 1994. I always cry thru the show and watching it almost ten years later, it is like watching for the first time!
B001GXF2YY|5.0|Angels Flight is the first Michael Connelly book I have read, and it will not be the last.  Again and again I was surprised at the many plot twists.  A must read.  My next Connelly book will be his award winning novel, The Poet.
1451695195|5.0|I was impressed with the author's credentials, his ability to describe his responses in a logical manner, and his conviction of life after death with a Personal Being.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|My 9 year old and I love this movie (watched it twice).  It is a beautiful movie with a wonderful lessons to be learned.
B005FQ2H8W|5.0|I saw this movie a long time ago when it first came out, so ordered the DVD version now.  It's a great movie with a basis in fact, and a theme that I like - scientific fantasy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If you are going to &#34;catch up&#34; on the series....start from season one episode one. There is no other way to do it!
B004EPZ08E|5.0|Lots of things in this movie are wrong on many levels but funny to watch !! Love seeing the movie over and over !! Many of these actors play roles you are not used to seeing them in so that to me it shows they are good enough to succeed at other roles in the future !!
B004GJXQ20|5.0|The books are well written and engaging. There are a lot of characters involved, almost like a Russian novel, but that is OK. For some it might be easier to read the books after having watched the TV series since you know most of the characters.
B008IBPMZG|4.0|I wish I didn't have so much lag with watching this on my TV via xbox 360, because the episodes are awesome.  I have to restart each episode multiple times to see an entire one - although the episode description says it's 49 minutes long, it takes almost twice that to see a whole one.  Beef up the streaming, Amazon, please??
B0000714BP|5.0|This movie was amazing, with two guys you wouldn't have thought would come off well as girls - though John had used cross dressing in his stand up comedy.  I thought it was such a kick that Patrick Swayze looked just as good as a girl as he did a guy.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|My wife and I thought the movie &#34;Lincoln&#34; was great.  We thought the acting, scenery and costuming was very well done.
B00B5A9FOG|4.0|We love Merlin but didn't like the ending.  We were hoping for another season.  The quality of the disk is great!
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|This is another great way to feed Om Nom. Thank you Zeptolab for (again) a great game. Kudos to you!
B00884GR0W|1.0|It is to scary for my son. There are great white sharks, scary people and squids and the most scariest monsters. The only thing my son likes is that there are dolphins.
B0024FADAQ|5.0|It was a little cheesy, but still good.  I always like ones where the good guys are up against the odds, and win.  This one showed a little of the home town atmosphere too, where Alex comes from a trailer park.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|This is probably my all time favorite season of the show! All of the characters are at their best for me! It's got an interesting plot and it's just a fun and exciting show to watch!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Was leery about watching this since it was pretty much made for the young crowd.  But, I enjoyed it immensely.  The plot, acting and all other elements of this film were extremely well done.  We were impressed.
B009UAO1ZG|3.0|About all you'd ever want to  konw about that time and the people. Some parts are a little boring. Well written.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game I ever played.But the down side is they have not updated it yet to 0.7.0 sadly
B008Q0AZVK|4.0|This was an interesting film. I was pleasantly surprised because I did not expect much but the character analysis and story line was very interesting and the acting quite good. Kudo's for Robert Pattinson. Nice job.
B004ZNB12O|4.0|IT'S PINK FLOYD!!!!.....what's not to like!  FAVORITE 70's band...hands down.  I think I appreciate them even more now, with my wisdom & knowledge of music, they come on the radio and I completely STOP what I'm doing and just take it in!!  ENJOY!
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Love The Good Wife. Just finished Season 2 and I am diving right in to Season three. Alicia is so cool and aloof, I am often caught off guard by how well her character is portrayed.
B008Y73940|3.0|It's an average film with average acting but a somewhat interesting plot reversal. Relationships between lawyer and former wife are strange both professionally and personally.
1400069742|5.0|If you like American history, during a period of great uncertainty & conflicting ideals, you should love this book. It seems to tell it like it was, full of quotes, stories, headlines & facts gleaned from a variety of well-documented sources. She has a wonderful command of the language & her writing moves along at a good steady clip. Unlike many books of this nature, while not devoid of commentary, she resists prophesying, predicting and speculating-- she just gives you all the information and lets you decide. It is extremely informative and shows the prevailing mind-set and yes, the resilience, of early 1940s America, from the wealthy to the working class, in detail and how they evolve through some social upheavals and rapidly-changing times. I recommend it highly!
B000GOWNPU|4.0|This was about the 3rd time I've seen this film since it was first released back in the 80's. It's quite a story, but mostly because it's a true story and well told in this film. This one's an excellent addition to anyone's film library.
B00074CBMY|4.0|Joe Cocker is my most favorite person to see live, have seen him 5 times and he actually gets better & better!  This is fun to hear, just to enjoy HIS artistry on these classics.  Really good CD!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the Walking Dead!  It's very well written and the acting is top notch.  It's not at all what I expected.  I miss it now that season 3 is over.
B008CPZNL6|4.0|Take the opportunity too learn about many things with the flick of a finger. It a great way to see whats happening quickly.
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|The movie was a little boring and some of the things that occurred were left unexplained. The movie focused on what happened to the mom and the oldest son, but there were a lot of holes in the story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is extreamly epic and addicting,like temple run but even better! I love this game even though I just got it Today. :)
B00063EMJ6|5.0|You just forget how GREAT his songs were and still are!  Pour a drink, kick back and just enjoy the ride...yep, you'll be smiling!
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|It's an okay movie.  I chuckled a few times.  I do believe that it would be a much better movie without all of the raunchiness.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Naomi Watts really was incredible.  You felt all her pain and suffering.  It was definitely a hard one to watch.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Very interesting book that gives first-hand information about what the big companies actually do to the food, how it's marketed, and how it has affected our nation and culture!
B008602KQI|5.0|a wonderful movie on courage, commitment friendship and love.  Whne children are given an opportunity to lead they can do so. I do recommend this movie
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|awesome album... still themselves but able to make a new sound.  you can hear how evolved Haley vocal ability has become.
B005ZUR724|5.0|This game is amazing. To remove the issues with not connecting and saying it needs to be updated install delete and re-install. this process can take up to 7 hours so don't threat and have patience. This is the Kindle ed. so don't download it to your phone or tablet.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|My Kinder garten aged and brilliant grandson spends hours with it it is a super ex citingand mentaly exciting app for him
B009G41CG2|3.0|The major advantage of this game was the challenging skill level.  When I win, I feel as if I have accomplished something.  However, I would have liked more colorful graphics and more variety in tile sets.
B003V1WXKU|5.0|You can't help but laugh out loud quite a few times when reading this book. It's very entertaining, I would definitely suggest it to just about anyone. However, there are a few times in the book where he goes into talking about Physics, which may be confusing if you don't know much about Physics, but I would suggest reading this book. Even if your not scientifically inclined, I'm sure you will enjoy reading it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game kept my great nieces busy for hours. We had to make them put them up just to eat. They figured out the rules on there own their own and played until our kindled ran of juice.
B003WUYRGI|2.0|Why have this book on here. It is terrible. Why have it  as one of the books that Kindle gives you for free. If you want a dictionary you can get one yourself.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|super performance by all actors. Kept me on the edge of my seat and wanting more. There was a shock during each episode. Hope next season is just as good.
B004G7UTXG|3.0|It is an ok movie. It made me think. It wasn't what I expected for some reason and I was both heartened by some aspects and saddened by the final outcome.
B0063IH60K|2.0|When I get a match it is too hard to drag it to the next pile of cards. I give up after 3 try's.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm moving through book three now and I agree with all the reviews that encouraged me to purchase the omnibus rather than each book on its own. I love how Howey spends time with each character so we can see the multiple worlds of each as the story unravels. Great mystery throughout- can't wait to see what's going on. Reading this during my breaks at work, then on the way home one day heard Howey on NPR. Glad to see he's got the digital rights- there's a good story in this book's existence as well. Enjoy!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|that was the best book i have ever read. this book teaches kids a wonderful lesson in life. it was the best book i have ever read!!!!!  you shold totally read it
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a great read. The story line has potential for many more books (50 at least ;).  The authors writing style made the pages flow like water and I was done with all 5 volumes and wanting more all to soon.  I would recommend this to any SF fan or fans of a Dystopian future.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it awesome couldn't be better except they could make it load faster that is all just adding words ros submit review yeah awesome cool
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Haha... darn those pigs, but if you have great aim, who gets the last laugh in the end? Fun game for all ages.
B004N0I3U2|5.0|It was pierce Brosnan's first bond film and its the one that really got me into the secret agent fiction. I absolutely love Goldeneye!
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|An infantile romance rag with trite sexual descriptions.<br />This was recommended when I purchased the Dragon Tattoo series and I don't understand why someone thinks this book is of a genre that relates to those three books?
B0063IH60K|4.0|Don`t care for all the ads after you  choose the play. Once in a while but every time? Annoying but then again it was free.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Perfection couldn't have been any better a variety of levels and a great challenge for a wide range of ages.<br />  Proffesional Game Reviews
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|SUCH A GENTLE YET SURPRISING TWIST MADE THIS A MEMORABLE STORY.<br />IT WAS EASY TO PUT YOURSELF IN THE CHARACTERS,PLACE-MALE OR FEMALE.VERY ENJOYABLE.
B00CFA222M|5.0|This just goes to show how much better bad movies are than good movies. This is like the Troll 2 of special effects. Time to lighten the load, HAHAHAHAHA.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|This is the app I use the most.  If you want access to Amazon on your Nexus 4, this is the app to you.  -Great App...
B00942X8PY|4.0|I like a game that requires more brain than than hand eye coordination.  This is it!  Easy to stop suddenly too.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|My brother in law turned me on to this series and I could read this over and over again.  Cannot wait for more books to see the journey of Kvothe.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its fun but needs some improvement should have more ways to earn free gems and have more bores to choose from
B00BZBPRBA|5.0|This is an excellent movie for both kids and families. You will enjoy to see how Matilda becomes independent. It's also funny
B004J4WLPU|4.0|It took me awhile to get into the book, but once I did it was hard to put down. Ending was not completely satisfying for me, but good enough.
B00846F1YW|3.0|Went through the whole game in one afternoon.  Not my kind of game, but kids might enjoy it. I did on that afternoon.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|My brother in law turned me onto this series and I cannot wait until the next one comes out. It's not a book filled with exciting and thrilling parts but I love to see what they have in store for Kvothe.  I like to see the trials and errors he must go through to be great at what he wants in the end.
B00BESCUKK|2.0|Hugely disappointing. The trailer was the best way to see this movie. It suffered because of its weak link - the writer/director RZA. He may be a huge fan of the genre and he may have Tarantino in his corner but it unfortunately didn't mean that he could create an entertaining movie. It was boring, overly self-indulgent and didn't even deliver on the action. And for a martial arts movie to not offer up some great fight scenes, it's a huge failure in my book.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|There are very few books that I have read and I have read a lot, that have gripped me the way this one did. Very well written and beautifully detailed.
B005K17RU0|5.0|The app is very good and very responsive. I am able to get to all the features that I need very quickly.
B007ZTLLMK|2.0|Uuh, this is almost ALL hand eye coordination.  I'm not a fan of that kind of game. I like a brainier, easy to quit suddenly game.
B00AGDW8II|2.0|Moved slow and I could never engage in the story line. Debra Winger did a good job but that was about it.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I devoured this book in just a couple of hours. The story line was soo perfectly crafted and explained. The details keep you reading on page after page. So descriptive of even the smallest things you find yourself immersed in the story wanting to keep on reading. Cannot wait to pick up the next tittle from this author!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game my horse is so life like and it is such a great interactive game for ever age
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|This film is an unexpected delight. Apparently a sequel is in the works. While younger viewers may enjoy the 'action', mature viewers will appreciate the characters and the challenges they face in retiring from a unique line of work. We loved it.
B005HSL626|5.0|Hardly any ad popups, and this game is addictive, simple, and fun. Have to buy the full version now, lol.
B00BSBY38A|4.0|Amazing cinematography. Story line reminded me of Cast Away with Tom Hanks but with a greater creative take on being isolated/stranded.
B008Y78GYI|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out and the picture quality was fantastic. It almost made it seem like I was watching this movie for the first time. I looked awesome on my Kindle Fire and looked almost as good when I hooked it up to my TV. Really enjoyed seeing it again in such good shape and quality.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Really like this. Haven't completed all the levels yet. Some strategy needed , so you don't have to use power-ups.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|for anyone who can remember the iranian hostage crisis in 1979, this movie tells another story that was not known until recently.
B00BD2DRHW|3.0|When getting this, I didn't realize how oriented for a much younger crowd. While there's nothing wrong with that, it's not my cup of tea. However, the graphics were nice, and the gameplay easy enough for a 6/ 7 yr. old to be able to play with little to no problems and enjoy it.
B00683JLXA|1.0|It's definitely a Angry Birds rip off and a terrible one it is. Bad physics, bad animation and just plain bad. Even for free this isn't worth it. Save time and don't bother.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I was impressed with Dr. Alexander's memory of his near-death experience, and how well he described what he saw, heard and felt. It made for fascinating reading. What struck me was how he, as a highly trained doctor, came to realize after so many years that there is indeed a personal God who's in control of everything, including our individual lives.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|For a free game, the graphics are good and I enjoy the unique experience of seeming to ride a horse. As with most \\"free\\" games, the item (gem) you want most takes a very long time to accumulate and this is where many people will just go ahead and buy gems with real money.  I have found this in all the free games and understand that they need money to create and maintain the game.  What I don't like in this game is that, at Level 11, adds suddenly started popping up throughout the game.  I read that in order to stop this advert invasion, you must purchase (real money) a gem package.  I could tolerate an advert popping up at the start of the game (something I have experienced with other free games), but it is extremely annoying to have these adds come up continuously during the game.  I have not found advertising as bad as this with any of the other free games that I have tried.
B00A6D5GBE|5.0|The gameplay is basic but surprisingly deep once you get past the surface level. With a cute and simple story, this would be fun no matter, but this game has some of the best visuals I have seen on any tablet game. The visuals are very detailed, and it looks like a dream-esque painting you get to play. Highly recommend this on every conceivable level.
1939416019|5.0|If you are a fan of HP, Percy Jackson, Sherwood Smith and other high fantasy epic romances for young adults then you will LOVE this series!<br /><br />I think Rice does an amazing job with introducing us to a new world that is protected by \\"The Ring.\\"  While parts of it, such as the Empire, I felt were a little far flung overall I really enjoyed the book and couldn't recommend it more.  The maiin character Thor doesn't know he has Druid like powers and they are spordactive for him to use at best.  However I love him for his personality.  He constantly will choose to take the hard road if it is the right thing to do.  His mind doesn't debate his decisions, he justs sees what needs to be done and he does it.  He accepts failure, but still tries to always live up to the code of the Legion/ the Silver.<br /><br />Looking forward to more installments with Thor, Gwen, and Reese!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|More twists and turns around every corner. Once you start watching you're hooked. It is hard to turn it off!!!
B00BIVN82M|5.0|The 3 stars and below crowd must be listening to a different CD. Of course, there's always the possibility that they know Buble and they've got an axe to grind. How else can you explain poor to mediocre rewiews of this CD?<br /><br />Great performances and song choices, as usual. Michael is the best male singer since Frank Sinatra. I'm also a big fan of Josh Groban, but unlike Groban, Buble really can write good songs that enhance, not detract from the listening experience. A case in point, Home was one of the best songs on the It's Time CD.<br /><br />Keep it up Michael, can't wait for the next one.
B00B22IJXK|4.0|Very easy to use interface allows for just about anyone to be able to use it, and the more detailed features (messing around with a photo, etc.) are easy enough once you played with for a spell. I think it's worth the price if you are in the market for this type of app.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very good read, and kept you wanting to read more, The only real negative, discussed in our book club, was that it was a little long, probably could have been shortened a bit. Still worth picking up!
B00BWJARHO|5.0|The settings are stunning! Each scene is breath-taking. Of course, it was a great set up for the story behind the story. Can't wait for the next installment.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|Love this silly game!  Quick, fun and entertaining for little break from reality!  Get your strategy down and watch those penquins go!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|its awesome it is glitches sometimes though ive really enjoyed it its one of my top ten favorite trust me
B0094M2S5A|5.0|I love the music!! I also loved watching the interaction with the characters. I is an interesting plot having life come between the people you were closest in college. The dreams you had/have why you didn't follow that path.. Great Movie!!
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|The movie is very well acted, very well produced.  You think you are actually there.  And that's about as good as you can do with this kind of material.  Most movies don't really have life lessons to reveal, but this one does.  And it's that religious fanaticism can become so extreme and violent that the only solution will be to eliminate the infected brain behind the disorder.  All the innocent people in this country who died for no reason were avenged within seconds once we breached that compound and with no fanfare.  And it will bring tears to your eyes once bin Laden is dead just like it did to the little CIA agents when she finally realized she got him.<br /><br />This is the only movie about 9/11 I have watched.  It's the only one I could make myself watch, because I knew the outcome would be terrific.  Nothing in my life has made me as angry as 9/11, especially watching good people jump to their death in those flaming towers.  I will never get over that.
B004UJ6YNO|3.0|Music is OK, not exactly to my taste. She can sing very well but could use stronger material. Variety is the spice of life isn't it?
B004P8A7J2|4.0|I already knew Ellen Burstyn was a fine actress, of course, but she really shines in this film, more so than the rest of the cast, who are adequate but not outstanding.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|I found the plot and the acting very enjoyable. I would recommend it, worth the rental fee definitely!! It had violence in it so not a movie I would see with my young children.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|but it is hard to see and it is to much coins to exspand yaw so awesome so so spool awesome
B009AMANBA|5.0|Very well done....... almost accurate and  to the period<br />I would have liked to have seen Tom Hanks portray Lincoln ..........maybe in another Lincoln movie??
B00271DNP4|5.0|I chose this rating because I enjoyed the movie.  The story was wonderful, the movie itself was well done and the quality of the video was great.
0765367297|5.0|My ds loves these books and cant get enough of them.  I will be ordering more soon as I get a list of what he needs.
B00BGD07KS|5.0|I’m a fan of Mariah’s and will always support the music she puts out!<br />This is a different kind of record 4 Mariah and at the same time a track for a movie/soundtrack! I see it as an opportunity 4 her 2 appeal 2 a different audience, but the true fans (like myself) can’t wait 4 a new CD release done only the way she can…
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Couldn't put it down, finished it in 2 days!! Good insight to what happens behind the scenes. Makes you appreciate all who serve
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|This is a good movie, especially if you don't know the history.  However,  my husband and I watch the history channel,  military history and documentaries all the time.  So we found this to be a review of what we already knew.  So it seemed slow.  In fact we were both on our phones playing words with friends back and forth through the whole movie.
B006X5L6VS|2.0|I thought based one the description it would help me find the constellations as I pointed my kindle fire up to the sky.  It didnt do that at all.
B00BZODDYU|4.0|And yes, it is a ghost story. Anyone who has been disappointed by recent entries in the genre that turned out to be psychological thrillers instead: here's your movie. Mama starts with the setup: a man (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) who lost his shirt when the stock market crashed goes on a tear and leaves the scene of the crime with his two very young daughters in tow. I don't think I'm spoiling too much to say that he doesn't get very far before meeting a sticky end, but his daughters survive and over the ensuing five years go feral in a forgotten cabin in the woods. Meanwhile, their father's twin brother Luke (also Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) has never stopped looking for them. When they are finally discovered he wants a prominent place in their lives. So does his former sister-in-law, a chilly blonde who sues to win custody and will likely win due to the fact that she is more successful financially than he is. The psychiatrist who has been treating the girls does not want to lose access to them and knows their aunt will take them across the country and out of his reach, so he makes a deal with Luke: he will set Luke and his girlfriend Annabelle (Jessica Chastain) up in the suburbs in exchange for his influencing the outcome of the custody trial. Annabelle is a bassist in a punk rock band and emphatically not interested in motherhood, but she loves Luke so she goes along with the plan. What almost nobody realizes is that the girls were not really alone in the forest, and they are not the only new guests in Luke and Annabelle's new home either. The main suspense is in finding out who or what Mama really is, but there is an added frisson when the viewer realizes (minor spoiler ahead) that the good doctor might know more than he initially let on as well. And there's a humdinger of an emotional wallop as the girls realize that they have to choose because they can't have both Mama and Annabelle in their lives. Mama won't allow it. The special effects are very well done and the acting is well above average for a horror flick. If you like ghost stories check it out.
B000OLROWC|4.0|A classic and even after viewing this many times it was fun to watch again.  I think I had a bad taste in my mouth from all the successive sequels to Karate Kid.  But as most, the original Karate Kid was and is the best of the lot.
B000J670ZI|3.0|It had no educational value; was only entertaining.  Story was completely impossible and<br />actors, though noted for being the greatest, were totally unbelievable.
B002WCLG48|5.0|I enjoyed watching it since I am a huge Halo fan.  I found it to keep more with the books than I thought it would as well.
B00CDUFD8Y|5.0|After reading an upbeat review for Celebrate: Greatest Hits in a recent issue of Mojo I just had to check out the latest Simple Minds release even though I haven't really thought about them in years. What a pleasant surprise this collection is!<br /><br />There are the obvious 80s staples, of course, like \\"Alive and Kicking\\" and \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\" that still sound great decades later and there are the lesser known (at least to the casual fan) tracks that remain fantastic. \\"Love Song\\" almost sounds menacing with its relentless beat, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. \\"Let There Be Love\\" is mystical and mesmerizing, as pleasing as ever to the ear! Some songs, like \\"She's A River,\\" don't hold up so well, but that's the rare exception.<br /><br />Brand new highlights include \\"Stars Will Lead The Way\\" and \\"Broken Glass Park,\\" both of which manage that rare feat of making a band you loved yesterday sound just as amazing today! You may not need to buy the whole album (diehard fans probably already have much of what's on here!) but if you're new to the band or haven't heard them in years, definitely give this a listen!
B008YZ4RR0|5.0|I was a magnum pi fan and I was a bit tepid in my enthusiasm to watch this series of flicks with Selleck, but I was pleasantly surprised as Stone Cold was entertaining, full of mystery and panache that only Selleck could pull off.  Bravo.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|fast paced and fun.  You can have many games going at once, pretty mindless in a comparison to Words with Friends where you have to make words - even if you have never heard of them!  DWB is really fun.
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark is a very talented writer. I have read her books since I was a teenager.  I love everything she writes.
1400067820|1.0|Whereas Taleb previous books were based on subject matter he was an expert in, this book is based on subjects Taleb has only an antidotal understanding in.<br />- Medicine: Takes the case of poison, and very modest injestion as a safeguard, and applies it to ALL of Medicine.<br />- Strawman attacks on medicine, were Taleb believes things about the medical community, that the medical community doesn't say or advocate.<br />- Seems to attack Krugman and Stiglits with things he's read from the Wall Street Journal, or just ad hominum attacks.<br />  - Seems to be unaward of Stiglit's positions on Wall Street and a sustainable stock market.  Makes the SAME Wall Street attacks as Stiglit's makes.<br />- As a matter of fact, this books is a never-ending ad hominum attack on everything and everyone, with no evidence or fact.<br /><br />Worthless waste of your time.<br /><br />Taleb's first and second books are worth reading, this book is his CASHING In On Fame.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|Enya, what more can you say.  A lot of my favorites are on here as well as some I had not heard before.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is really addictive and fun to play with friends and I also like how you can get players via the mystery box
B009B8YZIK|5.0|My ds reads these books from Halo so fast.  He enjoys them a great deal.  I will be ordering as soon as I make a list of what he has so I dont reorder something he has already.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great app. I just love it and play it all the time. It's a good app for all ages.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I enjoyed the movie so much I have now read all the books and am looking forward to the future installments of the movie.  In the first one they have probably stayed about as faithful to the book as  is possible, not exact but fairly close.
B000UJ24SC|5.0|How in the world did TBDM ever get lumped in to deathcore I will never know. Not one breakdown or pig squeal on this whole album. Or any other album from them. Melodic death metal?? I will buy that. Nocturnal is a quick album. Clocking in at 34 minutes and some change. The record starts off with Everything Went Black and is actually very catchy. The very next track.What A Horrible Night To Have A Curse definitely shows off Trevor's vocal capabilities. Deathmask Divine has awesome soloing and shows off the talent that they are becoming very well known for. Of Darkness Spawned has some heavy catchy riffs. With Nocturnal, The Black Dahlia Murder are actually caught between Gothenburg Death Metal and early eighties thrash. Tons of influences here and they are quickly flexing their death metal muscle. Excellent band and definitely proving to be one of the best death metal bands in the modern era. \m/
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|My dd loves One Direction.  She doesnt stop listening to it.  Her favorite it Zayne...She loves their music and cant wait until they release another album
B004NELBPC|1.0|Don't use at all; print is too small and light to read comfortably.  This is the first time I've used this app so I have no experience with other versions.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This is truly an outstanding movie, while a dramatization the fact that it is loosely based on an actual occurance make very interesting.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Lord of the Rings series was better but with all the drama surrounding the making of the Hobbit it could have been worse. Saw it in the theater and rented it. Will see it again before seeing the next in the series.
0393964582|5.0|It arrived to my house really quick. The book is nice, no broken part or any shortcoming. It is just the stickers on the cover of the book; they are a little bit difficult to be torn down. But the book is wicked nice! I love it! Thank you
B0051GY2P2|4.0|It has quite a lot i common with George Orwell's Burmese Days, but somehow lighter (funnier) because of its ironic humour.
0060557818|5.0|This is a story about Richard Mayhew who finds himself yanked out of his regular life and is unwittingly (and unwillingly thrust into London Below: a world of cutthroats, counts, demons, angels, the undead, and magic sprites. The bulk of the book describes his adventures in this unseen, unknown, unknowable land of which London Above is unaware; and it is the story about his desire to go back home, and what he finds when he gets back there. Neil Gaiman tells wonderful stories. The book is entertaining, exciting, and well-paced. His major characters are well-developed and interesting, and (as always) his writing contains irresistible, though not distracting or detracting, humor. Each step of the book left me wanting more.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Heard it was a good film but it was much better than expected. Well worth a rental and a great movie for a night in.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|For those who like adventures and riddles. This is a good childrens animation.<br />Overall the story keeps your interested and wanting to know the misteries of the ship.  Recommended for all ages
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was challenging in the spirit of MYST it is definitely not your typical find the hidden object game.  I can't wait for the next one.<br />I loved this game.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|Many do not like Tom Cruise.  He rubs them the wrong way, or perhaps they are chagrined because he is not &#34;Oscar Material&#34;, or whatever.  Grow up.  He's not supposed to be of the Oscar stuff.  Cruise is great at what he does: he makes a quality action movie with subtle humor and not riddled with profanity (the ever increasing popular stuff where 95% of English dialog is replaced with F*** or mind-numbing slang).  It's one of my few reliefs in moviedom that someone out there is still producing movies like this.  Again, it's not a deep flick, but it has a decent plot that doesn't totally insult your intelligence, and the hero is still a hero.  He kills bad guys and has self-control: he doesn't have to sleep with everything that crawls across the screen.  And, this is a movie that I can actually allow my kids to see without having to fast forward the majority of the scenes due to nudity or horrifying content (the closest thing to nudity is a rear shot of a woman in a thong, but for the faint-hearted in these matters, it is a mere flash).  Perhaps the highest point for me is that the hero actually cares that justice is executed (albeit in his own hands), unlike so many who make a mockery of justice by waffling in doubt about perpetrators to the degree that the perps in the end rule the &#34;justice&#34; system.  Every now and then the wild west style of justice is awfully refreshing.  Kudos, Cruise and company!
B009CPEOC4|5.0|Very interesting. Better than I expected and will watch it again when it becomes available for free on my Prime account.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Loved it can't wait for the next book  would recommend to all my friends it was very good kept you on the edge
0783225881|5.0|I rate this very high as I love this movie.  The DVD has much more extras than the VHS tape had and I can review areas much faster.  It was shipped for free and that was the best!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Buy this game it is awesome and I cannot wait until number 2 waist you're money on this app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!(: not ):
B0019IB0II|5.0|Saw her talk on TED talks during a couple of my Speech and Hearing sciences classes. Knew I had to read the book.
B005IQZB14|2.0|Widely recommended, not very impressed.<br />The main character is likeable but not relatable to mass audience. Story drags in many places.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I loved this CD.  A great collection of show tunes, and Donny too!  Susans voice is very clear and strong.
B00573RHIS|3.0|The model was just OK. I think it is over priced. I should have put my money into a different model.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Much better than expected. Pretty funny and loved Sara Silverman in this. Entertaining and well worth a rental. Give Ralph a chance.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|this was done in the highest standards, no shortcuts were taken and told how incredibly cruel that the kings and queens of england were.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|ColorNote provides a quick and efficient method to keep those little things that I always forget at the top of my review list.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|The kids love this app, I started playing it initially but they are now obsessed with this game. Mom approved for using problem solving skills and strategy.
B000SGRONM|5.0|David is a blast. Would love to hear him live someday. Used selected excerpts in a voice and diction class that left them rolling in the aisles. Thank you David....
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is one of the best apps I've played in awhile. I am not ADDICTED to this game. Nope. I'm COMMITTED!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Not the same as the book, but still a great movie!  Wish it had a bit more of the details that were in the book though
B007ZSBQYE|4.0|Well, gotta say that this a good challenge... put you into a competitive mind set to finish the levels... love racing games and this really challenges to \\"driving technique\\" on all cars in game.=)
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. I would highly recommend it. The characters truly came to life. A page turner that I did not want to end.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|I think this is a fun game that lets you go at your own speed. I love  all types of mystery games and so far this one is good one.
B009LGO88E|5.0|Monster Hunter Tri U was the final push that caused me to import this (because it wasn't for sale in the US at the time) so that I can have a free rotating camera. It works great and the added bulk - contrary to popular belief - makes the 3DS console more comfortable to hold; the lower L and R triggers negate the wrist pain of frequent trigger use. It's a better fit for the hands.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Read the whole thing. Didn't like it much. Would have preferred a regular story  in the traditional sense instead of interviews.
B009R659L8|3.0|It is probably worth more than 3 stars, but I just started it. I was frustrated with the missing pages etc. Go to your Kindle library<br />Anyway, on my Kindle Library Under Daddy's Gone a Hunting was a link that said \\"Update version for this book available\\" I clicked it and it LOOKS corrected, same font, no missing/repeated paragraphs.<br />Good luck!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Our whole family loved this movie.  It had exceptional acting.  Seemed pretty close to authentic from a historical perspective. and the scenes were so realiistic.  Highly recommend.
B0079M8R6Q|5.0|That this young man survived at all is amazing.  That he came through with the determination to transcend the horror of his early life experiences is inspiring.  I would recommend this book to everyone who cares about human rights, or who wonders about what is really going on in North Korea today.
B000VYX8PE|4.0|I found the story interesting.  It was good for an elementary school student who I read with.  Looking forward to reading the rest in the series.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|.........and that is a good thing as far as I am concerned.  I have been fortunate enough to have traveled England extensively and always enjoy a good read about areas I am familiar with and still have friends.  It helps visually but certainly is not a prerequisite to enjoying a charming book.  If I had one negative comment, I would have deleted the final chapter and left the &#34;outcome&#34; to the reader's imagination.
B00BI73CVI|3.0|That's about it.  It's a beautiful movie.  Maybe watch it with the sound off and play some other recording of Les Mis.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|its great so far, it fits tight in the port which I like. no wrapping the cord needed. I do recommend with power fast charger.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really like this game, I like the auto play and all the graphics. Don't know how this game could be improved!!  :-)
B004NOH9LC|3.0|This was overall a pretty good movie and I love Rachel McAdams. The only thing was it moved a little slow for my liking. I would probably watch it again if I was bored.
B000FBJFSC|3.0|The book is vey well written, but just too depressing.  What an awful Childhood to go through.  None of us can imagine living in that kind of poverty.  The ending was a little disappointing.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Mainly its about the cases and the twists and turns. But very well developed characters, and you have to love Eli Gold and Sweeney
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As good as all other Horsham books. I don't know why this stupid device says Horsham. I wrote Horsham. Not Horsham.
0525478817|5.0|This book is an amazing read!! It makes you laugh and it makes you cry all in one. I definitely recommend it to anyone!
B00881PTRC|4.0|I haven't gotten hung yet, so I'm thinking maybe they've made it too easy. It's a fun time killer though.
B002722R64|5.0|Pierce Brosnan is probably the second best James Bond next to Sean Connery. Femika Jensen makes her debut in this movie.<br />lots of action and toys for destruction. Good Bond movie. Lots of action and adventure!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It just blew my mind the way it was written. I'm still having problems figuring out how the are adapted it. But with Brad they are sure to have a hit.
B00846REIS|1.0|This book is a horribly written knockoff of Fifty Shades. Do not waste your time trying to get into it.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Lindsey Stirling is an awesome violinist!  I love her music.  I listen to it while driving and at home also.
B001LF3YQK|1.0|I wanted this because of the strap and easy access to the wipes via the red slide button.  However, it is large and bulky and when strapped to my diaper bag, it bangs against it loudly.  Worst of all, it dried out my wipes in just a few days.  Yes, the slide button was closed all the way.  Very disappointed.
0812993357|4.0|I don't say this often about famous people, but Grace seems to have the type of personality that I could be in synch with. In the fashion world of drama queens and snooty people, Grace seems to keep her feet planted firmly on the ground. Though she is head creative director to one of the most important fashion publications in the world, she still attends the Met Ball in flats and little, if any, makeup. Coddington's writing style is quite approachable and easy reading. It would help to be familiar with the fashion world (designers, supermodels, and photographers). She shares many ancedotes about many of these people which could be done in a tasteless manner, but Coddington stays true and respectful. One of my favorite stories is when Anna Wintour (Editor in Chief at American VOGUE) had a cake made with a rendering of Grace on it. Anna, not pleased with the likeness of the rendering, stuck her signature famous sunglasses into cake to make the portrait of Grace more appealing. Soooo Anna. Another part of the book I love is Coddington's whimsical sketches scattered throughout the book which gave the book a personal touch that is rare to find in memoirs today. Grace also talks a bit about her creative processes, not in the depth that I usually like to pick an artists brain usually by, but its there: from her early days as a Vidal Sasson model, to her days making errors working for Calvin Klein, to her current post at American VOGUE. It's nice to get to know the faces behind the magic that touches millions of lives every day. Kudos Grace!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|Absolutely love these!!I have my bible study notes in one, recipes in another.I use another for my grocery list when I go to the store.
B009MYARIK|4.0|I like Sophie Kinsella books for fun once in a awhile, and this one mostly delivers. It rotates between the perspectives of Lottie and Fliss, two London sisters. Fliss has a 7-year old son and is going through a tough divorce, while Lottie is the younger, slightly flaky, sister, going through a breakup whose 'first love' suddenly reappears in her life. When Lottie quickly decides this old love is her soulmate and they should marry, Fliss goes into protective mode and tries to prevent them from consummating the marriage. Most of the slapstick-like comedy (typical of Kinsella books) involves the efforts of the hotel staff at a posh Greek resort trying to prevent Lottie and her new husband from doing so. There is more to the story, but I'll skip the rest so as not to spoil it. On the plus side, I liked both sisters, and was genuinely uncertain which way the story was going to go, so that kept me reading. On the down side, the comedic parts just didn't make me smile as much as some Kinsella books do. So overall, a light, solid beach read, but don't expect anything new or fabulous.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Band of Brothers is without doubt the greatest WW2 series ever. This blu-ray set is an essential purchase for any war junkie. The packaging is amazing. Highly recommended.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|But as you watch it gets better and if you are over 40 makes a lot of sense as far as life at 40
6304711905|5.0|Great Price, fast shipping and entertainment that keeps on giving. I love this movie. Great western, Doc Holiday steals the show in this movie.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|As many of the excellent reviews before this one have said, this is first and foremost a movie about a functioning alcoholic (Denzel Washington) battling his inner demons and coming to terms with his disease. It is NOT a movie about a plane accident with a heroic pilot, as some of the previews would have you think, although that is part of the plot. I think the trailers for this are a bit misleading, and that might bug some people. Denzel does play a pilot, and the story does begin with an absolutely riveting plane crash after which he is indeed portrayed in the media as a hero. But as the investigation of the crash unfolds, it's clear that the truth is closing in on him, as he continues to drink to excess and to deny it whenever he can. How he eventually faces up to this does make for some dramatic moments, and Denzel is brilliant, as are all the supporting cast. But the movie is too long, with several scenes drawn out too much, and others that could have been cut entirely. I docked a star for that and the misleading trailers; otherwise, I think this would have been a 'best picture' nominee this year.

B001UTW7QU|5.0|I just started watching Fringe a few months ago and was totally surprised how much I enjoy the show.  If a friend hadn't recommended Amazon Prime I would have never been able to watch all the episodes in sequence.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|This is a movie that I thought was done very well for ending a saga. The ending was beautifully done. Well worth that watch.
B007ZSBQYE|1.0|The game does not work for the GS4 it will start and I get to select the first screen for the type of game and then the game just shuts down.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Best thing about the game is the graphics. Dinosaurs are nicely rendered and the animation is skillfully done. The game is designed so that you can't really get ahead without spending real cash. Play sessions last only two or three minutes before you run out of money and can't do anything. Still enjoyable, but not something I'll be playing longterm.
B009MYARIK|2.0|I am a huge Sophie Kinsella fan. I own all her books and rush to buy a new one as soon as it is released. That said, I would caution you from rushing to buy this one. I was suspicious when I saw that this novel didn't have strong positive reviews. And so I read them--the bad ones, the good ones, and I decided to give the book a try anyway. Because it's Sophie Kinsella! Her books are always a fun read. Wait, not so fast...<br /><br />Sophie Kinsella's novels are usually characterized by their quirky, charming leading ladies fumbling along as they fall in love. Wedding Night takes a different tone, as the chapters take turns between two sisters, Lottie and Fliss, neither of which is particularly likable. The men they are supposed to be falling for? I keep waiting for something redeeming about any of them. It's basically an entire book full of characters that act irrationally, selfishly, and lie their way through scene after scene. There are too many characters, all undeveloped, which leaves the reader unable to care about what happens to any of them. This book is not a page turner in any way. It's not redeeming. It's awkward and uncomfortable and feels forced. Definitely not Kinsella at her best. If I had bought a paper copy, I'd be selling it right now.<br /><br />Bottom line? I know it's tempting to buy this book, but I'd save your money and find another summer read.
B001IWUZYK|1.0|Hi, I remembered some great songs from having watched Oliver! as a teen, so I got it from library for my 8 yr old.  Scenes such as the \\"Who Will Buy\\" street song and ballet - amazing. However, as a parent I was really disturbed by its cruelty and I am sorry I watched it with her. The music did not redeem it. The numbers are too long and go over the top to tasteless, every time.  The child abuse of Oliver is kind of Dickens' point, so I was prepared for that to some extent. The protrayal of Fagin is a mean anti-jewish stereotype. The Nancy-Sikes relationship is classic spouse abuse, with beating onscreen, ending in murder, great example for my daughter, complete with a codependency anthem \\"As Long As He Needs Me.\\"  We watched it over 2 nights and by the time it was close to the end, with Bill having killed Nancy and then Oliver gets to see Bill's dead body swinging below him suspended over the street, I was numb with the chagrin of choosing this for my kid.  My daugther is great, of course, she said, yes, Mom it was bad but there were good songs.  So, sure, no lasting harm, but my kid (and yours) deserves better. Please be advised, it's just too awful for kids, and by today's standards too \\"fake\\" for adults.  A personal favorite for many, obviously, but not a good family choice.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|The characters were intriguing from the start....more complicated and unpredictable, especially Nell. Creating The Fairy Tales as a shadow of the plot was not only clever, but appealed to me personally as  reminiscent of my own childhood fantasies. I literally &#34;couldn't put it down&#34;.  Loved it, loved it.  May read it over...........
B0058EBNAO|3.0|I guess I need to go on line and figure this out. Seems like a nice app but a little complicated. Have to wait till this summer during tornado season to check out the alerts. That is basically what I got it for.
B00BGIBVRG|4.0|This movie was fun and made me appreciate the 40's. Getting older actually does have its perks. Movie was light and amusing.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|its awesome. bring it back.this is the best series i have seen in a long time and want more. Please.
B005KELQEU|5.0|I was worried that the Kindle wouldn't fit to the case perfectly, but I figured that I was having a wrong thought about it.<br />It's perfect for my Kindle Touch!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I also have this on my Android phone. Love it. So easy to use and can be pass word protected!! Use both text and list. Like the color coding for different projects. Great!!!!
B007THA4FI|2.0|With all the raves about the Harry Potter books, I thought this would be a good choice for me.  Wrong.
B000005JA8|5.0|43 pages of comments for TMR - like it or not it has aroused an amazing response. How many other artists on here have achieved that level of reaction?
B00APUYWYA|4.0|It was a good movie! It could have provided more singing. It was a very up beat and happy movie!
B008I43DYU|5.0|Great little app. I use it often, large clear numbers easy to see. touch pad works great, I grap for my Kindle now .before my calculator.
B004TI5N38|5.0|I believe David Baldacci is one of the finest writers of our time.  His work is always tightly crafted with an excellent story line.  He certainly holds his own extremely well against other major writers such as John Grisham and Jeffery Archer.  I won't give away the plot by discussing it, but try it for a top-notch read.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|It makes your mind work, It is a brain trainer. Its good for kids any age. I absolutely love it!
B008D30K7E|5.0|Thrilling book, lots of excitement, funny, witty, love the character of the old man, very cleverly written.  His adventures were something else, very long.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Having the YouTube app on my kindle fire hd is convent and useful. You Tube is my &#34;go to&#34; when I need a video on how to do something from cooking to gardening.
B00AHSF4AQ|4.0|I got Finding Nemo. Its one of my favorites because its so colorful. This is much better than i expected. Verry happy
B004J4WLPU|5.0|WOW, I found this book really fast paced and easy to read with  a lot of twists and turns. It also was a good insight into the human mind.  Well worth the read.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|I only wish this movie was longer with more video of actually recording more songs! Very interesting interviews with so many different bands that recorded at Sound City!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I have a community group and need to keep in touch daily, epically this time of year. FB App on my kindle enables me to do that .
B001R0LOES|5.0|I love Liam Neeson and pretty much own every film he's ever been in.  This one was just fantastic.  I'm a huge history buff and Irish history is one of my favorite subjects, so my only complaint was that some of the facts were a little different than what I have read.  Other than that, excellent film!
B00BCZU8WM|1.0|After Futuresexlovesounds this is such a let down.  I waited so long to hear that he was coming out with a new album.  When I heard Suit and Tie I was SO disappointed.  I can not stand that song.  Then Mirror came out and I was like...YESSS!  That song is fantastic and very much like old JT.  So I thought there might be hope and I sampled the rest of the album.  Totally bummed.  Maybe next time....
B00C90T4QK|5.0|Really loved the old song &#34;To Be Loved&#34;. Michael does it like no one else can.<br />All of the songs on this cd are oldies but goodies.
B0041D843M|5.0|This should be required reading in every health related field. I don't want to put dairy and animal meat farms out of business, they just need to shift more to growing organic vegetables. Undoubtedly the way of the future
B00AB7HESI|4.0|It needs more maps and more freedom... More stuff that you can create such as weapons and food and other stuff
B009FZHYKU|5.0|First saw it on netflix but that site only has the first season! So here i am, catching up so that i can start watching it on regular television. Is a great suspenseful show! I
B009IEXKXI|3.0|3 stars for a good idea.  But too technological and boring.  Put it down.  Also the attitude, personality, and inner dialogue of the main character did not seem to fit.  Too \\"dude-ish\\" to be an astronaut.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Fun and educational. Graphics are great and vey colorful. Have lots of quests in the beginning but not so many :( in the higher levels.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is a really fun game to play. I really enjoy playing this game. If you purchase this game you won't regret it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I'm Sarah....  Susan's daughter. and I'm absessed with the game but the game has 2 problems 1....sometimes it gets discnected to wi-fi . 2 that makes it freeze but its easy to fix and I got the mocco shark but it put me back to the first shark and from level 7 to 1 again
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Denzell is always great in his movies.  I've enjoyed watching him throughout the years and will enjoy him in more movies.
1476734941|5.0|I would recommend this approach for anyone to try.  Many people today have developed fat around the middle.  It is a practical way to address that.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Good game had lots of fun playing it I enjoy the graphics and the fact they is very little freeze time on this game
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|How do you not enjoy a great sounding group that allows your mind to escape once in every blue moon.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Good game. Starts out fairly easy, then of course gets more difficult. I love the challenge & can't go to the next level until I get 3 stars!
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|I can't really day how the movie was because it started freezing before it was half way through.  After that it was a constant series of stop and go.  Amazon....refund my money!
B001992NUQ|5.0|The product itself is very good. THis should be the blu ray standard. It even came with the pink and gray slip cover.
B00BTLSURE|5.0|How do you not enjoy a great sounding group that allows your mind to escape once in every blue moon.
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|I got this for my grandson. It's a little bit if a challenge, which is good for me and him!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I really like this dictionary because it contains your social sign the Greek gods and goddesses and so much more.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|Love every song and all the lyrics.<br />This is the type of music i like to hear wail driving of to work and like always with the traffic, but some wow this songs make the time go by fast.
B005XOPEOU|5.0|Awesome group!!! How do you not enjoy a great sounding group that allows your mind to escape once in every blue moon.
B005RUUUAI|4.0|This show keeps you on the edge of your seat and always wanting to watch the next episode.  Good drama and lots of surprising twists and turns in the plot.  Can't wait for Season 4!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm going to be quoting this book for a long, long time. This infinity is long than other infinities, and I'm going to notice the universe.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cheap, time-passing entertainment, can't go wrong with this app and the cartoons that go along with it-you grow fond of the little chap thru both!
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|I had previously purchased a Rayovac lantern and really loved it so when I saw this one, which appeared to be very similar, but less expensive, I purchased it. This \\"Lighting EVER LED\\" lantern is brighter than the Rayovac lantern (300 versus 240 lumens), uses the same 3 D cells, and has the same features. I even like the fact that the initial push of the buttion puts the lighting level at 50%. You can push the button again for the brightest setting. I would definitely purchase this item again.
B001PEY9EI|3.0|As I browsed Amazon's collections of the purple music, I saw a couple of cover tunes and just had to hear the whole thing. The three-minute keyboard intro by Jon Lord would never be over before the preview. So I bought the disc.<br />The disc is typical of any bands from that era. Rare Earth's cover of Elanor Rigby
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was the best book ever I wasn't expecting petta to go mad and Finnick to die and Katniss to kill Coin but those are the things you can expect to see from one of the greatest authors of all time Suzanne Collins.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Nothing is funner than Cut the Rope, it's a silly, entertaining time passer. This version is more fun than the original...never stop making these! And it's 99 cents, trying to figure out how you could go wrong.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|I would recommend this app to anyone who wants to check out some great independent artists and their music. Excellent.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Slightly slow start, but then produces nail-biting excitement. Great acting, drew me and my family into the story. Enjoyed it thoroughly.
B004G7UTXG|5.0|This movie will involve you and break your heart. Robert De Nero's performance of the slave trader turned priest is nothing short of marvelous.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is truly amazing. Twists and turns all out through the story. I loved reading it even though it was a little Kentucky, it didn't matter. I suggest if you love action packed and a bit funny books, read this book of the series. Even if you haven't read the other books, this story fits is well enough with flashbacks when needed.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Excellent entertainment! The professor is hilariously quirky. His son, Peter is sarcastic and brilliant. Olivia, the FBI agent is a dedicated worker but a mystery in her own right.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I play every day. The daily tourney is a challenge, the rooms are a blast, and the slots are fun. I play on my Kindle as well as my phone, and enjoy the game both ways. Very aaddicting.
0871164566|4.0|This book gives the jeweler many options for how to use theur stones,(some which may have been stored away for a while}.<br />And the options make the stones look even better, and wearable too.
B007N85POS|5.0|Can be addicting!!  It's fun to try and find the hidden awards.  I keep trying to get all 3 stars.
B003TSE8K8|5.0|Was great. Really enjoyed it. Definately better than the movie. Good to read it again after all these years<br />Is always a hit with my class
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I did not like the fact that you have to have a facebook account to continue to play after the free lives are gone
B0095P31L6|5.0|Great - really great - computer animation, and a fun story with both heart and soul. It's a bit zen, which is where I find much of the personal appeal, but overall a fine film for all but the very young.
B006M4RN3U|4.0|This is different than the music I usually listen to. I usually like hard rock/metal and this album makes you like it with the drums.
B00BWL99L2|5.0|The composition and performance are superb. I especially enjoyed the orchestra versions in this expanded edition.  The vocals are beautiful.  Another awesome Epica production.
0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay was a great read...The book was in excellent condition when I received it...Great ending, good story-line, & great closure to the series
1938469003|5.0|Huge IPA fan myself, and this book is the definitive resource on the IPA and makes a good addition to any beer-geek or home brewers bookshelf!
0465068367|4.0|I read this after Doctors from Hell (about the Nazi experiments). This is not as interesting as Doctor's from Hell but this is about something I had no idea ever happened.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I had missed the first year of The Good Wife and I was glad to be able to see the beginning.
B003QO8TDC|5.0|Love this movie, 30 years of this movie and still going strong... A must buy and Micheal Nouri still is handsome
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great brain teaser. Would recommend to any and everyone.<br />  I picked this puzzle game after a teen recommended it to me, now i cant put it down at all. Great game
B00B2V66VS|5.0|awesome should download addiction sometimes but super fun there's levels and stuff and yea its answer so yea download temple run
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Great keyboard. Sometimes a little frustrating of you're trying to insert an unusual series of symbols or non-words (Internet forum emoticons, for instance) but overall a great user experience.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I find myself quoting that one should practice being kind rather than being right. Portrayal of family members interacting physically and emotionally with an adult with fairly significant mental health issues, I felt, was quite realistic.
B000002IR7|5.0|My husband loved this dvd.! He could not believe I found it for him.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Cute, not something I would watch over and over, but the kids seemed to like it.  Not super duper scary
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This has been the best book I have read so far. I always tell my friends to read it. Can't wait till losing hope.
B008RV5K5E|4.0|Animation was good storyline was good a little cheesy. would recommend buying both movies at once to get the full effect
B005PK57IK|5.0|We have watched 24, prison break, heros, fringe. We like good wife as rank one out of them. This series provide a bonding between viewer and the performers. My whole family is a big fan if this series
0375850864|3.0|I read When You Reach Me as a Read Aloud for my 5th grade mystery unit.  The students are weaker academically and were able to understand the book.  Since it takes place in the 1970's there are many aspects of the book that make it historical fiction.  For example - the main character's mother is competing on $20,000 pyramid with Dick Clark.<br /><br />The characters were realistic in the sense the main character has a single mom and lives in a simple apt in Manhattan.  She envies her classmates who have active fathers and fancy bedrooms.<br /><br />My students particularly enjoyed the narrator (the main character's) humor in how she sometimes acted at school and at home.  In addition to teaching the elements of a mystery book (there are suspects, red herrings, alibi's,etc.) it is a great book for talking about how friendships form, break, repair and change.<br /><br />I am unsure if I will read this book to future students because how the mystery is \\"solved\\" is a little unrealistic and leans more towards Science Fiction.  While it was a nice story, I definitely felt let down by the ending.<br /><br />There is some difficult vocabulary, but the plot line is simple enough that it could easily be read in 4th grade as well.
B00BHXUC8E|5.0|The Whitesnake line-up has been fluid since their comeback in the 80's.  Coverdale surrounds himself with the best musicians, much like Ozzy and Dio (R.I.P.) have through the years.  David Coverdale and Whitesnake are just as incredible now as they were in the 70's.  This album is a testament to the amazing talent of David Coverdale.  The band is of course incredible too.  To me any true Whitesnake fan not owning this album would be a tragedy.  Every Whitesnake fan knows all of the musicians on the album, their history and other bands they have played in.  There is no reason to get into all of the that.  If you are on the fence about purchasing this album, just do it!  This album is not for the new Whitesnake fan but all of you old guys and gals need to just get it.  I do want to give a plug for Reb Beach  however, his performance is !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! on this album.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|animation was very good movie was intense a lot less cheesy than the first. would recommend buying both movies at the same time
B005723JSQ|4.0|A very comical book; perfect for a light read. The footnotes are a bit irritating though, but not enough to not purchase it.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|Excellent period intrigue story which I and my wife tremendously enjoyed watching. Very entertaining and suspenseful without the need for violence and gore found in more currently released TV dramas.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|For the price, this backpack is great.  The only problem I have is that the straps on the side that hold my tripod started ripping away on the first use.  I am going to sew and reinforce them...hopefully they will hold.  If you are going to strap a tripod to the side, I would recommend reinforcing them before you ever use it.
B00BSBT8M6|2.0|Great special effects but too long and difficult to understand language or accents without closed captioning. Watch at your own risk.
B0043RGXJS|5.0|Buble is the new King,,,,anyone looking to replace their old archive of the Greats, you will not go wrong with Michael Buble.  Highly recommended CD as well as all of his other works!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|since the last update on my kindle it randomly pops up saying Bible app isn't responding force close all the time,even when the app is closed, fix and it'll be a 5 star app
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I watched it twice to try to catch all of the technical details.  Gorgeous!  Wonderful acting, Fascinating direction.  I loved it.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|This book was OK.  I liked the fact that it was set in Ireland, one of my favorite places and she did a very good job on the characters but it could have had more twists and turns.  But I read it on vacation on the beach and it moved along quickly.
0307949508|5.0|If anyone hasn't read these yet, read them!  The first is a little hard to get into but once you do, what a ride with unforgettable characters.  Read them before the movies!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show gets better and better. The first season was good . Second season far better. This season best of all three
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|It's an intense and emotional drama that will capture the past history of mankind.<br /><br />\\"In the end,  we will remember not the words of the enemy,  but the silence of our friends\\" - Martin Luther King
B0094M2S5A|5.0|The Bill Chill is one of the best films ever made. An amazing cast of actors (Glenn Close, Kevin Kline, Jeff Goldblum, William Hurt, Tom Berenger). Anyone who's attended a college or university can surely relate to the desire to see friends from the past, to share in the joys and sorrows of friendship.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I got this little piano for my Kindle because smokepipe your grandson is taking piano lessons although he is not Seen or used this product yet I'm sure he will enjoy it.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|The acting by Helen Hunt and John Hawks is superb.  Get ready for an emotional ride, with some relief by William Macy in his priestly role.  Mr Hawks performance is Academy Award Caliber.  The demonstration of love and respect is incredible.
B00BHWG0EK|1.0|I have been ordering the new Blu Rays as they are released, and I will continue to do so.  The upgraded picture quality is fantastic and the value added material bonus features make it worth it.  Here's what I don't understand about these newly repackaged DVDs.  I appreciate the new artistic rendering on the packaging, but why are they over $50?  The Blu Rays are supposed to retail for $119 per set, but they are never that much.  They're usually around $60 on release day and rarely over $80 at any other time.  Why would anyone spend over $50 for these newly repackaged DVDs when they could get the Blu Rays jammed packed with new bonus features for not much more?<br /><br />If they really want to market the re-released DVDs to people who don't much care for Blu Ray, or for people who don't have a Blu Ray player, why not lower these DVD sets to something reasonable like $25-$30 per season?
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|LOVED the book and while I was reading it I thought that it would make a fabulous movie.  I was not disappointed
B005S9EKCW|5.0|But this was a must have for my video library. I had a little trouble getting the UV copy situated because I did not have the proper accounts set up but once I navigated that business everything seems to work well. I particularly like having the movie available in the cloud.
B00BZBP44K|5.0|This is a well done movie: acting, directing, script.  More importantly it shows and describes a man and a method that most non-India-area people are not familiar with.  It is engaging and intellectually stimulating.  It will keep you watching even though it is not a typical &#34;action movie&#34;.  The story and filming are timeless, don't think twice about the year this movie was filmed.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|The puzzel level was relaxing.  I liked the increased difficulity of the next level.  I liked the challenge of trying to get the correct matches before increased in cubes.  I would recommend this game.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|ENJOYED this game slot. Just hard enough to be interesting, but not so hard that it is frustrating. Just needed to use the hint a few times.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Personally this was my favorite book out of the whole series I love it and have read it 3 times
B008NA3I30|5.0|A classic Michelle Williams Movie, excellent.  NO one could play this part like Michelle.  If you are a Michelle Williams fan, then<br />you will have to own this film.  I bought the DVD then bought the bluray version.
B0054LVP3Q|5.0|Familiar story but with a real cool twist!!  Had a hard time putting this one down!!  A &#34;must read&#34;.  Great!!
B00CHI5B7A|1.0|Please refund my money, worst movie waste of time. Could not follow,  could not understand the people talking, don't waste your time and money.
B006MW3V6U|1.0|I love the show, but am very unhappy that I can no longer watch on my android tablet.  I guess I will have to go to netflix.  What's next?  Is amazon going to take away my android kindle app?<br />MG
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|This shows people that Michelle was born with great acting ability.  There was several scenes she did with more emotion pouring<br />from her than any other actress I can think of, and this was the first season when she was only 16.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Sheryl may be transforming our business and communication tools in her work with Google and Facebook. In writing Lean In she is influencing the cultural and social conscious and unconscious of our personal and professional lives. Sheryl touches hearts and minds by speaking to the inherent need of all people to be seen, heard and appreciated in myriad ways. The book addresses, in a compelling fashion, the societal, policy and individual changes needed to more fully realize the talents of men and women for the sake of human progress.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Definitely an entertaining puzzler! For anyone who is tired of the same old game with a dry, trite storyline, this is your breath of fresh air. The Room is fascinating and fun - highly recommended and cannot wait for the next chapter!
B00AYM6JFO|4.0|Very good; a little mellow. would have liked  1-2 tracks with more zip to them but overall - great Willie as always.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Great game.  Just wished that it allowed you to play more frequently in the free version.  Five times is not sufficient.
B00881PTRC|5.0|Easily to play. Love the animation. My son and I will try to out score one another. I've got him hooked too.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|I don't think it has everything I need with regard to searching, probably because it is on my kindle. On the kindle, Google has only categories. It's not like the real Google on the internet.
B008KMHFJY|4.0|I thought the start to this book was great, and overall through the story I really enjoyed the connection between Abby & Travis. However I did feel like the book dragged out a bit with a bit too much drama between the couple. I would also like to see a spin off with Shepley & America. Great names too.<br /><br />Overall an enjoyable read and I would recommended this one.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Easy to play at the beginning but as the game progresses, the diamonds come down more quickly and I often can only get three diamonds at a time instead of a string of them which is worth more points.
B003BA4CAU|5.0|Cute feel good movie. Ireland has always intrigue me so I am draw to the Irish brogue and country scenery.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love it neat to play!kids would love it! I hope you all love enjoy it! get it now oh and it loaded great on the kindle fire!
B00BI745AA|5.0|Very good movie and the streaming was perfect from Amazon video. I used a PS3 and I had no problems with sound or video
B0063GORYU|2.0|What can I say.  The Spider Solitaire from Brainium is really the one I had hoped to get when I ordered this one.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I think that it is a good game but it was different I saw pics of the mine and then I can almost never get in the mine.
1476733953|5.0|It has been a long time since a book as gripped me so completely as Wool [1-5]. I could NOT put it down and finished it in one sitting. I was speechless at the ending of just the first part which itself is worth the full price of this book. I can't remember the last time a twist has caught me by surprise like that. I knew *something* was coming and it still blind-sided me!<br /><br />I look forward to more from Hugh Howey!
0425252868|5.0|I don't write reviews.  I now make the exception.<br /><br />I am a retired US Army officer, combat veteran, two years in Vietnam. Since I was 16, I have seriously researched and studied military history as both a hobby and a passion.  Of all the outstanding military related books I have read over these many decades, this one ranks in the top 10.<br /><br />This book should be mandatory reading for every cadet at our military academies! It should be on the USMC Commandant's Professional Reading list!  It should simply be read by every American military officer and non-commissioned officer! It is one of the most outstanding books I have ever read about leadership, character, and honor!<br /><br />While the book contains some of the most vividly descriptive text of WWII aerial combat (North Africa, Sicily, the Mediterranean, and much of Europe), and provides outstanding examples of superb leadership - - the heart and soul of the book is about honor and moral character exhibited under the most trying and difficult circumstances.<br /><br />I found it extremely difficult to ever put the book down. To say it is a \\"page turner\\" is too soft a term.  It is riviting!<br /><br />Read the book.<br /><br />Buy it. Borrow it. Get it from your library.<br /><br />But, read it!
B00ANGSSWS|4.0|My 11 year old loved this CD, I can't tell you how many times in the house and on car rides we have had to listen to this CD. I recommend it to anyone who has a kid that loves this group.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|this book was great if you have watched the movie then you so should read them book.they are very similar but the book is more descriptive
B007VUCAVO|5.0|A great app that is intuitive, easy to use and view.  Customizing it was breeze. It's usually the first app I tap, to ensure I have enough power.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Enjoyed, but little bit simple for grown-up. Challenges for kids :) my nine year old loves this game. If you like Tetris games you will probably like this.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I grew up playing Oregon Trail a long time ago and loved it then.  It's an adventure game where you travel with your family and you and your family have to survive life circumstances.  You get to build your own town, chop down trees, build houses, stores, hunt for food, make your very own garden.<br /><br />Overall it's a pretty cool game.
0316066524|3.0|\\"Infinite  Jest\\" feels very nearly infinite when you're reading it, and if there's a jest here, it's on the reader. If you manage to stick with it, you will finish with no sense of closure, no conclusion. But you will come across--on occasion--great wit, clever writing, wonderful use of language, highly believable dialogue. The problem is, the occasions are too few. And they are interrupted by long passages of no discernible value or interest and by great excursions into an almost bewildering variety of subject matter. If you want to know about tennis schools for teenagers, you'll learn everything you need to know here. If you're interested in AA, you'll find heart-rending passages that will make you feel you've lived through alcoholism and drug use. If you're interested in the effects of drug use, and different types of drugs, you'll learn all about that here. But you'll also find a writer who doesn't give a good God damn about his reader, who is spectacularly self-indulgent and insistent on delivering great volumes of trivia with no relation to plot or character. It would be a cinch to cut the book by a third, which could be done without losing anything of value. It is a tremendous imposition on anyone who picks it up. It's like plowing 100 acres in hopes of getting a crop and coming up with a half a dozen bean stalks.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! I could not stop reading it! I can not wait to read the next two and watch the movie again!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|A good show! I enjoyed the movie! A good final conclusion to the Dark Knight. Yet the movie leaves an opening to another episode. This time with Robin! Lets wait and see.
B003ZMF26W|4.0|I returned this item only because I had NO success in getting it to work with my Macbook.<br /><br />Operating System vers:<br />OSX 10.8.3<br /><br />This Mouse worked great with my Windows XP, however my pc is not my gaming computer so it was useless to me.<br /><br />If you want this for mac it works, but not all the buttons will be configurable (which if your like me is why you purchased this mouse.) It will plug and play with Mac, and talk to Games like WoW, Minecraft, Wolfenstein ET. So if you don't care about the all the buttons working, go for it.<br /><br />Ended up going with Razer DeathAdder 2013, works great, no problems since day 1. Never registered or installed anything, plugged and play.
B00BCZUAE8|5.0|Great album overall even though some songs are better than others. Smooth, enjoyable listen start to finish.  Glad JT is back!
B0093FNZT6|5.0|An amazing insight into what may be in store for us all.  No harm ready about the possibilities of what might be.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book!  I have read it for the second time! I will  probably read it again, it is that good!  I love the chemistry between them both. I love that she wants him but under her terms!  Can't wait to get started on Fifty Shades Darker!!! Fantastic!!
B008K8VDPU|2.0|I HAVE NOT HAD A LOT OF TIME TO USE THIS  APP BUT WITH MORE AND MORE RETURNS TO PLAY I WILL LIKE IT EVEN MORE.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|His books have a lot of action I recommend this book to anyone who likes reading or who likes greek and roman mythology
B002NNA9N0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie plus AL PACINO IS IN IT! It's a post modern film challenging the threshold of the morality of salesmen. Spinning these tales to make a sale. The men use power plays of vulgar language to emasculate others to show there dominance towards each other. I recommend reading the play as well. The movie adaptation is very true to the play which is splendid. I hate seeing films making extreme diversions from a book and ruining it. I loved the song playing at the end of the credits to it was so nice. Jack Lemmon's character will break your heart and Alec Baldwin's ball busting scene is awesome. Bravo!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Wonderful, engrossing and beautifully written! A masterpiece! I thoroughly enjoyed every part of the book, and read it in two days!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This is a fantastic read and for anyone that's likes suspense thrillers with plenty of twists this is the book for you. It is written in a different style with flash backs from the primary characters that will leave you guessing until the very end. A great read
B0006AAS5G|5.0|nice watch, worth the money, the winding mechanism feels a little flimsy, it feels like its gonna break everytime  i adjust the time, but hasn't broken.
B00124LYHQ|5.0|I absolutely loved this film. I do recommend reading the play support books BUT this film adaptation is pretty close to the book. Its an exciting film. The dynamics between the characters are very interesting. A young Marlon Brando is always a plus as well.
B00C3V5TTQ|3.0|There are two or three songs that stick in your head, and the rest range from forgettable to somewhat annoying.  The Future Will Be Silent and Atomic Ranch both got old before the first playing was even through.  In spite of the cover art, this is no Dazzle Ships.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This ap has proved to be a lifesaver for my children.  My three youngest have a hard time relaxing at night and this really does the trick.  They loaded it on their ipods and my five year old uses my kindle.  This ap is eay to use and allows you to choose a combination of sounds.  Fabulous!!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I have played this before on my cellphone, but enjoyed it so much, I added it to my Kindle and started over just for kicks.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Lots of pages but well worth the effort of reading it.  I am a big fan of Ken Follett but this is one of his best books.  Can't wait for the next book in this trilogy.<br />Terry
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Great historical fiction novel.  Chosen by my book club for this months read and a great book.  Love it. Would recommend it to others as a reminder of just how people lived.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This book was not quite what I expected, but still a good read. It is very dark and very twisted so be warned.
B00B6CUO6Q|3.0|I just got my dvd's and the quality of them is awful.  There is jumping and skipping every few minutes.  They're a little distressing to watch.  Are these authentic or bootleg?
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|If we had more Americans like Adam Brown, we would have no need for the TSA. We need to take a lesson from a hero.
B0011X9S3K|3.0|The Busch Quartet perform brilliantly, but the overall impact of these discs is diminished by their sounding so \\"recorded,\\" certainly not discs to dazzle with the sonics.  Everybody should give these a listen for their historial significance, but you might not return to them very often.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I know one of the reasons I liked the movie so well--the music!  So much of this fit in so well with the script.  Beautiful!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This series is addictive. After watching season one on Netflix, I couldn't wait for season two. Netflix still doesn't have it. Thank goodness for amazon prime. I love the pace of Downton Abbey, the colorful characters, and peaking into the lives of the wealthy and those that serve them.  The acting is so good, I feel like I really know the characters. Why can't American TV be this good?
B00821PCJS|4.0|I liked it.  Will continue watching it.  Only on season one and a few episodes but so far so good
B004LWZWBU|5.0|I liked it better than the Book! I also enjoyed slop-moing through the bird pictures at the end! And pausing at a lot of them!
B003CFBQBW|4.0|I got this CD the same time as I got the Breaking Dawn Part One CD which I love.  Maybe I'd like this a bit more if I didn't have that one to compare it to, I don't know.  Just like more songs on that one than I did on this one.  Still has the overall feeling of the movie to it and that was what I was going for.
B003Y5H51K|5.0|GOOD WRITING GOOD STORY AND UNBELIEVABLE  CAVES. TOTALLY IN AWE OF THESE HEROIC PEOPLE WHO RISK THEIR LIVES TO FINE OUT WHATS WITHIN OUR EARTH. AMAZING.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|Great purchase for my granddaughter she play with her little brother now building towns of Legos .Its great the blocks and features are pink for gardens and flowers for the kids to build with .
B000IZA9NU|5.0|I have always loved this movie. I love the interaction of the actors, and how they embrace the futuristic concepts well. They really know their craft! :-)
B00B6QXN56|5.0|I saw Joe Bonamassa on PBS for just a few minutes and I was taken with his sound and had to have this!  I didn't read very well when I was ordering and so I was very pleasantly surprised that it was a TWO disc set!  So far I've played them at work, at home, and in my car.  I've even given them to a friend for his birthday....
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|I love all kinds of music, mostly country but JT has always been a favorite of mine since NSYNC (yes, I saw them in concert in 98 and screamed myself hoarse). I was kind of surprised looking at the track listing and the shortest song is just under five minutes long and seven are over seven. I listened to 20/20 while riding my bike and it made my workout fly by. I love the vocals, the beats, the whole package. \\"Strawberry Bubblegum\\" is probably my favorite, the synth work is amazing, very 80s. \\"Blue Ocean Floor\\" is the chillest, I could listen to it over and over again and just feel my stress melt away. \\"Let the Groove Get In\\" and \\"Mirrors\\" are also standouts, but there is really not a bad song on here. JT continues to evolve and push the envelope creatively. Don't stop bro.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|There is no other voice like Leonard's. his poetry is great and the tone of his voice in later years is what attracts me to his music.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I cannot believe nobody has ever mentioned this book to me!  This is a classic, one of which I have never been privy.  I began reading the book and loved it so much I gave it to my 12 year old. When she caught up to the place where I had left off, we began to read a few chapters each day at the same pace so that we could discuss the story.  How cool was it to discover the garden and the characters together!  It was also great to read with her because the language is so very different from modern day English, not to mention, a thorough explanation of the word 'queer' was in order!<br /><br />LOVE LOVE LOVE my Kindle for this ability to read one book across many devices!  Highly recommend this to any child or adult!
B00APUYN0I|5.0|We rented this on a Friday night and we both would have watched it again Saturday.<br />She even borrowed the soundtrack from a coworker.
B0011V7P0A|5.0|here near canada, they are an international favorite; all the FM stations play these songs. my collection wouldn't be one without this album of best hits. a must.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I purchased Live in London after attending Leonard Cohen's concert in Tampa FL in March of 2013.  I have had many &#34;favorite&#34; singers in my lifetime but none measure up to the One and Only Leonard Cohen!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|A well written and well acted drama that holds your interest through out. It shows that in the early 1900's in England there was a &#34;class&#34; system within both the upper as well as the lower classes.
B00406O7YK|4.0|This is Barbara Streisand at her best. This is a very comfortable movie and I like this kind of movie.
B008602KQI|4.0|Good show and high quality....great cast and follows the book pretty well.  I thought the book was probably better though.
B00005Q45W|5.0|Ten New Songs is the second of many cds to come in my music library.  My wish is that I had learned of him many years ago.
B00BYKIKJS|1.0|I was so looking forward to watching this Academy Award-nominated movie tonight, and it was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. Poor acting (including DeNiro), bad plot, and sub par cinematography. I would have stopped watching it, except that I paid for it and felt obligated to see it through to the end.
B000YKE87W|5.0|He is the best of today's tenors!  His repertoire is unique and very easy on the ears and the heart,
B009CUWG06|5.0|I am not a critical person; I love big books; and I really love trilogies.  Service superb and totally satisfactory.
0374531269|5.0|Ishmael Beah's story is worth the read. A Long Way Gone gives readers a first hand look inside of the life of a child soldier, forced to be separated from home and be surrounded by violence. Taking place in Sierra Leone, warfare is impossible to escape. Ishmael takes you on a heart wrenching journey starting with being torn from his family and then having to survive on his own with courage and strength. A Long Way Gone is the closest you will get to \\"experience\\" what is going on in Sierra Leone and many other countries in Africa. The hard ships, a then 12-year-old, Ishmael had to witness is something no one should have to witness in their entire lifetime. Being exposed to drugs, rape and murder, this book is a dark read, but it's real. This book not only brings awareness of this problem of child soldiers in Africa, but opens our eyes to see that life over there is not so different from everywhere in the world. Ishmael's fight for freedom, although his is much more intense and horrifying, is a concept many can relate to with their own personal lives. Ishmael Beah's story enlightens readers on the reality of what some children are having to face in some of Africa's countries and brings awareness to the need of change in Africa.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I was hesitant to get this movie.  Based on the reviews, I gave it a try and I am glad I did.  The Hobbit is just as entertaining as Lord of The Rings.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Cute, quirky, good show overall. Am surprised I didn't know about this show which is about to be in it's 3rd season
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|All Lee Child Reacher novels have been good this one no exception, hard to put down. First digital book I have read on the Samsung Note 11 found it worked well and a lot more convenient than on my tablet.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I watched this of course many years ago when it first came on PBS.  When I found it on Amazon I watched it again and it was still excellent.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I would get this again, but only rent this.  This is a movie that you can only watch once or else it will get boring.  It was good, but predictable.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Although somewhat long, I couldn't put the book down.  Led me into a story that was a little fantasy mixed with some well known facts that really kept me interested.  Good read.
B00122KW0I|5.0|Is there anybody on planet Earth who -hasn't- seen the Lord of the Rings trilogy and been carried away not only by the scenery, but also the epic soundtrack?
0374531269|5.0|I am fortunate enough to live in America where the land is surrounded by oceans, and war is not often experienced at home.  Therefore, after reading Ishmael Beah memoirs, A Long Way Gone, my perception of the war changed drastically, I was able to vividly see what the war does to people and how it robs children from their childhood.  Ishmael does a great job in the description of the events that happened during the Sierra Leon civil war, it allowed the reader to connect in a way that allowed one to feel the pain and fear they went through. Many of these children were separated from their families and some even experience seeing their family being beaten while other soldiers rape their sisters.  These images were strong as a reader, and I can only imagine how hard it could have been to have lived it.  Most of these methods were used to desensitize these children, along with drugs and war movies.<br />What also stood out to me was that as most wars the civilians did not have a clear idea of what was being fought for, or the politics behind the war.  The children felt like they needed to avenge their family.  For many of these children, the military became part of their family and breaking apart from it was very difficult.  The emotional damage was so immense that while in the rehabilitation center they were not able to sleep or cope with other people. An even person being nice to them was insulting; learning to trust again was very difficult.  Programs such as UNICEF, gave children a second chance, proving that children can learn to cope with such experience.  However, there was not enough national involvement that as the war grew many children were forced to go back to the war.  This is to show that with greater awareness and contribution there would be a greater chance to stop children exploitation. Overall, I highly recommend A Long Way Gone and I am glad I was encouraged to read this book.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|This is a spoof on Glee.  The movie has some funny parts and is entertaining but some scenes are just overboard.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|BAM<br />This is a very good resource for a sudy of the Business As Mission movement.<br />Plus I heard Neal Johnson speak on the subject as well.<br />This should not be the only book on this very important issue of using business for the main purpose of showing the Christ tothe nations and a Better Way of doing business.
B0060FXBNM|4.0|This is a blow-em-up action trilogy about space robots that can turn into cars.  Once you get past that silliness and the fact it is geared to sell toys, it's actually a pretty good series of movies if you want some feel-good action.  The first one is the strongest of the bunch with character development, the second one the weakest, and the third movie somewhere in the middle.  I wanted action movies I could bear to watch with my kids and this trilogy sates the appetite nicely.  Not the best plots or acting ever written, but the FX and breathtaking soundtracks are nice.  My only complaint about this trilogy is that the second movie seems to have a skip or something programmed into it, because it pauses and goes blank at the same point each time for a second and then continues on its own.  It did this straight out of the box and there is no sign of a scratch on the disc so I assume it was a defect when burning the disc.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This was a great movie by a brilliant director. I think inglorious bastards was just a screw up because this talent was laying underneith.
B0063GORYU|4.0|like to play sitting at the bar while having a drink or three Takes your mind off your worries love it
B00992CF6W|3.0|it is good but the multiplayer dosent work and the update has not come in yet. needs to update and get the multiplayer
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|breath taking in it's portrayal of her majesty queen elizabeth; a rare look at a woman who had greatness thrust upon her with no hope of having a life of her own; a regal woman who always did her duty ; a woman who was humanized after the death of princess diana; a woman who cried in private but never in public; a woman who represented centuries of royal tradition. long live the queen!
B00881PTRC|1.0|This game is beyond racist. A hooded person hanging? Wow! This game needs to be shut down. Its 2013, enough lynching!
B0035QUXWQ|5.0|I had never seen this movie. Dunno why! I get so many references now. I highly recommend this if you haven't seen it.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|I have a wireless HP which is on the list of printers that are compatible with this app. I wasted too much time trouble shooting this app to get it to work. In the end I gave up and uninstalled it.<br />I recently got the free app Printbot which works flawlessly and no trouble-shooting!
B0064MGU98|5.0|The characters were given some depth. I was able to begin to see them as three dimensional. Legal cases were interesting. I liked the subjects covered, seemed realistic. The resolutions seemed unrealistic sometimes but I accepted them as part of a tv necessity<br />Condee.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Ran fast at first but works perfect now ... I was told this might be the case. I am very statisfied with this purchase
B008VO3PA4|5.0|A very clever book with many humorous poems.  A must for cat-lovers.  (Although I suspect my husband got tired of my, &#34;you gotta hear this one&#34;s.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I simply love Denzel so perhaps I'm biased but I liked this movie. It's not his best, but it's a good movie. He of course makes the character believable.<br />Would I watch it again? Probably not, but I'm glad I did get to see it.
B000063WDH|4.0|Making an album of this quality in your basement, with only drums, guitar and vocals is amazing.<br />They show here that they are pretty unique and do things their own way.<br />Must admit i'm glad they added bass and other instruments later on in their career though,<br />this couldn't be interesting for much longer.
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a fast pace show and keeps yours interest and energy from beginning to end . Show has my thumbs up.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Ana stumbles into Christian's life. The two have an instant connection.<br />He introduces her to a new world of relationships.
B008Y79IUE|2.0|After almost 30 minutes we gave up...not at all satisfying the movie is filled with abuse and gross violence..<br />I DON'T NEED IT.  BYE...
B0000033RY|3.0|I bought this on the back of hearing &#34;Evil&#34;which is a barnburner, problem is that none of the other tracks are anywhere near the quality.<br />It's still a good album, but be prepared if you wonder about buying this after hearing &#34;Evil&#34;.
B003XNTTYY|5.0|Man, what a book!<br />After the first one this surprised me in ways I didn't even think possible!<br />Definitely a good, deep, extensive read!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Ana and Christian relationship has come to the finale.They are<br />married now and Ana has to struggle about being a top editor with<br />her husband as her boss.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I knew nothing about this story and I'm glad I didn't. I had no expectations. I enjoyed it so much it's now on my list of favorite movies.
B0066NA8CU|5.0|I have heard so much about this show but have never seen it. Then I gave it a chance when I saw it for free on Amazon Prime, and I am so glad I did! This show is great! I would suggest this show to anyone.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I honestly think this is the best book i`ve ever read! It's fantastic. I think the part at the end really brings the who book together! And i think that it was soo nice of Carly (jo) to write that note. thats what i think about the book safe haven.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Ana and Christian's romance continues. They have a volatile relationship that<br />becomes threatened when an ex of Christian's comes into<br />the picture.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Very well done; great acting and directing. It was very tense at times and I found myself on the edge of my seat. Loved it.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The overall story was excellent and sexual parts were interesting but by the third book, it seemed like every other page was a sex scene which got old.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|Extremely well done.  Beautiful location shooting.  Actors selection for characters is top notch.  Great story telling in the Masterpiece Theater-type.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is one of the best sci-fi books I've read in a along time. It does require that &#34;willing suspension of disbelief&#34; that is necessary for a lot of sci-fi. The lead character is smart, funny and a bit of a wise guy. He is accidently abandoned on Mars when the manned expedition is forced to withdraw and he is presumed dead. He spends about an Earth year alone on the planet and his methods of survival are, for the most part, logical and possible. Eventually he gets back into communication with NASA, and those conversations, and his personal commentary on them, are among the funniest parts of the book. Things go wrong and mistakes are made both on Mars and by NASA, and a difficult rescue attempt ensues. Good book and an interesting read.
B0031ES8P6|5.0|This is so sweet and adorable. my granddaughter clipped this Tartan beany baby to her purse and takes it with her wherever she goes. great price and brings her hours of happiness
B007ZSBQYE|5.0|The app is fun and requires you to be very precise. Controls are fine. The people who complain about them clearly never played car games before or need to learn to use both hands at the same time, like the majority of new games requires now.<br /><br />If you have no problem using two hands at once, like cars and can figure out basic controls without explicit instructions (i.e. press gas to go forward) then you will enjoy this game!
B002UWH8P6|5.0|I really wish it had gained the audience to stay on the air. TV without Stargate or Star Trek is depressing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great brain tester once you learn the basics.  I would recommend this game to anyone looking for something a little different.
B0060ANOXY|3.0|There were a few good songs on here, but many were just ballads to nowhere. I loved the fact that Jeff Beck plays on this disk and you can surely tell when he's playing. Nobody plays and creates the kids of sounds that Beck can on his guitar.<br /><br />I wouldn't got out my way for this one unless your a Jeff Beck fan as those were the songs that had some real spark.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|good clean action fun...this is a good movie for everyone.  Oh lord,  what else can I say -- I enjoyed it?
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|You have to follow The Following! It is riveting. This is can't miss television. Just when you think you know what s going to happen next, there is another twist! Just when I thought I couldn't watch 1 more show, I'm sure glad I did!
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|This was a great movie. If you are looking for something that has a lot of feeling and makes you happy after watching, this is the movie for you.  Lots of Feels!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This movie has quickly become my favorite. The characters interact so well together and there are many quick one liners that make the dialog fast paced. Every time you watch you, you just pick up more of the story!
B000FA675C|4.0|I read the hardback years ago and wanted the Kindle edition. I miss all my notations that I have in my hardback. Someday I may transfer these notations to the Kindle. The DaVinci Code is well written, an enjoyable read but definitely not all statements that the author presents as fact are true. Analyse and evalate.
B007ZSBQYE|1.0|This is not fun.  They make the levels way too hard.  You have to be perfect to even have a chance.  It really tests your patience.  Why would that be fun?
B0009P5YXO|4.0|My only complaint is that its build is rather cheap and plasticky. I would've preferred a better build toy. Other than that, the sonic screwdriver sound is pretty spot on
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Could have been longer though.  Loved the HO/point n click combo. We need more of this type of game. G5 and Big Fish seem to make the best.
B00005JLT5|5.0|Every April I force myself to view a video dealing with the Holocaust to remind myself what happened in history and what humans are capable of doing to one another. The Pianist fulfills this for me in as comfortable a way as it can, considering the subject and the music, of course, is excellent.
B00BI745AA|5.0|magnificent film.Should have been best picture. Hugh Jackman was clearly the best male actor--not even close. He was extraordinary.<br />All the actors were exceptional. The music was superb, everything--one of the best ever.
B00C90T4QK|5.0|Michael Buble does it again!  I haven't been able to stop listening since I purchased this album.  The mix of old standards and new music blend together beautifully.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This is a great story for kids who love technology and video games-which is nearly all of them! It has a fun, imaginative story line, great graphics and enough excitement for everyone. It did have some borderline language and name calling that most of us don't want our children repeating.
B000JML90Y|2.0|On the Origin of Species By Means of Natural Selection, or, *******the Preservation of Favoured Races****** in the Struggle for Life. I wanted to have the Kindle Edition with the full title available. The &#34;worldview&#34; of Darwin is highly evident in the subtitle of his now famous writing.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Waltz and Foxx are fantastic.  If you love &#34;Inglorious Basterds&#34; and &#34;Pulp Fiction&#34; you'll find this equally enjoyable.  It's a no brainer, entertaining from start to finish!
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|The robots are back!  We had to wait awhile, and endure a Tron soundtrack, but the dance party is now back on.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|One usually gets a pretty good idea of what they are gettinf into when you see a preview. Not so with this movie!  While the movie itself was interesting and had a good story line, it is DEFINATELY NOT for small children or for those not fully cemented in their faith. Our family ranges from 5 years to adult. Only one person enjoyed it. Kind of depressing. . .
1451695195|4.0|The author had a very interesting experience and it is worth the read. One needs to analyze and evaluate throughout, however.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Game will draw you in so you will want to keep playing it for hours on end.  Great game for everyone.
B005NKGEP2|5.0|This book was great! It always kept me guessing and had complicated characters. I would highly recommend this photo others.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|Probably the best Batman animated movie ever made! Worth every penny!<br />These time-to-time DC movies are much better than a whole animated series.
B00AYJCEVK|5.0|Darlene Zschech and her worship team do an outstanding job of leading us to throne of Jesus through this new worship album.  These are new worship songs, the church will be singing for years to come.  I enjoy not only having the album to listen to in the car and at work, but also the DVD to visually be spurred onto more exuberant worship of Christ.
B0086700CM|5.0|Game will draw you in so you will want to keep playing it for hours on end.  Great game for everyone.
B008K5T5AI|5.0|Fitting, in many ways poignant. Agqinst the backdrop of the Sublime, the author bids farewell to his outstanding Culture series. Thank you for the best science fiction of our time.
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|great album! living in muscle shoals area, i grew up listening to southern soul and Boz is continuing the tradition of the river sound.I highly recommend this album.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a wild train ride of a story.  Questions are still swirling around in my head concerning the characters & their motives.
B00A6SMN8I|5.0|I love Monster High! This is a perfect addition to my growing collection of this line of dolls and accessories. Can't wait to start creating my own monsters. Cool!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome graphics,entertaining, fun to play, exciting boards,<br />Cool blocks, I like how there a creative and a survival. It's awesome
B00466HM28|4.0|In short. I love it. I'm currently overseas and it's just the right size, and just enough bells and whistles to get me through.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This game has many different set ups, which I like.  Mahjong is fun but I do like having the different layouts for the tiles rather than the same one each time.  And it is free!  That is good in itself.  Thanks!
B008B68IV8|5.0|A no brainer to get this one. ;) She is also a part of the Scaris line and goes great with her ghoul friends. Been to Paris(France that is) :) so it was only natural that I got these.
B00CHI5F5S|1.0|We get audio for trailers and other movies. But we paid top dollar for this one and it came with no sound.<br />I looked for a place to get technical support and a correction but Amazon's site has everything but.<br />I will still attempt to get this situation rectified.<br /><br />If I can find a way to contact Amazon and get this situation corrected we would happily view and listen to the movie, otherwise I want my money back since the product has not really been delivered.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|Where do people like Scalzi come from? What life experiences creates the so out there weirdness that comes out of his mind  and onto paper. I give it four stars because of this. The book was saved and made worthwhile because of the last several chapters. He turned a mildly interesting book into a thought provoking self analysis of our existence. Can't help but like this guy's stuff.
B008KYOCA2|3.0|This is a free calendar and I appreciate that.  It is 'fairly' easy to navigate.  memoCal was just the perfect calendar for me and I'm trying to find one to replace it (since it stopped working!!--still don't know why!), so my review of free calendars is colored by not finding one I enjoy using as much as I did memoCal.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|What can one say about this series and season but that it is excellent.... one of favourite series. I think zombies and survival techniques all day.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|The songs on this album are clearly designed to make for great live concerts, with all the opportunities for audience \\"whoa-oh-oh\\"-a-longs.  I thought it was a lot of fun.  I am a lot older than the typical FOB demographic but this album was good enough for me to download it and, after three listens, I still think it is a terrific album to be played at high volume wherever you can get away with that; and also it will make for great concerts later this year. Have fun!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I had not wanted to read this book originally thinking I knew what I needed to know about Steve Jobs. However I was completely wrong. Walter Isaacson had me hooked right from the very beginning of the book. Isaacson&#34;s writing style Had me totally engaged in what i felt was a truly honest account of Steve Job's life. Never was i bored even if I didn't understand all the computer jargon. I truly felt I knew Steve Jobs the man and not a one sided version. I hope to read more books by Walter Isaacson.
B00015HVI8|5.0|We absolutely love the Stargate series and have been working on completing our collection.  It absolutely met our expectations.  If you're a SG-1 fan then this is definitely for you!  The packaging was exactly as described and the disks were not scratched.  We are very pleased.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This show is classic. Having lived in England, the humour and the life perspective is right on and makes me feel all nostalgic for England. The dowager is amazing. My family converses in Downton Abbey lingo. Probably one of the best tv series ever created.
B006TF6WAM|2.0|It is about a very ordinary middle aged man 'finding' himself. The book is almost as dull as its hero, Mr Fry. It must resonate with upwardly mobile lower middle class English couples in the suburbs who have lived together but have little depth in themselves and little in common with each other.  I recommend that it should be avoided even if given free.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|This not only had good action, but also a good plot and acting.  Very enjoyable movie to watch for a relaxing night..
B00402FGE4|5.0|We are fans of the entire Stargate collection (SG-1, SG Atlantis, SG Universe).  We got this set to complete the first season because we didn't have the last ten episodes of the first season.  Absolutely love it, a must for fans of the series.  Stargate Universe has a dark and more dramatic feel than the other Stargate series, definitely a more adult series.
B0064MGU98|4.0|Great storyline. Characters are true and developed. It's interesting to watch how they all cope and grow with the lot they have been given in life.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game rules!! INCREDIBLE!! I love it!! It is awesome! This is the game that you can't get enough of!! Highly recommended.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I had heard some good reviews.  I wanted a chuckle, but was not what i expected.  the more i got into it, the more disappointed i was with it.<br /><br />Stopped watching halfway through the movie.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple and easy to use, I was very pleased and would advise you to get it. The price is right..
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|couldn't load Adobe on my KFHD, it wouldn't load.  I guess I will have to contact chat help for this!
B00AB7HESI|3.0|I can't install the app. It just says that there was a problem and to try again but it still won't work.
1476734941|5.0|I actually haven't lost much weight but I feel healthier. My blood pressure is better and my feet never swell any more.
B0094K1QR8|5.0|Very good modern day love story. Natalie Portman was as sexy and sophisticated as always. The story almost makes you mad at the couple at first but makes sense at the end.
B00BESM14U|4.0|After enjoying the novel, I was hesitant to watch the film--the trailer was terrible. It seemed that the team had removed all the grit and emotion and replaced it with cheesy, fake acting. I was totally wrong. Each actor, most notably Permanent and Miller, portrayed their part brilliantly. It was a joy to see the characters I loved expanded in such a meaningful way. Of course, in order to make this movie suitable for living teenagers, many of the sexual and substance references (in the book) have been removed. However, Perks is still worth watching if you can handle a tearjerker.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|This game has simple rules that result in emergent complexity - a hallmark of a class of board games that we broadly call &#34;Eurogames.&#34; The best aspect of the game is that you can play with AI opponents as well as using a pass-and-play mode.
B00138CYD4|5.0|Only wanted a few tracks. But happy overall with my purchase thats why I gave it 5 stars. Definately worth the money I spent.
B00509OFE8|5.0|I really liked the original movie and the series when it started, but got bored with it. This series was so imaginative and creative it really didn't feel like a Stargate series. I just wished they would have continued it a few more seasons with the same writers.
B00AHQNHSY|4.0|Like any app there is virtually no help with it. I loaded MoboPlayer because I copied some DVD's to avi to play on my Kindle (not HD). Loaded the avi files, installed MoboPlayer - video worked but no sound. After doing a Google search to and clickin link after link I finally found a post that said you have to hold down the avi file and select &#34;soft decoding&#34;. I would have never found that with a google search.<br /><br />Once that was figured out MoboPlayer works fine. Just doesn't work &#34;as is&#34; when installed.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book!! It is so easy to relate too. Every person has had at least one break up that tests their emotions to the brink. This book shows us that even when one door closes, there is a window opening up to escape and make life interesting!! The book is hilarious and an easy read. I did not want to put it down! It was easily one of the best books I have ever read.
B000TERDNO|5.0|I lived the 80s and Billy Idol still sounds great after years of not listening to his music. It's like I've discover his music all over again........................
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Jessica Chastain is fantastic in this story based on true life events. This movie tells the story of the woman (and her team ) that tirelessly tracks Osaka bin Laden down.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|Despite the negative reviews I really loved this film.artistic, beautiful to the eyes and meaning.the directors put a lot of love to this film capturing the same colors and sets like the wizard of oz.i was not expecting to like this film when I went to see it, but felt a connection to the characters which is hard in movies these days.i will be buying this blu ray and will be with my top modern soon to be classics.its one of those films I will watch over and over...
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book was great the first time. I read the end in an airplane and cried and I didn't care who saw. I just reread my favorite parts. Great book.
1401924352|4.0|Heard about her book from Ellen talk show. The quality of this book is perfect! I mean it feels like the majority money I paid has putted into it's package. The cover is so fancy, and pages are really good for touching. Eh.....what else? Oh, right!!! The photos in the book are very interesting. And being honest, I can forget 70% content I have read from this book after a week. Does it means bad? No!!!! Because I love Miranda Kerr no matter what.
B000FC1HBY|2.0|This book of 4 jumped so often that I had to lay it down and try to remember who they were talking about.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is awesome. It is a fun game to play when you have nothing else to do. I'd give this game 20000 stars if i could. Just awesome
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Very helpful tool. I just used it to find a wifi problem of my home network. Very straightforward information. Thanks for the nice work.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|Omgaa so my bestfriend made me read the selection and i like died!!! its actually perfect💗💗 and then the elite came and i couldnt even take it💁 Its amaaaazinggg!
B00BJS7LHC|4.0|Great movie... A Quentin T. Classic! A lot of carnage, but the action is solid and reminiscent of classic westerns.
B001EBWITA|3.0|While a fun look at a catholic mythology based universe, this story cant seem to make up its mind whether it wants to be a serious religious film or a comic book movie.  Either would have been enjoyable, but the half and half nature of the film drowned it.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love talk radio. since I live in boondocks, sometimes I have trouble with buffering but otherwise it works great.
B00AZNEW5G|3.0|I accidently ordered the digital copy and didn't want it .I wanted the actual DVD,I need to pay closer attention
B00BGIBVRG|3.0|The end is unbelievable because the characters were so selfishly driven throughout there was no reason to believe they would or could suddenly change.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great characters, great storylines, great acting!  Lots of twists and turns. I appreciate the political and historical authenticity.  Very educational as well as entertaining.
B007R41E8O|1.0|I was not able to download ... the free app was great, but I wanted to purchase the app, would not download,  had to canel my order.  Very disappointed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is won of the best books I had ever read in my life. Asome next book can't wait to read it.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Definitely weird, but a good story. The dancing was fun to watch and my wife certainly enjoyed the handsome young men.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|What can I say?  I read all the books, love the story and appreciate the authenticity of the movie.  I've watched it several times now and still evokes the same emotions I got from reading the books.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is an ideal book for a discussion group. It is a total page turner. The writer has an amazing way of describing. You can visualize as if you were there. A must read.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|The HD was fantastic on the kindle.  The colors were vibrant.  It's a good original story where there is no prince, just a brave princess.
B004D20JP2|5.0|Artful animation done to Sergei Prokofiev's score.  My 5-year-old daughter was riveted to the TV throughout. I loved it, too.
B002O2THRO|5.0|A mesmerizing interpretation of the classic novel. This film is a must see for fans of the book and roaring 20's glamour.
B0053O89RY|5.0|Love this show; it's worth getting the show on disc to watch whenever we like.  Love the writing and Jay is by far the funniest character in this show.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was short and intriguing. Once I became accustomed to the diction the book read smoother. My favorite aspect of the book was its philosophical insights, expressed by the characters; Lord Henry in particular.  I also enjoyed the imagery. It was unique. This book gets 4 stars because it provided me with everything I like about Oscar Wilde's works, but at times struggled to keep me fully enthralled.
B002Z0TPFE|2.0|Pretty much another mindless Hollywood ripoff where they saved their money by not hiring writers. How Much money, relatively speaking, does it really take to hire real writers?
0880796863|3.0|The cards are a great material, the pictures posted are not much help in this view.<br />The manual is very simplistic, lacking much information, but overall it's nice.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Everything about Sons of Anarchy is badass. The acting is badass. The writing is badass. The soundtrack is badass. The characters are total badasses.<br /><br />SoA is a modern retelling of the Hamlet tale, with biker gangs instead of kingdoms.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Well I guess I like it.... but it would be better if it didn't need internet so yeah this is my review
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This book was much better than the movie if that is possible...I enjoyed it so very much so I gave it to my grandson to read, who is 10 yrs. old, and he loved it also...I recommend this to anyone who loves a good read!  Rosanne Bianchi
B008TMA1LY|5.0|Fun to play. Very addicting. My daughter and I both enjoying playing this game. Fast paced especially as you level up.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Great plot action packed sutter and his team of writers know how to keep the audience drooling for more. There is humor mixes with all the drama so there is something for everyone
1594135851|5.0|Hard to put it down after I started reading. The characters were really well described and the storyline was good too.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Unique writing style for our decade....loved it....always wanted to flip the page...Tricky title, wasn't drawn to it, a friend reccommended,it... A little romance, a comraderie, a club...great story based on a real live event
B004QNN1UI|5.0|If you're a Simply Red fan, this concert DVD is a must have for your collection. The DVD has all of my favorites on it and the setting in Sydney is beautiful.
B00A6TYCNQ|5.0|By God this game is a serious blast!!! If you want to pass the time and have a bit of fun this your game ;)
B009LMTDL0|5.0|The commentary I read before actually reading the book made me want to avoid it - I am a 62 year old female who has had many of these conversations over the years.  But pressed by friends at the Woman's Club of Minneapolis to read it and participate in discussion revealed there is still much to discuss and consider.  These times have not changed much at all!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Best Jamie Foxx Movie since Ray<br />Best Samuel Jackson Movie since Eve's Bayou<br />Best Quentin Tarantino Movie since Inglorious Bastards
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is amazing so cool teaches you a lot and most of the time I<br />Rd real life and it helps us because it does and oh my God this game is so amazing
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Decent movie.  Liked Jennifer Lawrence in her role.  Glad watched it at home rather than paying full rate in a movie theater.
0670026638|5.0|This is the best novel I have read in quite a while. I found the story to be lyrical and haunting and the characters to be memorable and touching. I loved the way the author so beautifully wove in recent and historical events and concerns including 9/11, the Japanese Tsunami, the dot com bubble burst, bullying, and Kamikaze pilots in World War II. All is lovingly and captivatingly intertwined with Zen Buddhism, questions about the nature and reality of time, and how we are all connected. I loved this story and look forward to reading more of this author's work. She is truly a gifted writer.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  In most ways it was true to the book, which I LOVED.  I highly recommend it, but if you are watching it with children be sure they are ready for it.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|A tremendous story that II originally saw in the theaters.  An epic struggle with the important characters who you get close to and like getting killed when in the embrace of getting home alive.
B007ZSBQYE|2.0|3D means that you have highth, width and depth. This is a 2D game with 3D looking backdrops. That annoys me. But what really makes me dislike the game is how terrible the controls are.<br /><br />You have the gas pedals on the right, which are really forward and reverse and stop buttons, and on the left is a steering slider. Since most of us have better control the steering ought to have been on the right side. It's terribly hard to control with the top down view and the controls. It's a mess and a quick uninstall.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This was a fun, beautifully written, engrossing book - one with fully considered and formed characters and a story full of surprises and delights. It's so nice to discover a new author. Harkness promises to be the source of many wonderful hours of reading in the future.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|I was expecting a regular gangland shoot em up movie . and what I got was a lesson in History of Californiw in the day.  Great acting and good retro ..did not spot a mistake in the entire thing  .
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Very good but beware of blood and gore not for children AT ALL... Usual Tarantino lore - if you like his films you will like this
B005IQZB14|5.0|Although I am much older than Cheryl was when she realized she had to do something really &#34;drastic&#34; to change the path her life was taking, I too can relate to that.  Her positive outlook on continuing on through the hardest thing she had ever attempted in her life, is a good philosophy for many people and many events in life......but, besides all this philosophy, it was just a darn good read.  Couldn't put it down.
B00AEBB9EG|5.0|I must have seen this movie about 20 years ago and loved it.<br />Hasn't changed! One of the best suspense/spy movies I have<br />ever viewed! Highly recommended!
B000HKYN74|3.0|Star Trek was all about a bright and hopeful future, but Season 3 takes a definite turn for the dark side. Having a single story for an entire season limited the range of story lines that they could explore. I'll still watch it, but is far from my favorite season.
B00985E3UG|5.0|IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET UPSET ABOUT WHAT FOOD COMPANIES ARE DOING TO US AND OUR KIDS--DON'T READ THE BOOK---IT WILL REALLY GET YOU UPSET.  WE SHOULD ALL BE EMAILING, CALLING ETC. OUR POLITICIANS AND PUT AN END TO PUTTING ALL THIS CRAP IN OUR FOOD.<br />OBESITY, ADD, AUTISM, ETC--LAZY KIDS, TOO MUCH TV---NO--ITS THE CRAP WE ALLOW THESE COMPANIES TO DUMP INTO OUR FOOD.
B00881PTRC|4.0|Quite a good time user. Had a few issues where it seemed to stop working on Galaxy Note (version 1).
B001SZ2Y4G|5.0|Tim Robbins and Jennifer Jason Leigh are terrific in this film. The plot is typical Coen brothers fare; twisted dark humor mixed with fantasy.  This film also has great performances from character actors whose names you will not know, but who are perfect for their roles.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Anastasia and Christian are working out how to live as a married couple. Christian still struggles with the fear that Ana will leave him, and Ana with the fear that she can never convince Christian of his own worthiness of her love and her commitment to him.She must deal with her own fear of loss in a very unexpected way! Lots of intrigue and more danger than in the first two books, a bit less of the whips and chains, mild B and D, but still enough sex to be interesting. We find out more about Christian's early years as he slowly explores his past. The end gives us a peek into the future and a look back at the past for a different perspective on the beginning. A fitting end to the trilogy.
1451675046|4.0|This is a great book. It is interesting and a good introduction to many areas of science. It annoyed me slightly how he would mention things and say they were either beyond the scope of the book or that he didn't understand them himself. The final 2 chapters also appear to have simply turned in to belief bashing. That is why I took off a star.
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|We saw Mr Mosley's BBC episode on our local PBS station and wanted to further understand his premise and conclusions.  Have been doing the 5:2 fast for about 4 or 5 weeks now and have lost about 5 pounds.<br /><br />The book contains the explanation of the diet, some examples of fast day menus and then the rest of it is testimonials.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The acting, costumes, sets, and even cinematography are all well above average in this series. I have to say I was somewhat surprised. The story is very compelling and it may be worth briefly reading about entail law before watching in order to have an understanding of the central issues. It's an obsolete succession law that I was not well aware of.
0553386794|5.0|Having watched 23 episodes of the HBO special, and read all 6 books, I started out loving this series.  But, it now seems that Martin is just writing for the sake of putting letters on a page.  He has added too many new characters without accounting for the original ones.  So many plots going on that we've lost the original plot line.  I am a bit disappointed with the direction in which the story line is headed, if there is one at all.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I really like the fact that this show is something we can watch as a family. My daughter loves how the fairy tales intertwine and it is thought provoking for the adults.
B00BJB2C8W|5.0|I am a huge OF/Tyler the creator fan but i didn't like this album that much too much instrumental for me and not enough bass for me haha
B004J4WLB4|3.0|This book has a strong beginning and middle - you are left wondering about this mysterious event that occurred, which of course is not revealed until the end.  The book flashes back to her past in one chapter, and forward into the present the next so you need to stay plugged in to follow the timeline as this happens throughout the whole book.  It definitively had me interested most of the time - this character was seriously damaged.  Without revealing the story too much....I just felt the last 100 pages or so were just plain irritating.  The character acted in a way that seemed unrealistic to me, making choices that just seemed absurd. The ending finally came together, but I'll admit, I was glad it was over at that point. I had had enough of the main character.
B005AZ1A7W|5.0|One can learn a lot about themselves by learning to problem solve from within. A quick read which can be done in about 2 hours.....read it more than once...have the highlighter ready the 2nd time around
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Season 3 of Fringe got good again... as far as I'm concerned.  We got a bit tired of the quick  and unexplained changes that Season 2 was throwing at us.  We thought the back and forth between \\"worlds\\" was good,  but were pleased that a majority of the episodes were in the \\"normal\\" Fringe world.  Highly Recommend!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Great game lots of fun! I really enjoy the new choices in extra helpers for points! Wish I could earn gold faster and not have to buy it!
B001ECQ4DA|4.0|If you haven't seen this show before you need to watch it. It is hilarious all the way through, with great characters and relationships between them all. Buy this if you missed the first season, because it will connect some of the dots that you are missing..
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Big time Tarantino fan here and I own every single one of his movies including True Romance, Reservoir Dogs, etc. This movie ranks WAY high up in my favorite tarantino films of all time due to how entertaining and awesome this film was to watch. I am glad Tarantino made this VERY long because sometimes i felt like I could watch it even LONGER if the movie kept going because it's that damn good! Amazing followup to Inglourious Basterds as I believe Tarantino is going to make one more &#34;period piece&#34; film which I have no problem with because in some ways Django Unchained amazingly overtops Basterds film because I LOVED the Inglorious Basterds film due to the writing and directing of course. When I first heard Jamie Foxx was casted as the lead character, I seriously thought Tarantino lost his touch but Jamie Foxx CLEARLY proved me wrong as I was amazed how good Jamie Foxx was in this movie since I couldn't figure out why Tarantino casted him but after you watch Django Unchained, you will see why. Just buy this damn movie, you won't regret it!
1601251505|5.0|Love the book.  Was easy to read and the information was easy to find.  I would reccomend this book for anyone.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I was intrigued by all the episodes. there were questions and action upon every turn . Loved it. can't wait to watch the other four seasons.
B005HSL626|5.0|My granddaughter introduced me to Fruit Ninja so when I got a Kindle fire, I put Fruit Ninja on it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game teaches you how to train , love , feed , and care for a horse. The graphics make it seem so real you can't help but love the horses themselves as if they were real.
0544002318|5.0|This book is full of helpful advise and healthy recipes that would be useful to a world champion or a common jogger. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get serious about physical wellness, and good nutrition. Eat and Run is also an interesting biography but, if you want to know Jurek's full story, you need to read Born To Run (which is a super book).
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|My daughter loves it. We recommend it to all book lovers. She is able to sample the books first. Awesome!
B00683JLXA|2.0|This games has a black screen but you can hear the music. It takes a while demographics appear. When I left game could still hear the music. That is the main reason I deleted it. It's just like angry birds but different characters.
B008NIS2SS|5.0|Perhaps not as quick silvered fingers of Art Tatum, nor the physicality of an Oscar Peterson, but a wonderful musical mind that rivals the complexity and color of Bach as a jazz pianist.  A treasure that you will mine for years.
B00683JLXA|1.0|I'm almost always open to remakes and small guy games. But this will not open on my new phone...not too impressed with that.
B0041KXG2E|3.0|This was initally released as Kung Fu Hustle. If you like your martial arts mixed up and confused different stero types then this is the film fro you. Unlike most people I don't think Stephen Chow is a genius, but he is smart. This film has a mix of comedy, adventure, crime caper and martial arts action. Most notably is some nice fight choreography ssections, But Chow takes from fight scenes of Kill Bill vol. 1, Fearless, The Matrix, Hero etc. He also mixes up some cheap special effects at the very end. I however am bias with the inclusion of some real Kung Fu Masters who play themselves by their styles.  The last fight scense might throw you off as its with Buce Liang whose  major style is Goju Ryu Karate as well as a Wing Chun practitioner.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Don't  expect literary proficiency from this book. But it is a real page turner and a very very romantic story. If you set the right expectations before you begin reading it, you;ll have lots of fun.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Awesome game. Kept me captive for hours. Could not put it down. Only wish it didn't. Go back and forth so much and would have liked more hidden object games. You will love this game. Now I need to go cook dinner!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show about the hired hands.  It tells about their lives and relationships. The owners of Downton are respectable and honest people with a great story to tell as well.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|My first time watching this series.  It is well written and the character roles are wonderful.  I find myself wanting to watch &#34; just one more&#34; episode knowing there will be a surprise.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|This is probably the least interesting of the 3 books. For me it fell short of exciting, but I still read it very fast. All of the volumes are page turners, so they are still good fun up to the very end. Without revealing anything, I must say that the one major plot twist in this book was really a turn off for me. But many things in this book are very very american (to the point that they are stereotypical) so maybe a great part of the audience will enjoy the outcome of the Christian/Anastasia love story. For me, the absolute best part of the book (and probably of the series) was the very last chapter which puts everything in perspective in a way. That was THE MOST FUN i have had when reading this series.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|Only had it 15 minutes and it's working fine and is fun to use. I think it is going to be very useful in making abstract sketches that i will later refine on my desk top computer then oil paint on canvas.  I am a professional digital artist and use many 2d and 3d programs. This app won't replace any of them but it will be useful and fun when sitting waiting for my food to come in a restaurant or waiting for my doctor to see me.. That alone is worth the $1.99.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I loved the season because I enjoyed watching it. I do not understand why I Have a requirement to write something down.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book demonstrated how one individual can have control over another. The wife wants to leave as she is physically abused as well as emotionaly. She proves to be a very strong individual and later in the book finally has a real love and a real family.
0345529057|1.0|I ordered the book last week and it was going well until I got around the page 184 when I notice the book was missing about 50 pages.  Its a total rip-off DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY!!!!<br /><br />PS you better have 20/20 vision because the print is very small and the ink runs easily.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|Wow! Loved it! So well written, I fell in love with Travis as Abby did. I was so drawn in. It took me less than 24 hours to read it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|If you enjoy books like Perks of Being A Wallflower, or Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close, you'll definitely enjoy The Silver Linings.. With a dark sense of humor, a light sense of humor, and brutal honesty, Matthew Quick successfully writes the story about a man struggling to overcome mental illness and the loss of a marriage. It's written so well, I actually felt like I was in the characters position!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|I'm not finished with the book yet and I'm wondering what crime Pat committed and why he and Nikki split up. Still have no clue except the crime he supposedly committed and probably their relationship[ was troubled in the very beginning of their marriage. It does hold my interest except for the Eagles Football games and his father not talking to Patrick unless the Eagles win. Strange, weird family.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I enjoyed the series very much  I viewed Season 1 and wanted to watch Season 3 but wanted to see this one first
B001EBWIRW|5.0|This is just  good entertainment. Always funny😃. It has been years since I had seen the movie and it was still just as great as the first time.
B00CHI5B7A|1.0|Where to start? Well, the story was generic, everything looked like a set and the acting was bad. I had to turn it off after 30 minutes, if I even made it that far. The only reason I even watched that much was because of Emma Stone.
B008S4FZHI|2.0|Not up to the standard of the early books. The story had a lot of loose ends, and the main protagonist behaved like an irresponsible teenager most of the story - very out of character. Not impressed.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|Quiet Nights is by far Diana Krall's best CD.  I enjoy it every day.  She is one of my favoriet musicians and this is one of her best, as far as I am concerned.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This app lets me do what I have dreamed of doing since Jurassic Park first came out. It is also great for keepinge busy trying to get all of my attractions set just right. Best app I have ever downloaded.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great quick  read with nothing lacking, drama, action, comedy and suspense, all on board for a fantastic rocket ride.<br />Should be a fun read for almost everyone even though some necessary expletives make it hard for some sensitive people who are not ready to accept such language. However I say get over it and enjoy the story.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Half of the fun of this making childish immature names for diseases sitting back and watching the titles pop up. The other half of the fun for this, is for Strategy game lovers.
B000SO7OL6|5.0|Diana Krall is a real artist, both in her piano playing and her vocals.  This CD show off her many talents.  It is great to listen to and relax and enjoy.
B005HSL626|4.0|This is  new game that my daughter introduced to me and I do enjoy playing it .  Useualy at night right before bed
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I'm not the biggest 007 fan, but the action in this movie was bar none.  There aren't as many gadgets and cool spy 'stuff', but it gives more insight into the back story of how Bond became Bond and his relationships with the other main characters.  Great flick!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|i can honestly say this is one of the best books i have ever read. the story is beautiful and the ending is just phenomenal. the ending isnt predictable either. loved it.
B003YWUTJI|4.0|Norah Jones has a unique style and a warm voice.  It is a very good CD.  I gave it to my son.
B006WQLH7G|4.0|so far I have not had any proublems with the security on my kindle.  I will be useing it more this week and we will find out for sure
0141324910|5.0|Great books for children's of all ages. My son is seven and he likes to read the book before going to bed.<br />strongly recommended
B0063GORYU|5.0|The spider game  is a great game.  I love playing it.  Multiple suits are much more challenging than regular solitaire.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My Kindle Fire didn't come with a wall cable to charge it so I bought a generic one on eBay but it quit working after 2 weeks. So I bit the bullet and bought the actual charger with the cable and haven't had a problem since.
0061998494|4.0|I am a similar age and was around the band scene around the same time in Glasgow as Craig so could relate to a lot of the stories, places and people. Additionally I share his love of all things American whilst still continuing to be a proud Scot. Its funny and well written so will appeal to the wider audience also regardless of nationality.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|this is a very fun app. this app is addicting. there are so many levels to play. this app is about the pudding taking over!!!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|No need to spend money if u have patience. Great way to kill time! Easy and fun. My kids love it too!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its a really fun game. however it wasn't what I was looking for. you cant ride your horse wich is a big hummed but over all it os a really fun game.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVED this book it was  super fun to read and I am a super NERD so this book was amazing
B009X01D9U|5.0|I ordered the Marware Revolve case for the Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; prior to even having the product.  I wanted the case so as soon as I received the product it could be put in the case and protected.  The case is easy to use and does everything they said it would.  I think it is an excellent product and the pricing was good also.  I am pleased with this product.
B00ANA27IU|4.0|2001 have been written during the making of the movie, and with Kubrick. So, apart from removing some vagueness, I think the first 3 parts transferred well to the movie, almost 1:1. But the fourth chapter is different, in a way it’s too different - and I think Kubrick missed, maybe due to lack of visual effects, or maybe he was too hooked to the philosophy without being able to present it. Clarke on the other hand makes the imagery better through detailed guided imagination.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|There isn't really much to say about a Kindle cover.  It fits well and I like the way it looks.  Has held up well over the few months I've had it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|It so fun! I think lots of children and adults would like it! It always keeps you going and your constantly getting money. The only hard the about thing about this game is trying to keep up with all the letters from people ,requests from the towns people ,and collecting energy.
B004CLYKLI|5.0|This book follows the live of a crazy Chinese mother, a calm, cool husband, and two annoyed children. I highly favor this book and this mother! I also recommend this book for anybody who feels like reading about one CRAZY family! You're awesome, Amy Chua <3 ! By the way, I'm ten and I loved this book. Although I'm glad that my mom Is not like the \\"Tiger Mother\\" in this book, I also play the violin, and value Amy's persistance and tough personality!
B00425S1H8|5.0|I found my self needing to hook up some ham radio equipment which used RS232 9 pin serial connector<br />as you know most laptops don't have a 9 pin connector only USB<br />this cable and a gender changer allowed me to not only connect to my laptop it worked with windows 7<br />which for what ever reason some other RS232 to USB cables do not.<br />If you have a need for a cable I recommend you get this one.
B005OT2YVA|4.0|triple A summer title w/ crazy cool effects and little substance.<br />Still entertaining.<br />No need to watch the first two films in the trilogy to follow.
0547884591|5.0|My long time goal has been to get lean & pack on muscle.  I used this along with the [[ASIN:B00BH6JNQS Gain Muscle Blueprint]] to achieve just that.<br /><br />The 4-Hour Chef covers a very wide spectrum of topics with cooking at its core.  It has tons of excellent recipes to eat healthy, yet still delicious meals.  I cut the cut food and fast food out of my diet and started preparing more good for myself, using this book as a primary guide.  I lost quite a bit of fat so far, and I'm still making progress.<br /><br />This book also covers a litany of other topics about style and life in general.  It's quite entertaining.<br /><br />In conjunction with this book, I've used the [[ASIN:B00BH6JNQS Gain Muscle Blueprint]] to hit the gym with a gameplan and pack on muscle.  It's working big time.  My body has changed tremendously in just months and I'm getting compliments on a daily basis.<br /><br />You can achieve your goals if you find the right info to get you there!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I have to admit that season 3 had me worried.  Like other TV serials, eventually the writers run out of reasonable story lines and start creating dumb stuff just to keep the show on the air another year.  Fortunately for SOA fans, especially those who weren't thrilled with season 3, the program gets back on track in season 4.  Lots of action and plot twists, but nothing so over-the-top that it's ridiculous. Fear not, SOA fans, season 4 won't disappoint!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Kept waiting for the characters to develop and then I waited some more and nothing really happened. I just wanted more substance!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|While I enjoyed it more than the book it is still a fairly gruesome tale.  Children on Children violence is certainly a horrible thing (obviously the point of the book/movie).  It is a good tale of perververence and compassion.  They did actually tone it down from the book and added a few things that the book only alludes to.  For example, the riot in district 11 and the unfortunate end of the gamekeeper.  They also did not try and give the monster dogs the eyes of the fallen contestants (something I was grateful for).  Overall, a very good adaptation.
B0000C3I6U|5.0|I found out about this movie from the [[ASIN:B00BH6JNQS Gain Muscle Blueprint]].  It mentioned this as the best bodybuilding film of all time.<br /><br />After watching it along with many other movies, I have to agree.  Firstly, it centers around Arnold, possibly the greatest and certainly the most iconic bodybuilder of all-time.<br /><br />A big difference between this and other \\"training movies\\" is that this movie isn't just about training.  It does feature workouts from top bodybuilders of the '70s.  But there's much more to it than that.  There's an actual STORY that makes you care about the bodybuilders -- Arnold, Ferrigno, Franco, etc.<br /><br />You get their backstory and you see the rivalries.  You see the guys strive for greatness and the battle to stand alone on top of the bodybuilding mountain.<br /><br />The film is fantastic and an all-time classic.  I've gotten really into working out & training and this is great for motivation.  Very entertaining as well.
B009NNG6CQ|3.0|Classic Woody Allen.  Unfortunatelly, Diane Keaton was her terrible self. The plot was very predictable and the acting was subpar. Overall,  still a funny movie.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|Why would you put a dictionary on a Kindle, why? That very stupid. That's why I put stupid. Just think.
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|While it does take some time to get into the flow of this movie, I really enjoyed it.  It is always nice to see the stalwart, dedicated, kind, and yes, neglected main character come out on top in the end.
0684857219|5.0|I wanted to get the no-nonsense, real scoop of bodybuilding.  I did it using this book and the [[ASIN:B00BH6JNQS Gain Muscle Blueprint]].<br /><br />I wanted to learn all the ins and outs of serious weight training.  I never stepped in the gym that often.  When I did, I was often intimidated by the bigger, stronger, more experienced lifters.<br /><br />To feel comfortable in the gym so that I could truly achieve my goals, I needed some knowledge.  I picked up the Encyclopedia of Bodybuilding and the title doesn't lie.  It truly is an encyclopedia.  Tons and tons of info in this.  Almost too much, if anything.  It's information overload.  But it's also a great reference to read page by page or skim through for bits & pieces.<br /><br />I used the [[ASIN:B00BH6JNQS Gain Muscle Blueprint]] to hone down a specific gameplan for my workouts & to understand how to build muscle quickly.  I'm making a ton of progress & my body is changing rapidly.  My friends are jealous and I'm getting more attention from women.  It's awesome.
B00AAKZPUK|4.0|I read the book first Five Days of The Condor and the movie was a good representation of the book!
B00992CF6W|5.0|you guys should get it.  it is the best game in the whole wide world what are for go get it
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I love this show!i watch it with my husband and children. It is an enjoyable show, I can't wait for the next episode to play!
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Loved the movie and performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. Would recommend the movie, we watched it several times during our 48 hour rental.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Great dino experience with great movie recollection. Great sound and activities. Water park was a great idea... where is the movie?
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I don't want everyone to see my post when I make a comment in someone else's, and that's what is happening now. I want only my FB friends to see them, not the friends of friends.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Just like all the other jewel games. The game is good, but tiring after a while.Need to have more things to happen to be interesting.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book was refreshing. At first the childlike lingo sort of threw me, but I enjoyed this so much it will be hard to top.
B00B7FWWNA|5.0|Touching and thoughtful story. So non-Hollywood in style and pace. Helen Hunt was very bold and brave to appear so completely revealed.
B00BAYLQI0|1.0|First let me say that I thought the actors did a great job with their roles, nothing against them, and I also felt the movie moved at a good pace, whereas I've seen other reviews that complained about it being very slow. What I had an issue with is this was an enormous natural disaster in which thousand of Thai people died, but this story focuses on one vacationing white family that all survive and get to go home afterwards! Think if this had been about Katrina, and some folks from Europe or somewhere had their vacation to New Orleans ruined, a few scares, some injuries, but nothing too life altering, and then they flew home. Oh how compelling! Add in the fact that the writer, aside from not caring to deeply about the Thai people, also seems to have something against Canadians and/or Americans. Anyone who had an accent that would indicate they were from the U.S. or Canada is a total piece of garbage in this movie! One Canadian or American woman even abandons these Australian kids--who does that?! No one, that's who. Pretty much only happens in the imagination of a writer with an agenda against the U.S. or Canada. Now if any of the Canadian or American characters had been nice, or if any of the other characters had been jerks, like one of the Australians or one of the Germans, it may not have been so glaring, but no. This movie was just insulting.
B00ARI9CDQ|4.0|Am very new to MailOnline. It's very informative. Keeps me abreast of current affairs an goings on worldwide. Best of all the app is free!
B003KRJNBW|5.0|I thought it might be a cult type movie but it turned out to be an action / drama movie with just enough twists in it to keep you thinking, but not thinking too hard.  I could have done without the Koran at the end but realize the point of saving all available knowledge.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Just got it and it woke me up this morning to some beautiful music.  Seems to be a really good product.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I used it for math.I also think it is great for other things too. This I'd a cool app... ya!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This second installation of the hunger games series has you hanging on every word just like the first book.  Very well written.  Can't wait for the movie!
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Best book I have ever read! Could never put it down! Keeps you on the effective your seat and allows you to drift away!
B00BBW16HW|4.0|Enjoyed the story of these two and the truth of how much, though different, in background, they needed each other.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much !!! This is the only game I play on my kindle!<br />.<br />You will love it too ,so download it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I may not have read this book without being aware of it via film reviews.  I loved the book.  It is incredibly well written, takes the reader on a real odyssey and you rarely lose interest in the character and story.<br /><br />I will go see the film based on this, but have no idea how it could be realistically portrayed.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Needs more letters not fin sucks love it don't like tuning good don't get it please have it lot of not
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am a big science fiction reader and I loved this book.it was a good story with good characters. It has a different look at post apocalyptic earth that I really found interesting. I read it in a couple of days which usually only happens when I really enjoy a book. So anyone that likes Scifi  really should read this book.
B006BXTOFC|4.0|Well, the Black keys did it again. This is a great album. For real. I'm not kidding. It is great.
B007OWRBJK|5.0|Interesting to hear his views and how it occurred to him.  What a mind, what a man , what a human.  Thank you Pete.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app. Works with great accuracy. Plus, it's really fun and enjoying. I use it almost every day and play it for a long time
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|Great story, high quality streaming in HD... nothing to dislike, and lets not forget that it comes from Steven Spielberg!
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I have always had tons of respect for the SEALS, I spent 20 years in the USAF as a Loadmaster on C-130's, we did a lot of work with them in Nam
B00005T7I1|3.0|This movie is so cool. The director and producer went to great lengths to make the movie look like the comic strip I grew up reading.
B008602KQI|5.0|Keeps you spellbound the entire move. I highly recommend this, however it's not for the faint of heart. It will give you nightmares.
B003PJ6UHA|1.0|Full of logical fallacies and annoying side stories. On one side, author seems to criticize quantum theory (and others) as being wrong due to being complicated and non-intuitive and because of constant modifications based on new data from experiments (that's kinda how science works) and what's worse is that all the &#34;reasons&#34; why the scientific theories are wrong, suddenly somehow don't apply to his own ideas.
B0012QVJXS|3.0|Just read a great book, &#34;Superman&#34; by Larry Tye that referenced this movie. Wanted to refresh my memory of it.  While it's a bit corny and the affective show their age, it was still very entertaining.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great read!! This book had me hanging until the very end! I still couldn't believe the ending. You will not be disappointed!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I downloaded the free first chapter and by the end of it, I was hooked. Bought the omnibus and enjoyed every word.  Very disappointed when it ended. Looking forward to continuing to read from the Silo Series.
B00BI5J9BC|5.0|I have never seen a more perfectly cast film! Every person cast in this musical was exceptional! It was like these particular actors were born to play these roles! LOVED IT!
6305922756|5.0|Spoof of 70s rock tour type movies like Song Remains the Same, etc.  Follows the ups & downs of Spinal Tap throught heir American tour.  Great performances, writing throughout.
B003M70O5O|5.0|This whole series has been exciting! While the material can become raw and primitive at times, the overall storyline keeps me interested. I can hardly wait for upcoming season six!
B005OZE9SA|5.0|Price and performance, simple to set up. Simple to operate - I don't use the software provided so can't comment but no driver problems, I wish everything just did as it was supposed to do as this did when it arrived.  I bought a second one afterwards for a family member..<br /><br />I should say that I have Windows 7, a 2009 Dell laptop and running it through AMP3.<br /><br />No problems whatsoever.  Go figure what others claiming problems are trying to do with what is essentially a great home device.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|This whole series has been exciting! While the material can become raw and primitive at times, the overall storyline keeps me interested. I can hardly wait for upcoming season six!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I wasn't expecting to enjoy this movie as much as I did.  My wife and I watched it together.  We enjoyed the reality of the movie, thought the singing was very good, and great in a couple of scenes.  Overall, it was a pleasant surprise, and yes, there were a few tears shed at the end of the film.
0374531269|5.0|A Long Way Gone is a tragic, gripping, and eye opening narrative of a twelve year old boy's hardships through times of war in Sierra Leone. This first person narration describes what it truly is like to be a child soldier. The events, drugs, murder, and rape seen through a child's eyes is excruciating to read, however, it unfortunately is not a horrific fiction. Children being kidnapped and exploited into murderers and killing machines is still present in Africa today. This novel is not for the overly sensitive or young audience because of its graphic nature. I do believe that this book should be praised for its realism and gritty truth of what is present in Africa. I am familiar with Invisible Children and the stories of child soldiers, however, I never knew was painted a more thoroughly horrifc picture of what is really going on until I read A Long Way Gone. It is important for more people to be exposed to this book in order to open more eyes to the tragedies taking place today. Instead of turning a blind eye and remaining ignorant, more time can be volunteered into research, assistance, and changing political policies so this does not continue onto the next generation.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Can't wait for season three!  This season was great, full of drama, action, and suspense.  I highly recommend this series.
B00190OHD6|5.0|This was a great movie.  A real tear jerker!!  Would highly suggest watching this. One of my new favorite movies.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season was so good that I watched the whole thing in one week.  I couldn't resist watching one after the other...great cohesiveness between episodes and great storyline.
B007SXB498|1.0|It just wasn't just interesting!  I guess it was becase it was written in English(not American English).  I glad it was free!
B006LSZECO|4.0|One twisted read! I could not put it down. One of the best mystery's I have read in a long time. Reminded me of the the movie in some ways &#34;War of Roses&#34;
0937381888|5.0|Move over Joy of Homebrewing. That's what I started with many years ago, but I'd heard everyone talking about this and figured I'd see if there was anything more I could learn and of course there was. Great for beginners and experienced brewers alike.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Exciting, suspenseful, want more Katniss, Peeta, rebellion and starcrossed love story. Onto the next! And I'm really curious about Peeta's baking skill. What would a cake baked by Peeta taste like?
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Very creative story and well written. I'd love to see a sequel and see where things go but I was satisfied with the story as a one shot.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The new update is going to involve online multiplayer, 0.7.0 version I recommend getting it soon. Date: late April or early May
1476719071|5.0|I read this book in about 4 days. For me that's pretty fast because I am a stay at home mom with two young kids -- I don't get much time to read but when I did get the opportunity, this book was difficult to put down! It was well written and the characters were not only believable but like able. Travis was the gorgeous, bad boy underground fighter that is the everything that Abby said she'd stay away from. They make a bet, Abby loses and now has to live with Travis and his roommate (her best friends boyfriend) for one month. This is where their tumultuous relationship begins, filled with lots of ups, downs, fights, jealousy, etc etc<br /> I read the 50 Shades of Grey series and really enjoyed it but if I had to choose something I didn't like about them, it'd be that some of the scenes seemed to drag on and on. A single sex scene could last 3 or 4 pages. What I liked about this book (Beautiful Disaster) was that it was fast paced. At no point did I feel like it was dragging on. You could feel like a lot happened it just the 2 pages that you just read so it really grabs your attention and keeps you wanting more. I'd definitely say that if you were a fan of the 50 Shades series, you'll like this book
B003730LRY|4.0|This is a great movie to watch with the family.  Some good belly laughs for everyone from grandma to the kids.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  Made you question what would you do if it was your child in this position.  Highly recommend.
B0094LZY2A|4.0|I love it that it had a lot of fun and adventure.  Great family movie for any family movie night.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The writing of this book I truly was believing to be<br />real. I could not wait till the ending. Will be reading<br />another of his books.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|wow I love this app. its better. than tempel run that's just annoying well I hate my kindel fire :(<br /><br />well gtg
B009AMANBA|5.0|I love this moive. Got to know the personal side of Lincoln. Daniel Day Lewis did an awesome job protraying Lincoln. I would get any movie that daniel day lewis is in.

B002OOG6RQ|5.0|I've wonder up with all of Rammstein's albums over the past month or two after listening to them occasionally for years.  I've fallen in the love and Liebe Ist Für Alle Da is by far my favorite album.  Beauty mixed with horror and grit, just awesome.  If you like Rammstein and don't have this album, you are definitely missing out.
B000XUBC5E|2.0|I finish it because once I start a book  I feel obligated to finish.  The twist an  turns were seen coming and boring.  This was my first read by Harlen Corbin, I expected more.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Enjoyed the cast and costumes plus the country sites. Pretty dark for lighting, however it's the underworld. This was an unexpected<br />journey. I especially loved the uninvited guess eating up house and home.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I loved the first  person perspective narrative.  I had seen the movie and like the book better.  You kept routing for him to finally realize what was better him.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|Do not get this app. It is really bad for children! I showed this to my daughter thinking she would like this but later that night she told me that she was having nightmares about it! I would give it zero stars if I could because this ruined my poor daughters life! Now every night she comes in my room and asks me  to cuddle with her because she is scared of the tom cat. I should have never gotten this app. Please remove this app for it will ruin our children's lives! Who wants their children to be paranoid over a cat? I certainly don't!
B0064MGU98|5.0|Julianna Margules nails it.<br />Love the tension between her loves, Peter, Will and work.<br />Calinda is curious, i hope season 2 explores her more.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I could play this game all day, so I set a timer and that is that. I love the options that you can buy with the coins you get from feeding on the gold prey to make your shark survive the reef hazards. I like the maps that can be bought with these same free coins. Am at level 10, not sure why my shark won't grow into the next size, but I am very new to the Kindle and all these games. This one is more fun to me than angry birds, but that is a close second.
B000FC13UE|4.0|Altogether a lot of worthwhile reads in this set, be sure to check \\"We can get them for you wholesale\\", \\"Nicholas\\", and \\"Murder Mysteries\\"
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is PERFECT for puzzle lovers. It works great on Kindle Fire HD, although it does take a while to load. It makes you think and I loved figuring out how to open all the boxes and secret compartments. This game has 4 chapters and it took me about 3 1/2 hours to play. I can't wait for the next one!!
B004LWZW42|5.0|X - MEN: FIRST CLASS didn't just give a few action scenes and then ended, it led to a conclusion. While doing this it also made sense. The story line was well thought through. I enjoyed the movie. Satisfied all the way to the end.
B000MVN8GK|5.0|The Veronica Mars series of 2004-2007 was new to us.  After watching just a few of the very first ones of Season 1, we were hooked.  She's a better sleuth than Nancy Drew.<br />Sincerely,<br />Grandparents
B009EEMMWW|4.0|A lovely film with real people.  Very enjoyable.  Visually stunning.  Penolope Cruz is a goddess and an excellent actress.  Recommend
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|This is a nice match 3 game, not as hard as some of theirs.  Graphics are good.  They use some of the hazards you find in their other games so if you played those you are familiar with them.
B005DJREGQ|1.0|Thought this would be funny.  Wrong again.  Just not worth wasting this much of my limited life span on junk, like this.
B007R9MFPU|4.0|Overall a great album. It's like the band never disbanded, IMHO. I'm glad they did it their way and released it themselves.
B008XFJEE2|1.0|This film has not aged well.  Couldn't finish it.  Really couldn't care less about these characters.  Whatever their problems, they did not speak to me.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|It took a couple of listens, but I love this album. The production is spectacular. Has a minimalist vibe in places but if you're really listening, there are some very fancy moves going on. Highly recommended.
B003VANOFY|3.0|I want to love this headset so badly. I used the Logitech G35 headset before this, and was a big fan. It made sense to go to the wireless headset, as I intended to be moving into a larger place and wanted to be able to move around a bit, sit on the couch, etc.<br />These headphones deliver on just about every count. They are very comfortable, the surround sound is convincing (it is digital, so take that as you will), and the mic is of great quality. The battery life is down to about 5 or 6 hours now after a year of use, but that is not too much of an issue. The on-headphone controls are also very helpful, allowing you to control music or Ventrilo through the headset's on-ear buttons.<br />The issue I have with these headphones though is a pretty shaky connection. I rarely sit more than fifteen feet from, and always within line of sight of, my computer. However, even sitting just a few feet from the base station, the headphones will frequently drop all audio as they re-connect to the little USB dongle. As one can imagine, losing all audio for roughly five seconds in an intense gaming situation is a real issue, and results in a lot of frustration. The issue isn't fixed when the headphones are connected directly via USB either. I'm unsure why the engineers didn't make the USB charging cable double as a wired audio connection as well, but that's on them.<br />These headphones are fantastically comfortable over long sessions, the sound quality is great, and they are very versatile. If they didn't drop connection frequently, I would recommend them in a heartbeat. However, due to the fact that without warning they fail at their primary job of delivering audio, I can't give them a top rating.
B00A8LRIEW|3.0|The music sounds unfinished and boring. I love Waiting for the Siren's Call, but these tracks would have added nothing to that album. Over and out.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The book was a good read.  I enjoyed it and would read another by him.  Great beach/vacation read for sure
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|I hate that Amazon is making me write a review when all I wanted to do was give it 5 stars. Make it easier people.
B002XXNSF6|5.0|I enjoyed this immensely.  I've read that a disproportionate amount of guys liked this film and I think I know why; it explores the away from home encounter romance that everyone experiences at one point in their lives from a very witty and accurate perspective.  The banter and dialogue is spot on and the \\"I know right?\\" moments are plentiful.  You are left dying to know how it turns out and fortunately for the world, these two  and Linklater have managed to make two more installments in real time nine years apart wiith Before Sunset and now Before Midnight coming out May 2013. Cant wait!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|From the beautiful graphics to the controls and menus, this game radiates quality. Honestly, after you've started playing, you start suspecting it's only a limited trial version, and that they're gonna ask you to pay to keep playing-- they never do! Aside from never needing to pay a penny (as both game currencies are easily obtained through the friend feature-- parents need not fear this though as there is no communication between players: the only thing you can do is send gifts to &quot;friends&quot;- a feature that is free to use; sending a gift does not need to cost any kind of currency.), new features and items are being added regularly.<br />This really is a game that both kids AND parents/adults can enjoy; while kids learn money management and the importance of caring for animals, we adults get to live out our childhood dream of horse ownership. :D
0307463745|5.0|I know a bunch of folks who love Rework, and I know some that give the \\"meh...\\" summary, and I sympathize with both responses. I loved this book of inspiring ideas and out of the box thinking. These guys run 37signals the same way I would love to run my own enterprise, so getting their advice and learning from their experience is really valuable.<br /><br />Even while I work at Fortune 1, many of these tidbits of how to run your business ring true to the way I want to run my team. I think anyone who takes business seriously should pick this one up - it's a fast enough read that even if you don't love it you won't have spent too much time digging in. For those who do love it, you'll likely want to return from time to time for a quick refresher.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Colin Firth is the ultimate Mr. Darcy, although a mite too taciturn for too much of the movie for my liking.  He certainly didn't have a lot of dialogue to learn, he mosly acted with his facial expressions.  But he & Jennifer Ehle have a wonderful chemistry.  It's also a very rich & sumptous production & all the actors & actresses do a magnificent job.  I loved it!

B006MW3V6U|5.0|It is fascinating to see how many people it takes to run and care for this home.  The downstairs action with the servants is<br />just as interesting as the wealthy family and their story.
B002WN35DC|5.0|Es un libro inigualable y esta version es impecable. Yo tengo el libro pero la comodidad de llevarlo siempre conmigo en mi IPAD y poder leerlo en cualquier parte, es invaluable. Lo recommendo a chicos y grandes.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I was interested in this book since my husband had just shared a near death experience with me.  While he was<br />in the hospital I ordered this book and we discussed how similar or different his experience was.  The book<br />did get a little over my head in a place or two but it is one I really recommend.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|This movie offers quite the alternative to our typical perspective that we have to make as much money as possible and fit into the rigid corporate structure. Tyler Durden makes us ask the question of why we are working ourselves to death for pieces of paper.
B009NG1Q96|3.0|I liked the first book. I really thought it was a neat concept. Although the last chapter was entertaining- this book pretty much is a bunch of wining I became so annoyed with the main protagonist. Nothing substantive happens until the last part of the book. I often feel these cliffhangers are just a way to make money. Seriously not every writer needs to create a trilogy -or more. a novella, a companion guide and a book from the other perspective uff... Just tell the story already! It's the type of book you can wait to barrow from the library. Hell, you can barrow it from me!
B00AGDW8II|3.0|Not the best acting by Teresa whatever her name is, but nice job by Debra Winger. Had seen movie before.
B007EC27QM|4.0|Great App for the Kindle! Nice calculator and great look. The ability to customize it. Good, for kids big buttons and big numbers.
B008P3SPVU|5.0|I just picked this movie out of the blue one morning and was absolutely enthralled for the entire movie.  It is a true story and it is fabulously made, I would recommend it to anybody whether they like sports or not.
B000I5SY5U|2.0|If your interested in the down side of humanity, the darkness of societies acceptable evil, this is your movie.  As it moves from scene to scene, it continues to introduce more episodes of social and lifestyle choice dysfunction.  You may have to shower to clean after this one.

1400067820|5.0|ANTIFRAGILITY<br /><br />(Be the Fire, Wish for the Wind)<br /><br />VERY ICONOCLASTIC AND ORIGINAL BOOK. If you have faith in doctors, economists, pharmaceutical companies, higher education and, in general , \\"planning,  then you are a \\"fragilista\\" and will not want to read Nassim Taleb's book, \\"Anti-fragile: Things That Gain From Disorder.\\"<br /><br />STRESSORS. Stressors are ever-present: volatility, randomness, disorder, uncertainty, risk, etc. \\"Anti-fragility\\" is a word that Taleb had to coin because no word quite conveys its meaning. It is not just \\"resilience\\" or \\"robustness\\" because these suggest only survival or equilibrium. Anti-fragility is that quality that results in actual benefit or improvement.<br /><br />Nature continuously favors organisms that can regenerate continuously by using, rather than suffering from, random events and unpredictable shocks. Non-avian dinosaurs were killed off by a massive meteorite; mastodons and Neanderthals were too fragile for the predation of Man.<br /><br />BLACK SWANS AND WHY HUMANS HAVE A STRONG TENDENCY TO FALL FOR \\"TURKEY\\" LOGIC.  To the turkey the farmer/breeder is a kind-hearted turkey-philanthropist. There is no \\"evidence\\" from which it could conclude otherwise....until it finds itself on a dark conveyor belt.<br /><br />Key to understanding:  Rare events (\\"Black Swans\\") are rare.  They do not show up in past historical samples. People in risk management tend to focus only on risky things that have hurt them in the past. \\"Life is lived forward but remembered backward.\\" (Kierkegaarde)  Armies (especially successful ones) always prepare for the last war. Predicting a \\"hundred year flood\\" is exponentially more difficult than a five year flood.<br /><br />TIME HAS SHARP TEETH.  \\"Time has sharp teeth that destroy everything.'\\" ( Simonides, 6th Cen. B.C.) No matter how small the probability, time is going to get you ....if you are fragile. Trying to predict the future is a losing game although humans are suckers for trying to do so; especially with respect to complex man-made systems that tend to develop cascades and runaway chains of reactions because of our susceptibility to panic. According to Taleb: \\"Our track record in figuring out significant rare events in politics and economics is not close to zero; it is zero.\\" Whatever is Black Swan-prone, even the hardest rock, will be swallowed by history eventually... since time augments into a certainty the probability of any event.<br /><br />HUMANS, AS A SPECIES, ARE A PRODUCT OF ANTI-FRAGILITY.... BUT INDIVIDUALS DON'T LIKE IT.  Evolution loves the stressors of disorder, uncertainty and change; through trial and error the strong and the adaptable survive and the weak and the non-adaptable do not; it is a ruthless process that has left all surviving organisms and complex systems naturally anti-fragile and able to thrive. But there is a natural tension between nature and the individual. The latter quite naturally fears disorder and uncertainty. Sadly, for nature to work, the fragile individual must fail or die; and in so doing a \\"transfer of benefits\\" to the species/community is accomplished.<br /><br />It is a paradox: deep down in their souls, humans have a secret thirst for chance and disorder.  They are thrilled at the chance to successfully confront random and unexpected challenges thrown their way. When they happen to think about it, they resent the over \\"touristification\\" of their lives, a life lived in \\"captivity\\" because of the absence of randomness and disorder. Just as spending a month in bed leads to muscle atrophy, complex systems are weakened and even killed when deprived of stressors. It is another paradox of modernity: eliminating chance and randomness can seem to make life cushy and comfortable (the Procrustean Bed\\"), but it also creates fragility. And when you are fragile, you depend on things following an exact, planned, predicted course. Paradoxically this dependence on prediction makes individuals/societies even more fragile, especially when they think they know more than theyactually do.<br /><br />THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2008. In 2007, a whistleblower from within Fannie Mae provided Taleb with internal documents showing that this private GSE (Gov. Sponsored Entity) was taking on much greater risks for much smaller profit, all to benefit the compensation packages of its managers. For Taleb it was obvious that Fannie was a \\"powder keg\\" that would inevitably explode. He published this view in the NY Times. Fannie responded with denials and a half-hearted smear campaign. (Half-hearted because no one took Taleb's prediction seriously.)The very same data on Fannie was looked at by Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz. The later did simulations based on his economic models and pronounced: \\"...on the basis of historical experience, the risk to the government from a potential default on GSE debt is effectively zero.\\" In early 2008, Ben Bernancke opined that the crisis in mortgage financing was \\"contained.\\"  The financial crisis reached its climax in October 2008. Alan Greenspan at a later congressional hearing said that the events that caused the crash were \\"unforeseeable.\\"<br /><br />Taleb's Point:  The only thing that was knowable prior to the crash was the essential fragility of the system; the time and precise nature of the \\"Black Swan\\" was not predictable. He says our only recourse is (1) to make the system \\"anti-fragile;\\" and (2) to break-up the \\"too-big-to-fail\\" financial institutions into many units ...so that the failure of any one cannot collapse the system.<br /><br />Taleb derides those who claim retrospectively to \\"sort of\\" or \\"almost\\" have predicted 2008. He calls it \\"retrospective distortion.\\"  Black Swans \\"hijack our brains\\" because big events are always retrospectively explainable. Our minds are in the business of turning history into something smooth and linear (i.e., explainable) but \\"life\\" is very much more labyrinthine than anything ever showing up in our memory.Again, Taleb doesn't claim to have predicted 2008; he only claims to have predicted the system's fragility.<br /><br />WASHING MACHINES AND THE LINEAR MINDSET OF HUMANS. Taleb cites psychological studies that show that the human brain much prefers \\"minimal effort,\\" that is, a strong tendency to do only that amount of thinking necessary to \\"get by.\\"  Among other things, this explains the universal tendency of humans to think in linear terms. Linear minds do not like nuances; they reduce information received to the binary choice: \\"harmful\\" or \\"helpful'\\" or \\"good\\" and \\"bad.\\" Thus, like good engineers, we try and construct our complex social structures like a washing machine ...with known properties and parameters. We love smoothness and hate randomness. And in a machine this is good.<br /><br /> Non-linear, by contrast, means having properties and responses that are not straightforward and obvious. Unfortunately for us, the world is mostly non-linear.<br /><br />`ANYTHING THAT DOESN'T KILL ME MAKES ME STRONGER ;'( Nietzsche) EXAMPLES OF THE NON-LINEAR.<br /><br />1. Poison:  in small doses, at intervals, the body can develop immunity. So too with small-pox inoculations where small amounts of the \\"bad\\" virus are injected into the body.<br />2. Children playing outside in the cold in the dirt will develop imperviousness to cold and bacteria that children who are kept inside \\"safe\\" and warm do not.  The key is that the body has a sufficient interval after the application of the stressor to recover.( Even small stressors such as drops of water in Chinese water torture can kill precisely because the body is not given time to recover.)<br />3. Forest fires: Nature has already provided us with a non-linear way to avoid Black Swan-like conflagrations; allow small fires to burn away the fuel that would otherwise fuel the big ones.<br /><br />4.  Predators like wolves, mountain lions and sharks: Again, Nature provided us with an easy and natural way of controlling over-population of deer, rabbits, etc. Man in his hubris once called these animals \\"bad.\\"<br /><br />5. Weeding, culling and pruning: Every gardener knows that pruning the weak parts of a tree or bush makes it stronger. Weeding and culling accomplish the same purpose.<br /><br />6. Drugs and anti-depressants that mask real bodily symptoms. Taleb does not believe in most medicines, even aspirin, except in the most severe cases.  These drugs hide from us real - and important - information that our bodies are sending out; taking drugs allow us to put off needed correctives. Doctors over-prescribe because (1) there is tendency for \\"naïve interventionism\\" (when you come to him with a perceived problem, you thank him/her for what they do for you; not for what they didn't do); (2) doctors, with the connivance of the pharmaceutical companies, practice \\"defensive medicine\\" in accordance with protocols established for their mutual benefit.<br /><br />7. The Economy: Eliminating business cycles is like eliminating small brush fires in the forest. When times are flush, weak and inefficient players are invisible to us; they accumulate silently under the surface. When such weak hands rush to the door, they collectively cause crashes. Without government intervention, mini-crashes serve the function of flushing out these weak hands. Greenspan tried to \\"iron out\\" the boom-bust cycle; this led to the mother of all fragilities. If Nature ran the economy, it would never bail out Citibank, AIG or GM. It is ruthlessly unsentimental.<br /><br />FAILURE, MISTAKES AND ERRORS ARE WHAT MAKES HUMAN PROGRESS POSSIBLE. Errors and failure are a critical source of information. Nearly all technological improvement in the world today is not the result of a university elite  with \\"no skin in the game\\", but of clever tinkerers using trial and error methods to accomplish practical results. Mother Nature ruthlessly tests all life forms for anti-fragility. She is cruel in her destroying and replacing; her replacing and reshuffling.  This is exactly the method of the clockmaker/tinkerer/artisan.<br /><br />Why is there a perception (illusory) that our cornucopia of modern technology is a gift of the university crowd? Taleb believes there are two reasons. First education, if nothing else, develops a skill of talking and writing books. Skilled people and artisans are often not good talkers and rarely write books. We moderns are suckers for the sophisticated. Academia is well-equipped to tell us what it did for us, how indispensable they are; they \\"cherry pick\\" their stories, showing us the confirmatory examples, and ignore the rest.<br /><br />LOTS OF SMALL ERRORS: `SOPHISTICATION BORN OF NEED; SUCCESS OF DIFFICULTIES.' Mother Nature ruthlessly tests all life forms for anti-fragility. She is cruel in her destroying and replacing; her replacing and reshuffling.  Humans don't like to think of ruthlessness as an engine of progress but it is an inescapable fact.<br />Nature loves small errors without which genetic variation would be impossible. If nature ran our economy she would want as many overly-optimistic entrepreneurs as possible; and she would expect that many, if not most, would fail. Sadly, the benefits of errors and mistakes are conferred on the collective, you and me. It is as if individuals were designed to make errors for the greater good, not their own. Take, for example, a failed manufacturer of coffee makers; his failure effectively  put superior merchandise  from another  vendor on your kitchen counter.<br /><br />If restaurants were immortal, then the overall restaurant business would be stagnant and weak and the food served would be no better than Soviet-style cafeteria food.Good restaurants are a result of a Darwinian `survival of the fittest.' If the Titanic had not run into an iceberg when it did, boat makers would have built bigger and bigger boats.... Until (eventually) we had an even worse catastrophe. Every plane crash has its lessons which bring us ever closer to safety. The Fukushima nuclear disaster made us aware of the consequences of small probabilities.<br /><br />The key is not to eliminate errors - because that is impossible and we learn from each one.  It is to prevent the errors/mistakes from growing so big that we don't survive them. The anti-fragile solution to Fukushima might be to make the reactors smaller, and bury then deeper, surrounded by more concrete.  So that when the system fails, damage will be minimized.<br /><br />Lesson: Don't focus on predicting failure or the probability of disaster because we can't; focus on one's exposure to failure.<br /><br />MICE, CATS AND ELEPHANTS: THE \\"BIG\\" ARE ALWAYS MORE FRAGILE.  Throw a cat or mouse in the air and they will typically survive intact. Elephants, by comparison, break limbs very easily. Mammoths, Dodo Birds, and other large animal species, tend to go extinct disproportionately. Nature's lesson: keep your systems small and you will avoid catastrophe. As with financial institutions.<br /><br />SWiTZERLAND. Societies that try to protect their citizens from stress are always \\"top down.\\" Societies that leave most stressors for the individual to deal with are \\"bottom-up.\\" Switzerland is the arch-typical bottom-up country; the citizens are so focused on local \\"trivia\\" - local elections, competition with the city next door, how to organize a flower show, the appropriateness of a statue or building - that national politics as we now know it in the U.S. doesn't exist. So much so that the average man in the street doesn't even know the name of the current prime minister. There is no \\"culture war\\" in Switzerland; gay marriage, global warming, abortion are not \\"hot-button\\" issues which divide the country along ideological lines. A curious thing: this Swiss bottoms-up approach is extraordinarily \\"anti-fragile.\\" And even curiouser, foreigners instinctively recognize its stability, which is mostly why that is where they park their money and have second \\"bolt-hole\\" homes.<br /><br />MAKING A SYSTEM MORE ANTI-FRAGILE:  BY SUBTRACTION! Proclus, a Neo-Platonist philosopher, first came up with the metaphor that statues are carved by subtraction. Michelangelo, asked by the pope how he was able to carve the statue \\"David,\\" replied: \\"It's simple. I just remove everything that is not David.\\"<br /><br />\\"Keeping one's distance from an ignorant person is the equivalent of keeping company with a wise man.\\" (Old Arabic saying)<br /><br />\\"Naïve rationalism\\" is overestimating the role of academic knowledge in human affairs and degrading the uncodifiable, more complex, intuitive or experienced based knowledge. When Taleb was himself a commodity trader in Chicago, he found that all of the best traders were simple folk, mostly without technical training of any sort. They avoided models and technical tricks and focused on one thing only: making money.  In explaining why these traders were so successful, Taleb points out two factors: (1) humans are very bad at filtering information and (2) information in large doses is toxic.  `When you cross the street, you remove data from your head and focus on the essential.'<br /><br />According to Taleb, the key to anti-fragility is subtraction. In all organizations, for instance in public education, a small percentage of the employees cause most of the problems...destroying the morale even of the good. Solution: ruthlessly eliminate those \\"bad\\" employees. In every health care system, public or private, 10 % of the patients (mostly elderly) consume two-thirds of the health care dollar, even adjusted for catastrophic accidents; 50% of the population consumes just 3% of the total. There is no way health care will ever be solved without applying \\"subtraction\\" in some form.<br /><br />Steve Jobs career illustrates many of Taleb's points: Jobs was \\"blessed with an absence of college education but the right aggressiveness of temperament;\\"  he had his amazing successes at Apple only after he ran that company nearly into the ground and was fired as a result; his great achievement was to have the insight to mold different existing technologies into highly saleable products. In short, he was a tinkerer very much in the pattern of Watt, Fulton, Carnegie, etc. This is what Jobs said about his methodology:<br /><br />\\"People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.\\"<br /><br />NAIVE INTERVENTIONISM VERSUS PROCRASTINATION. Taleb favors procrastination as a rational society's natural defense, letting things take their natural course towards a natural anti-fragility. The Romans in the heyday of their success had an expression, festina lente, which means \\"make haste slowly. \\"The Chinese philosopher Lao-Tzu had a similar doctrine he called \\"wu-wei\\" or \\"passive achievement.\\"<br /><br />We live, however, in a world where as a people we are more moved by a crying baby on TV than thousands of people dying elsewhere but whose deaths don't make it onto TV. \\"One death is a tragedy; the death of a million is only a statistic.\\" (Stalin)<br /><br />Governments respond to the public's fascination with anecdotes by creating bureaucracies staffed by civil servants who have no skin in the game who make decisions in a linear manner with no provision for the nuances of the real world. It takes courage for a politician in today's democracy to justify inaction; unfortunately, few have that courage. The paradox is that these government interventions usually hurt the weak and consolidate the power and wealth of the establishment.<br /><br />For similar reasons, doctors tend to over-intervene in areas where there is minimal benefit. For instance, we can cure many cases of diabetes by putting people on a very strict starvation-style diet that shocks their system in a good way. Less is sometimes more.<br /><br />In 1959-60, the Chinese state \\"trying very hard\\" killed 30-40 million of its own people in a famine that was very much its own making. Statistics later showed that the famine was worst in areas that before the famine had the highest food production, proof that the fault was with the government's own food distribution system.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:  AMERICA'S PAST AND FUTURE<br />Taleb's book gives us some indication of what should be done to live in a world that does not want us to understand it...a world whose charm comes from our inability to truly understand it.<br /><br />Material objects are dead; living things love volatility.<br /><br />The best way to verify that you are alive is by checking if you like variations.<br /><br /> Remember that food would not have a taste if it weren't for hunger; results are meaningless without effort, joy without sadness, convictions without uncertainty, and an ethical life isn't so when stripped of personal risks.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|This show is wonderful! I watch it on BBC America on Saturday nights and then rewatch each episode once or twice with friends. It's great.
B009X01FJS|5.0|Looked at all the various cases available for my Kindle and this is absolutely perfect and does so much to help me enjoy my Kindle even more.  I normally don't like pink, this however is not the sick candy colored pink but more a rich fuchia (sp) and I am really, really happy with this purchase.

B00B4804KS|5.0|Yes, it's Steven Spielberg's 1993 classic, based on Michael Crichton's exciting novel, tweaked into 3D and redistributed to scare the piddle out of a whole new generation! As for creating tension and thrills, Spielberg never misses a trick; I had to smile at all his gimmicks...even as I reacted to them. Remember, clich&eacute;s became clich&eacute;s because they WORKED!<br /><br />A scientist finds prehistoric DNA in mosquitoes trapped in amber; from this he has cloned dinosaurs and wants to open a theme park in a highly controlled environment so children can have first-hand lessons about the Jurassic Age. He invites a small cadre of scientists and investors to tour his Caribbean Island facility, but as they tour...Oops! they have a power outage. Excitement ensues...<br /><br />I'll use fairly current credits, but think back, you'll remember:<br />  * Sam Neill (\\"The Vow\\") is Dr. Alan Grant, a paleontologist who is pro-science and anti-children. He is very interested in this pro- posed theme park, he is NOT interested in marriage or children. Born in Ireland and raised in New Zealand, Neill works all the time.<br />  * Laura Dern (\\"The Master\\") is Dr. Ellie Sattler, a botanist who works with Dr. Grant. This scientist is interested in both children AND marriage. Daughter of Bruce Dern and Diane Ladd, she is another professional who has acted all her life. She looks so young here!<br />  * Jeff Goldblum (\\"The Switch\\" and \\"Portlandia\\") is Dr. Ian Malcom, who questions the wisdom of trying to override nature's method of extinction. I had forgotten what a hunk he was (and still is).<br />  * Richard Attenborough (\\"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\\") is John Hammond, a scientist who dreams of using dinosaur DNA to create clones for a theme park. This multi-talented actor/producer/director is one of Britain's most honored professionals.<br />  * Samuel L. Jackson (\\"The Avengers\\") is Ray, one of the tech- nicians at the theme park. Along with other achievements in his varied career, Jackson has gone on to become a mainstay of Marvel's Superhero series.<br />  * Ariana Richards (\\"Jurassic Park\\" trilogy and lots of TV) is the terrified big sister, Lex. After decades of television work, Miss R. has a new movie, \\"Battledogs,\\" scheduled out this year.<br />  * Joseph Mazzello (\\"The Social Network\\") is all grown up now, his adventurous little 1993 Tim, a distant memory. Mr. M. has managed to work a college degree into his busy schedule.<br />  * Wayne Knight (Lots of TV) is the scalawag who tries to steal prehistoric embryos from the labratory. It is his rear-view mirror that cautions \\"Objects may be closer than they appear\\" when he spots a T-Rex in pursuit of his jeep.<br /><br />Some of us today think \\"Thesaurus\\" is a dinosaur, so maybe we need to brush up. Remember those velociraptors hunting the children in that kitchen? For some reason, that indelible scene has stayed with me all these years. Spielberg made a memorable movie in 1993 and now, 20 years later, it's fun to visit it again. One big difference: Today's children have their bladders set for a commercial break every 10 minutes or so (Ah, television); there was an annoying stream of school children sneaking in and out during the film.<br /><br />It's PG-13, so expect humor, suspense, violence (dinosaurs eating each other), bits of corpses (human and otherwise, with very little blood), and everything else Spielberg can throw at you. Just remember, this was terrific in 1993 when it was in 2D, so there is really no need for the extra 3D expen$e. But it's great either way! Be sure you get the remastered edition from Amazon so the soundtrack is clean.career, Jackson has gone on to become a mainstay of Marvel's Superhero series.<br />  * Ariana Richards (\\"Jurassic Park\\" trilogy and lots of TV) is the terrified big sister, Lex.

B007ZSBQYE|2.0|First off this is not what I'd call 3-D. The truck does look like it falls off the world (which is the fun-est part of the game). My Android would not let me press both fingers on the screen at once so I could not steer, I did figure out how to \\"tilt steer\\" but it's not right because for me I had to hold my Android upside down. Amazon.com's description says that we can drive four car types and one of them is a \\"Saloon\\" (I think they meant Sedan). But considering the drunk way you have to drive maybe a saloon would help.

I did not think it was my thing at all but after watching the 1st episode of season 1 I was hooked!!! Season 2 is even better!! War, Murder, Love, Betrayal, and Happy endings!! I loved it and can't wait for season 3!!
B007Q53IQ0|4.0|Had to watch this film for a college Spanish course, and I enjoyed it! The plot is definitely unique, and it's dramatic in a real way, and not over-dramatically so, as is common in many movies now a days.  Overall, it's a great insight into just how complicated familial relationships can be.

B009R659L8|5.0|I very much enjoyed Daddy's Gone a Hunting.  I did experience a problem with my download.  The words would change size and I would miss some words of the book.  I reloaded it from my cloud and it was better for a short time and then resorted back to the problem.  Thank goodness, it didn't cause a major problem with the plot of the book.  It was just annoying not to know if words would be missing.  On  some pages, it would repeat the paragraph from the previous page and then go on.  All in all, I enjoyed the plot and never guessed the ending until just before it happened.  What a great way to keep the reader guessing.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Well, I decided to invest in the blu ray Godfather collection. I've owned the dvd collection that came out a while back, and I decided that now is the time to upgrade and get the blu ray collection. The movies look so much better on blu ray, the people who did the restoration for this did an amazing job. It's got the 3 films plus a bunch of extras to keep you entertained. If you love The Godfather Trilogy, buy this blu ray collection, you won't be disapointed.

It's a boardgame style strategy game where pieces of the board fall off when you move away, so you try to trap your opponents so you get more of the board to yourself.  You collect fish until there are no spaces left.  The best part is that it can be pass 'n play for up to 4 friends/siblings using a single device.
B005MMYEF8|4.0|well acted, great story line and plenty of mature action. Wish it was longer than 3 seasons, but they scored big on the final season and the last 3 episodes are 5 star.

B00908DDZM|5.0|I don't know how in the world this album slipped under my radar. I was very impressed of how technically skilled of an MC Macklemore is and how good of a producer Ryan Lewis, they co-exist with each other well like a Bow and Arrow. I am a little embarrassed to admit that I didn't actually know this album existed up until a month ago. I was aware of Macklemore and I was aware of some of his songs on the radio like \\"Thrift Shop\\" and \\"Can't Hold Us\\", but I was completely oblivious to the fact that he dropped an album the same time Kendrick Lamar's good kid, m.A.A.d city album came out (I guess my focus was all on Kendrick during that time period). Although this album isn't as conceptually great as Kendrick's album, what I love about this album is that it covers a variety of topics, and the musicality is great as well. With 15 tracks on the standard edition, and 18 on the deluxe edition, THE HEIST is jampacked with great songs overall, despite a lack of focus and some inconsistency.<br /><br />What I love about Macklemore is that he is 100% relatable. He covers some touchy subjects like homosexuality on \\"Same Love\\", struggle with alcoholism \\"Neon Cathedral\\" and \\"A Wake\\", protesting materialism \\"Wings\\", the cold truth about the music Industry \\"Jimmy Iovine\\" among other conscious subject matter. I was very impressed with Macklemore's songwriting abilities; although he is nowhere the greatest lyricist nor does he have the most clever rhymes; the conviction in his voice, his ability to have a non-traditional flow using half-rhymes/half-spoken word in double time speed is original and commendable. Macklemore doesn't sound like anybody, neither is he trying to emulate someone else's style. Every song on this album, even his more sillier ones like \\"White Walls\\" and \\"Gold\\" has substance, amongst that, all of his songs have a clear message that isn't hard to follow. And we cannot forget his partner in crime Ryan Lewis. The way he produced this album contains a lot of depth and musical changes throughout the album which makes this album more pleasurable to listen too. A perfect example of his producing skills is displayed on the instrumental track \\"BomBom\\" Although this album has a \\"pop\\" sound to it, its the way it compliments Macklemores voice and messages that makes their comradery fit perfectly like a glove.<br /><br />Out of many the Hip Hop albums that have been coming out lately, its very refreshing to hear an album that doesn't try to sound so hardcore all the time. I can admit that this album can come off as a little corny or even too squeaky clean for those that are used to vulgar rap music, but I appreciate how genuine this album is. And the fact that Macklemore and Ryan Lewis are releasing and marketing this album as independent artists is truly remarkable. He isn't signed to a big time record label, or relying on alliances like Young Money or Maybach Music... they both became successful and noticeably so for their talents demonstrating that hard work and determination can lead to success and true satisfaction. And for those interested, the standard edition of this album is available everywhere, however I bought the physical copy of the deluxe edition that is sold exclusively on their website and I have to say that the packaging for the deluxe edition is incredibly manufactured and overall just cool to own. It has a gator-skin pattern and includes artwork for every single song. It is worth the extra bucks so if you wanna buy it, go to their official website and purchase it there.<br /><br />Favorite 5<br />1) Can't Hold Us feat.

B00ARA4SLU|4.0|I don't know much about Alfred Hitchcock, other than the movies he left us with. That's why I was so interested in seeing this biographical drama. When I found out that Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren were involved, I was tempted to see \\"Hitchcock\\" the week it opened in theaters. I missed that opportunity, and the remainder of its run had one evening showing per day, so I eventually decided to wait for the Blu-ray. Reviews have been disappointing, but, as always, I trusted my instincts and decided to make up my own mind.<br /><br />Hopkins doesn't try to mimic Hitchcock's voice exactly, but he does employ the deliberate mode of speech that most of us are familiar with. The makeup isn't entirely convincing either, but it's good enough to get the job done. Hopkins plays the director quite seriously, and I felt that Hitchcock's playful nature was a little underused.<br /><br />What the movie attempts to do is take us back to the making of Psycho, which was released in 1960. Paramount's bosses were seeking something similar to North by Northwest, which had been released in 1959, but Hitchcock wanted to try something new. We learn how the project was chosen, and the sacrifices that Hitchcock and wife Alma made to make it happen. It's an interesting look at a brief time in a career which spanned more than half a century.<br /><br />The movie gets a lot of things right; It looks and feels like 1960, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Biel manage to resemble film stars of that era, and the casting in general is excellent.<br /><br />I've been thinking about why reviews were so negative, and I've come to the conclusion that it is a movie which will appeal to a very specific audience. It's not a gripping drama, and there isn't much excitement. This is a story intended for movie buffs or fans of Hitchcock. If you want to know more about his character, and how movies are made, this has something for you. Character studies are hard to get right, and the movie is far from perfect. But I was engrossed for 90 minutes, and enjoyed learning how some of the events came to pass. The marketing for Psycho was inventive, and contributed to its early success. Some of that story is shown here.<br /><br />The biggest source of conflict in the movie is Hitchcock's relationship with Alma. We learn something about their home life, and ultimately how important she was to his success. There's an explosive scene, just over an hour into the movie, in which Mirren's performance is elevated from good to great. It reminded me somewhat of the scene in Doubt, where Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman finally confront each other.<br /><br />Seeing \\"Hitchcock\\" makes me want to watch Psycho again, and I will do so in the near future. I've also been watching the excellent Bates Motel, starring Vera Farmiga and Freddie Highmore, and would recommend that as a good companion piece to Psycho if you're a fan.<br /><br />\\"Hitchcock\\" works for its intended audience, but many people will find it lacking. It's a quiet movie, focusing on characters and details, rather than intensely dramatic scenes. I'm not sure what moviegoers were expecting. Perhaps they were hoping for a detailed look at Hitchcock's entire career? Lincoln fell flat for some viewers for similar reasons. If you enjoy seeing good acting, and have any interest in the man, \\"Hitchcock\\" is worth your time.<br /><br />Overall score 4/5 (for it's intended audience)ut I was engrossed for 90 minutes, and enjoyed learning how some of the events came to pass.

I like that the characters were more drawn out even in the fast-paced, high-energy movie.  No spoiler, but the ending was sad.  The new Q took a little getting used to (he's just a kid), but I liked him.  Very creepy villain!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Wow it's a s real as court can get. And gives one a good idea what lawyers will do for a win. Hell is 50% lawyers and the other 50% didn't  pass the Bar Examine.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A book that is both entertaining and pensive.  It has layers of meaning, philosophy, religion, zoology.  Even more of a must read if you have seen the movie, because the movie sucks.
B008Y6TD5A|5.0|IF YOU HAVE STOMACH PROBLEMS DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE............MY STOMACH WAS IN KNOTS THE ENTIRE TIME..SO I GUESS THAT WOULD MAKE IT ONE SUSPENSEFUL RIDE.
B002T45VX6|5.0|I give it a 5 for not being a Shakira fan but it made a perfect gift for the family member that loves her. It came in perfect condition and perfect timing. Person loved it. Nothing to dislike here. Recommended for any &#34;she-wolf&#34; out there!
B003CP72QK|5.0|Tense movie ....a teachable movie......when it's over there would and should be conversation. I have seen it several times and I recommend it anyone looking for a great movie.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Give it a 5 not only because I love this series but because of how it is packaged. It is a great series that I think everyone should have eventually. Perfect for any history buff or non-history buff. Nothing to dislike with this product. Recommended to any history buff or non-history buff.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Author was able to weave accurate history into a novel of thrilling adventure and romance. You will get caught up in the trials and tribulations of the characters as they are swept through history.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|The pictures are detailed and show clearly how to create som complex knots. If you like messing with para cord, this is a great book.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|One needs an unusual sense of humor to truly appreciate this movie. One of my favorites from that era. The Cat Stevens sound track is classic.
B009AMANH4|5.0|This was absolutely a WONDERFUL film.  I learned more than my history lessons had taught me about the man LINCOLN.  More of these should be done on American Heroes!!
B00BESJYAY|4.0|The story portreys the struggle in a young man's life and the struggle in his hero has also.  A boy with a less than perfect family life finds goals and dreams!
B0068MNO4S|4.0|I saw this movie in the theaters, and then later purchased the DVD to watch with my son who became interested in the topic.  If you're familiar with Elizabethian England and the characters, you should enjoy the movie.  Might be hard to follow for others. The movie is &#34;dark&#34; (not subject matter, but lighting&#34;) and I found it more difficult to follow at home than on a big theater screen.<br /><br />I did like the casting, Rhys Ifans was great as a brooding Earl of Oxford and I really liked Vanessa Redgrave's portrayal of an old Elizabeth. I didn't agree with the casting of William Shakespeare -- while I probably would side with the Oxfordians, what we do know of Shakespeare and the supposed pictures of him wouldn't lead me to believe he was the foppish dolt that was portrayed in the movie.<br /><br />I will probably watch this movie a few more times, mostly to watch Ifans' performance.
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|I love true stories and this was a story of triump, but they kept showing the pain & hurt over and over again, wrenching your heart.  It was hard to watch.<br /><br />Fortunately it has a happy ending.
B002TLSSXO|4.0|I bought this to replace my Good Grips set.  I like that the tools keep your countertop clean.  The tools are well made and work well for me.  For some reason, foods seem to stick more than my silicone set.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|What a movie. Crazy , all over the place kind of ride..that is Quentin Tarantino for you. Tons of actors, cameos etc. Leonardo Dicaprio was beyond excellent, as well as Jamie Foxx. You won't be disappointed.
B00CFA225Y|4.0|I had fun with this movie. The visual effects are good, though not great. The production design was imaginative, and the story was well told. The only problem I had with it was the princess: She doesn't do anything except get rescued over and over. She utterly useless. I guess not every movie can have a strong female character, though.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Think &#34; murder she wrote&#34; only much better. The actors are wonderful. Jonny Lee Miller is crazy fun to watch, and Lucy Lui meshes well with him. This is a &#34; Thinkers&#34; and a Problem Solvers show. If you like detective work, you will love this one.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|We read the book for our book club so it was exciting to see it like real.  It was an amazing movie.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|I have not played Backgammon in a number of years but thought this would be a nice addition to my Kindle HD, something that I could play alone or with someone.  It is a fun, entertaining game.  The colors and picture are vibrant and I just enjoy playing it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am sooo addicted to this game that I can not stop playing it even if I wanted to stop which explains how much I really love this game.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Entertaining and current.  We love it.  The only problem is that my wife is already into season 2 and I am still in season 1.
B0093X805W|5.0|I gave this book five stars because it was different from the movie and more interesting! It had a joyful ending and was overall very funny. I would recommend this book to children of all ages, especially mine!<br /><br />-Aidan, age 6
B004D20JP2|5.0|My boys, ages 5 & 3, LOVE WATCHING THIS!  Since they already have the Jack Lemmon version memorized, they love that they &#34;know&#34; what Peter looks like and that his grandfather doesn't look like theirs.
B003DXSXCI|5.0|I loved this movie. Steve turned on his tough side for sure.......Growl..!!!!..<br />The fact that I also purchased the same car he drives, when it first came out only heightens my interest.<br />I watch the movie yearly and recommend it to any cops and robbers fan.
B00CHILW64|5.0|EXCELLENT POV BY THE DIRECTOR about the type of destruction cause by nature great power!!!!!! Compelling, a miracle very nice
B0050AV5MW|5.0|Recently I became obsessed with the HBO series of GOT, so I just had to read the original text. Book 1 was word for word and so it reinforced my enthusiasm for the story lines, the characters and the depth and complexity of this other world.  At first I thought of this as mediavalism and not so different from our world, but I can see now that certain themes are picked up and exaggerated, like  animism or taking the spirit of animals,like the wolves and the greenseer and that Martin has gone beyond our world and history.<br />This is not my genre and without having watched the HBO, I am not sure that I would have taken to this with the same enthusiasm.  Game of Thrones is holidng me enthralled because it is epic.  The scope and scale, the range and number of key characters has to have been influenced by Lord of the Rings, but imagine it magnified and multiplied.  The appendices are important for the history and genealogies and keeping track of connections, obligations and debts between the Houses.<br />Martin is a good storyteller, I am relishing this read and imagine I will keep reading through to book 5. I am half way through on my kindle as I write and reading as much as I can as I am on holiday.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|I read this 10 years ago and revisited it this year before seeing the movie.  Although the movie was well-done with all those special effects, I still think the book is much more interesting and in-depth.  Did any of it really happen?  Who cares?  Just go along for the ride with Pi.
B004784ZKM|5.0|This was the last great Genesis album. Shortly after its release, guitarist Steve Hackett left the band, bringing the members of Genesis down to three (hence, the title of their next studio release: And Then There Were Three...). Genesis would never recover from the loss, and would slide inexorably closer to Top 40 Hell with each subsequent release.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome but creative needs flint and steel on creative and cave systems and animal spawning needs work in the creative mode.
B00CAJP0ZO|5.0|Another hit by Will.I.Am. It may be short, but each song is great in its own regards. Buy it now.
B008KMHFJY|5.0|A fantastic read I couldn't stop once I started. It is exhausting that they don't realise it sooner but it makes the story line exciting and intriguing at the same time.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very handy! Useful in doing my weekly bill paying. I also used it to figure percentages for discounts before purchasing online.
B002TVQ4HG|5.0|Triangle reminds me of the movie &#34; The Others&#34;. Both movies have an attractive leading lady that any single guy would love to share a cocktail with. Both movies will keep you interseted the first time and they wil give you a the ticket was worth it feeling. After that you will need to set the movie away long enough for you to forget the movie if you want the same effect again. Triangle is a graet movie! Enjoy it and than forget about it! THis movie is bloody, not for the timid.
B008DVJMAW|4.0|I'm a fan of Southern Rock.  I took a chance and purchased this CD.  I was not disappointed and neither will you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I downloaded this item not knowing what it was but when I first played fell in love with it! Brilliant graphics and No glich so really good!
B00B0YL0E0|4.0|I had a copy of their first albumn way back when.  It's good to hear they are still recording music.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|Game it's self is fun but is very glitchy frezzes and can't send gifts to friends most days also after you get so far you have spend money or you will be stuck for months no exaggeration
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|The show does a good job of not romanticizing Vikings - while showing their &#34;clans&#34; and their first forages to Britain.  The main character, Ragnar is very well played.  He has such a nice smile - while contemplating some very violent schemes.  It makes you realize how brave they were to cross an ocean when they had no proof that anything was on the other side.  Their violence comes through when, having made a successful journey, they take whatever they want and kill without mercy.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|If you like Les Miserables, this is a &#34;must have&#34; for your collection. Another &#34;must have' is the 25th anniversary DVD and soundtrack.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|I have to wonder in Lincoln really did have a story for everything that happened.  He would have gotten on my nerves pretty darn quick if he did.<br /><br />The role was well-played though.  Daniel Day-Lewis will always be &#34;Lincoln&#34; for me from here on!
B00AYM6JFO|4.0|Willie has what so many other aging performers only wish they had, a voice that could carry on well with age.  Unlike Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett or Wayne Newton, or even rockers such as Keith Jagger or Steven Tyler (all of these whom I've seen in their later years and a few whom I saw in their younger years) Willie's voice has been molded and shaped to carry on.  He doesn't sound off key because...well.....because Willie never really had a key to begin with, he just sang and it always sounded warm and welcome.<br /><br />This is so ironic for me to say because I am not, and have never been, a fan of country music. I have thousands of blues and jazz CDs and probably less than 20 country CDs. But, I've always enjoyed Willie, dating back to his 1978 \\"Startdust\\" album which I still play somewhat frequently to this day.  And, just as with \\"Stardust,\\" Willie's latest venture, \\"Let's Face the Music and Dance\\" is simply a great album to have on in the background. It's absolutely amazing to think that this man, 80 years old, can still put out albums that are not only relevant to the times, but a joy to listen to.  Willie entertains us with a variety of sounds and styles, from the Irving Berlin opener (and title track) to jazzed up versions of other tunes and genres this album delivers a little something for everyone.<br /><br />Sure, there will no doubt be those who say \\"Willie, quit while you're ahead\\" or \\"It's time (or past time)\\" or they will state the obvious, this is not the BEST album will has ever had.  Still, it's a welcome addition to my collection, especially my incredibly sparse, country collection!  P.S. Stars are such a subjective thing and there are no guidelines or standards. Unlike many reviews here, I'm extremely tight about issuing Five Star ratings, the album or book has to be truly outstanding and exemplary.  A Four Star rating is nothing to sneeze at and this is clearly a great album.  Enjoy it!
B0064MGU98|4.0|Running behind on some series since I cut the cable two years ago.<br /><br />This series is better than I'd expected.  I didn't want to watch yet another story line full of sexual exploits  - and little &#34;story.&#34;  Other than the fact that the &#34;husband&#34; is totally annoying, I like it thatthat the main character looks out for her own interests.  Her legal investigator, Kalinda, is also a great role and well-played.
B000VCLGBY|4.0|I like this movie because it is a lite film with a little message to share.  I mean, if dealing with appearances is all we do, then the truth might be hiding elsewhere.  Of course, this is the kind of movie with a purpose, yes, the purpose of finding true destiny, even the hardships or misunderstandings.
B008KYOCA2|4.0|Easy to add comments even to days that have past.  I like to look at a month at a time and other calendar apps would not let me back date events.  This one does.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a great calculator. Big buttons,clear display,and I like being able to see the last calculation I entered.  That makes working with long strings of numbers much easier.
B008Y7IP0S|5.0|Even though this movie came out in 1984, it is still a very inspirational movie.  My kids (10 & 5) are watching it now and they love it as much as I did when I was a kid.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This a great game to lift your spirits! People who like temple run  and super penguin should love this game! So get it if you can!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The depth of the characters is amazing, and I am usually not a drama fan.  The repeated focus on cases gets a little old though.
B007IV1E2W|5.0|How can you not love the Doctor? In this season we learn who River Song is, discover the silence and learn the one question that can never be answered.....
B008MEM24S|4.0|The where's my perry app is pretty good.<br />But one of the challenges in the game seems disproportionately difficult.<br />thank you
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|Love the score. Held my attention for the entire movie. If you like musicals you will probably like this one.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Does not allow survival and adventure game modes -- only creative.<br />Unable to use stone cutter, crafting table, furnace and chest.<br />Difficult to use nether-core
1594204217|5.0|Michael Pollan is a philosopher and mystic of the mundane, in my book. Some philosophers and mystics begin from the ineffable and the intangible and whirl you around in concepts almost impossible to get a handle on.<br /><br />By contrast, Pollan is like another favourite writer of mine who performs the same trick, - Sharman Apt Russell. Both start with the quotidian (Bread, potatoes, barbecued pigs, roses and the like) and expand outwards , opening them out to reveal worlds - anthropology, evolution, economics, psychology, desire, history, chemistry, biology, physics, feminism, capitalism, poetry, metaphor, the interconnectedness of all................I could spool on, endlessly, the big concepts Pollan (and Apt Russell) connect, by starting on the basic stuff of matter - food, shelter, and weaving it all together<br /><br />In this book, he examines something so basic, cooking - and indeed the lack of it, in the `developed' Western world. Something which once created social bonds and community disappears as we spend more time in front of screens, eating `convenience' ready meals which have not been made by anyone we know.<br /><br />Almost the first gauntlet which Pollan throws down is the one which asks, `just what is it which makes us human, and different from `dumb beasts?' And as the things which formerly we thought of as `human' - for example, language, empathy, ability to problem solve, are increasingly shown by animal behaviourists to occur in other species - he concludes `we are the cooking animal' - and perhaps controversially suggests that from cooking all else of our developed, intelligent humanity, flowed<br /><br />That sounds a ridiculous statement - except when it is put together with the fact that cooking not only tenderises sinewy animal muscle, softens and makes available resistant plant fibres - but means we no longer have to spend most of our waking hours chewing, in order to get at nutrients. Even more usefully the chemical changes produced by cooking releases nutrients more easily, in an easier to assimilate form. More calories available for less expenditure of calories. Less work for the gut (and the jaw) and a higher yield of glucose for the brain.<br /><br />This book compares cooking to alchemy - and indeed, he breaks his chapters down to the poetic and alchemic four elements of fire, water, air, earth.<br /><br />At the beginning of each section of the book, are different displays of circle logos. Don't miss these - they are actually quite profound in terms of visually, what they are saying about the inner nature of each cooking process. Pollan thinks like a mystic!<br /><br />Fire, the first, the earliest cooking - the `dangerous' primitive cooking of the hunt (and still, today, men are more willing to take charge of the `mysteries of the `barbie' then to move indoors to the deeper alchemy of the kitchen)<br /><br />Water - the next major step, the more mysterious, more advanced `inside the home' cooking - which needed to wait for the development of cooking vessels - this became what was seen as `women's work' - cooking in a liquid. No longer the fire directly heating the food, fire tamed to heat liquid which heats a more complex possibility of flavour, not to mention a greater complexity of chemistry, as this is cooked in combination with that, that and that.<br /><br />Air - the mysterious agency when our `cooking' gets done by some other transformational agent - yeasts, enabling us to finally access the nutrients in grain (as we evolve to an agricultural society) - the alchemy of yeast, grains and breads. In this section he almost for me rounds the journey of the book. He reminds us again of the evolutionary advance cooking represents - a way of processing what is, or what might be, edible, in order to make more of its nutrients available, so giving us the advantage towards greater health and wellbeing. Traditional bread making, whereby WE are able to get at the seed potential, the embryo for the germination of new seed.<br /><br />And then, as he reminds us, we score a fatal own goal - moving from the health giving 'processing' of cooking itself, to OVER processing whereby we strip what is nutritious, producing a substance quickly (the commercial white bread loaf) that not only has no nutritional value at all, but is in fact detrimental to health. This then has to have other, synthetic forms of what WAS nutritious in the first place, added back in. The contrast between mankind's initial discovery of how to utilise the goodness of whole grains - time an integral part of the process, allowing slow fermentation to break down and transform proteins, fats and carbohydates - and modern breeding of strains of wheat which are easier (quicker) to process, fitting modern machinery, but are less rich in nutritional value, is clear.<br /><br />The final chapter, `earth' continues the process with preservation through the fermentation process without 'cooking' - salting, pickling, cheesemaking, brewing - or, as Pollan much more evocatively subtitles this section - Earth - Fermentation's Cold Fire. Indeed, he takes his conceit further, what we are seeing, in fermentation is the move from life to death - the grape, once perfectly ripe, begins to decay, break down, and ferment to wine; the milk soured into yoghurt or cheese; the cabbage into sauerkraut. Or, put another way<br /><br />\\" these transformations depend on the fermenter's careful management of rot, on taking the decompositions of those seeds and fruits and fleshes just so far and no farther\\"<br /><br />I could go on - and on - and even more on about the delights of this book, but really, yours is the journey to make.<br /><br />If you don't much enjoy cooking, this might inspire you to connect with its mysteries (though its not `a cookery book') if you love cooking, you will feel like some entrant into ancient mysteries as you engage with your next kitchen assignment<br /><br />I was extremely delighted to receive this as part of the Amazon Vine programme in the UKhe germination of new seed.<br /><br />And then, as he reminds us, we score a fatal own goal - moving from the health giving 'processing' of cooking itself, to OVER processing whereby we strip what is nutritious, producing a substance quickly (the commercial white bread loaf) that not only has no nutritional value at all, but is in fact detrimental to health.

B009K72RRS|5.0|I did not buy all of Season 5.  I just bought the Darth Maul episodes.  Why can't the movies be this good.
B008602KQI|1.0|We let kids watch this kind of movie and we wonder why we have teenage mass killers? Instead of PG-13 this should be rated NC-17.
B005R2PDL2|5.0|Deva Primal and Miten are two of my favorite folks.  Have been to many of their concerts and one vacation to the Caribbean with them filled with great music, food, people and dolphins.<br />Theirmusic will heal you and lift you to places of peace and love.  Truly.
1847879071|5.0|This is the best Statistics book ever. I am a graduate student, and the required text for my Statistics course was a 20lbs monstrosity. I could read the same chapter twice and still have no clue what they were talking about. I was desperate for help until a Google search lead me to Professor Andy Field's YouTube Videos on statistics. I bought this book and it has made all the difference. This book will stay by my side through my thesis, phd dissertation, and my postdoc!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Loved this book. A quick and suspenseful read. My fiancé and I read this together and enjoyed talking about what we thought would happen. Looking forward to reading more by Grisham.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Interesting developments as the story unfolds bit by bit. I saw some of it coming, but not the end result.
B008602KQI|5.0|Can't wait for the subsequent films.  It's requiring 12 more words to fill up this review.  So that is it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was absolutely my favorite, not gory at all, and kept me on the edge of my seat. Too many emotions for each individual character you meet. Whether it hatred or love or weeping that they are gone are all apart of this book.
B001EBWITA|5.0|Can't say enough about this movie.  Reeves' best work in my opinion.  I wish it had lasted 2 more hours.  The scenes of hell were horrible and wonderful at the same time. 5 stars!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My daughter found and downloaded this game and she hasn't stopped playing it since. It's an awesome and addicting game for the whole family!!!!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I have been looking for this movie for months, for my nephew. He was so excited when he open the gift. Thank you for the happiness I saw on his face when saw the it was the movie &#34;Ratatouille&#34;.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is the best movie of the entire series.  Every scene, shot and frame is a Gesamtkunstwerk-a complete work of art blending color, myth, story, music, and mood that flows into the viewer's mind.  It is hypnotic.<br /><br />The movie advances the series story in that Ron and Hermione reveal their feelings for each other and Harry likewise shows his feelings for Ginny.  Additionally, Voldemort appears to triumph over Dumbledore.  As a result the entire movie, from one end to another invokes a dark spirituality that taps into the deepest myths of Western Civilization.  One scene combines the myth of Merlin and Beowulf in a magical showdown in a cave.<br /><br />Superb acting by all parties-especially Jim Broadbent who plays a delightful Professor Slughorn as well as Tom Fleton's outstanding portrayal of the torn Draco Malfoy<br /><br />The best movie of the entire series-rich, complex, intense, and satisfying.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed watching this entire series immensely and can't wait for the next season.  In my opinion, this represents programming at it's best.
B00B2166BS|5.0|The cable attaches easily. It is a one way attachment. This cable has matching magnets. Mine only attaches one way. I feel the magnetic attachment is far superior to the clamping action of the USB. Now my USB connection can be saved for when it's necessary. I definitely recommended it.
B00A7CF1QY|4.0|But I do like the Jason Bourne character better. I kind of hope they merge they're stories and do one more.

B001AW156U|5.0|The product was in tip top shape and was easy to put on and it came with two Silicone Caps. At first I received the wrong product but I quickly contacted the seller and he sent me the correct one and it came in about 3 days.This seller can be trusted and I can for see me buying more from him.
B006UN3K4O|5.0|could not put it down and i bought 2 hard copies and sent one to a friend in Canada and one  to my son in Australia.highly recommend it.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Really fun twist with a female Watson. Lucy Lui does a great job as a humble, smart, compassionate Watson. Love all the NYC scenes. Just a well done, unfussy version of a classic.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|If you like MIB movies, you'll enjoy this one too. Typical plot and good special effects. What's more can I say?
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book. Couldn't put it down! The moment you think you know what's going to happen, new surprises come around the corner. Highly recommend.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|I really liked the 1st three with Matt Damon. This one is different in several aspects and it is good, but...
B006M4F67A|1.0|I played three games and the second game locked up so what other reviewers say is true. It will lock up. There are more than four of each type of tiles which seems to break all the rules for a good game. So in my opinion not real mahjong. Otherwise game seems ok. I am still looking for good mahjongg game for my kindlefire because this is not it.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|First let me say I am definitely a fan of Tina Fey. While the book was enjoyable, I expected more. There were some funny parts and it was a pleasant look behind the scenes but it just didn't live up to the hype for me.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Didn't think I would like a time travel book but once again, Stephen King hit a home run!  I actually felt like I was in the story byway he described the characters and places.  Would highly recommend this to everyone!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Seems well made, fits the tablet snuggly in place and I say looks great.  The kids say &#34;it looks like a bible&#34;.  Can I rate my kids now....<br />I would definitly buy again.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|It is a good book. I have lived with someone with post traumatic stress disorder for my entire life and this book really puts that into perspective. I just really want to know how his movie ended. All in all I would recommend this book.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|A fantastic novel, full of adventures and great characters. For all those that love fantasy and adventures. I will read the next novel right away!
0345529057|5.0|These books are fantastic!! You will not regret diving into these pages and entering into a world of knights and kingdoms, dragons, magic, fear and passion! Enjoy!
B00992CF6W|4.0|has a lot of things from origional mineceaft for Pc but caves etc. sometimes deleted all of the blocks that u place.
B002ZG99QS|4.0|While this isn't an amazing movie, I enjoy it a lot. It's got a great soundtrack, beautiful color, and super fun concepts. A great play off of the old Tron.
B0015346OM|5.0|Hands down, this is the best military history book I've read. You feel the tension almost as if you're there with the Rangers and their fellow soldiers, battling through the streets of Mogadishu. You feel their despair when they're stranded out there. Just an incredible read.
B000QCQ9O8|5.0|Beautifully written story of the tragic error of misunderstanding! A master storyteller!<br /><br />These characters come alive under the examination of Mc Ewan's pen.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|I didn't expect high art.  However, I hoped for a fun movie that didn't exploit every stereotype about fat people, Asians, and so called 'nerds' that exist. Thrown in for good measure was the earnest outsider, the caring boyfriend, the sorority girl and her friend with a conscience. If there was a cliche to be found, it was in this movie.<br /><br />There was no unanticipated plot point, the singing was average to fair and the ending was seen a mile off.  Don't waste your time...the music isn't worth it.
B007ZSBQYE|2.0|This game features absolutely horrible user interface. They didn't even include sound options. Which would've been nice considering how obnoxious the sound is. I'm glad I got to try this game for free thanks to Amazon. Because had I paid for this, it would've been down to just one star. If the developers polish this game and give it more time, this game would be an ok addition to anyone's collection.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|One of the best books I've read. The series is very good as well. You have to read this book and the series.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|Very fun game! Great graphics as well. Both fans of Star Wars and pinball will not be disappointed!  Challenging game as well!
B00BIRRDZ4|4.0|Dawes third album does not disappoint. It is a bit more varied as far as tempo and style than previous albums. Personally I prefer albums 1 and 2 a bit more than this, but that's just because for those two, every song wowed me, while this album was not as consistent in that regard.<br /><br />Definitely recommend for any current Dawes fans, although I might recommend that someone new to the band may want to start with an older album to be totally blown away.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Amazing movie - wonderful Discs - I have both a Blue Ray and regular Dvd player.  Both of the discs were fantastic!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game has gorgeous graphics, easy and intuitive game play, and a unique and complex storyline. It really takes the physics based game design to an artful and pleasant level. I love that you can skip any level, so you never really get stuck. HIgh replay value, and an interesting conversation starter. I cant' recommend this highly enough.
B006FE83UE|5.0|I was most impressed. I just finished directing a stage version of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, and was curious to see if my version and the movie could possibly match. They did. When I saw the film, I was first impressed on how up to date the production was. It is difficult to realize that it's 50 years old. I was, of course, impressed with both the directing and acting. There is a sensitivity that underscores everything. Many many reactions are subtle. The pace is always moving, Camera angles portray strengths and weaknesses. I loved it all. The second disc of the set was a long interview with a much older Gregory Peck. Warm and insightful it was, and always interesting.<br />I would recommend this movie to anyone with a hunger for good film.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This has awesome graphics and I love the controls. It's so good that it freaked me out and I can't play it before bed anymore. Docked a star, not for the quality of the design, but because I guess I don't like spooky games as much as I thought I would. Just didn't want to say &#34;I loved it&#34;. I wish there was an &#34;it's great, just not for me&#34; rating.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Lots of fun and great graphics for the small screen.  My only issue is that it sometimes will pick up my finger even though it is way from the arrow but once you get the hang of it there is a lot of fun.
B00933JL0A|3.0|This was a good play on the bus game for me for about two weeks. It's very repetitive and the choices you make about which building or townspeople to add don't' matter at all. Eventually everyone gets exactly the same town. Once you beat the game and build a castle, there isn't any replay value.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Great way to get YouTube clips onto the Kindle Fire without a hassle, sometimes these Aps can be confusing, this one is easy to use and worked well. Don't need to be on line when watching it later.
B00BJA2VFW|2.0|This is my fault for not being into these matching/swapping casual games in the first place, but this had such high ratings I though maybe it would be more fun than bejewelled or other similar games. If you like bejewelled, you'll probably love this. I thought it was boring and felt compelled to keep playing for a few days just in case the building the tree &#34;plot&#34; got more interesting. It doesn't. The only slightly fun extra in this game is the blueprint levels where the tiles drop in from above and you try to collect enough water drops to fill a meter. This was almost entertaining. Overall, a giant flashy YAWN.
B003405MF6|5.0|This album is definitely 5-Star! The only drawback is the first 4 selections seem to blend directly into the next, which is kind of annoying if one wishes to program them differently via computer/CD. I was a bit disappointed in that &#34;Cry Me A River&#34; was actually not included on the physical CD, but included as a download; to be honest, this selection among the many on this excellent CD is my all time favorite as to Jeff Beck. Well worth the purchase!
B008476HBM|5.0|The characters are well developed, the story is compelling, and I couldn't wait to find out how it all ended!  A true classic that transcends any era.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I chose this rating because it is a thoughtful series. Lots of drama, twists and surprise outcomes. Sutter writes a great storyline. The cast intrepret his story well. What a rowdy band of misfits! When is Season five being released and when is Six coming?????
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|If you haven't seen it yet your missing out.I turned so many people onto the show they get hooked as I did AMC is the best.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|This has always been an inspiring story on book and a great movie with Sandra Bullock.  Great price for such a classic.
B00992CF6W|5.0|BEST APP EVER YOU REALLY REALLY SHOULD GET IT OF U DONT THEN YOU DO NOT HAVE THE BEST APP EVER HAHAHAHA &lt;3 ME
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|We all loved the movie and the 5year old never moved his head from the LG. I buy these now,because they want to see the good ones over and over.
B00CAJP0ZO|3.0|This is Love - Scream and Shout - Let's Go - Geekin - That Power - Great Times are Coming - Ghetto, Ghetto etc<br /><br />Eight good songs [[ASIN:B00CAJP0ZO #willpower [Explicit]]]worth $5.00  BUY  THE  ALBUM  (young people need music WITHOUT PROFANITY)
B00CHILW64|5.0|Movie kept my attention from beginning to end,still pain I my leg.naomi watts was spectacular and very very believe able.
B000AU9UYC|5.0|I never really considered myself a big batman fan but compared to the previous batman movies this one definitely had my attention. Because I actually saw Dark Knight first I had to go back and see this one and it's a pretty good movie.
B00BESFWBY|4.0|A movie with great surfing footage and a good story line but not the greatest performances by a few of the cast. I see they will all grow as actors but this flick did not have the drama to keep you engaged. HOWEVER, this is a true story and once that is understood it makes it a good 4 star movie to enjoy with the 9 year old and ups.<br /><br />So I did not realize this was a true story until the end which changes your perspective in a hurry.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|High school all over again but with better word play.  Amusing situations!  The only negative I see is that the episodes are too short.
B003102JDM|5.0|This belongs on the list of films to watch before you die! My compliments to the Coen brothers. Keep up the good work.
1419705849|5.0|I don't get the attraction, but my son loved it, and the point was to buy an 11 year old boy a book he would read.  And read it he did.  He barely put it down.
B004G600A4|5.0|If you got kids or you are a kid yourself then I highly recommend see this great entertaining and funny toon.
B007CKNX28|5.0|Thank you for this excellent album, Jack. You are an eloquent poet and a phenomenal musician. This debut solo album rocks! Love it!!! It has been a long time since I have heard something this rad. Every aspect, from the tape-to-tape analogue recording technique (big, fat, juicy rock and roll sound, not overproduced) to the lyrics, musicianship, cover art et cetera is right on.I have been intrigued for some time by the Stripes work as well, and am inspired by the expansion and direction that Jack is embracing as he ventures out on his own. I can see Jack crossing over from Indie artist to a wider more mainstream audience as one of the most significant rock artists of our time.  Every track is great, especially  the carnival sounding pianos in Hypocritical Kiss and the brilliant lyrics which express vast and difficult emotions in a way that makes me smile. Love Interruption is also poignant and so pertinent. My favorite track is the beautiful On and On and On.... Jack's skills as a poet are hauntingly highlighted here. Thank you for this AMAZINGLY great album!! Can't wait for the next one...
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I don't have the time for a lon review but the item came on time and in great shape.  I was very happy
0525478817|5.0|Nope can't do it. If I start talking about this book I automatically start tearing up. What a beautiful beautiful story John Green has given us. I will alway be thankful for this book and the beauty that it has created.<br /><br />There are people out there who are much more eloquent than me and can write a better review than I can so I will leave them to it. Just know that I love every. single. second. of this book.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I don't have time for a long review.  Purchased this item cause I could not wait  for netflix any more.
B002APU580|5.0|My all-time favorite novel! Jane Austin at her best. A great story about love and misunderstanding. If you haven't read it yet, get it!!!!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|With great characters and story lines. Well castes and Vic is the bad cop that you end up cheering for.
B00B361HO8|2.0|The Music is very good, but the condition of the disk was the worst. So, I had to use the disk flatter and the disk condition is getting better. I think the original packing way is bad, because the thin vinyl covered the jacket was shrink and it caused the disk bending.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|I was telling a friend how much I loved Downton Abbey and she told me to have a look at Upstairs Downstairs as she thought that I would enjoy it.  Well enjoy it I did!  I was totally hooked and spent every moment that I could watching it on my kindle.  There is something for everybody thrills, love and romance, social drama and war drama. It's a must see.
B007ZSBQYE|4.0|The controls of this game a pretty self explanatory.  In the bottom left corner of the screen,  slide control right or left for steering.  In the bottom right corner of screen, up arrow moves car forward and down arrow moves it back.  Of course, there is a stop button.  There is also a tilt control option.  The third control option uses a \\"steering wheel.\\"  In all modes, after your third bump into the wall, you must start over.<br /><br />My wife and I found this game to be difficult and frustrating.  In all fairness, I am hopeless when it comes to most video games.  My playing ability is not an accurate gauge of how good or bad a game is.  (However, if I can successfully play a game, it means everyone can.) I must say though, this game does not \\"drive\\" the same as an actual car.<br /><br />My wife, who is much better at video games than I, had a hard time with this game. She also made the comment that the car in this game does not drive like a real car. Lastly, my wife feels that the turning radius of the car is not very good.<br /><br />Now, my ten-year old daughter on the other hand:  She has gotten past several levels.  Even as I write this review, I can hear my wife and daughter screaming, \\"Noooo\\" as my daughter bumps her car for the third time.  There is also some \\"heated discussion\\" between them as to how to best steer the car.  I guess this game is not so bad because my daughter has gotten to the levels where her vehicles were a truck, van, and jeep.  She also got to the point where you carry cargo in the back of your vehicle and you must avoid letting the cargo fall out.  We're speculating that one of the top  levels might have you driving a large semi truck.<br /><br />My daughter has been playing this game for over an hour, so the game has some play time longevity. She's muttering to herself quite a bit though.  Her most recent comment was, \\"Dad, you're very lucky your Kindle's screen is made of 'Gorilla Glass' because I'm going to throw your Kindle any moment now.\\"  She does not care for the tilt control option or the steering wheel control option.<br /><br />We all think that the fact that my daughter has never driven an actual car before gives her an advantage in playing this game.  Four star rating for the sake of my daughter.  My wife and I would have given the game a two star rating.  Overall, this game can be pretty tedious.<br /><br />So there you have it folks.  Throw everything you know about vehicle steering out the window and just \\"go with it.\\"  Younger players will have an advantage.  The rest of us Kindle owners will indeed be glad that our screens are made out of Gorilla Glass.oment now.\\"  She does not care for the tilt control option or the steering wheel control option.<br /><br />We all think that the fact that my daughter has never driven an actual car before gives her an advantage in playing this game.

B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is an adventure game where you have to solve the mystery and have some hidden object mini games thrown in. Nice hint button. Not too hard but does make you think. I liked it. Full game is $4.99 but you get quite a lot of game in the free sample.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Fun game to play make you think the speed rounds are the best.I recommend this game to pass the time away.turn the sound off you will enjoy the game more
B00881PTRC|5.0|I really like the graphics in this game. Its so cute that i occasionally deliberately put a wrong letter down just to see what he does this time. Words are set up in categories and the ones i have tried are a fair mix of common and uncommon words. Well worth .99 and i will be keeping this game on my favorites.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|This game never seems to work properly.  Either it locked me out or it will only let me draw with my friend and won't let me see or guess what she's drawn.  I've given up on it.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Good watch for any & all who have there head in the sand. The next time you take a run to the grocery store, you'll give things a second thought.
B001DM1VXE|1.0|It was bad, really bad. The main character was crazy and by midway through the movie so was I. I couldn't finish it.
B009IJJB8G|4.0|An intesting modern yet charming new take on our troubled hero and his faithful companion. Additional character development and progression fulfil the promise of season one.
B008602KQI|4.0|Good story. The characters were believable and engaging. By the end of the movie you find yourself involved in their lives.
B00AFYZDL2|5.0|I am a new fan of Saxon's,having only been with them since \\"Call To Arms\\". I thought I would give it try because I liked the cover and I seen Biff Byford on 'That Metal Show'.I loved it and I love this.This album is way above a lot of metal that probably sells better.I can say that because I've been listening to hard rock and metal since the rain began to fall at the beginning of the 1st Black Sabbath album.This followup to \\"Arms\\" is awesome and it sounds amazing.Most metal bands,fall in line BEHIND Saxon.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I enjoyed this movie because it was believable. The only thing I thought was Hollywood was Lincoln taking the Lord's name in vain. I think it was out of character for Lincoln to do so.
B00AKFG15S|3.0|predictable story... one can guess the next page.... expected much more from archer......expected him to be more innovative in content and innovation
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|It is fast paced and easy to learn.  Even my 3 year old can play.  Good game for the entire family.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This was a fun and adventurous game!!!! This was very fun and  if you enjoy matching games this is a great one!!!
B00335EQ0E|5.0|This is a very great movie. It took me back to my childhood. I have watched it many times since I purchased it.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|It is a great story set in a time long ago. When men had to make choices that were life and death every day. I love the way it flows back and forth between the characters.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Everyone should have this game! It is very addicting! It is very great quality and very fun. Just don't blow your one free cheat foolishly...
B008JFLWLE|5.0|I love it. Its a great app for people who need calculator.You can write what need and it will give you an answer.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works as designed every time. I'm using this app for a college course and its always right on. Just what I needed, nice big buttons, so no worries on fat fingering the buttons.
B009ZE27US|5.0|I know that a lot of people rated it 1 star because it probably didn't even come close to your actual age.But,that's why its important to read the description first.This app is not ACTUALLY going to guess your age correctly,but it says clearly in the description that its supposed to help you prank your family and friends.So please,read the description FIRST before downloading!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's really good, its a high score game so you beat your friends high score. Its got so many chances to get lots of coins. Only bad point there's an advert everytime you try play a game but that might just be the tablet you have...
B0001V6ZJ8|5.0|Earlier I sent a message to say I couldn't access the DVD. Now realise it was my player at fault ( or my  error). Have viewed Moulin ROuge, and love it as much as I did in 1954. Excellent service and quality. Thanks  Rene
B007SGM084|5.0|I don't like to read, but this book you ask???? It's wonderful!!! Every time I put the book down, I would pick it right back up. I read this book 3 and 4 hours straight sometimes. It's GREAT!!!
B0012TWRAO|5.0|This is a great RAM mount that I use on my bicycle handlebars. It comes with two different size u base pieces for wider or narrower handlebars and a plastic/hard rubber insert that holds the u-base against the handlebars when you tighten it up.<br />Really an excellent design.<br /><br />However, my order was filled by &#34;GPS Cheap&#34; and it took almost 3 weeks with no feedback at all on tracking information or anything. After about 2 weeks, I finally contacted them and they said they'd check it out and I hadn't heard from them in 3 days and then the mounting arrived. Now it looks like &#34;GPS Cheap&#34; is no longer selling this item, so you're probably safe from having to deal with them.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I dont have Internet at home yet, but the little bit Ive used my Amazon Kindle Fire Tablet, I Know Im really going to like it!
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I like this show much better than the other political and law and order dramas.  To me, this show felt like a good compromise between Law and Order and The Wire.  I like both for their grasp and scope, and the Good Wife does this two things well.  The acting is very strong too.  And the characters are very multidimensional, much like real people.  Sometimes, it might get carried away with themes and one dimensional emotions, but overall it's a great entertainment.
030758836X|1.0|I read this book because it made a few \\"Top Books of 2012\\" lists and for the life of me I do not understand why.  Neither lead character has any redeeming qualities; I did not care about either of them, so the story never sucked me in.  Even if I step back and compare it to other books written about dysfunctional people, it pales by comparison. Very disappointed!
B00C7KYXHW|3.0|Every person I've spoken to says the same things about this series: it' tough to watch; it stays with you; don't watch alone. Everyone also says the series is pretty well done and entertaining. There is something clearly wrong with our culture that we are entertained by this program, but we are anyway. Spoiler: I question how long Will can go on being duped by Hannibal. The writers have got their work cut out for them. Soon, their relationship will become silly.
078322611X|5.0|This movie helps to showcase the &#34;mystique&#34; which surrounds the sport of baseball. This movie is a great family piece and deserves a place on everyone's DVD rack.
B00BIVN82M|2.0|I will give this CD 2 Stars to match the number of songs that I liked on it, TWO!  A very Mediocre CD to say the Least, definitely the worst one that he has produced.  I have all of his CD's including the Original one recorded in a club in Vancouver, BC.  Amazon does not accept this one back In Trade, I wonder why, do they know something we do not?<br /><br />One other Canadian Singer recently tried moving away from what made them great, Diana Kralls latest CD, Glad Rag Doll, and it had the same results as this CD.<br /><br />NOT WORTH THE TIME TO LISTEN TO, Sad!
0670024813|2.0|I bought the book because I like other books he has written.  This book seems to be just a rehash of things that have been written about before by Diamond or others. His choice of people to study seems to be arbitrary.
B00C1BUYX4|4.0|This is a great historical movie which leaves you with quite a bit to think was bout after watching. I think it has a documentary feel about it as well as a movie story driven appeal.
B002WNC5BU|5.0|I must say, I wasn't the biggest Led Zeppelin, U2, or Jack White fan before I watched this. After viewing it, I have a new found respect for the artists involved. Now, I can't wait to experience more.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|This was a pleasant, poignant movie. Everyone dreams about having &#34;powers&#34; and the little girl in this movie (when she actually develops a 'power') uses hers in a sweet, life-saving way.
B00009R6J7|5.0|I tried a cheap clone of this and the bubbles were only about 1/3 as wide as the marks and the vertical axis was 2 degrees off.  Sent it back and got this one.  Its VERY accurate and the bubbles reach both lines like a level is supposed to work.  Its made in Italy and very well done.  Fits the hot shoe just right, not to tight or loose.  Very good product.
B000ID37KO|4.0|One of Hitchcock's classics.  Still entertaining and attention getting. Worth watching again even though the technology has improved now with computer graphics.
B00499QUK2|5.0|At first I was not sure I would like a contemporary version of the classic Sherlock Holmes.  But must say that the first season was very well-crafted.
1463707606|5.0|Love the book; easy to follow instructions and very unique designs.  I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Origami.
B008133MDK|4.0|A few more liberties than the first and I don't care for a racy element to the great master detective.  Captivating and no dull moments.
B008JFUNYG|4.0|Before I get started, I'd like to say that this is not the original movie. Nothing ever will be and while comparison of some type will be inevitable, it's not entirely fair to automatically dismiss it because it's a remake. If by some chance the original wasn't released at all, this probably would have gotten a little less hate than I've seen some give it.<br /><br />Is this scary? Sometimes, although this is almost solely the jump-scare type of movie. You have some freaky images, but it's not really a psychological horror film. Insert freaky looking demonic girl in the mirror. Insert tree limb/tentacle. (drum riff) This is one of those cheap scare type of films that people will either like or hate, although we have to remember that this is sort of what the original was like as well. I can't fault it for being what it is and I was nicely entertained by the \\"booga booga I'm a scary demon\\" stuff.<br /><br />The story was good, although I occasionally felt like it could have been a little more than what it was. That would have involved straying further from the original story, but there was a lot here that could have been done. How did the book get there? Did the book have anything to do with things that happened to the mother of our siblings? There's room left here for a sequel, but I couldn't help but think that this could have evened out a little of the various slow points of the movie.<br /><br />My only sore point for this film would be the ending. This is one of those films that have several false endings. After the first one, sure. Why not? But then you get another \\"totally last showdown\\" and I couldn't help but get impatient for it to just do what it was going to do and finish already. This made the ending a little more underwhelming than I'd like. It's still fun, but too overly done.<br /><br />I would actually recommend this to people who want a nice easygoing scary film. Maybe it's not really totally scary to where you'd stay up at night, but it's fun enough that it'd be worth seeing with a good group of people.that it'd be worth seeing with a good group of people.
B0018PJEYY|1.0|several songs are not original and are make overs and they stink. I am disappointed when I buy a cd  album it should be the same as original Don't buy.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|This season is full of surprises and great stories, some of which you might have found on the Twighlight Zone.
B0018BB21G|1.0|Several songs are not original and are make overs and they stink. I am disappointed when I buy a cd  album it should be the same as original Don't buy
B0072S9KU4|3.0|Had potential to be so much more; but, it just left you unfulfilled and wanting more. The Acting was very good. (Not sure why the reviews for this movie are mixed in w/reviews for \\"Hellboy\\" movie?!?!?!?)
B0018LMZO4|1.0|several songs are not original and are make overs and they stink. I am disappointed when I buy a cd  album it should be the same as original Don't buy Legend of A Mind is awful.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|I have seen nearly all the Sherlock Holmes versions, and Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman (with the genius writing of Mark Gatiss & Steven Moffat, and all the rest of the crew and cast) have created the &#34;truest&#34; version of ACD's Sherlock and Watson.  This just sits in my DVD player for when I need something I love to be on.  A fabulous version of ACD's stories and superb performances by Benedict and Martin (along with the rest of the cast.... and Lara Pulver is sublime as Irene!)  Longing for Season 3!
B0018LMZOE|1.0|Several songs are not original and are make overs and they stink. I am disappointed when I buy a cd  album it should be the same as original Don't buy
B004132HZS|5.0|The greatest collaboration of writing, casting and performances (among everything else that goes into making a fabulous show)!  Everything about this is &#34;true&#34; to ACD's Sherlock Holmes.
B000I186FW|5.0|This is a fantastic movie. Gets me Everytime, with just the right amount of violence ,action, emotion, and a beautiful storyline / plot this is a movie anyone will enjoy.
B00910Y1OQ|3.0|Just got this game because of the past reviews I seen.  I say it is okay because it wasn't very challanging for me it seemed too easy to get through the levels.  As I have played more I have seen it getting more challanging.  It can do without so much storytelling between levels.
B0052RE4MQ|2.0|I LOOOOVVED the first, but when it came to this one, I didn't like it at all, I couldn't even finish it! I got so bored.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a book!  This was a real twisted story and a fast read.  I loved it.  I'm hoping for a sequal.
B009MF56GC|4.0|I like pure action and this is a film right up my alley,great cast all baby bommers who still look and act tough! A few surprises and a couple of new and young stars! Good film for a cold night!!!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Very good time killer and I love how you can earn game dollars without spending money. Nice job people who made the game.
1594203334|3.0|While it is silly, it was also mildly entertaining to listen to while I was doing other things. Although the reader was truly awful.<br /><br />Of course, this is not a child-raising primer or font of reliable information. It is just a sort of entertainment, & should be read (listened to ) as such.<br /><br />Just to illustrate how nonsensical such books are:<br />A young & very personable member of my family recently went to a French family farm to learn cheesemaking. The French children did not say \\"bonjour\\" to her, nor did they participate in any adult conversation. A typical meal: spaghetti with tomato sauce--butter on the noodles for my vegetarian relation, with pre-grated parmesan in a plastic bag (even though fresh cheese was made on the farm) accompanied by lettuce with lemon to squeeze over it. The children did not eat lettuce, though. Nor were they interested in the delicious cheeses their parents made. My American relative is an excellent cook, and took over the kitchen. The parents were delighted with her quiches,which incorporated vegetables from the garden, her soups, veggie burgers, & lots of other meals made from fresh ingredients. The children, however, sullenly refused to eat any vegetables in any form, & stuck to noodles with meat sauce.<br /><br />Were they anomalous? It seems not. Their visiting school friends displayed similar eating habits & lack of social skills.<br /><br />If read as pure fiction, this is a fun book. It definitely tells more about the authors' dismal lack of parenting skills rather than imparts useful advice, or documents French child rearing culture.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Inside you will meet some great characters, from the tragic to the heroic they are all well written.  The story reminds and warns of what were are capable of as humans.  Howey's writing make you feel their pain, their love and their sacrifice.  One must not forget the role the setting plays. At times the silo feels so expansive, journey's often take days! At others, so claustrophobic you'll be holding your breath and not know it. A definite must read.
B009YG2ND8|4.0|The audio gets choppy at times and the controls can get annoying. But the way you can zoom in and gameplay is solid.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This was a very good movie. Well deserving of all the praise it has received. The pace was well done allowing it to move along rather then getting bogged down in the politics.
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|I was 18 when this movie came out. My brother and I saw it a few times. We laughed over and over again in all the same places, and we pondered the deeper meaning of it. It has remained one of my favorite movies. Ruth Gordon was brilliant and contemporary in her advanced age. I think it's a truly worthwhile movie to watch! Cat Stevens music was perfect for the sound track!
B00BF11STU|4.0|I'm all for action movies.  But one that is based on relatively real life events, well even better.  I enjoyed seeing new comers to Hollywood, and the perceived events of that fateful day in Pakistan.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Great performances by Helen Hunt, John Hawkes, William Macy, and Moon Bloodgood. Very believable, except maybe Helen Hunt's Boston accent. It is an amazing story and breaks stereotypes of a different kind. So beautiful the way the friends and aides of the disabled man treat him in a way that allow him his dignity.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I &lt;3 this app it rules I adore this app my favorite character is Lucy I love her hair so much
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Smart show, hope they can keep all the balls in the air.  Good acting and writing so far.  Try it out.
B0038P59A0|3.0|I wasn't a big fan of the choppy, slow motion scenes where Sherlock would picture what he would do and then do it.  I understand the concept of letting us know exactly what it was doing when he would do it, but I felt like it took away from it.  Aside from that, the story was really good along with the acting.
B006S08RLU|5.0|Amelie is a fairy tale for grown-ups, a story full of lovably odd-ball characters who live in a beautiful story-book version of Paris. They are all flawed, but for the most part in charming ways. In this dreamy world Amelie is like a mostly beneficent sprite who moves through the lives of the other people, sometimes at lightning speed, doing good deeds and playing pranks that are usually harmless. At the same time, this adorable pixie is in her clumsy way searching for love with a young man that she doesn't even know. The ending is fairly predictable but getting there is so much fun, with many silly detours along the way.<br />The only &#34;real&#34; thing in this film are the sumptuous Parisian locations. The colors are lavish and brilliant like a child's story-book, and some scenes are done in a cartoonish sped-up pace. All this makes the viewer suspend belief and revel in this happy world where good things happen to good people and even the (not so very) bad people only get a slap on the wrist.
B008476HBM|5.0|Anyone that has never read a Jane Austen book doesn't know what they're missing.  I've read all of her books and watched all of her movies.  She knew how to write a book that would stand the test of time!
B002VECM6S|4.0|Very good and interesting story. Fits our life style and what is going on now in our life. Recommend highly for anyone.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|You either love it or hate it.  I thought of someone that Bradley Cooper reminded me of so I thought it was hilarious, and loved the entire cast!  There were a few slow parts, but whenever Jennifer Lawrence was chewing him or Robert De Niro, it was hilarious.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have found a little of everything I'm interested in on Pinterest, i.e crafts, food and gardening and so much more!
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|I love all of these types of games.  I have all of these games.  I find them incredibly fun and time consuming.  However, I find it annoying how you buy the app, under the impression that once you pay the first time you have everything, just to find out you need to purchase it more than once to get the FULL version.  On iTunes,I can buy it ONCE for $1.99, Kindle addition I have to pay $1.99 TWICE.  This is annoying.  One-and-done purchases are much more convenient.
144185696X|5.0|I am so out of sequence with Harry Bosch but each time I find a new one I haven't read I read it.  This is an excellent story full of struggles that Bosch seems to glide through.  Harry's superiors in the department are either being very callous or trying to control his every move.  He does his job and does it well, getting to the core of the situation.  This story is no different.  One of the best written by Michael Connelly do not miss it.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|At first I thought it was just a simple calculator, but then I realized it had the ability to memorize and save all of my calculations. This is a very helpful feature. Great for keeping your check book balanced too. Who would have thunk it. Thanks again Amazon
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was extremely captivating. I'd definitely recommend it to everyone. Much better than the movie! (Although I found that good as well!)
B0058YPG1G|5.0|loved it !!! great show ...wonderful acting...suspensful...interesting ...great characters....love the scenery ....walter white is a complicated person ...seeing all of his inner changes are amazing !!!!!!
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|First time reading this classic. After first it was kinda hard to understand due to the way they &#34;talked&#34; back then. But you start to learn as you go. Good fun story. Everyone should read this at least once.
B000MR9D5E|2.0|I don't like giving bad reviews but this prduct isn't what I expected.  There is one cd in particular that doesn't work properly for some reason.  It freezes and then plays a couple frames and freezes again.  I would recommend that anyone who is interested in perchasing this product buy a new one and hope for the best.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|This movie is so good. I mean it. I have to admit I cried.  I was just thinking how come things like that don't happen to me.  :(
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|This app is the same as if you were searching on your computer.  It is very practical and easy to use. I recommend it.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Movie is average but the acting is superb. Daniel Day -Lewis does a wonderful job in his interpretation of Lincoln
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|This is a simple point and click game with easy to follow instructions and a story line that isn't to cheesy. It was worth the money, and a good time waster.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A convincing glimpse into a period and culture we have little exposure to.  Very good character development and somewhat realistic plot.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|At first I loved it, bought two even from the tv ad, buy one get one free. What a waste. It worked well for about the first 20 times, then the battery would die before I even ran it 4 or 5 minutes. I bought a replacement battery from Amazon and it didnt work AT ALL. Chocked it up to live and learn. Also, using it on carpet would clog up the bristles and you have to dig it all out. NOT EASY. If you're planning on using it on a tile floor, the battery would probably work longer, but it doesnt clean the edges, you would still have to break out a broom.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Always intriguing and a bit weird. The characters are love able. We will watch season 2 with great pleasure too
B002SJ2ZTK|4.0|This is an understated movie which although moves at a brisk pace might feel slow to some.<br />It is a fantastic spy/ thriller and although a tad melodramatic as due for its time, it still holds strong with a great plot, and great characters.
B007712XAU|5.0|This is an ABSOLUTE MUST SEE !!!!!!!!!!! You will be hooked from the first episode and won't be able to wait until the next season comes out. I have watched it 3 times and counting :)
B008K8VDPU|1.0|Thought this would be a little like garage band but the other instruments are a piano in a different tone. Don't waste your time.
B0076HNMU0|5.0|My only regret is that it was taken from us, her adoring and devoted followers, before her time.<br /><br />Oh, yeah.... There is this one little thing:<br /><br />       BRING BACK TWIN PEAKS!!!  I NEED MY ONE-EYED JACK'S!!!     
B00BI745AA|1.0|\\"To love another person is to see the face of God.\\" That is a great quote. But carrying someone through a river of $#!+ singing the whole way is definitely Parisian and completely bonkers. It took me 5 hours to get through the damn movie. It was great but what the *#@*!!! WHY all the singing??? The ENTIRE movie was one enormous song. OMFG!!! Because of that I give it 1 (one) little star. If it were maybe half sang and half spoken I would have loved this movie. And what is with the music during the credits. How did this movie get great reviews. If you don't know of what movie I am writing about let it remain a mystery so you too do not have to be one of the miserables.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie pulled me in from the beginning. I watched it because my Grandaughter said I should. I thought this would be just some movie for kids and teenagers. I was so wrong. This is a great and fun watch for all ages.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this considering all the wonderful reviews and publicity; however, it just didn't work for me.  I didn't even finish watching it which I find rather embarrassing in light of what many others have said.  Gosh, I really did want to like this movie but it didn't happen.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I've enjoyed Gillian Flynn's novels.  This is a dark mystery but I was interested to get to the end.  Thanks
B000HKYOK0|5.0|What can I say, it was popular when I was a kid. I still like watching this. We'd have never had Star Wars if not for Star Trek.
1476734941|5.0|I love this book I have started using it.I can tell see the weight loss.What I like about this diet you know you want be restricted the next day.I look forward to even the fast day.I recommend this book highly.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|An exciting lifestyle for a few very brave men. What a great book, a real page turner, couldn't put it down. From beginning to end it was simply excellently written.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|It was an enjoyable read, but slow moving in parts.  Could have used a second perspective story line of the panther carried forward as was the case at the start.
B00BI73CVI|4.0|I was not truly impressed with all the singing however the storyline was great bad boy does good very good
1439156816|5.0|Without this book...I wish I knew how to write the end of that sentence. There's irony there somewhere. The ideas and thoughts presented in this book are indispensable for anyone with even the slightest dream of writing. You can take all the classes you want and read all the books, but without words from a seasoned master of writing, the lessons are hard learned, if ever.<br />Add to that a glimpse into King's personal life, his own personal difficulties and struggles and you get one of the most important resources a reader or writer can get their hands on.
B001JYEMOQ|4.0|Not my favorite Matt Damon movie; however, it's a good suspenseful movie, albeit kind of creepy.  Ripley is a master at fooling people with whom he makes contact.  He is resourceful to the extent he can master a person's persona and, when the occasion calls for it, take their place to deceive another person completely with his role playing.<br /><br />Trouble is Ripley has a temper that when discovered in his assumed roles or his sexual preferences he turns violent to the extent of murder.  Only one person (played by Gwyneth Paltrow) recognizes Ripley for what he really and realizes what he has done.<br /><br />I won't reveal what happens when she confronts Ripley with the father of the man he murdered present.  It is sufficient to say the movie has a surprise and suspenseful ending.
B0094M4R3Q|4.0|I would recommend this as family viewing.  The light hearted presentation was comfortable to watch.  I would watch it again.
B0071T5PN0|4.0|I have always been a fan of Van Halen. Although I never thought a return would have been possible for Roth, and even if it had I figured he would have been burnt out and well past his prime. I was surprised to hear this album and how tight they sounded after a long time apart. Eddie was shredding like days long gone by, Alex was still hammering away on the drums like he has four arms, and the new edition of Eddie's son Wolfgang on bass rounds out a powerful in your face sound much heavier than they ever have played. With Diamond Dave now on the cusp of 60 I wasn't sure what he would bring vocally to the mic. While the high notes of youth are gone to the past, the current notes coming from Dave fit the heavy and hard attitude of this album. He has let the rest of the music world know that he doesn't need to hit his trademark \\"Whoah!\\" to show he has still got it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I was excited each time I finished a group.  It was very hard to put down.  I felt like I succeeded when I hit the end of the game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is really cool. all it is is swards. I think it is a amazing game and you should befit.
0062012339|5.0|Oddly the two best rock n'roll books I have ever read are about bands of whom I am not a huge fan, this book and U2: At the End of the World.<br /><br />This particular book is just brutally honest. Told from the perspective of each individual band member. We hear the tales of their youth all the way up until this book was completed. You learn what created each individual. How Vince was always the rock star even from a young age and in contrast how someone like Mick was always the outcast. And Nikki and Tommy were just dead end kids, headed for nowhere, you clearly see how the band saved them (and nearly killed them as well).<br /><br />The accounts they give are so well put down on paper. From Mick's description of nearly accidentally hanging his little brother at a young age because he simply didn't know better to the incredible chapter about Vince's daughter dying at a young age from cancer. That particular part of the book reduced this big, tough, grown man to absolute tears and that has rarely happened to me from reading mere words. Here is this huge rock star, loaded with resources, someone who could clearly be quite heartless but who can do nothing but watch his little girl die. You have little empathy for Vince before this section (especially after reading his account of killing a good friend while driving drunk) but this story makes him quite human and helpless. If you are a parent it will tear your heart out. It is no wonder the continuing abuse problems he has had.<br /><br />And then there is poor Mick, a true victim, horribly bankrupt by the end and crippled by a debilitating spinal disease. The black sheep of the band but a very interesting character. He lived a quite different life than the others.<br /><br />And of course Nikki merely dies and returns to life. Having known people close to me who suffered from drug abuse every word rings true. The story of him winging a liquor bottle in a crowded Japanese train defines him. Just another ordinary story, LOL!<br /><br />Oddly Tommy to me was the least interesting story, pretty much behaving as any kid would who found massive success (and he still does). His stories of his relationships with Heather Locklear and Pamela Anderson are well enough known. Clearly he has issues like many of us had growing up. Massive ADD and general insecurities (he was truly missing a father figure).<br /><br />Oddly there was no deep description of how they developed their talents. Little discussion of how much time and practice it takes to be a successful musician. Mick touches on this somewhat regarding his guitar playing but the others barely touch the subject. But in the end that is not what this book is about. It is more about survival, and all of them should be fortunate to be alive. The personality clashes that run throughout the book come as no surprise either.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book. A terrific read for anyone who loves rock n'roll but much more than just a mere chronicle of a rock band.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is thoroughly enjoyable entertainment. Multiple story lines keep the viewers attention. This series is a very well-written and quality production.
B00C7KXUOE|5.0|The show is about four episodes in (might be one more than that). And although the events in the show take place before the book Red Dragon, it doesn't not take place in the past. In other words it is set in today's time, not thirty some odd years ago. That being said the show is top notch each week. Fantastic performances from all actors, Hannibal is charming, creeping, and compeling. Given it is an NBC show I was surprised by the amount of &#34;gore&#34;. It is definitely for us older folks.<br /><br />This show is great and I hope it keeps up the quality of story and characters and NBC doesn't cut it short because of ratings. Check it out, it is worth the try!!
B00C7LB20C|3.0|Even though it reminded me of a Bourne type movie, it still was good! I recommend watching this movie because the suspense was pretty good too.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Most moving movie we've seen in a long time. Long running movie.  Allow enough time to view. Thank goodness for tivo.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|This movie was like watching CNN of the 1860's.  Too many politics and not enough story line for me.  I couldn't even watch it to the end.  Too hard to follow.  Never liked Lincoln anyways but expected more of this movie
B0064MPXFA|3.0|Worth a try if you can stand the liberal BS espoused and the goodie two shoes bleeding heart mentality of the writers.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie with my fiance. Her and I both thought it was one of the best movies we have seen in a long time. Some of the racial slurs were hard to digest at first, but they added to the overall completeness of the story.
0307476073|4.0|Review by Donn G. Ziebell, Ph.D., Never kicked by a horse nor a mule, and author of the non-fiction Amazon book,\\" My Letters to a Prisoner -- I had not met.\\" Become an insider to the humor and private life of the writer's encounters and adventures home and abroad; a selection from over 100 letters written in six years. Each letter is a different and interesting story.<br /><br />This Amazon book Wild by Cheryl Strayed can be summed up as a success story against many odds for hiking the Pacific Crest Trail; those odds being, lack of research reading before backpacking, getting wrong size fitting boots, a near disastrous spending money plan (once down to 2¢), wrong fuel purchased for a trail stove, understanding that \\"water ahead\\" is not a guarantee, and that a lone woman in the wilderness can be at risk, but in this instance where a lone man could be at risk meeting up with this lone woman hiker. She came from a wild lifestyle.<br /><br />Any reader familiar with just a little bit of hiking experience would likely become worn out on the trail from a daily grind with this author, and likely would have quit after just a couple of days. While fighting many demons in her mind, heart and psyche, Cheryl displays strength, willpower, physical suffering and amazing determination. This book is written with a presence you are with her on this enormous challenge to reach the Oregon-Washington boarder after starting way down in southern California.<br /><br />Heat, sweat, cold, chills, sun, rain, snow, slipping, mud, scrapping skin at times, blisters, wild animals, snakes, frogs, climbing, descending, and vast areas of clear-cut forest hopefully would lead to finding a flat spot somewhere to pitch a small tent at the end of the day; then eat an uncooked meal or a cooked meal if any body strength remains. It is likely Cheryl carried, read and burned more books during her mountain trek than many Americans read in a lifetime of sitting on their butt. Her books were fine books seemingly fitted toward conquering a life quest to affirm her inner self. There are millions of people who would not dare approach their inner pursuit in the manner she chose and made it happen.ingly fitted toward conquering a life quest to affirm her inner self.

B00AKFG15S|2.0|POOR ENDING FOR SUCH AN EXCITING SAGA. WOULD'VE EXPECTED A BIT MORE TO THIS LAST PART OF THE CHRONICLES. A BIT DISAPPOINTED.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This is a really good game to pass the time. Even after you &#34;beat&#34; all the missions, it allows you to &#34;trade in&#34; your medal and start again with more missions and get more money and more mdeals.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The English still know how to make films better than their US counterparts. Beautifully filmed, acted and produced. A must see.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|lots of relaxing fun. my kids love it and so do I. it does not take long to earn money to buy horses or the stuffgor them
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|The melodies were gorgeous, the acting passionate, I love it! The sets and costume design were impeccable, although the plot left more to be desired.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Season 3 kept me riveted with many twists and turns leading up to an intense emotional climax for the season finale.  Looking forward to season 4.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Considering how long ago this film was made it still stands as on of the best.  A great cast, ground breaking effects now in 3D.<br />There have been several attempts to match this movie, over the years, but none have topped it.
B000HX499S|5.0|I love this classic film.  Hopefully the recipient will come over some day and watch it with me.  Love the party scene in her apartment, so nostalgic.
B000FA675C|3.0|the descriptive details are very well done and give the whole book an air of versimilitude.  i enjoyed the story though it made little sense to me.  for balance, bart ehrman's book on the errors in the da vinci code helps you both to recognize the creative skill of the writer and how he distorted the material to fit his plot.
B000I5SY5U|4.0|I remember seeing this movie when it first came out and remembered I liked Joel Grey and Liza.  I didn't remember how good it was, or how the plot was intertwined with Nazi Germany.  Not a good movie for young ones.  Very lewd humor.
