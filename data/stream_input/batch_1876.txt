B003TSEEDY|5.0|Very cute and inspiring<br />I loved it and can't wait to see the movie!! Must read this amazing book yay!!
B009JBZH54|4.0|The iPhone app doesn't support iPhone 5 kind of a drag. The movies are excellent and worth the purchase for any fan!
B00ADYYBFI|4.0|I am not a huge fan of contemporary country music (love &#34;classic&#34; country from 40's - 70's) but this TV show is a fun soap-opera drama and T-Bone's music selection/production is great. Admittedly the music is easier for me to digest in the context of the show, and listening to the whole CD is almost (but not quite) a little too much for me to handle often, but I think this is a good addition to my library. As noted by other posts here, the absolutely beautiful &#34;Fade Into You&#34; is missing, but I bought it separately. That song is a 5-star winner all the way.
0143120255|5.0|strongly recommended for anyone who at least once visited these cities ))<br />perfect images and very stylish<br />I'd say that this book is a must have
B0057R5XRG|4.0|Beware I just ordered this and the digital copy expiration date is 12/31/2012.  Only one week to download.  Not fair in my opinion.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Good second book with a great cliffhanger end.  I don't know how I am going to wait for the last book.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|This book was a little disappointing because compared to the other books it is recycled material and I thought it was a little easy to assume what was coming next.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This novel is engrossing and mesmerizing. I highly recommend this book to the discriminating reader. An excellent way to lose yourself and relax.
1594202842|1.0|This book is appalling. All this woman did was berate, harangue, insult, and demean her children. I think the author is very warped as she is immensely proud of her denigrating and disparaging parental skills.
B001706I5I|5.0|Love this movie!! One of ths best holiday kids movie! Him Carey plays the Grinch so well. Watched it my daughter a few times over & over.
084313352X|5.0|My son and I read these books all the time. They are super cute and fun to read. We were so happy to add to our collection.
B001NI24OI|5.0|My husband loves this film he can watch it over and over again! and alright i enjoyed this film as well.
0316216453|5.0|I had been previously familiar with Evelyn Waugh only from [[ASIN:B0054U5A1U Scoop]], an entertaining book but not a very deep one, and I expected this to be basically a comic novel. The first section, in which we are introduced to narrator Charles Ryder and his Oxford friends, boded ill. The characters were all spoiled, lazy, unsympathetic, and I didn't see the book going anywhere of interest. Charles soon fixes on friendship with the particularly wealthy, juvenile Sebastian Flyte, whose antipathy for his family seems at first hard to understand.<br /><br />The bulk of the book relates Charles's dealings with Sebastian's family, and the rapid changes in tone and direction of the story provide so much pleasure for the reader that it would be cruel for me to allude to any specific developments and thus spoil them for others. Suffice it to say that the book deals with at least three major themes -- love (and more specifically, how people fall out of love, or realize they were never really in love), family (and more specifically, how our well-meaning relations can damage or stunt us), and religion (both the specific role of Catholics in early-20th-century Britain and the general challenge that people of faith have in dealing with those who don't, plus the shadow that one's childhood faith casts over the lives of even those people who think they have totally abandoned religiosity). Secondary themes include the passing of aristocratic mores in the years after WWI, and a [[ASIN:0394701801 Buddenbrooks]]-like consideration of the fall of a wealthy family. At a couple of points in the story, I expected that last point might develop into the book's major theme, but it never does, and I am pleased by this, as it would have been relatively cliche, and the book as written never is.<br /><br />Waugh's language is sometimes challenging, using academic or architectural words I've never seen before and may never see again (what is the significance of one's \\"oak\\" at Oxford?). However, on balance he picks his words perfectly. I was particularly fond of \\"crapulous\\" and \\"bondieuserie\\", words that really should make a comeback.<br /><br />Not all the characters are entirely realistic; the main characters are given some caricatures to play off of, and some of these (Rox Mottram for example) become the source of the book's funniest passages.<br /><br />Some passages are phrased so perfectly, so clear in communicating complex ideas without ever leaving the narrator's voice. I am thinking in particular of his groping for an analogy to describe English social relationships in terms of the interaction of subatomic particles, and also the narrator's recurring dream of a looming avalanche (the significance of which I can not mention without spoiling a significant plot point).r, on balance he picks his words perfectly.

B00AA7O22U|5.0|Had the whole family over for Christmas and after dinner we watch The Expendables 2. Everyone enjoyed it, the evening was great!
B000JSI7BM|5.0|I love this story.  So do my girls and their friends.  I think this will be a classic down the road.
0525952926|5.0|Winter of the World, by Ken Follett.<br />If you are a fan of Ken Follett, and you like to read, this is your book. I have read all of Mr. Follett's books begining with Sleeping with the Lions. &#34;Winter of the World&#34; begins in 1933 where &#34;The Fall of the Giants&#34; ends. The brutality of not only the German brown shirts of Adolf Hitler, but the Russian brutality as well. The same cast of characters continue on in Buffolo, N.Y., in London, St. Petersburg, Moscow, Paris and in Berlin, Germany. The rich and the famous and the elete of the British families. How love can come between world powers at war, with a British wife and a German husbamd can survive. How Russian brothers are so similar but yet so differant. One a former bootleggers daughter in Buffolo who wants to be on the elite of ladies society but falls short. How two British brothers, unknown to each other, meet and one of them survives WWII. Mr. Follett's novel is fiction of course, but there are so many well known facts that he brings forth as only he can. There was only one or two errors I found in his novel, both minor but of note, one of these is these is USAF when in fact during WWII it was the USAAF. What is the difference? United State Army Air Force until 1946 when it bacame the United States Air Force. You will not only be on The European side of WWII but a bit in the South Pacific and the battle of Midway. Mr. Follett also writes of a love affair between two naval personel and the fears they suffered. You will read how it was to be on both sides dring WWII and a few years after it ended. This book has it all; murder, rape, sex, the horros of war, the pain and the good times. Review by DP......
B0031RAOW8|5.0|Get some tissues for this one as it will tug at you tears....  Great story of love and dedication.  Based on a true story.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Engrossing for kids for all ages.  I'm not sure if it's my laptop but it would be nicer to be able to turn up the volume more.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't even know where to start.  This books is beyond great.  It's brilliant.  Colleen Hoover is an awesome writer.  This story really pulls you in and holds you there until the end.  The characters Sky and Holder is awesome awesome awesome.  I think I'm in love with Holder, SERIOUSLY. This book brings out so many different emotions in you.  While reading this book, I either had a silly grin on my face or I was about to cry or I finally broke down and cried.  She is a great story teller and that's the best way to put it.  This is book was so carefully written and everything makes sense. Hands down, this is my favorite book. I love how she use certain words or phrases and give them a different meaning in the story.  In order to fully understand what she means, you have to read the book to fully comprehend.  It's her signature mark on the book.  Like in Point of Retreat, the phrase \\"Carving Pumpkins\\" and \\"I butterflying love it\\" and in Hopeless \\"I lived you\\".  You have to read the book to understand these things and this is what makes her a great writer.  Honestly, I can go on and on and on about how great of a writer she is but you won't really know until you pick up this book and read it.  She is officially my favorite author and I've read so many books but no one tells a story the way she does and for that I love her work.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this app all the time when I'm home and don't want to pull up my actual Bible.<br /><br /> What's awesome about it now are the new reading plans/devotionals. Is great for when you don't have a specific place to read.<br /><br />I recommend this app for everyone. It has all types of translation.<br /><br />I personally use NIRV and is my favorite. It's easier and better to understand.
B0086700CM|5.0|It takes a couple of minutes to get adjusted to the techniques but it's a lot of fun once you get the hang of it. It can be addicting!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I did not order or get this....don't know why it is here?  Maybe my husband did??  I will check with him....
B0053TMP24|5.0|Great book....worth your money<br />Not one p  this  short crappy books<br />Loved it... maybe even more  then the earlyer ones
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. Can't believe it kept me hooked. Could not put it down. Definitely recommended to anyone looking for something filled with excitement and adventure.
B004H0M8EA|5.0|This book was more scholarly and less economically focused than I expected.  I was fascinated by the five concepts he has identified as critical to success, and learned buckets about how seemingly unimportant things can be connected to collapse. Weaves the social values in decision making with environmental choices and shows how we can knowingly fail to choose survival- something I thought impossible. I found a few of the early chapters too remote for me, but the remainder of the book compelling and even frightening. A very interesting take on this topic.
B0083D9MXM|5.0|(Classical) Music lovers are living boon times, although some say that this reflects the swan song of the CD. Maybe, but let's revel in what we get and dance on the volcano before it erupts. Now much of the Stokowski material that had been available on out-of-print individual issues or boxes offered at cut-throat prices on the marketplace is available in cheap in attractive boxes, from Decca ([[ASIN:B0000B0A0P Leopold Stokowski: Decca Recordings, 1965-1972 (Original Masters Limited Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B00067R3BQ Original Masters: Leopold Stokowski: Decca Recordings 1964-1975]], but sadly the Internet vultures have now caught up on that volume 2), EMI ([[ASIN:B002QDMD68 Icon: Leopold Stokowski]], reissuing Stokowski's Capitol recordings from the late 1950s), BMG/Sony ([[ASIN:B006ZJJ70O Leopold Stokowski: The Stereo Collection 1954-1975]], reissuing Stokowski's RCA stereo recordings) and now this one with the maestro's more occasional Columbia stereo recordings.<br /><br />The contents have been given in the other reviews, and they have commented that the material is rather less interesting than on the other boxes, although they haven't insisted enought on the fact that much of it (Brahms, Bizet, Mendelssohn, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, the transcriptions on CD 6) derives from the very last recording sessions made by Stokowski, in 1976 and 1977 (the year of his death at 95), all the more remarkable as they display no traces of ageing but on the contrary an uplifting youthfulness and freshness, and so will always take a place dear to the heart of the Stokowskite. The input I'd like to give here is to provide the links to the previous CD reissues of that material. Nothing is new here, although it is great for those who would have missed the original CD reissues to have it all gathered in a cheap-selling set.<br /><br />Falla Amor Brujo with Sherley Verrett and the Philadelphia 25 February 1960, many reissues including [[ASIN:B000050HWQ De Falla: El Amor Brujo / 3 CorneredHat / Nights in the Gardens of Spain]] (the rest of the Falla program is the same orchestra conducted by Ormandy). The Wagner substantial Tristan-synthesis (26 minutes) was the original LP pairing, [[ASIN:B004YFWKNC Leopold Stokowski & Philadelphia Orchestra: De Falla- El Amor Brujo / Wagner - Tristan und Isolde]]. It was previously licensed and CD-reissued by EMI on their \\"Great Conductors of the Century\\" series, [[ASIN:B00006IGIP Leopold Stokowski (Great Conductors of the 20th Century)]].<br /><br />The Bachs of CD 2 (Philadelphia Orchestra 25 February 1960) were previously released by Sony on their \\"Masterworks Heritage\\" series with more Bach by Ormandy, [[ASIN:B0000029PB The Philadelphia Orchestra Plays Bach]]<br /><br />Beethoven's Emperor with Gould, American Symphony Orchestra, 1 & 4 April 1966, [[ASIN:B000VFGSFA Beethoven: Emperor Concerto]]. Yeah, eccentric. See my review.<br /><br />Ives, American Symphony Orchestra and Gregg Smith Singers, recorded between 1965 and 1967, [[ASIN:B00000DSEJ Ives: Symphony No. 4 / Robert Browning Overture / Songs]]<br /><br />Since I am limited by Amazon's rules to ten product links, please follow me to the comments section.
B003Y5H5B0|4.0|Very funny. They did everyhig right. They didn't drag out the back story. Jokes were quick and frequent. Not stupid funny like most comedies these days.
B008NR8YXC|5.0|There are so many great recordings of this ageless music that &#34;best&#34; cannot be sincerely applied, but this set tempts me to try. His clarity,total control of tempo, pleasing but surprising tempo selection,tone, and always making me want a little more of something while completely satisfying make this boxed set a bargain at any price. I am forced to add this to the top of my WTC favorites with G. Gould, R. Tureck('53), G. Leonhardt, T. Fellner and a few others. This is my favorite composition of all time and I am always delighted to welcome another great recording to my shelf. I would not want to be without it.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|The first time I played this game, I didn't get any house work done for a whole afternoon. lol If you want to pass some time this is the game .
B0084U0IEG|4.0|This was a beautifully written story with characters that seemed to act in a full human way that caused the plot to move in interesting ways.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Great game and fun to play. It is also very addictive lol. I would highly recommend this game yo anyone who likes to play matching games.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I'm not, generally speaking, a fan of the zombie genre. It's been so overdone the last decade that I'm pretty tired of it. A friend gave this a very strong recommendation, however, and said that it's &#34;different.&#34; The story told as first person from many different sources gives it a much more interesting spin than even typical non-zombie books do, since it's so uncommon to have multiple protagonists.<br /><br />I personally wish the story had gone a different direction at some points, and there were times that I had a little bit of trouble suspending disbelief (in particular about some water-related aspects of the story), but on the whole I found this to be a very enjoyable story. Some of the best parts about it are parts that are not exactly related to the zombies themselves. For example, the parts discussing the Russian military, North Korea, Iran and Pakistan, and the two stories about Japanese citizens were some of my favorite parts.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Do not start this game unless you have plenty of time to spare. It is challenging and fun. I am already plotting how to beat my time the next time I play this...maybe this afternoon.
B005PK553C|5.0|I really liked the tv show, but I joined late so I ordered the series and now every time i watch it I see new things!
B0032KLAKE|5.0|Amazing movie ,didn't suspect the ending,I  loved all the characters and actirs who played them!! I extremly recommend it !!!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|durable yet pretty would recommend to a friend who has a kindle fire. great gift for anyone. i love it
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Totally love this period in history, Love the characters and the realities of the class differentials.  Story did begin to get a lilttle like a soap opera but, well worth it!
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|I just received this hood in the mail today. I took it out of the box and thought &#34;wow - this thing is big!&#34;. But it turns out that it fits perfectly on my camera (D5100) and allows me to put on the lens cap without any headaches. Sure, the price is high for plastic. But OEM accessories seem to be always high. I guess I've become used to that fact. Plus I bet it costs an arm and a leg in a brick-and-mortar store.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|The movie adaptation of Yann Martel's [[ASIN:7544731707 Life of Pi]] is a sublime movie, and even my picky husband loved it. We watched it with our eight-year-old who also enjoyed the visual splendor of the movie. It is a great film because it combines the best of two worlds - excellent movie-making, thanks to Ang Lee's masterful direction, and a compelling storyline.<br /><br />The cast is another revelation. I was happy to see some of my favorite South Asian Indie actors such as Irrfan Khan and Tabu in this production. Irrfan Khan has been in other productions such as [[ASIN:B0011Y13YG The Namesake]] and [[ASIN:B001UEBHYS Slumdog Millionaire]].Khan plays the adult Pi who is visited by a novelist referred by Mama-ji, Pi's uncle. Mama-ji believes Pi's life story is worthy of being novelized and so begins the story, narrated by the adult Pi.<br /><br />The child Pi is played by Ayush Tandon whose full name, Piscine Molitor Patel, opens him to incessant teasing by his fellow classmates. Nevertheless, Pi's natural intelligence and curiosity thrives and he is particularly interested in the idea of God - who or what is God, and where can God be found? There are some interesting, even comical scenes of the young Pi shown practicing the various religions he learns about - Hinduism, Christianity, and Islam. Yet instead of scolding him, his wise father cautions Pi, and advises him to always approach things by way of reason.<br /><br />Suraj Sharma portrays the 16-year-old Pi who is shown to be still in search of answers pertaining to the fundamental questions in life. Pi's chance to \\"find God\\" comes when he is shipwrecked on a lifeboat together with an adult Bengal tiger. The question is: Is this reality or is it Pi's imagination working on overdrive?<br /><br />The movie unfolds with such grace and beauty that it literally took my breath away. Questions of faith and survival under the most trying circumstances are explored with such depth and Lee's assured direction brings out the best in his cast, especially the young Suraj Sharma who is simply amazing in this film. His performance is raw and visceral, and some of the most compelling scenes in the film are in his interactions with the adult Bengal tiger. Though the tiger is part of CGI, Richard Parker (the tiger's name) was very real to me, and the chemistry between Pi and Richard Parker was very credible.<br /><br />This is one of the most unique films I have watched in a long time and I love it for so many reasons - it brought the novel alive for me and exceeded my expectations, it showed me that good storytelling does not have to suffer in a film loaded with CGI, and that an unknown actor can still carry a movie!out the best in his cast, especially the young Suraj Sharma who is simply amazing in this film.

B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I am tired of apps always trying to hook up with your facebook.<br />I do not want to bother my friends with games. I shouldnt have to.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|in this game you have to create structures with the goo in order to get to places, its easy to play but at the same time challenging!<br /><br />at this moment is my favorite game!<br /><br />if you are not patient or maybe for some childrens is not the best game because sometimes you have to try and try and pursuit for new strategies
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love to play solitaire on my new kindle fire hd 7. It is a lot of fun, and a great purchase. I give it five stars.
B008OTTSX4|4.0|A lot of &#34;tribute&#34; CDs are coming out lately. Most of them are just a way to get some money out of famous old bands or artists. This is not the case of RE MACHINED, it is played by people worth rearing and buying.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was a great wrap up for the  Hunger Games trio. With almost poetic words, the book gave you a feeling of passion when it was written. Even though I had to read the ending twice after my comprehension was bigger, it was just a little set back that made me glad I read it twice. I highly recommend this book, it was written very well and it is a book series that for once I was a satisfied with the ending, not begging the author to write and even greater epilogue. It is one of my favorite book series. Amazing.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Finished it in ~3 hours total play.  Pretty simple, but good graphics and puzzles for a mobile app.  Good buy.
B005TZFZJC|5.0|Album is definitely what I thought it would be!!♡ I listen to it everyday. Even though it is rated, most of the songs are clean.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|It was a gift for my Great Grandchildren.  I have my own and they really like it.  They will enjoy having their own.
B008KYOCA2|3.0|I just wanted a stand alone calendar . was disappointed I had to set up a gmail account to have it work
B009D5VNLS|5.0|I bought this movie for my son's kindle. He loves this movie. It's super cute and has a great underlying message.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|I loved this book-so much so I am reading it again! Such an honest look at healthcare and how to improve it-and even the motivation to improve. Just as enticing as this author's other book &#34;Better: A Surgeon's Notes on Performance&#34; but with a different purpose. If you are in the healthcare field, you would likely enjoy this author's books.
B00062PN6I|5.0|This was a gift for my mom who plays an electric piano. She been using very old walkman style headphones that barely cover your ear so I got her these. They cover the whole ear and she freaked out and said it sounded like she had a new keyboard. She wasn't used to this much bass response. These are really not anywhere close to the best but for the price and the situation, they worked perfectly.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|This could have been a great movie and it was disappointing that it turned into a mediocre one. What a waste of Steep and Jones.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|As usual Ken takes us on a journey with exciting people-- places--- and situations !! Hurry up with Book #3 !!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|app works great on kindle fire hd. also worked well on my droid phone. best app I have ever used! very easy to set up.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I will admit that I was hesitant to purchase this book, because I feared that it would tell the story of a sexually and physically battered foster child.  It did not.  She was emotionally battered, but the story doesn't end there.  An original book, something out of the ordinary, and so well written.  Don't let this one wilt before you can smell it's wonderful scent.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Five Stars!<br /><br />This was another excellent book by Colleen Hoover! The book addressed some very sensitive topics. Through the wonderful, relatable characters we are able to really *see* and *feel* as they begin to heal, learn to trust again, have hope and of course...find love. <br /><br />This was a hard book to put down, and is one that has stayed with me since finishing it. I thought that perhaps giving myself a few days to gather my thoughts would help before sitting down to write a review, but I'm still unable to find the words to accurately express my thoughts. <br /><br />There's not much that I can say without giving away key events in the story. I can say that both main characters, Sky and Holder, are beautiful people and you will fall in love with both of them. You will want to hug and care for them, and will be so happy that they have one another. Colleen will make you feel every single moment of heartbreak, as well as joy, that each of them experiences. <br /><br />In the end, for me, I felt so much hope for both of them...it made me feel like these two characters will be okay as they move on to their next phase in life together.<br /><br />At the end of the book, Colleen also provides some hotlines for those who may be struggling with the main issues addressed in the book. I commend her for including that information for her readers. If any reader, or someone they know, are dealing with these issues I pray that this book was able to show them the light and give them HOPE.
B00932ANQM|3.0|It's a subpar date movie that's just ok. It's one of those movies you rent when there's absolutely nothing else to rent or when you get a free movie credit from Amazon like we did. =)
159562015X|5.0|We had to order this book for a workshop at work.  I am so glad I did.  This was very interesting.  I learned things about myself that explains why I do and care about the things I do.  It was a very good exercise to do with my co workers.  We can now as a group benefit by all our strengths.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|Having a good case makes a big difference when you're using a bluetooth ear piece. The box is a bit big but it hooks to your belt or pocket. It is big but so is the device it carries and since the device is great, it's worth it. in my opinion.
1419705849|5.0|Arrived in good shape and on time. That's all I have to say about this and the review requires more words
B00006F2WY|5.0|I got this set to fill in the blanks in the Deep Purple catalog. Still have the original vinyl but it's nice to hear it without the pops, crackles and hisses. Was well done then and has certainly stood the test of time. Jon Lord was working on an updated version with Joe Bonamassa and Steve Morse when he passed earlier this year. Hope it makes it to the light of day.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|A good free app - i would reccommend this app to anyone looking to get started with the angry birds games
B009E3EY38|5.0|Well produced and mastered. It was good to see the band again. I got the multi-disc package and enjoyed the DVD and CD's  I've seen Zep since '73 and it was interesting to see the varied play list. \\"For Your Life\\" was a special treat. Any Zeppelin fan will enjoy the package.. The pre show DVD was a bit of a waste other being able to say you've got it. Fun to watch the progression from \\"Song Remains The Same\\" to 2 disc \\"Led Zeppelin\\"(How The West Was Won) to \\"Celebration Day\\"
B005XQLBU4|4.0|fun game on a 10&quot; tablet.  also fun on a nexus 7. I could see how it would get boring after a few games.but fun for a few days and definitely fun for free.
B000026KGC|4.0|A very fun album from an earlier Deep Purple. It was a whole different flavor with Joe's vocals but still a lot of fun. It was like a launching ramp for the band and Ian's arrival during take-off was the final piece of the puzzle. Some excellent drum work from a younger Ian Paice. It makes a nice precursor to the double live with the Royal Philharmonic
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle's first CD, & truly wonderful !!  Simon Cowell certainly knows how to spot a star when he hears one !  She does a fabulous job, & deserves all the fame & fortune possible, with a voice like that !
B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is a fun special game. it teach you how toobuild and makebuilding or city.also your way.I bet you it going to look nice
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|The clock works exactly as described.  Now my Kindle Fire became a fixture in my living room as a digital alarm clock! My only comment is that the display could be brightened up a little more but I also understand the clock is mainly designed for use in a dark bedroom. Weather information is an added benefit.
B002RI9SC4|4.0|A million times better than the movie. Worth reading if you've read the previous books. If not then you'd better get reading cause you'll be way too confused.
0525952926|4.0|Pillars of the Earth is on the top 10 best books of my life, so I will read any Ken Follett. Winter on the World starts out a bit slow, but remember this is Follett, and it take a hundred or two pages to get the story going -- especially when you've got characters from over a dozen families. Follet does a good balance of historical facts and tales of characters who you care about ... his storytelling magic helps me reflect on how lucky we are to live in this time ... how so many before us suffered through horrible wars and the aftermaths, through rations and deprivation ... all the while we live in the greatness of today's America. Worth the time it will take you to wander through another 1000-page Follett.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Great game.  First download for my Kindle Fire and I am very pleased.  Excellent graphics, easy to understand, good overall experience.
B004P9FAK2|4.0|On the outside of the package it said that it included Limited Edition Character Cards: #11 Draco Malfoy & #12 Albus Dumbledore<br />I received two Draco Malfoy cards instead.<br />Everything else was there I am just missing my  #12 Albus Dumbledore card/
B0063IH60K|3.0|i like all the different settings and options. i also like the auto complete. it is overall entertaining and a good pass time
B0084IG8TM|5.0|She loved it! Nevermind that she had been to the theater 3 times to see it. Now it is hers!
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|And I can't finish it... I am going to see how I can get my money back but I never seem to have much luck with that...
B008ACC9CM|5.0|This cd is beautiful, voices clear and blended well together.I hope they make a Christmas CD for next year 2013!!
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|My husband loves the Plane war movies and he always wanted the Memphis Belle.  I went on to Amazon and was surprised to find it there.<br /><br />However, when we ordered it the package we thought got lost in the mail and I reported it and immediately Amazon sent out this movie and the other I had ordered.  On Christmas morning as we opened gifts my husband received 2 of each and we don't know how that happened.  So we need to pay for the Memphis Belle and Then Came Bronson..  Can you tell me how to do that without reordering.  We already have the product.  Thank you.  We thought it was lost in the mail somewhere.  Thank you
B008JGSM6G|5.0|At first thought it was going to be a washout. But the longer I played the more challenging it became.
B008E374PO|5.0|I love this CD! All of the songs are catchy and have a meaning behind them. I like the songs Dreams and Disasters, I'm Coming after you, and Shooting Star.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, it's political reality is terrifying. The hunger games are reminiscent of the ancient Roman collseum.
B002RV01QI|5.0|Enya's style  seperates her from most other pop artists in general. I am a new Enya fan, and I love her songs because they're calm and can take you to another realm. It's cool how she uses her own instruments for these songs. Her songs sound like they came off of a movie soundtrack, the titles I like are;<br /><br />Only Time<br />Orinoco Flow<br />May it be<br />Amarantine
B008YU0AOE|4.0|This calculator works well on my kindle fire HD.<br /><br />Note: Hold your handheld device in landscape mode to access the scientific calculator.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|After seeing how bad Kristen's acting was in the Twilight Saga movies, I was hesitant to watch this one. I wasn't sure if her acting would be that good in this. Surprisingly, I enjoyed her acting in this. This is a more darker, more action packed update of the classic fairy tale. I really liked the cast and the fantasy sequences throughout. It's not a memorable movie by any means, but the plot and suspense stacks up well. Four stars ****
B0094BB4TW|1.0|news feed is unreliable and loads are often a little screwy. definatly would rather use a sideloaded android version, but for now i just use myphone
B003SI9WYG|5.0|This is my second favorite movie just after The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. This is dark for a Disney film, but at the same time whimsical, fun, and having meaning to it. I like the unique and witty characters and the claymation. Tim Burton did a great job with this. The songs I like are  &#34;Town Meeting&#34; and &#34;Making Christmas&#34;.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I love this game!!!  This game is fun and challenging. I have not been able to put it down glad I downloaded it for free.
B005OCFGTO|3.0|I purchased this for for my daughter to be opened Christmas day. When she opened the packaged the inside holding clips were broken.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I just started playing this game but it's pretty great already. The visuals are really nice, the sound effects are cute, and the higher levels are already starting to get challenging.
B000WEMH3C|5.0|Just needed a basic cover. Didn't want anything fancy. Got this for a very low price. Arrived quickly and is very good quality
B008LV8TSU|5.0|Actual rating - 4.5<br />This is a super fun read. The characters are super quickly and interesting, and the arguments between Sophie and Howl are really entertaining. My only complaint is that the various worlds are pretty confusing, but I managed to figure out what was going on in the story despite that. It may have just been my own fault... :P All in all, a very enjoyable read!
1936891026|5.0|This is one of those rare books that you can just open up randomly to any page and find great wisdom.  It's a quick read that you can read in a day or two but the insights I think are excellent.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This one is my favorite Angry Birds so far. Like that they float around and you get a second chance.  Love how it shows where the birds are going so you can have a better chance
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Not funny. Sad really. A huge waste of time and $4 dollars. Not a lot more to say. Wish someone had warned me.
B0090NNQX6|5.0|one of the most original artist out there now.  This is one of my favorite cds of the year....Mika is simply brilliant.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I have been a fan of this show from the beginning. This show keeps getting better and better. I hope it will be on TV for many more years.
B000W8HC8I|5.0|Good read, entertaining start to finish. Jordan is a great storyteller.  I would have like to hear \\"the rest of the story\\" and how his legal troubles were resolved.
B007XGJK4G|5.0|This film captures the man behind the music, it gives real insight into his person, who he was aside from the fame. the many facets of his life including his relationships, a must see!
0525478817|2.0|I was very excited to read this book, because it had been so well reviewed. I was very disappointed. I could not emotionally connect with the characters, because they were so unrealistic. Maybe it is because I have dealt with cancer and death in my own family many times that I just don't feel any depth here. Green writes about her breathing tubes and his feeding tubes and how pathetic and sad their situation is, but without actually developing any real chemistry between the leads. It feels like all of the pervasive cancer talk is an attempt at pulling your heart strings, but I feel like I might have been more emotional if more time was spent on their actual relationship as opposed to their diseases. Weak.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|My family and I have been enjoying this game.  Some levels are easy, and some are more challenging.  It's not always immediately obvious what you need to accomplish, but look around and experiment.  You'll figure it out.
B004HW7JH4|3.0|Not up to the earlier seasons. Not up to the earlier seasons. Not up to the earlier seasons. not up
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I only get the first 10 or so posts, then the rest is blue and you cant click on anything...terrible! fix it asap!!
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|THIS BOOK IS NOT NEARLY AS FUNNY OR EXCITING AS THE FIRST SIX. KINNEY IS RUNNING OUT OF IDEAS, and his whole book bases on one event.
B0036EH3X4|5.0|A very sad and philosophical ending to the series.  It was great writing and amazing footage (Note to self: must go back to Hawaii). The show was absolutely better in Blu-Ray.  My first full series in such format.  Don't regret it a bit.  The delivery was fast and the quality (even though it was used) was great.
B008IEFP1E|5.0|I think this is the best album of them all. I listen to it everyday. Hopefully they'll create more awesome albums like this!! <3
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This last book is taking me longer to get through than the last two.  Great series but slower read -
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game has fun and addicting gameplay. For anyone who likes dubstup, defiantly get the DJ Barry thing, which makes the already awesome theme song more awesome. Considering the fact it' s free (at least at the time I got it), it' s a must have!!!
B008R7MT4I|5.0|Read from start to finish without really wanting to stop anywhere. Reminiscent of some Heinlein and of the Forever War though with novel ideas.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book leaves vivid image of how life can be for someone escaping domestic violence. A must read for women who have experienced violence in their home.
B004KA9UXO|5.0|It was a great story when I read it 30+ years ago. With a new kindle I wanted to read again on a new device. Still a great! My only complaint is that it was too short.
B009EHDU7U|3.0|It was a cleverly written journey through major international happenings in the 20th century with a cast of delightful characters that wove and interwove into history around the world.  It is worth reading for the author's ability to knit together a story around such a premise and have the travelling through it absolutely delightful
B0060D16VI|5.0|Ratatouille, directed by Brad Bird, is a delightful and hilarious culinary comedy suitable for a great family movie night. Three years ago, I was about ten when I saw this movie for the first time, and I knew instantly that it would soon become one of my favorite comedies. I love the top-notch animation and the humour, which is funny but not corny (a must ). Perfect for any age or preference!
B005S9EJ14|4.0|I enjoyed the CD very much. It was interesting and entertaining.<br />Judi Dench was excellent in her rolel. The other actors were good do.<br />The scenery of india was interesting.<br />Would recommend to my friends.l
B000VZYXPC|5.0|&#34;Hot Fuss&#34; maybe the best introductory album, but &#34;Sam's Town&#34; is the best Killers album experience.  It starts out with that Killers driving sound and takes you on a journey.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|This game is like the one I use to play on pogo. It fun to play with your children. It also teaches them to use their minds like the game Memory.
B005H29GSI|1.0|This game is pretty close to unplayable. Trying to use the catapult to shoot birds at the structures is impossible. The only possible use I see for this game is if Santa runs out of coal and needs a replacement gift for all the bad kids.
B005DI9HPI|5.0|I picked up this book over the holidays as part of my new years resolution to read more. I thought starting with a chick lit book about the city I live in would be a good start - and boy was I right. I could relate to Angela, and I enjoyed hearing about all of the places she visited. I moved to NYC 8 months ago. Although I'm still loving living in NYC, I sometimes forget about why I moved there and how special it is. This was the perfect book to begin reaching my goal of reading more books because I finished it in three days. I can't wait to read more of Lindsey's books and get a hot chocolate at Max Brenner when I return to NYC after the new year.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|At $400, it's pretty pricey. It took a good half a day to finish the whole thing. But man does it look awesome when you mount place it somewhere to everyone to see.
B0079R8IYW|4.0|This is a good product, but could use a few changes and if I were to look for a different cover, these changes I would keep in mind.  When standing the case up as it is shown in the picture, the base is not as wide and does not allow for that angle of view.  The view that I got was more upright than I would have preferred, but so far all I have used my Kindle Fire for is reading, playing some games on, and surfing the web a little.  There also needs to be a slot to clip a stylus to, but I have to clip mine on the side part of the case (the hard edge, not the soft part, I was worried that would wear out over time).  Those are probably the only two things that I would change about this product.
B000MRAAJM|3.0|This is a great series. It is five star content and quality. Top narration and the best photography, directing and editing. A lone star rating is solely for unusual late delivery from Amazon, who usually exceed delivery expectation,  but this understandable at festive season. Contacted amazon and promptly got reply with delivery cost refunded. As a product review, Planet earth blu ray - 5 star. Amazon customer service - 4 star. Delivery for this purchase - 1 star.
0765367351|5.0|If you are a fan of the video game Bioshock, this book will clarify some of the background of the characters involved. Although well written, this book IMHO will only appeal to the before mentioned fans of the greatest video game to date.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Does what it says, no glitches.  So far seems to play well with other apps Just enter your zip code and it taylors itself for your area.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This was a very interesting book. It was depressing when I first started to read it but it turn out to be a very good book.
B005HSL626|3.0|My dad downloaded this onto my &quot;device&quot; for me; I really like it. I have wanted it for a while and now I have it! I play it all the time and really enjoy it, dudes, anyone who has not heard of fruit ninja, just get this free version 'cause it's awesome! :)<br /> (\_(\<br />(='.'=)<br /><br />(,(&quot;)(&quot;)
0399226907|5.0|Who wouldn't love a book you can read, teeth on and wiggly your fingers through? Perhaps when she is older she will enjoy the story of the caterpillar.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|only you can see the first histories with pictures and everything and then just a few readlines ....Too poor!!!<br />Is better in tve website .
067144901X|5.0|What baby wouldn't like this book? It's good for reading and teething! Boynton knows how to create interest and fun in her stories.
B008VBYN80|5.0|!?.  I really do love the game have sent trouble ticketsvkeep you posts hmmm... from ColoradoI love this game it is very fast paced but seems to freeeze after a certain level?????.  Not onlyy did it freeze but quit responding after Lvov 35 ????hmmm....
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|A Truly remarkable book and well written. One of my favorites, I will pass it on to all my friends
B0013O123Q|1.0|This was one of the most violent movies I have seen. Very little reason to watch. Only the novel way of presenting the facts is new.
B002N5N5LG|2.0|. . . so I it's hard for me to understand the angst and humor of 20 somethings.  Perhaps that's why I found this show's freshman year so disappointing.  That said, the next two seasons of \\"Community\\" have been very entertaining.<br /><br />But back to Season 1:  I discovered \\"Community\\" with Season 3's Christmas special, which was clever, entertaining, and beautifully performed.  The rest of that year remained high quality.  Of course, I bought Seasons 1 and 2 the moment they came down in price.  Sadly, I found the first half of Season 1 to be mean spirited and a punishment to watch.  The second half of the season showed a mellowing, but was pretty lackluster.  The exception was \\"Modern Warfare,\\" a brilliant paintball-parody on war films.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Best gift ever. Must have for the super hero fan. Arguably one of the best trilogies ever made. Exceeds expectations
B001CZJKS0|5.0|Great box set! Dvd's come in their own box so you can have the mask on display and still access the DVDs
B00991TCOG|1.0|This was supposed to be a gift for my sister for Christmas. When i received the CD, the entire case was broken like shattered glass. Very disappointing.
0345803485|1.0|Ordered this book for a friend who requested it. If I had known what the book was I never would have ordered it
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was hilarious funny kinda creepy because of ruby bird. Why did Rowley get a girl? really come on.
B00A3AYI50|5.0|I am a huge Dave Matthews Band fan, and I have to say I like Phillip Phillips' album MORE than I like Dave's new album. I played this for my sister on the way to a DMB concert, and she thought we were listening to Dave. The similarities in their voices are almost uncanny on some songs. That said, I don't want people to get the wrong impression and think I am calling PP a DMB copycat. I think he is incredibly talented and I'm sure I will be buying his music for many years to come. I'm just happy because now I have twice the new music to look forward to with both Dave and Philip releasing albums. Many have probably heard the first single from this album, &#34;Home.&#34; I love that song, but there are songs on the album I love even more. Get Up Get Down is most likely my favorite, and the one where PP reminds me most of Dave. I think this is a very strong album and one I can see myself listening to in my car for a long time.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It was just so good. Words won't do it justice. Starting speaker for the dead immediately. Definitely should read this.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Does every villan need a motive? The Dark Knight is a 2008 film directed, produced, and co-written by Christopher Nolan.  It continues the ultra gritty Batman reboot and is the 2nd entry in a trilogy. It is a powerhouse and arguably the best installment in the series.  The first film was titled Batman Begins and chronicled the origins of the caped crusader and his various adventures sweeping the crime ridden streets of Gotham City.  The Dark Knight quickens the pace and takes the story even further in depth.  Christopher Nolen did an excellent job creating a Batman presentation that seems very realistic.  THe story appears to follow the Batman comic legend very well.  There are many excellent actors that returned for this film and there was also a few characters introduced.  The true twist introduced in The Dark Knight is the Joker played by Heath Ledger.  The introduction of this character set the stage for a simple premise: The Joker is trying to destroy Gotham and Batman is trying to protect it.  This very simple and straight to the point plot is driven to classic film heights with the likes of Christian Bale & Health Ledger battling it out for true comic book character actor supremacy.  The Joker brought a unique brand of pure danger & energy to the big screen that is rarely seen. This character essentially became a cult film figure overnight. The Dark Knight is really a true blockbuster film. It is entertaining, unsettling, and intriguing all at once.  Health Ledger will always be remembered for stepping into this world and playing the classic Joker role with the conviction & dedication.  This film was a high order success and a worthwhile venture into the heart of Gotham City.<br /><br />You... you just couldn't let me go could you? This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object. You are truly incorruptable aren't you. You won't kill me because of some misplaced sense of self-rightousness. And I won't kill you because...you're just too much fun. I get the feeling that you and I are destined to do this forever. - The Joker.o much fun. I get the feeling that you and I are destined to do this forever. - The Joker.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have really enjoyed playing most of the games that I have unlocked so far. A few have seemed a bit difficult but the more challenging ones are more fun anyway. This is a great free app and tons of fun.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Got to read all 3 books to fully understand the story. I loved the complexity and uniqueness of all the characters. Throw in a different culture with a great storyline, and I couldn't put them down.  Read all 3 books in about a week.
B005LAIH9A|4.0|Love this movie and it was cheaper than stores! It also arrived quickly and on time! No trouble at all!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I chose a 5 star rating because I received the DVD in excellent packaging & seeled, it was also delivered on time. The DVD was not scratched & the clarity & sound was excellent. I really like S.O.A and have been purchasing all the seasons from Amazon & have enjoyed all of them. I recommend S.O.A for 18yrs. & older. viewers.
B008I3QZKU|1.0|I actually listened to Battle Born twice just to be fair.  The first time was awful, the second time was even more awful than the first.  The reviewer that mentioned that this was more of a Brendan Flowers solo effort was totally correct, except that Flamingo, the actual Brendan Flowers solo album was partially listenable  Battle Born had no redeeming qualities whatsoever and Brendan's vocal range was right up there with fingernails on a chalkboard.  From a Killers fan,  I do not recommend this cd at all.
B00ADYY7MA|4.0|love it! wish it included more of the show's songs, but this is a great compilation. can't beat the price either.
B008LD09LS|2.0|We bought this for our son, who loves flying the smaller model helicopters. Within a day, he accidentally bumped the outer styro foam ring and it cracked. One would hope that the outer ring was made more durable considering the cost of the product.<br />On a positive side, he likes the controls and the camera is extremely clear. As other reviewers mentioned, the battery life is rather short.
B006O6F932|3.0|While my granddaughter really loved it when she opened her present, I personally feel that this item was way too pricey for what you get.  The real price should be $25.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One word-amazing. It was an emotional look into the life of a damaged young boy. Absolutely incredible. A must read.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I bought it, bought it now for 4 other's and everyone is as I was, sitting for hours and couldn't let go or stop. I will buy again as gift
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I knew this was a popular book, but I wasn't sure if I would like it. This is possibly one of the best books I've ever read.
B00080ZG1A|4.0|I hadn't watched it and then caught part by accident, finding myself continuing, so bought. Shame it didn't do well at box office and casting was darned good. I do like it and was sure I would not-wrong!
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Good, serves it's purpose 😀 😀 😀 😀 😀 😀 😀 😀 😀 😀 😀 😀 does the job 🎄
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Awards in other Countries yet nothing in U.S. Perhaps hits too close to what is happening now. I bought it, bought it for 6 other's and one, only one, told me-I don't want to know of bad things possible. OK, will buy for those who wish to look ahead.
B000QFW7UA|5.0|What a great movie! I've watched several AAA movies like mission impossible, transformers, spiderman, and etc... They are really good but it didn't had as heart as this one.  It's definitely a feel good movie and will show this to my kids one day.  This is a great gem.
B004LM72ZY|3.0|Kind of a pointless toy. Maybe my 2 year old will like it better when he is older and can have more playmobil stuff to go with it.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|It has settings for a beginner and you can work your way up to the harder settings.  It is such a nice game. I think I can learn how to play some of these songs on my own, after a little practice.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|A wonderful book to accompany the first book by George RR Martin in the Song of Ice and Fire series.  It continues the journey, but it does start off a bit slow.  The story is worth the time invested in reading it.
B004APVI1G|5.0|A quick arrival, high quality buy, fantastic buy, would recommend to anyone. I will do buisness with these guys again.
B0000041LO|5.0|Masterfully played and a delight for Christmas Day or anytime when intelligent, classical music is desired.  The #34 is especially poignant

B000QI2ZWW|5.0|My granddaughter watched it 3 times the first day and squealed with delight.  It is a delightful DVD for children  and adults.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|A quick arrival, high quality buy, fantastic buy, would recommend to anyone. I will do buisness with these guys again.

B000JML7EC|5.0|A quick arrival, high quality buy, fantastic buy, would recommend to anyone. I will do buisness with these guys again.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I loved the music version of the movie...even though I have not seen it yet. I have seen the production on broadway atleast seven times. If you are a fan of<br />Les Mis I recommend this download :)

B0064X7FVE|4.0|LIKE VERY MUCH ABLE TO GO TO DIFFERENT STATES TO CHECK WEATHER. GIVES A LOT OF INFORMATION. IT HOLDS CURRENT
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|This show rocks it all the way around. Actors, directing, storyline, accurate and believable scenarios, honorable moral codes. MOST EXCELLENT. Must...watch...more..... aaaarrrrggghhhh!!!!... ha ;) Great show.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|I LIKE IT BECAUSE I CAN USE AT WORK IN MY FREE TIME.  IT WILL PICK UP MY FAVORITE STATION.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|I have rated this book 5 star, as this was my daughters rating when I asked her how she enjoyed the book. She has read a majority of Rick Riordon's books.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Like playing Solitaire. IT HELPS PASS THE TIME WHEN NOTHING ON TV. I EVEN PLAY WHILE WATCHING TV.VERY GOOD PASS TIME
B0042MEQVG|5.0|Really more of a 4.5.  really liked it but the least favorite of all the movies -- and books.<br />But you need to see Eclipse to really appreciate the rest of the movies.  Read the books first!
B002FRNCG0|5.0|Package came much sooner than expected. Will definitely be buying again. Great packaging as well, shipped with other items. :)
B002BWP49C|5.0|Some say they didn't like the ending--but reading the books first helped you appreciate everything that was happening.<br />Couldn't wait for Breaking Dawn part 2 to come to the theaters and can't wait for it to go on sale.  If you are considering watching the Twilight movies, GREAT!  But if you really want to enjoy them to the fullest you need to read the books--also availabel from Amazon.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|This game is quick and easy to play. Very fast moving. My 9 year old daughter loves it. It would be very easy to play the whole game in one sitting. It's kind of addicting.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|This film attempts to address big questions of origin and creation, there are moments when it approaches meaning but ultimately this film takes you on a ride only to leave you at a dead end street.<br /><br />It is a nihilistic film.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Avengers is a great action movie.  Never a slow moment.  Iron man is my favorite.  Captain America is good too.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|It was a great gift for someone who is a Rod Stewart fan. Enjoyed for many hours this Christmas season
B0094BB4TW|4.0|A little bit more difficult to use than on the desktop, but overall is a similar experience. Makes social media easier for sure
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I played the game on Pc and loved it so much I signed up but now there's the app for it!!! totally get this app its worth the money .!!!!!!!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|For all those people who want to bring back some classic memories of being a child...read this to feel humble and content.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It was amazing and I would recommend this to anyone. It really was the kind of book that you can't stop reading
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|the game has great graphics and the best experience. It felt like I really ran a zoo. It's perfect!!!!!!! I would play this all day if I could!!!!!
0399160450|5.0|I am a Tom Clancy fan & avid reader.  I like the continuation of the Jack Ryan story line.  I think any Clancy fan would enjoy this book.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Maybe we haven't been molested like several people in this book, but the author really captures the emotions I think everyone has felt at one point or another throughout high school. Truly a great read
1401322786|5.0|I think this book is a MUST read for everyone.  It helps people realize what is important in our lives and that time is always running.  And no one knows when their time in this life will expire so we must all stop and enjoy life for what it is and what we have.  Time waits for no one.

B00479SVBU|5.0|We loaded up the sd card with 4 gig of old radio shows on our cross country trips.<br />Putting it in random lets it jump around so you get different orders.<br />We chose an fm channel that wasn't used where we were.
0349106533|5.0|I actually bought this book for my Kenyan guide who chose the English name of Nelson because he admired Nelson Mandela.  He is enjoying it little by little.

B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Since most of the viewers will be middle to older it is a funny comedy for us. Love Tommy Lee and he plays it to the hilt.

B00AA7O22U|4.0|I had to watch this twice to get all the one liners they threw at each other. They took jabs at each others movies and it was comical in that sense alone.
B000SEGHT6|4.0|Not my normal read but kept me excited and sad and happy and on edge and relaxed.<br /><br />The perfect mix of emotion for any good read.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I absolutely love it. I spend HOURS Playing it. I wish that there was an option where you could see things from 1st person though! I love it! It's got great music and tons of stuff that you can do!
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|The game is epic, but took me about 10 or 15 minutes to download. Other than that, the game is worth the wait and is worth the 2.99. If you have the money, you should get it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Sky finds herself falling in love for the first time but secrets from her past shake her faith and trust. I loved this story and fell in love with the main characters. You will too.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|I really did not want purple--then I looked carefully at pics.Let me start by saying it is a nice purple deep rich looking-now to the quality--this is a very nice cover--fits well-easy to remove and put your kindle back.I also much prefer the band around security to the magnetized type--OK- costs a few bucks more but well-worth it
B0091V6TF4|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my husband and he loves it!  The first CD is theme music from many of the old James Bond movies.  The 2nd CD is primarily other songs from the movies.  Only wish is that some of the theme songs from more recent James Bond movies were on the CD's.
B0086700CM|5.0|My husband and 7 yr. old great grandson love this game. It is fast action game that requires quick thinking.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|Great series with an original concept, interesting characters and well written. Would recommend it as a good series to read
B00A757EFW|5.0|oh i love this. it takes me back 35 years ago to my high school days when I played this game daily.  my family enjoys it. i enjoy it. yes, this is a family-friendly game. It is good for long rides in the car or weekend play.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|Great series with an original concept, interesting characters and well written. Would recommend it as a good series to read
0446614459|1.0|If an author has to reach this far to try to keep his publisher happy then he should just go fishing. Unbelievable is the word that best describes this waste if paper. Reading this review gives the book too much attention.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|Great series with an original concept, interesting characters and well written. Would recommend it as a good series to read
B001FB563E|3.0|The Road follows a father and his son as they travel across a post-apocalyptic United States. The Road is a very dark and atmospheric post-apocalyptic drama.<br /><br />The Road has a very basic story, even the characters are nameless; however, it has a deeper meaning/message, so you have to look harder to find it. The story has father and son attempting to survive and learning from each other. It mostly uneventful, except for some scenes. There is one particular scene that really got me: the father has a gun to his son's head about to pull the trigger to save him from the terror of being captured, raped, and/or possibly eaten- all while his son pleads and cries \\"will I see you again?\\" Aside from a few very powerful scenes, the rest of the film moves at a dreadfully slow pace with very few significant events to justify the 1hr 50 min runtime. The acting was great, and the cinematography was amazing. It is a very dark (tone-wise) and atmospheric film, although it is a bit too dark at times where you can barely see what's going on.<br /><br />Overall, The Road is a decent post-apocalyptic drama with some very powerful scenes, only brought down by the very slow pace and unjustified runtime (lack of events). I recommend a rental, or a purchase if you're a big fan of post-apocalyptic films.<br /><br />The Road has strong violence and blood, and nudity.
B007NG93CK|3.0|A Good read, probably not one of her best but still if you enjoy Temp Brennen it worth a read
0553807919|5.0|Dealing with young minds of the growing children, particularly under the age of 5 is very interesting and can be very challenging.  Dr Daniel Siegel provides an amazing insight into this topic. How to integrate our right and left brains, designed to function independently focusing on different strengths, is made easier her in this book with his 12 strategies. I have recommended this book to anyone and every one who is dealing with young minds and are struggling to be effective.
B005LAIHGI|5.0|Cohen has a way of making you laugh and think of the absurdity of this man's life as well.Saw it in the theatre and decided I had to have a copy of it.Almost as good as Bruno and Borat.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn is a very consistant author.  His books hold your interest throughout.  I love the characters.  I hope he keeps writing.
B004LX0D36|5.0|I love reading on my kindle and although I owned Sense and Sensibility in book format, I am gradually replacing my books with kindle ebooks to reduce the amount of space books take up in my home!
B008L1DNGI|4.0|The game is pretty fun, but it looks like very little time was put into making it a hit.<br />It certainly is a fun game, but doesn't reach the potential that it could, coming from Sega. There is a &quot;multiplayer&quot; present, however they skipped out on putting people in, either via Internet, local wifi, or some clever control scheme for tablets that are USB -enabled.<br />The graphics could have used some TLC, but they aren't as horrible as some that I've seen.<br />On a positive note, there are a great many puzzles to conquer.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|You can get a lot of the individual Dickens novels for free on Kindle, but if you want to have some of the lesser known books, this is an affordable option.  I am happy with the purchase.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|Very good physics engine, makes it interesting. Gets too hard after the second level, I'm getting stuck at that point.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I think it is more good than original swivel sweeper.<br />It has a light in front of the product.<br />Thanks.
B004LWZWGA|3.0|Bane was just not as great of a felon as the prior characters. When you have to wear a mask that blocks your facial expression it is just really hard to express yourself and connect with the audience. It picked up nicely on where Bruce Wayne left off in the the Dark Knight. Of this trilogy, it was the worst.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|When you have free time this will angry birds seasons free is a good way to unwind and empty your mind.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I found the authors writing style to be fantastic and what a great story teller.  I can't wait to check out her other books.  I liked how she worked past and present in to the story telling.  It was great!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|The app will only allow you to see a handful of posts at one time!  Please fix this soon! Thanks
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved this book as much as I loved the first one and I can't wait for the next one
B004LWZWGK|4.0|I've seen this movie a few times and I would agree that it's good in parts of it I still don't get the transition from the Dark Knight to The Dark Knight Rises but the end gave the idea away that the next one will have Robin in it (aka Batman and Robin, although it won't be directed by Christopher Nolan) and the portrayals as to the Joker with Heath Ledger as the Joker to Bane (I didn't read the comic books that much when I was a kid) this movie transition didn't really do that much for me because I understand that Heath Ledger was due to be signed on the Joker a second time around before his untimely and tragic death (but in my opinion it was the role that he played and what an excelllent portrayal that is was/is as the Joker that probably did him in) because he had to do some things that he didn't want to do in order to get the role down pat but as I said that's just my opinion and I have ideas that it also could have been his role as the gay cowboy in Brokeback Mountain that contributed to his demise. I had that these two roles caused him an undue amount of stress.<br /><br />Could I be wrong about some of these things?<br />If so someone let me know.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|What an easy way to keep up with the holiday deals than a mobile app! It is intuitive and easy to use. Again, Valve releases another top shelf product.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I know lots of people who have the Kindle & love Facebook on it. I guess I have to get use to it. I just got the Kindle, so there is lots of things I still have to get use to.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Couldn't put this one down.  I can't wait to see how they turn this into a feature film.  Five stars.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I have already expierienced playing this game on the iPad, so it is still awesome to play on the Kindle.
B008EGQA2O|5.0|Classic Dylan, intro to the band. What more could us old farts desire?Classic songs . classic presentation. Enough said baby
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Very fun! Its much better than I expected and I was happy to find the same voice actors from the show. The setup is easy to use and the games are entertaining. The graphics are very similar to the show. A must for any MLP fan.
B007N8RULO|4.0|So far its been a great app...I like how you can even adjust the colors.  Ads are getting longer after each game.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|The game is well balanced and moves at slow pace. So basically if you want something that will keep you busy for hours this is it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|this book gives many different perspectives, it takes readers into the lives of August and his friends and family. It also shows readers that just because people may look different, they're still people and they deserve a chance. Stand up for whats right, even if you're standing alone.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|SO much better than \\"Bared\\"...this one actually has a story with a few surprises to keep you from putting the book down.  A fantastic read!
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Clockwork Angels is a creative masterpiece and the ultimate listening experience.. Rush is the best progressive rock band on the planet!

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|For me it took a while to download and install but it was so worth it there's so much more you can do now I love it!!! :)
B0098QBEXO|5.0|you will cry.  then you will cry then you will cry.  there is no white light at the end of the tunnel with this film which makes it very real.  it deals with cancer in a very real way, the acting is amazing.  a must see for fans of Benedict Cumberbatch
B0017SWPXY|5.0|If you haven't read this because you heard it was about race car driving, read on...... the story is from the voice of man's best friend.  It was sad and happy and heartwarming and inspiring.  It is a story of friendship and loyalty.  Good grief, I sound like a hallmark card.  Suffice it to say, I am very glad that I read this book.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|I love this show and watch it every monday and the DVD series is GREAT. I have watched it many times over.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This story is absolutely breathtaking and gorgeous. I was always entertained by the story and the language that was used. Yann Martel really outdid himself with this amazing novel.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book is full of suspense. It kept me on the edge of my seat and kept me wanting more. I would recommend this book to anyone who's into good books and wants to see what happens to katnis and peeta.
B001HN6EF4|4.0|My daughter wanted cards that could be played out by the pool so we gave these a try.  Very fun design.  Only complaint is that the clip could be bigger to accomodate all the cards.  They are a bit difficult to put on all at once.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The book is lovely. It's odd format and unique writing style made this book a true work of art. I simply loved  it to pieces.

B008L1DNGI|2.0|No invasive permissions (yet), but you cannot move the app to the SD card. System memory is a premium not to be spent on games. Otherwise it's a bit too easy.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Ireally enjoyed this game.  It helps to pass the time and its addicting.  If you run out of coins you can always sell your prizzes for more.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very interesting and thought provoking book.  As love is the key essential theme of Dr Alexander's book it is up to us to keep love/God as our main focus in this sometimes troubling world.
1932735410|5.0|So I have been reading lots of reviews with hidden complaints. Frankly this was an amazing book. I passed on my first try with minimal studying and did not even touch the PMBOK guide. Please note the following.<br /><br />1) I took two weeks to go thru all the chapters and take the end of chapter exams. Scored 70-75 percent. (No cheating). The chapter that gave me the most trouble was communication. Scored 55 percent on that one.<br />2) I took my time to see why I got questions wrong and retread on detail those concepts again.<br />3) I stopped studying for 3 weeks. Scheduled my exam for dec 26.<br />4) 2 weeks before exam, I went thru all the chapters again. Did 80 percent average except communications (50 percent this time). Again studied in detail the problem areas.<br />5) took a full exam simulation using the software and scored 73.5 percent two days before the exam. Studied in detail my mistakes and problem areas.<br />6) scored 1 proficient and 4 moderately proficient on actual exam.<br />7) make sure you know your formulas. Also, scope management appeared to be easy on the exam so focus on it to avoid silly mistakes<br />8) it appeared that easier questions are in the end. I was getting nervous after first 30 so started from 200 and went backwards. It helped me calm down.<br /><br />Good luck and remember: don't cheat yourself while studying and you will do great Lord willing.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I was not expecting another in the series so I grabbed this one when I saw it.  It's been a long time since I finished the first four but I did not need to review to get caught up.  Thanks Mr. Martin for keeping this world alive.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I have been using Checkmark for quite a while along with Note Everything. I have combined all my information to Evernote.  Only downside is the list making.  Hard to sort by priority and does not have a mass reset.  The more I use it the more I like it.  It is giving me a bit more faith in the \\"cloud\\".  So far I am really liking it.
B004L9MFM2|4.0|The series is fantastic. This book is also good but a bit slower than the first few in the series.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|It's angry birds, what more can one say.  The kids love the game and the seasons make it more fun
B008XBASVY|5.0|This book is so amazing it changed my point of view to writing, people, and life to the world I live in. Thanks, Chris Colfer!
B002BX4VEK|5.0|If you are to buy only a few Elvis CDs, I would put this one on your list, along with [[ASIN:B004C4IKCU Elvis Is Back! (Legacy Edition)]], [[ASIN:B00353RUO8 On Stage (Legacy Edition)]], [[ASIN:B00025L41W Elvis at Sun]], and [[ASIN:B00664R0WK Elvis Country (Legacy Edition)]].  That would be a good starting point.<br />When I bought this LP in 1969, from the opening bars of \\"Wearin' That Loved On Look\\" I KNEW it as something special, unlike anything Elvis has ever done before, or since.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great Grisham novel, fast paced with some good twists. Fun read, finished it in a day and a half. If you're a fan of his older work,you should enjoy this one.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I bought the Kindle version of this.  First of all, I need to mention that there are quite a few errors in the Kindle edition.  Pages weren't lined up properly (so when I went to the next page, 3-4 lines of text was repeated, and once some lines were missing).  The errors were concentrated in the beginning of the book and didn't affect my comprehension, but it was still annoying.<br /><br />As to the book itself, it was a pageturner.  I read it during one day of Christmas break.  I saw the surprise in Book 2 coming, as well, but I enjoyed the plot devices and the twists and turns.  The biggest problem is the last third of the book, as others have mentioned.  Ok, fine, it's not believable, but I don't really think that was the author's point for the entire book.  It's a thriller, and I can accept it on its own terms.  The last third, however, does not hold up even in the world of the novel.  It ran out of steam and was disappointing.  I still found the overall reading experience enjoyable, however.  It provided entertainment.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|This movie is gorgeous looking, amazing action sequences. A MIND BLOWING story, just beautifull and sad. But the lack of blood made the movie with too much cartoonish effect. But its still awesome.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|My daughter loves it, it came nicely packaged and it shows great.  No problems viewing, no smears or smudges on it.
B004IFYMYI|5.0|This is one the best BD packs there is, the material is perfect, the cards, the way it opens the disc art, everything, its totally worth it. And the movie what to say ? ARE YOU TALKING TO ME ?
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I didn't want it to end a perfect ending to the series. You will definitely see the evolution of Christian and Ana
B004ULEEY8|5.0|Imagine a war movie, but with alies, black hawk down meets aliens, its just awesome, its a realistic survival war catastrophe movie. very good.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game so much!<br /><br />If you don't have a facebook or a twitter you can still do the FREE offers. Just click on them, hit Like us or Follow us. then exit out! It worked for me!<br /><br />I highly suggest this game. :)
B006JSXYPA|4.0|The 3D in this movie is mind blowing, i'm not giving 5 stars because of Michael Bay choice of aspect ratio... if it was 1:85 would be a lot better.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Being an introvert. I found this book very informative. I have thought I was anti social and unfriendly when comparing myself to the life of the party type. Now it validates my true inner  feelings. I identified with almost everything in the book. Great read.
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|Easily one of best 3D's showcases out there, the Depth and pop out effects are top on the market. The documentarie itself is awesome as well, its scary that this wonderfull of the world could end.<br /><br />But if you want a 3D showcase, this is it.
0385738773|5.0|Great book good quality thanks again!! wish there was morw of them to read every night for a long time
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|The beginnig of one of the best franchies of all time, arnold at his almost best. A must have for terminator fans.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I have enjoyed Facebook.  It's great to find old friends and family and then stayed connected.  However, you are not sure about your privacy and they make certain things impossible to change.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|No words for it, i'm not giving 4 stars because of the disc covers, should have some art for each one, and not some default ugly cover...<br /><br />but the rest is beautifull, in disc content, bonus etc
B009FZHYKU|5.0|TV at its best! Some of the best drama of all time.<br /><br />At first I thought the show was about zombies. It's really more about humans maintaining morality in a world of absolute chaos. Definitely worth watching.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I've been playing this one on my smart phone and it's amazing at how much better it is on a tablet. Fun (and challenging) game!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've read some tear jerkers in my time, but wow. This was packed with so much raw emotion.  I fell in love with the characters and the unexpected twists that came their way. Warning you need tissues!!!!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|I thought they did a great job of tying the last movie to this one. I would recommend this flick to most viewing groups.
B0083Z614S|5.0|It was a very nice book. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Its characters and sweet innocence are a definite attractor. I highly recommend this book.
B00APUQRPC|2.0|Slow to start.  Unbelievable.  Difficult to connect with the characters. Not too meaningful. Once you suspend your belief, it was ok however.  Justin timberlake did the best job in this film.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|It was alright but it messed up a few times  while playing which made me a little disappointed  because of how much I paid to rent it
B009LDXQGC|4.0|I love 3 Doors Down. They're one of my favorite bands,and I own and love all their albums they've previously released. This is a great collection of songs at a great price. Like others,I feel a few other songs could've been included though. There's nothing from \\"Time of my Life\\" which I absolutely loved. I feel that at least \\"Every time you go\\" could've been included even though the record wasn't as successful as their others.<br /><br />The three new songs are fantastic! They rate among their best work in my opinion especially \\"Goodbyes.\\" What an amazing song!<br /><br />I would go for 5 stars,but I don't care for the remixing and remastering of the old songs. I have all the band's albums,and I prefer the original mixes. The new mixes sound muddy and compressed to me,and they're remastered way too loud to me also. When you crank the cd up it sounds distorted to me compared to the original versions. I guess this is another example of the \\"loudness\\" wars. The band's records have always been well-produced and engineered to me so I don't know what the thinking behind the remixing and loud remastering was. Why mess with a good thing?<br /><br />You can't really argue with the collection overall especially for the price. I think this is good for a casual fan looking for most of the hits,and big fans like me who want the new songs.
B0079R8KO0|5.0|Really good quality. I was amaze how wonderful this case is and the price. I will recommend this product to all my friends.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|Definitely a poorly designed set of games but then again considering they are free I can't complain. If not for the ad's on it I wouldn't mind so much but getting spammed to buy points every single time gets annoying. If you want my money make a game that's worth it.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This movie gave me something I didn't expect: a love for the greatest racing horse in history and great admiration for the housewife who risked all she had to bring him to his full greatness.  Why?  She loved him too.  I highly recommend this film to families and to anyone seeking a story that will surprise them with the truth.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|The game itself is fun as heck but half the time it says I can't play w/o internet because it has to download more ad's to spam me with. I get the free version needs ad's to support it but to be unable to play w/o a connection is stupid.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|This is a really good video.  I watched the entire thing with my 12 yr old daughter and did not get bored!  Nice extras as well with the videos and behind the scenes tour moments.  Totally worth the $15.  I know she will watch it again and again!
B001E45XT4|5.0|I wear glasses and it is hard for me to use headsets because they hurt after a while. These are one of the few pairs (including high priced ones) that don't hurt and they sound decent enough as well.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Great! I really enjoyed Rod's rendition of Christmas music. He can do anything and make it sound wonderful. Great, Great
B005R32L66|5.0|I love skype and now that I can get it on my android tablet I am a happy man. anytime I need to make a call I say screw paying $60 a month or more for a cell phone I will just call on my tablet for free!!!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The news feed only shows the first few stories and the rest won't load. Apparently this has been going on for months and there STILL hasn't been an update. Someone doesn't give a s***
B00066FBQG|5.0|This is a movie I have long enjoyed and this print added to that enjoyment.  The special features may not be many, but they are interesting and informative.  I highly recommend this edition of the movie.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Funny for all ages from pre teen to adult we enjoyed so much we watched multiple times together and shared with friends
B009VLXMJA|5.0|Taylor once again has but out a well rounded album. Her musical style on this album varies but is done wonderfully!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I have not ever finished a game on my kindle but this one will play to an end and otherwise you just start over to play more. Would have loved more levels.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Very good match 3 game with steadily increasing difficulty. Works great on my KFHD.  I recommend for every age group.
B008XG1X18|5.0|So glad they came out with this app for the Kindle. I really wanted it because I do not have a smart phone.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun game -  Don't find the ads all that distracting as some people have claimed.  Great for a free app.
B008MEM24S|5.0|so worth the .99 for this game. My son loves playing it and has enought levels for him. Some levels are challenging so it keeps it interesting even for adults.
B0055SWM08|5.0|very captivating,  mesmerizing,  and mind bending.  nice clean professional graphics and beautifully fitting soundtrack.  a great exercise for the mind.  well worth the expense, time, and effort!
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|a+! a lot of fun to play! very addictive though. would reccomend to anyone who loves puzzles or matching games
B008K9SG9K|4.0|I bought this for my daughter and she loves it.  As a parent, I haven't listened to it.  It's fine.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Nostalgic, bittersweet, and funny, this is a lovely effort. Beautiful cinematography, loving and quirky direction, a knowing and sympathetic script, and deft casting make this a movie to enjoy again and again. Two misfits run away together on the eve of a hurricane and all must be made right before the literal lightning finale. Highly recommended.
B008602KQI|5.0|This is a great movie but it's very sad and has LOTS of graphic violence!  Definitely not suitable for younger viewers.  This movie closely follows the book.
B005LAIII0|5.0|I didn't think I would like this movie but it was so amazing I couldn't wait to go back and see it again. It is now one of my all time favorite movies.
0593070631|4.0|I bought this for my daughter who loves McFly.  She got the book for Christmas and she's almost done with it...it's the day after Christmas!  As a parent, I wasn't too happy with a certain section of this book that contained some vulgar language.  I didn't think it was appropriate.
B008WCP2KG|1.0|No movie is more awful than this one, there is so much bad about this movie I don't even know where to start. The acting, absolutely horrible. The only thing worse than the script is the directing. There was absolutely nothing good about this movie and am now no longer a fan of any of the guys in it. I am so mad I wasted money on this.
B0052UYJDC|4.0|This was a great book, even better as a kindle deal of the day. I have been lugging stuff around for years after college and I finally got rid of some of it! Most of the ideas made sense to me, I incorporated some of them into my life. It's a great New Years resolution book for people trying to get organized and are looking for some inspiration.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was surprised at the ending...so different from the movie. Good book over all can not wait for the second one
B003O86FMW|5.0|Perfect series for those who like the idea that women can be the hero & that life is not simple.
0698118308|5.0|As always Eric Carle doesn't disappoint!  This is such an awesomely illustrated book and ties in very well when I teach lessons about clouds.  Just such a great book for my classroom.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My biggest problem with this series is that it had to end. S. Collins has managed to create an endearing tale where no character is without it's flaws.
B008KE3960|4.0|this game is good for relax & play games creating 2 everyone to play. khoachau like very much.many plane to deploy
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This book is engaging and uplifting.  There are so many people who feel unworthy of love, and this story puts them in focus.  The message of each flower was also fascinating.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game started out as something for my husband then my 5 year started playing and its like a bonding moment for them.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing loved it the best book ever until I read the 2nd one<br /><br />Five stars<br /><br />Totally for anyone with a hunting side or would enjoy syfy books
0553386697|5.0|I learned so much from reading this book!  A very complicated subject explained in an easy to understand way. Great book for anyone that works or lives with children!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am literally in love with this book. I didn't know it was possible for me to love characters as much as I love Augustus and hazel.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Wonderful cd! Her songs and lyrics become more complex and great with each album! I just got this one but I cannot wait for her next album!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I like this because it's words are big words  that I can't understand them so all I have. Have to do is look on the side and read the meaning
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is your basic solitaire game, but I use it a lot. Being able to play a game and leave it in the middle, just to be able to pick it up again, is really nice. It allows me to play between classes or at a doc appt.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I try to walk a straight line/ but all these wicked images in my mind/ all I think about is suicide/ then I ride/ one hand on the steering wheel/ as put my foot on the gas doin 95/ popping jiggers/ pulling triggers/ with my hand on my nine/
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I would recommend this book to everyone who enjoys reading.  Great storyline I can't wait to read the next installment.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Taylor as usual has done a great job, this CD is great! Easy listening would recommend to anyone who enjoys her music
B007RTAR64|5.0|beautiful keepsake Barbie looks amazing and love that it came with her pin and arrows and they didn't look bad at all
B005LW5J9O|3.0|The book does not come close to living up to it's sub-title, &#34;how the world became modern.&#34; Greenblatt just does not prove his case that a re-discovered poem by Lucretius really changed important people's minds in the Renaissance or thereafter.<br />On the other hand, the story of how &#34;book detectives&#34; searched for and preserved ancient works in the Middle Ages was very interesting, ditto the stories of Papal politics. Also it's a nice but too brief introduction to the philosophy of Epicurus.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This book was very interesting and always had me at the edge of my chair. I consider you read this book
B0068LYEHA|5.0|I really liked this book as a memoir, as a &#34;feminist tract,&#34; and as an enjoyable reading experience.  I loved Moran's &#34;inclusive&#34; feminism.  Subtle pervasive sexism is the enemy that needs to be sought out and eradicated.  This is not the feminism that condemns other women's choices or that sets up a model of what a feminist should be.  While Moran writes hysterically about 'sexy' panties, Brazilian waxes, high-heeled shoes, her critique is not of the women who choose these things, not if the choices are made from a position of strength, individuality, sense of fun, or sense of self.  She is not a finger-pointer.  She writes with a refreshing honesty about her own experiences and challenges, her own history, her own choices. And much of this book is frankly &#34;laugh out loud,&#34; funny.  My husband kept asking, &#34;What's so funny?&#34; and I would have to reply, &#34;Never mind.  You wouldn't get it.&#34;
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is addictive! The cut away scenes are very funny and the scenary is visually interesting. My husband and I have been taking turns playing the levels. Definitely worth the $4.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love how this game starts off SO slowly. Lots and lots of easy levels to learn on. If you get to a hard puzzle and don't get it right the first time, you can just redo it. No getting sent back to the first level or anything irritating like that.
B004LM72ZY|5.0|Our nephew's Mom put this on Oliver's wish list (he is 1 1/2) He immediately had to open the rocket and put the astronaut inside . He is playing with it daily.  It is very good quality ...not like  a lot of plastic toys these days. ThaNKS
B001W6S0C6|5.0|this movie enchanted me when i was a child, it still do the same thing more than 20 years later.
B004EPZ06G|2.0|Not as good as the first one but funny I love Steve G. He is halarious so anything with him is great. I liked it
B009JBZH54|4.0|i really enjoyr this films as a batman fan and movie lover but there is still something missing. these film are cold, spiritless  but really well done. the packaging is excellent by the way in comparison with the french one.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This show is amazing, the actors are very talented at what they do. I recommend this show to anyone who likes to laugh and has a family that is somewhat off like me. I can relate
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|The action was great but the plot was loose. The story just didn't hold the same appeal our intrigue that the first three did.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|This show is filled with intense moments keeps you on your feet and once you start this season you will be stuck watching it for hours to come. I was finished with this season in less than 2 days
0525952926|5.0|Read Fall of Giants and then this book.  As with Fall of Giants, you get a good feel with how the people were responding to the history around them.  I keep &#34;fact checking&#34; the book and have not been disappointed.  Great Book!
B005LAJ23A|5.0|This is a great show nice and scary lol, watch with your partner and see her jump. I would recommend this
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was, without a doubt, one of the greatest books I've read this year. It brings memories to me of the first time I read Perks of Being a Wallflower, where you know there is some hidden secrets that made the character everything they are in the book. This is a very, very tough subject to write about, and Coleen Hoover was able to approach it in such a way that you feel every emotion possible for the situation.  I don't think I've read a book where two characters may not say the right things, but they say the right things for each other.  Dean and Sky are so well developed, at the end of the book you feel like you know them. I actually got through almost the whole book without crying, except at the end when Sky was looking at pictures of her mom. That was the part where I broke down and cried. I cried for Sky, I cried for Dean, I cried for the little girl, I cried for Les, I cried for all of them.<br /><br />I truly recommend this book. To anyone who is hesitant, DON'T BE! You will not regret this book. It is love and pain, two sides of a coin together. It is everything a great novel should be, and you should get it RIGHT NOW!
B005IQ39AY|1.0|Only thing I don't like is there is no landscape mode for tablet. Otherwise quite addicting. Even my three year old niece loved it.<br /><br />Update: all of a sudden app started requiring internet and asked me to sign into amazon app downloader. WTH?! Uninstalled. Too bad too, I liked it.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Fantastic realism! A great mother/daughter story. My daughter and I both loved it and I recommend it for all ages.
B000WT5IUQ|5.0|The Carpenters Christmas album is a must have for any good seasonal music lover. So many songs for only $5, what a great deal.
B009MCRHH6|3.0|It was fun and challenging, but not something that I end up wanting to play again and again. I find I tend to choose other game aps instead.
B008CPZNL6|5.0|The developers quickly responded when I sent a question. I love that I have one app to go to for all my news feeds, twitter, Facebook, and tons of magazines I follow. Best android news all in one place. You do have to get the tablet update in the play store, but for a phone this is the perfect all around app.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|The characters are quirky and the situations unexpected.  This all makes for one hilarious book.  I found myself laughing out loud most of the time and it's not that easy to make me laugh out loud.  I urge some filmmaker to turn this into a movie! I will look forward to this author's next offering.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|How can one not enjoy this great enhanced reissue. The singing and dancing and the hit scene is just wonderful!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I love the hunger games so much and I found that the epilogue to this book was really good to tie everything together but parts of the book were slow and it overall was very depressing
B004G6009U|5.0|Loved this new Disney version of the Rapunzel fairy tale. Filled with comedic scenes and sadness and happiness and terror!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app has everything you need to know including the million dollar question, how long will it tame to charge! I use this app multiple times a day! Get it!!!! :D
B004AKCME8|4.0|Was a little scary but the story is lovely. It is done in lovely animation and has a nice theme.
B00A3VLJCE|5.0|This was designed for tablets so running this on the galaxy note 2 causes lots of UI issues. I wish adobe let the toolbar rotate vertically. That said the s-pen picks up sensitivty and brush feels great. Once you have your brush set you can go full screen and use pinch to zoom. Great program if adobe can get the UI working on the note 2 this would be a must buy for painting.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I absolutely love this game! It can become very addicting....can't put it down!! The grandchildren love to play it also.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Fun theme for a fun game. This original game is fun with the added themed version. May the force be with you.
B005S9EK1S|5.0|Zac Efron is a great actor!  He has really grown up in this movie!  The story line is not a chick flick at all.  The chemistry in this movie make it one to watch a couple times.
1451620829|4.0|I just finished reading this book over the Christmas holiday and really enjoyed it. I remember KISS back in the day and although not a huge fan, I did see them in concert in the mid-seventies. This book is filled with the usual rock & roll debauchery--KISS style that is. Aside from the tales of sex, drugs & well, yes rock & roll; what struck me most was the lack of cohesivness in this band. It seems from the \\"get-go\\" the members were divided (Gene & Paul vs. Peter & Ace)and there were ongoing disagreements on nearly every level--who's music was in for albums or concert sets. Who sang a song and how it was performed...etc. Throughout the book, Peter mentions several TV appearances made by the entire band or just one member (Gene Simmons on the Mike Douglas show) & I viewed the band on the \\"Tommorrow\\" show with Tom Snyder.  It went down just as Peter described in the book. He & Ace had downed champagne & some blow before their appearance.  This kicked Ace into high gear (normally, he was the most reserved member of KISS) & Tom Snyder LOVED HIM!! Meanwhile, we see Gene Simmons simmering on the side lines.  Great stuff! Sadly, Peter signed away his rights to KISS merchandsing and while the other members have made millions of dollars-he lags far behind.  He critizes Gene & Paul for turning the KISS band into the KISS BRAND but hey let's face it--that is where the real money was generated for them. Peter has few kind words for Gene or Paul but especially Gene who turns out is a GIANT DOUCHE BAG. I verified this too via you tubes video of Gene & Paul on the Oprah show & other interviews with him.<br />Overall a good entertaining read & I enjoyed traveling down lane to music in the 70's....
B0018QOIXU|4.0|I like the cd but 21 has the newer songs. Her voice is really fresh and clear on this cd.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I am a retired accountant and this is a great calculater. Easy to use,  fast and easy to read display.
B00MWFS4X6|5.0|Like it or not, Tim Burton's vision of Batman was that of a dark fantasy. In this fantasy things are perceived as they should be, not in a realistic way. For example, because Gotham City is a fictional city, it was shown as such in this movie. Production designer Anton Furst described the city looking as if the buildings had grown from hell without any height regulations.<br /><br />After over 75 years of existence there is technically no definitive version of what Batman really is. Like anything else, this character has changed so dramatically over the decades. To me Batman (1989) has stood the test of time perfectly because it depicts exactly what the Batman of the late 1980's was like.<br /><br />This movie is now so often compared with the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy started in 2005, but people forget what kind of an impact this film had upon it's release. While Heath Ledger truly did put in the performance of his career in The Dark Knight, people also seem to forget that Jack Nicholson, who is one of the greatest actors of all time, set a standard with his villainous portrayal of the Clown Prince.<br /><br />Overall I know this will always be my favorite version of Batman on screen (no it's not just nostalgia), this is the version of the character that I love in the way I enjoy seeing him.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great book. I wish every book was this interesting to read. I wish for everyone to read  it. Love it
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|Astoundingly visually stunning in it's entirety and completely surreal with every last scene of beauty accentuated by a 50ft IMAX screen. This film, done with the magic of the green screen, was created to bring to life the infamous Frank Miller graphic novel, not to illustrate a point in history.<br /><br />So for all the \\"historians\\" who disliked or had bad criticism for this film, it was not intended to necessarily be historically accurate. Powerful acting and as far as the battle scenes go, positively some of the most intense and detailed war scenes I have ever seen.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Great informative read.every human should read this. Is crazy how much has happened to our food that we don't know about
B003UESJJC|5.0|I have no idea how this movie doesn't have 5 stars and Platoon does, Platoon wouldn't even exist without AN, not to mention Charlie Sheen was only used in the movie to homage his father used in this movie, now. From Francis Ford Coppola the Godfather of the Godfather's comes the ultimate Vietnam flick.<br /><br />Apocalypse Now compared to Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket and Oliver Stone's Platoon, both remarkable works of cinema, hand's down takes the gold medal for best Nam movies. Showcasing an all-star cast (Brando, Sheen, Duvall, Hopper, Fishburne, Ford) it is the wildest of war rides and is most definitely among the top 50 greatest films of all time.
B002APS61I|4.0|I am a Christian so I am always looking for movies without violence and sexual content. This movie was captivating and very will done.  Keira Knightley was brilliant and I was transported back into that time period.  It is a perfect kindle movie for a woman.  I could almost watch it again.
B001CO42MU|5.0|Based on the true story of the infamous drug dealer George Jung, or Boston George, casually depicted by Johnny Depp, this film shows the eras which lead up to the cocaine trafficking boom in the 1980's. As every crime legacy goes, this film is complete with the absolute rise and fall of the legend.<br /><br />The unbelievable story of an entrepreneur consists largely of drugs, money and women as films of this caliber usually do. Filled with a really excellent soundtrack (one of the best of source music) to perfectly suit the film.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I am kinda bummed with the app for my kindle. I thought my phone was bad but I can look at maybe the 1st 10-20 updates then it just stops
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|Need more time! It is a great game and stuff. but I think that this is not a great deal
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved every moment if this story. It was gripping and fiercely written--the language is often stunning and sharp. My only critique came at the last twenty pages or so...I won't give anything away but I didn't love the ending. It felt much less developed than the rest of the novel, almost as if it was written in a rush. However, in all fairness the rest of the book was utterly breathtaking and thereby set a very high standard.  Overall I would undoubtedly highly recommend.
B003QSS2VW|5.0|It's a very entertaining movie, with a lot of plots.Good movie for a variety of ages. Even my daughter,2 years old loves it! It has great graphics and music! The movie is good for kids, expose them to a different country with a little different culture.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|I am glad I didn't go to the movies to see this, and waited to rent this at the house.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|My son is fascinated and happy that I have this app in my phone, very useful when I need he has to be quiet and seated in doctors appoinments or stores :)
B001OGWY1W|5.0|The movie is great! Classic the joker is the best character in the movie. \\"Why so serious\\" lol its a never get bored movie.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Good to have on the Kindle but don't use too much. Thanks for the freebie.Still enjoying Kindle just wish commercials wouldn't keep popping up!
0870703781|3.0|Great quality, excelent printing, typography, covering and colors.<br />It's OK cause of the photos inside as they don't fully and compleatly describes William's photography as should be in Guide book, I think. Overall good book but the list of photos could be better!
B004EPZ070|1.0|When I received it there was a hard substance smearing the disk.  Since I don't like the hassle of returning things, I bought another one.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Excellent love story along with psychological issues that are helped. Some irritating over use of words other than that I would read this book again !!!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|IT DOES TEST ONES TALENTS AS TO GAUGING YOUR DISTANCE WHEN IT COMES TO BLOWING THINGS UP, WHICH SEEMS TO BE POPULAR WITH THIS GENERATION
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Like i said in the title, I love this game, I love persona, but I feel more comfortable in a handheld system for it, nothing against home system persona games, I did buy P4, never finished it, I believe i stopped playing, it wasnt boring, just I felt odd, like I did play Persona 3 Portable before P4, maybe that is it. But overall Persona 4 has a strong story, the gameplay is very enjoyable, and the characters I feel in love with, I love the new additions that fixed P4, like Game Over, it asks you if you want to retry the floor that you were last on like say you died on the 7th floor, you will return to the 7th floor, I like Marie A LOT, she is cool, she has a few sides to her, but im not far but I do love this game, the feel, and I love how it feels on handheld. :) It looks Beautiful on the Vita.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|THE KIDS TODAY USE THIS APP TO STAY I CONTACT WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND IT LETS THEM THINK THAT IT IS ALL PERSONAL BETWEEN THEMSELVS

B0064X7FVE|4.0|FOR BASIC REFERANCE IN PLANNING FOR TRAVELING, I FIND IT VERY USEFUL WHEN I AM AWAY FROM HOME TO PLAN MY JOURNEY
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Great for grandchildren<br />My granddaughters really enjoyed it and advanced.  The eight year old did much better than the five year old, but she was very intent on mastering this game.<br />Thanks for the free trial.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|this book was one of the best books I ever read. I could not put it down. Need more books by Tatiana she is such a good writer.
B008WCP2PG|3.0|Okay, the guys are absolutely adorable, but the movie is way over talked about and way over rated.  If the whole point of watching the movie is for the cute guys, then buy it.  But if you truly want a movie with a good story line, then try a different movie.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book made me feel like I was v there and experiencing it all. It was truly well written and an excellent read.
B007MDB71O|1.0|Even a Tuesday-5-dollar-special screening of this film could not begin to compensate for the sheer agony of watching it.  I lost five bucks, fair and square. Never have I seen a big-budgeted film fail to not only communicate basic narrative information in a compelling way, but also to make me care even less whether I understood it or not. I used to joke about Lady in the Water to my students. Now I can update the joke. (Remarkably, both of these cinematic travesties originated from Disney.)
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing!<br />I rated this book  5 stars because it has imagery and it leaves you hanging. I just want to find out what is going to happen next(: it took me a day and a half to read this book. I never wanted to put it down.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Love the plot keeps you guessing throughout and the ending will surprise you. I will purchase the disk for home entertainment when released.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved the book, it showed emotion and love and the struggles in Charlie's life. The perks of being a wallflower is honestly my favorite.
B0058VW36U|1.0|Granted, it was in the hands of a 5 year old, and its largely my own d*mn fault for not disabling wifi, etc.<br /><br />Nevertheless, it is ridiculous that the option exists in the first place. So I (mis)direct my rage toward thee in a time-honored internet fashion!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I love it,it helps me wind down after a busy day. I ask s o think its a good game to help keep your mind sharp but without t he pressure of some games.
B00AJRQLTI|2.0|Saw the movie and listened to the samples. If you loved the movie and want to remember the scenes, you'll enjoy this. Otherwise, this will disappoint you if you've ever heard the Broadway or London productions. Musically, they are leagues ahead. Sadly, the worst voice was Russell Crowe. Visually, Crowe has my vote as the best of the cast. He does Javert on the big screen like he did his Gladiator role, imposing and beautifully measured movements that project strength and authority. Vocally, he can't sing the role at all, suited more for a mediocre high school play you are forced to watch as a parent. The music coming out of his mouth diminishes the strength he otherwise projects. Javert's signature aria \\"Stars\\" - painful. He is ok in duets and chorus numbers, such as the \\"Confrontation\\" duet with Valjean. And he sounds authentically broken down and dying in his suicide scene. I'm ok with him in the movie but this is about the soundtrack. I would prefer to give this 2.5 stars because, mercifully, there are only two cuts for Russell on the soundtrack.<br /><br />I enjoyed the movie and am a Les Mis fan all the way. These actors are terrific on the screen and it isn't all bad when you have it all together - on screen. I had to overlook the soundtrack to enjoy the movie. I warmed up to Hugh Jackman singing Valjean. Anne Hathaway sings well as Fantine, although after Susan Boyle, \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" is nearing overdone. Eddie Redmayne sounds terrific as Marius. Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter are great as the Thenadiers - sing their roles with pluckiness and relish, though not breaking new musical ground. Amanda Seyfried sings well as Cosette, on par with Broadway. \\"One Day More\\" is fabulous, and made me forget Broadway for a moment, as is the epilogue. The 1987 and 2010 cast recordings are FAR superior musically to this soundtrack. Plus, you get the entire musical story that you can follow, not just the highlights.<br /><br />Again, if you loved the movie, the soundtrack will bring the scenes to life; but don't buy this for the music. If you are a first-timer, see the movie and wait for the blue ray if you LOVE the movie. Regardless, get one of the excellent recordings of the London cast, the 1987 or the 2010 Broadway. Better, break down and read the unabridged novel. It will change you and the world will be a better place. You will enjoy the movie and musical versions so much more, too.

B0094BB4TW|1.0|This APP is bugged and does not work properly on the Kindle Fire 8.9 HD. It only allows review of about 10-15 items on the status page. As you scroll down the page it stops and wont load any more items. I reported this to Facebook ( as well as seeing that 100's of others have reported the same issue) to no avail.<br />My daughter has the original Kindle fire and the APP works fine with it so I dont know if the issue is facebook or the Kindle. Its just frustrating that you buy a product that supposedly supports the APP and it doesn't.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|just got auto update on my Kindle Fire HD.  now i can see all posts and there are some other cool new features.  thanks!
0062068415|4.0|SHUTTER ISLAND has all the traits of an old school Gothic novel; stormy weather, mysterious characters, the action located on an enormous estate (In this case an island asylum for the criminally insane), and a doomed love affair. Lehane pulls out all stops as his as the surreal atmosphere starts to skew the reader's perception of reality and generally succeeds in creating a feeling of uneasiness in the reader as the nature of the island's mysteries start to become clear. I thought the central mystery was not particularly difficult to figure out but I thought the way Lehane goes about revealing the truth of the island's mysteries deserves some praise as even when I had a basic idea of where the story was going I felt he pulled it off with style. The emotional component and the utter tragedy involved make it an effective blend of 50's style noir and Gothic romance.
B0087EVHVW|5.0|It works fine with my GTX 660Ti - benchmarking games of 2012 run without hick-up. Has an Intel HD 2500 to fall back to in case of emergency, not the most powerful one but actually runs well with older games on its own.<br />Haven't tried pushing it to the limit, but it does the job I need it to do.
B0076DELIG|4.0|A typical Bosch mystery with an intriguing cold case premise. As is usual with Connelly the meticulous attention to detail displayed by Bosch is fascinating.  It's also fun as tough guy Bosch struggles to relate to his sixteen year old daughter.

B0067EKY7M|3.0|What do you expect from a film titled \\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\"? Nature documentary, or quirky comedy like \\"The Men Who Stare at Goats\\"? With stars Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt, \\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\" is a romantic comedy with an unusual storyline - storyline that could have been more interesting.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor plays Dr. Alfred Jones, a British fisheries expert, who is approached by Emily Blunt's investment consultant Harriet to help realize the incredible plans of her client Sheikh Muhammed (Amr Waked): salmon fishing in the Yemen. The doctor thinks the sheik's plan is \\"fundamentally unfeasible\\" and declines politely, but Prime Minister's press secretary Patricia Maxwell (Kristin Scott Thomas), believing this is a great chance to improve the UK-Yemeni relationship, would not take no for an answer.<br /><br />\\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\" greatly benefits from the chemistry between the stars Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt, and the comedic turn from overzealous press secretary by Kristin Scott Thomas, but curiously director Lasse Hallström seems to have ignored the film's potential for a more involving storyline. Based on a bestselling novel in UK by Paul Torday and adapted by Simon Beaufoy of \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" fame, the film could have been something more than a pleasant if formulaic romance.<br /><br />After all, we don't know why the story must be about \\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen.\\" Who is Sheikh Muhammed and what does he want? We are told he is a \\"visionary\\" person, but even a visionary person would do something when he knows his life is in danger. Also, we are not allowed to know much about Captain Robert Mayers (Tom Mison), Harriet's boyfriend. Alfred's wife Mary Jones (Rachael Stirling) fares slightly better, though little attention seems to have been paid to her character.<br /><br />For all the beautifully shot locations (in England, Scotland and Morocco, not Yemen), \\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\" works most when the two stars share the screen, both deservedly nominated for Golden Globe. But don't expect much from the rest of the film.

I cannot figure out how to add my own city and have access to both places, and it has stated the same temp since I first set in to Chile.  Occasionally when I turn on my Kindle, a message will appear stating it could not update weather due to no wifi.  Shouldn't it update when I AM using wifi, instead of selecting occasional times to try??
B006LSZECO|2.0|I read Flynn's Sharp Objects before I read Gone Girl.  Consequently I was sorely disappointed in Gone Girl.  Amazing Amy and Nick certainly deserve each other.  This is the first novel I've read in a long time that was a struggle.  The story is well-crafted, I just didn't care about any of the characters in the book.  I'm now reading Flynn's Dark Places.  Already I find Libby far more interesting than either Amy or Nick.  Same writer, go figure.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Not as good as some of his older stuff.  Actually would like to see Amazon create a Electronic/Hardback combo pack.  that way you could download any bood you ordered in Hardback and not have to pay for the book twice like I did.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|The rental was only for 24 hours (should have used Red Box or Netflix) and I was called away about 1/4 through the movie.  What I saw looked pretty good.  Very lousy policy to have rental for only 24 hours.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|I doubt comedy was the intention of the film, but I found myself laughing out loud.  This was awful. Truly awful. I love Alien and Aliens, and this, well this, is just awful. I have no other word to describe it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is advertised as being eroticism for the modern woman. In reality, it encourages misogynistic stereotyping, i.e. women like to be beaten up, women will submit to sadism to &#34;save a man&#34;, etc. It's about as sexy as a black eye. In addition, it is poorly written.  I'm sorry to see so many people buying it and perpetuating destructive myths about women... not to mention, encouraging others to copycat this sort of crap.
B00280LYIC|4.0|i loved it!  it was funny and interesting, and i really got into it even though the main character was 3 years younger than me. i only had two problems:<br />  1. a not nice word was used a few times. most people don't mind that word, but it bothered me.<br />  2. i didn't agree with the mom's final decision about the stepdad.<br /> as a christian, i know the ideas about greek gods aren't true, so as long as this book is taken as pure fantasy, i loved it.
B00A2FSTC4|4.0|Just purchased this so I could watch on Amazon Prime video - the movie was good. Interesting premise, decent acting, and some cool visions of the future. One thing that stood out was the way the the lead character interacted with the central computer with hand gestures - this seemed very avant garde in ~2002 however today you do this with the Microsoft Konnect (sp?) system.<br />Overall, a decent movie.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is not the best book out of the series but it is very good. One thing that I don't like about it is the plot is zig zagged around in places.....it goes from Greg in his early life to present day. And I don't get why they want toilet paper. A few things that I do like about it is that the fact that in the series of books.....each on has over 750,000 complies sold! And another con about it is what does \\"The Third Wheel\\" have to do with the book?<br /><br />But all in all the book is a funny hilarious book that should appeal to a lot of people from ages 9-16.
B003DNN0L2|4.0|Another quirky, fun movie from Wes Anderson, great for the family, highly recommended.  I just had to own it myself.
B00AGDVWDK|5.0|While it doesn't have as big a media exposure as &#34;It's a Wonderful Life,&#34; I think in many respects &#34;The Bishop's Wife&#34; is better and far more emotionally engaging. The interplay between Cary Grant and Loretta Young is wonderful and David Niven's performance is priceless. This movie will put you in the right spirit, guaranteed!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|My daughter loves this app but as a parent I don't like that you have a certain amount of diamonds and then you have to pay. Other than that it is definitely a great app and I recommend it.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|This is nice because my son loves building these every day.  There are lots of pieces, but these are legos.  I liked the city versions a bit better because they gave you winter options for regular legos, but my son likes the star wars stuff.  These are usually hard to find so start looking at retailers and online in October for them each year.  We are on our 3rd one and he has loved them all.

0425263908|4.0|Review on The Reader's Commute:<br /><br />What can be determined from this synopsis?  Too many ellipses, for one thing...<br />(See what I did there?)<br />Also, Gideon is handsome and sexy in an unbelievable way, and he has lots of inner demons to battle.<br /><br />While I could certainly make this entire review a comparison between Bared to You and Fifty Shades of Grey, I want to just examine Day's book as a separate story.<br /><br />(Although, I have to say: I like the name Christian Grey better than Gideon Cross.  Also, it just hit me as I saw the cover for the second book, Reflected in You - GC = Gideon Cross.  CG = Christian Grey.  Coincidence?)<br /><br />Eva, as a narrator, is pretty likable.  Of course, it was easy to be jealous of her pretty hair, gym body, great wardrobe, nice apartment, cool job, and handsome, wealthy boy-toy...<br />All joking and ellipses aside, I found Eva to be a very interesting and well-written protagonist.  Her inner-monologue is funny and insightful.  A description of New York City on page 3 was charming and familiar:<br /><br />\\"Real New Yorkers cruised right through it all, their love for the city as comfortable and familiar as a favorite pair of shoes.  They didn't view the steam billowing from potholes and vents in the sidewalks with romantic delight, and they didn't blink an eye when the ground vibrated beneath their feet as the subway roared by below, while I grinned like an idiot and flexed my toes.  New York was a brand-new love affair for me.  I was starry-eyed and it showed.\\"<br /><br />Eva is young and determined, if very privileged.  It was hard for me to not root for her.  When she meets and begins a flirtation with the wealthy and handsome Gideon Cross, I bought the attraction (unlike the Fifty Shades pairing.  Okay, comparisons are done).<br /><br />As a reader, my heartbeat actually quickened at the first description of Gideon - his dark hair, blue eyes, and expensive dress suit are right up my alley.  I know the plot is pretty hard to believe in general, but one thing that irked me was definitely the fact that every man in Eva's life is impossibly good-looking.  Aside from Gideon, her roommate Cary is an up-and-coming model with a face that can \\"make angels weep.\\"  Cary's lover, Trey, is good-looking.  Eva's boss, Mark, is also good-looking, as is his partner.  Gideon's brother is good-looking.  Eva's step-brother is good-looking.  Eva's Krav Maga instructor is pretty smokin', too.<br /><br />Is there not a normal-looking man in the bunch?<br /><br />As Gideon begins to pursue Eva, maybe some of his tactics set off warning bells in my head.  He has most of her personal information filed away.  He researches her favorite drink.  He knows her clothing sizes as well as the shades of cosmetics she uses.  Creepy and obsessive?  Sure.  But heck, reading about their flirtation and eventual relationship is so fun.<br /><br />The sex scenes are well-written and certainly entertaining, although they got repetitive as the book progressed.  I found myself skimming over them in favor of following along with the actual plot and character development.  What I found most interesting about Eva and Gideon's story was this: they are both survivors.  They're both struggling to make it along, and they want to make it together.  In real life, could they work out as a couple? Should they work out?  I'm not sure, but I'm willing to read along and find out.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book really had me fooled for the first half and just when I thought I knew how it would end...it didn't happen the way I thought.  Great reading although it was a bit too dark for me.  Really enjoyed it but I won't be reading more of this genre.
0205313426|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite writing books.  I used it from high school English class all the way through my doctoral disseration.  Only bought another copy so I could loan it to my own students and never be without one of my own.

Totally awesome on both the magical music and the hight quality vinyl pressing.

I am not a huge fan of Yahoo Mail...it has it's annoying issues.  Because of my business, I have not tried any other email provider, except AOL years and years ago.  But, Yahoo! is mostly reliable, and I usually can manage to get done what I need to.  So, I'm sticking with it for now.  Maybe when I retire, I will try a better one.  PS:  Thanks Santa...I think I'm going to like my new Fire...when I learn how to operate it!  ;)
B0052RDHTM|5.0|His character development is unparalleled as you dive right into the lives of his main characters. You are transformed to their world which includes their thoughts, feelings and emotions. One of my favorite authors, I flew through this book wanting more and more. The fortunate part is that this is book 1 of the trilogy, so my want will most certainly be taken care of as I dive into book 2. Follett has done it again, and you would be mistaken to not read this amazing book and series.
B005FITIK0|3.0|Diablo Cody has a voice, and seemed to have it right from the get-go with \\"Juno.\\" She has an eye and ear for interesting characters and comes up with way left of center situations to put them in. This might not be her best but it's still well worth the watch.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) is a ghost writer working on the final installment of a series of books written for young adults. The series has run its course and she doesn't know what she'll do when it's finished. She receives an e-mail announcing the birth of a baby fathered by an old high school flame (Patrick Wilson). She psychotically takes this as a sign she should visit him to rekindle a relationship with him even though he is happily married. She makes the trip and, as one can imagine, screws everything up.<br /><br />This is a character driven movie and Charlize is at the center. She is an alcoholic who cannot seem to get over her glory days as a high school prom queen, who could have had pretty much any guy she wanted. She can't carry on a meaningful conversation and lies incessantly. She has a tiny dog but why? She barely seems able to keep it alive much less fulfilled. She will plot and maneuver to get back with her beau and has deluded herself into thinking he's not happily married. She runs into Matt Freehauf (Patton Oswalt) with whom she was locker neighbors in high school. Now he's on a crutch after a beating he took at the hands of some jocks who thought, mistakenly, that he was gay. But he lives with his sister and does the things that mean something to him. He builds and paints super hero models, distills bourbon and other things that take his mind off his loneliness. He also doesn't take any crap from Charlize. He lets her know she's screwed up and that what she's doing is crazy and wrong.<br /><br />There's a lot to say about this movie so I'll stop here. This is a very good, very watchable flick. I liked scene after scene. Jason Reitman has been very consistent in his projects and is on the money here. The biggest problem is the ending. It's as though she didn't know where to take the character and just tacked on a totally pat, unbelievable ending. But it's still better than a lot of the stuff out there. See it.
B002VWNID6|1.0|I gave this to my wife for Christmas along with other presents because she loves the movie and we lost our original DVD a while ago.  It's difficult to believe that DVD's which require flipping (to see the whole move) are still being sold at the end of 2012.  She's not happy about that.

B002L6I9Z4|3.0|I recently purchased this for my son as a fun desk top piece.  He gave it too his 4 year old because she liked it and it  does not take  high quality pictures.  Nice conversation piece, but not for someone looking to take great photos.  The iPhone is much better.

If you don't get to the House of Night immediately, you could die. That's where the marked go to live, learn about vampyrish things and to see if they make it through the Change. Because not all of them do. Zoey Redbird is special. Her grandmother knows it, and Zoe has a crazy vision of her importance in this new world. As she struggles to find her place, she gets crossways with Aphrodite, one of the most powerful girls at school who has her own special powers.<br /><br />Her new roommate, Stevie Rae, and her friends welcome Zoey immediately. And then there's Erik. Aphrodite's ex, who seems to be interested in Zoey...but is he for real?<br /><br />Best Thang `Bout It: The idea that a person had no control over whether they became a vampyre was intriguing. The rituals and the evil edge gave this book its oomph. It was a fun enough read that I will check out the next in the series.<br /><br />I'm Cranky Because: This series was recommended to me by a teen shopping in the Young Adult section at Barnes & Noble. I can see why she really liked it, but my guess is that when she's an adult, and she re-reads it, it won't be as great as she thought. It is really angsty and dark, which isn't all bad, but I can see why it would really appeal to a kid. Also, I don't remember ever finding out how the people marked were chosen.<br /><br />I agree with what my fellow blogger Jen Bigheart said on Goodreads, that there was some weird preachy part about oral sex that was out of the blue, with the statement \\"[t]hose of us with functioning brains know that it is not cool to be used like that.\\" There were also some ugly comments made about actual living people that seemed out of place and mean spirited. What was that all about?<br /><br />I know this is trivial and stupid, but why'd they spell vampires \\"vampyres?\\" I really annoyed me at first. Then I blocked it out. Also, the parents (Mom and Step-Dad) were a-holes.<br /><br />Should You?: Yes, especially if you are feeling dark and angsty and ritualistic. Or not.

1451627297|5.0|Wow! I've read just about everything Stephen King has ever written which, given King's almost inhuman prolificness is saying something, and will readily admit not all have been masterpieces, but 11/22/63 is easily amongst his very best. And I happen to think that King's best stands amongst the best of anyone out there. (Anyone who thinks he's \\"just a horror\\" or \\"pulp\\" author isn't actually paying attention. And I have little doubt that, in future generations, King will be studied the way other once-dismissed-as-pop-culture-fads are now; e.g. Charles Dickens.)<br /><br />On par with [[ASIN:0307947300 The Stand]] and [[ASIN:0141800127 The Body]] (the novella [[ASIN:B00003CXIP Stand By Me (Special Edition)]] is based on), 11/22/63 weaves a spell-binding tapestry of history, time travel and holds you all the way to its stunning, and utterly unpredictable, climax. This is an 850-page read that is stay-up-all-night good. Even as a mom whose \\"leisure\\" time is oh-so-limited, I managed to finish it in two days because I just HAD to know what happened next ... It's that engrossing. (And other moms of young kids out will get how truly difficult--verging on impossible--it is to carve out the better part of two days to read.)<br /><br />Honestly, despite being an avid reader,  I haven't read a book this spellbinding in a LONG time. Find the hours. This one is well worth it.

1455502758|5.0|Back when Christopher Hitchens' controversial book \\"God Is Not Great\\" came out, I bought it to challenge my Christian faith and therefore become a more \\"fully armored\\" believer.  Instead, he (and other rationalists such as Richard Dawkins) prompted my journey into atheism.  I was saddened to hear that Mr. Hitchens had been diagnosed with cancer, and then dismayed when he passed away.  \\"Mortality\\" is a collection of his final works, a bittersweet read knowing that it's his last testament.<br /><br />\\"Mortality\\" is a firsthand documentation of Mr. Hitchens' ultimately losing struggle with esophageal cancer.  He provides fascinating, brutal insight into his grueling treatment, all the while hoping for a cure and continued survival but not blinding himself to the worst-case outcome.  Of course, he discusses religion in these essays, promising to avoid it to the end - which he did.  The last chapter is a collection of fragmentary writings drafted before his passing, and there is a touching afterword by his wife.<br /><br />It's a tragedy that such a magnificent voice of reason has been silenced forever, but thankfully that there are plenty of Mr. Hitchens' works (from books to podcasts) left to discover and enjoy.  \\"Mortality\\" is a short but decent coda to a life lived rationally, and I'm grateful for the part he played in freeing me from religious bondage.  Recommended - but be careful if you're a Christian, because you may just find yourself at the beginning of an exciting journey.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|Pretty sweet game! Its pretty much Outrun from back in the day, brought back to life on the android.  I was a little eerie about the controls but they are actually not bad.

So when friends started telling me about how funny &#34;Pitch Perfect&#34; is, I was skeptical.  But this movie is GENIUS!  So well-written that  was actually writing some of the lines down because they are hilarious!  And of course, ANY movie with great music and dancing is a big plus in my book!  This is a fabulous movie and i cannot wait to see it again.  I was hoping it would never END!

I loved all of the pictures of the costumes that he wore and some of the outfits were never released. The book contained many fond memories of MJ and it was a very touching book. Michael Bush was a very lucky person to meet and work for Michael Jackson. It's such a shame that none of these beautiful outfits will ever be placed into a museum dedicated to the king of pop. (Thanks to the Jackson Family). I reconmmend this book to anybody who is a fan of fashion and of MJ.

B008IYOEZM|4.0|I watched Season 6 as streaming content on Amazon, not as DVDs, so my review only has to do with the content of the show.<br /><br />I watched the first few seasons of Dexter, but grew tired of the series and some of the characters by Season 4.  The finale of that season hooked me back in (Rita's death).  I loved Season 5 and couldn't resist another season, so I watched 6 all the way through.<br /><br />This season is still very good.  Dexter's psychological (and spiritual) development continues, and other characters are evolving nicely (particularly Deb, who seems stronger in a leadership role as lieutenant).  The characters' complex relationships with one another is still one of the most engaging aspects of the show.<br /><br />On the negative side, the episodes felt drawn out, as if the writers were simply trying to take an idea and stretch it out into a full season's worth of content.  I found myself getting bored and restless by season's end.  Nevertheless, the finale is a real doozy (rivals Season 4's finale in terms of \\"wow\\").<br /><br />If you are a Dexter fan, you have to watch Season 6.  It may leave you with some mixed feelings about some of the story lines, but there's no doubt that Dexter is still one of the best shows on television.

B00AAI4W4M|5.0|*Does not include motors or track*    I am the nut-job parent that you'll see in some of the other train reviews. I grew up with Lego and returned to it when I had kids. I am terribly partial to Lego (ignore my star rating), but I'll give you the best review I can so that you can make the best decision for your kids. I do not receive free sets or compensation for my Lego reviews.    Introduced on 12/27/2012 for an MSRP of $129.99, the Horizon Express train is the third in Lego's Creator train series (now called \\"Creator Expert\\") that Lego appears to be releasing on a two-year schedule. These are highly detailed and realistic sets designed with the train enthusiast in mind and customizable with Power Function accessories (see below). The earlier sets were the Emerald Night (10194 from 2009) and the Maersk train (10219 from 2011). The Creator Expert trains are completely compatible with Lego's other train sets.    The Horizon Express is Lego's most realistic high-speed train ever. It is a close approximation of the French TGV Sud-Est, the original orange TGV that began service in 1981. The set includes an engine and two passenger cars, the latter sharing a bogie (called a Jakobs bogie) just like the actual train. There are six mini-figures: four passengers, a conductor, and in what may be a first for Lego, a female train engineer. The interiors of all three cars are detailed and accessible via lift-off tops. The engine has a cab with controls and faux mechanical equipment. The passenger cars include chairs, café, coffee machine, chest with drawers, and a restroom with a sliding door. The passenger cars also have brick-built doors. Pantographs (the metal arms that touch the overhead wire) sit atop the engine, and electrical connections adorn the tops of the two passenger cars.     As with the earlier Creator trains, this one is entirely brick built and includes many advanced building techniques. The arrow detailing on the side of the engine, for example, is built froma stack of bricks arranged sideways. There are a small number of stickers. The train is built on orange train bases, which makes things simple (as opposed to built up layers of plates). The recommended age range is 14, but if your child is an experienced Lego builder, this set will not be particularly difficult. By all means, if you're an adult who is eager to share this experience with your child, throw out the recommended age range.    If you buy one of these sets, you are going to be very tempted to purchase another. More so than the other Creator sets, this one looks incomplete with only two passenger cars. Many people will be buying two sets in order to have something approximating a full TGV trainset (though TGVs usually run with eight or more carriages). Fully anticipating this, Lego included extra number stickers so that additional cars are properly marked.    Of course, the set has very good playability. Well, I should say that I can literally put train wheels on just about any brick structure, drop it on the track and my kids love it. All trains are magical in their eyes. But this train is great because it looks fast standing still and it has good access to the inside (where there is a lot going on). Kids are going to expect to run it on a track, and since this set does not come with track or motors (see below), it is perhaps easiest to start with a City-line set (which includes motors, track, etc.) and then add this later. However, if you have a child who is an experienced builder, you may want to go straight to buying this set.    The Creator sets don't remain on the shelves forever. If history is any guide, this set may last through most of 2014 before it is replaced. I would not expect more than a small markdown at any time. Check my guide (mentioned below) or Lego for accurate pricing information.    The set does not include motors or track, but it is designed to accept motors and Lego includes directions. The battery replaces the faux mechanical equipment in the engine, the actual motor replaces one of the bogies, and the infrared receiver drops in next to the battery. You need the following parts to complete the job: 88002 (motor), 8884 (IR receiver), 8879 (IR transmitter), and ONE of the following:  -8878 (rechargeable battery) with 8887 (transformer for recharging)  -88000 (AAA battery box).  You also have the option of adding lights to the engine (part #8870). Sometimes these parts are available on Amazon, but you usually need to go straight to the Lego site to order them.    For track, you can either buy the following packs or go directly to the Lego site and purchase straights and curves a la carte (in the Pick a Brick section). The current track sets are:  -7499 Flex and Straight Track (16 pieces of flex track and 8 pieces of straight track).  -7895 Switches, USD 15.99: in addition to left and right points, the set includes 4 curved sections.  -8867 Flexible USD 24.99: these are smaller pieces of track, each one of which swivels with the next; they allow for complex curves and, importantly, the resolution of unusual track angles. There are 64 of these small pieces in this set. When strung together the length is 85 inches.    If you have the earlier generation 9V Lego train, the Horizon Express can easily be adapted to 9V motors. The track is the same gauge. Lego has discontinued 9V, and if you are just starting out with Lego trains, you are best going with the current system (Power Functions) since 9 volt parts and track have become scarce.    Lego produced a short video with the designer discussing the train. It is available on Youtube (search \\"Lego Horizon Express 10233\\"). If you click through my name, I have an Amazon guide on Lego trains that has the latest offerings and advice.    Cheers
B000GCFO0S|5.0|great movie, it is worth watching and not bad of a price that i paid. and it came with great packaging.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Very good. I get better each time I play it. I give it five stars.) Try it out you will like it.
B007RTAR64|5.0|My daughter is 14 and has not played with Barbies for many years but she loved getting this collective doll! The details are very nice.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|This item shipped quickly, came in great quality.  Chose this user due to high star ratings and would recommend them.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Unbelievably good read.  Read it in an afternoon.  Couldn't put it down.  I laughed.  I cried.  I am now praying for a sequel!
0718177517|5.0|I'm usually a slow reader but devoured this 300 page book in only 3 days.  It's very well written and concise.  The author goes into a lot of the military acronyms but everything is thoroughly explained so I was never left wondering what was happening.<br /><br />There are many great points to this book:  the drive and determination it takes to become a Navy SEAL; the training; details of some of the missions in the War on Terror; and the detail about the actual raid.<br /><br />The only downside to the book was that there was too much detail about some things (what he had to eat, for instance) or too many pages spent on raids that had nothing to do with the bin Laden mission.  The book could have easily been cut by 100 pages.  I give it 5 stars anyway; it's engrossing.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|It was easy to play on the kindle fire hd. I enjoyed the game.  I bought another one which is different than this one..
0439023483|5.0|Don't make the mistake of believing this is a trivial work about teen issues or that it's just for kids. The Hunger Games is a top notch science fiction novel in the tradition of Margaret Atwood, George Orwell and Aldous Huxley This is to say, Collins uses the device of a future society to comment on contemporary culture. What this book is actually about is modern American and the condition of endless war we seem to have accepted. It's about unequal distribution of resources as a mechanism of control, and psychological operations (PSYOPS) as a method of warfare. In other words, an allegory about the world we are living in. The Capitol represents the US and other developed nations, while the Districts represent the third world, places like Nigeria where resources are extracted with no benefit to, and often the brutalization of, the local populations. But don't worry about that--on the surface, the Hunger Games is a \\"can't put it down\\" adventure story of the first rank, and Katniss is a deep, complex and admirable character. The book is rooted in the classics, and not just modern ones such as 1948 and ANIMAL FARM, but the Ancient Greek cannon. Those familiar with the Theseus story will instantly recognize the source of the Hunger Games (sorry Battle Royale fans!) Finally, Katniss is perhaps the most faithful translation of the virgin huntress (Artemis/Diana) into any major work of modern literature. There is a lot more to Suzanne Collins than meets the eye.
B0063IH60K|2.0|This is okay, for simple solitaire, quick and easy to play, but I do not like the commerials between each game.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|I thought they did a better job with this one than the previous one. This one kept the intensity throughout. I was thoroughly surprised with this film.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a pretty addicting game. Regeneration is a little slower than I would like. But overall it is pretty fun.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I like it but, it does NOT have all the features of the p.c like... the water bucket, lava bucket, mindcarts+ tracks, levers, buttons...Ect. but I like the graphics, creative and survivle mode.
B009T8XBBO|1.0|This app does not work on Kindle Fire; waste of time and money. Game looks interesting, wish I could play it.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I like this app. It is convenient to have weather available twenty four hours a day. It works as described.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|This was one of my favorite trilogies and I bought it. The packaging is surprisingly small with very thin Blu-ray covers which is pretty good and doesn't take up much space. I enjoyed seeing all the action in HD. Would recommend it !!
B00A757EFW|5.0|It's a lot of fun when you have to waste some time at an airport or car repairs.  Just like the old game I use to play.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|draw me a pretty picture is what I use to say and now I just want to know what it is lol
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|This CD is second best behind Rater R. I like each track especially number 5 and it is defiantly better than Loud.
B000FCKC4C|3.0|So I finally read this book and must say, it was sweet but not a 'must read' for me. If only life were that simple!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is fantastic. It tells you exactly how much battery life you have left and how much time you have to do different things.  I don't have anything bad to say at all.
B0027UY8B8|5.0|I checked various versions on the product and bought this pack. The packaging is sturdy and wonderfully compact. As mentioned in one review, the quality of the HD version is not what I expected. However, the first disk seems to be the worst of the lot with a lot of grainy shots. However from the second disk it improves a lot and you can see Commander Adama's facial features quite close :). I would still recommend this for any fan of Battle star galactica as the quality is far superior to the DVD set. It would look fine on a 40' LED. The special features are not on HD and is at 480p.<br /><br />Overall I still say it was a good buy and I am going to take my time to savor every episode of it and make it last!!!
1592403913|5.0|Lynne Truss does an excellent job of bringing the need for grammar to life.  With pictures, this book is improved upon even more for those who have a hard time interacting with text and rules.<br /><br />Everyone should read this at some point in their life, as texting and other associated activities alter our interpretation of written and/or typed word.  There is a method to clarifying what you mean in your text message!  Punctuate it correctly.  I feel like this would radically change our culture for the better.<br /><br />This book is put together like a children's picture book, with a nice textured hard cover and thick, glossy pages.  The illustrations are colored and match with the textual subject matter.  The text has substance with dry wit and humor; yet is purposeful in achieving its goals.  I would especially recommend this for college students.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game and it keeps my and my kiddo busy for those long waits in line and such.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|bought this for my grand daughter to listen to while visiting for Christmas on a gold box special. She was very excited to listen to it while we played PS3 games. I was surprised I thought it was good also
0785139168|5.0|This book pleasantly surprised me, I didn't expect to like it as much as I did. It stays true to original book with only few changes to make it better for graphic adaptation of the story.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good game but its not quite challenging enough for me plus I don't like getting into a game and have to pay to keep playing also having to do this crap to get the rest of the game its blackmail twice because you have to pay in the game when it says its free. And having to write this to get the rest of the game I payed for I only hope I get it
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|It was funny as always but sometimes I don't get why Greg has to b completely hopeless with girls lol
B00006AFF5|4.0|One of my professors once told me that this movie was Jim Carrey in a Grinch suit.  It is precisely that.  If you have seen it before and like it, this is a good edition to own; if you have not seen it, I would perhaps spend my money on the animated version instead.<br /><br />Many of the references and special effects in this film now look dated, which is sad given that it is not that old.  Also, you must have a patience for Jim Carrey's efforts at expansion in the character of the Grinch, as it is at times crude to the point of worthless offense.  However, the supporting cast is great and the costumes are fun.  The dog is well trained and groomed in a cute fashion.<br /><br />Overall, if you really like the story of the Grinch and like Jim Carrey's style of humor, this is a great movie.  If not, you are in for a long but colorful experience.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|here piggy piggy we love you little piggy. My daughter and I can not put this game down. it makes us squeal.
B007UWBQEU|5.0|went to the Blown Away tour concert so I had to get the albumn. Love the songs. My wife and I enjoyed both and now can keep it night alive with this addition to her IPod
B000I9YWDO|5.0|Hilarious<br />Epic<br />Classic<br />Hysterical<br />Timeless<br />A must-see<br /><br />A must have in your DVD library.<br />Feeling depressed? This movie is the Prozac of comedies.<br /><br />I watch this movie at least once a year for the past 10 years.<br />Why don't they make Office Space 2 ?
B00AMBH70S|4.0|There is lots of action, perhaps even too much.  It is never ending.  But it was fun to watch and it is interesting that it left open a future possibility.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|A very good romp. Fun seek and find with intriguing logic puzzles. I would recommend this game to anyone. Try it and you will like it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was very well planned and thought out. The strategic planning of katniss and peta falling in love was brilliant. I can't wait for the next book. One thing I didn't like was the first person perspective because you knew she wasn't going to die because if she did there would be no book. However this did allow me to get to know the characters better and how the felt throughout the games.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It only shows a few updates. It will not scroll down to see more updates and the pics do not load properly.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|love the gritty sound of his voice.. makes a relaxing night listenening to hiss bluesy soulful sound. can not miss with this albumn
B0060D123K|4.0|Some of the parts of the movie were cut.  I didn't mind that, if there had been a warning that the movie was not sold in its entirety.  With that said, we don't want to give a bad rating to the movie because it's one of our classic favorites.
B005HSL626|5.0|At FREE this app couldn't be a better deal! I love this lil game because my 5 year old can play it & she loves it! I find my self occasionally punching on it to play a quick game when I'm taking a break from house work or when Im riding the bus to work! It's easy & fun. FUN, EASY, & FREE doesnt get much better! :)
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I love this game. Its fun, quirky, the art design in it is great and the gameplay is intuitive and addictive once you get used to it.
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Super easy to navigate.  Anyone wanting to link with other people or organizations within your industry needs this app today.
B003K16P3M|5.0|Picked this book when I saw it was recommended on several sites. Completely fell in love!! Great, exciting book for anyone!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The book was wonderful.<br />I give it five stars, I actually understood everything.<br />It's as need to read! Touching book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is worth the money. amazing and fun minecraft is one of my brothers and sisters favorites. and also there is a reason why it is #1. amazing game and worth the money!
B005LAIIPS|4.0|This was a good movie and the acting and action were well done.  The big issue here that kept this movie from being a 5 star film was that it took well over an hour to set up the plot in the story line and the film was too long as a result.  The premise of the movie was very good and it contained enough sub plots that this movie had a great potential.  We gain insight into the reasons Jason Bourne seemed to be super human but there is too much detail into the government's cover-up of the technology.<br /><br /> My wife and I still liked the movie but it just developed too slowly and it took too long to get to the plot in the storyline.  The action scenes and the acting make the movie worth watching but it just doesn't provide the fast paced continuous action that the first three movies had.<br /><br />If you like the Bourne stories then you should watch it as it does provide interesting insight into the program that created Jason Bourne.  I rate this movie as 4 stars.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|This book was so interesting, and yet so sad. It's tragic what happened to this young girl. Her story is one to never forget
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This was the first app that I downloaded.  Problem I had was the News feed was good for approximately 20 posts.  After that the posts were over a gray background with no photos included.  After about 10 of these, my news feed ends.  Quite disappointing.  I removed the app.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|This is some of the most innovative, thoughtful indie music I've heard in the last several years. The lyrics are original and odd, yet interesting. The music is engaging and ranges from beginning to end. I rarely buy albums in their entirety. This is worth it.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Zep could put out a disc of static and I would buy it. Voice unmatched,I am a guitar player and Page skills unmatched. Drums, do I need to explain. Junior fills in nicely . J.P.J. brought way more to table than most realized.
1451695195|5.0|My husband wanted this book for Christmas and he loved it.  I came right away and I was happy with it
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2MPDG7JK8VXMY]]This is a USB 3.0 to Ethernet convertor that installs quickly and easily.  It can be used on a USB 1.1, 2.0 or 3.0 USB port and will output Ethernet at 10/100/1000 Mbps speeds.  To use 1000 Mbps speeds you have to use an USB 3.0 port. This is an excellent troubleshooting tool to see if your existing Ethernet port is working properly.  If it is not then you can add a new port with this device and avoid expensive repair and parts cost of fixing your laptop or your desktop computer.  If you just need another outlet port to drive a printer and you don't want to use an Ethernet hub then you can also use this device to print via the Ethernet to the printer while the Ethernet port of your laptop is connected to the web.<br /><br />This device installed quickly and easily on my laptop and I have included a brief video of the device features and on the ease of installation.  This port works with Windows, Mac and Linux 1.2.0 operating systems. I did not follow the instructions in the user manual as I plugged in the Ethernet port adapter and when Windows asked me to install the driver disk I did and the drivers were automatically installed. My video shows this process being done on Windows Vista 64.<br /><br />I rated this product 5 stars as it was easy to install, reasonably priced and performed as specified. I was provided a sample for test and evaluation and I promised to provide a fair and honest review.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I first saw this concert on PBS. I was literally moved to tears by Alfie Boe's rendition of Bring Him Home. I liked that this cast takes you through the story through music. It has made me into a die hard Les Miserable die hard fan!
B00338QENI|5.0|This a truly fascinating story about a woman who has impacted my life and yours....yet I had never even heard her name before coming across this book!

B009MCRHH6|4.0|It's a fun and challenging game. Keeps you thinking. I'm not sure how many times one would play it after completing it once or twice, but an entertaining game none the less.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|Loreena's beautiful voice and wonderful interpretations of Christmas music will make a great addition to anyone's collection.  I did good with this gift for my wife!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|the first book left me screaming at the end in suspence waiting for the next to come out... the second book the same..this 3rd book was an excellent read always wanting to turn the next page to see what happens next.. this one will anwser all the mysteries except 1.. Come on guys we are waiting! I loved these books so much i have shared them and hooked 2 of my friends
B0039UTDFG|5.0|I would not expect more from the creators of the Series &#34;Planet Earth&#34;. This Series are great. Oprah Winfrey does a good job as the narrator.<br />Some scene changes are a little too dry and unexpected, but overall the whole series are an amazing visual experience. Perfect to watch it with the family.
B001I0T92Q|5.0|I got this for extra storage space on my modded PSP. It works very well but took forever to get to my home. It runs fast and does not suffer from lag. When the MircoSDs are inserted, the card has to be formatted.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|This device is included with the Kindle - I should haved ordered the AC charger instead. My mistake. May keep it as a spare.
B005LAII94|5.0|Great movie, i will recommended. It was expectacular and very exhiting.  Salma Hayek best performance ever.  She potrait as a very powerful charcter.

0062082353|1.0|No seriously this book is just one big ego trip. Are all Navy seals like this guy? Don't waste your money on this book.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Jodi Picault always finds a way to create a twist at the end of her books, and that is true here too.  Although the premise is a very dark one, she explores the feelings of her characters in depth and allows the reader to determine what motivtion there really could be, in a situation as disturbing as this one.  Was hard to put down, and a bit of light shines at the end that was satisfying.
B005XZHQKY|5.0|Fabulous photography.  A must to have for any 3d collection!!  Wish there were more like this!!  Will purchase as soon as I find some
B0043ZDFEQ|5.0|I play this ablem all the time on my Droid phone & like listening to it while I'm at work.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|I love this show! The CDs are in excillan condition. I'm glad I got the UK edition, though I didn't really notice much difference from the Masterpiece version. Either way, I would recommend this show to anyone!

6305754977|5.0|The movie was band new as described. It has always been one of my favorite John Wayne movie. I play it it a lot.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I liked the first movie better than the second; and now, the third is the best of all.  It is a mind boggling achievement in comic book film making.
B0098VYKSA|3.0|Typical Snow White movie. Got a little boring in the end.  But we all know the ending.  So wouldn't rush out to buy it.
B000AP04L0|5.0|I love this pre 21st century movie. The CD came in good condition which is all one can ask for in a product that one has already watched several times before. Good stuff.
0307346617|5.0|As much as I enjoy reading when I sit down and do it, I'm so easily distracted that it can take me months or longer to finish a book. Not so with World War Z! I couldn't put it down. The theme, the scope of the story, and the episodic approach kept me hooked. Definitely recommended to anyone interested in either a zombie apocalypse or just horror-themed novels.
075669812X|5.0|For every 10 year old Lego collector. Caution, mine looked thru here to add to his list for Christmas.  Great pricev& fast shipping. Thanks!

B009WO7NQO|5.0|Very entertaining, my kids age 4 and 6 love playing this game on my kindle. Would highly recommend for all ages.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|Great book for reminders on how to start & stay in a conversation. Positive thoughts & positive actions equals positive connections.
B000002VCB|5.0|The CD is in excellent condition. This is a walk down memory lane for me. It's been great to listen to this old goodie again. I was glad it was available for purchase.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I can download Kindle ebooks to my tablet now instead of having to use my Kindle Fire all the time.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Great game to play on the kindle! Passes the time and isn't like all the other boring games like cityville and such. So much fun!
B00984668E|4.0|This band does a great job mixing the feeling of good stoner/sludge meets 70`s rock bands ala Zeppelin. I liked a little more their previous effort, but this album is excellent.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|We do have to pull him off it after a while. It requires some patience waiting for the dragons to hatch. There is some pressure to speed up the process by purchasing eggs and baubles. We've resisted pretty easily so far. It seems like kid-friendly, good, clean fun.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I am enjoying the jewels star game.  It is very much like bejewel blitz It is fun and entertaining. I like it.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|I recently watched this movie in preparation for the just released Les Miserables (which Tom Hopper directed) and I enjoyed it very much!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is very entertaining and enjoyable. It provides hours of fun. I love playing the different games and unlocking new ones. Never boring.
B0031RS4UM|5.0|fast paced, story line kept you interested and thinking . !!!!  Jack Reacher is not to be taken lightly, qirky at times , Very intelligent. I wouldn't like to get on his bad side,
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app for kindle fire is terrible. You should be ashamed. It's better going to the website than using the app.
B009VB7P6G|4.0|My daughter loved watching this movie!  It was so touching and sweet.  It really was a great movie about sisterhood and those unbreakable bonds of family.  I would recommend it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is a roller coaster of emotions, both good, bad and ugly. Falling in love with Holder and Sky was a ride from the beginning, you know it will be scary, but can't wait to do it again and again and again!!!  Read this book, fantastic doesn't begin to describe it!
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|I have the other Seasons 1 & 2 so to see a recap was not too exciting for me. Thought that there would be more on a recap but it was more of a teaser to me than actually seeing a little something about Season 3.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Useful in a tight situation.  You wouldn't want to control the desktop too often through a phone, but very handy when you need to!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am a huge fan of Grisham's books and I enjoyed this thoroughly, from the very first word to the last. It was intriguing, suspenseful and a page turner, I didn't want to put it down. One of his best work.
B006H5120E|5.0|My granddaughter loved it. She is totally infatuated with it. Beautiful in the 3<br />D I would reccommend it to everyone
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great read, fast paced, interesting and thoroughly engrossing.  Would work great for a terrific action movie.  One of Grisham's best.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was so invested in this book that I couldn't help sharing with my husband and than  he was so invested he was continually asking what happened. You find yourself loving and hating the characters in this book. You will root for them one minute and want to kill them the next. Just as you think you know what is happening you discover you are wrong.
B004J4X32U|5.0|I purchased this book because of some concerns regarding my 7 year old grandson.  I found the book so reassuring.  The information is applicable and the format allows one to share content - even with the 7 year old.  Examples and strategies for use of the material are abundant.  I believe this book would prove helpful to all parents, grandparents, teachers, etc..  I have recommended it to both my children and their spouses.
B005HSL626|5.0|I don't know why every one is complaining about the adds. I mean just get over it. I love the game and I really don't see how you cant. l mean your sliceing and diceing fruit. what is more fun then that
B007N9FKCY|4.0|Just started playing this app and now i am totally addicted! It takes a bit to get used to the controls because they are so simple. Once you get the hang of it though its really easy. You play a jumping bean that has to collect gems through different stages. Its really fun and hard to put down.  2 thumbs up!
098555780X|5.0|My son loves making things and I thought this would be the perfect gift for him.  He is making different ties and even thinking about selling them! lol
034580404X|5.0|It was hard for me to get into the first book but then I raced through them once it caught my attention... If I were 20 years younger it may have been a great marital aid...haha
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I enjoyed the movie, &#34;The Dark Knight Rises&#34; very much. The story and plot was interesting to watch with intertwining stories & adventures including the other 2 movies too. I live in Pittsburgh where story was partially filmed, so we knew some of the streets & scenes in the movie including Heinz Field & Carnegie Mellon University.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|My husbands favorite Christmas movie.  So glad you had it.  Received it in a short amount of time and have watched it over and over.  Very happy
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I mean I believe in Christ and the Bible but I don't like how you have to be connected to wifi.and the only way you can get books is to sign up and that is a pain in the butt. I would highly recommend getting off of the kindle book store for free
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I had some trouble with this one while on a trip to Houston.  Couldn't get the app to function.  It was okay when I got home.
B002N5N4MG|4.0|For some reason out of all the seasons of BBT on bluray this season only has DVD quality audio. Seasons 1,2,4, and 5 all have DTSHD audio but this one only has Dolby Digital. Granted that is far from bad audio but what's with the discrepancy? I doubt it will keep me from enjoying the show but I do feel kinda ripped off here. Just thought I should let other consumers know.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|Cassia has managed to get herself assigned to a work detail nearer to where Ky is in her quest to get to him.  The chapters still alternate between Cassia, Xander and Ky, tracking where they are and what they are doing.  Xander gets less of a focus in this book than in the other two, as we are most focused on Cassia's plan to find Ky.<br /><br />In this book we get to find out a bit more about how the Society works, how the red, blue and green pill tablets work and what is beyond the walls of the Society.  Cassia is torn between Xander, her best friend from childhood and her Match for marriage by the Society and Ky, a boy who moved into their district as a child to take the place of his cousin who died in an attack from an Aberration but who is classed as an Anomaly due to actions made by his parents and will never be given a Match or a high job in Society.  In the first book Cassia and Xander went to their Matching ceremony and were given each other as Matches, but when Cassia later views her microcard both Xander and Ky show up on it causing her to wonder about them both.  For years she has chafed a bit at the rules placed upon them by society and now she does so even more.  Especially after Ky is taken away.<br /><br />Working in the work camps is a punishment for infractions and comes with the likely penalty that one will die before making it back into society.  Cassia takes this risk to find Ky and ends up on  a journey through  the desert away from all she has ever known and finding out more about the Pilot she has heard whispers of for years.<br /><br />In the desert she learns about people who have lived outside of society and how they have survived and lived.  She meets people who lived in different districts and finds out about thwarted love, sees firsthand the destruction the Society deals out to both human and natural elements who live outside their walls, and finds out that there is a Rising movement who wants to take over .  Again Cassia is torn between people and actions.  This books sets things up very well for the last installment in the series.n people and actions.  This books sets things up very well for the last installment in the series.
B003719G40|5.0|I feel so much more informed after reading this book. I feel like I understand myself and my partner more. Thank you, Dr. Chapman!!!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I work all kinds of crazy shifts at the hospital. Perfect for multiple alarms and it doesn't wake my wife
B000065U1N|4.0|This DVD is so brutal that neither my husband (a Navy Korea war<br />veteran) nor I could bear to watch it.<br />Seeing the determination , bravery, and sacrifices of these great men<br />makes me nauseous when I think how fruitless it all was.<br />Obama and the liberals enjoy the fruits, while showing no respect nor<br />support for our great men and women who have served and given the<br />ultimate sacrifice.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It is what i expected..i wish the had a faster refresh rate though..and it does tend to lock up. Otherwise not bad
B005OK721G|4.0|we had to see the same night that the movie came ....we love Zoe  in the movie ...she was great
B009VSW15Y|3.0|The camera is ok, but very difficult to use seeing the camera only points at the person looking at the kindle...
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Moral: listen to your children. Fantastic!!! Inspires one to do better and live with kindness in your heart. Every child and adult should read this. Should be a mandatory read for middle schoolers.
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|I'm hoping that it is just user error, but all the glasses that we cut ended up breaking, and not where they were suppose to.  I'm willing to give it a try again, but right now am very frustrated with 16 broken bottles.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|good funny humor. there were a few laugh out loud parts. overall enjoyed it. It's not heavy mental viewing either.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|not as good as the original movie.  they cut the mars out of the story.  kinda pointless.  colin farrel was good in the movie but the rest of it sucked.
B002ZG999U|4.0|loved  the movie...love seeing all actors.. invite friends and they also loved can can wait to part 2.  thank u
B004P7CNUY|5.0|ok I know  I been giving 5 stars  but it kick butt movie even thought the specail edition shows  more<br /><br />I bought this dvd because I could adford it.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The music is beautiful, emotional and dramatic.  The vocal performances by all the cast members are outstanding! The stories seems to come to life through the songs.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Is this movie sappy? Well, yes. Yes it is. Is it still a great movie? Again, yes. Yes it is. I'm not even a Christian, and therefore don't celebrate Christmas, but I still watch this movie every year on December 25th. Why? Because it's fun! It's fun, and it has a great message behind it. So, I suggest you introduce your kids to this movie, if you have any, they'll love it!
B007SGM084|5.0|Well written easy reads about relationships and how they can evolve even if there are &#34;skeletons in the closet&#34;. The character development is superb and the story of how two people can interact and each become better is encouraging in this day and age
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Very useful tool for accessing files on local storage and network shares! This tool is one of my favorites! Must have.
1401307957|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK!!!!!  I bought the book either for school or as a reference.  Its good.  I can't believe they require a minimum amount of words.  Crazy.  They want an opinion and then ask for so many words.  What are they nuts!
B00009TB5G|5.0|This one is best of them all  with the tree people and the two Hobbits  it lovely collection too the Lords Of the Rings
140053271X|3.0|I tried several times to set up my account but kept getting an error.  I finally had to go online to set up my account.  Also, I don't see how to set parental controls.  I should have done my homework before purchasing.<br /><br />Also, I don't like how the screen transitions from one screen to the next.  It seems to jump around.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|lovely story and also good background music<br />arrived quick and in great condition<br />if you love the beatles but love a good story you'll love this
0684824906|5.0|Absorbing, wonderful, detailed and rich with anecdotes and source material.  Really makes you love Lincoln if you didn't before.  Sorry for it to end.
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|There is a fairly decent mix of jazz to choose from.  I find more channels here that I like than others I have tried.  But since it playlist is by categories you can't get to a specific artist which is probably its only downside.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|He is so talented! Every song is awesome. Its nice to see someone come off the show and actually do something and succeed!
B00005JMFQ|5.0|My husband and I watch this movie every year around Christmas time. It's hilarious and warms the heart of the season.
161218412X|5.0|My daughter loved this beautiful set of books! She received them as a Christmas gift and has them proudly displayed in her room.
B0063IH60K|5.0|My husband and I enjoy playing this game and will be using it.  Very good graphics since this is being used on a kindle
B00A7CI82I|4.0|started slow, fast midle - action packed - then fizzled at the end-  Left you wanting more, like a sequel maybe?
B005LAIGYQ|4.0|Bought it for my teenage son. He liked all the military equipment and weapons.  I found the story a bit hard to follow.  The group of SEALs were hard to distinguish from each other when dressed in helmets and armor, so it was hard to know who was doing what, and they were chasing at least 2 different bad guys in several different locations, and they each had their own minions, so it was difficult to keep up with who was who, and who was doing what.  When the &#34;act of valor&#34; happens, and there's no lead up to it, so you kind of ignore it as just part of the movie.  When it was over, I thought &#34;what was the act of valor&#34;?  &#34;Oh yeah, it was when...&#34;  Good if you like military &#34;stuff&#34;, the military equipment used was amazing, not so much if you actually want a good story.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|I use Dropbox on my iPhone & wanted it for my Kindle Fire HD which was given to me for Xmas.<br /><br />The download was difficult to find & didn't work when purchased thru Amazon.  I had to find another source.  However, this was Amazon's fault.<br /><br />I (finally) successfully downloaded it & works great on the Kindle.  It even has its own built-in text editing plug-in which the iPhone version didn't have.<br /><br />I'm returning the Kindle (hate it), but Dropbox has proven to be a great app regardless of the platform running it.<br /><br />I plan on using Dropbox on my next tablet.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|So ikaruga was a good game... but chu chu rocket was the best game released on the sega dreamcast.  It's awesome that the port was made to mobile.  I believe chu chu rocket was the first console game in north America to have PvP over a network. It is the grand-daddy of console multiplayer.
B0083TXXZ4|4.0|This gun was part of our NERF/Koosh theme for Christmas this year. Everyone (all ages) got a weapon. I thought this one would be the favorite but surprisingly, it wasn't. It jammed quite often so the Koosh ball launcher won the battle.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|A great show that is not one-dimensional. This show is written with a good storyline behind it, unlike most TV shows.<br /><br />I read some reviews regarding this first season and feel that people are lazy to give it a chance, or simple minded to understand the depth of it. This show is not written for the simple minded or lazy.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I had forgotten how great this movie is and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys musicals.  The service was very prompt and the merchandise exactly as advertised.  Good Seller.  Would recommend to others.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Ted rocks. There must be a sequel in the making !  The unrated version was definitely not as desirable for small children, a few scenes required parental explanation or a simple &#34;just forget that part&#34; statement. Good quality for a great price
B009RI4FRU|4.0|There are some things you can just count on in this world, and getting a layered film from Wes Anderson is one of them.  A great family film too, with themes for all to appreciate.
0345803493|5.0|Great story continues.....I can't put this book down!  Some of the S&M stuff is way overboard but if you can get past that you will enjoy the book.
1449433251|5.0|My kids and I bought this for my husband for Christmas, as he has been a life-long Calvin and Hobbes fan. We weren't really clear on what it would contain, whether it was just the books reprinted, only the newspaper cartoons, we had no idea. He started looking through it and was thrilled to see some of Bill Watterson's work from college and items he tried to get submitted, when he was first starting out as a cartoonist. My husband is having a blast looking at these books and they will be well read and treasured for many years to come.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|A fun game to play and it kept my interest. I would buy a game by these guys again. Not recommended for littler kids though...might be a bit scary.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|Got this for my new Kindle Fire - always wanted to learn how to play something besides Chopsticks or Heart & Soul. Been trying hard to keep up - currently have a sprained wrist. Will more than likely upgrade to the next level once I've worn this one out! Like how the keys have their 'names'; middle c, etc. so when I sit down with a real piano, I won't be totally clueless. Highly recommend this!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I purchased Seasons One, Two, and Three and remembered how much I adored this television series; Amazon offered a &#34;couldn't pass it up&#34; deal on the entire series--all seven seasons--so now I have Seasons One, Two, Three, and the Complete Series to watch over and over and over again.  DVDs are in excellent shape; quality is exceptional; thank you Amazon.com
B004BBDHEK|5.0|Christmas present was greatly loved! GREAT PRICE AND SERVICE!<br /><br />i WOULD ORDER AGAIN IN THE FUTURE......LOVE THE CONVENIENCES OF ONLINE SHOPPING
0345803485|5.0|I can't put this book down!  Some of the S&M stuff is way overboard but if you can get past that you will enjoy the book.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This is the perfect next step for lovers of bridge building games. The game has extremely creative physics and level designs.
B000006MS3|5.0|I can't add much to these great reviews: it's all true, and then some. (I adored it then, & when i hear it now, i realize just how high she set the bar.) So i just want to emphasize two points.<br />A. \\"produced by Kate Bush\\"-that's huge. That's like a bodyslam to most other female artists, as well as most other male artists. It's why Kate is Queen with a huge eclipsing shadow.<br /><br />B. As an album experience, it's best to sit through the whole thing, so you can latch on to what you like,& endure what you find challenging. With each listen, the lighter become complex, the darker songs become accessible, and in a month a different song starts to be what you savor. So this isn't about immediate gratification of some flavors you already like; it's more like furiously browsing through a library or museum with desperate, heartpalpitating curiosity.<br />If you love daring originality- arranged skillfully as pop/rock, -this is THE masterpiece.<br />( it's okay to say \\"genius\\" & \\"masterpiece\\" about The Dreaming. It's why those words were created.)<br />So... I'll submit some of my favorite aspects to listen for; a.)the rhythmic whiplike whoosh sound in the SatinYrLap. b.)\\"Wont-Letcha-In\\"- kinda Amityville-like in GetOutamyHouse. c.) The sheep in Dreamtime. d.)The dark chord/tone that fades out like dusk under the first verse of Nite/Swallow (post-U pipes). & e.) the John Bonham-y drum fill late into Leave/Open.
0061120073|5.0|I first read this when I was 11, or rather, it was read to me. I read it over and over all through my teen/college years, since the story follows the main character through all those years. Certain pivotal experiences are still the same. Also a great piece of historical fiction to learn about immigrants, boss politics, urban slums and expansion in the late 1800s/early 1900s. And it says a lot about poverty.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This was a purchase on my Kindle; immediate &#34;whisper&#34; delivery; could not be more satisfied with my Kindle (just a plain, ordinary Kindle--yes, I am an avid reader--I wanted an e-book).  LOVE my Kindle!

B005K0HDGE|4.0|Mr king doesn't disappoint. I kept wondering where he would go with the details around time travel. I highly recommend this book!
B0087JTAKW|4.0|It took me a while to get into this book, but after awhile I wanted to know more about the timekeeper and really enjoyed it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a purchase on my Kindle; immediate &#34;whisper&#34; delivery; could not be more satisfied with my Kindle (just a plain, ordinary Kindle--yes, I am an avid reader--I wanted an e-book).  LOVE my Kindle!
B008HTQ28K|3.0|John Grishams latest story will no doubt become another bestseller. Like his previous works of fiction &#34;The Racketeer&#34; is a fast flowing, entertaining, with unexpected twist and turns. The plot is at times however slightly far fetched. This book is a light read, a good relaxant, a tonic, whilst  preparing for a good nights rest, or whilst enjoying the Christmas holidays.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Thjiss book was fun and easy to read.  Worth the time and money for an enjoyable time.  Take a chance.
B005HSL626|1.0|It tells you that it isca free app, and once its downloaded it won't work because it's not free. Do not waste your time or the space on your device.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Shipped fast. Quality was amazing. Price was good. I am very pleased with the service and will let my friends know bout it as well
B003VR5PPY|2.0|I really don't see the point with all the outrageous language...and I've \\"played\\" this game for 2 hours now and the only interaction you really get to have is clicking the screen frequently to scroll down more reading...If I wanted to read, I would pick up a book
B0015DROBO|5.0|This was a purchase on my Kindle; immediate &#34;whisper&#34; delivery; could not be more satisfied with my Kindle (just a plain, ordinary Kindle--yes, I am an avid reader--I wanted an e-book).  LOVE my Kindle!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|I streamed it via Roku. Great movie. When is amazon going to provide close caption options in this platform. It seems discriminatory to me that they will not provide such a service for the hearing impaired.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My sister got me hooked on this show.  Love the writing and polish of the cast.  Check it out, you wont me disappointed!
B00280LYIC|5.0|This book was really good and I read it in only 2 days! AMAZING BOOK. GO Percy Jackson YOU GO!!!!!!!
B008IYR2BA|3.0|Not as good as previous seasons, took a long time to get going and the villains were not sinister enough e.g when compared with the superb John Lithgow
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I gave angry birds a 5 star rating because it is quite fun to play, and rather addictive after while. It is also free to download which is nice also, I would recommend this game to anyone who wants some free fun :) .
B0000AM6IY|5.0|One of our family's all-time favorites; was on the Black Friday Special Deal list; couldn't pass it by; delivery was timely and the condition of the DVD is excellent--we will enjoy this for years to come.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|It was great had so much. My grandson loved it.there were DVD s that had'nt been seen before and games ,over all it was money well spent
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This book was incredibly simple. Also incredibly seductive and mouth watering. I had such a hard time putting it down!
B004EPYZUS|5.0|What can I say. Tom is back in a big way. Back on the screen where he belongs. Truly a Movie Star in the grand tradition but one with acting chops. Must See.....
1423140605|5.0|This was bought for my 13 year old son.  He's been waiting a long time for book 3.  He really enjoyed the story and would recommend it to anyone who has read the first 2 in this series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I can't wait to read the  next one! I got hooked right away and couldn't put the book down. Very easy to read.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|The shipping was timely--less than two days--was part of the Black Friday Special Deals; this is an all-time favorite movie of our family--couldn't pass up the special.  The DVD not only arrived quickly, but the DVD is in excellent condition.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|I really enjoyed this game I like playing this mystery point find and solve games especially like this one being a Tesla fan too.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love this book. It had me on pins and needles until I finished it. I can't wait for the next book!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|great game - fun for kids too.  keeps you thinking - great, great, great, great, great, great, great great game.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Christmas gift for daughter.  Great album.  Listened to it on long car trip.  Good for all ages to listen to.
0783229364|4.0|Since I am rather picky about the movies I like with Michael J. Fox in it, I knew I wanted to buy this because it is funny and it shows Michael as a good family man.
B008BO61BE|5.0|My only complaint is that they cut the footage that was included in the Showtime special that shows a fan on stage grabbing Rob Halford from behind and roadies having to pry him off of him.  Once he's freed, Rob begins to laugh. That happened when they were saying goodbye to the crowd. I guess I'm gonna have to edit that into the concert using video editing software.
B00A17AD36|3.0|Pretty good album, I would not have paid more than $4 for it though. He is a little too whiney. i do however like his rendition of Dirty Diana.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love the books, great read, I have read it twice in a month. I have read all 3 twice, and will probably read them many more times.
B004DTXJ4S|5.0|Milla Jovovich was awesome as always. Looking forward too number six....I am amazes how they can make a series with all 5 hits..
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Bought this for my daughter as a Christmas gift.  Adele has a wonderful voice and there were a lot of recognizable songs.
B002E0JL4A|4.0|Patch Adams is one of the few movies I laugh at ever time I watch it. I say that because Robin Williams is so funny!!!
B004KKXMSI|5.0|I loved Jurassic Park when it first came out and I still love it to this day. Watching it on Blu-ray makes it even more exciting. The picture quality is great and I'm so glad that all of the movies are the theater releases- in other words, no extra stuff was added in to change the movies :). But there are bonus features that you can choose to watch separately from the trilogy. A definite recommend to JP fans and anybody that just loves adventurous, action flicks! It's rated PG but I think parents should be aware that there is quite a bit of killing that happens so watch it before you let your little ones see it.
B007SGM084|1.0|All the hoopla surrounding Fifty Shades of Grey caught up with me so I relented and purchased the trilogy. I have been unable to finish the first book, much less even open the other two.<br /><br />I found this book to be sophomorically written, and hard to read without  rolling my eyeballs at the pure silliness. I wish I would have only purchased the first of the series and spent the $20 on something more entertaining.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love the books, great read, I have read it twice in a month.  Will probably read it many more times
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Saw this with my husband when it came out in the theaters. We both loved it!  Received it for Christmas, and we both loved it just as much the second time as the first!!  The art is amazing....animations have really come a LONG way since I was a child!!!  The story line is wonderful, a bit of faerie tale, a growing up tale, a lesson in listening and in following your heart...no mater if you are a girl or boy, you can be whatever you have a mind to be.  The humor is wonderful.......I cant recommend this movie too much...it is a must see!!!
B001P06GX4|1.0|I'm so upset over this purchase! I bought what I thought (and what was advertised in the Amazon description) as the Blokus Classics Game by Mattel. It shipped promptly and because I buy so many things on amazon and rarely have issues, I didn't open it up and went ahead and wrapped it up for Christmas (three or so weeks before the holiday). Imagine our surprise and utter disappointment when we unwrapped this gift on Christmas morning and it was actually a game called \\"Family Strategy Game\\" manufactured in China with a flimsy, cheap gameboard, instructions ONLY in Chinese and clearly is a knock-off brand of the Blokus game (plus, it is missing an entire set of colored pieces). I am so angry that what was clearly shown as the REAL Blokus Game in the Amazon description was filled and sent with a cheap, generic game. Furthermore, after I contacted Amazon for a return, I received an email that I could return the game but I would have to cover the cost of return shipping, which I found out would be about half the cost of what I paid. I have had really great experiences with Amazon in the past, but this particular Amazon seller should be ashamed to be selling something under false pretenses. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER! If I were you, I wouldn't risk getting a cheap imitation.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved it!  An easy read with a smooth and dreamy storyline! I found it much more captivating then the 50shades trilogy.
B003F3PMYI|4.0|Selective attention seems to be key to this approach. One could just as easily have written and done the science on the other side of the coin. So the real academic would probably have focused more on transitioning from a negative mindset to a positive one rather than just selling the positive one. Fake it till you make it does not seem to be very genuine. Being real and feeling others pain can be just as constructive in healing.Still, I consider this an important step in making for a better society.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is fun and chalengeing so when you finish it you feel  proud and Like yous acheved somthing<br /><br />So if you want a fun puzzler get thiz app
B009XHAM8G|4.0|I am a mother of 3 boys and I cried while reading this to my boys the first time!! I love my boys!!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Received as a Christmas gift.  Had heard it compared to Aliens,  but realized when I watched it that it is the origin of Aliens (I love the Alien movies)  I found this movie to be interesting, good acting, good visuals, Exciting,  a very good movie!!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I had really great fun and it was with this free app, i was always wondering if it would be worth the buy and now that i had a chance to tried it out i know i will be having fun with any future apps.
B009O2XY12|5.0|Bubble mania has had my attention for so many hours! Its fun, adorable graphics, and it has a way to keep glued to the game for hours.
B008YWY0HK|2.0|I expected a lot more after seeing the trailer. Unfortunately, if you've seen the trailer (ie. the arrow split in two in the bullseye), you've already seen the best parts of the movie. The first 20 minutes or so were very good but then it devolved into unexciting nonsense. I'd say it may be better for small kids but they might be frightened by the vicious bear attacks.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|plus this download came with Uprising and some additional dub mixes that I hadn't heard before.  A great addition to any music library and a must have for any real reggae fan.

B0091LS07E|3.0|After 2009's somewhat disappointing The Element of Freedom, Alicia Keys is back with her fifth studio album Girl On Fire. With As I Am it seemed as if Alicia Keys had improved on her already beautiful sound, but with The Element of Freedom it felt like she took a few steps back. Not just in comparison to As I Am, but in comparison to her earlier works as well. Sadly with Girl On Fire we continue to see Ms. Keys go in the wrong direction.<br /><br />When the album's piano filled intro \\"De Novo Adagio\\" came on my first thought was: great. Her original three albums all started off with a piano intro, but The Element of Freedom didn't. So in my mind this was Alicia Keys maybe, hopefully, returning to the sound that I originally loved from her. Unfortunately it leads into \\"Brand New Me\\" which lacks any sort of energy whatsoever. All I can say is she states \\"Don't be mad, it's just brand new kind of me.\\" So you can either accept these new changes or move on with your life.<br /><br />What exactly is wrong with this album though? In short it lacks passion. I don't listen to many female artists because a lot of the music is generic and forgettable, but with Alicia it's always been different. Sure she was never the best songwriter, many reviewers saying she uses a lot of cliches in her lyrics, but it was the amount of heart and soul that she put into each lyric that made her music great. She was able to make you feel something. Sadly the only thing I truly felt on here was bored.<br /><br />Not only that but she seems to have lost that soul element in her music. Her first three albums, especially Songs In A Minor, all had a very soulful approach to the R&B format. From the way she said her lyrics to the style of production, it was something extremely different from your run-of-the-mill R&B artist. Girl On Fire on the other hand doesn't really do anything new and seems to fall victim to conformity.<br /><br />Production wise this album is nothing special. As I said this albumsounds like it's conforming to what's out at the moment and most of that has to do with the production. Now I'm a bass guy. I love some good bass when it's used properly. With that said, the bass present on Girl On Fire feels very out of place and awkward. It's not like Alicia Keys has never had songs with bass before, but it just didn't seem to work on here and wound up ruining the overall sound of the album. Where this album shines is when the production mostly consists of a piano and a very simple, low-tempo, bass line.<br /><br />Finally, the guests Ms. Keys decided to recruit for this album are awful. We all know who Nicki Minaj is because, unfortunately, the talentless transvestite is a househould name. However, I wasn't familiar with Maxwell until I heard him on track seven \\"Fire We Make\\". The song serves as Girl On Fire's \\"sexy\\" song which is territory Alicia Keys hasn't really touched on much throughout her eleven year career. So it was kind of interesting to hear something like this from Ms. Keys, but Maxwell.... eh. His voice is so generic, forgettable, and forced I just found it hard to enjoy the song.<br /><br />Standout Songs: \\"When It's All Over\\" & \\"One Thing\\"<br /><br />Overall Score: 6/10 - Bottom line this album just didn't do what I wanted it to. After The Element of Freedom I wanted this to make me fall back in love with Ms. Keys, but Girl On Fire lacks some major elements that made her first three albums so enjoyable. If you're a fan of Alicia Keys I would still recommend giving this a listen. Her voice is still as beautiful as ever, even if it's lacking some of the passion.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This film has so much fun and whimsy that gets the kids giggling and more mature humor to keep the parents entertained. Truly a new holiday classic.

B00A8ECU24|4.0|It is fun, but the mini games get kind of boring after a while and you have to keep an eye on how many gems you use, because you don't get many through the game.  I've also had trouble finding other people to play with.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Another book by Ms. Colleen that had me up all night just to get to the next chapter and the chapter after that until I find myself still reading at 5 in the morning!  I couldn't find the right time to have a \\"chapter break\\" this book is that AWESOME that I pushed my eyes to keep reading until my super heavy eyelids tricked me and took a long blink!!!!! After my eyes finally opened from what I thought was just a blink I picked up my kindle and started reading where I left off until I read the words THE END. This book will not disappoint...no need to think twice just read this book already!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|just keep playing to get prizes to unlock other games. Love playing and would say give it a try then you be hooked too.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This was a great story.  I give books good enough for a second (or third) reading 5 stars, and great stories like this one 4 stars.<br /><br />The fascinating part of the book is that we start out like the character does-- knowing nothing.  Things are confusing and a little &#34;off&#34;.<br /><br />We learn together little pieces of information and try to figure out what might be going on.<br /><br />I've read and seen lots of movies along this thread before, and I kept trying to figure out what might be really going on in Pines.  But I guessed wrong, and you will too. ;-)  The story has a wonderful twist for the ending.<br /><br />The last 100 pages, I couldn't put the book down because the action really ramps up there.  It was late at night, and I just could not go to sleep until I finished, finally finding out what is really happening in Pines.  I was not disappointed. ;-)<br /><br />Great book, great story, great ride.  I enjoyed it and hope you will too.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|It is a wonderful flick which would be MUCH better in HD. Hope the next one is as good..we shall see.

B00870ZH3U|3.0|At first, I thought like most others: WTF.  But then, as the story went on, I started realizing something about the \\"conflicts\\" in the characters.<br /><br />By the end of the original musical:<br />Phantom - had been forced to face his own ugliness within.  With that, he found his heart truly open up and he let the one woman who brought him happiness go.  He sacrificed his music for her heart.<br /><br />Christine - had believed that as long as she had music in her life, she would feel loved.  But, she learned that the music is not enough to make your heart fly - she grew up.  In the end, she sacrificed her music for her heart.<br /><br />Raoul - he found himself in a position where he had to become a real man.  His love for Christine forced him to sacrifice himself.  For probably the first time in a viscount's life, he that getting what he wanted wasn't always possible.  He sacrificed his silver spoon world view for her heart.<br /><br />Madame Giry - she saw a form of friendship with the Phantom and was faced with the choice of betrayal.  Did she betray Christine by leaving her to the Phantom?  Or did she betray the Phantom by helping Raoul?  In the end, she sacrificed the Phantom's trust in her for Christine and Raoul's love.<br /><br />Meg - she was a talented dancer on her way to becoming a true talent.  She had no guile, no blemishes on her soul.  She was the opposite of the Phantom - pure innocent beauty.  She had no sacrifice to give.<br /><br />Now, compare to this sequel:<br />Phantom - he was as if his final sacrifice in the original had never happened.  He wasn't the Phantom that phans sympathized with.  He was as if Christine had never been.<br /><br />Christine - she turned back into that flighty little thing that jumped at spiders and couldn't hold a thought in her head.  She was as if the Phantom had never been.<br /><br />Raoul -  he became an arrogant count.  He forgot that making sacrifices for others is just as important as having fun.  He was as if the Phantom had never been.<br /><br />Madame Giry - she looked at the Phantom as if he were a tool to her daughter's success.  He was no longer a friend, but a means to an end.  She was as if the Phantom had never been.<br /><br />Meg - she was caught up in ambition.  She connived and planned.  She tried to usurp Christine's role with the Phantom.  She was willing to kill.  She was as if she had taken the Phantom's ugliness inside her.<br /><br />Why would Lloyd Webber do this?  Why would he take the characters that we all loved and turn them into their worst possibilities?  My guess:  because he could never take this story forward seriously.  Phans would never have let it be.  He would have been tortured forever.  So, turn it into a story of \\"what if the illuminations of the original never happened\\".  Take the characters and place them in the deepest places they might have been if they had not faced their demons in the Opera House and give that to the Phans.<br /><br />I give it three stars for showing me what horrid, unworthy people they could have been.<br /><br />As for the actual performances, I wonder how much control Lloyd Webber had in this casting.  Christine was awful.  Her voice croaked and cracked throughout.  It was shrill more than it was on key.  I kept saying to myself as she sang \\"A toad madame?  Perhaps it is you who are the toad!\\"  There is no way the Phantom of the original musical would have heard that voice and wanted it for his music.  I do wonder, however, if this was done intentionally as a way to capture the real Christine.  Sarah Brightman's voice was at its best while she was with Lloyd Webber - it was true and clear and had wonderful range and yet remained just shy of controlled.<br /><br />After leaving Lloyd Webber, she obviously chose to study further and turned herself into a caricature of the talent that once was.  It seems both Christine and Sarah have turned themselves into Carlottas.<br /><br />Meg's voice left much to be desired also.  But I will allow it with the belief that it is a verbal sign of the loss of her innocence - a few ciggies too many.<br /><br />Phantom's voice couldn't lift spirits if he had a forklift.  But, again, I will allow it with the belief that it is intentional - to take away that which made him beautiful.<br /><br />Raoul's voice was the only one that didn't make me cringe. Perhaps it was an attempt to gain sympathy for him.<br /><br />The songs were OK.  I never felt that pull that I get with the original - that gut wrenching jerk with the first sounds as the chandelier rises; that sense of floating with Music of the Night; that quickening of the heart as we are led to the lair.  This sequel just doesn't have the emotion.  But, when you take the emotional illumination away from the characters, how could it?<br /><br />As an extra thought, there are many reviews that talk about relationships between Phantom and Christine and between Raoul and Christine.  Everyone is certain that their version is the right version.  Having seen the original musical about a dozen times, with two Christines, four Phantoms, and three Raouls, as well as having the original cast recording, I can tell you that those relationships change for each combination.  Each actor plays the Phantom with a different underlying psyche.  Some portray him as a violent monster, some as a stern father figure, others as a lover.  Their chosen psyche and the chemistry between the actors changes the story every time.  As for Raoul, the original Steve Barton was very weak.  He simply could not hold up against a Michael Crawford Phantom.  But take a strong Raoul and put him against a Phantom in despair and you can see Christine choosing Raoul.  It's all in the chemistry and the portrayals.  None is better than the other, it just changes the story a bit.  That's what makes theatre so wonderful.  The only thing that can kill the original is a poor Christine.  If the actress cannot hold her own, the storyloses all hope.
B009NXV2RK|5.0|Amazing to see the old Tom Clancy back in action! Great, fast read with authentic figures and good research to back!
B00AE2J93I|5.0|Loved everything about this movie. The animation, attention to detail and fabulous one-liners! A great movie for kids and grown-up alike. A few possible scary moments for little ones, but still super cute.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I thought this was  a really good book. It was  well written, and I think some kids in high school can relate. Especially the ones like Charlie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I GAVE IT 5 STARS BECAUSE OF ITS GRAPHICS AND HOW SIMPLE AND CLEAR IT IS.  ANYBODY CAN PLAY THIS GAME ONCE YOU LOVE TEMPLE RUN LIKE MYSELF YOU ARE GONNA LOVE SUBWAY SURFERS.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is about falling in love and that the past truly does not matter and should not stop you from living the rest of your life and learn to trust others even if you've been let down in the past.
0316228532|2.0|I think I finally found a book I didn't like, unfortunately. I was somewhat under the impression that JK Rowing's new book was going to be a mystery and it's really not. It's completely unlike anything I've read before, and there seems to be no reason for me to stick with it. I don't like to give a book a negative review. The woman can write, don't get me wrong. Casual Vacancy is just not my cup of tea.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Exciting as always, and I loved the motorcycle chase scene, but the movie is not as good as the previous Bourne movies.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|Enjoyed this campy movie very much.  I've always enjoyed watching Johnny Depp.  This is truly Johnny Depp material in that he gets to act out a supposedly serious character in an amusing way.
7119005901|5.0|I have been seeking to this book for a while. Now that I have gotten far into it, I can honestly say that this is a great book for anyone that has heard about it or just curious about it. It's just great!

B003CSV7TK|5.0|I love this movie and wouldn't have Christmas pass by without watching it. The casting of ALL the characters is perfect, and the acting is first rate. I can't see how any part of this movie could be improved upon.  The best Santa movie ever made.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love the simplicity! It's  similar to the one I use for my Algebra, but bigger... easy to use... and it's free!
B003CRM6QO|5.0|Yes, my Amazon pen name is my little homage to this fantastic movie.  There are so many quotable scenes, one of my favorites being Dale Arden clapping and cheering,\\"Go Flash, go!\\"<br /><br />I was young when the film was released, and I can't even imagine how many times my brother and I watched it, completely enthralled by the action, colors, and images.<br /><br />Now that I'm older, I have a greater appreciation for the story and the acting (though there are hugely varied levels of acting skills on display, no one can deny that every actor is completely enthusiastic.  Finally, the [[ASIN:B005K4HP1I Flash Gordon (Deluxe Edition)]] soundtrack by Queen is incredible; the main theme stays in heavy rotation on my iPod.<br /><br />Last piece of advice, to complete your viewing experience, watch this film while wearing a [[ASIN:B00198LNU8 Flash Gordon Logo Red Ringer White T-Shirt Tee]].
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It has a lots and lots of info to learn about for college and it has things about alpha and all of that kind of crap it is a long book but you should read it.
B004KZDV8E|5.0|Of course intel would always be worth the price. Even if it's a tad bit pricey. But a sale price of 99$ can't be beat! I had a '09 i7. My board fried. So I had to upgrade and that meant I had to upgrde the cpu. But this i3 is fast! The second I hit the power button, windows is already booted and ready to go! No time to get into bios. I dont like to risk overclocking but it is a slight upgrade in some aspecs from an old i7. Still multi tasks well. If you are in a tad bit of an emergency at the moment like I was then get this cpu.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|I've watched this movie every year since I was a child, and I will continue that tradition as an adult. It is so down to earth and hilarious!
B00846REIS|4.0|I was a little hesitant to read these after getting into Shades for fear of being too similar. Although there are similarities, there are enough differences and the characters were so likable that I flew through the first two and am eagerly anticipating the third!
0230749615|5.0|I love this book just like the first one my son now have me read the first Gruffalo book and this one before bed time.
B003UESJHE|5.0|Prince Albert was forced to the British throne following the death of his father and his elder brother's decision to abdicate in order to marry Wallis Simpson.  Albert's (now King George VI) severe stuttering lead to a profound fear of public speaking, which is a bit if its own impediment to a British monarch.  In secret, King George and his wife, Elizabeth (known in her later years as the Queen Mum) hire Australian speech therapist, Lionel Logue.  King George resists Logue's techniques and he rebels against Logue insisting that the two men behave as class equals, something completely foreign to the King, during their therapy sessions.<br /><br />The lead cast is excellent: Colin Firth as the proud but insecure monarch; Geoffrey Rush as his patient, steadfast speech therapist; and Helena Bonham Carter as the King's loving, supportive, and persistent wife.  There are numerous moments of great tension, as we wait to see how King George will perform at various public speeches.  There are also many humorous touches, most notably the surprise meeting between George and Elizabeth and Logue's stunned wife.<br /><br />When I initially heard about \\"The King's Speech,\\" my first thought was: \\"A movie about stuttering?  How can this succeed?\\"  But it does.  The stuttering merely provides the backdrop for the tentative development of the friendship between these two very different men.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|Don't let the funny title or cover fool you.  This is a really good book!  It rediscovers the lost art of using your own body to develop strength and conditioning.  Forget those expensive gym memberships and silly machines that force the body to move in unnatural ways causing more harm than good.  This book will show you how to use your own body to become incredibly strong, and do it in a slow and progressive way so as to build not only muscle strength, but also joint health and tendon strength.  The progressive nature of the exercises is key.  There are six basic movements and ten exercises for each of the movements.  Working in this way develops strength and conditions the body with minimal risk of injury.  Get this book if you are serious about shaping up.

B001Q4Z5Z4|3.0|In the opening credits it states that this is based on [[ASIN:B0038SUBEG Death Race 2000 (Roger Corman's Cult Classics)]]. This reimaging occurs when Jensen Ames and all his co-workers are laid off from their steel mill job which looks suspeciously like Terminal Island.<br /><br />He goes home to his wife.  He showers and comes down stairs to find his wife murdered, the killer points his finger at him like it is a gun as he leaves.  The police show up and he is accused of killing his wife.<br /><br />6 month later he is sent to Terminal Island, it looks like [[ASIN:B000IYXVM2 Escape From Alcatraz]] and [[ASIN:B00004Y87O Escape from New York]]. The female warden calls Ames to her office and tells him if he wins their little race as former race champ Frankenstien he can leave and go be with his daughter.<br /><br />He begrudgingly agrees, the previous Frankenstien died and he wore a mask so nobody will know.  If a prisoner wins 5 races he can go free.  The racers get female navigators, as the movie goes along the amount of people watching increases. The races look like a video game and [[ASIN:0790729342 The Road Warrior]].<br /><br />But, it turns out everybody is lying. Part demolision derby part shoot 'em up, a few clever turning points and an unlikely bond.  Reminds me of [[ASIN:B001EBV0OY The Shawshank Redemption]]. The video store worker who located it for me said \\"Mindless violence.\\" Pretty much.  That was why I got it, Sunday afternoon watching. Standard foul language and bloodshed, I opted for theatrical, no skin at all as I recall.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0038SUBEG Death Race 2000 (Roger Corman's Cult Classics)]] I think is interesting, this is a rehash, on 'roids.

B008RTE08E|4.0|\\"Magical Mystery Tour\\" has gone down as the Beatles' biggest flop, so much so that it was never shown on network TV in the United States until December of 2012. I think this is unduly harsh for a couple of reasons. First off, the music is really good -- \\"I Am the Walrus,\\" \\"Fool on the Hill,\\" and \\"Your Mother Should Know\\" are terrific songs, \\"Blue Jay Way\\" is underrated, and the title song is good too. Second, don't think of it as a rather incoherent story; think of it as a variety show with linking material. Some of it is kind of silly, some a bit surreal, and some downright weird, but there isn't a lot that isn't kind of entertaining on some level. And finally, the digital makeover has helped to make it look more like the Beatles intended it to look before it went out (in black and white!) on the BBC in 1967. It may not be the climax of that year (which, after all, saw the release of the \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" LP and the \\"Penny Lane\\"/\\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" and \\"All You Need Is Love\\" singles), but it's good, (mostly) clean fun and, again, it has some music which has aged WAY better than a lot of that era!
B009MO5960|1.0|Paul W.S. Anderson just needs to give up, the RE series has only been getting worse with every movie. Thankfully I only rented however I still feel ripped off. My 6yr old nephew could write a better movie plot then this. *spoiler alert* (there is no plot) The CGI was bad, I've seen worse but when you rely on it as much as this movie did, you better make the CGI A+. Acting was terrible, and I am a fan of many of the actors in the film, I like seeing them in movies, though their effort seemed like 1 take shots; B acting all around. Thank goodness the movie was only 90mins any longer I would have either smashed my tv out of anger, or fallen asleep out of boredom. PLEASE Mr. Anderson stop making films you are terrible.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|quick and easy. love the setup. I would recommend it How many other ways can I say i love it
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Really a 4.5 film enjoyed it a lot. Not the deepest film but definitely enough not just some dumb action movie
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Good movie that entertains throughout. I was wondering how it could be made in to a pg13 movie given the nature of the original. Watched it with my 8 year old bit and wife, and only one short scene was not ok for him imo.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Can't say much about solitaire except I love playing it.  This particular game is easy to play and somewhat relaxing.<br />Also it's a free game.

B0084BMUFA|5.0|A great classic! Read during the Christmas season made more of an impression on me. If we also could live with Christmas in our hearts all year, what different world we would live in!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Very addictive. Beautiful backgrounds and tiles. Challenging but not too hard. Works well on Kindle. Plan to download it to my phone as well.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|Always gives pleasure - great to listen to these songs over the holidays - thanks Rod, enjoyed seeing you on the 'Today' programme (yes I'm a Brit too!!).
B005LAII1C|1.0|the digital and UltraViolet service are just lies these company have no business in providing these service that why they don't give customer service numbers to address your question. plan to file compliant with the federal government.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|This wasn't a movie I heard much about until I saw it in the movie listings at the local theater. My friend and I decided to see it last minute and laughed for the entire 2 hours. I loved it. The humor was great and the female ensemble was great. Definitely a fun movie for a girls night in or just a carefree weekend movie.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Surprised my daughter with this CD, and she plays it over and over... and over... and over... UGH!  Haha!  It's really a great CD though, looking forward to the next concert this August.
0345803485|1.0|I got this book for Christmas and couldn't wait to start reading. I am ready to begin chapter eight and I am done. The number of books I ever started reading and did not complete amount to about five or six but this one will have to be placed in that category. In my opinion it is a disgusting degradation of women and not worth anyone's time.
0446580848|5.0|Nelson Demille is the BEST!  he is funny & writes well ,,,holds your attention.  I always take his new book on vacation so I won't be interupted.
031620157X|5.0|So, far it's pretty good. I haven't gotten to far in it but it has great imagination on what happens in fairy tales or what could have happened. The twins go into a world that is not of there own to a fairy tale world where it shows the different fairy tales. I recommend ready this  as well as Struck By Lighting by Chris Colfer. Enjoy!!!
B005LAIIQC|1.0|Wasting you time if you expect to get the digital or ultraViolet copy as stated I have had the movie over two weeks and I have to instatll the actuall discuss to see the movie.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|The story of the American fighting man. It should be required reading for every member of the armed services. A  debt is owed to Mr Luttrell and those like him.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Pretty solid story line. Has some very nice twists and turns. One slow part makes me only go to 4 stars. I would recommend this book to my friends. Should make a good move, depending on how close to the story line hollywood stays.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|This is Clint Eastwood at his best!!! Clint does a great job showing off the range of his acting skills in a great performance and a must see movie for all movie fans.

B005OHSD3A|5.0|This book explains all I needed to do Atkins well and it includes several recipes that I can use to make yummy meals.
B007B5EDEG|1.0|I was attracted to the written series because of the HBO TV movies/series. Had I read the first novel I would not have bought the set. My frustration with all five novels was profound. Page after page was based on list after list. Boring and sad little lists, long and useless lists that added little to the characterisation of so many individuals. My mind fleshed out players in the novel from those on TV. Food lists were with little reference to historical food lists. Armour was sadly like an encyclopaedia listing of this and that dressed in poorly thought out decoration. Lists and lists and lists that merely added to the word-count. Mr Matin's fantasy could not be repressed by his sad writing and I look forward to the next TV offering where the width of the fantasy is, I hope, better and more  worthily presented. The TV product in the first two series was first rate and I give high credit to the producers and hope to see them climb still higher in presenting us with series three and four and...
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Who hasn't seen this movie?<br />It's a classic, I can watch it over and over.<br />Definitely one of the greats.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, Mississippi<br /><br />Van the Man is consistant.<br />I'll confess I don't have his debut album Blowin' Your Mind (1968) but by Moondance (1970) I was spreading the word, and I've remained a fan through Born To Sing: No Plan B (2012).<br />\\"No Plan B means this is not a rehearsal,\\" Van said and smiled. \\"That's the main thing -- it's not a hobby, it's real, happening now, in real time.\\"<br />And Van Morrison has been real since the get go, with one of the most recognizable voices in rock and soul music.<br />The voice is spiritual and the lyrics poignant. They've been that way since the seventies with songs like \\"Into the Mystic,\\" \\"Tupelo Honey\\" and \\"Domino.\\"<br />They remain the same on No Plan B.<br />He's still relevant, starting the album with \\"Open the Door (To Your Heart)\\" where he sings \\"Money doesn't make you fulfilled. Money's Just to pay the bills.\\" Many of the songs deal with the economic meltdown. Morrison continues, as he has on past albums, to inject christian messages as on \\"If In Money We Trust.\\"<br />\\"That came from looking at a dollar bill and turning the concept on its head,\\" Van said. \\"I thought `What is this stuff on here, what does it mean?' Some people's god is money, we've discovered that about a lot of people recently, so then what happens after that -- what happens if you don't have it, or if you don't have enough?\\"<br />The classic crooner has written every song on the CD, and there's not a bad cut. Other than the songs I've already mentioned, some of my other personal favorites are \\"Goin' Down to Monte Carlo,\\" \\"Close Enough for Jazz\\" and \\"Educating Archie.\\"<br />The 67-year-old Belfast native has done well to stay out of the tabloids and protect his most valuable asset -- his voice.<br />\\"My approach now is to sing from lower down (the diaphragm) so I do not ruin my voice. Before, I sang in the upper area of my throat, which tends to wreck the vocal cords over time,\\" he said.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This is great! Great price! Great movie! I love every second of it. This is our second copy-one for our living room one for our bedroom. Year round enjoyment.
B00AJER3SE|5.0|a very good movie at cheap price highly recommend it for all good picture and sound quality lots  of extras
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|Found this on Amazon for a &#34;Sound of Music&#34; Aficionado. It did hit the spot! The price was really unbeatable. I did not see the content as it was a gift!
B004QNN1UI|5.0|If you are a Simply Red fan this is well worth the purchase.  If you are new to them, perhaps the 5 star rating seems extreme.  Having been a fan since their first release it was great &#34;time traveling&#34; to the songs.
B0069GRIHW|5.0|I love the CD. One of my favories by the Doors.<br />It plays well and you have the best prices.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|The book was overall great. Even though it was vague a lot of the time, it was still pretty good. Still needs to expand on a few things.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|As a grandma of little boys, Cars has a special place in our lives! It streamed wonderfully, with no interruptions or problems!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book. Good story and good characters. The love scenes were great and I finished the book smiling.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|This Pro version lets me record radio when a good discussion is on (I listen to talk radio) and also great for saving a favorite song to learn about the artist.
0451209338|4.0|I love Danel Silva's Gabriel Allon books: this is the first one and it's good.<br />The later ones are really wonderful!l
B0094BB4TW|1.0|My girlfriend downloaded this to use, I hate Facebook and use to be addicted, then I realized I wasnt a loser and I was 28 years old and email, text, phone still exists.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|The forecast and current conditions are great. The radar map takes some time to load and is ok. The weather in motion is very slow.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I loved this game it is super fun but I am really impatient so if the food could cook a little faster I would love it even more:) but it is still an amazing game<br />also if you want a neighbor add me mjohnson32
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|I was hoping for a fun remake with almost 25 years-better special effects. The effects were certainly better, but there is no drama, tension, or interest in this movie that's any more sophisticated than a flying car chase (that looks just like \\"Minority Report\\") or a gun battle in a city that looks copied from \\"Bladerunner.\\"<br /><br />The technology \\"gimmick\\" that stands in for the Martian isolation of the first film is an interesting idea - that's barely explored, probably because logistically it doesn't actually make any sense. There's also literally no plot element in this film that stands in for the big set piece at the end of the original movie (the reactor and blue skies on Mars). Blowing up an over-glorified elevator? Who cares?<br /><br />This is an extremely poor paint-by-the-numbers no-brain action film for Colin Farrell. I think I was actually more entertained by \\"SWAT,\\" and I'd prefer to watch \\"In Bruges\\" dozens of times in a row rather than having to sit through this for a single additional viewing.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very good book and its very interesting and it gets very suspenseful and it doesn't leave you hanging after every chapter
B004HX4RT6|4.0|I got this for my son to learn to play chess. This is a really nice game that allows them to learn the moves and coordinates and as they get better the levels get more difficult. I also like the time killing ability that doesn't make me feel like I am completely non-productive while I play.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Great fun filled story line and great sound just a great quality dvd and you all should buy this one
B000EHSVS2|5.0|This is one of those movies that are a collector's piece. George C. Scott is great in the role and it is a great way to learn some history of World War II.Very realistic and shows the human side of war as well as tough leadership needed.
B008XG1X18|5.0|good to get to your pins quick. easy to use and has all the buttons you need to make pins on boards.
0545265355|5.0|I rated this a 5 because it is a great story. I purchased it for my daughter in law as she wanted to read it after seeing the movie.
0316228532|2.0|I am a voracious reader and an English teacher. I feel that I can set aside opinions about an author's previous works and judge a book on its own merit.  That is why I was so disappointed in THE CASUAL VACANCY.  I kept reading because I wanted to find the purpose of the book.  There is no one main character for the book to revolve around, except the dead guy with the highly metaphorical name, Barry Fairbrother.  All of the characters are minor characters and the wait is on for the story to come together for a single denoument. Instead...but I don't want to give anything else away.  I loved the Harry Potter series and I was ready for something more adult.  All of the skill, talent and organization from HP are missing here.  I find it ironic that she was so critical of E L James and her fluffily pornographic 50 Shades series.  While those books are not great literary masterpieces, at least you could follow the story and skip past the dull and repetitive sex passages and pick the story back up.  I admit, after awhile, I was skimming this book rather than reading it word for word. To read too closely was to fall asleep. This is definitely a book that got published, not on merit, but based on the author's name and previous success.  I am so glad I got it from the library and did not buy it.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Same gooey awesomeness from your computer now on your mobile phone! Amazing gameplay , smooth graphics...simple to learn and hard to master
B001OQCV6K|5.0|These two actors are so good in this awesome movie and the visual and sound quality is wonderful I would recommend it as a fun movie to watch and own
B00005O3VC|1.0|I really hated this movie and am sorry I bought it. I tried to give it away to friends and family and they all said, &#34;No.&#34; I would like my money back...but it is opened...so I guess it goes to Salvation Army!
B00474IVGA|4.0|I saw  the movie and thought this would be amazing, but the songs seemed different from the movie. Still a good buy.
B003UESJHO|5.0|Ok, Christian Bale & Mark Wahlberg are awesome - I don't think they could make a bad film if they tried - as usual this is awesome!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it!<br />It is wonderful to read the Holy Bible without turning a light on, and I love the audio sound you can turn on if you like.  This is why I wanted the Kindle Fire HD.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|A fun twist to this classic game.  Easy, fun and relaxing to play and good for the whole family. The game is also visually appealing and tiles are easy to read.
B00867GHS8|5.0|This dvd is wonderfully mastered with great color sound and visuals what a fun movie for all ages Buy it
1558908846|3.0|Good action movie and appropriate for young teens. My Grandsons really liked it. Adult's may think the acting a little &#34;hammy.&#34;
B00005J6UR|5.0|This is a classic. Introduce your kids to what a scary movie was at your age! Mine loved it and I was glad to see it on dvd!
073933235X|5.0|Loved the insights and intensity. Am having my partner listen to the audio version to help improve his kitchen skills as I will be the beneficiary!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|i have trouble with the posts loading. it shows about 10, then tends to freeze up. it is very frustrating
B0058YPGSY|5.0|We gave this as a Christmas gift to our son, who is a huge Sons of Anarch fan.  The video and audio quality were great.
B00005B5L4|5.0|this cd is as good as my other Fleetwood Mac cd, it is almost the same and sounds the same
B006X415GK|5.0|These dolls are very pricey in stores. Picked this up for $11 for my niece's birthday. While I don't get the appeal, she did, which was all that mattered. She was quite happy and no complaints. Thanks amazon!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I prefer to just go on the web to be able to see all my friends updates, that way you miss nothing.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book immediately draws you into the plot.  You are sucked in the moment you get through the first chapter.  I enjoyed the basic plot but as a reader you can easily figure out what will happen about a third of the way in.  But figuring out &#34;who done it&#34; is not the point.  It is mostly a journey into the psyche of the two main characters and all of their dysfunctions.  I found myself rooting for each of them through out the book, then being surprised and a little disappointed by the ending.  This is not to say the ending was inappropriate or lazy writing, it is that you hoped more for the characters and realize that how it ends is just how it is should be, and it is disappointing for them.<br /><br />I encourage this book for a good psycho thriller, but if you're looking for a who done it mystery something else might be in order.
B009M8TA20|5.0|he holds nothing back from what he has encountered as a footballer behind the scene. whereas other player autobiography's would not display the amount of conflicts they have encountered with their former players and coaches. Fantastic book from a true legend of the sport
B008FSCNTK|1.0|Have every album to date,.. if this is where she is going with her music, I won't be listening anymore. I could bearly get through all the songs 1 time. Very sad since the time & effort invested could have been something great after such a long wait.  Where is the jazz album we've all been waiting for?  Very sad when I was such a loyal fan of her music.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|If you want a DVD that will rock your world you should buy this one awesome special effects and sound

B0017SWPXY|5.0|Fabulous book. Especially for dog lovers and sensitive people,you know who you are. Please read it. It will enrich your life..As for racing fans it will be an added bonus.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|So far it is alright, just at chapter 2 but I will keep reading. Hopefully it will pick up a little more.
1572816112|4.0|I adore the art in this tarot deck. It is, however, a pretty dark deck. I realized this when I bought it, having read all of the reviews, but I suppose I still was not quite ready for the energy of this deck. I still use it, but I now save it for Halloween readings or new moon readings, when this deck feels more appropriate and comfortable to me.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|What an awesome visual and sound quality dvd lots of intense visual moments and I loved it and would urge you to buy it too
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love it. Especially since it was free and the advertising isn't too intrusive like some of the free games. . . . .
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|daughter loves it. takes practice for little hands, but adults can enjoy as well. a good time occupier for anyone.
B005XI9456|5.0|Who doesn't love Justin?  He did a great job with this CD.  Everyone here from ages 20 through 85 enjoyed listening to this one.

B003WJQ74E|5.0|Classic book that I downloaded because my niece had never read it.  She enjoyed it.  It is a classic that everyone should read at least once.

B009SIE6AA|4.0|James has always been my favorite and he sure doesn't disappoint here.  Loved it as did everyone who heard it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is incredibly beautiful. I laughed, cried, hurt, and could actually feel the love that Dean and Sky have for each other. Colleen Hoover is seriously one of the most talented writers. ITS A MUST READ!!!! Trust me, you won't regret it!
B001IMFHTS|5.0|all of his music is great to listen to and this cd arrangement is very good quality sound for my new system
B000641D2Y|5.0|I had forgotten how funny this movie was! If you liked the first one or just have a penchant for Christmas movies, this is worth picking up. Yes, it's a little predictable and yes, you have to suspend disbelief a bit, but it will definitely make you laugh. When I checked this was not steaming on Netflix. Couldn't beat the price, and Amazon Prime delivered within two days.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this is great time waster it's a great game you sshould git it, it's a really relaxing game hope y'all enjoy it it's great
030758836X|1.0|I saw Gone Girl on so many best of 2012 lists that I got it and read it in one day. And I was left feeling totally confused. Confused about why people reacted so strongly to a book with so many one-note characters, so many completely implausible plot points and an ending that defies logic.  Confused as to whether or not this was written by an adult. Confused about what type of novel this was exactly - part crime thriller, part psycho drama, part soapy trash-lit. But all disappointing.
B000FC12Z0|3.0|This book was definitely not my most favorite book but it was alright. It was very slow in certain parts  of it but at other parts it really sped up & I was very interested. I also thought it  was too organized  & it made  me think very hard but over all I really did like the book.
B000003ER4|5.0|loved it on my new sound system would reccomend to everyone even my husband loves this selection and would buy again
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|A movie that almost feels like it is inspired by the liberal left, until it breaks back to the right! It has some good twists and is entertaining!

B000Q67876|5.0|&#34;This is a must-see movie of a man.&#34; Everybody said so. But purely from a gender distinction, will make this movie becomes narrow. &#34;The Shawshank Redemption&#34; break through the limitations of man movie, incredibly warm tone throughout almost full, the greatest movie theme is &#34;hope&#34;. When we reluctantly met like Shawshank prison generally a kind of spiritual freedom imprisoned, we are helpless old Brooke discouraged Reid wisdom Andy? Wisdom, trust, hope, and courage to face the fear, to defeat it? The reason why the classic movie classic, because they are doing the same thing - to enjoy the hope of a better you from different angles.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|We watched this  a couple years ago.  We thought it was a great series.  It was a Christmas present for my brother.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|While the narrative leaves something to be desired the storyline and characters were engaging enough to continue through the end. Some elements within the story arc however felt arbitrary and contrived.
B000VS6QTK|5.0|Angus and company are in top form delivering a high energy show shot in great HD quality, well worth the purchase price!
B009YG2ND8|5.0|This game is now my favorite final fantasy. Not too much story, great gameplay, fun battle system. The graphics, user interface and controls are done very well. I'm not too crazy about virtual stick games, but its done well in this game. Zoomed in close some of the textures are a bit low rez, but most of the game is played zoomed out and its truly beautiful.<br /><br />So much to like about this game. I love the art style. I love that you are thrown into the game without having to watch 2 hours of story. The job system is great. This is definitely worth the money and better than the Nintendo DS version. Anyone complaining about price doesn't understand the difference between full scale triple A titles and watered down games for the app store. I'm glad I bought this game.  Buy it and you won't regret it.
B005VTS4EY|1.0|Four star game other than that. If I buy the game, you shouldn't force me to review it. Really it's fun though.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I didn't really understand all the baby stuff in the beginning I was a little confusing to me and maybe other readers to
B008645YH6|5.0|There must be two versions of this album, because the one I received had an extended track list (Which I'm grateful for, I was looking for 'How to be a Heartbreaker' and was happy it was included). However, the one song that is missing is 'Living Dead' which I really enjoyed, having listened to it on youtube. Instead, it was replaced with the lesser 'Sex Yeah' on my copy.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the CD, I recently stumbled upon Marina and the Diamonds doing a performance on live TV a couple months back, and fell in love since. I was just kind of surprised to see the copy I received featured extra songs, but also removed one track. I'm not going to complain, I can always purchase a download of the track, but I thought I would at least mention it :)<br /><br />The copy of 'Electra Heart' tracklist I received is as follows:<br /><br />1. Bubblegum Bitch<br />2. Primadonna<br />3. Lies<br />4. Homewrecker<br />5. Starring Role<br />6. The State of Dreaming<br />7. Power & Control<br />8. Sex Yeah<br />9. Teen Idle<br />10. Valley of the Dolls<br />11. Hypocrates<br />12. How To Be A Heartbreaker<br />13. Radioactive<br />14. Fear & Loathing
B007FRHZ4A|1.0|My son got this game as a Christmas gift.  He loves Angry Birds and subsequently loves this game, but the fact is it's impossible to play.  We've successfully built about 5 of the 24+ potential designs and neither of us has been able to build any of them on the first try.  We usually cannot get any of the designs to work as they were intended, \\"cheating\\" by turning the blocks at a different angle to get them to stand up or hold up the other blocks.  The grey \\"stone\\" blocks are actually rounded on one side, making it even more difficult to get anything to stand up straight.  It would probably be easier if the blocks were solid, but they are all hollow with open sides.  This should be a quick, fun game that takes 30 minutes or less to play until someone wins.  Instead, my son and I spent a couple hours playing and nobody got anywhere close to winning.<br /><br />I get that your kids probably love Angry Birds.  I am a huge fan, too.  But save hours of frustration with a game that doesn't work right and get a different Angry Birds toy, or some other game altogether.
B009DA74ES|4.0|First and foremost I must say that I watched this season, in its entirety, in one sitting, as people are wont to do in this modern age. That being said, I think this season was a season of new beginnings for Hank Moody. I loved the time passing between season 4 and season 5. I believe the Mia (sp?) arc had run its course (the fans of the show know what I'm talkin 'bout). My beloved series needed a revitalizing shot in the arm. However, I am a human being, and change is hard for me. So, not everything about this season was as charming as previous yearly installments. There are several moments that jar me, but not quite enough to disrupt my suspension of disbelief. Old side stories continue, but the new side stories (nanny and Kali, fo sho) did not charm me, to say the very least.<br />I will say that this season is not without its charm. The revisiting characters, themes, and tropes (oh my) are what keep me coming back. More Moody? Yes please.<br />(***Oh so minor spoiler) On a final note, this season like the previous seasons does not give Hank the happily ever after he claims to want so dearly. Instead, it gives him merely a glimpse of the house with the white picket fence. Oh well. There's always next year to see how deep the rabbit hole goes. Pour me another whiskey, bartender (top shelf, please).
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This book is awesome, I finished the book in about two or three days. The book kept me very entertained for a while. I highly recommend this book to people who love to read funny books.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|I actually didn't watch it, but my kids are decent movie critics and they said it was phenomenal.  They even said it was better than all the other Ice Age movies!  I'll have to see it to believe that, but that's pretty high praise!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Watch them all!  I love these movies because they don't too unrealistic. Grab the first three and then watch this one.
034580404X|5.0|T his item as gret and arrived in time for my holday party so I could give it as a gift.

B00004YA66|5.0|Great movie.  If you know anyone who likes Jim Cavezel or Dennis Quaid and likes some mystery or time travel, then this is the movie for you.  It was perfect for my husband and I loved watching it again.

B0000549B0|5.0|I love this old movie, I love Jimmy Stewart, I've watched many times and I never tired of watching it.
B00005JM20|4.0|I love this movie!  Before I get into details, I will tell you a little about myself.<br /><br />I live in Toronto, Canada and I enjoy movies.  I am a huge Rowan Atkinson fan.  I own the complete series of Mr. Bean, both Mr. Bean films Bean the Movie and Mr. Bean's Holiday, all of Mr. Bean: The Animated Series, both this film Johnny English and it's sequel Johnny English Reborn and even a vintage min tin 1989 Mr. Bean action figure!  I am also a fan of James Bond.<br /><br />In November 2011, I saw a TV ad for the 2011 sequel to Johnny English entitled Johnny English Reborn.  I had never seen the first film.  I thought because I was a fan of Rowan Atkinson, I might enjoy Johnny English Reborn.  I saw it and I loved it!<br /><br />A few weeks later, I was watching TV to see what was on.  I found Johnny English!  Unfortunately, the movie was almost over.  I turned off the TV and went to bed.<br /><br />The next morning, I went to a local HMV and found this film for five dollars.  I bought it and watched it that evening.  I loved it!<br /><br />WARNING: THE NEXT PARAGRAPH IS A SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />I understand that some people do not like this film because of it's anti-Catholic scenes.  Near the end of the film, there is a scene where Johnny English(Rowan Atkinson) pulls down a priest's pants and you can see his bare buttox.  Being a Roman Catholic myself, I found this scene both offensive and funny.  That scene is the only reason why I am giving this film four stars instead of five.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT ENDED<br /><br />Overall, Johnny English is a very funny movie which will get both audiences young and old crying with laughter.  I recommend this film.<br /><br />Film Rating: 4\5
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book kept me busy for two days. With all the secret fantasies any girl loves to indulge in, this book kept me wanting more and more. A great read!
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I can't really give a good review to this book.  I just don't like this style of writing but I'm sure it is great for others.
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|Plain and simple the best album content and beats since Urban Legend!!! I am a huge T.I. fan and some of his past albums have been a let down in the areas of content and production, but this here is a certified banger!!! There is only one song that I thought the album could've done without and that's Wildside with A$AP Rocky. Both went hard but song about weed don't really do anything for me, but other than that I love the album top to bottom.
B004UQPM4E|1.0|I'm another dolt who should have listened to the other reviewers who received the UK version.  I guess I trusted the product description.  I'm sad because this was a gift for my brother and he has to deal with trying to exchange it.
B0041D843M|5.0|This book is breathtaking in its thoroughness and completeness of viewpoints. It is a life changing piece of work that everyone who is interested in living a long and fruitful life must read!
B00280LYIC|5.0|At first I saw the movie that was based upon the book thinking it was okay. Recently I tried this book and loved it! It always had me in the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened to persius and his companions. This book does such an amazing job of describing the fighting and even git me emotionally attached with the characters of the book. I would always replay a scene in my head adding slow motion action as if it were a movie inside my head , putting myself in the position of Percy. Any Greek mythology lover ,will definitely enjoy this new York Times best seller written by Rick Riordan.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|All the features of the VHS and Blu rays, plus old laserdisc features. The remastering looks amazing. Makes me wish I was born early enough to see them in theaters.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|My kids love this one. It is a nice little game to keep them occupied. Challenging enough for adults too.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|You can't change many of the options in free mode, but its loud and bright. Just what I was looking for when I'm not near an actual alarm clock.
B00ARAO720|5.0|This movie kept moving, I did not want to fall a sleep or go find some thing else to do.  Action packed all the way.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This is a great ending to a great series. I wish it didn't have to end! Guess I'll just have to start over!
B008EQIEWS|4.0|The Titan looked fantastic, the Minotaur looked like it had a few extra chromosomes, and the Chimaera was just odd. But old crookshanks makes all the weird choices worth it. Definitely a character that needed more screentime.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|music is nice and relaxing, tiles are easy to match.  I like this game as a way to unwind from the day.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Not through Andy Weir's &#34;The Martian&#34; quite yet (I'll finish it tonight), but already find myself wishing I could extend it indefinitely! Weir is one of the best of the best in my opinion when it comes to bringing science fiction to a level that leaves one convinced that not only does his story sound plausible but it just may actually happen in the not too distant future. If you read one book these next few days make it &#34;The Martian&#34;. I guarantee you won't be disappointed!
B001AZFO14|5.0|The whole getting some back and I'd like to be there whe it came back around describes this movie to a tee.  A must watch.

B003WUYRGI|5.0|This dictionary is really helpful. If I need help. All I have to do is just look on my kindle and just pick books. And this will help me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the third time I have  read the series and it just keeps improving. The subtle love triangle subplot to the entire book is riveting and really sets it apart from other  young adult fiction books out there.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|The game is comically designed, making you smile.  The levels are challenging, and make you think.  A very good game.
B003VANOFY|4.0|The only disadvantage of the speaker is: it is runing on 2.4 GHz the same as WIFI frequency.<br />However there is a fix so the WiFi doesn't drop off while the headphone is being used
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|All the funny parts? You have already seen them on the previews and trailer. In fact, just watch the trailer. It's free.
075669812X|5.0|These books are really great.  We have three of them (Star Wars, Harry Potter, and now Ninjago). My son who is ten will often just grab the book off his shelf and begin paging through them.  They are a great complement to the Lego sets of the same name.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|This a different and cute story, that although ozzed chick lit, had elements Of surprise, either way, it was hard to put down.

B003O86FMW|3.0|Well, I think Suzanne just got bored basically repeated the first book over again. I also think it's inappropriate how the two teens sleep together
B007HACDLK|3.0|I am a Vince Flynn fan but this story didn't flow as well as his other novels in my opinion.
B00867GJYK|5.0|This should be in any collection of kids movies it is another Disney Masterpiece! I highly recommend this movie to anyone young or old..
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|...and can't wait to re-read before each movie release!  Such an interesting series.  Love having this in the Kindle edition, rather than lugging around the thick books.  It's a page-turner at the end of every chapter...which probably explains why I read them so quickly!!
B00466H3I6|5.0|The recent release of The Hitchcock Masterpiece Collection on Blu-ray prompted me to revisit some of the best films in the set. I have always liked The Birds because I saw it as a child and it has stuck with me over the years. It's interesting viewing such films again with a critical eye, rather than as a young boy who just needed to be entertained.<br /><br />There are frequent spoilers ahead, so stop reading now if you haven't yet seen the film.<br /><br />Like Psycho, The Birds starts off with a light tone, as Hitchcock leads us to believe that the film will develop into a romantic comedy. I admire this approach because it's realistic. People would be acting normally a few days before a disaster or a terrifying turn of events. So you can expect to see the main characters introduced at the start of the film, and you'll see them flirt and develop a mutual attraction. This paves the way for Melanie Daniels' (Tippi Hedren) subsequent actions as she drives to Bodega Bay to deliver a gift for Mitch Brenner's (Rod Taylor) daughter, Cathy (Veronica Cartwright).<br /><br />If Hitchcock had decided to make the entire film a romantic comedy, I'm sure he would have done a good job. There's a depth present that doesn't exist in most examples from that genre. The dialogue gives us important insights into the characters, as well as supplying some of the exposition for the basic plot. We learn that Melanie is rich and works several jobs on different days of the week. She seems to have a wild, impulsive streak, and that fits her actions when she decides to visit Mitch. She also lies often, although never in a malicious way. Mitch is playful when he interacts with Melanie, but we soon learn that he is dependable in a crisis.<br /><br />Melanie is also resourceful, and we see her charter a boat and use it to approach Mitch's house unobserved. The first indication that the world might not be idyllic comes when Melanie is attacked by a gull as she is returning the boat. The scene is so out of place because there hasn't been any suggestion that the film will be anything but fun up to that point, and it seems all the more shocking for it.<br /><br />The events begin to turn darker in tone, and the pace increases from the moment of the initial attack. Other people begin to report attacks, and we witness several instances of unusual behavior by the birds. This is exactly the kind of novel that Stephen King might write; the world is apparently normal, but one thing is out of place. What would you do if you witnessed similar behavior from birds or small animals? It's so unexpected that it can be quite frightening in places. There's no campy humor to relieve the tension like that found in many modern horror movies. Hitchcock slowly increases tension throughout the film, without ever explaining why the birds are behaving in such an odd way.<br /><br />I have always enjoyed seeing what happens when events cause society to begin to break down. What lengths would you go to to keep yourself or your family safe, or to provide food when it was scarce? The story takes place over a couple of days, so there's no serious breakdown of order in The Birds, but we do see how people start to band together and take care of each other.<br /><br />The film was made in 1963, so you can't expect the special effects to be as convincing as modern techniques would allow. The bird effects are a combination of puppets, machines, and a few live birds, using a blue screen to insert them into the action. The special effects earned an Oscar nomination at the time, so try to forgive the somewhat dated feel.<br /><br />As usual, Hitchcock assembled a strong cast. Rod Taylor and Tippi Hedren are convincing as potential romantic partners, and both give good performances as their characters encounter stressful situations. Mrs. Brenner (Jessica Tandy) is an important character too. She's reluctant to embrace Melanie's arrival and fears that her son Mitch may abandon her at some point. There's one particularly good scene in which Melanie talks to Mrs. Brenner and tries to allay her fears about the birds. You can sense some level of acceptance from Mrs. Brenner, although she can't decide whether she actually likes Melanie.<br /><br />One of the best scenes occurs outside the town's school, where Annie (Suzanne Pleshette) is teaching a class. She makes the children sing, while Melanie waits outside to collect Cathy. In typical Hitchcock fashion, we see one or two birds landing behind Melanie. She's unaware of their presence until she turns and sees hundreds of them. She comes to a decision and goes inside to warn Annie of the potential problem. This leads to one of the most dramatic sequences in the film as the children leave the school.<br /><br />The Birds is elevated above the level of most horror films for several reasons: The characters are real people with genuine fears, the dialogue means something, the acting is strong, and the audience is given time to absorb the danger of a situation rather than being bombarded with gory or shocking scenes. The ending (intentionally) doesn't completely resolve the story, but it leaves us with a sense of optimism.<br /><br />With the exception of the song sung by the children at the school, there is no score in the entire film. It reminds me of The Mist in that way, and I think the scenes contain more tension because we make up our own minds about how to feel, rather than having the music inform us that there is danger or a scary moment approaching.<br /><br />Most of the whimsical scenes happen early in The Birds. Hitchcock's cameo is impossible to miss, and when somebody whistles at Melanie, it's a reference to a TV ad in which she first caught the attention of Hitchcock. By the end of the film, you'll feel as if you have been through a grueling emotional journey. It's a journey well-worth taking. It doesn't even matter why the birds were behaving so strangely, or whether their behavior was only present in Bodega Bay, or more widespread.<br /><br />As for the Blu-ray, it's a mixed bag. The DTS-HD Master Audio Mono track enhances the experience considerably. The sound of fluttering wings is particularly effective. However, the picture quality is disappointing. While some of the brighter scenes do show good detail, far too many of the shots appear soft. It appears that Tippi Hedren's close-ups were intentionally softened, in a way similar to the female characters on the original Star Trek show. As for the effects, the additional information offered by the Blu-ray transfer highlights some of the weaker shots. This is probably as good as it's going to get for a long time, and I do recommend that you upgrade, but I'm still a little disappointed.here's one particularly good scene in which Melanie talks to Mrs. Brenner and tries to allay her fears about the birds.

B00633W614|5.0|I have neen a Jeffrey Archer fan since kane & Abel. all of his books are 5 star for me.
1451695195|4.0|This book has a lot going for it. It's extremely well written and, whether it's dealing with the gripping details of Dr. Alexander's illness or the incredible revelations of his near death experience, it is never dull. Some readers may have a problem, however, with certain aspects of the Dr.'s NDE. Although it's always wise to keep an open mind when evaluating NDEs, the doctor's ride on a butterfly wing while children laugh and people sing and dance below, for example, may be hard for some skeptics to swallow. Nevertheless, the total effect of Dr. Alexander's adventures in what may or may not be the next world is tremendously uplifting. We can only hope that when the time inevitably comes our own experience will be half as wonderful.
B009POCFTG|2.0|This is a very, very violent movie! A lot of nudity, sexual innuendos and ...more violence. For what? The plot is not fully developed and the movie ends suddenly, like they just run out of money or ideas.<br /><br />Chris (Emile Hirsch) owes money to the local mob and decides to kill his mother because he heard from his mother's boyfriend that she has a life insurance for $50,000 and that he and his sister are the only beneficiary. That should have been the first warning sign for Chris already that things are not going to turnout nicely! He hires Joe (Mathew McConaughey) who is a cop and part time professional killer. But Joe asks payment upfront and because Chris cannot afford it, Joe takes his sister Dottie (Juno Temple) as a retainer. This is the second warning sign for Chris!<br /><br />The acting is really great but the movie really lacks a real interesting plot and assumes that all people living in trailers are pure trash. Gina Gerson runs around totally naked for the first five minutes of the movie. Nothing to see there, it is ugly, grotesque, and poorly done! Slowly the movie reaches its crescendo and then...the movie ends. We do not get any answers to our questions. We really don't know what happened. Maybe they need to prepare a sequel!<br /><br />Two stars because of the acting that is really good. But the plot is not fully developed and the movie doesn't provide any answers to our questions.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|very nice, simple watch. A little smaller than I was expecting, but it's sleek and the mesh band is a very nice detail. I recommend it to anyone.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is terrific!  It seems an easy task at first, but as the boards get bigger it is defiantly a challenge to connect all the dots! I have spent hours with this game.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|We got this for our 11 year old grandson for Christmas.  He loves paper mazes and goes through them so fast I was worried he might solve this right away.  Not so, he is still working on it and loves the challenge.  Nice to see him play with something other than just video games.
B0017TYPIG|3.0|This movie was great!  Back in the 1920's maybe.  Paul Newman really makes it watchable and his portrayal of Luke makes you keep watching.  There were several parts where I got bored, but nonetheless, I finished it!  What we have here is a failure to communicate...well not anymore...we have cell phones, emails, text messages, websites, etc etc etc.  And yes, I know the movie is from the 60's.
B000WOT406|5.0|I've owned this CD for almost 10 years now.  Every time I play it its just as good as the first.
B008NW67E0|4.0|This is a very good album and typical of Mumford And Sons. So, if you like the band, then you'll like this album...there's nothing unusual here. However, I prefer Sigh No More over this one, as it seemed to have more energy and passion. This one seems a bit too pandering on many of the songs.<br /><br />I'm also disappointed by the \\"deluxe\\" version having only 3 more songs (one of which is actually from a Jerry Douglas CD) and, ironically, \\"Where Are You Now\\" being one of their best songs, so why not put it on a standard issue? A deluxe version would be better suited with a bonus live disc of some of their high energy live performances. THAT would be worth it!<br /><br />Overall though, a very good cd worthy of many repeat plays. It just leaves me yearning for more.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I like this game.  My teenage daughter found it a while back and I had seen it but not played it .  When I got a new tablet for Christmas I was able to download the game easily and played for quite a while.  It's not the best game I've ever played, but it has kept me busy for several hours and it's one I'll go back to.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I am reading &#34;Sharp Edges&#34; now - I really like the way Gillian Flynn writes!<br />Very intriguing - suspenseful -

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This is a long game but very very good. Well worth the two dollars. I loved the story and graphics. I can't wait for the sequel.
B005DI65L2|4.0|In depth discussion on things I only thought I knew about dogs after many years of ownership.<br />Author took education to a higher level with her own dog experiences.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I really liked this book... I had read the first one and really enjoyed it as well. Having just read 50 Shades and loving it, it was nice to read something similar but different at the same time
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this game is fun to play, needs an update though. dont like the in app purchases, but theyre not required to play

B004KKXMSI|3.0|The movie was great, but when we got to the second movie in the middle the movie kept going but there wasn't any sound which was a disappointment on Christmas Day.  Tried second DVD player and samething happened - movie was great so far but product was not.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|I ordered the first season after watching one of the episodes, I read the comic books, but wasn't sure about the show. I decided to order the season and see how it turned out. I got hooked and I am now a fan. If you have not watch the series yet, this is a good way to begin watching a great show.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|I have already watched this season repeatedly. It never gets old. The characters are believable and well developed. Owning the first season helps me get by during times when it isn't on tv.
0316228532|5.0|Made a great gift! Came in great condition; better that if I'd bought it at the bookstore! The person I bought it for really enjoyed it

B005J3IEZQ|5.0|The book is a great account of Steve Jobs life. I love it. The author however seem to be overemphasize Jobs personality weakness. I have a newly found respect for Apple products.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I got these for my kids, but even adults have fun watching the movie. Steve Carrell does a wonderful performance.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is a 5 star because it's full of humor and kids like me love it. I recommend this book to kids ages 10-15 love this book.

B004G6009U|5.0|I loved the price for the two-disc combo. With the economy so bad, it was a cool deal. Both disc played smoothly, no issues. Ihave never been disappointed with Amazon for online ordering. No hassle Return Policy is great! Only had to return for replacement/ refund maybe two times out of eight!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|After buying the Aliens quatrilogy, this was the next &#34;move&#34; to make. Still need to check on the EXTRA material for a lot of answers.
B0055B7K7A|5.0|Love this movie! I lost my husband in 2005 and this movie characterizes what it has been like - mourning, healing, and reluctantly being forced into the adventure of a new life.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was the best one. I love it. I think I'll read it again. Read this book now please.
B005CRQ2XA|4.0|It was funny I liked it but if you already have this book at home don't get it its your choice if you want to waste your money good luck :-) :-) advice -Taylor
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I saw part of season 1 and loved it. I loved the victorian era movies. I purchased season 1 and of course had to have season 2. Cannot wait for season three at a price I can afford ($35 is too high). If you like the Jane Austin series, you will love Downton Abbey too.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|The product looks great and I was really looking forward to have both seasons in blu ray. very good !
B006KX3GXO|5.0|fun to do my edits with my cell phone pictures. easy upload to social sites. sharing through text messaging. I would recommend. this
B009SMW9IW|3.0|I'm a fan of Everything But the Girl, and Ms. Thorn's voice is good to hear again. Her voice is well suited to the Christmas season. She does a great job with River (originally done by Joni Mitchell).
034580404X|5.0|Exactly what I expected! It's great to have them all at once! I don't have to wait for the next one!
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Loved this movie from the first time I saw it. Wanted to have it for my collection but could not afford it at the offered price. Waited for the holiday sales and got it!. Wanted the blu-ray too, but could not afford the combo pack. recommend it for all ages. It is endearing...
B003TT2X72|5.0|This trilogy is a must for Blu ray ! Really glad I got them, will add it to my collection.
B007THA4FI|3.0|Not as good as I thought it would be. Kind of a slow read. Somewhat hard to follow-- haven't finished it yet.
0385535147|1.0|I purchased the unabridged version CD and I could not believe how boring the story started and ended.  The reader is a monotone. Why did they just not ask the prisoner who killed the judge?  That would have ended a very slow going book.  Don't waste your money on this book.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|Reacher, when not thinking too much, can be a kick-ass character. For the most part, So is this movie. The film allows the viewer to think and follow action , in a way most other contemporary action films, do not. Resonably logical, except for a throw down the gun and fight scene at the end, this was fun. Let's hope it makes enough money to follow up with another.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|It okay... it past the time when your bored.  For what it worth I enjoyed it, but didn't rrreally understand the whole timing thing on the game.
0345529057|4.0|I normally use my kindle for all of my reading, but buying and shipping the box set was about half the price of the kindle version. I am only half way through the second book but am enjoying the series. Set was received in perfect condition a day before the delivery date that was displayed. Very happy with my purchase.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun addictive game !! I play it on my kindle fire HD  and my laptop. I enjoy the game alot.
B005LAIHYU|1.0|Most of us know of Abraham Lincoln -the 16th president of the United States, writer of the Emancipation Proclamation, preserver of the Union, ender of slavery. But what most of us don't know is that Mr. President was also fighting another war--one against vampires. Little do any of us realize just how much of a role the undead played in the outcome of the American Civil War. It all started at the tender age of nine when Abe witnessed his mother's murder at the hands of a vampire. Soon thereafter, revenge became his new mission. With the help of an undead ally, Henry, Honest Abe mounted his own campaign to exterminate the worst of the vampires and free America from their evil clutches.<br /><br />After a very painful attempt to get through the audiobook, I decided to give Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter (the movie) a chance. Have you seen the trailer? Doesn't it look awesome?! Sadly, we've been misled. This movie isn't awesome. It isn't even awesomely bad. It's just plain bad. Initially, I attributed my dislike of the novel to the fact that I'm not one for American or presidential history. I find the subject matter to be quite dull. It's just not my bag, baby, and that's okay. I guess I was disappointed because I thought there would be more vampy action in it. So naturally after seeing the trailer, I was led to believe they'd given the movie incarnation the Michael Bay treatment. Oh there was action alright, but not enough of the good kind to save it from being a total disaster.<br /><br />I think the movies failure comes in that it's just too much, too over the top. Had they attempted to do campy, I could've dealt with that, but they didn't. They took it way too seriously and relied solely on cartoonish CGI effects to achieve the high intensity for which they were aiming. And I know I said I didn't like the book, but the movie deviated so far away from the original source material that it was barely even recognizable. At least Benjamin Walker nailed it in the looks department though his performance was somewhat wooden and shaky at best. There were, however, a few very cool montage-worthy training scenes which kept me somewhat placated. And I also have to give a big nod to my favourite typecasted bad guy, Dominic Cooper. He's just the bestest of the bad. All I can really say is<br />Food for Thought: Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter somehow managed to be both of poor quality and ridiculously over-the-top at the same time. There is no shortage action but it's a shoddy, unsatisfying type of action that left a very disagreeable taste in my mouth. I cannot in good conscience recommend the movie, however, if American/presidential history is your thing, give the book a whirl.<br /><br />Rating: 1 1/2 Starsdepartment though his performance was somewhat wooden and shaky at best.

B005S9EK5Y|4.0|The director must have said \\"Emotion\\" Tears gush for innocence lost, dreams dashed, injustice, lost love, ideals crushed. And I liked it. Not the strongest collection of voices. Russell Crowe diappoints, his role called for a stronger voice. But Jackman (tho a little high) and Hathaway burn the early scenes, and give a lesson on how it is done. A magnificent performance by all.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this game it cutie, fun, entertaining. It make me laugh every time I start it up, heck my fiance love this game as well.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Very fun!  I play it more then my daughter!  Just when you think you're going to run out of every you go up a level and your energy goes back up.
B00402FGE4|1.0|Basically, it's boring. It's a soap opera in space. If you like Battlestar Galactica, then you'll like this. But if you like Sg-1 and Stargate Atlantis, you'll hate it.
1451608659|5.0|This story really shows how challenging it is to be an elite level athlete in any sport.  The requirements put on young athletes really needs to be monitored by parents.  The public rarely sees what goes into becoming an Olympian and Dominique shares some wisdom as she went through it and was able to look back on her experiences.  Her family shocker adds to the story too!  Highly recommended
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Tarrantino is at it again with this sequel to his \\"Inglorious Basterds.\\" And like it, Django too is a \\"victim's redemption story.\\" Only this time the victimology does not involve Jewish revenge against Nazi ovens, but black revenge against plantation slave brutality. The vehicle here as before, is the now familiar but somewhat worn Western spaghetti trope -- slightly updated and modified: A slave is rescued from a chain gang heading deeper South - meaning to a more brutal Plantation. Django hooks up with a bounty hunter and they ride into several towns where Django \\"gets to kill white people and get paid for it.\\"<br /><br />As a pretext for what Tarentino's movies do best, they raid and kill their way across the plantation landscape from Texas to Tennessee. Ostensibly their loud blazing guns and dynamite are in search of certified \\"bad guys,\\" but in truth (and this is the underlying subtext) their overall mission is to \\"even the score\\" between the stripes on Django's back and the peace and tranquility of the Southern plantation way of life. Violence here is a purposeful morality rectifying and restoring tool.<br /><br />As this dynamic duo go about the symbolic business of \\"evening the moral score for all times,\\" they also are in search of Django's wife who was \\"sold South\\" along with him. Along the way, they wreak untold havoc on plantation owners across a wide swath of Southern peace, tranquility and hospitality.<br /><br />In one single symbolic stroke of the writer's pen, the picturesque exploits of a single symbolic slave/cowboy/bounty hunter, Django, sets the moral world upright against.<br /><br />Commentary<br /><br />At any time except Xmas and the aftermath of the wanton murders at \\"Sandy Hook,\\" Conn, this would have been an uninterrupted \\"feel good movie.\\" However with those two things as a heavy-hearted backdrop, American violence can no longer in any sense be taken as being \\"normal or culturally sane.\\"<br /><br />In all of Tarrantino's movies includingthis one, he has been trying to tell us obliquely (which is the only way you can tell Americans anything) that the level and utter glee and enjoyment and celebration of violence in our culture may be normal for us, but it is utterly insane for any culture with its moral and human sensibility and its humanity still intact.<br /><br />Somehow, we have failed to get his underlying message. We love violence because, its primary tool in our culture, the gun, is close to holiness, close to our hearts, intertwined with our history, and the answer to all our fears, prayers and problems. Some Americans get an orgasm just by holding an AR-15? We worship the gun like most religions worship its prophets, perhaps even more so, since there is only one Amendment to our Constitution that comes before \\"the right to bear arms.\\" If that is not the very definition of an insane culture then would someone please stand up and tell me what is?<br /><br />Anyone who wants to know why random acts of anti-kindness (as in brutal wanton murders against 20 kindergarteners) happen in this nation, need go no further than look directly into the mirror: We are a hate-filled nation perpetually living on moral credit, pretending to be much better than we are. We are good and moral only to the extent we tell ourselves it is so. We do not allow, nor will we ever abide being told anything other than what the distorted, lying mirror, mirror on the wall keeps telling us: that we are the fairest, greatest, most peace-loving nation of them all.<br /><br />It is a lie and we know it and now with Sandy Hook, we also feel it deeply.<br /><br />By the twisted logic of the established American norm, it is always a case of never mind the reality out there: That we stand alone as the country that has been in more wars than any nation in the history of the world; that the murders we commit against each other every year since WW-II is by a \\"factor of ten\\" more than all of the European countries (with Canada, Japan, Korea, New Zealand and Australia thrown in) combined; that we are one of the most hate-filled nations in the world; and that random, wanton and rampant gun violence such as occurred at Sandy Hook is just the \\"new normal\\" for us. [Get over it, right?]<br /><br />Each year, the threshold of the amount of violence that our weak sensibilities will tolerate is just continually lowered. That is why the guns in Tarrantino's movies keep having to get louder and louder: He is trying to get our attention and tell us that our's is a profoundly sick culture. Period! (No, exclamation mark !)<br /><br />Already, our mulatto President has \\"outsourced\\" the investigation of Sandy Hook to his Vice President to \\"study the problem,\\" and we know what happens when a Presidential Commission \\"studies a problem?\\" Anyone who really wants to know why the \\"Sandy Hooks\\" keep occurring in the U.S. should just listen to the hate that drips off the mouth of that certified NRA idiot, Wayne LaPierre, or better yet, read David Courtwright's book \\"Violent Lands.\\" Five Stars because the acting is simply superb throughout. Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson's acting is just completely off the charts!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I really like that it's a puzzle and you are building things.  Both my son and I really enjoy playing it.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This book brings out the true Christmas spirit in all of us. I truly feel that this classic piece of literature can help us all view the world and our affairs in a more positive light. Perhaps if more people could change as fast as Scrooge we wouldn't be such a selfish race. The ending I'd a timeless moral

B00AMBH70S|3.0|A decent chase scene or two but not worth the 2+ hours.  The plot was thin and it took a while for the movie to get moving.  This movie did not live up to any of the previous Bourne's.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|Superb vocals - singer has been compared to Janis Joplin, but I hear it more as a combo of Joplin and Adele - powerful, powerful voice, so far without the hard edge Janis had.  Excellent sound overall from the whole band.

B004HUE57S|5.0|I've had chronic wrist issues for over 15 years.  Physical therapy usually works but hadn't recently.  I also got a cortisone shot and that helped until I started using my previous ergonomic mouse (from Gyration).  As an avid computer user, I needed something different.  The Evoluent Mouse is perfect.  I no longer have the pain associated with extended mouse usage.
B000ZMCVRI|5.0|It's a must have for any music collection. A classic that has been popular for ages. Bob Marley's Legend represents classic reggae.

B005HSL626|1.0|Okay..This is a good and fun game and all for when you're bored..But, I highly<br />recommend you not to install it on the Kindle Fire..It glitches terribly, and it freezes your Kindle... Just to inform you guys with the Kindle Fire and you want to install this app..This game is only good for iPods and phones.. but, It sucks horribly on the Kindle Fire..Just Trust me..Don't install it on your Kindle.. You'll thank me later..
B0034G4P1W|3.0|The Pirates Band of Misfits is a nice movie for younger kids. The plot was enjoyable, it is about a group of pirates trying to get the most gold so they can win a contest held by pirates. The queen of England, however, wants every pirate dead until she finds out that this group has a rare Dodo bird. It is nice and well-paced. The problem is animation. It moves at like half a frame per second and looks horrible. Claymation is a hard style to work with, but surely they could do better then this. Nobody wanted to watch even the trailer, so don't ask me how we bought this.
B000274THQ|4.0|Was an assignment for an Eastern European post 1945 class. Gave a good replication of how East Germans felt once the Berlin Wall had fallen in 1989. Showed the comparisons of living under almost 45 years of Communist rule as compared to Western living and how the two societies attempted to merge together into one. Was a good compliment to the books that we also read about the transition.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Well written narrative of a dog. Easy to read. Couldn't put it down. I'll probably read it again. Thank you.
0812550706|5.0|I was supposed to read this book for a class, and ended up being unable to put it down. An excellent read, total pageturner and with an unforseen ending, I would reccommend Ender's Game to both young adult and adult readers. Really enjoyed it!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I thought this book was phenomenal and I recommend to read it·<br /><br />I would read it soon because when you read it, you just can't stop reading it. Also I think it was Jeff Kinney`s best book yet!
