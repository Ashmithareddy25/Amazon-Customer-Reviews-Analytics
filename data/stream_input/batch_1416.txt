B007PTJOV0|4.0|keeps me occupied when there's nothing to do and easy for my kids to play and keep them occupied when needed.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|This Lego product was one of the best ones I have ever built.  It is very durable (with the exception of the tips of the rockets) and has plenty of interactive parts.  My wife and I put this together in about 3 to 3.5 hours, so it is a decently lengthy build and the instructions are very detailed and don't have any ambiguous spots.  I don't recommend this product for heavy play as the connection between the fuel tank and the shuttle is only connected by two little legos and could easily break if mishandled.  The instructions also note to hold it a specific way when it is all connected together to avoid potentially breaking it.  Overall this is a very good Lego and I would highly recommend it.
0345495004|5.0|This book was picked by the girls in my book club for us to read for the month of March.  I was not there to add my vote, and if I was I would not have voted for this book.  BOY!! I am forever grateful for whoever voted this book in!!!  It was fantastic!!  Never thought that this woud be an interesting story. I couldn't have been more wrong.  Frank and Mamah's story had me from the beginning to the end.  And WOW what an ending.  Please if you don't know the ending then do not make the mistake that I made and ruin it for yourself.  I was so interested in Mamah that I googled her and what I read gave away then ending of the book.  I highly reccommend reading this book.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Good Headset.  A little tight around the ear, but sound and bass boost is good.  Solid product for the price.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|A fun, free platformer that has a fair amount of challenge to it.  worth the download.  :)  Basically if Mario were a leprechaun, it would be this game.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I love Star Wars,this looks great and sounds good with the right systems. I recently tried it on my XBOX One and played very well without any problems.
B005XBKXV2|2.0|I love the movie but the quality was very poor and not worth the money. Should have just gone to the store and bought it.
0345803485|3.0|Besides the hot & heavy sex encounters betwn the 2 bunnies, Christian & Ana, the story is entertaining. I give it 4 cuz i thought they jumped into a relationship too fast. It reminds me of the movie 9 1/2 Weeks, Micky Rourke & Basinger. After about 4 chapters, I got REEeeeeL annoyed w/ the author overusing the word \\"FLUSH\\" like in every other paragraph it seems. I got Ana was young & naive, but really, it doesnt have to be said she's \\"flushed\\" a 1000 x's when she's w/ Christian mostly, the actions are good & imaginative enough. The word being overused made me think of the toilet flush, rather than facial blush! It didnt need to be worded over & over again! WE GOT IT!!!
B0052U59F4|5.0|This is one HOT story! It is very well written. I could not put the book down once I started reading it. I had to hurry and buy the second book as soon as I got done with the first. I am in the middle of the second book and will definately buy the third book. I heard this might come out as a movie. I certainly hope it does because I will definately go see it.
B004FOA84A|5.0|I really enjoyed this game.  I hope future games last a little longer, but it had great puzzles and challenges.  I will purchase other games by this company!
B0037VIBGY|4.0|Although the details of this DVD on Amazon indicate that English subtitles are available, only Spanish subtitles exist on this DVD.  Other than that this is a great movie.
B006RS94C4|4.0|It was indeed a learning experience and enjoyable documentary of Phillipe Petite's walk across the two twin towers in N.Y.
B0028SVXR6|4.0|The Mars Volta is experimental.  Those who do not understand this should not listen to them; however, I have been listening and I understand.  Even so, I had a hard time listening to \\"The Bedlam in Goliath\\", the predecessor to \\"Octahedron\\", because of the frenetic pace and the shrieky/nasally vocals.  On Octahedron, they've slowed things down a bit to really let the beauty of the music shine through - and the vocals are a return to form.<br /><br />I was worried for a while there, but Octahedron has restored my faith...and the more I listen, the more I like it.
0312576463|4.0|The elusive search for the Great American novel seemed at an end for the New York Times and other media elites who sprinkled their fairy dust over Mr. Franzen and \\"Freedom\\".  How unfair to him, the book and the many, many great novels and great writers that could have used just a smidgen of the attention lavished on this book.<br /><br />And what a shame for this reader, at least, who had that praise embedded in his brain when finally taking up the novel.  I couldn't help but wait for that rush of greatness, a recognition that Franzen had nailed our society at this moment.  But that rush never came and I wish I had just read the novel keeping in mind that I enjoyed the \\"Corrections\\" but without expectations for more.<br /><br />And here I am well into this review simply talking about my response to the hype and not to the book.  \\"Freedom\\" is a shaggy dog story of a marriage for which the participants have high expectations that are mostly dashed but result in hard-earned humility.  The writing is often quite good.  The theme of selling out gets a work out in a bunch of variations from Richard's silence when his music becomes popular, Patty's deal with her mother to make everyone in her family rich in not quite the way they wanted.  Walter's bizarre devil's bargain with the billionaire energy tycoon to preserve land for his beloved Cerulean Warbler.  Franzen seems to say that selling out is inevitable but there can be dignity in the \\"how, the why and the what\\" of the sellout.<br /><br />\\"Freedom\\" almost got 3 stars from me because I found the tone frequently condescending and smug and the characters wallowing in their overblown self-pity.  But just after a critical plot development that made me roll my eyes and nearly made me give up, the book redeemed itself by revealing a heart and a tenderness in Patty's last autobiographical spasm and in Walter's hermit-like existence on \\"Nameless Lake.\\"<br /><br />So don't fall in the trap that ensnared this reader, banish the hype.ype.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|love it love love love it. Cain like Mario Lol but is pretty good. my number is 939 345 ok call me bye.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I like this game. of course all the games I have played by GAMELOFT have been good to play. the only thing I don't like is the energy thing.
B004XDYJRU|2.0|I got this discounted but feel that its not even worth the 25 cents I paid. You can't &quot;bookmark&quot; and it CONSTANTLY loses the buffer. Don't pause it or you will never get it restarted. Great selection but I can never get it to work consistently, even in my home WITH WI-FI! When I emailed them with my concerns, they thanked me for my inquiries and left it at that. Really need a PODCAST aggregator so that I can listen when I'm able.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this app helps in almost ever way I could possibal ask for and has soo many uses to mu work and just person life
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|Kept seeing this book in stores and looked at it curiously several times -- more than 2 years later I finally felt compelled to pick up the Kindle edition during a sale and devoured it.  I'm not a super-speed reader, by any means, but this is probably the book I've read the fastest due to sheer curiosity to find what happens next.  The Alchemyst is a great story full of adventure, magic, and mysteries. Michael Scott has done an excellent job painting vivid imagery while developing the enchanting world of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel series.  I highly recommend it!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is great for wasting time. it's not really all that related to the original Oregon trail but it doesnt really matter
0553062182|3.0|Pretty much as described, but did have writing in it.  The first test in the book was already completed, which was not<br />disclosed.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|its kinda familiar........ I like it. the theme is funny. what are the shamrocks for just points? that's the only part I don't understand.
B006P0FIB0|2.0|This was a bad movie that I con only imagine the writers were hoping the audience was as dumb as the script. I am only giving 2 stars for the 3d only but the movie and acting itself gets 0 stars.<br /><br />I already wasted my time watching this movie so I don't want to give any more of my time to it in a long review, I just wanted to let others who may be thinking of purchasing this movie to NOT. Rent it if you must but I would still say skip this one all together.<br /><br />For the 3d owners , yes it was clean 3d decent depth, not great, but even if the 3d jumped out and slapped me on the face I still would hate this movie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|points system is a hassle, otherwise this is a fun little series of games that are not frequently boring. not bad for being free.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|love this app. reminds me of super Mario bros. if you like that game,you'll love this. No disappointments with this app.
B006SV2LWA|5.0|If you like Stephen Soderberg movies, you will like this. Don't expect some kind of Spielberg movie...different director, different take on the story. I suspect most of the reviews complaining about the lack of a \\"thriller\\" aspect don't understand that not every movie is directed by Michael Bay or Spielberg. It's a great movie from a great director and a very artful way of dealing with a subject that is normally displayed in the cloy and overused \\"thriller\\" genre that is fed to the public all to regularly by Hollywood. If you appreciate good cinema, you will like this movie.
B006KX3GXO|3.0|This app was great fun! I used it all the time. But for some reason it stopped me from editing pictures. It allowed me to go to my Kindle's picture gallery, it let me select a picture and for some reason it put me back at the menu screen and it darkens. If this is able to be fixed, I would give this five stars for it's abundance of effects and stuff. But I hate it right now. Please fix and I will love it again!
B006ON41FC|5.0|this was the app of the day my friend said it was stupid so I tried it its so addictive and fun its worth 99 cents
B006YMM64G|5.0|Fer shizzle!  was a GOOD movie.. in all kinds of ways...  The Story was good.. the Funny was GoOd.. the Sad was Good... the Happy was Good... be careful it will make your eyes leak.
0143119680|5.0|Any time a book keeps you up until 4am it's good. If it keeps you up two nights in a row and as soon as it's done you want to read it again, it's a winner. This was one of those for me. The pace was quick, the writing was intelligent with lots of historical text references and science (DNA and evolution of the species). The whole time I was reading this one I kept thinking it reminded me of another book I'd read a long time ago. Not in that it was copying, but the writer's style. When Harkness mentions the witch's ability to \\"timewalk\\" I figured it out. This is similar in style to Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series. Her characters are strong, no wimps.<br /><br />We have witches, vampires, daemons and humans as the four species. Diana is a witch and accidentally uncovers a missing text that might hold the key to not only the evolution of the species, but also their destruction. As soon as she brushes with it, she's got the attention of the entire magical world including Matthew Clairmont. There are those who question Matthew's interest in Diana. Is he interested in the book or Diana? If he wants her, will she risk her family's ire to be with him? And the magical creatures' governing body's thousand year old ruling against interspecies relationships is standing directly in their way.<br /><br />This is one I borrowed from the bookstore (one of the perks of working there) but I'm buying it. I'm already looking into the exact release date of book 2, Shadow of Night which is set for this summer.  --HK Savage, author/ publisher Staccato Publishing
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it..I will recommend this game to anyone who is up for a challenge. I play every night before bed.
B003O86FMW|4.0|After much resistance, I have really enjoyed this series. Catching Fire was full of action and twists that may be predictable but still enjoyable.  I am currently reading Mockingjay and so far, I have to say, so far, Catching Fire may be the best of the three.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Just like Mario but with leprocauns ....very very fun love it! Its a recommendation if you have kindle(:.<br />honestly I thought it was gonna be boring but I got it and its very addicting I also recommend where's my water by disney
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game is great to play for a few minutes at a time. Waiting for energy is annoying, but it forces me to put the game down and do more important things. I play it on my Kindle and have so far only had one issue with it restarting while playing this game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it! this game is so much fun. you will never run out of games to play. its also free. and if you rate the game youbget 250000 coins.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I studied the choices for a cover for my Fire and choose this one based on all the good reviews. I ordered it with the Fire and got it at the same time. I think it's a great cover and it works well just as all the other positive reviews say. But last week, while on vacation and reading books a lot, I noticed the finish starting to crinkle and peel offer the cover where my hand is most of the time holding it. I would never had known there was a finish to peel off if it hadn't have happened. I don't intend to switch to something else, but I would like to see Marware improve the product so it stands up to usage.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this app is awesome I love it you have towait a bit but it is fun it is long and keeps you busy
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a great game!! if you like super Mario or games like that you are in luck because this game is just like super Mario.
B000ZLFALS|5.0|I was so happy with the fast shipping and the product! It came jus like it said, new! I opened it and watched it instantly (this being one of my favorite movies) and it worked fantastic!
0060925000|5.0|I read and re read Seth because very few can use the English the language as beautifully as he does and its probably because he writes prose with a poet's mind. Being from the sub continent I can completely relate to every character, nuance and situations - however, I want to ask Mr. Seth why has be plagiarized word to word a very famous scene from the the Indian movie 'Sholay'? The scene itself is extremely famous so was very confused as to why Seth would choose to pick that situation and the dialogues that go with it and make a part of 'his' book?? WHY?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The first book is very well written, imaginative and a good story, hard to put down. Book two, good and by the third, it was getting long and a bit over the top.
B0042J6VUS|4.0|I have ordered the tripod online and have received it in three days. Very cheap, great for taking still pictures with the iphone or any mobile phone! The only issue I found are the expandable legs: they don't stay expanded, they just slide back so you can only take pictures without expanding the legs. The good news is that you can take off the top part, the one the phone slides in and you can screw it to any other tripod, which I did. Overall, it was a great purchase, great delivery!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Decent application.  Yet doesn't have the functionality of the iOS application. Smh...... Why hasn't amazon developed a better app for the Android
0345529057|5.0|In regards to the purchase and delivery, amazon does it again. This arrived on a sunday, I don't even know how that happened, making prime shipping even on the weekend. Very competitive price for 4 books. Book enclosure is paper but holds well on a book shelf. For reviews of the book series use the interwebs.<br />Winter is coming
B005PK1G76|5.0|I bought a Sunshine Kids Stroller accessory from Amazon in the summer of 2011 for $9.98 with free shipping. We liked it so much that I wanted to buy another one for our other stroller. However, as of April 2012, the price for the Sunshine Kids brand has gone up to $23 with shipping. So, I decided to buy the Diono stroller organizer instead (which is $9.98 with free shipping). I received it last week and put it on our new stroller. It is exactly the same as the Sunshine Kids Stroller accessory but less than half the price. I'm a very satisfied customer and have now bought another Diono Buggy Buddy to give to a friend as a shower gift.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|One of the best live dvd's I've watched in a long time.<br />Was'nt a big Adele fan before,but this dvd made me a believer.<br />Better than her studio versions.The bonus cd is like icing on a cake.<br />Could'nt recommend it more.
B002BWP49M|1.0|IF i would of knowen that the blu-ray dvd would of not worked i would of not order it and save my money !! But I LOVE the twilight breaking dawn part 1 and i can hardly wait for the part 2 .
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is really fun n alittle addicting. kindle controls are easy to use. showed this to my wife and she got it for her kindle. now she's hooked. awesome app for free!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|good time waster<br />good on train and between commercials.<br />in game cash expenditures are unnecessary but usefully.<br />20 minutes average per day.
0670023329|5.0|An amazing book I read with bewilderment and discust thinking that humans would be capable of such great, dark evil.  This is happening now.  How many other Camp 14`s exist in this world? Makes you wonder.  I hope this book will be widely read and shared so this can be the beginning of the end of the North Korean regime and that North Korean people will be liberated and set free from the hellhole prison of a country they live in. They spend billions on rockets yet most no food, let alone anything else.  I knew North Korea was evil, but the great depth of that evil is clearly portrayed here.  Please read this book! Lets collectively all do something to give voice to those who are beneath the law and live as slaves in North Korean prison camps.
B005XN0SGU|5.0|I use Comixology for my new comic purchases, but I have a bunch of .CBR and .CBZ files that I wanted to read on my Fire also.  The Perfect Viewer app is a great comic reader.  The Bookshelf keeps everything neatly arranged and ordered.  Well worth the $2.99.
B005IF5H2S|5.0|love the songs, easy to download and burn into a cd so I to listen to it in my way to and from work. love it!!!
1451673442|5.0|I remain optimistic, during my reading I've had three (small) windfalls. I am excited about my completion of the exercises given. There is gratification in learning about myself and the universe!
0307719219|5.0|In Why Nations Fail, Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson nicely summarize a decade plus of research into the institutional causes of economic success/failure at the national level. They take too much credit for it themselves, however, and appear bent on stiffing the contributions of scholars at New York University. They cite only one book by Bill Easterly and nothing by myself (I taught at NYU from 2003-2009), George Smith, Richard Sylla, or David Stasavage. I'll let those guys speak for themselves, but I'm miffed that DA and JAR did not cite my 2008 One Nation Under Debt (a copy of which I mailed DA in 2009), which clearly presages their argument and even some of their examples (though it uses the term predatory instead of extractive government). And I am saddened that they ignored my suggestion in my 2010 book Fubarnomics (esp. pp. 233-35) that it may be possible to compensate dictators in such a way to induce them to behave in an enlightened fashion, or in DA and JAR's lingo to give up extractive practices and policies. I don't know if these fellows simply snub their noses at NYU, don't read very widely (being very conversant with the literature, I don't find their bibliography impressive at all), or are in this game to aggrandize themselves rather than to improve the world and the lives of the people living in it. That criticism aside, I DO recommend this book to any lay reader interested in understanding why real per capita incomes vary by two orders of magnitude globally ($100s in some places, $1,000s in some others, and $10,000s in a few) because they're right.
B006Z21ZGK|4.0|I appreciate Iron Maiden releasing this concert video because when I went to the first show of this tour in Dallas, I witnessed the live debut of \\"El Dorado\\" and an average at best song list that contained no classics until the last four songs (the same on this set).  \\"The Final Frontier\\" is Maiden's best album in a long time, and their live selections from it are good, but one of the top two songs \\"Isle of Avalon\\" is strangely missing.  The video and sound quality are excellent just like the \\"Flight\\" Blu-ray.  There are a lot of split/multi-screen shots which offer a unique perspective.  The only drawbacks:  \\"Dance of Death\\" - never got into it, it's a mediocre regurgitation of \\"Number of the Beast\\"; I loathe Janick Gers and his buffoonery, stage antics, posturing, and butchering of Adrian Smith's solos.  I give credit for the band as a whole to put out another good concert video with an enthusiastic audience.  Additionally, they again add some nice extras including an interesting documentary to complete a solid package.  Maiden has always done a good job in catering to its fans...albeit a few too many \\"best hits\\" albums.  I have been watching their videos for 25 years and highly recommend this one for Iron Maiden fans.
B006Z7Z3R2|3.0|[[ASIN:B002OVO17Q The House of the Devil [Blu-ray]]] was the first movie I saw by Ti West, I could not believe what I was watching, I picked it up on a whim and was caught off guard. It was a fantastic throwback to 80's style horror flicks. I immediately went out and grabbed [[ASIN:B000GH3CMK The Roost]] and [[ASIN:B001152TK2 Trigger Man]] which were both decent movies. Needless to say I had high expectations for The Innkeepers. The story is very simple, you have two employees finishing out the last weekend of a closing Inn, in their free time they are searching out the murdered ghost of the Inn. To say I was disappointed is wrong I just felt like there could have been more, the ending honestly felt contrived. The two main characters who played Claire and Luke did a fine job, the acting was great for a b-movie, they seemed very genuine towards each other. My problem is where The House of the Devil was full of atmosphere, this movie was completely lacking any sort of ambiance. I was shocked that it seemed more lighthearted as though there is an innocence to the horror genre. Claire was lovably innocent, I honestly felt myself enjoying Claire more and more as the movie continued. The juxtaposition between the ghost story and the everyday characters just never seemed to mesh well together. I'm trying not to contradict myself here because I absolutely enjoyed the characters, the story itself is what seemed to be tacked on. Most of the movie is pure character building, the real meat of the story doesn't start until the latter part of the film. There really aren't tense moments and there are only a real handful of intentional jump scares you can see coming a mile away. Yes, this is better than most of the Hollywood drivel that passes as horror now-a-days and if I were to judge this in comparison to something like Scream 4 it would get a 5-star rating, but I'm not. Is this a terrible movie? No. But, should you go out of your way to watch this? No. If you like the oeuvre ofTi West by all means check it out, if your looking for the next House of the Devil keep looking.  Ti West stated he was making a \\"Charming Ghost Story\\" and that is exactly what you get.
0547258305|5.0|This book twists, and turns, and flips with a heroine you cheer for, a falling in love scene that just blew me away (not with kisses, or anything like that, but with tension, and drama, and subtle words, actions and heartbeats. I've bought this book and recommended it for any who will take it and listen. The plot--amazing. Once you think you KNOW where it's going it slams you in another direction. I'd write more but part of the fun of this book is NOT knowing, and turning pages, and saying OH. MY. GOD! Also the bad guy, I won't even say who he is because at the beginning he's not who you think he is...he's so twisted and bad by how he was born...you can't really get this character out of your head. Not your typical bad guy. There's a reason this book is at the top and has been for so long. SIGH. READ IT. xo
B0057VDGNK|3.0|This soundtrack is really great.  My only complaint is most of the \\"songs\\" are more ambient tracks from the movie rather then actual songs.  But overall it was a good purchase.  I really liked this soundtrack, & I loved this movie!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is so much fun. Although the worm one is hard it is so fun. it is the best game ever. Thanks Nordcurrent Ltd!!!
B0073XORCY|5.0|This is a tightly cohesive concept album. A fine follow up to the original, while also standing on its own quite nicely.<br />A nice blend of the old Tull sound and the new modern Ian sound.<br />Highly recommended!
0385738773|3.0|SPOILEEERRRRSSSSS!!! SA-PA-OIL-ERRRRRRRRSSSS  DON'T READ IT IF YOU DON'T WANT SSSSPPPOOOIIIILLLLEEEEERRRRSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />It started out well enough. In fact most of the plot for the first 3/4 was great. There were some sad moments with Newt and there was some good action and whatnot. But there were some things that didn't sit right with me; there wasn't nearly as much character development and interaction as there had been in the first two books. There were alot of \\"somehow\\"s. \\"Somehow Thomas managed to fight them off\\", \\"Somehow he Minho jumped high enough to reach the rising helicopter\\", \\"Somehow Thomas managed to evade gunfire whilst he played chess with God and defeated the entire Swedish army\\". It's not even physically possible for the characters to have survived as long as they did. And Dashner likes to shove things that he doesn't feel like talking about into a corner, doesn't he? But it overall the first 3/4 were good.<br /><br />And then along came the ending.<br /><br />No. Just no.<br /> 1)Theresa dies after being shoved into a corner for the entire book without so much as a paragraph about Thomas's emotions afterward.<br />2)Thomas decides to let Minho think that his best friend in the world died a slow and painful death after slowly spiraling into the depths of insanity.<br /><br />3) When WICKED stuck all of the munies in the maze, frypan and some of the girls from group B were there with them. So you mean to tell me that there were multiple people who knew how to get out of the maze in the group and yet they did nothing? Seriously? No grievers, no walls shifting, nothing standing in their way and yet they did nothing at all. Apparently the main characters are the only ones who know how to take care of things for themselves<br /><br />4)They had a device that could shut down guns. GUNS. Present day, mechanical handguns. Their excuse? They run off of a computer. What the HELL? Guns do NOT run off of computers.  They never have, and they never will. There's no good reason for it. This might be the most obvious plot device that I have ever seen.<br /><br />5)Group B? Whatever just throw them in the corner until the end of the book. They aren't important<br /><br />6) Apparently, WICKEDs idea of a happy ending is sending 250 people to start anew in some random corner of the world while the rest of the human population dies slowly, painfully, and violently.<br /><br />7) So THIS was W.I.C.K.E.D's plan all along? Then WHY THE HELL DID YOU BOTHER?! Why the maze? Why the scorch? Why the EVERYTHING! Congratulations, Dashner, in the very last page of your trilogy, you've managed to turn every single part of the entire thing into irrelevant and nonsensical  bull****.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|awesome game. if you like super Mario,  you will love this game. wellnworth the time spent playing. I highly reccomend you download this game.
1600243711|1.0|I didn't want to read this book. But unfortunately for me, everybody else in my school book club did. I tried to keep an open mind, but I wasn't expecting much. I didn't get much.<br /><br /> The characters were completely flat. The eeeevil ex-husband who likes alcohol and taking pictures of naked women from behind bushes. Mr.Attractive, who's strong, sensitive, fluent in Japanese, a virtuoso, strong, and brave. Ms. Attractive, who's only trait is pretty, and Ms. Attractive's son, a generic, flat, misunderstood little boy who doesn't even have a purpose in the story.<br /><br /> The writing is absolutely awful. Sparks describes all of the unimportant s*** that we can figure out for ourselves and leaves everything else to the imagination. Like when Ms. Attractive was making ice cream. She puts in crushed ice. She puts in cream. She puts in eggs. She puts in more ice. Good God, nobody cares.<br /><br /> The dialogue might be worse. There's a formula; Question about your life, sarcastic and/or lighthearted answer that isn't funny, giggle, question about your life, serious answer, nod/generic acknowledgement,Question about your life, sarcastic and/or lighthearted answer that isn't funny, giggle.<br /><br /> I don't really understand why people like this book. It's like if any 2 living creatures f**** each other, the fan girls are happy. Nobody else in my book club liked it except for like, 2 or 3 people out of 15. I'm going to go sell this to a used book store.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some of the games are interesting but some are just dumb. however it can be addicting trying to get through them all.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|Holy balls, it wasn't that good. At all. The writing was average. The plot was average and the pacing was awful. The characters were straight up terrible. I hated every single one of them except for Haymitch. So really, I didn't care what happened to them. I was kind of hoping they would all die except for Haymitch. And whether you think this is a good thing or a bad thing, it wasn't as violent as everyone claims it is. Try reading Gone or Escape from the Furnace, then you can tell me how violent The Hunger Games is. So will everybody calm down, please? I really can't take it anymore.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Takes me back to when you had to put those little round silver things into machines to play games like this. And at an awesome price!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it's fun and I haven't had a problem yet. I really enjoy the game! so fun. it is just annoying to wait for the energy updates sometimes.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this game is a pretty fun game but I have a kindle fire and I have to shut it down every time I am don playing. over all a pretty fun game.
B003K16P50|3.0|This book reads more like a screenplay than an actual novel.  There is almost no character development of the most interesting person in the story, the wealthy individual from Yemen who finances the project.  The title was perhaps the most interesting part of the novel.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love the game because I like the song when you open it.and I also like it because I like to do the golden egg stages.
B0000UJL96|5.0|This is one of my very favorite Star Trek movies, as I only ordered the ones that William Shatner is in.  price great and in excellent condition! was packaged and received way before promised date. Thank you for your service and promptness.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I really like this game because the angry birds<br />look like super heroes.I also like the game because the ice bird looks cool.plus l also like the hd.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|If you love the Beatles like I do, you will absolutely love this movie!!  I grew up listening to them and it was great to see a story behind the songs.  Great movie.  I recommend it especially to couples.  Great \\"date\\" movie.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|When I was in the 7th grade my english teacher had the entire class write a book together.  One student would write a chapter then the next student would pick it up and write the next chapter so forth and so on.  The plot was quickly lost and main characters were killed off at random and others created out of thin air.  Our book did have a conclusion though so I would have given it two stars just for leaving the reader with a sense of completion. That is what this book reminds me of!<br /><br />I seriously doubt that this \\"trilogy\\" will have any conclusion whatsoever. I don't know for sure if GM even knows what his next book is going to be about and just writes random stuff as he thinks it up filling the book with meaningless fluff.  Unfortunately the plot never gets progressed and the story is just getting too cumbersome to hold my interest.<br /><br />The older story lines have all but vanished without a trace, like whats the point of giving the Starks these skinchanger gifts if they never influence the plot? Same thing with bran and wierwoods. The first main characters or those that remain I should say are becoming meek and ineffective while the new ones aren't given the background and depth that the previous ones had.  In summation I'm afraid that GM might just be milking this cash cow and losing fans for it all along the way.
B0000AUHOH|5.0|collection.  Only collect ones that Shatner is in.  Don't particularly care for the other &#34;new&#34; Trek ones.  Only Shatner. He is the best.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|super super cool i loved it!!! such a funny game!!!  u should all try a little... i just cant stop playing!!!
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|Saw it when it the very day it came out.  It was a fantastic movie, also being a cat lover, I loved that they made a Shrek sequel about Mr. Puss N. Boots.  thank you for the great condition it was in so I can add it to my collection.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|You are complaining that its a mario knock-off but i enjoy that is is similar.i cant get the mario game on my kindle fire
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|I definitely wanted a copy of this one because of the untimely death of Whitney Houston, but it is a great movie too.  Good love story, and the songs are fantastic.  She will be missed very much, but nice to know I can see her on this one and hear her fantastic voice live as well.
B007R41E8O|5.0|By far the best hidden object / adventure game I've played on kindle fire thus far! Easy to navigate and great graphics, puzzles, and story line. LOVED!

B0066W1AZK|4.0|I gave this app 4 stars only b/c I can't seem to play online against friends - but a great app tor a begginer like me!
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Update to the current version that is in the Google Play/Market please. 1.4.4 It keeps trying to update to 1.4.3 here but that's not the current version.
B004J4WNL2|3.0|I have not yet completed this book, but so far, I am a bit disappointed.  It is not at all what I was expecting.  I can only hope that the book will get better.  So far, it is stories about people that are introverts.  I was hoping for some facts or psychological insight into introverts, not stories.
0345803485|2.0|Seriously?  I was stunned at the repetitiveness. Holy Crap, Lip biting, Gray eyes, long fingers, 'there' (for vagina) and I could go on but the book does it for me.  The story is extremely contrived and one dimensional.  The author herself stated in an interview that she based the books off the Twilight series and I should've known then not to buy this as I was bored by those books as well. Too juvenile for me.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|an exciting read. I found it a gutsy effort to be able to say what was said about religion, and criminals. its not what anyone wants to hear, particularly if religion is your thing. it doesnt stop ms moorjani from telling it like it was for her. Offers a tremendous amount of hope and clarity about why we really are here. the effect this book had on me personally was quite healing and profound.
B00002DEQQ|5.0|This is an excellent album. The highlight for me is definitely I'm Left, You're Right, She's Gone with Tom and James Dean Bradfield. The worst tracks are the Robbie Williams and Stereophonics ones for me. If you haven't got this already, check it out!
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|Once more Mr. King surprises with a story that could not make any sense, but he makes it<br />incredibilly believable, as much as possible.<br />Only a master on writing could think and create a book like this.<br />LONG LIVE STEPHEN KING!!!!!
1466401885|4.0|I borrowed this book from a friend, and I really didn't know much about it before I read it. I didn't know what to expect, but I honestly enjoyed it!<br /><br />The book is about a college girl who is trying to start a new life in a new town and in a new university and leave her past life behind. She meets a guy who appears to be a \\"bad boy\\" \\"one-night-stand\\" guy, but in fact is secretly smart and deep. He falls in love with her, but she doesn't want to do anything with him. They try to be just friends but it doesn't seem to ever work out. They move in together, fight, move out, fight, love, fight, and love. They're so bad for each other but they just can't stay away!<br /><br />Anyways... this was a VERY entertaining read! A bit of fantasy there, with a guy wanting to change SO MUCH for a girl, but hey, maybe it can happen. Their tumultuous and volatile relationship was so fun to read. Even though it was a pretty complicated relationship, the author did a really good job of helping us feel everything that was happening. Nothing really felt out of place, and following the story and emotions was easy and fun.<br /><br />I really liked this book and I recommend it! I couldn't put it down! haha
B00127RAJY|5.0|If your are looking to buy this DVD, I'm assuming you are like me and a bit out of shape.  I hadn't worked out for almost 4 years and have had two children in this time.  So you can imagine I was pretty out of the work-out loop.  This is a great video to get you back on track, it's not overly difficult and within a few weeks one can get in the grove of it.  So that you don't get bored, you can move up to the other levels when you are ready for a change - they offer modified movements for beginners at each level. Best of luck to you!
B004I8WLK2|5.0|It is a massive book, that took me close to two months to finish. The amount of information is enormous, mind-boggling. Even though I presumed I knew quite a lot on European political history after WW2 (my background is political science), it was this book that made me aware of how little, in fact, I know, especially about the first decades following The War. I always underline information that is both of relevance and new to me - half of Tony's Judt's book is now underlined.<br /><br />What I didn't know prior to reading this massive work?<br />1) in fact how little attention and effort was spent on evaluating the colaboration with Nazi regimes in Europe - the new Europe was built on the shoulders of former Nazi functionaries (teachers, judges, officials). How much silence on specific biographies underlies the history of post-war Europe<br /> 2) how come there is so little multiethnicity in post-war Europe;<br />3) to what extent the Marshall plan was crucial in rebuilding Europe;<br /> 4) to what extent the rapid development of Switzerland and Sweden depended on the role these two countries played in WW2 by supplying  both sides;<br />5) to what extent the investments made by nazi's in German scientific research, helped post-war Germany to be competitive in business.<br />6) How costly were the colonies for Britain;<br />7) the specifics of French colonialism (colonies as departments), links with the peculiar nature of their state;<br />8)historic reasons on why so much of the EU funds is spent on agriculture;<br />9) the shock that leftists of the west felt after the events of 1956 in Hugary; how they changed the public opinion;<br />10) extent of unemployment in Portugal, Greece before 1970 (one third of Portugal's workforce worked abroad)<br />11) racism and ethnic discrimination in UK and Switzerland less than 50 years ago;<br />12) eugenics in Europe;<br />13) the double standarts of western leaders regarding soviet regimes, human rights issues;<br />14) different approaches towards privatisation in 1980's;<br />15) the scepticism in the West regarding whether Germany should be reunited after 1989;<br />16) Holocaust - how hard it still is for many countries involved to admit the guilt also of their societies. How long it took for some (France, Netherlands,  Austria)...<br /><br />And there is so much, much more!  And it is all written in clear, easy to read style. The book is filled not just with actions, facts, but also intellectual history of Europe.  Yes, from time to time you get the sense of the author's own stance on the issues, but it is never all-pervasive and always substantiated. I believe it adds to the quality of the book.erent approaches towards privatisation in 1980's;<br />15) the scepticism in the West regarding whether Germany should be reunited after 1989;<br />16) Holocaust - how hard it still is for many countries involved to admit the guilt also of their societies.

0385344228|5.0|Don't get me wrong - this is a perfect detective, court-drama, thriller! But in the end I took away 2 messages:<br />1) \\"I do not believe in the court system, at least I do not think it is especially good at finding the truth. No lawyer does. We have all seen too many mistakes, too many bad results. A jury verdict is just a guess - a well-intentioned guess, generally, but you simply cannot tell fact from fiction by taking a vote. And yet, despite all that, I do believe in the power of the ritual. I believe in the religious symbolism, the black robes, the marble-columned courthouses like Greek temples. When we hold a trial, we are saying a mass. We are praying together to do what is right and to be protected from danger, and that is worth doing whether or not our prayers are actually heard.<br />2) \\" The law is very unforgiving of 'yes, but' defenses. Yes, but I had bad childhood. Yes, but I had bave a mental disease. Yes, but I was drunk. Yes, but I was carried away by anger. If you commit a crime, the law will say you are guilty despite these things. But it will take them into account when it comes to the precise definition of the crime and when it comes to sentence. At that point, anything that affects your free will - including a genetic predisposition to violence or low impulse control - at least theoretically can be taken into account.\\"
B002R88G5E|5.0|Brilliant! A great story line that is very thought provoking and well worth reading. 'A Thousand Splendid Suns' leaves the reader grateful for the wonderful lifestyle we all too often take for granted and shows the innocence of those exposed to war through no fault of their own.
0375869026|5.0|This is a book on a terribly deformed child, but it is so much more than just that! It addresses the insecurities of school-age childhood  from the perspective of several storytellers. And in the end The Wonder is all about this message:<br />\\"If every single person in this room made it a rule that wherever you are, whenever you can, you will try to act a little kinder than is necessary - the world really would be a better place. And if you do this, if you act just a little kinder than is necessary, someone else, somewhere, somedy, may recognize in you, in every single one of you the face of God.\\"
0596005903|5.0|This is a great book if you want to learn about Linux device drivers. The book covers the 'old' model (kernel 2.6). If you are an expert in Linux device drivers, you may want to get a book that covers the new model. But if you have some Linux system programming experience, and want to learn about programming drivers in kernel space, this is a great book.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a really fun game! if you liked Mario bros you will love this!I love this game! hope they make more games like this!
B00701QVVY|2.0|For a long time I've supported Overkill because they were still doing thrash when it was going through an unpopular period, and I respect that... but I think they've been riding on that for too long, because each album sounds more and more just like a rehash of their previous stuff.  And this really sounds like they've run out of ideas completely.  It sounds like they were filling a contract to get an album out or something, with nothing inspired about it.  It's on passionless auto-pilot... and if they don't care about what they're playing, why should I?  I got really bored listening to this one.<br /><br />It's not that it's BAD, there's just no reason to buy it if you bought their last 3-4 albums, because this is very midline by-the-numbers stuff with no standout tracks.  It's all proficiently played - they're pros and I'd expect no less - but mediocre material played well is still mediocre.  And I'm sorry, but Blitz's lyrics are just getting stupid.  He's never been a terribly smart guy to begin with, but this is just, uhhhhh... it's starting to get embarrassing, and the shout-along stuff makes it seem even sillier.  His singing style's wearing thin, too... he's doing a Hetfield and becoming a parody of his own vocal tics.<br /><br />It was a good ride for a long time, but it's probably time to call it a day for Overkill.  See ya, guys, I'm off this bandwagon.
0345803485|2.0|From the get-go Christian Grey is willing to go wherever Anastasia Steele is and do whatever she wants. He's determined to own her in any and every way possible.<br /><br />Equally early on, Anastasia Steele is uncomfortable with her feelings for Christian Grey, scandalized by the kind of sex life he wants them to have, and irritated by the extent to which he wants to control her life.<br /><br />If he weren't an extraordinary specimen of manhood with charm and money to boot this story wouldn't have taken place, because Anastasia Steele would have been as indifferent to him as she is to every other male in her life that has wanted to be more than friends.<br /><br />The author does speak about the chemistry Anastasia has with Christian from the moment they meet and that it reveals itself as a current of electricity running through her when they touch for the first time. Anastasia herself speaks of the feelings and sensations Christian awakens in her that nobody before him has, but her constant mention of his beauty makes the reader feel that his looks are the first and foremost thing on her mind when she's around him.<br /><br />The fact that both behave as petulant children masquerading as consenting adults does make them a match made in heaven, though.<br /><br />He's willing to drop everything for her, constantly tells her how enthralled he is by her, is enthusiastically trying to prevent her from ever being able to comfortably sit again, and she's not sure what he feels for her (?!?!).<br /><br />She, on the other hand, is convinced his dominant-submissive lifestyle as well as other emotional quirks are a result of all sorts of hidden trauma and abuse; in other words twisted and cruel, and yet she's willing to give it a try. Why? Because she doesn't want to lose him she tells herself and the reader, but the sequence of events in the novel say otherwise. They indicate that she's insecure beyond measure and that the thought of being entitled to such a gorgeous man has her going down whatever path is necessary.<br /><br />Throughout the odd actions they take to establish their relationship, these two talk and write to death. Their so called feelings are dissected to an unhealthy extent; they stop adding anything new almost from the beginning and are just re-hashing the same argument over and over. Their relationship is going nowhere except where their fancy-of-the-day takes them but they think all their nonsensical babble is actually moving them beyond constant sex.<br /><br />Since \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" is the first book in a trilogy, I guess Christian and Anastasia's relationship is going somewhere. How interested I am in reading through more 1-word sentences, in enduring more endless descriptions of Christian Grey's beauty, or in pitying/mocking Anastasia's \\"inner goddess\\", to find out where indeed it's going, is another matter.<br /><br />Alas, my curiosity being what it is and not being immune to an intensely passionate and beautiful man expressing his love, I read the first chapter of the next 2 books in the trilogy to get a feel of what could be in store and if I would be intrigued enough to read them.<br /><br />Sorry to say that those first chapters were more of the same: Christian is drop-dead-gorgeous, Anastasia is constantly insecure. He wants to own her; she doesn't know anything except he's the most handsome man she's ever known.<br /><br />I think if the author had focused on more \\"showing\\" than \\"telling\\" this novel could have been an exhilarating ride. Anastasia would have had to be a more perceptive woman for that, though. She would have had to be better equipped for describing those very famous \\"shades of grey\\". That would have made her more interesting and it would have made Christian Grey simply irresistible.has her going down whatever path is necessary.<br /><br />Throughout the odd actions they take to establish their relationship, these two talk and write to death.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a challenging  game that make you think. It is similar to the original game, with a few new wrinkles.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I really like my cover for my Kindle. Love the color and the fact that you can prop up your Kindle Fire when your reading or watching movies is great.
0553801503|4.0|Not much really happens here. It is a great deal of talking, walking, and exposition. That said, it's hardly boring. The dialogue is fantastic, as always, and the character development more than makes up for the lack of action. Ultimately,  A Feast for Crows sets the stage for A Dance with Dragons, adding new characters, giving us more on the older ones, and getting everyone where they need to be for the next book.
B004CFAWK2|5.0|I loved this book. I only wish I had read it 10 years ago when I heard about it! Fannie Flagg is just brilliant. She just captures this human spirit in all her characters, who are each so different from each other. I can't wait to read this again.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is very fun. because you are a leprechaun and you jump and stuff and also you ill snails...snails are icky
B000W9DSVW|5.0|this is such an awesome collection of three BluRay discs that I got on a deal for 14 bucks recently. the movie makes a lot sence when you watch one after another. I rememebre watching the Ocean's Twelve and couldn't remember why Benedict was following all the 11 people, becuase by then I had already forgotten the Eleven movie events (I have a poor movie memory). So, watching one after another made a lot of sence and the watching experience much more fun. Bottom line, amazing collection and worth watching all three moies!

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|this is a fun and exciting game. it is quite addicting too as you want to complete the quests and proceed to he next level right away. the downside is that it takes time to reenergize.
0385534639|5.0|This novel is visually stunning.  From the dust jacket art to the embossed cover, it's perfect.  What thrills me is the beauty is carried through the novel in words.  Erin Morgenstern is amazing; simply amazing.  From the first page, she drew me into a world of black & white and vivid color.  If I closed my eyes, I was there.  I wanted to be there.  Oh, how I wished the circus were real.  Everything about this book is magical.  Everything.<br /><br />From the moment I heard about this novel, I was intrigued.  Between the circus setting and the love story, I knew The Night Circus would be pure magic.  And oh, there are so many things that make this novel magical.  I'm not even sure where to begin. Should it be the characters or the concept or the beauty of words Ms. Morgenstern enchants us with?  This novel has it all.  Mystery, betrayal, love, hope.<br /><br />It had so many morsels of goodness too.  By the time I was done, I had so many flags sticking out of the pages it looked more like a college textbook than a novel.  It touched my heart, my soul.  Not only was I transported to a world I wish existed beyond Ms. Morgenstern's imagination, but also I was inspired.<br /><br />I love when she writes \\"There's emotion...It almost contradicts itself. It's as if there is love and loss at the same time, together in a kind of beautiful pain.\\"<br /><br />My favorite chapter in this novel is called Movement. It is when Celia meets Herr Friedrick Thiessen, the clockmaker. Although Celia's heart belongs to another, there is something so wonderful in reading how their friendship began.  How there is mutual respect and admiration between them.  He was one of the few people Celia trusts.  I love how Friedrick  says, \\"Because I do not wish to know. I prefer to remain unenlightened, to better appreciate the dark.\\"<br /><br />And finally I love how Marco builds Celia a ship. \\"Only the ship is made of books, its sails thousands of overlapping pages, and the sea it floats upon in dark black ink.\\"<br /><br />Perfect.  Now go read it.  Trust us.k black ink.\\"<br /><br />Perfect.  Now go read it.  Trust us.

B0068MNO4S|3.0|this movie was okay, story wise and history wise this movie is excellent but it was so boring, it was slow and it took forever to get to the good stuff. i'm not going to lie the actors were great and the story was great. but if you are not really into shakespear then this movie is not for you. but if you are then you'll love this movie. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you don't
B000EGEVZK|2.0|While I was satisfied with my overall experience of ordering online, I received a DVD that I cannot watch in the U.S. The viewing country/region code was not explained or addressed in my ordering. Since I have not ordered any DVD's before, I did not know that this was even an option. So, while I received a perfectly good copy of a DVD that can be viewed by SOMEONE SOMEWHERE, I cannot view it. Not happy about that, but I guess I just learned a lesson.
B0069UP2PI|3.0|this was an okay movie, i found it pretty boring, the only good thing i can say about this film si that it's realistic even though it's a fiction story, and how is it a science fiction movie, i would of labled it a meystery, because the whole movie was about what the virus was. one thing to think about from this movie is what if that is the way the world ends, we catch a very bad virus and can't find a cure for it. the story was good just it was boring. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you don't
B007IXWKUK|1.0|For starters I enjoyed the premise of this series. I enjoyed the first book a lot for what it was. If you are looking for a great piece of literature this is not it (regardless of what other reviews say). I think the author uses big words just to prove that she knows big words because a lot of times they seem forced.<br /><br />I started reading this series and was excited as someone into the BDSM lifestyle to read a story about how they managed a normal relationship but a D/s sexual relationship. Well this did not quite offer that. They basically show that if you like this lifestyle you have some deep-seeded psychological issue and some trauma that makes you like this. And I do not agree with that at all and quite frankly it's insulting.<br /><br />I've bought the 3rd book mostly because I was curious to see if things changed, if there was more of a showing of having the normal relationship and a more D/s sex life but I haven't finished it yet.<br /><br />And since this is the Kindle edition review I will comment on the fact that you can't loan the book. I am so angry by that I can't even tell you. I paid 9.99 for this book and it bothers me that I can't loan it to a friend. And the fact that even if I could I could only loan it to one friend? So angry. If I bought the paperback (WHICH WAS CHEAPER) I could loan it to 100 people. The publishers have a lot of nerve charging 9.99 each book to begin with but then to not even allow a lending? I wish I would have realized what the lending periods were really like before I bought a Kindle because I would not have had I known it was like this.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is awesome! great graphics, smooth gameplay and works great on the kindle fire! loved playing mario as a kid and this game is very similar to that. great game!

B005JR4LUY|4.0|This is a very heart warming book for all ages. love the wonderful way the Author describes the dances and the scenery. I am lucky enough to live in a small town in Oregon and know the area well. The beach scene was also spot on although we have wonderful weather here too. what a way to get even, without anyone actually getting hurt.
145162445X|3.0|The book is an excellent summary of the current notions of cosmology.  The Big Bang happened 13.7 billion years ago.  While it touches on some technical material, including graphs and jargon such as Cephied variable stars, parsecs, redshift, he explains these in terms that an interested non-technical person can understand.  But he labors unsuccessfully to explain what he means by nothing.    Since this is in the title, it should be clear what his nothing means.  \\"By nothing, I do not mean nothing, but rather nothing -- in this case, the nothingness we normally call empty space.  That is to say, if I take a region of space and get rid of everything within it -- dust, gas, people, and even the radiation passing through, namely absolutely everything within that region -- if the remaining empty space weighs something, then that would correspond to the existence of a cosmological term such as Einstein invented.\\" [page 58]    Well, weighing empty space and saying it corresponds to a Cosmological Constant term in one of Einstein's equations is a little hard to follow.  I think he means that the empty universe is not collapsing, and so something in the nothing keeps it expanding.  He spends many pages in the chapter wading through speculations about relativity, quantum mechanics, and virtual particles, while along the way paying homage to scientists such as Einstein, Dirac, Heisenberg, and Feynman.  In the end he must admit, \\"In spite of the fact that we have had no idea how to solve the problem for more than forty years, we theoretical physicists knew what the answer had to be ... when an ultimate theory is derived, it would explain how the effects of virtual particles would cancel, leaving empty space with precisely zero energy.\\" [page 73]    In this and many other places in the text Professor Krauss seems to be saying, we should take what physicists believe, rather than what they can prove.    Krauss brooks no hint that any other cosmology theory exists.  What he knows is all that we need to know.  I hope he has looked into other theories.  For example, the basis for the entire big bang theory is the interpretation of light -- the cause of the redshift. If there are alternative causes of the redshift, then we need another cosmology.  Alternative causes of the redshift are described in the following video: [...].    The following book is a complete and somewhat technical description of the Big Bang theory: [[ASIN:0007162219 Big Bang: The Origin of the Universe (P.S.)]]
B006JTS5OO|5.0|This is a truly entertaining movie.  My 7-year old thought it was going to be \\"lame\\" but she actually begged me to see it a second time! There are some parts that I wish were better (more Gonzo!) but overall, I'm so happy with this movie and hope that more are to come!  I really enjoyed the 80's songs that were interwoven, such as \\"We Built this City\\" and the original song \\"Me Party.\\"  I liked Amy Adams before this movie... I love her now!!  Go Kermit!
0756655307|4.0|This book is a great collection of characters.  It gives a pretty good background of each character but the description do jump around to many story lines and can be confusing(especially someone not into the history of comic book storylines).  Overall it was exactly what I was looking for.

B005PMNBNG|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've bought in a long time. 80's synth sounds, difficult to understand lyrics, nostalgia. It's great. Give it a listen.
B006JTIZGM|4.0|This is a great book, and the content is excellent. It's the best book on OOP I've ever seen, and I've read a few. However, it has one feature that is completely frustrating. There seems to be no way to bring up the table of contents, unlike other Kindle books I've read. That means that trying to jump back to a previous chapter seems to require scrolling back through hundreds of pages. Why can't the navigation be functional? Otherwise, it's a must read.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|throwback to better days!  I can play this for hours while I wait for my mom to yell at me to do my homework and go to bed. ahhhhh, nostalgia ..
B006VC3LES|5.0|I've seen Chinatown in the theatre and in every format including laserdisc since then.  I'm SO glad for this Blu-Ray edition which allows us to finally see the colours as originally intended.<br /><br />The extras are thankfully lengthy and informative including the history of the Los Angeles aqueduct which provided a valuable understanding of the importance of water in Chinatown and the characters who used it for their financial gain.<br /><br />This film is right up there on the list of great American films. The sumptuous colour doesn't detract from this being a wonderful modern film noir.

0670023329|4.0|I've been interested in North Korea for a while, having seen some documentaries and read articles on life there, but never had I been able to read an account of someone who had actually been imprisoned there and escaped to the West. I read this in two sessions over a weekend as I couldn't put it down, a testament to the power of the story as well as the skill in its telling. It's not a first hand account as such because Shin Dong-hyuk has been reluctant to write his own story and hasn't learned English, so journalist Blaine Harden does an admirable job of telling Shin's harrowing tale while also filling in details of certain aspects that provides the reader with a pertinent historical context. The story of Shin's life growing up in Camp 14 lacks the autobiographical minutiae that comes from a memoir, however the objectivity that Hardin brings as the author relaying Shin's story adds a deeper, perhaps even more profound layer, that can only come the observational and analytical eye of an outsider. What moved me most was the description of Shin after his escape, in his struggles to adapt to open society in the South and in the United States, leaving the reader with the impression that his physical imprisonment was only half the ordeal and now comes the longer and more arduous quest for psychological freedom.<br /><br />On a personal note, what struck me as most harrowing was the revelation that Shin made his escape from the camp, seeking a path north to China in January 2005, which just so happened to be the very month I was in Beijing and Shanghai, blissfully unaware that while I was visiting museums, walking along the Great Wall, sleeping in late in my comfortable hotel room, somewhere not so far away, Shin was fighting for his life to get to where I was holidaying so that he may hope to live without daily brutality, hunger and misery.<br /><br />I never want to be so ignorant ever again.<br /><br />And yet, still this nightmare continues in North Korea right now asI write this review and what are Western governments doing to stop it? Do we, the people, living in relative freedom, luxury and comfort, really care about the Shin Dong-hyuks of this world? Sadly, the answer to both these questions seem shamefully self-evident.<br /><br />That Shin escaped, survived and lives in freedom today, gives us some hope that no matter how bleak and horrific a situation may appear to be, as long as the heart still beats change is always possible.
B006FTC2ZG|3.0|This wads wonderful movie about true friends and true love. Anne Hathaway was wonderful with her British accent.  The movie was different and surprising. Get your tissues, because you will need them.

B0077ZNCE2|3.0|I have followed the Twilight movies for years. I am a big fan of the love story between Bella and Edward. Part one left me wanting more. I cannot wait to see the final chapter.
B0052U59F4|5.0|This book was a big surprise.  When I started reading it I thought it was just another lusty, sex driven romance novel.  NOT!!  Imagine my surprise when I began to read well written passages of deep psychological need, mystery and intrigue.  When this book ended so abruptly, it was like being slammed against a brick wall and left there.  It was a total shock!  I could not get it out of my mind.  Imagine my delight and excitement when I found there was a second and third sequel.  I can't say enough about my enjoyment of these novels, and I am the one that is most surprised by it.  The sexual content would have been extremely repulsive written in any other way. Don't stop reading it until you've read the whole thing!
B006VC3LES|5.0|1974 was a big year for Paramount Pictures. Three of their films were up for a Best Picture Oscar including this one(the other two were \\"The Godfather, Part II\\" and \\"The Conversation\\" both directed by Francis Ford Coppola). If you factor in \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\"(also released in 1974)then you could say that Paramount(under Production Head Robert Evans) really did care about quality in their films. All the films I've just listed are now considered classics. Most have been released on Blu-ray(the exception being \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\"). Last week's blu-ray release of \\"Chinatown\\" was welcome news. I remember seeing \\"Chinatown\\" at the Cinema 21(sadly torn down shortly after a six month run of Cameron's \\"Titanic\\") in San Diego and although I didn't understand the picture, I certainly enjoyed it's film noir look of Los Angeles in a hot Summer of 1937. That look and other details are retained in this outstanding blu-ray release by the restorers at Paramount, who did a superb restoration of Hitchcock's \\"To Catch a Thief\\" last month(see my review). I've owned every format of \\"Chinatown\\" since it's release. In fact, one of the first things I did in 1974 was to get a copy of Jerry Goldsmith's haunting and classic score(on vinyl) just to hear that opening trumpet solo again. According to one of the special features(there are about six of them) he wrote the score in nine days at the last minute and the minute the film starts, it sets the mood of the film. I won't go into the story since it took so long for me to figure out what was going on(a tribute to Robert Towne's Oscar winning screenplay) but it's basically about power and betrayal with water thrown into the mix. Lots of water. Other reviewers of the blu ray have commented on the blu ray's aspect ratio. The one I watched was 2.35 which is true to Roman Polanski's panavision version of the film. There is some film grain in certain scenes but this may have more to due with John Alonzo's photography of the film than anything else. For the most part, the colors are sharp and sometimes jump off the screen. Paramount has given this Blu-ray a high Bitrate(33.33) and the results are very impressive. \\"Chinatown\\" probably hasn't looked this good since I first saw it back in 1974. One thing that I noticed this time more than the other dozen times I've watched \\"Chinatown\\" was how well Jack Nicholson and Faye Dunaway looked in their costumes. You can see every little detail on the ties that Nicholson's character Jake Gittes wears in every scene. He changes clothes a lot from scene to scene and his suits compete with Richard Sylbert's elegant production design for the film. Sylbert makes Los Angeles look beautiful on Blu ray. Nicholson and Dunaway do some of their best work in this picture as does the rest of cast. It was good to see Perry Lopez, Joe Mantell and John Huston(sadly all passed away now) in their supporting parts. Once again I'd like to thank the restorers at Paramount for providing another superb restoration title on blu ray. \\"Chinatown\\" on blu ray is a must own for any film collectors library.

1594744769|3.0|One needs imagination for this book.  Thank goodness it wasn't very long.  It took awhile to figure out that you were in a Harry Potter type book.  The author is definitely creative and imaginary.  I'm over 60 - I like mysteries - so this was rather strange - but the author was creative.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The first two books were adventurous, and very entertaining. The third book....where do I begin.. I'll just say I wish the series had ended with the second book. I don't understand why strong female characters have to always have severe mental health issues.
B002BWP49C|5.0|The Twilight Saga movies as well as the books are my favorites!  Stephenie Meyer, the author of the books, is a very inspired author with a fabulous imagination.  Her books have the classic impossible romance of a teen-aged girl in love with the impossibly handsome vampire; the actors chosen to portray these characters are very beievable, and these are very popular movies with a built-in cult fan base of all those readers who loved the books and want to see their imagination fulfilled.  In this 4th installment of the movies based on the books, we have the long-awaited beautiful wedding of Edward Cullen and his love, Bella Swan, then there's the third person in the triangle, Jacob, the Indian/werewolf/shape shifter also in love with Bella.  There's the rest of the Cullen family who are just as amazing, then there's Bella's father, the inimitable Chief of Police of the authentic town of Forks, Washington, who lends a comic touch in giving a toast to the groom reminding him that he \\"can shoot a gun and can follow him to the ends of the earth because he's a cop\\"!  Then there's the honeymoon location (a surprise to Bella) on a deserted island named \\"Isle Esme\\" (a gift to Edward's \\"mother\\" Esme from her handsome vampire husband, Doctor Carlisle Cullen).  With Edward's strength, the honeymoon bed is wrecked and Bella awakens the next morning with pillow feathers floating about.  They, unbelievably conceive a child (unheard-of among a vampire married to a human) and go back home to Washington for the difficult pregnancy. A must for anyone who's read the series or is interested in the popular vampire phenomenon.  I, of course, can't wait until the final movie comes out in November, 1 year after Part 1, which I will also buy from my favorite website, Amazon.com, when it's released.

B0072GPQNG|1.0|An overbearing lack of attention to detail and facts by the writers and directors made the farming and horse behaviors seem more Hollywood and NY fictional than real world. The animal (Joey) deserved a lot more honest attention and quality writing.<br />Positive:<br />Costumes.<br />Negatives: A few of the film fantasies.<br />(1.) The movie would have benefited from showing how challenging it is to train a wild animal even from an experienced trainer. The one trick scene of the human not showing predator eyes did not do training a horse any justice.<br />(2.) The first scenes showed a heavily stone strewn field for the horse to pull through which for a first time collar use would have bloodied the animal especially after 12+ straight hours. The stones would have broken the iron plow and probably injured the animal. The larger stones should have been picked out first. That's why the adjoining house and walls are made of stone.<br />(3.) The continual hand broadcasting of handfuls of turnip seeds into a small areas is wasteful and not why the furrows were created.<br />(4.) A son being shown his father's war medals for the first time at age 17 didn't make any sense. Father was simplistically portrayed as distant and cold.<br />(5.) The portrayal of the Germans, for the most part, as ruthless killers stretched credulity. Even the reversal of roles in saving the horse was too Hollywood - bolt cutters anyone.<br />(6.) The french farm girl, Emilie,  while farming was wearing a hair bow, makeup and a perfectly clean dress. The perfect English made her seem more actress than farm girl. That she had never ridden before yet gallops off across fields on her first try is not real. If she doesn't fall the horse would sense an inexperienced rider and throw her. Her death was a wasted storyline. As well as still  another horse auction with her grandfather showing up to bid what would have been a fortune. Just bizarre storytelling and movie editing.<br />(7.) The tank chasing after and projectiles exploding around Joey was just visual fictional cheapening of the animal. A director whose first priority is his own filming recognition.<br />(8.) Final scene of the horse and trainer just happening to be in the same medical staging area was far fetched. And, in his blinded condition, the trainer knew that the horse's markings were covered by mud. That Joey didn't approach his trainer in a natural horse-to-trainer manner didn't look right.<br />(9.) Presenting WWI as trenches, barbed wire and muddy landscape is as old as movies have been around. I've seen the same barbed wire and sand bags for the past 90 years. You would think there would be a lot more to that war. The movie \\"Wings\\" is one example.

B004LWZW4C|4.0|My review is based solely on the X-Men movies and not the comic books or cartoon.<br /><br />I'm not really into super hero movies, nor have I been a true fan of the comic books and cartoon, but the X-Men movies have always had very good story lines in my opinion and I like them.  This film was no different.  The only thing that really gets on my nerves about this film is the massive amount of mistakes.  Do they think we are so stupid not to notice?<br /><br />If you're are going to spend loads of money to make a blockbuster film, at least do your research.  All the writer and/or director had to do was watch the other X-Men movies.  I don't want to give anything away to anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet, but if you have seen the previous X-Men movies you will definitely notice.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!<br /><br />-I don't like the relationship between Charles and Raven.  Nowhere in the previous films did they ever mention these two characters being so close.  In fact, Professor X seems to have had a closer relationship with Eric.<br /><br />-In the first X-Men movie, Charles mentions meeting Eric when he was 17.  He was clearly not 17 when they met in this movie.<br /><br />-Charles said Eric help him build Cerebro.  When?  They became enemies by the end of the film!  Apparently, Hank McCoy was the brains behind everything in this film.<br /><br />-At the beginning of X-Men: Last Stand, Charles and Eric visit the home of Jean Grey and an older, balder Professor X is clearly walking and still friends with Eric.  Yet, in this film the young Professor X becomes paralyzed at the end of the movie.<br /><br />-Also, the relationship between Eric and Charles didn't have enough time to develop in this film.  Are we really supposed to believe the two were such strong friends based on the one mission in this movie?<br /><br />Okay, I'm sure there are tons of other mistakes that I just failed to mention, but these were just the few highly noticeable ones I wanted to share.  That being said, I really did like the movie.  Once again, I thought it had a great storyline, but thought the makers could have been a little more careful when they wrote it.  Which leads me to believe this movie might have been strictly made for profit and not for the purpose of continuing a great entertaining franchise.That being said, I really did like the movie.

B0055SWM08|4.0|make me calm and frustrated. Hahaha! This challenge can be very hypnotizing and slightly addictive. The price is right. $0.00 Give it a try if you want to relax from those hating birds and the violence. :0) ENJOY!
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|Cannot enjoy the game because the energy runs out too fast and I cannot build anything without spending real cash for the mallot(which will never happen) so I might as well trash the game.  Too bad, it really is a cute game, but it should allow you to earn more energy and tools rather than force you to spend real money for it.  To the developer of this game-just charge a fair price for the game out right.  I don't think you will find enough suckers who will keep sinking money into this thing to make it worth it.  Save your reputation instead.
B0064NTZJO|4.0|My heart started to beat faster when I saw slow-mo scenes. The very reason I favourite this movie is the unique, stylish and outstanding prsentation of slow-mo scenes. Extremely long expanded short glance of moment can express more feelings without a word. It's a normal quality as a Blu-ray disc.
B001EC3JME|4.0|This holster is well made. Uses good quality materials that really hold a flashlight securely. It will fit most any size flashlight from the AAA to the C cells. I haven't tried any D cell flashlights in it yet.  The only thing I find flawed is the fact that a light is hard to get back in once you remove it. But, if it didn't hold tight, it wouldn't be a good holster.

B005N0PJJO|5.0|After reading the first book, Fifty Shades of Grey, I was virtually paralyzed by the ending. It was like having taken a bite of a delicious candy only to find it was suddenly all gone. Then I saw on the book list the second and third novels, making a trilogy. There's my candy!!! I was so excited, my fingers could not fly fast enough to get it downloaded on my Kindle and get started reading it. This second novel, Fifty Shades Darker, delivered more than I could have hoped for, plus. It did not disappoint! Before the ending I was deeply in love with the main character, Christian Grey and very mystified by him as well. Of course, I had also downloaded the third book at the same time so no minute was wasted between finishing this one and going on to the next one. I can't think of any other novels that I've read so voraciously, and that filled me with such sorrow that there was not a fourth and fifth. I plan to wait a while then go back and read all three again.  Is it possible this Author, E.L. James, always writes like this? I certainly plan to look for him every time I need a new book to read.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|This is a must. You can take a picture of anything(esp. a piece of paper) and crop it right on the screen and make it a PDF.  I want the paid version but $5 seems a little steep considering what you get for free.

B00746O3X8|5.0|I agree 100% with Mihale, the MCH-25 Carrier Holster is an excellent system at a very proper price. Similar web harness's are similarly priced from $29-55. For $189 one can buy a Lowepro Expedition backpack that will not only hold ALL of your photo gear but contain a weeks worth of lunches-and dull the teeth of any bear trying to chew into it!!!!!!<br /><br />I too risked a purchase after comparing the two Camera Holster's side-by-side on line. When I received my Opteka Holster I reexamined them again on line with the Opteka in my hand, practically identical.<br />After using the carrier for the last week with various lite to hvy weight lenses just for testing, I definitely recommend the MCH-25 to anyone, going anywhere. My main reason for this purchase was to have a simple chest harness that would support my 70-200 and 150-500 mm teles and prevent them from banging into the Land Rover's doors and seats as I scramble around to get a pix.<br /><br />Sad to say, but from the posture of the 'unhappy camper's' rant I feel he is acting ore like a 'shill' than an honest critquer.<br /><br />Do not hesitate to try & test the carrier--there is a no hassle return policy.

B00701QVVY|5.0|Been a fan of OverKill since Horrorscope was released...went back and grabbed all their earlier stuff and have followed the Kill ever since.  In between Horrorscope and Ironbound, there have been plenty of ups and downs in their catalog.  In other words, lots of outstanding moments but lots of stuff that simply wasn't very good, too.  Then came Ironbound, where OverKill rewrote the book of their legacy.  After the astonishing Ironbound made the eyesand ears of critics everywhere light up, how does Electric Age work as a follow up?  Well, if Ironbound had never existed, I can safely say that The Electric Age would have caved everyone's head in just the same.<br /><br />After Ironbound, OverKill have little left to prove, so this could have been a big old letdown.  Instead, Blitz and DD have picked up right where they left off, ratcheted up the energy (electricity?) just a lil' bit more, and deliver ten more songs of pure east-coast thrash metal that should stand as one of their finest albums in their history.  What can we liken it to?  This listener has decided that it maintains the spirit and intensity of Ironbound, but combines it with the relentless old-school beating of Under the Influence, with a dash of Horrorscope's speedier moments.<br /><br />Very important to note that \\"relentless\\" is the key word here.  With the exception of the bridge section of \\"Electric Rattlesnake,\\" the whole of \\"Black Daze\\" and the clean intro to \\"Good Night,\\" OverKill are all about wrecking your neck and beating you into submission on this album.  The album arguably gets better as it plays itself through, with OverKill finishing you off for good with six sick thrashers in a row (\\"Save Yourself\\" through \\"Good Night\\") after the groove-metal beast that is \\"Black Daze.\\"  Production is raw and heavy, with a glorious guitar sound...watch the \\"making of\\" webisodes online to learn that the guitar was recorded guitar/noise reducer/amp/mic/done.  Still not sure exactly what Derek Tailer does on record, but Dave Linsk still sets himself apart with his Dimebag Darrell meets James Murphy soloing.  Ron Lipnicki continues to be a beast on drums.  Blitz and DD continue to do their thing with Blitz belting out his vocals like only he can (VERY impressive vocal performance), and DD, fresh off of his best songwriting in forever with Ironbound, proves that he wasn't content to snack on songwriting leftovers this time around.<br /><br />My advice would be to purchase this album, get your EQ set up the way you like it, and crank this sonofabitch LOUD!n record, but Dave Linsk still sets himself apart with his Dimebag Darrell meets James Murphy soloing.

B0044RUSZM|5.0|I read some of the reviews and see how some say good things and bad. All I can say is this stand is perfect for what I was trying to accomplish.<br />It elevates my 17\\" MBP sturdily allowing me to store my Large Intuous pad underneath when not in use. With the help of a wireless keyboard & magic track pad, I have a completely versatile work station allowing me to switch easily between typing and design. Plus the stand puts my screen more at eye level for my Photoshop work, instead of before having to look down, or slide down in my chair to do detailed work.<br /><br />The arms hold my laptop well, the skids keep it in place and the clips in the front keep it from sliding down. I really should have configured this a long time ago - but VERY happy that I at least did it recently.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|All the reviews sound basically the same. &quot;Omg this game is like Mario, I would recommend this game to people who like Mario, I think this game reminds me of Mario, I think I can rip off Mario and write crappy reviews about it using fake names, I thinks that people who love Mario will enjoy this game for a few minutes before going and playing something with more creativity, I love Mario, Mario, Mario, Mario! &quot; Seriously, what are the chances that everyone would write reviews like that. Shame on the dev for doing this. I will never download.
B007R41E8O|1.0|First game om Android that doesn't work. The introduction statements are fine but to follow directions to find the funnel, I click in funnel ans screen goes black and the area where funnel and item box is solid white and then the game freezes. Can not get past this section.

B005J2UM9S|3.0|Decent movie...a little slow in the beginning, but picked up and continued to be exciting.  The filming looked a little generic, but not too bad.
B00000F214|4.0|The Usual Suspects is a great movie, probably one of the best crime-thrillers ever made and a personal favorite of mine. The film itself deserves a 5 star. I bought the The Usual Suspects Blu-ray thinking that all the special features on the Special Edition (standard DVD) would be included on the Blu-ray version. I don't know why I thought that. I guess it just makes sense for the Blu-ray version to include everything on the most advanced edition of the standard DVD plus the feature film on Blu-ray. Evidently, I was wrong because none of the special features on Special Edition of the Usual Suspects is on this Blu-ray version. If you have the Special Edition, you should hold on to it and get this Blu-ray version only for the sake of Blu-ray quality picture and audio. There is also the Blu-ray book version you may want to check out, which is more expensive but may offer special features, extras, etc. missing from this one. This is very plain without any special features.
0385534639|1.0|I finally finished The Night Circus. I didn't like it at all and almost over-rode my obsessive obligation to finish a book. I found it quite boring. It doesn't make much progress in the plot, and it's way too long.  One thing that really irritated me was the author's disregard for the rules of grammar. She frequently used a strange construct that kept tripping me up. She would write a short sentence of maybe 4 or 5 words that contained a noun and a verb. Then she would write a second sentence, continuing the thought of the first, but containing no verb. The trailing sentence was just a descriptive clause, an \\"incomplete sentence\\" as we were taught in grade-school. These pairs of sentences needed a comma between then instead of a period. This happened so much, like 2-3 times per page, that I firmly believe it was a trademark arty \\"style.\\" Anyway, it bugged the heck out of me, and I can't believe her editors allowed it.  Of course, there was also the present tense throughout the book, which was weird in a period piece.  Also, I had to keep looking back at the dates on the chapter headings to stay oriented, especially when the dates got out of order.<br /><br />I am very puzzled that the Amazon reviews were overwhelmingly positive - everybody loved it. It wasn't until I was  unhappily bogging down in the middle of it that I went back and read the one- and two- star reviews.  I found my people!<br /><br />I must say, the best thing about this book is its dust jacket. It is truly the most beautiful dust jacket I have ever seen on a book.  But that doesn't make up for the dreadful writing.
B004SIP6A4|5.0|I am not a huge fan of musicals but Chicago is definitely an exception and one of the best musicals I have ever seen. The art direction and choreography are excellent. They perfectly serve the story. All the singing sequences and regular parts are edited very cleverly and they switch back and forth at the right moments. Acting is spectacular. All of the actors and actresses impress with probably the best performances of their entire career; Renee Zellweger as Roxie, Catherine Zeta-Jones as Velma, Richard Gere as Billy Flynn, John C Reilly as Amos, and Queen Latifah as Matron Mama Morton give performances to be remembered. Blu-ray audio and video quality do justice to the movie. I'd highly recommend it.
B00009YOQW|4.0|I try to avoid plastic as much as possible. This wood drum is beautifully crafted and sounds great. You can play different tones by drumming in certain areas. For younger kids, they can make noises with the palms of their hands, if they are still too uncoordinated to hit it with the stick.
B00275EHJG|5.0|Received in a very quick turnaround time and my grandson loved it!  He has all three movies now and is enjoying them daily.
0345803485|5.0|I've just finished the third book in this trilogy and I cannot believe I didn't find this book sooner. It isn't extremely well-written, but the way James develops Christian is amazing and the actual story made it very difficult to ever put these books down. I'm already missing Mr Grey!<br /><br />However, though I do love these books a lot, the characters are eerily similar to those in the Twilight series (but seeing as this whole thing started as a Twilight fanfic, that doesn't surprise me). Christian can't stay away from Anastasia, as Edward did the same with Bella, Jose as Jacob, Anastasia's family situation is similar to Bella's, Christian's to Edward's.. It's strange. The one thing that's very different is the fact that Bella got on my nerves because she was whiny and couldn't do much for herself whereas Anastasia is a much stronger character.<br /><br />All in all I'm glad I experienced this story and I would eagerly read it all over again.

B0073LWEXK|3.0|This was a fun and challenging game.  The graphics were awesome!  It was a bit difficult to get started and just figure out how how to start, but once you get going the hints are really helpful.  Good story, theme and flow.  Puzzles were challenging and overall it really makes you think about what to do next.  I did have to search reviews at one point for some help as I got absolutely stuck, but I'd love to see more by this developer!

1400052181|5.0|This is not just a book about one woman and one family being exploited by the scientific community, although it certainly is that. Rebecca Skloot has done a magnificent job in writing the touching and heartbreaking story of the Lacks family. I could not put this book down without rushing my activities so I could get back to it. I wept at the end and I won't tell you why because I don't want to give anything away. Aside from the story this book so powerfully tells, this is a book for each woman to keep in mind whenever she goes to the doctor. As a psychotherapist I've heard too many stories, my own in my pocket, about how doctors did not reveal information that they should have. It is time women take charge of their own bodies, health, and well-being. Ignorance and blind acceptance of the scientific and medical community has an enormous price. Maybe Henrietta would have given the scientists permission to use her cells and maybe she wouldn't have. Even the great profession of science must respect humanity. In the long run Henrietta's cells taught the scientific profession all around the world how to make treatments but the price and suffering her family paid was inexcusable. If you only read one book this year -- make it this one!  There was no payment rec'd for this review. The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks touched me in so many ways I had to make my comments known.

B006WB7IN8|4.0|Compelling despite the violence and disturbing domestic abuse. Written cleverly with alternating chapters in different times, you think they are written by different characters, but you find that Cathy's story is one of spiralling abuse and the onset of OCD. It's an important story as it shows that domestic violence can start with control of small things, but turn into abuse and even murder. Difficult to read but recommended.
0670023329|5.0|Imagine a government so deranged it locks up entire families in brutal slave labor camps, some larger than the greater Los Angeles area in terms of land area, and for 3 generations of family members who had nothing to do with the original POLITICAL offense--all at the say of the regime's tyrant leader. Something out of Orwell? No, the reality of life in North Korea and its infamous and brutal Camp 14, which sadly is only one of many dozens of such political concentration camps throughout North Korea.<br /><br />Shin is the only person born into one of North Korea's slave labor camps to escape and to live to tell the horrifying tale to the free world. The stultifying brutality Shin describes in the camps becomes almost too much to read, but Blaine Harden, the author, very deftly tells just enough to avoid making the book too burdensome to read, yet giving just enough so we understand the sheer terror being doled out by the parasitic Kim dynasty.<br /><br />From a school girl beaten to death by a \\"teacher\\" merely for having a few kernels of corn, to Shin being permanently maimed by having been held over a fire by sadist guards, to men and women, and the babies, being beaten to death for merely choosing to have children (breeding could only happen by special permission and in arranged relationships,) humans are treated in ways in Camp 14 that we would never tolerate animals being treated in the US.<br /><br />Harden does a good job of moving swiftly through material that's difficult to read and draws a fast paced tale that will keep you in its grip. It is unbelievable to think Shin never knew a better world existed beyond the depravation, slavery, sadism, betrayal and murder of the camp into which he was born. To him, this was normal life. It is heartbreaking to hear Shin never knew the concept of love, never even used the word or had it expressed to him, until he was past childhood and was cared for by a kind man in the dungeon prison he was consigned to (an actual prison within a prison if you can believe that) after his mother attempted to escape. And he was damned to this savage world all because an uncle he never knew chose to live in South Korea back in the 50s. Surreal.<br /><br />A little less than half the book is devoted to Shin's post escape life which I found just as intriguing as his camp experience. You really feel for Shin as he deals with survivor's guilt, especially the shame of having betrayed his mother and brother when they planned to escape.<br /><br />In this way the book poses an interesting moral and ethical conundrum---when it is a camp rule that any overheard escape plan must be reported to the guards at risk of death for remaining silent, do you keep quiet and risk being killed too along with the would-be escapees who have little or no chance of carrying off an escape? Or do you betray them to save yourself and the rest of your family? That's a hard one to answer. I don't know what I would do in such a situation. With only 2 equally horrorifying paths to take in such an awful dillema, one must not condemn Shin's choice. It was triggered by a survival response beat into him by psychotic camp personnel who engaged in a coordinated effort to turn humans into little better than insects, insects who live or die at their whim.<br /><br />And like other books I've read on North Koreans who made it to South, it is saddening to read of the difficult transition many experience in fitting into South Korea's unforgiving and gentrified culture, though credit must be given the South Korean government for doing much to bring such refugees to the South and spending generously to help them assimilate. Shin certainly benefitted from this munificence.<br /><br />Despite this, it was disheartening to learn in the book of South Korean's apathy towards the suffering of their northern brethren, being too caught up in materialism and the drive to succeed over one's neighbor. I was frankly shocked by this. Even worse was theirunwillingness to see the South Korean government take tough measures against its evil and murderous neighbor, even after dozens of provocations which have killed 100s of South Koreans over the decades. A society that values its freedom, and that of others, so lightly will not remain free for long--especially when it is motivated by selfishness and greed.<br /><br />\\"Escape from Camp 14\\" takes its place along side \\"The Aquariums of Pyongyang\\" in effectiveness in laying bare this monstrous regime. My conclusion after reading so much about the demons that run North Korea is that US policy must be one of regime change there. Not by force, but by a complete Western embargo of the regime including food aid. Yes, many will die when famine takes hold again. A tough choice. But I believe the short term pain such a policy would lead to will save many more lives in the long run. When the Satanic regime can no longer even feed its military, as happened in the 1990s famine, it will quickly collapse. This book makes the case for why this must happen and soon to prevent more of the kind of Kim family barbarism we learn of in this book.<br /><br />This is why the recent deal announced by the Obama administration for North Korea to suspend its nuclear program is a major sham. We've been down this road 2 other times and been played as fools both times by a reptilian regime which has no compunction about torturing its own people, therefore why would they have any conscience about cheating on a deal made with Americans they despise? When the regime's pantries are again full, they will do what they did the last two times---go right back to their nuclear ambitions. Why else would they be preparing to test a ballistic missile if they're sincere about ending their nuclear programs? Once again, naiveté has gotten the better of Mr. Obama's judgment on national security issues.<br /><br />This is a book you won't soon forget. Shin is a haunted soul who cries out to an oblivous world to end the modern day Holocaust occurring in North Korea. At one point, Shin makes a statement to an audience in Seattle that the Kim regime is worse than Hitler. He may have a point. North Korea clearly has not killed more than Hitler's regime did, but I would chalk that up only to a lack of opportunity outside its own borders and years of the West effectively containing the brutish regime. But containment is no longer enough as 1 to 2 million of North Korea's long suffering people die from the regime's blood thirsty and incompetent policies. Awareness brought on by a book like Shin's, and the courage it took for him to allow it to be told, will help hasten the day this vile regime is consigned to the trash heap of history.

B004LWZWBU|4.0|I was expecting this to be yet another cheesy male bonding/semi-romcom flick, but it was the best looking new rental on the shelf, and I like Black, don't mind Wilson and still give Steve a lifetime hall pass for Let's Get Small and his first half dozen movies. To my great surprise, Big Year has not only a large handful of funny moments, but also some truly intelligent, touching moments.<br /><br />The fine script is what makes this one run, and the direction is playful enough to bring it to life. The takes on marriage and relationships are a little less predictable than usual, and sometimes even insightful. The ending is not the standard happy bs, and all in all Big Year succeeds as both a pleasant comedy, a decent almost-chick-flick, and a very nice introduction to birding. It won't do for birders what Best In Show did for dog folks...but that's probably a generous gesture!<br /><br />I do love its love for birds and nature in general, and that spirit makes this film shine more than any of the performances (Black wins; his timing is equal to Martin's and their friendship is a highlight). The refusal of the movie to really laugh at birders, but rather show their love as based in a wonderful sense of awe at the wonders of our planet, is also a welcome treat. And I'm no birder! But I sure do admire their admiration of birds. Imagine life without birds...ouch.<br /><br />The one real negative here is the exceptionally grainy and pixelated dvd. This is a TERRIBLE transfer. And you know what? I think this is a big scam the studios are starting to pull: they want to sell the blu-rays at a higher price so they make these look crappy by comparison. I've seen many many more bad recent dvd transfers in 2011-2012 than in any of the previous few years. I often think I'm imagining it...then I see a great recent dvd transfer and remember how perfect they CAN look, if the studio wants them to. And time and again the best dvd transfers are the ones without a blu-ray edition! You do the math. Hint: it's a plus for the studios and a minus for the consumers.<br /><br />So: fine film, but avoid the dvd, and you know what? Don't even buy the BD, the studio doesn't deserve your money. Rent the BD at your local barn for a buck or two and there you go.o the math.

0446343129|5.0|SUGAR BLUES provides the reader with a historical background of sugar production and its harmful effects on people's health. William Dufty's analysis how we are poisoning ourselves and our children is quite disturbing. \\"Sugar is without question the number one murderer in the history of humanity (p60).\\" It makes you wonder if the wider public is informed about sugar and its harmful effects. This book was written many years ago but the caveats are timely today more than ever. The consumption of sugar is on the rise. Sugar is a component in many products; it is causing sickness to many millions of people in many nations and societies. The author cites many medical references about the sugar consumption and the health recovery that many people experienced when they reduced sugar intake or eliminated entirely sugar from their diet.<br />This book was for me very interesting to read. Being incarcerated for several years in Nazi concentration camps in Germany we were deprived from many basic staples, sugar was of them. Many Holocaust survivors, liberated by the American or British armies, died soon after the liberation. The survivors' digestive system could not absorb or assimilate the normal food, especially sweets, that the liberators shared with them so generously. Ancient civilizations believed that we are what we eat; this is applicable to today's' society as well.

If I'm burning a mix CD or listening to music at home and I want some mellow, soothing, make-me-smile-I'm-so-chilled music, it's ALWAYS gonna be PINK FLOYD. Long live the FLOYD.........!!!!!
B0006GANN2|4.0|This is a story about a New York City police detective (Gene Hackman) and his partner (Roy Scheider) and their relentless pursuit to discover a drug source. The high speed chase scenes take them far outside the city limits and get deadly when an attempt is made to kill Gene Hackman's character (\\"Popeye\\" Doyle).<br /><br />This is good police drama and quite entertaining.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Without a doubt, one of the most beautiful puzzlers ever made. Challenging with amazing graphics and lovely audio. Runs like a charm on a Samsung Captivate.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I got this the LAST time it was on FAotD. I like it,  one of my favorites... It's rather relaxing, i play it while putting my baby to sleep. Try it if you like puzzle games.
B0055SWM08|4.0|most levels are pretty easy. a few are challenging enough to require multiple attempts. good for an afternoon of puzzling fun.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|a fun game not to hard not to easy. Great to play and waste some time! Wait how many words do I have to write?
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great app.  i love the way it looks.  a good city builder with a fun system.  freemium as with a lot of apps.
0307352145|3.0|To the extent such a thing could happen, it seems that Susan Cain may have written an introvert's manifesto with her book titled, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking. Cain presents the importance and value of the perspective and contributions that introverts can make in relationships and work settings, if given the chance. Her call is for understanding and the achievement of balance. This book is quick and easy to read, and extroverts are likely to feel they got the point, while introverts will ponder and reflect on Cain's viewpoints and discover ways in which their contributions can be acknowledged and recognized.<br /><br />Rating: Three-star (Recommended)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love these books. I really love the emails of flirting between Christian and Anastasia. A must read! I think I could even read these books again.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I have now had this case for two or three weeks, and can I just say that it rocks!! Reading the reviews on how it didn't stand up made me nervous, I almost returned it while it was shipping. I ended up keeping it because I did not want to pay to return it. It stands up very very well and it is very protective . I dropped it from seven feet high (on accident) onto a window sill. I stared at my kindle for a second before picking it up wondering if my one day old device was all ready broken. When I picked it up I let out a rather big sigh of relief because it was as good as new! If you are thinking about this case it is definately worth any money.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love how this story turned out. I will not ruin it for those who haven't read it. I really enjoyed the flirting between the 2 characters of the book. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a page turner. I read all three books in a week in every spare second I could. I had a hard time putting the book down.

B006AZZPCM|5.0|I really enjoy this app. I give it 4 stars just because it wasn't as fast as I thought it would be and there were ads.<br />But I would recommend this app for anyone with a kindle fire ;)<br />AND THE PHOTOS INCLUDE SNSD ASDFGHJKL.<br />Yup I officially gave it 5 stars for that ;)))
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. It is perfect for my daily Bible reading. It has lots of choices too. So I can choose my method of study such as chronological.
0345529057|5.0|If you don't know, HBO has recently started a new series based off of the series \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\". It is currently at the beginning of season 2 and I have seen every episode and loved it. Therefore, I decided to buy the books to see how similar they were to the TV series. I was pleasantly surprised! The series follows the book exactly! Aside from some minor details, the book is like watching the show all over again. The show even uses direct quotes from the book which is awesome. Anyone who loves the \\"Game of Thrones\\" show should definitely buy these books because you will love them!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really liked the book because I felt it was just as thrilling and gut-wrenching as the first book, [[ASIN:0439023483 The Hunger Games]], I am really looking forward to reading the next book in the series and completing the series for a third time.<br />I have read the book [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]] by Suzanne Collins. The synopsis of the book is that Katniss and Peeta find out that they have to go back into the arena for a second time. But this time they know that only one of them, if possible, can make it out alive. Katniss tries to convince Haymitch to do all that he can, with sponsors and gifts, to keep Peeta alive and not her this time. In the arena they quickly figure out that the arena is set up like a clock and every hour brings a different horror in a different region of the arena. For these reasons Katniss, Peeta and a bunch of other tributes formed an alliance to make sure that they were out of the specific region before the time hit. In the end, Katniss shoots an arrow into the chink of the armor, the force field of the arena. This causes the Gamemakers to stop the games, allowing Katniss and Peeta to escape with their lives once again.
0307454568|5.0|In his last book of the trilogy, Mr. Larrson maintained his excellence in story telling to equal the first and second books of the series.  To absolutely enjoy this trilogy of suspense, the \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo\\" should be read first as it sets the tone of the series.  \\"the Girl who played with Fire\\" is the second book and should be read in that order.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Seems like the manatees with their idea balls, you know the ones that amazon uses to pick the free app of the day... have struck gold! Awesome game, thank you! Just ONE MAJOR ISSUE though: PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE STOP NAGGING ME TO REVIEW YOUR APP. PLEASE STOP NAGGING ME TO LIKE YOU ON FACEBOOK! Just let me play this PAID FOR GAME! NAG screens, IF they are at ALL justified (and I personally do not think they are, but whatever, that;s just my opinion) should be for NON-PAID (free) apps if they are to be used at ALL... but on a PAID app? Unforgivable. SO, regrettably, I must take away a star because of this. This IS A 5 STAR GAME... the NAGGING makes it 4 stars. FIX THIS and I will change my review back to 5 stars.

B006R1T40I|4.0|Bonnie has been my favourite artist for 40 years so it is great to see her back after a seven year hiatus. She has been through some personal problems during that time and as a person of similar age I can sympathise having gone through similar problems myself. This record sees her producing eight of the tracks herself with her road band - Hutch, George and Ricky, with Mike Finnigan replacing Jon Cleary on keyboards. The other four tracks are produced by Joe Henry (Aimee Mann, Bettye Lavette, Susan Tedeschi, Mose Allison, Hugh Laurie etc.) with Joe's 'band', including guitarist Bill Frisell, Greg Leisz, Patrick Warren, David Pitch and Jay Bellerose.<br /><br />I thought that this alternative band gave a much needed change of sound on Dylan's \\"Million miles\\" and \\"Standing in the doorway\\", also the beautiful ballad \\"You can't fail me now\\". \\"God only knows\\" is a stark, haunting, very plaintive way to finish the album and perfectly symbolises the understandable melancholy that suffuses this whole CD.<br /><br />I'm afraid that I found many of Bonnie's self-produced tracks a bit too familiar sounding - both the band itself and Bonnie's electric slide sound - and on the whole the songs just aren't memorable enough. Three of the songs are by Al Anderson, who also plays guitar, I don't really think he is the right writer for Bonnie with his Nashville AOR - I thought that \\"Split decision\\" a love song with boxing metaphors (?!?) was dreadful! Having said that Bonnie does sing Al's ballad \\"Not cause I wanted to\\" beautifully, it is one of the record's highlights, and her singing throughout is as sublime as usual. Five of these tracks just feature Bonnie on vocals (rather than vocals AND guitar) and I wonder if we get the best from Bonnie if she isn't also playing guitar (in the same way that people used to say Aretha always sang better when she played piano.)<br /><br />I guess that producing this album (and undertaking the forthcoming tour of the States) is Bonnie's attempt to get back to work and put the past behind her but I can't help wondering how this record would have sounded if she'd let Joe Henry produce the whole thing. As it is everything sounds OK, very professional but for me it is all a bit too slick and doesn't compare with her best work, I would really like to see her going back to her more folky blues roots.get back to work and put the past behind her but I can't help wondering how this record would have sounded if she'd let Joe Henry produce the whole thing.

0307949435|5.0|A fascinating book and very convincing about the whole calories in-calories out theory being wrong. His major point is that carbohydrates are the things making us fat, if we are fat. The mechanism of how carbs are used to fuel us shows how insulin and other hormones work against some people and those are the ones that get fat. Drop the carbs down and the excess weight will come off. I liked this book so much, I bought 2 more to give to friends. And, I am controlling my carbs and have lost 16 pounds in 10 wks.
B004ZGI2KK|1.0|Truly one of the worst movies I have ever sat through. I honestly didn't care who the wolf turned out to be...I was just too tired to get up and walk out of the room. The whole movie reminded me of a badly done jr. high play...but the play would have at least been captivating because you might know one of the young actors and you could be less critcal since it was just an amateur production. Please don't waste your time.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|its amazing. even better than the first! And relax guys, Rovio WILL have an update with more levels probably. Just try to be nicer to Rovio. And for those of you who are complimenting the game keep it up! :D
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game u need to get now.u do not want to miss out on the fun do u.so get this app now.
B00756GKBA|1.0|Boring, unoriginal, and repetitive, just like the previous album \\"Hard Candy\\". As a Madonna fan, I'm quite disappointed to receive another disaster full of fillers from one of the few artists who insisted in the past to release something different from what's already present. For the second time in a row, Madonna releases an album far from pleasing and inspiring (for my own account), just the contrary to her previous releases. These ears have heard \\"American Life\\" and \\"Hard Candy\\", too, but even those albums had more than one song for me to incessantly listen to. But here, NO song urges me to listen to it again, except for 'Masterpiece', that obviously doesn't belong on the album. Nothing different from the deadly boring electronic stuff you can find anywhere nowadays.<br /><br />I believe this is another effort from Madonna to support her new tour, instead of the other way around. Sad that it came out too quickly, maybe she could have created something much better if she had worked on it longer.

0385344228|1.0|I cannot believe the 5 star reviews here...this book is so poorly written and so contrived.  The first  scene with the parents and the shrink is absurd.  The mother is an idiot and the conceit of the murderous father, etc. Is, well, so stupid i am not sure what word to use to describe it.  Want to read a good book....read 'we need to talk about kevin.'. That is brilliant writing...this is like the 'dick and jane' books. Only worse.  Bummed i wasted my money.  I tried to rate it zero stars, but was unable to do so!
B005K8QIS0|5.0|I have read all the Kate Atkinson \\"Jackson Brodie\\" novels, and had always anticipated it would transfer particularly well to the screen.<br />Jason Isaacs as Jackson is a wonderful choice.<br />An understated reluctant hero, kept in check by his secretary and his ex wife and young daughter (excellently portrayed by Millie Innes), Private Investigator Jackson stumbles from one crime scene to another. It never seems his intention to get involved, and indeed he often tells potential clients there is nothing to be done, but always the clients persist, and Jackson, soft hearted and vulnerable to others heartache, is drawn in.<br />I think the series works so well because the stories are good and once we have been introduced to the characters, we have a real desire to learn more about them, and to see where the screenwriters will take them next.<br />Obviously (as with all adaptations) there are some changes from the books, but overall the differences work well and I can see why they were made.<br />Looking forward to the next series.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|leps world = Mario Brothers.  same game. The only difference is that mario is a leprechaun.  Nonetheless it is still fun.  Who doesn't like mario?
1435122968|5.0|As a fan of the uncanny and macabre, I have many books on the subject of HORROR!!!! And am happy to add Lovecraft to the collection. Anyone who has read Edgar Allan Poe can quickly comprehend the similarities between these two great writers. This book is a treasure for anyone who likes eerie stories.
B004HO6I4W|4.0|This movie is great for kids who love action, songs and dancing. My 2 1/2 year old son really loves this movie.
B004132HZS|5.0|Steven Moffat and Mark Gatiss have done a fantastic job of updating the classic stories of Sherlock Holmes by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle into the 21st century. With the stunning talents of  Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman as the dynamic duo, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson, the mini documentary series comes to life and their chemistry draws you in for one amazing ride. I enjoyed both seasons of Sherlock and I cannot wait for the next exciting season.
B0053O89IS|5.0|It is not a regular serie. It is far from that. An imposibile colection of action , scyence , humor , love , sentiments , and the best dyrection. It is almost imposible to imagine how you can make a lovely serie from a horibble subgect like the forensics antropology. Very , very recomanded , the actors are perfect and the scenario also. Don\\"t be affraid of the shoking images , it is not a horror movie , it is a love and action movie , full of sentiment , love and human undersanding. The DVD is perfect and in very good quality.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game so far has been one of the best. The touch controls work excellently and no glitches or bugs. Will try all of their games if they update this one for more levels. Really is worth atleast 99 cents.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is really fun. It takes a small amount of time to get used to the controls, but once u get the hang of it it is really fun! Great game for kids.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is wonderful! Smooth game play, graphics are easy on the eyes and obstacles are a challenge as you progress. Would definitely recommend to a friend.
030788743X|3.0|I have found this book to be both enjoyable and beyond frustrating. I am listening to the audio version and there are times when I cannot wait to hear the next plot point. Sadly, there are too many times when nothing happens. I just spent the hour long commute to work listening to the protagonist whine about his love life, describe his rig, his haptic suit, his love doll, the food he orders in, his weight, how much memory, hard drive and processing power his computer has, etc ad nausea.. Being in a bad mood this morning, I was looking forward to an hour's worth of plot development. What I got instead was an infuriating hour of filler that made me want to smash my iPhone.<br /><br />I have edited my review and changed it to three stars now that my anger has passed. This is because the book was a furious page turner with a fantastic idea and I can't wait to see the movie.<br /><br />That said, it's too bad no one told the author \\"You don't need this many straight lists of things about what songs the programmer likes, what foods, what games, etc...\\" Imagine someone telling you what it was like to get up and go to work, describing every feeling as they woke up, what they were wearing, how cold the floor was, what the floor was made of, making coffee, how the coffee tasted, the room where the coffee was drunk, what mug the coffee was poured into, etc. There are some chapters in the book that are just like that.<br /><br />The other minor nit I have is with the endless references to Japanese anime both in video games and TV shows. As a computer gamer who lived through the eighties, many, many references were lost on me.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game. make your own town and do it your way Oregon trail style its a good time. takes common sense and wisdom to run a successful town. try it out!

B00065MDRW|5.0|This review is for the digital mastering of the 2004 release of this absolute apex of prog rock, who's music the other reviews have covered in great detail.  The story is that for years the original studio master tape for ItKotCK was lost, and up until this 2004 release the digital masters were made from 2nd, 3rd, or who really knows what generation copies of the studio master and it really shows:  though my ancient LP has its party battle damage from years long ago, I preferred its sound over the weak sounding recordings of the Frame by Frame box set and 30th anniversary CD release which I also own.  But thank god, the original master was found in excellent condition and lovingly 24 bit remastered to produce this HDCD disk (which effectively yields 20 bits of dynamic range).  If you got the audiophile gear to exploit HDCD, you are in for a treat.  The sonic quality is outstanding and finally blows away my vinyl LP.  It's as if you are there at the recording sessions, but only better since it's all mixed down.  The biggest surprise was the Moon Child improv: its intimacy of being right there with Fripp and Giles playing is astonishing.  I regret that I didn't buy this when it released in 2004.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Fun faotd. It doesn't ask for crazy permissions, which is always a plus.  The only thing I don't like is it doesn't close when you back out of it.
B000G8NXZK|2.0|'Lo There All N' Sundry,<br /><br />This rather involved review was born out of a comment I made on another 1 star review. I figured if I went to all the trouble to explain my aversion to this film, then I might as well make it into a full review, just to validate all my hard work in writing it.  I'm going to be nicer and give it 2 stars, but I will qualify that later as to my justification for the other added star, even though I would never recommend this flick if you're looking for a good time. There are easier and far funner ways to get lucky than to view this film.<br /><br />I don't believe this film was meant to be fun or to be \\"enjoyed.\\" I think it it is just another way for Gilliam to pontificate his pet peeves of the moment, and espouse his own particular tedious brand of world view. To say that Terry and I don't see eye to eye on what are really the portentous dilemmas facing society, way back in the 80's or now for that matter, is a gross understatement. Some souls out there may see weighty prognostication in this film, but then some see Jesus in a grilled cheese sandwich. So what does that tell you?<br /><br />I know I'm going against the grain here, considering all the favorable reviews that have gone before, but I really don't care for Brazil. Never have. Even after multiple viewings. Yep, even the title irritates me as completely inane, but maybe that was Gilliam's nebulous point. The country of Brazil deserves better that to have a film graced with its name that has nothing to do with that beautiful land. I mean come on, folks, a film named Brazil with no samba dancing at Carnival on the beaches of Rio by beautiful caramel skinned sweeties in dental floss bikinis? For shame! Such a misnomer is... Well, that's a bloody bollocks of false advertising right there, Terry, you adopted limey boy.<br /><br />Okay, let's get on with it.<br /><br />So look, it's fine if you think Brazil is all that and a dumptruck full of spuds. That's peachy keen with cream in between for you, but here's the deal-ee-oh, yo'. It seems that when somebody doesn't like this film, and puts up a dissenting opinion, a certain segment of the Brazil lovers pounce on these persons as heretics against the Cult of Gilliam.<br /><br />Just so you'll know where I'm coming from; this ain't my first (nor the second, third, fourth, but fifth) boring bull-ride with the Brahma Beast called Brazil. (Oh, how I wish those had been 8 seconds or less, but anyway...)<br /><br />See, the first time I saw Brazil, I was 16, and it was at my friend's house. There were 7 people in the room, 3 boys, 4 girls. I don't really remember what predicated us renting the movie, but somehow it ended up in the VCR. The 3 of us boys were best friends, and what educators now call \\"gifted but unmotivated.\\" You know the type. When we weren't out doing our level best to relieve our ever-present tumescence with some willing sweetie, we were talking about the books we read or the flicks we saw, while we worked on our cars or whatever filled our free time. Schoolwork was always merely an after thought.<br /><br />Summers were filled with hangin' out, gettin' a lil' buzzed n' baked, cruisin' in our rides, and watchin' flicks, before gettin' some sugar. The night we watched Brazil the first time, well, we were a little distracted, but most of us ended up asleep by the end of the film, except for me. With a girl tucked in the crook of my arm, I blearily finished the film, and my first thought was \\"What the Effin' Eff? What a bummer, dude!\\"<br /><br />Okay, I hadn't caught all of the film. I don't have any excuse, other than that I was otherwise more pleasantly occupied for long stretches at a time, but I still had the film for two days, so the next day I watched it again with one of my buds from the night before. He fell asleep watching it, and that was in the middle of the day! And no, we weren't drunk or stoned. He just so bored slumber just came naturally. I was totally bored as well,but I watched it again all the way through, and again thought \\"What the Eff?! Holy Shist! This sucked!\\"<br /><br />Yeah, yeah, yeah, I was an idiot teenager. What did I know? Well, I knew I loved Monty Python and Benny Hill. I thought Brazil would be funny like that British fare, but except for a few ridiculously farcical moments, I did not even see anything remotely amusing. Now at 16, I was fairly smart and artistic, but not very culturally savvy. But I knew what I liked. I loved [[ASIN:B000UBMWG4 Blade Runner]]! I loved [[ASIN:0790729342 The Road Warrior]]! I loved [[ASIN:B003UESJJC Apocalypse Now]]. I loved [[ASIN:B000055Y0X Dr. Strangelove]]. I did not love Brazil. I was baffled by the title, and by the plot, and the message. What can I say, I was young and inexperienced.<br /><br />In the years afterward, I have been subjected to viewing the film 3 more times. I went on to college, and I eventually went into film production. In that creative community, there are Brazil fanatics, and when you say that you don't like the film, some of them come unglued and almost foam at the mouth as bad as if you say you're a Republican. Anyway, after a few times of this happening, a friend talked me into another go, so I checked out the film again, just to see if I had been viewing it with adolescent sensibilities, and had been too obtuse to understand the finer points of Gilliam's creation.<br /><br />So I watched it as a 27-year-old, and guess what? I totally understood what Gilliam was saying. I got it. Even where the obscure title came from. I also saw the artistic choices, and the dystopian vision. I was no longer that testosterone-driven juvenile. And, well, lil' campers, I still was bored. Bored-Bored-Bored. See, to me, being bored with a film is far worse than hating a film. Hatred is a strong emotion. If a film makes you hate, well, at least that's something, but boredom? Apathy? Well, that is inexcusable in my book.<br /><br />But then you'll say, why did you, dear Jimmy, watch it two more times? Well, I can assure you that it was not by my choice. No-no! Not at all. But cinephiles will do as cinephiles will do, and over the years since my third viewing, I have been at conclaves of production folk that have for one reason or another put Brazil into the player, and I've had to either be rude and leave, or I had to sit through it, and roll my eyes at all the gushing platitudes to Gilliam's so-called brilliance. I expect, before I molder in the grave, that I'll have to likely sit through it again at some point.<br /><br />The last time was a couple of years ago, when I was 40, and I still was not feeling the supposed mojo of this \\"sublime satire.\\" In fact, I have a friend who teaches film appreciation at a local university. The department chair is an avid fan of Brazil, and makes my friend show it to every enrolled class as part of the curriculum. I asked my teacher buddy once about how much of a percentage of his students really love the film, and he told me about 10%, while on the other hand, about 65% feel much like he and I in our take-or-leave-it attitude, and last 25% absolutely hate it, usually because they find it so pointless. Now, of course, that is just one small sampling, in Podunk University USA no less, but to me it is indicative of how most Americans feel about the film, and I have to admit, I feel slightly vindicated by his assessment. Of course, that could just be my ethnocentric xenophobia seeping through my charming veneer.<br /><br />It does seem that Europeans love this thing far more than Americans, but then we Yankee Gringos have always been a bit boorish and infantile, no? Bunch a rootin'-tootin', gunslingin' cowboys are we! Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee-Hawwww! Seriously, go to Cannes, and you'll see a good segment of the Continental industry perceive Americans (especially Western ones) exactly that way.<br /><br />Regardless of that sentiment, here's the thing. It's only the artsy fashion police types that really,Really, REALLY dig this film. The hoity-toity art elite who think the rest of humanity is a teeming mass of unwashed hoi polloi, and only they, The Rarified Enlightened Ones, truly know what constitutes refinement.<br /><br />Most of us in the biz are just like myself (or maybe it only seems that way from my bias viewpoint.) Our reaction to Brazil is \\"Meh. Whatever.\\" It doesn't matter what best-of lists the film is on. It just isn't our bag of ex-patriot-American-turned-British tea. Most of us don't care if Gilliam stuck it to the studio system. So what? Most of us know that he has a reputation for thinking he is an avant garde genius, and pretty much saying so regularly, when we all know of course he does have a certain expert skill set, but his schtick is getting pretty old and tired. He's a surrealist, with a dystopian bent; a man boy with severe leftist leanings. (That could describe a passel of folks in Hollywood, ya' know?)<br /><br />So what's new about that? And in a hundred years will the world, if it survives, look at Brazil, or Gilliam's entire filmography, and go \\"Bloody, Effing Brilliant!?\\" Who knows, maybe the British will, but I doubt this opus will be such a monument to his prodigy or a lasting statement about western civilization. It'll just be a movie footnote somewhere, and people will pull out the film infrequently, watch it, and go \\"People SURE were weird and boring way back in the 1980's UK.\\"<br /><br />But if this film makes your drawers all gooshy and gives you that certain tingle, or causes you to giggity-giggity-goo in your slickety-slickety-slacks, wow, who am I to deny your illicit pleasure in watching it to your pink parts content?<br /><br />I just don't like it. The message is stale. It's repetitive. It's boring. The story is neither enlightening, inspired, nor revolutionary, and is actually (to me) an exercise in nonsensically depressive nilism. Life will crush you, no matter what you do, and the only way to escape is death or to sink into your fantasies; thus it it is better to be mad then live in a mad world. (At least that's my take. I'm sure there are other extrapolations from it, but I really don't care. Whatever thay are, they would be just as boring to me.) It's about as exciting as watching an avalanche of molasses rolling down hill in an Alaskan January. Oh, to have the thrill of watching paint dry, or a sward of grass grow, while simultaneously self circumcising yourself as you bludgeon your skull into a boulder, just to relieve the malaise of torpor gripping your brain.

Then watch [[ASIN:B00005Y71F Joe Versus the Volcano]]. (yeah, I know it's romantic comedy. So what?) At least there's a volcano in that one, and it's funnier (and I mean the volcano.)

But that said, even though I expect it in the future, I could really do without another viewing of this \\"masterpiece.\\" Bleh.<br /><br />Even after all that palaver, I'll be fair and give it two stars for certain artistic aspects and nice scoring. Actually, it's more like a sputtering 1 1/2 dark dwarf stars. I'd give it an entertainment value of a big fat, self important, ego-bloated 2 on a scale of 1 to 10.<br /><br />Hey, but that's only my opinion, and everybody's got one.<br /><br />8^\Really, REALLY dig this film. The hoity-toity art elite who think the rest of humanity is a teeming mass of unwashed hoi polloi, and only they, The Rarified Enlightened Ones, truly know what constitutes refinement.<br /><br />Most of us in the biz are just like myself (or maybe it only seems that way from my bias viewpoint.) Our reaction to Brazil is \\"Meh. Whatever.\\" It doesn't matter what best-of lists the film is on. It just isn't our bag of ex-patriot-American-turned-British tea. Most of us don't care if Gilliam stuck it to the studio system. So what? Most of us know that he has a reputation for thinking he is an avant garde genius, and pretty much saying so regularly, when we all know of course he does have a certain expert skill set, but his schtick is getting pretty old and tired. He's a surrealist, with a dystopian bent; a man boy with severe leftist leanings. (That could describe a passel of folks in Hollywood, ya' know?)<br /><br />So what's new about that? And in a hundred years will the world, if it survives, look at Brazil, or Gilliam's entire filmography, and go \\"Bloody, Effing Brilliant!?\\" Who knows, maybe the British will, but I doubt this opus will be such a monument to his prodigy or a lasting statement about western civilization. It'll just be a movie footnote somewhere, and people will pull out the film infrequently, watch it, and go \\"People SURE were weird and boring way back in the 1980's UK.\\"<br /><br />But if this film makes your drawers all gooshy and gives you that certain tingle, or causes you to giggity-giggity-goo in your slickety-slickety-slacks, wow, who am I to deny your illicit pleasure in watching it to your pink parts content?<br /><br />I just don't like it. The message is stale. It's repetitive. It's boring. The story is neither enlightening, inspired, nor revolutionary, and is actually (to me) an exercise in nonsensically depressive nilism. Life will crush you, no matter what you do, and the only way to escape is death or to sinkinto your fantasies; thus it it is better to be mad then live in a mad world. (At least that's my take. I'm sure there are other extrapolations from it, but I really don't care. Whatever thay are, they would be just as boring to me.) It's about as exciting as watching an avalanche of molasses rolling down hill in an Alaskan January. Oh, to have the thrill of watching paint dry, or a sward of grass grow, while simultaneously self circumcising yourself as you bludgeon your skull into a boulder, just to relieve the malaise of torpor gripping your brain. I'd rather watch a slide show of [[ASIN:3791329448 Salvador Dali]] paintings in an endless loop. 'Cause THAT goofy wingnut was an ACTUALLY mad genius.<br /><br />You want surrealism?

B002ZG976U|5.0|This was probably the fastest thing I ever received in the mail, after ordering it online! It's an amazing movie..but the quickness was the best part!
B000WAEJZ0|4.0|Can't go wrong with this CD.  Has all of her best.  A few on there that I forget she had!  Definitely one of the greatest singers of all time.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this app is awesome if you like supper Mario for wii you NEED this app!!!!!!!!! get this app you will not regret it
B000A2IPP0|5.0|My kids are actually watching it right now for the second time in 3 days. They're enthralled and they keep asking me for Reese's Pieces now. It is a great movie for little kids to watch and fits with my love for X-Files.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|reminds of the Mario bros game for super nintendo. LOVE IT! Very addictive :) even my son loves playing this game too....
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really enjoyed reading the first book of the series, as well as the other two books.  They moved rapidly and for me engaging.  Katniss has an inner strength she doesn't know she has.  This is evident in the series.  Her inner strength shows itself on occasion, but she unwittingly keeps it hidden.
B0063GORYU|4.0|The Spider App can become addictive.  Some of the combinations are easy while most are medium to difficult and it takes some logic and luck to pick the correct combinations.  A fun game!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|really fun, it has a Mario like feel and has kept me entertained. I'm excited to get past the next fee levels. favorite free game at the moment.
0439023521|4.0|The Hunger Games was my first foray into YA \\"dystopian\\" (I hate that word) fiction, and I enjoyed it. I found the book to be fast-paced and action packed, especially once the games started, and I liked the protagonist, Katniss. To me, the premise of a post-apocalyptic reality show whose contestants are selected by lottery and forced to fight to the death seemed like a cross between Shirley Jackson's The Lottery and the TV show Survivor. My one wish is that there would have been more explanation in the novel about how the post-apocalyptic story world - the remnants of North America now named Panem - became the way it is. Perhaps that's a subject developed later in the series, but it seemed like the one thing that was missing by the novel's end. As it stands, the reader has to accept the premise without worrying how the world got that way, and simply enjoy the games.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its a cute game a lot like the games you find on facebook you need Internet access to play it but besides that I enjoy it
0553801473|1.0|this book taught me not to start series of books until the last one is published.<br />when (i mean if) the series is complete, i will pick it up again (or wait for hbo to finish it?).<br /><br />i think, not sure, this book is longer than all of the lord of the rings books combined, yet NOTHING happens (well enough happens that a 1 page summary can easily suffice, i've seen it done in reviews here).<br /><br />sad to see the greatness of books 1-3 diminish...
B002LFPAUC|5.0|If I'm permitted but one TV comedy series to take with me to Hell -- assuming I'm cursed with the grievous misfortune to wind up there -- please, Saint Whomever, let it be FAWLTY TOWERS.<br /><br />Despite only twelve side-splitting, laugh-till-ya-drop episodes of this British masterpiece, one could sit comfortably (even eagerly) by one's raging \\"fireplace,\\" blithely basking in the bubbleheaded antics of Basil Fawlty & Co. from the moment of arrival, until...well, until Hell freezes over.
B0073XORCY|4.0|The bonus DVD is not in North American format.<br />Luckily my PC allowed for the change to Western EU format so it could be played.<br />It will not play on my other media players

B007LEC7CC|4.0|Madonna's 2008 album, \\"Hard Candy\\" left a bad taste in my mouth. Her collaborations with Timbaland, Timberlake and others felt desperate and forced. It was the first time I had ever disliked a Madonna record. Enter MDNA which could also be called \\"confessions on a dancefloor part 2\\". Madonna has gone back to her roots and is doing what she does best with a fun dance album. Some of the music also has an introspective feel to it and while they are good songs, they still don't live up to the high standard of the \\"Like A Prayer\\" and \\"Ray of Light\\" albums. One of the weaker songs on the album I think is the first single, \\"Give me all your luvin' \\" Its a cute song but there are much better ones on here like the tracks, \\"Turn Up The Radio\\", \\"Gang Bang\\", \\"Love Spent\\", \\"I'm A Sinner\\", and \\"Masterpiece\\". Ignore the negative reviews. Most of those are from bitter Lady Gaga fans that are still angry over Madonna's \\"reductive\\" comment. Why do some fans insist on believing they have to like only one or the other? I love both women!

B003WE9TU8|5.0|'World War Z' looks at the traditional zombie story with a depth unseen previously in this genre. Considering everything from the economic impact of a zombie outbreak right through to the changes in military strategy required to deal with the threat, the story travels the world and takes in every angle, showing a very human response to a very inhuman plague. I've read this book twice, and I'll be reading it again. Two decayed thumbs up!
B0045TYDNC|5.0|This makes a nice tight dust-proof seal to the rear end of the lens. There is no danger of it accidentally coming off. Solidly built. Can be attached to the body cap when not in use, and more importantly, easily detached. Much better than the cheap cap that Nikon ships its lenses with. I suppose a cheap cap is fine if you're only ever going to use one lens, but if you're expecting to be changing lens you'll want this.

B0052U59F4|5.0|Awesome trilogy! Couldn't put it down! Can't wait until the saga continues...you won't be disappointed! I didn't find the detailed sex offensive at all...it goes along very well with the story of these two lovers..Not offensive at all!
B0055SWM08|4.0|The music and graphics are not only smooth and calming, but the puzzles are great for exercising the brain without any stress of a time limit or annoying music or flashy graphics.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Super Mario style gameplay.  Looks good smooth play!  Very cool that it is free everybody should download you wont be sorry!

B006RUJST6|5.0|I'm an honest girl. I have honest opinion. And my honest opinion is that I'm glad I picked up this two-book series! I'll admit that it wasn't something I just HAD to read. I was in a book rut... we've all been there right? The story seemed like it might be a nice young read and although I was currently trolling for something a little more adult, and a little less YA, I decided to give it a go. As I said, this is a two-book series so I'll try to break down my thoughts between the individual reads.<br /><br />First, book one... SLAMMED!<br /><br />As I said, I was apprehensive. A young girl, grieving the loss of her father, uprooted and dragged across the states by her surviving mother and little brother.. sounded like a bit of a downer. But then... Will happened! Poor Layken \\"Lake\\" had enough worries.. but they just kept adding up. I don't want to spoil any of the story here, so I really must be a little vague. She can't be with Will.. the boy across the street. Her family life is going to hell. She just wants to move back to Texas and crawl in a dark corner forever.  Life continues to suck for Lake. Again, I say the word \\"downer\\" but the stolen moments (and kisses) with the forbidden Will keep her going, and kept me reading!<br /><br />The first book in this series rounds out beautifully as everything comes full-circle and our characters, who've suffered so much find peace. I was content to just stop there and not even pick up book two. Slammed really would have worked greatly as a stand-alone. BUT I missed Lake and Will and just had to have more of them.<br /><br />Book two - POINT OF RETREAT<br /><br />Again, no spoilers on here, so I really can't go into much detail about book two without ruining book one for you :( As soon as I read the description, I hesitated yet again to read it. MORE trouble for these individuals who've suffered so much already? I just didn't think my heart could take it. It was almost like I thought that if I didn't read it, none of the rest of the turmoil would have ever existed for them. Of course, I read anyway. I was right.. My heart almost couldn't take it. Just when everything was working out and everybody was finding their way in life.. BAM! (There's always a 'bam' moment isn't there??)<br /><br />Of course, everything has it's way of playing out and I'm ever so glad that I decided to pick up that second book!<br /><br />Generally As a Series<br /><br />I must say that each of these two books brought me something different. The first brought me back to my youth. Very YA, it took me back to those times every girl has when you have that first special moment with a boy.. that first heartache.. that giddy feeling you get right before you see 'him'... that feeling that the world will JUST END if he doesn't like you back... and my personal favorite - that gloriously wonderful \\"punched in the gut\\" butterfly feeling that boy gives you! Yes, I had butterflies while reading book one!<br /><br />Book two is all about what happens after those moments... it showcased for me what happens after the \\"honeymoon phase\\" when real life starts getting in the way of young love. I must say that book two was hillarous to read though! I found a lot of humor in many passages and on several occasions giggled out loud! I had feared that I would hate having the 'happy ever after' conclusion from book one ripped apart, but book two offered me even MORE closure than I could have hoped. So yes, I'm again very glad that I kept reading!<br /><br />This series is very YOUNG... young love, young troubles, but is so much more adult than that at the same time. A child growing up is never easy. A child living the life of an adult full of grown-up responsibilities is even harder. I found myself feeling proud of these characters and how they survived! Roll that over for a minute... I felt PROUD of people I've never met, who technically don't even exist. But of course, we readers become so emotionally invested in our stories that theyWERE real to me! If I could see Lake, Will, and the rest of the gang in real life that's what I'd tell them... That I'm PROUD of them!<br /><br />I'm also very proud of Colleen Hoover for putting together these stories so eloquently. Everything was so nicely rounded out and left me feeling complete when it was all wrapped up. I'd also like to thank Colleen for the \\"butterflying butterflies\\" she made me feel like I haven't since I was a kid with a crush! --- You'll understand and appreciate that statement once you finish book two. Which, by the way you'd BETTER!<br /><br /> Read more of my reviews at book-snobs.blogspot

0374532990|5.0|It was fascinating to read the inside story of how Robert Hammond and Joshua David rescued the High Line from demolition and fulfilled their vision for \\"NYC's Park In The Sky\\". Their alternating voices compel the reader like dialogue in a drama. Gripping from the start, the read becomes even more interesting as a cast of characters develop. We learn how a wide variety of talented and generous people (from lawyers to politicians to photographers to meat packers to celebrities) worked together to make it happen.<br /><br />They divulge many juicy details of their journey both good and bad, and their stumbles are as interesting as their triumphs. I was choked up by many passages throughout the book and out right crying by the end, as if I was actually there at the ribbon cutting! I was especially moved by their community outreach, their donor's generosity, and the growth of mass support and interest for the park. But was also moved by the combination of openness, sensitivity, and vigilance they employed in navigating city and community politics and ultimately, by the democratic process in which the High Line was saved and transformed.<br /><br />It's amazing to learn how they balanced a grass roots approach (literally!) with city, state, and federal bureaucracies and capital donors. And how their design approach balanced spectacular innovation with careful preservation. Just when I thought I couldn't be more in awe of the High Line . . .this book has made me appreciate it on an even deeper level, spiritually and philosophically.
B0055SWM08|5.0|soothing and enthralling. exactly opposite the Amazon appstore's infuriating twenty word minimum for submitting a review. perhaps if amazon would play soothing background music as I type.....
B003HV0TN2|5.0|I loved this book! Once I got drawn into Kvothe's amazingly detailed world, I couldn't put the book down. I enjoyed all the time and detail the author has put into every character and situation. He manages to make even subordinate characters feel real and complex. The story line itself is not completed at all in this first book and leaves you guessing a little at the end but all the interesting sub plots makes for an exciting and entertaining read. Overall I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a new favourite fantasy book that is well written with characters that will become as real to you as the people you meet every day.
B000BQVSFO|5.0|Who can ever say enough about the Who? I first heard my first Who as a teenager in 1967, and it was I Can See For Miles. I immediately bought The Who Sell Out, and went backwards to get the first two albums. Of course then came Tommy and Who's Next. I love them both, but Sell Out was my introduction and still favorite. I was already a Beatles and Stones fan, and though many great bands came out of the British rock scene those two plus The Who for me will always be the Triumvirate of the British Invasion.<br /><br />I recently purchased a new copy and was disappointed to find that it wasn't the album I remembered. The remastered versions were great, but the \\"original\\" version of Rael just wasn't the same. I wish they had kept the album version and included the new-found \\"original\\" as a bonus track. Fortunately for me Amazon had a used copy of the old release of the CD, so now I have both versions. Thanks Amazon! Gotta have my WHO!

B0058O84G0|4.0|A Great read. A fascinating look at the Russian Revolution &  First World War. Lots of information and characters. Can't wait for Book 2. People who say it is boring obviously have no sense of history - perhaps they should stick to Mills and Boon!
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I absolutely loved this book - had no idea what it was about but was hooked after the first couple of chapters.  Am now working my way through the next one.
B00000633U|3.0|Released not quite two years after his debut, Richard Marx's Repeat Offender lives up to the title by basically mimicking the same sounds as the debut.  It worked as the album hit number one on the charts and produced three top ten singles (including two number ones) and two more that made number 12 & 13 respectively.  While the songs are catchy enough, they don't have the same freshness and exuberance as the debut.  \\"Right Here Waiting\\" was a monster number one hit, but it another power piano ballad in the vein of \\"Hold On To The Nights\\".  \\"Satisfied\\" also hit number one and is probably the best track on the album.  \\"Children Of The Night\\" was about a runaway center in Los Angeles with all proceeds going towards the charity.
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading book one, I had to read book two, (and three). Seems like everything now is sequels to keep you coming back. Enjoyed reading them all though at times a little too predictable.
B004SH40BQ|4.0|This is a fantastic companion to the iPod Nano Touch. It's small, lightweight, and not at all bulky. It fits perfectly with almost any iPod Nano watch-band on the market, and allows you to go wireless with your bluetooth headset of choice.<br /><br />The only reason I knock off a star is that it drains battery life a little too fast for my taste. I'm no electrical engineer, so I don't know if Kokkia could have really done any better in that area, but it's just a little disappointing. Don't let the scare you off, though... This beast is still awesome!
B005HSL626|3.0|I bought this for my 2-year old grand daughter to play, but it turned out to be too fast for her and she quickly lost interest. However, free is no foul and maybe she'll grown into it. I am not a gamer.

B006R1T40I|5.0|I've had some time to live with the new SLIPSTREAM collection, Bonnie Raitt's first outing in many years and my first thoughts to share.... Bonnie Raitt hasn't sounded this good in over 20 years, recharged for sure but the many losses she has been faced with are certainly factored in with these brand new recordings. Bonnie's vocals on Slipstream standout from the first cut right on down to the last piano notes. You'll find it all here from the bluesy rock, to rock and roll funky, to soul stirings and heartaches, some Rolling Stones touches, a dash of reggae, rollicking tunes with many shades of the best of Bonnie Raitt. Slipstream is made up of two distinct recordings, one with the great Joe Henry and his bandmates, the other Bonnie and her road warriors with new addition Mike Finnegan, both awesome sound experiences and meshed together with the talents of Ryan Freeland, who recorded and mixed Slipstream. There isn't a sour note here, this is a guitar cd at its core and Bonnie and that slide standout all over this outstanding record, but I couldn't leave out the wonderful keyboards touches.  The song selection, writers, musicanship all standout, adding up to one of the best of the year and such a listening experience for the music lover. The soulful vocals of \\"Take my love with you\\", the beauty n' pain in \\"Not cause I wanted to\\", the Bob Dylan cuts \\"Million miles\\" and \\"Standing in the doorway\\" transforms the listener with the vocal talents of Raitt. I've really enjoyed the Al Andeson/Gary Nicholson cut \\"Split decision\\", Bonnie just sinks her teeth into this rollicking piece of rock, as with the Stone'ish \\"Down to you\\". Gerry Rafferty being one of my favorites as a younger man in the late 70's has his \\"Right down the line\\" covered and its right out of the park perfect for Bonnie's vocal and guitar stylings, I'd love to see this take off and get heard on radio. Nice video for this song, it should reach an audience with its message of love, in spite of it all. \\"Ain't gonna let you go\\", is also a tour ready performance that is so blues inspired I can't wait to hear this out in the road, in fact many of these tunes will just blaze on stage. \\"Use to rule the world\\" has that funk and groove that showcase Bonnie and the band, tight and ready to go, right from the first cut to the end of Slipstream, this is pure Bonnie with all her many sides, a joyful, and at times melancholy ride through these times. Couldn't be more happy for Bonnie, this is a knock out punch for the musical community!  I give this one a BIG A  Excellent new cdonna let you go\\", is also a tour ready performance that is so blues inspired I can't wait to hear this out in the road, in fact many of these tunes will just blaze on stage. \\"Use to rule the world\\" has that funk and groove that showcase Bonnie and the band, tight and ready to go, right from the first cut to the end of Slipstream, this is pure Bonnie with all her many sides, a joyful, and at times melancholy ride through these times. Couldn't be more happy for Bonnie, this is a knock out punch for the musical community!  I give this one a BIG A  Excellent new cd
B0055SWM08|5.0|I bought this on my iOS for a dollar and when I got my Android, I bought the new one for a dollar.  I'm glad for you that it's free though because this is a great game.  Relaxing and challenging, fun and soothing, perplexing and mellow.<br /><br />The soundtrack is great and the puzzles are increasingly difficult.  I still have not gotten perfect on the final stage.  Even if you don't play this game today, still get it and one day you'll be on the bus or sick in bed and it will kill a lot of time while not stressing you out.<br /><br />AMAZING GAME!
0307959856|1.0|There is more life and wit in the first sentence of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" than in the entirety of \\"Death Comes to Pemberley.\\"
3836501899|3.0|It's a neat flip through, but nothing too special.  I will look through it a few times before it hits the shelves and collects dust, but I'm sure if Polaroid ever gets brought up in a conversation, I'll probably bring it out and say \\"Take a look at this neat book.\\"<br /><br />Other than that, I wasn't terribly impressed as the theme just seems to be haphazard polaroids.  There is nothing wrong with that I suppose, but it left me desiring better.
B0063IH60K|5.0|took a little time to get use to it but I did. I highly recimend this for people who like it
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Deliciously addictive while relaxing and thought provoking at the same time.  For a dollar, you have to give it a try,  I'm glad I did!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|its a fun game reminds me of the game we played as kids wish it made more money and it didn't use real money
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is a very nicely crafted game. gameplay and graphics are excellent. unique puzzler. a definite must have for any puzzler enthusiast or beginner.
B006YTYIXG|5.0|In my opinion Max Cavalera is a true musician. He has helped developed three very succesful bands (Sepultura, Soulfly, Cavalera Conspiracy). All bands took off from what he created, and that is simply to say that only a true musician can be so succesful as he has been in his career. If you like the old sepultura, and Cavalera Conspiracy, among all the rest of Soulfly albums, this would not disapoint you in any aspects. \\"American Steel\\" my favorite song, should be actually called \\"Max Steel\\" because it sounds like old Sepultura when Max was in the band--a true master piece. Overall, the album has great riffs, drums, and Max's voice angry as you would like to sound. Enjoy!!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Well done!  A game geared towards people who enjoy a good exercise for the mind.  Beautiful interface,  soothing music and fabulous game play.  Overall a graphic delight and an absolute pleasure to play.  This is my second time playing Quell.  Also played Quell Reflect.  Both are must haves.  Worth every penny and will anxiously await a similar game from Fallen Tree Games.
B00753MBHA|5.0|This album in my opinion is just as good as \\"blood of the nations\\". These old school heavy metal legends know how its done. If you liked the previous album this is a must to your collection. Enjoy!!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its very much like Mario and it gets harder as you go. the graphics and sound effects are awesome! easy for kids to control too.
B00701QVVY|5.0|This could be included in one of their best. It might not top \\"Horroscope\\" or \\"The Years of Decay\\" or the \\"Ironbound\\" but sure is one album to be wrecken with. I believe the band tried extremely hard to put out an album that will be just as good as \\"Ironbound\\" and I believe they accomplished just that. This album in its own right got some good riffs, drums and snarling vocals, just what OVERKILL is and has been for a few dacades. Their true muscianship shows throughout their carreer that they stayed true to their fans, never backing down from THRASH METAL like other bands like Metallica. It is very sad to see that they never got the respect among the BIG 4. The Wrecking Crew is out and trashing and will thrash for quite sometime.

B002LL13AM|5.0|Despite all the criticisms that can be invoked (noises, breathings, nasal sniffs from time to time, captured on the tracks of this DG twofer) this recording of Maurizio Pollini featuring his version of the Well-Tempered Clavier Book I stands as a landmark in the recorded catalogue of all times. I have no doubt that from now on generations of pianists and audiences alike will take it as a reference version for this Everest in the keyboard repertory. Pollini dominates all the interpretive aspects of the work, seeming fond of looking and conveying the proper mood of each Fugue, of each Prelude. His tempos (here and there a little bit too brisk for a lazy, classical ear), his architectural conception of the whole (alternating violent outbursts with serene meditations) and his musical insight (quite bordering on a romantic approach) all contribute to this magnificent achievement. Maybe Maurizio Pollini will take into consideration to record soon the Book II too, in order to have accomplished entirely this Bach marvel.<br /><br />Don't hesitate to acquire this recording of the mature Pollini. Fully rewarding!

B0002ADY24|4.0|Uriah Heep \\"Firefly\\"  #166  (1977).<br /><br />This was kind of a return to form for the new Uriah Heep.  The 10th studio album brought in David Bowie bassist Trevor Bolder and Lucifer's Friend vocalist John Lawton.  Strong moments in. \\"The Hanging Tree\\", played this a lot on my college radio show.  \\"Wise Man\\", the excellent title track, the boogie of \\"Who Needs Me\\", a Lee Kerslake number and \\"Sympathy\\".  \\"Innocent Victim\\", came out in late '77.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a great Mario bros esque game. I rocommended it to all my android weilding freinds. Get this before Nintendo pulls it due to copyright infringement.
B000001F45|4.0|Uriah Heep  \\"Magician's Birthday\\"  #31  (1973).<br /><br />Uriah Heep's 5th studio release, \\"The Magician's Birthday\\", was a little slip over their previous album \\"Demons & Wizards\\".  Again Roger Dean graced his drawing on the album cover.  The band stayed the same for the first time.  The highlights include, \\"Sunrise\\", great start to the album, the piano ballad of \\"Rain\\", the Mick Box guitar of \\"Echoes In the Dark\\" and the two hits \\"Blind Eye\\" #97, with some fine bass lines by Gary Thain and \\"Sweet Lorraine\\", #91, just a good time rockin' and roller.  They came out with another solid release in 1973 on \\"Sweet Freedom\\".
B000022TSH|5.0|Jack Nicholson is great as a 1930's private eye in this classic film noir about the building of an aqueduct to supply southern California with water. More than a must see movie. It's a must get dvd.
B0002ADY1A|5.0|Uriah Heep  \\"Demons & Wizards\\"  #23  (1972)<br /><br />With artwork by Roger Dean, Uriah Heep brings us their biggest seller \\"Demons & Wizards\\".  Two new members joined the Heep for their 4th album, drummer Lee Kerslake (from the band Gods) and bassist Gary Thain (who performed with Uriah Heep up to late '74).  \\"Demons\\", starts off with the acoustic guitar before building into a classic U.H. rock number \\"Wizard\\", nice vocals by Ken Hensley.  The way-wah of \\"Traveller In Time\\", the top 40 hit in \\"Easy Livin'\\", #39, with it's organ rolls and dynamic vocals by Mr. David Byron.  The power ballad of \\"Circle Of Hands\\".  The great vocals by Byron on \\"All My Life\\", \\"Rainbow Demon\\", is a doom sounding song, great keys by Hensley.  The progressive medley \\"Paradise/The Spell\\", end the album with class.  Uriah Heep never got another five star review, but still had some excellent stuff to come.  Get the expanded edition, came out in 2004. The sound is awesome.  1973 brought us \\"Uriah Heep Live\\", #37 and their 5th studio offering in, \\"The Magician's Birthday\\".

B0050PYNP8|5.0|So cute, funny and heartwarming. A must for nerds, geeks and civilians alike. The language is very colorful probably not for the young ones.
B004UID2LC|5.0|one of my favorite apps. I can download any song and listen to it my car, at home, etc. I download videos for my son, and he can watch them anytime, even if there's no wi-fi. I have never had a problem with this, and no threats have ever been detected by my anti-virus app.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A $.99 well spent!! I wish all games were challenging like this one!! Not to mention that it takes longer than a day to finish it!! Love it!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this game is amazing! freeing the birds is way awesomer than killing a stubborn pig that refuses to die. but it is IMPOSSIBLE to get 3 stars. its kind of frustrating but it is an amazing game overall.
030796664X|5.0|I got the audio version and it made time fly by quickly.  It also gave me some good ideas to help with life, diet, work, and hobbies.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The book is well-written and kept the reader doubting who committed the crime, but it ended rather abruptly with no resolution whatsoever.
B0063IH60K|4.0|like it. a nice time filler with no bugs noted. now a preferred app in dead times at my workplace.
B0055SWM08|5.0|amazing &amp; mind blowing love every minute of it. great job on creating it. I got this app free but after playing I would have paid.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Simple and intuitive. Beautiful graphics.  The objects you interact with are ingenious. I love it. Here are more words in a simple review so i can make the minimum
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|This game SUCKS! DO NOT BUY!!! Because it keeps asking me to Force Close or Wait, then it takes too long. It freezes. Do not Buy on Kindle Fire!!!! On Apple Products Yahoo it works but not on the Kindle Fire or Nook Color!!!!!!! WARNING DO NOT BUY!!!!!!
B001CC7PPI|4.0|I received the DVD in a timely fashion. It was as I remembered it: a  very good film, One of Hitchcock's best. Only criticism : although it claimed to be digitally remastered the Definition was not as good as I was expecting, but I still enjoyed it.
B0055SWM08|4.0|pretty good game.  nice graphics.  interesting puzzles.  good number of levels.  might be looking for more levels sooner than later
B005JABSB6|4.0|they did exactly what they were supposed to do ... no complaints there ... the only thing is the top brim is kinda recessed and the glasses end up sitting on the tip of your nose ... but you can just fix that by putting the ear rests up toward your temples and volla not a big deal
B001W7V25W|2.0|adre rieu is great but this dvd will not play on my dvd player but have to play on my computer but the sound keeps disappearing I am not all happy with it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Buy it. love it. I bought it and played all night.  challenging game to try and finish puzzle in min. amount of moves.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is awesome. I love building virtually and acting like its the wild west. its just so so socool.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|I knew nothing about the Hunger Games trilogy prior to my reading it. I just grabbed a quick peak under 'other books you might be interested it' after I'd completed an order. I was hooked from the first in the trilogy. I enjoy a good action packed story and this story, plus the series is packed with action. I like the characters, their interaction, and their reasoning is all sound under the circumstance.<br /><br />Get the Hunger Games Trilogy. Read it. You'll enjoy it.<br /><br />I hope the movie live up to it.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|awesome game! need neighbors. invite mcksam. runs very smoothly on my kindle fire! cant wait to level up. I'm assuming the reason I cant get the Easter stuff because my level isn't high enough.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This games is a good brain teaser that will keep you busy for a bit if you dont use the hints and stride for perfects
B007DIQAXI|5.0|I had been waiting 6 months for this album to finally make its way to the US.  Over the last 5-10 years I have really been getting into Folk Alternative music.  If you like this type of music check out Blind Pilot, Mumford & Sons, and Freelance Whales.  This album is very catchy and I find myself playing the entire album over and over again to and from work with no need to skip a single song.  Every song on this album is very memorable.  My favorites thus far in no particular order are Dirty Paws, Slow & Steady, Little Talks, Lakehouse, Sloom, and Yellow Light.<br /><br />I am going to predict that this summer Of Monsters and Men will really take off much like Mumford & Sons did a couple of years ago.  Their U.S. single Little Talks is a catchy tune that is gaining much more playtime on Sirius XM and will soon hit local radio.  It will be deserving!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I received this case today for my Kindle Fire and was blown away by the quality of the leather and craftsmanship of the construction.  It is extremely discreet, stylish and looks like an old-world text of yesteryear.  As a bookish person who appreciates the tactile nature of reading a book, the visual trickery of the cover changed my guarded optimism of purchasing an e-reader.  I'll continue to buy books, but am glad that I went this route to enhance my business and travel reading experience.  Bring on the digital libraries!  One minor point...it would be great if the cover had a slot for a stylus.
B0055SWM08|5.0|what a great game! i have already completed about half the levels. i hope there will be more added soon!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun and challenging. Have enjoyed it thoroughly.  I recommend it if you like puzzle games. Lots of differentnlevels and great graphics.
B0055SWM08|5.0|you've got to use your brain to get the exact number of moves but its not so difficult that you have to give up if you cant figure it out! hours of good fun!
0545123283|4.0|The best way to describe Maggie Stiefvatars writing is beautiful. Linger, the second book in her Mercy Falls trilogy is the perfect follow-up to Shiver. The writing is consistent and the story picks up a few months after we left off, Sam still adjusting to his new lifestyle and Grace relishing in it. Their friend, Olivia, is officially a missing person and Isabel and Grace have become friends - despite the death of Isabels brother.<br /><br />Graces ever absent parents play a much larger role in Linger. Granted, that absent parents are one of my it pet peeves (the exception being boarding school) I wish Graces parents would go away! It's hard for me, that parents who have very much lived their own lives pick the most frustrating time to be actual parents. Of course, I am just such a fan of Sam and Grace that anything standing in their way is going to frustrate me.<br /><br />Cole is a new character, one I didn't like at first but whom I grew to love. My one hope for Forever is that we get to see more of both Cole and Isabel. Possibly together! (Hey, a girl can hope, right? I think they would be perfect together.) But back to Cole. He is one of the kids Beck brought back from Canada and while at first I didn't see his story line meshing with the rest, I get it by the end. Unfortunately, his story line left me with more questions than answers!<br /><br />In Shiver the main storyline revolved around Sam and his state of being. Linger however focuses more on Grace and what may have happened to her when she was bitten by wolves as a young girl. Again, if you are looking for a sweet romance with a paranormal twist? Maggie Stiefvatar's Mercy Falls series is for you.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it's a fun way to pass the time when I'm bored.  haven't had any problems on my kindle but I did have problems. with this app on my evo
B002LLE3PY|5.0|I had a house fire a couple of years ago, and lost quite a few CDs. I'm still having occasions where I decide to listen to something, look for it... And realize I never replaced the copy that melted. That's what happened with \\"Lizard.\\" So I bought this edition.<br /><br />This is the first album I've listened to in 5.1 and... WOW!!! I can understand that, say, a Little Richard record might not benefit much from this treatment, but for a band like Crimso... Again, wow. I immediately went looking for \\"Close To The Edge\\" and \\"Fragile\\" in addition to the KC, but I guess those haven't been done yet. I'll sure buy 'em when they are.<br /><br />As to the new mixes, my humble opinion (as a record producer and audio engineer, if that's OK) is that they're superb. The instrument sounds are reproduced faithfully, but far more clearly than they were in the original mixes. (And not *TOO* clean, if you know what I mean... I've heard some new Beatles remixes where they seemingly cleaned up so much of the muck that they inadvertently removed the glue that held the tracks together.) While I heard all the parts I expected to in the 5.1, strangely enough, a couple of things seemed to be missing in the new stereo mix. However, Fripp approved all of this, so I guess that's what he wanted.<br /><br />So... If you like this record, and aren't a vinyl fetishist, by all means buy this. It sounds great.<br /><br />I also ordered \\"Red,\\" and can't wait for it to arrive... :)
B005K2KCPG|3.0|Having just heard this whole album, it's a fine second effort to their debut CD but it doesn't grab me enough. Hagar's vocals sound more lacking than usual throughout for whatever reason. Not quite as pop-rock-ish as the first CD and more blues-rock based, it's clear they upgraded the lyrical content with some outside writing. Satriani continues his chunky style and rhythmic/lead fills on this record combined with some unusual guitar tones/70s/classic style vibe. I read Hagar say that he wanted some time off after the tour before recording again but the band wanted to push forward with the follow-up CD. Maybe that's why this record sounds a bit more like a jam to me with vocals lacking (except Michael Anthony's staple backing vocals).
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is great! Not only do my sons love it, but I find myself checking on the restaurant every day. It is comparable to the other story games by Team Lava. We have them all on our Kindle Fire and think they are all very fun.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. its so much fun. I mean what could be better besides 101 in 1 games (besides 102) great way to waste time if you have time to waste.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|couldn't put this book down and immediately ordered the 2nd one. love the characters, their transition and the journey suzanne takes them on!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is just like Mario but in a different world,I give this game 5 stars because it reminds me of super Mario bros.I would recommend this game to people if you like Mario related games
B0071XO8RA|5.0|My brother-in-law recommended this book to me on a Saturday, I downloaded it Sunday, and didn't put it down until Tuesday, when I finished the whole thing and began proselytizing to anyone within shouting distance that it is the Best. Book. Ever.<br /><br />Easy to get sucked into, hard to put down, and enormously satisfying both as a well-written story and as a thought-provoking social commentary. Leaves you thinking in dozens of different directions and looking at the whole world a little differently.<br /><br />Wool is a great book for advanced young readers all the way up to great-grandparents. A good conversation starter for book clubs or parents wanting to engage with their kids.<br /><br />A fantastic book.
1439153663|5.0|Book was recommended by a friend.  Ordered it and could not put it down. Found it very interesting and have passed it on to other people. Enjoyed how the two characters told thier own story.  Highly recommend it.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Slipstream is Bonnie Raitt's finest album in years. She sounds great on every track.  The diversity of the theme and tone of the songs makes this album special.  My favorite track is \\"Used To Rule The World\\".  This is a song about  people who once were on the top of the world.  This is a song sounds very groovy and funky.  The electric guitar playing gives this track a rock edge that I love.  This album has a good mix of fast and slow songs.  \\"God Only Knows\\" is my favorite slow song.  The piano playing is lovely on this track.  This song makes me comtemplate the purpose the of my existence on this planet.  I love the spiritual tone of this cut very much. \\"Not Cause I Wanted  To\\" is a very moving song about  the inscrutable reasons why a relationshp  did not work  out.  The acoustic guitar playing is beautiful. \\"Spilt Decision\\" is an upbeat song about the quick decisions people make that they some times regret.  This song pumps me up.  It is very fun to listen to.  \\"Million Miles\\" is the best blues song on the album.  The musical arrangements of this songs are absolutely superb.  I love the bass playing on this song. \\"Right Down The Line\\" is a classic pop love song.  The electric guitar playing by George Marinelli is so good. on this song.  Gerry Rafferty originally performed this song.  He would be very proud of Bonnie's cover of this song.  \\"Standing In The Doorway\\" is a lovely song.  Bonnie's vocals are very soothing.  \\"Down To You\\" is another fun upbeat song.  This is a song is a reminder to take responsibility for our own lives.  \\"Marriage Made In Hollywood\\" is a commentary song about how easy it is to become an infamous celebrity in Hollywood.  \\"Take My Love With You\\" is about how the love and strength  of a good woman  empowers a man.  I like this song a lot.  \\"You Can't Fail Me Now\\" is a similar song about people depend on each other.  Bonnie's voice conveys such wisdom and warmth on this song.  The music on this album is very entertaining.
B0064Z62R0|4.0|I'm a big fan of this type of music. After seeing the movie I purchased the soundtrack and love it.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Decently if simply written. It's not as detailed or engrossing as the Harry Potter books. Or as long. But a pretty good science fiction pretense and compelling main character. The secondary characters are very 2 dimensional though. I would recommend it, but not highly. A super quick read.
B0012HQKZE|1.0|Here's a recap:<br /><br />\\"CHARLES! WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO, CHARLES?\\"<br />\\"CHARLES! SAVE US, CHARLES!\\"<br />(bear attack)<br />\\"CHARLES!\\"<br />\\"CHARLES! SAVE US, CHARLES!\\"<br />\\"GET US OUT OF THIS MESS, CHARLES!\\"<br />(bear attack)<br />\\"CHARLES, WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO, CHARLES?\\"<br />\\"CHARLES!\\"<br />(predictable surprise ending)<br /><br />I think the name 'Charles' is used approximately 4,782 times in this movie.<br />Didn't care about any of the characters. Beautiful scenery. Good actors in a movie with bad writing.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|the only thing that I don't like is that it doesn't show the home button on my kindle fire and I had to download another one of the gameloft games in order to exit out of the game. I don't want to have to download a different game everytime I want to play.
B000NQRE0K|2.0|This is a graet movie. I only wish it would load and play on my LG BD640 Blue-ray player. Any help would be appreciated. LG has tried but no luck so far!
B004HW7JMY|5.0|If you like \\"Spartacus: Blood and Sand\\" you'll love \\" . . . Gods of the Arena.\\"  The back story makes the entire series even better.
B00009APK1|5.0|i bought this movie an it was still in the wrapper and looks and works amazing. it is a great movie
B0054JZC6E|4.0|cool game realty fun easy to play no lag fun for kids works great on kindel fire like old atarie gsmes
B0055SWM08|3.0|simple puzzles, but still somewhat fun. graphics aren't bad but they could have more animations. turned music off so I can't talk about that.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|In \\"The Descendants,\\" Matt King (George Clooney) is a lawyer and the sole executor of a huge parcel of land on a prime location on the Hawaii coast, but is inattentive toward his family.  After his wife goes into a coma as a result of a boating accident, he must take a more active role in parenting his two wayward daughters--this is challenging enough, even before his oldest daughter Alex (Shailene Woodley) drops an enormous bombshell.<br /><br />The film is another reminder that Clooney is one of the best actors of this generation--Matt's character has to make a tough decision about the land deal as well as handle thorny, complicated family relationships, and Clooney is just perfect in the role.  Woodley is outstanding in her role as well, and with her beauty and acting ability she should be a huge star in years to come.<br /><br />\\"The Descendants\\" is a well-acted drama that has believable characters attempt to deal with believable problems, but is not without a couple of funny moments as well.  The scenery of Hawaii is great, too, and the film deserved its five Academy Award nominations.  The movie was one of my three favorite films released in 2011.
B0055SWM08|4.0|This game reminds me of \\"Braid\\" oddly enough.  It plays a peaceful, almost nostalgic tune in the background the entire time you play.  Couple this with the art style and the theme of being indoors on a rainy day and you can't help but feel at peace.<br /><br />Puzzles in this game are delievered in blocks of 4. Which are then categorized in groups of three referee to as shelves (as this is how the level options are displayed to the player upon level choice). Each shelf is labeled with a year which leads me to believe there is a subtle story to be had here. What that story is I am not sure, but I assume you assume control of an old man or woman staying in from the rain looking out his window thinking back on his or her youth, or perhaps that of a young child trapped inside their grandparents' house from the rain and grows bored while looking outdoors and begins playing with the rain drops on the window glass.<br /><br />In terms of gameplay, this is a fairly simple puzzle game.  It is assumedly meant to be this way as it keeps with the theme of peace and tranquility.  Anyone looking for a real brain buster should look elsewhere.  Unfortunately this leaves us with a fairly short game that could easily be completed in one sitting.  Perhaps free level packs in the form of updates will remedy this.<br /><br />All in all Quell is a relaxing experience and worth the 99¢ price. Casual puzzle lovers and children will likely enjoy this one.
B006R1T40I|5.0|With no surprise to anyone, Bonnie's Slipstream is another gem from this living rock legend. A mix of blues, rock, folk, and funk. It' her best album to date. \\"Right Down The Line,\\" is a simply sublime cover. While \\"Used to Rule the World\\" has Raitt purring vocals to a funky beat and leaves us in love with her. Another funky meets country meets rock number is \\"Split Decision,\\" which reminds us of the magic of Bonnie Raitt.<br /><br />To sum it all up, Raitt's signature slide guitar playing is still superb, but even better are her ageless raspy sexy vocals. A must buy.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I like the way the game makes you think. Keep at it and pretty soon you'll be in the zone.<br /><br />  v
B0055SWM08|5.0|Relaxing. Truly relaxing. Great way to stretch your mind before work! I got my copy free, but this is worth more than the 99&cent; they normally offer it for.
B0002O06N0|5.0|I'd never even heard of the Black Keys until I saw them on \\"Austin City Limits\\" a few days ago and even then I wasn't that impressed. However, after listening to samples of their music I was hooked and ordered two albums from Amazon. I'm totally hooked! I didn't know music like this was still out there. I want every album they have produced!

0618918248|5.0|I really can't recommend this book highly enough. Richard Dawkins handled a potentially explosive subject with a matter-of-fact tone that is critical of religion and religious thought without being derisive or mean. I personally think everyone should read this book, but it might be especially important for people who are starting to become disillusioned with faith.<br /><br />I am a former Catholic who began to become disillusioned when I was asked to confirm at age 16. Since then, I've flitted from protestantism to Buddhism to \\"spirituality,\\" but this book ended my search for Truth. I can't thank Dawkins enough for reminding me how important evidence-based decision making is. Great, great read.
140053271X|2.0|Rec'd item in good order.  New in the box item.  No problems with seller or shipping, but the Kindle itself seems to be cheap quality.  Flickers when going from one page to another.  No back lighting so you must have a light on when reading.  It is lightweight and easy to hold compared to an I-Pad, but knowing what I know now I would have bought another I-Pad.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I am at a bit of a loss as to how to rate this book. I have a few ground rules: If I finish a book, it gets at least 3 stars. Frankly, I finished the book because so many of the negative reviews started out with \\"I couldn't even finish it!\\" Those reviews lose credibility with me immediately. I feel that writing a review on a book you haven't read is the height of irrogance. Who cares about your opinion on a book you haven't read? Get over yourself!<br /><br />However.... I have to confess that I too was tempted to put this one down within the first 3 chapters (in which case, I would not have left a review) but,I did finish the book and was still tempted to give it only 2 stars.<br /><br />For one thing, the writing really is terrible and repetitive. The plot put me in mind of a \\"Bridgette Jone's Diary\\"/ \\"Twilight\\" / \\"Can You Keep A Secret\\" type book where the most beautiful, ridiculously rich and sexy bachelor is inexplicably drawn to the bumbling female lead and falls head over heels in love with her despite all of the other eligible and more compatible females who flutter around the outskirts of the story.<br /><br />For another, most of the characters are lovable but superfluous. It is obvious that some offer absolutely no depth but were introduced just to move the story along.<br /><br />But what I will say for the book is that is very gratifying in that... There is a LOT of sex in this book. They get right to it and keep it up through the entire book. It would be excruciating if I had to read through this much terrible writing for one or two sex scenes or if I had to sit through too much character development or even too much conflict.<br /><br />So reduce your expectations: If you want great literature, read the classics. If you want erotica, read erotica. This is not it. If you want a fun story with great character development, read the Harry Potter series. If you want twists and turns, read a mystery.<br /><br />It's a quick read, over a relatively short period of time. The first two books span about a 5 or 6 week time period. There is a lot of sex, with an occasional day at the office. Clearly the author is British and writing about Americans, which would have been fine if she had done the proper research. But again, if you want good research, read a history book.<br /><br />One thing I do want to put out there is that any woman who has been raped or sexually molested in ANY WAY is not going to like this book at all. AND I hope the fact that so many women enjoyed it doesn't give men the impression that on some level all women are at least a little turned on by being spanked during sex. At least ask her first!<br /><br />So in the end, I gave it 4 stars. Three, because I finished it and one more just because the sex has been so good lately that my husband gifted me the second and third books before I could even finish the first one so there must be something to it.iod of time.

B0055SWM08|2.0|greetings fellow amazonians after taking all the secret recipes from my job I decided to go to our monthly union meeting and discuss how our workplace environment was.  I've never been that active in our union, but seeing the anger and dismay coming from my fellow co-workers meant that I had to do something.<br /><br />first, johnny reddog (he's native american) got up and said that he was tired of sitting in vats of milk for $8 an hour. Then timmy abernathy stood up and said that he has fallen off the top of the aging room 4 times and management didn't care. finally, george picard stood up and said that his manager demands 7 hours of overtime and refuses to pay him for it.<br /><br />that was it the crowd was incensed and ready to burn down the whole factory. so I thought quickly and I turned on a projector in the back of the meeting room and plugged in my kindle fire. there I started the app quell. I used its zen like qualities to calm the crowd as I went through each peaceful level. by the end of it they felt so one with nature that they went back to work no questions asked and I received a call from maury regarding how I handled the incident I will let you know how the meeting tomorrow goes with him. thank you amazon for being there for me during an union riot.

B006XF5BTG|4.0|This is an amazing book.  It contains the answers to most people´s questions about bodybuilding, fitness and health.  It deconstructs all myths regarding weight lifting and cardio activities and comes with effective ways for you to achieve your goals.<br /><br />The author also explains the science facts that support the info, and that´s great for credibility.  You don´t have to believe him.  All facts are there.<br /><br />But probably the most valuable thing of this work is establishing in a totally clear way what you must and mustn´t do to achieve 100% of your goals.  So if you can´t handle the lifestyle changing, you´d better re considerate your expectations.<br /><br />The only inconvenience is that it could be shorter.  The first pages are a little repetitive.<br /><br />If you really want to build a great body (fast) and live healthier, this book shows you shortest path.

1439170916|5.0|The Emperor of All Maladies is so beautifully written. It's much more than just an informative history book: it's a story with characters and mysteries. The story is full of hope but oftentimes despairing, too. The author takes us along to explore the philosophical issues of what \\"perfection\\" in life means when the mutated cancer cell, which causes so much harm, seems oddly like the perfection of never-ending life.<br /><br />The general trajectory of the book goes from ancient history to present day. The main focus is our efforts and failures to find a cure for cancer through politics, medicine, prevention, and understanding the biology of cancer. The story involves politicians and activists as much as it involves scientists, physicians, and patients.<br /><br />The book starts off with how we thought of cancer long before modern medicine. We tend to think of cancer as a modern-day illness, but it's probably the oldest disease we know of. We simply used to die of other diseases before our bodies had the chance to develop cancer. The author points out that \\"civilization did not cause cancer, but by extended human life spans - civilization unveiled it.\\" The author also tells us the origin of the word cancer - from the Greek karkinos, meaning crab. Hippocrates first coined the term because cancer reminded him of \\"a crab dug in the sand with its legs spread in a circle.\\" And the word \\"oncology\\" comes from the Greek onkos, meaning a mass or load or burden.<br /><br />The way scientists understood cancer and how that understanding evolved is fascinating. As we knew more and more about cancer, how we treated cancer changed as well. Doctors used to think that our bodies were made of humors - blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile - and that any illness was a result in an excess of one of the humors. Cancer was thought as an excess of black bile. As medicine moved away from humoral theory, surgery as a cure for cancer gained ground, though surgery itself never truly rid the body of metastasized cancer, no matter how much the surgeon cut out.<br /><br />Throughout the book, we also get to catch glimpses of other diseases, historical events, and scientific advancements and how they parallel with the cancer story. The advent anesthesia allowed for surgical removal of tumors. By far the most fascinating story is how the use of mustard gas as a chemical weapon during World War II led scientists to later use the same chemicals to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy - the most prevalent form of cancer treatment today - tries to cure cancer using the same chemicals used to kill and cripple millions of people. The irony blows my mind.<br /><br />I was surprised to find out that it wasn't until the 1980s that we actually began to understand how the cancer cell worked. I take it for granted that I learned in 9th grade biology that cancer was a result of mutated cells and the mutations were caused by genetics or carcinogens in the environment. Just a few decades ago, scientists were looking for some external cause of cancer, like a virus. (Viruses do cause some types of cancer, like the cervical cancer, but it's because they alter the DNA of normal cells, thus making them cancerous.) Even after learning about how cancer cells worked, the task of finding a cure was no less daunting. Scientists realized that it might actually be a more difficult feat than initially supposed. Every type of cancer is different, just like how every cell they derive from is different. Because of that, it's difficult to find a universal cure for cancer. Today, some cancers have very effective and targeted treatments, others respond well to chemotherapy, and still others have no effective treatment at all.<br /><br />The author is extremely vested in the subject he's writing about. Throughout the book, you can sense his frustration and disappointment with scientists who seemed blind to the ineffectiveness of radical surgery and continued to disfigure their patients by cutting out large portions of their body without effectively curing cancer. He's also critical of the War on Cancer - it brought the wrong attention and focus that cancer patients needed and created a political cure more than a medical cure. The author is most angry towards the tobacco industry and proponents of smoking. Lung cancer is the most preventable cancer, yet tens of thousands of people die from it every year simply because they smoke. While smoking as a personal choice is sort of a complicated topic, from an oncologist's point of view, I can see how it's frustrating that people keep doing something that they know could kill them. And it doesn't only affect your own body. Just like how obesity causing diabetes is crippling our health system, society ends up bearing the burden of people who acquire lung disease from smoking. The author does seem more favorable towards pharmaceutical companies, even though these companies get a lot of flack for not making drugs accessible enough, etc. Pharmaceutical companies played a big role in finding some of the most revolutionary treatments for cancer - ones that target the cancer cell and its processes instead of indiscriminately them along with normal cells.<br /><br />The author is also extremely literary, which is why this book doesn't feel like a regular dry non-fiction. He spends some time talking about illness as a metaphor, referring to Susan Sontag's 1978 book Illness as Metaphor and AIDS and Its Metaphors. Cancer is a disease for the modern times not only because it's more prevalent today, but because the disease itself is a metaphor for how we think of our lives and of society. Cancer is essentially a \\"corruption of our normal selves.\\" In older times, we tended to think that bad things resulted from external factors - e.g. germs and bombs - but today, we think that bad things are a result of our own actions or some internal corruption. Cancer is the perfect example of an internal corruption: there is no external germ that we can just remove from our bodies and rid ourselves of the disease.<br /><br />Some parts of the book were a little slow, but I think it's because I'm not a science person anymore and I find it more difficult to follow the inner workings of a cancer cell. I also would have liked to see more of how the cancer story played out in other countries - the book focuses mostly in the U.S. But the entire book was beautifully written. It really challenged the way I thought about life and illness. After reading all the stories of patients who've lived with cancer, I can't imagine being able to go through all that pain and suffering as well. But I think the pain is also most acutely felt by the people surrounding the cancer patient: family, friends, and doctors.<br /><br />The author leaves us neither hopeful nor pessimistic about the future of cancer. He's well aware of the difficulties we face and the naivete of thinking we can find a universal cure. But he also knows the progress we've made and foresees that we will only continue to progress in the search for cures. One of the most vivid metaphors he made was the Red Queen syndrome: \\"In Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass, the Red Queen tells Alice that the world keeps shifting so quickly under her feet that she has to keep running just to keep her position. This is our predicament with cancer: we are forced to keep running merely to keep still.\\"tting out large portions of their body without effectively curing cancer.

B005IZLPMY|3.0|This movie was very good but not great. Chris Evans did a good job. The story was nice and I really did like the movie. Only problem was that everything was too easy for Captain America. He bulldozed past everything with his shield, tanks included. Even the Red Skull who is also a super soldier was defeated easily after running in fear of Captain America for most of the movie. I had to get it to complete the Avengers build up stories though so I did.

0439023513|1.0|The first book was amazing. The second book was pretty good. This book was horrible. There isn't any real action at all in this book until the end and then when there is it feels rushed. There is no time to soak anything in. People just die fast and Katniss moves on. Katniss herself becomes so frustrating. She teeter totters between taking action and laying around being utterly pathetic. Peeta is so pointless in this book. He doesn't do anything noteworthy and his love for Katniss doesn't make any sense. It seems like he doesn't even really believe it at the end. It just something he does because it seems true. Gale gets a bigger role but I hate how he lets Katniss treat him like crap the whole time but still sticks by her. I did not like the resolution of the rebellion either. It was clear that the rebels were going to replace one corrupt President with another but the way Katniss ended it was so unsatisfying. This book was overall so frustrating that I was glad when it was over.<br /><br />***Spoiler***<br /><br />It was unsatisfying because I wanted Katniss to kill President Snow but she didn't. It felt like it needed to be done by her hands. Her decision to kill Coin made sense but it was unsatisfying.<br /><br />I hated that Katniss voted to continue the Hunger Games in the new government. That was lame. Kind of makes the war pointless. New faces same oppression.<br /><br />The love triangle resolution sucked too. Katniss got off the hook too easy. Gale basically leaves her so she didn't even have to make the choice of choosing Peeta (even though she would have chose him anyway). It took Gale long enough to leave her after she strung him along for three books. Even when Peeta was gone she treated Gale like dirt and showed him no affection whatsoever. It was obvious she would choose Peeta the whole time.

B004LWZW4C|5.0|The rest of the X-Men movies (including Wolverine Origins) were complete garbage. They were horrible. I was hoping this movie would be a reboot of the series but sadly it's more of a prequel type deal to the bad X-Men movies. The most disappointing aspect is that, with the exception of Beast, they didn't use the actual first class of X-Men in the first class movie.<br /><br />Other than that the movie was awesome. Magneto was a BOSS for the most part. Professor X was played very well. The Hellfire Club was a decent pick for the bad guys. The costumes were great. Blue and Yellow like they should be. Magneto had an awesome helmet instead of that dumb thing they made for Gandalf. The Wolverine cameo was great. It makes sense too since he is really so much older than everybody else. Good action and it's funny. Worth watching.

0545265355|3.0|As I said in the title, I really wanted to give the series a perfect 5... but I just can't... :(<br /><br />The main reason is I don't feel good and happy by the time I closed the last page of the last book. Instead, I feel confused, angry, and unsatisfied. As a writer myself, I know I can write a better conclusion to the story that doesn't change the intended ending at all. I just need to extend the last 3 pages into a new chapter of 20-25 pages. With that said...<br /><br />The goods:<br />1. It was really hard to put down the book(s) till the end.<br />2. It had a very interesting concept<br />3. It had lovable characters despite their flaws<br /><br />The bads:<br />1. The ending is too short and rather depressing<br />2. The romance element is too hurried and misses a lot of developments, especially in the last book<br />3. The characters had too many personality changes and mental issues in the last book and they spent more than 50% of the time in hospital or undergoing some physical/mental treatments. Gone are the strong protagonists you see in the first two books.

B0052U59F4|4.0|Finished the Fifty Shades Trilogy in one breath. What a story! I usually don't read romance novels except the classics; however, Fifty Shades of Grey got me read through not one book but all three. By the time I've finished the books, I was totally in love with this Mr. Grey, even with all his baggage. LOL.<br />I don't know how you can have so many orgasms day and night, still function well during the day, and have orgasm every time? Well, I'm not here to judge that, after all, it is a fiction. So anything goes. The erotic part actually gets old easily.<br />The reason I didn't give the book(s) five stars, because the writing itself needs to be polished. It needs some consistency in between the writing style and the development of characters. The third book is a little better or mature than the first one in writing.<br />Last but not least, since the setting is in the USA and characters are all modern Americans, I think the author really needs to pay close attention to the language and speeches in the 21st century of America, especially the young generations.

1401219268|5.0|The Watchmen limited series comic penned and drawn by comic legends Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons issued in the late 1980's reached new heights in genre bending graphic and \\"super hero\\" storytelling.  What had increasingly become a stagnant industry, where the same moralistic(if flawed) heros 'swooped' in to save the damsel in distress or citiznry in disarray against a cardboard villain, the Watchmen characters, built loosely around retired, archetypal Charlton Comics' characters were complex and multidimensional.  Set in an alternative future of 1985, where an arms race and potential, nuclear Armageddon sets the background, we are enveloped by this world with its several sub-plots and subtle humor, that it warrants re-reading.  The non-primary color choices by colorist John Higgins just add to the surreal nature of a time that 'Almost Was', in an era of 'Could Still Happen', against a backdrop of 'What If?'.  Get your hands on this and enjoy.

1451627289|5.0|This was such great fun to read.  It was gripping but also unhurried--in fact, the book was a lot like its main character.  The book, like the Jake Epping, was compelled to keep moving along, but at the same time, it/he seemed to want to slow down and really enjoy life. There are some ambling twists and turns that make Jake's long wait worthwhile. And King's writing has just gotten better and better over the years.<br /><br />I'm giving it 5 stars because I really loved the first 798 pages, but I have to say I was disappointed in the ending.  Maybe others will like it just fine.  It had its good points.  But I felt like it was rushed.  After all those pages of waiting and watching Jake plot, the end was just--blah.  Maybe it was the inevitable and proper ending, but I just wanted something different.  Nevertheless, I'm glad I read it.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I like how u get yr own restaurant.<br />plus you can visit people and give tips. the only bad thing about it is the food takes a long time
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow! After 5 years - I have never been happier that I own a Kindle.<br /><br />Couldn't put it down, and I kept wondering how and where the author did her research for those detailed, engrossing and highly erotic episodes. The characters are interesting and believable in a way that any woman can relate to.<br /><br />Back in the day there was an author named Harold Robbins that kept my mom and other ladies of her generation captivated with terrific stories and some very heated hook-ups. Well, finally my generation has our own author who knows how to weave a wicked tale that will leave you wanting more. I immediately bought the next 2 installments because I didn't want to miss a thing. And neither will you.<br /><br />This ain't no Bella & Edward. These books are for adults - for women out there who want something more than just \\"gazing longingly into each others eyes\\", blah blah blah. This one is a little rough - but you won't be able to put it down. You'll see.
B000PMG16U|5.0|Amazing movie george lucas is pure genius even though its backwards style the way the movies were made.i don't think we will ever see such a majestic saga like this one made again but I could be wrong lets wait and see!!
B005O64VJQ|5.0|This film \\"A FISH CALLED WANDA' is a must have. It is funny, smart. I have only had this copy for a ashort time and have viewed it twice.

B0064NTZ6W|5.0|This is one GREAT WW2 FILM. If you are interested in WW2 Films, this is the one to have. I love WW2 films and this is one of my favorites. It is thrilling and full of suspense and action.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I love to play this because it was free and it helps keep the mind occupied. I would recommend it for anyone.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|pretty entertaining. I like that you don't have to invite friends or spend money to get access to things you have to have in the game.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is awsome game it reminds me about super mario bros cool awsome radical its free cool leps world is fun
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is GREAT! If you enjoy Mario bros then you will enjoy this. I rated it 5 stars because it can be very addictive. I think the game is fun and it can relate to people of all ages. A fantastic app. Especially for FREE. very easy to control too. MUST DOWNLOAD.
1904994768|5.0|What i can say about this product is that it's amazing, better than expected and strongly recommended! Surely worth the money expended.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|the game was really good. it handled well. sortable like Mario bros for kindle.  the buttons need to be better arranged.  it take getting use
B004XNPQUO|4.0|I like physics games, and I like the multiple missile types and level manipulation features this game offers. This game is an excellent example of it's type, but it's nothing special in terms of graphics or other high-powered features. I return to this game whenever I have 5 or 10 minutes to spare in some random public place.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|A Disney-esque fable about a self-taught rat who becomes a great chef by pulling the hair on a dopey kid who happens to be the illegitimate offspring of another great chef.  Suggests that anyone can fulfill their dreams if they really try and at the same time that you can also succeed if you're a lucky goofball who lets a smart rat pull your hair and manipulate you like a marionette.  Its reasonably good entertainment for kids and adults.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|ok doubting thomas, you're getting all 6 Star Wars films on Blu-ray!! do you really need to be reading this to help you decide whether or not to get this when you already should have already bought it. Fox Films already does a superb job with High Definition transfers, but also this is George Lucas's Legacy we're talking about so obviously he oversaw the entire process, making it that much more kick-ass. that being said if you're to own any film(s) on Blu-ray, Star Wars is the way to go!
B002ZG976U|4.0|LOVED THIS MOVIE! A GREAT MODERN MUSICAL. CHER WAS TERRIFIC & CONTINUES TO IMPROVE WITH AGE. CHRISTINA WAS FANTASIC...SHE IS SO TALENTED. NEVER PAID TOO MUCH ATTENTION TO HER MUSIC BEFORE. I AM IN THE OLDER GENERATION BUT THIS MOVIE WAS GREAT! BOUGHT THE DVD SO I CAN KEEP WATCHING IT WHENEVER I WANT.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I think that this app is very well put together.  This app has a clean design and is very entertaining.  the levels are challenging, but not so challenging that it's not fun to mess around on.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a nice little game to pass the time away. one of the best free apps of the day.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I am not a Woody Allen fan, not saying anything against him I'm just simply not a fan. But, this was an excellent movie. A story about a writer being thrown back in time to the 20s and meeting the Fitzgerald's and other famous notables from film and literature history. It was original and beautiful. I am absolutely in love with this movie, so much so I've found myself curious and wanting to give other Woody Allen films another chance. If your a literature/art/film buff than you'll likely love this film as much as I do.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this app is amazing as good as or better than mario. i had this on my iphine but i ljke it better on the kindle fire because its a bigger screen. please get!!!! trust me
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've been waiting a long time for some solid science fiction with a creative premise. Wool delivers.<br /><br />The writing is engaging, the characters are fleshed out, and the pacing is dramatic. Fearless writing where no character is totally safe, and the plot twists are truly surprises.<br /><br />I can't wait for more from this author.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I like it. Nice easy going game. some challenge but not difficult. also runs great on my fire. could do a hole lot worse.
B003EYVXV4|5.0|I absoluteley love The Hunger Games! I would recomend it to everyone as long as the are old enough to handle the violence in the movie. Once I heard that they were making this movie, I got on amazon and ordered the books. Once I had the first one in my hands, it only took two days to finish! Thats because I couldn't put the book down! So now I have finished all three books TWICE!!! Love the books, Love the movie, and Love everything about the hunger games!
0385738773|3.0|I agree with many of the other readers.  While I couldn't put the book down, I don't feel satisfied by the book at all.<br /><br />I don't feel like I got answers to most of the questions I had, and was actually left with even more questions.  I did not like the lack of resolution between Thomas and Teresa.  I almost felt as this was the story line of the middle of a series and not the end.<br /><br />I was disappointed, the other two books in the series were much better.<br /><br />That said, if you've read the other two books you should definitely read this, and if you are interested in the other books you should read them all.  I would still recommend the series.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Well built and plenty of fun. The levels are crafty and the game works well. It is a great game to take up time with.
1452101248|5.0|I've made 6 or more recipes from this book now and am not disappointed in any of them.  The instructions are easy to follow and the pictures beautiful.  The only drawback would be procuring some of the ingredients.  I am lucky to live near Kalustyan's so it's not a problem for me but others may not be so lucky.
B0052U59F4|4.0|I thought that the trilogy was very fast reading but it could have been completed in one book instead of three books.  I don't mind some sexual contents but there was just too much of that for the entire story.  As I said, it could have been done in one book.<br /><br />I think it is a great summer read for women.
B001DHXT20|4.0|I just viewed the '03 and '08 versions back to back and it's interesting comparing their strengths and weaknesses because they're essentially the same movie. The main difference is that the '08 version omits the conflict Bruce has with his father and exchanges the Absorbing Man (Bruce's father) for the Abomination.<br /><br />The 2008 version starts out better than the 2003 version, more interesting and entertaining, but tends to lose steam by the third act with the ultra-cartooney fight between Hulk and the Abomination. By contrast, the '03 version starts out slow and relatively boring but strongly revives interest by the 90-minute mark when the Hulk has that spectacular rampage that starts in the desert and ends in San Francisco, which lasts a whole 22 minutes. In fact, this rampage is easily one of the most entertaining action pieces in the history of cinema and worth the price of admission. The '08 version has some quality action, for sure, but nothing that even comes close to the main rampage in the '03 version.<br /><br />Edward Norton in the '08 version plays a better Bruce Banner than Eric Bana. Not that Bana isn't likable, it's just that he's simply too much of a tall, muscleman to fit the role. He looks like he could kick some serious arse without even becoming the Hulk, which takes away from the whole concept.<br /><br />Although the Hulk in the '08 version has a grittier overall appearance, the filmmakers opted for a snot-greened hue, whereas the '03 Hulk has a better shade of green. Furthermore, '03 Hulk looks more realistic and less cartooney, although the facial features of the '08 Hulk are excellent.<br /><br />The '03 version also shows the Hulk jumping around with incredible leaps - almost flying - as he does in the comics, which the '08 version barely implies. The likely reason for this is that the filmmakers rightly realized they couldn't even touch Ang Lee's film in this area.<br /><br />Of course the '03 Hulk is bogged down by the origin story, while the '08 version breezes through it in literally 3 minutes. To make matters worse for the '03 version, changes were made that slow the story down and needlessly complicate it. In the comic Bruce Banner became the Hulk after accidentally being exposed to gamma rays from a huge government test-bomb in the desert. In Hulk '03 the Hulk's origin is complicated by being tied to Bruce's mad scientist father who experimented on him when he was a little boy. Although one has to allow some latitude in comic-to-film translation these changes definitely slow the story down and make the origin less immediately gratifying. BUT it does offer a father/son conflict to the table.<br /><br />The '08 version changes the Hulk's origin as well, making it similar to the TV show, plus tying it in to the \\"super soldier\\" serum. The '08 version wins the prize on this front.<br /><br />Some say that the '08 version opts for brawn over the brainy approach of the '03 version, but -- with the exception of Hulk's fight with the Abomination at the end -- this isn't even remotely true. Each film has a lot of drama and I was impressed with the reverent, realistic tone both films have in their non-hulk portions. Banner's relationship with Betty Ross is particularly well-done and moving, especially in the '08 version. Great job by the principles here -- Bana, Norton, Jennifer Connelley and Liv Tyler.<br /><br />Great soundtracks in both versions.<br /><br />So, both films are quality Hulk flicks with some great moments and the '03 version with its spectacular 22-minute Hulk rampage, but each have their strengths and weaknesses. Take the best parts of both and you'd have an incredible Hulk film! (Sorry)<br /><br />Needless to say, if you're a Hulk fan it's necessary to purchase BOTH films.<br /><br />GRADE: B+while the '08 version breezes through it in literally 3 minutes.

B002LAM7PI|1.0|I couldn't hear the movie very well so I had to go back and rewind it many times but it would get even worse. The picture was blurry and most of the time, I didn't even know what they were saying! This happens all the time when I buy movies from Amazon all the time!

B00008AWOG|3.0|Having by now established a relatively sizeable following to the degree that their fourth album, Still Life, was awaited with much expectation and received with even more hype by a metal scene desperate for a hero, Opeth essentially refines their approach to what they have dubbed \\"Extreme Progressive Metal\\", a label that is as misguiding and ill-conceived as the band's creative output. For sure this is an incredibly talented outfit in the technical sense, and lurking somewhere within their convoluted forms is a powerful creative vision compromised by conceptual pretense and compositional disconnection, but when it comes down to transporting the listener beyond the basic surface aesthetic to existentially motivating and profound realization, Opeth completely disappoint.<br /><br />Remaining faithful to the heavier, more direct approach of My Arms, Your Hearse while improving on its production, rhythmic fluidity and expressive clarity, Still Life suffers through much of the same obstacles as that work, namely confused structure, a tendency to meander into conceptually unclear territory for the sake of dynamic variety and a rather subdued character of expression in both aggressive and relaxed passages that keeps the music from ever penetrating the listener with emotional depth. Though for the first time in their recording career Opeth have written songs that actually revisit thematic events in returns of earlier riffs and melodies within the track, making it easier to identify individual compositions by a main idea, while songs like \\"Face of Melinda\\" and the token acoustic track \\"Benighted\\" actually build upon a unifying theme, these developments are displayed with too much inconsistency to make this the timeless classic many hailed it to be upon arrival.<br /><br />The guitar work is technically proficient but no single riff or melody can be said to be definitive within the style or clearly representative of the chosen concept-oriented story of vague poetic style forthis album; there is the expected lacing of aggressive, edgy metal riffs, some of which are surprisingly rigid in rhythmic shape, with elegant melodic leads and frequent acoustic passages, but this has all become too anticipated to justify the absence of any powerfully expressive moments that resonate beyond the simple amazement of instrumental prowess. Mikael's ferociously hostile roaring is sometimes poorly arranged and out of context, while his melodic clean singing is the most impressive it's ever been, but the expectation fulfillment of using the growling voice for loud sections and the quiet voice for mellow parts drains this music of imaginative potential.<br /><br />\\"Cloak-captured sighs of relief<br />As the primal touch brought me back<br />And the last sight I did see is still here<br />Beckoning right behind me\\"<br /><br />The listener is guided through wayward, vast expanses of thematic exploration in lengthy, embellished compositions emphasizing the contrast between loud and quiet expressions of some vague emotion, never reaching anything in the way of conclusive climax to unify the conflicts within these elaborate pseudo-epics. The music desperately wants to be powerful and beautiful, but is too unthreatening and dispassionate to be either, ending up as mere musical wallpaper; it is pleasing to the ear because of its instrumental proficiency and aesthetic veneer, but despite a number of excellent moments it never reaches into the soul of its audience to awaken and inspire.<br /><br />Many hail this album as one of the greatest metal works of all time, and on the surface it is easy to understand why, as it is excellently performed, expansive in scope, abundant in dynamic contrast and variety and offers a unique sound through its particular stylistic combinations. It is admired for its fluid, reflective style of motion which seems to provide an uncommon depth of immersion, and while this aspect of Opeth's approach is not without its appeal, the lack offormal definition and thematic unity robs this motion of contextual harmony. It is not enough to establish variety; unity gives that variety a context with which to identify thematic definition and relate it to experience. This is where Still Life falls short, while painting a pretty picture of safe ambivalence.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is fun! its challenging but yet simple! would recommend this for someone looking to pass the time with a brain teaser
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game is one of the first of its kind I have really ever played. I am not much of a gamer and I was worried I wouldn't be able to play it. I was wrong. The puzzles are challenging-but not impossible with enough thought, The hints guide was beyond helpful but at the same time not so clear as to take the fun away from figuring out the puzzles. The graphics are stunning and just beautiful to look at, and the soundtrack and effects are lovely- really putting you in the scene.<br /><br />I would highly recomend this game to anyone. It's SO much fun!
B001EN71CW|5.0|So, I read all the reviews I could to see whether or not the Blu-Ray version was much better than the DVD's up-converted. The reviews seemed to be 50/50, half the reviews saying the Blu-Ray images blew the DVD out of the water, and the other half saying it didn't look any better. I took the plunge, sold the DVD's to relatives and bought the Blu-Ray discs. I have now watched the first four episodes on disc 1, and I can confidently say...  I'm not sure.<br /><br />I was not really blown away by the difference in quality between the Blu-Ray version and watching the DVD's up-converted on my Blu-Ray player. I believe there are places, certain scenes, (maybe the outer space shots) where the Blu-Ray shines a bit more, but I am not overwhelmed. I am now wondering if the movie (Serenity) will be different. That will be next on my agenda.<br /><br />I still give the review 5 stars because this is an amazing fun show. Its premature cancellation was a tragedy!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I don't understand how this book has so many good reviews. I am a very lenient critic when it comes to books, but this one just didn't cut it. It lacked character depth and everything seemed pretty predictable. I was waiting to be intrigued by Christian's \\"charm\\" and Ana's... I don't even know what good attributes she possesses, she's probably one of the most vapid main characters I've ever came across. She also became quite annoying, rolling her eyes and biting her lip every other second. I couldn't finish the book for the life of me, I gave up at about 75%. It was most definitely a waste of my time and my ten dollars.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun. and there is a lot to unlock so it takes a while. yeah. you should get it :)

B004W2UBYW|5.0|Walter Isaacson wrote about the story of one of the greats of recent times. Many a time, I see authors encourage inspiration by means of elaborate and careful writing; no such methods are used in this book. Mr. Isaacson wrote a simple worded, coherent and mostly chronological account of Job's life. It is because of the purposeful writing choice applied to this book that I enjoyed every page of reading. The author knew that Steve Job's life was inspirational and that no elaborate writing was required to achieve such inspiration. It's a very long book that felt like a short story as it was easy to read and often energized me to go \\"out there\\" to try my hand at life.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|After reading the first five books of Game Of Thrones, going to the video was a risk. The books are masterful. The video is equally masterful. This vast story is presented in the elevated tone it deserves. It need not be compared to any other epic; it is simply grand.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I fell for the Today show plug also gals! I am convinced someone knew someone to get that spot to air as a favor! NO WAY book clubs are going on and on about this series unless they are well, nevermind. Each is own I guess. I like a hot and racy good book but this was so over the top with sex, sex, sex I was actually falling asleep in them!! Thats pretty sad when you fall asleep in the middle of sex, even if its in written form, haha! This comming from someone who couldn't put Twilight down so that should be a pretty good clue here...pass on the books!  I moved from getting back into reading with the twilight craze from a babysitter going on and on but have since read tons and I mean tons of great authors and series and this was the worst set of books I have read since I picked reading back up a few years ago. I can read almost anything but this set of books was a struggloe to get thru. I still am only at 87% of the last book but could have told you totally how the book would play out from page 1. Not well written, like the other bad reviews mention the over use of silly things like bitting her lip or his skilled fingers and the \\"Inner Godess\\" thing is a cute idea but she knows how to beat a dead horse to say the least. Also I have been around the block a few times if you know what I mean and the sex is almost unbelivable... Yes, I can have a earth shattering orgasim but come on, I just don't belive the over the top crazy, melt when he walks in the room EVERY time he just looks at her crap. Also, a true dom, much less the one she portrays him as would tire of plain ol \\"vanilla\\" as the books put it..Not very real world in my opinion. Gosh I could go on and on but must stop myself... If you want tons of sex and a better plot (ummm, a plot) go for some \\"Sookie Stackhouse or Anita Blake Vampire hunter\\" Tons of sex and much better stories even if they are predictable by the # of books they are at now. Hope this helps someone save there $$.
B007DIQC90|5.0|This album is one of, if not the best, album of the year.  The jubilance is hidden in the melancholy of the music.  The song, \\"Love, Love, Love\\" is possibly the best song on the album, until your mood changes subtly and \\"King and the Lionheart\\" takes over as the best song, and so forth. And, they are addicting!  Catch these guys before your friends do and then become the hippest dude on the block.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|only on level3 so far. colorful graphics well designed runs smoothly on my ZTE Warp.i would recommend this game to avid majong players.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|This movie is great from start to finish!... It takes you on a journey from earth to mars and tells a 100 year old story from the book by Edgar Rice Burroughs,the father of Science Fiction, who has inspired todays film makers like George Lucas, Stephen Speilberg, James Cameron, Gene Roddenberry.  See the ORIGINAL Sci Fi story brought to life epicly by the oscar winning director of Wall E and Finding Nemo, Andrew Stanton.  You will fall in love with the characters of this film that keeps you wanting more when its over... I have already seen the film in theaters 4 times and can't wait for this Bluray + DVD to be released!  If you can see this on the big screen before it leaves theaters do it now. You will regret it once you see the DVD. A must see film!...
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|the game is amazing.  I hope they add more to it in the patches.and maybe lower the priceson energy.would pick this up on Pc if they made it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it is lots of fun but takes up a lot of memory and kills a battery but that is just for playong hours at a time got this on my kindle fire and my cell phone

B006ZZC3D6|5.0|I enjoy \\"Fling!\\" quite a bit.<br /><br />It's a fun and addicting puzzle game, and although it's VERY similar to other games out there, I don't think that should detract from the fact that it's a well made, fun, and challenging little puzzler.<br /><br />I like the graphics and sound, and the overall gameplay is very entertaining to me.<br /><br />Recommended.
0307951529|4.0|I thought this book was just wonderful because it takes a very daunting proposition for most people and makes it seem simple because it is based on your own passions.  It makes you believe that if you follow your passions you will do well in the long run and you are far more likely to be happy as well.  It is written in a simple way that is easy to follow.  I found it so motivating and it got me going on some things I have wanted to get started for a very long time but got stalled out on. This \\"jump start\\" back into my past plans was just one of the things I liked about this very up book and it was worth the time for that reason alone. Lots of info here about many aspects of starting on your own and I always like the \\"stories\\" format taking a look at different people's success stories. Energizing!

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Very disturbing series, but couldn't put the books down.  Being a parent of adult children, I found the premise of the story difficult and not sure suitable for readers under the age of 16. For me, an avid paranormal and scifi fan, there was a lot of explicit violence.<br /><br />The books were an intense and fast read for me and was totally immersed in to the books; couldn't wait to start the next book to find out what was next.<br /><br />I do agree this book left me hanging with the deaths of the supporting characters.
B000B5OD4I|4.0|The watch itself is great.<br /><br />Seikos are known for their durability, reasonable accuracy (they are automatics, not quartz), and given the 50%ish discounts off of MSRP available from time to time, I do not think that there is another watch out there that matches it for quality and value.<br /><br />Now, onto a matter of taste. I think the band feels cheap, as the inner links are hollow. This is not an attempt at deception by Seiko, this sort of band is popular (in fact, the bracelet is similar in style to the band on a Rolex Datejust Oyster Perpetual - http://www.amazon.com/Rolex-Datejust-Oyster-Perpetual-Stainless/dp/B0006JHQLG/ref=sr_1_2?s=watches&ie=UTF8&qid=1334072731&sr=1-2), but I just don't care for it.<br /><br />So, as long as you like a lighter band, or plan on swapping out the band, this is a great watch.<br /><br />For me, I like more weight on my wrist, so I returned it (plus, the box was beat to hell, the papers were dog eared, etc. so I am pretty sure it was returned once already)
B0052U59F4|5.0|After all the hype...I really thought that it would be a bust...but were very impressed...good writing and storyline...it was erotic, exotic...and I needed a cigarette when I finished this one...also very informative...LOL>>>
B005EGXTEE|4.0|Even though the book was written for teenagers, as an adult I still found it a good book to read and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Very well written with an interesting new concept that draws you into the story and lets you form a bond with the characters. Keeps you guessing as to what is going to happen right until the end. Well worth a read.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great app but energy runs out way to fast and hard to exit app.............. also is very fun even though the defects
B0055SWM08|5.0|Always tempted me even as a paid app, and is almost too good to be true as a free app! Smooth graphics and logical game progression are highlights.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is a nice free alternative to super smash bros . it is kind of of season but it's still good.5 stars!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I have the kindle fire edition of this game and I love it! it is incredibly responsive and it makes me think.
B004XNPQUO|2.0|This app was pretty cool in the beginning but it got old and difficult very quickly. This game could be more entertaining, but it has a good idea.
B002G7UFJQ|3.0|I should have gotten the book when I was in my twenties (over 30 yrs. ago!).  But then again, even in my Hippie-dippy days, I didn't particularly care for the countless fonts, script sizes and reading in circles.  If you are seeking solid substance and inspiration, read \\"The Discourses\\" by Meher Baba.  If you took out the repetition  and redundancies in \\"Be Here Now\\", the book would be about 30 pages.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|The best thing about this game is the graphics, which are really good for an app like this. I loves this game!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|if you like the super Mario games you will like this one. its the same thing just with a leprachaun.
B007MNV5WU|4.0|Great game, but just like any Angry Birds game, it can be a bit repetitive and tedious. So far my far my favorite of the bunch :D
B0063GORYU|4.0|This app is very easy to use and has good graphics. I just wish there was a pop-up message when you have no available moves. For people who do not like hints much time can be wasted looking for possible moves when none exist.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut the Rope is a fun game. The levels are challenging and sometimes you have think outside the box. Great game :D
1439153663|5.0|Our book club just discussed this book and it was a favorite by all.  An exceptional book that is full of twist and turns, it truly keeps you reading every chance you get.  Emotionally attached to all the characters in a positive or negative manner this book is must read.
B005T87QCI|2.0|I am very dissapointed. Definately not what I expected. The graphics are worse than the screenshots show, and the gameplay is hard and unenjoyable. After trying four or five times, even on Easy, I could not accomplish a win. Not worth $0.99, and most certainly not worth your time unless you are accustom to jamming the screen repeatedly. 2 stars :(
0525423281|5.0|Besides waiting until I could collect my thoughts and put them down into coherent, readable sentences, I used this month as a sort of test. As much as I love Stephanie Perkins, I had to wonder about what made her books so special? While I waited in this month to write this review, and pushed all the squealing back in, I thought about this. And you want to know what I came up with? I. Don't. Know.<br /><br />And when you fall in love, sometimes it's just better to be surprised and not understand, because otherwise it gets hard to feel THE MAGIC of it. I can't deny that Perkins's books are magic, of the purest, truest, most addictive form, which can't be conjured or crafted in any spell, but one that springs solely from the heart.<br /><br />I give you, 6.5 reasons why I heart Lola and the Boy Next Door:<br /><br />1) The Side Characters<br /><br />One thing you have to remember when picking up a Stephanie Perkins novel: every single character counts. No one ever falls into the backdrop. Even Lola's best friend's father, while not a major character at all, produced a smile from me upon our first meeting. And I don't even know the guy.<br /><br />Perkins has a way of writing characters that are living proof of the Onion Effect. You peel back one layer and you find so much more than what you see on the surface. Whether that surface is pristine or tattered is entirely irrelevant. It's guaranteed that you'll find depth in these characters AND LIKE THEM FOR IT, even when you should hate them.<br /><br />This is something I can count on every time I encounter a new character. And I loved this about Lola, and even Anna! And how Lola interacts with these characters of many shapes and sizes seizes your affection for this book and Co. From her quiet, investigative-by-nature best friend, Lindsey, to her lovable pair of dads, Lola's friends and family take the cake as far as best characterizations. You WILL be envious of the people she is fortunate enough to have in her life.<br /><br />1.5) Surprise Guest Stars<br /><br />Or should I say not so surprising? There's been huge talk about Anna and Etienne's planned appearance in Lola. And while I was excited for that, I didn't expect to see SO MUCH of them! And I'm so happy that Perkins was intuitive to know that fans would so appreciate their huge roles in Lola and Cricket's love story.<br /><br />And somehow, it was better to read them under these circumstances, through another set of eyes. They seem THAT much cooler. And the romance that sparked the love for Perkins to begin with, IS STILL very much there only threefold. I gushed with pleasure every time I got a glimpse of their superspecialawwww moments!<br /><br />2) Lola<br /><br />Honestly, I didn't know what to expect from Lola the character. It was easy to develop a sketch of her in my imagination, and her kind of character already seemed likeable. But, I didn't expect her to be so... so... realistic in spite of her eccentricites. For a girl who's out-there, she's very real; a girl who makes silly decisions, has insecurities (the read-between-the-lines kind), and quirky aspirations.<br /><br />And the best part? She IS NOTHING LIKE ANNA. So many authors who write companion novel series fall into that trap of telling the same story with different characters and vice versa. I wanted Perkins to break that mold, and she delivered. Lola is original, her own person, and while compatible with Anna, she retains this awesomeness that's completely unique to her character.<br /><br />3) Cricket<br /><br />Cricket Bell is no St. Clair, and I applaud Perkins for her ability to create TWO such heart-melting, swoon-worthy guys. Two boys who make you sigh wistfully for two totally differently reasons.<br /><br />St. Clair is the Superfly Artsy European Mutt dude who makes every passerby fawn over him with his heartstopping good looks. Cricket would make me stop in my tracks and stare for a completely different reason: he's odd in his own right. He has crazy inventor hair, habitually wears rubber bands on his wrists and pinstripe pants, and is charming and sweet. The fact that I still REMEMBER all of that a month after reading this book speaks volumes.<br /><br />4) Family Matters<br /><br />The family dynamic is obviously different from the typical mom-dad scenario, being that Lola has two fathers, but toss out any misconceptions you may have had about being raised by gay parents. Because Nathan and Andy prove THAT YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. :P<br /><br />If there was an award for favorite fictional parents, Nathan and Andy would get top scores. They'd beat out everyone (except maybe Mia's parents from If I Stay).<br /><br />5) *sings* I love the way you love...<br /><br />The last thing I want to do is give anything away about the romance (especially). It's so important that you read it and feel the SLOW BURN that is part of Perkins's style thus far. It's agonizing, full of hard choices, but ultimately it left me in a WOWed state, in which I took the time to bow down to the amazingness that is Stephanie Perkins. I promise, you will not be disappointed Anna fans!<br /><br />6) What I've come to call the Stephanie Perkins Flair<br /><br />The pacing, the writing, Stephanie Perkins knows how to weave a tale. Her writing is friendly and fun and inviting. Insightful. And at times poetic-like. There's a warmth and allure to her books that can easily be described as incomparable in the face of so many YA books out right now. If you've been skeptical up until now, don't be! You will not regret reading this series!<br /><br />A misconception that could perhaps cost you a limb...<br /><br />This a companion novel, friends. You do not need to read Anna (although I advise that you do, so that you can appreciate Anna and St. Clair's presence more) in order to read and love Lola. So, if in fact you encounter this book in your travels before Anna, do not hesitate to read it. It's a win either way, whichever way you do it.s crazy inventor hair, habitually wears rubber bands on his wrists and pinstripe pants, and is charming and sweet.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Its a family fun game. I think every one should try this game at least 5 times before deleting it.
B0050VFRVG|5.0|I actually saw the movie first before reading the book, and I can honestly say that, while entertaining, the movie does NOT do this book justice. Riordan incorporates Greek mythology in the most excellent way - it serves as a totally engrossing aspect of the novel, and a fundamental one. The idea that Greek gods and goddesses have demigod children currently living in our world, some oblivious to their own power, is ingenious and - get this - somewhat believable. As in, I could actually visualize this tale occurring in our present reality. It's not all that far-fetched.<br /><br />12-year-old Percy Jackson is one huge barrel of laughs, that kid is. With this novel being told in first person POV, I really got inside Percy's head and feelings. Some of the things he would say... I cracked up a ton throughout the story! I just couldn't help it. Percy's funny without even really trying. And his reactions to the unfolding events within the book were completely genuine and believable. His resentments, determination, and overall courage completely charmed me. The fact that he's willing to take on this ominous quest, however impure his intentions, and constantly defend his friends, caught me instantly. Percy Jackson is the latest addition to my mental list of amazing heroes.<br /><br />And Percy's aforementioned friends, Grover and Annabeth, are really great additions to the overall cast. The three of these characters together made a pretty fantastic trio. Although Grover is somewhat of a scaredy cat and is pretty shy, he's sweet, and despite his pressing fears, he continually goes out of his way to defend both Percy and Annabeth. And Annabeth is also brave in her own right, and is incredibly smart. Her dislike of  Percy made for some utterly hilarious scenes. Plus, it's kind of obvious that once Annabeth and Percy grow up a little more they'll become a romantic duo - which I'm extremely looking forward to.<br /><br />Then there's the dangerous quest the three of them set out on. A mysterious someone has stolen an object of importance from a particularly powerful god who is, understandably, very, very distraught by this. As a result of the theft, war is fast-approaching amongst the gods, one which will undoubtedly force them to choose sides. Someone is cleverly pitting the gods against each other, and it's up to Percy to retrieve the missing object, put a stop to the upcoming war, and convince the gods that they are being manipulated. This proves to be a near impossible feat when you take into account the fact that Percy Jackson and his friends are super young, and have to get to the other side of the country - facing many foes in the process - to track down the source of this raging problem, all the while dealing with meddlesome gods, a lying stepfather who could care less about Percy and Percy's mom, who's more interested in acquiring money, ending in a face-off with the intimidating, fearsome King of the Underworld himself.<br /><br />Full of adventure, puzzling circumstances, encounters with deadly agents of the Underworld, and that feeling of \\"a race against time,\\" THE LIGHTNING THIEF is a consuming read that captivated the hell out of me, and has left me with an overwhelming thirst for the sequel. I can't wait to dive into THE SEA OF MONSTERS, and watch Percy continue his journey.on.

B001TODO54|4.0|my thoughts in a few sentences: I was really in the mood for some hardcore fantasy and Graceling delivered with it's fascinating facets of a world as equally well-defined as the heroine. More, I hadn't expected to enjoy the sexy romance between two characters who become the closest of friends, a sweet relationship that sucked me into the story even more than the rest. Drawn in by Cashore's vivid, imaginative prose as well as her awesome array of characters, I'm looking forward to reading on in the series.<br /><br />full review: I'm a fantasy buff through and through, and I've been receiving recommendations for Graceling since that little fact about myself became known. And I can see why so many bloggers were adamant about my reading the series! It really is one of those perfect fantasy novels that thrusts us into a world very different from our own, but still contains elements that help us relate to it and the people residing in it. It's quite clear that Cashore knows the world of the Seven Kingdoms extremely well, so much so that everything we encounter is as vivid and tangible as the trees or the buildings or the roads outside our door. And the characters are sorted into the pile of high-ranking characters we are most fond of resting in our hearts, until the day we decide to visit them again. While the length may strike us as a bit daunting, it's entirely worth the time it takes to read, because inside Graceling's pages live beautiful characters and a dazzlingly sexy romance that would be a great loss to endure should we refuse to ignore the length of the tale.<br /><br />Katsa has always been deemed a killer, since an unfortunate accident when she was just a child that still haunts her. She views herself as a monster, unable to control her excellent killing ability. Her slow revelation to the contrary is painful and real and beautiful, and its with the help of her newfound friend, Prince Po (SWOON!), that she begins to understand the truth of her personality and her Grace. Prince Po is the confident, charismatic counterpart to Katsa's closed off, tough girl demeanor, yet they complement each other's strengths and weaknesses so well, so naturally. Po is not afraid to rely on her protection and Katsa slowly begins to trust someone outside of those who have become her family. Their deep loyalty to one another, and the romance that blooms along the way, is one of the most staggeringly stunning aspects of the entire novel.<br /><br />Although romance plays an enormous part in loving a novel, so does emotion, and it's slightly harder to connect on an emotional level with Graceling. There's this distance that's difficult to pinpoint--perhaps it's the third person narrative. However, the plot is never short on action, a riveting slew of events that fans our interest in the story and never allows it to fade away. The hardships of their journey are more evocative than the major events, as we visualize an unrelenting Po and Katsa labor to save the world despite the necessary and trying sacrifices involved to bring that outcome to fruition.<br /><br />The final few pages are wrenching in last discoveries and emotion, and even the hardest hearts will melt in sympathy for the extent of the losses of the main characters. However, our worry dissipates when clarity overcomes us and we recognize that those same characters are much stronger than we've given them credit for--which speaks so highly of them, given their bravery and backbone displayed all throughout. It isn't with ease that we say our goodbyes to this astounding cast and this phenomenal story, but we find comfort in the fact that we will meet again.

0307352145|5.0|Great Book, really interesting and well written. I would recommend it to anyone interested in the subject. Also, it was delivered on a timely fashion.
006197806X|5.0|my thoughts in a few sentences: You may have already noticed, but it bears repeating: I couldn't rate this book. I tried, in vain, to think of which one suited best, but they all seemed inadequate. God, how do I even... I'm still IN SHOCK, so consuming and crushing that I don't know what to do with myself. I'd heard countless times that this book is so different from where Oliver first hooked us in Delirium, but I didn't believe the impact would be so astounding. New Lena, tears, death, life, joy, Julian, Alex, and A CLIFFHANGER ENDING THAT IS UNFATHOMABLE. I feel like a sob is going to break out of me at any moment. Requiem, the third book, is like a distant dream, one where my hope is--perhaps foolishly--staked.<br /><br />full review: A forewarning: No amount of reviews will equate to proper preparation for the sheer emotion, as bloody and gaping as any severe wound, and as equally striking, living in Pandemonium. The beauty of this sequel is so horribly, tortuously perfect, as sweetly poignant as letting go of someone important, or watching a younger sibling standing up on his or her own two feet, no longer needing a guiding hand, or leaving behind family to catch one's dreams. Necessary, exhilarating, and painful. Pandemonium is a never-ending punch to the gut, a beating we continue to beg for because it's the only way to keep the story alive and close, to peel away what bars us from the heartwrenching truth. The tears are relief from the intensity, soothing the grief coiled tight inside. And then joy slips in as well, surfacing in fresh love and purpose for our wonderful heroine, but sorrow is never too far behind in tribute to the tragedy that brought us all here, a deadly, flourishing seedling that began in Delirium's end.<br /><br />We remember being sick and angry, hurt swelling in staggering, destructive tsunamis at our core for the shattering final moments of Delirium, so we are rightfully wary of what flavors we'll taste in this next chapter of Lena's life. Will we find sweetness, bitterness, sourness, saltiness or a combination of the lot? Will we be able to bear savoring the journey that brought Lena to the present and the one that helped her escape the past without fighting the urge to toss Pandemonium across the room? Reasonable questions that instigate the darkest thoughts of our minds, projecting images of the horrors that could potentially unfold, though we attempt to ignore the warnings.<br /><br />Alternating between chapters of then and now, we are privy to Lena's rebirth, like watching a snake shedding its old skin, the new skin vulnerable at first, then toughening over time. Even after all her loss and hurt, however, Lena never drifts away, the person she is refusing to flee and leave behind an empty, impenetrable shell incapable of anything light and beautiful. Instead she takes her pain, her anger, her needs and morphs them into the driving force that brings her to where she is today. Pushing away her old life, burying the blockage of dark memories, and shifting into a stronger girl, Lena now embodies what it means to survive--the hard voyage and the end result. The plot never suffers for all the switching to and fro Pandemonium does; it serves as the perfect frustration, wonderful, trying, and inescapable. The story veers and flies and trips, catching on a heartwrenching moment at just the right time, pinwheeling into an emotional freefall and sucking us down with it as it drops.<br /><br />Questions, questions, questions, beating, beating, in our heads, on our hearts, breathing all over every turn of the story. And the romance: revival, a new breath, a desirous need, happiness after wallowing in the forever black of our--ours and Lena's--shared sorrow. We fall in love anew, unable to compare two stories, two souls, two Lenas because they're both so lovely, delivering different feelings, tearing us in jagged bewildered halves. Bleeding, always bleeding, for Lena, for extra characters essential to her life, for the ones in her past that have no place in the now. For devastating choices, heart-numbing deaths, the emotionless herd of civilians that can't care, zombies that don't eat flesh but the love of their children, the untouched youth, the dying and deformed, the incurables.<br /><br />Lauren's words, so fragile and flowing in a hardened world, with heartless people, are throbbing feelings that seep in and find room in our stuffed, close-to-brimming hearts. The importance of this fight for love, for choices and freedom, so profound in the stories of each new person we 'meet,' in relationships just formed. Hearts battered, souls weary, expressions seemingly immune to shock now, hope lifted, we stumble into the ending and shock once again takes us, punches us, pushes us to our knees, because the unthinkable drains us of thought, breath, and heartbeats.<br /><br />Once, Lauren Oliver damaged us in Delirium, not quite destroying, but with those final sentences in Pandemonium, she masterfully wields a dagger of distress and impact, targets what's left of us, and becomes the perfect murderer.r life, for the ones in her past that have no place in the now.

B003O86FMW|4.0|It's a good read, and the same characters/situation as the blockbuster initial novel. I will say it's not quite \\"Hunger Games\\" but that would be difficult to duplicate. If you loved Hunger Games, you'll like Catching Fire.
0312641893|4.0|Cinder is billed as a revitalization of the Cinderella fairy tale, and while it has undertones of a fairy tale retelling, the overarching plot is so much more than that! I don't even know what to dub this one: sci-fi? dystopian? paranormal? It really is a striking, albeit crazy mash-up of things, as if Meyer plucked elements from different genres and rearranged them meticulously into her own unique tale. Cinder, the MC, may be portrayed as the renowned mechanic, with a penchant for breathing new life into the dull, the irreparable. But when I think of Cinder, I envision Meyer with a toolbelt and a mask to resist flames, rebuilding something that has been done before, a retelling of Cinderella like no other, plugging and twisting and tightening the nuts and bolts of a fascinating new thing.<br /><br />Cinder makes an extraordinary Cinderella! At a glance, there are subtle and concrete allusions to the Cinderella tale we all know and love throughout the book, and it's the same with the heroine, but there's so much more to it than meets the eye. On the surface, Cinder has got the Cinderella life, working and submitting to brutal \\"chores\\" for a stepmother who doesn't love, want, or appreciate her, a girl who doesn't classify herself as beautiful and lacks inward confidence that we recognize when she attempts to hide her... eccentricities. But, she's also loyal, hardworking, with the makings of true spunkiness, and, despite her life being in terrible jeopardy in multiple instances, emanates a disarming bravery and strength that endears her to us all the more. In the depths of her thoughts and feelings, there is a girl with hopes for acceptance, but on the outside she gathers to her a formidable illusion of cool confidence.<br /><br />One evil Lunar queen who governs a vicious race, one mad scientist who owns the keys to Cinder's mysterious past, one dashing prince with a desire to do right by his people and growing feelings for Cinder, one death which cuts deep, later and Cinder gives us a riveting story about loneliness, loss, and the will to do what is right despite the life-altering consequences. My only true disappointment with the book is the romance with the prince. I found the slow development to be sweet and full of promise, but I'm holding out for much more in the ensuing sequels. I mean, IT'S THE PRINCE. There has to be a breathstealing romance!<br /><br />With simple, yet elegant writing, entrancing, detailed world-building that draws in even the skeptical reader who repels sci-fi and the like, and a main character that tugs at the heartstrings, Cinder is a one-of-a-kind, gripping debut that is everything it says and infinitely more!

0545265355|5.0|This book was brutal sad funny and surprisingly amazing. When I first saw it I passed it by as something I didn't want to read. But after some persuasion from my friends. I got my mom to buy it. I read it and at first it started out a bit slow but then it totally takes over your mind and you love it. This book is highly recommended and I just now got my mom to buy the second book for me and I'm loving it.
0385534639|5.0|he Night Circus is a truly unique love story; I think it will become one of those classic love stories that will never die and will be told over and over again. This love story is very sweet and magical, and I grew so attached to the story and its characters that I was actually sad when the story ended!<br /><br />This story plays out over the course of several decades and, throughout that time, I almost felt like I was actually sitting in the grandstands, watching the characters grow up and experiencing how the circus evolved over the course of the story.<br /><br />Each chapter switches back and forth between the lives and viewpoints of several key characters and also bounces back and forth between different dates in the past. When I started reading, this was a little hard for me to follow. And because I particularly suck at remembering names, it was a little hard for me to remember whose story I was reading about and to remember when the story was taking place. My suggestion to anyone reading The Night Circus is to pay close attention to each character's name as well as to the time-line of each character's story. If you do this, you should have no problem following this unique love story!<br /><br />Originally, I received an ARC of The Night Circus for review, but whenever I picked it up and started reading, I just had a really hard time getting into the story. In fact, several times I actually fell asleep while reading! But it wasn't the story I was having a hard time with, it was actually the writing style! But even though the writing style was hard for me to follow, I was still very intrigued by the story. So I ended up giving my ARC to a blogger friend and purchasing the audio book instead.<br /><br />The story primarily revolves around two characters, Celia and Marco, who are introduced before the circus begins, and I grew particularly fond of each of these characters and their personal stories. As children, Celia and Marco are bound to each other to compete in a magical duel. They don't know what the duel entails, when it will start or how they can win. But after extensive training, over the course of at least ten years, they learn that Le Cirque des Rêves is the venue for their duel and that their duel has begun. I really loved Celia's temper in her younger age and how she expressed herself through her magic, and I really loved how she later becomes a strong and caring young woman.<br /><br />Pretty much every person involved in the circus gets tangled up in this duel, without them even knowing about the duel or even knowing they are involved in the duel! I grew particularly attached to two twins named Poppit and Widget who were born the very night the circus begins, and they play a huge role at the end of the story. There is one particular moment with Poppit near the end where I felt like a proud parent and I had tears in my eyes. And, as I sit here and think about the story, I can list a bunch of other characters I grew really attached to, but if I talk about all of them, I will bore you to tears!<br /><br />I do have to say that aside from the wonderful characters in The Night Circus, there were several story elements to Le Cirque des Rêves that I truly loved. One of these was this pure genius, totally intricate and awesome clock! And the exact moment when this totally awesome clock is introduced is the exact moment when I became totally entranced by this unique story.<br /><br />I was really happy about how the story ended, but I was also really sad that I had to say goodbye. I felt like the circus had packed up, without warning, and left without me!in a magical duel. They don't know what the duel entails, when it will start or how they can win.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I bought this season 1 dvd set, because even though I'd only caught a couple of episodes while staying at my daughters, I was hooked, and had to see the whole season. I even subscribed to HBO so I could catch Season 2, which was about to start, haha. Love the series! Got a great price on it, too!
006197806X|5.0|This book rocked! I actually liked Pandemonium even better than Delirium, and I think I liked it better because I related more to Lena (the main character) in this book. In Delirium, I had a hard time understanding why Lena was the way she was and was so eagerly willing to get the cure. I understood her reasoning as I got further along into the story, but in Pandemonium I loved how much Lena had changed and how much stronger her character had become, and I was definitely rooting for Team Lena!<br /><br />Throughout Pandemonium, the story moved between the past and present (it's referred as \\"Then\\" and \\"Now\\") in each chapter. The story didn't immediately pick up right from where that worst, most horrifying cliffhanger at the end of Delirium left off...it actually begins in the present (Now) and then it moves to the past (Then), which is the point where the story continues right after Delirium ends.<br /><br />In Pandemonium, Lena gets to experience what the world is really like outside the gates that confine the people, the gates that contain the belief that the cure to deliria is essential and is the only way of life. And boy is it different outside the gates! I don't know if I would have had the strength or power to live like that, but anything would be better than having someone cut into my brain to take away my deliria. And on top of all the heartache from the end of Delirium, Lena is faced with even more heartache and trials throughout Pandemonium. AND, there's a really surprising, deceptive twist that had me totally pissed off!<br /><br />There is a new, lovely romance that transpires in Pandemonium, and it's pretty easy to figure out early on who catches deliria from Lena. This new romance does get a little intense, but I just have to say, \\"I'm still Team Alex 100% all the way!!!\\" But I guess I can come to terms and accept this new boy if I really HAVE to. But for me, if I were Lena and had to be with this new boy, I would only be settling.<br /><br />If you've already read Delirium (or read my review of Delirium *smiles*), then you shouldn't be at all surprised that there is another crazy cliffhanger at the end of Pandemonium. But for me, the cliffhanger was nowhere near as bad as the cliffhanger at the end of Delirium. But the cliffhanger at the end of Pandemonium only has me literally dying for the next book in this series. And now I have to wait a whole freakin' year for it! This is a series that I will for sure be recommending to anyone looking for an amazing Dystopia story with an awesome, heart melting romance.already read Delirium (or read my review of Delirium *smiles*), then you shouldn't be at all surprised that there is another crazy cliffhanger at the end of Pandemonium.

B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I read the books as my kids read it and have to agree that the first one was the most entertaining read and quite a page turner.  It all went downhill from there.  Book 2 was quite a stretch clearly showing that the author was milking the idea from the Book 1 for all it was worth.  Conversations Katniss had with herself throughout the book are just atrocious and sound like she has some mental issues.  My kids barely survived through the second book.  The third book  - I could not help but to wish for Katniss to just die already...  Kids started the book, but gave up may be 80 or so pages into it.  The second and third books are totally not worth it, unless you get them from the local library for free or borrow them on Kindle for free (this applies mostly to Prime members).  If you pay ANYTHING for the last 2 books - you paid too much.

B007MNV5WU|2.0|Yes it's a Fun Game, But There's Only 2 Worlds! I Beat it in Only 6 Hours, Could They Have at Least Made Another World or 2, I Think you Should Wait a Few Months Before you Purchase
0143119680|2.0|I am VERY surprised that I finished this WHOLE audio book in only 24 hours of driving time. BECAUSE, even though it may have taken me 24 hours, it seemed way more like 48 hours, and I'm pretty sure I wasted my precious driving time listening to it! I think I could have spent my time more productively either listening to talk radio, to music or to another audio book or, heck, even by just talking to myself! I spent all of my time listening to this audio book while on a recent road trip from Sacramento, CA to Idaho and back...a whopping 10 hours each way! And guess what? It still took me ANOTHER 2 weeks listening to it every time I jumped in my car! I mean, if I were reading this book, I would not have gotten past the first chapter! And even if I WAS tempted to keep reading because I just wanted to know where the book was going, I just KNOW that I would have skipped through HUGE chunks of the book!<br /><br />I can't say that I actually hated the book, but I also can't say that I really liked it much. The first half of the book dragged on and On and ON...with no progression to the story! There was just way too much detail about Dianna's job in alchemy, and about Dianna going through old manuscripts, and about Dianna talking a lot about history and discussing why she doesn't use her powers. And then there are all these magical creatures that were drawn to her because she was able to break a spell created by this random manuscript that she found, and I felt like even the conversations with all these creatures were drawn out FOR-EV-ER!!!!<br /><br />And then once the story finally started to get good, the majority of the time was still spent talking about WAY too much detail. Do I really care about all the times Dianna becomes tired and falls asleep, and then wakes up? Or every time she becomes hungry or thirsty and what she eats and drinks? Or all the different spices she learns about and how well she identifies them just by smell? I wish I could have known in advance whenever I was about to come across senseless nonsense because then I could have fast forwarded through those parts.<br /><br />Now to the parts I did like! I did like just about every character in this book. I can't say I grew any emotional attachment to them, but they were all very likeable. Then there were the times that Dianna's magic would come out and it was truly amazing and had me fascinated! And then there was the time she was severely tortured by another witch for information about the missing manuscript she found...THAT was crazy intense! And there were even a few times (very few!) that you would have found me with tears streaming down my face. But who WOULDN'T run into SOME type of emotion when they have put SO MANY hours into listening to one audio book? LOL!!! But my favorite part was about the Bishop house! I would totally love to live in a house with that type of magic! The house would create a whole new room every time someone was coming over to visit. It was like the house would tell them that someone was on their way, and that it was OK for them to stay. And missing items would just show up whenever they were needed (pretty handy when you lose your car keys!), and furniture would act up every time it wanted to say something. Those parts were pretty awesome.<br /><br />I think by far the worst part of the book was the ending! I've always said that there are those types of books that seem to be leading up to a SUPER blowout ending, but then that blowout ending never happens. Kind of like in Breaking Dawn; you think it's leading up to a HUGE fight with the Volturi, and then it never happens! Well this is one of those books. But at least with Breaking Dawn, there was a suspenseful face-off with the Volturi. Well this book led to ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! They basically just run for their lives, which leads to the second book.

B000JIHP88|5.0|Perfect for your little one. Love the variety of classical music and rainforest sounds.My son loves it and lays in his crib for hours just watching the mobile move,Plus it is cute.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is simple and relaxing, and yet challenging. Nice graphics and music.. I hope it doesn't end! I definitely a top game.
B004HW7JMO|4.0|With \\"gods of the arena\\", you go back before spartacus was sent to the house of batiatus. There you meet the former champion of the arena, Gannicus. A boasting, womanizer yet on the sand he stands unmatched wielding two swords in the style of dimachaerus. You also see how crixus came in existence with the ludus of batiatus and earned his respect from his fellow brothers as he worked his way up the rungs of competitors. The same level of disgusting betrayal and unforgivable deceit follow all of those who look to further their fortune with the gods. One more monumental sight is seeing the great warrior and man, Oenomaus become the new \\"doctore\\" of the house of batiatus. Great acting, even more ridiculous action and just an all around interesting and exciting look into the ancient powerhouse that was rome. A great buy for the price ;)!!!!!!!!!
B0051CSIKQ|5.0|This is one of those rare vampire movies that takes you to a place and a time. Some of the plot twists might be a bit of a stretch, but the director and writers did a great job of making viewers feel the anxiety and occasional boredom of what it's like to drive country back roads in a world where vampires have taken over big cities. Action addicts may be bored by that, but those looking for a little more to think about in a horror movie will be entertained.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Overall, I think this was a very good book and I would recommend it.  As other reviewers have said, a lot of the information is common sense, but sometimes packaging things in a different way brings a different perspective to them.  That is what this book does.  However, I do agree with some of the other reviewers that it is much longer than it should have been - it could have been about half the length and still got the point across.  I also think that the marketing is a little thick and seems overdone, particularly with alternate editions that are basically identical.<br /><br />I also agree that some of the contents are quite obvious once they are pointed out to you.  As silly as it sounds, it is kind of like a magic trick.  You see the magic trick and have no idea how it is done.  Once you get to see the steps to perform it, it is painfully obvious.  You don't quite understand how you couldn't see it before.  With the ideas presented in this book, they are a little obvious too.  Of course my wife likes quality time.  Of course she likes being affirmed.  Of course she likes gifts.  But, why do we consistently struggle?  Why, no matter how hard I try, does she still complain that she is lonely or doesn't feel loved?  Why can't I figure out how to fix that?<br /><br />Well, if you listen to Chapman, it is because I am not focusing on the right thing.  I may be focusing on physical touch and not giving enough affirmation.  Or, maybe I tell her all the time how pretty she is or how I appreciate this or that, but she really wants me to spend more time sitting down and talking with her.<br /><br />The point of this book is not to explain complex psychological principles.  It is not to give deep insight into human behavior or scriptural concepts.  It is to make us stop and think about a relatively obvious concept that most of us miss or do not give enough attention to.  What would it do for your relationships if the people you care about focus on communicating with you in ways that make you feel loved?  What if you were able to do that with them?in ways that make you feel loved?  What if you were able to do that with them?
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a fun and relaxing game. at times it is challenging but not too bad.  fun fun fun fun
B007PTJOV0|5.0|just the type of game I like! now can play it on my kindle.  very similar to classic Mario Bros...  instant favorite!
055357342X|1.0|I started reading Game of Thrones on vacation. Book 1 was a good pot-boiler story - lots of pretentious writing, bodice ripping and gore. The overall plot moves at a very slow pace but there are lots of side stories and episodes t oenjoy along the way. Starting on book 2 we got more of the same.<br /><br />It took me til book three to realize this is not a novel, it is a soap opera on paper. It's just one story after another of screwing, getting screwed and finding new and grisly ways to kill off characters. About a third of a way through book three I gave up. If you want a soap opera with swords and magic, then this book is for you. But if you're looking for a novel with a coherent setting, an actual plot, and characters you actually can give a crap about, then keep looking.
B006OCM0G0|2.0|I thought it was a great app at first but then I realized that you have to get a bunch of gems to be able to do anything and you have to pay for all of those gems.  if you don't want to spend money like me then there is really nothing you can do after a while.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I really enjoy this app.  finding directions is a little hard.  To delete a recording simply hold you finger on it and it will show you your options, it took a while to find out how to do that. well worth the cost, esp if you enjoy not being spoon fed what the big media companies want you to listen to.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|the energy Sufis but it fun to play. buy it download an get busy fun game enjoy etc love it love it love it loove
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Love this game it has the fun of the old west and the modern appeal of building a society like the Sims.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Angry Birds Space HD is the best version of Angry Birds yet!!! The High Definition graphic brings out the real Angry Bird picture. Killing the evil pigs could not have gotten better untill now. The Space theme really brings out the gangs special talents. Not to mention the new outfits are a classic way to show they are in space. The Angry Birds Space clip of how it began was really rocking! The different levels have all new difficulties. The price seemed a tad high at first but now I see why. Don't t forget to add this cool app to your device.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game was awesome I'm still playing it! I was reluctant to pay for it but worth the price luckily its the free app of the day!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Reading some of the reveiws, I thought that this book was going to suck, big time. Some reveiwers said that this book was juvenile, but I do not understand why. This book is amazing. I loved the plot and all of the characters! Especially the main male lead, Christian. He is tormented by a terrible past and it makes you feel sympathetic toward him. He is extremely hott and possessive. Controlling, easily jealous, and possessive. That may sound like an abusive person, but not at all. Super sweet and caring toward his love, Anastasia. The biggest problem that I had with this book is that Ana had Christian apologzing continuously for things that tormented him! It annoyed me greatly. E L James should have made Ana not so weak. You should most definitely read this book. I could not put it down and I am now reading the third book, which is just as good as the first two.
B0055SWM08|5.0|works best on kindle fire n as you progres to higher levels u must use ur mind to work out the pathways.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a good game I have been playing it since I downloaded it. I agree it is hard to wait for the energy but it plays in the background on my kindle fire so I can take care of other things while it builds energy, all in all I think this is a great game, thanks gameloft :-D

B000NQRE1E|5.0|Since this is the 100th anniversary of the great ship's demise, filmmaker James Cameron decided to sink another $15-$20 into his blockbuster in order to re-release it in 3-D. Is he successful? Well kind of. I still waiver on the whole 3-D idea. I have seen some films where it looks great and gives added depth and dimension to the film and the story (Cameron's own \\"Avatar\\" may be the best example). Often the case however, it becomes a gimmick to make a few extra bucks at the box office, with the outrageous up charge.<br /><br />In the case of \\"Titanic\\" Cameron is very restrained. You won't be dodging chunks of iceberg coming at you, but you will get the feel of torrents of water coming at passengers via nearly abandon passageways. I was a bit distracted by some of the shots, usually where 2 people are talking to each other. In relative close up shots, one person's head was not in 3-D (removed glasses to confirm) but the other, with his/her back to you, was. The shot was often blurry and partially off screen. The best use is when all hell breaks loose on the ship and it begins its imminent doom. Ultimately this wasn't originally shot in 3-D so there have to be compromises. Is it worth the extra $3? For me sure. Here's a review of the film:<br /><br />I'm not sure how many times I've seen this movie, maybe 5 or 6, but it is the fastest 190 minute movie I know. Director, writer and producer James Cameron solidifies his place in film history with this masterpiece. It is a rare film where we know the outcome, so Cameron must give credence to the sinking of the ship itself. It must look real, and it does. The movie lays much of the groundwork early-on when a treasure-hunter (Bill Paxton) is searching the wreckage for an invaluable large diamond necklace. Instead he finds a charcoal sketch of a nude young woman. The news finds its way to television, where centenarian Rose recognizes it. It is her.<br /><br />In a terrific performance, veteran actress Gloria Stuart as elderly Rose narrates much of the film for us and the crew of the treasure hunters. It is here we also become educated on how the Titanic actually sunk. Knowing this early on we are allowed to become invested in the characters and events leading up to and following the iceberg collision. Skillful writing to be sure. In Rose's flashbacks we see a young rapscallion named Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) use his poker playing skills to secure passage on Titanic in its maiden voyage to the U. S. Jack discovers young Rose (Kate Winslett) contemplating jumping overboard rather than marry an obnoxious, rich industrialist (Billy Zane).<br /><br />Rose is being coerced into the marriage as her mother is penniless and only has the family name to bargain with. Rose and Jack, coming from different backgrounds become simpatico in their relationship and eventually brief lovers. Jack, an unschooled artist sketches Rose at her insistence. Bare, but for the necklace, the portrait is put in the safe. The scene is erotic and at the same time innocent.<br /><br />Once the ship hits the iceberg, the action ramps up and Cameron doesn't cheat us. This section is a technological achievement of the first order. Using sets that include miniature and near full size models we sense the impending doom. Various characters in the story become more human with their actions. Some positive, some not, but all believable. Cameron also hired James Horner who provides a memorable musical score and even Celine Dion's overplayed song is perfectly placed over the ending credits. In the end, \\"Titanic\\" is a great love story, brief though it is. We know that as soon as Rose and Jack meet. Winslett and DiCaprio convince us from beginning to end. Their performances catapult them to stardom.<br /><br />9-10-12 UPDATE: Certainly this Blu ray package is consistent with James Cameron's big screen vision in both the 3D version as well as the equally good 2D.  It is in 1080p of course but the original aspect ratio of 2.40:1 is slightly modified to 1.78:1.  The film is split onto 2 discs which certainly helps with video quality.  While the post-production 3D application isn't as good as Cameron's Avatar it is perhaps the best example I've seen with that process.  This is a film that focuses on grandeur and the Blu ray in either dimension looks great.  Likewise the audio is special.  It features a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 that brilliantly displays every squeek, rattle along with the collisions, explosions and screams.  The package includes: 2 new documentaries: Reflections on Titanic & Titanic: The Final Word with James Cameron, 30 Deleted Scenes, 60 Behind-the-scenes Featurettes and a Digital Copy.

A man from Dallas tells about his stock and invites them to a dinner. [Note his accent.] Paula doesn't wear glasses. The conversation tells about their character. [Is their talk funny?]<br /><br />Paula has a dream about getting jewelry. Mr. Handley inspects the model wearing fashions. [This tells about the fashions of that era. Do these fashions seem both outdated and funny?] We see a steam train traveling in a snowy country. They arrive at the lodge. \\"This house?\\" Miss Dempsey complains about the snow. They get music on the radio. Harry James? No. They take her temperature then get help for her. Measles. [No vaccine in those days.] The owner of that apartment returns to search for something. Mrs. Page returns with her date. Jamie asks about the lack of furniture, and tells his age. He is a realist. Paula has a boyfriend who will take her to Atlantic City. Will Miss Dempsey find love in Maine? Poor families do not have wealth to leave to their children. Miss Dempsey learns about timber. The owner of that apartment returns again to retrieve a letter. We see Laguardia airport and a four-engine Constellation airliner.<br /><br />Paula talks to her fellow passenger about wearing glasses. \\"You look better with them on.\\" [She also sees better.] Did Paula take the wrong flight? Did Miss Dempsey also make a mistake? Jamie explains how smart he is in covering his tracks. Is it luckyto be the 50 millionth car over the George Washington bridge? Mrs. Page sells the piano again. Does money always bring happiness? \\"I never want to see you again.\\" Mrs. Page will marry the man from Dallas. Paula married Freddie in Kansas City. There is a snag in the wedding plans. Mrs. Page loves a younger man. They all dine at a small restaurant, then are shocked when J.D. pays with a $1000 bill. They all faint!<br /><br />This movie tells about culture in the early 1950s, as seen by Hollywood. Was it taken from a stage play? The 1930s movie \\"Three Broadway Girls\\" had a similar story about a search for husbands. The references and jokes are no longer funny or relevant. Was the story modified for this movie? You can get hints from an alternate reality when a woman arranges dates for other women. But it all ends in happy matrimony. I wonder what will happen in a few years? The movie \\"Niagara\\" was made around the same time.
B0055SWM08|4.0|It is a very entertaining and relaxing game as well. I keep on playing it all day even during school and after any school activities :)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great time waster! got it. cuz it was free like farmville and such but not bad. that is all thanks
B005IQZB14|5.0|My porous brain doesn't remember many books that I read, in the same way that I don't remember any of the Snickers bars that I've eaten. This book I will remember, probably scene for scene. I will remember specific sentences. I feel privileged to have been given this story to carry with me for the rest of my life. This is art. This is craft. This is an author who knows exactly when and how to end a scene to give it power. This is a damn compelling story that will stand the test of time. All of those words that lose meaning because they are bandied about--like inspirational--that's what this book is. When this book becomes a movie, I won't go see it. The book is too pure, too stunning, too raw, too personal, too immediate (though her trip happened 17 years ago) for me to ever want to see it through someone else's lens. This book is not about a walk through the woods--this is trudging toward wisdom. [I want to know if that's her boot on the cover and I want to know when/how she finally wrote her 5-page overdue paper. Her bio says she has a BA, so we can assume she finally wrote it.]
B0063IH60K|5.0|great app. have been using this app on a regular basis ever since downloading. I like that it gives you a random deal or winning deal, depending on how much of a challenge you're up to.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|This is a fun app to play around with.  Interesting visuals and various settings.  Just eye candy as this is not a game, and not a true gavity simulator.  I recomend you try out Particles in the google market as that has more settings and is a true gravity simulator.  Also recently the author has made several improvements and has at least one more patch in the works as of this date, Apr/10/2012.<br /><br />Gavilux is soothing and interesting to play with.  I just wish there was more to it.  (ps, I got it for free.  I can't say if the price is worth it to you or not as I don't know your budget.  And knowing if it is worth it to me is meaning less unless you know my budget or what other apps I have bought, etc.  And you can't compare as there are no apps exactly like this.  Particles is close, and it is free.)
B0055SWM08|5.0|Simple idea, implemented with beautiful graphics and intuitive game play. The tutorials do a great job of explaining without being annoying.
0736420959|1.0|Thought this book would be cute for my little girl who loves the intro of Disneys Lion King movie. I don't allow her to watch the whole movie because it is too violent - she only watches the intro. However, just like the movie, this book contains images that are not suitable for young children. I really didn't expect such graphic images in a children's book, so this book will not be read to my toddler.
0670023329|5.0|I have read quite a bit about North Korea. This book is unparalleled in its riveting narrative. Blaine Harden skillfully intertwines facts about the Hermit Kingdom and surrounding countries to educate us. Could not put it down and could not sleep. You'll find another similar story: \\"Eyes of the Tailless Animals\\" by Soon Ok Lee and her imprisonment tale and escape. Christians are called the Heaven People and are shot if they look up at all.    What is more insane? The fact that these labor camps are so cruel or the fact that they exist with our full knowledge? Support the underground Christian church in North Korea: [...]  Also, go to [...] Then go to VOM books and type in North Korea under the search bar for some more amazing resources to educate all age groups about the realities of the Hermit Kingdom. Send a copy of \\"Escape from Camp 14\\" to your congressman or congresswoman today!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Soothing music and gentle backgrounds give this game a very calming effect.  Great for unwinding at the end of the day.  The only thing it needs is an undo button to undo just the last move made.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a basic solitaire game.  I wish it would stop the game when there r no more moves.  Otherwise it satisfies a solitaire fix.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I highly recommend NOT reading this book unless you are prepared to read the trilogy.<br />Intriguing and at times horrific, I was hooked within a few pages. If you enjoyed 1984 its a must
B007PTJOV0|5.0|&lt;3 finally a gnarly game. if you dig Mario bros you'll dig this. nuff said. play it. love it. looking for words to let me submit
B0055SWM08|5.0|I just started playing this game and I am already hooked! It's easy to learn how to play and the graphics are not to hard on the eyes. Very good game :)
B0067Q42BY|4.0|I enjoyed the game and the graphics.  Not to tough of a game just enough to make it interesting.  I love the Gold Tiles.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|plenty of games to play..after you unlock them.  some are pretty tough to beat and get aggravating,  but there are many others to choose from.

B006MQRLSA|1.0|I downloaded this movie to see on a plane.  I was never able to get it to play.  It appeared that the movie kept looking to download from the Cloud when I had specifically downloaded it to the Kindle device.  I had this happen to another movie later in the trip.  I thought that I could have made a mistake downloading but was able to download a different movie without a problem at an earlier time.  Anyone else have difficulty with downloading movies to the Kindle?
B0078X2LKY|5.0|This is my granddaughter's favorite book. For me it is fun to read in  Grover's voice and and for her turning the pages even though we've read it many times the anticipation is great. Loved by all ages.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Smooth animations and excellent design. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the game has a lot more levels than your average game. I would highly recommend this game for anybody looking for another polished time killer...<br /><br />I took away one star as I, like other reviewers, don't like constantly being asked to rate an app or pimp their facebook page. I know this is simply a way of self-promotion but it gets a little excessive.

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Shame on you Russia and China for your primary enabling of this brutal regime. Shame on the USA and all other countries for being naive enough to believe free aid actually helps the helpless N Korean people. Shame on you the whole world for allowing this degenerate slavery based country to exist. I am so discussed after having read the ordeal of this man that I feel I am very uninformed or very unworldly. Surely the world must have a good reason to allow this barbarian society to survive. Good God!
B0063IH60K|4.0|it is a game that gives u a thinking experience what I like about this game is that<br />it gives u an automatic finish thing
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This 1-5 was excellent  I am glad was able to have all five at one reading.  It would have been very hard not to keep reading about these wonderful characters and their world.  The book can be a page turner, or page toucher(reading on my Kindle touch).  I can't write enough good things about the book and hope the will be sequels.
B0000029GA|5.0|There have been some crazy rap albums over the years, so to name one album above all the others logically seems impossible to do, but with Illmatic, it goes without question that this is the greatest rap album of all time, and deserves recognision as to being one of the best albums ever created. I love E. 1999 (Bone Thugs~n~Harmony), Me Against The World, All Eyez On Me (2Pac), Ready To Die (Biggie), Doggystyle (Snoop Dogg), Lifestylez Ov Da Poor and Dangerous (Big L), The Infamous (Mobb Deep), Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...(Raekwon), Enter The 36 Chambers (Wu-Tang Clan), Blackout! (Method Man & Redman), Marshall Mathers LP (Eminem), No One Can Do It Better (D.O.C.) Eazy-Duz-It (Eazy E) and so many others, but this album is, and always will be the perfect album.<br /><br />Nas, a rapper and beyond talented lyricist from Queensbridge New York released this LP in 1994. A year in which some of the best hip-hop albums were created and released, Nas certaintly picked a hard year to start his career with. When your competition is guys like Pac, Biggie and the guys from the Wu-Tang Clan, you have to step up to get noticed. To cut a long story short, Nas outshined everyone that year with this absolute classic. Every track, every inch of production, each and every lyric and rhyme is on point with no flaws. NY State of Mind, which is the first full-lengh track on the album (the previous track was the intro, entitled The Genesis) is proberly the best rap, hip-hop track of all time. Its grimmy underground beat, created by none other than the great DJ Premier just makes this song great, and then here comes Nas! Oh my god he spits some INSANE lyrics, and the flow is unbelievable. A perfect track to a perfect album. Next we have Life's A Bitch, which features fellow rapper AZ. This is a great track, with the only guest apperance on the album delivering a nice hot verse and a nice hook. Good production.<br /><br />The World Is Yours is the next song. With guest production provided by Pete Rock, this is one of the greater tracks on the album. The hook is simple, but yet catchy and works well around the usual complicated lyrics by Nasty Nas. A masterpeice! Next we have another song which is argubly the best single track in the history of rap. Halftime is a song in which everything works. The beat is very in-your-face and the song, produced by Large Professor has some of Nas's best word plays, which is saying alot. A classic hip-hop track.<br /><br />DJ Premier returns on the production keys with the track Memory Lane. A real smooth track with your typical great beat by Premier. Nas spits a hot third verse in this one. The next song is actually my least favourite on the album, One Love. Nas is great here, but i just couldn't get behind the hook provided by Q-Tip from the hip-hop duo A Tribe Called Quest. Q-Tips production is very consistant, and i'm a fan of his work, but it didn't work here. It's still a good song and everything, but the standard by this point in the album had already been set so high due to the previous tracks that it made this one look very average.<br /><br />Large Professor is up next with the task of producing One Time 4 Your Mind. A job done well, a really nice smooth song to jam too. Represent comes next, with Premiers last apperance on the album. A classic song with a proberly the best hook on the album. Nas delivers hard here with some of his best verses yet. Lastly comes the short but sweet hip-hop head legendary track It Ain't Hard To Tell. This is, easily the best beat ever made! Still DRE has nothing on this. The most old-school 90s track you'll find. Verses 1 and 3 are just MIND-BLOWING! Listen to this and you'll relise how awful the rap game is now.<br /><br />So there you go. 10 tracks with all delivering nicely in one way or another. Buy this!
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I am an adult who avoided the Hunger Games because I just was not interested in YA fiction after my long journey with Harry Potter.  However, with all the hype, and with friends and their kids raving about the books, I broke down and bought and read the trilogy.  I have to say I read the first book in a day.  I couldn't put it down!  The world of Panem, the characters, and the storytelling held my interest and kept me turning the pages.  I didn't feel \\"talked down to\\" or patronized, and I was really impressed.  The second book was not as good, but generally the middle of a trilogy is a bit slower, moving you along and setting things up for the big finale.  I will say that I was a bit disappointed in the whole Quell storyline, because I felt that it was kind of an unoriginal way to fill space... Didn't we just go through all this in the last book?  And the whole rebellion/victors thing was not really well set up.  Still, an OK read, although not the best ever.<br /><br />***Spoilers***<br /><br />And now, Mockingjay...  The biggest failure of a series ever.  Not because it wasn't a happily ever after fairy tale, or even because the characters became one dimensional stereotypes and victims of SC's agenda (The PTSD basket case, the war criminal, the evil government, the brainwashed lunatic, etc), but because it was so poorly written and poorly developed.  How can you tell a first person story when the \\"first person\\" is either unconscious, in a drug-induced haze, in a state of complete mental breakdown, or hiding under a pipe in a closet?  The answer is, you can't.  We get most of the action and plot summarized in one or two sentences from other characters who come in to visit during one of K's many stays in the hospital.<br /><br />The first thing any beginning writing workshop or course teaches is \\"show don't tell\\".  There was too much narrative (and much of that was very boring and irrelevant to the plot) and too little dialogue and action.  Horrible and lazy! Was the author just assuming that YA readers are not sophisticated enough to catch this?  Or was she in a hurry for a Scholastica deadline? (They should have sent that book back for revisions.  Plural.  Shame on them!) Or did she just not care anymore?  The final battle scenes were rushed and confusing, not because war is rushed and confusing, but because the writing was so poor and hard to follow.  Just compare the death of Rue in HG to the death of Prim in MJ, and you can see how little SC cares about this part of the story.  It was so contrived, this author took the easy way out every chance she got and ruined what could have been a great story, no matter what message she wanted to convey.<br /><br />The epilogue was a mess.  Whether or not she ever intended for the love triangle to feature heavily in her story, she should have known by the time she started MJ that it was important to many of her fans, and the way she handled it was basically an insult to her characters and fans alike. Again, horrible and lazy!<br /><br />Many reviewers have said to just skip this book, but I know most people will want to read it just to finish the trilogy. So, I recommend the library or used book stores, or borrow it from someone who already wasted their money on it.  You can use your cash to buy a good book.  SC should have stopped at book one.
B0055SWM08|5.0|it's clever, beautiful, and all around enjoyable. the Game design is solid and the music is great.  a wonderful puzzle game for those who enjoy puzzles
031606792X|5.0|The books were amazing!!! I was in love all over again. It really takes you back to your first love and the feel of a romance only books can give.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was hands down the best triology I have read.  I wanted more after the third book.  It was a big let down when I was through reading them.  I saw the movie and loved the books more.
B005N0PJJO|5.0|This book was a great follow up to the first.  You'll be on the edge of your seat!!  So much happens!!  Loved it!
B001EN71HC|5.0|All three films together and on Blu-Ray in one groovy looking package! Each movie gets a slim case with them movie picture on the front and all are housed in a British-Flag-themed box with Austin Powers on the front and Dr. Evil on the back. The movies look fantastic and all come with their special features, including the commentary by the director and stars. A must have for any fan!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the book, although her story telling started off a bit different in this book.  I wasn't ready for it to end.
B003KUSUG8|4.0|Recovery shows Eminem's latest work. Here is the track listing and what my opinion is. Note: There are no skits, unlike the rest of Eminem's albums.<br />1 - Cold Wind Blows<br />Incredibly vulgar, an Eminem classic. It's a pretty good song, kind of catchy. But it really shows Em returning to his comedic and vulgar roots (even though the Slim Shady persona apparently died).<br />2 - Talkin' 2 Myself<br />Features Kobe singing the chorus. One of the standoff-ish tracks. About Eminem feeling like he is the only person to ever go through his pain, and how he has been \\"talking to himself\\" for the time between Encore and Relapse.<br />3 - On Fire<br />Reminds me of Encore. Funny but serious, a great quality of Eminem. Many fans of the classic Eminem would be displeased.<br />4 - Won't Back Down<br />My personal favorite. P!NK performs the chorus wonderfully plus there's a great guitar riff. Three verses perfected by Eminem.<br />5 - W.T.P.<br />W.T.P. stands for White Trash Party. Belongs in Relapse. Possibly the funniest track next to On Fire. I like it, but it is one of the few songs from the album that failed to chart (the others being Seduction, So Bad, Going Through Changes, You're Never Over and Almost Famous).<br />6 - Seduction<br />Unnoticeable, I never cared for this one.<br />7 - Not Afraid<br />Not Afraid is the lead single, and deserves to be. This is Em's comeback song. With the motivational theme and the creative lyrics, this is Lose Yourself 2010.<br />8 - Going Through Changes<br />Doesn't stand out either. Uses an interpolation of Changes by Black Sabbath.<br />9 - No Love<br />Lil Wayne performs the first verse. Eminem has a great rap in this. Several interpolations of What Is Love? by Haddaway. My favorite single from the album.<br />10 - Space Bound<br />Great song. I love listening to this. Steve McEwan performs the chorus. Surprisingly, this is a love song. Eminem rarely, rarely, o so rarely, sings love songs. And it isn't about Hailie.<br />11 - Cinderella Man<br />A lot like Til I Collapse. I like the motivation in this song, too. Eminem sure likes bragging in this one.<br />12 - 25 To Life<br />The chorus is performed by Liz Rodrigues. Catchy, one of the standoff-ish tracks.<br />13 - So Bad<br />Also doesn't stand out.<br />14 - Almost Famous<br />I love the evil sound of the chorus, also sung by Liz Rodrigues. Eminem warns listeners about fame.<br />15 - Love The Way You Lie<br />Everyone knows Love The Way You Lie. Great song. Rihanna performs the chorus.<br />16 - You're Never Over<br />This song is pretty good. It shows Em SINGING (yes, singing)the chorus. I'm not too sure, but I believe this song is about Proof, the founder of D12 whose death heavily impacted Eminem.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I loved the trilogy you go threw the ride with them in all the books!!  Easy read and the story telling was amazing!  I laughed, cried, had the chills, and couldn't put the book down!!!  You'll fall in love with the characters!!
055338466X|4.0|Good book. It's incredibly short, hardly a novella in length. It's extremely easy to read and very light on the \\"hard\\" stuff, but it gets into heady territory when talking about God and the theories of creationists. The book is basically a credal statement for those who want to prove that God neither exists nor is necessary. Once we learned that the Earth is only one of billions of planets in a universe of countless galaxies, we realized that we humans were not necessarily special: we're not the universe's \\"one and only\\". Now that M-theory is gaining acceptance, the reality of multiple universes is also becoming apparent. This would mean that even our universe is not unique. With multiple universes, the authors argue, there is no need for anything special to have occured to ours, we're just one of many countless universes. The argument is well presented, the book is easy to follow, and the book is recommended.
B003L20IHE|5.0|Charlie St. Cloud was a good movie. I bought it because a friend told me it was a movie \\"You have to see\\". So I bought it and watched it. I agree it is a movie that was worth seeing.
0670022950|4.0|Well researched and thought out almost to a fault. This book is around 700 pages and I could have been persuaded to the degree I was many less.<br /><br />Not sure of the author's true motivation and maybe that level detail was needed. The book was convincing and changed my perspective of the state of man with respect to violence and the trend.<br /><br />In short, we are, in general, getting smarter and less violent. The facts are clear. That doesn't mean we won't blow it all up as technology is bringing more power to the individual. But, when you realize holding someone's feet to the fire was at one time likely quite literal and the movement towards classic liberalism is clearly a reality over the broad strokes I found it odd that I didn't already know this.<br /><br />While Pinkers impressive and detailed argument was illuminating, I think the couple of interviews I have seen of him did mostly the same thing. His main premise is hard to argue with. I do think the book might be more fairly called a history of violence as it spent most of the book there. But clearly he wanted to be thorough and he really was.
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|I have played this constantly for three months. it is one of the most enjoyable shooters I have seen in a long time. I was amazed at the replayability and it seems to have no flaws except a cruel Ai on the hardcore levels. I feel sure you will enjoy it as much as me. it deserves five stars. please support the developers. please developers come out with another excellent game soon!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I had my doubts about all of the 5 stars - but the game is fun with great graphics! Plays well on my kindle fire.

B005CKPQHA|5.0|This is one show that is worth every minute you watch and every rental you rent! Start with season 1, watch at least five episodes and you'll be hooked thru season 4!
B004LWZW8S|2.0|This film was slammed by the critics when it first came out, which is no indication that it may not be likable... but for once I agree with them. This film has little style and no substance.<br /><br />In ancient times, the gods are forbidden from interfering in the affairs of men unless the infamous Titans are released. Zeus (Luke Evans) warns his children against engaging in battle when King Hyperon begins to terrorize the mainland. His intention is to find a mystical bow, and he believes the oracle Phaedra (Freida Pinto) can reveal its whereabouts. But she is always surrounded by companions and no one knows which is the true oracle. When she is captured in the temple, she encounters Theseus (Henry Cavill), about whom she has a vision. A man of distinction but little interest in politics, Theseus and his companions help her escape... and are engaged in an epic war between the gods and the Titans.<br /><br />Five minutes into this movie I thought it was terrible. The thing is, some movies start out bad and then get better. This one never did. It is an emotionless, passion-less project with one-dimensional characters. There are some pretty costumes but nothing much to look at, and the entire film was shot in such dark interiors that if you don't watch it in a pitch black room, you won't be able to see much of anything -- which is at times a blessing. There are some incredible visual effects here and there, particularly in the last fifteen minutes, but frankly in spite of all the violence, it's boring. When you don't engage with the characters on an emotional level, and you don't care if the love story works, there's no point in investing in the film at all. The acting staggers between decent and terrible.<br /><br />It feels like this was pitched in a hurry, written in a crunch, and then filmed without a capable director at its helm to see when it wasn't working. At least with the atrocious Clash of the Titans, I was entertained. Here, not so much. It had a big budget and clearly most of it went into the special effects. There are some cool moments when Zeus shows up, but overall it's forgettable. Even worse, the last five minutes sets up a potential sequel, which would probably be just as insipid and uninspiring as this one. Please, no. Just... no.<br /><br />Parental concerns: a graphic, shadowy sexual encounter involving nudity, and lots of gore.
B005PV81MS|4.0|Jodie Whittaker plays a nurse who is robbed while walking home by a gang of boys. During the robbery an alien crash lands nearby. Using knives, the gang manages to kill the alien while the victim nurse escapes. The kids carry around the body of the alien not knowing what to do with it. They end up at a flat (Ron's Weed Room) with a stoner who looks like a younger Ozzy (Nick Frost). The boys see more space aliens landing. All agog the gather ceremonial swords, clubs, Roman candles and a dog that looks like Spuds to go hunt aliens...only this time they are bigger and meaner, looking like hairy worgs with several rows of neon teeth that glow in the dark.<br /><br />The boys run for their lives, along with the nurse, trying to avoid aliens, a rival gang, and cops. The aliens have no eyes and hunt by smell, which takes the gang a while to figure out. They are tracking down Moses, the gang leader who killed the first alien.<br /><br />The movie had enough comedy to keep us entertained, while stopping short of being a comedy. There are brief moments of irony and juxtaposition to lets us know the writer and director aren't complete idiots. While the movie makes for a great independent, some of the acting and lines seemed a bit forced. I think a couple of early scenes with a little background on the main characters could have added to the movie and created something to build on, i.e. give us a glimpse of some future saving event.<br /><br />All in all, for those who like quirky sci-fi horror, this one is well worth a view.<br /><br />F-bomb, No sex, no nudity.
0439023521|3.0|I can't believe people are calling this book the next Harry Potter-it is in no way as good, nor as captivating. The premise is interesting, but its execution falls short of all the hype this trilogy has received. I mean, seriously, people, it's not genius! I don't understand why people thought this book was so good.
B0073U2FB2|3.0|An alien vs. earth film that doesn't take place in L. A. Two software developers go to Moscow to present their software only to discover the Russians already have an exact copy. Unfortunately the beginning and their talents don't factor later into the film. They meet a couple of other Americans at a nightclub and when it looks like they are going to score aliens attack the planet (story of my life).<br /><br />These are not ordinary aliens. They are mostly invisible and like Predator seem to hunt by infrared. They kill humans and barking dogs using some kind of microwave beam that causes living things to explode (the cool part). Our focus group of 5 young adults hide in a large storage closet that has food.<br /><br />Now what? Do you A) stay put until all the food is gone, then maybe venture out to get more food, hoping that the aliens have killed enough humans. And if captured all they would want to do is probe you?<br /><br />or B) Try to find the US embassy so they can get you back home. Personally I would go with \\"A\\" because I know for a fact the US embassy does not have contingency plans for an alien invasion. Perhaps they need to advertise that more.<br /><br />** mid point Plot SPOILER? but not ending**<br /><br />Our group chose option \\"B\\". Later they discover the aliens can be killed with a \\"Ghost Buster\\" looking weapon and there is a Russian sub in the river awaiting survivors...but not for long. They meet people along the way. They gain a few and lose a few.<br /><br />To be honest I got a bit bored during the alien hide and seek part. There were no monsters to see, so they saved a ton of money on make-up and special effects. I didn't feel much intensity. The acting was okay considering the lack of a script. They needed to add a little humor, maybe a love scene with an \\"exploding\\" ending.<br />Asylum dull.<br /><br />2 f-bombs. No sex, or nudity. Some hip-hop song lyrics were suggestive.

B006ZEDZNY|5.0|Johnny Depp plays Paul Kemp, a New Yorker hired to work at a newspaper in San Juan (1960). The paper is going down hill. The editor, Richard Jenkins, wants new blood, even though Paul appears to be everything he doesn't want in an employee. There is unrest outside, but no one at the newspaper knows what is going on. The humor is fast and witty. The man Paul is replacing was \\"artistic\\" and \\"raped to death\\" by sailors.<br /><br />Paul Kemp is a Hunter S.Thompson clone. He was hired because the editor likes his style of writing. He is placed in charge of writing horoscopes, something he makes up. He describes the obese Yankee tourists as \\"great whites\\" the most deadly creature known to man. They are afraid to venture outside of their hotel, spending their days bowling, gambling, and duty free shopping. The more you spend, the more you save. His writings tend to be cynical.<br /><br />Aaron Eckhart is a wealthy mobster/businessman, Amber Heard is his free spirited gf who causes everyone grief. Aaron needs a writer (PR man) with new eyes, and Paul sets his bloodshot eyes on Amber, a woman who considers clothes optional. There is also criticism of today's conservatives as Paul remarks about Nixon, \\"Some day some filthy hoar-beast will make him look like a liberal.\\" While watching the Nixon-Kennedy debate, through a pair of binoculars on a neighbors TV, Paul is able to predict a Kennedy victory because \\"I do horoscopes.\\" The humor is off-beat, cynical, and hard hitting like Thompson. A local proclaims, \\"This country was founded on genocide and slavery...then they brought in Jesus like a bar of soap.\\"<br /><br />The movie is also critical of the dummy-down media who kills stories so as to not offend their advertisers. In the film, capitalism is destroying Puerto Rico, creating a war of haves vs. have-nots while Cuba turns to communism. A rich man claims, \\"Liberals are college educated communists with Negro thoughts.\\" To them the problem with the world is the communists. The movie takes a leftist look at the world as it plays out in the microcosm of Puerto Rico.<br /><br />Paul is caught between the two worlds and must make a choice.<br /><br />The movie is not all political. Just as you think Paul has reached bottom, he discovers \\"a drug so powerful that the FBI gives it to communists.\\" NOTE: LSD in liquid form, administered to the eye should be done in split drops with three full drops being way too much, possibly causing hallucinations...or so I've been told.<br /><br />Good acting, good script, funny and very entertaining. Staunch conservatives might be critical of the leftist views contained in this Hollywood film. A must view for Hunter S. Thompson fans.<br /><br />F-bomb, excessive drinking, drug use. Was that Amber topless is a dimly lit love scene?movie takes a leftist look at the world as it plays out in the microcosm of Puerto Rico.<br /><br />Paul is caught between the two worlds and must make a choice.<br /><br />The movie is not all political.

B0060V1WJ6|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised viewing this movie. Expecting it to be completely stupid nonsense, I bought it needing a good laugh. However, I found it a lesson disguised as comedy. The complications of a marriage gone dry; changing ones life after finding love, the crazy things one does when hurt or in love. Its the perfect combination of events that meet in an unexpected way. I laughed a lot and learned a lot. This movie is definitely worth the time.
B0062P3392|3.0|Jason Statham plays Danny, a paid assassin who is partnered with Hunter (De Niro). During an assassination in Mexico, Statham almost kills a young girl. He decides to retire, a decision that lasts to about a minute after the credits when he gets a message De Niro has been taken hostage.<br /><br />Now for the initial strange twists:<br />The sheik who has Hunter held hostage is the same man who hires Danny.<br />Danny must kill British agents in order to get Hunter freed. These are \\"SAS\\" agents who are tougher than Navy SEALS, or so they say in the film.<br />These 3 agents must confess on film to having killed the sheik's son. They are trained to resist torture.<br />And it must look like an accident.<br /><br />One last thing...they only have the identity of one of the agents. Once the first agent is killed, the SAS suspects something is up...<br />A few plot twists, some cliche lines, and the movie is over except this movie got bogged down with twists and bad lines to the point that you can't wait for it to end. Much too long to hold my interest all the way through.<br /><br />This is a typical Stratham type of action. In fact he is wears the same shades. Shooting, chase scenes, roof top jumping, explosions- you know the stuff.<br /><br />F-bomb, minor sex scene, no nudity.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|such a fun game. easy to learn. time killer. cute lil town to set up. similar to the one in the 80s but now with awesome graphics.
0439023491|5.0|I couldn't put the 1st Hunger Games down and then the 2nd was the exact same feeling.  I was amazed it kept my interest and attention since I usually have a hard time staying with books.  Also if you haven't read the 1st, do that.
B00271HTLI|5.0|Obviously the movie can never be as good Rowling's wizardly tome, but it sure is fun to see it come to life.  I highly recommend reading the book with (or without) your kids and follow it up shortly after with this movie.

B005V2S7FW|5.0|LastPass is simply fantastic!  I have literally hundreds of logins for my work and personal use, all with unique and highly complex passwords.  With LastPass, I can use a number of multi-factor authentication methods (Google Authenticator is my favorite) combined with a single password and I have easy access to any of my unique (impossible to remember) passwords.  For only $12 a year you get the premium version which provides access on your mobile devices, I'd pay ten times that for the convenience, security and utility that LastPass provides.

B00005JPUN|4.0|What a great thriller! This film kept me in suspense from the start to the end. The terror and wild fear surrounding a modern society was not that far fetched. As a viewer one can compare the virus to avarice, and the oppression of the uninfected to the oppression of the foreigners and weak in society. The zombies reminded me much about Scandinavian societies, particularly about the people of Copenhagen. They had the same pattern of behavior, it was simply creepy! I believe that this film, however, convey an important message. The fact that we are vulnerable to many dangers as a species was diluted by the paramount message which cries out to stop the destruction within mankind. We, as humankind are the most destructive and pernicious species and it will demand a child like Oliver (a miracle within us) to make us all immune. I believe that such a child can be found in all world societies. Modern societies need therefore to embrace a savior like Oliver, but the sad fact is that such a child is a target in modern societies because modern societies are ruled by the jungle law. The zombies in the film are like people who adapted to the money system. Once they are infected they are doomed to decay but here the death is spiritual. The message therefore is a warning not to adapt to modern societies. The message is to resist the madness of the zombies (conformed people), hence this film is in fact a subversive film against the destruction which comes from the ignorance of the general mass. It was a brilliant film that made me think about the revolutions in each and every world society. The social harmony which the heroine dreams about is not that people will live like trees, but that people will feel like trees and love like trees. The message here is to follow love and intuition, but also to maintain a healthy mind. The danger to fall into the sleep of ignorance can be expressed by the fact that the vast majority of people simply do not give a damn about all the destruction which mankind causes. I was pleased that Oliver survived to save them all. I have found that Oliver in my society and I embraced him and followed his remedy. Have you found the spiritual guide in your society? What a great film.which mankind causes. I was pleased that Oliver survived to save them all. I have found that Oliver in my society and I embraced him and followed his remedy.

B000XUBFE2|4.0|I was very captivated by the story in The Book Thief. It is another visit to the rise of Hitler in Germany around 1933. Lately books on this time in history have been emphasizing events through the eyes of the German people who were not enthralled with what was happening. This is an excellent book for young adults who can learn about this time in history and the dilemmas the German people faced. Books like these illuminate the costs of war to all involved and help us to see how many victims there were.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is an adorable game. I grew up playing mario and this is alot like it but it has its own unique-ness about it.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love this game because it's great fun and a whole new way to play angry birds, but I'm very disappointed that Amazon doesn't buy the upgrade for it.

B006R1T40I|5.0|Five BLAZING Stars! Superb, swinging performances of blues and adult contemporary-pop songs of hope, hurt, faith and love. Bonnie Raitt returns after an absence of over 5 years during which she's had to deal with the loss of her parents, brother, and best friend. She has selected original songs by Bonnie, Randall Bramblett, Al Anderson and others, plus 3 cover songs for her debut on her very own Redwing Records label. The 'best of the best' begins with a jazzy, rocking \\"Used to Rule the World\\" with Bonnie trying to 'get a witness' as she delivers a fiery vocal and bends notes over her slide guitar. A great  cover by Bonnie of Gerry Rafferty's \\"Right Down The Line\\" gets a little reggae influence in the beat that lifts the performance into a new realm. The lament \\"God Only Knows\\", written by Joe Henry, is beautifully sung by Bonnie framed only by Patrick Warren's excellent keyboard support. \\"You Can't Fail Me Now\\" is a gut-wrenchingly beautiful ballad. \\"Split Decision\\" rocks very hard. The Al Anderson & Bonnie Bishop ballad \\"Not Cause I Wanted To\\" is heartfelt, deeply affecting music from both her voice and soulful guitar. And perhaps best of all, the six-minute bluesy cover of Bob Dylan's Million Miles\\" in a low-down walking blues performance that is now the definitive version. And Bonnie also delivers a very poignant version of Dylan's \\"Standing in the Doorway\\" backed by shimmering guitar notes. And the country-influenced \\"Marriage Made in Hollywood\\" just plain sizzles in both message and music. Produced mainly by Bonnie, with four songs produced by Joe Henry, this is a marvelous return to recording for Bonnie Raitt that should gratify old fans and create new ones. Of special note is the scorching guitar work throughout which is spectacular, with special guest Bill Frisell sitting in on the 4 Henry-produced sessions. Kudos to sound engineer Ryan Freeland. Welcome back, Bonnie! Very Highly Recommended. Five ENGAGING Stars!

0374275637|5.0|The book enlightens us on the process of decision making.  It divides decsion making into two types, the first, type 1, is what I call reactionary or intuitive decision making.  It is based upon our associative memory. The second, type 2, is decsion making which requires effort.  The book enlightens us on both and directs us to be aware when we are using the incorrect method of making a decision.  It is useful is sales, management, trading and everyday life.  Great book, it is going on my bookshelf.

0307352145|5.0|Confession: I'm an introvert.  I discovered this during grad school when I had to take a Myers-Briggs Personality Test.  It was like someone pulled back the curtain explaining why I liked to be a homebody and have downtime by myself; it also explained why large gatherings were sometimes overwhelming.<br /><br />Fastforward to now, when I had the opportunity to read and review Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain.  After reading the book synopsis, I jumped at the chance.<br /><br />Cain's premise is that our society is structured for extroverts (a culture of personality), and often introverts get pushed to the side.  This can, and does, result in important contributions sometimes going unnoticed.  Cain set out to explain how introverts can function in this setting, and even thrive.  Along the way, she references multiple studies and anecdotes, some concerning herself and people she knows.  I found this book fascinating, basically reading it over the weekend (after a rough start with the first chapter, which is heavy on background).  Topics include The Myth of Charismatic Leadership (looking at Harvard Business School), When Collaboration Kills Creativity (how group work drowns the benefits of working by yourself), Is Temperament Destiny, Why Did Wall Street Crash and Warren Buffett Prosper, Do All Cultures Have an Extrovert Ideal?, The Communication Gap (really interesting in Introvert/Extrovert relationships), and more.<br /><br />This is a must read for introverts.  It will empower and validate you if you tend to struggle with the typical introvert needs (alone time, feeling lost in a group, work environment, etc.).  It can be a valuable read for extroverts as well, particularly extroverts in leadership positions (your introvert employees can be a strength).<br /><br />I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|This show is amazing and does a great job of following the storyline laid out in the books.  Character choice was also done well.  If you liked the books you will not be disappointed in this DVD series.  Arrived on time and the seller did a great job.

B0076794IO|4.0|I got this books on the daily deal. Not my usual genre but I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />It didn't seem to me to be a typical thriller, it wasn't all action. The tension and suspense is very much character and situation based.<br /><br />It's hard to give a really good review of a book like this without risking spoilers. Suffice to say, it's not your usual spy thriller - don't expect to be whipping through pages feverishly. Instead, it is a slow burn, with some very interesting twists and turns.<br /><br />For me, this was a quiet but compelling read and I was gradually drawn in, wondering exactly how things would pan out and who was deceiving whom about what! There was enough that I figured out and guessed to be satisfying, enough that I didn't work out to be interesting, and although I wouldn't say this was a page turner, nonetheless I felt compelled to keep on reading and to find out what was going on.<br /><br />Four rather than five stars because, firstly, there were just a few corners of the intricate plot which could have been dealt with a little more smoothly, where things worked out a little too conveniently, or just seemed a tad too coincidental. Also, although I really enjoyed it myself, I don't know that the blurb/categorisation really gave the most accurate feel for the book, and it could be disappointing in its focus largely on domesticity impinged on by the wider world of espionage and financial dealings, rather than being some kind of spy novel. Both fairly minor niggles, but taken together they just make this a 4/5 rather than 5/5 read.
B0074EIQUG|5.0|Have never listened to Dr. John before. This CD is just plain amazing. You can clearly hear Dan Auerbachs influence ( does that guy ever do anything bad?) and that is always a sure sign of success. Best CD I've listened to so far this year.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I read this, I knew what would be happening because I saw the movie but I had no idea how much better it was! It was such a good book that it took me about 4 days to read it all. It keeps you hanging on, wanting to find out what is going to happen next. And I know many people say I don't want to read this book because I don't want to support children killing other children but really there's more to it than that. And it all leads but to tention on the society and I think the hunger games will end but its much more that just children fighting to the death.<br /><br />Its such a good book and it was written so good too. I would recomemd this book.

B005974CNA|4.0|Dream Theater- A Dramatic Turn Of Events.<br /><br />The title certainly says it all, this is indeed a dramatic turn of events lacking the magic of Mike Portnoy who I will certainly miss until his hiatus is over(fingers crossed).  However Mike Mangini is a superb drummer and I am enjoying his unique approach.<br /><br />Firstly let me just start by saying I really love Dream Theater(who would have thought) and I really wanted to give this album 5 stars. However I just couldn't.  To me, Black Clouds and Silver Linings was the better album by a quantum leap.<br /><br />While I enjoyed this album I found myself thinking 'Dream Theater have much better albums out there' and it was something of a let down after Black Clouds and Silver linings which to me was like a story of epic proportions(I even grabbed the special edition with the vinyls of that album which is a superb box set worth every cent).  With this album I was a little sceptical and only grabbed the DVD/CD edition, which was worth while but it's not an album I would lay down the vinyl to listen to.<br /><br />Why?  Well like most dream theater fans have already written, yes it has some great pieces and features that Dream Theater style we all know and love and even the new drummer is superb, but it felt like a kind of rehash to me, with not much in the way of ground breaking amazing Dream Theater I have come to experience with each new album.<br /><br />There was one exception that allowed me to give this album 4 stars instead of the 3 I was going to give it and that was the fantastic piece which is track 8. Breaking All Illusions.  That is a PHENOMENAL piece of music.  Absolutely AWESOME in every sense of the word and I was so very happy that if nothing else such a track was on that album.  With the rest of the album I was honestly listening along thinking... 'yeah I like it but ho hum I could leave it be if it was on fire'.  Then like a bolt of lightning this brilliant piece of music just held me spell bound.  I love the timming, the direction, the changes, the flow of that piece and I was VERY happy and glad I bought the album because it was worth it for this piece even without the rest of the album.<br /><br />In short, it pailed/almost failed in comparison to the previous album(Black Clouds and Silver Linings) which to me, just flows along with such great ideas.  Different singing styles from James, new fresh riff ideas and composition from John Petrucci, John Myung seemed to be really pumping out some great bass catches and Jordon was on fire, but most of all, it featured one of my favourite drummers in the world 'Mike Portnoy' at the height of his career having an absolute ball.<br /><br />Never the less, all Dream Theater fans should grab this album to support the band and I feel that once the next album comes around there all going to be on fire again.  I guess this album is fitting in that the band seem almost a touch sad in there music, like there missing Mike Portnoy and in fact it's Mike Mangini's new drum style that gave me the most entertainment on this album, the rest of the band didn't feel like they were as in to it as the previous album.<br /><br />It's worth it just for track 8, in which they all seem to have gelled really well and are playing as one with true Dream Theater inventiveness and passion.  Shame about the rest of the tracks, which are OK and track 7. Far From Heaven forms a nice intro to Track 8.  It was a shame they ended the album on Beneath The Surface as I feel that track 8, the mind blowing mastery that it is would have been the track to end the album on, but that's just me.<br /><br />2 THUMBS WAY UP FOR NEW DRUMMER Mike Mangini.  With out him, I don't think this album would have been the success other fans seem to be finding it and wouldn't have been as enjoyable musically for myself.<br /><br />Keep on going Dream Theater and I look forward to the next album which I'm certain will be see a return to mind blowing(thanks also for thepiece 'Breaking All Illusions').  That's proof alone that Dream Theater are still very much still reaching for new creativity.<br /><br />Sean A. Curtin

Between my wife and I, we tried this out on a half dozen different iphones, ipads, and ipods, and all worked great.  Im a case junkie, so my ipad has 4 or so different cases and between my wife and I we tried maybe a dozen iphone cases.  Every case worked.

0741470314|2.0|I had high hopes for Dr. Moriarty's book \\"Defending A King\\", based on reviews from different MJ fan sites and blogs, an endorsement from Tom Mesereau, and hearing her interview on Blog Talk Radio to promote the book. However, after finally completing this massive 500 page book, I am left with a feeling of immense incompleteness, as there is much to be desired from this well-intentioned but poorly research book. Let me explain:<br /><br />The book started out great, with Dr. Moriarty speaking about her conversations with MJ's bodyguards from Vegas. There is a lot of great information that they gave, and it's a shame that they had a falling out with Dr. Moriarty and did not complete the book with her, as was the original intention. The knowledge that she received from MJ's attorney Tom Mesereau was valuable as well, as Dr. Moriarty gives fans an inside look at what is was like for MJ to experience that tortuous trial.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book falls apart quickly because Dr. Moriarty obviously isn't very knowledgeable about MJ, and she is a very poor researcher. Here are a few examples:<br /><br />On page 226, she inadvertently regurgitates a March 2008 tabloid story written by Stacy Brown, who co-authored the 2004 piece of trash book \\"Man Behind The Mask\\" with MJ's former manager Bob Jones. The article, titled \\"Jacko Clan In A Deep Funk\\", was originally printed in the New York Post, and it purports to be an honest portrayal of the whereabouts and happenings of the Jackson family in 2008. It was reprinted in the \\"Michael Jackson Tribute - Exclusive Collector's Edition\\" book, and this is where Dr. Moriarty copied it almost word for word! The article states that Marlon Jackson was stocking shelves at a supermarket in San Diego, Tito was having to settle for small gigs that paid him several hundred dollars a show, and Randy was doing odd jobs like changing car tires to support himself! For Dr. Moriarty to reprint this garbage is utterly UNCONSCIONABLE! Dr. Moriarty should have tried to verify this information directly from the family so that they could have a chance confirm or deny the story (which they definitely would have denied!), and if she could not do so, then she should not have included this information! Period! If she was even remotely knowledgeable about MJ and the Jackson family, she would have INSTANTLY had recognized this as tabloid garbage! But because it was reprinted in an MJ book, she believed it hook, line, and sinker!<br /><br />In her chapter \\"Michael Jackson's TSUNAMI: The Trial\\", which is a rather incomplete summary of the 2005 trial, Dr. Moriarty doesn't mention AT ALL the testimonies of Blanca and Jason Francia! They were the prosecution's witnesses who testified as \\"Prior Bad Acts\\" witnesses. Blanca was a former Neverland employee who sold a story saying that she saw MJ showering with young boys to Hard Copy for $20k dollars, and her son Jason was pressured by police to say that he had been improperly touched by MJ while playing tickling games. Blanca threatened to file a lawsuit against MJ in late 1994, and MJ reached a settlement of $2.4 million dollars with her to prevent her from filing the lawsuit and further sullying his image, especially with the HIStory album due to be released soon. Jason's testimony was so terrible that some of the jurors actually laughed at him during a court break! Blanca's testimony was obviously unconvincing, as the jury acquitted MJ of all charges, but NONE of their testimony was talked about in this chapter! Dr. Moriarty also did NOT explain how Blanca was able to legally extort the $2.4 million from MJ! (As I just did.) This is a COLOSSAL omission of important evidence that CANNOT be overlooked! Dr. Moriarty also left out a lot of the important aspects of the testimony of the Arvizo family, such as Gavin's lie that MJ told him that he should masturbate or else he'd have to rape a woman (Gavin initially told police that his Grandmother said that). There are so manyother lies that she left out, and it makes you wonder did she even bother to read all of their testimony?<br /><br />I also would have liked to have seen her show how Tom Sneddon completely rearranged the charges and alleged dates of the molestatioins in between the filing of the Initial Complaint in December 2003, and the Grand Jury Indictment in April 2004. If only she had been as detailed about the 2005 trial as she was about the Conrad Murray trial later on in the book!<br /><br />There were numerous small errors that, in their totality, add up validate how sloppily this book is researched. For example, on numerous occasions throughout the book, Dr. Moriarty refers to MJ's 1993 settlement as \\"approximately $20 million dollars\\", when in fact it was $15,331,250 dollars! The settlement documents leaked in 2004, and if Dr. Moriarty had properly researched the settlement, instead of relying solely on inaccurate media reports, she would have known that!<br /><br />On page 86, Dr. Moriarty incorrectly asserts that actor Marlon Brando had a cameo appearance in \\"Smooth Criminal\\", when in fact he appeared in \\"You Rock My World\\"! If you think that's not a big deal, then I guess it also would have been OK if she had said that Ola Ray starred in \\"In The Closet\\", and Naomi Campbell starred in \\"Thriller\\"!!<br /><br />On a several occasions, Dr. Moriarty cites very questionable sources for her facts. For example, she cites Wikipedia, Topix, Radar Online, and TMZ! Once again, anyone even remotely familiar with research skills should know that you should NEVER cite Wikipedia, TMZ, or any other such tabloid sources! How can anyone take you seriously!<br /><br />And she also cites several MJ fansites and blogs, such as michaeljacksonhoaxforum.com (page 228), mjj2005.com (page 267), and mjfanclub.net (numerous pages). It's very unprofessional for an author to cite fan sites and blogs of the celebrity that they are researching, even if the information is true. Instead of citing the actual site or blog, she should have cited the SOURCE DOCUMENTS that she was researching, such as the AEG contract and court transcripts!<br /><br />Now, let me get into all of the information that is MISSING from this book! When you're truly knowledgeable about a subject, you can evaluate the quality of a book by looking for pertinent information that should be included but isn't!<br /><br />Dr. Moriarty did NOT give a complete timeline and summary of the 1993 scandal, which you would think that \\"the definitive\\" book on MJ would include! She didn't mention how Jordan didn't admit to any wrongdoing by MJ until after he was cajoled by Evan after a dental procedure was performed on him, or that Evan didn't go to the police with his allegations, but instead took Jordan to see a psychiatrist so that the psychiatrist could report Jordan's claims, or how Evan hired then fired Gloria Allred after she refused to sue MJ instead of prosecuting him first, or how he sued Sony in 1996 for the right to record a \\"rebuttal album\\" to MJ's HIStory called \\"EVANstory\\", or how Evan was the ghostwriter for the book \\"All That Glitters\\", which was released by his brother Ray in September 2004!<br /><br />Dr. Moriarty briefly mentioned the FBI's files on MJ, which were released in December 2009, but she did NOT mention how Jordan Chandler met with Ron Zonen on September 2004 and threatened legal action against Zonen if he was subpoenaed to testify against MJ, and how Jordan told him that he had \\"done his part\\"! That is one of the most significant pieces of exculpatory evidence that fans have against the Chandlers, yet it's completely missing from the book!<br /><br />On page 487, Dr. Moriarty criticizes J. Randy Taraborrelli's \\"hastily written\\" 2009 rerelease of his book \\"The Magic, The Madness, The Whole Story\\", yet she quoted from this book MULTIPLE times throughout her book! Why is that? Why would she cite a source multiple times and then criticize that same source?<br /><br />There wereother mistakes that I found, but this review is long enough as it is, and you get the point. I give Dr. Moriarty an 5 stars for effort, but a 2 stars for execution! These errors just cannot be swept under the rug, no matter how well intentioned the book is! It would be like me saying that VH1's 2004 movie \\"Man in the Mirror\\" is a good movie because VH1's heart was in the right place! The notion that this book should be assigned to college students who wish to learn about MJ is a joke, because it is poorly researched, devolves into a love letter at times, includes too much \\"copying and pasting\\" from MJ blogs and other books, leaves much to be desired.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there are a lot of positive things to say about this book, and overall I would recommend it to new fans, but for knowledgeable fans such as myself, the book is severely flawed. I know that it may seem that I came down very hard on this book, but it's out of my dedication to MJ that the truth be told about him in an ACCURATE and PROFESSIONAL manner.actual site or blog, she should have cited the SOURCE DOCUMENTS that she was researching, such as the AEG contract and court transcripts!<br /><br />Now, let me get into all of the information that is MISSING from this book!

0061119776|5.0|My wife and I read this book to our daughter almost every day. It's a great book, but I do have one complaint. What is up with the bowl full of mush? Who has a bowl full of mush hanging out on a table in the evening? No one thought to put it away? Not the old lady whispering hush? If this was Good Morning Moon I could see why there would be mush hanging around on a table with a brush, which by the way sort of grosses me out for some reason. Something about a brush full of hair right next to some cold bowl of mush. There's some sort of nasty kinetic energy about that. Like you might eat the mush even though it's cold and has been sitting there all day, and you end up partially swallowing a really long hair that you have to pull out of your throat. I get that mush rhymes with hush, and brush, and all that but please-a little realism if you don't mind. I have never once in my life had a bowl full of mush, next to a brush, on a table in the evening, that no one thought to put away.<br /><br />Except for that one thing, Good Night Moon is a great children's book.
B0055SWM08|5.0|it looks great has excellent atmosphere and is a lot of fun.  Works great on the kindle fire probably in the top 5 free apps of the day ever.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I bought this album being a fan of \\"The Format\\" and I can't believe how good this album is.  Every song is immediately familiar like I've heard it twenty times on the radio before, but I haven't.  Easily destined to become my favorite album of the year, I can't wait to see what this band holds in the future.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game play, stunning graphics, calming, zen-like music and sound.  This is just a great app all-around.  Thank you, Amazon, for the best FAOTD in a good while, and thank you Fallen Tree for a brilliant game app.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|great fun simple, reminds me of Mario. easy controls.  the guy looks  like lucky charms. good for all ages. will keep playing.
B00005N6KG|5.0|these are great for sitting at my desk and for travel, they don't hurt my ears like ear buds do and they are flexible so I don't worry about them breaking in my brief case.  The sound is as good as I need it to, I don't blare my music but I like a little beat and these do great.  I have almost all of my co-workers with a pair in their brief case as well.  Affordable and good quality.  My first pair lasted about 15 years believe it not.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|I like the cover. It does a good job and is very light weight, but I don't like the \\"stand\\". When I use it, it keeps falling over so that most of the time, i forget I even have it.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It's a good game but I wish I understood the scoring system. There aren't any rules about scoring. Also I wish it would just end if there were no more moves.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This app is kinda boring and some of the games make no sense at all, but just for passing time i guess that it's okay! :)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|pretty good game could have more things to do but ok. reccomended but idk what to say bray hi.<br />hwjsjjn jjskn
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is the game I've been looking for. Very relaxing, simple to learn, but tough to master. I'm going to buy the other quell game for sure.
0316098337|5.0|I could not put this book down. I had it finished within a few days and it haunts me even still.  The book is written from the perspective of a 5 year old little boy and in doing so the author brings an entirely new view point and fresh style.  While the topic is dark, and you would expect depressing, it has points which are so light and inspiring it balances itself beautifuly.  It's different than any other book I have ever read and I would highly recommend it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a great game. Really cool art/soundtrack. Totally relaxing puzzler. Would definitely recommend it. I'm loving it so far.
0062119044|5.0|SPOILER ALERT!!!  Do not read if you haven't read the book.<br /><br />This is a harsh, honest book; however, I thought this book was excellent!!!  I read a lot and this book gave me much food for thought.  Any book that does that is a good book indeed.<br /><br />I am puzzled by some of the reviews.  Some say that \\"no one writes letters like that\\".  Well, maybe, maybe not.  But those letters weren't letters, per se.  I viewed them more as a diary or journal.  How can someone say they don't like the prose when it's someone's private thoughts?  Who thinks \\"neatly\\"?<br /><br />Some say the characters were unsympathic, harsh and pompus.  So what?  Being pompus doesn't mean that you deserve a son who is a mass murderer or that you made your son into a mass murderer.  In addition, are all characters in a book supposed to be sympathic?<br /><br />Maybe Eva was harsh, pompus, and unsympathic, but at least she had the ability to see her son for what he was (within reason...murder she never saw coming and she should have after the lye-in-the-eye episode), but Franklin was even worse (his head was totally stuck in the sand).  I think Kevin had some begrudging respect for his mom (or as much respect as he could muster for anyone) for that reason.  And, I believe that Eva had the ability to really look at herself in hindsight and admit all her mistakes and bad qualities - how many of us can say we could honestly do that?  Eva had her role in this but so did Franklin and Kevin.  And, just because Eva is harsh, pompus, and unsympathic doesn't mean she deserves to have bad things happen to her.  Is it so hard to believe that some are just born bad?<br /><br />I bet if people are honest with themselves, there are some out there who don't like their child/children; they won't admit it (how could anyone admit that?), but I bet there are.  And, I have seen too many families time and time and time again where it's obvious there is a favorite child.  But people won't admit that.<br /><br />And, I do agree with the author on her observations of Americans in general.  Maybe the reason why some didn't like this book is that it doesn't end well (\\"...and they all lived happily ever after\\" - only in fairy tales) and we Americans don't like when things don't end well - goes against our belief that it's all about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  You get coffee to go, put it between your legs, drive off, burn yourself...and then sue because the coffee is too hot...that's us.  Something bad happens and we search for blame.  Sometimes bad things just happen and there's no one to blame and there is no answer to \\"why\\".
B0055SWM08|5.0|Amazing game. My daughter and I played this game for hours intill mom called us for dinner. A must game for your collection.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|Just received this yesterday. I am using this to amplify my Thumper 1 helmet speakers I have in my motorcycle helmet. Before I was just plugging the speakers straight into my cellphone. Sound was good and loud enough to hear over traffic. Once I plugged the E6 in I could immediately tell what I had been missing. The bass response was much better, vocals were clear, and mids/high were also clearer. This thing is tiny like the size of a matchbook and about 3/8\\" thick. I velcro it to the back of my cellphone and in my pocket it goes.<br /><br />Charged in less than an hour. Very simply to use and works well. I'll update later on how much time I can get out of it.<br /><br />So I have been using this for a while now. I still have nothing but positive things to say about it. The buttons are small enough that they wont get accidentally pressed but and the same time I can still push them with my motorcycle gloves on.<br /><br />Use time is probably around 5-6 hours. I haven't used it continuously for that long but I used it every day for about an hour total for an entire week before it needed a charge.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|IRON LADY - Starring Meryl Streep & Jim Broadbent - Rated PG-13<br /><br />\\"Watch your character, for it becomes your destiny. What we think we become.\\" A look at the life of Margaret Thatcher, the first and only female Prime Minister of England. This movie covers from her acceptance to Oxford up to present day. Being a huge history buff I was looking forward to this movie. Growing up in the 80's I remember quite a bit about Thatcher and was hoping to see stuff that I knew already and events to help me fill in the gaps of things I didn't. While this is a good movie overall I was very disappointed. The movie pretty much deals with how she handles her husbands death with bits of flashbacks thrown in. It does cover a fair amount of her time as leader but really only covers how she decided to run, trying to get back the Faulking Islands and her resignation. I was surprised there wasn't more Cold War events as well as her dealings with Reagan. I will admit that Meryl Streep was amazing in this movie and did deserve the Oscar, but I am glad the movie wasn't up for best picture. Even for a history buff like me this was a little boring. Overall, a good movie but I was hoping for more events of when she was Prime Minister. I give it a B.

0345803485|5.0|I don't have time to write as much as I would like, but I just started the book 2 nights ago, and I had to MAKE myself put it down so I could get some sleep!  It is quite addicting!  Yes, it is a bit far-fetched (a 21 year old ATTRACTIVE virgin?) but I read books to escape reality, and this one sure is a FUN one to get sucked into!  I will recommend this book to ANYONE looking for an interesting read!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|The strength of this book comes from the information and stories gleaned from the more than 40 interviews the author did with Jobs before his death. In fact, Jobs had repeatedly asked Isaacson to write his biography, and wanted no editorial control of the book at all, which is pretty amazing for a guy that by all accounts was a perfectionist and control freak. (Sorry Steve!) The book tells us everything Jobs wanted known, and the author does a great job of painting an accurate picture of a man who \\"wanted to make a dent in the universe\\" and was also widely regarded as a demanding genius who was at times impossible to work with.<br /><br />This is not just a book that tells you Jobs' resume, or when he invented what. It presents a powerful picture of a fascinating, driven human being whose contributions to modern life will not soon be forgotten. Apparently Jobs was very revealing about his emotional life and his battles with cancer, because those chapters come through very powerfully. How his personality changed as a result of the health challenges towards the end of his life are one of the most fascinating parts of the book.<br /><br />Well written, well researched, well thought out, well worth immersion into its 600 pages.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this a great game to play. however it is time consuming.recommend if you don't mind spending some time on it.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Nice, gentle logic puzzler. Simple at first but with enough difficulty to. make it interesting. I especially. like that the minimum number of moves is shown for each puzzle.
1416562605|2.0|This was yet another Booker Prize winner that left me scratching my head: where was the \\"greatness\\" in this novel? I didn't find it especially well written, certainly not gripping or suspenseful, and not very funny either. The language isn't high-brow or flowery, just run-of-the-mill ordinary. I suppose that I missed some satirical point the writer was trying to make, or some other aspect of genius escaped me. I managed to finish this novel, but not with any joy or admiration.
B007PTJOV0|2.0|Blatant Super Mario Bros. ripoff.  Gameplay on Kindle Fire isn't bad, but this title somehow lacks the charm and replay-ability of the original game it copies.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a great game. runs perfect challenging levels. and very addictive it is very fun and makes you want to keep playing I recommend it to every one that has a kindal fire!!!!
B00007BKVC|5.0|It has been years since I have watched this movie. It was just as good this time as it was when it first came out. I noticed some things that I missed the first time, which made the movie better than ever. I highly recommend \\"Thelma and Louise\\" to everyone, but if one is offended by profanity forget this one.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a vary cool game it has a good plot and it keeps going and doesn't stop I think it is awesome
B0055SWM08|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. It does not feel like a time waster. I feel like I am legitimately accomplishing something.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a good game for free although most of the games are the same but harder versions anyway this game is worth down loading.
B00499QUK2|5.0|This is brilliant! The dialogue is lots of fun, the characters are recognizable, and the updated plots work surprisingly well.

B006R1T40I|5.0|What's going on here? Veteran roots artists have been releasing some of the best music of their careers- B.B. King, Gregg Allman, Dr, John and now Bonnie Raitt have all recorded five star works within the last year or two. Aside from the obvious talents of these artists, there seems to be a common thread at work here: sympathetic producers.<br /><br />Both B.B. and Gregg worked with veteran T-Bone Burnett to create their strongest studio efforts in years, while the good Doctor was produced by the Black Keys' Dan Auerbach for one of the most unusual (and satisfying) recordings in his canon. On \\"Slipstream\\", Bonnie is produced by alt-country artist Joe Henry. He earned serious blues cred with Solomon Burke's \\"Don't Give Up On Me\\" and Betty Lavette's \\"I've Got My Own Hell to Raise\\", among many others.<br /><br />Bonnie and Henry recorded ten songs in his home studio with an excellent group of acoustic musicians: guitarist Greg Leisz and pianist Patrick Warren are joined by the rhythm section of bassist David Piltch and Jay Bellrose, the drummer who played the skins on Gregg Allman's \\"Low Country Blues\\". Four of the songs made the cut on \\"Slipstream\\"- Bob Dylan's \\"Standing In the Doorway\\" and \\"Million Miles\\" are standouts, while Loudon Wainwright III's \\"You Can't Fail Me Know\\" and Henry's \\"God Only Knows\\" are ballads that will stay in your head long after your first listen.<br /><br />Covering Dylan always takes courage, but Bonnie has the ability to take the Bard's songs and make them her own, similar to Mavis Staples or Maria Muldaur. When Dylan sings the second verse from \\"Doorway\\", \\"If I saw you, don't know if I'd kiss you or kill you\\", his dark humor delivery almost makes you laugh. When Bonnie sings the same line, she ever so slightly draws out \\"kill you\\", sounding ominous- very uncharacteristic of Bonnie, and very effective.<br /><br />After being produced by so many greats over the years, including Mitchell Froom (Los Lobos, Emmylou Harris) and Don Was (nearly everyone), and handling her own \\"Souls Alike\\" in 2005, Bonnie learned enough tricks in the chair to self- produce the other eight tracks on the album. Her band has been with her for years: George Marinelli on guitar, \\"Hutch\\" Hutchinson on bass and Ricky Fataar on drums. In place of Jon Cleary, Mike Finnigan supplies the keyboard work to augment the band's sound.<br /><br />A Reggae take on the recently departed Gerry Rafferty's \\"Right Down the Line\\" looks like an odd choice on paper, but this track is a standout on an album with no weak ones. Randall Bramblett's \\"Used To Rule the World\\" is the type of uptempo funky number that showcases Bonnie's slide guitar, and the underrated fretwork of Marinelli. Bonnie is especially effective on the Dylan songs, with accompaniment from jazz guitarist Bill Frisell.<br /><br />Al Anderson of NRBQ fame contributed three songs to this project, and his guitar duel with Bonnie on \\"Split Decision\\" adds to the album's overall jam vibe. Bonnie in particular wanted to go for the rocking sounds that she creates with Marinelli when they perform live.<br /><br />Some have commented that the Henry produced songs are the superior ones on \\"Slipstream\\", but I respectfully disagree. This album is unique because while two producers contribute, the results are equally successful. Bonnie plans on releasing the remaining Henry produced songs from this session at a later date; hopefully she will add some self-produced tracks to that release as well. This is one case where two good cooks have created a great sonic stew.
B0052VUNHC|2.0|I was definitely let down by this book. I bought it because the ratings were so high and I was interested in something different. I read the whole thing in a weekend but what has stayed with me is the concern that girls reading this book will believe in the idea of being \\"the one\\" that can change the bad boy. The relationship in this book between Travis and Abby was what I would consider abusive. He was excessively violent and controlling and I kept expecting that he would turn his violence toward her. The fact that they then get married at the age of 19 and are expected to live happily ever after is ridiculous. I would not EVER want my daughter to be in a relationship like this and would fear for her safety if she was. It really has bothered me that so many people have rated this book so high.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I preordered this for the low price. The blu-ray version was priced cheaper than the dvd version was in stores!
B00656C6KK|5.0|Doris can still sing. In her newest album she brings you back to a happier time with songs that bring a smile to your face and uplift your heart. A must have for any Doris Day fan.
B000VCLGBY|2.0|I love this movie and saw it in the theater when it first came out.  I rented it from Amazon to show it to my kids and was very disappointed that it had been cut from the original.  Some of the best scenes were missing!!  Why?  Still a great movie and my kids liked it, but disappointed that it was missing scenes....
B0071WQ7WU|2.0|I have been a Shinedown fan since \\"Fly From The Inside\\" first appeared on the radio and love every album ever since.  That is until this one.  Don't get me wrong there are a few sparks on this album but overall this sounds very generic for material I would want to hear from Shinedown.  The title of my review speaks for this effort.  Half of the songs are heavy rockers and half are poppy ballads which is the formula for recent Nickelback albums and I was kind of afraid of this with the huge success of \\"Second Chance\\".  The album starts off with the heavy rocker \\"Adrenaline\\" similar to how \\"Devour\\" started The Sound of Madness.  However, while it's a decent track it isn't nearly as good.  \\"Devour\\" was unique and ear-catching at the start with this military-type drums and onto catchy verses with a powerful chorus.  Nothing unique could be said about \\"Adrenaline\\" except that it's an okay uptempo rocker.  Then comes \\"Bully\\".  This song is totally generic for Shinedown.  It sounds like a song that could have been performed by Puddle of Mudd or any other rock band.  As another reviewer stated, I don't care for the little kid vocals in it as well.  \\"Enemies\\" sounds like a Nickelback \\"Burn It To The Ground\\" sound-alike and not the Shinedown I'd come to expect.  \\"Nowhere Kids\\" sounds, and I mean sounds way too similar to \\"Cry For Help\\" from their previous album.  Like I said earlier there are a few sparks to the album.  \\"Amaryllis\\" was one that definitely grew on me as it does have a unique sound.  \\"Unity\\" is actually a good tune even if it leans towards the poppier side.  The last three tracks are good as well with \\"For My Sake\\" being the best on the album.  It kind of brings back a little bit of the Leave A Whisper type melodies.  However, this album overall sounds too generic in sound and that is mainly due to the more uptempo rockers.  Also, some of the ballads sound like they want to get radio play on top 40 mainstream formats.  Half rockers + Half made for pop station ballads = recent Nickelback.  If you're new to Shinedown, sure try this album out if you want.  But if you do that then go and listen to Leave A Whisper and tell me that this album is better than that epic.  I dare you!

B000AJIF4E|5.0|After searching across the vast plains of Amazon I finally settled upon the Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphones. These headphones had good specs and great reviews. My main concern was durability. Now after owning them for a year I can attest to their ruggedness. These headphones have survived being stepped on multiple times, thrown around in a 30 lb bookbag, and my little siblings. From these tests I would give these headphones my coveted seal of approval, if I had one. Anywho, these are the headphones you want. (Im talking to you tony.)
B0063IH60K|4.0|well done version. ads.... dont like ads that show up every game. but a great effort none the less. would like it better if no ads

Cast is filled with some very talented actors and the special effects are great.  I highly recommend this film if you want to have a fun, thrilling ride.
1451683405|1.0|Not much to say.  He's grossly over-simplified a complex issue.  He's got his science and his philosophy wrong, and he ignores most of the developments on this topic of the past 20 or so years.  Like his previous, \\"The Moral Landscape\\" this is pseudo-scientific nonsense.  This book will make you dumber for having read it, although you probably won't realize it if you're unfamiliar with contemporary philosophy or various scientific projects on free will.<br /><br />If you want a well-researched, fair book by scientists on the science of free will, here's a good anthology:<br />:http://www.amazon.com/Are-We-Free-Psychology-Will/dp/0195189639/ref=sr_1_9?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1334024924&sr=1-9<br /><br />If you want a readable survey of what philosophers actually think about this topic, read \\"4 Views on Free Will\\"<br />http://www.amazon.com/Four-Views-Great-Debates-Philosophy/dp/1405134860<br /><br />Finally, for a decisive criticism of the kinds of studies that Harris thinks proves there is no free will, read Alfred Mele's \\"Effective Intentions\\"<br />http://www.amazon.com/Effective-Intentions-Power-Conscious-Will/dp/0199764689/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1334024862&sr=1-1

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I despise these social games where you have to constantly beg people for materials and in game objects while also having to wait for more energy. The mechanics are pretty much identical to the zynga ville games and most everything by digital chocolate. If you like that sort of game then I imagine this will be right up your alley. These few compliments I can afford it: graphics are sharp with better animations than one is accustomed to seeing in the genre. Controls, such as they are, seem to be snappy and responsive. This genre is still unpalatable however. I would recommend you skip it all together.

1935597760|5.0|This book has so much Irish charm and character that it's like a wee trip to the Old Country. The various people who populate this tale are unique and touching.

I cannot recommends it enough!
B007FH9GT2|5.0|The Swedish film was good and nothing has been changed in the drama nor the thriller. It is made more explicit on things Scandinavians practice a lot but do not show, sex and emotions. So the sex scenes are more developed though they remain within Parental Guidance and the emotions are of course essentially present at the end and of course again in the negative way, the disappointment is for Lizbeth, the poor girl who thought she could be loved by a real respectable man on a permanent basis.<br /><br />The film does not bring one iota more on the exploitation of the young people who are made dependent on the state and under guidance, control and even at times more from some kind of bureaucrat who takes advantage of the situation for his own perversions. Be sure if it were a woman the situation would be the same. The bureaucrat always thinks his authority gives him the privilege of exploiting those who are under his or her control.<br /><br />In the same way a family business has become an impossible quagmire because the members of such a family consider that their name gives them the privilege of exploiting the business to their own benefit, to exploit the workers with the same objective, and of course to cover up their worst impulses under the virginity of the power of money. It is true at the same time the Swedish family business that is used as a screen to hide criminal activities is redoubled with the case of another international business, this time not family at all, that is a blanket covering the recycling and laundering of all kinds of drug and criminal money. This extension is quite funny in a way since it will serve the vengeance of the raped and humiliated and exploited dependent girl who gets rich by just hacking a whole set of accounts in the Caiman Islands. No complaint possible since it is criminal money in a tax and financial haven.<br /><br />What's left is the denunciation of the deep hypocrisy of the Swedish society about its past. Sweden was one of the first countries in the western world to introduce eugenic laws against all kinds of people who were a burden to society, more than thirty of forty years before Hitler in Germany and quite in line with what the British author H.G. Wells advocated at the end of the 19th century that will also produce social Darwinism and behaviorism in the USA.<br /><br />Then in the past and still in the present the people who are classified in those categories, Swedish or foreign, are silent preys to the predators who are in the positions where they cannot be asked any question. The police will do its job but without the means they need, nor the will they need, to get to the rock bottom of the problem and the criminals will walk free and proud, respected and even loved in society.<br /><br />That film should make us think and think again and we should keep in mind that politicians are too often doing the same and a prostitution ring can operate in one of the most important hotels of a big city, across from its opera and nothing is done till finally some scandal comes up generally from outside the country or from a marginal complaint and political interests are finally giving the police the power they need to do their job. Everyone knows about it, and first of all the mayor or mayoress of the city but everyone pretends nothing is happening, including the press that is so blind at times.<br /><br />If you don't believe it is possible just go to Lille in France, New York in the USA and presently a city in Shanghai had the same problem with the mayor being demoted;, including from all his national and regional jobs and his wife is in custody under the charge of having killed a British journalist who was too nosy.<br /><br />What is the world coming to? Go see that film and you'll understand just 10% of what it really is.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUof the first countries in the western world to introduce eugenic laws against all kinds of people who were a burden to society, more than thirty of forty years before Hitler in Germany and quite in line with what the British author H.G.

B00466HN6S|4.0|This is a cute and funny Easter-themed movie for young kids. That's about all you need to know about it. The plot is not particularly inventive, nor the writing or characters, but it's solid holiday-themed entertainment. And this is definitely Easter as 'kid holiday' not 'religious holiday', so if you are looking for something that gets into the religious meaning of Easter, it's not here. This movie centers around an Easter Bunny named Hop who wants to be a drummer, and so runs away from Eastertown. As a movie, Hop is to Easter what Rudolph is to Christmas - a non-religious, cute holiday-themed movie about misfits who find their way. Hop and his friends are all animated, while the humans in Los Angeles where he runs to are not. The mix of animation and 'real characters' is about as good as I've seen. Probably will be an annual watch in our house for the next few years...

B004EPZ0AC|5.0|I consider this a solid 4-star kid's entertainment flick. I've given it 5-stars here to counterbalance the fake 200+ 1-star reviews motivated by something else, which is a misuse of the Amazon review system. This film is not as inventive as the original Happy Feet, and reuses many plot points, but it's a lot of fun, and like the first, I really enjoyed the music in this one. My kids, ages 5-8, thought it was a blast, and watched it twice. Like the first film, it's got a nice theme about cherishing your own uniqueness, and it pretty warm-hearted, without violence (although there are some scary parts involving ice movement.)
1451673442|5.0|This book is New. I recieved it in the time frame I was given.I am very happy with my purchase.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|I love playing this game..... I always play games like these........ it passes the time away. I play all day.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|omg I love it. its like Mario for the kindle.  all it needs is a damsel in distress and a big bad boss. lep also needs a brother, but other than that it rocks. get this app, it is so much fun
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Have been playing on my phone for awhile now and couldn't wait until it became free for the Kindle!! LOVE IT!!!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Great quality and well worth the money. A must have if you have or want to have a great movie collection.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|1 of the best games I have downloaded. I recommend ti if u like Mario. I still recommend it if u don't. I didn't like Mario but I love this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! get it&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I like this game a lot. it is free and a lot of fun to play. it reminds me of the nintendo Mario brothers game.
B000FC0V3E|2.0|I was an idiot, I paid full whack for an e-book that's over 80 years old when I could've downloaded it for nothing from pretty much anywhere that supplies classic books . Even if you want to support current writers and pay for your books, think before you get sucked into the Kindle  price - remember, you're not getting something tangible or newly produced, you shouldn't pay the same rate as a new release or a physical book.<br /><br />Apart from this, the book's a challenge but worth the effort; ideally read it in conjunction with A Paris Wife by Paula Mclain
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I think it would be much better if you could save bookmarks easier. you also need to know what you r looking for. other then that awesome! !!!!!!!!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I particularly like the reading plans and all the different Bible versions that are available on and offline. I have only one complaint; the way the app starts when there is no wifi or 4G network available...not graceful at all. Other than that I love it and use it just about every day.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Works beautifully on the Samsung Galaxy S. A great puzzle game with relaxing music. I give it five rain drops out of fiv
B0055SWM08|5.0|Challenging without frustration. Logical progression in difficulty. Smooth operation and graphics. Exactly what people demand from a mobile game. Very nicely done.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Okay, I get the point.  The books are bland and boring to the female readers of which I am one.  so, guess I'll spend my $$$ on more intriguing and sexy novels like Diana Gabaldon's The Outlander series.  That series is the best I've ever read.<br /><br />Thanks reviewers for taking the time to review these books.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|It is a lot like farmville. The part is u have a choose to have friends or be the lone wolf style player. Thank you for this game
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|the game runs smooth on the fire I enjoy playing it. easy to learn fast paced a must have. I also like other games from the same developer

0316098329|2.0|Reading a story from the point of view of a 5 year old takes all of your concentration. I have a two year old and five year old, so perhaps I should not have chosen this particular book, since I read to get away from it all. But it received such rave reviews, I thought I would give it a shot. The premise of the story is quite interesting. I really wanted the book to be better. I just wish it was written differently (without the child-like writing). I think that would have made all the difference.<br />Overall, I just don't think I can recommend this book.
0345803485|5.0|Although these books (and I mean all 3 of them) are filled with typos and grammatical errors, wild horses couldn't keep me from reading all 3 in under a week. Superb! Good job- well done, Ms.James. I look forward to reading more of your work and upcoming movie! Fun, sexy and addictive. Worthy of 5 stars. Enjoy!
B001SN78JO|5.0|This movie is SOOO funny, I love it!!  Simple plot -Jim Carey goes to a self help seminar and then has to say yes to everything.  I love Jim Carey anyway, and he is just hilarious in this movie.  Oh, the hijinks he gets into!  It's non-stop fun, but in a completely non-cheesy way.  And the super funny red-head \\"agent\\" from Flight of the Concords is in it too and plays an equally quirky character.  Also, if you love LA or have ever lived there, this movie is shot in so many great places, like Griffith Park, Spaceland, the Hollywood Bowl - it will make you nostalgic for LA.  I can't believe it's only like $5?  That doesn't even make sense - Oh Amazon how I love you.  I have seen this movie a million times and watch it every time it comes on TV, but for $5 it's a no-brainer, definately a must-buy!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is really fun...... its just like Mario! Great way to pass time!! :-)...... I recommend it! ( if u like Mario) !!
B006VREOOY|3.0|If you're an action movie fan you'll probably enjoy this. The cast alone was enough to get my attention, but the movie had a good plot and plenty of action and drama.

B0055SWM08|5.0|I bought quell reflect from the market place when it was on sale and loved it. So when I saw this as the faotd on amazon I didn't even have to read any reviews I knew I would like it. Makes you think, very simple but beautiful graphics, and nice soothing music in the background. Great game! Wish there were more like it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|amazing is the only word i can think of you can tell that the inspiration for this game cqme from mario but that doesnt take away from the game i feel it adds to it thank you so much for this game :)
B0055SWM08|5.0|very relaxing and soothing music. game is challenging yet fun to play. would recommend for all ages.! like it says a zen feeling.
0374532125|5.0|My Step daughter and her boyfriend have done charity work in Africa.  I'm planning on sending them this book as it is a great outline of the problems created with Foreign Aid and very succinctly explains the evidence and reasons of why it doesn't work.  I first heard this author interviewed on Dennis Prager's program and was inspired to buy the book as the charming author is such an obviously wise and well educated African woman.  she is articulate and knowledgeable in presenting an excellent case of why Aid does the opposite of what it is intended to accomplish in Africa.

0439023513|1.0|I tried to pick just one word to describe Mockingjay, but I could only narrow it down to two:<br /><br />It was POINTLESS, and it was MEANINGLESS.<br /><br />I like the arc of the trilogy in general, except for a few scenes that didn't have a good reason to be there (Prim) and had no place in the story.  I just don't like the way the story was told.  Katniss was out of character, and the story lacked depth, among other things.  The symbolism that was evident in the first two books was missing here.<br /><br />As some examples, Katniss and her team spent a lot of time moving through the capitol toward Snow's mansion, only to have an army get there first.  Nothing was gained from their adventure at all, except to get a few people killed (for no good reason).  Also, she spends a lot of her time wondering if she should kill Peeta or not, instead of deciding if he was worth saving or not and why.  And then, to top it all off, she spends her time alone and wallowing in her own mind during her trial and most of the book.<br /><br />Basically, most of the time the exciting stuff happens without her, instead of her reaching for the courage inside her and using it to shape the outcome of the story, as she did in the previous two books.  She was not the one who influenced the story, it was the other way around.  Whenever events did happen firsthand, they happened very quickly and left me more confused as to what actually happened (Prim again).<br /><br />Although I thought Hunger Games was amazing, and Catching Fire was great, Mockingjay was disappointing at the least and kept me from purchasing the series to enjoy again.  It was a chore to read and left me empty and wondering why I wasted my time.  I still feel drawn to the first two and am considering reading them again, but I won't put myself through the torture of reading Mockingjay ever again.<br /><br />In summary:  I like the direction the book was supposed to go in, I just don't like the way the story got there in Mockingjay.  Not because I only like fluffy happy endings, but because endings ( and journeys ) like this are supposed to have more meaning, more reward for the horrible prices that were paid.  If I wanted sorrow without reward, I would watch the news and not read fiction.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This is definitely the best ap I have for my Kindle Fire.  The free version comes with a couple of games.  The AI is really challenging on the harder settings which means regardless of your skill level if you like chess you will love this ap.
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|Wrecking Ball is a modern day classic by one of the greatest songwriters of all time. Much like The Rising did for the country Wrecking Ball is the album that we need to hear and Bruce Springsteen is the right artist to sing these songs. Bruce has a way of telling us what we need to hear and if you haven't been directly affected by the economic crisis chances are you know someonw who has. In my oppinion at 62 he has recorded his greatest album of all time. This is one of those old fashioned albums that you need to listen to from start to finish because Bruce has a story to tell his audience. Long time E. Street fans willenjoy having studio versions of Wrecking Ball and Land of Hope And Dreams which feature the last recordings by the late Clarence Clemons. Despite what you may have read from the media about this album do yourself a favor and listen to it you will be glad you did.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|very fun game. nice to have a game that doesn't need internet access. very surprised the game is free. is a must have game!
B006H3MIV8|4.0|Chimes of Freedom is like most tribute albums. Some of the interpretations are very good and other versions you will never want to hear again. Because of the missteps on this album I can only give it 4 stars but the great cover versions outweigh the poor ones and make this album one I highly reccomend.
0439023521|5.0|The story slowly pulls you in and then suddenly turns into a roller coaster ride. That being said, you'll hate it if you're impeded by a lack of imagination.
0345803485|4.0|This book definitely has a lot going for it--it's gripping, sexually charged, unpredictable and highly entertaining.  I wasn't as crazy about Christian Grey as many other readers are--he was too young for me, and also, he has copper colored hair, which led me to picture him like Prince Harry, who I do not find hot at all.  Also, I found the female lead, Ana, kind of annoying at times.  Yet in spite of those quibbles, there's still something about this book that makes it very, very hard to put down.  There's something very intoxicating about their relationship that pulls you in and won't let go.  Def. worth checking this out--one of the more entertaining books I've read in a while.

B005CMSDLE|3.0|Wanna waste couple of hours, don't think, enjoy the popcorn and drinks?  Just pop this movie into the DVD player (rent it, don't buy because you're probably never watch it again), sit back and enjoy.  Hey, I said enjoy - it really isn't a bad movie, just don't expect any credibility, plausability, or any other words that denotes need for thinking or analysing.  This is what Hollywood is good at these days, nice looking but signifying nothing.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game reminds me of Mario and I love Mario he is awesome,  I love the little leprecan he is adorable

As usual Gentle Giant fail to disappoint; this is a brilliant album hands down, just like every other Gentle Giant album before it, and even a few after it too.<br /><br />Gentle Giant were consistent as well as talented, creative and eclectic. If you like one of their songs you won't hear another that sounds like it, but you will likely love most of the assorted songs they made. As a rule, the band cover a whole lot of musical ground in each song, more on each album and a great deal across their whole career. You never know where a song will go and how many moods and tones it will cover, but you can be fairly certain that it will be entertaining.<br /><br />Compared to the album which preceded it In A Glass House is different different, a bit more out there, a little more progressive but still innately Gentle Giant. The level of creativity and musicianship on the album is utterly exceptional. Gary Green is in fine form in particular here delivering a great performance and as always Kerry hits it out of the park with ace keyboard and moog throughout. In fact, each member is a simply superb musician and usually all deserve immense praise.<br /><br />One thing that makes In A Glass House stand out in the catalogue is that the album arguably has a much simpler approach to vocals than other Gentle Giant records, but then it also has as complicated if not more complicated music. Luckily that complex music is held tightly together by John Weathers' funky and brilliant drumming, which melts away any apparent chaos or pretensions with a flick of the drumstick, leaving the listener receptive and probably even wanting more.<br /><br />All six of the albums tracks are worth exploring, but highlights include the rocking title track `In A Glass House' and the jaunty `Experience.'<br /><br />For the most part this is a pretty difficult album to criticise if you are into this sort of music in the first place. Admittedly, the production lacks the punch and energy of Octopus or Acquiring The Taste but after about twenty seconds you'll be lost in the performance anyway. It may not be bombastic but at least it is clear, if a little quiet.<br /><br />Overall, this is a very good album from a very good band. If you like prog you should at least try out the band, and if you like the band then this album is pretty essential listening. I highly recommend it, along with most of the band's entire discography.or the most part this is a pretty difficult album to criticise if you are into this sort of music in the first place.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|Having been a fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs' writing since childhood, it was with great trepidation that I approached the news that not just Hollywood, but Disney Hollywood, were finally bringing 'A Princess of Mars', the first book in ERB's 'Barsoom' series, to the big screen.<br /><br />I couldn't be happier with what they achieved.<br /><br />There were certain changes and consolidations made in this movie (no spoilers from me - see the movie, then read the books!), but nothing to stop me from thoroughly enjoying it on the big screen twice (so far).  The acting, writing and execution of this film were all absolutely awe-inspiring, but nothing about this movie was so jaw-dropping as the fact that it completely tanked at the box office.<br /><br />If Disney's marketing department hadn't dropped the ball (as they did with their 1991 overlooked gem, 'The Rocketeer') and left the title as it appears at the end of the film, 'JOHN CARTER OF MARS', it might have made the film more accessible to people who had absolutely no knowledge of this archetypal and iconic science-fantasy legend.  With the exceptions of a few elitist, die-hard ERB purists who carped about every little change, I don't know anyone who's seen JCM and disliked it.  JCM could've been multi-marketed as an adventure, a sci-fantasy, comedic (~not~ a comedy, though), and above all else, a love story, but Disney acted like they didn't know what they had on their hands.  That is truly a shame, because, even putting the books aside, the movie they made is phenomenal and it got lambasted unfairly.<br /><br />So, I implore you to at least watch, if not outright buy, 'JOHN CARTER OF MARS' when it comes out on BRD and DVD.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />And just maybe it'll let Disney know that the rest of the books are still waiting to be given the treatment this movie unfairly was denied.
B000001FW9|5.0|All of Gentle Giant's early works are pretty much flawless and the knowingly titled Acquiring The Taste is no exception. It certainly has its own unique flavour and is quite noticeably different from their debut, but is of course no less magical for that.<br /><br />The 1971 album; which was their second, is perhaps the most blatantly diverse and progressive of the band's early career. It is definitely a \\"grower,\\" so give it a few open-minded listens before making a judgement. If you don't like it on first listen, with repeated spins you may well end up loving it.<br /><br />The diverse and eclectic album first opens with the slow and passionate `Pantagruel's Nativity,' which boasts impressive lead guitar lines and moody keyboards, and covers a lot of ground in its brief duration. `The Black Cat,' for example, is a great soft song with violin and some funky bass guitar. My two personal favourite songs on the record however, are the rocking `Wreck' and `Plain Truth.'<br /><br />`Wreck' is a powerful sea-shanty influenced song with amazing vocals and a catchy bass line, mixing rock and some quieter violin moments. `Plain Truth' also mixes rock and violin but in a different way; in terms of hard rock, the song is the closest the band ever came to sounding like Led Zeppelin or Jimi Hendrix, but features an astounding Wah Wah guitar solo that on closer inspection is actually played on violin. On top of that, the chorus is also phenomenally catchy and will stick in your head for days.<br /><br />The remastered edition is arguably pretty awesome, with great production and packaging; If you are going to buy this excellent classic album then at least you can rest easy in the knowledge that you won't just be getting so hastily slapped together cash in, but rather an edition that some effort and care has gone into.<br /><br />Overall, Acquiring The Taste is a very varied and perhaps slightly challenging album but one that rewards persistence and is worth checking out if you have any interest in the band at all.ve any interest in the band at all.

B005G0YP3M|5.0|Octopus was the fourth full-length studio album by British Progressive Rock band Gentle Giant. It was originally released in late 1972 and has since gone on to become on of the band's signature albums.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is one monster of an album. Perhaps the perfect mixture between out and out prog and pure hard rock. The album is packed full of brilliant tunes that are complex, challenging and far from standard. That being said however, for a Gentle Giant album the songs are shorter and catchier than usual and a few pack a nice rocking punch.<br /><br />This is the perfect album to start your adventure with Gentle Giant. Octopus is a captivating and emotional album, that displays the band's immense creativity and variety in a relatively easy to digest delivery. From the twisting vocal chaos of `Knots,' and the beautiful balladry of `Think Of Me With Kindness,' to the shameless rocking of `A Cry For Everyone,' `River,' and the awesome `Advent of Panurge,' Octopus has something satisfying for fans of all backgrounds.<br /><br />If you're absolutely unfamiliar with the likes of Yes or King Crimson then the music may be strange on first listen but remember that `strange' doesn't mean `bad,' and in this case it means something more along the lines of superb. In summary, perhaps odd to an absolute newcomer but absolutely worth persisting with. This is the sort of album you'll listen to for years!
B003O86FMW|1.0|Shallow characters, illogical jumps.  Didn't bother to supply detail or logic since it's intended to be made into a teeny bopper movie.  The first book was readable and drew me into checking this one out from library,  but this one convinced me I didn't need to bother with the 3rd one.
B0030U1TW0|5.0|This is an absolutely superb, high quality record from British Progressive Rock band Gentle Giant. Originally released 1975; the band's seventh studio album Free Hand fits in nicely with the rest of the catalogue. The record is a favorite for most fans that expertly balances accessibility with complexity and variety.<br /><br />With its soulful singing and rocking choruses, Free Hand has the perfect formula that allow Gentle Giant to deliver the whole package... what enthusiastic new prog fans would call \\"mind-bending craziness\\" juxtaposed with sublime hard rock power.<br /><br />The album contains several highlights including the famous 'On Reflection,' which has some knotted vocals and tuned percussion and could easily be described as a masterpiece of melody and counterpoint, as well as the furiously catchy title-track 'Free Hand,' which is practically worth the price of the disc on its own.<br /><br />Most songs here are 5 minutes long or over; and the album is definitely a \\"grower\\" that becomes better with each repeat listen. When judged against the rest of the band's work it holds up very well and is probably most similar to the band's 'In A Glass House,' and 'Interview' albums stylistically, but also notable for its superior production values.<br /><br />Overall, Free Hand is a very interesting and enjoyable album that really gives off that 'must-have' air. If you like Progressive Rock in general then it is definitely worth picking up a copy, and if you like Gentle Giant themselves then it'd be a shame not to buy this wonderful album. If you like any of their other work then you'll love this as well.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is a pretty good Mario clone. but honestly I am only writing this review to help keep the game free.
B0011NT4FM|5.0|Gentle Giant are an excellent British Progressive Band and Three Friends was their third full-length studio album, which saw a few \\"firsts\\" for the band. Released in 1972, the album was the first to be self produced by the band, was their first concept album and was also both the first and last Gentle Giant album to feature drummer Malcolm Mortimore, who is sometimes regarded as being Gentle Giant's worst drummer.<br /><br />Furthermore, the album is also notable for being released with an almost identical artwork job as their debut, although an original cover was available in certain editions.<br /><br />Regardless on your opinions on the artwork and arguably even drumming, this album is fantastic. The production isn't just as good as on some of their better-produced records like Free Hand or Octopus, but isn't poor enough to warrant a real problem either. What keeps the album afloat in terms of quality is the songwriting; which, while not just as progressive as some of the band's more famous albums, is no less brilliant.<br /><br />The sax-laden `Working All Day' covers ground that the band never covered before, `Peel The Paint' bursts out from quiet beginnings into a furious and energetic Hendrix-esque guitar solo and hard rocking yet soulful closer `Mister Class And Quality/Three Friends' is immensely catchy.<br /><br />The story details three childhood friends grow apart over time and as adults become separated by the social class system. As concept albums go, it's not the most complex story out there but it is succinct, doesn't mess around and is therefore arguably more effective for its brevity.<br /><br />Overall; Musically the whole album is fantastic, with an eclectic mix of prog complexity, hard rock attitude, and occasional contemplative simplicity, this album doesn't disappoint for a single second. It may not be the band's best produced album but it certainly deserves a place in your collection regardless. If you like Gentle Giant but don't yet own a copy of this album then I would whole-heartedly recommend that you check it out, you probably wont regret it.py of this album then I would whole-heartedly recommend that you check it out, you probably wont regret it.

B0058UXHHK|4.0|I have never left a book review, although I read constantly and have found some of my favorite titles from other great reviews and recommendations.  But I've also never felt the need to champion an author like Denise Grover Swank.  She's funny and smart, and her heroine Rose Gardner is a bright and sensitive young woman with a unique gift, who finds that in the worst of situations she lets her inner fire come out.  She's a spunky character that I rooted for from the first pages, and on many levels the book reminded me of my favorite Charlaine Harris books - the first few Sookie Stackhouse and Harper Connelly novels.  Coming from a self-published author, the book really drew me into the mystery and I stayed up much too late getting caught up in Rose's story (although I'm a sucker for a story about a strong Southern woman, there are a lot of us out there).<br /><br />Rose has the potential to be a great female character that could truly carry a series, although the plot itself could use a little more tightening and polish to succeed on all levels.  The mystery was a little predictable and I felt it needed more specifics at the climax. Without spoiling anything, the big reveal didn't feel as planned out as Rose's personal story and seemed like a convenient ending without enough research.  Things that I think a major editor could help work through to make this a really successful start to a series.  It definitely didn't detract from my enjoyment of the book, and it's a fun, enjoyable read at $2.99 and I'll be first in line to download the sequel.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game. I'm glad I don't have to have wifi to play. the only thing that I don't like is that u cant get energy with your coin but have to actually pay.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Since I read this after finishing Child's latest, it felt like a continuance.<br /><br />BIG question: did I miss something??? It never explains why his brother Robert was convicted of treason
B005XOPEOU|3.0|Good \\"background\\" music, but nothing more. There are 2-3 good songs, and so the purchase for $00.50 was definitely worth it...
B0055SWM08|5.0|A truly unique and intuitive game.  Definitely a must for puzzle lovers.  Elegant in design and tranquil in ambience.  Some of the puzzles will require a good amount of thought to finish perfectly.  Easily 5 stars.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Received on time and product is in good condition! Thanks! Only issue was the first disk would not play in my xbox it would only play in my PS3...but no big deal. Works great and I love it!
B000LJ9ZWO|5.0|Awesome shot selection, very well directed and awesome movie. I thought Martin Scorsese started or invented the Glasses reflection shot as in many movies. However this predates the movie I remember seeing it in. There is also a screen shot that is similar in Fear and Loathing. They just don't make Sci-Fi like they used too. Great film I would watch this over Terminator any day!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great variety of games that are kid friendly. wish some of the adds were kid friendly as well but for a free game cant complain.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It's so easy to become distracted by day to day life...Having the reminder setting for study or devotions is a great asset!
B004UPCZOU|5.0|This is the first album that I can honestly say I like every song on. \\"Nobody's Perfect\\", \\"Big White Room\\" and \\"Who You Are\\" are definately my favorites. The words are powerful. I play this album everyday. My co-worker is probably sick of it. I would highly recommend this to everyone.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Challenging, good feedback, positive reinforcement.  It does what a game should do, it keeps you occupied while building a pseudo-skill.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I was a huge fan of Stephen King;s early work, but lost interest somewhere around Children of the Corn.  This was the first one I've picked up in a long time & it was awesome!  This book kept me riveted throughout the entire lengthy novel.  The concept of novel was captivating, the characters were well done.  It was really a great read.  I would highly recommend it!

B007PTJOV0|5.0|great game it is a lot of fun for adults and kids.  Just like other reviews I agree it reminds me of super Mario.
B004T2QZL8|3.0|This is a very fun game and the kids loved it. The game has an option for parental controls, which is great, however when they created a cyborg, the were greated with a message stating \\"Kiss my shiny a$$\\" If only the parental controls would have caught this, it would still be installed.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Other than we want more levels I love the premise of this version. It requires certain levels of physics instead of just dumb luck like the other versions. The music is classy and not near as grating as other versions. I like that the pigs freeze instantly and pop you know they are dead and dont have to worry about them being staying alive under so much wood that anything short of a bull elephant could survive. Overall i love this game and highly recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its just ok. nothing really spectacular to say about it. basic concept with sometimes annoying games. it would be more enjoyable if the unlockable points weren't so necessary.

These 5 toofus that done hang 'cross my granny's old and turkey like neck,  are the finest quality of possums, AS IS THIS VERY GAME I HAVE COME TO REVIEW! (suddenly Will Ferrell as James Lipton) I don't know but this is what happens when character limits are forced upon me. Just let me 5 star it and dip. (Drops mic and walks away)
B0055SWM08|4.0|Awesome game! Really makes you think. On so? even levels one false move and you might as well start over so be careful and mindful.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|very simple for a chess game it is like a cartoon chess game. I thought it was a 3d chess game but it is still a good game
B000002JOH|1.0|First of, it showed up in a paper sleeve. 10.00 dollars for no jewel case, booklet, ect.,and we were shocked that that was even a possibility. Then it is really scratched up,  if you couldnt tell we are increddibly pissed that we cant add Vulger Display to our CD collection, where was the benefit of spending the extra for s&h to get just a disk, pantera or not... We feel cheated
B0054JZC6E|3.0|some of the games are too difficult to be able to earn enough points. they should start out easier then build up to more difficult. not able to unlock more games.

0439023513|4.0|When I first began this book, I had trouble getting on with it. I felt like the plot was slogging along with no perceptible rescue forthcoming. The action, however, picks up again midway through, finally becoming a truly thrilling read by the end.<br /><br />It took finishing the book and reflecting back to realize why the first part was written how it was. It is slow and tedious and at times irritating, perhaps, because we are reading from Katniss's perspective, and this was exactly how she felt at that point. Katniss was stuck in a difficult rut, not seeming to find her way out. When she finally starts to pull herself together and gets moving again, the action picks up. So, think about this: Collins managed to make me feel exactly how Katniss must have felt in those very moments: weary, and desperate for something to happen. But, even so, the first part wore pretty thin after a while, which is the reason for the four stars instead of five.<br /><br />I don't really see where people are getting that there was no character development in this novel. I saw such changes and maturing in all of them, most of all Katniss. I absolutely LOVED the PTSD symptoms she exhibited (i.e., hiding in closets, not eating, lethargy). I loved it because it made her a human being. It made her someone I could relate to. Her first symptoms rose after she lost Peeta. I know if I lost someone I cared so much about, I wouldn't jump up a few hours later ready to fight a war. She's grieving, and it's raw, it's powerful, and it's definitely personal. She has been through the worst possible hell imaginable, and bad things still keep happening to her. She's not superwoman. So, I loved that Collins decided not to take Katniss in the \\"perfect\\" female character direction, a cookie cutter protagonist that we're all sick of seeing.<br /><br />Even more than at the beginning, I loved to see Katniss grieve after Prim's death. I ached with her. Her emotions were my emotions. This is a girl who has lost quite literally everything she has ever loved. Even if we all wondered back and forth if she'd choose Peeta or Gale, none of us ever doubted that she loved her little sister more than anything in the world. That was her little ray of sunlight. When Prim was killed, how could Katniss not be affected? Do you really want a character who has no reaction to the death of the most important person in their life?<br /><br />I'm not entirely sure I loved Peeta's development, with the Capitol making him Katniss's enemy, but I did like to see Peeta try to recover from it. Whereas in Katniss's recovery, she hunts and kills to heal, Peeta decorates cakes with fantastic icing patterns . They're really almost exact opposites. He got a little annoying with the whole, \\"Kill me!\\" thing, but other than that, I didn't really have too many problems with him, and outside of Katniss, he was my favorite character in the other books.<br /><br />I actually liked Gale's development, because, by default, it also develops Katniss. As Gale becomes angrier and angrier with the atrocities of the Capitol, he becomes more and more willing to match their violence in order to stop them. As rage begins to consume Gale, it seems like he's slowly shifting his priorities. Where once Katniss had topped every list, now she was wavering, giving way to destroying the Capitol as his number one priority. And through all this, Katniss watches, not always aware of what she's seeing, but somehow realizing that Gale is not the person she always thought he was--she realizes that the Hunger Games changed her completely, and that the two of them have grown apart.<br /><br />I thought her mother's actions were completely in character. How like the mother Katniss describes in the first book, the one who disappeared and forced Katniss to become an adult at eleven. And we all know, in the end, Peeta's always by her side through everything, through both games, and through the war, and, finally, through the rest of her life.<br /><br />Most of all, what I loved about this book is that it had the potential to be one enormous love triangle, but it wasn't. For the most part, the love stuff was put on the back burner until the very end. Katniss was broken. Her home was broken. Her friends were dying. She became confused about which side is really better. And, finally, she is shipped off to nowhere to be forgotten. Neat, tidy, and kept out of the way. How forlorn. How empty. Which is exactly how Collins made Katniss, and through Katniss, me, feel. These books are about so many different things. Grief, hope, despair, death, life, love, sorrow, pain, agony, rage, defiance, revolution. The list goes on and on.<br /><br />This book is so filled with raw, intense emotion, that you have to stop and take a breather sometimes. I feel like I know Katniss, like she's an old friend now, and I was both excited to finish the book and know the story's end, but sad to say goodbye to my friend. What a farewell, what a friend, and what an excellent series.

B007ONQ42O|4.0|Thanks to everyone who commented on my original review. Now that the explicit version is easily visible, I'm updating this review.    Overall, I love this new album. It's a mix of old-school metal, fun, and a little cheese. Great stuff. Be aware that it is much more \\"girl-focused\\" than the first album, though. What I mean is that on the first album, the majority of the lyrics aren't gender-specific. For the second album that's changed. You get much more of a feeling that Lzzy is speaking as a woman. That's not bad, but IMO it shows that she is really moving ahead of the other band members. \\"Lzzy Hale and her band\\", rather than Halestorm. That I don't like. Also, when seeing Halestorm live I can tell you that both men and women would sing along. I doubt you'll see dudes singing along with \\"Daughters of Darkness\\" and \\"American Boys\\".    Enough observations. On to the song-by-song review. My scale runs good to bad: Pure Win, Awesome, Good, Meh, SKIP SKIP SKIP    Love Bites (so do I) - Awesome  Mz. Hyde - Awesome  I Miss the Misery - Pure Win (best song on the album)  Freak Like Me - Awesome  Beautiful With You - Pure Win  In Your Room - SKIP SKIP SKIP  Break In - Meh  Rock Show - Awesome  Daughters of Darkness - Good  You Call Me a B**** Like It's a Bad Thing - SKIP SKIP SKIP  American Boys - Good  Here's To Us - Pure Win    At the beginning of the album is a very strong block of 5 songs that belong on every metal playlist. The stars are I Miss the Misery, which begs to be played as loud as you can, and Beautiful With You, which is beautiful music-wise and lyrically.    Beautiful With You, In Your Room, and Break In make up a block of ballads sit in the middle of the album. It struck me as weird to have them all grouped like that. Except for Beautiful With You, I find myself jumping right to Rock Show, as In Your Room is TERRIBLE, and Break In is totally forgettable.    The last 5 songs are a solid mix except for the unforgiveable You Call Me a B**** Like It's a Bad Thing. The lyrics suck, the music is all over the place, it's just awful. American Boys is a fun \\"begs-to-be-a-summer-anthem\\" type song, and Here's to Us is the second best song on the album. Put Here's to Us on loop and thank me later.    Overall, 2 clunkers mixed into 12 songs is really good for a modern rock album. It's the only thing I've listened to since I bought it, and recommend it highly.
B000FC2PKG|1.0|I can't figure out why some authors feel they need to climb into the gutter and spew foul words in order to create a story. This author is no exception; in fact she's one of the worst ones I've encountered yet. In my opinion, true writing skill involves writing descriptively so that no crass language is even necessary. So disappointing because this could have been such a great book. I had to stop after the first 12% because I couldn't take it anymore.

0740797719|3.0|I don't think the book lived up to most of the stellar reviews.  It was good but mainly for beginners.  It was very heavy on theory and ideas (some very good ones), but light on practical applications.  I think, too, that demonstrations--a few step by step illustrations--would have been helpful.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" written by John Steinbeck is one of the most telling stories written about the migration of people from Oklahoma and Arkansas during the Great Depression.  Steinbeck is truly one of the great American novelists.  The characters come to life.  The descriptions of the land, the journey and the people far exceeds anything ever written about this time in American History.  The story holds true even today.  This is a must read for everyone.  I read it years ago, the the reread was even better!

0553801473|5.0|Strange things have happened with the reviews of this book.  I've read through 250 reviews, sorted by `most helpful'.  Overall, numbers of 4/5 reviews and 1/2s are almost equal, but the vast majority of the top 250 are 1/2s.  Clearly the 1/2 reviewers - the \\"anti-fans\\" - are more diligent in approving each others' reviews.<br /><br />[And there are odd similarities between many of the anti-fan reviews.  An inability to spell the word \\"too\\" keeps cropping up.  Perhaps it's just a co-incidence that so many fans share a common illiteracy.  Or sockpupptry.]  [Edit added on 12 April: people have commented that this paragraph is offensive.  It wasn't intended (a) to offend anyone, or (b) to imply that people who vote 1/2 are in any way less intelligent or literate than those who vote 4/5.  Rather, it was intended as evidence that there is a group (no doubt a small one) of people using multiple usernames to alter the overall rating.  I apologise to anyone who, contrary to my intentions, was in fact offended.]<br /><br />Be that as it may, the anti-fans are certainly dedicated.  And incandescent with rage.  A common theme is that Sword of Storms should have been the end of the introduction of new characters.  Feast for Crows, Dance with Dragons and any subsequent books should, according to this view, be confined to the outworking of the relationship between the characters already introduced.  No more characters are needed, say the anti-fans, nor do we need to bother to explore any other places on the map.<br /><br />But the hardest to swallow of the anti-fan contentions is that nothing happens in Dance with Dragons.  So let's turn to the book and consider this.<br /><br />First, Daenerys.  She spends the book demonstrating her complete unfitness to rule.  She had already left Astapor and Yunkai in chaos, her attempts to smash slavery and bring peace complete failures.  Now, with time to spend in Meereen, and despite her best intention, she comprehensively fails again.  Theeconomy of Slaver's Bay has been destroyed (not that a slave economy deserves to be preserved), its cities set at war, its people decimated by pestilence and bloodshed.  This is not `nothing hapenning'.<br /><br />Though nothing will persuade the anti-fans - nor, it must be said, many of the more misguided characters in the series - of her lack of ability to rule.  There is no reason at all to expect that Dany could do any better in Westeros (a continent she has barely even visited) than Slaver's Bay, yet she continues to command eternal loyalty.  I predict her fans are in for a disappointment.<br /><br />Then, Jon.  By accepting the wildlings through the Wall he has completely transformed the economy and politics of the North.  The free folk will not accept the feudal structure of the Seven Kingdoms.  The ultimate outcome in Westeros will be very different as a result of their presence.  Suddenly Westeros looks a bit less like medieval England, and a bit more like the New World, with American-style democracy about to take foot.<br /><br />This is Jon's major contribution, and we might have to accept that Martin is going to keep writing about conflicts between people.  I'm not at all convinced there will be any ultimate show-down between dragons and Others.  Yes, the dragons may become controllable if Victorion ever learns to use his Horn of Dragon Control.  More likely, the Horn will prove to be as useless a distraction as Mance Rayner's Horn, and the dragons will turn out to be a once-invincible weapon that can no longer be used, like Greek Fire in our world.  And the Others may remain more potent as an inchoate threat.  Like Saddam's weapons of mass destruction.<br /><br />So Jon has played his part, and I can't regret his death too much.  Though it's pretty clear he managed to warg into Ghost at the end.  The point of the Prologue about Varamyr Sixskins was surely to explain to us just how this would be done.<br /><br />Then there's Tyrion.  I must admit I'm notentirely sure where his character is going.  I read an article about Peter Dinklage recently which reported him as saying he hadn't read the whole series, and just read each script as it came.  I doubt that he's going to like being asked to ride a pig.  But the device of Tyrion being sent on a journey to show us the countryside is hardly new.  He began Game of Thrones by travelling up to the Wall, for little purpose except to show us what it was like.  And his capture by Catelyn Stark and imprisonment by Lisa Arryn - neither of which revealed the cunning and skill in manipulating events for which he is so renowned - seemed to serve little purpose other than show us what they Eyrie was like.  So I struggle to see why the anti-fans are so enraged by a repetition of the device in Dance with Dragons.<br /><br />Perhaps Tyrion doesn't do everything I'd like to see him do in this book.  But hey, if I only wanted to read a book where the characters only did what I wanted them to do, I'd write it myself.<br /><br />The anti-fans are disappointed by Quentyn.  Why?  Again, a lot happens with him in this book.  He completes a story, from Dorne, to take ship at Volantis, to the sell-swords, to die releasing the dragons - a key step in the unfolding disaster in Meereen.  The anti-fans loved Ned Stark's unexpected death in Game of Thrones, and they loved Robb Stark throwing away his life for a stupid marriage triggering the Red Wedding.  So why do they hate Quentyn's death in the interest of freeing the dragons?<br /><br />Yes, Ned was a true and brave man of principle.  Robb was ... well, not quite Ned, and perhaps not very bright to rush into a marriage with the first girl who would sleep with him, but nevertheless a stirring young leader.  Quentyn is even less inspirational.  But I think that's deliberate.  The heroes are declining in quality.<br /><br />At the same time, the villains are increasing in decadence.  Tywin Lannister was cruel, but strong and with some justification that what he did was in the interest of the kingdom.  Whereas Ramsay Bolton is just vile.<br /><br />And these trends match the declining condition of the land, as we saw in Feast for Crows, with formerly fertile fields laid waste and villages damaged and emptied by war.<br /><br />It's a coherent and striking picture of a world in decay.<br /><br />Where is this going?  Must we look to the broken Reek/Theon to save Westeros?  Maybe, though somehow I doubt it.<br /><br />I don't think Dany will be the saviour of the kingdoms.  As I've said above, she simply is not a credible ruler, and the wild folk will be the factor that triggers a groundswell of objection in Westeros to accept a Targaryen - whose words are `Fire and Blood' and whose modus operandi is to burn their enemies to death and never mind the collateral damage - merely because her ancestors once ruled.<br /><br />Aegon is a possibility, but I think he'll crash and burn, like other hopefuls Robb and Quentyn before him.<br /><br />The answer may be a character we've yet to meet, and who is a favourite of the free folk.  Or we may finish with a recapitulation of the Doom of Valyria, and discover that seasons are not the only things that can outlast their welcome in this world - as in the ending of Asimov's `Nightfall', `The long night had come again'.<br /><br />Or  we might have to accept that the book series will never be finished, and instead the TV series will overtake it, departing from the books at some point.  In that case we'll need a conclusion that fits the conventions of American film-making.  This will require a happy ending, with triumph by a strong and good hero.  It can't be Daenerys or any other Targaryen: too feudal, and neither democratic nor meritocratic enough for an American audience.  Dynasties play well in America, but only if they don't go on too long - for example, the Kennedys, or the Bushes or Clintons.  So that means a Baratheon would be perfect.  I would put my money on EdricStorm.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great casual game that will never frustrate or annoy. Love the hint system. Highly recommend for anybody at any age
1400063515|1.0|For Taleb, a Black Swan (a) lies outside the realm of regular expectations, (b) carries an extreme impact, and (c) human nature makes us concoct explanations for its occurrence after the fact, making it explainable and predictable. Taleb gives many examples of events satisfying (a) and (b), and the \\"explainable\\" part of (c). However, he fails to show that the \\"predictable\\" part of (c) is common or ubiquitous. Of course, there are always individuals who have crazy ideas and try to sell them by claiming that they explain and predict high-impact unforeseen events.<br /><br /> For instance, in the case of the US financial crisis of 2007, a major focus of Taleb's, I have read several books that claim to explain and to have predicted the crisis, all coming from what I consider to be unfounded, and politically motivated, models of financial market competition and its regulation by the Securities and Exchange commission. However, this is surely not part of \\"human nature\\" because if you read the economics journals and many other books, the claims of \\"explanation\\" are tentative and muted, and there are no claims of \\"predictability.\\" My own view is that the bursting of the housing bubble was completely predictable, its impact on the series of banking crises is explainable in hindsight, and if we had the information in 2006 that we have now (especially about auditing irregularities and the marketing practices surrounding the selling of subprime mortgages) we might have predicted the possibility of bank failures.<br /><br />Taleb supports the validity of the \\"predictable' part of (c) by providing, at best, anecdotes. But the plural of anecdote, so the saying goes, is not data. I, for one, do not believe that there is a failing of human nature that propels to see predictability in hindsight where predictability prior to the event was absent.<br /><br />\\"It is easy to see,\\" says Taleb, \\"that life is the cumulative effect of a handful of significant shocks....The inability to predict outliers implies the inability to predict the course of history, given the share of these events in the dynamics of events.\\" This is of course quite true, and I know of no one who has ever doubted this. However, Taleb goes on to say \\"But we act as though we are able to predict historical events, or, even worse, as if we are able to change the course of history.\\"  In fact, very few of the serious scholars I have known or known about has claimed the ability to predict the course of history. Moreover, we \\"act as though we are able to change the course of history\\" because we in fact can, through both individual and collective action.<br /><br />Consider for example Taleb's treatment of the terrorist bombing of the World Trade Center in 2002. \\"What did people learn from the 9/11 episode? Did they learn that some events, owing to their dynamics, stand largely outside the realm of the predictable? No. Did they learn the built-in defect of conventional wisdom? No. What did they figure out? They learned precise rules for avoiding Islamic prototerrorists and tall buildings.\\"<br /><br />This is, of course, exactly wrong. The United States and other threatened countries reacted to the 9/11 episode by overthrowing the Taliban in Afghanistan, which had supported the training operations of Al Qaida. The Saudi's attacked and destroyed Al Qaida at home, and the US armed services began long-term planning for counterinsurgency operations around the world. The current regime in the US has mounted a quite successful attack on the international Islamist terrorism network. No one sane person claims to have \\"predicted\\" 9/11, and most involved researchers do not think we have even \\"explained\\" the rise of Islamist terrorism. But there has been strong reaction to parts (a) and (b) of the Black Swan trilogy, contrary to Taleb's argument.<br /><br />Another of Taleb's claims is that social scientists have an incorrect and falsely optimistic model of risk. Almost all social scientists, he claims \\"for over a century, have operated under the false belief that their tools could measure uncertainty. For the applications of the sciences of uncertainty to real-world problems has had ridiculous effects; I have been privileged to see it in finance and economics....This problem is endemic in social matters.\\" I believe that standard financial economics suffers precisely from such an incorrect model, but I do not know of any other important examples in the social sciences. Most important, this is not a failure of economic theory in general, but of a particular branch of economic theory---indeed, one that not even taught in economics departments (although it clearly should be, and will in coming years).<br /><br />Taleb's distorted sense of social science leads him to make absolute absurd claims concerning the value of analytical modeling. For example, I have in my house ...a wall full of books on statistics and the history of statistics, books I never had the fortitude to burn or throw away; though I find them largely useless outside of their academic applications ...I cannot use them in class because I promised myself never to teach trash, even if dying of starvation.\\" This is a completely incorrect assessment of the role of statistics in the social sciences. Statistical reasoning is quite central to all of social theory and the evaluation of evidence for and against particular social science models, including the evaluation of pharmaceuticals, modeling the demographics of disease, testing products for beneficial and harmful effects, and a host of others. Taleb's generalization from the weakness of standard financial economics to the whole of mathematical discipline is quite unwarranted. However, he does not stop there. All of academia is tarred with his brush of hypocrisy and irrelevance. \\"...almost all academic papers,\\" he claims, \\"are made to bore, impress, provide credibility, intimidate even, be presented at meetings, but not to be read except by suckers (or detractors) or, even worse, graduate students.\\" Note that he claims not simply that academic papers \\"bore,\\" but that is what they are made for! And he claims that academic papers \\"are not to be read except by suckers\\"! Taleb's writing is filled with unsubstantiated and improbable statements of this type.<br /><br />To his credit, Taleb offers \\"Ten Principles for a Black Swan Robust Society.\\" Some of them are quite reasonable, and are indeed part of the solution to preventing financial crises in the future, although their relevance to other improbable event scenarios is questionable. Principle 2 says that there should be no \\"socialization of losses\\" and \\"privatization of gains\\", Principle 4 says people in sensitive positions should have the proper incentives to carry out the duties, Principle 6 says that ordinary citizens should have simple and useful financial instruments at their disposal, and \\". Complex financial products need to be banned because nobody understands them, and few are rational enough to know it. We need to protect citizens from themselves, from bankers selling them \\"hedging\\" products, and from gullible regulators who listen to economic theorists.\\" Principle 7 says that Ponzi schemes should be outlawed and Principle 8 says that we must legislate against the tendency of financial institutions becomes overleveraged.<br /><br />Most of Taleb's suggestions are quite reasonable, but they do not depend on the Black Swan syndrome. Most economists would certainly subscribe to Taleb's principles, although a couple are quite difficult to implement, such as Principle 1, which says that. \\"Nothing should ever become too big to fail.\\"<br /><br />I did not like this book at all. Taleb is pompous and arrogant, making wild accusations that cannot possibly be supported by the fact. Moreover, there is nothing new here, although if you have not thought before about the vagaries of history, you might find many eye-opening episodes described here.ims \\"for over a century, have operated under the false belief that their tools could measure uncertainty.

I highly recommend it for those who like those books that are sorta out there was a romance story within the plot. I enjoyed this book so much that I wish I could read this book all over again without knowing the ending.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|\\"Bigger Leaner Stronger\\" by Michael Matthews is a book on weight training, workouts, and nutrition aimed at a male readership. The author aims to have his readers really understand key nutrition and fitness terms and provides this information right at the beginning of the book, which I feel was a good move. Placing the terms up front, instead of at the back where a glossary would normally be found, means that the importance of these items is emphasized. This also ensures that later on in the text, when these key words and phrases are used, the reader has a clear understanding of what is being said, and time is not wasted in re-explaining the information. Thus, the book flows quickly and easily. It helps that the book is well-written and motivating - it couldn't be clearer or more straightforward. The reader is really made to feel that he is getting honest information and no hype. I very much look forward to future titles by Michael Matthews that deal with women and exercise, so that I can put his motivating advice into action.

1451627289|5.0|-<br />This review applies to both the book itself, and the Audible audiobook. What follows is the text from the review I submitted on Audible's web site:<br /><br />** If you could sum up 11-22-63 in three words, what would they be?<br />Only THREE words? Yeah right. I would call it: Masterful. Brilliant. Fascinating. Exciting. Beautiful. Sad. Captivating. Romantic. Disturbing (Only in a couple of places.). I base this assessment on Mr. King's genius as a writer, AND Mr. Wasson's incredible audiobook performance.<br /><br />** What did you like best about this story?<br />To me, the best part was the perfect marriage of Stephen King's writing genius, and Craig Wasson's (literally) virtuoso performance. The combination made it an extremely enjoyable experience for me. I can say that this is one of the best novels I've read in awhile, and absolutely the BEST of Stephen King's novels I have read. I'm not sure I've ever experienced a better audiobook performance in my lifetime.<br /><br />MR. KING: I loved the general concept of the story -- traveling back in time in order to change history by preventing President Kennedy's assassination. A fascinating and very different concept for a Stephen King novel, I think. It's so different from anything of his that I've ever read before, and I wasn't sure how well he would pull it off, but (in typical King style) it was done BRILLIANTLY. OMG!<br /><br />MR. WASSON: I LOVED Mr. Wasson's audiobook performance! He was PERFECT for this novel. I was especially pleased (and surprised) at the quality, nuance, and range of his voice characterizations. (BTW, his Al Templeton voice sounds a lot like Martin Crane on \\"Frasier\\" to me.  I loved it!).  Mr. Wasson does not simply narrate this book like so many others do.  He PERFORMS it for us.  It is SO good!  To each of the characters' voices he adds individual personality and believability.  He adds voice inflections and convincing regional accents, along with emotion, laughter, and chuckles to a character's lines the way a person would in everyday conversation.  I frequently found myself smiling or laughing outloud with him.  He even wept while describing the murder of a child, and again near the end of the book.  It was hard not to cry along with him in those moments.<br /><br />The King/Wasson combination was so effective, that I often forgot that I was reading a novel (along with the audiobook), and found myself totally drawn in and swept along -- like I was watching a movie, or even living the experience along with the characters.  King's work is always great, but Mr. Wasson made this book come ALIVE!<br /><br />** Which scene was your favorite?<br />There were SO many. And I don't want to spoil any of the book for others by describing parts of it here. But there is some VERY graphic and disturbing content in this book, describing the brutal murder of a child -- so be prepared. It was VERY hard to take.<br /><br />** If you were to make a film of this book, what would be the tag line be?<br />Oh goodness. I personally wouldn't make a movie about this book. Books are ALWAYS better than their film counterparts. Always. I'm not sure that anyone could ever do this book real justice -- though I'm certain they will try.<br /><br />** Any additional comments?<br />Sure, there are a few places where the story line gets a bit cliche and cute; but they were very minor and very few, and didn't detract much from the reading experience. Perhaps it was just me. Hardly even worth mentioning.<br /><br />This was one of those books that I BOTH wanted to listen to all in one sitting, AND one that I wanted to last as long as possible. In the end, I disciplined myself to reading only a chapter or so per session, because it was so amazing that I didn't want it to end. When it did, I wept... literally. The book ended SO beautifully, and all the emotions of the entire journey that King & Wasson had taken me on just came spilling out all at once. I was glad to finally know the ending, but I was sad that it had to end. I felt a little like Jake/George -- saying goodbye to old and dear friends. And, like Jake Epping, I feel somehow... changed... by my journey. Thank you Mr. King and Mr. Wasson.<br /><br />I lost my own \\"Sadie Dunhill\\" some years in the past. Now, there are only the memories of the times we shared together.<br /><br />** My recommendation: Get the audiobook from Audible and the book from Amazon, and listen to it WHILE reading along with the novel. Let yourself go... totally immerse yourself in the story and let it carry you away to the \\"Land of Ago.\\" You WILL be blown away...
B004SEUJ82|5.0|Thought provoking fictional holocaust story with a heart-wrenching ending. The movie was adapted very well. Colors, lighting, sceneries blend beautifully and have a nice flow. How could anyone not appreciate this film?!
B005IGDW24|5.0|I watched this movie at the cinema, but this Blu-Ray 3D movie has the same quality and effects. I really enjoyed watching it, great story, great acting of Hank Azaria as Gargamel, and great 3D eye-popping images. Highly recommended
B004SYP5WC|5.0|I absolutely love it. I had been wanting an app like this and then one day it was free. It works great!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have used this app every day for over a month. It has performed for me very well.  Nice job.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I enjoy this peaceful game with simple rules and charming music. It was a great purchase. I'm glad that I bought it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|A simple, addicting, entertaining app. It beats Angry Birds and other apps any day! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !
B0055SWM08|4.0|Not a bad little game to pass the time.  It does get a little repetitive but over all a great Free App of the Day.
B005HSGB6W|5.0|This book is very interesting. It explores an interesting topic and keeps your interest throughout. I would recommend this book to anybody looking for a mind bending experience.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|dffdf hfhgd gfguy gfghh gchjfbv gg<br />this game is aloke with mario.easy to play and entertaining. love it. why don't you give it a try uourself?
B007ONQ42O|5.0|I want to preface this review to warn you this is the EDITED version of this album.<br /><br />I have listened to this album a couple times now, this is awesome.  Lzzy is an amazing singer and her voice definitely shines through like every other album they have out, live or studio.  I highly recommend this album, but if you want the full album, Amazon currently only has this EDITED version for the MP3 version of this album.  I am pretty disappointed with that.  The album is worth five stars, 1 star for AMAZON and only having this version.
B0062P332Y|5.0|I watched this movie on a laptop, not like that's got anything to do with it, other than it wasn't the sort of movie I'd usually watch at home.  I was travelling and had been lent a copy after reading the Feather Men.  It was one of those movies that I felt you would be able to take or leave but no so.  It was so exciting from the get go and not the usual blood and guts 007 exciting that we've become so accustomed to.  It was earth, real. Clive Owen and  Robert De Niro seem to have passed some acting gems over to Jason Statham, who does a great job in this.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this game except for energy problems if that was fixed this game would be almost perfect except for they keep asking you for real money
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its exactly like Mario bros but there's a leperchuan and they're is no brothers anwsome I love it. l reccommed it...!!!!:)! it something u could look forward too when ur board but also something that's fun...!!!!:)
B0055SWM08|5.0|I have been wanting this game since I played the demo on Android Market. I was very excited to find it as the FAotD. This game is good for a relaxing puzzle game. It would be worth paying for even after it's no longer free.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I am so glad I saw this game it is so much fun and when I saw a whole bunch of people gave it 5nstars and add one more because I am going to give it 5 stars.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Great alternative to your favorite old style side scrollers...my favorite game on kindle fire so far. The controls are solid and work every time.
B00000J7A2|5.0|Capt. Beefheart and the Magic Band came out of the mid-60's blues scene in Los Angeles, which was about as cool as one could get at the time.  He (a/k/a Don Van Vliet) grew up with Frank Zappa in the desert north of L.A., which gives one all the insight one needs to understand where he was headed.<br />  He had a regional hit in the southern California area in 1966 with \\"Diddy Wah Diddy\\" a re-make of a Bo Diddley song on which he absolutely threw down one of the best harmonica parts ever, a great begin for his career, and a true blues masterpiece.  Ry Cooder also got his start with the Magic Band, which shows the high level of musicianship to be found.<br />  \\"Safe As Milk\\" was something of a well-kept secret.  I would have bought it on the Captain's name alone, but it must have been very limitedly marketed, as I only found it about 10-15 years later.  Boy, was I happy to have found it!  From \\"Trout Mask Replica\\" onwards, Beefheart and the Magic Band were an art band, and stayed far from the norms of Top 40 radio or even conventional AOR music, and it takes a special dedication and fanship to listen to a lot of their music.  But \\"Safe As Milk\\" is accessible to 99% of the music-listening population, while still retaining a high degree of progressivity and individuality.<br />  Most songs are crafted on a blues foundation, and performed and played excellently.  Doo-wop influences come in, certainly psychedelic influences are there, but at a Top 40 radio (for the time) level, and not excessively. There is very little \\"routine\\" about this album.  The subject matter of the lyrics sometimes have nothing to do with love or relationships, and when they do, they frequently have Captain Beefheart's generous and warm-hearted humor to keep it light.  \\"Autumn's Child\\" is a special delight lyrically; where else would one hear lyrics about a \\"Junebug's Picnic?\\"  \\"Gotten So Ugly\\" sees Captain Beefheart's imagination and humor come to the fore with a strange tale resembling \\"The Metamorphosis\\" and yet wrapped up in a blues-flavored musical package. \\"Electricity\\" crackles with the psychedelia of the mid-60's, and effectively employs a theremin as a musical metaphor.  On every song, top musicianship and carefully crafted songwriting in a rock or blues format keep the album coherent and emminently listenable.<br />  This album has gotten so many top reviews over such a long period of time and appeared on so many lists of \\"must have\\" albums that it is difficult to add superlatives to what has already been said or written.  I can just say that \\"Safe As Milk\\" lives up to every one of those good reviews, and belongs in the collections of anyone interested in the blues, rock, or the music of the '60's.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this entire book in three sittings...it was hard to put down.  You might as well buy the series, if you read one, you'll want to read them all.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|there are a lot of ads but it is a free download that kills<br /> time. I do not know what else people expect from a free game.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Loved this game as a kid and its even more awesome now! Great graphics, cool storylines, plus it takes time so its not over quickly
B0070TDERU|5.0|Love this series! I can't wait for Season 3 to begin. They do such a wonderful job with the historic details.

B0055SWM08|4.0|I like puzzle games and this one is a pleasure. Simple to play, but challenging to master. Beautiful graphics and music. Enjoyable!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best app I downloaded I like playing the games over again to try and beat my score kids love it too
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is amazing&hearts;!!! it is calming, but exciting, it is so much funnnnn!! Don't think just get it.. works great on kindle fire, no problems at all :-)
B0065GC0BA|5.0|Wonderful, really sad but a great read. Thought provoking and a useful insight into disability issues, euthanasia and ways of being happy.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|just like Mario only free, awesome would recomend it to all my friends. also want it to stay free! only problem is when you move you'll alive a little but other than that its great
B004X80QNG|1.0|I don't normally give negative reviews, but this app stood out as being pretty low quality, especially given the price. Crashed constantly on two different Androids, and as others have said it lacks any useful features.
B0059XTTW8|1.0|I ENJOY SUSPENSEFUL SPY THRILLERS....THIS MOVIE PROVIDED NO SUSPENSE OR THRILL! I'M RARELY SORRY I BOUGHT A MOVIE, BUT I AM FOR BUYING THIS ONE!!! THIS ONE WILL ONLY MAKE YOU JUMP OUT OF YOUR CHAIR TO RUN TO BED!!![[ASIN:B007BVOF8E Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]][[ASIN:B007G5K066 Tinker, Tailor Soldier, Spy (2-Disc Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet)]]
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love the pioneer theme! like how u build them but it takes too long to build up energy! should have more ways to gain energy but other than that its awesome!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is an awsome game you should get this app. it is very similar to Mario brothers. you really should get this app
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very nice solitaire game. No problems on my horrible Crystal View tablet. And if you know what that is, then you know any phone or tablet can run this.  Highly recommended.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this because my book club chose it. I wish I could get my money back. This book is vile. I caanot fathom WHY it is number 1 on NYT list.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|This another great title that you must continue reading of the Jack Reacher series. I love the suspense this novel brings to reading.
B0052U59F4|5.0|Quite and interesting and \\"stimulating\\" read.  I wonder if those things really happen to people.  Enjoyed the characters, kept me engaged the entire book and am looking forward to the sequel!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is amazing, and far better than cranky chickens. Sorry, but I'm a bit tired of that one.<br /><br />The people who complain about nagging are idiots. This game is worth far more than $0.99 in my opinion. The way the developer keeps the price that low is to make up for it in quantity sold. The way they make that happen is being low priced and having a lot of high start ratings. In order to accomplish the latter, they ask you a few times in the game to rate it. It's not that bad, they asked, maybe, 10x out of 80+ levels. Personally, I put it off until I finished the game.<br /><br />As for the complaints of bugs, I never experienced any graphical issues on my Razr, but my phone did become unresponsive for about 2 seconds a few times, but not long enough or often enough to bother me, and usually it happened when I was moving quickly on a puzzle, so I suspect it was my GPU struggling to render everything at one time, which means that if you've got a seriously underpowered phone, it might give you some issues.<br /><br />Regardless, buy the app, you won't regret it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a great app considering that its free.. great for all ages.  also a great pass time ... . . .
0399226907|5.0|Bought this as a birthday present for my two-year-old. She loves it, and enjoys trying to stick her fingers in the holes the caterpillar leaves in all the food. We also use it as a counting book with her. Very pleased.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|we love playing this game.  wish there was more choices to cook though but other than that its good well except it needs to be easier to get neighbors
B007MNV5WU|3.0|I really like angry birds but amazon app store can you please meme an updade that lets you have the whole game if not already in progress!!!!?
B000WEMH3C|1.0|Save your money and buy something more sturdy. This is made out of thin vinyl plastic. I bought mine on sale at Target for $6. It only lasted 6 months in the sun and rain. The top cracked and fell apart. Will upload a picture or video when I have the chance.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it is sooooooooo much fun. no waste of time it is so much like super Mario brothers except with leprecauns!!!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is almost exactly like Mario Bros. If you like Mario Bros and Nintendo games than get this game!!!!!!
0060245867|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas Present for my two-year-old. She loves this book. It's one of the two we read every night before bed. She loves the art work and likes to point out the \\"milk!\\" and \\"cookie!\\" whenever she sees them on any of the pages. She's a bit of a late talker so I love anything that seems to encourage her to use words.
B004QX07G4|3.0|Although I have enjoyed Ellen's other books, especially the first one, this one didn't make me laugh out loud. It wasn't the stream-of conciousness style, it was the lack of vitality.  I love Ellen and her show.  I think I was looking for something really funny, and this just isn't it.  Her first book made me laugh because she related the everyday situations that we all encounter that she somehow makes funny.  This, too, has everyday situations...but I just didn't find them funny.  There's a lot about Portia...and that should be expected because when we relate stories, we put our spouses into them, naturally.  It is an interesting book because of the peek you get into her life, but it is not laugh out loud funny.
B001GBUD4A|5.0|Ah, where to begin. I originally learned of Sonata Arctica back in high school. I was learning more about Dragonforce and why the hype behind them shouldn't really have been so extravagant simply because of that one song on Guitar hero, When I came across a comparison video between Dragonforce and Sonata Arctica. Needless to say, from them moment I heard Don't say a Word on youtube, I fell in love.<br />  Toni Kakko, their vocalist, brings an astonishing range to your ears. The pitches this man can reach is INSANE as well as the lyrical genius displayed in his work. Full moon, in this CD, in all honesty has captured my heart as my favorite song by them.<br />  Jani Liimaintanen, Unfortunately not with the band anymore, Demonstrates the very soul of Guitaring itself with melodic ballads, Blood pumping rhythms, and Amazing solos. What's even more astonishing is I believe he provides backing  vocals!! Trust me, I'm guitarist myself and the sheer amount of timing and skill it takes to play at that caliber as well as singing is mind blowing!!!<br /> The rest of this Power crew induce a wondrous musical chemical reaction With mysterious at times and at other times Awe striking Piano portions, Base lines that do the Bass instrument absolute Justice, and Drum beats that shouldn't be physically possible to maintain.<br />  All around, this Band is a Force of Nature and this, Their First CD, is a perfect buy for Fantasy rock, Older metal, and rock lovers in general, full circle. Pick it up, shipping is quick, quality is new, and the hours of entertainment are endless ^^
B004RJMUJO|1.0|I have the previous version but would never think of upgrading untill theyremove the unnecessary access levels like camera control or read user contacts.
0312641893|5.0|This was a surprisingly refreshing change over the books I've read recently, all of which were dry and hard to get into. I just happened upon this book two weeks before it hit the shelves and thought I'd give it a try because I have a policy of reading new writers.<br /><br />Boy was it a surprise! Deep in its own culture and rich in its persons detail. Cinder is a well rounded and surprisingly less flighty heroin. She didn't constantly think of herself but others. You can't help loving her.<br /><br />The story is a new take on the constantly reproduced Cinderella story and yet again a surprise. The ending left me wanting more and I look forward to the next book curious as to how this new writer will outdo her first book.<br /><br />I don't want to give any of the story away but I can say that this is well worth the read.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I enjoyed this game. it is AWESOME and.i  am  very addicted to this app. get it. who cares if its payed. GET THIS APP NOW
0439023521|1.0|If you enjoy a good story about child gladiators, you'll likely appreciate The Hunger Games. In other words...<br /><br />WARNING! THIS BOOK IS ABOUT KIDS KILLING KIDS!<br /><br />While the description of the violence is not excessive, I was taken aback by the details of each death: the manner in which the weapons were used, the locations of the injuries, the degree of suffering experienced by each child.<br /><br />I could forgive this sort of brutality in Twilight because the killers were fantastical monsters. But in a time of real-life bullies and teen-on-teen violence, I resented the author's choice to essentially sacrifice children for our amusement.<br /><br />Yes, reading this book you can't help begin to see Suzanne Collins as The Game Maker and yourself as a voyeuristic resident of Panem, eagerly awaiting every turn in the battle.<br /><br />And if you're expecting to unravel some grand ethical statement (ala Lord of the Flies) or simply gain some insight into why societies misbehave, you will be disappointed. I forced myself to finish the book to find its redeeming value. There was none.<br /><br />I saw a multiple opportunities for the protagonist to reject the premise of the games and protest the injustice of punishing children for the crimes of their parents (or great-grandparents in this case). But it never happens. Katniss just goes along with it, often distracted by the fashion choices of her stylists.<br /><br />Well, I reject the premise of this book. I don't want to send a message to entertainment companies that kids killing kids is a valid form of entertainment. Perhaps some ethical revelation is offered in the other two books, but I will never find out since I refuse to reward Collins and her publisher with more of my money.<br /><br />Astonishingly, if there is some ethical lesson that can be extracted from this story, it is an argument for ethical monotheism, specifically Judeo-Christian values. Clearly, The Hunger Games could not exist in a society that believes in the sanctity of human life, that children are not accountable for the sins of their parents, and that moral absolutes emanate not from man but God. However, I doubt that was Collins' intended message.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a really awesome game to play. It's basically Mario. It's a really good time waster and only takes a minute to get a hang of the controls. This is definitely worth playing.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I don't have the words to say how much I liked it!<br />Especially the music, Joe Hisaishi Ghibli composer returns to do the Mononoke soundtrack and the results are spectacular!
B0052U59F4|5.0|I haven't sat down to read a book in years until I heard people telling me how great this trilogy is. These are the best books I've ever read. I read all 3 books in a week because I couldn't put it down. I hope a movie is made.
B0055SWM08|5.0|My baby fell asleep to this relaxing music. I love it. I am sure my 6 y/o boys will enjoy it also. Thanks for the faotd. I would definitely recommend this app.
