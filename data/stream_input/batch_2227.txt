B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Very interesting the life of an enemy pilot. Great to read about the life they had and lived while in the service of their country. Excellent historical lesson, which I believe should be required reading at the high school level.... if for no other reason to give better perspective than Hollywood portraying the heroes story line. I would recomend this story to any and all who are interested in flight. The author is to be highly commended for his very hard work in order to bring this epic story to life.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|I really didn't think this book was for me but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Definitely a must-read for anyone who likes humour, time travel, or war in their books. :)
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|Ive seen slender before but have never actually played it.  I found this game to be pretty boring.  I easily got 7 notes but couldn't find the 8th for about 5 minutes after that, turns out I just missed the first one.<br /><br />Gameplay was boring, but controls and graphics were decent.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the game My Horse. it's the best game in the whole wide world and universe. I love it.
B00499QUK2|5.0|This series is so good.  The writing is clever and witty and the acting is top notch.  The mysteries are always interesting too.  My favorite was the one with the woman who kept foiling Sherlock.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|I mostly play multiplayer  the controls are good and the guns are great. It's basically like the call of duty franchise
1616550414|5.0|It is a must have for Zelda fans. The Book have a lot of information about Zelda Universe; if you love the video games, you will this outstanding Book
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I loved the game, loved the twists, loved the puzzles, loved the game play! 10/10 I would play this game again
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book isn't normally my genre, but it was great, page turning, and constantly left me guessing. If your looking for an exhilarating, well written novel, look no further than Gone Girl. Happy reading!

0143034901|2.0|Different strokes. My reading of Shadow of the Wind was late enough in its run that many have already lavished unaccountable praise on this meandering, preposterous novel. When i finally came to the end of this windy book,  I resolved yet again to wean myself from the unfortunate habit of finishing books I don't like. Telling the parallel stories of a curiously unknown author and a boy who discovers his work in the mysterious \\"Cemetery of Forgotten Books,\\" Zafron slogs through plot twists that are as predictable as they are overwritten. The similes pile one atop the next in a toppling tower of words, too many of which are \\"Shadow.\\" Get it!!<br /><br />Worse still was listening to a audio version in which the reader over-pronounced every Spanish word -- names and locations -- in an exaggerated Castilian lisp intimately associated with Barcelona, where the action takes place. ( I seem to recall a decades-old Saturday Night Live episode that did the same thing in a sketch featuring Jimmy Smits in a television newsroom.) That this is a book within a book reminiscent of the great Spanish language authors, notably Jorge Borges or Gabriel Garcia Marquez, is just plain silly. If I weren't so stubborn I could have enjoyed the exquisite pleasure of saying \\"I'm glad that's over\\" before I had to read to the very end.
0345525558|5.0|A compelling story that takes you into the heart and mind of a girl damaged by repeated rejection and being misunderstood. Her grief affects every relationship she has. The path to healing is slow but powerful. I really loved this book and could not put it down.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Keeps you on edge the whole time!!  You love Nick and then you hate him and you love Amy and then hate her. You can't decide whose side to be on.
0062014536|1.0|This is actually my first time writing a review because I have never been so disappointed with a book as I have been with the way this series ended.<br /><br />There are way too many things to say about this. Where to start?<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />Let's start with the fact that the only time you actually experience Alex and Lena happily together is in the first book. You write a trilogy where the entire plot line revolves around the fight for love, the right to experience love, and all you see is Lena and Alex so infatuated with each other in Book 1... and then after that, just flimsy, undeveloped relationships between other characters. I want to see what these people are FIGHTING for! Do they even know? There's flimsy allusion to other characters being in relationships, but you sense none of the passion that you'd expect from the people battling and risking their lives to feel what they feel.<br /><br />Rewinding to Book 2, it wasn't bad. But I mean let's be real, we all knew Alex wasn't really dead. So I'm waiting and waiting this entire book for Alex to show up, and it's not until the very end he pops up. So the natural assumption is \\"Yay, he's been gone this whole book but now we have a whole book with him and things get to be resolved!\\" Right? Wrong. Because Alex shows up to be a mute character throughout the entirely of Requiem aside from the total of three exchanges (mostly brief) he has with Lena before the very end when he tells her very briefly that he still loves her (which okay, obviously we knew) and they kiss quickly. That's all. Two whole books of a lead up to...\\"it's complicated\\" from Lena and a \\"I'm not going to leave you again\\" from Alex. Okay Alex, that's good you're not gonna leave Lena again but I mean, that doesn't change the fact that \\"it's complicated\\"! So what happens with Julian? No one knows. What happens with Tack now that Raven's gone? No one knows. Hanna? Lena's family? The country? Fred? Nope. We just get walls getting torn down in Portland. That'd be cool if Portland were the entire United States...and that wall being torn magically killed off every regulator and uncured traitor in the world...<br /><br />I SO agree with the other readers here that the characters were very poorly developed in this book (especially Julian). And Alex might as well not have even been there for the lack of role he played in dialogue or anything really. He basically served just as a diterrance between Lena and Julian's relationship, which was a point so obviously made when he left and Lena claimed to finally be able to be freer with Julian when he was gone. So much for the love you claimed to feel. And let's not forget how the girl literally believed the love of her life to be dead, this supposedly strong girl, and just LET him go off with some other girl because he \\"said\\" he never loved her...even though he also said that RIGHT after claiming the thought of Lena was the only thought that kept him going while being tortured! I felt like she used him saying that as an excuse to not have to deal with her conflicting emotions, but my opinion is that if she really loved him as much as she claimed to, or really loved Julian as much as she claimed to- it doesn't really matter to me, I just wanted her to make a decision honestly- she wouldn't have just let things drop. She would have been adamant about explaining her actions despite his very obviously untrue claims about never caring about her.<br /><br />Overall, absolutely nothing was resolved. I spent way too much of my time reading this book hoping for a conclusion to these and many more issues...and I got none. But hey, we at least got the lecture on \\"tearing down the walls\\" by the author at the end, right? Maybe that should be changes to \\"tearing down the pages of this book because I'm so angry\\"?wn in Portland.

0385347774|1.0|I haven't finished this book yet - I find the language objectionable so far.  Not much to say yet --  I do not hate it.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|My wife insisted we rent this stinker...I begged her not too, the trailer was enough for me but she thought it might be funny...NOT!!!!<br /><br />15 minutes into the &#34;movie&#34; my wife recanted and admitted it was juvenile at best, and agreed probably one of the worst ever.<br /><br />We argued for 10 minutes as to whether or not it was worse than Wild Wild West  or other stinkers of the last 2 decades.  But enough...she wanted to download another movie to watch, but I forced her to watch this to the bitter end, while I did something more pleasant....so I went to the kitchen and washed the dishes while the stinker ended.<br /><br />Do NOT let your wife make you buy this....you will simply loose precious time from your life where you could be doing housework or anything else better than this &#34;movie&#34;.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|It does everything you would expect from a Sudoku game, several skill levels.  Right now only attempting the very easy.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Good fun, my real rating though if the option were there would be 3.75.  Much better than average.  Interesting character but slightly contrived in places.<br />With a little too much meandering through subterranean book shelves, and especially incomplete motivation, background and ultimate fate of the chief antagonist.  But I did read it faithfully and with enthusiasm for the first 60% and the last 10%, which left me with a pleasant, satisfied intellectual afterglow...
B00005QB42|5.0|this is perfect music for playing while meditating or for yoga, very relaxing and a deep feeling of spiritual essence
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a very good and fun game to play. I would highly recommend this game to<br /><br />horse lovers, like myself.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|Bought it for my wife. She wanted a good case but wanted a thin look. This case was just that. Easy to go on and she loves the pink color. It came quickly and was a good price. I recommend this case for someone wanting a solid yet thin look. You can still put it in your pocket.

B008LSVLW4|5.0|I was surprised -and so glad- to find out that the second volume of the Eight Classic Albums collection to Peggy Lee was recently released! It contains some of my most favorite albums such as the avant-garde, way ahead of its time \\"Sea Shells\\" and the haunting \\"Dream Street\\", as well as the very cheerful \\"I Like Men\\", the lovely \\"Pete Kelly's Blues\\" soundtrack, \\"Miss Wonderful\\", \\"Jump For Joy\\", \\"The Man I Love\\" and \\"Pretty Eyes\\". All of them are magnificent, but unfortunately most are now out of print, therefore you just can get used copies or brand new ones but usually at very high prices.<br /><br />This 4-disc collection is a great way to get some of Peggy's best albums on CD at once. Honestly, given its very low price, I was expecting a lousy-sounding box set; however, all of the CDs sound rather good, and some I'd say even excellent, then I don't think you'll regret buying this collection.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love this and play several a day. Easy to Medium puzzles and something for everyone. Lots of puzzle packages to add to the collections.
B008220C56|5.0|In the very beginning I wasn't sure I was going to get into this film. The choice to have the majority of it set on the stage felt intrusive and distracting. But once you get used to this technique (and it does become less in-your-face as it goes on) it becomes rather easy to get swept away in the film's story and utterly breathtaking visuals. This is the most gorgeous looking film of 2012, possibly one of the most beautiful I've ever seen to be honest. From the cinematography to the sets and costumes, this is a real feast for the eyes.<br /><br />Keira Knightley reunites with her \\"Pride & Prejudice\\" and \\"Atonement\\" director for yet another period film, but this may just be her best performance yet. She is superb as the title character. Anna is a flawed, tragic heroine, but despite some of her choices I was able to sympathize with her. I've heard criticism about Aaron Taylor-Johnson's performance as Count Vronsky, but I personally found him very charming and it wasn't difficult to see how Anna could fall for him. Jude Law is very good as Anna's husband.<br /><br />\\"Anna Karenina\\" is a sexy and sweepingly romantic film. The unique and daring style may alienate some viewers, but I'd still recommend any fans of period films to give this a look. Or anyone who appreciates amazing cinematography and production design. I cannot stress enough what an astonishingly beautiful film this is. The groundbreaking technique elevates what could have been your standard, straight-forward period romance. Director Joe Wright has turned this into a fairly groundbreaking achievement.
B0076DELIG|4.0|I love Harry Bosch, and I think this was another solid installment. Would definitely recommend it to any other Harry Bosch fan. To anyone else, I would recommend starting at the beginning of the series.
B009O07NDY|5.0|This is a great soundtrack.  It is so nice to have a very complete soundtrack.  Over 30 tracks of music to enjoy from Howard Shore.  The only gripe I have, not with the CD itself, is I wish they Misty Mountain song included more verses from the book.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|John Wayne passed away in the late 1970's and I enjoyed most every movie. Clint Eastwood is too old to do any more Dirty Harry movies.<br /><br />Tom Selleck does an excellent job of portraying Jesse Stone in a way that perhaps John Wayne or Clint Eastwood might have done it, perhaps.<br /><br />Perhaps Tom Selleck is the modern version of both John Wayne and Clint Eastwood, except on Television.
B003O86FMW|5.0|As an avid fantasy reader this is one if the more down to earth and yet still enthralling books I have read. I would recommend it to anyone from young adults to adults.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Such a good inspirational book. I've been going through a rough time and seemed to be a perfect time to pick this book up. Some parts bring tears to your eyes and some make you not want to put it down. Some teach you about love and relationships. Extremely recommended.
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I should not have to pay for this since my original dissangrated and fell apart after 1 year so i will not buy anymore kindle devises .

B007IXWL2C|5.0|After reading some of the reviews, I was not expecting much when I started reading this, the last book of the Fifty Shades trilogy, but I am so glad I did.  I thought it was a great ending and really wrapped up the series very well.  If you liked the first two then this is a must read!  Wish there were more!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love zombie movies and apocalyptic shows, this one really keeps my interest and the tension between the actors is palpable!
B0058VW36U|5.0|A great game for young and old alike.  It's great that each new box (level) has an additional &#34;skill&#34; or two, to learn and master. I enjoy playing in tandem with my daughter ( she has an ipod touch and I play on the kindle).  Great game!

B009ZQTD7Q|1.0|The producers put money into costumes and scenery, but the heart of the story was butchered. Rochester was depressed and gloomy; none of his strength and humor were shown. The repartee which marks the romantic relationship and heightens the romantic tension between Rochester and Jane is largely cut, or given a depressing delivery. Something that was integral to the book, which I have never seen in any film adaptation, was missing: religion, and the idea that God rewards those who live in obedience to Him. I know it would be hard to condense a book this large into a 2-hour film, but too much was chopped out, condensed, put in different context.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|I can't move forward I'm stuck PLEASE HELP me I been looking for away out n I can't find it
B000B589JI|5.0|I always wanted some thing like this rather than buying two cans of zippo fluid and keeping one at work and the other at home I just fill this and keep it work
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I thought this was a good, straightforward narrative, with interesting details and a consistent, clearly articulated point-of-view. The writing is workmanlike, and often short on the kind of details that bring a book to life, or make a scene particularly poignant or vivid. But then, Kyle is a hero and patriot, not a writer, so don't go in expecting a literary work of the kind that has been produced by excellent writers who happened to write about war This is a soldier writing about war. And it's a lot like No Easy Day, the book about the killing of Osama bin Laden, which is also written by a man who's a soldier first and writer second.
B0082A3HTQ|5.0|What a great movie! It did not really follow the book &#34;The Second Wind&#34;, but it was qute funny to watch.

B001HBWY8M|5.0|I have watched this movie at least 100 times. No joking. The interaction between: mother and daughter, father and daughter, mother and son, grandmother and granddaughter, boy and girl, man and woman, husband and wife after 17 year separation -- the depth absolutely amazes me. I find the display all these types of love very heartwarming.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris comes across as just doing his job. It was like sitting down and talking to him personally about his experience. A life cut way too short, he had so much to give others.  Blessings to his wife and children....sounded like a struggle at times, but it also sounds like the journey was worth every minute of it!
B00755MHXG|5.0|An inspiring and beautiful book about people and things we rarely get the insight into in our busy lives.<br />If you need a reminder that human spirit and compassion can be and is a life changer to us all then you need to pick up this book and immerse yourself in the story of Auggie.<br />A book for teenagers that can and will change how we as adults view those that are different and desperately desire to fit in. This is the story of an underdog in life struggling to fit in and the sensitivity and humility that enables him to do so from his family and new found friends.<br />Beautifully written.
1603425381|5.0|This is a great book. Very clear directions, great photos, and many wonderful designs. A must have for anyone interested in crochet.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|A truly down to earth read of amazing coincidences and tongue-in-cheek encounters that will take you back through time and history to encounters and events that you had long since forgotten. Wonderfully loveable characters that are so different in every way but who are all joined by the admiration and respect for one such down to earth and honest man who is remarkable in every way! This book will make you wonder what lurks behind each and every senior citizen and how colourful their past has been!!  Beautifully written.
B008VBYN80|4.0|I have very much liked playing Kingdoms & Lords. There is  plenty to do within the game itself either online or off. You won't get far without buying diamonds, but as soon as you stop trying to find &#34;free&#34; stuff in life you'll enjoy life much more. No game worth playing is ever completely free. I would definitely recommend Kingdoms & Lords!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Just enoyed being able to continue from Season 1 to Season 2.  Highly recommend anyone to watch this.  Can't wait to see the next season.
B009E3EY4M|4.0|This ranks with The Band: The Last Waltz in its presentation of music, one of the best video/music recordings available.  I have not had the time to explore all the contents yet.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This is one of my favourite books ever! I have had a friend that has backstabed me!!!!! So we r pretty much on the same page. But,my life does not have the cheese.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun and entertaining game for both children and adults of all ages. I have a nephew who is only three and absolutely loves this game,whenever I'm babysitting him I just bring out my kindle fire and turn on this app,it keeps him entertained for hours.I myself love to play this game whenever I have to wait in line or when my family and I have a car trip it is a very exciting game.I very much suggest you buy it!^_^ (p.s I'm only 12)
B00942G4UA|3.0|This was an informative documentary. The material in this documentary was presented in an even-handed and fair manner. I would recommend that others watch this movie.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Not amazing literature but nice easy read novel.  Haven't seen the movie and not sure that I want to since much of the book is character's thoughts.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Only a SEAL could write such a book as this.  It is a reality check and a great insight to what makes the worlds best worrior.  You will also get an idea of what it is like to be the wife of a U.S.Navy SEAL. You may understand why the team mmbers have such a high divorce rate.  Every SEAL loves his wife, but love of country often impinges on their marriage to the breaking point. As you read this book, be mindful that these men are actually boys.  Most are onely 19 to 21 years old and doing a mans job in a most outstanding manner. Most of all, be thankful that they are on our side!  Thank you Amazon, for making this story available.  I think it should be mandentory reading for U.S. citizens.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|the game goes to the loading screen but then shuts down and returns to home... but it was a fun game to play while it was working
B003UPPO2G|5.0|There are 10 songs on the DVD which I just love.  It has as many great songs as Carlos Santana's Supernatural and Fleetwood Mac's The Dance.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a fun app to play with friends. I love how you can play mini games and enter competitions.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This game was amazing! The only thing I didn't like was that some times when you are turning it gets a little buggy. But other than that this game is AMAZING.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Not only does this book go deep into the fighting side of  warrior but also his feelings and even home life. The passages from his wife give an even fuller picture of families involved in war.
1476719071|4.0|To be honest, I will say that I read the Beautiful Disaster after Easy by Tammara Webber, so automatically it was harder to win my appreciation. Now, do not understand that I didn't like it. I liked it enough that, although I already had the e-book, I had to buy it in print also, yeah, I even bought the Romanian version, though I do not like the title (yucky!) nor that stripe that ruined the cover (lesson: when you decide the image of a collection it must be something ... adaptable).<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is for the teens ... she ones. It's just perfect to make you dream with open eyes at bad guys, but not quite bad, sweet \\"traps\\" and temptations ... We must be sincere to ourselves and to recognize that we love the dangers and challenges more when we have every reason to be sure that our rescue (and not in the 911 way) is so close.<br /><br />And to be all more intense, the characters have a past which they must reconcile with and should not let it ruin their future. Here I could say that I would have liked more if the story wouldn't have left me the impression that at some point I started reading another book. Travis becomes a \\"secondary\\" character in the second part and I think it would be possible to find a way to merge the two main paths.<br /><br />About protagonists what should I tell you? I don't say you anything because I want you to discover them yourselves. That they are sexy, smart, rebels and ... that they become crazy one for another ... that was clear after so many presentations that have praise them.<br /><br /> The action is fun and exciting, there are problems to solve, obstacles to past, wrong choices, moments of tension. When it seemed to me that some \\"event\\" is a bit forced, I remembered that we talk about some kids who think they can do and achieve anything, even if it's about a little strange bet or ... you'll see.<br /><br />It's one of those books that you can't put it down until you read it, though you can find it some faults.<br />Wherefore I'm just waiting for Walking Disaster.
B007RFDCQA|5.0|A must have! One of my all time favs.  It ranks right up there with The Breakfast Club.  My movie collection is now complete
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Daniel Craig is definitely the best along with Sean Connery, but the story didn't work for me. My fear is that the next plot is going to be about vampires or zombies. Logical right? Every other TV and movie seems to have this or some occult theme. Oh ya, forgot, there is a perpetual WAR ON TERROR GOING ON, so there has to be a villain. Scared yet? Did some say US or Israel. Aah, rouge drone strikes on American citizens by, you guessed it, IRAN! Sounds like a Mossad op! That's a wrap.
B00011D1OA|5.0|Just like Eliza herself: remastered to perfection. The sound, color and 2nd disc full of special features each enhance this must have classic.
B0067Q04AM|3.0|I bought the CD without hearing sample cuts and based on him winning the Grammy.  I had to shut it off after the first 4 tunes and turn on some Teena Marie (LOL)....His tunes/songs all sound the same and I couldn't distinguish one singer from another..Oh sorry, I knew Erika Badu's voice....the same beat, same slow mo....but this is very unimaginative IMO.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This was a very readable book, with enough tension to keep me turning the pages. The author developed the parallel stories very well...on one hand the psycho cop on the chase, and on the other hand the story of his estranged wife who has gone into hiding with a new identity, and desperately tries to keep her new location hidden from him. I thought one aspect of the ending was rather highly improbable (don't want to spoil it if you haven't read it!) otherwise I would have given the book 5 stars.
0553801473|4.0|My anger with RR Martin will not allow me to give it a 5. If he doesn't hurry up and write I'm going to lose my mind. Realistically he is becoming somewhat scattered. I was a &#34;Tales of Malazan&#34; fan, the author began telling so many stories that you couldn't follow them all and at the end he didn't really answer the questions he developed. I feel like the same is happening here. I hope he narrows his narratives and fleshes out the characters we have now. Still by this book you already know. You also know you aren't going to stop now.
B000CNFC76|5.0|This Movies has become one of my all time favorites. The &#34;view of the game&#34; from the point of the audience is probably the best I've ever encountered in a movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone especially to persons who love the game of golf or are interested in understanding the history of this great game.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|they were great they had it to  me fast and it was reasonably priced not to bad at all overall
B0097EWK3A|5.0|a fun game was fun to solve. waiting for more. will tell me friends. have a few games from the same company .................
B005IQZB14|4.0|Enjoyable tale of adventure, struggle, finding oneself and overcoming emotional conflict. A bit more graphic than need be at times. Overall a good read for those who enjoy the outdoors.
B000I3PERS|5.0|True Courage and True Righteous Rage very well expressed! A real man is nice to see ... and it is so rare.
B001GEH4MG|5.0|Sounds incredible. The work done to get this album restored is well worth the price. I can hear a lot of nuances that are not on previously released versions, but were captured with this remaster. The sound gets better, not abrasive when cranked up. I highly recommend it.
B000L9EKL0|4.0|Areally good movie, suspensful and gripping, but it doea not have any of my very favorite actors and that for me takes one star out. Nonetheless, definitely worth seeing ... even more than once.
B0011MZOEI|1.0|Absolutely terrible.  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I don't remember much about reading this one. It however is a paranormal.Give it a try and submit your opinion
B000FBJHZS|5.0|What a wonderful book.  As usual Dan Brown has pulled another rabbit out of the hat.  His way of writing is very, very exceptional.  Looking forward to new books by him.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This site is just flat addicting.  Once I get on, it's a long time before I get off.  Lots of ideas offered, new things to try.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|the controls took some getting used but once mastered made the game go smoother.  very atmospheric graphics and music. the whispering drives me nutty. I literally yelped outloud a cuople of times and one full on scream when I ran into slender man.  I have yet to find all pages so don't know if their placement is randomized per completed game elsewise there will be limited replayability value.<br />nice game though too scary &amp; stressful for my taste.
B004IHE2B4|5.0|Ordered this to go with my LEGO train.  The shipper of the LEGO train sent an incomplete kit, so I have not used them yet, but plan to on my next LEGO train.
B00457X7XQ|1.0|I liked his Trojan Horse well enough but I couldn't finish reading this one (and I only rarely don't finish a book).<br /><br />A key part of the plot had Jeff trying to recover an infected system at a business.  The drama built on him solving it - or else.  In short, and as a computer expert myself, his single-minded approach was just absurd and utterly unbelievable.  I was happy to ignore minor errors (routine use of a *floppy* disk?) and even larger ones (generic Windows viruses affecting propriety industrial computers) but when the characters don't behave like real people then it's impossible for me to connect with them and their conflicts.<br /><br />If you don't know much about computers it might seem interesting, perhaps Mark simplified the story too much to appeal to a broader audience.<br /><br />I appreciate the other commentators who recommended Daemon - I'll check that out.
B00942X8PY|5.0|I, unlike the other people who have left reviews, found this game to be great! Appealing minimalistic visuals, but very well done, nice sound effects and fun gameplay! Further, the game teaches you how to play by introducing new elements one at a time which adds to the puzzle but i never found frustrating. Great game design! works and looks great on the note 2, using the s pen in this game is very pleasurable.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I found it hard to read and follow at times.  Plot was scary and upsetting.  I cannot recommend this book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome...the best thing on T.V right now. I know there will be an ending to the series, but I hope it goes for another 10 seasons.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|One of the best movies to come from disney for a long while. This one is not just aimed at kids.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Just great I really like horses and this game is the best game ever. And how many other games give you unicorns.
0385523386|4.0|This book was riveting, no doubt about it. And for all of the reviewers that want to hate on Ms. Kerman because she continues to remind us that she is white and went to Smith....well, sorry folks, but them's the facts. And from that you can extrapolate the truth: that it IS highly unusual in our penal system that white, educated women of means go to prison. Especially if they're pretty.<br /><br />I thought the book was quite well written with my only critical thoughts coming in two areas:<br /><br />1. Time. I wish the book had been more clear as to how much time had passed. Perhaps she could have used the conceit of naming the chapters as months. I should think that time is ever present in the mind of a prisoner and although I got a sense of the crushing thought of 13 months, the writer never kept that foremost in this reader's mind. I wanted to feel that constantly as a weight, as she must have.<br /><br />2. The unreliable narrator works in fiction but not in non-fiction. I felt Ms. Kerman was unreliable because it became obvious to me that she was suffering from exercise bulimia and/or disordered eating yet never addressed those issues in the book. That made her dishonest to me. (And it may have mitigated some of the hating reviews. A white, educated woman of her age generally struggles with body image issues. It would have made her more real and less one-dimensional.) She revealed intimate details as she knew them about other prisoners but was not completely honest or open about her real struggles in prison. Perhaps in writing this, she was not ready to feel the suffering again. I can appreciate that. Perhaps more time should have passed.<br /><br />All that said, it was a \\"can't put down\\" book for me.<br /><br />And remember people, she did the crime and did the time.
B001P7HUF0|3.0|Grisham is a good novelist until you come to his downplayed endings.  This movie is just shy of the quality you would expect from a Matt Damon flick and Danny Devito gives it a comic feel that I do not care for in a legal thriller.  I was simply disappointed in his portrayal of the sidekick of a compassionate, caring attorney that Damon seemed to develop.  Matt Damon did not overact and I believe Devito did to a great degree.<br /><br />This movie was just not a good legal thriller.  It was more like slapstick!
B008YKGQR4|3.0|It's no different then opening it with browser. I'd rather stick with that. Just my personable opinion. You feel me my peoples
B006RXPTNM|5.0|Did he or didn't he?  Did his sermon get to the principal?  Was she guilty of what she accused him of?  Thought provoking regarding the Catholic Church in the US.  I cannot say enough about the excellent acting.  You must see this film if you do not mind an ambiguous ending.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Good storyline but a bit fast moving. One fortuitous event after another. Extreme jealousy, and respect, love/hate. King loves him, Queen hates him. King 's daughter loves then hates him. Hero one moment, then into the dungeon the next. It needs a bit more restraint for more mature audiences. Easy read, better for teens.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Characters are complex and realistic,  I believe that everybody has a bit of them inside and that anyone would recognize itself in some or in other action or thought that appears on the book!
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Excellent series. The best show on television. Wonderful writing, unbelievable acting and lots of fun. Doesnt get any better than Castle.
B00004XPPK|5.0|Few could find fault with Rita Hayworth's dazzling performance. She creates an irrestistable character, and the performances the entire cast are well done.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|Very good series, well acted and good story of the rich and the servents.<br />Looking forward to season 4.<br />Would recommend this series
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|good controls,  reasonable amounts of time for powerups for a free app. customizable controls are well varied. I didn't see any adds polyp during my gameplay yet. Impressive!!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I chose a 5 rating because I love anything about John F Kennedy. Well written and one of Stephen Kings best novels.
B000LB7G00|2.0|If you have a mac, the driver for the space navigator doesn't work. It works the first time you install, but the next time you reboot, it doesn't seem to work. The only way to get it to work is you have to reinstall the driver every time you start your computer. what a pain. until they fix this, stay away. When it works, it is a good 3D mouse.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|Lots of hidden objects games within it but not as good as their other games storyline wise. It was enjoyable though.
B0064MT1QW|5.0|The English Patient is my favorite movie of all time. Before owning the disc I had to rely on random scheduling of broadcasts or recording & then losing it when the dvr had to be replaced. Now I can view it whenever I want to. The Blu-ray version brings this beautiful film out to its' absolute best! Great purchase and a reasonable price.
B001OBT3FC|5.0|A must have If you enjoy Home Theater and are able to see and hear this in a proper setting, great picture and sound, will enjoy it EVERY single time I play it.
B004UB9SKS|5.0|It works without the internet, so for finding out where the bus or  train station is, or other more frequently used sentences that you need, that is great. You can actualy have a short interaction with someone. It is useful and I will let you know more when we go to germany and my husband will talk to my dad for the first time (  oh so fun lol)
B005XI94HY|5.0|Never thought Florence and the Machine would out do Lungs, but this album is over the top. I bought Shake It Out as a single and liked it so much I bought the entire album. And I have not been disappointed. This is an oustanding edition that belongs in everyone's collection.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I've read most of the Reacher novels, and this one is just as good as the rest. Hard to put it down and always lots of twists and turns! Lee Child is one of my favorite authors and has done an excellent job of keeping the excitement going from novel to novel.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Great movie. Definitely a must have for history or economics fans. Absolutely no complaints. Would gladly suggest it to anyone.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|I've read most of the Reacher novels, and this one is just as good as the rest. Hard to put it down and always lots of twists and turns! Lee Child is one of my favorite authors and has done an excellent job of keeping the excitement going from novel to novel.
B00A4Y9BT8|5.0|I bought the cd when it came out in 1993 used to crank it out loud after classes in high school, now twenty years later listening to this music again brings back great memories, every single song from this album rocks like the day it came out...just awesome..
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I screamed my ass off playing this game. its was so fun even though I lost when I only had one more page to get. But seriuosly, this is a fun game :)
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I read this book in almost 3 days.  I really enjoyed it.  Similar to all of the Nicholas Sparks good but it was a great story.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|This show is one of my favorites of the last ten years. Few shows make me sorry when the episode ends. This is one of those shows. Each episode is so gripping for me. I love the way the characters and the plots unfold. It's magical.
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|The story of this movie was clever and kept me watching until the end.  However, as someone who is not a fan of violence the movie is full of violent images.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|this is another of those series that you're not ready for each episode to end. I love the costumes, the sets the music, the story. It's different and fresh. And the characters really pull you into the story.
B002ZF24A2|5.0|Just had to have it on psp One movie I will never get tired of. Im a big collector of umd movies<br />for my psp The best hand held game system ever made in my book.
B0043UB0EI|5.0|By far the best installment of the series. I like the costuming, characters and the story. It depict Ancient Rome more realistic than what I've seen. And the kind of 300/Anime style of the MMA inspired fighting was really interesting.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Well organized, lots of detail, and best of all, recipe e4xamples of cooking with no wheat. I lost 15 lbs the first month.
B0098VXMNE|4.0|I have to edit this review, because at the time that I wrote it, I didn't know that the original actor that portrayed Spartacus had a terminal illness and couldn't play the role again.<br /><br />However, I do only give this four stars because I feel the makers could have gotten someone that 'fit' a little more. The actor they got to play Spartacus, is too American. He has the presence and somewhat the look, but not the voice. His voice has the undertone of a different region and that is kind of distracting. He also has the look of an American. The previous actor had a more European look. The same with Navia. The first actress had a look to her as well, the new doesn't have that same look. The first actress had a kind of quiet, submissiveness and delicacy to her. The second one doesn't.<br /><br />Over all, this is a good show and fans of Spartacus will more than likely enjoy it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is my favorite game for the Kindle Fire HD. I play this whenever I have free time. Move over temple run, subway surfers is the best game.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Gave as a gift and he loves it! I watched them -- hadn't seen any of the movies before and they are a must watch.
B005LAII80|4.0|Of course I like the film, if you want a movie review check out RottenTomatoes.com. This Bluray combo pack rocks because it comes with an HD Digitial Copy which you can import right into iTunes (in HD) and did I mention it is HD? Would be five starts if it included more extras. If you like the movie and want an HD version in your iTunes then GET THIS!
1118109791|4.0|The official GMAT review is the trusted source as always. But there is not much difference between the question set between the 12th and 13th edition, which is something expected.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I adore this game. It starts off with a horse you must take care of. You can have an avatar, buy clothes for him/her; you can buy tack for your horse and buy many other horse in different color pelts. You may also compete. Please get the game... it's worth! ;)
B002KSPKRS|2.0|It gets 2 stars because no matter the batteries used it crackles and isn't nearly as comfortable as even cheaper Turtle beaches.
B0019O6IWU|5.0|This book clearly articulates how dangerous negative communication can be. It is not focused on the obvious level but more on the subtle side of communication; which can be so damaging to a relationship. I started using these techniques with my son, my fiancé, and inside my professional environment with outstanding results. I intend to continue to practice because I believe the reading this book is only part of the problem but self reflecting during all conversations are an essential way to gain that muscle memory to enhance the positive side of communication.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love the depth of the characters and some of the back story to them. Still a great read, and I can't wait for the next book.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is so much fun.  everyone in my family plays it and we all share hos We are doing and compete to see who is the best.  you will like it a lot.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am currently on level two. This is my first Jillian DVD. I love it. It's a challenge but not so bad that I give up. Just when I really want to give up she switches it. I have lost weight and inches already. I have been doing it during the week while eating healthy. I highly recommend Jillian' s shred.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think of my friends should get it. It can with temple run. Thank you for making this game. You rock. From puppy
030758836X|4.0|great book! keeps you wanting to read & find out the truth behind it all. I would recommend this to readers who like a great twist!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This is a great book for me because I spell everything wrong! I am not good at spelling. Thank you for this dictionary!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Ok so my highest is 6/8 pages and all I hear is what are you doing up so late? Next thing I knew my heart is pumping 200 miles an hour and my kindle is already across my room. For more scare make fog true and put it on hard with the lights off in your room and its midnight. I got it for free but it's totally worth the money. GET THIS APP FOR A GOOD SCARE! TRUST ME IS GONNA MAKE YOU PEE YOUR PANTS!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I read the negative reviews and I think I see the conflict. People watch reality shows and think they are \\"real\\" as the name reality says. What they need to keep in mind is that they are not flies on the wall, there is a camera CREW in front of people on reality shows. Ask yourself, could you act normal with a camera crew in your living room? You have two choices, hide, or act.<br />So the conflict is, these people watch Napoleon Dynamite and think it is a reality show, when in fact it is fabulous acting. Jon Heder and Efron Ramirez have been in several movies, and when you see them you think, wow, they were acting fabulous in N.D. I am a teacher of 20 years, and a parent two. Of course there are nerds and geeks, but never to this level. Thats why this movie is great. You care about the characters, realize everyone can have fulfilling lives and experiences and be appreciated, and that is what comes across in this movie. Plus, it is very funny. Tina, come and eat some ham!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show. I've download every episode from season 3 on my kendle and watch it all the time. I watch the black and white episodes on Thursday too. Just as good.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|Or should I say, I've seen this story before and the movie starred Julia Roberts. Slap, Sleeping with the Enemy on the cover and enough said.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|At first I loved the concept of suspense and movement through a world that looks like a well executed pencil drawing.  I got frustrated with the controls.  You touch the screen to get a toggle to travel forward and backwards.  Touch the screen again orient your field of vision.  Touch again to try and get the toggle back and it may not come back,  leaving you stabbing the screen with at best eventual results.  There is no guide or hint telling you how the controls work : you learn through trial and error.  I got up to the fifth note  a few times then uninstalled.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I love buying music from amazon. It's so simple and I love the cloud.<br /><br />This album is really great. I know a lot of people can relate to songs on this album.<br /><br />I have tremendous respect for Macklemore because he makes the music he wants to make and he is using his voice and talent to spread positive messages.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Here's a film that delivers the story as you read it in hardback, paperback or e-book.  It was wonderful to actually meet the characters as I dreamed them to be.  There was no way to be disappointed on my end.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Wow! This is a wonderful game. Colorful and easy to use, works great on all Kindle Fires. If Big Fish Games makes another game like this I will buy it. The full version is worth every penny. Five stars for sure!
B0084IG8TM|3.0|More or less interesting story line.  More or less good acting.  I can tell if a movie is good by whether or not it keeps me awake.  I caught myself snoozing!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is wonderful. I really love it. Its a great 3d simulation. Every one should try this app. My 3 yearold sister loves it
B005LAIHGI|2.0|If you saw his first movie, you don't have to see this one.  It is the same old, same old.
B004OC07N0|5.0|Regardless of your position at your work, this book carries lots and lots of wisdom. I also like the exercises here and there in the book which make the book a practical tool for your first 90 days
B004LWZW4M|3.0|How many sequels can you make without repeating the same old story line.  This one falls in the category of: &#34;If You've Seen One, You've Seen Them All.  If you like to watch big apes lumbering on and outsmarting humans, then this is for you.  To me, if you seen one, you've seen them all.
B0085KGHI6|5.0|What can I say, Muddy Watters is playing a gig is a small Chicago venue and in come the Rolling Stones and play a pick up gig with him. This takes place in the early 80s when the Stones are filling stadiums with fans and here they are coming to see one of their icons and the source of the band's name. All I could think about how lucky those few people the came to see a Blues ledgend in a small iconic venue and got the Rolling Stones as a bonus.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I didn't purchase this for the story line.  I bought it for the music.  Mama Mia!  Put it in the player and turn off the picture!
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|The game control is really good, but the game itself is just lame!!!  How is it scary?  A skinny dude pop up every once awhile???
B004LWZW7E|4.0|I really like the story for this movie.  Justin?  Take him or leave him.  The acting was so-so.  The concept that we only get so much time at birth and what we do either nets us more or less.  Great metaphor for life.  What are you going to do with and for your time?
B001D09OAI|5.0|I have loved this movie for YEARS.  Probably a lot funnier if you are an MLB fan, though.  Worth a look to see the unfulfilled promise that was Charlie Sheen and a pre-President Palmer Dennis Haysbert.
B006ISJQ1W|3.0|It's a Johnny Depp movie.  You have to like Johnny if you are going to buy it.  He has so many other films that this one doesn't hit the mark.  You won't miss anything if you don't watch this one.
0307476464|3.0|As a big Murakami fan, I was excited to read 1Q84. In Murakami's fiction, the world we know is always slightly off and 1Q84 is no exception. But at 1,200 pages, I wish the novel (or three novels) had been edited better. Too much repetition bogged down some of the pages. Another issue is that halfway through the book, the reader begins to know more than some of the main characters so a lot of the remaining chapters are waiting for them to play catch-up (especially with Ushikawa's sections). Still the book is like no other. From the moment the main character Aomame, or &#34;Green Peas&#34; climbs down the ladder off of the highway and enters a strange world filled with Little People, a Town of Cats, and a sky with two moons, I was transported just as much as in some of Murakami's best works like Wild Sheep Chase, South of the Border West of the Sun, Sputnik Sweetheart, and the Wind-Up Bird Chronicle. The difference, however, is that those books topped out at 600 pages max, just around the time I felt ready to leave Murakami's surreality. So 3 stars for the wild trip, but not a perfect book since after a while I was just waiting for it to end.
0800141660|5.0|I have been watching this over, and over, again. I love all the characters in it. They did a great job acting in it.
030758836X|3.0|It's difficult to read a book that is hyped up for its twists and turns since it rarely winds up living up to that hype. Gillian Flynn is a great writer who creates fully-drawn characters, but once the BIG TWIST was revealed halfway through the book, I found the rest of it to be a let down and difficult to believe. Her novels &#34;Dark Places&#34; and &#34;Sharp Objects&#34; are written just as well and have twists of their own since both are mysteries, but I found those books to be far superior than &#34;Gone Girl.&#34;
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love this version of Austen's Pride & prejudice. I get chills every time Lizzie, and Mr. Darcy look at each other.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I would recommend this book to any teenager. It is a realistic coming of age novel and the author has a unique style of writing. I really fell in love with the main character, Charlie.
B004SIP7AS|5.0|I love this movie! I can't get enough of it. I think gwyneth did a superb job as Emma. I am in love  with all the Austen movies.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|My Kindle Fire was just over a year old when the cable went bad. Amazon replaced it for free with this charger, plus another piece that has one of those little flip-out plugs you can tuck away when traveling. Works great. Charges quickly. Excellent customer service.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I love this version also because of Colin Firth. He is so sexy in this version. I guess this is the mini series so it is a lot longer, and explains more background on the characters.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like the way the battery pops up when you switch on your tablet.  It gives you the expected time left on an easy to read gui.  I'm on a kindle fire and this lets me know how much time I have left for tasks and combined tasks such as surfing the web, watching movies, playing games and reading.<br /><br />I believe their are options for setting this app to save battery life but I haven't played with those yet.
B00003JRCQ|1.0|I did not care for this movie. I did not feel anything between these two people as I did with the other Austen movies.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I am a self-described emotionally contained individual.  But I have never cried SO much over a book.  I would have to lay the book down, get a rein on my tears that were threatening to fall and come back to it at it a later.  This book was just amazing. Much has been said so there's no need for me to say it all again, but I let this book sit in my wish list for far too long because I truly underestimated it.  Wonderful read!
B0050AV5MW|5.0|Loved the books and it was really good value. Best of all read this while on a trip, only needed to pack my phone instead of 5 huge books
B0078XGEK2|5.0|fantastic point of view for love and relationships. What makes you a better loving person from the age of a baby.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|This is another wonderful series that didn't make it past the first season.  Well cast, fantastic scripts, and a storyline that was not allowed to reach it's potential.  Strongly recommend!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love playing with my daughter! We have a lot of fun pretending that we have horses, you can't go wrong with this app for the price
B006RUJST6|4.0|I was new to buying & reading books online & bought this mainly due to cost. Then I enjoyed it so much I bought the sequel. The young relationship was portrayed expertly & the 'slamming' was enjoyable.
B004LP3AYI|4.0|After reading it, I'm reading the rest of the series.  There's a lot of romance, which I'm not that great a fan of, but I thought the characters were interesting.  Zedd makes me laugh.<br />The book has a decent storyline.  Well worth a read even if it weren't free.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Throughout this novel there are so many 'gasp' moments as the story unfolds its brilliant!  Such a fantastic concept and I think the ending was perfect.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this beyond words!!! I'm so addicted to Pinterest... Not only is it fun to browse but it gives you great tips and ideas for everything from fashion to travel locations... There's something for every one and anyone
B002RI9UBS|5.0|All I can say is hang in there until the end. This novel is brilliant! Such a fabulous concept & expertly written.

0525953728|5.0|A lot of these people write such a long rewiew that to me, it seems like, they themself want to write a book. I will just make it simple. This is the best book i have ever read.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|That's what matters the most.<br /><br />I'm giving five stars since there's no \\"half-star\\" button.  The only real drawback is that's it's not exactly blazing fast.  I've tried other programs that were faster, but  they weren't  reliable.  But if crashing in the middle of work is totally unacceptable, go with Splashtop.<br /><br />Oh, yeah. - please add a \\"pagedown\\"/\\"pageup\\" button.  This is important.<br /><br />  Hal McCombs

B0053B347M|4.0|This led light strip was easy to apply to the back of my computer screen. It's not the brightest led light strip but it helps at night. I will purchase another one the give me the desired ambiance light output. Plugs in easily via USB. It also has an ON and OFF switch which is nice because you don't have to unplug the USB to turn it off. I plan on purchasing several more for various applications around the house. I would recommend to a friend.
B008Q0D32S|5.0|I don't usually watch westerns, but this one was one that I'm glad I did watch.  I loved Henry Fonda's role.  I think it's the first time I've seen him play a bad guy.  It was a little slow in starting, but stick with it, and you will be glad you did.

B004J4WKTW|4.0|Erin Morgenstern’s “The Night Circus” is the enchanting tale of two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who are mortally bound to one another in a magic competition where the outcome preordains that only one of them will survive. Forced into a rivalry created by their mentors, the magicians Prospero the Enchanter and Mr. A.H_, who groom and equip their young prot&eacute;g&eacute;s with magic abilities to use in a final confrontation, Celia and Marco find themselves inextricably in love. The enigmatic Night Circus that moves around the world from city to city and is only open to the public at night serves as the forum for this game to which the two young magicians are unwillingly a part.<br /><br />Morgenstern has a gift for descriptive language that paints intricate images of the characters and scene settings. The story’s magical theme extends to the author’s writing as she slips in vague references and sleights of hand to describe the scene in unexpected ways. Her skillful use of point of view and second-person present tense makes the story all the more fanciful. Her prose is captivating. The author’s ability to migrate the story from different perspectives and places makes it all the more compelling, although it can be an exercise in patience keeping all the perspectives, characters, places, and dates straight.<br /><br />The story has moments of greatness, from the formation of the circus and the untimely deaths of some of its actors to a fascinating, surprise conclusion. However, the narrative at times stagnates as Morgenstern devotes substantial space to painting scenes in such vivid detail that it detracts from the plot. One can spend pages trying to decipher which information is relevant to the story or is extraneous. It leaves the reader wondering why some details were included when they seemingly lead to dead ends. The storyline plods along so long that Morgenstern rushes to bring it to an uncharacteristically messy conclusion. The narrative’s fits, starts, stops, and pickups may leave readers with the impression that novel is not unlike a wood-fired, iron horse locomotive struggling to pull the Night Circus’ boxcars up a steep mountain pass en route to their next destination.<br /><br />Morgenstern’s writing is indeed magical. For that I give “The Night Circus” four stars and recommend her novel to anyone with an interest in magic, the darker arts, or a great example of using allusion and imagery. The book won’t disappoint.stops, and pickups may leave readers with the impression that novel is not unlike a wood-fired, iron horse locomotive struggling to pull the Night Circus’ boxcars up a steep mountain pass en route to their next destination.<br /><br />Morgenstern’s writing is indeed magical.

B00AJRQLTI|4.0|The music evokes scenes from the movie. If you enjoyed the movie and want to remember the music, this works well.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This was the most hated book I could not put down.  I had to see what was going to happen but I didn't like myself for reading it.  The language offended me, the story line was SO depressing, I felt so sorry for the characters, it reminded me of so many families with mental illnesses that don't even know it.  I can't stop thinking of that child and his home life for the next 18 years, the psycotic person created by Amy's parents, and the man raised by Nick's parent's.  This sick mess will go on with their child and on and on, down the generations until someone gets help and puts a stop to it.  I don't think I'll read anything else by this author as I don't like depressing books.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Bought this because of the price I figured how bad could it be. I really enjoyed the twist in the story...want to know ...read the book

B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I watched it on a plane and had to be careful not to laugh out too much. Mark Wahlberg is spot on with the timing, seemingly feedeing off of Ted and vice versa. And Mila Kunis, enough said!!!
B001QWBM62|4.0|Great Product, I just recently dropped mine and now it does not appear to be working. I'm going to open it up and see what I can do. I may update if I get it to work. They should make a ruggedized version if they dont already. Either way I was able to make some great recordings with this with very little effort. Read the Manual and get used to messing with the mic recording level so you can get your level right for the space.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|Always like stories based on actual events, it shows how strong people can be even when they don't think they are. I thought this was a very interesting story and, for many years now, loved Helen Hunt!!
B007RKPO84|5.0|Kreator are truly one of those bands that you can definitely depend on to deliver and unleash an unstoppable onslaught of pure stomping, high-speed, ball busting thrash metal. Their newest album from 2012 &#34;Phantom Antichrist&#34; has shown that these legendary German thrashers just keep on getting better with age. This album just smokes, rips, blazes, shreds, and stomps like an angry, rabid beast. It is truly devastating, but in a good way of course, it never disappoints whatsoever. The production on this album thanks to Jens Bogren is just superb and stunning. Every song here on &#34;Phantom Antichrist&#34; is just amazing, varying from romping, stomping, high-speed thrashers such as the title track, &#34;Death to the World&#34;, &#34;Civilization Collapse&#34;, &#34;United in Hate&#34;, and &#34;Victory Will Come&#34;, to powerful melodic power cuts like &#34;From Flood into Fire&#34; (my favorite track on here), &#34;Your Heaven My Hell&#34;, &#34;The Few, The Proud, The Broken&#34;, and &#34;Until Our Paths Cross Again&#34;. Like I said, every song on here smokes, there's not one bad song on here whatsoever. Mille Petrozza continues to deliver his angry and devastating vocal attack while adding some occasional clean/spoken word singing as well. The guitars of Petrozza and Sami Yli-Sirnio are also awesome, and I mean flat out awesome as well with a boatload of catchy, heavy, lightning fast, bone crushing riffs, and wonderful, technical solos and harmonies that are so proficient and perfectly executed. And of course let's not forget about Ventor's awesome drumming earth shaking and in your face double bass drumming which propels through the songs at such high-speed intensity, it'll get a series of mosh pits going absolutely bananas like a mad frenzy throughout.<br /><br />Kicking off &#34;Phantom Antichrist&#34; is the short anthemic like buildup instrumental intro &#34;Mars Mantra&#34; which leads right into the album's title track which kicks things straight into high gear with an onslaught of full ahead frantic, slicing riffs, ramming, speeding drums, and angry vocals, and there's also a wicked solo added as well. Next, we have &#34;Death to the World&#34; which is another relentless tidal wave of a thrasher highlighted by monstrous, barn burning riffs and blazing lead work, and full throttle drumming throughout, meanwhile &#34;From Flood into Fire&#34; (which I mentioned earlier is my favorite track on here BTW) is highlighted by stunning, face melting guitar harmonies especially during the intro, plus a memorable chorus, as well as a careening solo at 2:25 after the second chorus which leads into a clean vocal section at 3:02, which is lead into some glorious and eargasmic melodic soloing afterwards. Track five &#34;Civilizations Collapse&#34; is another wicked hot smokin' thrasher that begins with a galloping drum intro, and also features more hammering, high-speed drumming and fast, slicing riffs, and angry vocals from Mille, plus more wicked, face melting solos as well. Track six &#34;United in Hate&#34; starts off with a nice, splendid acoustic intro, and then it erupts into another head on thrash attack. This song also features another memorable chorus, and more slamming double bass attacks and more awesome soloing as well.<br /><br />Next up, we have &#34;The Few, The Proud, The Broken&#34; which is a supremely catchy and emotionally evocative gem that boasts hard stomping, marching beats, galloping melodic riffs and leads, and angry yet emotionally charged screaming vocals to boot including a catchy and reapeating shout along line of &#34;FORWARD MARCH, WARRIOR RACE&#34;. The following &#34;Your Heaven My Hell&#34; begins with a soothing intro with some clean spoken vocals, and then sends the listener into an ocean of headbanging riffs and marching rhythms, and another memorable solo is featured as well. Track nine &#34;Victory Will Come&#34; is another epic thrasher that boasts more slicing riffage, poundingdrums, and more melodic soloing that speaks pure eargasm, and the final track &#34;Until Our Paths Cross Again&#34; is an amazingly epic slow, melodic paced album closer that is highlighted by stunning melodic guitar riffing, plus a blistering trash section around the 3 minute mark with a wild, ear shredding solo included before shifting back to the slower melodic tempo, and thus the song ends on a clean melodic guitar note.<br /><br />Overall, &#34;Phantom Antichrist&#34; is an amazingly brilliant and epic modern thrash metal masterpiece that will truly give you chills and blow your mind away at the same time with it's epic songwriting and technically proficient musicianship throughout. This album indeed proves that Kreator have once again proven that they are the epitome of professional and accomplished musicians in metal music today, and still have that edge after all these years as well. I strongly recommend &#34;Phantom Antichrist&#34; to all fans of Kreator and thrash metal alike. Trust me, this album won't disappoint you whatsoever...5 stars all the way...Buy it now!!!<br /><br />HORNS UP!!!lodic soloing that speaks pure eargasm, and the final track &#34;Until Our Paths Cross Again&#34; is an amazingly epic slow, melodic paced album closer that is highlighted by stunning melodic guitar riffing, plus a blistering trash section around the 3 minute mark with a wild, ear shredding solo included before shifting back to the slower melodic tempo, and thus the song ends on a clean melodic guitar note.

B00AMBH70S|3.0|I like Jeremy Renner, but this movie is far from any of the other Bourne movies. This is usually what happens when a franchise uses a different director.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the story, actors and the scenery!! One of the best mini series ! Can't wait for next season to come!
B00A0MJ9VY|5.0|My 3 year old granddaughter was glued to it! Good to see that the new generation appreciates the classic movies.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I wish I knew that they weren't going to make a third season. I really was just getting into the series! Now I have to wait til the next season of Downton Abby!!
B003VANOFY|4.0|I am so glad I bought this headset! Not having to worry about wires is a dream, and the way these ear pieces muffle sound so you can enjoy what you're listening to on the computer is fantastic! I haven't had any problems, after a month of buying and using them everyday. The only concern I have is how easily the ear pieces twist. For maximum comfort, I assume, but I make sure to always handle the headset VERY carefully, because I'm afraid one wrong move would snap them off.
B000GCFG7E|3.0|Fast paced story with characteristics typical of other Jack Reacher books. A bit of an abrupt ending but overall a satisfying read if you are a Reacher fan.
1878424319|4.0|If we could only agree and stick to it! I particularly like the Agreement about being &#34;Impeccable with your word&#34;. What we say reveals so much, and can cause so much good or so much damage. This should be required reading, starting in elementary school!
B000T060TG|5.0|Nobody is where they were when they first heard this music but most of it stands the test of time.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Finally, a book about cancer that is not about bravery, grace in the face of death, the valiant struggle. It is honest and unflinching :  Green artfully makes the point that pity is not what a dying person wants-- or needs.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Loved the story line and graphics in the movie.My daughter was glued to the movie and was so excited to watch it.
B001I9WK14|4.0|I have always liked U2, but oddly enough this did not make me like them more. It's a bit over the top for feeding the ego of the lead singer (yes, I know his name but don't want it to sound like I'm slamming him personally). Maybe I'm a bit jaded by what he's become since his & the band's more humble roots than this depiction of this &#34;capturing the middle of U2's rise to monster stardom&#34;. I remember this band from seeing them in 1984 at a very small venue, and obviously they were really big by the time they produced this... it is self indulgent for the band...<br /><br />All that being said, you can see how much they worked their tails off to continue getting to that monster stardom level.<br /><br />What I enjoyed the most was the insight to Larry & Adam (drummer & bassist), something you don't get to see much of since Bono & The Edge get most of the face time for the band in general (and seemingly in this video).<br /><br />Sound and song selection is cool. The BB King parts are pretty cool.<br /><br />Certainly worth watching.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|Thanks, I loved the movie too! I still read it even though I knew how it ended.  thanks, thanks, thanks.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|This movie was in perfect condition, delivered in a timely manner and terrific to watch.  The darkest and one of the best Harry Potter movies.
B00AYXNKIC|5.0|Great graphics, challenging courses and I love the ability to race against other riders best times.  A highly recommended game as far as I am concerned
0896760839|5.0|This is my favorite resource book. I love the history. The author goes into depth about a lot of details that other books pass-over. An invaluable resource.
B00ATP24SW|5.0|As a long-time Strato fan and a keyboardist I personally enjoyed this album. Before listening , it's best to shed any hopes or expectations of hearing a Timo Tolkki style release. Timo Tolkki is gone, and now the band is moving towards a more modern sounding power metal which I feel they have finally achieved with this album, after many years of experimentation. Unfortunately there are some Strato fans who are unwilling to accept this and will blindly hate any non-Tolkki release. However, I believe this album has the potential to impress even those fans.<br /><br />Some notes:<br /><br />The keyboards are a lot more electronic in this album than ever before, resulting in a sound more reminiscent of trance than your usual power metal album. As an electronic music fan I'm completely fine with this however, some die-hard metal heads may not feel this way. On the upside, the keyboards have been coupled with heavier and more progressive guitar riffs than witnessed on the past two albums. It's quite possible that this is the direction power metal is heading. I found the combination to work well, so it might be worth a shot (Hint: Unbreakable is FREE). Not all songs are gonna rub you the right way at first, I recommend you check out my song picks below first.<br /><br />My song picks: Unbreakable, Fantasy, Castles in Sky, Dragons, One Must Fall
0425252868|5.0|I am a big fan of WWII stories, fiction as well as non-fiction; and this is the best I have come across in many years.  The characters develop like those in a novel, and I really appreciate how the strengths of the men were drawn through the horrors of war.  The German was never a follower of Hitler or the Nazis, and his fight was for his country and his comrades.  He was taught early the &#34;code&#34; of the aviator and the respect for fellow pilots, regardless of the colors under which they flew.  The American was a product of all that is good about growing up in the United States.  Their meeting over the skies of western Europe provided the opportunity for both men to be their best.  My husband was a career fighter pilot in the USAF, and has told me about &#34;looking for a chute&#34; when any plane, even that of the enemy, was shot down in aerial combat.  The professional respect each pilot has for all others is something that was born with military aviation, and will exist as long as men ride their fabulous machines into the skies.  Much gratitude is owed to Adam Makos for finding Charlie and Franz and for bringing them and their wonderful story into the 21st Century.  This book is a great read!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Andrea Bocelli scores again! He has this way of making it feel like he is singing only to you,Wonderful!!!! I saw his show on PBS and he was doing all the songs from the CD,I am so glad I got this CD.
B001ZRYQSO|5.0|I just first heard of Leonard Cohen while watching a PBS channel and was mesmerized by his music...so had to check him out online.  I could listen to his music all day long.
B0083IQFD2|5.0|How did I not hear of Azealia Banks sooner? She's like the new Lil Kim- but better. Love her no-holds-barred style. She doesn't hold anything back, which is why her lyrics are probably not appropriate for innocent ears. Her lyrics are driven by powerhouse, amazing hooks that speak to the new trend in melding hip-hop/rap and electronica/dance, and will always make you wanna move. Highly recommended.
0393089134|4.0|On a nochy, Your Humble Narrator Alex, a malchick not poogly of Bog or millicents and govoreeting in nadsat speak, peets chai in Korova Milkbar and then like goolys around the streets with his droogs to crast deng and cars.

He even wants to sick when he slooshys Ludwig Von's Symphony No 9 and Wolfgang Amadeus's Symphony No 41.<br /><br />At one level, A Clockwork Orange is about the horror of teenage violence but at another, the dystopian novel is about the terror of a government trying to reengineer socially acceptable individuals. Anthony Burgess in the last chapter seems to imply that when teenagers grow up, the energy that drove them toward violence would propel them to construct society.  Whether the reader believes such a thesis, the novel would give food for thought.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Throughout the story you see and feel the writer grow, and what`s funny is you grow with him. This book gives a new perspective on life and really makes you think and consider life and the choices and crossroads it brings. Without a doubt, read this book you will not be disappointed.
B004W1GCQO|3.0|I was so looking forward to Upstairs Downstairs.  I was hoping it would be a continuation, somehow, of the 1970's production, but it fell short.  The characters, this time around, weren't as well-formed or likable.  If you never saw the original, then you may like this; just don't expect it to be as good.
0671027344|5.0|An Amazing book im really happy i bought it and i know that this a book ill pick up again again because i can relate to Charlie so much and its a very unique read
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|It was awesome I am a big fan of this author and I love all of his books. The part right before the ending was kinda slow but the ending kept you thinking once the book was over.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like it it is very entertaining but i think the prices need to go down a bit. The game is a little confusing cause when you want to know where to go i don't know where to go so you need to use words and pictures thank you for understanding.
B009YX02T8|5.0|Perfectly sets the tone for the series! Some of the artists and pieces are revisited but with a new twist on their significance to the climax.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I love love love this movie. I also bought it as a gift for my sister. It came quickly and was as described.

B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Gentle, humorous, awkward, touching... powerful<br /><br />It is not much more complicated than that.  This is not flashy Hollywood, not loud, overdone, in-your-face.<br /><br />This is a gentle and simple movie, describing heartfelt and awkward life challenges, with love and humor.<br /><br />Sit back, relax, enjoy.
B005NWHE0O|5.0|As a 13 time Birkie skier I enjoyed reading about someone else's experiences in the race that has become a family tradition.  The book was well written and offered interesting perspectives on the race and the training that is needed to compete at a high level.  I met the author at the packet pick up for the North End Classic and found him to be very engaging and personable.  Highly recommend.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|Was aways a Trekkie growing up....  Always was tired of seeing the network copies being &#34;cut up&#34; by commericlas and the bad picture from the days of TV antennas.....The HD version is excellent and makes you want to watch all of the old series again!

0307887448|5.0|I bought this book as part of a buy two get the third free promo - and this was the third, as I thought it might be amateurish or too referential  for people who were not gaming insiders. I was interested right on the first page and hooked by the first chapter.  There is a clear reason for the widespread focus on video games, TV, movies, and music GPS the eighties, and the author does a great job on explaining what the major references are. I really enjoyed the book and look forward to the author's next one.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie!  I grew up in the heyday of arcade games, so the nostalgia alone was worth the price of the rental!  The story was creative and the voice actors were spot on too.  I would say this would be a great movie for ages 9+.  I'm 34 and I'm going to buy this when I have the time.  Highly recommended!
B001KEHAI0|5.0|For years now, every Groundhog day we gather round our big screen with some popcorn, treats and drinks, and enjoy this fun romantic comedy together as a family. February second is a great excuse to watch this fun story once yearly. This could very well be our favorite movie for both the principle actors. Bill Murray's character starts off as a major jerk, and by some sort of mystic offering of the fates, is given a second chance in life to get himself right. His attraction to Andie MacDowell's darling character is a catalyst to smartening him up and his finally becoming a man worthy of her. There are many hilarious scenes, and it is a fun ride all the way through to the happy romantic ending. The bed and breakfast house in the town is pretty darn cute too.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Excellent. Enough said. This book makes you smile, cry, curse, believe, not believe and then believe again. Definitely a must read!!
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This is one of the most detailed, thoroughly-written treatments of the subject. It covers the biology, sociology, psychology, neuroscience, culture, and cognition of introverts using language tht is accessible and appealing to mainstream audiences, then gives practical tips for structuring relationships, school and work environments tht ensure that introverts (and extroverts) can thrive as children, adults, workers, and partners. Though Cain goes to the extreme of putting down the Western &#34;Extrovert Ideal&#34;, it gives us introverts (and extroverts as well) a common language and a framework to recognize and challenge it when the Ideal is intrinsically celebrated. I've recommended the book to several of my coworkers who've also found it informative and self-affirming.
B0064BWDRW|5.0|Great Harry Hole novel, loved it all, full of suspense and loads of twists and turns. I just hope it is not the last one

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I miss the 'Great' series which have come and gone in the past. Deadwood, Sopranos, Rome, The Wire, etc.. Nothing has filled the void till this masterful series.<br />Acting and role-casting is perfect.<br />Don't for one damn second think this is another stupid &#34;Zombie&#34; movie. If you are a well read college-educated normal joe like me you will see this for the well thought out masterpiece it is.<br />And it is addictive. I've been staying up at night till 4AM watching the first two complete seasons on Netflix, then I bought season 3 on Amazon. Now (March 10, 2013) I'm up to episode two of year three, so about 9 more episodes and I will be up to date.<br />I really, really hope they find a way to survive. The characters are developed to a point where you worry about them!<br />This series will remind  you to keep your guns clean...lol<br />Have fun friends, you are in for a treat.<br />BTW- this is my first experience buying a video product on Amazon, easy as pie. It winds up in your account as  your property instantly. No delay, no wait, just hit play and be prepared for a real experience.

B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|It was cool at first. I died after I got 4 pages. When I saw him, I was not scared at all.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this fresh adaptation of the much-loved novel for its unfamiliar settings and very strong cast. I expect that I'll watch it again.
B00340ESIS|5.0|Halfway through reading this book I wanted to see the principles in action, so I checked TV Guide and saw that Tina Fey and Amy Poehler's Baby Mama was about to come on. I had not seen it, but figured if anyone knows how to write a movie, it's the two of them. So I watched it, with the Beat Sheet page of Blake Snyder's Save the Cat pulled up on my Kindle. And you know what? It followed it EXACTLY.  When that movie ended they played the Tina Fey/Steve Carrel flick Date Night. I had seen that one, but I watched it again. It, too, unfolded exactly as Snyder suggests it should. I think this has forever altered how I watch movies, and I love that.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|After reading Marcus Luttrells book Lone Survivor I wanted to read more about success stories of bravery. American Sniper has a good pace, its engaging and inspiring. I strongly suggest it.
B004GFN11A|5.0|This blogging site is very user-friendly. It has lots of template options you can use to personalize your blog, and you can't beat the price.
0385523912|4.0|My finding and reading this book spurred from a curiosity about what the deal was in North Korea, having been embarrassingly ignorant to start.  This book is captivating.  It cuts straight to the heart of a culture unlike any other since World War II.  The characters of the book tell of their own realization of the truth about North Korea and communism.  Their stories are very well brought to print by Barbara Demick.  This biographical writing style about ordinary people with dynamic stories makes learning history and the basis of related current events fun and easy.  I will read other books by Demick.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Ok soo this game is super funny and awesome but whenever I make a world and work on it for like a month and it's on survival... it changes it to creative somehow and all my work that took soooooooooo long is gone and I have to do it all over again.. and I'm sick of it

B008YU0AOE|4.0|The last review obviously could not or did not turn their device sideways to see the scientific mode.  I have used this app on my iphone for years.  The advertisement is the only drawback I have.  I find it very useful when working physics and chemistry problems and calculating my grades in class.  I recommend this calculator for those needing a more advanced calculator for free.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Well-developed characters in a story that is so captivating that it is hard not to continue reading to the end In one sitting.  Dialogue between the poor caregiver and the wealthy quadriplegic is so realistic.  Interesting are the back stories of these two.  Moyes knows how to tell a good story. This book is highly recommended.
B006699DDE|4.0|Good to read on the Kindle - still captures fond memories of adventures stories when I was a young boy.
B008VBYN80|3.0|this game is just ok. they want way too many things that must be purchased. if u just play the game, it's boring. so if u want to spend Lot's of $ then choose this game. I thiink I'll be deleting it.
0765325950|4.0|This has left lots of questions unanswered and opened up so many more, I hope that someone continues this story.
B007PTJOV0|2.0|I hate it! it makes me re do levels that I have allready done and when I finaly get back to when it re started me, it re starts it again! other than that it is a pretty awesome game! it keeps me busy and it is very iddictive. but unless you want to work hard and have to do all of it over again,I do not recomend getting this game

B001NLL93W|5.0|I thought this book was  awesome and I really like it. My favorite character was Jace and Sebastian, they were  total badasses
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I use Microsoft office a great deal and it was a big help finding this app to use on my Kindle Fire. The files are easily transported between my PC and my Kindle with no loss of functionally.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|this is a good book. online buy makes it so much convenient, this is my first online book. I like the experience.
B008B3H4VQ|3.0|No where near as good as they used to be. Trying to be a fan still. Some songs were good but others I couldn't stand.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|Just really started collecting blu ray movies and i could not pass this one up especially for the sale price
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is a fun game. It makes time fly when you are playing it. If you don't have this game you must me really board!
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Compelling story line, plenty of action. Current edition (my opinion), has a few holes in the dialog.<br />Certain events seem missing but still a great series.  Can't wait for the next book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|In all honesty I cried my eyes out because of this novel. Simply beautiful. Do yourself a favor and read it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers it's so fun great graphics I love the characters and the patterns I memorized most of them.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Very nice to have accurate numeric assessments about the state of the battery using the free app.  It gives details in terms of time using various applications that consume the battery energy stores.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game seem to be the goto game for the boys when the grab the tablet and pay it for hours
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Love these mystery games, good puzzles!! Not so difficult that you can't complete. Good for a rainy or lazy afternoon ..
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|This game is dumb!  I don't get how to play it and of course there are no instructions!  Waste of time.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|David Attenborough narrates this one, which, along with the excellent footage, means it's good.  It is definitely worth the money.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was even better than the first one. It was full of suspense and it made me laugh one second and cry the next.
B003V5ED7W|3.0|We enjoyed the movie and recommend watching it. However the sound would go out for a few seconds every 5 minutes or so. we have had this problem when streaming other Amazon movies. Amazon will need to work on this if they are going to seriously compete with other online streaming services.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great horse game for everyone. Works perfect on my kindle fire and my friends ipad. Best part is the game lets you actually PLAY instead of severly limiting you right out of the gate (AKA it does not force you into buying in-game currency.) Been playing for a few days and I have no complaints! Added bonus: The visuals are quite nice, not cartoony or exaggerated.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Couldn't ask for a better app. And got this for free back in the day as the free app of the day. But I would pay for this in a heartbeat.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|an amazing game; the graphics are spectacular and the game play keeps you in suspence. Can't get over how wonderful this is.
B008YKGQR4|3.0|Sometimes the response time is slow when changing screens. Overall I like it better then the regular app. It's okay.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|If you are a fan of the Alien, this is a must have. The documentaries for all the movies are collected here. Days worth of extras that will keep you busy. In-depth interviews that give you a greater knowledge and view of the movies and what it took to make them.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Read this book in 2 days.  This book had me laughing and crying.  Pat Peoples enters you heart and you will never forget him.  Excellent read.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Love it!  Can be time consuming but is lots of fun.  Would recommend to people of all ages.  Excellent game.
B004S3MB2U|4.0|I only gave four stars because I believe there is always room for improvement, but I feel that this calculator has all the tools you would one in one application. I would recommend it.<br />I can't compare to many others that are probably out there, but if you get a chance to try, it's worth it.<br />You can easily switch between types of functions like financial, scientific, programming, etc... and it has documentation too.<br />Very nice job.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|You cn build freely as you want.  You can win by using different strategy to achieve a win.  lot of fun.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Love this app. Very convenient across platforms. Everything updates automatically - fabulous!  I have been using this app for several years and it is have never been disappointed.  Go go go go get it!
B00A757EFW|4.0|Remember when you put a quarter in the machine to play Pac-man, them you will reminisce moments from your youth.
B007L96SI6|5.0|I choose this rating because I would love anything Haley Reinhart sings. Simply put I love, love, love the quality of her voice! But truly I wish she would put out a CD of familier pop songs old and new. Mmmmm  with her rich sultry voice I could just imagine her singing a medley of familier, bluesy, jazzy tunes. I would buy it in a heart beat! With all my heart I pray the music industry continues to support her endeavors.
B004GYY714|4.0|App allows me to listen to my favorite radio show.  Easy to use and reliable, streaming is smooth with little or no lapse in time.
B00BHMF578|4.0|I thought this was a very good movie. And I have always liked movies based on true stories. Though I believe that it was done well, I don't believe it should have grabbed the Oscar for best picture. There was at least one that was done better.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great love story.  The end of this book touch's my heart.  I also love a man who lost his wife.  At book
B0095P33IW|4.0|Lots of good action and humor considering that it is the origin story. Not the best Marvel movie out there. Perhaps, not even close. But it was necessary as a precursor to the Avengers movie.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Works fine on my kindle. Story is Very short  but for less than a dollar I can't really complain too much. 4stars because of it's length.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show, great characters, great story.  AMC seems to be making  all the great new shows.  Rick is a badass!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had no idea it would end the way it did it was an intense book and I'm still going thru things in my own mind about the book
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|This is a really good movie. I felt the the same feelings as the characters in this movie as they were going to the airport.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|really good case for the price. perfect thickness and provides decent protection and i can actually see my iPhone! :)
B007QPFGJW|5.0|Harry Hole returns from Asia to save his almost step-son Oleg.from a murder charge. Intrigue,treacheryand love-erotic and filial,cause everyone to lose sight of the obvious. . A great continuing character is challenged again. Excellent tome.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was great to me it seemed like a love story but a weird one. The love Peeta and Katniss share is so confusing but interesting. Then how the book ended just makes you want to read catching fire.!!!!!!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book was enthralling from start to finish, I couldn't stand putting it down. It is written in such a unique style, beautifully done. I couldn't recommend it more.
0316228532|5.0|This book carries a literary goddess. Rowling writes to form characters first story later. I have loved every chapter of this book. Her understanding of social mishaps and tense moments of all age groups amazes me. A realists novel.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The script was very well written. I definitely recommend it. Now go make some popcorn and take a seat!
B007N8RULO|4.0|I'm a spider fan and this is a nice version of the game.  It allows backing up without restriction (as near as I can tell).  It is easy enough to play on a phone, even with fat fingers.
B00280LYIC|4.0|Love the story.  Can't put the book down.  The story is very well written and the character interactions make it that much more interesting. I'm off to read the next one!
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|From the point of view of a young boy whose parents we know will be robbing a bank, we experience the life leading up to and from the actual deed.<br />I was riveted most of the way and just when I began to be tired of the pre-robbery the events changed to the afterward.<br /><br />It was a particularly well written book and different from the usual modern novel.<br />i must admit to be a fan of Richard Ford and have enjoyed his other books as well.
B00821PCJS|2.0|Think Battlestar Galactica but on land, unexciting and made by Spielberg.  When do the furry creatures show up to save us from the mean machines?
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|This movie is absolutely horrible.  Seeing the previews I was excited but at 120 minutes I was asking myself why I started watching this mess of a movie.  It is very slow, long and with no redeeming qualities I could find.  What a waste of acting talent and that is the \\"true true\\".
B006ZNRD06|4.0|I only had this a week, but like the many features. No problem recognizing and playing all my various video formats.
B005IA9JZO|5.0|Thought I had this in my collection.  My grandson is in love with this movie and had to have it.  Great quality.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This is the standard for PDF. A must have for reading documents. Always works well and automatically. You need this.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|Wanted this movie to complete series.  Great quality of picture and sound.  Love the movie.  Was on sale so price was well worth it and speedy delivery.
B008K93302|2.0|It recognizes the content in the Kindle Fire,  but it does not play all the formats. It is also glitchy in its fwd and replay of videos.
B000002KIE|5.0|I bought this as a gift so am not sure about the product.  My brother loved it so it must be good.  Have heard no complaints.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This is my first read in the Nicholas Sparks collection. It was very good. The story kept me in suspense and was a page turner. I'm the type if reader who needs a story line to keep me interested and this book did the job.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Great cd of classes Pink Floyd.  Excellent song choice and sound quality.  A must for fans.  Price made it a great choice,
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|IT was wonderful. SO moving. Because I served in the 379th Bomb Wing, for 7 years and served in England for 6 years it was extra meaningful. This book was beautifully written.  I challenge anyone to read this book without shedding some tears.A Higher Call will be remembered as one of the greatest true stories of the second world war.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|Not sure why all the great reviews. The graphics are pretty bad and the controls are quite difficult on the Kindle Fire.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The story keeps you interested from the start.<br /><br />I was immediately gripped by the characters which were developed so well, I had to know more about their stories.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Its addicting. And a big cycle cuz your goal is to get coins just so you can drop them back down.... to get even more coins.... just to drop them again. lol. its pointless fun! (:
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun when your bored or just lazy to move, so get it now.....DOWNLOAD this FREAKIN game now........have you done it?..<br />...I am watching you.... DOWNLOAD IT NOW!!!!-
B001NHNG64|4.0|All of the Jack Reacher series are spellbinding. Can't believe they selected Tom Cruise to play Jack Reacher in the movie release. Read the book you'll agree with me!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is truly the best of the series a shame it had to end with a cliffhanger. I RECOMMEND YOU READING IT
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|it is fun but needs more time. some missions are just to hard but if you like this games that are hard I recommend this game fore you.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Glad I didn't pay too much for this. It would have to be the most boring and repetetive book I have ever read...Don't get what all the hype is about.....
0062238868|5.0|What a fascinating book.  It is so sad that such a creative and interesting young man was taken at so young an age.  Bless his family.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|About 5 songs in here were really great, and the rest was pretty good as well.  Catchy little pop tunes!
B003F3NDP8|5.0|Love this show! I like spending some time watching it over and over, I have all seasons now, can't wait till my next long weekend to start from season 1.
B008ZCWFEE|5.0|All 4 of us have been playing this and everyone loves it!  Starts out very game-like, with the basics of algebra, and eventually moves into letters/numbers and equations.  Just keep to the rules of the &#34;game&#34; and algebra finally makes sense!  9 year old loved this!
B0053TMP24|5.0|Loved it! It was pretty long, but liked the details and the pace of the story was perfect. One of my favorite parts was the battle with polybotes.
B001G70M6S|5.0|Works as good or better than the original later Polaroid film, It gives great results at a good price whether used in professional backs or the older Polaroid cameras!
B005CMSDLE|5.0|I'm not a fan of most action movies. I saw Hanna in the theater after I heard some buzz about it and I was blown away. Don't read too much about the plot if you haven't seen it BUT now that I own it and have seen it multiple times, I still find the plot captivating. I love the way the movie is edited. Not a lot of special features on the disc, but that's to be expected with a movie like this that didn't get a huge box office.
B00632HWOG|4.0|I quite like this app. It works well on my tablet. I do wish it would show on home screen how many new emails if any. Seems I click on icon too often.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love tbis game. its very realistic. and I'm hooked.  you will really enjoy. it its a good.  boredom buster.
B00942X8PY|5.0|This is a very addicting game. It is fun an  passes time quickly. A must have game. My grandmother and I love this game.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Action pack and very good movie  for the family. I love this movie. you should watch this movie and enjoy with popcorn or fried chicken.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This was a gift for a friend and she enjoyed the movie quite a bit. She is a huge Johnny Depp fan.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|I wanted a good show and I found this show and I was super not disappointed.  This show is pretty good and DOESNT AFRAID OF ANYTHING!!!
B004A8ZWSS|5.0|This movie was a gift for a friend who is a huge Johnny Depp fan - she loved the movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Sometimes in trilogies it's more hype but not with this book you just want to keep reading I wish she would write another book love love this characters
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Loved this book and the whole series.  I liked having the guys pov for a romnov.  Slightly twilightish but I didn't mind. As the series continues the characters/plot develops in a good way. Recommend.
B006LSZECO|2.0|After reading reviews rating this as a great book, I purchased it.<br />I found the both the main characters unlikeable, and couldn't relate to,<br />or care about either of them.  The book gave me &#34;the creeps&#34; to think<br />that people are actually so manipulative.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The game itself is great and yes, limited as one would expect a portable game to be, but still the same minecraft. I wish it would have better explained that the creative and survival mode were not interchangeable on the same map. I'm not a huge fan of the movement controls only because I always seem to jump off things even with a raised platform infront. I love the new seperatoon of the craftbox to the stone cutter. I enjoy the different seeds and the quality for a pocket edition.
1475143389|5.0|This is the book any beginner or expert needs. It might not show u how to get jacked for Mr. Olympia, but your body will transform if u follow his workouts and suggestions.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a good game I really like to play this game it keep me occiped I work two jobs and it is nice to sit down and play a game
B009O07NDY|5.0|This score fits nicely in the world created by Tolkien and Jackson. There are many new themes and some returning favorites.
B008FYZIVY|3.0|I am not certain about this set.  Felt there were things missing.  Perhaps uk edition  is a great deal different than Us.<br />Would like that explained with ad.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Can't say I enjoyed any TV series more.  Did a marathon viewing because I couldn't make myself leave my chair while there were still episodes to watch.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I or me I am just a kid! I got this for my dad. He (LOVES )<br /> games like this. So he always plays it. You no I mean you should try 'n'buy!
B0046ECFRM|4.0|It was a good book. Not quite what I had expected but good non the less. I would recommend it to others.
B00942V1J4|5.0|Great movie and books I must have all !! I will watch these forever and ever !! They are very intriguing and will keep you watching .
B007QDNKQA|1.0|i was not thrilled with it  it was a little confusing for me  could not fully follow it to much to quick
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I use this app all the time. I love the app I love the web site. I would recommend this app to anyone who uses ebay.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The book is a bit raunchy but it has a good story that keeps your attention and leaves you wanting to read more
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is a nice app too have. It makes going too your e -mail easy. Which is great because I do not use yahoo now that they have changed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Out of the 3 books I found that Catching Fire was probably my favorite, there was a lot of action and I could not put the book down.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The end to the trilogy is a great ending. The loss suffered and heartbreak that comes from the war will never fully be healed but the lessons learned are incredible.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|After reading book 1 and 2, I couldn't wait to read Mockingjay but I found myself disappointed at the result
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Kept me glued to the story and I will definitely read other Books by this Author.  Enjoy his work very much.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Like the first there was plenty of action and once again it moved very fast.  It was however a little predictable as we were set to expect the final outcome. I will soon read the third book.
B00942X8PY|3.0|its a fun game that tests your spacial skills pretty good.  (whatever that means) the music is pretty good. ;D
B004J4WLB4|5.0|As a gardener, I found this novel relatable. As a mother , I found it heart wrenching. It is hard to believe that it is the author's first novel. I am sorry I have finished it. I enjoyed the characters and would like to continue to know them.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|I watched the pilot episode.<br />It was pretty cool.<br />Looking forward to the subsequent episodes.<br />Hope they don't screw up.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I couldn't put it down. I understand now why everyone loves the book. I am only sorry that I hadn't read it sooner.
B002FOQY2M|5.0|They have a unique sound and are very easy to listen to. I have their other CD as well and highly recommend it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book is full of turns, heart melting moments, and moments that will make you angry. Great book that keeps you going to the next page to find out what happened
B0010SKSTO|5.0|This is a very clear, concise and common sense approach to body language. I am a psychiatrist and I found the book very useful. I would recommend it as textbook for the PGY 1s
0425252868|5.0|I first read this book when it was loaned to me by a friend. I just couldn't put it down until I had finished it.<br />I was so enamoured with it that I had to purchase a copy for my own library of WWII books.<br />This book is really different as it views the war from the American and German points of view.<br /> Whereas the fighter pilots in the Battle of Britain were seen as heroes,as they truly were, (I was fourteen years old and evacuated from Portsmouth to Salisbury at the time), the German fighter pilots at the end of the war were looked down upon as having let the country down.<br />This tale of one German fighter pilot who escorted a badly shot up B-17 through a heavily defended coastal area so that it made it home safely over the North Sea, is truly amazing.<br />Remarkably, both pilots are re-united many years later,after the war, and the German pilot is introduced to the families of the American crew that he saved from certain death.<br />It really is a remarkable book and would be a great addition to anyone's library.
B0055SWM08|5.0|What an amazingly entertaining game, perfectly executed. Beautiful yet simple graphic and a truly zen sound track which complements the very real brain bending you will be doing to complete many of these puzzles (?) mazes (?).....whatever they are ...awesome is in there too.Nice work and kudos to &quot;fallen tree games &quot;.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This seems like a fun game but the help section is pretty vague and doesn't explain much on how to navigate the game and what exactly you have to do achieve the goals in the game
B003O86FMW|1.0|Most amazing book<br />People really need to read I......I was at the edge of my seat. I really enjoyed it.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|THIS WAS A  GIFT  FOR CHRISTMAS . WE DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD ARRIVE FOR CHRISTMAS BUT A WAS HERE IN TIME. FANTASTIC! IT MADE AYOUNG MAN VERY HAPPY!!! THANKS
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Would have given 5 stars if it stayed a bit truer to the facts, especially in the final scenes, but it was really good and kept me on the edge of my seat.
B008NW67E0|3.0|OK
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|For some reason I saw this book several times and never got it because I give in to a good cover (dont really like this cover) and a summary that sounds interesting. The only reason I decided to give it a try was the reviews and I am glad I went by them and downloaded the book. This book kept me on the edge of my seat. So many twists and turns. I immediately told a friend about it and she read it in less than 2 days like I did. I just couldn't put it down.
B005URRCUY|5.0|FANTASTIC AS USUAL! BLACK KEYS ARE THE BST  AND THIS IS ANOTHER WELL RECIEVED CD. I HAVE TOLD MY FRIENDS ABOUT THIS ONE, ALSO.
B00BLGZDVS|2.0|I like Philip Seymour Hoffman, so I was hopeful about this movie, in spite of its bad reviews. It was just too strange to be enjoyable.
6302212529|5.0|We like it because it is a great original classic.  We replaced the same move we had loved and lost.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Absolutely positively the most awesome game ever I have so many characters you can to all you have to do is buy it its so much more fun than temple run.
B000BF0D9M|5.0|I love this 2 set CD.  Almost all of the tracks are worth listening to.  Puts me in the right frame of mind.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Totally engrossing read.  The parallels between this and what's happening in the U.S. today are enough to make one look for a place to hide from the 'Capital'.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Impactful actors/actresses. This may not follow history exactly, but still most intriguing. Can't wait to watch all of the seasons.
B000I186FW|5.0|this has been a favorite movie of mine for several years; Amazon had a great price and I bought it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Can personality traits, like moodiness and violent behaviours, be inherited genetically, as are physical traits like hair and eye colour?  And can these also skip a generation in the same manner?  Does a mother's intuition trump what appears to be flimsy evidence against her son?  Can a father's lifelong mission to build a life that does not reflect nor even acknowledge his own father's violent life succeed?  How far should parents be willing to go when accepting the moodiness/non-responsiveness/aloneness of their teenagers?  When is it no longer &#34;normal teenage behaviour?&#34;<br />These are some of the questions author Landay weaves into his fascinating tale of murder in a small town.  Alas, and understandably so, these are unanswerable questions.  However, Landay's story is so poignantly put together that I have forgiven him for, what I feel is, an unsatisfying ending, and may even re-read the novel--something I do not habitually do--at some time in the future.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Read this now.  Seriously, stop reading reviews and buy this book.  Make sure you have a few hours to set aside because you'll have a hard time putting it down.  Amazing book, and I can't wait to read more of her stuff!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|If you are a horse lover..you will love this game..the action is truly real looking. I just wish I could earn gems a little faster for all the cool stuff for &quot;my horses&quot;
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|Love this album.  I listen to it a lot, and I feel like I hear something new each time.  The songs with Pink and Cee-Lo are particular favorites, but the album is great top to bottom.
B003L77TZI|5.0|Teenage Dream<br />It is my dream. I love every song in it.<br />Teenage Dream<br />Teenage Dream<br />Teenage Dream<br />Teenage Dream
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is a good game.  It is great for eye-hand coordination.  And if you can't take care of your horse for a couple of days he won't die.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|This is a great action movie with that classic Bond excitement and humor. Microwave some popcorn, put on your PJs and enjoy 2 fast hours of fun!

B00499NHLC|5.0|every frame is a work of art. the script is great and the acting is spot on. only complaint is there are only 3 episodes per season.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Enough Romance and mystery to keep my attention.  Couldn't put the book down.  I will probably read it again at a later date.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another great book that takes you through every emotion at some point! Hard to stop reading and really gives reality to spousal abuse.

B00AFROVQC|3.0|Not the most well written series if you are adult, but engaging, mindless fun with good charCter development and an engaging story. Fun, easy read.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love to work puzzles. This is a good way to get my puzzle fix without having a card table up for weeks.
B002R2B6NE|5.0|Such a great movie, even after all these years. Highly recommended for suspense lovers.  Always an amazing actress, and even more so in this movie.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game!  It's very addicting. It makes the time go by so fast...1 hour feels like 10 min. It's my kind of game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wow, I love this game. I already have Tricky, Ninja, and Lucy. Anyone should get this game. I garente it.
B00ADW4I9O|5.0|I had been looking for the Conan soundtrack for some time. When I found this 3 cd complete score I was very pleased, not only did it have the original soundtrack version, but it also includes the songs that were missing from the original soundtrack, plus a lot more.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This is a beautiful story...amazing imagery with a story that is difficult to put down. I highly recommend - it will be a book that you read multiple times.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|ITS a great game nothing pops up on anything maybe kids can even play it its not that scary really.
B0040E42JC|5.0|...and they got better, mono was the only way to do them justice ... masterpiece rating for this Sgt Pepper Pt 2
1936608898|5.0|This book changed my life. I'm not even kidding... as I read it, so many things started making sense.. I had my gallbladder removed almost two years ago and I have struggled pretty much NONSTOP with digestion issues... everything from consistent diarrhea to stomach pain and heart burn... three days after cutting out all the food I shouldn't be eating, and NO MORE ISSUES! I feel normal again! not to mention I have been losing weigh steadily without depriving myself or feeling like I'm on a diet.. I have been lending this book to friends and telling everyone to check it out... If you are thinking about reading, just do yourself a favor and check it out! You will not regret it!!
B005HSG3U6|5.0|I purchased this case for my grandson because of its reasonable price.  He tells me that it's just what he wanted so I guess you could say the purchase was a success.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a great movie, it was funny, very entertaining and the cast was excellent.  I'm an avid movie goer and really enjoyed this movie.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Mom's favorite channel in the weather channel so it's easier to get the information on the Kindle than on my small smart phone.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Great game! Covers many levels of expertise.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It really works your mind and makes you think outside the box.  Excellent training for the brain and lots of fun on top of that.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love the whole series!!  Once I got hooked, I had to watch all the versions of Season 1 and 2.  Hope this series goes on for a long time. I watch the series while on my treadmill. Gee, I can imagine all the weight I am going to lose. LOL..
B008FPOIT6|3.0|A strange tale, easy to read and hard to believe.  The writing is excellent, the character development well done and pace fast enough to make the reading feel effortless. No ploughing through wordiness or long winded descriptions.  Simply fun to read.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The saga continues in superb style with all the expectations for genteel drama being met. Well worth the cost of admission.
B000JQUHLM|5.0|I didn't realize Pollyanna had a sequel, but it does and i liked it. I'm glad Amazon offers it. I enjoyed reading more about her, especially as a grown up young woman.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This app is a very handy tool for your phone.  I've used it several times and it works great and is packed with any type of information you might need.  I highly recommend this app!!
B009FZFONO|5.0|Amazon is just about the only place to see the last few episodes of Season 3.  If you can get it somewhere else, than try that 1st because the playback quality for Amazon is poor.  Lots of starts and stops and freezes.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Used this app to list items for sale right from my iPhone and it worked great!! I highly recommend this app!!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This is my favorite app on my kindle fire. But.... it is super scary.  The point of the game is really easy. All you have to do is find the 8/8 pages before slenderman gets you. If you like fun, scary games,  I highly reccomend this game.
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|Fun game that keeps you on your toes the entire time.  Takes some figuring out but once you win that first game it becomes much more enjoyable.  Don't give up right away!
0783225792|5.0|This is one of my all time great Movies, I enjoy the story about how Las Vegas has grown from the 1950 to what it is like in 2013. There are some bloody scenes in the movie but that is how it was, and is today just not as often. Robert De Niro, Sharon Stone, Joe Pesci are outstanding in the movie.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great book.  I thought it was going to be sad --- dogs and all.  It was a great story of determination and fortitude.  Good read.
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|Talk about a man with an obsession for perfection.  He takes it to not to just another level but several levels above! The story about his quest in making the perfect sushi is very intriguing. The step by step and daily efforts he puts into his art and the teachings to his sons and students are fun to watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The best game in the world. I got a kindle at Christmas 2012 and never was I off it. Subway Surfers was the first game I got on it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. The only thing that could make it better is a way to transfer one game to a different device. Other than that it is perfect.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My niece loves this game something she can always play graphics are nice sometimes takes a while to load and hate all the advertising
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Great app. The alarm is easy to set and always goes off on time. I like that it shows you the current temp outside in your area.
B006TJXZ30|4.0|this app has made access to my hotmail account (and my wifes as well) very easy. A novice on the Kindle Fire, I am happy it works so easily.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|This pro battery app is beautiful in its simplicity. I originally purchased it out of curiosity. We use a campervan with occasional limited opportunities to recharge. No worries now. I know precisely how many hours available for simple reading or other energy hungry apps. Thanks team. Your apps have cured this former technophobe :)
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Was alerted to this wonderful series early in the second season and bought this set to bring myself up-to-date before the 3rd season began. Great product at a great price.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|It is fun but it can be addicting. I like it but it could use more work. I would recommend it.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|The transition from Ender to Speaker is seamless and profound at the same time. Where the next book will go is unpredictable from here.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is good version of Angry bird. I liked it and play everyday of my life.That is it....blah blah.<br />w
B006QF5CU6|5.0|This is just a fun action movie.  There aren't many movies that I watch more than once... and I cannot tell you how many times I've watched this one... more than a dozen I'm sure!  Probably 2X a year.  It's right up there with True Lies!  Good Clean shoot em up movie!
B008LFY6NI|1.0|After the purchase I realize this game isn't worth  the money it has charged. I wish to return it, but have no know how to do it.
0071762345|5.0|I use social media personally and also at work.  When I started reading Likeable Social Media, I was so excited to learn more about social media.  Usually I start reading books and just don't finish them, but Dave's book I finished in 3 days. It was an eye opener for me.  \\"Likeable Social Media\\" made me realize how many mistakes I had made. If you have a business and you are using social media you must read this book.  From now on everyone in our company who posts on our company Facebook, Twitter or Pinterest has to read this book first.  Thank you, Dave, for sharing this valuable information with us.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I highly recommend this game and is perfect for any pony fan!! :-)  my favorite game!! A great game all in all!!
B0021L9ME6|1.0|A cinematic bowel movement. Halle Berry should be forced to return her Oscar after this atrocity! Horrible effects, acting, editing, screenplay, you name it, it's bad. Changing my cats overfull litter box was a more rewarding experiance!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its awesome I play it all the time I think I'm addicted<br />I play this game slot my sister introduced me to this game and. She is also addicted we both love the game and both highly recommend this game.
B003Y059EK|4.0|Return to Oz is considered to be so dark and creepy that late critic Gene Siskel loathed it and called it one of the worst of 1985. Critics such as Siskel were offended by Dorothy being taken for shock therapy by her Aunt as an attempt to make her stop talking about Oz. While you have an evil witch who collects heads of beautiful women, as if they are nice wardrobes.<br />  When I was little, even my mom thought the film was evil lol, but I always saw it as an imaginative and well made fantasy and I stick by that today. Return to Oz is the only Oz film that I would rank highly next to the 1939 original.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|great service and a good product. i would buy again if needed. the quality is what i expected for the price.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|What's not to love?  Challenging time waster that is bound to make you smile!  Those pigs & monkeys couldn't be more annoying, in a fun way.
B008O9V4C2|3.0|I've got all the previous Fagen solo albums (in surround sound, of course) and this is the only one that's ever bored me.  I've tried to give it several listens before writing this but nothing's changed yet.
B001AVCFK6|3.0|Abrams' Star Trek is easily the most polished Star Trek movie, but it also lacks something essential about Trek. Most Trek movies are about moral or philosophical dilemmas. Even the worst of Trek had presented interesting questions. By contrast, Abrams' Trek is a fun adventure, but very shallow. There are lots of space battles and action scenes and character development, but not much else.<br /><br />There are also a lot of logical inconsistencies in the plot, most notably that Kirk is made captain just a few days after graduating Starfleet academy! The whole plot centers around yet another alien attempt to destroy Earth. I suspect most of those plot contrivances are courtesy of Damon Lindelof.<br /><br />It's a fun ride, but not a very fulfilling one. It's definitely geared more towards mass audiences rather than Trek fans. Overall, 3.5 stars.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  This had been on my 'must read' list for some time.  With the death of Mr. Kyle, it moved to #1 of my list.  I found the experiences related in his stories, both in combat and back home, fall right in line with those of friends who are serving, or have served.  While the title of this book tells of Mr. Kyle's mark in history, this is not a &#34;hey, look at me, I'm the best!&#34;, instead, it is his story, what combat is like, the type of guys that make up the teams, how they relate with the other services, and the struggles that trying to have a family while also serving our country can bring.  While Mr. Kyle's death did not happen while serving, it is still a huge loss for so many lives he has impacted, and so many his efforts after he left the service will continue to help.
B004TI5N38|4.0|It was an easy read - good plot and characters. I have purchased several of Baldacci's recently and this was my favorite.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|great service and a good product. i would buy again if needed. the quality is what i expected for the price.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|This is fun. Has other instruments but if it's possible to play more than 1 at a time, I haven't figured it out yet.  Has a small library of included tunes.  Clever app.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Lots of fun in this time travel fantasy.  Especially nostalgic for those of us who lived through the 50's and 60's.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|Great visuals & cinematography in continuation of MI franchise. If your a fan of this action genre, solid choice. Enjoyed it.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|We pre-ordered this DVD and it finally arrived.  This movie was the BEST movie I Have seen in years.  Phillipe and Driss friendship that evolves is remarkable. The story line was passionate, humourous and left me never wanting the movie to end.  I woke the next day wanting to watch it again.  I was a bit disappointed there were sub-titles but in the end I felt it actually made the movie more<br />appealing.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who appreciates a true story based on cruel and loving honesty in the world<br />of an invalid.  The true essence was captured beautifully in this epic story.  You won't be disappointed.
B006VFLIYK|2.0|I normally like Baldacci books, but it took me forever to get through this book.  I thought it was slow and and unbelievable.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|Usually don't like to play sudoku without an actual book/pencil/eraser. LOVE this app! So addicting [as sudoku always is, anyway].
B006LSZECO|5.0|This boolk was recommended to me by several friends.  The ending was a real shocker!  Can't wait to read more of Gillian Flynn's books.
030758836X|4.0|This book was recommended by a good friend so I picked it up. There are some great laugh out loud moments, some really cringe making moments, and some nice twists and turns that keep the read lively. It was also interesting to alternately like and dislike the characters at every turn of the page. Good entertainment.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love it. Easy to use and loads quickly. I was able to see alerts from my phone when dangerouse wheather was coming to my area when the power was out. Great tool to have on your phone.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|The graphics are fun, just like at an old fashion carnival. I love playing this game because I can play at my own pace. No pressure. I am free to take my time and strategize coin drops. the ads are not as intrusive as most free games.<br />Its delightful and exciting when you earn a coin shower.
030758836X|1.0|My feeling was this book was written to make money by using coarse vulagr language through out, by using explicit sex scenes, and totally unlikable characters.  I learned nothing from reading it,.  It was not enjoyable in any way.  There was no real &#34;plot twist&#34; and I lost both time spent reading it and money spent buying it.  When our club finished discussing this book,, I promptly threw it in the trash bin.  It was at home there!
B0081KZ20E|5.0|In my opinion, Forsyth's work compares to only John LeCarre.  The movie version is also an excellent rendition of the book.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|What a marvelous story and movie of a true story! And now that he was on the winning side in the super bowl, it makes it even better!
B00B2DSIAI|4.0|Yet another finely crafted Pixar/Disney product.  Fun story line, great character development, the occasional snarky line meant for grownups.  The &#34;scibugs&#34; are a little intense for very small children, but most little kids can handle them.
B002C949KE|5.0|This book guaranteed to cover multiple topics deeply relevant to your life.  On at least three occasions as I progressed through the book, incidents in my immediate existence verified or served relevance to Dr. Ariely's experiments and observations.  I expect the light shed on our collective irrationality to prove valuable in many future transactions in my personal and professional life.<br /><br />And it's a fun read, too.
1616550414|5.0|Everything made sense after getting this book. I just absolutely love the pictures, too. Hopefully they'll still make games because this is by far my most favorite game series (:
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Let me say I have read numerous SEAL themed books. Most claiming to be written by real operators about non fiction events and many that were pure fiction. Some written by legendary operators from this branch of service. This is definitely the best done and most well written. No ax to grind, not about one upmanship or obnoxious braggadocio. This is a great page turning thriller based on real events that show cases the story, not the author. Kudos.
B005HJWWW8|4.0|I used this to amplify the headphone jack of a Nook tablet so it played back louder in my car using the line-in input of my car's sound system. Without the amplifier, sound from the Nook was not loud enough on the car's speakers even at maximum volume on both the Nook and the car audio. With the amplifier, I had plenty of volume and kept the car audio volume at 60%.<br /><br />So it did exactly what I wanted it to do.<br /><br />One complaint: I left it on and plugged in by mistake and it depleted the whole battery... an auto shutoff would be nice, and that's the only reason I knocked off a star.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Loved that little English cottage even though it was just staged and not a real cottage! I bought several for gifts at Christmas.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|BluRay does this series justice,  the details of the clothes and home really stand out.<br />The story and characters cannot be improved upon, except the series does take a few soap opera like turns.
B005QMOZOO|1.0|I did not care much for this book. I was expecting much more. The characters fell flat, which was surprising given the source material. It felt more like fan fiction than the work of a professional writer.
0981951244|5.0|the book is an awesome personal development book!! i highly reccommend this book to everyone looking to expand their knowledge, themselves and their business!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Lots of twists and turns.  Really kept me guessing. Not what I would call \\"great literature\\", but definitely thrilling and an excellent character study.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a awesome game I recommend it for people who like temple run and ala watch out for those booby traps
0446310786|5.0|This is one of the all-time great books of American literature.  If you read it as a kid, read it again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Writing and story-telling was superb.<br /><br />Thank you, Mr Howey, for the adventure.  I look forward to reading more of your books.<br /><br />Jeff
0345803485|4.0|I enjoyed Shades, but not for the sex. Considering the BDSM angle, I expected the sex to be hot. I can’t put my finger on why exactly, but it just wasn’t. And certain phrases (“It was a heady combination” for example) were overused so that eventually they didn’t have much impact.<br /><br />But from the standpoint of character development - did the character change because of the events of the book? - Shades delivers.<br />The character of Christian Grey is fascinating, and not just because he has a kinky side. His need for control and power… the hints of his childhood… all great stuff. My only complaint: he’s relentlessly good at everything he does. If we use my evaluation of “did he change through the course of the story?” the answer is a resounding YES (“Another first, Ms. Steele”).<br /><br />Anastasia (sometimes accused of being too “simple”) is young and naïve at the start. But she’s got a quick mind and quick wit that makes her easy to like. Does she change? Certainly - especially at the very end. I don’t want to give it away, but eventually Anastasia finds the courage to make a difficult decision. I found myself admiring her and cheering her on.
1576754227|5.0|this book it very insightful. also a very great personal development book. i highly reccommend for anyone wanting to better themselves. go farther in their business. looking to help themselves in time management and organization.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so much better than any other kindle or computer game I have ever played in my life. its like living a whole new life except in minecraft
B00ATSBIIG|4.0|very nicely done app. works as is should on my kindle. I will enjoy playing this app for sometime. signed appywife.
B007V65R54|4.0|Interesting way to look at everyday events and reason what the outcome may be.  Nate delivers in everyway with this book.
B0030V0PEW|4.0|Very well written book with good ideas and useful action plan that could save lives. Must read and work on your own check list.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is an excellent historically accurate book.  I recommend it to gain a personal understanding of the horrors of WWII.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Good information -- our food isn't as healthy as we think it is and we need to know.  There is a trust factor with information coming out of the USDA -- we can't believe everything they tell us and unfortunately the medical profession is believing what they're told too.  Thank you for exposing the reality of what has been done with our wheat -- how many other foods we're told to eat have been modified that we don't know about.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this app for my band and its amazing. We can share songwriting ideas and songs quickly. Get the Moleskine Smartbook too.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|enjoyed this new take on the Holmes series.  Hope the show continues on a long term basis.  Good stuff, ya.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I'm looking forward to reading Wool 6+.  I hope more of the history of what happened to the world before the silos were built will be revealed.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|Opened the app and couldn't find any instructions anywhere. So I open it and there's s black and white screen with music that I suppose is expected to be scary. Waited minute after minute after minute. Not a thing happened. I could use my fingers to move the screen like Google Earth, but still saw nothing different. Don't get it... But hate when developers don't include clear instructions; it happens too often and don't understand why you wouldn't make it as easy as possible for someone to use.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|not meant for children to watch, there are some scenes however I love this series, I cannot wait for season 3.
B000OCXIDK|5.0|Very interesting a good and fast read.i would highly recommend.<br />Author has a gift of holding the reader turning page by page.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|slow moving, slow developing story line. main character - Corey - being a smart ass throughout does not carry this book. kind of a waste of time and bucks.
0345529057|4.0|My only complaint is that the print size is too small. If the print size were larger, it would greatly help.
0061990477|5.0|Love, love this book.  It was everything I had been told it would be.  This is what I call a page turner.
B00BHMF578|4.0|I thought it was good, and an interesting true story, but that the character development ( other than Alan Arkin) was a little bland
B009NPKTN6|4.0|I am actually surprised at tom cruise playing this part unlike his other parts he has played. he did a very good job. I would definatly watch this movie again
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|I could watch this over and over again! It is a great build up to the final season. I may watch the series for third time.
B007712XAU|5.0|Great set, love it.  So glad to be able to start this series from the beginning. Good service in sending product quickly.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|To really enjoy this movie, you must suspend reality for a bit, and then try to learn a lesson, you'll be glad you did..
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Full of mystery and heart. Very creative characters that transport you both back in time and into a different world. A great read.
B00942X8PY|5.0|New game play feel. Reminds me of a classic phone game but with smart phone brains added! Check it out and you'll agree.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|my favorite character is the mummy great job! my grandson and I watch it together over and over and he just turned 3, and he says noni put in blah blah and we both dance to it too. then we watch it again and again
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is an awesome Mario feeling game. It has a bit more feeling than Mario though.This is a great game
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|The photography, the soundtrack, the dialoge, the screen play, the cast, and oh, lets not forget that Massarti, all fantastico!
B0027MJU00|5.0|Hard to put this one down! It kept me guessing from beginning to end. Gillian Flynn has yet to disappoint me!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Another classic Sparks love story this book is fantastic.  The characters are so skillfully developed that you can almost feel the fear of the soldiers; the loneliness an haunting senses of Thiebolt.  Each chapter you feel you know them better until the flood and the bravery of the men in Beth; nana; and Ben's lived.  LOVE is the winner in this fabulous book.
0880796863|3.0|The Deck gets all 3 stars. The box included the Celtic Cross tarot layout and a mini-tarot card dictionary and reference guide. The guide I'm sure is informative but an awkward read due to its size. Nonetheless the tarot adventure is sure to be worthwhile! Quality product, always grateful for good service!
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Very confusing, still can't figure out just what it was about, cults ? maybe, the metaphysical? don't know.  The start of the show and Juaquin Phoenix's role  , still can't figure it out  SSSSSSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOOOOOO CONFUSING
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this product. I use it on my tablet, my computer and my Kindle. Works great, I only wish I didn't have to pay for the premium features.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I really like how this book was put together.  I liked the fact that Chris's wife was included in the book.  Reading things from her point of view added tremendously to the book.  It was very easy to read and I could hardly put it down.  I think I finished it in two days which is a rarity for me.  With the amount of detail in the book it felt like I was there when the action was going down.
B000Y0Q5NM|4.0|Back when SG1was current and on television I didnt watch. Many friends said it was great. I never took the time till now. I AM HOOKED.
B000WMFZNS|5.0|Although I already have this movie on VHS, I wanted to purchase this DVD box set. The additional items are interesting. The story is wonderful, and the authenticity of the staging is magnificent. I also have the Miriam Collection box set of FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, another great classic with authentic settings and costumes. Actually, I can recommend both. (Now, if I could only locate THE WAR LORD. . . .)
B004LP3AYI|5.0|well written, couldn't wait to turn the pages, interesting characters.  Read the series and enjoyed it greatly.  Shared with family and we all waited anxiously for the last book and me to finish reading it to pass it on.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|It was ok, interesting to see just where he got the idea for psycho.  a usual man, the wife did over half of the work and got zero credit, it was worth it just to learn about the woman behind the man
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|when first got it I put it in easy mode and day time... saw slender a few time coming for me.. won the game in 1minute and a little bit more... then decided to go hard mode and day again... got 3 papers... and slender showed up several times... still scatter... went where the phone is looking for papers and I made a 360 arroynd the telephone... he appeared from no where and kill me in 1seg.. with no warning he was around.. survive for 45 segs maybe .... I almost crap myself.. get the game... scary
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the book. Once I started reading I did not want to put the book down. Looking forward to book two.
0345531930|5.0|This is one of my 2 favorite Grisham novels--don't bother with the movie, it's a campy mess of bad acting and awful direction IMHO (actually, the movie is so bad that it is occasionally amusing).<br /><br />I love courtroom drama. RAINMAKER pits the law student who hasn't even passed the bar yet and his \\"paralawyer\\" against the Big Bad Insurance Company that routinely denies EVERY claim made against it--initially.<br /><br />Grisham is at the top of his game here; most of his novels are great first-reads (then give it a toss), but this one has pulled me back in for many re-reads. The out-of-court action keeps veering off into sidebars that ultimately tie-in to this David versus Goliath tale. In court David nukes the giant, doesn't just bang him in the forehead, which is perhaps a weakness in this novel; but the Baddies manage to slither out of judgment by declaring bankruptcy.<br /><br />The hero gets the girl, murders her abusive husband and gets away with it, kills a naughty insurance company, and retires from the law after a 1-0 lifetime score and a $500,000,000.00 victory. What's not to like? @hg47
1401924751|5.0|I love these cards.  From the moment I opened the box I was jazzed.  The cards feel full of positive energy.  I love the artwork and the messages.  I've enjoyed doing readings for my friends and for myself.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|I got this game and played road at day on easy. I realized that the more notes you get the more slenderman appears and the closer he is. at one point I got irritated because I couldn't find the 8th note and I tried 7 times! where is it?
B005NFVZTM|5.0|Always fun to know who they were and what shaped them.  You get to see them in the beginning  very very worth renting.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This a really fun to play.  The graphics are awesome!  I can't wait for the next game to come out.
B009G8GRX6|4.0|I love the 1st 3 songs and about 1 or 2 others, but the end of the album is pretty weak.
B004S3MB2U|4.0|Great for every day use. Basically, a metric conversion app and calculator all in one. Would be 5 stars if it would convert currency as well.
B003FHMHPQ|5.0|Another great read from Doreen. She is so inspirational.  The book is helpful in letting readers see which category they fall into, or like me, which categories apply.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Van shows his chops! This is pure Morrison at the peak of vintage. Has every song honed to a razor's edge. Cool, blue, smooth, and cutting without remorse. His fans have got the goods and we can only wait until he slices us another piece of pie.
0062238868|5.0|This story is well done and from the heart. Our military personal for the most part are exemplary in every way. To bad our government is not.
B003VWU2WA|5.0|This is a great controller.  As a video editor, having a big hardware volume control within arms reach is very important.  This is the perfect, inexpensive solution.<br /><br />I also used it as a button for a photo booth at a party.  I adjusted the light to pulse up and down, so when people walked in and there was only one pulsing button, it was pretty obvious what to do.
B00008WT5C|5.0|No disrespect to Brian Johnson but my favorite AC/DC is with Bon Scott on vocals. This disc brings back so many memories, probably cause we listened to if alot...lol  Dont know how I have gone this long without a copy but it will now be in steady rotation in my Ipod... If you dont own it and maybe looking for some &#34;older&#34; AC/DC GRAB THIS AND TURN IT UP, you wont be disappointed
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love the game so much there is only one thing that could make it better is if it was real
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Sometimes I'm not in the mood to read before bed so I just look for a lecture to watch.  This is a great app for Kindle.  You can watch videos as short as 2 minutes or lectures that are much longer.  Always something interesting that gets your brain working!
B006LSZECO|1.0|This book was worse than television, horrible addicting waste of time.  I hate reading about sociopaths, I'm so much more interested in more interesting people.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|The good guys die so oblivious intellectuals can criticize. No more wars that require rules of engagement that insures politicians are in charge.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome<br />My favorite part is the world tour I can no wait to see the next place where the world tour will take me. Please comment on my facebook page my name is sacking Clark peace
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Great read. Enjoyed the characters in the story.  Wonderful story line everyone can relate to in their life at one time or another.
0061245097|4.0|Okay, so I am now seriously loving this series. I finished book one yesterday and now I've finished book 2 today in half a day...So yeah, loving it! I can't wait to read book 3. This series is pure entertainment to me. So far, I definitely recommend the series :)<br /><br />This was a pretty awesome sequel in the Night Huntress series. I didn't know how things would go considering what happened at the end on book 1, but things were pretty good. Cat and Bones are two awesome characters that I love. Especially Bones! That guy continuously has me cracking up throughout the book. Cat too with her sarcasm. That girl is feisty! I almost died when she told her Mom she'd let Bones bite her if she ruin Denise's wedding. That Mom of hers is something else!<br /><br />The side characters are pretty interesting as well. Juan, Tate, Don and them. Denise, the friend though, I didn't see what was the point in her role. She didn't really do much as a character, but provide the wedding scene. That's about it. Maybe she'll have more of a role in the upcoming books. I don't know though.<br /><br />Of course the romance in this book was once again scorching. But I like how, so far in the series, the books haven't been filled with just sexual scenes. I mean they're there, but it's not overwhelming like how it is in some books and I like that. And the book was action packed like the last and it was surely a page turner since I finished this in half a day. I couldn't put it down. I am just too intrigued with the characters and humor.<br /><br />Can't wait to start book 3 to get another glimpse of Bones :) And I'm also looking forward to all the drama and excited from the other characters as well lol
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Instantly hooked at the first headline of the Titanic in the initial episode, I, in the company of many no doubt, inhaled every episode like it was the drug to solve all my personal problems. Addict I became, intensely interested in my favorite characters through three seasons of appalling events,servant gossip, that ever-nastalgic and alluring British aristocratic lifestyle, and of course the seductive tension between the characters Mary and Matthew. However, alarmingly and without warning, Season 3 left me alone in a hollow room of irritation, possibly akin to that of an addict's withdrawal. As the blood trickled down the cheek of the now-deceased Matthew, 90% of the reason I love Downton Abbey suddenly vanished. The vacuum left by Mary's counterpart demands more than the young (albeit strikingly handsome) Branson can deliver, because we simply have not connected with him at the level we did Matthew. (However, on second thought, a torn, rain-soaked white shirt, a day's growth and perhaps a broken leg might add a new level of connection, but I digress. Would still be a great scene, though.) What does Season Four promise? Sigh. The final episode of Three set the stage for the (yawn) predictable nod toward Thomas' sexual orientation as the object of his affection will most certainly realize that he is, after all, not straight. My favorite valet might actually admit to sweet Anna that he did, in fact, murder his late ex. Will Branson turn the Abbey around and implement his late brother-in-law's controversial ideas? My keenest longing is to return to the comfy easy chair with my kindle fire and glass of red in the blessed quiet hours of night, curling up for my fix, and immerse myself in the English lilt of yesteryear-as has been my cherished practice. I am reluctant to hope that the next season of Downton Abbey will deliver the goods. Though I will it to be so. After all, I AM a junkie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I wish there were ten of these novels, after wife read our sex life went through the roof!! TY EL. James!!

1433502410|5.0|I THOUGHT I was just getting a great study Bible with in depth notes. What I didn't realize is that I ALSO got access to the online version which has an audio function, highlighting, note-taking, and a year read-through devotional option. The audio reader has a rich deep voice. I use the printed version to study passages that interest me. These notes are excellent. I'm thinking that this Bible and CD combo would make Christmas gifts next year for my grown kids. Shhhhhhhh.... don't tell....
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|This continues as a remarkable book. In many ways it remains the one true novel from which all our family romance stories have arisen this is a joyful  book with.Great. humour.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it because it is so gun and it relates to the real world by like all means so 5 star for yall
B000K29CEI|5.0|This movie shows friendships can be found in the most unsual places and with the most unusual kind of interactions.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Talked about this one for days.  Recommended it to all my friends and family.<br />Amazed at the animation and Loved the voice of &#34;Ted&#34;  Loved seeing him again on stage at the Oscars!!!  Great Job!!
B006GWO5NE|4.0|a good price for the cable, and it's nice to have an extra besides the one that came with the charger
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The eat game out there I'm addicted!!!!!!!!!!!!!! One try and you to will be addicted just like me and my family
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have not had this very long, but it is very helpful in my studies of the Bible.It helps with what I got it for to learn more about the Bible.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|This calculator has  many useful features which makes it a must have app for anyone who needs something more than a simple scientific calculator.
B0060CXN2O|5.0|This movie is awesome.  It is a family movie with a lot of laughs.  Back in the day, the jokes were funny and not harmful.  No fighting, swearing, or evil triates in this movie.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|It was a true (actual event in history) that was kept from the public (understandably so). The actors were wonderful and chosen with perfection resemble the men and women involved.  Movies like this make each one of us very proud to be an American!!  I couldn't wait to see it and I am so happy I finally did.<br />I feel this movie, director, writer etc. should have received more awards than it did but I was pleased to see it acknowleged for the great motion picture it was.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|Neeson does a good job. It's a little hard to believe you can murder this many people in France and the government comes out washes the streets and goes back to drinking wine. You can't hide cars blowing up with grenades very well. I mean like what does the owner tell the insurance company? Other than that it's great action. The script is thoughtful. And if you like to watch the bad guys get their butts kicked, grab the popcorn you're gonna love it.
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|This is a great read and you won't be able to put it down. I loved every minute of it and was disappointed when I finished it. Make sure you read this!
B003F48E4W|5.0|Anyone not giving this movie a full five stars needs to have a thorough head examination.  They then need to assess their lives, deeply meditate, watch it again and come back to revise the review.  Really, this movie should get honorary Best Picture Oscars for the next 50 years.  It's that good.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I bought these based on other good reviews. The basic earbuds just don't stay in my ears so I purchased these and love them. They shipped quickly, the sound is great.(although I am not picky in the sound department) I have been using them for about 2 weeks now for my c25k program so I use them 3 days a week and they show no signs of stopping! I I highly recommend these to anyone who needs headphones that stay on!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Although a bit cheesy, it's completely, &#34;brilliant!&#34; I honestly wished we would have seen at least one more season with this doctor, but nonetheless I loved it.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|It is very disappointing. I like Jude Law and Keira Knightley but this movie failed to show real Lev Tolstoi story. There is no necessary depth to the story. It is simple love affair - sad. Karenin shown as cold and indifferent, Anna is ignorant - very strange.
B0094K1WZE|4.0|I know all these movies are &#34;Fantastic&#34;, this one goes a little further than others. A Russian walks around train stations by himself with the nuclear launch codes? A submarine launched ICBM has a single warhead? The ICBM comes in under power on the re-entry phase of the flight? It isn't set to go off at altitude? A missile coming in from space through the atmosphere (super hot ionized gases surrounding it) can receive an abort code milliseconds from detonation? The MIRV weapons are like 3&#34; octagons, this one is 2' in diameter and takes out a spire? You can stick a card in a card reader and figure out the codes to send to open doors? The car, the weapons, the hall screen, the cooling system, the maglev, the connecting into security and elevator controls. Argh! I haven't even discussed the whole Dubai Hotel thing. Fun to watch, but I had to shut off my brain. Safe to say if this is what it takes to rescue me from bad guys, I'll take Rambo, Jackie Chan, or Mr T. At least their stuff is believable. Cruise could get better technical advice than this? Great action, I loved the ending scene. Reasonable acting.  It would be more enjoyable if it had more reality.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|I enjoyed the film very much. The special effects were pretty good. The story line was pretty good also. I think that there are a lot of people out there that would enjoy this film also!
B008JOLG7U|4.0|Love the song on the album. Glad I purchased it! You will enjoy it as we'll I would think very much.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I saw this in theaters and loved it.  I don't consider myself a Bond expert, due to the fact that I haven't seen all of the previous Bond films.<br />I have seen bits and pieces of Connery's Bonds and in my opinion think he was \\"The\\" Bond during those years.  But alas it's the 21st century.<br />I've only seen a couple bits and pieces of Moore's Bond due to the fact that I found them to be more comedy than action.  I don't recall any Dalton or Lazenby's Bonds.  Pierce Brosnan's \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" was the first Bond that I saw in theaters.<br /><br />But as I've said... This is now the 21st century.  And this movie in my opinion shows how Bond may be old, but he is still a reliable and highly needed MI6 agent.  Daniel Craig does a good job portraying the \\"New\\" James Bond.  I've seen and own Casino Royale. And I own Quantum of Solace.<br /><br />The CR and QofS are both offered as two disk dvds. Skyfall, much to my dismay, is only offered here on Amazon as one disk.  It does have some good \\"special features\\" it looks like, with one in particular.  Brother-in-law is currently borrowing this.  After I get it back I'll update info about the features.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is great, especially if you have an android tablet so you can use mcpelauncher. Its a great app, and mcpe is awesome
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I found the information and the research to be very enlightening and affirming about my experience as an introvert in an extroverted country. Not sure that I can extrapolate to the world.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I have yet to read a Malcolm Gladwell book that didn't really expand my mind. I'm a conservative with years of entrenched thinking. This is the first book in a long time that has altered my compass bearings. I will never see successful people in the same light. It doesn't make you doubt their accomplishments. You do walk away with a better understanding of what is an isn't the cause of them. He ought to do a study on negative outliers too. You walk away with a huge respect for the people in the middle, and those who put in the 10,000 hours.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book is very good. Anything you want to know about war is in here. I couldn't put it down  after I started reading.
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|I love this movie!!!  I have watched it several times already.  It is so inspiring and well done.  Great camera work and picture quality.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Well deserved awards... the 2012 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series, the 2011 and 2012 Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series - Drama, and the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and Lead Actress in a Drama Series for Damian Lewis and Claire Danes respectively.<br /><br />This show is original at it's best.  24 is no way like this.  Claire Danes isn't Jack Baur.  But she plays a great spy suffering from manic depression.  Her character as Carrie Mathison is a CIA operative, unlike Baur's CTU agency.<br /><br />It amazes me how the British actor Damien Lewis can portray the All-American Marine Veteran.  He amazed me in Band of Brothers.  And now Lewis has created this great character - Nicholas Brody.<br /><br />Mandy Patinkin as Saul Berenson is a really good comeback for Mandy.  I liked him in Criminal Minds.  But he will always be remembered as Inigo Montoya in The Princess Bride in 1987 (#Happy25thAnniversary to that movie #PrincessBride btw).<br /><br />Now don't get me wrong here.  I liked the final half of 24's 8 seasons as well as the bits of the first seasons that I've seen.  So I think if 24 can survive 8 seasons, in my opinion, Homeland can too.  And like 24, Homeland is raking in it's due awards.<br /><br />This show is superb and has brought Showtime in contention with HBO I think.  Season 1 was a great start.  And now season 2 has left us with cliffhanger questions - just as it should.<br /><br />P.S.  Currently watching FX \\"The Americans\\" as we wait impatiently for season 3.  It's like Homeland but the main characters are KGB spy's living in America during 1980's.  I agree with Rolling Stone Magazine for saying that this show portrays the 80's quite well.  [[ASIN:B00BMKVLGY Comint]] = The Americans.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I have been around for all of them.  I never thought anything could ever top From Russia With Love OR Sean Connery but Skyfall and Daniel Craig are my new favorites.  I know this didn't have the normal plethora of high tech gadgetry as most Bond films but I liked the fact that the stars had to actually act their way through the movie and not rely on props to tell the story.  (surviving the fall from the train was a bit over the top) Although I've enjoyed the other actors who've played Bond, I never thought I could ever really accept in my mind that anyone could ever replace Sean Connery as the consummate James Bond.  Daniel Craig however has finally convinced me that it is possible.  He is by far, the best choice to replace Mr. Connery.  I will miss Judy Dench but it looks like Ralph Fiennes will be a good choice to fill the shoes of M.  I thought the new Q was a fresh change as well.  Now I can't wait for the next Bond film.
B00AQNOCZ0|3.0|If this rating were based on the movies alone, I'd give this 4.5 stars hands-down.  The films are very well shot, lit, dressed, acted, etc etc etc.  While I would have liked a little more depth on some points, I get that not everything can be covered in a film based on a book.<br /><br />My major complaint is in the 'Special Features&#34; aspect.<br /><br />I specifically got the 11 disc version of this, as the 30+ disc version is just too much money.  I don't know what WB is playing at for making a set so expensive and the only way to get the bonus footage.  The first five movies had very little bonus content worth talking about, most of it games and gimmicks, and very little truly behind the scenes footage.  The final 3 had a bit more, but they also had a separate blu-ray of 'bonus footage' for each.  I don't even think there was 1.5 hours on average of decent, well thought footage, and only a couple of the spots were truly gripping (the ones dealing with JK Rowling mostly) and insightful.<br /><br />Being a long-time LOTR fan, and having owned the first extended trilogy they released (4 discs per film, 12 discs total), and the second set on blu-ray (5 discs per film, 15 discs total), and only costing $60 for the latest set, that's about $20/film.  I'd have gladly paid $160ish for some real bonus footage, but I don't think it actually exists.  In the LOTR set, they walk through the making of the films, starting with the birth of JRRT, all the way to the final release of the third film (111 years of info, only 6-7 in a studio, you had 10 years), and that's only 6 of the 9 bonus discs- the last 3 are a documentary on each film.  It covers every single aspect of the films.<br /><br />I paid $8/film, I'd say it was a deal. I'd also say I'm stuck, because the only edition currently available with more footage is $350ish ($43/film) and I'm not willing to part with that (read the reviews- others that love bonus footage were also disappointed).  So thanks WB for a full set of the films, but maybe next time you do a big release, like this, take some notes from the folks over at New Line.  They've got their act together on how to release a box set.  In fact, so does Fox (Star Wars), Paramount (Indie Jones), Disney/Pixar (Up, Toy Story, pretty much everything), Dreamworks (everything) and you actually did on your Kubrick set.  How did you manage to let one of the longest running film series fall apart on such a monumental release on the highest quality home-viewing platform fall apart like this?  If you do another one properly, it'd be nice, and I'll need to see some seriously positive reviews first.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This was a fun game. It was simple and could have been a bit more challenging. I also wish it was longer. It seemed a little short.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Honestly, I don't understand why Suzanne Collins made Katniss. Katniss is a very unlikeable character. Seriously, who would want their child to look up to a girl who is on the virge of suicide and dispare. And then there is the romance. WAIT- What romance? She says she thinks gale is good looking but then shows no intrest. Then when Peeta says he &#34;likes&#34; her, she trys to stab him in the throut. then later on in the series falls i nlove with him. And even there it doesnt seem like she loves him. Then there are the twists. You already know that Katniss and Peeta are going to end up together. Ut what you dont realize is that its all a big show and then you notice that later on peeta doesnt even love her. and then you are confused. does he love her? Does she love him? And a the end of the third book .... it doesnt give you much details does it? I think Suzanne Collins made a harsh mistake writing these three books.
034580404X|5.0|Bought these as a gift for myself I couldn't read them fast enough it was a great series can't wait for the movie lol would recommend highly
B009K0P10K|5.0|Faux Emily Thorne (aka Amanda) (Emily VanCamp) wants vengeance to those who killed her father.  The suspense and twists to the cause, in my opinion, is perfect.  It has great cliffhangers and keeps my family, friends and myself waiting impatiently for more.<br /><br />Madeleine Stowe as Victoria Grayson is at her best.  I can really believe that Madeline's character is the Queen of the Hamptons.  Cannot decide if I want to hate or like Victoria.  But never the less always cheering for faux Emily.<br /><br />SPOILER<br />As for the faux Amanda Clarke (aka Emily) (Margarita Levieve), I was really sad to what happened to her as well as Jack Porter (Nick Wechsler).<br />END SPOILER.<br /><br />Gabriel Mann as Nolan (Mitchell) Ross is a good character.  Gabriel does a good job be the likeable geek trying to help faux Emily.<br />Barry Sloane as Aiden Mathis oozes a sexy mystery man.  I am both pleased and curious about this guy's appearance in the show.<br /><br />Can't wait for more.... come on Sunday... come by faster.
B006YB9VJU|5.0|This is the exact same product that is being sold elsewhere for $20.00 at half the price. Also, I use it for the Sony Xperia TL, so don't be put off from the description. It can be used for any Sony Xperia phone with NFC capability.<br /><br />The product was exactly what I expected, and it was delivered very quickly, also as expected.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.

B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I COULDN'T PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!  IT STARTS OUT GOOD AND JUST GETS BETTER. IT'S FULL OF EXCITEMENT, LOVE AND DANGER .
B005GFPZYK|2.0|Seems to be writing more about himself than the team effort to get the job done. A very selfish person that puts himself ahead of his wife and child. Maybe that is what being a SEAL has to be?
0345803507|5.0|Wow.. right on time. Thanks for being so fast. The book is in perfect condition. I haven't read the book yet since I'm waiting for the 2nd book to arrive first.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Slow at start but got better. Didn't care for the ending. Could have elaborated more at the end. Over all ok
B008UX2UIO|4.0|First of all, let me say that, after finishing it, you can see why the pulitzer award.<br /><br />That being said, make no mistake, this is, at least for the most of it, a sad book. No doubt, it has it's funny moments, but there's an undeniable sadness all over it, mostly from the depressing and pathetic nature of the characters.<br /><br />Still, a must read.
B002UM5BXW|3.0|I expected more dish about dirty restaurant secrets.  Such as slip shod sanitation, service of rotting food, and the like.  Halfway through the author's endless list of characters, I found myself being forced to finish.  The more of the book I read, the more bored I became.  I also found myself becoming increasingly irritated at the obvious lack of editing and much needed missing commas ( which would've made many of his statements clearer and much easier to read).
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I guess I was actually disappointed that this series has come to its forecast end. And somehow the last book was just a bit short of the magical thrall of the first two. Still, an excellent series of stories overall.
0345404475|5.0|THIS IS A VERY INTERESTING BOOK, PROF REQUIRES US TO PURCHASE BUT I THINK IT WORTH FOR IT. THIS BOOKS TALKS ABOUT AFTER 2022 THE THIRD WORLD WAR END, MOST OF THE ANIMALS DIED AND COMPANYS MAKING ELECTRIC ANIMALS AND ANDROIDS THAT LOOK SIMILAR LIKE HUMAN. AND COMPANY HIRE HUNTER TO KILL THE ANDROIDS THEY PRODUCE BECAUSE THEY THINK IT WAS A THREATED TO THEM.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Favorite game ever! So much fun! Addicting and wonderful! Yay you should totally get it! Everything in is great. And it has updates all the time!
B003008RWA|5.0|This movie really makes you think. It brings up some really important issues we as Americans deal with when it comes to health care. I enjoyed the way the information was displayed in a non-political almost comical way and it honestly made me want to move to another country!
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I love this case. It's great. I'm pretty rough on my phone and this case can take everything I deal with in my life. It really is life proof!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun game, but be careful, it's very addicting. I do wish it didn't take so long to build up energy,  though.
0688156819|4.0|Tim Burton's distinct style of illustration beautifully captures the sensitivity and fragility of his characters. I wished there were more of them.
0062082353|5.0|For those who have not been in the military, Chris gives them a glimpse of what it takes  in effort and sacrifice from our combat personnel against terrorism in other areas of the world --  great  read!!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I saw my kids playing this on their tablets.  It was so fun I added it to my Kindle.  So much fun!  As addictive as Angry Birds!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Well written with excellent actors and actresses.  I have always enjoyed historically based dramas, and this is by far the best I have had the pleasure of watching.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The game itself is great.  I just wish it didn't take so long to get power ups and those sort of things.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Great series,the actors are really good, lots of plot twists and turns. Not predictable at all! I hope it sticks around for awhile
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I gave it 5 stars because it had all the elements of a successful thriller--- suspense, action, emotion, & was hard to figure out.  Plot excellent.  Characters well developed.
B005BDZN62|5.0|I got this for my 9 year old daughter after seeing a touring production and it really enhanced her appreciation for the show.  Looks great on blu-ray.
B007SGM084|4.0|I used to read non-fiction all the time, but adulthood got in the way.  However, this has been very entertaining and a great way to pass time on my elliptical.  I'm more into the story instead of the sex so to me this isn't something I would rave about and tell all of my friends to read. However, romance novels weren't really my thing in the past so those who are avid readers of this style may love this book.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I Loved this CD, another great CD with great music..JOSH HAS DONE IT AGAIN...Have all his cd's as well as seen him in concert two times... and has ALWAYS delivered nothing but the BEST..
B008BIN9EW|1.0|This game was deleted from my phone almost as soon as it was downloaded.  It has poor gameplay and poor quality.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|Uhh it just ended. Where is the conclusion for the characters.I feel like half the book is missing. What's happens to everyone? I'm disappointed. I liked the first two and this one was going well but then it just ended. There is no wind down to the end or anything, just stops. Disappointed.
B002NF1ZI6|2.0|very fragile , and easy to break, i did not expect such quality from lego, i am disappointed and i regret it.
B0042L78MG|5.0|I actually first heard a small snippet of the song \\"That Man\\" in the movie \\"Chimpanzee\\".  The monkeys were strutting around the jungle with this song as part of the soundtrack.  I really like the sound of Caro.  She has a great voice and the music arrangement is a \\"Toe Tapper\\".  I hope she comes out with another album real soon.  Purchase the album, you won't be sorry.
B003E2UQMS|5.0|I read so many books and am happy to read anything from classic fiction to pure escapist chic lit.  I don't mind mediocre writing, gratuitous sex scenes or week predictable plots since the authors allow me to enter another world for a one or two hours every day, and for that I am grateful.  Even if their books are easily forgettable, for the time that I am reading them, they are a fun way to spend my time. But every now and again a book comes along that makes me rethink my strategy of reading everything and anything.  A book that is not forgettable, that is well written and that has characters I would like to meet.  The Silver Linings Playbook is such a book, and as soon as I complete this review I am going to search for other books by Matthew Quick.<br /><br />The book is told from the perspective of Pat Peoples, intentionally named, I am sure, to be representative of all people.  Since he is definitely not mentally stable, his perspective is simple and almost childlike.  He has an unshakeable belief in a happy ending and is determined to take responsibility for creating his own happy ending.  Through him we meet a cast of characters who are neither good nor bad, but just ordinary people who make mistakes and try to fix them.  It is about the love of family, the loyalty of friends, the need to put right what is wrong and most importantly the search for happy endings.<br /><br />I could spend hours talking about each and every character, but that would spoil the book for you.  However, Pat's mother deserves a special mention.  As a mother I completely identified with her unconditional love of her son.  I loved that she bought him trendy clothes and an entire home gym and know exactly why she did it.  If you can't fix your child inside, then you will try to fix the outside.  What you absolutely cannot do, as a mother, is nothing!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I really enjoyed getting to know Cheryl. A great story of courage and perseverance. She will inspire many to do something challenging to find themselves.
B0094K1JPC|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie! A lot of fun, and Harrison Ford was great as the crusty, egotistical meany. Diane Keaton played a great part, too.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I like the DVD set just fine.  The Big Ban Theory is one of our favorite shows so having the DVD set available to watch when we want is great.  Good quality product.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It was a really good book I enjoyed how in detailed it was I would read it again it was very interesting
B0098QBEXO|5.0|This film is deeply moving to me. The acting is brilliant by all four men. The direction is spot on and the cinematography transports you. As a young girl I lost my mother to cancer. My husband thought this film might be too much for me, but although I cried I wasn't left feeling sad at all. I was left marveling at the beauty that love and friendship bring to even the ugliest, most devastating experiences in life. In fact I found myself laughing out loud far more often than crying. Through this final sojourn these friends gave James joy and laughter to the end and as he himself says, &#34;there is no tragedy in that&#34;. I wish I could have gone on an odyssey like this with my mother. There is a quietness to this film, which doesn't barrage you with distracting subplots and characters. It is the simplicity of the telling that makes this journey so poignant. I highly recommend this movie to all!
B005COO1X6|5.0|Very interesting and chilling story!  Very well written to provide the great suspense and fear-factor that Stephen King fans enjoy.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|Got it when expectedNever have any problems with your service always receive my products on time and customer service is always very good
B009NX50DM|2.0|Got this free (thankfully) from prime because Michael Caine is in it. But I did not think it at all interesting. Didn't even finish watching it!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A fantastic story of the aerial combatants brought together by fate and duty to their countries. Although they had never met they carried a friendship for forty years.  Heartwarming and uplifting.
B004ODLUF8|1.0|This dvd does not work in my european dvd player. So don't buy this dvd if you life in europ.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed the style of writing but thinking that there may be people in the world who really play with any level of this kind of manipulation is just plain scary!  I'm glad none of my friends/family are like this.... Or I hope not, anyway!!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Spent quiet some time sitting on the toilet playing this game.  Lol.  Game play is fun, challenging, but when you get really far and lose, it makes it hard to play more because you don't want to restart from the beginning.
B00AGE20ZI|5.0|Never have any problems with your service always receive my products on time and customer service is always very good
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I loved this book.  I could hardly put it down and the second book in this series... Can't wait for the next book... I'm Hooked
B007REV4T8|2.0|I'm a bond fan, but that was not what I expected. But don't take my word for it. You make your own mind up. I still like amozons.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|this game is somewhat fun similar to Sim city.  it does take a lot of time and sometimes force closes on kindle fire.  great so far as a free game though.
B000PAAH3K|2.0|Parts were very interesting but much seemed to be fill and fluff.  I wish they had shortened it by half.
B00B1R8TCM|5.0|A solid blues duo, Charlie Musselwhite is a legend on the harp and Ben Harper has earned his dues, great listening for blues fans.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|Great album. It is easy to sleep to. The music isn't too upbeat that it is hard to listen to.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Just as Merriam-Webster is a good dictionary, this app is of similar quality. Most people don't realize that a dictionary doesn't or at least isn't supposed to give meanings to words. It's primarily function is to show how words are used. The meaning of those words are in the minds of the people who are using them. This app offers a variety of definitions and grammatical applications of word usage, as well as providing the reader with something that is usable and understandable. It has a great function of providing a word per day for vocabulary development. We can all find many opportunities to make use of this app in our daily communications. It's definitely a five-star application.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|This book is fantastic. The story is amazinf and I have enjoyed reading it & will recomend it to others.
B001W63DX2|2.0|Just finished the \\"film\\" portion of this set. You really don't get much \\"access\\" to the band as they would have you believe. Essentially you see the band and crew get on Ed Force One to whatever city they play next. Then you see the band get in the van that takes them from the airport, eat some pizza. Then they arrive at the hotel at which point the band and crew leave both fans and documentary crew behind til show time. After show time, they go back on Ed Force One and guess what? They do the same thing again. About the only variant from this routine is on their day off. Then we get a minute of golf, soccer, and visiting the pyramids in Mexico, and interviews from the band members scattered throughout. About the only thing worth mentioning about this documentary is the passion the fans have for this band, especially in Latin America. I personally would have been more interested in hearing just from them.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|it's a good game although there is a glitch in the last level but there is a way around it
B00978V35C|5.0|Robert Cray has honed his trade from his days in Oregon, to Nothin But Love, is nothin but the blues.
0345803507|5.0|The price of this was wonderful.They came in 2 days like I was supposed to get them. I think I will like them.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|Great story, Don't start if you haven't got time to finish, Cause once you start you cant stop....Will be downloading more of these
0545265355|5.0|Loved This series is really good. I would recoment it as it is quite different to anything else i have read
B000GFLKF8|5.0|INSIDE MAN IS D.W. AT HIS BEST!!! AND THE WHOLE CAST IS WONDERFUL!!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!  NOT MANY PICTURES KEEPS ON YOUR SEATS AT THIS ONE!!
B0046B3QTG|5.0|This movie was really cute! Can be a family movie or just a girls night out movie. You'll laugh and say awww!
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|This is a great way to pass the time. It's much more fun to play when you're alone,at night. Graphics are not that good but somehow, that just seems to make it that much better. And the music is just awesome. Overall I would say this is a good game, especially since its free!
0345803493|5.0|The price of this was wonderful.They came in 2 days like I was supposed to get them. I think I will like them.
B00821OX98|5.0|If you like BSG, you will like this series. Story line does not get too bogged down by pointless side stories.
0345803507|5.0|Well let's start by saying I read Bared to You 1st and loved it.Then read FSOG and though it was pretty good,I know this is about FSF, but I'm trying to make a point. Then I read Reflected In You and it wasn't as good.Then read FSD and it kept me interested.So Sylvia Day can write a better book but E L James kept me more interested even though her writing isn't as great as other authors.  I read the last book and my final thoughts are  I love this Trilogy so much better than I thought I would.Christian is a control freak and all but he does love and adore Ana.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|It was a little slow on the uptake but picked up.  Overall it is a good read.  I recoment it.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I tried to load the game about 50 times and it will not let me play the game. I hate it
0823003590|5.0|I use this book as a teaching tool. It is one of the best books of its kind I have ever seen.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This was a very thrilling novel to read. Crouch definitely succeeded in his attempt to give it a David Lynch feeling.
B005ILYWN2|5.0|The way Cloverfield should have been done.  Fun mockumentary with plenty of action and suspense. Fun for monster movie fans.
B000FC1MCS|4.0|This was a very orginal story.  I made me think  (again) about  how well humans can cope when necessary.  Wonderful story.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As usual - all of his books are great.  They start quick and the action just keeps going.  Flynn is an awsome writer.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I chose this rating because my granddaughter really loves this game!!! It kept her busy for hours and the graphics are cute
B009VB97EY|3.0|Great for a girls night, fun dance routines....  horrible plot/acting/presentation when not on stage.  I thought Channing Tatum was pretty charming in his flirty persona and did it well, but the main actress he was flirting with was a horrid actress, it detracted from it.  But for what it is, a fun girls night, it is very good!  :-)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game...it's very addictive! I am always trying to beat my last score or the scores of my friends! Love that it's free too!
B003M6OW4Y|5.0|I couldn't get enough of Dollhouse!  Wish it didn't end after just 2 season, but I'm glad it had an ending.
B008BM0IUG|5.0|Clearly a must read !<br /><br />A complete picture of what science is capable of when brains and powerfull tools are brought together. This book is pretty accesible.... So anyone interested in the meaning of LHC or E=mc2 should consider this book.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Such a fun read!! It's a cool mix of the normal witch story. It adds science and history which make me really enjoy it.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|What a timeless piece of music! Still relevant and resonant after all these many years. His music has overtones of Bob Dylan and Jose Feliciano but more importantly, it will hit the absolute target of your emotional center. The bittersweet nature of his story makes his late in coming success all the more lovely.
B000PC6A3E|4.0|This is a pretty good movie. Nice formative story to explain the history of Batman in this version of the universe. I would say it's not as good as The Dark Knight, but I wouldn't expect it to be, anyway.
0399226907|5.0|i will admit that the book is smaller then i thought it was going to be. For some reason i thought it was going to be a HUGE board book but it wasnt. it was slightly smaller then the size of the paper back, but a lot bigger then the mini- version. Got it new because i'm having my first baby in July and i wanted to make sure its something i'd feel comfortable with him putting in his mouth. For some reason i couldnt do that with an older book- even if it was in good condition.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great game I really recamind it I really love this game very addicting I love this game
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I have a love/disappointed relationship with The Walking Dead. Loved the pilot then progresses into dissappointment after, especially with first 2/3 of 2nd Season. However the last couple episodes of S2 revived it, and 3rd season has been a joy. And the episode I downloaded, \\"Clear\\" was probably one of it's top 5 episodes. Keep it up Walking Dead. I know there's a really good in here, just wish it was consistent.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|It's a good quick read. I couldn't put it down. Cute love story. It's not the deepest book I've ever read but it's fun and fast paced.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|What a timeless piece of music! Still relevant and resonant after all these many years. His music has overtones of Bob Dylan and Jose Feliciano but more importantly, it will hit the absolute target of you emotional center. The bittersweet nature of his story makes his late in coming success all the more lovely.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is a good game to waste to waste some time with. Its fun and easy. I really enjoy it
B00821OX98|5.0|I have watched this show from the start! It has different story lines to follow and very surprising outcomes almost every single episode. This is my second time watching the complete series. I am watching it with my 15 year old daughter. She is loving it too!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I like the variety of layouts within the game. It's not a repeat of something similar-they are unique and challanging. Great game!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Wife gave it a 5 (she really enjoys it) , Husband gave it a 2 1/2  (not his kind of story)
B009MF5BXK|4.0|Good &#34;ole&#34; action packed adventure by  Stallone and the guys.  They know they're not<br />25 years old and don't act or perform stunts as if they were.  Enjoyed  2  over  1.<br />Hold on to your seat - the oneliners are great.....
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season 3 has been one of the best seasons and it hasn't even ended yet. This show always keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat with mind-puzzling endings. They will keep the viewer guessing who will leave, die, or be turned. I highly recommend this show, but watch the previous season before watching season 3. I think most people who watch will become instant fans. AMC does a great job with their shows!!!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Ive seen this app a lot but always overlooked it. It looked dumb to me. Today I was bored and it was the free app of the day so I decided to give it a try. I haven't stopped playing it all day. Its weird interesting creepy....and addictive
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I kept hearing about Downton Abbey. I was afraid to watch it since it was on PBS. I shouldn't of waited so long! I watched the entire 3 seasons in 1 week! I couldn't concentrate on anything else. It is so well written, well acted series!
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I can play this one for hours! Love it! I like the challange of beating my own records and I also emjoy a leisurely game as well. Nice game to play.
B000BMPQUG|5.0|the songs were great just like i remembered them. my favorites were there and thensome.really great album.Toatally undoubtfully awesome. Super!
B005LAII12|5.0|I got talked into watching this by my 25yr. niece .  A guy growing up with a Teddy bear?!  Come on!  Enjoyed<br />it from beginning to end . Laughed  almost the entire movie...  That's why I bought it!<br />Make sure the younger kids are in the other room........
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Great book  to read. It makes people learn to appreciate the ones you love  every single second of life. I honestly loved this book and I would recommend it although it's a very doleful book.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|12 great songs.  Great sound.  If I did not know better, I would have thought Jimi was still alive and in the studio. Great CD!!!!
B007REV4T8|5.0|The movie was great. I love James Bond and this story was the best.  It was loaded with special effects.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It was so awesome I love it so much that I play on it all the time every one must play it
B000JMKTLO|1.0|Poorly written, poorly plotted with unbelievable characters.  This was not a mystery as the answer was obvious in the middle of the book.  My advice- forget it.
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|Not a big Sci-Fi fan  but enjoyed the movie very much.  It reminded me of a modern day &#34;ET&#34;,<br />with the bondship between the boy and the &#34;bot.&#34;  Also liked the fathers restablishment with<br />his son and how he worked and earned his way back into his life.
1451695195|5.0|This book was recommended to me and I must say, it was great reading----very well written and the book didn't drone on and on about the experience---stated the facts in a very easy reading style...the medical terms were a little involved, but was interesting.  I would recommend this book----great gift and lots to ponder---
044661758X|4.0|I enyoyed this book as I have every \\"Connelly\\" story . I have tried to analyse why I like these books so much  and it always comes back to the Harry Bosch character; Harry is a rough diamond and the real impact of his character is the way he accepts his shortcomings and endears himself to the reader. We empathise with him, apart from his talent as a detective he is very ordinary but somehow still manages to be our hero. I love the way he interacts with his partners and/or superiors and It is always rivetting when Harry questions a suspect. he is blunt and uncompromising and I find his dialogue fascinating - Harry is no charmer and does not hand out gratuitous compliments to anyone<br />Harry is right up there with any of the fictional detectives we have ever read about.<br />When a movie is finally made about a \\"Harry Bosch\\"novel I hope they pick the right actor - it has to be a very specific person
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|in the house thinken not scary (haven't bumped into him) then dead end turn around @#$%! ABOUT S***MY PANTS!!!!!
034580404X|5.0|exciting to read.  the first book leaves you wanting more and the second book leaves you anxious to know how this ends.  Best triology I have read in a very long time.  Amazing!
B009EEE2NO|4.0|Even though the graffics are pretty cheesy now this movie is still an action movie worth watching.  One of Arnold's best.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I chose this rating because it was a very good read. Very hard to put down. I liked the short chapters, which made me want to continue til the next and the next. Very believable, even with a tiger on board because of the zoo background & Richard Parker`s history with the family.  I would recommend this book to anyone, I don't think I would enjoy the movie, because I don't think it would do it justice.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Good Sci-fi entertainment.  Hokey, but more entertaining than phoney reality shows.  Good choice of actors and characters.  Everone fits their character. Special effects are done quite well.  Even my wife enjoys this show and she hates Sc-fi.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very good and worth the money I'm 11 and I have recommended this to other before BUY IT!!! The only thing is though is that with a certain hoverboard it lags but does it lag for yiu
B000FBFN1U|5.0|One of the best series of books ill read in my life time. The characters are vivid and the story truly twists in ways even avid readers won't expect.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The only reason I gave it a 4 is because there's no WOLVES.You need to get WOLVES I mean come on.and how do you get seeds gosh.
B004HX0P2Y|5.0|This is one of the best action movies.  Everyone in it is amazing.  My kids even liked it and I thought it may only appeal to adults that knew all the actors.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This video is a MUST for all middle school and high school teachers - or anybody who cares about fixing the environment.<br />It has 2 main messages: global warming IS increasing because of humans and we CAN fix the problem!<br />I rarely rate anything 5 stars, but this film earns it!
B0084AXZK0|5.0|A captivating story of the soul of a soulless man, and an interesting look at how 19th century English society viewed youth, beauty, morality, and mortality.
B00B9366VO|5.0|Great story of rock-n-roll. Full circle account from Beatles back to Beatle. Dave Grohl is a great master of history for music.
B000LXV9ME|5.0|I purchased this class a few months ago and continue to review it.  It helps me get things done in everyday life.  You can apply these principals at work and home.<br />I really like the way it explains how the mind works and how it shuts everything non essential down during times of danger.  This is why I don’t do as well on standardized tests. Many years ago  I devised a way to calm myself down during these tests and had no idea why it worked until now.  Kaizen is a way to get around this fight or flight mechanism that is build into our core.<br />I apply these lessons on myself, family, and work.  Little improvements every day adds up to a huge reward as time goes on.<br />.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|By far the saddest season ever. Still a fantastic show tho! Can't get enough Downton Abby! Let's hope everyone renews their contracts for season number 4.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I wanted to see the movie but decided to read the book first.  The book is so good.  It kept me captivated all the way through.  Sparks ended this one good for a change!  He did a great job of developing each character.  Loved it!
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|Is is just me or does the keypad not rotate with the kindle?  Other than that it is a basic calculator and the price cannot be beat.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game was awesome so awesome that I play it every day .Even my mom plays it.Coin dosser is awesome.<br /><br />Marlo Lochray
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Like almost all Clancy Books story had many twists and used my favorite characters. Hard to think f anything bad about it.
B0013UIUBC|4.0|This is not a mind bending moview, not the greatest I've ever seen or even close.  It is however a very enjoyable movie.  Will you like it?  Only you can tell.  Personally I am glad I bought it and saw it.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Slender Man really isn't scary. Game tip: don't look back and you will collect all pages. Do that and you will win.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Cheesy storyline, but more challenging than Bejeweled. Lots of levels, but you can complete in a few hours depending on how good you are.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it. It is like no other horse game I have played. I do wish though that the items weren't so expensive
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|really good game. a lot of detail was added in this game. it is worth the money. SLENDER MAN IS COMING FOR YOU!!! :)
B006YXTRHY|5.0|I read all the books, and I've seen all the movies. The special effects are spectacular. I enjoy the love story between Edward and Bella. I'm looking forward to to seeing the sequel to Breaking Dawn.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I'm not for these social media type games, but this one is actually pretty decent when you're sitting around with nothing to do.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Was a Valentines Day gift for my hubby.  He really loves it.  Super fast shipping, no hassle gift.!!!!  click Click and I'm a hero!!!
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is very good for a kindle. If you have the eight pages on computer,you should get this. Its not as scary, but still very fun and frightening at times. You think its too easy? You can raise the difficulty on this one! Theres also two maps instead of just one. My favorite one is The Road. I think its a great game when youre bored,need to pass the time, or just for fun!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle epitomizes a true Patriot, he is what all real men want to be. It is disturbing to think he passed with little fanfare while Whitney Houston and Michael Jackson were glorified by the American press at the time of their deaths. Book was well done and painted a vivid pictrure of what really goes on in modern warfare and tells a true tale of what we are fighting against, not the political garbage we are forced to ingest.
B000BPFBVW|3.0|This is certainly for Ray's funs. I found here several excellent tracks, but not as many to justify the entire CD for my taste. This CD can be used for qualty testing, as the masterinig is at a highest possible quality available on a CD. I am not sure that SACD or DVD-Audio versions would bring mush improvements. Playback on a good CD player provides better results that playback on an average SACD/DVD-A player.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Have all the movies. Am definately a Christian Bale fan, computer graphics great, story great.  a must have for any collection
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great use it regularly. I use it on my kindle daily. It is large enough for me to read. I do not have a calculator on my checkbook and this has taken its place,
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|I loved this movie.  I thought the sex scenes were so beautiful and not lewd in any way.  I actually cried.
B008220C56|1.0|Hated it from the beginning to the end.  They could have done without the stage settings and going back and forth between the stage and the story.  Just was not my cup of tea!  Wish I could return it.
B005HSL626|4.0|I don't getsl what's the big deal I mean I like it but its not what I would call it the best on amazon um  I  so have to say that some things are weird like sometimes it will crash ur kindle for no reason just warning u guys
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Unexpected story line but interesting movie.  Saw it at the theater didn't know if I was going to like it but after I saw it I knew I had to have it for my movie collection.  recommend to any collectors
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love it cannot wait to play. It's good for killing time. I own 4 temple run games. I love it
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|This movie is entertaining but not great.  I would not watch it again.  I am a fan of Anthony Hopkins always enjoy his performances.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm not a  Nicholas Sparks reader. I have seen 1 movie based on another book. The story line for this book caught my attention and I was interested to read it  This is the first of his books I have read and I enjoyed. I couldn't put it down! I may venture out and read another.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is amazing I play every single day its amazing even my dad plays it I love it if there was a 100 stars I would rate it 100 stars
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Used to read these stories and comics as a kid and is wonderful to see they are being brought back for not only the younger generation but also us nastolgic folks.  Great family film.  Great for any movie collection
B000WBZZ2A|1.0|I received this thinking it would play in my DVD player no it said it was not compatible for my DVD player would have returned it but I had already opened it. They need to specify weather it can play in a USA made machine or not very disappointed I will never order another DVD from amazon again...,......
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|This movie was very scary for me!  I started to watch it at night, but I was a bit scared so decided to finish watching it the next day.
B005D63ICI|4.0|Twists and turns still work.  Good cast, interesting plot lines, and still able to pull viewers back again and again!
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love this game but it doesn't have Herobrine My Friend Bryant has Herobrine. I think you get Herobrine in the PC Version of 6.0 Alpha
B007M45PMU|3.0|This is a pretty good album.  There are many good songs on it.  I primarily bought it cause it was on sale one day.  I am happy that i did.
B005CRQ4OW|4.0|This is a great book I will recommend this book to anyone who doesn't like to read it's like a comic book I love it I'd have some minor flaws but it is still a great book
B00B2064IY|4.0|First of all, let me say I'm a huge Hendrix fan. Not only do I own all of his original studio vinyl albums (and their CD upgrades), but all of his posthumous albums and box sets as well. However, I was straddling the fence on this one until I was in a brick-and-mortar store that uses a bullseye as its logo. Not only was it on sale, but it included an exclusive bonus track--a 20:01 instrumental jam entitled &#34;Ezy Ryder/MLK Jam (Captain Coconut).&#34;<br /><br />Recorded Jan. 23, 1970, at the Record Plant, the track features Band of Gypsies cohorts Billy Cox on bass and Buddy Miles on drums. It may not be an essential track, but it does include some incendiary guitar work--especially at about the 15-minute mark. Remember, this is essentially a jam and not a tightly structured song; it simply fades out at the 20-minute mark.<br /><br />PEOPLE, HELL AND ANGELS is not for the casual fan,  However, if you approach this release with the same attitude that Beatles fans did for the ANTHOLOGY series, this makes for fascinating listening for Hendrix enthusiasts. RECOMMENDED [Running Time - 72:49 (including bonus track)]
B0011ZVVOM|5.0|This album has it all.  Sounds like the mixed/recorded it in a basement.  Great songs!  I highly recommend this album.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have been using this app for some months now, and I must say it is one of the best &quot;white noise&quot; simulators out there. I love the customize feature, where you can create your own soundtrack. Highly recomended for anyone needing help sleeping.
B000FA675C|5.0|The title is not an exaggeration. This book had me questioning everything and I've never been so interested in art or religion before this book. It's a page turner
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This game works very well on the kindle fire. It has fast response time.  There very different puzzle set ups and challenges. Lots of fun
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Corey's dialogue, combined with a decent, plot is great fun.<br />Will look for the next one.<br />Now on to Mayday.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is great fun on my Galaxy S3.  The controls work well and the graphics are impressive.  I also appreciate that trees and houses break apart rather than forcing the player to turn around.  I better not show this one to the kids or I'll never get my phone back.
B004ZG5EYC|5.0|Exellent Europien movie! First class!! The most awesome, beautiful and mentally stimulating film of all! Maybe the best film I have ever seen!
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|Have read and totally enjoyed the first 2 books in this series I couldn't wait for the 3rd. 400 hundred pages of turning twisting words into a terrific yarn. This man makes a story come alive. You feel for the characters, the joys and their sorrows, their successes and their failures. 400 hundred pages almost non stop. Right to the very end and you leave me hanging. B@r$t@rd, how could you do that to me. HOW?<br />When is the next one due? Tomorrow I hope.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I think both men and women should read this. It has a story line, it isn't just sex. It kept me turning pages.
B000UAFDP2|5.0|The soundtrack can make or break a movie.  The soundtrack makes this one.  Aside from absolutely believable effects, the music puts you there.  A very graphically violent film (I have no clue how they pull this off on TV), editing would have to be very close to the spoof of The Sopranos on Mad TV.  (Definitely look that up, if you were a fan of The Sopranos)
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I really like this app. I played it at midnight with the lights off and it was creepy. This app is great for sleepovers pranks or just to get scared.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great fun for all kids of animal lovers time waiting for things to load,good graphics, like any dimming stuff game, enjoyable mundane
B00992CF6W|3.0|I hope someday it has infinite worlds and working Redstone it needs mods too thanks for wasting your time on this review
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I am a very slow reader but had this one done in a few days.  It really kept my attention and interest.  I was anxious to see the movie too which is different from the book.  Both were great!
B00321MGPG|5.0|planet earth is excellent, there are no other documentaries that are done in the same manner ,really a must see for anyone that cares a litte about our planet
B00899F0G8|5.0|I was behind on this show and needed to catch up. This was a cheap effective way to do it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A visual feast.  Superbly written.  Wonderfully developed characters who capture your attention immediately.  Historically fascinating and an entertaining look at English life
B008XG1X18|5.0|Some of of these complaints are just ridiculous; if the pins on your board don't interest you, use the search button to find something that does interest you. It actually doesn't require a Facebook/Twitter account, just an email, which makes sense as they will email you when someone follows you or repinns something of yours. To pin something, you can create a new pin, or just repin someone else's pin. To repin something, click on the picture and when it pops up, simply press the red rejoin button on the bottom left hand corner.
1616550414|5.0|This was so much more than I expected and I love it. From the cover to the beautiful pages to the information included, I was blown away. Definitely worth the money and a must have!
0452273331|5.0|excellent book, great sharp way of writing, amazing depth to stuff written . I didn't finish it though so I don t know if is all like this :))
B00B2064IY|5.0|This album is a testament to his creative genius. There are moments of jazz, blues, funk, and experimentation that hint at musical directions that are now common place but at the time of these last recordings very forward thinking. We could say Hendrix was ahead of his time, but he is truly for all time.
B009CF3MEK|4.0|This was very insteresnting, I read the book like most others in high school, and it fowlled the story line, good acting too.
B002L9N4F6|5.0|a nice boxset but maybe too simple in design. worthy buying at this price but can't campare with the edition released in Spain.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Loved the book!  So upset that one of my very favorite characters had to die!  Oh, I'm mad at you, Mr. Martin!  There had better be a good reason!!<br />Please hurry up and finish next two-in-one books.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|The scene of the airplane going down was riveting. Denzel did an outstanding job in this roll; he portrayed a very realistic struggle with alcohol. A must see movie!
0345803485|1.0|Well, there are several hours of my life I will never get back.  In the beginning, I was actually into the story, curious to see where it was going.  Then, I realized how Anastasia was written to mirror Bella Swan and how irritating she is.  I have no words for how much I absolutely hate both of those characters.  There is absolutely no spark in Ana that would make a gorgeous, young, bazillionaire want her - seriously, what's the appeal?<br /><br />Next, there's a a creepy, stalkerish, abusive relationship that is painted as a dom/sub to make it sound okay.  It's not okay.  Every time I hear a lady say that she wants her very own Christian Grey I throw up in my mouth a little.  Really?  You want a controlling, physically abusive, psychologically damaged guy?  Here...have one of my ex-boyfriends, a few of them fit that description just without the enormous bank account.<br /><br />Ana is weak, incredibly insecure to the point where I kind of wished Christian would go postal and off her character.  How could she find this man endearing?  He shows up on the other side of the country when she goes to visit her mom, pretty much tries to drive a wedge between her and any friendships she has, has a tracker on her phone so he knows where she is at all times...and she doesn't go running to the hills?  Dumb girl.<br /><br />Let's discuss the overuse of words, shall we?  If I never hear the words \\"Oh my\\", \\"Holy crap, ****, etc.\\", \\"Inner goddess\\", and \\"Down there\\" ever again, it will be a beautiful life for me.<br /><br />Stepping off my soapbox and reading some Charlaine Harris to try and erase this all from my memory.
B009NNG202|2.0|I could not get into this book, it was just so boring and not well written, all in all not a good read.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Wonderful modern day adaption of the original - great photography and editing of a superbly written and acted script.  Perfect casting.  Planning to watch several more times
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like the new update because there are baby animals and for your next update can u guys let us build our own tools and wepons wen we use the crafting table.

B007PKDW44|4.0|I just bought this album, I'd only heard a few songs on the radio before and am looking forward to listening to the rest of the album.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Outlander is one of my favorite books and I love the series. I enjoyed this installment because of the life on the Ridge. I also liked Brianna and Roger being fleshed out as characters.  The way other characters view Claire is also interesting. Good edition to the series.
B008645YEE|5.0|Like the movie, this soundtrack is excellent and inspiring!  You can really picture the scenes when you hear this soundtrack.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love the mix of fantasy and reality. it is like watching a fairy tale story in a tv show.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love the series.  Can't wait to finish this season and go on to season 3.  Characters are absolutely delightful to watch
B00991TCOG|5.0|The CD arrived in a timely fashion, however, I wish a few extra minutes were put into the packaging because when the case arrived it was broken. Granted the CD was not harmed, but still.
B00942X8PY|5.0|This game will make you think especially in later levels. The object of the game is to fill in all empty space with color.<br /><br />The negative reviews are uncalled for because the game is what it needs to be with no unnecessary bells and whistles.<br /><br />Instructions: Notice the number on the block. You push the block in 1 continuous snake. You will need to fill all empty space. You do not need to fill obstacles. You will eventually find levels that tell you what color must be used. There is a level reset button and a level select. Complete the puzzles for time and enjoy yourself.<br /><br />My young sons love the early levels. I love the more difficult ones.<br /><br />This does have very simple graphics and '80s sci-fi background music. If you have a problem with the simplicity, move on and play something else.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|For season three to come out.  Dragons, dragons, zombies?!  Oh yeah I like this very much!  Bring it on season 3!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I  have lots of fun with this game. I can be a bit challenging at times but it is always fun to play and has great graphics.
B0029LCJJS|3.0|the movie is good but the stream is very intermittant.  It plays for about 5-10 min and then stops playing,
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Nice concept. Very simple but very scary. Like playing a horror flick. Will make you jump. Not for the faint of heart
1932100660|5.0|and now you have the facts, instead of doctors prescribing harmful drugs, how bout them prescribing a healthy diet and a ban on chemically induced high sugar, high fat processed foods.
B009P5S11G|5.0|All songs are hypnotic!  Rihanna is getting better each time, and no matter the song, she turns it into a hit!
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This is a very addictive game!Happy I decided to purchase the whole game. I only wish it had more levels or at least was longer. All in all I am very happy with it!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|little confusing but fun once you get use to it. wish there was instructions or maybe I'm blind. my kids like it
1616550414|4.0|One of the best ideas I could have ever had was buying this book. The only thing I would have preferred is less focus on the last game and a bit more on the previous games. Must have for a Zelda fan
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|The game was enjoyable.  I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a challenge.  I was easy to play and kept my interest in this mysterious game.
B0052SF6CM|4.0|Great songs, this guy shows us that he is no one hit wonder with this cd.  Dance, dance, dance, dance!
B003DZX44I|5.0|Was so very broken hearted when my old VHS tape broke when I went to introduce my Granddaughter to her Mom's favorite movie from her childhood.  Was extremely happy that I was able to find it on Amazon and share it with sweet Granddaughter.  Now she loves it as much as her mom did.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it is a very fun game and it is very addictive..... I can never put it down I lovely it!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. Very memorable characters and just an awesome all around story. I didn't want the book to end.

0525953728|5.0|My 16 yr. old son ordered this book and read it cover to cover.  He absolutely loved the book.  And he hardly ever reads books just for pleasure!  My son told me he is going to keep this book forever.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|We bought this as a Valentine Day gift for my grandaughter.  She is crazy about Monster High.  She could not stop thanking us.  It made our Valentine Day.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is so fun you must get it full of excitement the best free game I've played.you need to get it it's totally worth it. I like how it changes the outfits to fit what special occasion it is. Very competitive and a real good game to play

B009B4ZEKM|3.0|Not a comeback at all yet, what's going on xtina?  It seems The Voice did not help her find a voice yet.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|I saw this movie in 3D at Christmas, at the Shaw Center IMAX theatre in downtown Singapore. It was one of the most incredible movie experiences of my life. I had read the book several years ago, and wondered if the movie could even come close to the visual portrait painted in the book. It surpassed all expectaitons. I can't wait to see this 3D blu ray at home. It's well worth the wait.
0345803485|5.0|I heard so much about the book trilogy. I loved the story line. And I love want this book makes me feel.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is awesome and I play it all the time. I think it is very cool that the inspector is a rabbit for Easter
B00BESM14U|3.0|In a word I would call this movie \\"Depressing\\".<br /><br />I didn't read the book and I had no forewarning about the plot other than it was a high school coming of age movie.  I thought it would be sweet or quirky, and it was all that in the beginning, but as the movie progressed the plot got deeper and darker and downright unsettling.  The movie had me up half the night worrying about child molesters, pedophiles, and other such human monsters.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong I thought the acting and directing were great; it was just the subject matter that threw me.  I was expecting The Breakfast Club and I got Law & Order: Special Victims Unit.<br /><br />*** Spoiler Alert - Ending is Revealed ***<br /><br />At the start of the movie you think the main character's depression is caused by his best friend's suicide.  As the plot thickens you are lead to believe that Charlie's depression is the result of his Aunt's death on Christmas Eve.  Then you find out that both the Aunt and the lead female character were molested as children.  At the end it is revealed that the Aunt (who was abused as a child) was abusing the 6 year old Charlie.  (Just guessing about his age.)  Charlie spirals down further into depression, attempted suicide and is finally placed in a mental hospital.  He is released eventually and returns to life.  The movie ends on a high note with Charlie back with his supportive and loving friends.<br /><br />Almost every character in the movie had deep, dark emotional and physical scaring, but the movie did have some funny moments.  The Rocky Horror Picture Show brought back a lot of fond memories as did the soundtrack.  Loved hearing \\"Come On Eileen\\".  Seeing all the old technology: cassette tapes, vinyl records, and clunker cordless phones was also a kick.<br /><br />So, like most movies, it had it good points and its bad points.  But here is a warning/recomendation, if you don't like depressing movies (ie movies that are brutally true to life) give this one a pass.e a pass.
B009LA1R34|4.0|Not too impressed.  I was expecting a bit more from Thalia.  She reinvented herself into a balladist unplugged artist, which its ok, but the songs are just not too great to me.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Has classic bad boy appeal with the backup of the good guy flirting on the side lines.  Some recklessness and passion add to the heat.  Easy to read and devour in a weekend.
0345803493|5.0|I love the plot of the story. Started to skip over the sex part it is getting to be over doing it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game because it is very fast paced and exciting. I love it also because the characters are different and hilarious.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I started with the pilot and was instantly hooked.  Finished the full season 1 series in 3 days... this series is very well done and completely addicting.  Excellent storyline, acting and characters.  So darned original.  Jessica Lange is amazing. Can't wait to see Season 2!
B009DKFSUA|4.0|Pretty good as usual.  The song with Christina is the one that stands out the most to me, but overall always fun with Pit!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Still working cold cases and his usual persistence pays off.  A good read, easy to follow story line with twist and turns..
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|This movie I bought for my grandson fr his birthday and love is, just like most of Disney movie he like.

1616550414|5.0|Wonderful acquisition. A quality product that every Zelda fan should have in their collection, and the price is excellent.<br />Recommend buying.
0345803507|5.0|By the time I got to this book, I had condition to skip over the sex part of the book. I love the story part of the book.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|have been looking for this for a long time its every thing that I hoped it would be. hope to find more like it in the future. thank you
B00992CF6W|5.0|There is one bad thing, and that is that you can't have a minecart, but other than that, haters, get a life
B009EP3DJM|4.0|I'm surprised with the quality of her ballads, I don't think she had ballads in her previous cd, so great job!
B0013D6LEM|5.0|How could anyone rightly give this album anything but 5 stars?  I was never a huge Michael Jackson fan, but this album is still one of my favorites!  We use it in our fitness classes, it brings back lots of memories from my younger days, but is still relevant today.
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|This movie is different with Robert De Niro being the good guy in the movie. This movie you see it through a child eyes.
140053271X|5.0|Very light weight and charge lasts a long time.  Paper like screen easy on the eyes.  Great for just reading.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i &lt;3 this game! its kind of like temple run, but a bit different. i think its cool to have the different themes
B008G12ERC|5.0|This is a very theatrical album and I love it.  Rock opera is here to stay!  All songs are superb.
B009IU6N5Y|4.0|Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal... But they never said anything about vampires... Years before he set off to become one of our nation's greatest leaders, Abraham Lincoln stalked the night in search of the bloodthirsty vampire that took his mother's life. After discovering the dark secret that connects the slave trade to the vampires' food source, Lincoln trades in his axe for a prominent position in politics, where his words serve as a far greater weapon against his undead adversaries. ABRAHAM LINCOLN: VAMPIRE HUNTER brings Seth Grahame-Smith's historic monster mash-up to the screen in a big way, with all of the overblown action sequences and wild special effects that make for fun, over-the-top summer blockbuster. While the deadpan humor may turn off many audience members that were expecting a parody or spoof, what makes it so oddly entertaining is that it isn't a comedy. It is played perfectly straight to the point of absurdity, earning big laughs along the way as Abe twirls his axe with deadly proficiency and carries himself like the Civil War's \\"Rambo.\\" A finer actor couldn't have been chosen over Benjamin Walker, who puts in an excellent performance as the President. The vicious vampires are just as dark as the humor as well, although Rufus Sewell does not present a memorable villain as their leader, Adam. The main issue with the film lies in the aforementioned action sequences, which become far too grandiose for a period piece of this kind. What worked perfectly well in Timur Bekmambetov's earlier films, NIGHT WATCH and DAY WATCH, reduces the imagery on screen to an over-stylized sense of cartoon violence, where a subtler approach would have benefited the character greatly. Still, there is plenty to enjoy in the unwritten history of old Honest Abe.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
B005GFPZYK|5.0|You can read all you want about the military and war. This book gives you a true look inside what is going on. Kyle doesn't sugarcoat it and at times I found myself cringing at what he wrote. But that is what this book is about. The truth that so many people will never understand.<br /><br />Very emotional especially after his death last month. A lot of the book is foreshadowing almost and your heart breaks for his wife and family. God bless the Kyle family and our military.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I would like to state that his musical is a 'sung-through' musical, which means, well, it's sung-through! there are less than 100 words of dialogue in this film and for some reason people cannot wrap their head around that. Les Miserables has always been a sung-through musical, I don't understand why people cannot get that. Yes, there is little dialogue. Yes, there is a lot of singing. Yes, it's worth watching.
B00AFEXRME|1.0|ADDENDUM 9-21-2016 I just saw the movie &#34;Sully&#34; in the theater.  &#34;Sully&#34; has a similar plot to &#34;Flight&#34;, but of course, &#34;Sully&#34; is a true story.  &#34;Sully&#34; is infinitely more interesting and engaging and a great alternative to this depressing movie, &#34;Flight&#34;            A soaring disappointment.  A morose story of a drunk who keeps getting drunk.  It's filled with caricatures of &#34;horrible Christians&#34; like the ungrateful, incompetent, evangelizing co-pilot ( a good Georgia boy) and his hate-filled born-again Christian wife.  And a very, very thin veneer of redemption.  Yes, in the end, he realizes he's a drunk; I guess that's what you call dramatic irony. And it's only the 50th movie this year to have the Rolling Stones' &#34;Gimme Shelter&#34; in the sound track? - completely lame. The movie sucked.
B0030B624E|3.0|All it takes is a few simple rules to survive Zombieland, the world that has been left behind after a deadly virus turns most of the population in to flesh-eating monsters. At least that is how Columbus has managed to stay alive up until he teams with Tallahassee on the road home to find his parents. The two are taken hostage by a pair of crafty sisters along the way, who convince them to travel together to the Pacific Playland amusement park in Los Angeles, which is supposed to be a safe haven from zombies. Needless to say, they are in for a bumpy ride! What is perhaps the most irritating thing about ZOMBIELAND besides the annoying characters and directionless plot is the fact that there are hardly any zombies in it to begin with. Why travel cross-country on the chance that some mythical amusement park might be zombie-free when the group only encounters a few zombies in the first place? The survival rules would have been much funnier if they had not already been used years before in Max Brook's infinitely superior Zombie Survival Guide. Jesse Eisenberg proves that he is the poor man's Michael Cera by offering up another wimpy performance with worse comedic timing than ever. Emma Stone is just as bad, and can't be taken seriously in her role. Thankfully, Woody Harrelson comes along to provide us with some temporary relief as the Twinkie-starved Tallahassee, who takes a great deal of pleasure in dispensing pain. The climactic battle at Pacific Playland is short-lived, and hardly worth the wait when the excitement of fighting zombies at an amusement park is squandered on a few measly rides. With the exception of the film's one notable cameo, ZOMBIELAND is a laughless comedy with hardly any horror that is not nearly as clever or witty as it is commonly made out to be.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
B0086700CM|4.0|I Really like playing this game! It is so much fun and a great way to pass the time. the only reason I didn't give it 5 is because it really lags sometimes and it can get kind of annoying. But other than that it is Really, Really, fun!

B003Y5H5EW|3.0|After learning of their existence, the humans have set out to destroy all vampires and werewolves, save for a few specimens that they plan to use for biological testing. Selene, the vampire death-dealer, awakens 12 years after being captured to discover that she now has a daughter, a vampire/werewolf hybrid who is the last of the Covinus line. Together, they are the only hope for survival for their dying breed! 'UNDERWHELMING' is a better title for the third entry in this struggling series, which places action and special effects ahead of story and character in another pointless chapter. AWAKENING is the least favorable of any of the sequels, boasting the worst looking computerized creatures yet in a tiring display of cartoon violence. The mythology between the two clans that once captivated audiences seems like an afterthought now as the direction of the series becomes increasingly unclear. The addition of teen star India Eisley as Eve seems questionable in a hard \\"R\\" Horror film, especially if she is to become the focus of future entries. Kate Beckinsale may look good in black, but she phones in another emotionless performance as Selene. Måns Mårlind and Bj&ouml;rn Stein successfully maintain the same style and tone as the other films, but their eye for action is found lacking. While UNDERWORLD: AWAKENING may not be the end of the series, another sequel like this will surely bury it.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
B007HC3LHS|5.0|All in all, this book was fantastic. I never knew which way it was going, which of course lead to me reading it within 24 hours. The twists, turns, darkness and strength of a very strong woman. It was truly very good.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|A great match 3 game. Very fun and addicted.  Fun to build village.<br /> Hard to stop playing. Well worth buying.

B005FUTBWS|4.0|Three teens become the unsuspecting hostages of an extremist religious cult after accepting an online invitation for sex in the explosive thriller, RED STATE. Kevin Smith moves away from comedy in a daring and frighteningly realistic social commentary that serves as a vehement strike against the current domestic policy in America. With the events following 9/11 and the Westboro Baptist Church fresh in mind, Smith not only attacks the fanaticism of mindless religious zealots, but also the media's role in perpetuating their actions and our government's questionable response to domestic terrorism that is taken under martial law. Michael Parks plays the part of the Reverend Abin Cooper with all of the charm and charisma of a narcissistic psychopath and cult leader, making it easy to see how his simpleminded followers could easily be drawn to violence \\"in the name of the Lord.\\" John Goodman is in fine form as well as Joseph Keenan, the leader of the military task force that descends upon Cooper's secluded farmhouse. He stands as the voice of reason against an uncaring government bureaucracy that is only concerned with eliminating the social threat with no care towards collateral damage. The rough filming and raw violence create a sense of ultra-realism on screen, while Smith's cynical sense of humor comes through brilliantly in the script (particularly in Keenan's final debriefing). RED STATE is a thought-provoking thriller, to say the least, and a refreshingly original entry in the genre.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B008220C56|5.0|Anna Karenina was in my opinion the best picture of the year! The highly stylized film was masterful in presentation. The acting was flawless! The editing paced the movie in a very exciting way. The period costumes were luxurious and elegant. Kiera Knightly was magnificent in the title role. Forget Les Miserable. This was the real gem!!!

B00AWTTUHI|5.0|Great movie.  Parts 1 and 2 are, at this point, the most interesting DC productions I have seen this far.<br />I can't recommend both episodes enough and find myself hungry for more productions of this caliber or a part 3,<br />at the very least.<br /><br />Although I was skeptical of Peter Weller as Batman, he pretty much knocked it out of the park. Nicely done Pete.<br />Honestly, the entire production exceeded all my expectations.  I absolutely loved the way they used the<br />longstanding, strained relationship between Batman and Superman.  It takes the mood of the Justice League<br />series and movies, fast forwarded it to the point of the characters being aged, added the dark truth of reality<br />and really made it work.<br /><br />My only regrets are that I only have five stars to offer AND see no indication of a part 3. The end of<br />part 2 could really go in many interesting directions.<br /><br />By the way, the choice for the persona of president was hysterical and just too much fun. I was surprised and<br />delighted.  Far be it from me to be a spoiler.  If you are not a pup, I think most will find it surprising and<br />quite funny.<br /><br />Although this one will be hard to match, I look forward to seeing more DC movies of if this nature<br />and caliber. I believe it would have wide appeal to long-term fans like myself and, while a younger audience<br />might not \\"get\\" everything, the edgy nature of the movie should appeal to them equally well.<br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />bw
B0012FHGCW|5.0|It was an amazing movie. I enjoyed it very much. Heart wrenching tho, that's for sure. I watched it twice!
0802473156|1.0|This was recommended to me by a therapist as we were having marital problems. My now ex-husband latched onto acts of service and decided that would fix everything. This book wasn't even close to helping in the first place then muddled everything up even more. The real issue got further lost with a therapist backing the book. I thought it was stupid if asking me if he could pick up something from the store on his way home ( being an act of service) would fix things. Don't waste your time. This was the last nail in the coffin for my marriage.

0525478817|5.0|John Green is a monster from the hell dimension Lacrimosa who exists only to bring soul-wracking anguish into the homes of the literate.<br /><br />I knew within a page that this was a book about Cancer Kids, having only picked it up because I kept reading quotes from it that I wish I had written. I don't like cancer as a plot device. Cancer is writing porn, like talking about 9/11 or the Holocaust. It's too effortless, too much emotion because of the condition which frees up the author to be lazy. Once a character is described as having cancer, the reader knows someone is going to be dead in the next hundred pages and they are going to cry. Here, we have three characters, all who had or have cancer, so the odds are against this being a lighthearted romp. Green seems to be aware of the limitations of this genre when he provides the metatextual criticism of a novel his main character likes, saying, &#34;This isn't a cancer book, because cancer books suck.&#34; (John Green seems to be all about winking at the reader, as when Hazel later says, &#34;I think you’re a pathetic alcoholic who says fancy things to get attention like a really precocious eleven-year-old and I feel super bad for you.&#34;) I figured that, understanding the genre and its tropes, I would be more or less inoculated against the worst of what he could throw at me.<br /><br />Never have I been so wrong. I read the book straight through between panels I did at No Such Convention. I do not recall the last time I cared enough about a book - or more wanted a book to be over - than this one. Not quite halfway in, I began bawling, &#34;If I keep reading, someone is going to die.&#34; Amber wanted more clarification, but I was reduced to making quiet walrus sounds and just thrust the book at her. This is something that occur several times throughout the novel.<br /><br />Spoilers: Someone dies. This does not end the book because we have not suffered enough for John Green of Lacrimosa. Not human sufferingcan ever be enough.<br /><br />My main criticism is that, despite how many times his characters mock how cancerous people behave in books and movies, every teen in this books seems to have metastasized Diablo Codyitis. These are some precocious kids, ones who toss around words like &#34;hamartia&#34; as though most teen know about tragic flaws and literary criticism. Obnoxiously precocious when it comes to one-legged bone cancer sufferer Augustus Waters, who keeps a pack of cigarettes that he does not light but will occasionally put in his mouth, using the twee logic that it is important to put the instrument of death in your mouth but not give it the power to kill you. Our poor protagonist, Hazel, was damned to fall in love with him from his introduction. And yes, the novel is a bit masturbatory, as characters pause to make sure the reader understand how special everyone is, with lines like, &#34;You are so busy being you that you have no idea how utterly unprecedented you are.&#34; I didn't really mind it. This books is overall a good metaphor for what its characters are experiencing. You come to love unreal characters you know had very exact deadlines.<br /><br />You get pretty much what you should expect out of this book. Yes, it is a bit cloyingly clever at times and things work out in a cinematic rather than realistic fashion. There should be a sticker on the front reading &#34;This novel brought to you by the Amsterdam Tourism Board&#34;. As long as one doesn't expect it to closely follow the edicts of reality - as long as you accept it as its own world - it is exhaustingly enjoyable, one of the most exquisite literary experiences I have enjoyed in years. So long as you know words like &#34;numinous&#34;, you may well feel the same.<br /><br />Ideally, it should come boxed with tissues and the number of a trained and well-read crisis counselor. I was not quite the same for days afterward.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I've become an avid fan of the series.  Having my own copy will allow me to watch an episode whenever I want.  Am looking forward to future seasons.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|It's a good game overall, but you need more maps, more scenes, (as in a better death than all static) and try to put a stir a behind it. Also, when I was playing in easy, he kept spawning right in front of me, if you fix/add those, I'll give it 5 stars.

B0041OT9W6|5.0|The book was great and entertaining, but the readings do not tell you that you must pay for every so many pages. This should be more clear for the payer! 4.00 can really add up!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This book took forever to finish and was incredibly slow. I really dont think it was a fair end to the series
B006FE83U4|5.0|Bought it for a birthday present. She really liked it. I love this movie, so that is why I got it for her.

0307950689|2.0|This might be the most disappointing book I have ever read.  The DaVinci Code was magic.  Oh sure, the history wasn't exactly spot on, but it was a thrilling read.<br />The Lost Symbol just meandered its way to nowhere.  Then just when I was relieved it was finally over, it went on another 50 pages.  Ouch.
B009GED3HS|5.0|How I Met Your Mother is one of the best she's around! I could watch old episodes over and over again. It's the Seinfeld of my generation. Season 8 is wrapping up the question we've been as,ing for 8 years and I can't wait to see hw it all ends!
B008M7BQHE|5.0|I got into the show during the 3RD season.  I have gone back and wathced the entire series from the begining.  Playback is easy and seamless through prime instant video.  My only wish is that they come out with an android app for prime videos.

0987358200|5.0|This is an excellent book for anyone who is exploring their spiritual journey and no longer finds a comfortable home in any of the world's religions. Perhaps you consider yourself agnostic or atheist or polytheist, or you have been shopping religions over the course of your life, this story is Darrin Mason's very personal, inspired, and relate-able journey on coming to terms with the soul having a human experience. Why am I here? What is the point? He communicates with the part of himself that is essentially all of us - the Universe - and shares the dialogue through a series of 60 plus fundamental questions. Each question begs the next. In the end, it is really about how loving you are, being true to your path, and enjoying the journey. We all make mistakes and we all have baggage. We also have the opportunity to push the reset button to learn, share, and evolve to create greater inner peace for ourselves and for those in our lives willing to receive that peace. It is never too late. If you want a personally accessible conversation with yourself about your spiritual journey, or know someone who could benefit from the conversation, then this is a book that you will find helpful to read and share. Blessings on your quest.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is honestly one of the best books I've ever read.  I've read many books that make me feel like crying, but only a handful that have actually made me cry. This book had me crying in several times...happy and sad tears.  The subject matter was intense, but honest. It happens, unfortunately.  Do yourself a favor and read this book.

Only problem i see is battery lasts 10 hours or a little longer which isnt a big deal since i work 10 hours but it does die out some days.  I still cant knock it for that cause its amazing the volume control is so perfect and it doesn't get hot ipod is hotter than this amp!

B005COO1X6|4.0|Keep me away from the wisdom which does not cry, the philosophy which does not laugh, and the greatness which does not bow before children.  King lives this, as always, in his writings and in the stories from which we witness the amazing mind of children.  He reminds us to see, again.
B00003W8NM|5.0|yep
0385738765|2.0|The plot and overall story of this book is very interesting and well thought out, but my major complaint about this book is that the main character seems to have the mental ability of an angry 11 year old girl.  While this would be fine if he was an 11 year old girl, he is supposed to be about 16. I also felt that many of the main characters were severely underdeveloped, and flat, while any minor character involved was almost, if not completely overlooked. While i suppose personality is a subjective issue, the other big problem i had with this book was its use of similes and metaphors. When well written and thought out similes and metaphors add a lot to a story, in this case overall they felt childish. Lastly i had some issues with the authors use of repetition in this book. If you say something, and wish to reiterate it a few sentences later, it is best to word it slightly differently. especially if you plan on doing it over and over again.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Enjoying this book so far as it is a part of the on-going story with Percy Jackson. Definitely recommend this book!

B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Inspiring and highly applicable to every day interpersonal transactions, from asking your child to do homework to making everything personal - there is a person at the receiving end of our actions and how will they be better off because if this?  Focusing on Listening skills and application of improv techniques all improve how we move others  The exercises are a bonus. Excellent read!

B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app really does the job. You can see easily the battery charging and know when the kindle is fully charged. It also tells you how my time you have for watching movies, reading and other functions that the kindle performs. It's simple and clear.
0062014536|3.0|There is nothing more I can say in this review that the other reviewers haven't said already. I have given the book a generous(in my opinion) three stars due to the fact that the previous two were amazing. I am all up for open ended conclusions that leave it to the readers interpretation, however I can't help but feel uneasy about this one. We get absolutely NO closure on ANY character. Is Fred dead? What is going to happen between Julian and Lena? Where is Tack? What is to become of the resistance?......and for God sake where is Hanna walking too?! All these answers and more...NEVER. I have hope that the TV show will pull a Dragon Ball GT and veer away from the books conclusion to give us the ending we want.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|I enjoyed the movie,especially the format in which it was presented, my only problem was that I picked the wrong time of day to watch it & fell asleep while watching it. I would look for the same style of movie again, & would recommend it to anyone who asks.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Closes sometimes, has a few times when you canst send the message or post something, but most og the time this app is alright for me.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I have kept up with this series since the beginning.  If you have not seen it from the beginning yet, check out the season collection at Netflicks - much cheaper option.
1451696191|4.0|I love this book. Loved Charlie. Such a likeable character that I found I had a great connection to. It was a simple read. Teenagers trying to survive the pressures of school, relationships, love, hormones and the concept of entering adulthood. It's moving. Charlie is faced with a lot of challenges that sees his character developing throughout the book. The characterisation is very believable. You have characters from all walks of life. It has moments of happiness and sadness. It's a brilliant read. Really captures the essence of kidulthood. I look forward to reading it again someday.
B009MF56GC|4.0|Your favorite action stars, cheesy one liners and indulgent violence; if your a fan of 80's action movies Expendables II will not let you down!<br /><br />Though, the movie is not perfect by any means. It has a fairly simple and somewhat predictable plot that is just barely enough to set in motion the events of the film. This makes it a bit of a bumpy ride at times and the first go around you may wonder if this movie is even worth watching-that is until you see the final 20 minutes of the film. The ending is absolutely perfect and incredibly satisfying for 80's action fans. I dont want to spoil anything but lets just say it involves the three biggest action stars of the 80's joining forces against the enemy in an all out death match, not to be missed!<br /><br />So while the movie is a bit sloppy it still has its bright patches that make it all worthwhile. Chuck Norris' cameo is done with surprising expertise featuring self satire, the action does not disapoint and the last act is pure 80's action perfection!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I would recommend this to those of us that have Kindles to read from and everything, then we can share what we are doing with our followers!
B003VXMMTK|3.0|This presentation was good on my kindle fire for airplane travel - it made the time pass by.  Not much of a pleasant story and holds a tragic ending.  Aging these actors due to the stress of their situation really did not go over very well.
0439023521|3.0|This was a good read. I must say, it took me a while to get into it as I felt the preparation for the actual Hunger Games took up most of the book and slowed the pace a bit. The characters were well crafted, and I especially liked the budding relationship between Katniss and Peeta. It felt authentic. The story just didn't grab me as I had hoped it would have, but it was still a good read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The characters were so likable and real. They were different too, I loved that Sky was home schooled. And Holder wasn't really a bad guy. Great romance!<br /><br />Some of the plot was predictable but I did NOT see some of it coming. I seriously read it in one reason. I was planning to go to bed but when THAT was revealed, yeah... I was up until 4! I really enjoyed it and it seemed deeper than some NA novels I've read. I even cried a little bit and it's been a while since I've done that with a book.<br /><br />I recommend it for romance and NA readers!
B006FK7SZ4|5.0|Not much to say really... notifications not too bad... also, it doesn't close itself and It's fairly easy to navigate!
B005HEPS6A|5.0|Great show with great characters that you can really get attached to.  This season is better than seasons 1&2. A must see!
0062238868|5.0|As a member of the Patriot Guard I had the honor of attending his funeral. A day or so later I ordered his book and couldn't wait to read it. I was not disappointed. He was a warrior through and through. As I read his account, I served in the Marines back in the 70's and didn't have a first hand account of either Iraq wars, I could get a good mental imagine of what they faced on a daily bases. I loved his first person view of things, not filtered through someone's PC filter. He seemed to \\"come alive\\" during combat and had a true love of the Marines fighting the war. I feel this, in part, lead to his death. His strong desire to help the combat vet and especially a troubled Marine. Someone needed to tell his story, I was glad it was him.  I hope America never runs out of men like him.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|WORTH THE MONEY, any Nicholas Sparks movie is a classic. Miley Cyrus's acting, however.... not so great. But the plot & story line is just wonderful :)
B008GXHOFW|5.0|There's no curse words in the game and I am glad. Some levels are hard but I can handle it. The price is totally worth it<br />that's cool.<br />I have friends who love it and my mom loves it too.

B008JFUN8C|4.0|L. Frank Baum would have a conniption fit! Never in his wildest dreams (and I'll bet his were pretty wild) could he have imagined such a mind-bending, visual orgy! We are treated to a combination of PG-rated, Computer Generated overkill, truly scary flying monsters (waaaay worse than those flying monkeys in the original), a pep talk on teamwork and a lovely homage to the MGM classic (the title sequence and the first scenes set in a two-bit Kansas carnival are in black and white).<br /><br />As you probably already know, this prequel shows how a cheesy con man became the man behind the curtain.<br /><br />We see:<br />  * James Franco (\\"127 Hours\\") is Oscar Diggs, otherwise known as Oz, who is described as a \\"small-time magician with dubious ethics.\\" I liked his Scrooge McDuck dive into that tempting pile of gold.<br />  * Zach Braff (\\"Garden State\\") is our hero's sidekick, both as a much-abused human assistant in the black and white carnival and as a (cute but much-abused) flying monkey instructed to \\"Show up. Keep up. Shut up!\\" in Oz.<br />  * Mila Kunis (\\"Black Swan\\") eventually becomes Theodora, the Wicked Witch of the West. They worked it out so her profile is the same as Margaret Hamilton's in the original.<br />  * Rachel Weisz (\\"Agora\\") is Evanora, a witch I don't recall from the earlier movie, but I'm sure she must be in the Baum series. Somehow I skipped reading them when I was a child.<br />  * Michelle Williams (\\"My Week With Marilyn\\") is Annie, a young woman our hero is infatuated with in Kansas, but when she shows up as Glinda in Oz, he is confused.<br />  * Bill Cobbs (\\"The Muppets\\") is the handyman/tinkerer who becomes essential to The Plan.<br />  * Joey King (\\"Ramona and Beezus\\") is the little crippled Kansas girl in the wheelchair (sad), and in Oz, the China doll with the broken legs (get it?).<br /><br />This is entertaining and colorful, but those flying beasts have fangs, the two evil witches shoot flaming missiles from their hands and the balloon ride is pretty scary. On the other hand, I appreciate the tribute to Thomas Alva Edison, the Wizard of Menlo Park. Amazon will notify me when the DVD is available so I can notify my folks at JayFlix.net.

B0002TKFGI|5.0|This album has one of the finest performances of Saint Saens Organ symphony and my favorite performance of the Debussy La Mer. Many people like Karajans performance of La Mer better, but I have a very strong feeling for the Debussy Idiom and I am a lover of the sea and I understand Munch's Interpretation and I can feel the salty air. I can see the sea lights and feel the ocean waves and watch the buoys rock back and forth when he plays. This is an impressionistic piece, but if one is attuned to impressionism, that person will feel the true masterpiece that Debussy has created and understand Munch's Interpretation.<br />The organ symphony is really a wonderful piece and one of Saint Saens' greatest works, and it is very underrated. My favorite interpretation is by Ormandy, Philadelphia Orch, and E.Power Biggs. But that recording is older and not as fine in detail as this one. This one has a slight french accent which is quite common in recordings of this work. There is much more to this work than the organ crescendos, but one must listen for a while to notice the strength of the piece overall. I fear my next statement will turn people off, but some of the lilting melodies in this piece were used during sentimental portions of the movie BABE.<br />The added piece by Ibert is not really in the same league as the others, but a wonderful addition, and no one played these lollipops better than Munch (other very good recordings came from vintage English conductors like Beecham and Barbirolli). The recording here in 3-channel SACD (rt, center, left) is astounding. Once again, thank you Charles.[[ASIN:B0002TKFGI Saint-Saëns: Symphony No. 3- Organ / Debussy: La Mer / Ibert: Escales (Ports of Call)]]
B00BN3EE1O|3.0|I guess I'd call this a PG-13 romance with an edge. We have attractive leads, mysterious pasts and dark secrets..... The book on which this is based is by Nicholas Sparks (\\"The Notebook\\") so it MUST be romantic, right? And there has to be an idyllic boat ride on a bayou...and two lovers caught in the rain. The movie is directed by Lasse Hallström (\\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\") so it will feel like real people in a real situation, with humorous bits tossed in just for fun. As you can tell, this was actually pretty good because we had plenty of people to root for.<br /><br />We watched:<br />  * Josh Duhamel (\\"Transformers,\\" \\"New Year's Eve\\" and lots of TV) as Alex, a widower of two years, helping his two youngsters cope with their loss and helping his uncle run a little grocery store/gas station/tackle shop in a North Carolina fishing village. BTW, this actor is really good with children!<br />  * Noah Lomax (Lots of TV) is Josh, his older child who remembers, and still misses, his mom.<br />  * Mimi Kirkland in her first movie role, is Lexie, the younger child who only remembers the idea of her mother. She's a precocious, loyal little busybody.<br />  * Julianne Hough (\\"Rock of Ages\\" and \\"Footloose\\") is Katie, fleeing for her life from Boston and trying to find a safe haven beyond the reach of her pursuer.<br />  * Cobie Smulders (\\"The Avengers\\") is Jo, the lovely neighbor who befriends our heroine.<br />  * David Lyons (Lots of TV) is either a cop, an abandoned husband, or both.<br /><br />There are plenty of other characters, but time does not permit... I could have done without some of the bucolic photography, but it was only 115 minutes. Suffice it to say, this had no profanity and some chaste love making, but had a real nail-biter of a climax and a totally unexpected twist...plus Duhamel is VERY easy on the eye! Your DVD from Amazon will allow you to back up and look again.
B00633PFQC|4.0|We need someone like Professor Sandel to guide us not to commit a wrong doing through his book. Humans have temptations!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This is a fun game if you like Sim Theme Park, and it will be very much worth your while.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was an easy read but hard to put down. I wanted to find out her story as much as she did. I loved the passion that the author was able to convey through Holder. The second time through I was able to just enjoy the ride without being so anxious to find out what was on the next page.
B009AMAJPA|4.0|A crime lord and a betrayal. Sounds like pretty standard R-rated stuff, but this cast is a cut above and as a result, it slipped up on my blind side. After a pretty standard shoot-em-up opening scene, to my surprise, I soon had people to root for and very much wanted them to survive to the final curtain.<br /><br />Danish director Niels Arden Oplev (\\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\") skillfully manipulates us into caring about two damaged people, one physically and one emotionally, as each tries to cope with the aftermath of a personal catastrophe.<br /><br />These folks made it happen:<br />  * Colin Farrell (\\"Seven Psychopaths\\") is an immigrant, a bright Hungarian engineer who is carrying emotional scars that demand payback. Of course, it's always interesting to watch a smart person tackle a tough problem and we often forget that Mr. Farrell is a wonderful actor.<br />  * Noomi Rapace (\\"Prometheus\\") is a (formerly) lovely beautician whose life changed instantly when she was hit by a drunken driver. Rapace is one of those amazing international stars who simply asks where her character is from and takes it from there.<br />  * Terrence Howard (\\"The Ledge\\") plays icy threats very, very well. This kingpin is being harried by some anonymous gangster and he wants it to stop!<br />  * Dominic Cooper (\\"My Week With Marilyn\\") is one of the violent gang who owes fealty to his leader, but also has a wife and child at home. London-born Mr. C. plays American so often, he may lose his natural accent.<br /><br />Make no mistake, there is a lot of gunfire, profanity and cruelty, but the audience was deeply invested in the outcome. In fact, at the conclusion there was a spatter of applause, which is rare in a screening. Captions will be a welcome addition when this is on DVD (from Amazon...smile...)
B007TK77QE|5.0|great characters..jk has captured every character.  she made me feel angry and sad for all of the characters at some stage. really enjoyed it..waiting for more of the same
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is Intriguing and fun to watch. Love the series and its depiction of British history. Would definitely recommend to anyone.
B00005K3O0|3.0|An impossibly young Anthony Hopkins, Marsha Mason and John Beck.  An 11-year-old girl is suddenly beset with nighmares and wakes her parents, Marsha Mason and John Beck, with her screams but can't remember her nightmares.  Mom and Dad notice a suspicious bearded Anthony Hopkins watching them and the girl at school and in their New York apartment.  He is reported to police who can't do anything until he physically harms someone, pre-stalking laws here.  He tells the parents that their daughter is the reincarination of his daughter who died in a horrific car accident on the day of their child's birth, which means that the soul of the dead child entered the body of the new baby born on the same day.  We see these actors when they were very young and realize they had to start somewhere.  Fortunately, the starting somewhere back then was better than many of todays so called stars starting somewhere.  We watched it because it was a free streaming movie available to Prime Members and it turned out to be a well acted movie.
B005LAIHUO|4.0|Here's a new take on an old tale. Rated PG-13 and directed by Bryan Singer (\\"X-Men\\"), this \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\" is well cast, visually exciting, and lots of fun. Computer Generated Imaging has made fantasy stories more and more fantastical; this one is mind-boggling.<br /><br />We admire:<br />  * Nicholas Hoult (\\"Warm Bodies\\") is resourceful and resolute as Jack, the nice young man who drops a magic bean and... \\"Uh oh,\\" gets it WET. Later, as he clambers up that amazing beanstalk, he admits he \\"doesn't much like heights.\\"<br />  * Eleanor Tomlinson (\\"Alice in Wonderland\\") is Isabel, an adventurous princess who finds waaaay more adventure than she bargained for.<br />  * Ian McShane (\\"Deadwood\\") is the king, ready to marry off his daughter to a much older man in order to achieve peace with a neighboring kingdom. But he pitches right in when his kingdom is under attack.<br />  * Stanley Tucci (\\"The Hunger Games\\") makes the perfect bridegroom/villain: ambitious, ruthless and cruel. Once he gets the magic crown, the wedding is off!<br />  * Ewan McGregor (\\"The Impossible\\") is our stalwart guardsman Elmont: organized, decisive and brave. It looks like McGregor enjoys being in a comedy for a change.<br />  * Bill Nighy (\\"About Time\\") is the lead Giant. He has a little spare head sitting on one shoulder, which offers another point of view.<br /><br />If you take a 12-year-old boy (the perfect demographic) reassure him that there is less than a minute of \\"mush.\\" Otherwise, it's slam-bang action, with lots of spears, arrows, horses, drawbridges, armor, swords, boiling oil, burning trees and other weapons of the middle ages.<br /><br />I can't think of a thing I would change; 114 minutes flew by. The battle scenes aren't too long, the giants are appropriately icky, our hero is valiant and the heroine is plucky. We all ducked when a crown bounced into the audience, but beyond that, the story is engaging enough that there should be no need to spring for the extra 3D charge, so a DVD from Amazon will do just fine.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I am very pleased with my purchase of this case for the Kindle fire.  It covers and protects the Kindle very well and the magnet that wakes up the device works whatever orientation I put it in the case.  The wide base lets you prop up the Kindle on a soft surface, like a bed or couch, which is where I usually use the Kindle anyway.  The kindle just seems naked and incomplete without a case, and this one works beautifully.
B00913DPW2|5.0|Best game I've ever purchased! Not your run of the mill game. Much more challenging than a hidden object game, which I don't feel it is.  Haven't found one as good yet, except for the Haunt II. Really wish there were more like it. I have never written a review before,  but this one deserves it!! Well worth the $.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I love this ap. Weather forecast anywhere I go at my fingertips. I especially like the 10 day forecast for any city.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Ben Affleck's reputation as a director continues to rise. This time he has tackled a story based on an amazing true event: The audacious rescue of six Americans who found shelter in the Tehran home of the Canadian Ambassador at the height of the Iranian Revolution in 1979. An outrageous scheme involving a fake movie with a fake Canadian crew sent to scout fake locations for a fake sci-fi film, \\"Argo,\\" was cooked up by a CIA disguise and exfiltration specialist, who, by the way, served as a real-life consultant on this R-rated thriller.<br /><br />These guys make this a nail-biter:<br />  * Ben Affleck (\\"The Town\\") is Tony Mendez, the actual hero of this outlandish story, so unbelievable it has to be true. Affleck almost overdoes the way he underplays his role.<br />  * Bryan Cranston (\\"Drive\\") is Jack O'Donnell, the profane boss back at Langley, trying to bridge the divide between the needs of his agent in the field and the incredulity of his superior officers.<br />  * Alan Arkin (\\"City Island\\") is Lester Siegel, a product of Hollywood: caustic wit, jaundiced world-view, and a world-class BS artist.<br />  * John Goodman (\\"The Artist\\") is make-up expert John Chambers, ever the sarcastic conniver, he is Mendez's link to the make-believe world that is essential to the success of this haywire idea.<br />  * Victor Garber (LOTS of TV) is Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor who, along with his courageous wife, shelters these terrified refugees week after week. You may be sure the American press remembered to thank Canada for this one!<br /><br />The cast is full of familiar faces, but the six hostages look distractingly real. Director Affleck's flawless blend of newsreel footage, video clips and staged riots make for a white-knuckle experience. Our exhausted screening audience applauded the end, but stayed for the VERY welcome postscripts about the participants.<br /><br />This is an excellent film based on a painful time in the recent past that many of us remember very, very well. I found the rioting populace to be particularly upsetting. To me, any gathering of fifty or more people is only half-a-zealot away from being a mob, so Affleck had me right where he wanted me! This one is confidently directed and capably acted; who could ask for anything more!<br /><br />I was thrilled to see Argo win \\"Best Picture\\" at the Academy Awards. This will soon be available on DVD from Amazon.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Kenny Loggins' latest partnership not only fulfills his dream, but mine as well - to have new KL music to listen to and share.<br />Georgia and Gary are a great addition - they are an awesome team - great blend! Love it!
B007REV4YI|5.0|The first James Bond film premier in 1962. Most were good some excellent and some fair. This one surprise me. One can see Daniel Craig is finally confortable in the role as James Bond. One can see the confidence, the stride and all the swagger that the producers wanted this character to have.<br />Of course with all James Bond films there is always the finding out who the \\"villian\\" is, why he is out to inflict pain on Bond  or the world and how to stop him.<br />But in this film there is an interesting subplot. Bond as well as \\"M\\" faced the dilemma of convincing their colleagues that they as well as their methods are not only still useful but necessary to thwart evil in today's techological world. You can't sit behind a computer and fight evil.<br />This is an action pack film that will have one riveting in their seat anticipating the next move and surprise when it is displayed on the screen. The special effects were fantastic, the colors vibrant and the sounds explosive.<br />If one is a James Bond \\"aficinonado\\" watch how the new actors are introduce to play \\"M\\" and Eve Moneypenny.
B00400NHRO|4.0|This book was written during the Watergate years, yet the fundamental issues it brings to light are still relevant, and still haven't been resolved.  Healthcare is, was, and may always be a mess.  We need more voices from the inside willing to write with this kind of honesty.
B007BLCGNU|4.0|This movie a great movie if your a fan of History flicks.  Once again Leonardo Dicaprio delivers an astounding performance.<br />Can't believe this guy hasn't won an Oscar yet.
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|i love gray's anatomy. it my fav show. i watch it over and over and over and over and over.
B004XZR63M|5.0|This book is an excellent resource in widening my horizon in dealing with money. This open my mind from getting off the Rat Race. As I progress, with the next book, investing in how to mind my own business and in knowing how to make money work for me, I will be on my way toward financial freedom.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|Season four is a must see. This is where the introduction and the reveal of the overarching plot that the first three seasons has been hinting at. Angels are introduced and the brothers' relationship is the rockiest it's ever been so far. Lilith is a terrifying villain and angels usually aren't any better than the demons they oppose. As the special features, this is the season that has many of my favorites. Definitely, this a season that is a must watch for any fan of the show.
B00A1XIXM8|4.0|This latest Bad Religion album does not disappoint. The band sticks to their punk rock roots and deliver an awesome album,<br />As soon as listen to it, your wanting to catch them Live at the House of Blue or Hollywood Palladium, which I can not wait for!
B007HO392S|5.0|i love carrie underwood song. my fav is blow away  and two black cales which is on this cd, cool
B007SGM084|5.0|I do not usually read this type of book, but I do love it.  Christian is a very sick man.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I put off watching for a long time because the ads often looked hokey. But after sitting down and basically devouring season one, I can say that I absolutely fell in love. I don't have a single character that I dislike. Everyone is fully fleshed out, and story keeps you coming back for more. I recommend this show to everyone. Don't let the premise of the supernatural deter you. In the end, it's not about that. It's really about how vampires are just as fallible and human as anyone else. It's about how humans can hold their own, even against overwhelming powers and events.
B001GQSY64|5.0|This is a great movie for those who are Star Wars fans.<br /><br />The story doesn't really fit in that well with movie series, but it serves to further pique one's interest in getting more of the Clone Wars TV series which came after (which are really good!).
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game starts out easy, but increases in difficulty quickly. It's hard to put down and really keeps your interest. You hand stays busy and it keeps your mind focused on the next strategic move.
B008Q0AOF2|5.0|Excellent, good flow. Strong plotline and some great scenery. Keeps you involved from the very opening.Expect to watch it often.
0345529057|5.0|I have only read the first book in the series so my opinion is mostly over how everything looks. But the covers and the box set look great. Externally, everything looks good. The covers of all four books look fantastic too. Plus, the price was great. Game of Thrones, however, makes me highly anticipatory to read books 2-4.
B004YXE438|5.0|Spectrum is great fun. The puzzle variety keeps it interesting and you can choose your difficulty level for each one. You can even change the difficulty while you are solving the puzzle! Looooooove it! Spectrum has options to buy additional puzzle packs that aren't expensive. I would like to see them add a &quot;create your own&quot; option like some other puzzle makers. This is definitely my favorite puzzle app!!!
B009G41CG2|5.0|I am enjoying this game. It works good. I am satisfied. I don't know why I have to write so many words when a game doesn't warrant it.
B005LAIGSC|5.0|Good movie .. Highly recommended another great performance from Denzel Washington, expected ending but I still love it and recommend it
0756405890|5.0|I had this recommended to me, and I got it kind of skeptical. But once I started reading I had trouble putting it down until I was finished. The story is utterly enthralling and draws you in. The tale Kvothe weaves about his life makes you feel like you were right there with him, going through the same trials as him, living in the world he describes. By the end you can't wait to pick up the second book in the series. This was the second copy I have had to buy since my first one be seems to have mysteriously disappeared. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the fantasy genre, especially if you dig excellent world building and a full cast of characters that is extremely well-developed, what more could a reader ask for?
B00A4B9A1U|4.0|Born 1951 I was brought up to believe that the USA held the moral high ground in almost everything and represented all things wise and wonderful. As I grew up I became aware of some of the evil that USA caused in Africa, South & Central America and elsewhere. It is informative, difficult but refreshing to read this view of USA history.<br /><br />Every student should be given access to the Alternative History of their country. It widens their understanding and provides a healthy scepticism of politicians pronouncements and actions.
B00ABXA1HI|1.0|Despite the good reviews, it still costs money to use. It might be a good product, but the costs are not worth it.  I'd rather just purchase a large thumbdrive.
0446691437|5.0|Every so often you come across a book that's written in a way so that every letter of every page brings epiphanies and this my friend is one of these books.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Bought this season 2 and sadly this was the season that was cut short due to the writers strike. Even though this season was cut short, it definitely did not fail to be as action packed as the first two. The build up of the season makes the viewer fly through the episodes. Even though the strike makes the ending seem a little abrupt, nonetheless it effectively makes one question whether it just really happened and to make you impatient for season four. The special features are a little sparse but nonetheless interesting,
B004EPYZUS|5.0|This movie rocks.  Totally entertaining and the scene hanging off the towering building is outrageous.  It's action packed and funny.  Definitely a movie to see again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm always playing it and trying to beat my friends high score on Facebook. I recommend this game for you.
B0083Z614S|5.0|A classic story about hurt, compassion and healing told through three children from very different backgrounds and the garden which brings them together. To say more would spoil the reader's individual experience.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Bought after season 1, this season of Supernatural is still before everything goes to hell, quite literally, and does not fail to be as entertaining and as enticing as season one. In many way us, I feel like this is one of the better seasons of the show. The brothers are still figuring everything out and many of their issues that develop later are still missing or just sitting under the surface of their relationship. Definitely a must have if you enjoy the show. The special features are interesting too, especially if you like behind the scenes looks.
0736092269|5.0|This book is a must have for anybody serious about strength training. I bought this book while deployed and saw more results after having a better understanding of which workouts put more stress on certain muscles. It helped me locate my weak points and correct any assumptions I had on how to properly execute exercises.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|A great first novel by Todd! I couldnt put it down. Very enjoyable. I'm anxiously awaiting the next Max Larkin book...
B009ERK1T0|5.0|Bought it for my daughter, who's a HUGE Deftones fan.  Of course she loved it!!! She said it ranks right up there with their other music.
B004SIP9U6|5.0|I show parts of this film to my high school students when we study Shakespeare. Be sure to skip the adult scenes. Costumes are awesome.
B00275EHJG|1.0|The dvd freezes constantly I am so disappointed  What a waste of money!  ususally I buy dvds used this time I bought new.
B002ZE85YW|4.0|Lots of action, FXs, plot follows with Terminator theme.  Better than Rise of the Machines, not as good as Terminator 2.  Good addition to the collection.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|In many ways DA is a 21st century Guiding Light.  Better production values, acting and dialogue....but the pure soap of it keeps me hooked.  Too engaging to be missed!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show. Easy to use Amazon Instant Video on my iPad, phone and on my home computer or laptop computer.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|The concept and story seem to flow and pull the reader in from start to finish. A little repetitive at times but still a great book. Can't wait to start the others.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|If a book can goose my imagination, allow me to effortlessly track characters, geography and plot, and compel me to see it all in expressive color, then I'm in. The Kitchen House held me -- I regretted after two days of active reading that it had to end! Even now, a few days later, I find myself thinking about the characters and the fates I imagine for them.<br /><br />Many reviewers have expressed concern over historical accuracy; I respect that, though I took the story on face value, as I was on this ride simply for the escape good fiction provides. I'd have given this book five stars were it not for some editing lapses, including in the spelling of Will \\"Stephens\\" (for most of the book, electronic version) and, later, Will \\"Stevens.\\" Sorry, but that's just sloppy. Otherwise, colorful, wonderful read!
B004SEUJ82|5.0|This movie is so sad, but I like to show it to my students when we read Night by Elie Wiezel.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I use You Tube for my quilting tutorials, and this is a good way to get the tutorials and other information that I need.
B00AECGQF2|4.0|This game is very fun! You can dye, cut, straighten, and pretty much do whatever you want with the characters hair. You can choose from 6 characters to pick who you want to do their hair. It's very fun!<br />  Now, the first time I played with this, I had the sound off. when I turned the sound on, I was very disturbed. How did you make those sounds??????? Very disturbing. Other than that it's a pretty good game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I LOVED this game. I like the jumping, the sliding, and most of all,the powerhouse. You should definitely try this amazing game.
B00428ZRFE|3.0|I like Rihanna, but I don't love this cd. I listen to a few songs, but I prefer her other CDs.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|There are many study helps that I like; also, I can select from a variety of versions.  I use it daily.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game a downloaded the new update. Doesn't cost nothin and is amazing. I like that it's free. But if they hoped the price  I would be willing to pay 99&cent;
B00942X8PY|5.0|The simple graphics is perfect for the job. The learning curve is great. Hard to put down. If you like trainyard, this is another great game. Ads a little annoying but not too bad.
B001CDD84Y|4.0|It was very original and it kept my attention throughout not comic strip in it's content.This movie made me feel  people with special powers are possible.It was a pleasant surprise
B004GHNIRK|3.0|For me this book is really a downer.  It is depressing, gray and boring.  I think I am just not wired for this one.
B006ZPJWBM|5.0|The music, performers, and tony were great.<br /><br />Would love to see more like duets like this.<br /><br />Especially liked Lady Gaga and K D Lang duets with tony.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I would recommend this case for anyone who travels. Take headset off store it in the case and it charges.
B0093X80VQ|1.0|I loved Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator because it is the most amazing book ever. So funny. Ronald Dahl is awesome.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I ENJOYED ALL THREE OF THE HUNGER GAMES BOOKS BY SUZANNE COLLINS AND WOULD RECOMMEND THEM AS THEY REALLY CAPTURE THE IMAGINATION
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|I'm never bored finding something to read here, but I wish the videos wouldn't crash the app. but maybe that's a network problem?
B004KKX80A|1.0|Bought this along with others to battle Hell Kerbecs and to say anything good about this blade would make me a liar. The concept seems cool, but doesn't work. Pointless blade, it'll lose to even smaller blades.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I have been trying to play this game but there are no instructions. I can't figure out what to do so I crash all the time - the coin stuff is also confusing
B003O86FMW|4.0|AS WITH THE FIRST BOOK THE HUNGER GAMES, THE SECOND BOOK CATCHING FIRE KEPT ME IN SUSPENSE UNTIL THE VERY END
B007FTZDN8|5.0|the platform is like watching television, of all the video applications I have so far, this is by far, my favorite.
B000BVMAJ2|5.0|2yr old son loves his blocks and animals so this was awesome. All the animals are detailed well enough and we enjoy playing with em, also goes well with My First Zoo.
2070576965|3.0|Okay, the only reason I give it a 3 star is because it was more difficult to read than anticipated.  I'm back to studying and reading French for the first time in many years. I should have remembered Roald Dahl's love of wordplay - which is what makes his books so amusing. Problem is, that funny wordplay translated into funny wordplay in French is quite a challenge. I was constantly looking up words and eventually resorted to getting the English edition as well and reading the two side by side. Yup, wimping out I know but I was getting too frustrated.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I ENJOYED ALL THREE BOOKS OF THE HUNGER GAMES BY SUZANNE COLLINS AND WILL RECOMMEND THEM TO ANYONE WHO ENJOYS READING SUSPENSE NOVELS
0446580848|5.0|Maybe because this was the first DeMille book I read...but maybe not. Didn't know if I could take all the sarcasm at first...but grew to love it. DeMille is a master writer. The action and dialogue and story are great. What really hooks me to a book is the author's ability to \\"teach\\" me something about a topic along with the story. This book did just that. I was fascinated by all the background info on Yemen. I'll continue reading everything by this author and look forward to his new stuff.
B00942X8PY|3.0|It's a decent game that works well.  However, I do think an explanation of the special blocks would be nice instead of letting you figure them out by trial and error and I didn't appreciate the subtle denigration when you finish a level (gold says, &quot;Impressive, for you.&quot; and silver, &quot;Satisfactory. Almost.&quot;).<br /><br />Works on the same principle as PathPix without building a picture to look at when you finish the level.  It's okay, I just didn't have fun playing it.
B004U8VUUC|3.0|This was a good movie and the acting was OUTSTANDING, but the in accuracies in the story line were a LOT disappointing.  Robert Durst was not a good guy and easy going he growled in the court room and Jeannie Pirro did NOT open the case AT ALL it was Det. Becerra in 2000 Pirro did DEMAND the credit for the case however. So in short a lot was left out all the investigation work and the actual evidence leaning toward Durst committing the crimes was not shown.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|JODI PICOULT REALLY KEEPS YOU GLUED TO THE STORY. HER WRITING IS ALWAYS VERY TRUE TO LIFE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO THE READERS.
B0000A5BS7|3.0|Johnny English Reborn (JER) was more riveting than this. OK, but not Atkinson's best. Don't need to see JE to enjoy JER
0823015033|5.0|I'm new to sculpting and needed to know the techniques used and this book teaches just that. I am very satisfied with all the information it has. I'm still reading it and learning more. I plan on making the tools she uses and if I hadn't already bought the sculpting tools that I have, I wouldn't have. I have a friend who is wanting to learn also and I suggested that she gets this book before she buys anything else. I feel this book teaches most, if not all that you need to learn about sculpting figures. I can't wait to start using what I'm learning in this book. I would recommend this book to any beginner who is serious about learning to sculpt in polymer clay.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This was a great book that kept you interested throughout, very suspenseful and not at all predictably like some suspense books can be.  Can't wait to read this authors second book!
B003L7DK74|4.0|These guys are hilarious, no doubt about it. I bought it used so it did have some issues with packaging, but besides that it was worth it.

It's not THAT hard to figure out though. A little more help would make it easier to pick up at first, but you'll need a decent amount of problem solving skills to get very far with it anyway.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|We loved this movie! The fact that it's based on a true story helped me overcome my aversion to subtitles and give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. It was touching and funny, and even my 14yo said she didn't even notice she was &#34;reading&#34; the movie.

B00AREIAI8|3.0|My four year old loves this app however it would be nice to have less ads. She gets frustrated we she gets trapped by an ad. I wish is was easier to get gyms.  I do not want to purchase.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Well written.Even for a beginner like me.This book leads you,follow the instructions.Your options are outlined.The journey to publish your idea has an end in sight.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|A little too much technical stuff but overall very engrossing. Honor is a great character. I presume the next book will hook up Honor with Captain Yu and I look forward to reading it.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I love this cd. My entire family enjoys it including my children! Good job! I would purchase any music Hugh Laurie came out with!
B002VBV1S6|3.0|I loved the universe in this book, I loved the city and the religion and the people. I did however not love the story, and I don't know why. It might be that i couldn't connect to the main character or it may be that he wasn't completely 'there'. I did not read the rest of the series and probably won't unless there is nothing else out there for me to read. I was disappointed when I finished the book but I very quickly moved onto something else I loved.
B0084AXZK0|3.0|I hoped this book would be a great read. It has an interesting premise but just drags on and on.
0553378384|5.0|This is my second copy - the first one was used and loaned out so often that it started falling apart. It has extensive information for each of the node signs. Knowing what your south and north nodes (from an astrologer or a web site that does free horoscopes) are gives you information about what is easy and what are your challenges in this lifetime. I refer to it often.
B009AMALGM|4.0|We saw this movie when it came out in the theatre. Its slow going but the end is so worth it.  Go see it.  It will scare you.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|I loved this book. Sweeping stories, all losely interconnected.  While reading it, I was transported into a different place and time.  The language was extraordinarily crafted.  The vocabulary was consistent with each time period - hence it took a little work to read this. But I felt it was definitely worth the effort. And the time-appropriate language made the stories come to life.  I read it on my Kindle, so a dictionary was readily available. I would definitely recommend this book.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a great game for adventurers and people who love mysteries. To me this game is a great thriller. Try not to play this game in the dark... alone.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Not only is this film brilliant, it is a movie lovers dream. The collaborative relationship between Hitch and Alma, added to an insider's view of the making of the Hollywood classic  Psycho, makes this a classic units own right.
