B00003CXS4|4.0|Following the wave of movies about underground gritty British gangsters/drug pushers that began with Trainspotting, Snatch seems to rise above the sludge of its subject matter.  It bolsters a tight well-thought plot that (directorially and theamatically) snaps into place.  The movie holds an endearing charm as we follow its vivacious characters around England.  Bullet Tooth Tony almost steals the show from Brad Pitt as the quarky independant minded thug, but Pitt pulls the carpet away from Tony's feet with his beautiful ending.<br />All in all it seems as if the movie's director has spent years tightening up and editing his characters.  Indeed we even feel as if we have seen these wonderful pranksters before.  In reality that's not far off.  Ritchie's first film Lock, Stock, and 2 Smoking Barrels seems like, if not a preliminary version of Snatch, at least a prequel.  Still, even though Snatch may not get an A+ in originallity, it did gain from the amount of work Ritchie has done in this area.  His expertise make for a wonderfully fast and visually stimulating experience.<br />Best movie of the year?  No, but it deffinately picks up an Adam Trimble \\"Best in Genre.\\"
B00004Z459|4.0|Unlike the rest of the recent darlings of rock (System of A Down, Limp Bizkit, Incubus, Disturbed, Godsmack ... you know the rest), rap/rockers Linkin Park may actually stick around for a while, and for one simple reason:  grown-ups like them.<br />Okay, the image needs some work--those facial piercings look painful, boys--but you'll find a surprising number of people over the age of 30 who own \\"Hybrid Theory.\\"  In this age of sampling being called songwriting, Linkin Park actually knows how to write, play and sing a good pop melody.  I'm glad I'm not the only one who thinks the singer can sound uncannily like that guy in Savage Garden!  The bait for adults is the most recent single \\"In The End,\\" which has a pretty piano intro and a catchy, singalong hook, but don't overlook the pounding \\"Crawling\\" or \\"Runaway,\\" which will lull you in and then beat you over the head with crunching riffs.  The beats are good, the raps are surprisingly evocative, and despite your best efforts this CD will [draw] you in despite yourself.  The only bad track on here is the awkward \\"Place In My Head,\\" but the rest of the CD more than makes up for it.  <br />My 15-year-old nephew finds it hilarious--and I suspect somewhat embarrassing--that his 35-year-old aunt and 46-year-old uncle dig Linkin Park, but out of the current crop of [stuff] passing for rock these days, these guys are the lone bright spot.  It'll be interesting to see where they go after the huge success of this CD.
0060392886|5.0|These guy's have had the best and the worst of times. And who better to tell us so than The Crue themselves, If you have ever wondered what is like to be a rock star, you have got to read this. From $200 an hour hookers, to Nikki and Tommy's kid's being in the same class at school, this book say's it all atleast I hope that was all, I can't imagine there being anymore than this. Then again we are talking about The Crue, so I feel certain there will \\"The Dirt 2\\"! LONG LIVE MOTLEY
B00003CXI1|3.0|I liked the movie, I really did but I think the only reason that I liked it so much when it first came out was because I got to see it before a lot of people. The movie is good and the acting is good among certain characters, mainly the adults, but what can you say because the kids were in their first movie. A lot of people said the movie was nothing like the book but it actually was totally like the book, which it should be! The only main differences were just the parts they had to leave out which makes sense because other wise the movie would have been anylonger. The movie is so much like the book that I couldn't read the book after I saw the movie because it was exactly like MOST of the scenes. Notice i did say most. The movie is a TON like the book but it's not totally exact with every detail but it's very close. People will argue but they'll get over it and if they don't they are just doing it for show as everyone does. Anyway the movie is good but if you've just read the book DON'T go see it. I hadn't read the book for over 2 yrs and I'm glad I hadn't because it left me wondering what happened. If you have just read the book I would really not reccomend seeing it just because you'll be bored, in my opinion. If you are going to see the 2nd movie but want to read the book, READ IT NOW because the movie is said to be out in Novemeber and you shouldn't be reading it any later than now because otherwise you'll remember it all and I think it's best that you don't so it leaves the movie interesting.
B0000524CY|5.0|The Exorcist is not just the best horror movies of all time but one of the best films ever made. The story surrounding a young girl possesed by a demon is a true good vs evil story that will scare the hell out of you in the process. The actors,Jason Miller, Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair, (all recieved Oscar nominations) are at thier best. This movie is not for the weak of heart. It is a scary, powerful, movie. I saw this when it was re-released and it was just a powerful. If you have never seen this film rent, or buy it, today.
B00003CXPJ|2.0|The mother of all stupid-funny movies. Directed, produced and co-written by Ben Stiller, this is a movie for everyone(everyone who has time to watch a film this stupid). It's a shame this is what comedies are coming to these days. Full of dumb humor and bad acting, it's fun for the whole family. It just seems that good old funny movies are going down hill.
B00005J6UP|5.0|I don't own the movie yet, But I absolutely loved it.  I rented it and watched it, and I must have played it a million times! I love that movie so much!  I feel that I can relate to it, awsome movie for children...especially 13 year olds like me!<br />I hope to own it, cuz I really wanna see that Octopuse part that they took out when they released the movie!  I deffinatly think you should get this movie.I know I don't explain much about it, I just love it!
B00005V3Z4|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen and that's pretty bad becous I like just about every movie. The only good thing was Barrymores acting.
B000002LR6|5.0|This is a nice CD ministry at it's best. But what is with those tracks at the end? If it wasn't for Jesus Built My Hotrod this would have only got 3 stars. In short it's a nice CD, but it has a bunch of terrible tunes at the end.
B00004T8RK|4.0|Well, this c.d grows on me.  It's newer so they kinda went with the times of music, still incorporating their own classic style with it.  That's why its so cool.  My favs on this C.D is Insignificance, Grievance, Rival and Nothings as it seems.  I suggest yuou listen to some songs on the live Pearl Jam c.ds first because they are better than the studio versions on this C.D
B00003CXRM|5.0|Funny story and GREAT music ! Buy the DVD and the sound track !
B000002BYD|3.0|this C.d is their triumphant return.  it's fairly dood but slightly odd (EX. REd Dot)  Good Songs are low light, difference, givin to fly and all those YEsterdays
0375704027|5.0|... <br />I could not get my head out of it. It's so simplisticly beautiful because of Murakami's fantastic writing. The story just flows. His realistic approach to the story line, the characters, the situations, the emotions and occurances that evolve are very touching, in a way where the reader can relate to, or draw from happenings in their own lives or others they know of. And I feel it's that reality that will draw a reader to a book, and specifically to Murakami's writing in 'Norwegian Wood'.<br />It tell's the story of a young man, Toru, growing up in a 1960's Tokyo, and his life amongst falling in love, unusual friendships, passion, lust and loss. <br />The story sparring a over a few years only, the reader feels so strongly for Toru, and his mishaps in falling in love, and his emotions that come through it. Naoko, Toru's first love, was introduced through his best friend Kizuki. Both Naoko and Kizuki introduce a new element to the story line I havn't really experienced before, one of real emotional confusion, not really knowing where you stand, where Toru seems to try to be differentiating between what's real in relationships, and what isn't, what's real in the world, what isn't, and why things happen for the reasons they do.<br />This is furthur seen after some time at university, when Toru meets Midori, a girl who is in only one of classes. She literally marches into his life, and is a charater with fabulous depth, life and thought, and she really throws it to Toru, who makes him realise what kind of a person he is, where in the world they sit, how to be real, and what love, interest, passion and real emotion is. Toru is really tried to choose between what has happened in the past, and what will happen in the future.<br />All these emotions that he feels are fabulous, because the reader can relate to so many of these, if you're a younger reader like me, 18, you can relate because you're experienceing them now. You want to know what's going to happen. Youwant to feel what they feel, You want to experience it, or you want to experience it again. And you love the fact that you may not be the only one feeling it. For older readers, live it again. Live the feeling of wanting to express to your first love how you feel, the crazy uncontrollable hormone levels, those first moments of sharing something new, the awkwardness that many young adults have. <br />\\"Evocative, entertaining, sexy and funny; but then Murakami is one of the best writers around.\\" Omer Ali, Time Out. <BR>Could not be better said! Murakami is fantastic. And this is the reason why I just let myself fall into the book, and I will be again when I go to buy another of his books tomorrow! Definently definently recommended for anyone who loves life, the feeling fo desire, passion, intrigue and in that amazing imagery. <br />Just simply beautiful.
B0000028UK|4.0|This is my FAv Pearl Jam C.D.  It's a little heavier than TEN.  Some good songs are Dissident, ANimal Blood, and Glorified G also Rats is good
B00000DHZJ|5.0|Hendrix is arguably one of the best guitarists to live, (beside jimmy page from zep?) and is a master of traditional blues and rock.  If u are a fan of any kind of rock (ok maybe not that heavy punk noise stuff...) or some blues, this is a good CD to look into, especially if you haven't gotten into hendrix it touches upon some of the best aspects of his playing:  Purple Haze, one of his best songs that everyone is bound to hear sometime is on this CD; Little Wing and Red House are great songs with a perfect touch of blues; and the stars spangled banner which is a good example of a master musician taking a traditional song and making it almost his own.  A fellow reviewer and possibly not a hendrix fan claims that hendrix's songs are simple, and really not well written.  With music emerging from the popular jazz and swing eras, a lot of songs did not need or have good writing, since they were based around improvisation.  A few bands have focused some on writing but many successful ones have not, and this is only because they have excellent soloists, such as hendrix.
B0000027RL|4.0|This for obvious reason is one of the best they did.  It is in VH1's greastest albums of all time and other numerous countdowns.  This encaptured the raw lyrics that Eddie is famous for. good songs to prove this is porch and Why go?.  It definately helped the Era of Grunge and in my opinion is way better than Nirvana's never mind<BR>just about all these songs are worth listening to
B000001ESP|5.0|This is a great album with some really fine drumming by Neil Peart.  Actually, all of the musicians really gel on this album and have an incredible sense of timing.<br />My favorite song is Red Barchetta.  The drums make me salivate every time I hear it and are incredibly fun to play along with (if you have a drum set).  The lyrics are pretty good too.<br />Since I'm just now getting in to Rush, I only own two of their albums.  This one is better than Permanent Waves, which is a fine album in its own right.
B000002BFZ|2.0|I have no idea what they did with this one.  All the songs on this C.D are either slow blues type or trying to be on the verge of pop punk.  Favs on this C.D are Red Mosquito, Hail Hail, smile and LUKIN (that's one really heavy for them, you can't understand what he's sayin)  If you like the more mellow blues side of pearl jam or just mellow blues music then this C.D is for you.  The Cover art is different and unique as well
006109594X|3.0|I agree with some other readers, who point out weaknesses such as introducing us to the Navy pilot as if he's going to be a major character -- then killing him off. But there's no point in rehashing other people's points. My main criticism is that the author's not a very good writer of scenes. The dialogue between the joint chiefs and their advisors, the president, etc., just didn't seem very realistic. As to the reader who challenged critics of the book &quot;why don't you try to write a book yourself&quot; or words to that effect: just because I don't have the skill to be a good novelist doesn't mean I'm unqualified to recognize that others don't have the skill either.
B00005NW02|1.0|Have heard this band alternately referred to as, System Of A Downs Syndrome.  no comment.  save your money.<br />To make up for the mistake, in case you already bought it,, try The Disco Biscuits.  A pleasant surprise!~!~
0440224764|1.0|Not only did I not like the ending, it just did not fit the character development which preceeded it.<br />Up to that point, the book was quite engaging and a page-turner. But the very last twist was too much - and left me unhappy, wishing that the very unlikely ending had never been pasted into the manuscript.
B000001FTD|5.0|I love this CD. It just rips everything completely. Midtempo chugging riffs on I Am The Law from the beginning of the song only to develop into a swirl of jagged riffing in the end. Man!!!<BR>Really great! Hyper speed drumming, solid bass playing, awesome wails from Joey, excellent guitar workout. Like what all the other previous reviewers said, this is one of the must-haves! Buy it for good music's sake!!!
B000002OZY|5.0|Like the movie says \\"Put on 'Tommy', light a candle and you'll see your future.  \\"Tommy\\" was one of the first LPs to really get me going into rock and roll, other than stuff by the Beatles.  I first heard this courtesy of my high school English teacher who played it in his class (on his big reel to reel tape recorder) during lunch time, and that became the place to hang out.<br />This LP (and it was an LP) has lots of great songs like \\"Pinball Wizard\\", \\"The Acid Queen\\" and \\"See Me Feel Me\\".  I could for weeks with \\"Overture\\" playing in my head. These songs are so good that they stand on their own, outside the frame of the rock opera.  Actually, when I first got into it I really didn't care about the rock opera part of it, I just liked the music.<br />Ever since \\"Almost Famous\\"  came out, I have gotten a new appreciation for the Who in general and \\"Tommy\\" in particular.  I thought that \\"Sparks\\" really helped set the tone for the major shift of focus in the movie and it has become one of my all time favorite songs.<br />I won't comment on that stupid mess of a movie that was somewhat inspired by \\"Tommy\\", but it hasn't dampened my love for this album (in the same way that the awful Sgt. Pepper movie couldn't kill my love of that album.)  \\"Tommy\\" will remain one of the groundbreaking LPs in rock and roll legacy.  Long live rock!

B00005JKBC|5.0|This spy thriller is simply amazing. They work action and drama to perfection. Brad Pitt and the legendary Robert Redford are great together. I know many people who have seen this movie, and they all loved it.<br />This is simply the best movie since Memento. If you want to see a good spy thriller with a great cast, go see Spy Game!!!!!
B00005N9CV|5.0|I could have listened on... or played forever with this voice and sound. Yet I took time out to tell music., I must play with this exquisite phenomena. Yes, thats what I'm doing Ms Krall. Totally appreciating your gift, and thankful that there is more. ...
0780627024|5.0|Tobey Maguire and Reese Witherspoon get zapped into the sweet 1950s sitcom \\"Pleasantville.\\" Everything is in black&white and everything is perfect--if you shoot a basketball in the air, it will ALWAYS land RIGHT in the hoop, guarenteed. Everything works like clockwork--the father comes home from work and the mother has the dinner on time. Everyone repects each other. But once Reese & Tobey start interacting with everyone, that's when everything slowly becomes inperfect--and everything slowly changes to color. <BR>If you LOVE the 50s, you'll love this movie! The only thing I didn't like about it was when Reese Witherspoon kept dissing the styles of the 50s.
0684833395|5.0|What can you say about a book that has had so much influence?  It's clearly deservedly classic.  But it isn't a real pleasure to read, at least not for me.  The prose is so dense that you have to read every word.  You can never predict where a sentence or a paragraph is going.  Heller makes sudden, neck-snapping changes from the cutely ridiculous (like the squadron commander refusing to see people in his office when he's there) to really heartbreaking.  The genius of the book is not in the humor, which to me at least started to get old after a while--the genius is in his assault on the bureaucratic mind and the way he captures the feeling of men trapped in the inhuman machinery of war.  It isn't the most enjoyable thing in the world to read, but it should be read.

006092988X|5.0|When I was thirteen I read this book and loved it. I was Francie in my mind. We lived not far from Brooklyn and while not as poor, shared many of the same problems. The book has always been a fond memory for me. This month it was chosen as a group read for my reading group. Although I rarely re read, I decided to see if the book was as good as my memory said it was. To my delight it was still as wonderful as I remembered. Only this time I had a bit more sympathy for the mother Katie, then I did the first time. Seeing the book through the eyes of a mother, I admired more of the qualities I saw as harsh those many years ago. Betty Smith writes with such detail, that one can see the streets of Williamsburg as seen through Francie's eyes. The Nolan's are a family that literally lives the American dream. They start the book in dire poverty, yet each generation accomplishing more than the one before. And they have the most important gift of all, the love and support of family. Today this would no doubt be labeled a dysfunctional family, with an alcoholic father, a mother leaving her children unattended, an aunt who is a little too free with her favors. Yet we love the Nolans, and root for them through thick and thin. Francie Nolan loved reading and the library above all else. I am now the grown up Francie, still trying to read every book in the library. I am glad I took the time to re read this one. Francie Nolan will be a part of me forever.
0792838068|3.0|This is one of the most unremittlingly depressing movies I have ever seen. That said, it is well made, and the lead actors do a credible job.  My main argument is that very few hookers look like Elizabeth Shue, and the relationship between two very troubled individuals is somewhat glamorized and made to look poetic, when in reality, it would be pathetic.<BR>If you're feeling a bit down, avoid it like the plague!  Otherwise, watch it to appreciate the acting, and to realize that Las Vegas is one of the most depressing places on the planet.
B000002J2D|4.0|I used to like 1980s Genesis, but then eventually I got sick of the 1981-'91-era Genesis and turned to the '70s Genesis, starting with The Lamb and I was really pleased with that album, so I went and checked all their other 1970s albums, eventually coming to this album, And Then There Were Three, appropriately named because the fact Steve Hackett had just left, and Gabriel some three years before, leaving the band the trio of Collins, Rutherford, and Banks, the trio that gave us all those '80s hits like &quot;Invisible Touch&quot;, &quot;Mama&quot;, &quot;I Can't Dance&quot;, &quot;In Too Deep&quot;, &quot;Hold On My Heart&quot;, etc. I was a bit hesitant to get And Then There Were Three because it featured &quot;Follow You, Follow Me&quot;, after all this song everything that represented their 1980s style: mushy lyrics, formulaic songwriting, in fact that song sounded like it belonged on their 1983 album simple entitled &quot;Genesis&quot;. In other words the biggest hit on the album sounds very 1980s and yet it was from 1978. But I was pleased that none of the rest of the album was like that. Certainy the songs are shorter than anything that came since From Genesis to Revelation, and more straightforward, but there's still plenty of that '70s progressive atmosphere to be found. Of course there are no lengthy instrumentals like on Wind &amp; Wuthering, no epics like &quot;Supper's Ready&quot;. Some of my favorite cuts here are &quot;The Lady Lies&quot;, &quot;Burning Rope&quot;, &quot;Snowman&quot; and &quot;Say It's Alright Joe&quot;. Certainly the songs aren't the strongest Genesis had made and I had to listen to it a few times to appreciate the album. It does seem like a disappointment compared to what they accomplished since 1970, but it really isn't that bad. In fact this album would even be better without that hit &quot;Follow You...&quot;. It's too bad that song will represent what the band will be doing throughout the 1980s and in to the early 1990s. Most everything else Genesis had done in the 1970s was better than And Then There Were Three, but even so, I still like it, but it might not be the first pre-Duke album you should try, start with The Lamb, Selling England, Foxtrot, and Nusery Cryme first.
B000001DYA|5.0|Blue Cheer released this debut in 1968 when groups and artists like Cream, Jimi Hendrix Experience, Iron Butterfly, Steppenwolf and The Doors were putting out psychedelic rock. Blue Cheer were three guys who played loud psychedelic rock and I can still see those stacks of Marshall amps piled a mile high. These guys had one major hit &quot;Summertime Blues&quot; which has been covered by other artists. Their version stands alone by itself as my favorite. The other songs on this album such as &quot;Out Of Focus&quot; and &quot;Parchment Farm&quot; are pure psychedelic kick a.. rock. This groups follow up album &quot;Outsideinside&quot; was also much of the same. Too bad these guys didn't get the credit they deserved and were lost in the shuffle of all the psychedelic groups popping up in the late 60's. If you're into 60's psychedelic rock don't pass this gem up. Highly recommended!
0440219078|5.0|A fine, insightful Dystopian novel of a \\"perfect\\" world which is anything but, \\"The Giver\\" belongs on the small but important shelf of such cautionary novels as \\"1984\\" & \\"Brave New World.\\"<br />However, after reading so many of the previous reviews, it's fascinating & revealing to see that so many readers think of the Community as being Communistic, when in fact it depicts the end result of any True Believer mentality: There is only One Way, Our Way. It could just as easily be a fundamentalist community of any religious stripe, or one of any ideologically-mandated group. Let's not forget that we have plenty of people right here in America who are convinced they know what's best for everyone, and who believe we should all be forced to live according to their beliefs; quite often they're the ones waving a flag and/or a cross most vehemently. In fact, there's one more book that readers of \\"The Giver\\" should consult: Sinclair Lewis' pre-WWII novel of Fascism coming to America, \\"It Can't Happen Here.\\" Because as \\"The Giver\\" warns us, it can happen anywhere.<br />Including Here.
0920668372|5.0|This book is amazing. I first discovered it when I was about five, and really enjoyed it. Recently, after many years, I unearthed it to read to a one year old I know. The child's mother read it, and cried every time! In my opinion, it is a beautiful story that every person should read at least once in their childhood or even in their lifetime.
B00000DFSK|4.0|This is a wonderful compilation to introduce new fans to the older songs.  However, I gave this item only 4 stars because it was also released with a second disc full of b-sides.
0553573403|5.0|This is a fantastic book.  This is a masterpiece.  Even saying that feels like I am damning it with too faint praise.  I bought it, I read it--no, devoured it--in a few days.  Every detail was important.  Every sentence communicated something relevant and interesting about the world.  I realized early on, even before the story had me by the throat, that I was in the hands of a master.  When I was done, I had to run out and devour the next two.<br /><br />My largest complaint is that it left me depressed.  Not only is the story grim, but now I'm left with the horrible realization that until the fourth book comes out, everything else I read is going to be lackluster.  This is as good as writing ever gets.  Tight.  Well-edited.  Excellent characters with real flaws.  Excellent politics.  Unpredictable highs and lows.  Coherent and cohesive.<br /><br />Are there slow parts?  A few.  But it all depends on your perspective.  A lot of readers, for example, will love the adventurous quests of Arya and Jon Stark, whereas love these two as I did, I always wanted to hurry through their sections to get to the \\"good\\" political parts.  Conversely, those who love the adventure and questing, are probably going to love the Arya/Jon/Dany sections, and tense up at the political onslaught that belong to other characters.<br /><br />In this way, Martin gives a little bit to everyone without sacrificing the whole of the work.  Buy it, but read it slowly.  Everything he mentions ends up being important, but more, it's going to be an agonizingly long wait for the next book.  And don't dare be frightened by the warnings about graphic and explicit violence and sex.<br />Martin is not squeamish, but he is never, ever, gratuitous.  The violence and blood you actually see, you need to see.  The sex, what there is of it, is never exploitive or pornographic--it's necessary and character defining.  Only in the third book is there an arguably iffy encounter with two female characters that seems not to be strictly necessary.  But I trust Martin, and so I trust that by the end of the series we'll know how and why this was required.<br />Also, there's a roster of characters at the back of the book that would have been helpful if it appeared in the front of the book instead.  Those of us who write in the fantasy genre should rejoice and despair.  We now have a lot to live up to.strictly necessary.

0316776963|5.0|I LOVE David Sedaris.  I have all of his books, and tape him when he's on NPR.  I think of all of his books of essays, this is the one that's best-organized, and best-structured.  His views and insights remind me of my best friend.  During times like these, it's good to have some comic relief, and as far as books go, this is my choice.  My favorite essays in this book are &quot;Youth in Asia&quot;, &quot;Big Boy&quot;, &quot;Picka Pocketoni&quot;, and &quot;Jesus Shaves&quot;.

0316286443|5.0|Kevyn Aucoin is amazing!  The transformations in this book are awesome.  Martha Stewart into Veronica Lake.  A man into Linda Evangelista.  Gwyneth Paltrow into James Dean.  I like this book even better than Making Faces.  Kevyn Aucoin turns makeup into magic, and he does it brilliantly.  It's also very educational to someone who's studying beauty, as has individual sections dedicated to different effects, different parts of the face, different tools, etc.  This book is very entertaining, and also very helpful.  I love it!
B00005RDVW|4.0|Everyone knows how great this movie is and what a milestone it was for the Disney company, so I won't ramble on about it, but I think it is very important for everyone buying it for the documentary included on the tape to know that it isn't on there, so don't waste your time looking. I thought I had a bad tape, so I called Disney and they told me that somewhere in editing, they had made a mistake, and forgot to put the documentary on the tape. OOOPS! Avoid the mess and just get the DVD.
B00000K3D4|5.0|Labyrinth is about a young girl called Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) who lives in two different worlds- the real world, where her mother is not present in her life, she has a stepmother she hates, and a baby brother Toby that she's forced to baby-sit for. The other world is the fantasy world she's created for herself, in which she dresses like a Princess, names her pets and toys after storybook characters (a teddy bear called Launcelot and a dog called Merlin) preforms to her stuffed toys, and quotes lines from her favourite book - \\"The Labyrinth\\". It is obvious which of these two worlds she prefers.<br />One night babysitting however, her exasperation with her brother causes her to invoke the goblin king Jareth (David Bowie) and wishes him to take her brother away. He, being strangely in love with her, is only too happy to oblige, and sends out his goblin followers to snatch the baby. To Sarah's horror, she finds that her fantasy world is all too real, and to save Toby from being changed into a goblin, she must accept Jareth's deal: to rescue Toby she must travel through the labyrinth to the goblin city at it's centre. On the way she is joined by such friends as Hoggle the dwarfish creature with a big heart hidden behind a gruff exterior, Ludo the large, loveable 'monster' who can call the rocks, and Didymus the knightly fox on his steed - the sheepdog Ambrosius.<br />This is a family movie, with lots of laughs and thrills, brilliant costumes and set designs, and Jim Henson's puppets are still amazing to watch preform. But adults might pick up on the subtle similarities between Sarah's 'real' world and her 'Labyrinth' world, recognising the theme of reality and illusion. For instance, some of the toys in her room bear the same resemblances to Hoggle, Ludo and Didymus, Jareth is identified with the white owl that follows Sarah around the park, both Sarah's dog Merlin and Didymus's dog Ambrosius are English Sheepdogs, in Jareth's 'dream sequence' Sarah wears the same dress as the dancer in her music box, Sarah comes across the image of her own room in a dump-heap while in the Labyrinth, and at the climax of the movie she directly quotes her book 'The Labyrinth' in her final defense against Jareth.<br />So this movie is not just a kid's fantasy movie, it requires lots of 'reading between the lines' to pick up on the intended similarities between the real world, and the one that Sarah creates.<br />To end with Sarah's own quote, from her book 'The Labyrinth': \\"Give me the child. Through hardships untold and dangers un-numbered I have fought my way here to the castle beyond the goblin city to take back the child that you have stolen. For my will is as strong as yours, and my kingdom is great. You have no power over me.\\"s the dancer in her music box, Sarah comes across the image of her own room in a dump-heap while in the Labyrinth, and at the climax of the movie she directly quotes her book 'The Labyrinth' in her final defense against Jareth.<BR>So this movie is not just a kid's fantasy movie, it requires lots of 'reading between the lines' to pick up on the intended similarities between the real world, and the one that Sarah creates.<BR>To end with Sarah's own quote, from her book 'The Labyrinth': \\"Give me the child.

630441403X|5.0|The screenplay, direction, and fabulous performances make this film worth 5 stars!  I've watched it at least five or six times, and haven't started getting tired of it yet.<br />The story in a shot glass:  An out of control alcoholic (Ben) hits bottom, decides move from LA to Las Vegas to commit slow suicide, but finds love and some closure to his life when he meets Sera. Sera is a street wise yet hopelessly co-dependent  (first to her abusive pimp, then to Ben) hooker, who finds a glimpse of self worth when she learns to love and receive it in return.  Sort of a gritty, street smart \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" but without the fairy tale ending.<br />Cage is outstanding as Ben, the alcoholic in the hopeless, final stages of his disease.  He has the physical attributes down pat, from the shaking and glazed over facial expressions to the slow motion, understated weaving of an alcoholic with years of built up tolerance to the drug.  Cage's Best Actor Academy Award is well deserved, but Shue is even better (she got robbed by not winning also).  The pain showing behind the smiles she forces seems completely real, as she watches Ben slowly kill himself.  She is torn between wanting Ben to get help and the fear she will lose him emotionally as well as physically if she pushes him to end his self destruction.  In the end, they just choose to love each other despite the desperate circumstances of their relationship and the inevitable outcome.<br />While others described the ending as depressing (it is), there is closure; Ben gets what he wants, an end to his alcoholic suffering, and you get the sense Sera will grow stronger and develop some sense of self worth from the experience of learning to love, and learning to let go.<br />This film is definitely not for everyone.  If you are the Harry Potter/Lord of the Rings type, you probably won't get it, let alone appreciate or enjoy the film.  If you lean more toward \\"American Beauty\\" or \\"Fight Club\\", this is a must for your collection.<br />Best quote(Sera): \\"Keep talking Ben, between the 101 proof   breath and occasional drool, some interesting words fall out of your mouth.\\"
B00000064G|5.0|Unfortunately I discovered the music of Nick Drake not until 1979, 5 years after his premature death. 'Pink Moon', his last offcial album is, as far as I am concerned, his masterpiece. It's all there: his masterful guitarplaying, his fragile voice, his beautiful melodies. This album is warm, chilling, mournful, desperate, resigned, all in one. I must have listened to the songs literally a thousand times or more and they still are the most beautiful sonmgs I ever heard. 5 stars???.....
B00003CXPJ|5.0|I watched this with my roommates. We laughed the whole way through, and talked about it all next day. The movie's well made with plenty of clever moments. I love the way the orange frappuchino cup flies at the screen during the explosion. And the way Zoolander and Hansel bat at the Apple computer like monkeys. And the way Zoolander has different names for his \\"looks\\" though they are really all the same.  Sure, the male models are all idiots (I grant three of them the Darwin Award for removing themselves from the gene pool in the stupidest way), but the movie itself is pretty witty.
B0000524E5|2.0|Many who watch Coyote Ugly will find themselves feeling the story is very familiar. There are some good reasons for that. One is that Jerry Bruckheimer, one of the most successful producers of all time, insists that his movies be done by the numbers. As a result, while most people in the business are envious of his financial success, you'll rarely find him grabbing awards on Oscar night. Mr. Bruckheimer is also a firm believer in recycling. Sixteen years ago, he produced a big hit called Flashdance, in which a determined and beautiful girl worked as a dancer in a fancy bar until she was able to become a dancer in the theater. In Coyote Ugly a girl so similar as to be a clone works as a dancer and bartender in a huge bar until she can make it as a songwriter. In both movies, the girl is mentored into stardom by a handsome young man because, I suppose, we are still saddled by the odd notion that, not only can a woman not make it without a man, she has to sleep with him, too. I am certain that Mr. Bruckheimer would claim that the guy is still around to give a movie dramatic appeal, but I would argue that it says that the more things change, the more they remain the same in Hollywood. <br />Violet Sanford [Piper Perabo] moves to New York City from New Jersey. Dad [John Goodman] doesn't approve, but this being a by the numbers movie, we all know from the start that he'll come around. In New York, Violet takes cassettes of her songs around to the big music companies. They virtually throw her out on her ear. One night a tape winds up in the hands of a charming cook named Kevin [Adam Garcia], and he realizes what we know even though we haven't yet heard the songs: Violet is a super talented writer. Meanwhile, she lands a job at a bar called Coyote Ugly. In this establishment premium liquor is sold in shot glasses. That's all they sell. When the girls aren't too busy pouring shots or spraying customers who ask for water in the face with the same, they get up on the bar and dance. The crowd goes wild. This is the kind of place that only exists in a movie. <br />Coyote Ugly has in its favor a very high energy level and a very pretty cast. It has a great many familiar songs, mostly from the 80s, in it, thus assuring brisk soundtrack sales. Its original songs, unfortunately, are unlikely to still be being played in the 2020s. Perabo is a charming and talented actress, and better parts are bound to come her way. For her, this movie is merely a stepping stone.<br />Bruckheimer is a pro at sniffing out the winds of change, and he knew that the summer of 2000 would be one in which the 'PG-13' rating would rule. This was not due to Hollywood's sudden taking of the moral high ground. It was due to saber rattling coming from Washington and to the fact that Hollywood's core audience is now so young that many of its member aren't supposed to be able to buy tickets to 'R' rated fare. The result of Bruckehiemer's having copped out is that Coyote Ugly, which by it's very nature should have been 'R' rated, comes off as coy and prudish. There are many times when we want to say 'for shame' to producers whose use of gratuituous sex and violence earns their movies an 'R' rating. Still, there are times when it is somehow dishonest NOT to go the restricted route, and Coyote Ugly is a good example.
B000001Y42|5.0|This is the Best Bizkit ever, and is one of the best albums i own, but what the hell happened to the next two!
B00003CXMG|5.0|Sometimes a film comes along, and it enchants and excites you. It makes you believe in movie magic again. This may happen infrequently, but when it does, it reminds you of what made you fall in love with the movies to begin with. Of course, even the best movie triggers these feelings in only part of its audience. For me, Almost Famous is one of those pictures. Since the print media and the visual media are so different, I doubt this review can tell you if the film has the same in store for you. <br />Writer and director Cameron Crowe has had a charmed life, and he knows it, as can be seen in this partly autobiographical and partly fictionalized tale. When he was just fifteen years old, he got the first of several writing assignment from Rolling Stone magazine. Almost Famous is the story of a kid on the road with a rock and roll band in the early 1970s.<br />Young William Miller [Patrick Fugit] has come to the attention of Rolling Stone because of some articles he wrote for Creem magazine. The assignment comes via telephone, and the editors are unaware that they are hiring a teenager. William doesn't have much luck hooking up the band Stillwater until he gets a little help from a groupie called Penny Lane [Kate Hudson]. Penny is in love with Stillwater's lead guitarist, Russell [Billy Crudup]. Since he has a girlfriend back in New York, she tries to pretend she's just a friend, but everyone sees right through her. William's mother, Elaine [Frances McDormand], who has already alienated her daughter, Anita [Zooey Deschanel], is reluctant to let William go. She gives in when he promises to be back in time for high school graduation and swears he won't do drugs. He keeps his word on the drugs, but the tour and the group mesmerize the kid. He winds up on the road with them for weeks. It is, to say the least, an interesting trip. <br />This is perhaps the best coming of age movie I have ever seen. It ranks arguably at the top of movies about rock and roll, and it certainlyfeels like the most authentic. The songs performed by Stillwater were written for the movie by Crowe and others, and they fit in seamlessly with the vintage rock and roll tunes played throughout the film. The look and the feel of the 70s is captured perfectly. It was a very different time for music. It was a period when talent and idealism ruled the scene. It would not be long until all pop music was all confiscated by vast corporations. You see the beginnings of this process in the movie when a creep from the record company comes in to replace the band's long time manager and friend. <br />The acting is all world-class. Francis McDormand and Kate Hudson were deservedly nominated for Academy awards, but the whole cast is uniformly excellent. <br />This movie has a lot of drama in it, but it also has a lot of laughs. It remains upbeat more often than not. It has heart, something that is lacking in many films, but it is never sappy or sentimental. it touches you without making you feel manipulated. It is, I suspect, the best movie of last year. <br />Rated R for language, drug content and brief nudity. [I disagree with the MPAA on this one. I think Almost Famous is perfect for teens. Did they expect it to be historically inaccurate just because what was cool then isn't cool now?}
B000002C4J|4.0|I have always liked Celine Dion...ever since her American debut in 90 with the hit &quot;Love Can Move Mountains.&quot;  This is Definatly one of her best albums (Along with &quot;Falling into You&quot; which is her other best) and shouldn't be missed on any fan.  As with me if you enjoyed the smash hit &quot;My Heart Will Go On (Love Theme from Titanic)&quot; then you'll like the rest of the songs, as they fit in well together...ranging from mid upbeat (Which she is Best at), to ballads.  I also enjoy the single &quot;To Love You More.&quot;  This one is an extended version which shows off a talented violinist (Whomever he/she may be)! This song was also the theme of the movie &quot;The Quest For Camelot.&quot;  My Absolute fav on this album occurs at the very very end of the Album which is the Album's title song &quot;Let's Talk About Love.&quot; - It's PHENOMINAL! You really have to hear it to believe it.  This is one of the Best albums and If you enjoyed the singles releaed check this one out!
B00004Z4WR|1.0|Producer Jerry Bruckheimer is one of the most successful people in the movies. He has a formula for action pictures which has been as successful as it has been critic proof. He's the man behind such blockbusters as ConAir, The Rock and Armageddon. Gone in 60 Seconds is his latest production, and even by Bruckheimer standards, it's run-of-the-mill. To his credit, I imagine Mr. B. is the only producer on the planet who could get away with spending [that much money] on a remake of a low budget 1974 movie, but that's exactly what Gone in 60 Seconds is.<br />Memphis Raines [Nicholas Cage] used to be the top auto thief in Los Angeles. When his mother told him his brother Kip [Giovanni Ribisi] was going to turn out just like him, he did the right thing. [\\"I didn't do it for the money I did it for the cars!\\", he exclaims.] He moves to a small town and opens a go-cart track. Well, wouldn't you know it? Kip turns out just like Memphis anyway. Now Kip has made an enemy of Raymond Calitri [Christopher Eccleston], a lowdown Brit who seems to control the grand theft auto market in LA. Raymond gives Memphis a choice: Either steal fifty cars in seventy-two hours or stand by while Kip is whacked. Memphis rounds up some of his old crew. These include his old mentor Freb [Robert Duvall] and his old flame Sara [Angelina Jolie]. Meanwhile, police detective Castlebeck {Delroy Lindo], who regrets he didn't nail Memphis years ago, gets wind of the plan and attempts to stop it. Memphis finds himself squeezed into the middle between the law and the lawless.<br />The story goes from the preposterous to the absurd and back again, but in a Bruckheimer movie, story always takes a back-seat to action. The problem here is that most the action isn't all that exciting. It's rather soulless, with one predictable event following another in a sort of paint by numbers fashion. There is one very well done car chase, but one such scene in this kind of movie is hardly sufficient. <br />Gone in 60 Seconds has three Oscar winning actors among its stars. Sometimes in an otherwise mindless movie, this is a bonus, but not in this case. Nicholas Cage has no character development. He's essentially the same guy he was in ConAir. Angelina Jolie has a very small role, despite the fact she gets second billing. Robert Duvall gets to say a lot of inane dialog with a straight face. These are not stars doing their acting thing. These are three stars just working for a living. I am sure they were paid most sufficiently. They were cast simply as part of the Bruckheimer formula, which says that you've got to have a big name or two above the title. In other words, he believes you can fool many people through conspicuous excessiveness. Usually, but not always, he's right.
0783225482|1.0|I wish this DVD had the trailer.

B00003CXE7|5.0|Film, more than any other art, has the wherewithal to create an epic tale. One reason is that the medium is literally larger than life. The screen exaggerates everything. Another reason is that most people who make movies are gamblers by nature. They often invest staggering sums of money on a single movie. Sometimes, they hit the jackpot. The three most successful movies of all time are Gone with the Wind, Star Wars, and Titanic. Each had an epic tale to tell. Each cost a fortune, made back an even larger fortune, and became legend in the public's eyes. Since Titanic was released just three years ago, it appears that this form of movie making is as popular as ever. This year we have Gladiator. Financially it did well, though grossing nowhere near what the Big Three did. Artistically, it's as good as almost epic I can think of. It certainly disproves the notion that the 'sword and sandal' movie is dead and buried. <br />The place is the Roman Empire. The time is the Second Century AD. A Roman army, led by Maximus [Russell Crowe], is ready to wage a decisive battle against fierce Germanian troops. Winning the battle will bring to Rome and its emperor, Marcus Aurelius [Richard Harris], peace for the first time in years. Marcus has been at the battle front for many months and is now joined by his children, Cummodus [Joaquin Phoenix] and Lucilla [Connie Nielson]. After the battle, which is a most intense and brilliantly orchestrated piece of film making, Marcus gives Maximus, whom he loves like a son, many new responsibilities, though Maximus wants nothing more than to return to his farm in Spain and to his wife and son. The treacherous and insane Cummodus, terrified that Maximus will prevent his succeeding to the throne, plots to have Maximus killed. While the hero escapes, he pays a terrible price and winds up becoming the gladiator of the title. Lucilla, who also loves Maximus, can do nothing, for fear that Cummodus will harm her young son. <br />In Gladiator RussellCrowe has finally found his way to major stardom. He is perfect as Maximus, giving him a macho facade that masks a loyal, caring and intelligent man. Joaquin Phoenix gives the best performance of his career to date as Cummodus. The two actors make formidable onscreen adversaries in several chilling scenes, most of which take place in a nicely rendered vision of the Roman Coliseum as it might have appeared all those years ago. Connie Nielson gives the wily and brilliant Lucilla a majesty reminiscent of Cate Blanchette in Elizabeth. Bringing added depth to the movie are three older actors - Richard Harris, Oliver Reed and Derek Jacobi. Harris and Reed were major stars in their own right in the early 1960s and early 1970s. Sadly, Reed died just after completing his role, and Gladiator is dedicated to him.<br />Director Ridley Scott is one of the best, bringing elegance, style and substance to most of his movies. He had directed such diverse pictures as Alien, Blade Runner and Thelma and Louise.
B000003TAR|5.0|Nevermind is what Nirvana is obviously most known for, it's a great album indeed, but lacks the true claustrophobia Kurt had while recording this, the bands greatest offering.  <br />The Pixies influence is very present, with it's quite to loud, soft to powerful passages apparent on Rape Me, Heart Shaped Box, and others.  While less mainstream songs like Tourettes, Scentless Apprentice, and Radio Friendly Unit Shifter have a more punk edge to them.  And unlike Nevermind, In Utero doesn't feature one lackluster track, Dumb, Pennyroyal Tea, and All Apologies are some of the bands best songs and while the album didn't have the Smells Like Teen Spirit hit it's a more intresting listen.
0060392886|5.0|A true testimony to life in the 80s as a rock band living in Los Angeles.  From unlikely start to the roach infested Motley House to lavish million dollar mansions and all the nuts and bolts in between.  Being a huge Motley Crue fan and a musician myself I picked up this book to see what decadent really meant.  <br />Your worst nightmares will come true with every single turn of the page in this 400 + recount of lives that have no business walking the earth still.  The stories litter your mind with fantasies of and questions as to how they were even able to preform every night.  Nikki, sorry man, get over the past, we all have parts of life we would rather not delve back into let alone a great deal of typed pages.  Vince, if you do not get choked up with the story about Skylar then you have no heart beating inside you.  Mick the outspoken of the group has endured a much worse life than the evils of drugs can bring you.  Tommy, well not much to say here.  Tommy is his own man and if that isn't obvious reading his account then I do not know what is.  <br />Additional stories written by those close to the band add a nice outside view of the band.  If you find that you are not a fan of Motley Crue, but find that you are a fan of music, then this is a must read.  It will distort your mind of celebrity excess and will fuel your emotions to what you may have always wanted to experience in life.
B00003CXPJ|1.0|First off, it doesn't even deserve one star.  This has got to be one of, if not THE worst movies I have ever seen.  I did not laugh one time and could not even finish watching this awful movie.  I can't imagine anyone spending money for this truly pitiful excuse for entertainment.  Not only was the writing bad, but it was one product placement after another.  Was this supposed to be a movie with a message or a feature length commercial?  Ben Stiller was bad and should be ashamed to have ever written the script.
0375501851|5.0|The friendship of Samad Iqbal, a Bengali Muslim, and British Archibald Jones is hilarious. Their cultures and behavior are so different, yet their good fellowship endures. Samad, through an arranged marriage, weds Alsana, also a Bengali Muslim. Archie marries a very young black Jamaican woman, Clara, after his first marriage ends. Their roles as parents become quite trying, however, when another British couple, Joyce and Marcus Chalfen, involve themselves with the Samad's twin boys (Millat and Magid) and Archie's daughter (Irie). Suddenly the younger generation breaks loose from the teachings of their parents and the novel just takes off!<br />Teenage rebelliousness and culture clash highlight this novel. The story deals expertly with parent-child relationships, religion, race, culture, friendship, marital relationships, and ethics. Everything is done with compassion and very sharp humor. This is a surprisingly mature and insightful book for a young first-time author. A remarkably inventive plot and great writing make this a must read.

It seemed that every time I had to stop, there was some adventure that had just begun.<BR>     <BR>     It starts out with a struggling family who owns an inn. One day, an adventurous seaman, known as the \\"cap'n\\" comes to their inn. Once the pirate dies, the inn owners son, Jim, starts to check out the cap'n's chest that was in his room. Jim discovers a map that leads to Captain Flint's buried treasure.

During the trip to Treasure Island, Jim makes the startling discovery that the people working and sailing the ship are planning to overthrow the captain and his men. Once there, Jim, the captain, the doctor and the squire sneak off to the other side of the island. This leads everyone to war as Jim meets a castaway that had been on the island for three years. This man helps Jim and the other men to saftey, while the leader of the pirates, Long John Silver, continues to hunt for the treasure.<br />     Jim and the castaway take control of the pirates ship and are soon looking for treasure themselves. Jim, wandering about on his own, falls into the clutches of the enemy. This creates commotion as the castaway and the other men try to free him, but cannot. The pirates are soon out looking for the treasure again with Jim and make it to where the treaure should be. To their surprise, it is gone!<br />     The doctor and squire kill the other pirates, except for Silver, and take him and Jim to the castaways cave. The castaway, having been on the island for three years, had found the treasure and carried it all to a hidden cave by the coast. Inside the cave was also meat that the castaway had hunted for. Jimand the others make it to the cave and move the treasure onto the boat.Then they sail away and everyone lives happily ever after (except the pirates).
B00003CXXP|5.0|I can't understand how many people around here thought low of the movie.  The movie to me was amazing.  Acting, direction and the story was great.  I realized that we should never ever mess with humanity and everything that makes it human.  The movie tried to present us what it means to be human, leaves us asking...does being human just mean being flesh and blood?  Or does it qualify when you can think, feel and dream?  The movie also tells us the consequences of our ambitions in playing God, how much effect it leaves to us and how much damage it can leave to many, mentally and emotionally.
B000001GRZ|5.0|Of the five versions of the Bach cello suites that I have heard -- Rostropovich, Starker, Yo-Yo Ma, Casals, and Fournier -- the Fournier in my opinion must get the nod as the finest overall. Ma seems mannered to me, and Starker a bit on the dry side. The Casals is important historically, but I find it stiff in its phrasing. There are moments in the Rostropovich set that I treasure above the corresponding moments in the Fournier, but the sound is muddy and Rostropovich's intonation is, honestly, not all it could be in all instances. The Fournier is beautifully recorded, despite the rough spot noted by several other reviewers, rhythmically assured, deeply felt, noble, and completely in the service of the composer. It is thoroughly beautiful. If you like Arthur Grumiaux's version of the solo violin sonatas and partitas, you will like this version of the cello suites.

B0000065O1|5.0|This is an hour long circuit workout that mixes a little kickboxing, a little yoga, high rep weight work and one of the best lower body toning routines on one tape, ever. This is Cindy's second offering and she is much more confident. Her form is good and it's a glossary is included showing you how to perform some of the more difficult exercises, safely and how to modify if your range of motion is limited. The lower body work is comprised of kickbox moves, lunges, sumo squats, regular squats and some cool non-traditional moves. I guarantee you will feel this in your hamstrings, glutes and quads. The Abs work is traditional but very effective. It's split into two sections with toning work sandwiched in the middle. You'll need a set of 3-5lb weights for the toning section. You'll work your chest, biceps, triceps, shoulders, lats and back using the high rep low weight method. It's easy enough to slow it down and increase your weight and Cindy gives good form pointers here. Next is the yoga flavoured back strengthening work followed by more abs and a fabulous stretch. Each section ends with a 30 second + break for rest and water. You'll see Cindy taking these and it's clear that she's done the workout all the way through. <br />This is my favourite ever workout tape. It's not easy to do and it's a workout that, as Cindy says, you can grow with. I've owned this tape since it came out and have always been satisfied with it. Although it's hard work, I always feel energised and ready to do it all the way through again after completing this workout. Cindy is refreshingly genuine and not at all intimidating. I have all three of her tapes and this is the one that stands head and shoulders above the rest. Brilliant, strengthening, very good for improving your stamina and when it comes to body toning, this is the BEST. <br />I wish this was available on DVD!

B000050HTO|5.0|Bob Dylan has had one of the longest and most prolific careers of anyone in popular music, spanning 40 years and two generations - writing nearly a thousand songs, releasing some unseemly percentage of those, putting out over 40 albums, selling millions, influencing untold multitudes of people, and irrevocably changing the face of popular music. Consequently, it is absolutely impossible to condense one of the greatest, most prolific, and certainly most memorable and important musical careers in our time to a mere two discs. This is especially so, as it was Dylan, after all, who pioneered the concept of an album as an album, and not just a collection of random songs - but instead as one flowing composition with a consistent mood and set of themes. Also, the man has written such an incredible number of songs that you could release an entire boxed set and still not include all of them (indeed, this has been done twice.) Still, if you are absolutely steadfast on the point that you must get into Dylan with a compilation, then this is where you should start (if you're willing to shell out the bucks for it, the 3-CD Biograph boxed set is an overall better introduction - though it does not cover anything past the early 80's. The first two (or three) Greatest Hits albums purchased together would do the job about as well, but this is a more economical and concise package.) The set is laid out in chronological order, and you can see Dylan progress from the early 60's revolutionary acoustic folkie, to rebellious electric troubador, to country gentleman, to maverick rustic singer/songwriter, to the big-band sound of the late 70's, to his \\"Christian trilogy\\", to his occasionally uneven years of the 80's, to his creative rebirth in the late 90's. Most of the absolutely essential songs are here - one need only look at the tracklist - and you can get a certain feel of why Dylan is so great, so important, and means so many different things to so many different people from this album- but then again, you'll never be able to tell, from its handful of songs included here, just why Freewheelin' was such a revolutionary album when it was released; how the half-electric Bringing It All Back Home revolutionized popular music and caused Dyaln to receive more than a few death threats; how, from its single included cut, Highway 61 Revisited is (rightfully) considered to be one of the finest rock records ever produced; how Blonde On Blonde, at 70+ minutes, 14 tracks, and 2 records, is the very definition of a magnum opus; Tangled Up In Blue and Shelter From The Storm, great songs though they are, cannot possibly capture the relentless sorrow, heartbreak, and melancholy of Blood On The Tracks; ditto for Bob's dark, depressing 1997 masterpiece, Time Out of Mind. And, as always, \\"Greatest Hit\\" albums, by definition, will almost always invariably leave off the stunning album tracks that are really the centerpieces of an artist's catalog: Chimes of Freedom, It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding), Desolation Row, Sad-Eyed Lady of The Lowlands, Idiot Wind - these are the true masterpieces of Dylan's catalog, and you'll never get a feel for them through any compilation. Still, for what it is, this compilation works almost invariably well. One can certainly quibble over absent tracks (Hard Rain, I Want You, and Every Grain of Sand come instantly to mind), but what is here is unarguably grand and immaculate. Kudos, also, to Sony for including Things Have Changed (though this was just undoubtedly the \\"record company incentive\\" on their part to get the people who already own everything else on here to buy this album), his masterly new track from Wonder Boys, as well as Not Dark Yet from Time Out of Mind (my personal favorite Dylan album) - his recent masterpiece that recently won a poll as Bob's Best Song Ever. <br />Once again, I say, if you're looking to get into Dylan, and your preferred method of entry is a compilation, then start here. But, for Bob's sake, don'tlet it be your last word on the man. If you do, and thereby miss out on one of the richest and most important catalogs of music of the entire century, then you will have only yourself to blame.
B000001E18|5.0|This isn't the first amazon.com review I've written about this album.  I am a die hard U2 fan and love and have reviewed every single one of their albums.  My first Zooropa review focused on the songs themselves, but this, my second review of zooropa focuses on something else.  On this album, U2 have made an incredibly unique sound, so much so, that unless you are a complete and total rock/pop buff and have heard nearly all the music of those genres there is to offer, you might not be able to think of another album by another band that has quite this sound to it, so relaxed, effortless, dancy, euphoric, electronica, lighted-hearted and at the same time very heavy.  It's that unique sound that makes this a great album(although I think all of U2's albums are great).  How many bands can say that they made an almost totally unique sound in the world of rock/pop.
B00003CXXP|1.0|Dark, Dreary, Depressing are just some of the words used to describe this bomb of a movie. This is truly a movie to forget. I expected a light hearted E.T. type of movie. Instead I got a movie that at times bordered on the psychotic. I could not and would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy and would not recommend it to you.

It is not simply a story about the hole loved ones leave when they are gone. It is not a story about mental illness, not really anyway. It is incredibly well written, riveting, funny sad and worth the time.

B00000273M|5.0|This is a fantastic collection of songs by the most under-rated girl group of all time.  I've been a Bangles fan for a long time, and it's great to see them back together recording a new album and a tour to follow sometime this year.  There are 14 songs here, each one an excellent song.  All of the classics you remember are here.  'Eternal Flame' is quite possibly the most beautiful, romantic love ballad of all time.  Their soaring harmonic vocals are simply amazing.  'In Your Room' is very upbeat and catchy, and I love to play it on guitar.   'Manic Monday' is a great song all about not wanting to go to work and wishing it was still Sunday.  Who could forget 'Walk Like An Egyptian', a cool song and a cool dance move.  'If She Knew What She Wants' is a slow, melodic rock song with a good guitar crunch and sweet harmonies.  'Walking Down Your Street' is upbeat, with a cool guitar riff and a great drum beat.  'Hazy Shade Of Winter' is a very, very cool version of the old Paul Simon song.  It has another cool guitar riff, and simply amazing vocals that are right on time and never miss a beat.  'Be With You' is a cool track about wishing you were with a certain person that you just can't have.  It is upbeat with lead vocals sang by the drummer Debbie Peterson.  Also 2 previously unreleased tracks, 'Everything I Wanted' and 'Where Were You When I Needed You'.  These songs bring back some great memories for me.  If you're a Bangles fan, or a fan of great 80's music you should absolutely love this. Pick this one up, and be ready for their new album coming out this year, it's gonna rock.  I can't wait, Rock On!

Those who didn't like the movie seemed to be unable to identify with the characters/subject matter.<br />Everything seems to work for the film.  There is not a single contrived moment in the film.  Instead we have a very natural and realistic story that could very well take place in reality. <BR>Those who complained about the tedium, the uneventfulness of the film seem to expect a film to *do* something for them, whether that is accomplished by spectacular special effects, a fast-paced eventful storyline, etc..  In that case there are so many other movies that will fit your bill there.  There was much going on in the film that was subtle yet quite powerful and beautiful at the same time.

B00005JKZQ|2.0|**1/2 About the best thing that can be said for \\"Showtime\\" - a throwaway buddy cop comedy starring Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy - is that it demonstrates that an inferior script can be at least partially overcome by first-rate performances.<br />You can't go too wrong when you have acting talent of this caliber working for you.  De Niro and Murphy portray two LAPD officers who are recruited to be the central \\"characters\\" for a new \\"Cops\\"-type reality TV show, wherein a camera crew will follow the two on their appointed rounds as they chase suspects, round up criminals and, all in all, make the streets of LA safe for the common, decent citizen.  De Niro's Mitch Preston is a reluctant participant in the series, while Murphy's Trey Sellars is a wannabe actor with stars in his eyes who sees this as his golden opportunity to make it big in show business.<br />The initial problem with \\"Showtime\\" is that it feels more like a \\"high concept\\" exercise than an actual movie.  Despite the fact that there are a number of funny moments in the film, too many of the scenes fall flat both as comedy and as action drama.  The saving grace is that De Niro's understated cynicism provides an effective counterpoint to Murphy's over-the-top enthusiasm, resulting in just enough comic tension to wring laughs out of even the weakest of material.  It is a joy to watch these two pros at work and they are nicely complemented by Rene Russo as the driven TV producer whose brainchild serves as the excuse for the story.  William Shatner, playing himself, also generates some laughs, often at his own good-natured expense.<br />Yet the film itself is a failure.  One of the prime dictums of the screenplay is to try to show the discrepancy between police work as it is portrayed on the screen and police work as it really is.  In fact, the film opens with veteran De Niro instructing a class of elementary school children about the mundane realities of life on the job.  Yet, the film betrays its own theme by itself indulging in all the inane shoot-em-up and car chase scenes it is supposed to be satirizing (the scenes are not exploited for comic effect, which might have lent some much needed satirical bite to the proceedings).  Even worse, the \\"serious\\" side of the story, involving drug deals and gun running, fails to generate any interest or suspense.<br />Oh well.  De Niro and Murphy are such likable comic actors that the movie, for all its many weaknesses, manages to whiz by without inflicting too much boredom and pain.  \\"Showtime\\" is a completely forgettable and innocuous little time waster, but fans of these particular actors will at least appreciate their efforts.by itself indulging in all the inane shoot-em-up and car chase scenes it is supposed to be satirizing (the scenes are not exploited for comic effect, which might have lent some much needed satirical bite to the proceedings).

0375703861|5.0|This book gives voice to all of the &quot;Others&quot; not usually given center place in Literature. Zadie Smith loves her protagonists in all their faults, complexities and strengths. This novel bursts with life and love of it but never simplifies. It respects the complexity of life and at the same time insists on the overarching forces that drive us. This is the best novel i read this year. The fact that this novel present a real depth in the treatment of her main themes is amazing because it is also HILARIOUS!
B00003CXXP|5.0|I don't understand how A.I. could possibly have received so much disrespect and poor reviews.  It makes no sense??<br />I had heard from a friend, that the movie was a disappointment.  I didn't care.  It was a KUBRICK idea.  Kubrick confided in Spielberg.  How could it possibly go wrong?<br />Upon viewing it, I strongly disagreed with my friend.  The movie is beautiful.  A tremendous performance by Haley Joel Osment.  The images are unforgettable.  The story is heart-warming, yet disturbing at the same time.  The effects are fantastic, but low-key.<br />Odd. Yes.  But what Kubrick movie isn't?  Kubrick had a unique vision.  That was what made him a genius.  Simple stories told in extraordinary situations.  Normal and relatable characters put in extranous situations.<br />Spielberg directed A.i. after Kubrick suddenly passed away.  Yet, Spielberg managed to capture Kubrick's style in a lot of ways. The elaborate echoing sets that seem to put off a vibe of loneliness.  The feeling of entrapment and overpowerment by the authorities and corporations of the world around us.  Not to mention, the multi-layered characters.<br />Yet, he still managed to keep a lot of his own.<br />I personally think it's a fantastic mix.  Which, again, makes me wonder how this movie hasn't received more respect.<br />Oscars or not, like all Kubrick movies, ten-years down the road, everyone will look back at A.i. and find a new respect for it.  Unlike most movies that come out these days.  Movies we forget twenty minutes after viewing.

B00003CXXO|4.0|I feel incredible sadness.  David's uniqueness was also the source of his alone-ness.  How cruel then to program this being to love and seek love in return from one other, Monica.  Longing for love is particularly poignant in a child.  The power of science fiction to prolong this longing over a couple millennia shows David's extreme sincerity of his longing.  I thought it particularly sad that David was able to accept the love of a facsimile of Monica (admittedly a very close facsimile) which I as a human did not find as cathartic.<br />Although the story at times came across as contrived, the movie works on the strength of the performance of Haley Joel Osment as David.  It also benefits from an unusually strong supporting cast, which included William Hurt and in particular, Jude Law.<br />The science fiction is in the vein of Asimov's I,Robot stories.  I thought it was wonderfully brought to screen.

B00005JKQX|5.0|Russell Crowe plays John Forbes Nash, a brilliant schizophrenic in one of this years best film's. A Beautiful Mind dive's deep within the world of Nash's brain with more twist's than a roller-coaster. After the main secret is revealed, more thing's happen that question's what even you know. It makes the audience feel the lost assuredness of whether what we know is real or fake, and that is one of its many qualities. Ron Howard has always been a stand out with his films. From Apollo 13 to Willow, Ron Howard has developed into a director at the peak of his form.<br />Though Nash is Socially awkward, he manages to steal the heart of a student who is to become his wife. Played by Jennifer Connelly (yeah, Labyrinth) in a fine and realistic tone, Alisha falls in love with John Nash and hold's him up through his illness.<br />The Math depicted in A beautiful Mind was actual math, made to resemble the deteriorating illness from its less complicated measures to its chaotic and disoriented forms. Also, the math represent's his relationship's, which was an effort some filmmaker's wouldn't have taken. Leave it to Ron Howard.<br />In one of the first sequences in the film, there is a 360 degree steady-cam shot of John Nash, decifering codes for the FBI. This shot was done to represent the spinning wheels of Nash's mind. It was also my favorite shot in the movie. It caused an urgency and made an exciting feeling from what could have been just an ordinary scene.<br />The Math wasn't the only thing created from reality. The Therapy sessions and method's were well researched for authenticity. It was reported when John Nash (now 73) and his wife saw the film with Ron Howard, John couldn't watch these scenes, and his wife had tear's streaming down her face. It was like post trauma for them, and too difficult to see again.<br />A Beautiful Mind is one of most rewarding movies I've seen in a long time. It is my hope that Hollywood continue's to create project's with as much substance and emotion as A Beautiful Mind. Whether it recieves an Academy Award or not, it doesn't take a society of appointed panelist's, nor a gold-sealed manilla envelope to determine my vote. This will be on my shelf of favorites as soon as it becomes available. ~SAOS~d emotion as A Beautiful Mind.

0812550706|5.0|Having never been a fan of sci-fi, I was more than a little iffy about undertaking Ender's Game. Since it is usually considered \\"classic\\" sci-fi, I decided to be open-minded and give it a shot. I'm incredibly glad that I did, because this book was nothing short of touching. <br />Ender Wiggin grows up in a futuristic society where families can only have an allotted number of children, and the Wiggins's just happen to be allowed to produce three incredible geniuses. At the age of 6, Ender enters a battle school where he will be conditioned and trained to be the greatest of intergalactic commanders, destined to save the world from the latest and largest alien attack that Earth has ever seen. The fate of the world lies in the hands of a boy genius with hopes, dreams, and a family that he must leave behind to fulfill his duty. <br />Card does an exquisite job tapping into Ender's young, but extraordinarily advanced mind. There is a mixture of childhood longing and ageless maturity that makes Ender a tragic and inspiring hero. With surprises at every turn, breathtaking tension, and heart-wrenching characters, Ender's Game can stand proudly as a classic far above any labels that might be tacked to it.
0316776963|4.0|David Sedaris has proven himself a very talented writer. His insights into French life, speech impediments, and even eating ones hat are among the funniest I've ever read. ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY is a must read for fans of satire, France, and anyone who wants to laugh uproariously.<br />   Sedaris tells many stories on varied topics. Whether he is discussing his speech impediment i.e. a lisp or Americans on a Paris subway, he does so wonderfully. Sedaris crafts his words magically to compose a hilarious story each time around. Few writers can do as he has done. Anyone who appreciates humour and writing as an art form will love this book.<br />    If you disapprove of foul language, sensitive topics such as AIDS, or mockeries of the French language, this book is not for you. Including these things is a must in the overall craft and perfection of Sedaris' work. It is advisable to merely overlook these things if they bother you. If you cannot overlook such things, you deprive yourself of a wonderful reading experience.<br />   This book is utterly delightful. Nearly every one of the pages  has something to make the reader cry from laughter. One can only hope that Sedaris will publish more books of this magnitude. For if he does not, he will rob the world of 'pretty' funny stories. Buy ME TALK PRETTY ONE DAY and be prepared to laugh often.

With the casting of an unknown Russell Crowe alongside the likes of James Cromwell and Kevin Spacey, Hanson cemented the film's place as a classic. Buy this masterpiece today!<br />   In 1950s Los Angeles, all is not as perfect as one might lead you to believe. There is a wave of violent crimes after a crime boss's arrest. Now, it is up to three officers to try and find out who is behind the horrid crimes. Their journey through a world of glamour, glitz, and utmost corruption. This journey makes for a wonderful film.<br />    If you do not enjoy crime dramas, a bit of profanity, or even Russell Crowe you will not like L.A. CONFIDENTIAL. Younger viewers may not be suited for the sometimes graphic images of crime. However, anyone who wishes to see a dark, funny, and masterful film should buy the film version of James Ellroy's L.A.

0553573403|4.0|I haven't read a lot of fantasy but I've read Robert Jordan, Terry Brooks, and a couple others. Jordan takes 3 books to tell a story fit for one book. Way, way too much describing without a whole lot of plot movement. Brooks is fun adventure storytelling without very deep characters. George R. R. Martin tells a different story. This is not a book for the kids. There's brutal violence, graphic sex, and some naughty words:) Lots of good stuff. If you expect great wizards, magical fairies, and grumpy dwarves on a rollicking adventure, this is not the book for you. This is about family, trust, politics, and war. Like many have said there are no traditional 'good guys' or 'bad guys'. Oh there are evil, bad people and there are brave, honorable folks; sometimes they are one and the same. And don't be surprised if the 'bad guy' saves an innocent life while the 'good guy' takes one.<br />Ok, the good:<br />Characters come alive with Martin's wonderful prose yet I never felt bogged down with too much description. You never know who lives and who dies. You will enter the minds of a variety of people including a sharp-witted dwarf, bastard children of rulers, wannabe kings without kingdoms, lords with the weight of the world upon their shoulders, and a young girl with petrified dragon eggs. In other words, there is no central character. This book also keeps a pretty good pace. There is a lot to cover and I felt it was done well.<br />Now the bad:<br />If I had to come up with some negatives, the biggest would probably be the sheer number of characters. In the negative reviews this tended to be an issue. You must have a little patience to get through the first quarter to a third. Many characters have similar names and there are a lot of mindbending factions. This can be very daunting for a new reader. People who also expect a lot of high adventure will be disappointed. This is NOT an adventure novel. The closest I can comparte this novel to is Stephen King's \\"Eyes of the Dragon\\". There is death and quite a bit of it but this is not a Shannara book. If you are still reading, then you must be interested. Don't let the complexity of the book turn you away because you will not be disappointed.re is death and quite a bit of it but this is not a Shannara book.

Is a good piece of art good because of the hype behind it or because of its cohesive / coherent message and content?  This movie displayed so very little cohesivensss and coherency.  It looks like pieces stollen out of 4 to 5 movies most people have already seen (wizard of oz and 2001 to name a few).

B00005BJ2O|5.0|If I had the energy, I would write a review for anything remotely related to Moulin Rouge.  It was one of the best movies I have seen in ages, and the music certainly had to do with such a feeling.  Without it, the movie would be just another cheesy romance with some pretty  cool direction.  But as a movie musical, Moulin Rouge shoots to the top, with great adaptations of classics like Like a  Virgin, a Roxanne tango, and the superb Elephant Love Medley.  The quality of the new music is also extremely high, with Come What May the best by far.  One of the best parts of this soundtrack (and the second) is the singers--Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are amazing!  Their great voices really lend credibility to the music, and they are so heart-felt and expressive. Kudos to everything that is Moulin Rouge, especially the music.

Jones has a smoky, sultry, mellow quality, far older sounding than her years (22!).  Most of the tracks are just great, particularly the opening one.  Personally, I don't consider this jazz singing, more Western/country/pop in style.  (I mean, can you imagine Diana Krall singing Hank Williams?)  Then again, this isn't country western singing, either.  (Wynonna Judd has never been this supple or intimate.)  Maybe Jones is her own thing.  In any event, she's THE REAL THING.
B00005QDW5|1.0|Well, some people might get into Floyd because of this compilation and that's always a good thing but as far as I'm concerned Gilmour and company can ride the gravy train to the slightly dusky side of the moon and they won't recapture past glories. Money seems to be more important to people than art these days but if this twitching dead horse of a band ever decides to release something worthwhile and say to hell with the sales figures then the people that these millionaires owe their money to would be delighted to hear some of the out-takes, BBC and live recordings left in the vaults. That would be very nice thankyou but a coffee table compilation for the fashion victims seems to defeat the object of there even being a Pink Floyd in the first place.
0553573403|5.0|I'd been suffering from Fantasy Novel Attention Deficit Disorder for months before I found A Game of Thrones! I was tired of rereading the great stuff like the Amber Chronicles and Lord of the Rings, and tired of getting bored after reading the first few pages of juvenile treatments of the genre...such as Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind and even, yes, the great Weis and Hickman (I cut my fantasy teeth on their Dragonlance novels as a teen, but now I can't get through a chapter). Apologies to all you fans of the aforementioned, but they don't come close to the subtle and mature read of A Game of Thrones. The magic in this novel is there for just the right amount of accent and is not used as a deus ex machina prop. The language is melodic and, at least for me, lends itself to the easy recollection of multiple characters. The plot and atmosphere are unique, and Martin often offers tiny morsels to enjoy (even the use of the spelling \\"Ser\\" for \\"Sir\\" is a nice touch). I haven't finished reading the thing yet, but I know I will finish this and greedily devour the rest in the series! Trust me on this one, if you find yourself a hardcore fantasy lover and can't stand the overly-magical, redundant fantasy trash out there now, invest in this book! It'll rescue you from its mediocre counterparts.
B000002AH7|4.0|Interesting... to say the least, a little stiff but -- it's all good!
B000002MJC|2.0|Ok Ill admit it,for me Depeche Mode are and always will be a synth pop band. For them electric guitar/organic instruments simply don't work. And imo Depeche Mode realise this as they've proven with their latest return to their synth roots with Exciter. Ive given this 2 stars as it's still DM and has some pure electronica but I simply can't &amp; will not tolerate electric guitars on their records..It's like when Neil Young went 'techno!?! Simply put if you want the REAL DM get everything pre &amp; including Violator,ignore this &amp; especially Ultra as they are travesties. Especially what I consider DMs peak,Construction Time Again &amp; Some Great Reward,two unmitigated synth pop masterpieces. Peace!
B000002MTU|4.0|I was at the beach 6 or 7 years ago, it was late, I had my Bourbon and coke in hand, the cable was on... and the PBS show Spotlight came on... featuring Clapton, and a lot of material from this album...  it was really cool. Eric showcased a track, explained the influence it had on him, how the song was done, history of the song, the originator etc....  very insightful.  This album I believe is Claptons labor of love.  He REALLY loves this music, lives it, relishes it, studies it, knows it inside and out.  I picked up the Cradle and also saw a tour which featured the bulk of this material.  Heck, I got an education just from those 3 experiences.  Thanks Eric, I owe you one!
0780631684|4.0|Bored of the slasher revival? Ever thought the average slasher was too silly for you? Congratulations, you are an intelligent person. And if you also enjoyed the suspense filled chapters of \\"The X-files\\" you may also want to check this movie.<br />Glenn Morgan and James Wong worked on the above mentioned Mulder & Scully adventures, and it shows. \\"Final destination\\" has the wit, the apealling suspense and the intriging storylines that made \\"The X-files\\" famous, and also skillful and tense suspense scenes, while the plot follows the adventures of set of characters who have escaped death recently. But what if they destiny was to have died? Bodycount follows as death itself tries to finish the job, and the main characters start panicking. <br />If you are not into the slasher genre, please don't be cheated by  the headline of this review. \\"Final destination\\" is much, much more intelligent and stilish than a slasher, although its plot pays a kind of a homage to the genre (main characters are students, for instance).<br />If you enjoyed \\"The X-files\\" and you are into intelligent horror, this movie is a MUST SEE. Seriously.
B000059T00|4.0|Okay, It is a great album, er I mean release -- for all of those readers who have never had the pleasure of listening to vinyl crack and pop -- It is musical, it rocks in a cool, intelligent way, it was VERY progressive at the time.<br />What do I like about it today?  I'm in a geezer band, and we worked up Sea of Joy and Presence and you know what... they are an absolute blast to play, improvise upon and ROCK with...  I mean these are canvasses which allow one to really kick in some contribution.<br />Classic pieces like this, ALWAYS go over well at festivals.
B00004U8P3|5.0|Classic man against nature conflict.  Nature wins every time.  I love this movie!  It's witty, funny, and action packed.  The dinosaurs look so real;it's amazing.  Even their movements looked realistic.  Whenever the cable goes out, this is the movie I watch.  I believe it has the best plot and storyline of any of the Jurassic Park movies.  This is a great movie even after all this time.
B00000I2UC|4.0|This turned out to be the first JAMC album I would buy, though it was certainly not the last.  My older brother wore out LP copies of 'Barbed Wire Kisses', 'Darklands' and 'Psychocandy' claiming each album was better than the one before it.<br />So I picked up where he left off, just a whimsical purchase if there ever was one.<br />The crisp production did little harm to the album; 'How the Gods Kill', 'Raw Power', 'Never Mind the Bollocks' all sound like they should be blaring out of a convertible cruising somewhere down route 66.  So does 'Automatic.'  Although the drum machine detracts a little bit from the overall impact of the songs (for evidence, check out the \\"Sidewalking\\" cousin: \\"Gimme Hell\\", which utilizes live drums), they're still the most rockin' A-sides the brothers Reid would ever put out.<br />\\"Coast To Coast\\", \\"Blues From a Gun\\", \\"Between Planets\\", \\"Head On\\" and \\"Here Comes Alice\\" represent the true nature of the Chain, and are probably their most underrated tunes in a reasonably vast catalogue of fuzztone pop.<br />Pick it up and be amazed at your own discretion.....
B0000542DG|3.0|A group of teens are kicked off a flight when one of them (Devon Sawa) has a vision of the plane exploding in mid-air.  The vision comes true, and death itself begins to hunt down the survivors.  One of the smartest and most entertaining of post-Scream thrillers, this one moves at a brisk pace with an intriguing premise and a lot of surprisingly involving dialogue.  A bit too silly and contradictory at times, but the death scenes are gruesome and imaginative, and yes, the final scene is a scream.  Good performances from Devon Sawa and Ali Larter and Seann William Scott is hilarious as the sympathetic loser.<BR>*** 1/2 out of *****
B00005JKYS|2.0|I Think this movie was very well made.  I am a younger viewer and have just gotten interested in war movies.  This is one of the best I've seen.  You really got to know what the characters were feeling and you got to see all sides.  There was the point of view of the soilders, the enemy, the wives, and there is even a seen with the enimies wife.  At times it was very intense and other times you felt really bad for the characters.  The movie made a real impact.  When we left the theater nobody was talking it was silent.
0345404475|4.0|as the title indicates, I consider Phillip K Dick one of the fathers of modern science fiction along with Robert Heinlein.  This is the only book of his that I have read, but I am well versed in science fiction and cyber punk.  The book is strong, the writing style is typically sci-fi, fairly straight-forward with periods of techno-babble which later make sense.  THe plot is interesting and thought-provoking, and when Kurt Vonnegutt wrote about sci-fi authors in Breakfast of Champions, I think he must have been thinking of PKD.  This is science fiction as well as philosophy, and I recommend this book.  If you like it, I also recommend you read Neil Stephenson (Snow Crash, oh yeah), Orson Scott Card (Ender's Game), Robert Heinlein (The Moon is a Harsh Mistress), and whoever it was that wrote Neuromancer, I forget his name.  All of their books rule but the ones I mentioned were my favorites.
B00005BJ2O|3.0|It is a little strange that Moulin Rouge is such a great movie, with such astounding music, yet it cannot spawn a decent soundtrack CD.  In striving to find the balance between pop CD and musical soundtrack album,  it delivers neither.<br />&quot;Moulin Rouge 2&quot; includes songs I wish had been on the original soundtrack, but is still disappoints.  The fantastic &quot;Smells like Lady Marmalade&quot; is noticeable missing.  It makes me wonder if they could not get the rights from Nirvana.  &quot;The Pitch&quot; is included, but not the full film version.  There are some unneeded remixes that add no value to the CD.  I would have loved the full version of &quot;Le Tango de Roxanne.&quot;<br />I hope that a true musical soundtrack will be released, with all of the &quot;Original Film Version&quot; songs in order and with the relevant dialog included.  Baz did a great job of resurrecting the film musical.  Keep up the good work with a two-disk soundtrack CD.
B00005JKZQ|1.0|My viewing of this movie was eagerly anticipated but that anticipation turned out to be the highlight. Not only is the plot disappointing, there is just no chemistry between DeNiro and Murphy. In fact, most of the time DeNiro looks bored and Murphy overacts.
0446677450|4.0|I thought Kiyosaki did an excellent job with this book.  Most subjects are vague, and could be more informative.  I found myself wanting to know more about certain aspects that weren't fully covered.<br />However, this book has a lot of good information.  I was extremely pleased.  It's not a get rich quick book, it's about training your mind to become financially diciplined.  Kiyosaki lays a solid foundation for you to embark from. <br />I am definatley reading his next book...
B000002MY3|5.0|This CD provides a vent to any pent up anger you may have as a woman. From being dumped on to having some stranger call you sweetheart, it provides an outlet for life?s frustrations. There is nothing better than cranking it in your car after a hard day of work and singing at the top of your lungs to relieve stress.<br />It also provides a pick-me-up with tunes like &quot;Head Over Feet&quot; about falling in love. <br />If you liked &quot;Thank You&quot; (from Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie) and had wondered where the other songs went that sounded anything like it, you can find them here in this universally superior Alanis Morissette album.
B000001Y2U|5.0|Antichrist Superstar is a great album.  It combines many different types of musical styles and it actually sounds good.  The album starts off with the terrific Irresponsible Hate Anthem.  Manson does a lot of screaming during this track, and I love his screams.  The Beautiful People is a bit worn out by radio, but it is still a good track.  Dried Up, Tied Up, and Dead To The World is not one of my favorite songs, but I cant say that I dont listen to it.  Tourniquet is pretty good.  It has a really good guitar riff.  I love Little Horn.  It is quite the headbanger I believe.  Cryptorchild is a good example of the different musical styles.  Its kind of creepy.  Deformography is quite good, but Manson should scream the Dirty Dirty Rock Star part more.  I dont really care for Wormboy.  Mister Superstar is pretty good.  I cant say enough about Angel With The Scabbed Wings.  It is probably my favorite song on the CD, and one of my favorites period.  Kinderfeld is sort of like a story, and it is a good song.  Antichrist Superstar is a very heavy song, with really good lyrics.  1996 is the most angry sounding song on the CD, with Manson screaming through pretty much the whole song.  Minute Of Decay is great.  The song builds up, and i love when songs do that.  The Reflecting God has some very nice lyrics, and some good riffs.  The Man That You Fear is a very creepy song i think.  I love the intro.  Antichrist Superstar is a wonderful CD. Your CD collection wont be complete without it.
0393307050|5.0|As I write this review, \\"Master and Commander\\" has been commented upon by 100 other reviewers; how is one supposed to weed through the criticism?  I suggest reading the few one-star reviews.  From them, you will learn that if you require a numbing series of Clancy-esque action passages to entertain you, this book probably won't.  Second, some people detest being challenged by the subject matter of their fiction; if there is going to be anything that can remotely be described as esoteric, the author should carefully connect the dots to avoid any suspicion that he might be talking down to his readers.  O'Brien is particularly annoying to those with such concerns, because he has no qualms about targeting the 19th century groves of academe as his readership.  He appears to presume that we all have a working knowledge of botany, entymology, biology, geography, socio-economic theory, classical music, the British navy, and sailing ships (each as it existed in the Napoleonic era) as we read. That may indeed be somewhat arrogant.  It's also impressive and highly entertaining for many who might find their interest in these various subjects piqued by the many references to them.<br />This book and the many that follow it in the series do not play well to the lowest common denominator; for example, the protagonists Captain Aubrey and Doctor Maturin are not always sympathetic; each has fundamental flaws that sometimes make them difficult to like.  All of this being said, \\"Master and Commander\\" is accessible to any patient and thoughtful reader who doesn't demand comic-book simplicity in his or her fiction.  The book is uproariously funny in certain passages, but it is the kind of humor that only becomes apparent three pages later.  The delight in the joke itself is magnified by the joy in discovering it.<br />O'Brien won't patronize you, and you may feel comforted by piling several reference guides around you as you read, but this book's pleasures are exponentially greater thanthe cheap payoff from a formulaic potboiler.  If you don't mind actually exercising your brain as you read, if you like tightly drawn characters and have even a passing interest the glory years of the British Navy, you'll probably love this.  I suspect, however, that even you will not be able to read this book in less than a few sittings.  This type of prose is meant to be slowly chewed and digested, which is why the fast-food types just don't relate.
B000063V8R|5.0|o.k. now the series is great. After the first two so-so seasons we finally got the Star Trek we wanted. Not a carbon copy of the original but something with life and energy. If you want to defend the first two seasons that is fine but, this one and the ones that follow are far superior. I'll probably pre-order this one before I even go buy the others. If you liked the show but do not want to shell out three hundred dollars just to get to the good stuff then start here.
B00005A1PR|5.0|The beautiful album, &quot;Acoustic Soul&quot; by India Arie, has to be one of the best and most unique albums that has come out over the last year or two.  And it simply astounds me that India did not win even ONE Grammy!!  What were the judges thinking by overlooking her and giving the awards to the less-talented Alecia Keys???  Don't get me wrong, I think Alecia is talented too.  However, the problem I have with her music is that it lacks originality, and she uses a lot of the same old cliches that we have all heard before (&quot;I keep on fallin' in and out of love...&quot;).  Hmm...doesn't sound like a very original theme to me.  India, on the other hand, brings us an entire new sound and flavor of music.  She uses a wonderful blend of soul and r&amp;b, along with her catchy acoustic guitar, that draws the listener into what she has to say.  The opening track, Video, is one that we have all heard before, and probably the track that got many of us interested in purchasing the album in the first place.  It has a very catchy rhythm, with very inspiring lyrics, especially in today's society where girls and women are very self-critical of themselves.  India shows us that it is okay not to have that perfect &quot;supermodel&quot; figure and appearance.  Equally catchy songs include &quot;Promises,&quot; &quot;Strength, Courage and Wisdom,&quot; and &quot;Nature.&quot;  <br />On the flipside, India includes several gorgeous ballads.  Some of the most notable ones are &quot;I see God in you,&quot; &quot;Simple,&quot; &quot;Beautiful,&quot; and my personal favorite track off the album &quot;Ready for love.&quot;  If you haven't paid much attention to this track, I highly recommend that you give it another listen.  India's vocals are absolutely wonderful, and the haunting echos in the song gave me chills the first time I heard it.  <br />I guess by now you can see that I really admire India and her talent that she has shared with all of us on this album.  There are manytalented artists out there today, but India is very unique and you won't hear many others like her.  If you haven't already picked up &quot;Acoustic Soul,&quot; I recommend that you go out and get it.  It will not disappoint!
B000002I27|5.0|I've yet to hear a Doors album I didn't like. That said, I enjoy &quot;Strange Days&quot; above any other Doors work, including the multiple &quot;Best Of&quot; compilations that have been released throughout the years.<br />This is one of those rare works where both the music and the lyrics stay powerful from the first track to the last. We hear several wonderful pieces familiar to the casual Doors listener like &quot;Love Me Two Times,&quot; and &quot;Moonlight Drive.&quot; <br />But the rest of the album isn't just filler. This is one tight and clear selection of tunes that all had potential to be hits. &quot;Horse Latitudes&quot; is a brief but chilling narration by Jim Morrison, and &quot;My Eyes Have Seen You&quot; is --in my opinion-- the most overlooked songs in the Doors repetoire. This song has a surreal flowing beat and dreamy lyrics that gives that personifies that psychedelic flavor that The Doors are known for.<br />Many feel the songs on &quot;Strange Days&quot; are some of The Doors' darkest imagery. I can understand why they feel that way; but there is such a gentle flow to the music that I actually find soothing, with &quot;Horse Latitudes&quot; being the only pure haunting Guajardian piece on the album. This album is surreal in parts and sweet in others. This CD is one of the most complete albums I have ever heard.
B00005UQ9F|4.0|This is a thinking man's thriller that gets under your skin and makes you think about the show, long after it is over.<BR>The atmosphere and setting at the condemed loony hopital sent shivers down my spine!!!<BR>If you are into action packed thrillers with good kills you are probably going to be dissappointed.<BR>But this underdog of a film gets two thumbs up from me!!
B000002H72|3.0|Pixies second major LP was doolittle. Good LP from a really influential band. The only problem with the pixies was that they were a little too ahead of their time. The pixies were basically the blue-print for most of the modern rock bands of the nineties, including the smashing pumpkins, nirvana, weezer, bush and others. Basically, everyone who ripped them off kind of did what they did better. But they started it and deserve credit. Its just that after listening to bands that improved upon their ideas the pixies themselves don't seem as fresh. Check out the song &quot;I bleed.&quot; It later became known as undone-the sweater song by weezer. Also gouge away sounds a bit like smells like teen spirit.
0394716787|4.0|This edition of Poe's literary output is the latest incarnation of the original 'Complete Tales & Poems' which came out in 1938 issued by Vintage Press.  It has served several generations of students and Poe lovers.  Needless to say, it's longevity is proof of basic quality and integrity.  For the record, it also includes Poe's two essays, 'The Poetic Principal' and 'The Rationale of Verse.'  If you want a 'complete in one volume' approach.  This is it.<br /><br />Truth be told, there are a few technical drawbacks to this edition.  The first is size.  A thousand pages is a lot to deal with.  I always feel clumsy reading it.  The other big drawback is print size.  I am well into the time of life when tiny print is getting difficult to read.  Nor do I like narrow margins.<br /><br />But really, I don't think one can argue about the sheer quantity of good literature for a reasonable price.  It can be read, marked up, dragged around and have coffee spilled on it without ever making its owner feel the least bit guilty.  Most of the Poe readers of the world will just love this book.  Me, I'm a bit wierd.  I would rather have a nice leather bound set of the complete works, rather than just the fiction and poetry, a bit slimmer to hand and easier to read.  Considering that that would cost over 20 times the price of this paperback I intend to remain satisfied with this even if it kills me.
B00005JKJA|1.0|When David Lynch makes a great film, we get masterworks like Eraserhead and Blue Velvet.  When he makes a dud, we get a crock of excrement like Mulholland Drive.<br />The film begins well, to be fair.  But soon the sense that Lynch is repeating himself came over me, and I sat there not giving a damn about the characters or plot events.  The now famous/notorious plot machinations seem more born of desperation than of any real artistic impulse.<br />This is one of the very worst films ever made, from one of the finest filmmakers alive.   Let's hope that next time Mr. Lynch gets it right.
B00000JQFM|5.0|This album may sound a little 80's at times, but you can't go wrong with picking up the best little gem of instrumental guitar playing. It's also a wonderful music album that can hardly be matched.<br />All the tracks are just plain cool and well done. Among the highlights though are the title track which just plain kicks the door down with an awesome intro by Satriani. Then comes &quot;Crushing Day&quot; a nice rocking song. Then is &quot;Always with Me, Always With You&quot;, the wonderfully orchestra sounding &quot;Hill of the Skull&quot;, my favorite track &quot;Circles&quot; which starts off slow before getting to a rip busting solo by Satriani. Then it's last but not least &quot;Echo&quot;. This album is a masterpiece that will stand the test of time along with Jeff Beck's &quot;Blow by Blow&quot; and Steve Vai's &quot;Passion &amp; Warfare&quot;. Get this album first though then explore the other two.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I've been reading some of the reviews. It is quite intriguing that this film is either loved or hated. Very few reviews are in between. Why?<br />I guess it appeals to sentiment, to gut feeling and instinct rather than thought and reason. Anyway, what is love? \\"Love is fire that burns without being seen\\". How to capture that evanescent, unreasonable character of love in a film?<br />It can't be done with a nicely woven plot and well behaved script. A whole lot of \\"love\\" movies are just that, so they strike everything except love. They just fake it, like Satine with her clients.<br />Well, this one doesn't fake it. In a sort of strange and clumsy way (I am a ordered person, after all) that may frighten the more ordered folks like me out there.<br />Buy a bottle of good scotch (I kind of prefer it to absinth :-)), sit down and watch the movie again. You'll see it all makes good (and crazy) sense! Love is not reason, you know.
B00000J2PH|5.0|as we did back in the day.I bought this when it was first released on vinyl and it has taken me all these years to get it on cd, shame on me. I had forgotten how I used to love her laid back style. Every song is so great that even after all these years I find I remember most of the lyrics.I remember it was so good to listen to this album along with James Taylor, Carly Simon and the like after rockin' the night away. This music is timeless and will be enjoyed by every generation.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|Those are the three best words to describe this movie. It's the first time I've ever been on the edge of my seat for a movie that starts at the end! Guy Pearce gives a fantastic performance and the rest of the cast off his torment perfectly. I felt very drained by the time the end credits rolled....or are they beginning credits??
B00005OAIE|5.0|Ok I don't know why you are insulting John Mayer's music. This is my favorite CD, which I had a hard time giving up last night when a hallmate wanted to borrow it. But I did give it to him in order to spread the John Mayer-love. I saw John in concert at TLA in Philly on Feb. 21st and it was an awesome show. He is an EXTREMELY talented musican and singer and the songs really connect with whoever listens to them. I LOVE this CD!!
B000003TBP|5.0|While I was in college at St. Edward's University in Austin, Texas. I heard this cd a lot from my college roomate. He introduced me to Beck. And I will never be the same after listening to Odelay which is the most unique and one of the best musical albums ever.<br />Odelay helped break many barriers that would be repeated by Carlos Santana. Probably a few others. Beck combined a bunch of different styles on one cd that spinned in different directions. In fact so much diverse every day I would hear a different song off this album from my roomate and thought it was a different artist, but it was still Beck. Odelay is truly a unique album and it's highlights are \\"Devil's Haircut\\", \\"Hotwax\\", \\"The New Pollution\\", \\"Derelict\\", \\"Jack-Ass\\", \\"Where It's At\\", \\"Sissyneck\\", and \\"High 5\\". It's the most interesting piece of music put out and truly helped redefine what a well written musical album is. Thank you Beck. And don't forget to pick up this disc today.
0553583182|4.0|EZ (as in simple, easy, uncomplicated) but not simple (as in thick). Murphy explains how the laws of nature all work together to get what you want. Although the book could do with fewer pages -  because of all the examples - there is a point to these examples: repetition. Repetition is a way to get new skills/behaviour in your subconscious mind. If you're into affirmations then this book is the one, it's probably one of the earliest written. Murphy quotes the Bible showing that the Book is not about an outside God but God lives inside everyone.
B00004Z459|5.0|I love this CD!! At first when i listened to it I thought it was a bunch of noise makers screaming into a mike, but it grew on me. I can listen to that CD anytime and i can totally get into it!!! They were my first hard rock band and now I am metal crazy!! Don't get the rap thing wrong though, because it isn't solid rap, thank god but it mixes the two and comes out great!! If you are looking for a great band to rock out to this is the one for you!!
B000002I7H|5.0|What does it feel like to be an outsider? Like this.<br />  Albert's recorded output could be inconsistent at times, but that's certainly not the case here. Pure unmitigated pain, Memphis electric style. Almost too much for one sitting.
0800177177|4.0|This is one of my favorite Dracula tales. It has a nice gothic feeling. I liked Oldman, he has a charming yet creepy manner that worked really well. I also liked Winona Ryder as Mena, she was very effective. Good acting and atmosphere make for an enjoyable spooky tale well told.
B000002MFE|5.0|This album created a trend that wouldn't go away, at least for a couple of years. This is the finest work of Clapton, and one of the most mesmorizing performances ever. My sophmore year of high school I listened to this disc for the first time, and it still is quite captivating today.<br />All the tracks on here are worthy of listening to. They are wonderfully constructed pieces, and very easy to listen to. They defined what \\"unplugged\\" was supposed to be. And they made Eric Clapton thrust back into the limelight where he belonged. Among the discs best tracks are \\"Before You Accuse Me\\", the wonderful sad song about his son's death \\"Tears in Heaven\\", the slow version of \\"Layla\\" (this is the first version I actually heard so I am partial to this one instead of the version by Derek & the Dominoes), \\"Runnin' on Faith\\", and \\"Malted Milk\\". This is Eric Clapton at his best, and a great testament to a great guitar player. And it's a great introduction to blues music along with Stevie Ray Vaughan's Greatest Hits, Jimi Hendrix Electric Ladyland, and BB King & Eric Clapton's Riding with The King. Almost any recording by John Lee Hooker, Robert Johnson, or Muddy Waters as well. Pick up this disc today you will not regret it.
B00003CXXP|1.0|I had high expectations for a Speilberg movie and the young actor Haley Joel Osment, who plays an artificial boy. (robot)  It is a s-l-o-w movie.  I never did understand why his \\"mother\\" really chose to keep him.  It was predictable that his \\"brother\\" would re-enter the parents lives. David yearns to become a real boy after his trouble making \\"brother\\" insists on the book Pinnochio being read to them.  It was appalling when the \\"mother\\" took him to the middle of nowhere to dump off her responsibilities.  (reminded me of Hansel and Gretal meets Pinnochio)  He then searches to find the blue faerie to get back with the mother that abandoned him.  The most dependable character in this movie for David is this toy bear.  The bear's animation is incredible, that is why this movie even earns 1 star.  However, the bear is almost creepily real and I expected his to turn into an evil Chuckie doll at anytime.  The movie goes on and on, seemingly not knowing when to end, and when it does you are not even rewarded with a \\"good feeling\\" about the outcome.  The only good feeling I got was \\"thank goodness it's over\\".
B00003CX95|5.0|Usually 3 hours is too long for a movie but in this case it was fine. Fast paced and touching, this film is really one that most people should own. <BR>If you liked Rob Roy then you'll most certainly like Braveheart.
B00005JSGK|5.0|This movie has been a part of family since I was a boy.  We used to march around the house to the sound of &quot;The Elephant Walk&quot; playing on our piano.  The comedy is great, scenery amazing and it is one of those calssic stories taht you just don't get tired of.  I hope to share this gem with  my kids and promise that no one buying this video will be disappointed.
0140186409|5.0|I will never forget how this book captivated me in so many ways. An American classic that will stand the test of time. I got the pleasure of being assigned this book in 10th grade as part of literature class. I was forever changed by this book, and helped fuel me to read more challenging books.<br />John Steinbeck helped me to realize the poverty, the trangressions, and some hope of the Depression. It helped put me in focus with the pride problems that the family had during the collapse of an entire society during America's most trying times. It is well written and very captivating. It had me in tears more than once. It also reads much like The Bible at times, in its prose and style. It catalogs a family's journey from farmers to migrant workers that is easily readable and a classic that helped define a generation.<br />A great book- and a must have.
6305364648|5.0|Great action flick.  Cannot believe the helicopter scene and Jamie Leigh's dance scene.  Glad I have this on DVD, it's easier to pause than a tape.  Buy this if you can, it's well worth it.
B000002UAX|4.0|The Beatles had started their decline at this point (Then again, they never actually rose 'till Rubber Soul - before that they were brainless teenyboppers). They had put their best album (Revolver), their most experimental album (Sgt Pepper), and their best movie (Yellow Submarine) behind them. Magical Mystery Tour, while containing some of their best moments (I Am the Walrus, All You Need is Love), was nothing new. Then they released the White Album, which broke no new ground, except in the cover department and Revolution #9. Granted, its an excellent cd, but its just a look-back on their previous styles. It threw in some new stuff, but not much. After that, they put out Let It Be (don't have it) and Abbey Road (their totally unexpected second-best). Favourite Tracks: Glass Onion, While My Guitar Gently Weeps (George's best Beatles song), I'm So Tired (Basically the late-nite sequel to I'm Only Sleeping), Blackbird, Helter Skelter, Cry Baby Cry, and Revolution (both of them). There's also some not-so-good stuff like Birthday and Everybody's Got Something to Hide...<br />All in all, worth your money, but there are better ones. I'd suggest getting Revolver, Sgt Pepper, and Abbey Road first.

B00004Z459|5.0|I am just as much a skeptic of bands that are derived from today's rap-metal scene...and after hearing all these other bands and Bizkit-influenced types, I must admit that LP have something to share that is intense, original and satisfying.<br />From 'Papercut' to 'Pushing me Away', this CD just does not stop - it is in your face, heavy music that makes you step back and think at the same time that you are heaving a beer into the air for it's sheer volume, beat and intensity.  Like TOOL, these guys are not copping in on some sound that sells - they are into it and are proud of it - and the sheer intensity of their vocals and playing say it.  Heck, why would a band like this be up for Grammys if there was nothing there?  Funny to me though, as I sometimes think that the Grammy folk have to add one 'edgy' band to round out the nominations - but,... glad it was LP!!!<br />This CD is a MUST in any collection of today's music - as wild as it is in parts, the overall feeling that one gets is one of anger, sorrow and self-realization - better that the message of the hair bands of the 80's, eh? (drink, party,... etc...)
B00003CXE7|2.0|Equal parts Hollywood spectacle, extraordinary computer special effects, simple Goodie v. Baddie plot and maudlin sentiment. Russell Crowe (and this is a fellow Aussie writing here) proves conclusively that Best Actor Oscars really are given away with the Cornflakes. Save your money or buy &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;, or even &quot;Harry Potter&quot; - much more fun and much, much less pretentious.
B00004VXF2|5.0|Just a small ripple in the sea of music released in 1975, \\"Metal Machine Music\\" came and went...fast.  And for good reason.  For most,this record was nothing more than noise.  It was for me.  I was into Ambrosia, Crack the Sky, Genesis, stuff like that, and just getting into Reed and VU.  What was this crap!?  Fast forward 20 years and add to my musical knowlege Varess, Reich, Adams, Schoenberg, Briars, Zappa's \\"serious\\" stuff, Fripp & Eno's \\"No Pussyfooting\\", Sonic Youth, etal. and suddenly this recording made sense.  It is still not for everyone, but for me it is ESSENTIAL.  If you recognize any of the above names and like their music buy this recording.

0385505833|5.0|I wanted something \\"light\\" to read after plowing through two lengthy non-ficture best sellers. Something to \\"enjoy\\" and not have to think of dates and places. My husband thought I had totally lost it when I sat in the recliner, laughing OUT LOUD for goodness sake, over a small book! Not only could I visualize what was happening to this poor family, I hoped desperately that this would become a Christmas classic movie - Luther -poor bumbling Luther! He just wanted a simpler holiday season - and like the rest of us - the harder he tried, the more he was sucked into the whole commercialism of the season. This book truly was the highlight of this holiday season!
B00005AQF7|5.0|After having heard several more recent Snoop albums, I decided to buy Snoop's oldest and allegedly \\"best\\" solo album. I have got to say that this is the best album that I have ever heard. This CD is better than some \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilations. There is not a single track on this album that is not worth listening to every time you play it. Snoop's rhymes, the beats, hooks, and guests are all incredibly tight. I also have Tupac's Greatest Hits, and let me tell you, Doggystyle alone gives it a run fot its money. EXCELLENT ALBUM!
B00005JKOI|5.0|PRETTY IN PINK is one of my favorite movies.  It combines love, comedy and relationships w/ both friends and family.  Not only is Molly Ringwald a great actress, but there's Duckie too!  He's halarious.  Though I think the original ending would be more suitable (Andy ending up with Duckie rather than Blair), it still is a fabulous movie.  I love it!
B00005JKQX|2.0|I love Amazon ratings but it seems to me that the people who are motivated to write either love it or hate it.  Since there is someone out there who would give five-stars to anything, I tend to blow past the five-star ratings and head directly for the rips!  Call me crazy but I figure if I respect the post as actual criticism then I can rely on it.  So here goes mine...<br />First (and please stop reading if you don't want to be tipped off to anything), you get drawn in to a really intruiging world only to have the rug yanked out from underneath to you.  What you are left with is a world that is NOT really all that interesting.  If you've seen the film tell me am I wrong?  Wasn't the first part really kind of interesting?  Weren't you wishing that it wasn't BS?<br />Second, I have no idea why Alicia falls in love with Nash.  Did he do unexpected things for her?  Was it his genius that attracted her to him?  Did she see a side of him that his colleagues did not?  I have no idea.  I would like to have known.  It might help to explain why she didn't dump his toosh when he almost drowned his baby.<br />Last, whether you are an actual Good-Will-Hunting or at least ever have had an intuitive moment in your life, I'm sure you can be intruiged by a person who's ability to make \\"quantum leaps\\" goes far beyond what you experience in everyday life.  The film DOES revolve around Nash's intuitive ability, it just doesn't seem to care about it.  What are those things he's writing on the windows?  And come to think of it, why is he writing on those windows?  <br />The film just seems likes it needs more than Nash's abilities to justify itself - so it adds conspiracies, then the horror or 50's psychiatric care, then Princeton's \\"challenge\\" of accepting Nash for who he is.  The filmmaker can't seem to decide what his priorities are.<br />On the other hand, this film is light years beyond anything in the \\"New Releases\\" section of your local video-store.  There are other films that you can find if you look that will mean more to you.  But then again, you could do alot worse than to see this film.  I actually reccomend this film, just remember that it was approved by the people who hoped it would wind up as a \\"Best Picture\\" candidate.  Know what I mean?
B00003CXPJ|1.0|There's a scene early in \\"Zoolander\\" in which a posse of male models pulls up to a gas station, after which a playfight ensues with windshield sponges and, soon after, gasoline pumps. Being that the movie portrays male models as idiots, one of them lights a cigarette, causing a gigantic explosion that wipes out everyone but the main character. Heaven forbid he should die, lest we not be able to witness the next hour and fifteen minutes of banality that awaits us. One might be tempted to ask, \\"Why not kill him now, thus putting the movie out of its misery?\\" <br />That being said, \\"Zoolander\\" is one of the most uninspired comedies ever made, an amalgam of fashion parody and social satire that goes wrong in so many ways at so many times, it's almost physically painful to watch. It's plot is easily the year's most mind-numbing, it's characters some of the most idiotic people played (surprisingly) by credible actors. <br />The film has a twin from earlier this year, \\"Josie and the Pussycats,\\" which was one of the year's worst films. \\"Zoolander\\" is easily worse, tailoring its lifeless characters to a brain-dead plot that involves the recruiting of insipid male models in the major assassinations throughout the years. At the present, a major fashion corporation is in danger of losing its factory workers to a new child labor law in Malaysia, and thus fixates its plan of wiping out the prime minister on male model Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller). <br />Stiller's presence onscreen as the halfwit title character is not a welcome sight, nor are such events as a male model awards show, in which Derek is stripped of his yearly award by newcomer Hansel (Owen Wilson). Enter dipstick reporter Matilda Jeffries (Christine Taylor), who's out for some dirt on fashion mogul Mugatu (Will Ferrell), in charge of brainwashing Derek's mind (does he even have one?). Derek and Matilda pair up, looking for answers to his whereabouts after he goes missing for a week... oh, does it really matter? Will anyone really care enough to pay attention? <br />My problem with \\"Zoolander\\" is simply this: it's completely mind-blowing for all the wrong reasons. After witnessing the atrocious assault on my patience in \\"Pussycats,\\" I thought I could sit through anything, but this film takes stupidity to a whole new level, practically stripping the audience of its common sense as we watch its characters parade around in silly costumes and a humorless plot for what seems like an eternity. It's attempts at comedy are desperate and obvious, and makes for one of the most blatantly mindless movies in ages. <br />The cast takes on the challenge of looking like unrelentingly dimwitted fools in front of the camera, and anywhere else, this might serve as an outlet for some hearty laughs. But even Ben Stiller, playing Zoolander with all the talent he can muster, cannot make this one-dimensional character, or the equally sloppy material, worthy of one's time or patience. His annoying presence is rivaled by that of Wilson, whose character is equally denied a brain, and by Will Ferrell, who looks like a leftover sketch for Saturday Night Live. <br />My final question is this: why does a movie like \\"Zoolander\\" feel it necessary to blast us every two seconds with a star appearance? There are more cameos and \\"blink-and-you-miss-a-star\\" moments here than I can recall from other films, but the likes of Winona Ryder, David Bowie, Billy Zane, Jon Voight, or even Stiller's own parents, Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara, cannot save the film from being what it is: a \\"shallow, dumb, vacuous moron\\" of a movie that aims for the funny bone and misses by a mile.

B000002NHN|5.0|There are very few words in English that can accurately describe the music on this CD. Haunting would be one, for the lyrics surround and penetrate one's soul in the way that only poetry and music can. It is a beauty that can not be fully described, for words are pale in comparison to the music. Each piece is an engrossing aural experience of majestic beauty and vocals that are both melancoly and sweet at the same time. After a few minutes of listening to Mummers' Dance I was left in absolute awe of the talent that Ms. McKennit has with the both word and muscial note.

B00005JKQX|4.0|In the beginning of A Beautiful Mind, John Nash (brilliantly played by Russell Crowe) is at Princeton struggling to find a bold new theory to distinguish himself. He is a quiet man who does not get along with most everyone around him, and his only real companion is an eccentric roommate. This first half of the movie chronicles his discovery of an ingenious mathematical theory, his marriage to a former student of his named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), and how he comes into working undercover for a government agent (Ed Harris). At this point, the movie falters as we discover that John is a schizophrenic, and that certain portions of the film weren't real at all. Now, he must struggle with this problem with the help of his wife. It is frankly rather insulting to the viewer that we are suddenly jerked out of the reality that was the first half of this film. No longer does the movie explore his \\"beautiful mind\\" or the steady development of his character, now the movie is only interested in people walking around him that nobody else sees. Granted, his story is one of triumph by the human spirit, but we've seen it all before in much more sensible ways. Still, the love story between John and Alicia  is a strong plot element, and most everyone delivers a great performance. In the end, it feels rather heartwarming, but also somewhat stale. If I were voting for the Oscars, I'd give it Best  Actor, Best Supporting Actress, and Best Adapted Screenplay (for its usually clever dialogue), but Best Picture? Best Director? I don't think so.
0375701427|5.0|This is the first Philip Roth I've read since the Zuckerman Bound omnibus novel was issued in the late eighties, and I must say that, if this is any indication, I'm delighted and impressed with the direction his fiction has taken in the last decade or so.  Gone is the self-absorption and Roth's tiring fixation on sex as the center of his fictional universe.  In its place is a wide-ranging and devastating portrait of America in the 1960s, and a latter day deconstruction of the fabled American Dream so self-contained and complete that I honestly think it does for 1990s American literature what the Great Gatsby did for the 1920s. <br />Nathan Zuckerman is still with us, but here Zuckerman is an aging, increasingly asocial author who, through the medium of Swede Lovov, is attempting to encompass and comprehend the quirks and tragedies of his generation.  Who is Swede Levov?  The All-American hero: blond, handsome, a high school football and basketball phenomenon, clean Marine, and heir to a glove-making fortune.  The Swede is also Jewish, and he passionately believes that he has successfully lived by the rules of and gained access to Gentile American society, with all its supposed rewards.  So when he marries a former Miss New Jersey and moves out of Newark and into a two-hundred-year-old farmhouse in bucolic Old Rimrock, New Jersey, it looks like the Swede is ready to settle into a long, happy, and prosperous life--a true American pastoral.<br />Yet come the 1960s, the Vietnam War, and the radicalization of his beloved daughter Merry, things go tragically awry.  When Merry becomes a fugitive from the FBI after bombing the local post office, the Swede struggles to comprehend what went wrong, not only with his family, but also with the America in which he once had such an unshakable faith.  <br />What impresses me most is how Roth manages to hold American idealism in perfectly poised tension with the dark side of American politics and economic individualism.  The Swede is a compssionate, thoughtful man who deserves success and happiness, yet he is such a stereotypical representative of American idealism and blind allegiance to the American Dream that he is inevitably singled out for victimization.  In brutal contrast to everything the Swede believes in are the betrayals and lies of Vietnam and (eventually) Watergate.  Lurking in the background too is the urban wasteland of Newark, the town of his (and Zuckerman/Roth's) youth, reduced to a ruin in the wake of the 1960s race riots.  According to Roth, someone has to pay for these political and economic injustices, even if that someone is a man as likeable as Swede Levov.<br />Only a writer as gifted as Roth could hold such an ambitious fictional design such as this together.  It's a brilliant success, because you will end up both caring deeply for the Swede, while also realizing that, like Willy Loman, he believed in the wrong dreams and ended up paying a terrible price. I have since read \\"I Married a Communist,\\" the Roth novel that followed \\"American Pastoral.\\"  It interrogates the 1950s in the way \\"American Pastoral\\" does the 1960s.  \\"I Married a Communist\\" is also very successful, but I don't think it matches the sheer scope and scale of what Roth achieves here.  \\"American Pastoral\\" is something of a masterpiece, the culmination of forty years of writing, and you just have to read it.
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|I'm not sure what kind of music the previous reviewer is a fan of, but anyone with a smidgin of pop sensibility will get this one (and probably, if you're like me, you already own one or two copies of the vinyl issues, domestic and UK versions both).  This is Elvis and band at their best, sharpest and wittiest.  Right from the get go, the whispered-into-the-phone intro of &quot;No Action&quot; --- &quot;I don't wanna kiss you, I don't wanna touch&quot; --- pulls you in and locks you in the room.  You won't want to leave, anyway.  Elvis' lyrics will astonish you with their complexity and needle-sharpness, his guitar playing is loud and raw and the Attractions --- the dazzling bass runs of Bruce Thomas, the tight drumming of Pete Thomas and the incredible keyboards of Steve Nieve (everything from hammered electric piano to cheesy-sounding organ) --- jaw-dropping stuff.  And that's only Disc One!  The Bonus disc, for once, is truly a bonus:  demos and outtakes of songs that you only thought you knew.  The demo of &quot;Greenshirt&quot; is a descent into paranoia that's unmatched.  The demo of &quot;You Belong To Me&quot; is great fun (you'll find yourself playing &quot;air keyboard&quot; throughout).<br />I hadn't listened to this album all the way through in a long time.  It made me feel 18 again.  Buy this one, you won't regret it!

B00005OCMR|5.0|When I reviewed TRON in its original DVD release, I gave it four stars and said it was an underrated movie.  Even though I think I made that judgement because I considered the fact that almost nobody really liked the film.  How wrong I was!!  Sometimes I wonder why I didn't give five stars in the first place since I think I am one of the few people who loved TRON.  I should have trusted my instincts.  Now Walt Disney Pictures has released the 20th anniversary collector's edition DVD of a movie that I have always considered my fourth favorite movie.<br />TRON is the first film that experimented with computer graphics animation and scenery, and the fact that it was shot along with flesh-and-blood people made it more appealing.  Jeff Bridges is terrific as Kevin Flynn, a computer programmer who is sucked into the computer world by the evil Master Control Program, and he ends up playing video games which might end up in death.  Bridges is the real show in the movie.  David Warner is fantastic as Sark, the MCP's main man.  But Bruce Boxleitner is kinda sleepy in the dual role as TRON and Alan (TRON's user).  Cindy Morgan didn't fulfill expectations either as TRON's sweetie.  Director Steven Lisberger has excellent conceptions and ideas; however, his storytelling gets a bit sloppy.  In the end, who cares?  I think TRON has become a milestone in visual beauty and boldness.<br />The extras are truly fantastic.  The documentary with the cast and crew is quite revealing, especially when Lisberger and his team explain how they did the CG animation.  The deleted scenes, particularly the love scene which I think was beautiful.  The alternate music by Wendy Carlos is very revealing, and I think the end credits sequence should have stayed with the original Carlos cue, and not with Journey's 'Only Solutions'; also, I think it was quite a good idea to leave the light-cycle sequence without music because the theme Carlos wrote for it doesn't fit at all.  All in all, this is such a fantastic DVD that should not be missed.ntastic DVD that should not be missed.
0887306713|5.0|As a aspiring student for Management, I found this book to be one of the best books. Mr. Collins and Mr.Porras have done a great job in analyzing 18 best companies and also comparing these companies with similar 18 companies....The book which is 2 to 3 years old is still relevant today. <br />The best part of the book is the concept of Core Ideology. This is different from Core Competency as explained in \\"In search of excellence\\". This is the best concept I think and will people to build great organizations. <br />I recommend this book to all those aspiring Management students, Management Students and Managers.

0060930187|4.0|Sylvia Plath simply wrote of her life. The tribulations and upheavels we survive and the depression and anxiety we deal with. This book was one of the best books i personally have ever read. I too am bipolar, and enjoy reading a historical look at one of the worlds most talented writers of all time, and how she coped w/ her depressions. How life seemed to her, how she wrote, how she lived. In vivid and bold motion she wrote imagery like never i have seen before. Almost making things so unbelievable and intriguing that they were too realistic. Her philosophys are trying and dark, but the opposite of sides brings light to the opposition. I personally loved this book.
1573222038|5.0|Reminiscent of THE DRESS LODGER and SLAMMERKIN.  Waters's knowledge of Victorian attitudes toward women, sexuality and pornography impeccable and brilliantly woven with two women's inner lives.  Is the fabric of life a product of nature or nuture?  A Victorian would have said \\"Class Will Out\\" -- being born to a class dictates the character of a person, but what if the child is removed and raised in the streets of London?  Is the child born of a murderer born to hang?  Staggering and engrossing.  Brilliant.
B00005RYLE|4.0|If you're a fan then this is worth buying just for the packaging.  The DVD itself is pretty good, too.  However, the original release of \\"Evil Dead\\" was not widescreen but full frame, so this is a rare instance where the 1.33:1 aspect ratio is the correct version and not the widescreen version presented here.  So, if you want to see the movie as it was originally shown, the elite version is the way to go, but if you want packaging that rocks - get this.
B00003CXI1|2.0|This film was pure, glitzy drivel.  It clearly had no heart.  How sad.
B00004U2GH|5.0|This here Amazon thingy is starting to produce some cool experiences.  I had found out about the \\"Folsom Prison\\" release from the Columbia Record Club.  When I got that and reviewed it, the engine that dumps related items in your face notified me that there was a similar re-release of \\"San Quentin\\".  So after vowing not to be suckered into buying stuff out of here, I gladly plunked down money for this, as well as three other purchases this month.<br />And what a re-release it is!  This was one of the first record albums I ever owned.  While I liked it a lot, it always seemed that it was awfully short for a live album.  Well, this version makes up for it by throwing in NINE numbers not on the orginal release.  It also throws in more patter with the audience, and surprises on top of surprises, we don't hear them bleeping out naughty words in both the song and the patter.<br />The songs are also in a drastically different order than the original.  Whether or not this is still the actual order of performance, I don't know.  I do know that \\"Wanted Man\\" opened the original, and here it's track 10.  This is not that important.  What is is the narrative before the song saying that Bob Dylan and he had just written it.  If that's true, then we get fairly new versions of that, \\"San Quentin\\", and \\"A Boy Named Sue\\".  Which means that this wasn't an oldies package thrown together for a performance.  It was a concentrated effort to bring new material to the public for this event.<br />And unlike the four additions to the \\"Folsom\\" re-rerelease, which were OK but not special, the nine extra ones here really contribute something.  While I miss the horns from \\"Ring of Fire\\" (and wonder what they used here that sounds like ducks singing), the rest really flesh out the entire performance.  Yes, we heard \\"Folsom Prison Blues\\" on \\"Folsom\\", but if that song doesn't also belong on a live \\"San Quentin\\" album, what would?<br />All together a great re-issue of a great artist at his commercialpeak.
B00004U8P3|4.0|Whilst obviously comparable to Spielberg's other big monster movie, 'Jaws', this is still excellent in its right.  Based on the Michael Crichton novel it retains the barest threads of the scientific argument.  Indeed, this argument is mostly represented by Jeff Goldblum who is rapidly demoted to a back seat.  That's not too important though seen as this is the kind of movie that manages to genuinely fascinate its audience with its outstanding special effects.  Even several years on, the sight of the T-Rex clawing its way past metal fencing remains spectacular.<br />Basically this is a rollercoaster ride and little else but for what it is, 'Jurassic Park' is great fun.  Placing its little humans in various apparently inescapable situations seems to be the story, but what situations they are!  There's a car falling through a tree inch by inch, a huge T-Rex and a particularly nasty little one that seems cute and innocent at first.  Most impressively though, it remains pretty scary.  Rather than overusing the big T-Rex, the raptors are much scarier and more efficient at making the audience jump.  One particularly well constructed scene has two kids hiding out in a kitchen which is being stalked by two vicious raptors.<br />The acting, as in many movies like this, is incidental.  Neill plays a pretty flat main character, Dern excels as a feisty archaeologist, the kids are good value, Goldblum is fun whilst Attenborough doesn't appear to do anything.  Most importantly though 'Jurassic Park' grips from the very beginning and will keep you on the edge of your seat.  It's not the most complicated movie ever,..., but it's definitely thrill-packed.
B000063KND|4.0|This album is the Japanese version of the long-awaited \\"A Night at The Opera\\" (ANATO) from Blind Guardian. After more than three years of silence and their masterpiece \\"Nightfall In The Middle Earth\\" (NIME), only a super-release could satisfy the super-exigent listeners that were captivated with NIME about three years ago. As I am among those \\"super-exigent listeners\\" I can't give five stars to this album in spite of its high quality and the exquisite musicianship they have deployed here. Why? Because it is somewhat chaotic and disorganized, it abused of double-bass drumming, its songs are less epic than those contained in NIME, it lacks of \\"feeling\\" (I would say that it's a tad heartless) and it contains too many similar tunes (the songwriting and resources shown in more than a half of its tracks can be squeezed in just a couple songs!). I guess that old die-hard fans of Blind Guardian will love this CD because of its aggressiveness, its intensive work on choirs and its speedy-power-metal sound, but those longing for more diversity and finer music will be certainly disappointed -in spite of the masterfuly crafted arrangements and compositions.<br />Additionally, that title \\"A Night at The Opera\\" makes your expectations rise to the heaven, and you will find yourself quickly landing (or crashing!) after immediately discovering that this ANATO from Blind Guardian has nothing to do with the ANATO from Queen -which was in fact an instant classic. Sincerely, I was waiting for more soul, more variety from song to song, more art and feeling in choirs (I am speaking here even about the choirs of NIME!)... Where is the \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" of this ANATO? Where is here the mosaic of contrasts that Queen delivered once in their homonym release? How did Blind Guardian dare to call this CD ANATO? Don't miss me, this is overall a superb release, full of progressiveness and new experiments, and clever lyrics that will satisfy not only people loyal to Blind Guardian, but I don't think that it can't be compared to the ANATO from Queen, neither to the magnum opus NIME from themselves. Perhaps \\"Battlefield\\", \\"The Maiden and The Minstrel Knight\\", \\"Punishment Divine\\", \\"And Then There Was Silence\\" and \\"Harvest Of Sorrow\\" (the bonus track) are the highlights to this album. All the other tracks are also great (I love \\"Under The Ice\\", for example), but perhaps they wouldn't add too much to the entire recipe, which is in general exaggerated in condiment. <br />Finally, go for it without hesitating, but for me NIME keeps being the best from them - keep particularly that fact in mind when listening ANATO: this is not NIME II. Four stars and a half is a fair score. Go for this masterpiece, but know in advance what's all about.
B000002U9Y|5.0|Bereft of their principle songwriter, Syd Barrett, whose declining drug-induced mental state caused the band to bring in guitarist David Gilmour, Pink Floyd created the album that would set the standard for their early sound. 1968's \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" was the band's second album, recorded and released at a time when the band's future was uncertain, but the product was amazingly vivid.<br />With \\"A Saucerful of Secrets,\\" the songwriting abilities of two members in particular would begin to see the light; bassist Roger Waters (who, in ten years would be the dominating creative songwriter of the group) and keyboardist Richard Wright, whose sound echoed the childlike fantasy of their previous leader Barrett.<br />Waters' \\"Let There Be More Light\\" is a stirring opening track, using characters of science fiction novels and a perfected psychedelic imagery that would blanket the entire album. The cycnical war parody \\"Corporal Clegg\\" foreshadows Waters' fixation with the themes of war and death, while \\"Set the Controls For the Heart of the Sun,\\" another Waters composition, became a favorite live piece, and a classic in the Pink Floyd catologue. Taking lyrics from Chinese poetry, the song possesses a power that brings the listener to a state of utopia.<br />\\"Remember a Day\\" and \\"See-saw,\\" the two Wright compositions, are peaceful and complex, yet unappreciated (even by the songwriter himself). You can almost feel the sunshine when these tracks touch your senses.<br />The album's centerpiece, the twelve minute instrumental \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" is vivid and real, bringing many emotions and senses out of the listeners. Set around a battle or war, the four-part opus is more exciting performed live, but defines some of the band's best music.<br />The closing track of the album is Syd Barrett's final composition with the band, the haunting \\"Jugband Blues.\\" With its complicated lyrics and music, we see how Syd Barrett has transformed from a genius of fantasy to a troubled soul lost in the woods.<br />\\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" is full of spacey imagery and startling bravery with its complex sounds and arrangements. This album paved the way for Pink Floyd's captivating imagination on stage and in the recording studio. An absolute necessity.st in the woods.<BR>\\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" is full of spacey imagery and startling bravery with its complex sounds and arrangements.

B00003CX95|5.0|Funny, but I never realized it was Mel Gibson's and Hollywood's responsibility to teach me history. I thought I went to school for that. When I go to a movie on a Friday or Saturday night, I'm not plunking down my hard earned money for a history lesson. You want historical accuracy? Pick up a book (I read several on the topic) or watch the History Channel. You want a fun movie with great action, a little loving, and some good laughs, see Braveheart.<br />And to the whiny English who don't like being portrayed as the bad guys, should big Bill have been fighting the Turks? Or the Chineese maybe? How about some evil Laplanders or some Sri Lankans with nasty dispositions? You guys warred with the Scots for centuries and eventually won out in the long run so what are your crying about? I guess they should have portrayed you guys as being nice and fuzzy to the Scots, but then that would have kind of defeated Wallace's whole purpose, and the movie itself. Would have been a pretty boring movie if the Scots and the English got along swimmingly, don't you think?<br />It's the oldest formula in existence, the whole good against evil thing. Someone has to play the heavy, and in this case it was you old nasty English that got your butts whooped by the good guy. You want to be the good guys? Make your own movie.<br />And by the way, I have family in Birmingham, UK that thought this movie was a hoot. Absolutely loved it. They however, have never been prone to whining.
B00005YT8U|5.0|Just pop the disk into your CD player and enjoy. This group definitly makes some of the happiest and most beautiful music you will ever hear.  The new Ziggy Marley and the old Sinead O'Connor tracks are great but still luv the old traditional music best and nobody does it better than the Chieftains. I just returned from their St. Patricks Day concert at Lincoln Center in NY an hour ago and my foot is still tapping along to the tunes they left playing in my memory. Great music from a great band!
0553260111|4.0|Soon to be in a multiplex cinema near you starring Matt Damon, Ludlum's super spy thriller is perfect pulp for the \\"Alias\\" or \\"24\\" lover in your family.<br />Jason Bourne washes up on a beach with no recollection of who is is or how he got there. Nursed back to health by a drunken doctor bits of his past slowly begin to come back to him, and with it the danger of his true identity. An identity that many would kill him for.<br />Detailed and intricate the plot is fast paced and action packed. The only down side to it, is it's near cliff hanger ending that pretty much expects you'll have the next chapter of the trilogy ready to go.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Summary:<br />Great movie for kids and adults with lovable characters and side splitting laughter. Great Pixar quality animation, great and imaginative script, great acting voices (Billy Crystal as Mike, John Goodman as Sully) that really fit their parts, high quality comedy (some slapstick) great directing, great music.<br />Review:<br />This hilarious movie delivers side-splitting laughter!  Everything fits together and is just great! Should be animated movie of the year!<br />Story:<br />Monsters work for a Corporation (Monsters, Inc.) That supplies energy for their city, Monsteropolis, by capturing the screams (scream energy) of children and monsters compete for the best screams with blue-furred cuddly Sully (Goodman) leading the competition.  Somehow, a charming infant sneaks into Monsteropolis and hooks onto Sully; and whoever gets caught with her will get \\"cleaned\\" by the \\"authorities\\" - not a good thing! This throws Sully and one-eyed Mike into a panic as they stumble against all odds to send the child back without getting caught.  <br />Scare Factor:<br />While the Monsters may be afraid of the children, there is no need for your kids to be afraid of them.  The movie seems pretty harmless and young children seem to have no problem with the movie concept and scenes.
B00003CXXP|4.0|Great movie, marvelous cast (especially Jude Law).  This movie perfectly illustrates the gigantic human flaw known as intolerance.  Instead of exploited humans, the victims in A.I. are robots originally constructed to conserve resources and assist humans.  Of course, humans reciprocate by ostracizing the robots and destroying some for sport. The situation does merit the question of whether humans need to consider some 'self' improvement before creating androids. Throughout the movie, there is a search for love. David teaches the audience that love is worth any struggle.  An additional 4.5 stars for the super Teddy toy!
B000006MS3|5.0|I did not believe what everyone said about this album. What a fool I was.<br />I've known Kate Bush for a long time and have always liked her work. I got The Kick Inside and Hounds Of Love years ago (and I love them!), but I've always seen \\"The Dreaming\\" as \\"the strange album\\".<br />Then, a couple of months ago, I got it from a local store. It was an import (as Kate has never had any CD released in Brazil) and was a little expensive, but what the hell, Kate was worth a try.<br />I absolutely hated it. Every single song almost hurt my ears the first time I listened to it.<br />Then I read all those reviews you see here and simply could not understand everyone's hype. It could not be possible. Was I going crazy? I had to \\"get\\" the album's brilliance too!<br />I kept trying and listening to it every single day at least once. Then, suddenly, these songs started to grow on me, one by one. The first one (which eventually is my favourite) was Suspended In Gaffa. Then, Sat In Your Lap, The Dreaming, Houdini, Get Out Of My House (that song SCARES me!), every single one started getting me. Now I'm hooked bigtime!<br />Believe me, all of these songs are worthy. Every one tells a story with a diverse and sometimes absurd theme. It's impressive how Kate could think of those themes, create a magical space and take us there.<br />And, yes, the album is timeless. I have never heard any of these songs before January of this year and they do not sound old at all. The drums and keyboards are so perfectly arranged that you can't tell if they were recorded in 1970, 1982 or last year.<br />If I could ever choose one album to call daring, The Dreaming would be it. It is completely understandable that it did not have the chart success the others had, you need to listen to it many times and focus on the lyrics and the rhythm to be able to appreciate it fully. This isn't music you would find on the radio or on TV.
B000009QPE|5.0|...this album is almost 2 good. it has godly (or rather un-godly) guitar work and lombardo is at his peak here boys and girls.
B00003CXXP|1.0|The movie is based on the Pinocchio theme.  The acting by the young actor Haley Joel Osment was great and it was the only thing good about the movie.  The story itself was very poor where the child robot and the adopting mother were subjected to a very emotionally challenging situation.  The child robot is driven to a hopeless situation where it ends up jumping off a side of a building.  As the viewer, we basically see a child try to commit suicide.  I would definitely not recommend the movie if you have young children of your own.  Steven Spielberg might have a lot of power when it comes to movie making but putting his name on the movie credits does not guarantee that you will be seeing a good movie.
B00005Y7AW|2.0|Let me begin this by saying that I *hate* giving bad reviews.  Art, people, food...whatever it is, I always spend a lot of time feeling it before I brand it with 'this' or 'that'.  Some discs you buy just have that unfamiliar newness to them:  you don't know every note by heart, you can't sing along, etc.  But Once you breach that first listen, the strangeness drains away and it grows on you.  I don't want to ruin the adventure of checking out fresh music talent for anyone, but Rufus Wainwright definitely did *not* grow on me.<BR>   Although I felt immense appreciation for the rich velveteen quality of Rufus' voice, it was difficult for me to get past the fact that his music doesn't set the stage for his 'tortured artist' vocal stylings.  In fact, it more sets the scene for a hep Hollywood martini party, all schmooze and pseudo-smiles;  shallow conversation, feigned interest, fake boobs.  It simply does not have enough depth to sustain the profound and simple beauty of Rufus' singing.  At intervals during the album, certain songs borderline on intriguing, but short of the last track (A remix of the Beatle's \\"Across the Universe\\" which is actually pretty cool), the music is dull, dull, dull.  This guy has so much potential...like I said, a killer set of pipes.  But if he wants to develop a fanbase that appreciates his music for it's composition and *not* the obvious counter-culture-cool facade it's attempting to replicate, I think he should let that smouldering subtlety and emotion heard in his voice seep into his tunes.
B000002J1S|5.0|No other album has ever influenced my musical tastes as much as \\"The Lamb\\". The very idea of presenting such elaborate and surreal ideas in musical form is worth the praise alone. Genesis creates a strange fantasy scenario and proceeds to illustrate it with their brand of progressive music, which by this time has become highly polished and very intricate. There was no music during that time period that could match such virtuosity. It's hard to believe that this was a band on the verge of collapse but thankfully they got this one out before the change. Several of the Genesis albums after Peter Gabriel's departure did actually retain some of the original spirit but eventually they disintegrated into a Phil Collins pop machine. Sorry for that jab but when you have The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway in your system, it's hard to accept cheesy forms of anything in our culture.I just wish there was someone making life-effecting music like this today.
B00005JKZQ|3.0|In fact, just by watching the trailers you know what it's going to be about.  It's about the pairing of two cops for a TV show.  These cops are polar opposites of each other in terms of personality and skill.  Each, however, complements the other towards the end, and they solve a big case.<br />Showtime was meant to be a action-comedy.  There was a good mix of both.  As usual, you see Eddie Murphy providing comic relief with what he says and does.  His role as a patrolman and actor-wannabe lets him shine.  He's constantly talking and screwing up.  Robert de Niro plays the uptight stuck-up cop who hates change and people.<br />After a stressful day at work, this movie was great for relaxing and having a few laughs.<br />LEAP rating (each out of 5):<BR>L (Language) - 3 (no unnecessary cursing)<BR>E (Erotica) - 0 (no romance involved either)<BR>A (Action) - 3 (very tame chase scenes, a lot of talking)<BR>P (Plot) - 1 (non-existent, ok ok, it's very simple)
B00004THAY|5.0|This is the best material either of these guys has done in years.  If you like either of them, you'll love this album.  If you like Clapton-esque blues with B.B. King riffs and overtures, you won't be able to stop listening.  If you love King's music and his legacy and want to hear it updated and enlivened a bit by Clapton, you've found your album.  Definitely a must-have for the serious blues fan.
B00005JKYS|4.0|Sometimes I scratch my head and wonder what the people in hollywood are thinking when they release film after film after film about war, death and destruction in such a short period of time (Black Hawk Down, Harrison's Flowers, Hart's War, Behind Enemy Lines).  No matter how good or well-intentioned a film is made, it's hard to keep from thinking that it's just another war flick. It's hard to not think of it as cliche and redundant.<br />Some say this film is similar to Blackhawk Down.  In a way, it is.  In other ways, it's unique.  We Were Soldiers involves the family aspect of going to war.  It recognizes the sacrifices that not only the soldiers themselves make when they go fight a war, but also the pain and suffering their wives and children undergo with the absense and loss of them.  This film pays tribute to the soldiers (who were strongly outnumbered and out-experienced) who died fighting a 3 day war in Vietnam .<br />We Were Soldiers describes the war from two points of view.  From the American's and the Vietnamese.  We see the story give the audience a glimpse of what a good strategy can do even when the odds are against you.  We see a story of courage and leadership.<br />Think of this film as an exciting documentary to an event in American history.<br />LEAP rating (each out of 5):<BR>L (Language) - 3 (some of the language seemed polished and too perfect, Chris Klein was pretty bad)<BR>E (Erotica) - 0 (it's a war flick, what did you expect?)<BR>A (Action) - 5 (people get shot, stabbed, burned and blown up)<BR>P (Plot) - 2 (there's no surprise in what this film is about)
B00005JKYS|5.0|This is much more than just Mel Gibson heroics; this is  vividly portrayed history--a picture of  the heroism of many American soldiers and North Viets too. At conclusion of movie entire theatre is so moved that no one stands to leave untill the names of the 7th Cav. 1st Battallion dead are finished scrolling across screen. Very tense, very moving movie. Don't miss it!
0920668372|5.0|This book has been on my son's bookshelf since he was just about 3 years old and I do hope that he holds on to it and that he remembers the many times we read it together.  I remember him telling me that he thought it was a safe feeling to think that your mother would always love you that way, no matter how old you got or no matter how old she got.  It's a beautiful book that I like to give as a baby shower gift.  I know that I will always remember the times we shared that book together at bedtime and how it was then, and continues to be a wonderful celebration of a mother's love for her children.
B000002UB6|2.0|I still have trouble listening to this album after all these years.  Spector ruined what was really an OK effort, not great.  I sense the HAND of Alan Klein at work, yet again.  This may have been a final cash in, but the listener is left wondering 'what the hell happend here?'  The only two songs that ever capture me are the George Harrison penned tunes.  TO me, this album is personified by I,Me,Mine.
B000001FS3|4.0|If Jesus was as pretentious as His would-be modern-day incarnation (better known as \\"Bono\\"), there's no way Christianity would have caught on.<br />><br />Having said that, U2 have in their hitory been capable of absolutely astounding recordings.  This is one of the best (I prefer \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" over it, but only just), and unfortunately after this recording they became more focused on seeking new musical directions for each subsequent album (see:  Madonna) rather than producing any work near the quality of this easily-deserved Grammy-winning feast for the ears (although \\"Achtung Baby\\" may be close).<br />><br />Of course the first three tracks have been played to death (the opener, \\"Where The Steets Have No Name\\" still packs a significant enough wallop to be included in U2's Super Bowl halftime set, which is included in full with the New England Patriots 2001 Season Highlights DVD, in case anyone is curious), so much so that \\"With or Without You\\" initially turned me off after hearing it so much on MTV at the time of its release; I don't rate it as one of the best tracks on this CD as a result.<br />><br />For me the highlights are the tracks you DON'T hear on the radio...\\"Bullet The Blue Sky\\", an obvious Led Zeppelin homage, got them some AOR cred at the time of this CD's initial release (and it's a pretty good make-out song, as well), but the two best songs are \\"God's Country\\" (which made it to the closing credits of \\"Three Kings\\", a movie that really needs a soundtrack CD very badly) and \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\", a song that truly defines Bono as an extremely powerful and moving vocalist as well as anything U@ have done before or since.<br />><br />This album is the one that ensured U2's continuing (mainstream) success and enabled them to release a string of lesser work that continues to this day.  If you've been living in a cave in Afghanistan for the last 20 years and are not at all familiar with U2' work, my advice would be to start with this CD and work your way backward through their catalogue; nothing they released after 1990 even comes close to this one.ward through their catalogue; nothing they released after 1990 even comes close to this one.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is one of those movies where you either love it or loathe it; there is no in-between.  It just so happens, I loved it.  Not only is it visually stunning, but the music is utterly amazing.  Ranging from Queen, the Police, and Nirvana, to Paul McCartney, David Bowie, Patti LaBelle, and the Beatles, Moulin Rouge captures some of the best music ever written.  Heck, this film even steals from Rodgers and Hammerstein's The Sound of Music.  Even if you didn't like the movie, you have to admit that the soundtrack is awesome.  At any rate, Baz Lurhmann proved, yet again, he is one of the most innovative directors today.  Nicole Kidman plays the beautiful courtesan Satine, AKA \\"The Spakling Diamond\\" who falls in love with the penniless poet Christian, portrayed by Ewan McGregor.  The audience learns early on that Satine is dying, but this is kept hidden from both Satine and Christian, as they struggle to keep their passionate love affair a secret.  I reccommend this film to anyone who enjoys musicals, love stories, or both!!  A great supporting cast includes John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent, and Richard Roxburgh.  All performances are \\"Spectacular Spectacular\\".  And who would've thought that the same kid from Trainspotting could belt out \\"I Will Always Love You\\" just as well as Whitney Houston?!?!  I enjoyed this film, and while it's definitely not for everyone, Moulin Rouge is a film I would highly reccommend to those who enjoy tragic romances or films with great music.
B00005QIPH|1.0|I won a copy of this disc in a contest, and I'm sure glad I didn't spend money on it!  This is about as dull and uninspired as music gets;  it's just by-the-numbers grunge pop lacking in originality and substance.  Lyrics, songwriting, and musicianship are all thoroughly forgettable, as I'm sure this band will be forgotten as soon as their flavour-of-the-month appeal wears off.  Avoid at all costs.
B00003CXS4|5.0|Benicio Del Toro as Franky Four Fingers.  <BR>Brad Pitt with a mumbling gypsy accent.<BR>Dennis Farina and Vinnie Jones as part of the supporting cast.<BR>An 86 karat diamond.<BR>A squeaking dog.<BR>.....all in a film caled SNATCH, by a director named Guy Ritchie.  Need I say more??
B00003CXDV|4.0|Come on...it's hokey, it's just a bit cheesy, it stars Tim Allen.  Why do I like this movie so much?<br />Because it believes in itself and its ability to entertain.  Because the cast and crew obviously had a blast making this thing.  And because, yes, I'm a closet Trek fan, and this is a Trek movie in disguise.<br />The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, but it does play within the confines of its story:  it's a movie about the GalaxyQuest actors, not GalaxyQuest: The Motion Picture.  There are no hokey, cheesy performances except in the play within the play--the GalaxyQuest TV series.  When Taggart shouts out his signature line, \\"Never give up!  Never surrender!\\" you can almost hear The Voice of Kirk.<br />Life imitates \\"art\\" as the crew attempt to save the Thermians for real:  Jason's shirt comes off as soon as he's left alone on the planet (ever notice how often the Trek Captains end up fighting evil all by themselves?), Gwen ends up repeating the computer and somehow tears open her uniform just enough to show her cleavage for the rest of the adventure, Alexander saves the Thermians from suffocation only to see credit go to Jason...nearly every event has a counterpart in their TV series.  It's as though they played out the TV scripts so many times that the patterns infected the real world.<br />I don't see any indication of a sequel to this one in the offing: with the parallel between real and fictional resolved at story's end, there's no real room for one.<br />But it sure would be sweet to see the GalaxyQuest crew again.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Well, Russell Crowe's echo will definitely be heard for a long time to come.  This year marks his third consecutive Oscar nod.  He's not only a terrific actor, but an all around cool guy.  Regardless of what the tabloids say about him, he seems really funny and personable.  Anyway, Gladiator is an amazing movie.  In the tradition of Spartacus, a Roman general turned slave seeks vengeance on his family's brutal murder.  Russell Crowe won a well deserved Oscar, but Joaquin Phoenix is the star of this movie.  His portrayal as the coniving, evil, malicious, jealous, and downright nasty Commodus (he's the villian; could ya guess?!) is absolutely stunning.  His innocent, deceitful, yet powerful, violent, yet tender and naive turn as the envious Commodus is extremely noteworthy.  If there's anyone who hasn't seen this movie, you don't know what you're missing.  With a haunting score by Hans Zimmer and beautiful cinematography, Gladiator is a truly remarkable film.  Don't miss it....especially with this extra-packed DVD.  For another compelling performance by Russell Crowe, check out Romper Stomper.  In that Australian tale about a Nazi skinhead (and no, it's not even close to American History X's plot), Crowe proves that he most definitely is one of our finest actors to date.  I highly reccommend both.
0060392886|5.0|If you can stomach the real story of a heavy metal band in the '80s - this book is for you.  Nothing is held back - the band tells it like it is (was).  The writing, which is written in first person by each member of the band, gives the reader a true sense of the personality behind the big hair and make-up.  LOVED IT - but it is not for everyone!!
B000003NA3|5.0|When John Coltrane began playing this music, he was alarmed to hear it called &quot;anti-jazz&quot; by reveiwers.  It seems that the truly amazing blend of Indian scales and free-jazz improvisation didn't meld with some people's ideas of what jazz should be.<BR>     How lucky we are today. This live set is now seen by many as a cornerstone of American music. Not only is Coltrane's own playing virtuosic, his band is one of the best ever assembled.  The begginings of his famous quartet are seen here, as well as some unexpected surprises (Can you say contrabassoon?).<BR>     Because of the truly unique nature of these disks, one should not think of them as something to put on for mood.  Trane's music sometimes requires intense listening, and even then it may even sound like plain noise upon first listening.  However, give Coltrane some time, and your musical landscape will be forever changed.
B000002B2X|5.0|Alice In Chains is one of my favorite bands.  Well this album is awesome.  The only problem with it is it is too short!  It is so beautiful though, and gives you a totally different side of Alice In Chains, especially after Facelift.  All four songs are great and you should buy it for when you want to relax.
B00003CXDZ|5.0|Who would have every thought of a musical with Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor in a brothel?  Well, whoever thought of it did a good job because this strange set musical takes off and takes you with it into a world of romance and intrigue!  The cast is amazing ant the story line is enticing.  It seems strange at first and I must admit it takes some getting used to since it is so contrary to any other movie I have seen, but once the adjustment is made you get lost in the song and dance of it all!  They deserve all awards they are nominated for!
B000003TA4|5.0|There are two ways you can look at Nevermind.  You can say, \\"Oh My God this is a great album\\" or you can say \\"This album is too commercial\\".  I have to say I'm somewhere in between.  Yes it is the most \\"commercial sounding\\" Nirvana album, but you have to realize that when it came out it was not commercial at all.  It was groundbreaking and new.  So many bands have ripped off Nirvana that you forget how innovative and weird they were.  This is the most solid album I have ever listened to, every song is perfect in its own way.  It will make a fan out of you.  Trust me on this one.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Bluegrass music has perhaps some of the most solid roots in American music history. This album not only has great bluegrass music, but some old classics the way only the elderly can remember them!<br />If you want something different, this is a great album to purchase. You've not heard many like it before. It has raw soul spirituals, downhome gritty blues, bluegrass, old folk songs and the popular Soggy Bottom Boys tunes that you may have seen in the movie. My wife listens to mostly hard rock and heavy metal, but she too enjoys the variety of this music as it transcends into every American's soul.<br />This is a great purchase and I agree with most reviewer's comments. This is why I didn't feel the need to necessarily rehash them in the same way.
B0000028M7|5.0|This album is awesome.  Layne Staley is one of the best rock singers of the 90's for sure.  And Jerry Cantrel is sooo good.  His guitar playing is distinctive and awesome.  This album is the band's best in my opinion.  It is just so great, and it manages to be hard but melodic at the same time.  I am 14, so when this album came out I was just a little kid.  More people my age need to discover Alice In Chains and other bands from the early 90's.  I mean, the music that comes out right now is just imitations of previous bands and it seems like nobody plays music they want to play.  This album is awesome, buy it.
B00004Z459|5.0|First off Linkin Park sounds nothing like Limp Bizkit.They sound a lot like Papa Roach minus the cursing. Linkin has a great new sound that should be praised and after reading some of the reviews I wnet back and listent to the whole park album and thought \\"are they a bunch of fake hip-hoppers?\\" I answered myyself no. Everyone should listen to this SUPER-PHAT cd! ...
B0000035E7|5.0|This is a great album.  So many people I know will say, &quot;I like Nevermind, but not any other Nirvana albums.&quot;  I don't get that. This album along with In Utero and Incesticide and Unplugged are just as good as, if not better, than Nevermind.  I guess I could describe this album as energy.  That's really the best word for it.  The whole thing is raw, loud, and full of emotion.  It's sort of like one big scream or something.  It never gets boring, trust me, I've had it a long time and still listen to it a lot.  Kurt's voice and guitar are awesome on this.  On Bleach it seems like you can hear a lot more of Kris's bass, which is awesome because in my opinion he is one of the best bassists ever.  And the drums on this are unbelievable too.  All of the tracks are great.  Need I say more?
6305252572|4.0|In the cop buddies formula popular in the 80's this film was the first and for me the best.A white laconic drinker cop(Nolte) must team with a black mouthfast thief(Murphy) which is in jail to seek a band of cop killers which have escaped killing 2 partners of Jack Cates and held 3 women hostage until the boyfriend and former member of the band tell their leader where is the money that he and Reggie Hammond took in a bank robbery that's cost $500,000 in cash.<br />Authorities gave 48 hrs to find the money and the men so they must take every evidence they have to find the money and the fugitive inmates.<br />A little issue I found is that the packet says that it have English captions when in reality there isn't any.<br />I hope Paramount Studio can fix this soon. ... I see more like this one and above with a least English subtitles.
B0000027RL|5.0|Despite what a lot of people will say, I still think this is Pearl Jam's very best album.  I am not going to compare Pearl Jam to Nirvana, Alice In Chains, Soundgarden, or any other grunge bands.  Because all of them are different.  In my opinion grunge is not a style of music, its just kind of an attitude.  Anyway about the album.  Today most bands are just pure trash (ex. Linkin Park) or cheap imitations (I mean, come on, that guy in Creed is sooo trying to sound like Eddie Vedder).  Anyway people my age (14) need to discover Pearl Jam.  This album is just so great.  Okay about the songs.<BR>Once- I didn't actually hear this song until a few weeks ago, even though I've owned this album for a while. There is a really long, quiet beginning to this song and I got bored with it and changed the song.  It is worth waiting for though.  It's a nice, angry song.  <BR>Even Flow- This song has a nice melody to it, and Eddie Vedder's voice sounds awesome.<BR>Alive- I don't think I can ever get tired of this song.  It is just plain awesome.<BR>Why Go- This song isn't that great, but it's still good, and has like the best guitar solo ever in it.<BR>Black- I love this song.  It is just so sad, and so pretty.<BR>Jeremy- This is the song that made me love Pearl Jam music.  I still think it is the best song they have ever done.  The beginning and closing of it are so depressing, and the whole song is just full of emotion.  If all of the other songs were awful, I would still love this album for this song.<BR>Oceans- This song is sooo peaceful.  I love it.<BR>Porch- This is a great song too.  They are all just so good.<BR>Garden- This a beautiful song with beautiful lyrics and great guitars.<BR>Deep- This is a great song too.<BR>Release- Another more soothing song.  <BR>Okay you need to buy this album.  It will make you realize how horrible most music today is!  I also recommend all other Pearl Jam albums.
B00005IC2H|5.0|every time i listen to this CD, it's impossible for me not to feel...it's impossible not to see the rolling landscapes of Iceland...it's impossible for me not to fall in love with this recording a little bit more.  a buddy of mine turned me on to this magical group of young Icelandics, and i have yet to go a day without hearing at least one track, if not all of them.  true, the music is unlike anything you've ever heard...the closest comparison is indeed Radiohead, but it is so much more than one simple comparison.  i implore you to get this CD....it will take you to places you never knew existed...you will feel things you never thought existed deep within your being.  yeah, i know, i sound ridiculous, but it's the only way i know how to describe this beautiful, otherworldly orchestration.  what a wonderful discovery!!
B000003TAR|5.0|First let me say this is the best album ever from the best band ever.  I can describe it as so many things, beautiful, perfect, raw, deep, depressing, energizing... the list goes on and on.  It makes you wonder how three guys can make this great of music.  This is a diverse album and is hard to describe.  Serve the Servants and Scentless Apprentice aren't all that great but all the rest of the songs make up for that.  Heart Shaped Box is a wrenching, powerful song.  Rape me is one of my favorites.  It uses the Smells Like Teen Spirit tune but it twists it around in a way that is way better.  Frances Farmer is great too, I think it is one of Kurt Cobain's best jobs vocally.  Dumb is beautiful in an eery sort of way, with a cello in addition to the usually guitar, bass and drums.  Very Ape is hard to describe, but it is great.  Milk It is an awesome song.  Pennyroyal Tea has a depressing tune and it is really great.  Tourette's and Radio Friendly Unit Shifter are the two hardest songs on the album and two of the best, and it finishes with All Apologies, which is my all time favorite Nirvana song.  This album will change the way you view rock, and music in general for that matter.
0060987464|5.0|I'll start this review off by saying that I'm not a huge Marilyn Manson fan or anything. I like him as a person, and most of his music, but nothing major. What does this have to do with a book review, you're thinking? Well, I didn't think I'd like this book very much, but I was proven wrong. The book starts out dealing with his childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. This is how it all started. It's a disturbing, dark, and true tale. Marilyn Manson's addicting read should be followed by a novel, or more books, considering he's a very good author. Neil Strauss just contributed things, he didn't write. A bonus for the book is that it had about 5 pages of color photos, and alot of black and white ones throughout the book. Needless to say, this is a very original book.
B000003TAB|5.0|Okay, this album is not very popular, and I don't know why.  It is an awesome mix of songs, from hard and abrasive to melodic and pop like.  It is so great, and all of the songs could not be better.  If you liked Bleach and In Utero, I would highly recommend this album.  If you are the kind of Nirvana fan who only likes Nevermind, don't buy this.  Trust me though, it is awesome.  I don't get why it is Nirvana's least popular.  Buy it.
B000002BBY|5.0|`Hello' starts the album of loudly and superbly and is proper `Rock `n' Roll. Really incredible music. ***** <BR>`Roll With It' was the first (WTS)MG? Single and deservedly so, in my opinion, being a very upbeat song. *****<BR>Many people think that `Wonderwall' should have been the first single but personally I do not like it as much as    `Roll With It' (I am sure a lot of people will disagree with me over this...**** (people will not agree with this, I know)<BR>`Don't Look Back In Anger' was the best single off this album, not because it is the best song, but because its B-Sides were incredible.(ie. `Underneath The Sky', `Step Out' and `[come] On Feel The Noize'). Of course it is one of the best songs on the album. *****<BR>`Hey Now!' is, for some reason always forgotten. While it is not quite of the standard of the other tracks, it is catchy and even could have been a pretty successful single itself. Interestingly, this song is never played live. ***<BR>(I am not going to review `The Swamp Song' excerpts because they are simply too short to say anything about. {By the way, they are tracks 6 and 11})<BR>`Some Might Say' is arguably the best song on the album. Everything, the guitars, the vocals and lyrics are really good. This is an absolute favourite of mine. *****<BR>`Cast No Shadow' is the quietest song on the album but is a marvellous one. The best version of this can be watched/seen on the `There And Then' VHS release. ****<BR>`She's Electric' is one of the most `poppy' songs Oasis have ever written while being very, very good. (From the beginning, the guitars sound like they are being played by Blur, for God sake!) ****<BR>`Morning Glory' is a great song describing the after-effects of cocaine usage (`When you're chained to the mirror and the razor blade') and is, along with `Some Might Say' one of the best songs on the album. *****<BR>Finally, `Champagne Supernova' is an EPIC and is a great way to finish the album. It's a good idea not to listen to it toomuch or it loses the aurora which surrounds it and it can become slightly boring. It is 7:27 minutes long after all. *****<br />An absolute must-buy.
B000002A3T|4.0|Following the mixed bag of good and bad that was A Momentary Lapse Of Reason Pink Floyd return to form with this excellent concept album which focuses on communication gone wrong.<br />The opening Cluster One instrumental is beautiful and it's followed neatly by a track that is the complete opposite. A harsh but enjoyable heavy rock number in What Do You Want From Me?. It's time for Roger Waters to get a long overdue grilling from the band in the absolutely wonderful Poles Apart which features a great musique concrete segment between verses 2 and 3. Next up is the Grammy award winning Marooned. It's a good instrumental but not brilliant and IMHO the opening track of the album is better.<br />Next we have the only hiccup on the album. A truly dull and yawn inducing track called a Great Day For Freedom which is about the Berlin Wall being pulled down (nice going guys...you're only 5 years out of date!). The last verse (despite what Gilmour might claim) appears to be an unwaranted attack on Roger's solo 1990 Wall concert.<br />Back on to the good stuff. In a total suprise Rick Wright handles lead vocals for the first time in 21 years with the excellent Jazz track Wearing The Inside Out. This deals with Rick's problems in the late 70's, his departure from the band and his eventual return.<br />Back in Gilmourland we have a blatant U2 rip off in the form of Take it Back which is obviously about our failure to communicate with Mother Nature. Not bad by any means but it's still a rip off. This merges flawlessly into my favourite track on the album Coming Back To Life. An absolutely beautiful number with decent lyrics and a guitar/keyboard combo which manages to creep into my soul every time I hear it.<br />Stephen Hawking guest stars on the next track Keep Talking. Whilst this is a decent enough song many have quite rightly complained it sounds way too simmilar to Sorrow and they're correct. However Rick's keyboard solo is decent. Lost For Words is the second song on the album to take a dig at Roger it's a mellow number but a memorable one. <br />Finally We have the AWESOME High Hopes. A rich peice of music which you'll have to listen to several times to really appreciate as there is just so much going on. Sounds more like an orchestral peice than a rock track but Gilmour does some nice slide work at the end. After a couple of moments silence the bands manager Steve O'Rourke finally gets his wish of appearing on a Floyd album courtesy of an answerphone recording where Dave's stepson Charlie hangs up on Steve. Emphasising the albums concept.<br />IMHO the BEST Pink Floyd album since 1975's Wish You Were Here. The band recorded most of the music by having jamming sessions (something which they hadn't done since the early 70's) And the teamwork really shines through. An essential album for EVERYONE!.
B00005JKED|5.0|This was a very strong, intense film with excellent performances from both actors.  We all know Denzel can handle dramatic roles like this and now Ethan has proven he can do the same right next to one of the greats but what can you say about Mr. Washington that hasn't already been said before? He comes through as per his usual high-level style here, and gives the audience a completely different side to his talent<BR>This movie takes place over one day. It's a rookie cop's narcotics training alongside a seasoned police veteran. The rookie doesn't know much about \\"street justice\\", so the older cop teaches him about the way things work in the \\"real world\\". How even cops like themselves have to \\"bend the rules\\" and \\"break the law\\" every now and then, in order to catch the really bad guys
B00005Q3TZ|2.0|...This movie is no exception. At 3 hours, it's just more torture for your money. With the additional features of this 'director's cut' I can't see what they were thinking ($$$) since the only reprieve from the rest of that...movie was the 45 minute action sequence. You can polish and cover up... all you want...
6305132984|3.0|This is a case of the whole being less than the sum of the parts.  This movie has great music and is visually stunning, but this cannot detract from the flaws in this movie.<br />From a story standpoint, this is Romeo and Juliet of course, but this is not the classic that the Shakespearean original was.  The prinicipal characters, Tony and Maria, are actually in less than half the movie, and the remaining characters are pretty weak.  <br />As nice as the movie looks, there is a certain silliness in the dance numbers considering the tragic storyline.  This gives the movie an artificial quality.<br />I enjoy a good musical and can see why something like &quot;Sound of Music&quot; can win best picture. On the other hand, for this movie to win (and for Rita Moreno to win with her limited role as Anita) shows that this must have come out in a weak year for movies.
B000000W9Z|5.0|Let me put it this way: I've never been much of a follower (though I respect him a good deal) of Bowie's work. But when I first listened to this album I was hooked on it. At the time I was very much into Nine Inch Nails and music such as the soundtrack to David Lynch's &quot;Lost Highway,&quot; where &quot;I'm Deranged&quot; (one of this album's best songs) is featured. If you remotely like any of these, or if you enjoyed the movie &quot;Seven&quot; (I'm trying to provide you with some leads here) you will definitely love this album: it's very dark and full of mystery, so don't expect  any light-hearted material here, except &quot;maybe&quot; for the song &quot;Strangers when we meet.&quot; Brillant. A true masterpiece! True, as some another reviewer comments: this has been probably one of those unnoticed, &quot;underrated and underappreciated works of art.&quot;
6305841861|5.0|First off, forgiver my typing. I am writing this review on an airport terminal! now on with the reveiw.Oh, my [gosh]!!! this movie is the pinacle of the\\"splatsttick\\" genre(and Ironically the start of it!)!! Coimedy Horror at it's best! In this movie, the king of the one liners Bruce campbell, reprises his role as reluctant zombbie-crusher Ash. ALSO, the girl who played Blair one the soap \\"one Life to Live\\" is in it. I do not know why that is pertinent, but every trime I watch this movie, my mom says, \\"WOW!!! that's Blair!!!\\" Shut up, mom! And, one more of those cameo's that don't matter to anyone but me, Ted Raimi, who no one but me might remember as LIEUTENANT J.G. TIM O'NEILL from the show \\"Seaquest\\", plays Henrietta, only because his brother, Sam raimi(Duh), directed it. Whoopie. The stars really turned out for this one!! Anywho, the movie follows the same rhetoric as the first. Evil released by teens, and horribley gory violence and comedy ensues. Like I said in my review of \\"Evil dead 1\\" You have seen this movie before. But, one thing: contrary to what you might have heared,<BR>THIS IS NOT NOT NOT NOT NMOT A REMAKE!!!! to all the people who say other wise. Remember at the end of the first one when ash is hit by the evil right before the credits rolled? Now, rremember in the middle of this one when that happens and you see him get propelled throgh the trees? WOW!!!!! SEQUEL!! Listen to the commentary by SAm Raimin at the begining. The reason theyshot another o0pening was because they could not get the footage of the first one from the company, So they basically did a cliff notes of the first one. so in conclusion, what have we learned here today? 1. Evil Dead 2 is a sequel, NOT a remake. 2 it kicked [bootie]...
0786880708|4.0|In today's world the everday person experiences incredible amounts of stress.  Since 9/11 we have had to deal with watching innocent people jump out of burning buildings, airplanes explode midair, and now the recurrent fears of bio/chemical attacks. These are stress factors that we can only add to the previous ones we already had to deal with such as family, work, home, and school.  Basically, we are a VERY stressed nation.<br />Fortunately, we do have several anti-stress options at hand and this book features several including seated meditation, walking meditation, and mindful yoga.  Even if none of these methods work for you personally, this book features some very simple, very effective advice: everday take some time to just lie silently on the floor and breathe.  It's that simple.  <br />However, if meditation is of interest to you, you have come to the right book.  Jon Kabat-Zinn has taken the study of meditation seriously with the Western practioner in mind.  He has done studies and research on the awesome powers of meditation to help patients with both psychological and physical ailments.  The results are astounding and encouraging.  Best yet, Kabat-Zinn's work with patients has helped him establish specific suggestions that will help you gain the tremenous benefits of meditation.  <br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who is in need of stress relief, but may not be ready for an spiritual journey inward.
B00004SAAY|4.0|First, the performances are first rate. Trevor Pinnock and the English Concert rarely disappoint. Although the ensemble uses interpretations and instruments from the 18th century, their recordings are never overly dry or self-consciously antique (which can happen in other authentic-instrument groups' collections).<br />The sound is still great, especially when you consider that some of these tracks were recorded 20 years ago. The fine original recordings -- all digital -- help keep these CDs sounding fresh. The aural balance is superb -- the sound projection is not too close, not too distant.
1577311523|5.0|This book has been such a worthwhile read that I am going to pay a month's worth of late fees at the library!<br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Buddhism, A Course in Miracles, and Eastern Philosophy.<br />There are several points in this book that are invaluable gems of wisdom.  Tolle truly provides the reader with a to-the-point manual on enlightenment.  He reiterates several key truths to provide a strong guiding light on the road to enlightenment.  The first truth he presents is that every living creature is linked together and that we are all ONE. The second truth he provides is that time is a complex illusion and that most of us are unfortunately limited by our belief in it.  A third truth Tolle brings to the reader is that human beings are trapped in a constant cycle of emotional illusions.  He explains this point further by saying we search for external conditions to bring us happiness such as cars, but even the car will eventually rust, breakdown, get flat tires, etc.  Which leads into the next truth that all physical things are temporal and transient.  The very things that bring us happiness one day will die or change the next day.<br />Additionally, a main theme that Tolle imparts to the reader is that there is only one true moment: THE NOW.  Inner peace can only be found in the present moment.  We can't find enlightenment by dwelling in the past or by dreaming of a more pleasant future.  We need to examine the spiritual moment of right now to realize our inherent spiritual nature-enlightenment.  <br />In conclusion, I have found \\"The Power of Now\\" to be a very powerful message that has the ability to transform lives.  I anxiously await any further work by Eckhart Tolle.
B000001GPX|5.0|Kleiber's version of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony is not only the best version currently available -- it is one of the finest classical recordings ever made, period.<br />The performances are flawless and the recording quality is excellent. Don't let the analog recording fool you -- the original recording was great for the 1970s and the digital mixdown makes it even better now. (As the first movement begins, for instance, you can almost feel the bows running across the strings.)<br />The Seventh Symphony on the disc is also a strong performance, although not quite the powerhouse that is Kleiber's Fifth. Still, when coupled with this Fifth, it is well worth the purchase. <br />Bottom line: If you only plan on buying one version of Beethoven's Fifth, this is it.
B000001DYJ|4.0|The first 2 KISS live albums, &quot;Alive!&quot;, and &quot;Alive II&quot; are excellent live albums from the make-up KISS. Even though this album has good live sound it doesn't have that same energy of the KISS with the original members. On top of all that it sounds great.
B00003CXPJ|1.0|I was anxious to get Zoolander as I had enjoyed Ben Stiller and most of what he has done, especially &quot;What About Mary&quot; with Cameron Diaz.  With such a good cast,including Will Ferrel from Saturday Night Live and Jerry Stiller in a major role and Anne Meara in a cameo,  it was disappointing to see this mistake of a take off on the modeling business. I wanted so much to like it but it just was too silly and fell very short of being clever and witty.
B00003CXXP|1.0|Maybe I saw a different film from the people who actually liked &quot;A.I.&quot;, or maybe I should lower my expections.  Either way, this movie was simply awful.  It starts off silly and goes downhill from there.  And just when you think it can't or won't get worse, it does.  The acting was weak, the story was weak, the ending was horrible, and what's with that bear?  I beg those who have not watched this -- DO NOT waste your time.  It's too late for me, but it's not too late for you.  Save yourself!
B00005JA2B|5.0|No Kansas album can compare to &quot;Leftoverture.&quot; It has their most notable epic song, &quot;Carry On My Wayward Son,&quot; and this remaster has a live version of the six-minute-plus classic. Need I say more? That's the only song that matters; the rest is brilliant as well. BUY THIS CD AS SOON AS YOU CAN!
B00005Y7AW|5.0|This is actually the first review I've written for Amazon.com, mainly because the music I've recently felt strongly about is classic stuff from the 60's and 70's and has pretty much already been canonized.  Of course, when I borrowed this 2001 release from a professor of mine and instantly fell in love with it, I thought a bit of praise for a current, not-too-well-known artist was appropriate.  This CD is incredible.  Like a previous reviewer, I don't usually become enamored at first listen, but this was an exception.  This disc is diverse enough to keep one listening repeatedly, from his child-like \\"Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk\\" to his \\"Michelle\\"-like \\"Rebel Prince\\" to his groovy \\"Shadows.\\"  I was fortunate enough to buy this CD after it had been re-released with the bonus track \\"Across the Universe\\" that was previously only on the I Am Sam soundtrack.  His approach to this classic Beatles ditty is wonderful.  This CD is one reason I dislike becoming a fan of current artists, though: his body of work just isn't big enough yet.  Fortunately, this CD has enough substance to keep my ears busy until his next release.
B000002U82|5.0|Although I have only a cover version of \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" I own and love \\"The Wall\\" (CD), I still believe that \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is the best that Pink Floyd has ever recorded without Syd Barrett. Syd inspired the others to write songs discussing madness, among others: money, time, and other issues. The songs are just brilliant: I love the heartbeat intro for the song \\"Speak to Me.\\" \\"Breath\\" has brilliant lyrics,<BR> \\"Breath/Breath in the air/Don't be afraid to care.\\" The song \\"On the Run\\" is an amazing instrumental piece. The best overall song on this album is \\"Time,\\" Rick Wright's nine-moinute epic. Not only are the lyrics unlike those of other songs, but I LOVE the Big Ben/clocks intro. Rick is a brilliant keyboardist for a brilliant band (if they would ever reunite!). \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\" reminds me of \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" when Dorothy is inside the tornado. \\"Money\\" is the best (and only) up-tempo hard-rocker on this entire album. The cash register, the music, the obscure beat, the brilliantly offbeat lyrics, need I say more? <BR>\\"Us and Them\\" is the second-best ballad on this album. \\"Any Colour You Like\\" is a brilliant up-tempo instrumental. \\"Brain Damage\\" is the song that spawned the name of this album: \\"I'll see you on the dark side of the Moon.\\" I love that \\"loony\\" tune. <BR>\\"Eclipse\\" is a brilliant song, ending with a heartbeat. ;). One thing that most concerns people is the fact that this album synchronizes with \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" JUST BUY THIS ON CD, LISTEN TO IT WHILE WATCHING \\"THE WIZARD OF OZ,\\" AND HAVE THE BEST DANG TIME OF YOUR LIFE!!! =)
0783114222|5.0|I decided to get this series because I really love Apollo 13 and I'm a big fan of Hanks.  Call me crazy but I cried in every chapter.  Each and every one of the mission (or chapter) has its own story, its own drama in itself.  The truth that we would never known.  Who might have thought about marriage life of these astronuats, I was shocked to realize that 7 out of 9 astronuats in this Apollo program got divorced.  Man, it hurts me in a way, though, that these brave men and sacrificing ladies gotta suffer house broken problems because of the stress this astronaut job put on them.  Anyway, every single episode has its own glory.  It reminds me how long i've forgotten to dream the impossible.
B000002U8G|5.0|The second best Pink Floyd album (#3 being &quot;The Wall,&quot; and #1, &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;) of all time is &quot;Meddle.&quot; It's the best of cult psychodelic rock from the sixties and seventies (in THIS case the seventies). &quot;One of These Days&quot; is a spooky and horrifying rocker with it's chainsaw intro and the nightmarish lyrics. &quot;Echoes&quot; is the best song on the album; it's 23 minutes long (traumatizing for those of you sick of &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&quot;). The lyrics are beautiful and spooky, as well as the hauntingly melodic music. I love all of the other songs, too. This is a must for any serious music collection. I read from another review that you can play &quot;Echoes&quot; while watching <BR>&quot;Fantasia,&quot; they synchronize better than &quot;Dark Side&quot;/&quot;Wizard of OZ.&quot; The review said to put &quot;Fantasia&quot; on mute, hit the repeat button on the CD, and enjoy. The film ends after the third round of &quot;Echoes.&quot; I don't know if it works, because I don't have the song. If you love this, you'll love &quot;Dark Side,&quot; &quot;The Wall,&quot; and &quot;Echoes&quot; (Best Of). :)
B00005N915|5.0|Angel Heart takes us into the America of 1950s, when colored people still had seperate seats on buses. The story starts with a classic Film Noir opening. The unkempt, unshaven and heavily smoking private eye (Mickey Rourke) is called by a lawyer working on the behalf of a mysterious man named &quot;Louis Cypher&quot; (Robert DeNiro). Mr. Cypher is trying to track down a lost contract, and hires private detective Harold Angel.<BR>From then on, the story goes off track as detective Angel is thrown into a web of burtal murders and sinister connections. <BR>There's a very remarkable thing about &quot;Angel Heart&quot;. Everybody in the cast and crew deliver a brillant job. There is not a single glitch in the texture. The settings are superb, vividly reflecting the era. Every character, even the functionless pedestrians, are thought on. Both Mickey Rourke and De Niro display outstanding acting, delivering very cleverly written lines in equally brillant acting (I will never look at an egg the same way again). Lisa Bonet, the third major character, is just as brillant although her act is small. Those among you who know her from Cosby Show are in for a big surprise, for Ms. Bonet is as un-Cosbyish as she can get. <BR>Powerful occult images are beautifuly brought home. This is also a rare quality in horror where we usually see actors quoting directly from Crowley or La Vey.  <BR>In many ways, this is a one-man film, and Mr. Rourke deals very nicely with the almost impossible role he is portraying. As we watch his life go to pieces, we do not just derive this fact from the happenings around him. We see Harold Angel go to pieces, we witness his despairs and angers, and his thrashings as he slowly sinks to the bottom of himself.  <BR>To conclude, Angel Heart is a very remarkable film. Two classical plots, one being the mysterious detective assignment, the other being the hand-in-hand walk of the protagonist and antagonist, are masterfully blended into each other. This is a mustfor any horror fan, or anyone who likes to view a good film regardless of the genre.
0345451325|4.0|For those that found the game entertaining, this book offers an interesting prequel story that provides a lot of detailed background information about the Spartan supersoldiers, and the Human/Covenant war.  If you got into the game's story, this book will be a fun read.  It's actually not a bad sci-fi book in itself.  Nothing thought provoking or revolutionary, but written intelligently enough and pretty interesting.  It definitely borrows heavily from classic military sci-fi books such as Ender's Game and The Forever War and can't really compare to books of their caliber.  But for a novel based on a videogame, it exceeded my expectations.  The evolution and training of the Spartans was well thought out.  The starship battles showed an aspect of the war that was not really covered by the game (after all, it is a first person shooter).  And of course, the mysterious character of the Master Chief is fleshed out.  All in all, a very worthy companion story to the HALO game that will enrich the HALO franchise.  I'm actually hoping for a sequel (for both the game, and the book).
0385335482|4.0|Rebecca is a woman after my own heart.  Never pass a SALE sign, always justify the purchase, and when all else fails SHOP SHOP SHOP.  When you pick up this book be prepared for the first 100 pages or so of detailed shopping.  For me it was fun, but my sister found this a bit annoying. Then the money making antics come in, sadly I believe many of us can relate to these hilarious get rich quick desperate measures. And I am happy to report our sweet rebecca learns and grows and comes out winning in many ways, with even a twist of romance thrown in to add to the fun.  I loved this book, and never regretted buying it, it is one I'll probably pull out most summers and enjoy again. Written in true English humor and form (much like Bridget Jones, but for me more enjoyable)this is a light read and a good time.  If you love shopping, shop this one right into your bag!
B00003CX8I|4.0|Being a DVD person, I got this tape as a gift. While I am disapointed that it is Pan and Scan instead of widescreen, I guess that's just the name of the game with the format. I was actually suprised to find that this tape did feature deleted scenes after the feature presentation.<br />As far as the movie goes, it's rather engaging. Not up there with Richard Donner's 'Superman: The Movie' or even the gothic-classical realm of Tim Burton's 'Batman,' but never the less a solid comic adaptation.<br />Taking elements from a variety of eras of 'X-Men' mythology, it is set in the very near future. It opens with a dirty, shocking and bizzare sequence in Nazi Germany. It then flashes forward to Jean Grey addressing Congress concerning the Mutant Registration act. Meanwhile, her mentor Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart, the only choice in my mind.) confronts his former friend, current advesary, Magneto (Ian McKellan of LotR fame). And so on.<br />This film is firmly rooted in character development, rather than fight scenes. The three main characters (in regards to character development and screen time) are Rogue (Anna Paquin), Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), and the aforementioned McKellan.<br />For fans of comic books and/or superheroes, this film is worth picking up. I reccomend the DVD version, however.
0452282152|4.0|Griet was a subtle, quiet and sometimes submissive girl.  You will follow her as she tries to bring honor and money to her family.  While blessed with a strange beauty that men take to she still seems unaware of her power as a women, perhaps because the women she lives with as servant are so demanding and cruel.  This book is a very subtle read.  I read it with a book club and the different points we picked up on were amazing.  If you're looking for a book to discuss, this one will fit the bill.  Never offensive, always touching, sometimes even leaving you begging for soemthing more to happen between this girl and the people in her life, paticularily her master Vermeer, this is a great story.  Much detail is given to the paintings and the manner in which they were painted, so I recommend you read with a book on Vermeer close by. You will learn something about art, human nature, and even a bit on the historical class structure.
B00006312Q|5.0|I bought a copy of the German edition single for this song (I think this is the same one as this) and it is sensational! The song is excellent! Extremely beautiful. She's done it again!<br />The track listing for the German one is:<br />1. Radio Remix<br />2. Album Edit<br />3. PRAYER (LP Version)<br />4. Christian B. Mix<br />So, trust me, it is worth buying! The radio mix and Christian B. Mix are much better than the album edit if you ask me. Prayer is also an excellent song! Celine is back my friends!
6301797906|5.0|Based on the novel by John Steinbeck, \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is the story of an Oklahoma family moving to California during the Great Depression. They move to California to find better work and jobs, only to find that there s little opportunity. The family goes through rough times, but they hold together because they know that they can preserver. <br />\\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" is a very well made movie. The acting is superb from all sides. I didn't notice any melodramatics from anyway, though there might be an occasion or two. The only other problem I had with them movie was some occasional slowdown. But I don't mind, because I'm not one of those people who expect excitement every second. <br />Henry Fonda is great as Tom Joad. A convict out on parole, he goes with his family to California. Some experiences along the way help to change him and make him a better person.  He soon realizes that people are more important and vows to devote his help to those who need it more and to those who aren't as fortunate. He got an Oscar nomination, <BR>But was unsuccessful. The film also got a Best Picture nomination, but lost to \\"Rebecca\\", the first American film of Alfred Hitchcock (Then again, I've rarely agreed with the Academy). Jane Darwell, however, won Best Supporting Actress as Ma Joad, the \\"emotional anchor\\" of the family, and Director John Ford picked up is second award. He would also win one the following year to \\"How Green Was My Valley\\" and in 1952 for \\"The Quiet Man\\".   <br />Another of the film's best virtues is in the cinematography. There is usage of low angle shots in interior scenes (Rare in movies at this time because that's where the equipment was placed) and deep focus in several scenes (Where everything in the scene is focused in). If it looks familiar, that's because it was done by Gregg \\"Citizen Kane\\" Toland.
B000002AT6|5.0|This peace as I said earlier is breathtaking. James Horner has done a magnificent job of composing such beautiful music. Some of my favorite songs, Farewell, Descent into madness and Alfred, Tristan the Colonol, the Legend. I chose the last track because it cimbines all teh different melodies adn themes throughout the cd. It also fills you with emotion because of it's story.
0425129616|5.0|Agatha Chritie has done it again in this classic mystery of suspense. I encourage everyone to take time out and read this splendid and dynamic work of art from the one and only \\"Queen Of Crime.\\" Hercule Poirot is the smartest detective I have ever read about. I originally had to read this book for English, and after reading this book for the first time I had to have my own copy. The murder involves the poisoning of the mistress, Emily Inglethorp. The belgian detective is called on upon his friend Hasting's to investigate the strange matter. ...! This book is so suprising and superb. Give Agatha Christie a chance and take time to read this book and all her others as well.
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is one of the most innovative concepts to come out of Hollywood in some time.  It's a production that combines animation with subtle adult humor.  It parodies fairy tales, martial arts movies &amp; makes fun of traditional constitutions of behavoir.  Somehow, it manages to not offend.  (Anyone who IS offended by this film needs to look up in the encyclopedia the following phrase:  lighten up).<br />The special effects and animation on this movie are absolutely stunning.  They certainly pulled out all the stops.  Visually speaking, this work is nothing short of spectacular.<br />The talent pool displayed is also very impressive.  Mike Myers is great as Shrek, Cameron Diaz is wonderful as the frustrated damsel-in-distress (with a twist!).  Eddie Murphy is a stupendous choice as the comic-relief donkey (although comic-relief in a movie like this is a bit of an outrageous term).<br />Here is a family friendly movie complete with some border-line raunchy humor.  But don't worry - most children will not be apt to pick up on the latter.  Can't think of any type or age of person that would not enjoy this movie. Not too many Hollywood endeavors I can say that about!
B0000028RR|5.0|Out of all of the album's i've bought, this is the only one that is absolutely, positively PERFECT.  The strongest and most powerful lyrics I've ever heard.  Crushing, addictive guitar riffs.  I could go on forever!  YOU MUST BUY THIS ALBUM.  YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPOINTED.  RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE LIVES ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00005U18E|4.0|This film is filled with love, hate, and comidy. the music will get you dancing and the aragents of the males in this film will have you rolling on the floor because you will be laughting so hard!
B00005TT77|5.0|I have NEVER liked covers, because I have never found one half as good as the original...until now. This CD has a selection of The Beatle's songs, many of them not the ones you hear the most, very well interpreted by young voices, with their personal imprint while at the same time not departing from the original ones. This is one of the best tributes I have ever heard. And in the movie each song is there for a purpose, each one fits perfectly in the story line, not randomly like in many other movies where the characters may start singing in the car, just to push another song into the soundtrack. This is also a wonderful way to bring the Beatle's songs to the new generations for them to discover how timeless these songs are and how fresh and &quot;cool&quot; they sound. Great for old timers, too!
B00005YTFG|5.0|The film it self is beyond words! The music is ginous! The dncing is spectacular! The tango seen is a must see. Once you watch this movie you won't be able to set it aside!
B00005RFVL|3.0|A month or so ago I rented \\"Bridget Jones' Diary.\\" Toward the end there was a track of \\"Have You Met Miss Jones\\" that really impressed me. Even though gazing at closing credits is akin to watching paint dry, I, neverthless, waded through them to find the name of that \\"Miss Jones\\" singer......someone I had never heard of before: Robbie Williams. Searching trough Amazon.com I came across a listing of this CD, which seemed to be exactly what I was looking for. <BR>    As I listened to various tracks, I couldn't help but continually think of Frank Sinatra. There's only one problem: Mr. Williams is not in the same league as Frank Sinatra. He doesn't have Frank Sinatra's breath control. And he doesn't have the Chairman's innate sense of timing.<BR>    I think it's great that Robbie Williams is trying to keep Sinatra's kind of music alive. But regrettably I must say your best bet would be to go out and get Frank Sinatra's renditions of these tracks.
B00005JKDR|4.0|Two fabulous CG films were released in the year 2001. The first is the hugely popular (and brilliant) 'Shrek' which took the world by storm. The other was 'Monster's Inc. which many judged the film by its ad and immediately thought it would be another sappy Disney flick... how wrong they were!<br />It can be seen that the Disney evolution of creating more 'Adult based' cartoon's started with 'The Emperor's new groove' in 2000, and is continued with 'Monster's Inc.' which has the ability to entertain the masses. Children love it for the colorful character's whilst a sophisticated adult viewer can also enjoy he film on another level. <br />The film follows the misadventures of Sulley and Mike, two best of friends who work for the Monstropolis energy concern; namely Monster's Inc. The company gets the city's energy from the screams of young children. But when a young child (Boo) stumbles into the monster's world, chaos ensues as Mike and Sulley find it their job to save Boo from the evil Randall as well as point out that children aren't in fact deadly to monsters.<br />The strict use of a linear narrative makes the film a tad predictable in parts... but who cares? It is essentially a children's film but as mentioned above it is also appropriate for an adult audience... why? Because of the brilliance in casting. Billy Crystal as Mike, John Goodman as Sulley and Steve Bushemi as Randall, each bring something special to the film. Crystal and Goodman give off the perfect 'buddy film' milieu. It is very amusing to look at the film as an adventure of Goodman and Crystal rather than two characters that sound like them.<br />Disney has gained a reputation for slinging out some amazing DVD's that are so packed with features it's almost like having three discs worth of stuff. This in course refers to 'The Emperor's new groove', the two disc 'Snow white and the seven dwarfs' and the recent 'Atlantis'. One thing can be sure... that the 'Monster Inc.' will be jammed pack, and I can't wait for it.<br />Pixar has again created a brilliant children's film that has a sort of edge that the others perhaps lacked. The moments in 'Shrek' that may be seen as 'Not suitable for children' (no matter how hilarious they are) aren't in 'Monster's Inc.' but a film is created that is utterly entertaining.<br />So what is better 'Shrek' or 'Monster's Inc.' it cannot be determined. They are by no means the same film, while 'Shrek' subverts the linear fairy tale style, 'Monster's Inc.' makes a fabulous film through alluding to the genre. So in summation both films are fabulous... and each well worth seeing.
B000002UQJ|4.0|Critics slammed this album when it came out, and I never understood why. Admittedly, it was not cutting-edge material such as Nirvana was releasing, but surely there still was and is a place for strong, traditional rock'n'roll. I don't like every song on this album equally, but there isn't a bad song in the lot. How many artists' albums can you say the same about?<br />Some of the songs have a Beatle-esque sound, such as \\"Golden Earth Girl,\\" \\"C'mon People,\\" and \\"Cosmically Conscious.\\" The first one has some clever word play (as in \\"In eggshell seas\\" -- if you don't get it, go back to Mass). \\"C'mon People\\" is in the tradition of those great late-'60s to early-'70s McCartney power piano ballads such as \\"Live and Let Die,\\" \\"Hey Jude,\\" and \\"Let it Be.\\" Although it doesn't quite reach the standard of those great songs, I thought that it would have been a fantastic single, but I never heard it on the radio. George Martin helped with the arrangements and production of this song, which may be what gives it its expansive sound. I also love the snatch of \\"Cosmically Conscious\\" on the album that sounds like a little Beatles psychadelia that fell off of the Magical Mystery Tour bus.<br />\\"Get Out of My Way\\" is another favorite of mine. It's got a brassy, mid-'70s rock sound that shows that Paul can still create good-time rock'n'roll.<br />\\"Winedark Open Sea\\" is beautiful and atmospheric and has that relaxed groove of some of the great ballads of the early 1970s by groups like the Stones and the Band. My only complaint is that he lets the end play out too long, as he also does on \\"Peace in the Neighborhood\\" and \\"I Owe it all to You.\\" This is a gripe of mine with many of Paul's solo songs. I wish he'd try to be more succinct, like the early Beatles, and only let the rare song play out to five or more minutes.<br />\\"Hope of Deliverance\\" was one of the best songs on the album, with an insanely catchy, bouncy rhythm track.<br />The two songs he cowrote with Costello are fine but nothing special. I thought that their collaborations on \\"Flowers in the Dirt\\" were stronger.<br />The title track was another strong song with a great arrangement that is marred only slightly by the \\"La-La La-La-La\\" backing vocals during the chorus.<br />The only song on the album I disliked when it first came out was the preachy \\"Looking for Changes,\\" but with time this song has gotten to sound better and more rocking to me. It's not a favorite of mine, but I no longer skip over it.<br />One of the things that made this album work so well was that Paul had a strong band that clicked on this album. They found good arrangements for a lot of the songs. This album really got short shrift from critics at the time, but with time this album will be recognized as much more deserving than they initially realized.
B00005V9HH|5.0|In 1995 a film was made that not only gained commercial and critical acclaim but also made the career of one of the world's greatest actors, Kevin Spacey. 'The Usual Suspects' is a film like no other, a fabulous story, fantastic characters, a sympathetic protagonist and a twist that cannot be rivaled in modern cinema.<br />The story follows a group of five guys, all of who are convicted crims who are trying to keep their heads above water and avoid prosecution. However when they are all questioned in relation to the same crime this unlikely group of characters forge a plan to hit 'New York's finest taxi service' a group of corrupt cops who get kickbacks for taxing convicted criminals around the city. Through this job the group retreat to L.A where they continue to do criminal work, this escalates to a point where the five are sent down to the docks to stop a drug deal going down. It is here though that the narrative takes a turn that if mentioned will ruin the film.<br />The performances in the film are brilliant, as always Spacey's performance is amazing his pure air on camera makes the audience sit up and watch. In playing somewhat of a comic relief role Benicio Del Toro is fabulous and often hilarious. The work of Gabriel Byrne can never be underrated and in 'The Usual Suspects' he shines. Pete Poslethweight is the veteran on screen and plays Kobiashi, the personal lawyer to Kaiser Sozie and represents the antagonist in the piece who takes the five out of their hedonistic dream world and introduces them to the real world.<br />The direction in the film is masterful as the viewer truly gets a feeling of the nitty, gritty world of crime and is one of the few films where the twist isn't given away prematurely. Bryan Singer has truly created a masterpiece of modern cinema that has not been surpassed on the micro/macro level since. The film is faultless; there is nothing that can really be improved. I can't wait for the DVD special edition
B00000K19E|5.0|If you have never seen this movie, I envy you. I keep wishing to somehow have temporary amnesia, enabling me to experience &quot;The Matrix&quot; for the first time all over again. Yes, this movie is THAT GOOD. Never before has reality been questioned so effectively. The intentional depth of this movie is astounding. It seems to have layers that peel back to reveal more layers. I guarantee you will keep analyzing the movie long after you've seen it. As you watch, you'll realize that somehow everything came together flawlessly, from the screenplay, the directors, the actors, and everyone else involved. If I had to use one word to summarize &quot;The Matrix&quot;, it would be PERFECTION. This movie was the reason people made the transition to DVD. DO NOT RENT... BUY THIS MOVIE NOW.
B00005R87Q|2.0|Well what's to say? I walked in the cinema hoping for some light entertainment, you know a fast paced car film with some great chases and amazing crashes. However no matter how cool it may be to be under the bonnet watching an engine during a car race 'The Fast and the furious' just isn't able to keep enough interest. Part of the problem with this is you can't really care about the characters because you don't know them.<br />We follow Paul Walker on his misadventures through the world of drag racing as he befriends local veteran (Vin Diesel) and begins to give in to the tag line and 'Live his life one quarter mile at a time' hmmm pity his character goes on a journey of about the same length. But No! The shocks don't stop there! Low and behold, it seems Mr. Walker is a FBI agent who's job it is to find out whose stealing from some poor truck drivers. His life isn't easy though as he falls in love with Mia (Jordana Brewster) who is part of the 'crew' and the film takes a journey of almost Shakespearean proportions (I hope the sarcasm hasn't lost anyone) So they film moves from climax, to climax, then Paul lets Vinny go at the end 'ala 'Point Break' and everyone is happy. Sound contrived? Yes, yes it is.<br />So now I've given that thrilling summation I suppose I need to talk about what I liked in the film? There are some cool as hell cars, great race scenes and a whole lot of terminology that got me so 'revved up' (forgive the pun) that I wanted to NOS it all the way home. If you don't want to go on an emotional journey go right now to your local video shop and rent 'Point Break' unless you really like cars, then you rent 'Gone in 60 seconds' if you've seen those get 'Fast and the furious' have a nice night in with a bag of chips and Jordana's large eyebrows (look at the dinner scene) and have fun.<br />The performances are as you'd expect, not great but not 'Plan 9' horrible. As I said above the special effects are great, but it just doesn't work over a 1 hour 40 min timespan. The DVD has alot of features though and sounds great over a Dolby Digital 5.1 system.
B000009EOR|3.0|OK, I have the Japanese version of this release and it is a fair retrospective of Kiss, BUT they include a song from both Unmasked and Music From The Elder, probably to try and promote those albums.  However Escape From the Island (from Elder) is a pretty dull instrumental and Shandi is a pop-lite ballad.  Neither of these tunes fit in with either classic 70's Kiss.  Admittedly Sure Know Something and I Was Made For Loving You make it on here, and they are from the poppy Dynasty, but they are different in that they are GOOD songs with some fantastic hooks.  The Unmasked and Elder material is dreck.  So are most of both of those albums.<br />The 4 new songs on this album (I'm a Legend Tonight, Down On Your Knees, Nowhere To Run, Partners in Crime) don't fit in with the older material, but were recorded for the awesome Creatures Of The Night and might have been on that record if not for the fact that the label pulled them off to try and boost sales of Killers by including them there.  They are most definitely NOT Unmasked rejects.  Just listening to the sound of the songs you can tell this.  And in fact they're pretty good.  Admittedly most of the stuff that made Creatures of The Night (War Machine, Rock and Roll Hell, I Love It Loud, the title track, etc.) are better, but I would take any of these tunes over I Still Love You (for the unitiated a pretty horrific power ballad that is something like 6 minutes long).<br />Kiss has done all sorts of stuff over the years to try and boost album sales, and here what you get is the typical retro package with what the label feels is the best from the back catalogue (while including the underselling albums) and adding a few new cuts to add interest.  For once though the added cuts aren't throwaways or unreleased tracks that are being scraped up, but newly recorded songs that were intended for the next Kiss album, and never made it.<br />If you're a Kiss fan I would suggest hearing the 4 new tracks elsewhere and deciding to buythis or not based on what you think of those (unless you're a completist).  If you're not a Kiss fan this is NOT the place to start.  It is a Kiss comp. with hype but that's purely due to the 4 songs never released in the US (in 1981-2 this would be a bigger deal and harder to track down).  For classic Kiss Double Platinum is probably the best although Greatest Kiss is pretty good too IMHO.  Smashes, Thrashes, and Hits covers a longer time period but with less effectiveness but it's good if you want some 80's Kiss mixed in.
B00003CXXP|4.0|Are we getting ahead of ourselves? Is it that we are imbuing computers with too much 'human-like' qualities? Now we can turn on our T.V from a cell phone call, meals can be cooked with the same call. Even fridges that can make a virtual shopping list reminding us of what we need. It is this continuation of technology that is addressed in 'A.I Artificial Intelligence'<br />It was the vision of film auter Stanley Kubrick in making his film that dealt with the human condition and our need to correct the mistakes humans made themselves. Unfortunately his vision was never realized when his met his untimely death in 1999. What was left was a half-filled shell of a film that needed some fleshing out. Steven Spielberg met the cry and decided to make 'A.I' as an everlasting tribute to a man who made some of the most brilliant and controversial films to touch the silver screen. <br />The narrative reaches its heights through finding the complexities within simplicity. A pseudo child David (Haley Joel Osment) on a mythopoetic quest for a mother's love. In this sense the film can be seen as a futuristic 'Pinocchio' as David is on a quest to become real, and therefore find the love he has been reaching for. Along the way David experiences a myriad of emotions when he is forced to deal with the cruelty of the human race, embodied through the 'Flesh Fair' as well as meeting the unlikely character of Gigolo Joe (Jude Law) who serves as his friend and guide. Along with David's trusty Teddy who serves as a comparable Jiminy Cricket character. The film has the feeling of an epic in every sense of the word. The timespan shifts some 3000 years through the course of the film and David's quest itself can be seen as an epic journey.<br />'A.I' has been critised by many as running too long, and that Kubrick's projected ending was better than the one Spielberg came up with. I however disagree with this summation, yes the Kubrick ending may have been darker, have more of an edge and a film noir feeling. The Spielberg ending however has more of an emotional ending, which I feel works.<br />I will go as far as saying that the ending as it is now is very much like Kubrick would have wanted; It is thought provoking. If we look at Kubrick's previous work we can see how he had an uncanny ability for playing devil's advocate on film. In '2001: a space odyssey' no one speaks for the first 20 mins of the film. In 'The Shining' we are told that Jack may be from the past. Leaving the viewer confused and wondering if the film was about time travel. In 'A clockwork orange' Malcolm McDowell is changed back to his original persona.<br />Overall 'A.I' is a fabulous film and an amazing DVD, the Dolby Digital 5.1 EX sound is amazing and the picture is fabulous. This is the best way to see the movie since the cinemas and the added features will make the audience see the film in a whole new light.
0142000655|5.0|All I can say about this book is that I loved it.  Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down, and I finished it in about two days.  It completely encompassed me.  I have never read Grapes of Wrath but Steinbeck called that his one book... If that is his one book then I don't know what you would call this besides amazing.  I am so glad I got to read this treasure.
B000002UAX|5.0|I particularly love the first disc of the White Album. The second one I still have some reservations about, though I think there are still great songs there too. <BR>I don't mean to be arrogant, but there isn't a bad song on the first disc of the white album. Back in the USSR is like the beach boys and the way it dissipates into Dear Prudence, one of the album's undisputed gems, is remarkable...only the Beatles. Glass Onion is weird, but I like how John comments on songs from Magical Mystery Tour. Strange thing how Wild Honey Pie seems to be a prelude to Bungalow Bill, like a campfire gathering before the sing-along of Bungalow Bill. Great stuff.<BR>The greatest thing about this album, i must say, is the absolutely incredible number of beautiful songs, such as dear prudence, i will, julia, while my guitar gently weeps, blackbird, and the folksy Rocky Raccoon, which is turning into one of my favorite beatles songs. <BR>I can't say that I'm a complete authority on this album because i'm not as familiar with the second disc, but I absolutely love the first one. Also, as a general observation, I think the sound is better on the original LPs. Somehow the sound seems to have been slightly altered for some reason. Some of the background noises are balanced differently and the like. I've heard both formats, LP and CD, and maybe i'm just hearing things, but I think the sound of the Beatles on vinyl is more authentic.
B00005JKT8|5.0|THE BEST FANTASTICAL ROMANTIC COMEDY THAT I HAVE SEEN IN MY 60 YEARS OF MOVIE WATCHING. THAT'S ALL.
0780020685|5.0|Akira Kurosawa soon became my favorite Director after viewing this feature.  Before him my leadings were towards Stanley Kubrick, yet though I still love Kubrick, the styling, wonderful storytelling and emotion that breaths from Kurosawa's directing overtakes me.<br />The Seven Samurai is a story of a small farming village plagued by a group of bandits, who are returning to raid their village after the harvest.  The despearte village sends out three men to find them Samurai who will work for very little, basiclly on their honor.  After finding a respectable elder ronin (samuri without a master), he aids them in finding five others who will work.  The seventh samurai, (one who claims to be a samurai, but is he?) is none other than the great Toshiro Mifune.  A wonderful actor, he portrays every emotion vividly and lushously.  He follows the group around, and becomes their running joke.<br />When arriving at the village, they find it deserted.  The villagers hid from them while they visit the \\"Granddad\\" or village elder.  Mifune rings the village alarm, sending the villagers from their hiding places screaming, \\"Help us Samuri, Help us!\\"  Mifune makes the point that the Farmers fear the Samurai, yet when they are fearful of attack, they scream for their aid.  It is at that point he is accepted as the seventh member of their small group.<br />More than a story about a farmers being protected by the samurai, the story concerns more closely the deteriation of the once proud samurai class.  Most of the ronin in the town craved money and would not defend the innocent village from the attack, and even after the Samurai did not win, the farmers won the battle... you will see what I mean when you purchase this fantastic classic.
B00005JKYS|5.0|When I first saw the trailer for this movie, I thought to myself \\"Oh, no, not another Platoon\\". But when I saw that Mel Gibson had a lead role in it, I changed my thought to, \\"Well it might be alright.\\" About 2 weeks after it was released, my father, a Vietnam veteran, and I went to see the movie.<br />   The story, which was based on a true story, was excellent and the actors played their roles exceptionaly well. Mel Gibson portrayed the Lt. Col. so well, that I almost saluted him, everytime the character came on screen. The actresses who played the wives of the officers were excellent. The way they expressed the emotions really got to my heart. <br />   The movie is very violent, but war is violent. The special effects were especially great. One part in the movie goes as follow:<BR>         It was at night and the sky was pitch black. The US and NVA had a brief cease fire. One Army Sgt. told his officer that he could smell them creeping up on the US soldiers. The officer requested illumination at their location. A few seconds later, lights came decending and the viewer could see the NVA sneaking up on the US soldiers. Whe the cavalry unit saw the NVA, they opened fire, and a brief fire fight ensued.<br />   The movie is full of action and emotion. Near the end of the movie, one part of the movie really got to me. In an airport, one soldier was wheeling another soldier on a wheelchair through the hallway. A mother with her children saw the two men and she pulled her children away.<br />   After this movie, I've placed it in my mind to say thankyou to all the Veterans, especially those who fought in Vietnam. <br />      Thankyou!!!
B000059HCN|5.0|The reviews that I have read for &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; were ultimately the reason why I finally decided to take the plunge and rent the movie.  Like my title says, Wow.  I won't go into detail as others before me have so eloquently done.  But, I was moved to say something.  This movie is wonderful.  I can't say enough about that.  BUT, fair warning: you won't shake this movie. It somehow gets under your skin and grabs you and it won't let go.
B00003CXZ4|2.0|The premise is simply not believable. The idea that tattoos and notes on Polaroid pictures could be an adequate information storage and retrieval mechanism for carrying out even the simplest of daily tasks is hardly worth dispelling, but after noting 10 or 20 instances in the first hour of the movie in which the protagonist generated \\"new\\" memory I stopped watching. Running the plot backward in time adds eccentricity and confusion, but little else to the movie.
B000050FEN|5.0|I wish more movies like Se7en were made, and not because I'm into only creepy, unsettling films. Se7en simply doesn't pull any punches. The excellent characters, script, music, and atmosphere all work together to create the perfect canvas to paint this brutal tale of a serial killer that tortures and kills specific people in accordance with the seven deadly sins. Everything in Se7en has been tweaked to perfection. The movie captures your attention so completely that you can't look away, even at some of the truly morbid scenes. And let's not forget the acting! Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Kevin Spacey are all simply outstanding. Every word they utter seems real, unlike most Hollywood films where the characters are contrived and simply not believeable. The ending is shocking and depressing, more than equaling the rest of the film.<br />As if Se7en wasn't awesome enough, the DVD is simply loaded!! This is one of those rare cases when a movie DESERVES to be stocked full of extras! Obviously, this movie is not for the squeamish or weak of heart, but anyone who can handle this kind of a movie will discover one of the best films of the 90's.
B00005N9CV|5.0|I have heard Ms. Krall before, and I enjoyed her appealing approach to the standards of Fitzgerald and Holiday.  But here she is, singing some more recent masterworks of song from the sixties, and she sings them with authenticity. The orchestrations are genuine and totally appropriate to the period the songs were written. No screaming updated \\"Celine\\" here! Here are the songs as you might have heard them in a smoky nightclub on the Sunset Strip in 1966. She is amazing in these period pieces, and the background orchestration is evocative of the lush orchestrations favored by Nelson Riddle and Antonio Carlos Jobim. A masterwork...  period!
0856610798|4.0|I used this field guide during my recent trip to Kenya and Uganda. Although it is by all means an excellent fieldguide I do have some remarks. A number of the plates contained errors, suggesting the artists didn't see these birds in the field. I realise it is virtually impossible for artists to see all species featured in a book such as this in the field, so that a lot of plates are drawn from skins. It is important however to use skins from the region itself, this may make a lot of difference. We came to the conclusion that for a number of species skins from west Africa were used. Especially the greenbuls had some misleading plates. For a number of species the Kenyan Zimmerman-book is probably better, although those plates lack in other respects.<BR>In addition a number of the maps were incorrect, especially for Uganda.<BR>Still, if you go to the region for birding, make sure to get this book, because it is definitely the best field guide around.
B00005221L|5.0|John Mctiernan's The Predator is a pornographic masterpiece for its graphic depiction of gunplay (a lot of gunplay) and violence. This film is much more than just a Arnold picture in my opinon its his best movie and always will be his best movie its brillent and it may well be the most action pack film ever made its also landmark for its graphic depiction of gunplay and mixing sci-fi with war which has never been done this film is not for the faint at heart.<br />                 Warning: This film is rated Hard R for its extremely graphic action scenes including graphic prolonged gunplay and extrem violence. This film is not for childern.
B00003CX96|5.0|My father is an alumnus of Indiana University and knew the writer of the screenplay, Steve Tesich.  As for the story, The &quot;Little 500&quot; was modeled on the &quot;Indianapolis 500&quot;.  The race began with 33 teams (33 cars at Indy).  Later, a team from the town of Bloomington (home of IU)was added to make 34 teams.  They were affectionately and sometimes degradingly known as the &quot;Cutters&quot;.  Cutters refers to the workers in the limestone cutting industry prevalent in Southern Indiana. The &quot;townies&quot; in the film were sons of these &quot;cutters&quot;.  The key to the success of this film is simplicity.  The plot is well supported by humorous and dramatic dialouge between Dave Stoler and his friends and Dave and his father.  Many cast members are familiar today: Dennis Quaid and Daniel Stern, for instance.  The film is laced with the college town frustration of the locals not being quite good enough to benefit from the a college education.  Stoler finds his outlet in bicycle racing.  You will like this film and you won't ask for a &quot;refund&quot;. (a joke from the movie)
B000062Y98|5.0|All i can say is this album is simply amazing.  There is not one clunker on the whole album, it's all good.  Classic power metal is the term that describes Blind Guardian perfectly.  They are one of the few bands that have stayed true to their own style.  The song writing is incredibly good and &quot;Sadly Sings Destiny&quot; is just way too catchy.  You will be doing nothing all day but thinking about the chorus in your head!  &quot;Punishment Divine&quot; is another one of my favorites, because it never lets up on the double base attack and Hansi really really sings on this track.  &quot;And Then There Was Silence&quot;  I would have to say that this is not only the most standalone track on the CD but the most standalone song in Blind Guardian's career.  14 minutes of pure listening bliss is how I would describe it.  Keep in mind, I love all these tracks but im just picking a select few.  You must get this album, by all means necessary, it is just too good to pass up.  <br />On a side note I am really really angry at one fact.  Blind Guardian will be coming to the US for the first time at ProgPower III in i think November?  Anyway the point is the festival is in Georgia and I will be in school in NY.  I will not be able to see them :'(  They must do a summer tour, especially with Iced Earth because that would be all to awesome.
B00005Y228|5.0|The last Kylie song that I listened to was IT'S NO SECRET. It is very nice to see Ms. Minogue make a 'comeback' in the states. Why Kylie has failed to be a household name here mystifies me. Kylie's music and image is fun and sexual....still she retains a very likeable persona. If you fancy dance music....this album is up your alley. I loved FEVER, BUTTERFLY, BURNING UP, LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT, LOVE AFFAIR and CAN'T GET YOU OUT OF MY HEAD. It's a shame that Ms. Minogue is not touring in the states.....I know if she was....I would be there singing La La La La La La La!
B00005UEAR|3.0|Well I dont really know what else to say. It was a great musical statement. The playing and production INCREDIBLE. The ideas...perfect.<BR>BUT, what the hell its boring. Straight up boring. <BR>I spent 21.00 on this. It doesnt bother me because the band deserves the support so if DT is going to read this consider my 21.00 a down payment towards a better CD.
B000002OX7|5.0|Your cd collection is indeed not a collection until you own this. A great rocker and truly a level of excellence was achieved that served as a benchmark for other groups for years. An essential cd without question.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer can be described in two words:  &quot;pure genius&quot;.  Many people say that his music sounds alot like Dave Matthews; however, it is only his voice that has a trace of the DMB.  These upbeat, heart-warming lyrics make me feel great about life everytime I listen to them.  There may arguably be two weak songs on this album, nevertheless, it is a solid composition.  &quot;Your Body Is a Wonderland&quot; may be the majority favorite, but &quot;Why Georgia&quot;, &quot;Neon&quot;, &quot;83&quot;, and &quot;Not Myself&quot; help to round it out.  There is a little something for everyone and it gives a positive perspective of life.  Its a fresh breath of air from the more depressing music out there.  You won't regret this buy.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|I thought this movie was supposed to be good it [stinks]. it was full of cliches and [bad] songs that they stole fom other places. It was stupid and really ... if i could give it zero stars i would. I think it is the biggest ... mistake that this movie is nominated for best pictue come on it a complete joke.
0800141660|5.0|I had an itch last night to rent this movie and watch it for the third time. Now on DVD I can see the deleted scenes and audio commnetary which makes the film more rich and wonderful. I only say this is &quot;nearly&quot; number one because possibly my most favorite romantic movie is &quot;Truly, Madly, Deeply&quot; featuring another fine performance by Alan Rickman. Whom I adore in this film as Col. Brandon...completely out performing fellow Brit and often-cast romantic good-guy, Hugh Grant. Rickman was dashing yet restrained as the colonel and instantly makes you fall in love. The scenery is lovely and pastoral. My only complaint are the hideous Napolean Empire style gowns. Although, those never look good on women (I think). Otherwise, everything else is flawless. A beautiful screenplay from Thompson, excellent performances and charming characters. I recommend this to any romantic at heart!
B000002UAI|5.0|Beatles for sale is still one of their all time best sellers, and with good reason... some of their best material(eight days a week,I'll follow the sun,rock and roll music, words of love,ect is included here).I might listen to this one as much or more so then some of the rest!
B000062Y98|4.0|This could be the best power metal album of the year. Like previous Blind Guardian albums, its fast, heavy and beautifully orchestrated, with even more choir vocals than before. All the songs are very good, specially the 14 minute opus &quot;And Then There Was Silence&quot;, based on the war of Troy. In no other Blind Guardian record the keyboards are that prominent, and in some parts they even sound like a progressive metal band (Precious Jerusalem, Punishment Divine). As much as I like this record, I also have to face that it is the same Blind Guardian style as always, only with more keyboards and choirs. The riffs are the same, the lyrics are the same, the drum beats are the same; sometimes it seems like they are ripping themselves off. But the music is still good, intense and epic even if it is more of the same; and lets face it: if Iron Maiden can get away with it then these guys can too, even more because their songs actually have feeling and power! I only miss those really cool renaissance songs like &quot;A Past and Future Secret&quot;...maybe next album!
0783229569|5.0|A film that lives up to the infamous novel.  Depp is ideal as the Hunter we think we know from countless rolling Stone and other writings.  Benedico plays his part FLAWLESSLY!  Don't take a first date to this movie though, unless she's into ether.
B00003CXXP|2.0|I have always been a lover of Steven Spielberg's work. But he tried too hard to make this film reminiscent of the work of Stanley Kubrick, who began the film before his death. About an hour into the movie, the story takes an almost tangible turn from Spielberg's world of warm and heartfelt, tear jerking fantasy to the grim un-reality and horrific science-fiction underworld of Kubrick, whose passion for the underbelly of storytelling definitely has a place in the film world, just not in this particular movie. Closer to the end of the movie, an attempt to bring the two opposing ends of the spectrum together backfires, leaving the audience with benefit-of-the-doubt thoughts like, \\"Maybe no one could figure out the best way to end it,\\" or, \\"Maybe he meant to end it an hour ago and the camera just didn't shut off.\\" Either way, A.I. Artificial Intelligence is definitely not a feat of fine movie-making, apart from the captivating, however misplaced, special effects and the brilliantly mastered talent of Haley Joel Osment, who stars.
B000002H33|5.0|Nothing compares.  Before Metallica went down the path of commercialism (their choice, I'm not gonna rag them on it), they put out some of the best and most innovative metal albums ever.  Master of Puppets is the crown jewel.  Every song is a masterpiece.  <BR>Also check out Kill 'em All, Ride the Lightning, ...and Justice for All, and the Black Album.  Albums from other bands that you should check out if you like MoP: Anthax's Among the Living, Slayer's Reign in Blood, Megadeth's Peace Sells, and Testament's New Order.
B00005BJ2O|5.0|Hi all! I wish to change my former review: I love this CD!!! At the beggining I thought it would be bad because it does not contain the original songs, but I heard it and I absolutly adore it. Both Nicole Kidman and Ewan MacGregor are superb, keep on the good work (espacially Ewan, if I may) and well in conclusion: if you loved the movie - buy this CD. If you didn't like the movie - maybe you should watch it again, cause it's great!
B00003CXXP|3.0|as i heard my friend put it &quot;Stanley Kubrick provides the intelligence while Spielberg supplies us with the artificial half&quot;. i just dont get how you can combine the director reknowned for films like A clockwork orange,full metal jacket and Dr strangelove, with the man who brought us such masterpeices as Tiny toon adventures, Jurassic park, and who could forget, jurassic park II. it went from being a startling look at the future of humanity, to ET. it all died for me when it turned into big bad beetle borgs. sure, the movie definately had its good points. haley joel osment did a fine job, as well as Johnny Depps English twin brother,Jude Law. the beginning was fantastic. if you watch the movie's beginning,skip the entire &quot;flesh fair scene&quot; and watch the rest of the movie up until steven spielberg turns the movie into just another excuse to use special effects, its bearable. the movie would have been worlds better had stanley kubrick worked on it.
B00000IQMT|5.0|My introduction to orchestral music was the work of John Williams in the Lucas and Spielburg movies, and I've followed his work closely ever since.  This score, without question, is one of his top-5 works, if not second only to Star Wars (A New Hope) itself.<br />Firstly, there are the new themes, especially Duel of the Fates and Anakin's theme.  They are great pieces in their own right, and I listen to them regularly as &quot;classical&quot; music.  Secondly, there are the running motifs that are not exactly themes, such as the predominance of percussion for the Droid Army's music (and it's better than previous percussion work in, say, Empire Strikes Back).  Thirdly, there's only a hint of the old themes, such as the Imperial March in Anakin's Theme, and the (very bare hint of) Emperor's Theme in the Funeral music.  Williams here straddle's the line perfectly - he could easily have adapted old themes to the new situations, but instead chose new themes with the barest hints of the old intertwined within them.<br />Finally, the variety of music in the score as a whole is startling.  To fully appreciate this, listen to the soundtrack for Empire Strikes Back, Jurassic Park, or Jaws, and compare the number of times the title themes crop up (especially Empire - how often do we hear the Imperial March theme?!?).  With the Phantom Menace soundtrack, we have everything from choral (Duel of the Fates) to fanfare (Flag Parade) to suspense (Passage Through the Planet Core).  Of course, there's a healthy dose of John Williams adventure music, and it's more fun and interesting to listen to, because it's so varied.<br />Therefore, if you are a fan of Williams or action movie scores, by all means BUY THIS CD!  If you think you'd like to sample Williams to see what all the fuss is about, this is the place to start.
B00004Y6NW|4.0|Released in the late 70's in America, this Mark Knopfler-led quarter garnered a sold-out tour, a multi-platinum album and a #1 single in the massively popular &quot;Sultans of Swing.&quot; Knopfler's Dylanesque vocal stylings and virtuoso Stratocaster lead guitar playing were the perfect breath of fresh air to American radio audiences tired of the power chording incompetence of Oingo Boingo, The Buzzcocks, The Waitresses, and the rest of the post-disco New Wave ilk. Indeed, Dire Straits sound so impressed rock writers of the day, they practically represented New Wave's platform of individuality and originality of expression. Unlike most of that movement's tenants, however, Dire Straits proved they were here for the duration, amassing another masterpiece with 1983's &quot;Making Movies&quot; and a multi-platinum seller with 1987's &quot;Brothers In Arms.&quot; Knopfler's ingenious use of echo is tastefully woven between dobro and hard-rocking guitar (&quot;Down to The Waterline,&quot; &quot;Water Of Love&quot;) and the lyrics back up the tough, if sparse, instrumental arrangements. The group's sound would change with the departure of rhythm guitarist David Knopfler and drummer Pique Withers, but this late-70's statement remains the genesis of a genuinely fresh and talented rock group whose frontman's (Mark Knopfler) compositions continue to change popular music today.
B00004Z459|1.0|&quot;True&quot; and &quot;Classic&quot; are tags that will NEVER fit this band.<BR>There is NO real musicality in this group of compromising youngsters. The CD itself will bore you with songs that's filled with stolen riffs from other band's work and dragging alternative choruses that basically sound the same. I have heard the entire CD myself and I am NOT convinced that a band like this deserve the fame that others (Biohazard, Testament, Machine Head,....) have been denied upon.<BR>There are no &quot;real&quot; good songs here. There are no guitar wizardry of some sort--there's not even a single guitar solo for cryin' out loud!! Avoid this like you avoid leprosy. Not worth a dime!!
B000000H42|5.0|This cd is loaded with awesome music!  The lyrics are some of the best well written satanic lyrics i have ever heard.  The music is incredible! Awesome cd dealing with satanic pacts, satan, seances, and crazy stuff like that. This is such a good cd.  King Diamond really shines with his ear piercing Falsetos.  He knows what hes talking about when it comes to satan!  Buy this cd, and remember Don't Break The Oath!!!!!!!!
B000002H33|5.0|Great songs from start to finish. Everything here is done in perfection. I have nothing to add here. All is said by the previous reviewers. Just buy this.
B00005RYLE|4.0|Don't get me wrong -- I'm a total Evil Deadhed all the way through. I was just disappointed in the features that should have been a bang-zoom kind of explosion that ended up being some type of Roman candles. Okay, but not what I was expecting.<br />First the good -- the cover is excellent. Kind of this squishy latex foam (stinky) cover to simulate human skin -- it's also chock full of Tom Sullivan's drawing. Artistically, pretty cool but not great to stack with your DVDs.<br />FANanalysis, the documentary by Bruce Campbell was great. Bruce takes Evil DeadHeads behind the scenes at conventions and offers an intimate portrayal of himself interacting. Although it was very short (23 minutes) I thoroughly enjoyed watching this little gem of an addition to this DVD. A must-see.<br />The sound and picture of the Evil Dead is outstanding. Considering this was a cheaply made film, MAN did they clean everything up and clarify all the details of the movie. Probably the best I've seen.<br />Plus, there are some Easter Eggs in this DVD. At main menu:<br />Egg 1: go to EXTRAS highlight \\"trailer\\" > arrow left that should highlight a fish, click it (this will play a screen test for the animation of one of the zombies)<br />Egg 2: at EXTRAS click \\"more\\" highlight \\"fanalysis\\" > arrow left<br />that will highlight a skull, click it (this features a short film of a discussion of Evil Dead. Robert Tapert and the actresses who play Linda and Shelly discuss a little about what went on during the filming. Robert briefly mentions his wife &lt;who is the actress who plays Xena for those of you who didn't know> Also talks a bit about their next film collaboration that could be the 4th Evil Dead)<br />Now, the not-so-great. Well, unfortunately, the prequel \\"Within the Woods\\" was apparently pulled by some yahoo guy at the last minute at Columbia. Why, we don't know but I know a number of fans were really ticked about this. Don't despair! Surf the web and you'll find ways of getting a bootleg --albeit a crappy copy, but it's out there. And you have GOT to see it -- you will see all the inspiration for Evil Dead including the parts that ended up transferring over to the next two flicks.<br />The commentary was cut into two sections: Bruce by himself and Rob Tapert and Sam Raimi on the other. If you have the Evil Dead 2 special edition, you'd appreciate the commentary for the way they kid each other. Bruce is great with technical details but I think they should have had him comment with Sam and Rob. Sam has a tendency to get into his flicks and go quiet so there were long pauses despite the fact Rob was with him. They should have had the three of them together for one commentary as it is too much fun listening to them all kid each other and laugh about how they pulled Evil Dead off. At one point, Rob questions why they separated them for the commentaries (which tells me it wasn't their idea) and I missed their friendly bantering.<br />The outtakes section was interesting, but boring. I got the impression it was them messing up and laughing, but alas, it was merely unused takes and footage. Not bad, but probably interesting for die-hard fans only.<br />Overall, it's a good DVD, but incomplete. I get the impression that \\"Within the Woods\\" is thought of by the studios as a money-maker which might be why they pulled it at the last second. If this is apparent, then hopefully the hesitant studios will realize that the Dead series is a money maker and offer the funds for a new flick.<br />Good for die-hard fans, decent collectable.eit a crappy copy, but it's out there.

B000006TRV|3.0|1979 was the last year of the \\"Me Decade\\" and perhaps no rock album better presents the psychology of the time than \\"The Wall\\".  This two-disc, 26-song set is a harrowing look at the nature of rock stardom, presented in a \\"rock opera\\" form through the jaundiced eye of bassist Roger Waters.  <br />The protagonist of \\"The Wall\\" is Pink, a young man whose growing alienation from society has led him to construct a wall around himself.  Various \\"bricks\\" include the death of his father in combat, his overbearing mother, his sadistic schoolmasters, his unfaithful, uncaring wife, his own drug use, and eventually, the pressures of the rock star machine which turn Pink into a hate-spewing neo-fascist icon.  At the album's climax, Pink's wall is torn down as it reveals a scared and broken man.<br />Much of the inspiration for \\"The Wall\\" comes from Waters' own life, as well as Syd Barrett--Pink Floyd's original guitarist whose descent into madness has been well-documented.  Waters more than proves his worth as one of rock music's great wordsmiths, and his relentlessly cynical view on the role of mass media in modern society is breaktaking and courageous.  The production by Waters, guitarist David Gilmour and veteran producer Bob Ezrin is thoroughly professional and top-of-the-line.  The sound of the music and the sound effects are also quite amazing.  <br />However, the problem with \\"The Wall\\" is Waters' relentless cheerlessness.  It's very difficult to sit through a complete listening, not only because the album is so long, but also because it's so miserable in tone.  Personally, I found it hard to relate to the Pink character and was a bit puzzled by his transformation from sullen, depressed everyman to hateful fascist dictator.  <br />In addition, it's clear that Waters' megalomania was deterioriating the beauty of Pink Floyd's music.  Not to say that the music in \\"The Wall\\" is bad--far from it!  But, Waters' strengths always lay with lyrics and concepts, not melodies.    \\"The Wall\\" is lacking in its moments of beauty like \\"Us and Them\\" or \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\".  It's interesting to note that Gilmour's guitar solos in \\"Comfortably Numb\\" (one of the few songs not solely credited to Waters) are easily the album's highpoints.  It's a shame that there aren't more moments in \\"The Wall\\" like them.<br />In the end, if you're more than a casual fan of Pink Floyd, then \\"The Wall\\" is an essential purchase, both to understand their musical catalogue and why the band disintegrated after its release.  If you're simply a casual fan, stick to \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\". <br />\\"The Wall\\" is a compelling listen, but certainly not the best thing Pink Floyd ever recorded.
B00005LB9O|4.0|&quot;Beautiful&quot; is the first word that comes to mind when describing Travis, and more specifically THE INVISIBLE BAND. Anyone capable of human emotion can not help but be moved by Fran Healy's astonishing vocals. The lyrics are at times trite, but are always meaningful; those songs that don't challenge the intellect are sure to challenge the soul. The opening track &quot;Sing&quot; is pure fun and one of the most sonically interesting pop songs released in the last year. Their producer, Nigel Godrich (also Radiohead's producer) is all over this record...the songs flow into each other so naturally that it appears as if Fran and the boys have written one long opus instead of a collection of 12 songs. I highly recommend this record to anyone who enjoys inspiring melodies and well-crafted, delightful songs.
B000000P17|3.0|This album still gets trashed by the rock press and the public alike.  Some of this criticism is deserved.  In 1993, with Nirvana and Pearl Jam at their apex, Guns N' Roses doing an album mostly of punk rock covers seemed like a lame attempt at the musical credibility they had thrown away with pap like \\"November Rain\\" and \\"Don't Cry\\".  Furthermore, the cover of Charles Manson's \\"Look at Your Game Girl\\" is done in the poorest taste imagineable....<br />However, the rest of the CD really isn't that bad. ...Some of their versions are almost as good as the originals (e.g., Nazareth's \\"Hair of the Dog\\").  If you're a die-hard GNR fan, or simply a hard rock enthusiast, then you should get \\"The Spaghetti Incident?\\"--preferably at a bargain price.
B000002MY3|5.0|Well, it seems like it's been a very long time since we've heard from Alanis Morissette, doesn't it? With her newest CD \\"Under Rug Swept\\" out now for not quite an entire month, I feel I should review \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" once more.<br />Coming out of the wave of late 80's \\"cutting edge\\" rap, Mariah Carey reaching her peak with albums like \\"Butterfly\\" and \\"Rainbow,\\" and of course the Spice Girls/Hanson pop explosion, there were lots of different types of music floating around. When we turned on our televisions and saw a seemingly ordinary Canadian woman with a guitar, I think 98% of the world stopped to watch.<br />Alanis Morissette shocked (and pleased) everyone with her emotional world-debut single \\"You Oughta Know.\\" It's just so easy to love every song on this CD, especially \\"You Oughtta Know\\" (Who can resist lyrics like \\"Does she know how you told me until you die-but you're still alive?\\")<br />The album has such amazing works on it. <br />3. Perfect is one of my favorites. The pressure people put on you, what they expect from you- it's just to exhausting sometimes. \\"We love you, if you're perfect\\" is often the feeling you get from parents or siblings. Anyone could relate to this song.<br />5. Right Through You is simply irresistible. \\"You scan the credits for your name and wonder why it's not there.\\" \\"Narcissus\\" (On Under Rug Swept) sort of sounds like a follow-up to this. <br />7. You Learn is possibly my favorite of the album. You live, you learn, you lose, you learn. This is so universal and always sounds fresh. I love listening to it!<br />9. Mary Jane is a really odd song, but very soft compared the rest. It's a nice change in tempo.<br />10. Ironic is absolutely outstanding. She tells several stories with the lyrics and it too is a little bit softer than the other tracks.

B00004W5UA|5.0|Fight Club isn't a movie for everyone.  People who don't like violence or incredibly weird plot twists (even though there's only one incredibly weird plot twist, it's a doozy) should bypass this one.  However, people who don't mind the afformentioned should consider at least renting Fight Club.<br />This movie is very stylish, which is something I appreciate in movies.  Of course, I've seen plenty of horrible movies that were very stylish, so Fight Club's got a lot more redeeming qualities than just that.  Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are awesome together in this movie.  I didn't really like Helena Bonham Carter in this though.  On top of some pretty cool fight scenes, the humorous parts of this movie are very funny, the most memorable for me was when Tyler Durden and Norton's nameless character steal from a liposuction clinic.<br />All in all, this movie moves quickly, and never gets boring.  It has just the right amount of action, comedy, and one incredibly weird plot twist.

B00003CWN2|5.0|I know little about the real story of Teena Brandon, but, nonetheless, this is a great movie.  I'm not sure, however, if I'd buy it.  This is a movie that I've seen twice, and I thought once was enough.  It's a hard movie to get through.  The performances by each member of the cast are brilliant, the story moves quickly, the direction is teriffic, but the end and knowing that this is a true story make the movie hard to stomach.  This movie will affect you.  As a native of the Midwest, I've never seen such an accurate portrayal of smalltown USA and its assbackwardness in a movie before.
0446677450|5.0|And I am glad that I have read this wonderful book.<br />Every where I went, I heard about this book.  And for whatever reason, I kept saying, &quot;Yeah, okay, I'll get to it.&quot;  I do this because when I find a book, I must find it as part of my life's journey.  It must call me as part of my solving some fundamental problems, in my life.  And that definitely was the case with this book.<br />Because I didn't have enough money to do something that I had my heart set on doing, I had lowered my standards to collaborate with someone who, as it turned out judged me, not by character but by color.  And when I walked away from her, as I drove across town, I just had to find the answer.  So, I bought this book.  And in one day, I read my way to some of life's most fundamental answers.<br />I received more than I expected.  For example, as a freelance journalist, I often wonder about some books, and how they become best-sellers.  Kiyosaki answers that.  I also wondered what the rich tell their children that seems so much a part of the fiber of their being.  Kiyosaki also answered that.<br />This book, while philosophical and not a how to, is definitely an inspiration.<br />Another point that inspired me, while reading this book is that Ray Kroc, of McDonald's became wealthy not because he has the best hamburgers, but instead because he believed that he is in real estate - and here in San Diego, with his widow making so many generous donations, involving land, we see the results of that focus.<br />Read this book to become financially intelligent, and to leave a legacy.
6304082428|5.0|First, I read the book, then I watched the video--and watched it, and watched it, and watched it: fast forward, reverse, pause, slow, and started all over again.  Then I watched a segment, read the corresponding version in the book; reversed that, listened only, watched with the sound off; then sent for a companion book: The Making of Pride and Prejudice by Sue Birtwistle and Sue Conklin and found it invaluable.  The story captivated me but seeing Jane Austin's work brought to life gave the story an added dimension that has given me many happy hours of enjoyment.  I was so very pleased with the casting that I honestly couldn't recommend any changes but some performances demand extra comment.  I always thought that although the book is written from a woman's point of view, the character of greatest interest was Darcy and I simply couldn't imagine anyone improving over Colin Firth's performance so I rented the version with Sir Lawrence Olivier.  I found his protrayal weak and insipid next to that of Colin Firth.  I know jlind555 (another reviewer) has strongly disagreed but when I read the book--I saw and imagined Darcy would be just as Firth performed.  As a shy, taciturn man, Darcy has to come off as aloof and very controlled.  I imagine that must be so difficult for an actor to do--convey a great deal of depth without much dialogue or, in many scenes, not even much action to assist him/her along.  By watching the Darcy scenes in slow motion, I saw things that I missed at regular speed because changes of expression were gradual and very controlled--the lift of an eyebrow here, the shifting of eyes there, the habit of turning the ring on his left pinkie which was a subtle way of showing his nervousness.  Olivier, by contrast, was just too &quot;bouncy&quot;.  Jennifer Ehle was very beautiful, had wonderfully &quot;fine eyes,&quot; and did an excellent Elizabeth; Crispin Bonham-Carter was so likeable and perfect, it was as if he had just walked out of the book.  Mrs.Bennett was a delight and I liked Lady Catherine de Burgh in spite of herself!  I didn't trust Wickham from the moment he stepped before the camera which was a fine line for Adrian Lukis to walk since he was supposed to be so agreeable.  The Making of...book had some wonderful surprises for me including the background on costumes etc. (which is something I will look for in future viewings) but it shows Lady Catherine, Mr. Hurst, and Mr. Collins as they really are and I loved their performances even more!
B00005QIPH|3.0|I swear I've heard this CD somewhere before. Hmm, it'll come to me in a second.  <BR>Oh yeah, that would be the LATE 1970's.<br />Perhaps the most overhyped CD of the year.
B00004TH7Z|5.0|I bought this CD when it first came out.I must say I really liked it.It is great to have the old Maiden sound back.
B00003CWOL|5.0|You're all pansies, just stfu and watch the movie.
B000000W5N|5.0|Although it's thirty-some years old, this is the Rolling Stones at the absolute top of their game.  This makes an excellent first Rolling Stones CD for the new Stones fan.  The writing and playing are absolutely first rate, especially the guitar work (w/ the addition of Mick Taylor).  A great, classic combination of updated blues and solid rock and roll.  You can't go wrong with this purchase.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|What an innovative, dazzling piece of filmmaking!<br />One of the most original films of the past decade, Moulin Rouge juxtaposes a classic, tragic love story with swirling Mtv-like camera work and a boisterous soundtrack. (Standout tunes include a surprisingly good remake of Nirvana's &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; and a Bollywood-inspired take on &quot;Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend.&quot;) <br />This is a film for people who love both flashy Broadway dance numbers and excellent acting.<br />Hands down, this is the most feature-rich DVD I have ever come across. Special tidbits include (but are not limited to): Designers' Commentary, Dance Rehearsals, &quot;International Sizzle Reel&quot; (Their term. Not mine.), Set Design Overview, and In-Depth Interviews with the Performers. Also, if you play around with the scroll buttons on your remote, you're likely to come across a secret feature or two. (Keep your eyes peeled for the red windmill or fairy.)<br />Excellent!
B000003BF4|5.0|An outstanding, hard-playing look into the Stone's 1969 tour.  Recorded at Madison Square Garden in November, this album does not have a single dud on it.  Mick Taylor and Keith Richards are flawless!  The live version of \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" is superior to the studio attempt.  Although it will probably never happen, I'd like to see the Stones release some additional material or performances from the 1969 tour.  Well, maybe they will if the Stones think they can make a ton of dough on it. But, anyway, this, along with Sticky Fingers, are unquestionably the top two individual (non-compilation) Rolling Stones CD's to have.
B00005YT8U|3.0|Answer: To make an album with The Chieftains. Seriously, if you like collaborations, this is OK; but The Chieftains are best straight up!
B000002LFU|5.0|R.E.M. leaves the claustrophobia of their beginnings and finally makes an \\"up\\" record. They take full advantage of the studio and layer the record with lots of light psychedelic touches. This band has always been moody...but this record shows how playful and arty they could get. Never sounded better to me.
0062502182|3.0|I came to the Alchemist without any preconceived ideas about its purpose as an inspirational tome or its literary accolades.  It was only after completing it on a flight back to WA from AZ and going to review it, that I saw the 306 polarized opinions.  Read for simply entertainment value, it is a light, breezy tale of a shepherd who makes a personal vision quest to find a treasure ostensibly in him the whole time.  Sprinkled throughout is a hodgepodge of philosophical / new age tidbits from more mature belief systems and religions.  I read with mild amusement the author's take on the idea of Platonic Forms and absolute truths, harkening back to my classical philosophy readings.  I could see where its continually hammered message of `listen to your heart' might hit home with those yearning for direction, and to that I say, \\"To each, their own\\".  People find inspiration in many things, and apparently this book provides that to some.  For sheer elegance in a short form, I enjoyed Silk by Barrico much more but found the Alchemist innocuous enough, and not deserving of the vitriol of some of the reviews.
B000059HCN|3.0|If you like sobering material like \\"Leaving Las Vegas\\" you might enjoy this film.  Then again, Leaving Las Vegas at least had some vestige of hope for it's characters.  This one most definitely does not.  I give it three stars, not because it's not a five star movie (the film is beautifully shot, it's sound design is suburb -- for any person who enjoys film simply for it's exploration of the medium, this is a must-see) but because it leaves you with that sick feeling in your stomach, a sense of deep sorrow (think \\"Kids\\", another movie I'm still recovering from).  Worth seeing? yes.  Ever want to see it again? About as much as I want a punch in the gut.
0307120007|2.0|my daughter loves this book, but has obliterated it since it is so poorly made (light cardboard w/a plastic ring binder).  the \\"touch and feel\\" series is a better bet.
6302787300|5.0|My would this look great on DVD. 1492 - Conquest Of Paradise is a wonderful film about the man who we think we know quite well as Christopher Columbus. Simple fact is nobody knows what Christopher Columbus was really like as a person. I think you couldn't try any harder than they did here. A visual treat it is and when the DVD is released by Paramount, a must own DVD!
B00004UEDQ|3.0|The previews, at least the theatrical ones, for 28 Days are misleading. They put the emphasis on its comedic moments. The movie is actually a drama, a cautionary tale about the toll substance abuse has on one young woman. Because the character is rescued before she hits bottom or does anything she will forever regret, the humor has its place here.<br />Sandra Bullock is Gwen Cummings, a writer who loves to party. She lives with an Englishman named Jasper [Dominic West], who makes the perfect playmate. They drink, they go out to dinner, they drink some more, they go dancing, they go home and drink even more. When they can remember, they pop a few pills to make things even merrier. One night they light some candles to enhance a lovemaking session. In the process they nearly burn their apartment down. Things come to a head when they arrive late and higher than kites at her older sister's wedding. Gwen ruins the special day, then commandeers a limo, wrecks it and winds up in jail. The judge gives her a suspended sentence but orders her to go to a rehab center. Typical of an addict, Gwen minimizes the extent of her problem. She does not think she needs to be in the center because she believes she can give up her habit on her own. She is in for some surprises, not all of them pleasant.<br />I will admit that Ms. Bullock is not one of my favorite actresses. She's fairly lightweight. I've also never seen much chemistry between her and her costars when she's chosen to do romantic roles. She has her good points. Off screen, she is a great businessperson. In a movie like 28 Days, she is not afraid to be seen looking unglamorous, and this does lend credibility to her performance. She is also wise enough not to try to dominate a picture. <br />There are two fine supporting actresses. Elizabeth Perkins is convincing as Gwen's sister, who has spent a lifetime rescuing Gwen and is sick of it. Azura Skye is touching as Gwen's young roommate, Andrea, whose problems are quite serious.<br />The depiction of a rehab center here is a very Hollywood vision. Most of the patients are stereotypes of what addicts are like. Still, 28 Days is a likable movie, and it does provide a message. For more accurate portrayals of drug and alcohol addiction, I would recommend Postcards From the Edge and Girl, Interrupted. Two of the finest films on the subject are much older - The Lost Weekend [1948] and The Days of Wine and Roses [1962].
6305508550|4.0|Great movie, very funny, jokes were in very good taste for today's comedy (I tend to like the dirty comedy). Anyway, as far as the review from anonymous, Bend OR, maybe if you stopped bending over and taking it in the A## then you would find the humor in this movie.
B00003CWNR|5.0|The Cider House Rules is based on a novel by the fine American writer, John Irving. Over the years, it has proved difficult to translate his works into movies. The results have ranged from fair [The World According to Garp] to dismal [Hotel New Hampshire]. This time around, Mr. Irving chose to take a more active role in the process, and the results are splendid. <br />The first part of the movie is set in an orphanage in rural Maine in the late 1940s. Homer Wells [Tobey Macguire] is a young man who has spent his entire life there and is its oldest orphan. Fortunately for him, he has been taken under the wing of kindly, eccentric Dr. Wilber Larch [Michael Caine] who has been in charge of the place for many years. He has worked so closely with Dr. Larch that he now knows as much about medicine as almost any doctor. Still, he is in an odd situation. Not only is he not really a doctor, he's never been to high school. He is all knowledge and no credentials. As far as Dr. Larch is concerned, Homer can stay there forever and eventually wind up running the orphanage. Homer, however, yearns to see the world. One afternoon a beautiful woman named Ashley [Charlize Theron] appears with her fiance. She is there to have an abortion. Dr. Larch has performed many of these, every one of them illegal, because he has come to believe that there are simply too many unwanted children in the world. This is the one subject that Homer is in total disagreement on with his mentor. After the operation, Homer leaves the orphanage with Ashley and her boyfriend. This begins the second story line, which in the end ties in with the first one. <br />Michael Caine won Best Supporting Actor for his role. His is one of the most memorable characters in recent times, as well as one of the most poignant. His love of the children in his care is unconditional, while at the same time he is dismayed and saddened by a world that allows these innocents to be so callously cast aside. Tobey Macguire, as I have stated before, is one of our most gifted actors. It is always amazing to me to see such masterful and understated performances by one so young. As for the set design and photography, The Cider House Rules is about as good as it gets. Rachel Portman has contributed a brilliant and melancholy musical score.<br />With the current abortion controversy raging like the Hatfield and McCoy feud, it is reassuring that Miramax Films had the courage to make this movie at all. The Cider House Rules treats the subject with great dignity and proves once more that, in any area, where there is a rule, there is an exception.
B000060P79|5.0|if you like blink 182 or sum 41 then you will love this cd. well not to mention mark hoppus is feat. in 'i'd do anything'. but god every song is just amazing. i espeically love meet you here and wont be there. so you should def. buy a copy of this cd. oh and they're awesome in concert.
B00004YA66|4.0|I think that Frequency's screenwriter, Toby Emmerich, set out to write a rather original sci-fi movie script. This he did, but he also wound up creating something more. Frequency is one of the best stories about the relationship between father and son ever. I can recommend it as a sci-fi thriller. I can highly recommend it as a modern American drama.<br />As always, I will give you a short plot synopsis, but I must add that, on paper, the story loses something in transition and seems a bit goofy. <br />John Sullivan [James Caviezel] is a cop who lives in the house he grew up in in New York City's Queens borough. He is a a low point in his life now that his wife has walked out on him. One day he and his best friend Gordo [Noah Emmerich] find an old ham radio that John's deceased Dad owned. One night, during a huge display in the sky by the northern lights, some sort of cosmic disturbance occurs. The fabric of time is altered, and John finds himself talking on the old radio to his father, Frank [Dennis Quaid]. Once both of them determine it is not a hoax, John tells Frank, who is living in 1969, that he would not have died in a warehouse fire if only he had tried to escape the other way. The next day, the anniversary of his death, Frank, a fireman, does turn the other way and survives. Joy soon turns to horror when the men discover that they have inadvertently changed the future. They must work together to prevent an even greater tragedy.<br />It is in the two's working together that the story takes flight. Father and son are separated by time. All of their interaction takes place through this ham radio, each man sitting at the same desk thirty years apart. The love between the two is so real and so strong that even the hardest of grown men might shed a tear or two while watching the movie. Caviezel is brilliant, and Quaid is better than he has been in years. I think much of the credit goes to director Gregory Hoblit. Most of his experience has been in television, most notably directing episodes of Hill Street Blues and LA Law. His knowledge of the small screen is part of what makes the scenes between father and son so intimate and believable. Also compelling is how each actor seems so much a part of their time. This is a subtle but important difference that only greatly talented people can bring off. Some great performances are also given by Noah Emmerich, Elizabeth Mitchell as Julia Sullivan, Daniel Henson as John at age six, and Shawn Doyle as Jack Shepard, the villain of the movie.<br />INSIDE SHOTS: Writer Toby Emmerich originally used the idea of a small black hole's causing the time fracture. The studio decided that wasn't filmable enough. Don't blame Emmerich for the illogical substitution of northern lights...
0783235607|5.0|This movie was a great film! I just loved it. The black and white version is great. Im reading the book, too. Anyways, in this film, there is this girl Marion Crane (in the book Mary) that steals about 40,000 dollars and goes to stay at the Bates motel where no one goes that much since the new road was built. This guy, Norman Bates, is obsessed with his mother which lives on the house on the hill. (the big one). They are both maniacs, and im not giving away any endings. I've seen most horror films and this one was one of the bests!
6305897786|4.0|The Ninth Gate is an intriguing thriller that will put some viewers off because it is a throwback to a time when special effects were not king. There are virtually no F/X here and what few there are ones the movies could easily do thirty years ago. Personally, I enjoy seeing a good story and good acting, so I wasn't much bothered by this. I know that much of today's audience is conditioned to expect lots of graphics and thunderous noises. Knowing beforehand that they are mainly absent here may help some people to enjoy this occult story more. <br />Dean Corso [Johnny Depp] deals in rare books. He's not an intellectual. He's a shrewd operator, and it's all about money. When we first meet him, he is dealing with the greedy children of an incapacitated old man. He does his appraisal, and along the way, he talks them into selling a first edition of Don Quixote for $4,100. He makes a killing on the deal. His next appointment is with Boris Balkan [Frank Langella], a billionaire collector of books. Balkan has purchased one of three existing copies of a book published in 1668. The author was accused of witchcraft and burned at the stake. Balkan alleges that only one of the three copies is authentic, and he offers Dean a fortune to go to Europe in order to examine the others. Dean has no spiritual beliefs. He believes in profit. He doesn't think much about the deal until he notices he is being followed. Next his apartment is ransacked. He gives the book to a friend for safe keeping. This has dire consequences, but Dean decides to go on to Europe anyway. The other half of his pay depends on his going through with the deal. He goes first to Spain and then to Paris. Along the way, everything becomes spooky, and the death toll mounts. Dean starts to believe.<br />Depp, as usual, is great. Wearing eye glasses and sporting graying temples, he is totally believable in the part. Langella has only three scenes, but he makes the most of them. Barbara Jeffers is notable as a rich, hard-nosed book collector who sizes Dean up in about ten seconds. <br />Roman Polanski has lived in France for many years and has returned to his European roots as a film maker. The Ninth Gate has a much slower pace than did his Hollywood classics, Rosemary's Baby and Chinatown. Europeans tend to take their time in telling a story. They like to color things in. I enjoy this from time to time, but the pace will prove to slow for some viewers. I also should tell you that the 'payoff' at the movie's climax is pretty tame and ambiguous by American standards. We no longer comprehend the concept of understatement.
6305171769|4.0|I dont know if this is the last film in the series or not. im pretty sure another one may come out. Anyways, this movie really wasn't scary if you know what I mean. It was gory. If you think blood, gore, and people being crushed is &quot;scary&quot; this movie is for you. It didn't scare me at all. Maybe because it had such good effects that it just wasn't scary. It was good though. Janet Leigh and Jamie Lee Curtis (janet's daughter) star in this film. It's a whole new creation :)
B00003CXGG|2.0|Romeo Must Die is typical of a number of recent action-adventure movies. Fill the screen with lots of special effects, with heavy emphasis on explosions. Raise the decibel level on the sound track. Mix in a lot of jarring hip-hop music, paying scant attention to whether or not the vocals have anything to do with the movie. Give all the bad guys flashy cars to drive, lots of great jewelry to wear and houses to live in that are bigger and grander than those lived in by the CEOs of Fortune 500 companies. Finally, make the villains more likable by implying that tactics such as drug dealing and homicide are the only means certain people have to succeed and that most of them plan to go straight one day soon. The result of all this hocus pocus is that it will hopefully divert the audience so much that it will not realize that the movie has a dumb plot, if it has one at all. Or maybe to make them too dazed and confused to care.<br />As Romeo Must Die opens, two gangster warlords, one black and one Chinese, are in open warfare with each other. Since each one's fortune will be made by a joint effort to put together a deal with a supposedly legitimate corporation, I never understood the war part, but who needs a plot? The war is just a setup so that Chinese warlord Ch'u Sing's [Henry O] son can get murdered, the obvious suspects being members of the black gang and their leader, Isaak O'Day [Delray Lindo]. This provides an excuse for Sing's other son, Han [Jet Li], to single-handedly break out of a Hong Kong prison, come to America and seek revenge. One day in San Francisco, where the movie is set, Han steals a cab [don't ask] and just happens to rescue Trish O'Day [Aaliyah], Isaak's daughter, who is fleeing one of Dad's bodyguards, one that is supposed to be protecting her. Han whisks her away, never once thinking that the police might be looking for said cab. When he lets her off, their eyes meet, the music sweeps up, and, yes, love has landed. Both are alienated from their fathers, he on a little matter of Dad's letting him take the rap back in Hong King to save the old man's hide, and she because father is a self-righteous jerk who does bad things for a living. What greater justification for love could there be? Soon the plot gets both thicker and thinner, a writing feat in itself. Halfway through the movie, every audience member with at least a grade school education has figured out who is the culprit behind the war. Never mind that. There are lots more explosions, big fights and other events to follow to keep the viewers awake, and thus, presumably entertained.<br />Jet Li is a Hong Kong kung fu movie star who can sometimes also act. Here he seems mostly confused, not by America, I suspect, but by the director. He is grand in the fight scenes, though assisted often by flying pulley wires plus a few graphics effects. There aren't enough of these fights because the movie spends too much time taking itself seriously. As Trish O'Day, beautiful supermodel Aaliyah is pert and attractive, but this is no movie by which to measure her assets as an actress. Some of the supporting actors, especially Anthony Anderson, hilariously funny as Maurice the bodyguard, rise above their stereotypical roles. First time director Andrzej Bartkowiak is a master cinemaphotographer, and he might be wise to return to working the cameras ASAP.<br />The trailer for Romeo Must Die was first rate and did much to sell the movie. In it, there were a lot of fast, intricate little cuts from the film. All were underscored by a short, powerful classical orchestral and choral piece, which is not in the movie at all. Interestingly, on the DVD version, the opening section where the DVD's menu choices are displayed is filled with fast, intricate little cuts and the same classical music. Some creative soul in the Warner Bros. DVD division must have been sending us a message.
6303998704|3.0|This film was very confusing. You would need to just watch it very hard and see where it is taking you. The first minute, the lady is somewhere then she wakes up and its a dream. I have not much to say about this thriller. I do love the black and white films alot, but I give this film only 3 because it didn't make too much sense the first time i watched it through. I bet if you watch it over and over again, you will understand. Although, some people dont like that kind of movie.
B00003CX8J|2.0|I must admit that after watching X-Men, I felt that I must be getting old. Normally, even when I don't relate to a movie, I understand how a certain age group or a certain segment of society could. I then try to review it with that part of the audience in mind. I knew in advance that X-men was wildly popular with many teenagers. It has already gained a sort of cult status. I tried to decide whether or not I would have been bowled over by it when I was seventeen. I decided I would not have been. So, while there is a constancy to the young, it stands to reason that each generation is somewhat unique as to what turns it on and what doesn't. I concluded that I might have been better of watching X-men with a group of kids. Then I might have had the answer. Or maybe I should have just ignored my parents' strict ban on comic books.<br />X-men is based on the wildly successful Marvel Comics series. The time is the near future. According to the story, we are in a period of evolutionary change. The result is a growing number of people who are mutations. These people have extraordinary powers, which can be used for good or for bad. Some members of Congress fear these mutants and want to pass a law forcing them to register with the government. The mutants have banded together into several groups. One major group is led by Professor X [Patrick Stewart]. He has founded a school to teach young mutants how to live with their powers. He believes coexistence with ordinary mortals is possible. The other major group, headed by Magneto [Ian McKellen], thinks that their survival can come only through annihilation of 'normal' people. Professor X's team [the X-men] must stop Magneto and his troops before they reek havoc on the rest of humanity.<br />There are many elements in this story that could have led to a great movie. It is full of colorful characters. Magneto has the power to magnetize metal, while Professor X can read minds. Wolverine is able to heal himself instantly after every battle. Cyclops is equipped with laser vision, Storm can morph into another body, and Raven literally has a touch that can kill. The special effects are all decent enough. One problem is that there is little character development. The characters react as though they have feelings, but these feelings seem superficial. There is little of the depth and angst that made Batman, which had a similar plot, so memorable. In that picture the hero was almost as dark and troubled as The Joker, the villain so wonderfully played by Jack Nicholson. At the same time, both characters had a wonderfully wicked sense of humor. X-Men's director, Bryan Singer, is one of the best, but he seems to have been unable to take characters from a cartoon book and make them anything but cartoon-like. Yet the movie also does not aspire to be a spoof or a satire. The great actors Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen could have had a field day with this material. Instead, they are required to play serious, and that seriousness may be the movie's biggest problem.
6300182193|4.0|Once I got over the shock of how like the magician David Copperfield this 70's Dracula looked, with his flowy white shirt, tight black pants, blowdried and hairsprayed hair, I actually enjoyed the movie.  Definitely made in the Hammer genre -women in flowy white dresses, overacting in the van helsing role from Laurence Olivier, too much mist and plastic bats -all this adds to the atmosphere - but the biggest surprise was that Frank Langella in the title role brings a sensuous sexiness to his Dracula, never quite achieved by good old Christopher Lee
B00003CXDG|3.0|Mission: Impossible 2 is sleek, sexy and stylish. After you see, you might decided, as I did, that it really isn't that good of a movie, mainly because the plot isn't all that interesting. There are a lot of neat things in the film which almost but not quite overcome the weak story. <br />Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt, spy extraordinaire for a shadowy international organization. A rock climbing vacation is cut short when his boss, Swanbeck [Anthony Hopkins] summons him. A renegade ex-agent, Sean Ambrose [Dougray Scott] has kidnapped a doctor off a commercial flight from Australia to Atlanta and in the process has caused the plane to crash. It takes awhile for Hunt to figure out what the doctor had that was so valuable. When he does, he finds that millions of lives may be at risk. At Swanbeck's insistence, Hunt recruits a beautiful thief named Nyah {Thandie Newton] to help him. It is not until after they have fallen for each other that Hunt learns the true reason Swanbeck wanted her. She is Ambose's ex-girlfriend. Swanbeck intends to use her to infiltrate Ambrose's house. This is a situation that Hunt is not at all happy with.<br />Cruise plays Hunt differently than he did in the first Mission: Impossible. He is cocky and sure of himself this time, and I think this works better. He is required at times to get into situations no mere mortal would live through, but consider the title. His scenes with Newton sizzle. You can almost feel the chemistry. Ms. Newton gives her role her best shot. She is required to go from independent and spirited to being your basic damsel in distress. Dougray Scott is quite convincing as the nefarious Ambrose. Anthony Hopkins has only two scenes as Swanbeck, but, as usual, he makes the most of them.<br />Director John Woo should be credited for giving Mission: Impossible 2 a look and feel it probably doesn't deserve. Such visual beauty is most often reserved for more thoughtful fare. The shots of Hunt climbing a rock face in the desert are awesome. The movie's many explosions are well executed. The shootouts are highly stylized and have the look of a well choreographed dance. If the story had been as ingenious as the photography, this would have been a classic.
B00004RFCM|5.0|Not having HBO, I had only been able to see a few episodes when over at friends' places. I am so glad that I bought the first season so that I could get caught up on the lives of the 4 main characters! This is quite a trip into the lives of single women and how they think. <BR>The first season is a great intro into the second season which (believe it or not) is even better!
B00004TJTS|4.0|There are more movies for families and kids than there were a decade ago, but many of them are not very good. Not only do they teach us nothing, they are also limited in the entertainment department. That's one reason you should grab a video like My Dog Skip. It isn't a perfect movie, but it is perfectly delightful. It is also one adults can sit through without groaning. <br />It's 1943 in Yazoo City, Mississippi, and W.W.II is raging. Though the townsfolk face many sacrifices, life goes on apace. Nine year old Willie Morris [France Mount] is an only child who doesn't have friends because he is small for his age and bookish. The closest thing to a friend is next door neighbor Dink Jenkins [Luke Wilson], a star high school athlete. Willie idolizes him, but Dink is much older and will soon be inducted into the army. Jack and Ellen Morris [Kevin Bacon and Diane Lane] fret about how to help their son but disagree on a remedy. Ellen thinks they should get the boy a dog, but Jack, a stern, pensive man who lost a leg in a previous war, thinks Willie is too young. Ellen, a much more open and outgoing person, buys Willie a terrier puppy anyway. Jack protests but soon gives in, and Willie has his first true friend. <br />Skip is one of the rare dogs that everyone in town everyone falls for, except for the bootleggers that operate out of the town cemetery. The dog's being so well liked gives Willie more and more confidence. Soon Skip is trotting all over town [Ah! The days before leash laws!] He scampers right into the grocery store to get his daily bologna fix. America, of course, was still segregated in 1943. This doesn't stop Skip from making friends in the 'colored section.' As Willie puts is, dogs are smarter than people because they are color blind. This is a dog that goes with Willie to the movies, has his own seat and shares the popcorn. This is a mutt that literally fixes the kid up with his first childhood sweetheart. While fiercely loyal to his master, Skip wisely lets him fight his own battles. By doing this, he helps Willie become fast friends with the neighborhood gang of boys. <br />This picture is not all sweetness and light. There are a couple of scary scenes, and a few that will bring out the Kleenex, if for no other reason than that Skip is the kind of dog most of us wish we could have had as a kid. <br />My Dog Skip is based on the nonfiction book of the same name by Willie Morris. Skip really was his dog, and this fact makes the movie even more poignant. Mr. Morris died shortly before the film's release.
B00005LC4B|5.0|I just watched this movie for the first time in a number of years and I'd forgotten how truly great it is.  I'd been waiting for the DVD to come out.  Cape Fear is a movie that needs to be seen in letterbox.  In the documentary, Scorsese says it was the first time he filmed anamorphic because he'd hoped that widescreen televisions would soon be coming out.<br />What makes the DVD great is the long \\"making-of\\" documentary on disc 2.  In it, Scorsese, all the actors, and the great screenwriter Wesley Strick go into great detail of every facet of the film and how the project evolved over the years (including the notorious \\"thumb-sucking\\" scene).  I've read the book \\"The Executioners\\" upon which the movie is based, and I'm familiar with the original Peck/Mitchum version and I have to say that this film is the best of the three.   Don't get me wrong - the original Cape Fear is a great movie and this version couldn't exist without it.   However, this film is exponentially more complex and disturbing.  The original story was a straightforward Good Guy/Bad Guy conflict.  Nowhere was there a villain like the tattooed, Bible-quoting, Henry Miller-reading Max Cady as portrayed by DeNiro.  Another especially inspired touch was to retain Bernard Herman's original score.  <br />Whereas a zillion \\"psychological thrillers\\" have come and gone since Cape Fear came out, they have been forgotten and this remains a classic.
0780631684|4.0|There is a huge pile of movies that makes up the ones aimed at teen audiences. Mainly, it is a junk pile. Let's face it. The teen market is self-limiting for two reasons. One is that by the age of 16 or 17, one's life experience is limited, which makes it pointless to pursue a lot of subjects. This greatly reduces the number of stories that can be told. The other reason is a sad one. Because people between the ages of 14 and 24 now have such an enormous amount of money to spend, they are approached as if they were a vast a herd of sheep to be shorn by vast corporate entities. Since these giant companies are not by nature experimental or innovative, the products tend to imitate each others, and movies are no exception. They seem to get away with this simply because a new croup of young victims comes along every two or three years. Occasionally, a movie aimed at teens is much better made than its rivals, probably because some production boss wisely loosened the reigns a bit. Final Destination is one of these movies. <br />The story is not anymore realistic than most Doomed Teenagers movies. It suffers from a problem many writers have. They come up with a great and often original premise which they are not either clever enough or imaginative enough to build upon to an equally innovative conclusion. So, the climax of Final Destination is lame. But, boy! What a wild ride it is up until that ending! <br />A group of high school students is about to fly to Paris for their senior trip. As the movie opens, we see them arrive full of energy and excitement at a New York City airport. Aboard the plane, all seems fine until something odd happens to Alex Browning [Devon Sawa]. We share with him a truly horrific experience in which he sees the plane start coming apart in midair. It turns out that he has fallen asleep and dreamed it all. When he wakes up and sees thing occur that he saw in the dream's beginning, he demands to be let off the plane. In the ensuing chaos, several students and two teachers are escorted off. One teacher is allowed to return so he can chaparone the rest of the students. The others are forced to stay behind. They are naturally furious with Alex, but can only watch helplessly at the plane takes off. Then, suddenly, it explodes just after takeoff. No one abroad survives.<br />Later, Alex faces all sorts of problems. The FBI is watching him day and night because, as yet, the cause of the explosion is not know. His peers think he is dangerous and very strange and want nothing to do with him. Along with the others who missed the flight, he is racked with guilt. These are just the start of his woes. He knows something is very wrong about the whole experience. Why did he have the vision? Why does he feel an unearthly presence around him? Why is he so worried about himself and the other survivors? He comes to believe that this little group somehow cheated death and that each of their numbers will soon be up. It isn't long before he is proved right. <br />From Alex's first vision up to that all too predictable ending, the terror and suspense never let up. Director James Wong wisely keeps the pace of the movie fast and furious, so that the audience has no time for a reality check. He gives us no breathers, so we have no chance to think about how silly this all is and then to start laughing at the characters. Anyone who's attention might be wandering will be instantly brought back by the bus scene, which may be the most shocking and surprising five=second scene in all of 2000. Wong's efforts result in a triumph of style over substance. Isn't this often what good movie making is all about?<br />The cast is sharp and attractive. Devon Sawa's Alex must go from well adjusted kid to one who is on the brink of going mad. He makes the character believable. Ali Lartner makes Clear Rivers, the only student who believes in Alex, seem both beautiful and haunted. As Carter, Kerr Smith has a fine time as the hotheaded hunk who'd rather lethis fists do the talking. The director is an executive producer on The X Files, and I suspect he will become an icon of the thriller genre in the next few years.

B00003CXHJ|4.0|Sometimes a movie is able to rise above it's trite and oft told storyline. The one used for U-571, which is about submarine warfare in W.W.II, can be summed up as follows: sub meets sub, sub loses sub, sub gets sub. Fortunately, in the hands of director Jonathan Mostow and his crew, U-571 has been crafted into a tight little thriller which should have most viewers on the edge of their seats. I should add that it is not recommended for anyone who is more than mildly claustrophobic. <br />The story is a blend of several true events, although in real life, most of the heroes were British, not American. German submarines were equipped with a radio device called Enigma, which was able to transmit coded information that only the Germans could translate. Without the device itself, the Allied Forces had a very hard time of tracking the U-boats. These were devastatingly effective in sinking our ships. <br />A fancy wedding reception for an American Naval officer is interrupted by military police bearing the news that leave has been cut short for the men of one sub. Navy brass has learned that a German U-boat has been disabled in the Atlantic and is awaiting a repair sub. The plan is simple. The Americans will use a sub outfitted to look like a Nazi one. They will attempt to reach the German sub before the Nazi rescue vessel does. They will then board the enemy vessel and seize the Enigma. After taking the Germans prisoner, they will sink their U-boat. The Germans will then have no way of knowing that the device has been captured. Like most simple plans, this one quickly gets very complicated. It also gets extremely dangerous. <br />Jonathan Mostow uses some effective tricks to make U-571 rise above its script. From the opening shots, which show how the German ship was crippled in battle, he manages to keep the movie's tension level very high. The American sub is an old one. It creaks constantly. There is water always dripping from its old pipe joints. These effects work well, because they convince us landlubbers that this thing would be unsafe to be in during peacetime, much less during a war. So, we have already been set up before the first enemy torpedo races towards our heroes, trapped as they are in this unnatural craft. Later, there are the depth charges. The crew can't see them, but they can hear them. They get louder and louder as a Nazi destroyer gets closer and closer. It all turns into a suspenseful game of cat and mouse, and the tension level is raised even higher as everything about the mission goes dreadfully wrong halfway through the movie. . <br />While this film is filled with great actors, there is not much to be said for this cast, simply because the characters are subordinate to the special effects. This is appropriate for this kind of movie, where too much character development tends to get in the way of the action. If you think about it, a thriller, by its very nature, doesn't work if there are lulls in the story. In U-571, there are hardly any.
B000053V7Q|5.0|I will keep this brief and to the point.  This is the best concert footage of Elvis available!  If you like the &quot;Vegas years&quot; (as I do) then this will blow your socks off!  Much better than the original version than had so much stupid stuff in it and less concert footage (instead of seeing Elvis on stage, the original would show you the cooks preparing the food!).  This is the way it should have been! Buy it!!
B00003CX6P|5.0|I really liked The Talented Mr. Ripley, but it is only right to mention that opinions on it has been greatly divided. I thought it was one of the best movies of 1999, and the year's best thriller. The movie is as sleek as a panther and as polished as marble. Perhaps it is it's odd combination of the cold and calculating versus the warm and loving that puts some viewers off, because they are not given a paint by numbers picture of where to place their emotions. <br />Tom Ripley [Matt Damon] is a very bright young man. He is quite ambitious but has no money to make his dreams happen. One day he is hired to play piano at a posh New York wedding reception. A wealthy guest, Herbert Greenleaf [James Rebborn], is taken by Tom's charming manner and by the fact that Tom is wearing a Princeton blazer. Herbert incorrectly assumes Tom went to college there. In fact, the blazer is borrowed, but clever Tom plays along. Herbert soon offers him $1,000 to go to Italy to try to convince his playboy son, Dickie [Jude Law] to come home. Dickie did go to Princeton. Tom accepts. That was a large sum of money in 1958, the year the movie takes place. <br />As he gets off the boat in Italy, he meets Merideth Logue [Cate Blanchette], a wealthy, amiable American heiress with no particular ambitions, except, I assume, to marry. Since the rich stick together, especially in 1958, she is attracted to Tom, in part because she thinks is rich Dickie Greenleaf. She will play a pivotal role later in the picture. A few days later, Tom spots Dickie on the beach with the beautiful Marge Sherwood [Gwyneth Paltrow], his fiance. When he introduces himself, he says they were together at Princeton. Dickie, of course, doesn't recognize him. Tom certainly wasn't in Dickie's wealthy clique, but it's a big school. Soon Tom is very much a part of the couple's lives. Though Dickie always is suspicious of Tom's origins, he thinks he is a lot of fun. Tom let's slip the fact that he shares Dickie's passion for jazz, and they become fast friends. In truth, Tom, who likes classical music, boned up on jazz before he left New York. Dickie becomes more than just a friend to Tom, who is gay or at least bisexual. The first time I saw the movie, I assumed Dickie was, too, because of his mannerisms. The second time I came to believe he was much too pretty boy with a touch of narcissism who liked women. Still, all the guessing is part of the charming enigmatic quality of the film. I don't want to spoil the plot. I will say that when old classmate, Freddie Miles [Philip Seymour Hoffman] arrives, there's trouble brewing. The prissy, snobbish Freddie is not only suspicious of Tom, he doesn't like him at all. And when Tom's charm and good looks don't work, what is he to do?<br />You have to say, \\"What a cast!\\" The four leads are collectively perhaps the most honored young actors today. Damon, along with Ben Affleck, won the best screenplay Oscar for Good Will Hunting in 1998. Paltrow won Best Actress for Shakespeare in Love last year, while Blanchette at the same time was nominated for Elizabeth and should have won. Law got a Best Supporting Actor nomination for The Talented Mr. Ripley. The movie got six nominations, including one for director Anthony Minghella, who won in 1997 for The Talented Mr. Ripley.<br />Some of the criticism of the movie is understandable. Understatement is out of fashion in films today, and ambiguity is not tolerated. Tom Ripley's personality is deliberately ambiguous. Patricia Highsmith, who authored the book the movie is based on, wrote him that way fifty years ago. The film adds characters, and in the book, Marge isn't Dickie's fiance. She's just a friend who feels far more for him than he does for her. Still, in this case, the movie becomes great in its own right. Because most of it takes place in the tourist areas of Italy, some viewers forget that it's taking place forty years ago. They think the characters actions are odd, but I can assure you that they are authentic for that time period. It's too slow, almost cumbersome for some people. I didn't find it that way at all, but this is a matter of personal taste. Some felt the ending, which is different from the book, was vague. In real life, Highsmith went on to write several more Tom Ripley adventures, and the movie remains faithful to the author's aims. Finally, some viewers don't seem to understand Tom's motive. I can assure you that it's in the movie, but it's just one line near the end. \\"I always thought it was better to be a fake somebody than a real nobody.\\" To me, for certain ambitious types, that's all the motive that's needed.
6300184269|5.0|One of the most perfect movies ever made, although with a stunning cast, directed by the masterful John Hughes, it's hard to go wrong.<br />While you could see the divine Kelly Le Brock's character Lisa as a portrayal of the boys' collective Anima, which empowers them in areas in which they were previously inept, e.g. relating to women, she's also rather easy on the eye. This is Babeage off the scale as we know it. Endowed with Einsteinian intelligence, magical powers (L'Isa = Isis) and a bod that just won't quit, Lisa creates scenarios in which the boys can eventually overcome their fears and hangups and become the heroes that they always were.<br />Hughes also takes his trademark shot at the teaching profession (see also Ferris Bueller's Day Off) when one of the Mutant Bikers asks the boys not to blab about his trash-the-house conduct, as it might cost him his teaching job.<br />It's hilarious, it's sexy, it's one long highly imaginative thrill ride that you simply must not miss. The shower scene? Why, I hadn't even noticed...
B000059Z8M|4.0|There is much to like about Toy Story 2. In fact, the only thing I dislike about the movie is its built-in commercial element, which I will discuss later. <br />The story continues the adventures of Buzz Lightyear, Woody and their friends, all of whom are toys which come to life when people aren't around. It's the perfect child's fantasy. Buzz is an astronaut, and Woody is a cowboy. When the kid they belong to goes off to camp, his mother decides to have a yard sale. Looking in the boy's room, she finds a toy penguin whose 'voice' no longer works. She puts it in the sale, much to the horror of the other toys. Soon, Woody, aided by the family dog, is off to the rescue. He is spied by a ruthless toy store owner who realizes Woody is a highly prized collectible and is worth a great deal of money. The man promptly steals him, and now it is Woody who must be rescued by the other toys. <br />The story is charming, but the magic is in the animation. This is Disney's third collaboration with Pixar Studios, which mainly uses state of the art computers and skilled technicians to create and animate its characters. In this case, we see the computer at its finest. Animation has been taken to the next level. The colors, the delineation and the attention to detail are all marvels to behold. This marriage of the computer generated and the hand drawn is nearly perfect. I imagine Walt himself would have approved.<br />The commercial drawback I mentioned is due more to modern marketing than to the movie itself. We are all painfully familiar with promotional tie-ins, all the toy sales that are generated by this type of movie. In this case, everything is almost too perfectly in place for Disney. The items created from the two Toy Story movies are literally toys based on toys. This makes it all seem a bit too calcualated on the company's part. Today, the price of a child's ticket to an animated movie is often but a small fraction of the money you wind up paying. It's all gravy for Disneyand for the kids, but it makes some of us adults feel a bit used. I wonder if the real toys inspired by these movies wind up being as beloved as the ones in the movie are. Somehow I doubt it.

6305903182|3.0|If Scream 3 ends the highly successful horror trilogy on a low note, we should remember that the first two installments were classics of the genre. The final installment shows that even the cleverest ideas run out of steam eventually.<br />As always, several thing are going on at once. Cotton Weary [Liev Schreiber], exonerated as the killer in a past episode, has become a hot syndicated TV talk show host. Driving home in Los Angeles one night, he gets a phone call from the real killer. He races home to save his girlfriend. Sidney Prescott [Neve Campbell] has vanished to a remote area of northern California where, safely locked away in a secure ranch, she works as an over-the-phone crisis counselor. Naturally, this is one mad man she can't escape. In Hollywood, a studio is making Stab 3, a movie about the killings covered in Scream and Scream 3. Dewey [David Arquette] is technical advisor on the picture. Gale Weathers [Courtney Cox Arquette] is a highly paid and sensationalistic TV journalist. When Cotton has a fatal encounter while trying to save his girlfriend, Gale is called in by the LAPD as a consultant. That's how she runs into Dewey on the movie set. After a couple of the cast members are done in, the pair realizes that the serial killer is working in the order in which the characters the actors are playing were killed. <br />The problem with the picture is that director Wes Craven really has run out of ideas. It is almost as if he simply filled a prior commitment. The satire and the humor that made the first two movies so good is almost absent here, which makes this one basically a competent but ordinary horror movie. There are some spooky scenes, such as one in which Sidney is chased by the killer through the Stab 3 set, which is an exact replica of her own house where much of the original movies took place.<br />The actors give good performances, especially Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox Arquette, although they, too, have an air of doing this movie becausetheir contracts said they would. <br />As a vehicle for horror fans, Scream 3 is as diverting and entertaining as most such pictures. The problem comes in comparing it to its predecessors.

B00004U8H4|4.0|American Psycho is the long delayed film version of the novel by Bret Easton Ellis. When it was published nearly ten years ago, it was met with a storm of controversy. Its quite graphic violence caused critics to overlook the book's central theme, which is that a society awash in materialism will lose its collective soul. As the main character puts it, \\"The only true emotions I feel are disgust and greed.\\" Originally, Oliver Stone wanted to film it using Leonardo DiCaprio as the protagonist, Patrick Bateman. I can see Leo D. in the part, but I imagine Stone would have made a very violent and very loud mess of it. Finally, the project was placed in the hands of director Mary Harron, and she wisely chose to emphasis the book's satirical and comedic elements over its violence. The result is a movie that is about as good a filming of the novel as one could hope for. Whether or not it is also entertainment depends on each viewer's tastes. <br />Christian Bale gives the performance of his life as Patrick Bateman. Patrick is a young man who is the epitome of a soulless success. Wickedly bright and utterly ruthless, he makes big bucks working at a high powered finanical concern in New York. He works out religiously. He is fanatical about his appearance, and his morning routine of getting himself cleaned up, made up and dressed for work would put any movie star to shame. His wardrobe is impeccable. His haircut is perfect. Even his business cards are designed to be the best. Any coworker who dresses better or looks better than Patrick is considered to be competition and, thus, one of the enemy. His carefully contrived personal appearance goes far beyond the masks we knew in the past. It is more of a tool than his words or his actions. It is also a trap and a weapon. Yet most of the people Patrick knows seem to be using the same weapon, while Patrick is the only one who knows that behind the facade there is usually only emptiness. In this pursuit of meaningless physical and material perfection, he has also gone stark raving mad. He finally snaps. One evening he takes Paul Allen [Jared Leto], his fiercest competitor, out to dinner and then to his apartment, where he coldly and calculatedly kills him with an ax. When the police question him about the missing Allen, he coolly throws them off the track. At the same time, as his madness takes complete control, he goes on a murderous rampage. <br />American Psycho is not a slasher flick nor is a thriller. It is a satirical black comedy that makes a valid attempt to show the ultimate futility of a relatively small but influential segment of American society. It does not always succeed, especially towards the end, because the violence ultimately becomes too numbing. This fact does not prevent it from being one of 2000's more original movies, and it does nothing to overshadow the enormous talents of its star and its director.
0525946284|5.0|Luckily I read this book when I didn't have to go to work or do anything else.  Once I got started, I could not put it down.  I kept telling myself, &quot;I'll read the next few pages, then I'll  A: make dinner, B: feed the dogs C: you name it.&quot;  I didn't do A: B: or C: until I finished the book.<br />Sure it is pretty unbelievable, but it is a novel.  And during war time, people do some pretty unbelievable things.  <br />I've recommened this to everyone I know who likes to read, and to some who don't.
B00003CWTI|5.0|With the sprawling and ambitious Magnolia, writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson establishes himself as one of the most gifted film makers of his generation. Over three hours long, the movie will prove too much for some viewers, but I found this look at a day in the lives of some San Fernando Valley residents to be fascinating. Some of the characters' lives are interconnected to other characters, while others are connected in only coincidental ways. The movie spends a lot of time dealing with the differences between coincidence and fate. <br />Jim [John C. Reilly] is a cop who earnestly tries to do good. He is desperate to be loved, and when he meets Rose Gator [Melinda Dillon] during a domestic disturbance call, he is seemingly oblivious to her problems, which include drug addiction and a lot of mental conflicts. Rose hates her father Jimmy [Philip Baker Hall] with a passion bordering on the homicidal. Jimmy is the host of the longest running game show in TV history. He has recently been told he has two months to live and is trying to right some of the wrongs he has done to his wife and daughter. The show is called What Do Kids Know? and it pits three kids against three adults. The current child contestants are close to setting a money record, led by Stanley [Jeremy Blackman], an eleven year old who is miserable because he knows he is nothing but a freak to the audience and a meal ticket to his father. Across town, Donnie [William H. Macy], who was a champ on the show thirty years ago, is trying to make some sense of his life, which has gone downhill ever since his short experience with fame. The show's producer, Earl Partridge [Jason Robards], is also dying in his luxurious home, tended to by a wonderfully altruistic nurse, Phil [Philip Seymour Hoffman], who will do anything to grant the man's dying wish, which is to see his estranged son, Frank [Tom Cruise]. Frank long ago changed his name and has become wealthy by creating a very odd self-help program, which claims to give men control over women...  <br />Magnolia was passed over at the Oscars this year, though there are a number of award winning performances. Of particular note are those of Julianne Moore and Tom Cruise. I never thought I'd be saying this, by Cruise really should have won Best Supporting Actor.<br />Much has been made of the movie's startling and unconventional ending. I thought it was perfect, though many people disagree. I will note that there are clues all though the film that tell you that the event depicted will probably occur.
B00005UEAR|5.0|Wow! This is an absolutely fantastic release! Dream Theater has done something new and fresh, yet maintained the sound and feeling that has made them the leading Progressive Rock band in the world. I just witnessed them live in SF, and I can tell you they have no problem capturing the same vibe live as they do in the studio, yet remaining true to the great tunes that have acquired them such a large following. With many of these great Progressive rock bands hailing from Europe, it's great to see that the best of them all is from America, and that this release is doing so well. Each time I think these guys have hit their prime - they raise the bar. This is an instant classic, right there with The Wall, Physical Graffiti, and 2112. Also, check out Vanden Plas, Enchant and Symphony X.
B00003CXFV|5.0|It is often hard for a movie about a landmark legal battle to capture the public's interest, especially if it is based on a true story. Examples include A Civil Action in 1998 and The Insider in 1999. Despite much critical praise, these movies were apparently perceived by audiences as being too dry. Such was not the fate of Erin Brockovich, which became the first smash hit of 2000. Perhaps having Julia Roberts as the title character fighting for justice helped make the difference. I know it didn't hurt. <br />The picture opens with Erin desperately looking for a job. She's twice divorced from no good husbands and has a child to support. After one interview, she is injured in a car wreck when another driver runs a red light. She decides to sue the other person, not because she is greedy, but because she needs to be compensated for her medical expenses. She turns to a lawyer named Ed Masry [Albert Finney], a very busy man who virtually assures her that she will win. Ed does not factor in Erin's flashy, almost trashy taste in clothing or her tendency to spew out four letter words when she is angered. Her appearance on the witness stand is a disaster, and they lose the case, which brings forth a tirade on the lawyer from Erin. Meanwhile, she meets a decent guy who winds up frightening her. She has had such rotten luck with men. In an ironic turn of events, she ends up working for Ed Masry. The other women in the office are pretty hostile, since Julia's style is hardly what we expect in a staid law office. Erin persists, and one day she discovers a case that has been on the office's back burner. It involves a group of people who live adjacent to one of Pacific Gas and Electric's plants. There is a probability that these people have been poisoned for years by chromium the company has allowed to seep into the local drinking water.<br />There are several things which make the movie work. Much of it concentrates on two very interesting characters, Erin and Ed, rather than onthe workings of the legal system itself. It also plots the progress of a remarkable woman. Erin starts off as an intelligent woman with vitally no marketable skills. Also lacking any skills at dealing with other people, she seems destined to be someone who works a lifetime just to eke out a living. For some inner reason, this legal case mesmerizes her. It requires her to learn a whole lot very fast and to put her personal life aside for a cause worth fighting for. In the process, we watch as a whole new woman emerges. Her progress is at least as interesting as the legal battle's. <br />Julia Roberts and the great British actor, Albert Finney, are splendid as Erin and Ed. The way they play off of each other reminds me of Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. There is no sex involved, but this is decidedly a battle of the sexes. She's too brash and outspoken for him, and he's too stuffy and cautious for her. It is a case of opposites attracting. As for the movie itself, it's a case of a job well done.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|After \\"Last exit to Brooklyn\\", as far as I know this is the second Hubert Selby's book brought into the screen.

0786100575|5.0|...I also strongly recommend that an interested reader try listening to the audio version of this novel.  If you think the prose of Austen dry, I assure you that you will find a good reading of it a revelation indeed.  Among the versions I recommend strongly are the version read by Irene Sutcliffe (Audio Partners/ Cover to Cover, or Chivers in the UK), and that by Kate Reading (Books on Tape, available from them).<br />I found the Reading version very good overall, and outstanding for the portrayal of Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Mrs Bennet.  The best scene, in my opinion, was that of Lady Catherine confronting Elizabeth in the garden at Longbourn.  However, I found Elizabeth less easy to distinguish in certain other scenes from her sister Jane, and the men done not as well as I would have hoped.  Mr Darcy was a disappointment, in that Kate Reading read his dialogue in a less stately manner than I had expected.  However, the reading of the novel was overall very good as I have said.  I noticed many little details and phrases that I had overlooked in many readings of this novel, and that I had also ignored in my stay at the Republic of Pemberley (a website dedicated to Austen).<br />I have not yet had the pleasure of listening to the Irene Sutcliffe version, but I plan to buy it very soon.  ...<br />If you are rushed for time, or spend a lot of time in your car (or listening to tapes), or if you want to experience Austen in a different light, do try either reading.
0875845851|5.0|Having just re-read this book, I admire it even more now than I did when it was first published. In his Introduction, Christensen makes his objective crystal clear: \\"This book is about the failure of companies to remain competitive when they confront certain types of market and technological change....the good companies -- the kinds that many managers have admired for years and tried to emulate, the companies known for their abilities to innovate and execute....It is about well-managed companies that have their competitive antennae up, listen astutely to their customers....invest aggressively in new technologies, and yet they still lose market dominance.\\" Why? For Christensen, the answer is revealed in what he calls \\"the innovator's dilemma\\": the logical, competent decisions of management which are critical to the success of their companies are also the reasons why they lose their positions of leadership.<br />In Part One, Chapters 1-4, Christensen builds a framework that explains why sound decisions by great managers can lead to failure. In Part Two, Chapters 5-10, he attempts to resolve the dilemma by examining why and under what circumstances new technologies have caused great firms to fail. He makes an important distinction between sustaining technologies and those which are disruptive. He offers four \\"laws or principles\\" of disruptive technology:<br />#1: Companies depend on customers and investors for resources (Chapter 5)<br />#2: Small markets don't solve the growth needs of large companies (Chapter 6)<br />#3: Markets that don't exist can't be analyzed (Chapter 7)<br />#4: Technology supply may not equal market demand (Chapter 8)<br />Actually, these four could also be viewed as guidelines as well as check-points by which to detect early-warning danger signs. Unless and until, however,  it becomes obvious that a given technology will create sustaining rather than only temporary disruption. One of the book's most important points seems to confirm what Pogo the Possum once said: \\"We have met the enemy and he is us.\\" Nearly all of the corporate wounds which Christensen examines are self-inflicted. If not in all instances avoidable, at least the damage done could at least have been reduced.<br />For example, Christensen examines companies in which (a) disruptive technologies were first developed internally, (b) marketing personnel then sought reactions from lead customers, (c) the pace of sustaining technological development was accelerated, (d) disaffected employees created new companies and (by trial and error) located markets for disruptive technology, (e) moved upmarket in direct competition, and (f) caused established firms to respond in defense of their own customer base. In essence, well-established companies (\\"incumbents\\") thus become threatened by \\"entrants\\" and a disruptive technology change. In response, they re-allocate resources away from those technologies which address their customers' needs.<br />When reading this book, note in particular Christensen's detailed analysis of a disruptive technological change in the mechanical excavator industry (Chapter Three) and the correlations between value networks and characteristic cost structures (Chapter Four). Once again, he reveals how and why sound management decisions can often be \\"at the very root of [a 'good' company's] impending fall from industry leadership.\\"<br />In Part Two, Christensen describes in detail HOW managers can address and harness four principles by which to prevail against disruptive technologies. Once again, he asserts that a company's customers effectively control what it can and cannot do. Managers who deny or ignore this do so at great peril. To support his assertion, Christensen examines several quite different companies: Quantum, Plus Development, Control Data, Micropolis, DEC, IBM, Kresge, Woolworth, and Hewlett-Packard. In some of these companies, the innovating managers who were faced with disruptive technologies created organizationswhose cost structures enabled them to make money in the value network where the disruptive technology was taking root, and where customers' power and the managers' intentions were aligned. The emphasis is on alignment. In Chapter Six, Christensen insists that managers must be leaders, not followers, in commercializing disruptive change. Hence the importance of a strategic decision: To be a leader or a follower? It is often prudent for \\"incumbents\\" to be followers, resisting pressure from customers, until opportunities to commercialize disruptive technologies are sufficient and appropriate. As Christensen suggests, \\"In sustaining technologies, in fact, evidence strongly suggests that companies which focus on extending the performance of conventional technologies, and choose to be followers in adopting new ones, can remain strong and competitive.\\"<br />Chapter Ten summarizes various key points. By now Christensen has offered dozens of examples of \\"some very capable executives in some extraordinarily successful companies, using the best managerial techniques, who have led their firms toward failure.\\" Lest this brief commentary suggest otherwise, managers in every organization (regardless of size or nature) eventually must resolve \\"the innovator's dilemma.\\" Christensen's book provides invaluable assistance to completing that immensely difficult process. It remains for each of his readers to answer questions such as these: Which customers do we want? Which technologies will help us to get and then keep them? For each technology, which strategies will be most effective to sustain it? Should we attack competitors with disruptive technology? How can we best defend ourselves against it? How should our resources be allocated? What about timing? Should we lead or follow? If we follow, should we prepare to lead later?<br />Finding the correct (i.e. most appropriate) answers to questions such as these will obviously help to clarify today's realities and to suggest strategies for an uncertain future. But beware of taking anyone or anything for granted. As Christensen explains so eloquently and compellingly, the process of resolving one major dilemma may well reveal others.

B00005QZWI|5.0|After seeing the most fantastic film I've ever seen this is an excellent cd and i don't like classical at all, but the voice of enya is the voice of god voice or you can say it's just beautiful. it will be hard to find a more beautiful voice than enya. you can forget britney, mariah, j-lo, or any of them. enya beats them, no question asked.
B00005QZWI|5.0|Unlike some of the prior reviews that I have read, I thought the music was not &quot;a Troll-sized Disappointment&quot; but very well done. I have seen the movie 3 times, and a lot of the music in the movie showed up on the CD. Granted, they couldn't put three hours of music onto a CD (they could, but I doubt it would meet customer satisfaction), and had to cut it down some. One thing I noticed is that you could figure out the exact moment in the scene when listening to the music. It's very distinct and I would (and have) reccommended it to many people.
B00005RDSM|3.0|Did I miss something in watching this version? I seem to recall that when Tinker Bell's light is fading the audience is asked to repeat that &quot;I believe in fairies&quot; or something to that effect. However, in this version, that portion has been edited out. Peter locates Tinker Bell as her light is fading and we know she is seriously injured and then it simply cuts to the pirate ship and then Peter and Tinker show up just fine with no explanation of how she survived. What gives? Political correctness of an anti-belief in fairy type?
078322933X|4.0|Fear is an interesting twist on the typical teen love story.  Boy meets girl, girl falls in love with boy, girl finds out that boy is crazy for her.  Literally...crazy...for her.  Reese Witherspoon plays sweet teen girl Nicole Walker who falls for handsome and intensely romantic David McCall played by former rapper Mark Wahlberg.  At first David seems to be every bit a perfect boyfriend, handsome, considerate, and intensely sexy.  Things turn ugly when David explodes into a jealous rage when he sees Nicole giving a friendly hug to a male friend.  From there, Fear turns into a frightening story of obsession and violence.  Reese does a very credible job of playing the teen girl trapped by a romantic psychotic.  Mark Wahlburg does a great job of combining the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde sides of David's character.  Fans of Walhburg will enjoy the sight of Mark flexing both his acting and pectoral muscles.  Balancing the mix is Nicole's slightly overprotective father played by James Foley who sees through David's perfect gentleman act and becomes a target for David's increasingly maniacal acts.  Despite being classified as \\"teen horror\\", Fear is surprisingly good.  No Oscar performances to be sure, but overall it's an engaging suspense story with well-done performances.
B00005QZWI|3.0|Well, I collect soundtracks, and classical music is my main area of expertise.  The \\"Lord\\" had potential in both areas, but left me expecting more.  Maybe I'm jaded, but I  really like Bruckner's overblown symphonic works which often provide more sonic satisfaction.  But for \\"The Lord...\\" The score is so massive that one has to play it on equipment that can easily handle the nuances.  It is expansive, and overblown.  Are all the tracks overdupped and enhanced?  The choral sequences sounded as though the Mormon Tabernacle Choir had met the Festival Singers of Wales in the Grand Canyon. Of course, there were some powerful moments, and tender ones, too, but over all, I was left saying, \\"So...?\\". And where was Enya?  A big, juicy sticker on my copy proclaimed that this was another hit for Enya!  I had been  reviewing other soundtracks  for  publications (\\"Harry Potter\\", for one), and I thought that one was much more interesting, and a stand-alone disc.  So, off to see \\"The Lord...\\", for another shot.  Maybe I will enjoy it more. Maybe I had an off-day. This may be one I'll put in the resale bin....Madge Bruner Hazen
B00003CXI1|3.0|I'm a Harry Potter fan and I really, really, really tried to like this movie, but I couldn't.  Perhaps I would have liked it more if I hadn't read the books beforehand.  For those who don't know the story, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is about an 11 year old orphan boy named Harry Potter whose parents die in a car crash (or so he's led to believe) and goes to live with his aunt, uncle and cousin when he's only a year old.  Of course Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon treats Harry horribly in favor of their own spoiled and greedy child, Dudley.  Harry seems resigned to live this terrible life until one day on his 11th birthday a mysterious letter from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft andWizardry appears.  Soon after Harry learns the truth about his past, that his parents were wizards and that they really died at the hands of the evil wizard Voldemort (mostly known among the wizard world as You-Know-Who). That he is famous in the wizarding world because he is the only one known to survive an attack from the evil Voldemort with only a lighting shaped scar on his forehead to show for it.  Soon Harry is off to the magical world of witches and wizards, destined to learn to be a wizard at the famous Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br />The movie actually followed the book pretty closely, which may or may not have been part of the problem.  However, there were some parts that were cut that should have been left in mainly because it aided in the development of some of the characters. For the most part, the actors where cast well, Daniel Radcliffe did well as young Harry Potter, Rupert Grint was hilarious as Harry's best friend Ron Weasley,  Emma Watson was excellent as bossy Hermione Granger, and Robbie Coltrane was every bit the Hagrid of the Harry Potter books.  Other supporting actors were also excellently cast with Alan Rickman as the imposing Potions master Snape, Maggie Smith as the strict and stern Professor McGonagall, and Richard Harris as the wiseschool headmaster Professor Dumbledore.  Strangely enough, the trio portraying the Dursleys, Harry's mean relatives, seemed oddly miscast.  For example, in the book, Aunt Petunia was a blond and in the movie she was a brunette, which would be a minor point if the other characters weren't cast as well as they were. <br />The most exciting and visually stunning part of the movie was during the fast paced Quidditch match, a wizarding game played on broomsticks. But all in all, the movie appeared be to rather slow, especially for children who haven't read the book or for those with fairly short attention spans.  It also seemed to be missing...something...the something that makes reading the books so magical.  It could be because the plot lines and character development in the Harry Potter books are too rich and well written to make an effective translation to the screen.  The scenes that read as witty, quick paced and funny in the book appeared to fall flat and drag on the screen.  I'm hard pressed to decide whether I'll buy the movie or just stick to the books.

B00003XACV|5.0|My favorite soundtrack composer used to be Michael Nyman (who composed soundtracks for Gattaca and The Piano) until I saw American Beauty.  The story and cinematography of the movie were stunning enough, but the soundtrack tied it all together in one beautiful package.  Thomas Newman's music on this CD is playful (Track 6- Mr. Smarty-Man), dark (Track 12- Structure and Discipline), forlorn (Track 14- Angela Undress), longing (Track 16- Walk Home), quirky (Track 13- Spartanette), dreamy (Track 2- Arose) all at the same time.  The use of alternative instruments like the ukulele and bird calls made for a highly inventive, sometimes quirky, but totally appropriate background for the movie.  Nothing was too loud or too overpowering.  And the music of the soundtrack is also strong enough to stand on it's own, you don't have to have seen the movie for the music to make sense to you.  Sometimes, I wish the tracks were longer, especially Track 2- Arose which is my favorite, but it's long enough.  After hearing this soundtrack, I've started identifying Thomas Newman's unique sound in other soundtracks like Little Women (another wonderful soundtrack), the Green Mile, the TV show Boston Public, and HBO's Six Feet Under.  If you love soundtracks, definitely give this one a listen!
B00005JL9B|3.0|I am a big fan of Japanese film and was eiger to see this title.  Just the premise of 42 9th grade juvenile delinquents set loose on a deserted island with the objective of killing each other to win their own lives was intriguing.  It was very violent but not as bad as I expected.  It was no more violent than the director's cut of Robocop.  Still, a bunch of kids in school uniforms going on a murderous rampage was kind of unsettling.  It's not a wonder why it was pulled from Japanese theatres.  I don't think this will ever make it to US theatres without an NC-17 rating.<BR>There is a current of dark humor running through the film and it is for this that I give the movie 3 stars.  It also seems to be a parody of the currently popular reality TV shows.  Although I have mixed feelings about it, I'm glad I saw it.
0066620996|3.0|Classic academic approach, which yielded a variety of not-so surprising results.  Thankfully, Collins takes many opportunities to lambast corporate over-indulgence and egotistical &quot;leaders&quot;.  The piece of Level 5 leadership is fantastic and actionable.  Anyone surprised by these revelations; however, needs a stronger grounding in reality.  <br />My strongest gripe with the book is Collins' pervasive, self-serving narrative.  Too much effort is spent justifying (and promoting) his scientific analysis process.  Every other page describes &quot;debates among the team, that went on for weeks&quot; with regards to the data.  He also falls into the trap of most academics - trying to create the next buzzword - going to the extent of providing Webster-style pronounciation clues for his self-proclaimed acronyms (BHAGs).  The book is fraught with catchy, yet silly lexicon:  The Hedgehog Concept (also known as focus), Rinsing your Cottage Cheese (also known as details), blah blah blah.
B00005QDW1|1.0|You know what? I don't usually whine about bands selling out. I don't feel it's right most of the time. But this is just pitiful.<br />I admit, I used to be a huge fan of No Doubt. I still think most of their other material is some of the best ska-punk of the 90s. Tragic Kingdom and their self-titled are some of the best ska-punk CD's out there. Return to Saturn, although it had some negative signs of turning pop, it still had some awesome songs, like &quot;New&quot;. I then saw Gwen Stefani do a cameo with Eve on her song, and that's when I started worrying. It kind of made me mad. THEN...the first single, &quot;Hey Baby&quot;. The most annoying, stupid song I have ever heard. But, hey...I'm open-minded, so I got the CD, expecting that the first single was just to get attention from the media. BUT...the rest of the CD was just as annoying and bad.<br />So, my point is, after being as open-minded as anyone in the world could be, I STILL call it sell-out material. Sorry No Doubters.
B00005ASOI|4.0|I really feel that most of the horror movies out there are garbage. Modern horror, in particular, is so formulaic (slapstick comedy mixed with gore) and predictable it is amazing they even draw an audience. As a genre it has a ton of potential and some of my favorite films fall into this category: Jaws, The Shining, Alien, The Vanishing (Spoorloos), etc. However, for every good horror film there are a 100 mediocre to awful films that shouldn't have even been made. What is lacking in these films is the cerebral and atmospheric elements that are the essence of fear. I guess this is what attracted me to \\"Suspiria.\\" I always heard a lot about this film and Argento's reputation. It sounded like something that I would like, but Argento's notoriety for gore put me off seeing it. If used appropriately gore doesn't bother me, but I am no way a \\"gore fiend.\\" I assumed that \\"Suspiria\\" would just be the gratuitous gore-fest that ruins so many titles in the horror genre. But itching for something different and creepy I finally bit the bullet and watched it. I must say I was very pleased. The plot is very loose. I've read that many people think the plot is non-existent, but I think the plot is pretty clear (pay attention to the last scene and then rewatch the beginning). Though it is not super intricate, it is satisfying. But where \\"Suspiria\\" is really effective is in its imagery and use of sound. It is extremely atmospheric and hallucinatory; almost like a dream. There are many scenes where the girls are simply walking down the hallways, and every time it is creepy as hell. The use of light and primary colors are particularly effective. As far as the gore goes, yes there are a few very discomforting scenes. However, by today's standards they are pretty tame. In fact, I would say that the 'X-files' have more graphic scenes then what is in \\"Suspiria.\\" If you want to laugh and have a shock around every corner like in \\"Scream,\\" \\"Suspiria\\" is probably not the film for you. But if you want to sit back, turn off your mind and get [pulled] into a bizarre, haunted, moody dream, \\"Suspiria\\" may be just the film your looking for. I'm glad I picked it up.want to sit back, turn off your mind and get [pulled] into a bizarre, haunted, moody dream, \\"Suspiria\\" may be just the film your looking for. I'm glad I picked it up.

B00003CXXP|1.0|Many people told me, don't bother with this movie.  I should have believe my friends.  This is one of the most boring movie I have ever seen.  Save your money and save your time.  I would rather watch the paint dry.  Two cockroaches crawling up the wall is more interesting.
B00004XQ83|1.0|I listened to this soundtrack after seeing the movie--O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? (wich actually was a very boring movie, even though it starred George Clooney), and so was this soundtrack. I'll be the first to admit it: I am not into Bluegrass, Gospel, or Folk music. I like Country, but I'm more into the Pop/Rock/Country music and not the real traditional, classic Country. I just thought I'd try this CD since it got such raved reviews and it won the Grammy for 'Album Of The Year'. Well, I hate to say this but, this soundtrack was terrible! I'll agree that the music fit in well with the film, but I just don't like this kind of music so it was not enjoyable for me. This soundtrack was way too long, some of the songs I skipped because it was taking me too long to listen to it. There was not one track on this CD that I found outstanding. I think the Grammys made a mistake by voting this soundtrack 'Album Of The Year'. This album is certainly not what I'd have chosen for 'Album Of The Year'. The O BROTHER! soundtrack was geared toward more &quot;old-timers&quot; anyway. And I actually wasn't too surprised that this album won a Grammy because probably most of the Grammy voters are all old males--does that ring a bell to you? Kind of like an unfair game. I am not 100% positive about that, but I swear to you that it's true. If you like Bluegrass, Gospel, Folk, or tradional Country music or if you loved the film, then you will like the O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU? sountrack. If you fit under neither one of these categories, then don't even bother. Hopefully next year, the Grammy voters will finally get the Grammy winners right!
B00003CX8J|5.0|The X-Men is a great start in the new cinematic world of Marvel Superheroes. It refuses to go over the top, maybe due to budgetary constraints, or just a sense of respect for the Characters and their fan base. X-Men people are  serious comic bookers, and the movie had to be restarined in order to appeal to that core base. The black uniforms and the general darkness of the film continues the trend started by the first Keaton Batman film. It works beautifully here. The powers of the characters are treated as logical extensions of their personalities and are very well done without being too flashy. There is a good dollop of the usual love interest plotlines found in the X-Men comics, but the relationship between Logan and Rogue is very well handled and generates a good deal of heartfelt emotion in the viewer. This is one that is subtle, yet has enough action and drama to merit repeated viewings over the years.
B00005YW4H|4.0|Norah Jones has a lovely voice. If she reminds me of anyone it's Eva Cassidy, but with a little added smokeyness. She has chosen to cover songs from Hank Williams (Cold Cold Heart) through Hoagy Charmichael (The Nearness of You) plus a few of her own, so she fits the &quot;Singer Songwriter&quot; description. The album is slow and moody, but her jazzy approach gives it a nice little swing. Let's hope she sticks around, I can't wait to see how she grows her talent.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I was never really into Pink.  I heard the single on the radio and I thought ,&quot;Hey, this good music.&quot;  The truth is, Pink has a great voice and she is talented songwriter. (Along with Linda Perry[LOL]) This song is teriffic.  There are no other words to describe it.  Do NOT hesitate buy this cd!  My favorite songs were &quot;Don't Let Me Get Me&quot;, &quot;Just Like A Pill&quot;, &quot;Respect&quot;, and &quot;18 Wheeler&quot;.  Besides the occasional cussing, the lyrics are fab and if you liked her first cd , you will, LOVE this one!

0385333846|5.0|This is another incredible book delivered by Kurt Vonnegut.  It, as the rest of his books, takes a satiracle look at the world and mocks society.  Vonnegut manages to combine those elements with strange sci-fi. ideas that somehow mix to create an excellent book.  In this novel, Vonnegut manages to combine time travel, alien abductions, and world war II; it sounds like an odd combination,huh.  However, Vonnegut does an excellent job, as always, to bring relevance to each angle.  Billy Pilgrim, the main character,has become unstuck in time.  He does not move in chronological order through life.  Instead, he jumps from structured moment to structured moment.  He cannot control where he will go next, whether he is going to arrive in spaceship on its way to Tralfamadore, in a meat locker in Dresden, hiding from the firebombings, or sitting at a party with his wife.  Billy leaps from moment to moment slowly telling the story of his life and the horror of world war II.  This book is tremendous; though it is slightly toned down compared to most Vonnegut novels with respect to hidden sarcasm, it still has a wonderful theme that will make you want to read it again and again.
B00005RYLE|1.0|The DVD comes in a neat package but the movie really isn't that good. Its the classic blood horror movie with little theme, beyond the zombies and the poor characters. I wouldn't recommend it.
0440180295|5.0|Vonnegut based many of his novels on his experiences in World War II.  Slaughterhouse Five is probably his most notorious and well recieved novel he has written.  Being a big Vonnegut fan, I would not go as far as that.  Though it is an incredible book, it is a little toned down and obvious in its social commentary.  Vonnegut seems to be less sarcastic in this novel.  In contradiction, it could also be argued that this book cannot be as sarcastic because of its serious topic.  This book seems to be Vonneguts strongest attempt at a serious and affective anti-war novel.  Of cours, Vonnegut does not take the conventional methods to preaching the evils of war.  This novel somehow combines time travel, alien abducttions, WWII, along with Billy Pilgrim's, the main character, whole life.  Bill becomes unstruck in time and no longer travels in a chronological order.  He leaps from moment to moment in his life.  Though this idea maybe hard to follow at first, and it is deffinitely difficult to see the relevence of an alien culture that resembles toilet plungers to World War II, the book eventually ties together extremely well.  He manages to use these other unrelated topics to help underline his major themes.  Whether it is Vonnegut's best or not,it is a brilliant book that I would reccomend to anyone.
0748662529|5.0|First published in Edinburgh, Scotland, this initial work in Alexander McCall Smith's detective series is guaranteed to capture the attention and attachment of an international audience.  With the animated and ardent Precious Ramotswe, Botswana's very own original ladies' detective at the helm, Smith takes his reader on an unforgettable expedition through the African outback and into the hearts and lives of its citizens.  <br />A &quot;fixer of lives,&quot; Mma Ramotswe is a specialist in the ways of men, a rabid hunter of all things fishy and uncertain, and a personal confidant for the people in Gaborone, the largest city in Botswana and site of the only detective agency for ladies in the country.<br />In his entrancing detective novel, Smith reveals the interesting and unexpected ways that traditional methods of detection must be altered and adapted to fit the singular and distinctive culture that is Africa.  To solve the crimes and situations she confronts, Mma Ramotswe must rely heavily on her remarkably keen sense of humanity, intuition, and sharp intellect.  In doing so, the reader also learns a good deal about the physical, political, and social landscape of this small African country and the larger continent.  <BR>In contrast to the hard-boiled detective of most mysteries who hardly take time for coffee, Mma Ramostwe knows and acknowledges the importance of even the simplest life-sustaining rituals.  &quot;She stopped.  It was time to take the pumpkin out of the pot and eat it.  In the final analysis, that was what solved these big problems of life.  You could think and think and get nowhere, but you still had to eat your pumpkin.  That brought you down to earth.  That gave you a reason for going on.  Pumpkin.&quot; (81) Like Mma Ramostwe, the people of Botswana are concerned with the business of life, and in her practical, perceptive way, Mma aids her fellow countrymen and women in this essential pursuit of happiness.  <br />In sharing Mma Ramostwe's stories, Smith delights the reader with a rare glimpse of humanity in all its radiance and unembellished truth.

It is another aspect to the French renaissance but which is clearly overshadowed by the much stronger Daft Punk.<br />Not their best, but not too bad. Nice to listen to in the summer at the Jersey shore maybe.
0805047905|5.0|I had to warm up to Eric Carle but I really dig his work.

B000006CCG|5.0|Absolutely the best single release by W.A.S.P.! This was a phenomenal album when it first came out and the CD is still great to listen to today. This is metal at it's finest! The band would continue to put out good material for years to come, but in my opinion, this was the pinnacle of their creative careers. Every song here is good, whether it is heavy or slow. If I had to pick a weakest moment it would be the track &quot;Hellion&quot;, simply because I can't even remember it at 3 in the morning, but the others ring loud and clear. <br />As far as good songs go, there is more than an ample supply. Tracks worth a close listen include &quot;B.A.D.&quot;, &quot;School Daze&quot;, &quot;On Your Knees&quot;, &quot;Tormentor&quot;, and &quot;The Torture Never Stops&quot;. Exceptional songs that should have been huge hits are &quot;I Wanna Be Somebody&quot;, &quot;The Flame&quot;, &quot;LOVE Machine&quot; and my favorite &quot;Sleeping in the Fire&quot;. The bonus tracks make this an even better deal as you get &quot;Animal&quot;, a great version of &quot;Paint It Black&quot;, and &quot;Show No Mercy&quot;. <br />Blackie Lawless vocals are very good on this CD, but the high point is probably the guitar work of Chris Holmes and Randy Piper. Not quite as good as the twin leads of Thin Lizzy, but very good indeed! The production and musicianship make this an excellent release. NO great metal collection should be complete without this recording. This is one of my 100 all-time best. If you like this you may try HEADLESS CHILDREN.
0694003611|4.0|I had never heard of Goodnight Moon until my niece was born but since then it has become a favorite.  I read this to my little one as a signal that the end of the day is near and it's time for bed.  This book has a lulling quality that is soothing and calming.  At times I still can't see the hype but my little one loves this book so that's all that matters.
B000063V8R|4.0|Season 3 of STTNG is the season that saved Star Trek.<BR>In the first two seasons,the show's good ratings had slowly been dropping.These first two seasons had so-so production values and some rather forced conflict.<BR>In those first two seasons,cast members wandered around the Enterprise in comic book T-shirt uniforms or went down to a \\"planet\\" that was obviously a studio set.<BR>The very average effects were usually of a cheap shot of the ship in moving in front of a planet.<BR>Reviews of the show had been mixed,but in the third season the critics were very pleased with the quality of the show.<BR>The stories were much improved and more inventive than the very average and sometimes mediocre first two seasons. Writer Michael Piller joined the series and he was a great addition. He was responsible for the much improved storylines which concentrated more on characterization rather than monster or alien stories. <BR>The cast were back in new and better looking cotton uniforms with higher collars replacing the awful costume design of the first two seasons.<BR>Other uniforms,such as the ridiculous patchwork Admirals uniforms were also re-designed and improved.<BR>The Doctor Crusher character was brought back and was an improvement over the Dr Pulaski character.<BR>The set design,effects,stories and production values were vastly improved to the point of this virtually being like a new show,such was the improvement.<BR>And because of this,the ratings went back up and were the best ever.Star Trek's future was assured.This is the box set to buy for the series best.<BR>The first episode \\"Evolution\\" was similar to season ones mediocre \\"Home Soil\\" but this time the story was done much better,showing how superior this season was.The special effects and production values were at the time innovative.<BR>There were some great episodes like \\"The Survivors\\" and \\"Who Watches the Watchers\\" which has a plot about a planet being watched by Starfleet through a duckblind and was much likethe movie Star Trek:Insurrection.\\"Booby Trap\\" showed how the special effects had improved and the planet scenes for \\"The Enemy\\" where La Forge is trapped on a storm-ridden planet with a Romulan showed how much the new lighting team had improved the stage scenes for planet surface scenes.No more did they look like sound stages.\\"The Defector\\" gave us good drama as a Romulan defector warns of an impending war and \\"Yesterdays Enterprise\\" is one of the series favourites with great battle scenes.Check out Tasha Yar's officer boyfriend-he was one of the actors originally tested for the Riker role and missed out.Other great episodes are \\"The Offspring\\" where Data creates a daughter and \\"Sarek\\" about Spock's father becoming ill.\\"Hollow Pursuits\\" is an eccellent Barclay episode and \\"Deja Q\\" is a good comedy episode.It all ends with the cliffhanger \\"Best Of Both Worlds\\" episode which started a cliffhanger trend in Star Trek.I have seen all the Star Trek series and this one is the most entertaining,with the best lineup of Trek characters and is the most fun.Seasons 4 and 5 continued the high standard before Rick Berman made the mistake(in season 6)of making two Star Trek series at the same time and lowered the standard of writing.52 episodes per season was too much.Still,seasons 6 and 7 did have some good episodes as well,but season 3 is the best.
B000001FY9|4.0|Sure, this has all the US radio hits, but what about the rest of the stuff?  Bob Marley did so much, you shouldn't limit yourself to a set of 14 songs.  If you really want to get into it, go get the Songs of Freedom Box Set, it has some 78 songs on it, and all of them kick ....  For a little taste of that one, go get Trenchtown Rock, Acoustic Medley, Lively Up Yourself, Ride Natty Ride...if you got the money, do as I say and you can thank me later.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Let's just say that AI is not the type of film that will entertain you. Provoke you, yes. Get you to think, absolutely. But not entertain. This isn't good old American escapism, it explores our human emotions deep down to its core. At the same time, it is a beautiful movie, with striking images and an amazing vision of the future, with a tight script and outstanding acting (why nobody from this film got an Oscar nom, I don't understand). It combines Kubrick's love of the bizarre with old-school Spielberg sappiness, and somehow manages to pull it all off.<br />The story follows the life of a robot child named David, the first robot made to love. The First Act of the film shows David introduced to his human family, and all the strange conflicts of love, jealiousy, and even repulsion that occur. These scenes are utterly chilling and creepy while being strangely sweet, and they play on our emotions just as easily as David's programmed whispers of \\"I love you, mommy\\" confuse the emotionally precarious mother. In a scene that belongs in film history, the mother finally abandons David in the woods, and he clings to the car screaming as she drives away. <br />In the Second Act, David joins with Gigilo Joe, and a robotic teddy bear to embark an quest, sort of like a twisted sci-fi vision of the Wizard of Oz. The Third Act catapults us 2000 years into the future, when super-robots discover David in a block of ice. While this future is beautiful and fun to explore, these story sequences aren't nearly as interesting as the first third of the film, and yet there are many many interesting throw-away shots and min-stories which can hold your attention. Spielberg consistantly blurs the difference between humans and robots, and when new characters are introduced the audience is left wondering \\"is its real?\\" for more than a few seconds. The acting performances are consistantly brilliant. Not a single bad actor in the film, to be truthful. Jude Law is unfortgetable, and Haley Osment is so good he puts adult actors to shame. <br />Many have said this movie is both brillant and flawed, and I can agree. There is simply too much to digest the first time you see it. Also, the pacing of the movie is all wrong, and some of the greatest climaxes come early in the film. All this makes for an excellent DVD, though! Now you can simply watch the moments that you feel like, and not sit through the entire saga. <br />THE DVD - is okay, but not great. Spielberg does not give audio commentaries for his movies, which is a tremendous crime for filmmakers now and in the future. The \\"making of\\" documentaries are numerous and detailed, but with a film this complex, I discovered that they simply do not tell us enough. The audio and visual quality of the DVD is excellent.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This is the best rock CD ever.  I've been listening to this on a regular basis since it was released, and I can't say that about anything else I own.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|Next to \\"Shall We Dance\\", Strictly Ballroom is one of THE great dance movies.  It contains everything that makes dance movies so wonderful - an intimate romance, conflict between the powers-that-be and the pure & innocent, and stunning dance sequences obviously inspired by people who love dancing.  It is amazingly funny and touching, very emotional while still remaining light entertainment.  It doesn't have that \\"cool\\" thing that turns me off from so many other dance movies - you know, where the \\"cool\\" people can dance but the [others] can't...  Strictly Ballroom is stricly dancing, and its story is all about dancing, told through dancing, and simply wouldn't exist without dancing.  You'll want to learn dancing after you see it.      <br />Lead character Scott is a young, profesional ballroom dancer who is favored to win the next major Pan-Pacific dancing championship.  His form and image are perfect, but his own deep inspiration moves Scott to dance in his own style, and this individuality sets him against the proffesional dancing leadership and threatens to derail his entire career.  The group of people trying to keep Scott in line is headed by his own mother, an obsessive woman who drives her family into a frenzy to become top figures in the dance world.  In the background we have Scott's friends and various partners and the organizers of the tournament, and despite the pressure Scott is still compelled to \\"dance his own steps.\\"  Only one person seems to believe in him, a beginning dancer named Fran, and as she starts to train with Scott a romance blooms and their courage inspires others.  Still, the powers throw everything they can at Scott to knock him off course, and by the end you are on the edge of your seat. All I can really say is that the climax is wonderful filmmaking and very saticfying.<br />My favorite thing about this movie is all the mini-stories going on about each of its supporting characters, and how the film effortlessly floats between their flavors of comedy, lost dreams, hatred, corruption, and ruthless competition.  There is some spellbinding sequences about the Pasa-Double, in which Scott is taught the meaning of rythmn and the pure challenge and conflict of dance, almost like Yoda was there teaching Scott \\"the Force\\" of dancing. (haha)  This film is also very topical considering the recent Olympic figure skating scandels - you can actually see how something like that comes all about in this movie.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|My husband and I watch this classic at least twice a year and just love the nostalgic look at America!  Judy Garland is at her loveliest here, and each song is one you might go home singing to yourself after watching this movie. Judy's wistful rendition of \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\" brings a lunp to my throat each time I hear it, and I'm certain that people of all ages will love the simple beauty of family life in turn of the century America portrayed in this film.

B00004Y87O|2.0|Futuristic sci-fi actioner details an attempt to break into New York City, now a gigantic prison, to get the United States president out.  The film gets a boost from such an intriguing premise and a highly enjoyable performance from Kurt Russell, but the action scenes completely lack in energy, lots of potential is wasted, and New York looks pretty much like any other urban neighborhood.  I'm a fan of John Carpenter, but I can't defend his work here.  Followed by a fairly ridiculous but enjoyable sequel.
B000002KOO|1.0|2013 NOTE: I posted this review in 2002 on the [[ASIN:B000002KOO original 1990 release]].  Unfortunately, with Amazon's idiotic policy of cross-pollination of reviews across multiple editions of the same title, it appears on the [[ASIN:B00DB624GS new 2013 remastered edition]]... Not my fault! As Warner is choosing to still press that atrocity, instead of deleting it, I'm leaving the original review posted.<br /><br />Yes, Warner Brothers, I mean you.<br /><br />With all of the advances in remastering technology over the life of the CD format, you should be ashamed to offer such a classic recording that sounds this bad. And that is why I'm giving a one-star rating to a five-star album.<br /><br />Imagine my dismay when I slipped this great album into my CD player, cued up \\"Oh, Well\\", and was greeting with the tinniest, noisiest (hiss), most distorted and worst sounding presentation of this song I've ever heard. Whatever master this travesty was spawned from sounds many times removed from the original recording.<br /><br />Granted, the original recording has inherent noise and distortion, but even the LP I had back in the 70's sounded better than this. And the technology certainly exists, and has existed for years, to bring this wonderful recording properly into the digital domain.<br /><br />To properly judge how bad this CD sounds, all one has to do is A/B \\"Oh, Well\\" from \\"Then\\" against the remastered single version on the now-defunct \\"The Chain\\" box set.<br /><br />This is a textbook example of why consumers have complained about the CD format for so long. In this case, this is horrible neglect of a classic recording, and a pathetic corporate culture at Warner's in refusing to utilize modern technology to improve the listening experience for the consumer for almost 30 years.<br /><br />WB, where is your soul? When exactly did you lose it (maybe that black day 25+ years ago when you fired Bonnie Raitt, Van Morrison and a host of talented others in the same day?). Haven't you sold enough copies of \\"Rumors\\" alone to afford to properly re-master this classic?<br /><br />But then again, I am speaking to the company who has steadfastedly refused to bring its catalog into the digital age until the late 90's - over two decades since the introduction of the CD format.<br /><br />As I said before, Warner Brothers, you should be ashamed. You dishonor your company, the artists whose true genius cannot be fully (audibly) appreciated, and the legacy of the pioneers of your company who found and nurtured those artists, all for the sake of the allmighty buck.ven't you sold enough copies of \\"Rumors\\" alone to afford to properly re-master this classic?<br /><br />But then again, I am speaking to the company who has steadfastedly refused to bring its catalog into the digital age until the late 90's - over two decades since the introduction of the CD format.<br /><br />As I said before, Warner Brothers, you should be ashamed.

0140186395|5.0|My husband and I have a tradition.  Ever since our honeymoon 8 years ago, we've read books aloud to eachother. East of Eden was our latest. Having read Grapes of Wrath together 4 years ago, we thought nothing of Steinbeck's could top it. These two books are very different books, so I'm not going to say one is greater than the other. There was a different focus, they are so different you can not call one greater. But we were amazed at the greatness of this book!!! We were so engaged in it that we read it much faster than anything but Wilkie Collins(it's impossible not to read WC fast...but that's another review.) We were very attatched to the characters...these are not shallow characters you don't care much about. You want them to succeed!  You want to see what is going to happen to them. It's a very introspective book, you WILL remember it, it affects you.  So just start reading and don't worry about being bored or worry about choosing the book which was Steinbeck's best. Just start reading.
B0000640VN|3.0|When Liev Schreiber as Meg Ryan's former boyfriend opens a time portal, a love match extending not just over the Atlantic Ocean but over the expanse of better than a century occurs.  At the end of the picture Schreiber sees the full significance:<br />\\"You'd better get over to England,\\" he warns Ryan, \\"or I'm never going to be born.\\"<br />The critical need for Ryan to travel across the time expanse to nineteenth century England and reunite with the love of her life is that the Duke of Albany, played by dashing Hugh Jackman, is the genius inventor great-great grandfather of Schreiber, who realizes that the future will be disrupted if Ryan's love cannot find him a wife and put the discontented aristocrat on the track to establishing a family.<br />When the story begins the Duke is on the verge of having his engagement announced to a young American woman from Schnectady, New York on the simple pretext that it is time for him to get married and this is an excellent economic match, a position taken frequently through history in monarchical and aristocratic circles.  The Duke is bored by the whole thing, having concluded that he is not about to find love in the first place.<br />Once that he is transported across the Atlantic to present day New York Jackman discovers love with Meg Ryan.  Once that she gets over the initial culture shock of meeting a man from another era with a different social perspective Ryan becomes so impressed by Jackman that she displays her flattery in the area where her pocketbook resides, the career domain.  Ryan, a female advertising executive, thinks Jackman conveys just the level of elan coupled with credibility to serve as an excellent advertising spokesperson.  The only hitch, however, is that Jackman is indeed a man of credibility and sterling integrity.  He balks over being expected to endorse a product in which he does not believe.  His protest over the \\"follow the leader\\" symbolism of Madison Avenue advertising practices prompts Ryan to see her life and job in a new light.<br />After Jackman has been transported back to England and is on the verge of agreeing to an engagement to the girl from Schenectady, and the surely loveless marriage that will result, Schreiber stresses the need for Ryan to be reunited with him.  She makes her decision at the formal party thrown in her honor to announce her elevation to the vice-presidency of the advertising company where she works.  She stuns those in attendance by respectfully declining the promotion offer, then rushes off.<br />Ryan in the nick of time manages to jump from Brooklyn Bridge, at which point the time dimension catapults her to England and back to Jackman.  The loveless marriage will not occur, the girl from Schenectady is destined to fade away, and love will reign between Ryan and Jackman, who will ultimately invent the elevator.<br />This is a lighter, more comedic time travel romance as opposed to the more solemn 1980 love story drama superbly rendered in \\"Somewhere in Time\\" with Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymour.
B00003CXI1|5.0|\\"Harry Potter And The Sorcerer's Stone\\" Was a great book but it leaves you with the thought of how these characters would look like in real-life. The movie takes you to that imagination! Looking at Quidditch as a true sport, seeing a three-headed dog growling, and seeing the face of evil! The movie made a great hit as the books. At first I thought that the movie wasn't going to survive but was I wrong! I loved that movie! That is why I gave the movie 5 stars!! A show of how much I love the boy who lived...lived in the imaginary(magical) world and in the real-world(muggle)!
B000000HZT|4.0|I read these reviews and bought the CD in March 2002. No kidding about the first chord of From The Undertow - it really sets the tone for the album. This is a moody album written around quite a sad story. Have a look at the lyrics and remember that Lucky Me belongs at the end. For a While is terribly sad. I'm not complaining, of course; I'm just pointing out that this is not a feel-good story. Nor is Squonk or Ripples from Genesis' A Trick of the Tail, and I adore that album.<br />The music is excellent, though the keyboard sounds are a bit dated in a few cases. I am a sucker for arpeggiated guitar chords, and there are plenty of them here. The singer is mediocre, and the worst part of the album is the hoarse shout at the beginning of the song \\"A Curious Feeling\\". There is a section starting at 2:05 in \\"The Lie\\" in which the vocals and piano sound remarkably like Elton John in the verse of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road. \\"Still\\" (heh), after a few listens the dated keyboard sounds and decidedly second-rate singer start to disappear, and you hear the compositions and story, and suddenly you realize that this is a fantastic album, just waiting to be re-recorded and re-released.<br />Oh yes, re: the \\"Tony was the brains of Genesis\\" comments, don't overlook Steve Hackett. His solo work is risky, and in some cases turned out quite well - especially Voyage of the Acolyte, Spectral Mornings, and Please Don't Touch! (in that order).
B00003CXXO|2.0|an opinion so here's one more. It was just a bit disappointing. I was waiting for a &quot;pay off&quot; that never came. It just ambled along, very slow in some parts. The movie started with  really possible scientific development that will happen, probably in the relatively near future. Then it concludes with something totally different. It was if the producers didn't know how to end it. 20 years ago ET was great. Today AI not so.
B00005MM67|3.0|When I found a copy of K2 on DVD I was really excited.  However, when I came home and watched it I was very disappointed about the film tranfer to DVD.  The picture looks a bit clouded and soft.  During some of the darkers scences I could see pixels in the character's movement and background.  The sound is Ok but not too impressive.  The DVD has very little extras.  Even though the DVD is disappointing it doesn't take away from the incredible climbing scenes.  This is a great climbling movie despite the DVD flaws.  Wait for a better release if it ever happens.
B00003CX5P|3.0|... about this movie. I have seen the original trilogy more than 15 times and this movie 3 times so far, yet I cannot decide whether I liked it or was disappointed in it.<br />First of all, I'm from that gang who didn't like Jar Jar (let's not use strong words here and let's not be impolite, but I DIDN'T like him). He is the equivalent of the funny characters in cartoons -- to me he was annoying and got way too much screen time.<br />Second, I didn't like Jake Lloyd. He didn't act, period. There are so many child actors out there who are good, like that one in The Sixth Sense or the one in Harry Potter (sorry, I'm not very good with names). Those two would probably have been too old for the part, but there must be others!!<br />Well, if you got this far, you are interested in what I have to say... I don't know WHAT I was expecting of this movie and what it should have been in order to attract and awe me like the original trilogy has. And if even I don't know, how could I ask Lucas to know?! But something was definitely missing and wrong - apart from Anakin and Jar Jar, that is. Perhaps it's the magic that a childhood fairytale has and that at a certain age you aren't able to sense anymore. Perhaps it's just Han. I don't know. I watched the movie intently everytime but it simply doesn't catch me like the old ones have. I don't get the thrills I got every time I watched those. I am unable to identify with any of the characters and care for them. I hoped, feared and rejoiced alongside Han, Luke and Leia everytime, but Obi Wan and Qui-Gon just leave me cold like I was watching some strangers.<br />The special effects are good, we all agree about that, but perhaps they were overused... like many reviewers have said, Lucas paid more attention to them than to the story.<br />And what about Darth Maul? (Yes, it's MAUL, not MALL or MAUI or whatever... Amazon.com should really check those spellings). He wears that ridiculous painting on his face and he's supposed to be the villain? My oh my... Now Palpatine/Sidious, THAT was a great villain...<br />Anyway, like (almost) everybody out there I hope that Episode II will be better...
0671004107|5.0|Arguably, this is the greatest science-fiction book ever written.  Nearly impossible to put down once you've picked it up, its blend of extremely plausible fiction and sociological prediction is, in my experience, unmatched.  You will find when you read it, that you are swept away in how real it all seems.<br />The movie is similar to the novel, but the ending is far better explained and more believable.<br />Contact also provides a profound, soul-searching question to all of us, spiritually and scientifically, from the first chapter to the last awe-inspiring page.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I haven't listened to the whole cd yet... in fact i don't own it.<BR>I've listened to &quot;Get this party started&quot; and &quot;Don't let me get me&quot; which are both great songs. I've heard bits and pieces of the other songs on this cd...I love them!! Some are heart-felt and touching, while others are just...Pink! She might use some bad language, but does that matter? Not a single kid these days hasn't heard or used the exact same language that Pink is useing.<BR>She has done a great job and I applaud her on that.
B000002AGE|4.0|This album is a 180 degree about face from Weather Report's earlier masterpiece, 'I sing the body electric'.  The earlier relase features extensive improvisations and free jazz type techniques.  Heavy Weather is most often rigidly arranged.  The arrangements are good, and the tunes are catchy and infectious. There are some improvised solos here for sure, but in the context of largely pre-determined compositions.  This is essentially a collection of extremely well-crafted pop tunes.  One would be hard pressed to recognize this band as the same Weather Report that recorded 'I Sing the Body Electric'.<br />I enjoyed this album tremendously when I was first getting into jazz as a teenager. Having been an electric bass player at the time, I particularly appreciated Jaco Pastorius's considerable contributions.  However, now that I have delved deeper into jazz, done a lot more listening and even some performing of jazz, I miss the continual interaction on this album that often happens between a combo of jazz musicians in a more liberated setting.<br />This is a great introduction to the Fusion genre and will probably be remembered as one of its defining moments.
B000002JS6|5.0|What can I say...in my opinion this is the BEST ROCK AND ROLL album of all time!
0780622650|3.0|I had high hopes for this movie having been a long time fan of the original series. Unfortunately, although the movie uses the original series as a premise, it too quickly ditches what made that series special for so many people, and instead goes for a 90s special effects theme park ride approach. The characters which made the original series are pushed to one side, and the acting in the movie is very wooden. I would have liked to have seen a greater role for the original series cast, and wished New Line Cinema had shown a little more deference to the series. For example, when the Jupiter 2 lifts off from Earth, it looks pretty much like the original ship. But that is only the outer shell, which is crudely 'dumped' by the new Jupiter, which looks positively awful. This mindset then pervades the entire movie.<br />Buy it...but don't expect much... I'm waiting for the original series to be released on DVD...<br />Malcolm
B00003CXXP|2.0|I really was hoping for a good time when I sat down with this movie last night. What I got was a complete waste of over two hours. While A.I. is visually interesting, the uber-depressing plot rambles here and there with no solid direction. I think this must have been a &quot;movie by committee&quot; where everyone involved threw in their ideas on what the characters should do and no one bothered to say &quot;No, that is silly&quot; or &quot;no that will make this movie even longer&quot;. I was even underwhelmed by the usually fantastic music by John Williams. I think this is the first time I ever saw a movie with music by John where I wasn't enthralled with the score and couldn't walk away humming the main theme. This movie was a terrible dissapointment.
B00005JKYS|5.0|A must see. This movie left me in awe. It truly shows the brutality of war and the courage and heroism of the American soldier. Mel Gibson was outstanding in his role as Lt. Colonel Hal Moore and portrayed the essense of this man. Sam Elliot was also outstanding in his performance as Sgt. Major Basil Plumley. I highly recommend this movie, especially for those who want to see and understand what the American Soldier faced in Viet Nam.
B00003CXXP|1.0|I cannot believe I wasted over 2.5 hours of my life watching this terrible movie.  I was taken aback at the lack of creativity, as well as a total sham of a plot.  The movie had no direction at all, it was nothing but a downward spiral towards the unsatisfying and completely lame ending.  I am a serious fan of sci-fi and action, such as LORD OF THE RINGS and STAR WARS, however AI was completely blown out of the park by the mentioned films...Have a more enjoyable time drowning yourself.
B00002IJ48|5.0|Another must for fans of AIC's uniqueness.  As well as some truly great videos, this features documentary footage (some very, very funny stuff!!) from before the band became big, and gives you an insight into their characters & personalities.<br />Highlights include the \\"We Die Young\\" videos and \\"I Stay Away\\"<br />I really, really miss this band! *sob*<br />Buy it!!!!
B00005NZJX|4.0|First of all, the album is a combo of rock/rap.  Very cool.  <br />Second off, even if you don't have a DVD player (WHY?), the songs on both discs are well worth your time and money.  <br />Third, the video.  Oh, the video!  I never knew that about 4 minutes could be so cool.  I had to cut a star, though, because the video is one of a quintilogy (5), and there's no reason why all 5 couldn't be on the disc.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|Ben Stiller is really a funny guy when he tries hard. Zoolander was offbeat and silly and I enjoyed the time I spent watching it.<BR>It's not overlong and it doesn't take itself seriously...it's just a goofy movie about a goofy guy and his goofy problems. I think anyone with a sense of humour will have fun with it.
B00005OM4N|5.0|Recently, I became a Britney Spears fan after I heard her song \\"Overprotected\\" in a Best Buy store. I thought that song was SO great that I decided to buy the album it's on. Before that event, I didn't really like her music, yep, one of those Britney Haters. I am SO GLAD that I bought that album and that now I am a DEVOTED fan of hers. This album, 'Britney' is incredible! It slowly develops on you and envelops you eventually; it has a certain addicting quality to it. I find myself playing the songs in my head LONG AFTER hearing the actual album in my CD player. It almost distracts me from my daily chores of school and homework and even daily life!!! The album is THAT good!!!!!! After buying this album I decided to buy her other two albums as well. '...Baby One More Time' is excellent but my favorite albums from her are 'Oops!...I Did It Again' and 'Britney'. The songs on 'Britney' (and 'Oops!...I Did It Again') are EXTREMELY well organized and have superb instrumentals, beats, and hooks, let alone the superb, quality singing by Britney herself. The album makes a statement that Britney has grown up now and is no longer an innocent little teenager anymore. Personally, I think she is one of the greatest singers and musicians out there, if not THE best, and can most definitely and most substantially stand on her own with the best of them. Britney Spears IS AWESOME. Thank you Britney for entering into my life with your awesome, incredible music.
0446677450|2.0|As a self-proclaimed guide to escape the &quot;rat race&quot; of financial pattern, Rich Dad Poor Dad merely regurgitates the same drawn-out information for the duration of 197 pages. With oversimplified lessons, and unfulfilling anecdotes, Kiyosaki, forms no true basis for his arguments.  He is quick to generalize the efforts needed for success by reducing the issue of poverty to a character flaw.  He discredits entirely the value of education, by encouraging one's focus to be directed solely on becoming financially literate.  It is quite interesting that this type of book was able to make its way to #1 on the bestseller list without others finding such errors in Kiyoski's reasoning.
6304230109|5.0|Possibly the best of all the MTV \\"Unplugged\\" series... this shows just what fantastic musicians all the guys are, they're so tight as a band...<br />It's really sad to see Layne Staley, one of the best vocal talents ever in my opinion, looking so pale and fragile, but despite his struggle he pulls off one of the best performances I've ever heard - what a voice!! <br />A timeless classic that EVERYONE should have in their collection!  Buy it NOW!!!!
B00005TT77|2.0|New Line Cinema's got some brass ones on them, that's for sure.  The soundtrack to their Sean Penn vehicle, I Am Sam, consists entirely of Beatles covers recorded by the likes of The Wallflowers, Eddie Vedder, Sheryl Crow, and the Black Crowes.  While this may sound like a recipe for disaster (and it is), thankfully they [aren't all bad].  Eddie Vedder's bears his soul in the sublime \\"You've Got To Hide Your Love Away,\\" which is able to equal the mournful feel of the original and is the album's standout track.  If ever there was a band made to cover \\"Lucy In the Sky With Diamonds,\\" it's the Black Crowes, and they do not disappoint with their trippy rendition.  Other highlights include Ben Folds' faithful \\"Golden Slumbers,\\" Rufus Wainright's \\"Across the Universe,\\" and the Stereophonics interpretation of one of my personal favorites, \\"Don't Let Me Down.\\"  Unfortunately, practically rest of the album falls flat.  If I never have to hear Sheryl Crow's \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" again, I'll die a happy man.  The track is just downright bad, and New Line should demand a refund on whatever they paid her.  Howie Day's \\"Help!\\" takes every iota of life out of the song by killing the original's brisk pace and rendering it glacial.  Nick Cave barely even bothers to sing one of the Beatles' most inspirational tracks, \\"Let It Be,\\" and Paul Westerberg's \\"Nowhere Man,\\" The Vines' \\"I'm Only Sleeping,\\" and Sarah McLachlan's \\"Blackbird\\" are entirely unremarkable.  While New Line should be applauded for the risk they took with this soundtrack, they should at the same time be chastised for its lack of execution.  They've managed to take the songs of rock's most revered and influential band, and render them lifeless and forgettable.  Who would have thought it would ever be possible?
B00003CXXP|4.0|Many people have blasted AI, saying that Spielberg bastardized Stanley Kubrick's vision.  I can only guess that these people never watched the movie, much less looked at any of the documentation provided on the DVD.<br />Brian Aldiss had the vision for the story.  Kubrick took that vision and expanded it to fit the big screen.  But Kubrick knew that he couldn't do it himself.  So he turned to the one man he knew could make his expanded vision a reality: Steven Spielberg.  The Pinoccio images were welded onto the story by Kubrick, but Spielberg managed to make them work.<br />The great thing about AI is that it tells different stories at a variety of levels.  Most obvious is David's quest to be loved.  Mistakenly, he believes that he can only be loved if he is &quot;real&quot;.  Then there is Gigalo Joe, who joins David in order to prolong his existance.  Joe just wants to fulfill his function: making women happy.  But when he teams up with David, he becomes subltey aware of the end of his own existance, and the need to make a mark of the universe so that when he is gone, he will not necessarily be forgotten.  And then there is Teddy, a simple toy who develops emotions all his own, although no one seems to notice.<br />Some would prefer to have ended the movie with David trapped beneath the ocean, making the movie a Tragedy.  Many have blasted the &quot;happy ending&quot; wherein David finds a moment of fullfilment before his dissolution.  What they really find displeasing about this ending is the bleak view of the future of Humanity.  A tragic ending is so much more palatable if the viewer can imagine humanity continuing on.  Yet AI denies us this.  Humanity's future is bleak, short, and terminal.  Robots continue on, but Humanity is gone.  And once gone, nothing can bring us back.  A brave ending in these days of Hollywood happy endings and open ends for sequels.

068484267X|5.0|Despite the misery that the McCourt family had to live through, there was a tremendous amount of love and warmth holding the family together.  Angela, the mother, did everything she could for the children, often depriving herself of food and clothing to give to her children.  In the end, it was the love and nurturing that greatly contributed to the strength of character that her children developed with at least two becoming successful authors in the US.  A good story about parenting even in the harshest of conditions.

B00005UEAR|5.0|Solitary Shell is currently one of my favorite songs of all time. For me, that song pretty much sums up existence in these times for a musician/artist. Both CDs are amazing. Ever since Jordan Rudess joined the band, they have just become more powerful and more precisely to the point. And with the emergence of Transatlantic and Liquid Tension, it only adds to the magnificence of musical creativity. I also really enjoyed the Mullmuzzler CDs. I was fortunate to also see John Petrucci in concert on the G3 tour last year. Wow! Great stuff! Jordan's Feeding the Wheel is a great piece of work too! Nice job all you guys, and please keep it up!!! I just can't get enough of this kind of music!
0446677450|3.0|I thought this book was very insightful.  I liked how Kiyosaki broke down the reasons why the rich are rich and why the poor are poor; what steps are needed to succeed in business.  The insights of the author are very interesting as far as how you need to make money work for you, and not work for money. I thought this was a pretty good book.
B00005Y228|5.0|Kylie Minogue's new album &quot;Fever&quot; is one of the best up beat dance albums I have heard in a very long time.  All the songss are very ear catching.  Of course her first single, &quot;Cant<br />get you out of my head&quot; is awesome and is making its way up the<br />the charts.  Other songs on the album are also addicting.<br />Track number 7, &quot;Come into my world&quot; is one of my favorite songs on the entire album.  It's very vibrant and powerful<br />to hear blasting on your car radio.  The two additional<br />tracks at the end of the disc are also the same as the rest.<br />If you like dance, get this album because all the songs are<br />worth the price.  Get ready to dance the night away.
B000002J1I|4.0|I put off buying this album for along time because I had heard so many bad things about it.  After hearing it several times now I am definitley on the side of those that like this recording.  Even so there are a couple of things that mystify me about Tormato.  The first is the actual sound which is not terrible but me thinks it could have been better.  I mean these guys were a very successful band that seemed to have already mastered the recording side of things.  Well just listen to the previous 6 or 7 recordings.  Another thing is that the band almost sounds less mature.  If I were told this thing came out 1970-71 I could believe it.  Were they trying to be new wavey possibly??  Anyway, these mysteries in my opinion only add to the charm of Tormato.  I really like it alot and feel it is  a fine album that is a welcome addition to the YES catalogue.  It is a bit lighter with shorter songs but the band sounds very inspired and they also sound like they are having alot of fun.  Cool Stuff!!
B000062Y98|5.0|If you are already a fan of Blind Guardian, you need to get this album.  Now.  If you are not, you will be after hearing it.  The music is complex and rich, with some amazing guitar- and drumwork, and, of course, it rocks.  Hard.  There is not a single weak track on the album, and I find that trying to single out one track over the others is difficult.  From the opening drums and Mediterranean-influenced guitars on Precious Jerusalm, to the urgency and majestic chorus of Battlefield, from the beautiful and complex The Maiden and the Minstrel Knight, to the truly epic And Then There Was Silence, this is what music should be.  <br />I cannot recommend this album enough.

B0000640VO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this piece as well as others from Jeunet (City of Lost Children, Delicatessen). The picture contains all of Jeunet's attention to indiosyncrasies along with an amazingly precise style. This is a story that you have to let tell itself. Be passive and enjoy the eccentricities of the characters and how they are played interwovenly. I have awaited this disc eagerly and cannot wait to display it properly in my collection. It is as good as bought. Long live Jeunet & Co.
1558908420|5.0|This is one of the most under-rated movies I have ever seen. As was mentioned by other reviewers, the acting was excellent across the board. It's also interesting how all the stars got fat - look how much weight Stallone, DeNiro and Liotta put on for this movie - it may not be \\"sexy\\" but it adds to the realism.<br />To me, this movie was an examination of the gray areas of legal/illegal and right/wrong. We laugh at a drunk Sheriff who uses his key to get into a parking meter so he can play more pinball and we watch him drive drunk thinking he really shouldn't do that, and when the car ends up damaged and his deputies cover it up for him, we think, well, that's the way it works. But that's only the begining. We continue to watch through drug-use, extortion, theft, evidence-tampering, and murder.<br />Exactly which of these transgressions (if any) is forgiveable? And if you've started down this road, when do you stop?<br />No, this movie is not an \\"action flick\\" - it's not Die Hard. (Don't get me wrong, I thought Die Hard was a good action flick.) But Copland has much more brains than that. This is no shoot-em-up with lots of explosions - it's a well-crafted and deeply subtle film. Highly recommended.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I see this movie in Zurich movie theater and was impressed from the beginning. Its fast, funny and also sad. but allround, i just went the next day to find the soundtrack CD, i bought it and enjoy listening to most of the songs. Than i stumbled unto the DVD and bought it also. All the special features are great and give an insight of the making of. <br />I liked the actor who performed the duke? the rich man who should finance the moulin rouge anyway, his facial expressions are damn fantastic. <br />Nicole Kidman and Ewan McGregor have wounderful voices, i love to hear their songs.<br />All in All, i would recommend to buy this movie.
0060012331|5.0|Once again Terry Pratchett reaches into is back of tricks and pulls out a rat named Dangerous Beans or another rat called Sardines (a dancing rat, mind you), or a street cat called Maurice, or a young woman named Malicia and even a boy named Keith. Keith? Must be a slip up. Let's see, the story all started when some ordinary rats got into the Magic College's trash heap and ate some thing that gave them brains. Well, a lot more brains than they had before.<br />And then a hungry cat ate one of the rats and suddenly it was getting regular headaches and making a point of not eating anything that talks. Maurice, being a practically minded cat, immediately saw the possibilities, and recruited Keith, who was a bit dumb looking but could play the pipes. Suddenly the troop was on the road, working the old pied piper scam, and making good money at it. Dangerous Beans was their spiritual guide, their thinker of Big Thoughts, the rest take care of undoing traps, spotting poison and widdling on things, etc.  In no time, town after town was anteing up to get rid of their rats.<br />The only drawback was that one couldn't very well work the same trick in the same place twice, so eventually the gang found themselves in the town of Bad Blintz. And this town was just a bit different. For one thing the resident rats had eaten all the food, but there weren't any resident rats to be found. For another thing, the resident rat catchers seemed to be making rat tails out of shoestrings. And there is something really, really bad in the cellars beneath the city. Worst of all, Malicia the mayor's daughter also lives in Bad Blintz.<br />If the above description gives you a clear idea of what 'The Amazing Maurice...' is about I've done my job poorly. Suffice it to say that a group of rats that do a much better job of being people than people do find themselves in a battle to save the town and, perhaps, life as we know it. Once again Pratchett has created a morality tale out of sarcasm and parody. One that can surprise us by touching our hearts unexpectedly. In Discworld, where nothing works quite like it should, things still manage to work out well (well, most of the time... for some people).<br />This tale is funny and likeable. While intended for young adults it works just as well for old youngsters like me. Even the strange references to Mr. Bunnsey and Ratty Rupert are fun. Just don't eat that green wobbly bit.y.

B000002UA9|1.0|I am one of the bigger Beatles fans out there, but they didn't put out anything worth listening to until a couple of songs on Help and A Hard Days Night. You cannot listen to this and complain about the teenyboppers today. Its just the singles padded with covers, and neither are very good. If you want to hear the reason that these guys were (briefly - though not as briefly as the Stones) the Best Band in Rock and Roll, listen to Revolver or Abbey Road, both of which are some of the all-time best albums ever written. This is mindless fluff not worth the time it takes to listen to it.<br />Some people like the Early Beatles because its simple, mindless, and better to rock out to. If you want that, listen to the Ramones. They were simpler, rocked more, not to mention FUNNIER, but they werent teenyboppers! If you want something by the Beatles, look past all of their first five.
0787119164|4.0|I liked this book.  Very similar to Richard Marcinko's Navy SEAL books.  While Richard Marcinko goes into the technicals of warfare, Andy writes a story that is about human side of being  SAS...and along the way we get to watch some good fight sequences.<br /> The story was good, and it didn't seem like Andy was trying to stuff it full of sensational violence or shoot outs. All round very interesting and entertaining. I look forward to reading some of Andy's other work.<br /> I was especially impressed with the orator/story teller (tape version.) He did a great job of putting all the voices together.
1567184855|5.0|This book is a must for those who want to know what it is like where a loved one goes after death.  After losing someone you love, the painful  grief and despair can be eased by this book and more so by michael newton's second book destiny of souls. For those who dont believe it is possible, i say judge for yourself. That is all that can be said.....
0446678430|5.0|This book should have been his first...although I'm not sure it would have made him as popular.  This book is centrally about why you would want to get rich, not how to get rich.  <br />This thought is of extreme importance, and in my opinion is much more instrumental to the development of a person than knowing the methods of getting rich.  <br />I liken this to being in a space ship.  You may know how to turn the wheel (methods of making money), but not knowing where you are going makes that steering wheel useless (knowing why you want to be rich, and preparing your mind for being rich).
0812550757|1.0|Ender's Game is one of my favorite books, but Orson S. Card totally missed the target when he wrote this book and went way off course.  Instead of trying to continue with the Characters, Orson tried to write and invent a new science and new vocabular.  Interesting work, but where are the characters from Ender's Game!!  Don't waste you time, just re-read Ender's Game again and let the story end there!!!!
B00005JKES|5.0|Honestly nothing more can be said about Twin Peaks, it's brilliance has resonated for over a decade now and that is proof enough that this program is a timeless classic. In terms of the DVD Artisan have done a magnificent job that even the most die hard fan has gotta be happy with. I can't wait for the following releases.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|This man has some talent. I am a huge fan of Whiskeytown and also really love his solo work. My favourite songs are &quot;La Cienega Just Smiled&quot;, &quot;When Stars Go Blue&quot; and &quot;Goodnight Hollywood Boulevard.&quot; There is something amazingly heartfelt about his voice - the way it breaks at certain points. Lovely, in a kind of sad, poignant way. Not that the album is all blueness and misery ... And how 'bout his hair? Love it!
B00005OM4N|4.0|I was very suprised by how much i liked this cd. i dont think there are any songs that I don't like at all. I was expecting there to only be a few songs that I liked, but instead I loved almost the whole CD. I especially liked \\"Bombastic Love\\", it has a catch tune and fun lyrics. I highly reccomend this CD, even for people who dont really like Britney.
B000060OFT|1.0|I love this movie and was eagerly antcapting buying this so when I saw a large department store had it on sale at a good price i bought it. I got home only to discover the disc very scratched and the movie not playable without skips every few seconds. I took it back and tried to get another one and opened it in front of the clerk only to find another one in the same condtion. Fox please make your discs better, we deserve atleast a disc without scratches when we buy a movie. I have had problems with many fox discs being this way French Conneection, CAstaway, Mash Five star collection and die hard trilogy box set. People dont let fox take advanatge of you when you get a scratched disc return it and show fox that it will cost them in the long run...
B00005OAIE|4.0|I bought this album after seeing john Mayer on conan O'Brian. He sang \\"No such thing\\" and i just loved it. It was something new and he had really great energy. I'm glad i got the cd, even though i don't have the version with 3x5. The music isn't new but it is done well..and the lyrics, for the most part, are very good. A couple of songs are a little cheesy ( city love and st. patrick's day to be exact) but even they are better than most music on mtv or the radio. Basically if you are a teen like me, and are tired of boy bands and pop diva-wannabes, then you just might like John Mayer. He isnt' terribly original, but he does it right.

B00005JGAB|4.0|The less than five star rating is not to be taken as any reflection on the quality of the music of this debut album by the greatest punk band ever. (That's right all you Enligsh Bob's that includes you too!)  However, you would be wiser to get the two for one sets released awhile back that has this album paired w/ the Ramones Leave Home.  The demo's don't really add too much (heck the songs on this album often sound like demos!).  It's a better bargain.  I think it's called &quot;All the Stuff &amp; More vol. 1).
B000002JNJ|5.0|Once a typical glam metal band, Pantera one day decided to give their image a bit of a make-over. By around 1990, the band was rid of all that hairspray and spandex and was pumped up to release their first major album (fifth album overall) Cowboys From Hell. Not only was it one of Pantera's best albums overall, but also one of tbe best heavy metal albums of the early-nineties. <br />What makes Cowboys From Hell unique is its immense personality. Rather than being all dark and dreary like many other heavy metal albums, Cowboys From Hell is generally quite lively and upbeat. That, of course, isn't to say there aren't a few serious moments. Cemetary Gates is a dark and moody ballad about suicidal thoughts, Shattered is about world destruction due to nuclear war, etc. However, many of the songs have very upbeat tempos and riffs that actually make you want to smile rather than cry. The aformentioned Shattered, for example, has both a sweet groove and an awesome solo. While Psycho Holiday has a very &quot;Make My Day&quot;-esque tone and some intentionally crazy lyrics. <br />The music here is also unique in the sense that Pantera puts a lot of south-western influences in it. The rocking title track definitely deserves its name as it sounds and feels just like a cowboy's song (or more adequately, western bandit's song), Psycho Holiday has a very Clint Eastwood-esque riff, while The Sleep has a positively south-western style acoustic riff which alone makes it worth listening to.<br />Lastly, I want to comment on the excellent production here. Even though compact disks were still at a fairly early stage when this album was released, both its clarity and cleanliness blow away anything ever done on a cassette tape. The guitars come in crisp and clear, while the drums sound as grinding and powerful as ever. This is probably the best production of any Pantera album (both &quot;Glamtera&quot; and current).<br />In brief, I recommend everybody gives Cowboys From Hell a listen. Especially those with a taste for western-type music as well as those looking for a heavy metal album that (for once) doesn't take itself too seriously.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|This IS a &quot;like or dislike&quot; movie. I'm on the dislike side. All the talk about &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; bringing back the musical genre is a bunch of hooey. The songs are relatively recent songs originally recorded by Elton John, Madonna, etc., and with these non-singers attempting them adds even more irritation to watching and listening to this film. The acting is okay, but I don't think it's breakthrough for anyone. After all the hype--and I do like &quot;true&quot; musicals (original songs, etc.)--I was completely disappointed. In fact, I watched it a second time to see if I was missing something. I didn't. Those who praise this movie as a musical haven't seen the great musicals of the past.
0312979479|5.0|Christie has some many books which could be termed \\"her best\\" that the title becomes somewhat cliche. Almost all Christie's book could be considered her ebst, from my personal favourite \\"Death Comes As The End\\", to the one i liked least \\"Passenger to Frankfurt\\" which i am sure many other people loved.<br />All of her books are ingenious, intriguing, and feature a mind-bending puzzle or a fast-paced adventure.<br />This is no exception. this is porobably one of her most famous, and it's easy to see why. it's completely original and the solution is so unexpected...<br />The plot runs at such high speed...there's practically a death per chapter...and each person who pops their clogs is murdered in tune with the rhyme \\"Ten Little Indians\\". there is a subtle build up of suspense and terror until the final two people remain on the small island, isolated from the world, convinced the other is the killer. paranoia runs rife among the final few victims, and when at last the final ones gets it, we think it's all been sorted out. but oh no.<br />In the final chapter christie pulls of a brilliant twist, and one that i totally did not see coming. she really pulls the wool over the readers eyes.<br />a very enjoyable book. highly reccomended
B00003CXXP|5.0|I have been very disappointed with the reviews of this movie until I saw it, and then I understood!! It is a movie that you either love or hate and there seems to be no middle ground. Some have said it is too long, the story line is bad, the special effects are lackluster, and only Osment and Law are good. They are probably right, what do I know. I am a movie buff, but hey, I liked - Gone With The Wind - How The West Was Won - To Kill A Mockingbird and hated Citizen Kane. <br />So for what it is worth here is how it affected me. I was quickly pulled into the story and found it a journey very much like the Wizard of Oz and other quests to find our true identity. In this world of possible cloning of human beings and other life, I found the story plausible, but most of all associated with the overall theme of the piece, which I saw not only to be a quest for identity, but love. <br />To me, the movie presented how much love can move our world and more important can move us as human beings, even if we appear to be robots. There are many portrayed in this movie that lack love. The parents, the boy robots maker, the overall outside world. Also, there is another theme, no less important. Not being loveable because you are different. So as these themes emerged this movie more and more held my attention. <br />Then came homelessness. Few assoicate with that, and of those who watch this movie, I would wager to say, they have never been homeless. Then there is seperation and lonliness and fear, and the overiding desire to be like others so we can be loved in return. <br />People have slept through this movie, and I would imagaine those same people sleep through life. None of the above is really important because we have become too self-sufficient to see a need for each other, to feel the loving touch of another, and to be nurtured by another, and most of all, to return the love we are given. We were all hit September 11th and taken down in a great way by our own technology, asare the people in this story. <br />For a while we banded together and love on the streets, to the homeless, to the lonely became important. Now we are back and it is ok to hate again. Ok, to pull others apart as the robots are pulled apart in this movie. <br />But not all. There are still heros. There are still people who reach out, and there are still those for whom the words - I love you - are the most important words in the world. To me, that is what this movie is about. That is what not only this boy robot wants, but we all do, if we stop to admit it. For awhile we did. For awhile we gave it in great abundance. For this movie, most of these loving people do not show up until 2,000 years after our species have gone. <br />So I cried in this movie, more than any other. I cried for the boy who wanted to be loved, and wanted to give love. I cried for the robots who were created different and brought into a society that only sought to destroy them. I cried for the teddy bear who followed along faithfully and asked nothing, only to stay around, and I cried for a society that sometimes pushes love away, or sadly, never reaches for it at all. <br />But hey, what do I know - my all time favorite movie is - To Kill A Mockinbird - it says a lot about love, a lot about being different and a lot about hatred. I put this movie along side it and hope that one day it gets the recognition it deserves. Tall order, but not an artifical one.<br />Just for the record - also thought the special effects were great. The sound wonderful, the score good, and the DVD picture at times breathtaking.
B00005JKT8|4.0|\\"Kate and Leopold,\\" directed by James Mangold, combines a time-travel plot device with a sweet comic romance. Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman play the title characters, a contemporary research and marketing executive and a 19th century nobleman.<br />Although Ryan is effective, it's Jackman's performance that really carries the film. He is marvelously funny and charming in his \\"fish-out-of-water\\" role. Those who are fans of Jackman's moody, intense performance as Wolverine in \\"X-Men\\" will be in for a stunning surprise if they see him as this witty, cultured character. In addition to nice interplay with Ryan, Jackman also has a great \\"buddy\\" chemistry with Breckin Meyer in a supporting role.<br />Liev Schreiber brings unexpected depth to his largely comic supporting role. His character's speech explaining a scientific epiphany is particularly good. \\"Kate and Leopold\\" is a pretty light film, but it's quite satisfying.
1577311523|5.0|Reading this book changed my thinking and perception about what it means to be joyful and how one gets there. It is too often that we become so concerned with what was or what is yet to be, that we forget what it means to stay in the moment. Tolle, in his simple description, gives all of us a very powerful and meaningful message about how to stay in the present. His use of examples as well as exercises focuses the mind on how to stop the chatter that seems to run endlessly between our two ears.<BR>I am so very grateful for the perspective put forward in this book. It has changed my thinking and my being all for the better.
B00005QZ7U|4.0|'Moulin Rouge!' is perhaps one of the years best films for a number of reasons. The first is that finally someone had the guts to remake the musical for a post-millenium audience. The post-modern eclecticism of the film may be off-putting to many, but those who can see past the amazing costume, wild music and often disorientating cutting will love the film.<br />We're in Paris at the turn of the century; the Bohemian revolution is taking the world by storm. We meet our young, heart strong protagonist Christian (Ewan McGregor) crying over his lost love. But wait! Hello now we're inside the Moulin Rouge, a nightclub where the rich and powerful mingle with the dark and beautiful. And everyone seems to be doing the 'Can-can' to Nirvana's 'Smells like teen spirit'... sound confusing? Well it is, and for good reason.<br />The film is essentially a love story, two star crossed lovers who are forced together by inextricable circumstances. This is coupled with Christian's efforts to win the heart of the sparkling diamond Satine (Nicole Kidman) however they must overcome an obstacle in order for their love to be recognized, and that is the Duke (Richard Roxbourgh). The film is a tragedy like many musical endings but the film's director Baz Luhrman has completely subverted the genre by adding a postmodern element.<br />Through using pop culture and mass marketing Luhrman makes a strong point about the problems with it. Thus the film is imbued with elements of Bollywood through the Hindi dance in `Spectacular, spectacular' this splicing of styles allows Luhrman to convey much more meaning than if he had directed `Moulin Rouge' as a straight modern musical.<br />20th century Fox has truly gone to town in presenting this amazing DVD. The number of commentary tracks as well as the green fairy version of the film (much like the White rabbit presentation on the Matrix DVD) is enough to make the fans drool. However it is in the second disc where some of the most in depth features available on any DVD can be found. Interviews with cast, crew, featurettes galore, and a host of Easter eggs truly make this DVD a benchmark of what we can hope DVD's will be realized as in the future.<br />The transfer is flawless onto the DVD format. The crystal clear picture is the best way to look at the vibrant, elaborate costumes and the Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack is utterly amazing and makes the viewer feel like they are part of the film.<br />Overall `Moulin Rouge' is a sumptuous feast of vibrant color, elaborate set and opulent costume. It really has to be seen to be believed and is one of those films that if you haven't seen, needs to be seen for nothing more than pure spectacle.
0451167716|4.0|The Godfather by Mario Puzo was written over thirty years ago, and it is still widely read and enjoyed.  It's a classic of its time, and our time as well.  This classic novel is about an Italian family who's &quot;family business&quot; is importing olive oil.  The family secret underworld business is associated with organized crime, the Mob.  I enjoyed reading about this family who lives in crime and has excellent family values.  Puzo is a genius for organizing the book the way he did.  I recommend this book to anyone and everyone.  The movie was well produced and executed also, but does not compare to the novel, the movie does not cover everything in the novel.
0440219078|5.0|This book is about a young boy named Jonas who lives in a perfect organized world.  In this world everyone is assigned a role.  When Jonas was twelve he received the highest honor in the community, the job he was assigned to was \\"Receiver of Memory\\".  Jonas's new job description was that he would bare the memories of the town and the world before the community was formed in order to protect the people.  He has a specific ability to see color and that is how he was chosen for the job.  Jonas meets with the old receiver, now called \\"The Giver\\", everyday in order for him to give him all the memories good and bad.  After receiving most of the memories Jonas began to feel a great burden and understand the truth about this utopian society.  Jonas knew the injustice and horror that occurred in order to keep the society in this \\"perfect\\" condition.  Jonas believed that the memories he was receiving should belong to the people.  He and the Giver think up a plan that will ensure Jonas's escape from the community and the return of all the memories.  With his leaving the community the memories the Giver had given him would be released into the minds of all the residents of the community.  It was the only way to change the communities understanding.<BR> I loved Lois Lowry's imagination in creating this story.  She allows everyone when reading this book to examine their own values on controversial issues in their own society and indirectly challenges them to change the issues.<BR> I loved this book for its brilliant story.  I really do feel that you get something different from it whenever you read it.  I read this book in sixth or seventh grade and I did not get as much out of it as I did now.  I loved following Jonas through the story.  You could so easily imagine the society due to the very elaborate descriptions Lowry gave.  An excellent story.
6305014140|5.0|From proclaimed anime director Yoshiaki Kawajiri &quot;who gave us anime like biohunter,wicked city and the new vampire hunter&quot;<BR>brings us his masterpiece complete with a nice digital masterd version.<BR>     What all can I say if you havn't seen this then you havn't wacthed anime.It's what all other anime wish it was,its what we anime fans try to compare everything to&quot;we need to stop,they'll never be another Ninja Scroll&quot; <BR>          Technically the dvd is a great remasterd version with a great 5.1. The picture quality is also really good.Thankyou Kawajiri for all the great anime,especially this one!
B000059XUO|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies for Generation X.  The soundtrack is an iconic look of grunge music of the 90's.  The movie itself is dark, and a bit depressing, but has it's morosely humorous moments and is very quotable.  Not for the kids.  <br />Basic storyline:  Eric Draven and his wife are murdered on Devil's Night (the night before Halloween, and thier wedding day).  One year later Eric is resurected to avenge his murder. <BR> <BR>Some notable things: Brandon Lee (Bruce Lee's son) was killed on the set during shooting.  This movie used several breakthrough digital effects to fill in the missing scenes.  The end credits dedicate the move it Brandon and Eliza.  Eliza was Brandon's soon to be wife.  <br />This movie is a must.  I watch this movie every Oct 30th.  It holds up very well to viewing over and over.  If you are a fan of the movie, the special edition with deleted scenes and making of documentary are worth the extra cash.
6304493681|5.0|If you wanna impress your friends with some nice anime this should be your first choice.The plot is deep but understandingly good,I don't wanna give away any of the story so I'll stick with the basics.It blends perfectly hand drawn with computer graphics like nothing I've seen to date,the action is fast paced and nicely choreographed.The music is \\"fantastic\\"it fits each scene perfect.The digitaly masterd dvd is better than most hollywood shot dvds I have in my collection,with a nice crisp picture and the sound,man the sounds great with digital 5.1 that sounds more like a fine DTS filling the rear surround speakers nice and loudly but well balanced with the front.The speacial features are not so shabby either with a good \\"Making of Ghost ia a Shell\\"that includes interviews with director Oshii and other production staff.It also includes a complete production report,and some good interactive menus.Did I mention its in widescreen 1.85:1 SUH! Do ya think thats enough?<br />  Nowonder James Cameron speaks so highly of this anime its something that fits his movie stlye well!
B00004RJ74|5.0|This is one of my favorite films, it combines the raw kinetic action stylings of Robert Rodriguez (Desperado, The Faculty) with the dialogue and character writing skills of Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, True Romance) in a gore filled splatterfest that no film has yet to live up to. It features George Clooney in he breakout role as Seth Gecko, escaped convict, bank robber, murderer. Seths brother Richard (played by the films scribe Quentin Tarantino) broke him out of jail, they then made their way across country and down to the boarder... As much praise as I can give this film I can also say that this film does have a few flaws. Theres somewhat of a dichotemy when Seth is the big tough guy who takes no [stuff] from anyone is punched out by Jacob, and old man preacher, Seth stands up and retaliates in no way and almost apoligizes. I found that to be rather annoying and one of my all time top ten movie screw ups... This film also features an annoying chinese kid, with a clearly white american father (I'm not racist nor is this a racist comment but...) but his reasons for having the father he had were never revealed. The boy did also backfired on him, every time he tried to act tough or do something heroic he was stomped thouroghly. This I found to get a little old after his third attempt to protect his sister and he's smacked across the room. All in all I give this film 5 stars because it truely is one of the great films of all time... at least in my humble oppinion.
B000002MFE|5.0|If you ask me studio albums are great and all, but if you ask me the true test of an artist is can they release a great live album. 'Cuz when you're on that stage no producer or Take Two is gonna save you from your mistakes. Unplugged was merely an extension of this, with no amps or distortion peddles to give you some breathing room. Enter Eric Clapton.<BR>This is Eric Clapton at his finest, and a true testament to his abilities as a guitar player. While his previous albums suffered from an often slick and overpolished production, this performance captures Clapton stripped down to the basics, an accoustic guitar, bass, percussion, and backup singers.<br />The setting obviously was perfect for Clapton. This is not only Clapton doing the basics but also being more passionate, emotional, and creative than he has in years. Tears in Heaven is the ultimate tearjerker, considering the song's context. Only an artist of his talent could have recreated a song like Layla to become almost jazz improvisation. (And the new version was almost as successful as the old one!) The album's introduction (Signe) was very classical. It's refreshing to see Clapton going back to the accoustic blues on songs like Before You Accuse Me, Hey Hey, and Walking Blues (which I swear sounds like the great Robert Johnson himself). He even takes songs like Old Love and Running on Faith and injects with more emotion.<br />There is no doubt about it. This is Clapton's finest. Never does he stumble, and he plays the guitar perfect to the last note.  There are performances here (Tears in Heaven, Layla) that have earned their place in history and for good reason. For all those into live music or Eric Clapton I insist you buy this today!
B00003CXPJ|5.0|Zoolander is a hilariously, goofball comeday about the fashion world.  Try not to analyze it and enjoy the laugh-a-minute romp.<BR>Will Farrell is a scene stealer.  Ben Stiller & Owen are a great comedy team.  The DVD menus are the best I've seen in awhile.<BR>The extras are terrific as well.  Great movie!  Forget the critics!
B00005V9HH|5.0|It's because of this movie that Kevin Spacey is my favorite actor.  His performance as Verbal Kint is mesmorizing.  After seeing this move, you too will ask, \\"Who is Keyser Soze?\\".  It's not an action packed film, so be patient.  Once the plot unravels, you'l be hooked.  I guarantee it.  Great actors turning in great performances in a great movie.  What else can one ask??
0375703764|5.0|Better than  honey. Better than snow. Better than Hemingway. No lie.
0452282152|5.0|There was a time when I thought I might be an art historian<BR>or an art critic - then I discovered that I was an artist, and <BR>began to dislike art analysis - which I came to think <BR>of as irrelevant.  And I became amused by<BR>the novelization of artists' lives, because there, too, I felt<BR>the artist was secondary to the work.<br />However, this book is, truly, a pearl...it captures beautifully the  concept of how a work of art is conceived...of how the<BR>artist's imagination is separate from his or her every day life.<br />I was particularly gratified that the author &quot;got&quot; that an artist<BR>will rarely use those closest to him/her as subject matter.  <BR>And that can be a no-win situation.  I know wives and lovers<BR>who have appeared in the artist's works, and they are angered overexposure.  And then there are others,<BR>like Vermeer's wife in this story, who are jealous of their mates' muses.<br />That is just one of the dilemmas of an artist shown in this novel.  I loved the simplicity, the setting, the characters, the details.  It made 17th Century Delft come alive.  They say a  movie is being made of the book.  I thought that Uma Thurman would be perfect as Madame Vermeer.
B000001DTM|5.0|I admit it, I'm a u2 fanatic. I have loved them since I was born, they've been a huge part of my life (being an Irish girl myself)... I own at least 1 or 2 copies of all their CD's, but this one is by FAR the best. Although I love Joshua Tree and the different style of Zooropa, Achtung Baby is a collection of some of the deepest, wildest, most meaningful songs out there. With the Edge's wild guitar, BONOs unforgettable lyrics and voice, and the free, honest attitude of these amazing Irish boys, this is a CD you can't hear just once. <BR>My favorite song in the world is &quot;One&quot;, but Mysterious Ways is up there. There are so many moods on this CD, and the lyrics are easy to relate to and touch so many people. If you're a fan of Pearl Jam, REM, Rolling Stones, the Beatles, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sublime, or any of todays &quot;pop rock&quot;, you will love this CD. Hell, if you are a fan of ANY good music you'll love this cd! Get it for a friend! Get it for your kids! Get it for yourself! Just get it!
B0000630YA|5.0|With Alice coming out with his new band and Bob Ezrin at the helm,this remaster is worthy of ownership. The alternative tracks are from the TV special &quot;The Nightmare&quot; with Vincent Price and these alone make it so special. With different lyrics and vocal mix, these are even more haunting. If you have a sense of fidelity, you will appreciate the high quality.                 A &quot;desert Island&quot; choice for all rock fans!
B00003CXXP|4.0|I saw A.I. in the theater on opening weekend and was actually disappointed in the movie's ending (I thought it should have ended with the Blue Fairy).  However, in the months since I've developed a fondness for the story, and its ending, and after purchasing the DVD and watching it again, A.I. has become one of my favorites.  It is an incredible story, once you grasp the extent of its message, and a truly beautiful film to watch and experience.  Both Haley Joel Osment and Jude Law deliver remarkable performances, and John Williams tops it off with a wonderful musical score that will tug at your heartstrings as the film reaches its end.<br />The DVD is of exceptional quality, both in sound and video.  The DTS sound is especially clear and lifelike.  The bonus features disc is packed with short segments that highlight virtually every aspect of the movie's story and the effort that went into its production.  It's a high-quality production, as you would expect from Steven Spielberg.
B00005Y228|5.0|Kylie is back with her best album to date. This the best disco/pop album I ever heard. Every song has its own individual style. The more you listen to them the more they grow on you. The album contains such musical gems like Fever(title track), In your eyes, Love affair, Love at first sight, Can't get you out of my head (1st single) and the funky Give it to me. This isn't any ordinary pop album with lots of ballads: This album was made to get you moving. It is almost impossible not to dance when you listen to it. So I don't advise you to listen to this when you go to bed. Every song on this album is so wonderful I can guarantee you there is not a single boring moment. Very useful when you're doing extremly boring work, just listen to it and time will fly by. If only I could rate this album a million stars. I recommend that you buy this album. It is ESSENTIAL.
B00005RYKU|5.0|With the exception of JOY RIDE and THE GLASS HOUSE, most modern thrillers use gore and loud bursts of music to startle the audience. This film is a refreshing trip back to the world of suspense.<br />With a modern-day 'Hansel &amp; Gretel'-type plot, this is an interesting and creepy movie that you MUST watch in the dark!
B00004CWO8|3.0|Firstly, although the technical side - the camerawork, editing and sound - are excellent, this isn't Swan Lake.   It might have a relation to Swan Lake just as West Side Story has to Romeo and Juliet, but why call it Swan Lake when it isn't?   Secondly, evidently through lack of research on my part, I bought it not realising it was a gay adaptation.  That in itself is no problem - however, I found the dancing to be less sensuous than one might expect of males in modern dance (e.g, Alvin Ailey, Merce Cunningham (in particular, 'Pond Life', 'Biped' and of course, Points in Space) and the Royal Danish Ballet with works like Firebird (Stravinsky). <BR>To that extent it was a disappointment.   There were moments when I was reduced to near laughter, particularly around the Dance of the little swans (or whatever it is in this adaptation) which echoed Monty Python in my view.   If one is to have little male swans, surely they can be LITTLE.   One should not expect full-sized males to carry off the delicacy and airy lightness of young female ballerinas.<BR>In short, a nice try and no doubt inspirational and appealing to those not already immersed in modern dance.
B0000027RL|5.0|Well, the title ought to imply that I highly enjoy Pearl Jam's work. It does, because I do. I bought this album (late for the release, early for my generation) as the third Pearl Jam CD I've bought. In terms of how the truely good/talented/genius groups get started, this ought to be one such marker. Aside from a lot of fan filler-crap that I could hand you, all I can say is that this album follows a pattern depicted by the King of cards in Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland: \\"Begin at the beginning,\\" the King said gravely. \\"Then continue until you reach the end. Then stop.\\" This is very true of this album. It starts off and goes without any real let-downs. I think I'll always be partial to this album.
B00004SCX6|1.0|I can't deny that she has a good voice, its obvious that she does. She has great talent, but talent can only take you so far. I was very disappointed with the way Britney flaunts herself with her sexuality... <br />Shortly after buying this cd I've broken it and threw it away. Its a little too teenybopperish for me. I'm sick of listening to Britney and watch her prance around like some little madonna wannabe. I'm sorry I ever wasted my money on this cd.<br />When people buy cd's, videos, games, food, etc. The money that they buy a thing supports the company, artists, corporation, etc. I don't want to support Britney with my money since cd's are expensive.  I want to support artists that I like for their music, and that I respect.<br />This is why I don't listen to Britney Spears anymore. I can't respect her or support her with my hard earned money. I now opt to listen to Stacie Orrico. Who respects herself, while still singing cool pop songs, that have depth.
B000002BBY|5.0|If you are doubting about buying this CD I say to you that you need to buy it because this is one of the best album for all the time. It has rock, rock 'n' roll and brit-pop. It has a lot of classics inside, like 'Wonderwall', 'Don't look back in anger', 'Champagne supernova'...<BR>I love this album!
B00005UW7V|3.0|AI is a worthwhile film and it includes some good acting and interesting thoughtful elements, although the last sequence is a bit silly and screams of some kind of budget crisis possiby, I enjoyed it and would recommend it.
B00005JKED|2.0|Training Day begins with such promise.  Unfortunately, the potential of the story and the great acting are wasted by a convoluted trip through an utterly implausable plot.  A true shame.  By the second act one is left feeling cheated and further jaded by Hollywood's inability to make motion pictures in this genre realistic and believable.  <br />The exposition of the film fills the viewer with optimism that one hell of a ride awaits.  I was excited that what I was getting into what was going to be a film on par with some of the cops and robbers masterpieces (Heat for example).  Washington is nearly perfect as the narco-detective interviewing eager beaver Ethan Hawke (who suprisingly holds his own for the first 45 minutes) for a slot on an elite dectective squad by taking him on a \\"Training Day\\".  However, one must suspend one's disbelief early on - and so frequently thereafter, that any viewer with the slightest conception of police procedures will quickly begin to pick the movie apart - instead of enjoy it.  For example:<br />1)  Maybe you believe that the young Hawke would smoke pot/PCP to prove his loyalty to Washington's unit but,<BR>2)  Washington's character doesn't answer to anyone.  He soon gets into a gun fight with not less than 10 gang members, after stealing 40K by using a chinese take-out menu as a search warrant, and drives away in his custom low-rider Monte Carlo with only three symetrical holes in the rear window.  No follow up investigation, no reports to file - this guy is on his own.<BR>3)  Next we meet Washington's mystery friend (Scott Glenn) who provides some liquor and wisdom.  Unfortunately, we never find out who he is, until the unit returns later (ostensibly to serve a felony warrant..without backup, air support, transportation, etc.) to kill him and dig up $3 million from underneath his kitchen.  Question - why would this renegade group take an unproven Hawke with them?  Just send him home and say see you tomorrow.  Instead, they provide him with an opportunity to witness the nonsense.  In for a penney...<BR>4)  Ultimately Washington must deliver some of the loot to even more mysterious \\"Russians\\" by midnight, if he fails he's dead.  <br />Needless to say so is \\"Training Day\\" from about scene 3 on.
0743420373|5.0|The Millionaire Next Door is a book that will completely change a person's way of viewing the wealthy who reside in the US. It paints an accurate and indepth picture of the true millionaires of our country and how they became that way. The book is very straight forward with lots of statistics, which at times can be tedious, and anecdotes that help explain the different concepts presented in the book. Anyone who reads this book will take a lot away from it and will want to explore the area of affluency and economics in general in greater depth. There were times I could not and did not want to put the book down just because I wanted to learn more and see what it is was I could do to get myself on the path to financial independence. The book is wonderful in the sense that it is well-organized, repeats the most important ideas so that you do not forget them, and makes a very important note that anyone who is dedicated, hardworking, and plays both &quot;offense and defense&quot; has the ability to become financially independent and truely wealthy. Overall this book is brilliant and I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn what it takes to become an affluent member of our community. I would definitely recommend this book to teens and young adults since it will have the most influence on them and interest them greatly since they want to know how to make the most money possible. Anyone who reads this book will not be disappointed and will learn a lot from it.
B00005YT8U|3.0|This album comes across as so phony. I could not BELIEVE what I was hearing. Complete with the currently popular &quot;mystical&quot; effects from Riverdance, it dumbs down this great traditional music and reduces it to the most obvious devices to pull audience strings. (And I love the Riverdance album! Just, not what they did in here!) I was shocked to hear such superb musicians as Sinead, Ricky and others doing such unabashedly CHEESY renditions of this great, original, rich music. The vibrant tapestry one associates with the Chieftans is completely absent.
B00005RYQO|2.0|I'll admit I liked this better than I expected, but that's not saying much.  This movie is loaded with superb action shots that took a lot of stunt coordination to pull off well.  I mean, how many movies are going to show a car driving UNDER a moving truck?  While street racing does exist, it is unlikely that it's THIS organized, but these are the movies and you want to see something exiting, which the movie does provide with the races.<br />However, the rest of it is ordinary, and if you are watching at home, put a bucket under your set to catch all the excess testosterone that drips from the screen.  For the movie makes it clear that this particular world is a man's world.  A woman's job, even for the tough talking ones, is to remain slim, attractive, scantily-clad, and available upon demand.  <br />One of the the things that turned me off when the film first came out was the name Vin Diesal.  It sounds manufactured by a committee to get young males to buy tickets.  But I went back to his credits, and found that he did have good roles in films I liked (&quot;Boiler Room&quot;, &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;, and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;).  And there is no doubt he oozes a lot of charisma along with that testosterone.  I'm looking forward to see what he can do in the future.
B00003CXXP|5.0|This film is an emotional roller coaster ride. Perhaps people with younger children would be affected most deeply in all areas.<BR>The future depicted is both fascinating and disturbing at the same time. While the jump from David's abandonment to the introduction of Joe and the &quot;mecha&quot; world is a bit bumpy, the film as a whole is engrossing.<BR>The mother's role is very well played, you can feel the war of emotions in every instance. She clearly does not want to love this robotic child, but is helpless to do otherwise.<BR>Haley Joel Osment is a joy to watch. This young boy only grows stronger in his craft, and I find myself marveling that he is still a child. His actions were unerring, and the initial bonding with the human mother was startling and actually made me cry, as it was something my own daughter would do. The interesting thing is, that at no time does this boy drop into completely human behaviour. You always feel he is robotic beneath the surface.<BR>The ending is quite emotional, he acheives his goal and yet it is incredibly sad. This film is very much worth the purchase price.
0060987464|4.0|Well some nice background stories and some nice things he has done in his life...and what happened around him. That's what you get!<br />You get to read about a part of his life....the beginning, the tours...the drugs and women.

B00005OWIU|5.0|I love this CD! it has awesome music on it! I listen to it all the time. One problem I had with  it tho, is it all sounds the same. But its all cool, so its ok! Harry Potter fans, you gotta get this!
6304493681|5.0|This is the Kind of DVD that screams out to be bought. For a good reason, the quality of the animation, the story and the character development are atleast as good as Akira.<br />This movie is one of those Manga Movies you must have. It's a story I could watch 3 times and stil see new things. The final idea behind the story is....refreshing. This movie is unlike many others...this belongs in the TOP of DVD's

0671042858|4.0|The Girl who loved Tom Gordon<br />By, Steven King<br />The girl who loved Tom Gordon, by Steven King, is a book for readers who are looking for adventure. In this book nine-year-old Trisha wonders into the woods while on a hike with her bickering mother and brother. She just wanted to get away. Her parents had just recently divorced, and her and her brother were not too happy about it.<br /> After getting of the trail, Trisha tries to take a short cut, but ends up getting lost in this unknown world. She survives on only the little lunch that she brought and anything she can find. Her plan, after finding a stream, is to follow it to civilization. This plan didn't work out too well though.<br /> She went through many journeys and difficult pearls along her way. While in the woods she feels as something is stalking her, watching her. Only her best instinct and hope can help her find her way.<br /> I would recommend this book to people who like adventure novels. This book had a variety of different subject that can attract many young readers like myself. Tom Gordon is a baseball player. Trish is a baseball fan, so the book speaks of baseball in many situations. People who are interested in baseball could most likely enjoy this book. I just hope whoever reads this book after me enjoys it as much as I did.
B000002UAF|4.0|This is the first cd that will make sense to a younger person who just bought the  &quot;Number 1 &quot;   cd. The other stuff( &quot;Meet the ..., and Please Please Me&quot;) is just too old sounding to modern ears .  The songs on here are great and catching.  I like &quot;If  I fell&quot; and &quot;Cant Buy me love&quot; and &quot;I love her&quot; but its all good.
B000003S5H|5.0|I first heard of Air through a friend; I listened to a few songs and dismissed them. I later came across them again and I started to enjoy them more and more until I finally decided to buy Moon Safari.  Plain and simple, it's my favorite album of all time.  These are just my opinions, of course.  Moon Safari magically seem to trancend musical grooves from many a different era and smoothly transfix you into their beats.  If you have't heard track #3 All I Need, you're definately missing out.  It's a song that makes you reminsce and smile.  All in all, music perfection.
0780021150|5.0|I am a fan of Fritz Lang, but not a fan of murder films.  However, the Lang faniship overwhelmed my aversion to these crime films.  I think what keeps me back is the gore.  I think that depicted gore deadens your higher sensibilities.  By the way, I work in a hospital, so it is not squeamishness son my part.<br />The key to this movie is Fritz Lang's incomparable eye.  He has the palace and artistic symmetry that would have made him a great Renaissance and Baroque artist.  Each scene is a masterpiece and a work of art.  This cinematography is a dying art in the film industry, focusing on computer generated gimmicks and machine gun profanity to carry the film along.  His style reminds us of Orson Welles, Gregg Toland, and Alfred Hitchcock.  Film is primarily visual, and Lang exploits this primary dimension of filmwork to its utmost.<br />The black and white aspect to this film is powerful.  Admittedly, black and white originally was to due to the poor technology, but it has advantages that color lacks.  You feel shadows, and taste the darkness.  For example, in Lorre's first scene, you just see his silhouette in shadow whistling \\"In the Hall of the Mountain King.\\"  This creates an almost hysterical sense of suspense. You know someone is bad, but you don't see him.  He becomes a phantom menace of colossal proportions.  This film is almost a moving study of Ansel Adams gone psycho!<br />This film, however, is not mere eye-candy, but it raises many ethical situations.  The plot is that a kiddy murderer is on the loose in Germany, so the cops crack down on all criminals.  Realizing that their craft is in danger, the criminal underground unties in a sort of \\"thief's honor,\\" and tries to take care of the murderer on their own.  The film climaxes as the underworld capture the murderer and hold a trial on their own.  The entire situation raises so many questions about ethics, morals, honor, and vigilantism.<br />The only drawback is that this talkie is in German, so your eye is constantly darting down to the dialogue.<br />I am glad that this DVD is out and this profound film will get more exposure.  Yes, there was life before \\"Titanic,\\" and we have much to learn from these classic filmmakers.is constantly darting down to the dialogue.<br />I am glad that this DVD is out and this profound film will get more exposure.

0307120007|5.0|I absolutely love this book!!!!! I remember my parents reading it to me when I was a little one. I used to tote it around wherever I went, and I hope my baby will cherish it as much as I did!! What great memories
B00004XONN|5.0|This is an excellent CD and its sad that it on has four stars. Best CD of 2000 by far.
B000002KKD|5.0|So many people have tried to sum up this album, and, even reading the reviews here, I have come to the conclusion that it's impossible to sum up. This superb masterpiece from those funky bohemians from Athens, Georgia, was an offbeat, otherworldly, 3rd dimensional oddity that was truly unique in 1979, and, 23 years later, is still an amazing, one of a kind album. If this album is not in your collection, then you couldn't possibly be a &quot;serious&quot; collector. Although the obvious and most common adjectives to describe this debut are along the lines of, &quot;wacky&quot; &quot;funny&quot; and &quot;goofy,&quot; most critics forget to mention what great musicians they are. This band created some of the tightest and funkiest rythym since James Brown in his heydeys. Sure, their lyrics and vocals were intentionally &quot;tongue in cheek,&quot; but that music was the work of seriously gifted artists, hellbent on making you shake your rump. Ricky Wilson's guitar work never ceases to amaze me, nor does Kate Pierson's phenominal work on the keyboards. I could rattle on and on about this album, but trust me.....just buy it !  This album earned it's classic status the hard way and strictly on it's own merits, proving that something great will endure the test of time. A very deserving 5 star effort.
B00003CXXO|5.0|Any science fiction that abstains from the perfunctory space battles and photon death rays deserves the stamp of \\"remarkable.\\"  The films \\"Gattaca\\" and \\"Bladerunner,\\" and the novel \\"Dhalgren\\" are examples of such daring outside the genre conventions, whilst still delving deep into the human condition.  But no sci-fi movie I've seen to date measures the profundity of \\"AI\\".  It took fifteen years in the planning from one of the most disturbing minds of the twentieth century (Stanley Kubrick), and throughout its two hour, twenty minute run, it provides a mixture of eye candy (astounding special effects) and a sphinx-like musings over what it really means to be human: to live and to die; to give and receive love.  <BR><BR>In part, the movie seems to be asking, \\"Are we nothing more than circuits ourselves?\\"  Does David's mother really love him, or does she only love what he does for her.  It is not a question, as stated in the beginning of a movie, of whether humans can ever truly love \\"mecha\\", but whether love (in the spiritual sense we've known it since time inmemorial) even exists at all.  <BR><BR>As for our existence, from the opening scenes we get a clear idea that this is Kubrick's (not Spielberg's) world that we are entering.  The world is dying because of our own improvidence.  This is what I especially loved about \\"AI\\": unlike in the vision of the \\"Star Trek\\" series and movies, human beings have not miraculously forgotten how to hate, how to betray, how to murder, how to destroy.  All our vices and evils still exist a hundred thirty years in the future as they have existed since the dawn of civilization.  It may be a bit mysanthropic to say that because our flaws are so fundamental, we can never hope to escape them.  But in an age where people think they can solve problems by flying planes into buildings or blasting a whole country to pieces, it seems terrifyingly true.  <BR><BR>That, however, is the most definite statement made in \\"AI.\\"  The rest is left for the mind to puzzle over.  And this is a commendable thing, and it is a worthy homage Spielberg pays to Kubrick in not spoon-feeding the audience.  <BR><BR>I understand that this dark aspect (and the out there ending) earned plenty of ire from several reviewers.  But given our track record here on Earth so far, I find it hard to argue against the film's bleaker sensibilities, and the ending seems particularly appropriate.  <BR><BR>The combination of Spielberg's directing and Kubrick's vision have created a masterpiece.  Spielberg's occasional tendencies toward jejune spectacle is left out, as is some of Kubrick's more devastating existentialism.  All actors give marvelous performances, but none more so than Haley Joel Osment, who must simultaneously hold in his emotions and convey the desperation of a machine who wants to feel.  Not easy.  <BR><BR>This movie will probably always weigh on my consciousness.  And if you're one who likes to be challenged rather than be merely predictably entertained, \\"AI\\" constitutes must-see cinema.  If I could, I would give it ten stars.
B000002I57|5.0|For each of these gentleman, they are giants own their own merits but are certainly better known in the context of each of their quartets (MJQ and JCQ). These rare treats, however, show a much different, much more personal side. They seem to just have some good ol' fashion fun on this album and seem to try and out do each other's &quot;bluesiness&quot;. Whenever you find either of these giants &quot;steppin' out&quot; on their groups and collaborating with someone (i.e. Jackson and Davis; Jackson and Charles, Jr.; Coltrane and Garland; Coltrane and Dameron; Coltrane and Hartmann) buy it and consider yourself one of the lucky ones.
B00003CY0U|4.0|Travolta does villain great and in this one he`s bad, but, not evil.He touts a noble cause, though his methods are way out of bounds.Hally Berry is well suited for her role even if her nude scene is not well placed. Having it latter in the wired scene might have worked better.Hugh Jackman is the glue of this movie.There is some stretching of reality in his computing abilities, but Stan is fun character.I liked this movie even with it`s short comings.
B00005QIPH|5.0|It's the late 60's and as Lester Bangs would have said, Rock is Dead. But is it? Well not if the new album by The Strokes &quot;Is This It&quot; has anything to say about it. You think the single &quot;Last Night,&quot; is good? Well that is the tip of the proverbial iceberg. Put on your leather jacket, throw some grease in your hair and take a walk with me into the past ... I mean the future. <BR>The title track draws you in slowly, and singer Julian Casablancas' whine pulls you right down to where he is, sprawled across the floor asking the question Is This It? A bit slower than the other tracks, this song is compact, to the point and enjoyable, a really nice little tune that will end up on some mixed CD's I'm sure of it. The Modern Age however immediately grabs you by the scruff of the neck and says this is rock and roll. A bit repetitious that could end up bad news if it got over played on the radio, Casablancas' croon is just spot on here. This guy has got talent written all over him, a cross between Jim Morrison, Joey Ramone and Morrissey. Yes I just said Morrissey. <br />Soma, Barely Legal, and Someday all really rock nicely. You get a very distinct feeling what this band sounds like live from this album. These guys paint a very good picture of what life should be or what they would like it to be. Sure I guess this is a happy album, I mean it rocks but it's happy, and maybe that's one of the reasons it's good. It's not someone complaining about their father beating them or growing up poor. Wouldn't it be nice if this style caught on?<br />The guitar work on Alone Together just rocks, this is what rock n roll is people, at its best. The vocals swoop in after the solo and Casablancas just takes it up a notch and the song finishes perfectly. The single Last Night is great as we are all hearing, a good tune to get these guys noticed. My least favorite track Hard to Explain is just that, a bit much for me but it would be too much to ask for a perfect album. Casablancas channels Jim Morrison for track When It Started. Jeff Martin should watch this guy. Trying Your Luck and Take It Or Leave It are two really good songs, a really great way to end the album. This really is an outstanding album start to finish, these guys seriously rock.<br />Honestly people we've all been waiting for the next big thing, something to come in and wipe the stale taste of Grunge and Alternative out of our mouths. Well we asked the question and The Strokes have answered. Is This It?
B00005Y228|5.0|Kylie Minogue unleashes a tour de force mixing sultry with sophistication! Nevermind the already huge hit &quot;Can't get you out of my head&quot;, this album is definitely for those who live to dance - or who dance to live! Provocative and stunning, this is a must for music lovers everywhere. Recommended tracks: &quot;Fragile&quot;, &quot;Burning Up&quot;, some song on Track 3 :)and &quot;Love at First Sight&quot;. Great singer, great sounds, great album! You won't be able to get this CD &quot;out of your head&quot;!
B00005RFAI|5.0|I admit, when Pink first came out I didn't like her at all. But, after I heard Don't Let Me Get Me, I went out and got this CD.  Pink has co-written most of the songs on the album and all the songs are great.  If you're reading this, you gotta buy this album, I assure you that you will not be dissapointed!
B0000029AP|5.0|1975 was a great year for Aerosmith. It was the year of &quot;Walk This Way&quot;, &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot;, &quot;Big 10&quot; Record&quot;, &quot;Toys in the Attic. This album is full of hits. Buy the album and it is sure satisfaction.
B000062Y98|4.0|Well, the long awaited new album from Blind Guardian is finally here. I've read various 5 star and perfect 10 reviews for this new release, and after several listens, I dont believe this album warrants it. Dont get me wrong; this is a very strong effort,with no weak tracks present, but it almost seems as if the music is a little too progressive in style. The album could have used more all-out speed tracks like track #9. Jerusalem, the opener, remains one of the standouts, as does the epic closer &quot;And Then There Was Silence.&quot; There is so much going on with these songs however, that after 5 listens I still have not warmed up to it yet. Also, the overall production, while outstanding, has one drawback: The snare sound in my opinion is rather weak. Not the drumming, but the snare sound itself. Overall a worthy purchase, but some of the songs could have been more straight-forward. Imaginations From The Other Side remains in my opinion, their best album overall.
B000001EL3|4.0|When I first bought this album I thought it was alright because it was a different sound of KISS with different instruments. After a few times of real listening I realized this album kicks ...! Great songs. Peter Criss's famous ballad \\"Beth\\" is a hit along with \\"Detroit Rock City\\". This album is satisfaction guaranteed,
B000009VOL|2.0|Maybe I'll have to give this another few listens, but my first impression is that this is mostly unmelodious (is that a word?) garbage.  I hope I grow to like it more.  But my advice for now -don't waste your money.
B000062X90|5.0|I can't believe the 3 bonus tracks were recorded at a Memphis radio station live - straight w/no overdubbing - in 1972!<BR>It puts some of todays recordings - studio or live - to shame.<BR>Analog Rules!  Not to mention the musicianship...par excellence!<BR>If you are interested in classic rock at it's finest, buy this remaster; you won't regret it.
1574534394|2.0|If you own nothing else written by Brian Tracy then you may get something out of this offering - hence the two stars.  Otherwise, spend your money elsewhere.  I can't think of one new thing I learned after listening to this tape program.  Normally I am a big fan of Brian Tracy, but this time I think he rehashed and repackaged old material, and he did not even select his best.  Very disappointed.
B00005B36K|5.0|I know Tool for about 6 months now, and in that time I only listened to this album.<BR>And I must say I haven't heard such good rock in a long time!
0440217563|3.0|I have read all 5 Gabaldons from Outlander to Fiery Cross. While others I pass them on to, saying YOU HAVE GOT TO LOVE THIS!, see only the length, they like I quickly find that something is *always* happening to keep you turning the pages. I couldn't believe how quickly I finished &quot;Fiery Cross,&quot; which @ 900pp.+ must be the longest of the lot but isn't, in the reading. (Based on the reviews of the &quot;Outlandish Companion,&quot; which I didn't feel I needed--haven't I memorized all I've read, after all?--like the others, I am now killing time--too long!--till the next.) Of all these great books, it was &quot;Voyager&quot; that *felt* longest to me, as though it could have been trimmed a bit in the opening few hundred pages. But another Scots friend co-reading (co-dependent!) said, you have to keep going till p.__, you won't BELIEVE what happens there...so I did, and was again richly rewarded. How to say what's BEST, from the opening book to the incredible &quot;Dragonfly&quot; and &quot;Drums/Fiery&quot;? One learns so much history from the day-to-day lives as well as the fictional characters. All I know is that the ONLY book that feels &quot;worst,&quot; while still brilliant, because it tried my patience in spots--something the other books never did for a paragraph--is &quot;Voyager.&quot; I'm awarding it three stars only to contrast it with the A+++s the other books should get (say, TEN stars)--because it's still rated by all at over 4.5 stars in a group of 5-star books. But once you star with &quot;Outlander,&quot; who could stop? One can't miss &quot;Voyager&quot;; I simply think it's the weakest of the lot.
B00005LK95|5.0|The Best sequel of a movie I've ever seen.  Johnny 5 goes to New York to help his friend, Ben (Fisher Stevens) build toy robots of himself to make big bucks.<br />  Ben is helped by Fred (McKean), who wants to sell Johnny 5, who costs 11 million dollars.<br />  Johnny 5 is tricked into helping Oscar, a jewel thief.<br />  All in all, this is possibly the greatest sequel there ever was.  Great for those who watched the first movie!
B0000640VO|5.0|I really enjoyed this film. Most men do. I discovered that most women aren't that interested in it, however. Here's why: the movie depicts a beautiful, very beautiful, young woman, who is lonely. Just that idea on it's own can be very appealing to a man. That there can be a woman out there who is beautiful, but alone, and lonely. Second of all, in the film she falls in love with a pretty much ordinary guy. That idea, again, is very appealing to most men, and can identify with that ordinary guy, and think it is realistic that he, the viewer, could be him. <br />The entire movie is set up for the viewer to fall in love with amelie. Besides that, the movie is very clever, and very interesting, but if you are a woman, or just plain unaffected by amelie's charms, you will find the movie merely cute.
B00004VVNB|5.0|I have loved this movie since my older brother made me watch it when I was a kid. Yes, it is dated! No, it is not as good as the book but my god, it is a great film. I believe the DVD is as great as it could have been - unless they had found the deleted scenes. I have not watched it with the commentry on all the way through yet - but it is great to know it is there for ever more waiting for me to get round to watching it. It is great to see the documentry &quot;welcome to the 23rd century&quot; showing all the behind the scenes footage. Now all we need is all 14 episodes of the tv series released on dvd - considering how much the bootleg videos go for on ebay - I would not think it will be long before Warner Bros will be cashing in on that - heres hoping!!
B00003CXXP|2.0|Spielberg takes a concept from the master sci-fi director of all time (OK, James Cameron has a claim there too but anyway, work with me) and drops the ball while going for the ultimate TD, i.e. the besting of 2001: A Space Odyssey.  It is all there, fantastic score, good acting, talking computers, 2.5 hours of screen time, last third to one half of the movie taken up by insane transcendental weirdness, etc.  But Uh-oh, the aforementioned transcendental weirdness is not weird enough or transcendental enough to serve as a payoff and just goes on...my goodness, and on!  The hotel room/Starchild sequence in 2001 - well what was *that* about?  But it sure looked cool - and you were left to your own devices to interpret it as you wished, or just go along for the ride.  Here we have an hour of aliens/robot descendants (who knows?) engaging in so much explication, moralising and unexplained (and somewhat pointless) acts of godlike benevolence that it would seem they are robot descendants of Spielberg himself, or aliens from planet SKG.<br />The cool things: the scenes of an ice age New York are &quot;wow!&quot; and Teddy, reliable companion, eminence grise and sometime savior is mondo cute.  But it's 2.5 hours that feels like 4.  The thing about Kubrick, he knew when to shut up, Spielberg doesn't here - there were two places in the film where he could have cut and run, and it would have improved it substantially (SPOILERS: the two points are...!! when David falls in the water after meeting his &quot;maker&quot;, and when he finally &quot;meets&quot; the Blue Fairy).<br />As for the DVD extras, I have not watched them yet, so cannot comment.  To be honest, once I see the main movie, and it is as much of a turn-off as this one, I am not that interested in seeing how it was made.  Maybe that's just me!
B000060P79|4.0|The smash debut by Simple Plan is one of the best cds I've heard recently. I enjoyed the cd a lot, and I hope you do too. The vocals are solid and the music gets you moving. If you like Blink-182, Sum41, and Sugar Ray, then you'll love this cd. The track I'd Do Anything features Mark Hoppus of Blink-182. Also the band is currently on tour with Sugar Ray. They are equally as good if not better live than they are on the cd. Check out ... for more information
0790736039|4.0|This movie I believe was one of the first mini series I have seen by Stephen King. I watched from start to finish I was so interested in the kids in this film. Two who are played by popular actor's today Seth Green (Young Richie Tozer), and Jonathan Brandis (Young Bill Denbrough). The children band together and call themselves \\"The Looser's Club\\" they face being different from their classmates and they also face their parents. But what they must ultmiately face is the monster who kills children called \\"Pennywise the Clown.\\" Together and only together as a team can they defeat the monster.<BR>In the first half of the film we learn of the Clown (Played by the great Tim Curry) and the history with the town of Derry, Maine. We see the kids meeting for the first time and the fun they all have. But the serious times comes when they band together to stand up for themselves against a few of the classmates namly Henry Bowers who likes to torment the other kids in the school. They then come together to form a circle and defeat the clown/monster. With a promise that if it wasn't dead they would all come back to destroy it.<BR>In the second part of the film we see whats happened to them career wise and love life wise. Its a tad slower, but it is definately funny and has its serious moments as well. The kids all grown up are now played by a great cast: Henry Anderson (Richie Tozer), Dennis Christopher (Eddie Kaspbrak), Richard Masur (Stan Uris), Annette O' Toole (Beverly Marsh), John Ritter (Ben Hascom), Tim Reid (Mike Hanlon), and Richard Thomas as (Bill Denbrough). Again the second part starts off slow. But its fun to see them all come together again. And to try and remember the good and bad times and defeat the \\"clown.\\"<BR>I was very much interested to see Stephen King use children to believe in this monster to where the adults couldn't. It's also interesting to see this sort of similarity in some of his other where the children are the key. Which I find really grand in a way. This movie did; however, really turn me off of clowns. So it does have its creep factor in the movie. I would definately recommend it! Athough the book does give more great detail and is better, and the book is different in most parts. But for a mini series this was my first love of Stephen King.
B00005RFQ5|4.0|Look at who we're talking about here--PRINCE-THE ARTIST. This man could come out with the wackest release in American history and still millions of trained-mind groupies would still head to the record stores 1st thing saturday morning (after they get paid friday). Overall it's a wonderful cd, in my opinion just a little bit too talkative though.
0451167716|4.0|Personally I thought that Mario Puzo's The Godfather was very well written and interesting.  It's about an Italian Mob related family.  The book was well thought out and hard to put down.  The description was excellent as I could perfectly picture everything that was happening.  I enjoyed this novel and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys reading books full of suspense, and action.  You can watch the movie also but it's not the same.  I recommend the book over the movie.
B00005UQ9F|1.0|I rented this DVD the other day thinking it would be a scary movie. The only thing scary about this movie is that it was put on film in the first place. It could have been a good movie if Alfred Hitchcock had come back from the grave to direct it. The movie starts out so well but by the time it ends you have spent so much time trying to figure out who the killer is that you are not paying attention to subtle clues in the movie. The only unsettling thing about this movie is the time I wasted watching it. The movie  never comes together.The story was a good one, it was just a shame the movie wasn't.
B000002UKS|5.0|The Colour and the Shape is the best Foo Fighters CD. I have all the CD's from them. They are one of my ten favorite bands of all time. They are great. Although I miss Nirvana, the Foo Fighters are excellent. This is a must - have for all Foo Fighters fans (Unless you already have it).
0345440757|5.0|Before I found this book we were having sleep problems with my then 8 month old. I just couldn't see myself following the FERBER method so I was at a loss of what to do.  I found this book and read the part about reparenting.  I followed her advice on putting my son in the bed and comforting when he needed it.  It was a very long first night but by the third night it only took me 15 minutes to get my son to sleep.  Before reading this it would take us all night to get him to sleep in his bed.  This is a common sense book that shows you how to connect with your child.
B0000584V3|5.0|Well, this CD is in one of my top 10 CD's EVER, & for good reason.  This band has made Death Metal sound beautiful, & make it clear that Death Metal requires a lot of talent:<BR>1. The Leper Affinity - This is the perfect opening to this CD, it is just amazing.  The vocals start off harsh, like an old school Opeth song, technical death metal, but then the vocals go clean, you hear the talent - 5/5<BR>2. Bleak - This song continues the harsh/clean vocals but the music changes around it, amazing talent - 5/5<BR>3. Harvest - This is just an acoustic metal song, but still amazing.  Different for the rest of the CD, still amazing - 5/5<BR>4. The Drapery Falls - This (in my opinion) is the best song on the CD & the best Opeth song EVER.   This is just pure genius, Devin Townsend like genius, but in the Death Metal field.   Pure class - 5/5<BR>5. Dirge For November - This song is just like the others, class.   I really don't know how else to describe this CD - 5/5<BR>6. The Funeral Portrait - Yet another Metal masterpiece, which is an Opeth speciality - 5/5<BR>7. Patterns In The Ivy - This is an acoustic filler song, still beautiful, still great - 5/5<BR>8. Blackwater Park - The title song, & the longest on the CD.  It is yet another classic song, not up with the Drapery Falls, but still great - 5/5<br />Overall, this CD is 5/5.   I haven't & don't think I will hear a Death Metal CD that will beat this classic.   I recommend this CD over ANY other Death CD & 99% of the others CD's out
B000003TAW|5.0|I have had this album for a long while now, and it is the best album that I HAVE EVER HEARD. It is completely perfect in every way. Whenever I put it in I make every one in the room shut up and chill out. I can't explain the sentimental attachment I have to this recording. It is my soundtrack to the summers of my life, which I think about alot. This album makes me feel really glad that i spend the \\"best years of my life\\" with this band.<BR> Well, on to the track listing. \\"my name is jonas\\" is a great starter track and is one of my favorites off the album. It's just awesome. \\"no one else\\"is a really good song about him being a jealous boyfriend. I can relate. It's another one of my favorites. \\"the world has turned and left me here\\" is my favorite song of all time. It's beautiful. Period. \\"buddy holly\\" is a great song to get you pumped and feeling good. \\"undone\\" is a good, long song about a decaying relationship. really great. \\"surf wax america\\" is a really good, fast paced song about everyone doing the same things all the time. So instead of taking the car to work, he's taking his surfboard. \\"say it ain't so\\" is another good standout. it expresses bottled up emotions and feelings and how they are released with drinking. \\"in the garage\\" is a really good song about being a loner, and finding comfort being alone when you make music and being a rock star in your own little world with an imaginary audience and expressing yourself through it. \\"holiday\\" is a really, really great song about a relationship with two many outside people butting their noses in, and wanting to get away from it all. \\"only in dreams\\" is one of my favorites. It is a beautiful song about a girl, with really great lyrics. It has a great build up as well.<BR> If you dont have this album, then you're a fool. So buy it now!! It will change you forever.
B00005R2M3|3.0|Whenever, Whenever is the only song that really works in this one.  I am not a fan of hers but I did see her perform Eyes Like Yours at the Latin Grammys.  The girl can really belly dance and is very graceful.  Her vocals are amazingly powerful (better than Christina who also performed Genie in a Bottle in Spanish at the same show--however unlike Shakira Christina also performed some 100 live concerts that year--enough to wash anybody's voice out even a little).  The other song on the CD that works is Underneath Your Clothes.  During the higher pitched sounds she does them so beautifully one can't help but wish she sang the whole song that way.  Like what other music critics have said hate that injection of Morrisette type sound out of her.  However that really is Shakira's voice if you listen to her sing in Spanish too however in Spanish it sounds sooo much better.   Eyes Like Yours in English does not sound nearly as good as her Spanish version.  The Spanish tracks on this CD (tho I don't know the language) musically sound better to my English speaking ears than the other English sung songs other than Whenever Whenever and Underneath You Clothes.  I have to give this CD 2.6 because overall it didn't have enough good songs or ever one astounding  song e.g. Blue of LeAnne Rimes to justify a higher rating.
B00005OM4N|1.0|Britneys first CD Baby One More Time had so much promise: good musically, vocals, hooks, etc.  This CD by comparison doesn't measure up.  Slave for You is listenable but the background vocals/music is very off key.  Overprotected is okay, but lacks emotion: monotone.  In fact the same could be said of the rest of the tracks.  Not Yet a Woman could have been a good song but lacks the hooks and emotion that she had on her first CD.  I Love Rock in Roll is passable, however if you grew up with Joan Jett's version or even heard Jett's version you'll have to admit this one falls short.  Much of the music is not singing but talking which is a major disappointment.  Plus Britney's voice which is a little on the high pitched side a-la Olivia Newton-John is better made for ballads and catchy pop not this type of music.  Had she kept the voice she used in Soda Pop (off her 1st CD) or One Kiss for You (off her 2nd CD) this CD might have been better. The only songs which are passable and has some good parts to it but overall not a better than average are the lesser known ones Lonely and That's Where You Take Me.  I hate to give a bad rating, however if everyone who thought this CD measured short but are a big fan of hers anyways chose to give this CD a high rating is like sending a message to Britney and her record company that this is the kind of music they want more of.  I think if people were honest this Cd lacks the better than average sung music of a Baby One More Time, You Drive Me Crazy, Oops, and  From the Bottom of My Broken Heart.  My message is simply please bring back the better singing.  This is not saying Britney I want you to stay 15 forever, we all know she's 20, but it is saying can you please sing as well as you did before. Bring back Eric Foster White.  Max Martin is great but not stylized for this new stuff--yuck.  Newer does not mean better.  Hopefully this CD is not an example of what to expect more of.  In all fairness to Britney she did spend most of theyear doing a movie.  However I would have prefered that if she couldn't get a great CD out I'd (tho younger people might not be able to) rather wait two years for her to do it.  Or do what Christina did and just release a few quality singles.
B00004SCX6|3.0|The title song is okay.  More interesting if you catch the video Oops which is really good.  Stronger sounds too mechanical, but okay overall.  Satisfaction is hard to listen to esp. if you grew up with the Stones version which is really good.  Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know is as well sung as Britney can do it (some parts are very good), however having heard Shania Twain I can't help but notice that had Shania sang this one (which is written by her husband while Shania was pregnant and resting) it would have been a big hit and Grammy contender.  What U See is definitely one of the better sung of the tracks: catchy and vocally nice.  Lucky is a sweet song, but not really that catchy for the older generation but it's overall good.  One Kiss for You has a lot of promise but production wise the instruments in the background override her voice (Soda Pop a similar R&B type song in her 1st CD is far better).  Where are You Now-- a ballad sounds nice but lacks the hooks and expertise in singing of any of her ballads on her first CD.  Dear Diary is a sweet song and sounds nice but not nice enough to be great.  Overall the CD isn't worth full price.  Get it at half price or even better buy the video.  Out of 5 stars it really deserves a 2.6 esp. when compared to her first CD.
B00005JKHP|5.0|Okay.  Most of us know the deal already with Paramount.  They've released the cheap, featureless DVD editions of the Trek movies in reverse order, and now, starting with ST:TMP, they're going forward again with special editions.  Meaning it was quite a wait for a set like this to come out.  Was it worth the wait?<br />Without a question.<br />When I say the film is a vast improvement, I meant that in more than one way.  First of all, this is one of the best DVD sets I've ever seen.  I won't bother listing the features: Check the Amazon.com technical specs for those.  This truly is the first Star Trek DVD truly worth owning.  But they are not the reason why you should give serious consideration to this movie.<br />The film.  The glorious piece of film that is ST:TMP-The Director's Edition.  I know... if you've seen the film, you must be scratching your head at that comment.  But as Robert Wise explains in the featurettes, they simply did not have the time to put together the film that they wanted to back in 1979.  This DVD is the glorious vision that ST:TMP was meant to be.  Robert Wise has somehow created a much tighter cut of the film without shortening it.  The movie is fast-paced (compared to the previous cuts, anyway), has astounding special effects (even where they haven't been re-enhanced), and showcases the relationships between the three main characters, as well as newbies Decker and Ilia.  Scenes that were once long and boring (to be frank) now offer you more varied perspectives.  It is now much more clear what is going on in many of the shots.  And again, the character relationships that make the movie special have now come to the forefront.  This really is the original Star Trek on the big screen -- oddly enough, a claim which may only be true of this film and Star Trek V (quality of the films notwithstanding).<br />This is a film that was once a cure to insomnia.  The Director's Edition repairs that.  It is still not an action-packed film like Trek II/III/VI, nor should it be.  However, it has become far easier to follow and much more interesting to watch.  The old film I might have rated two or three stars.  As for the new film, I wholeheartedly rate it five stars, even excluding the other DVD extras.  The differences won't be enough to change everyone's mind, but it did change this film for me and for many others I know.<br />The SFX Updates: If you have seen the Star Wars Special Editions, you likely both love and fear such updates.  I'm glad to say that the updates are used to amazing effect to accomplish scenes that they simply did not have the time or money to do in 1979, all held together by the promise that they will not do any effect that was not possible in 1979 (although they may use more advanced means of actually ACCOMPLISHING the effects).  Spock walks up to Kohlinar and sees 100-foot statues of Vulcan warriors -- a shot previously seen only in the Marvel Comics adaption.  The awful matte painting is removed (and, with it, the debate over whether or not Vulcan has a moon).  We fly past the Golden Gate bridge in San Francisco, and see a busy spaceport (featuring one of the original Enterprise's shuttles).  V'Ger extends out hexagonal footbridges to the Enterprise as crew members stand on the hull -- another shot that could not be properly realized in the original edition.  Once again, the horrible Enterprise matte painting is removed from that scene, replaced by a to-scale digital simulation.  And, no, they didn't digitally insert Cap'n Archer's Enterprise in the \\"ships named Enterprise\\" scene. ;)<br />For absolute purists, many of the original scenes still exist on disk two, where a total of 16 deleted scenes from the 1979 and 1983 editions make their residence.  But almost any fan will appreciate the work of love that is Robert Wise's definitive Star Trek: The Motion Picture.  It is a true experience to behold.
B00005Y228|5.0|It's great that Kylie is finally establishing her name in the United States as a new and rising pop star. I mean sure she had a hit with \\"Loco Motion\\" back in the late 1980's, but I'm sure with an album as hot as this, she'll be around for quite some time. Kylie has a sweet and sexy voice, like Madonna and Janet Jackson with a little touch of Gwen Stefani's cute vocal mannerisms. There is not one ballad on here, every song here is completely danceable! I think the highlights of the album are \\"More More More,\\" \\"Love At First Sight,\\" \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head,\\" \\"Fever\\" \\"Fragile\\" \\"Give It To Me\\" and the bonus track \\"Boy.\\" If you like high-energy dance albums, I personally recommend this to you.
B00004Y2QS|5.0|What Can I say?  This DVD showcases the still growing talent of Prince.  He continues to prove himself as an artist and performer.  This DVD captures the guitar solos up close with amazing footage.  The special guests/performers just add to the awesome event.  Prince digs deep for some obscure and rare songs not performed in years.  The camera footage is just awesome of the performances.
0553801481|5.0|I was so eager to get this book that I ordered it from Amazon.co.uk, since it came out there a few months in advance of the American release (also the cover art is nicer on my edition).  I have been hoping  for a new FitzChivalry book, and this lives up to my hopes and more.<br />This is a marvelous new journey with FitzChivalry Farseer and his wolf Nighteyes!  The book takes place 15 years after Assassin's Quest, and begins at Fitz's (now known as Tom Badgerlock) cabin, which he shares with his adopted son, Hap.  One by one, the people he loved best from his former life come to him, asking him to return to Buckkeep.  First Chade, then Starling, and finally the Fool (YAY!) come to him, seeking to involve him once more in the politics of the Six Duchies.  None of them are successful until Prince Dutiful disappears, and Fitz is called up to find him.<br />Knowing he can't return as FitzChivalry (since he was executed for having the Wit), he takes service to Lord Golden, who is none other than the beloved Fool.  When the hunt leads them from Buckkeep to a small holding of minor nobility, things begin to get dangerous.  There are new factions rising in the Six Duchies, and whether they intend good or ill for the prince, they can certainly cause chaos with the knowledge they possess.  Fitz and the Fool must rescue Dutiful, even if it means sacrificing their own lives, or the lives of those they love best.<br />This book is a wonderful return to Fitz; Hobb has obviously kept in touch with him during the time she spent writing the Liveship Trilogy, because her characterization of him is as true as ever.  He has gained a certain amount of wisdom, but he is still quite capable of foolishness and bullheaded blindness.  The Fool is as mysterious as ever, though he certainly speaks with more frankness than he used to.  With his new identity as Lord Golden,   we (and Fitz) see a different side of him that adds even more dimensions to his character.  The new characters of Laurenand Dutiful are strong additions to the cast, which is great since we'll at least be seeing more of Dutiful in the books to come.<br />Once again Hobb has given us a magical and breathtaking story.  I am VERY grateful that she returned to Fitz and the Fool (the Fool being one of my favourite characters of all fantasy!) and has given us more excitement.  I have to admit, I spent the last bit of the book in tears - but Hobb has always had that effect on me!
B00005V0X5|5.0|Having been praying for a re-recorded or remastered version of 'Killing is my Business' for well over a decade imagine my excitment upon finaly recieving a remastered version of \\"The best debut album of all time...Ever\\"<br />For years I've griped about shoddy production letting down a classic. Now I can finally say that 'the classic' has become a masterpiece.<br />The only complaint is the partial deleation of lyrics from 'These Boots' - read the notes to find out why. Then again it offers a chance to sing Karioki... right?<br />With the inclusion of three demo recordings, this CD is an absolute must. If I could award it 6 stars then I would, but 5 will have to do...
B000050XEI|5.0|I have a ton of CD's.  Most of them get tossed in a bin after listening to them three or four times.  I have played this CD over and over and over again.  This is the BEST CD I have bought.  I definitely suggest that you at least give it a chance.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|What a disc set ! I have never seen a Disc made for the visually impared. And the things you can do with the Green Fairy. Dances without editing and the auditions are great. But the best is Nicole Kidman. Go Ozzie Go Oi Oi Oi for the Oscars !

That 'editorial review' above blows....anybody who gets up and plays and sings like John Mayer should be thanked for making the world a better place with this music.<br />This cd sounds great too. The production and playing is excellent. Sure Matthews has his thing, but this cd is just as valid.
0748662529|5.0|A far cry from the fast paced, violent nature of the Walter Mosely mysteries, Alexander McCall Smith's The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency opens on the doorstep of a calm, warm afternoon in Botswana, Africa, with Precious Ramotswe sipping tea on the porch of the detective agency that  she opened with the money from the inheritance bequeathed to her by her beloved father.  She lives a difficult life, facing the loss of her mother at an early age, betrayal by her husband, the death of her child, and the death of her father.   <br />Initially the townspeople are skeptical of her agency because of her gender, but she repeatedly proves that her wisdom and her instincts are invaluable to the successful resolution of cases dealing with various types of charlatans, disappearances, and crimes.  Through the pure, limpid quality of straightforward storytelling, we see that she becomes a community confidante, a \\"fixer of lives\\" conducting herself with dignity and grace, yet doing what she must do to put those lives back together when they fall to pieces.  <br />On a continent faced with impending changes due to exposure to the modernity of the western world, Mma Ramotswe represents a passionate tribute to the beauty of the old Africa, recording the \\"unrecorded voices\\" of those who still follow the old traditions and reminding us that, when thought gets you nowhere, you still have to eat your pumpkin.

B000001Y5J|5.0|I really like this album.  It really is great.  I like it because it isn't poppy like their last album.  It has anger and really good lyrics, but the music is great too.  It is short and is really stays with you long after you listen to it.  Oh, and another thing, hearing this CD is one thing, but seeing the movie that was set to it is really what makes it worth it.  While the movie wasn't ever relesed because of graphic violence, it is available through bootleg.  I have a copy and it is really cool, but gross and very intense.  Anyway, get this cd and if you have the guts, get the movie!
B00005QZ7U|4.0|I was hesitant to see this movie, it took months of my little sister begging me to watch it, and frankly I'm glad I did. Although I disagree with her proclimation of &quot;best movie ever&quot; I cannot deny the artistic inginuity that this film is drowning in, in fact, this strength may also be it's greatest flaw. The movie is sometime awekwardly paced and the cinimatography, while brilliant is at times odd and almost as nautious as the Blair Witch Project. Despite over doing it in artistic appeal the film is beautifully colred, and coreographed. For the casual movie gower it may be easy to loose track of the story at times, but for movie buffs like myself the over all brilliance and depth of this movie makes it a definate must own. Although I must confess that if this movie had hoped to breathe new life into the dead musical genre it would have been better if they had used original music, not bizzar remakes of classic pop/rock tunes.
B0000640VO|5.0|This is the most creative, hilarious, and delightful movie I have ever seen.  The opening credits are one of the best parts, so don't skip them.  The movie shows all the sensual pleasures we enjoy but never verbalize or pay attention to, like how it feels to sink your hand into a sack of grain, the sound of stones skipping, coins spinning, or making a crystal glass sing, the way a leaf feels against your mouth, popping bubblewrap, and cracking the top of creme brulee. It is also about ethical activism, making a difference in others' lives, and living bigger than one's fears and limitations.  It is visually breathtaking and perfectly acted.  Every character in the story collects something.  Some collect evidence, others collect sayings, photographs, polaroids, footprints, funny laughs, love letters, paintings, symptoms, and strategies.  The characters are quirky but completely real, and each one a part of each of us.  It made me laugh so hard my stomach muscles hurt the next day. I saw it many times and discovered layer upon layer of detail each time. You will love it!
B00005V1Z0|5.0|This movie is full of non-stop action! It's a great story line & Angelina Jolie is perfect for the part!<br />What I like most about this movie is that Lara Croft displays her sexuality but doesn't flaunt it. <BR>What I mean is, she wears short-shorts and fitted tank tops, but she's NOT showing massive cleavage with her boobs jiggling out all over the place. She wears boots instead of high heels and really knows how to handle two guns. Her hair is tied back in a tight braid, she doesn't wear any make-up, and the scene w/her showering doesn't show anything too provacative.<BR>GO LARA CROFT! (or should I say Angelina)
0767819594|4.0|I thought it was a great movie with great acting but the ending wasn't soo great.It was too typical and didn't seem real enough. Over all a good movie.
B000002J0P|5.0|I know that sounds so corny but the vocals on this cd are like something you have never heard. In fact the harmony here is better IMHO than anything I ever heard by the Beach Boys, Its that good. There are cuts that almost move me to tears they are that sweet. Gawd I am gushing over this work but you just have to hear it once to fall in love with it. Better than anything else that followed by CSN or with Y.
B00003CXTG|1.0|Face it, kids. This movie is awful. Technical craft and quality cinematography, special FX and sound does not make it a good movie.  (see BATMAN FOREVER).<br />Don't chastise people for thinking this is a low-brow movie.  And don't use the \\"This is not a documentary\\" excuse.  It may not be a documentary but it is still called PEARL HARBOR.  Therefore, it DOES have an obligation to be accurate about Historical facts. Fictional characters are fine.  Bad fictional characters are not... P>Admit the darn thing is bad and move on with your life.
6304602979|4.0|I saw this DVD @ a friends home.  I wore two VHS tapes out of this movie....and this was after taping them onto blank tapes, so as not to ruin the originals.  This movie, along with Natural Born Killers, are my favorite bedtime movies.  I would love to buy the directors cut of this DVD, but will not by one until I see it.  I must admit, I am intrigued at the thought of seeing it letterboxed.  Please get a letterboxed directors cut in so I can buy it from you.  &quot;You see, he bought this ring for his sweetheart.  He wears it on a chain around his neck until this dirty Kraut rips it off and it falls into the sea...He dives in after it....isn't that cool?&quot;
B00000JMQE|5.0|When I was five years old, my Aunt took me to see my very first movie on the big screen. That movie was \\"Return to Oz\\". The memory of this strange and wonderful movie is among my very first, and I begged my mother to take me to see it again. She, of course, was totally horrified once she saw the film for herself, as it is definitely not your average children's movie, what with the lunatic asylums, poisoned nomes, and dismembered heads.<br />A surprising and unexpected film, \\"Return to Oz\\" is best watched on a stormy October night when it's subtle creepiness can be properly appreciated. The movie picks up six months after \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" ends, with Dorothy (eerily played by a young Fairuza Balk) back at home with Aunt Em and Uncle Henry in Kansas. All is not well ,though, as their first house was of course destroyed in the tornado and winter is fast approaching with the new house still unfinished. Then there is the problem of Dorothy herself; she doesn't sleep well, acts queerly, and is full of tales of a magical world located over a rainbow.<br />It is at this point that the film takes a truly unexpected turn as Aunt Em decides that the best way to cure Dorothy's illusions is electro-shock therapy (!). From here on the movie really takes off, as Dorothy (thanks to a wild storm) finds herself once again in Oz, this time via something called the \\"Deadly Desert\\", which, Dorothy explains to her talking chicken Balina, turns any living thing that touches it into sand. (If you get the feeling that we will have a distrubing demonstration of this phenomenon later, you would be right.)<br />From then on the film swiftly moves from bizarre episode to bizarre episode as Dorothy makes various friends and enemies. Highlights include meeting the \\"Army of Oz\\" (one lone mechanical man), discovering someone trapped in a mirror, and a truly stunning set-peice towards the middle detailing Dorothy's escape from \\"Princess Mumbie\\"'s castle, thus avoiding becoming part of Mumbie's twist-on twist-off head collection. It all ends on the horrific Nome King's mountain, where Dorothy learns the value of friendship, loyalty, and chickens.<br />So, for those worried about some of the above reviews warning that this movie is not for young children, I say ; That depends on the child. Beautiful and haunting, this is a must-own for every lover of great unappreciated cinema.st-on twist-off head collection.

0375507507|5.0|Dissatisfied reviewers of Alexandra Fuller's \\"Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight\\" tend to dwell on the degree to which the book fails to conform to their own agendas and expectations.  These reviewers lament Fuller's perceived lack of attention to women's issues, the plight of black Zimbabweans, and the horrors of the Rhodesian War, to name a few.  In other words, rather than praise Fuller for the story she tells, they criticize her for stories they believe she fails to tell.  To bad for them; they are missing out on a great book.<br />In addition to being smart, funny, entertainnig, and well-written, Fuller's memoir provides invaluable insight into the end of white rule in southern Africa.  The Fullers are hardly members of a wealthly, landed, colonial ruling class.  They are poor, rootless, prone to drinking and fighting.  Where is the privilege, however minimal, for which they and other white Rhodesians fought?  Why on earth would they stay on in places like Zambia and Malawi after the end of white rule?  Fuller offers no definite answers to these questions -- though possible answers lurk in the loving and intricate passages in which Fuller describes the sights, sounds, and smells of southern African life.  As the story of ordinary white Africans living through a defining moment in southern African history, this book works particularly well.<br />Those who enjoy Fuller's book might also want to read \\"Mukiwa,\\" Peter Godwin's equally excellent memoir of growing up in white Rhodesia.  Godwin (who, like Fuller, spent much of his youth in the eastern part of Rhodesia, near the border with Mozambique) is about ten years older than Fuller.  As such, he offers more about the origins of the war.  Godwin also fought with the Rhodesian Army in the 1970s (these experiences make up a large portion of his narrative) and returned to his homeland as a journalist in the 1980s, to cover prime minister Robert Mugabe's reign of terror against his opposition.  This more political andhistorical approach provides a nice companion to Fuller's work.
6305095574|5.0|If you`ve never seen a movie that scared you so bad that you won`t even stay alone in a lighted room, or even worse a dark room, you`ve never seen The Evil Dead.  The film opens with five collage students driving to an old cabin deeb in the woods. The night they get there they find an old book and a recorder with something on it. They listen to the recording and a lot of freaky stuff starts to happen. And one by one the students start to turn into  zombies.   Bruce Cambell leads the cast as Ash.  Overall this is one of the best horror films i have ever seen. The fact that they say about fifty words in the whole movie does not bother me.  Followed by a much much lesser sequal.
B000002BBY|5.0|This album offered the huge 1996 mainstream success of songs like Hello, Morning Glory, Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger and Champaign Super Nova. What makes this album so great is Oasis has a good British Beat, charming vocals and memorable lyrics about relationships and life. Hello starts the CD with a good introduction to the upbeat guitars, drum beats and a bit of sunshine in the lyrics. Roll with it is no chart topper, but its unique in its own right as singer Noel Gallagher takes a different singing tone, more of a whiney sound over some good drumbeats. Wonderwall is a thoughtful song, starting with a very soft strumming guitar throughout the entire song, making you focus on the vocals before a cello and soft drumbeat are added into the song. Don't Look Back In Anger kicks off with a piano and a simple drumbeat and eventually a guitar flutters in. Hey Now is slightly an Americanized rock song, but it is slow paced with a constant rattling beat. Some Might Say has a rocking guitar and happy lyrics about why people shouldn't wonder about things beyond life. Cast No Shadow is simply a slow melody, with some good backup singers, still singing about what is beyond life. She's Electric is a happier song, with some funny lyrics true to life about a girl that is pressing Gallagher into marriage. Morning Glory is a powerful song about how life is precious, kicking off with a good guitar and what sounds like a helicopter, before the beat starts up followed with \\"all your dreams are made, when your chained to a mirror and a razor blade.\\" Champaign Super Nova is a 7 minute song which finishes the CD with Gallagher's perspective of all he has been through. The untitled tracks are instrumental interludes, each lasts a minute. The only downfall to the CD is the songs last 5-8 minutes long with long instrumental bridges and intros.
B000062Y98|5.0|Blind Guardian has had a reputation for releasing fast, powerful metal.  Although it is still fast-paced and strong, the metal part is beggining to rust a bit.  I have no idea what to call this genre, as the metal elements are still noticable, but a little harder to discern.  The first three songs are easily the best but they all have something more each time you hear them, which makes this album difficult to review.  To start, the choruses are the best I've ever heard.  While the verses are excellent, they don't seem to stick as well.  Anyone who has heard the earlier work of blind guardian will notice how complex they've gotten, and this is what seems to weaken the album.  Many of the songs have to be heard many times in order to understand how good they really are.  While songs like Precious Jerusalem, Under the Ice, and Soulforged will pull one in during the first few minutes of the song, tracks such as Punishment Divine may take up to ten listens just to be able to follow the music.  Each song is about six minutes, so have a lot patience at hand before you pick up this CD.  In my opinion, this is the best Blind Guardian album.  Each second is enjoyable after one fully comprehends the album, but that may take some time.  This masterpiece is just more proof of how much better underground music is.
B000063DFW|5.0|this is the best cd that i have ever heard before in my life. linkin park is mt favorite band in the whole world. thanks for letting me put my review.
B00000729S|4.0|This may be heresy, but a lot of the bands on the Nuggets/Pebbles comps did their best work on singles. The Monks, along with Love, The Standells, ? and the Mysterians and especially the almighty Sonics (and there's plenty of other examples), were strong through *entire* albums. &quot;Black Monk Time&quot; was way ahead of its time, and you can hear it in modern bands like Clinic. The sound's kind of thin (the live album that came out a few years ago documenting a Monks reunion has much better sound and is equally good), but that's a product of the times and it doesn't dilute the material. The sound? Heavy, dark and caustic, completely no-nonsense and loads of power. In a just world, oldies stations would play stuff like this.
B000002MY3|1.0|We've all been hurt in love.  Men are betrayed and left by women who vowed to love them forever, and vice versa.  Healthy individuals grieve about it a while and get over it and either get back on the market or find other pursuits than stupid game-playing, which is an obsession among both men and women these days, and which brings on a lot of hurt.  Alanis Morissette is like the woman who was dumped who stewed in bitterness for too long and confused hating men generally with overcoming a devastating experience in a healthy way.  Her later recordings show a gradual increase in mental health, but this one is spookily sociopathic and perhaps psychopathic.  Not a good gift to a little girl you know whom you want to grow up well-balanced.
B000001DVD|5.0|I'm always amazed at how people underate this CD.  If you like mind-blowing riffs, it's a &quot;must have.&quot;  This CD is all Steve Clark.  In the earlier days, the band would take his riffs, put them together and then add melodies.  I think it makes for a more rock driven sound.  The album is less perfected production-wise than their later stuff, but I think this only makes it better.  I recommend waking up on a dismal morning and blasting &quot;Saturday Night (High n Dry).&quot; You'll be so fired up!
B00005QDW1|1.0|You can picture the scene really can't you? Gwen orders the rest of the band into a meeting and annouces \\"we're going to make this album a little bit diffrent im getting some my ourageously cool mates,you know like william orbit to work with on the songs\\" then the drummer pipes up(rather bravely) i don't i want to play ska-punk and then 2 hours later after gwen as demonstrated why she is god they 'agree' to make this album.such a waste really because it really is overproduced ...electro music.
B00005B4GU|5.0|This album is great, and no i'm not just saying this to try to be &quot;with the times&quot;.  I don't really care what anyone says, if Spin and Rolling Stone had given this a horrible review I still would love it because it's awesome.  So don't give it a bad review just because it's &quot;popular and hip&quot;.  Radiohead deserve all the respect they get.  This music is simply beautiful, and that may sound corny, but it's true.  Do yourself a favor and buy this and all other Radiohead albums now.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I did like it. \\"A viewer\\", I know you are entitled to your opinion. <br />But so is everyone else. While you thought it was \\"horrendus\\", other people thought it was \\"marvelous\\". <br />I personally hated The Lord of  the Rings. I just didn't like it. Too violent and the acting wasn't very good. But that's just my opinion. But Harry Potter DOES have the essence of Harry Potter, you are wrong. And  I AM NOT SAYING THIS BECAUSE I LIKED THE BOOKS. As a matter of fact, I didn't like the books all that much. But I personally thought the movies' special effects and acting were incredible. So, everyone, don't judge it completely on one person's review: everyone's opinion is different. You might love this film. Who knows until you see it?
6304119046|5.0|Even after sixty years, CITIZEN KANE remains as one of the greatest movies of all time. Though it is true that some are bored by the movie because it's &#34;just a boring black-and-white movie with no action&#34;, those who hold that opinion are in the minority. KANE is often held as the pinnacle of filmmaking by movie buffs not just because of the advances the movie made in film production, but also because it set the standard that all filmmakers wish to reach: the total director's vision; a movie made with total control and no studio intervention. With that said, what does KANE hold for the average film-goer? The movie has an excellent script (it won an Oscar), great acting, and a haunting score. The story, though loosely based on the life of William Randolph Hearst, is an old one: powerful man starts out promising and full of ideals, becomes consumed by greed and loses his vision, and ends up losing it all (anyone read Macbeth or ALL THE KING'S MEN?). Overall, a deeply penetrating and thinking movie that film buffs usually love and that most everyone else will at least enjoy if they don't mind a strong drama filmed in black and white.
B00005JKQX|5.0|A Beautiful Mind was, simply, a wonderful movie. It had me laughing and crying throughout. It was shot beautifully and Russell Crowe was amazing as John Nash. I sincerely hope that this movie wins some Oscars because it deserves them. For anyone who hasn't seen this movie, go out and rent it right now. Trust me, you won't regret it.
B00004XQ83|2.0|Its funny how cultural phenomenons like these develop and it is beyond me why this soundtrack has become one.  This collection of songs is overrated and nothing more than a collection of \\"bluegrass lite\\" put together by a big name producer for people who don't have the inclination to seek out the music for themselves.  Call me a cynic but this collection of songs is nothing but a bandwagon building steam until the inevitable crash when all it's proponents will jump off and go looking for the next BIG THING.  Does anyone remember the big Swing craze?  Hmm.. what happened to it?  Does it not seem ironic that the industry is only too happy to keep shoving mediocre \\"Oh Brother\\" and \\"Oh Sister\\" collections down people's throats?  Oh Brother!  Give me a break.  There has been a vibrant Roots, Country, Americana, Bluegrass scene going on for several years now and it takes a commercially successful soundtrack to make people say \\"Bluegrass is cool\\"?  Forgive the preaching.  This soundtrack is good but not great and \\"I Am A Man Of Constant Sorrow\\" is no different than a hook laden top 40 tune spun one too many times on the FM airwaves.  If one is truly interested in Bluegrass they would do well to go beyond a soundtrack and dig a little deeper.  That being said \\"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" is an excellent film.

B00005JKED|4.0|I must say, my preconceptions about Training Day were all wrong.  The trailer I saw in the theatres made it look like a belated ripoff of The Corruptor, while director Antoine Fuqua's disastrous fumble with The Replacement Killers several years ago did nothing to boost my confidence.<br />My doubts were dispelled the minute Denzel Washington looked up from his newspaper.  It is indeed good to see Washington, one of the most gifted actors of our time, abandon the saintly martyrs he's been prone to playing for 10 years and sink his teeth into a role which allows him to show a mix of deep charisma and dangerous viciousness.  That same alchemy had made his breakthrough performance in 1989's Glory  amazingly compelling, and in Training Day, there isn't a single moment where Washington is less than completely absorbing.  Ethan Hawke also gives the performance of his career as Jake Hoyt, an idealistic but easily swayed young cop who finds himself drawn into a web of corruption, violence, and twisted morals.<br />Fuqua's directing is still overly stylish at times, but after a hyperactive first act, the film begins to roar.  David Ayer's script is dazzling, a combination of rat-a-tat street vernacular and relentless forward momentum, and after the midpoint of the movie, the intensity of the scenes would reach incredible levels.  And that's when Fuqua's show-offy camerawork finds a raison d'etre.  In this film, Fuqua even finds room for some comparatively simple scenes which are really like a breath of fresh air to his filmmaking -- for example, the &quot;you're a leader&quot; car scene, and that beautifully understated ending shot.  I hope he makes this part of his regular style, because there's only so much virtuoso camera one can take before it gets tiring, as is the case in the opening of the film.<br />A white-knuckle thriller, well worthy of the accolades it received.  I stand humbly corrected on my original predictions.
B000001GPX|4.0|While I acknowledge that these are very good performances of two classics of the orchestral repertory, I don't think they are quite in the elite group of truly classic recordings.  Tempi are perfect, especially in the Fifth; the Allegretto and Finale of the Seventh seem to me to be ever so slightly too quick.  The orchestral playing is glorious, as could be predicted from the Vienna Philharmonic (with the exception of a weak first bassoon).  At times, as in the first movement of the Fifth, the demonic intensity of these performances is almost unbelievable.  So ... why isn't it a great recording?<br />The most objective reason is the sound.  Although silent and clear, the recording sounds extremely &quot;dark&quot; to me, as if it were recorded underground somewhere - and looking at the cover certainly doesn't help matters!  But this isn't the real problem, because I gladly tolerate less-than-perfect sound.<br />The main problem is that these recordings miss two important aspects of Beethoven interpretation: mystery/spirituality and lyricism.  The transition between the Fifth's third and fourth movements is an example of where Kleiber's relentlessly straightforward approach fails: he entirely misses the swirling mystery of the strings and timpani, and so the radiant opening of the final movement is merely a sonic climax, not a spiritual one.  The other problem area is the slow movements.  Although beautifully played by the VPO, they simply do not sing.  I was particularly disappointed in the Seventh's Allegretto.  I approved of Kleiber's quick tempo, but the performance didn't speak to me at all.<br />However, in the other movements, especially the first of the Fifth and the opening and closing movements of the Seventh, the performances are truly unbelievable.  The relentless intensity of the Fifth's opening has been frequently commented on, but the Seventh has been relatively overlooked.  The finale, with its antiphonally divided violins enhancing the drama, is incandescent.<br />Overall, a fine effort, but probably not my first choice.  I realize mine is a dissenting view, but in my opinion there are important aspects of these symphonies which Carlos Kleiber doesn't realize.

B000001GQ1|3.0|Wilhelm Kempff took a very unique approach to Beethoven.  His playing of the sonatas was much more &quot;introverted&quot; than that of most other pianists; he always brought out the personal, introspective qualities of Beethoven, even in brilliant, heroic works like the Waldstein or the Appassionata.  The main ways he accomplished this were 1) by having a somewhat lower average dynamic level than most pianists, carefully observing all of Beethoven's piano markings (while ignoring several of the forte markings!) and 2) by avoiding extreme speeds, favoring spacious allegros and flowing slow movements.  He also played very expressively, with rubato and ritardandos thrown in wherever he felt they were necessary.  He also felt more concerned with expressing the character of the piece in his way than with honoring the letter of it.<br />While this may sound like a good approach on paper, it doesn't come off well in actuality.  For example, in the Pathétique, the first sonata on this disc, the slow introduction, taken at quite a quick pace, is not very dark in character.  Kempff cuts short the rests at the end of each phrase and changes the rhythm of several chords in the center.  His playing of the Allegro di molto e con brio isn't much better.  Firstly, the slow speed at which he plays it might work if sustained properly, but Kempff's phrasing is not good at all; he thumps out each chord without any concern for the phrasing or line of the piece.  The slow speed and lack of compensation for this in the playing means that the movement feels too genteel, too polite.  It's not wild, it's not dark - a constant problem with Kempff.  In addition, he omits the exposition repeat (a serious failing).  The famous slow movement is considerably better, benefiting from Kempff's flowing speed and admirable &quot;floating&quot; of the melody above the accompaniment.  The final rondo, however, is terrible: Kempff's playing lacks any kind of drama or emotion.  This can be seen even in his playing of the ornaments in the opening theme, where they MUST be on the beat, giving the theme a greater sense of wildness.  Kempff opts for the &quot;polite,&quot; before-the-beat solution.  <br />The Moonlight's opening movement is taken quickly, but, again, the melody is floated superbly, and Kempff's delicate touch works wonders in this movement.  The Allegretto is fine, but the Presto agitato is not very Presto, nor is it very agitato - and again, he omits the crucial repeat.<br />The Waldstein is perhaps the best performance on the disc.  I will examine it at some length, as it is my favorite sonata before the last three.  The first movement is fabulous.  The speed is not too slow, the playing is not too choppy, the phrasing is fabulous.  The magical tremolos at 0:22 are for once really magical and luminous, and if the subsequent wild passage isn't quite wild enough, the radiance and beauty of tone given to the chorale-like passage at 0:55 and the following radiant triplets in E major more than compensate.  He observes the crucial exposition repeat, and varies his delivery of each section on the repeat, making it more than just a formality.  The remainder of the movement is well-done, capturing the mood of each section well, although the closing runs in the final pages don't seem very intense.<br />The Introduzione is taken at a rather quick tempo, but Kempff's expressiveness and lyricism carry it through superbly.  Kempff is generally very good at slow movements.  The fabulous finale is taken at a rather slow pace, but I feel that's better in this movement than a speedy pace.  The opening melody is, again, beautifully floated, but the flowing right-hand accompaniment doesn't sound quite even and serene as it should.  Kempff's pedaling throughout this movement is rather eccentric, opting for less pedal where Beethoven specifies more, and more pedal where Beethoven specifies none.  Everything is fine, however, until we get to the section in A minor after the first statement of the theme.  Here, Kempff falls into the trap of thumping out the melody and the accompaniment.  His eighth-note chords in the left hand plod gracelessly.  He encounters similar problems in the later section in C minor.  Although his crystal-clear articulation of the rapid left-hand figuration is admirable, he again thumps out the melody.  In the subsequent modulating passage  to D flat major, where the first three chords of the theme are repeated in different keys, the high, climactic D flat chord is hit extremely harshly, the very opposite of the otherworldly beauty it should be played with.  His playing is a little too loud in the dreamy figuration which follows.  At the fortissimo return of the main theme, his playing is again extremely harsh - this may also be a fault of the piano he uses, which is very percussive in the highest register.  However, his is the best performance of the radiant broken-chord triplets (one of my favorite sections in Beethoven's entire sonata output) I have ever heard.  The Prestissimo coda is very good, but is marred by the refusal to observe Beethoven's marking of the legato octaves in both hands as glissandi.  There is no excuse whatsoever for not observing the unmistakable marking.  Overall, although Kempff's Waldstein is a flawed performance, it is one that continually benefits from his light-filled, beautiful tone.<br />The Appassionata is a disappointment: texturally clear, beautifully played but totally lacking in the wild despair and passion this sonata so obviously needs.<br />Overall, a rather disappointing set of performances.  Kempff's strengths are, in my opinion, better suited to the Haydenesque early sonatas and to the clarity and profundity of the late sonatas than to the early-middle to middle piano sonatas played here, which call for a more fiery temperament and style of playing than Kempff's admirably clear, lucid approach.

B00005JKED|5.0|I just purchased the DVD and watched it as soon as I got home.  I really enjoyed this movie. Denzel is such an excellent actor.  I really hope he gets an Oscar for his performance.  He is the only man I know that can act just as good as my favorite actor Samuel L. Jackson.  Anyway, I have never seen a movie where Denzel is the bad guy.  He was truly bad in this movie.  I highly recommend this movie.<br />Oh, Ethan Hawke wasn't too bad either.

I find the title of the album says everything (a declaration of principles if you want), they think they are beyond.... but are they?  It is impossible to compare this cd with Electric or Sonic Temple.  Once again a band trying to rebirth from their ashes but this time the formula didn't work.  But well, here it is another Cult album, and there is just one thing you can do: LOVE THEM OR HATE THEM.  It is your choice.

B00005JKT8|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie.  Hugh Jackman's character was believable, he really could have been from that century.  The part of his character that I will remember the most is that he was honourable.

0375703861|5.0|Ok, so you've heard the hype about Zadie Smith, the &quot;preternaturally gifted writer&quot;, the young woman who received a 750,000 pound advance on 80 pages of this book when she was only 21! You know she's dazzling and that the literary world is in love with her. So what? Don't critics get all excited about all kinds of terrible books? Aren't the people who say Zadie Smith is brilliant very likely huge fans of John Knowles's &quot;A Separate Peace&quot;? Yes, yes, and yes.<br />I am not one of those people. I love intelligent, entertaining, open-minded, passionate, and beautiful books.  White Teeth is all of those things and has even added a new category: meandering non-narrative gushing. Now I like that too.<br />I won't do plot synopsis, because you can get that elsewhere, and besides, White Teeth's plot is not relevant.  It really hardly matters at all. This book is, dare I say, a character story. It's about the people, not events. Normally this is what defines &quot;literary fiction&quot; from &quot;pulp fiction&quot;. In Smith's case, it's really more of a juxtaposition. Her characters aren't extraordinary. They are definitely warped, but no more than the people who live on the periphery of your own life. They are the passionate &quot;commonfolk&quot;, like me and perhaps you as well. They are egotists and they are awful and horrible and lovable and funny and frightening and uplifting...all at different times and always believably. Zadie Smith is a writer who understands people. And clearly she loves them. Even her most irascible characters are imbued with a genuine desire for goodness, no matter how divergent their idea of goodness may be from the next person.  In the post-9/11 world, this kind of disparate uniformity is very necessary. In fact, many of her characters are Muslims and a couple are even militants. Smith offers a glimpse of such a culture and compels us to love the kind people who we are being told to hate.<br />Smith's story is interesting only insofar as it provides more understanding of the people in the book. Most times I opened it, I felt like one who goes to a friend's house, not to do anything in particular, but just to watch the oddness and craziness of the family. The book is fun, smart, and you get the sense that its author really cares about people in a way that is refreshing in the world of literary pomposity. Most great literary achievements are all about the author, and the critics who praise Zadie Smith would like this to be no exception. In my estimation Smith diverges from earlier artistic triumphs by asserting the ascendancy of her characters above herself at each turn.<br />Read and savor this book, not because it's a critical success, but because it's a thing of beauty to be treasured and remembered.

B000002MG1|5.0|R.E.M. is so cool and this is one of their best albums. The music is so well written. The first time I heard this record I was in amazement. They went with the lower tempo on these songs unlike their usual mid-high tempo, and it comes off as the best R.E.M. album of the 90's.<br />My favorite song on the album is the opener 'Drive' which uses all kinds of instruments. 'Everybody Hurts' is also an instant classic along with 'Nightswimming' and 'Ignoreland' which are supreme in scale.<br />This is a wonderful album that you just need to listen to, to believe how beautiful it is. I give it 5 stars.

038533348X|5.0|\\"Cat's Cradle\\" is a heavy-handed satire about the military-industrial complex using brilliant scientific minds to create weapons of mass destruction, but because it's written by the inimitable Kurt Vonnegut, you get a cleverly conceived tale of science fiction delivered with the comical madness of a Marx Brothers movie.  This novel is pure fun even at its apocalyptic extreme. <br />The narrator (\\"Jonah,\\" as in trapped in the belly of a whale) is a journalist who plans to write a book about August 6, 1945, the day the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima.  Particularly he is interested in the life of the late Dr. Felix Hoenikker, one of the principal scientists who worked on the bomb.  After corresponding with Hoenikker's midget son Newt, he interviews fellow scientists at Hoenikker's place of employment, a think tank called the General Forge and Foundry Company.  Jonah learns that one of the last things Hoenikker was working on was something called \\"ice-nine,\\" a substance which freezes water at temperatures much higher than 32°F. <br />Then Jonah gets an assignment to interview a philanthropist named Julian Castle who runs a charity hospital on a Caribbean island called San Lorenzo.  On the plane to San Lorenzo, Jonah happens to meet Newt and his horse-faced sister Angela who are on their way to the same destination to attend the wedding of their brother Frank, who happens to be a high-ranking official on the island, to a beautiful native girl named Mona, the adopted daughter of \\"Papa\\" Monzano, the island's dictator.<br />Arriving at San Lorenzo, Jonah finds out that all the islanders practice an outlawed religion called Bokononism, started by a calypso singer named Bokonon.  Bokononism is in a constant state of development as its founder thinks of new things to write about, but its main attribute seems to be a sort of shoulder-shrugging fatalism supported by well-meaning but useless aphorisms, a playful lexicon, and a bizarre foot ritual.  Frank offers Jonahthe Presidency of San Lorenzo upon Monzano's imminent death, simply because no one else wants the job.  Unfortunately, a few stray samples of ice-nine and an ill-fated air show spell disaster for not only Jonah's lucrative new position, but the world.<br />Note the modern implications of what the defense industry today calls \\"technology transfer\\" -- sure, ice-nine kills every living thing that touches it, but it has practical uses like solidifying muddy roads for military operations.  As Vonnegut feels that writers are society's canaries in a coal mine, this novel is like a big red flashing warning signal to the powers that be, not that they'd heed it, and besides, it's too late already.  What else is there to do but laugh?
B00003CX5P|2.0|My all time favorite movies would probably be the First Star Wars Trilogy Installments and the Toy Story movies?  Why?  Because I have a thing for intergalactic dogma and the notion that the toys I used to play with talk behind my back and grapple with the same emotions I do?  No, because the accessibility of these films are unbelieveable.  Anybody with a brain can enjoy these films.  They entertain children without coming off as idiotic to adults.  So, how does Episode I fit into the subject?  <br />The movie doesn't know what audience it wants to pander to, and maybe Lucasfilm didn't care to decide because they knew people would see just about anything that had the words \\"Star\\" and \\"Wars\\" in close proximity.  Too bad, because the only people that I think would get a real kick out of the topical nature of the film's plot, characters, and lines that at best were flat and at worst made me cringe would be kids!  And there's nothing wrong with that, except that I thought that Star Wars was a FAMILY movie.  When Qui-Gon Jinn knocks out Jar Jar Binks to calm him down, only kids laugh;  everyone else cries tears of joy because he finally shut up.  There are only a few and far between moments in the movie where the entire audience extrapolates the same emotion from a scene (Anakin's heartrending departure from Tatooine is a popluarly cited example).  I was thouroughly disappointed.  As for the DVD extras, who cares?  The extras should complement what the main course is;  here, it's like an M&M that's no chocolate and all colorful candy shell...

B000062Y98|5.0|Power metal band Blind Guardian has done what few other bands can do. They have diversified their style without losing the aspects that made them great in the past. The new album combines true power with soaring melodies. If you're already a fan of Blind Guardian, then this album needs no introduction. If you aren't, then prepare yourself for a musical experience unlike any you will find with other bands. Expert musicianship and perfectionist-like detail has gone into every song. With every listen, you will enjoy this album more and more. Whether you enjoy speed (and the album is plenty fast) or melody (and the album has plenty of harmony) then you will greatly appreciate Blind Guardian's excellent ability to blend these two so that no one aspect outweighs the others. If you are looking for a band that lifts themselves above the status quo, then you will not be disappointed
B000060P79|5.0|when i first heard about them, i thought that they would b any other punk band, where the singer just screams without any beat to the song(Thursday, besides for there song understanding in a car crash). I decided to give them a chance and listened to there cd, and to my surprise, i loved it! all there songs are good. some ppl compare them to blink 182 and sum 41, but they r nothing like them. there songs r better, they put there track order so well, that u wouldn't want to skip any song. all there songs r catchy, and would make u want to sing along. my favourite song on this cd is obviously &quot;i'm just a kid&quot;, &quot;my alien&quot;, and &quot;when i'm with you&quot;. so if u want a good cd that u won't get bored of any soon, get this cd. and out of all the cd's i've listened to, this is the best cd ( that's right, even better than linkin park's hybrid theory) my advice to u is to buy this cd.
0385334206|5.0|I can't see myself giving this book anything but five stars. Most novels read more than once, in my opinion, have to be considered good enough for that, though I know that there are exceptions. I first read Breakfast of Champions back in about 1975 or so, and it blew me away. It became the first of many Vonnegut novels I eventually dug into, and the second to be read again (Cat's Cradle as well), but definitely my favorite. His avant-garde sense of humor and easy writing style, especially in this one, was as much a pleasure the second time as the first.<br />The story of Dwayne Hoover and Kilgore Trout, and their crazed antics and lifestyles leading up to their pinnacle meeting point is as hilarious as it can get. It's full of satire and cynicism regarding life in general (especially that of the late sixties and early seventies). The way Vonnegut picks at sex (you'll notice the way he mentions the size of a man's genitalia when introducing a character into the story, just as an author would describe hair or eyes), and racism (for the 'N' word is ridiculed and teased), is sheer lunacy at its most hilarious level.<br />If you're ever in the mood to read something that isn't exactly intended to change the world or move mountains with intellectualism, but at the same time, does have the power to force us to think a little about life, and make us laugh horrendously as well, then this is it.
0792164903|4.0|Tim Burton's latest effort, Sleepy Hollow, is a delight with one exception. We'll get to the exception later, because it's just a judgment call of his that I disagree with. He is one of my favorite directors, and here are some of his most wonderful creations: PeeWee's Big Adventure, Edward Scissorhands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Batman and Batman Returns. Now add Sleepy Hollow to that list.<br />What makes Burton a great director is his style, which is unique to him. His is a childlike point of view, a dreamlike approach in which reality is hardly a consideration. His visions tend to balance delicately somewhere between dreams and nightmares - too humorous to be bad dreams, yet too full of dark images to be good ones. The upstate New York village of Burton's Sleepy Hollow is a quaint and almost inviting one. Still, the sun never shines, and the countryside is anything but inviting. <br />Into this world comes Ichabad Crane [Johnny Depp], a police detective from New York who believes in the scientific approach to solving mysteries. When he is sent to the village to investigate a series of gristly murders, in which the victims are found literally headless, he makes a list of people who might have motive. He scoffs at the villagers' claims that the killer is a Headless Horseman returned from the grave. Unraveling these crimes will also unravel Crane's nerves, as well as his belief in everything's having a rational explanation. <br />Depp, the great physical actor of our times, leads a cast of wonderful performers. Every role is memorable, especially his and Miranda Richardson's. Depp conveys more with his body language than he does with dialog, and he has been a favorite of mine for years. He he can make even a bad movie watchable, and he can make a good one great. You are probably less familiar with Richardson, an English actress who can portray virtually any character.<br />As in any Burton movie, the sets are fascinating. Everything is just a bit out of kilterand exaggerated. Even mundane items have a slightly spooky quality to them. These visual tricks serve the function of drawing the viewer into the movie. They become part of the story.<br />Now, about that judgment call. Sleepy Hollow is filled with enough many violent images to earn it an R rating. I wish they had been toned down. Had Burton chosen to do this, it would have allowed the movie to go out with no more than a PG-13 rating. This would have opened this otherwise delightful period piece to a broader audience. As it is now, I cannot recommend it for younger viewers. I am not, by the way, getting into the fray concerning the general level of violence in entertainment. My remarks are intended to be about this one particular picture.
B00005JKL8|2.0|This movie had every chance to succeed: A great trailer; Owen Wilson and Gene Hackman; a John and Jim Thomas (Predator, Executive Decision) script; a budget of $40 mil.  But for all this, the whole is decidedly less than the sum of it's parts. What happened?<br />Well for one thing, Owen Wilson was all but wasted in his role as Lt. Barnett.  No chances to utilize the deft comic touch he's displayed in Shanghai Noon and Zoolander.  All he had to do in this film was run from guys shooting at him, and while he does that effectively, what's the point?  I wish that he had been given the freedom to do more with the role.<br />Meanwhile Gene Hackman essentially reprises the same role that he had in Crimson Tide, then as a sub captain, now a ship admiral.  Though it is a role his fills well, it's not as interesting anymore.  Also, \\"Enemy Lines\\" strains plausibility more than even the most unbelievable flag-waving war film...the scene where he hides in a graveyard of corpses with the enemy literally walking over him was especially ludicrous.<br />And I found myself annoyed by much of director John Moore's camera work.  Obviously he's yet another commercial director, based on the frenetic herky-jerky camera work on display here.  Can't these guys just hold the camera still and let the action unfold, as opposed to trying to create the action with a bunch of quick cuts and shaky shots?<br />I really wanted this movie to be good, and just because it's better than most of the mediocrity released last year, that's still no excuse.  It could've been much more.<br />Perhaps the true test of a movie's worth: I will not be buying this one when it is available on DVD.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Denounced by several key critics and avoided by many moviegoers, Fight Club has seemingly found its audience on DVD. Pardon the pun, but its a knockout of a movie. Violent? Oh, yes. Gratuitous? I don't think so. I can understand the controversy. Violence in society is at the forefront of today's news. I don't think Fight Club is any more pro-violence than Saving Private Ryan is pro-war. <br />Edward Norton plays a character referred to only as The Narrator. I think this was done for two reasons, one of which I can tell you without writing a plot-spoiler. His character is nameless because he has become so alienated and frustrated that he has no identity left. He is the victim of the empty promises of the bourgeois lifestyle that, sadly, so many of us are caught up in today. Many of us work for corporations so vast that they are both faceless and soulless. Never in history have so many material goods been dangled before us, The the more we acquire, the less fulfilled many of us are. As the movie says, sometimes the things we own wind up owning us. <br />One day, The Narrator comes up with a plan. He starts attending support groups for people with various mental and physical afflictions. He thinks he will feel better if he hangs out with those who are worse off than he is. This works until he meets the chain-smoking, neurotic Marla [Helena Bonham Carter], who has the same plan, but for different reasons. After a few weeks, he confronts her and demands that she change her schedule so that she doesn't go to the meetings on the days he does. When she refuses, he sinks back into his personal abyss. Things change when, on a plane flight, he meets Tyler Dane [Brad Pitt]. Forceful, direct and more than a little anarchistic, Tyler is the antithesis of The Narrator. When our character arrives home, he finds his condominium has been destroyed by a mysterious explosion. Not knowing where to turn, he calls Tyler, the only person recently who has made sense to him. He moves into Tyler's derelict house. Soon, the charismatic Tyler commandeers the basement of a seedy bar and transforms it into a fight club, a place where other frustrated males can beat each other senseless. A few months later, there is a string of clubs across America. Tyler becomes a hero of mythic proportions to the members, and The narrator is always right by his side. <br />The idea of a fight club may sound like a testosterone induced hallucination. To a degree, it is, but that's taking the literal approach. Most of director David Fincher's movies are metaphors, and none is more so than Fight Club. Here he gives us a vision of a vast segment of males suffering a mass identity crisis because modern society has rendered them so powerless. The club is make believe. I fear the identity crisis may be real. Of course, beating each senseless doesn't solve their problems, yet there are many examples in history of groups so oppressed that they wind up taking out their frustrations on each other. Regardless of whether of not you agree with Fincher's assessment, the fact remains that this is a brilliant movie.<br />The cast is superb. Norton and Bonham Carter have excelled in everything they have ever done, and Pitt has his best role since Legends of the Fall.
B00005AR3G|4.0|&quot;Emperor's New Groove&quot; is one of the funniest movies I've seen in some time, which is especially surprising considering it seemed impossible for it to be good given the clumsy concept and horrible title. Disney scrapped the singing animals for once and just went for outright laughs, and they scored big in this tale of an emperor with an attitude that gets taken down a peg when he gets changed into a llama.<br />Casting Patrick Warburton (Puddy from Seinfeld) as the Cronk, the lackey to Ertha Kitt's Yzma was sheer genius...if it was possible to receive an academy award for voice work in an animated feature, he'd have it locked up. Though truly all of the voices are perfect in this movie, and it really does add so much to it. I know that it hasn't been as successful at the box office as some of the other recent Disney films, and that's a shame, because it deserves more recognition. I wish more movies like this were made.
B00003CWN3|4.0|Boys Don't Cry is the movie that earned a Best Actress Oscar for Hilary Swank. Hers was a role few actresses could have played well, and she certainly deserves the praise she got, She has an interesting film career ahead of her. Call her a force to be reckoned Personally, I would have voted for Annette Bening in American Beauty. When I was a kid I, too, was mesmerized by actors playing odd, weird and/or flashy characters. Lately, I have come to the conclusion that playing a so-called normal character well and making that role unforgettable is much harder than it seems. This is a purely personal opinion and is not meant to lessen Ms. Swank's formidable talents in any way.<br />The movie is the story of Teena Brandon [Swank], and, while some of the facts have been altered, it is a true story. Brandon was a troubled young girl from the Midwest who, in the early 1990s, decided that she should live her life as a boy. She wanted to literally change her sex. There is a tiny percentage of males who wish to become female in America, and, apparently, the number of women wanting to become men is even smaller. Teena Brandon became Brandon Teena. Outside of New York, Los Angeles or San Francisco, Brandon would have been considered an oddity, if not a threat. He, as I have come to think of Brandon, attempted to do it in an impoverished, backwoods setting, and the results were tragic. <br />As a movie, Boys Don't Cry is the most impassioned plea for tolerance seen in a long time. It is difficult to watch it and not feel compassion for Brandon, if only because he was one of life's doomed souls. Ms. Swank portrays him as almost a ruffian, yet one who is essentially an innocent. Because the change [and the deception] works for Brandon, he honestly believes it should work for the people he meets. That is to say, since he accepts himself as a man, why can't others be fooled indefinately. He knows that people must not find out he is really a woman, but he does not think through how theymight react if they do.<br />Brandon winds up in a small town where he falls in love with Lana [Chloe Sevigney, nominated for Best Supporting Actress]. She's a nice enough girl. It's her family and her mother's friends who are dangerous. Lana can do little about her family, and Brandon turns a blind eye to potential problems. He does everything he can to ingratiate himself with them and is successful at first.<br />I am trying not to give away too much of the plot here, but it is impossible to write even a bare-bones summary without evoking a sense of foreboding about the whole situation. It would also be unfair not to remark that Boys Don't Cry is brilliant but dark. It is both the most poignant and the most depressing movie of 1999. I highly recommend it, but warn you to prepare yourself for a heart-wrenching and soul-searching experience.
B00003CXHJ|4.0|The movie was exceptionaly good. I still watch is alot. Though Hollywood as made a simple almost misktake into and American Covert Special Ops Mission. The Royal Navy got the Enigma from a U-Boat in mid '42 I think. Though the Americans did get an Enigma from the U-505 not to mention towing the entire boat back to America. I also have a problem understanding how they could hit a submerged U-Boat. I don't know how easy it would be but they make it out to look like;&quot;FIRE&quot;-BOOM-&quot;SURFACE&quot;. I still like the movie just because of how entertaining it is and most of the Naval Warfare accuracies.
6305807086|5.0|In the annuals of movie comedy history, there has never been anything quite like Being John Malkovich. I hope there never is again, not for negative reasons, but because it should float out there forever like some special little planet. Then, decades from now, people can look back and see a unique sample of where originality was at the end of the Twentieth Century. The following plot information should be enough to say whether or not it belongs in your universe. Obviously, it fits in fine in mine.<br />Craig Schwartz is a gifted and frustrated puppeteer. I think all puppeteers are frustrated, but manual dexterity is not a talent of mine. I don't hold a ball-point pen. I have to clutch it, or else I flip it across the room. Craig lives in New York with his wife Lotte [Cameron Diaz], who runs a pet shop. She has a bad habit of bringing injured or frustrated animals home. The house is a menagerie. We quickly see that both of these people are highly manipulative. When Lotte suggests that Craig find a normal job [just until his puppeteer career takes off, of course], he grudgingly starts looking for one. He spies an ad from The Lester Corp. that seeks a short person who can file quickly. When he arrives at the building listed, he looks at the directory, only to find that Lester is supposedly on floor 7 1/2. Indeed, it really is. The floor is two-thirds the height of a normal one. Propelled by curiosity and a sense of the ridiculous, Craig goes ahead and gets the job.<br />Working at Lester Corp. is a challenge that goes far beyond having to walk around all day stooped over. The Executive Secretary literally does not hear what anyone says to her. She isn't deaf. It's worse than that. Everything said to her is translated into something else. She's straight out of Alice in Wonderland. Dr. Lester [Orson Beane] thinks about nothing else but chasing women. He's 105 years old. And as for coworker Maxine [Catherine Keener], she is nothing short of insane - not homicidal, but simply mad as a hatter. Yet for a puppeteer, who dreams of performing at Lincoln Center, and for his wife, who lives in her own furry critter world, the situation is not that far removed from their own reality. <br />One afternoon Craig accidentally knocks some papers off a file cabinet. He has to move the cabinet to retrieve them and discovers a little door. He opens it and finds a cave-like passage, just big enough for him to crawl into, which, like any sane man, he promptly does. Suddenly, the door slams shut behind him, and a sudden great wind propels him down a long tunnel. He finds himself peering at the world through someone else's eyes. That someone looks in a mirror, and Craig realizes he is inside the real John Malkovich's head. He is fascinated by this phenomenon, but soon enough he goes flying out and crashes onto the side of the New Jersey Turnpike. <br />There is much more to the story, but this is more than enough to tell you if you find it very original or unimaginably stupid. If the story is to your taste, there is more good news. First-time director Spike Jonze, who made a name for himself doing music videos and commercials, is an astounding talent. He has learned a lot in his twenty-nine years. I don't know if he cast the movie, but the choices are shrewd because Cusack, Diaz, Keener and Mary Kay Place all have played in a number of original, off the wall or screwball comedies. Here are a few of the titles: The Player [1992], Grosse Pointe Blank ['97], My Best Friend ['98], There's Something About Mary ['98] and Pecker ['98]. I recommend all of these. These actors are obviously at home in this kind of movie. As a film buff, the icing of the cake is John Malkovich. This is the first film comedy of his long career, but here he is, not only surviving in style in this madhouse, but also playing himself.
0783227272|3.0|Stephen Spielberg directs another cracking film telling the story of pre-Civil War American history and the 1840s trials of African slaves who rebel and are taken prisoner to America where their vision of the land of the free soon becomes a horrendous scene of slavery and the battle to enforce its abolition. Essentially this film lives and dies in the courtroom but Spielberg also creates some wonderful historic images of the prelude to the Africans' capture. Admittedly there are the usual typecast figures of evil (Spanish sailors) and good (Morgan Freeman as the appointed Chief) but this is definitely a great film. <br />Pitched into the centre of the justice system which seems determined to prejudice the hopes of the Africans is a future American president, a young revolutionary lawyer, a fervent abolitionist, all of whom join forces to fight against the High Court where the case reaches its final verdict. There is certainly no absence of action or emotion and Spielberg addresses the plight and issues of slavery with the collective genius we have come to expect from this director. This is by no means his best film since it is, in plot and occasionally character, flawed but certainly worth having a look at if you've got an evening in with little else to do.
B00003CWLF|4.0|The movies have a way of returning to the tried and true, and that includes the many reincarnations of the story of Anna Leonowens, an English school teacher who set off in 1862 to teach the children - 58 of them! - sired by King Mongkut of Siam. The basis of the story is fact. There was an Anna, and there was a King Mongkut. The movies are all more fact than fiction. First there was Anna and the King of Siam, a 1946 version starring Rex Harrison and Irene Dunn. 1955 saw the spectacular, though now dated, The King and I, based on the Rogers and Hammerstein musical. Early 1999 brought an animated version of The King and I, which deservedly flopped. Six months later Anna and the King was released. It, too, failed, though for altogether different reasons, and I doubt we will be seeing much more of Anna or Mongkut at the local multiplex. I do, however, hope many people will buy this 'final' version, for it presents something not often seen these days - true spectacle. <br />When Anna Leonowens arrives in Siam with her young son, Louis, things are not as she expected them to be. It isn't the place, which she knows from having lived in India is a world apart from her native England. After she has been kept waiting for three weeks with nothing to do, she finally meets the king. She demands that she be given something to do. This action stuns both the king and the court, for he is an absolute ruler and considered to be a god. She then reminds him of his promise to provide her with a house outside the palace walls. He angrily refuses to do this, yet, like many people who are used to everyone's doing their biding, he is intrigued and amused by this small woman who dares to stand up to him. He is well educated and thoughtful. He knows a good thing when he sees it. <br />Anna greatly enjoys teaching his children, as well as several of his many wives and concubines. Later, despite being warned, she meddles in some royal affairs, and one of her intrusions leads to tragic consequences. Still, the bond between Anna and the king becomes increasingly stronger and leads to a romance which, under the circumstances, can never be fulfilled. Amid all this, there is the constant threat of English backed Burmese troops, who threaten to topple Mongkat's kingdom.<br />Jodie Foster and Yun-Fat Chow make a striking couple as Anna and Mongkut, and they are a great pleasure to watch. But it is the spectacle which dominates the movie. The sets, especially the royal palace, are monumental. The costumes are lavish and colorful. The photography is as good as any we are likely to see, and the music is first-rate.<br />This version of the story is no more factual than its predecessors, but the makers do at least make the king into an intelligent ruler and depict the British as being rather ruthless, which they must have been in order to have dominated so much of the world at that time. Despite this, the movie failed to make money, and I think this may be because its pluses - the spectacle and the majesty of it - also served to make it seem too old-fashioned to today's young audiences. This makes it a rare treat for older viewers, something to simply enjoy on a quiet summer night.
0767835255|3.0|If you can switch off the demand for realism from a film for a couple of hours then this is for you. Harrison Ford and Glenn Close start in this Box Office blockbuster about Soviet revolutionaries who hijack the US Presidential place (Air Force One) and the heroic one-man battle against them in the guise of the US President who remains aboard the plane. Gary Oldman plays Egor Korshunov, a trigger-happy terrorist who fires at will and is prepared to sacrifice his life for \\"Mother Russia\\" whilst Glenn Close's negotiating skills bring for an interesting aside to the main plot. As I mentioned, it is essential that the flying scenes (look for the one at the start involving their return to the air) and rescue scenes are not taken as rigorous to the truth as, in many respects, they are as flimsy as the security systems aboard Air Force One.<br />In general this is not a bad film (after all, the Box Office ratings were good) and as far as typical blockbusters go, I could probably watch it again. Some good special effects improve it and there is always something going on, it could be argued that there are some holes in the plot but then nothing is going to be perfect! Definitely watchable but don't rush out to get it.
B00003CWL6|5.0|The first time I saw the now famous poster for American Beauty was months before it opened. I was going down the escalator of a posh local multiplex, and there it was at the end of my descent. I looked at those red roses adorning an actresses midsection, and I remarked to a friend that this looked like a very special movie. I don't what it was about the artwork that made me say that, but it turned out to be an accurate remark. The movie opened in a limited engagement in September 1999 and went on to build and build. In March, it won Oscars in major categories - Best Picture, Best Actor [Kevin Spacey] and Best Director. At the time, there were some nay-sayers who said the film painted too dark a picture of American life. I won't debate this, but I will say that there are precedents in the Academy Awards. For example, Billy Wilder's The Apartment, a scathing comedy about how morally low some people will go to move up in corporate life, won Best Picture in 1961. Brilliant is brilliant, no matter what the subject is, and America has had a seriously cynical side to it for decades.<br />Welcome to the Burnham household. Meet Lester and Carolyn [Spacey and Annette Bening] and their lovely teenage daughter, Jane [Thora Birch]. The Burnhams have it all - the lucrative jobs, the topflight public schools, the perfect suburban home, the immaculate lawn with its borders of American beauty roses. What could possibly be missing from their lives? Oh, just little things like happiness and fulfillment. Lester and Carolyn certainly no longer love each other. Theirs is an uneasy truce. On the surface, Jane comes across as a snide and ungrateful child, but you have to ask yourself who wouldn't be eager to leave such a dismal scene? How often many of us point the finger at our children when what we are showing them are lives devoid of love, passion, honestly and integrity.<br />Jane is a cheerleader at the local high school, and one night the Burnhams decide to attend a game. They want to show support for their daughter, who truly doesn't want them there. Lester sees another cheerleader, a friend of Jane's, and instantly falls in lust. He becomes obsessed with the girl. He quits his job and blackmails his boss into giving him $60,000 severance pay. He buys a red Pontiac Firebird. Carolyn, who constantly berates herself for not being a success, retaliates by starting an affair with an arch rival in the real estate business. Their actions are not exactly what they appear to be. Lester's pursuit isn't all about an older man / young girl relationships. Its about the loss of youth and passion and about the dire consequences that can be spawned by living a whole lifetime of fitting in. Carolyn feels she has totally lost controlnot just of Lester and Jane, but of life as a whole. I think they are after the same answers, only Lester uses a brutally honest approach. And now Jane is really ready to split. <br />Compounding all these problems is the arrival of some strange new neighbors. Col. Frank Fitts is a retired Marine who's feelings are so repressed he's become a walking time bomb. His wife has retreated into a haunting, silent world of her own. Teenage son Ricky is obsessed with videotaping everything he encounters, including Jane. He supports his hobby by dealing vast quantities of dope. Soon Jane and Ricky have a thing going, and everything climaxes for all involved in one bizarre night of the most memorable and improabable miscommunications. <br />Is this a comedy or a drama? That's hard to say. Many viewers do not relate to the Burnhams specific problems, but they do identify with their general feelings. In laughing at them, many of us are laughing at ourselves. Take the problem of trying too hard to fit in. There is nothing wrong with doing this, unless you lose your own identity in the process. And many would agree that, while there is nothing fundamentally wrong with being American, there is currently something fundamentally wrong with Americanlife. Personally, I think it has less to do with moral issues than it does with a basic spiritual emptiness that comes with being obsessed with external appearances and with material goods. <br />American Beauty is a brilliant movie and, to me, probably was the best American film of 1999. Like a few others before it, it stands uniquely on its own, owing very little to movies that came before it. I love the way it peels away the layers of the Burnhams' lives like onions. I admire its essentially nonjudgmental point of view. Best of all, I like the way that everyone is somehow redeemed at the end. Its a movie that makes you wish there were a few more great ones like it out there.
B00005LLK8|4.0|Amazingly a film which was profiled as being &quot;The Film of the Year&quot; which actually lived up to its reputation as a powerful, humorous, gritty and sentimental drama about courage, determination and a desire to succeed despite non-conformity. I've seen this film twice and I find something new in it each time, whether it is the stirring scenes with Billy as he struggles for acceptance or the impassioned hatred of those returning to work in what are extremely realistic scenes from the Miners' Strike.<br />Brought up by his father in the harsh back streets of County Durham during the strikes, Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) is actively encouraged to participate in boxing by his father yet he discovers a new talent ..for ballet. Short of asking outright to be ostracised, Billy fervently pursues his passion with Julie Andrews as his practical and emotional mentor before his father and brother discover what is going on, bringing about a scene of evocative anger, frustration and stubbornness. After applying for trials at the London Ballet School, Billy demonstrates his routine for his friend Michael, the teenager struggling to deal with his homosexuality, but his father walks in on him and is forced to confront his morals, dreams and principles.<br />To go any further would ruin the ending but this is a fantastic picture with a wonderful soundtrack, see it if only for the epic chase scene involving Billy's brother and the police to the tune of London Calling from The Clash. This is truly fantastic and justifies itself as one of the films of the year.
B00003CXDV|4.0|Galaxy Quest opened around Christmas 1999 against a lot of high profile movies. It never set any records, but it ran and ran and ran, eventually doing better than many of its competitors. It's easy to see why. It's mindless and daffy, yet also amiable and funny. It's the gentlest of satires. It does not aspire to greatness. It aspires to entertain, and that it does. <br />The title refers to a fictional TV show about space travel and conquest, and it seems suspiciously like Star Trek. The movie opens with the has- been cast of the show, which ended twenty years ago, at a convention of fans. Most of the actors are there for the money and not for the geeky, obsessed fans. The exception is Jason Nesmith [Tim Allen], who played Commander Peter Taggart. Nesmith tries hard not to ruin the fans' fantasies. One group actually tells him they are there to enlist the crew in saving their planet, and he atiently plays along. Later, in the men's room, Nesmith overhears two kids talking about how sad and stupid the cast and the fans are. Crushed, he flees the convention and goes home, where he promptly consumes a great deal of whiskey. The next morning finds him passed out on his living room floor. Outside the sliding glass door, the same weird group that wanted him to help them is knocking on the glass. In a fog, he lets them in. One thing leads to another, and he discovers that they really ARE aliens. They think that the TV show is real, a historical record of real events. Apparently these aliens have no imaginations, and when they recorded the show's TV signal, the idea that the information might be false never crossed their minds. Oh, how earthling advertisers would love this crowd!<br />It isn't long before Nesmith and the aliens have enlisted the rest of the stars - Lt. Tawny Madison [Sigourney Weaver], Dr. Lazurus [Alan Rickman], Tech. Sgt. Chen [Tony Shalhoub], and even an extra, Crew Member 6 [Sam Rockwell]. This group of very earthbound people suddenly finds itself in outer space aboard a craft that is based on their old TV show sets. What are they supposed to do? How can they work instruments that never really existed or combat monsters and aliens which are not actors in costumes? The answers they come up with help make this one of the funnier comedies in recent memory.<br />Allen and Weaver are perfectly cast, for who would be better in this parody than the fumbling star of Home Improvement and the heroine of the Aliens movies? What could be funnier than to have Alan Rickman basically reprise his role as Col. Brandon in Sense and Sensibility, only this time in space? What could be more clever than to include an extra, who spends the entire movie knowing he's going to die in the next ten minutes because that's what happened on the TV show? And the aliens? They are hysterical to watch. Theier actual body shapes resemble giant squids, but they have the ability to transform into human-looking beings. Only problem is that they can't quite get the body movements down right, not to mention the voices.<br />I think it must be hard to make a movie that's just plain fun, but Galaxy Quest succeeds nearly all the time. Frankly, I was never much of a Star Trek or a Star Wars fan. I appreciated their appeal but never got caught up in the fantasies. I enjoyed this movie immensely, even though most of the in jokes were lost on me. I can only imagine how appealing it must be to people who are more informed about the things it parodies than I am.

630587493X|2.0|Bicentennial Man is based on questions that have long been popular in science fiction. More recently, they has gained attention in science and philosophy. As man creates increasingly sophisticated machines, how far will we go in giving them intelligence? If we reach a point where we can make them rational, will they be able to rationalize? Will they ever develop feelings? If they can do these things, then what exactly will we call them? This movie tries to answer these questions in a gentle, sometimes humorous way. Unfortunately, it has a tendency to use the 'feel good' approach, and the results are disjointed. Many viewers will have a question of their own at the end. That question may be either &quot;Huh?&quot; or &quot;What?&quot; <br />In the year 2005, a welathy man has a robot or android delivered to his lavish suburban home. The robot, which looks suspiciously like Robin Williams because he/it is played by Williams, is silver and manniquin-like. It is programmed to be the modern version of a servant or, considering it is a machine, a slave. It cooks, cleans, talks and responds to voice commands. The man's wife finds the android, quaintly named Andrew by one of the children, to be distracting. The youngest daughter adores it, at first treating it like a highly intelligent pet, later as a good friend. The elder daughter can't stand it. At one point, she orders it to jump out of a second story window, which causes quite a bit of damage to it. Considering how annoying and too cute it often is, she may have the right idea. It doesn't take Dad long to find out that Andrew has unexpected gifts. He is very artistic and seems to have feelings. The manufacturer insists that the robot is defective, but Dad refuses to trade Andrew in. Instead, he teaches the android many things about life, love and human beings. After several years, Andrew wants to be human. He also wants his freedom and sets off on a long journey around the world to try to find others like himself. Whenhe returns, he has many more experiences. In fact, the movie covers a period of two hundred years.<br />I don't know what to say about Robin Williams at times. It's as though he is both the best and the worst of actors. Perhaps it's because of his demeanor or because he has such a dominant, recognizable personality. When I watch him in a serious dramatic scene, there is usually something in those dark, dancing eyes that suggests he's about to go into a series of wisecracks at any moment. I suppose I am suggesting that he stick with comedy, because it's impossible for me to take him seriously. Take this role. There may be things which are dark and compelling about a robot who yearns to be human and who almost gets there, but there is also a humorous side to this situation. In the comic scenes, Williams is great. Ultimately, though, this is a drama, and it's unfortunate that another actor wasn't cast in the role. Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Johnny Depp come to mind. <br />Bicentennial Man spends nearly half its running time on Andrew's first few years with the family. That means the next 180 years are sketchy at best, and this weakens the film. The last half is more of a series of sketches than it is a linear story.

B000053VAF|4.0|Dogma caused such a controversy, especially among a small but vocal group called the Catholic League, that the normally liberal distributor, Miramax Films, sold the right to a small company called Lions Gate. Weeks before the movie opened, the League sent out numerous letters and E-mails that asked people to boycott the film. If there is a lesson to be learned in all this, it is a reminder that we shouldn't judge things sight unseen. Dogma certainly pokes much fun at the Catholic church as an institution, but ultimately it is one of the more spiritual movies of the last decade. It's main fault is its tendency to delve into theological questions that many non-Catholics will not understand. It is much less insidious that the recent End of Days, which had homicidal Catholic priests running around preaching mumbo-jumbo. <br />It seems that a few thousand years ago, a couple of angels named Bartleby and Loki [Ben Affleck and Matt Damon] got tossed out of Heaven for refusing to do their jobs. They were banished to Wisconsin, where they still reside toady. In New Jersey, a hip archbishop is trying to make the church less stodgy and more appealing. The banished angels discover that when the archbishop rededicates a cathedral there, a portal will open which will allow them to go back to Heaven. All will be forgiven. There is a little problem with their doing this. When they go through the portal, it will prove that God can be wrong and is, therefore, fallible. Since everything is predicated on the Almighty's being always right, their reentry will cause the universe to cease to exist. Bartleby and Loki are willing to risk this. Anything to get out of the Midwest, I presume.<br />Things are about to change dramatically for Bethany Sloane [Linda Fiorentino], a reasonably well adjusted young woman who works at an abortion clinic. She's definately a lapsed Catholic. One night a fiery angel called Metatron [Alan Rickman] appears at the foot of her bed. She tries to put him out with a fire extinguisher, only to find it's really hard to get rid of a persistent immortal. He wisks her off in her night clothes to a Mexican restaurant, where he informs her that she is The Chosen One, the one charged with preventing Bartleby and Loki's passing through the portal. He tells her she will be aided by two prophets, who soon appear as two spaced out drifters. These guys may be carrying a message, but they certainly don't know it. Soon the trio, aided by Rufus, who claims he was the thirteenth apostle, are hurrying towards their date with destiny. Along the way, they are threatened by Loki and Bartleby, as well as Azarael [Jason lee], an avenging angel with an attitude. <br />Frankly, any attempt to explain the plot makes the whole thing seem somewhat sacrilegious. The movie isn't that at all. Dogma can be defined as a doctrine concerning faith or morals authoritatively proclaimed by a church, and the picture is much more faithful to the dogma of the Catholic church than almost any film I have seen. I can only imagine that what caused such a stir about the movie is that it is a comedy. And a very funny one, at that. I still contend that, if the Church is ever actually damaged by movies, the harm is done by 'serious' psycho-babble dramas like The Omen and The Exorcist. That's because such fare, while highly entertaining, tends to portray Catholics as superstitious and as very vulnerable to any whim Satan may have. Satan isn't even around in Dogma, a movie which, if it does anything at all, promotes spirituality, albeit with a smirk, a grin and a multitude of profanities.

B000002NHN|5.0|Her absolute best compilation yet. The Mummer's Dance even made it to the pop charts! Check out all her music!
B00005B36H|5.0|WOW! Where should I start?  First a little background.  I have always liked what I have heard of tool on the radio, but never enough to buy anything. The reason for this was that I was tired of angry and negative lyrics, and for some reason expected the albums to reflect this.<br />Anyway, I had heard schism on the radio, and was impressed.  A friend bought the album and told me it was awesome.  I had a gift certificate that I recieved for X - mas, and couldn't think of anything to use it on, so I figured \\"why not\\".  LATERALUS arived three days later in the mail.  I gave an attempt at listening, but it didn't captivate me and it sat on the shelf for the next three weeks.  After that, I decided to give it another go, this time accompanied by lyric sheets, and it was an entirely new experience.  From the opening note on \\"The Grudge\\" I was captivated.  The musical atmospheres draw you in, and it is very very tough not to listen to the whole album. Maynard's lyrics are his most ambitious to date.  I especially enjoyed the lack of profanity.  The lyrics are at times tribal and ancient sounding, and the over all theme of living in the moment and being happy was refreshing.  To the untrained ear the album comes of as very hard and unstructured, but people often dont realize the incredible amount of artistry that is put in to the time signatures.  The guitarist is probably the least talented member of the band, yet the rifs are very creative and add to the over all mood of the album.  The drums are the best I have ever heard!!  The composition and precision is something I have heard in no other drummer, And the fills are something I had to rewind and listen to again in amazement. This disc get inside your head like no other!!! <br />This cd takes time to get to know.  Its like a girl that wont quite kiss you on the first date. (or the second or third for that matter)  However after some effort on your part, it becomes quite the pleasurable experience.  A definate must own.
6303433766|5.0|A unique masterpiece, which infuses ingenious camera techniques, solid acting, and a well-adapted script.  Stars Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey in their film debuts.  Both show promise and this film is more Lynskey's than Winslet's, but Lynskey has yet to become a household name (she will sooner or later).  This film is based on the most celebrated trial in placid New Zealand, the Parker-Hulme case, which concerned the girls' murder of one of their mothers in the 1950's. What's intriguing about it is that one of the girls (Hulme) turns out to be the celebrated mystery writer, Anne Perry. <br />Winslet plays Juliet Hulme, an English debutante who moves to Christchurch, New Zealand when her father becomes the Rector of the town's college.  As a child she suffered from tuberculosis and like the stereotypical upper-crust English, her parents neglected her by abandoning her in the Caribbean.  She strikes up a friendship with the class wallflower, Pauline Parker, a girl of a lower socio-economic background, who also suffered from a childhood illness and felt outcast.  They soon become best friends and pursue their interests in writing stories and listening to opera to escape their mundane surroundings.  Scarily, their imagination takes over and they lose touch with reality.  Their emotional dependence on each other frightens their parents, who fear their daughters have developed homosexual feelings for each other.  As a solution, they attempt to separate the girls.  Juliet is to live in South Africa with her relatives and Pauline is not granted a passport.  The girls view Pauline's mother (Sarah Peirse) as the main obstacle of staying together.  They hatch a plan to kill her and make it look like an accident.  <br />The director, Peter Jackson, presents the story from the girls' perspective.  The viewer is sucked into their visually rich fantasy-world, and one sympathizes with their plight.  One understands the girls' disillusionment with their parents, when Juliet discovers her mother (Diana Kent) is having an affair with a married man.  Pauline's parents, it is discovered during the trial, were never married.  In fact, her father was still legally married to his first wife.  Jackson, who understandably was the perfect director to direct Lord of the Rings, utilizes clay animation, timely editing and angular use of the camera.  And most important of all is the script, based mostly on Pauline Parker's diaries written during the two year period leading up to the horrifying crime.  The result is the most original film in decades.<br />FYI, the girls were released when they turned 21 years old on condition that they never meet.  Perry, who took her stepfather's surname, her stepfather being the man her mother was having an affair with, currently resides in Scotland.  Surprisingly and coincidentally, so does Parker, although they have yet to meet again.  They both are doing what they dreamed of when they met-Perry writing books and Parker riding horses (she runs a horseback riding academy).  Perry, who lived in the US for a number is years, is a devout Mormon and Parker is a devout Catholic.  They both eschewed religion as teenagers.
B00000K0DV|3.0|This particular Fulci film is completely banned in the UK, and, having just watched the uncut US Anchorbay DVD, to some extent I can see why the 'British Board of Film Classification' (even the word 'censor' is censored in this country, in would appear) balked at the idea of releasing it.  Indeed, it is rumoured that after watching the film for the first time in the early 1980s, the BBFC ordered it to be removed from the country forthwith, complete with a Police escort.  To be fair to the BBFC, the film is indefensible in many respects - I do not recall seeing a single man in the film who did not sport some extremely reactionary views about women, and the lingering graphic violence portrayed against the female victims does indicate that Fulci had some 'issues' with women himself.  That said, however, this has more of a coherent plot than most Fulci films and considerably better pace. I watched this alongside 'Bloodsucking Freaks' and compared to Joel M. Reed's film, this comes across as 'Citizen Kane'.  Not to everyone's taste, and I doubt if you will ever find a women who would have anything positive to say about it all, but personally I still think UK adults should be allowed to make up their own minds about what they can watch rather than have the state decide for them.  If they had not banned this film, I would not have gone out of my way to watch it!!!
B000002GXJ|2.0|The Eagles put out some good albums before Hotel<br />California, and Hotel California was nearly a great record.<br />They followed Hotel California with the lethargic \\"The<br />Long Run\\" and this contractual fulfillment.<br />Four reasons to hate this album:<br />1) Dull as dust. No surprises, no significant changes to the<br />  arrangements relative to the studio albums, no compelling<br />  reason to listen to this.<br />2) The least live \\"live\\" album in history. A comparison of this<br />  album with bootleg versions of the same shows demonstrates<br />  just how overdub/rerecord crazy the Eagles went with this.<br />  No warts, just airbrushed mediocrity.<br />3) Dull, unsurprising, uninteresting song selections, save<br />  a modest Steve Young cover (good song, bland performance)<br />4) A rip off: This set runs less than 78 minutes and could<br />  easily fit on one CD. Why is it on 2 CDs even after the<br />  1999 remastering? Why, for the same reason that they are<br />  still selling the chintzy short vinyl era greatest hits<br />  album for full price: Money grab.<br />Skip this one.<br />dap
B00005UKKF|4.0|I began watching this DVD believing I was going to hate it.  But, as I got further and further into it, I was amazed at Britney's dancing skills.  I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I really liked this concert and DVD.  I think it was one of the best &quot;music&quot; DVD's I have.  It is a good DVD to watch over and over again.  It's really a wonderful thing, because it never gets boring to watch.  It's always entertaining no matter how many times you watch it.  I would recommend this Britney DVD to anyone who wants to be amazed by dancing and be pumped up to the music!
B000062Y98|5.0|Oh dear Lord, it's finally here. The most beautiful album released by anyone in years upon years, if ever. The wait has been rediculous, but as with most good things, it was worth it. The wait for this album was also with good reason. Just listen to the production, the choirs, and insane amount of guitar layering and complicated songwriting. Sure, this is common with Blind Guardian, but they've finally out-done themselves, I believe. Read on to see one forever-committed fan's analysis of this masterpiece of operatic metal brilliance.<br />Let's start with the song by song review now...<br />Precious Jerusalem - Heavy, fast, and very cool vocals. A departure for Guardian with the more eastern feel, but an incredible way to start the album, especially with the very fast rhythm and singing about 50 seconds in. Wow. (10/10)<br />Battlefield - A great clean intro to this gets you anticipating the chaos that awaits. Great bass drumming throughout, good guitar leads, and a bridge and faster part that make you just want to, I don't know, go crazy. Great song. (10/10)<br />Under The Ice - Trippy intro, again with an eastern feel throughout the song. Back to the good old dark lyrical style. Great dark lyrics, even. A very singable chorus (if you can hit those higher notes). Great song, very emotional. (10/10)<br />Sadly Sings Destiny - Incredibly cool and bizarre intro to this one. The most upbeat track on the album, but with aggressive singing throughout the verses. It's a departure, and one of the best songs on the album. The lyrics are obscurely uplifting, and make you feel good. It's a fun song, with great instrumentals. Definitely a classic. (11/10)<br />The Maiden and the Minstrel Knight - Much slower than the rest so far, and very emotional. Just to keep you on your toes, it kicks in hard at about 2 minutes, still keeping that same heartfelt emotion. Great use of orchestration, choir vocals, and a great guitar solo. Very singable in the car, too. :-) (10/10)<br />WaitFor An Answer - The most uplifting song on the album lyrically. Trashes on \\"spreading disease\\", \\"Ignorance\\", and \\"Hate like a fowl cancer.\\" It can be interpreted in many ways, including the tragedy of 9/11, or as loosely as racism. Musically it's very good and very powerful, VERY powerful. Has a killer groove to it, too. It's only problem is that it's somehow not very catchy at first, but it really grows on you, and with great (and I mean GREAT) instrumentals. (10/10)<br />The Soulforged - Based on Dragonlance, this one is heavy, fast, and upbeat. Incredibly catchy chorus, and I mean incredibly catchy. Again, great guitar work, as Andre and Marcus(Magnus?) are so consistent with. Another of my favorites, and that's all there is to it. (11/10)<br />Age Of False Innocence - The opening piano reminds you a bit of \\"The Eldar\\" from Nightfall In Middle-Earth with added orchestration, but it gets a lot more aggressive, a lot faster. Another emotional one, but heavier than \\"The Maiden and the Minstrel Knight.\\" It's really a great song with more clean guitar than the rest of the CD, along with great leads. Andre Olbrich never ceases to amaze me with his unique solos. He uses scales like I've never seen, and they're amazing. (10/10)<br />Punishment Divine - Awesome. Incredible lyrics, great vocal lines, blistering leads, and what I believe to be the heaviest song on the album. This one gets you going in ways you have to hear to believe, and it's an unstoppable juggernaut reminiscent of tracks like \\"I'm Alive\\" and \\"Another Holy War\\" from Imagination From The Other Side. Very cool song. (10/10)<br />And Then There Was Silence - Now this one is interesting. It's the longest song that Blind Guardian have ever done, and it's musically probably also the best. It's over 14 minutes long, and has probably some of the catchiest choruses and most powerful verses on the album, but it takes quite a few listens to appreciate all of them to the fullest. This one also boasts the least amountof lead guitar on the cd. Almost all the power is in the rhythm guitars, Hansi's incredible vocals, and and great orchestration. The climax of the whole thing comes at around the 9-10 minute mark, and it kind of just winds down from there. One of the greatest epics written, save perhaps Maiden's \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner.\\" Absolutely incredible, but we're not through yet.... (11/10)<br />Mies Del Dolor - ... for there's still one more! The Spanish version of Harvest Of Sorrow(which is found in English on the And Then There Was Silence single), finishes off this musical journey in a very mellow and beautiful way. Marcus' accoustics are great, and Hansi's Spanish vocals sound just a good. <br />Truly my favorite album in my collection of over 300. It beat Gamma Ray's No World Order and their own N.I.M.E. and I.F.T.O.S. into the ground to take the top spot in my mind, and it'll be a few weeks probably before I listen to anything else. So, get out your card or your keys and get this album!!!! Cheers!
0694003611|5.0|My daughter and I read this every night...and we have been doing so since she was a few months old.  Start your own bedtime ritual with this classic.  Goodnight stars, goodnight moon...and goodnight baby.
0375703861|3.0|I both hated and loved this book.  <br />First, I was amazed at the writing, and Zadie Smith's breadth of knowledge.  She is obviously extremely talented.  Unfortunately,  these two things are not enought for me.  If I hadn't had to read the book for a reading club, I would have never finished it, which brings me  to to what I disliked about the book.<br />I hated the fact that I couldn't stand any of the characters;  I didn't empathize with them.  Perhaps this is because I am a white American, far removed from the London Zadie Smith writes of, but I doubt it. I don't think that she (the writer) likes  any of her characters, except for perhaps Irie, the only character that actually develops during the course of the novel.  At one point early in the book,  I thought to myself that Zadie Smith must be a rather mean person to describe so many people so hatefully.<br />The thing I disliked most about the book was its unnecessary length.  While the basic story was good, and even interesting,  I  often found myself wanting to skip through pages and pages to the next thing that  moved the story forward.  There were too many pointless dialogues and lengthy background passages.
B00005JKEC|5.0|i loved this tale of crookedness. denzel washington plays his best role as the cop whos very crooked and ethan hawke is the rookie cop. alonzo (dw) exposes hawke to drugs and life on the streets. ok denzel deserves the oscar. hawke does too. this is the most realistic cop movie since one tough cop. just see this.
0805062971|5.0|Definently one of the great novels of this decade.  It shows truly how tied we are to our jobs consumer lifestyles. fast, and thought provocking a must read for just about anyone.
B000002HH2|5.0|Bjrk's best album in my opinion. A must for anyone who likes her style.
6305603847|5.0|Pink Floyd's: the Wall is a visual and lyrical extravaganza. Color's, the lack of colors, drabbness, and isolation all reign free in the world of a rock singer named \\"Pink.\\" The movie plays in crazy animation sequences, ear drum jarring music, and depressing premises to display feelings of insanity and loneliness. Pink surrounds himself with objects both mentally and physically due to harsh pains in his past that are told in glimpsing flashbacks.<br />The Wall is not for people who must have an immediate answer for everything they are seeing. It will probably take time, and  piecing together after it's seen. If you don't like to dive deep into psychotic images of gritty moments, this may not be for you. But I thought it was great for a study!<br />I enjoyed seeing Bob Hoskins play his sweaty manager, paying people off in a panic. (I'm normally use to the \\"Smee\\" version of Bob Hoskins.) And you may catch some other star's as well. The Wall is a movie with several meaning's worth discovering and owning!
B00004YYDI|5.0|perfect DVD, fast delivery. A++++ for the seller
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I really love this CD.  While I had heard Beatle songs for a long time before this as my mom was a Beatles fan, and I had downloaded some, I had yet to actually buy an album.  This was my first Beatle's \\"album\\".  To make a long story short, I now own all 13 of the Beatles Albums plus both Pastmasters, the \\"Blue Album\\", George Harrison's single (My Sweet Lord), Best of John Lennnon CD, and most of McCartney's solo and Wings stuff (he is my favorite).  I'm 20 years old by the way.<br />I know many of you long time Beatle fans are complaining, and maybe if you own all of their stuff already, this CD is probably not for you.  I will admit that now that I have the entire collection on CD, I don't play this one to often.  But for those just starting out, like I was a couple of years ago, this is a very good start.  For [item price], you get all 27 of the Beatle's official # 1 hit singles.  Now many of you have stated that some of the Beatles greatest hits aren't even on here.  That is correct, but keep in mind, if you want to get all of their greatest hits, you need to buy all their albums, cause their is so much to choose from.  This disc is also a much better value then the Red and the Blue albums, as while they may have more songs on them, they cost a lot more and don't make good use of the space available on CDs.  This provides a cheap intro, and it would be almost impossible to squeeze on anymore songs.<br />All in all a great CD which served its purpose well.

B00005OADE|4.0|This release by Uriah Heep saw the departure of vocalist David Byron. He was replaced by John Lawton, who had been a member of Lucifer's Friend from Germany. This gave the band somewhat of a new sound, but their approach to music seemed to change little. Lawton added considerably to the lyrics on the release, also.<br />This release sports 4 bonus tracks to compliment the original Warner Brothers release. They are B sides and alternate versions that sound fairly good. This release sports two tracks that should have been blockbuster songs, but weren't. They are both my favorites off the CD, &quot;The Hanging Tree&quot; and &quot;Rollin' On&quot;. Other songs that are good to listen to include &quot;Been Away Too Long&quot;, &quot;Wise Man&quot;, &quot;Firefly&quot;, and &quot;A Far Better Way&quot;. The B-side &quot;Crime of Passion&quot; is also a good track.<br />Even though Lawton did not stay with Uriah Heep long, his part in the band is unmistakeable. The musicianship is Uriah Heep as most people remember them, it's just the voice that has changed. With this release John Wetton[King Crimson, UK, Asia] left the band and was replaced on bass by Trevor Bolder from Spiders From Mars. This CD is a great earful and I would suggest it to those that like Uriah Heep, Lucifer's Friend, or good music from the latter 70's.
B00004TRD8|5.0|perfect dvd, fast delivery. A++++ on the seller.
B000002LOM|5.0|i agree with one of the previous reviews. i do not understand why so many people don't like this cd. i think that it is one of his best. every song is beautiful and just makes the album flow. i own it and strongly recomend it if you are a morrissey or the smiths fan.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I was unable to catch Donnie Darko in theatrical release because it was not in my area. But I pre-ordered the DVD and It finally came. I just watched it and..... it floored me!!! I won't really say anything about the story. Because you really should watch this film the first time Cold. Let me say that I have liked few films as much as I liked this. The second after it finished watching it I wanted to start it over and watch it again, and only a handful films have ever made me want to do this. I really love this film and I've already reccomended it to all my friends. Great film! Must See!
B00005YW4H|5.0|I was fortunate enough to receive Norah's CD at a local Vineyard that I work at for our tasting room music.  I haven't been able to stop listening to it since I received it.  It's absolutely fabulous.  Every song is sung with so much feeling.  I am amazed that this young 22 year old woman sings with such passion and such a maturity.  I would suggest that if you love Jazz, or just good music in general, this is a wonderful choice.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I have seen hundreds upon hundreds of movies throughout my life and Donnie Darko is one of the most original, enthralling pieces of cinema I have ever seen.  Some people might complain that the movie is flawed, but I have to counter with the idea of choice.  This movie lets you choose what it means.  <br />After I watched this spectacular film, I obtained the music from the film, listened to it all night, while pondering and running through all the ideas presented within.  Of all the junky movies out there, this movie deserves to be seen.
B000002UJQ|1.0|Pompous, morose, often trite.  I just don't get the fuss.
B00005RFAI|4.0|Pink earns credit for lyrics and spunk and although I found the continuity of uneven, the album grows on you.  She is spry and thoughtful.  If you want to jam while driving, the entire album won't do the job, but it will be enjoyble to listen to.
0812550757|4.0|I read the introduction after finishing the book (introductions always seem to ruin a surprise or two in the book if you read them first) ... so I was surprised to find out that Speaker for the Dead was actually Card's original &quot;main&quot; story.  Surprised, only because of how wonderful Ender's Game was ... it's hard to think of it as a prequel.<br />Speaker for the Dead was much broader in scope than Ender's Game, and appealed to the mind whereas Ender's Game appealed to the heart.  Religion on faroff planets, &quot;raman&quot; versus &quot;varelse&quot;, Speakers for the Dead ... what it came down to is that nothing is more powerful, or more comforting, than the Truth.  An idea that applies as much to Ender's world as it does to our own.<br />My only complaint, and probably the only thing that kept me from giving Speaker for the Dead 5 stars, is that I felt like Card introduced so many characters that they all seemed a little static and stereotyped.  The young Ender we laughed and cried with in Ender's Game seemed oddly stiff in SFTD (maybe living 3000 years will do that to you) ... many of the characters seemed to be filling &quot;roles&quot; (Pipo, Libo, and Miro as martyrs, Bishop Peregrino as &quot;The Church&quot;, Ouanda, Ela, and Novinha as victims of fate who need to be &quot;saved&quot; by Ender) ... I wish Card had slowed down just a bit and fleshed out the interesting characters he created.  What made Ender's Game the great read that it is was the emotion the reader feels for young, tragic Ender.  I couldn't help but feel that a little of that emotional attachment was missing from SFTD, which was a little disappointing, as the plot was so absorbing.<br />In spite of that small complaint, I thoroughly enjoyed the book.  I look forward to continuing on and reading Xenocide.
B000062Y98|5.0|Well, I like Blind Guardian's new album more and more with each listening. Everyone I know says &quot;Blind who?&quot; I don't care. Excellent album. Check out Nightfall in Middle-Earth too, I think it's their best album ever. After a few more listens to A Night at the Opera, or ANATO, I think both will be at the top of my metal list for some time.
B00005JKED|4.0|Training Day is at best a slight movie that is elevated to above average thanks entirely to Denzel Washington.  The film is the familiar tale of a rookie cop with high ideals who is paired up with a veteran who looks at the job in a much different light.  Jake Hoyt (Ethan Hawke) wants to be a narcotics officer so he can help clean up the streets and make them safe.  He gets teamed with Alonzo Harris (Mr. Washington) who is more crooked than the criminals themselves.  Through the course of a day, Jake sees the dark side through Harris and you are taken along for the training session.  Mr. Washington just eats up the screen playing against type. He sometimes goes a little overboard (spewing lines like &quot;King Kong ain't got nothin' one me&quot; is a bit much), but overall, he shows why he very well might be the best actor of his generation.  Mr. Hawke is solid as Jake and, although he sometimes can't keep up with Mr. Washington, he acquits himself well.  This film is worth seeing for Mr. Washington's performance alone.
1573226521|5.0|This book is incredible. There is just no other way to put it! I have not seen the movie, it came out when I was younger and not allowed to see anything like that, but I stumbled across the book in my library, and it rung a bell. It is terrifying and wonderful all at once. The book explores the idea that a paradise governed by a little self-contained society has dangerous subtlies. I have read Lord of The Flies as well and I think it's a bit inaccurate the way they compare the two. While Lord of The Flies has a lot of room for interpretation and is not brought to it's fullest potential by the shortness of it, The Beach is an explosion for the mind. It doesn't leave so much room for interpretation as to confuse the reader, the story is fairly straightfoward, right up to it's conclusion, which leaves the exactly perfect amount of imagination as to what they want to see the story as to the reader. I was a little bit confused by some little bits but overall it was wonderful and maybe the reason for the confusion is that I'm only 14 and it was a little bit hard to grasp where the endings of the imaginings with Mister Duck ended and the story began, though I suppose it was designed to be that way. It tends to make you sometimes reread a passage to make sure you're getting it. However this helps explain Richard and how he fits in with the society all the better because the book is almost like his mind laid out in readable form before you.<br />In conclusion, it is excelent, the kind of book that takes a little while to wear off after completing it, leaving you with a chill and a new appreciation for normalcy.<br />READ IT!
6304143184|5.0|Wow i have to say in my book ET was the best movie i have seen as a kid.  I saw this as a very young kid when i was 8 maybe i saw this film and i loved every minute of this movie.  In a nutshell ET was looking for a companion to live with for a while and he had no one to go to but elliot this 10 year old boy being played by Henry Thomas.  He goes and finds ET invites him into his home and goes ahead and keeps him until his people come back to the planet and gets him.  After about maybe a few months ET gets home sick and he wants to go home after the fact halloween comes up and he is going with elliot to the forest and he starts to get sick and begins to get very ill.  The hospital scene is very saddening ET gets very ill to the point he is going to die with out medical attention.  The house is turned into a makeshift hospital and that is where ET and elliot are going to get better however ET is beginning to die on elliot and he goes into cardiac arrest and dies right their on the table and is about ready to go on to be packed in ice to go to the morgue.  However somehow he regains consciousness and goes on to live and leaves for home.  In the end his people come back to get him and ET says his goodbyes to everyone especially elliot which was kind of touching in the end.  I was crying like a baby in the end i was happy for him to finally find the people he needed to find and begin to make his journey home to his home planet.  This year they are going to finally make a remake of the movie which will include scenes that where not in the original movie and that should be very interesting.  All in all the movie is very cool you should go see it in theaters when the remake comes out and enjoy it with your children.
B00005TT77|5.0|When you think about it, this is a remarkable CD: 17 songs by a group that arrived on the scene almost 40 years ago. As a child of the sixties, I am quite surprised and pleased. The phenomenon equates to an album of songs from the 1920's being a top seller in 1964. Didn't happen, as far as I recall.<br />This CD demonstrates the staying power of Beatle music. Almost every song is presented as originally conceived. I learned of the CD when I heard Cheryl Crow's cover of \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" playing in a record store. The original version would land on my list of top ten favorite songs, and Cheryl Crow does a fine job. The interesting selection of songs shows the range of Beatle territory, from fun and frivolous to deep and philosophical.<br />The mix of artists is interesting, contemporary, and quirky. The songs are gorgeous-\\"Blackbird\\" is soul-searing. Eddie Vedder's voice is perfect for the powerful pathos of \\"You've Got to Hide Your Love Away.\\"<br />For those of you addicted to the originals, you'll enjoy the subtle plot twists on some of the songs, and lending your voice to the gorgeous harmonies that Beatles songs prompt. There may be a few songs where you will first say \\"huh?\\", but give it time and even the altered interpretations will catch you. And the CD can serve as a nice bridge for original Beatlemaniacs to discover some interesting young talent.<br />I had to laugh at one reviewer's comments: \\"Nick Cave ends the disc with the worst song of them all, 'Let it Be.' I'll be nice and describe this one as \\"your father's Beatles.\\" Do yourself a favor and just hit the stop button before it gets there.\\" My first reaction was \\"Now wait just a minute, sonny!\\" but then I realized I'd sound like a father. Suffice it to say that for some, this song is pretty damn moving.<br />Young or old, buy and try this CD. I think you will be hooked.

0440178002|5.0|'Historical' fiction is something of a misnomer, as books placed in this category are almost always fiction first and 'historical' only in time and setting. Shogun, however, comes close to being a true example of this field, detailing the late 16th century exploration and exploitation of the Orient by the Portuguese, Dutch, Spanish, and English. As few Americans are aware of some of the atrocities and cruelties committed in the name of crown and religion during this period, some of the scenes depicted in this book may come as shock. But they provide an excellent background portrait of the European mind-set of those times, a palette that Clavell uses to contrast and define the extraordinarily different culture of the Japan of that time.<br />And it is his portrait of the Japanese, his lovingly detailed characterizations of Toranaga, Mariko, Omi and their deeply intertwined interactions with the English pilot Blackthorne that defines and breathes life into this breathtakingly large and complex story of love, war, and political intrigue. And these characters are not static. Each grows and changes as events unfold, most especially Blackthorne himself, growing from a totally self-centered 'barbarian' of unclean habits to a person who can appreciate the beauty, intelligence, and moral rectitude of others, who comes to care deeply for those around him, who comes to understand a philosophy of life totally different from that of his own culture. The reader will eventually take each of these characters into his heart, will live right along with them and their problems, cares, successes, and failures, until they are almost more real than the mundane world the reader inhabits.<br />Is this book totally historically accurate? No, but it doesn't really need to be. It is a fictional account of one of the defining moments of Japanese history, with all the requirements of a work of fiction, written for an American audience, and certain items have yielded to literary license to make the story more approachable by the reader. Certainly Toranaga would not have played chess, but would American readers have understood 'Go' as metaphor for Toranaga's deep political machinations? As a story, a tale of high adventure, as a hard look at alternative life philosophies, as an exposition of a very exotic time, place, and culture, this work succeeds on almost every level. This is an excellent read that will expand your horizons and enrich your life, entertain you and satisfy your inner craving for something different from the every-day world of today.the story more approachable by the reader.

B00005UQD5|4.0|This is one of the most effectively frightening horror films I have ever seen. The reason is it builds a strong sense of dread throughout the film that is made even more effective by a massive and creepy abandoned mental asylum with a disturbing history that is relayed during the film. Another freaky point is how 2 times in the movie a sudden, violent mental break is brought on by a simple every day accident which results in someone violently murdering their loved ones. It also has a well written cast of central characters played by David Caruso as the greedy one, Peter Mullan as the veteren, Stephen Gevedon as the smart one, Brenden Sexton III as the rookie, and Josh Lucas as the jerk.
B00005UQ9F|3.0|A group of men, headed by Gordon (Peter Mullen) and Phil (David Caruso)are elected to perform an asbestos removal at a local abandoned insane asylum.  These two men and a few other pals find themselves in a one week job that offers much more than they bargained for.<br />   It's all about atmosphere. There are no outright or obvious gouls or ghosts to frighten you and spook you until you spill your popcorn. The asylum, with it's peeling paint, creepy security blocks , and sweaty, gritty,  claustrophopic feel is what gives this movie a slow, rhythmic suspense and chill.<br />  As the men go about their business they each encounter various forms of quiet insanity.  Gordon becomes irritable toward others, almost paranoid. Phil seems to be meddling with everybody's notions of work ethic.  One worker becomes obsessed with a cache of old money he finds in the deep abyss of the tunnels.  Another is phobic of dark spaces.<br />  It is the discovery of one employee that takes the movie in a very different direction. He finds himself obsessed, stealing hours from work to listen to tapes of a former deceased patient with a multiple personality disorder.   Eventually it feels as if all the men in some form or another develop an unusual attachment to the asylum.<br />  The tapes and records, once discovered and pilfered through, ignite a supernatural change in tempo that doesn't cease.  Slowly, the movie becomes more frightening, more surreal, and much more suspenseful..enough to keep you bound to your armchair until the killer ending.  Within the piles of documents, tapes, and discarded patient records, secrets are buried...waiting to be found.<br />  I only gave this movie 3 stars. Performances by David Caruso and Peter Mullen were good, but not their best performances. The rest of the cast was mediocre.  I loved the idea of the plot.  The asylum seemed to take on a life of it's own, affecting the crew like a virus..very reminiscent of the horror flick &quot;Event Horizon&quot;.  The suspense was thrilling to say the least but the ending was a bizarre sequence of events that seemed a little too fabricated.  I needed to ask out loud once or twice...&quot;I don't get it, do you?&quot; <br />I would not highly recommend this movie for purchase. I think it's a fun night's rent.  I was told last night when I picked this movie off the shelf (I had never heard of it before) at my video store and asked &quot;What's this one about?&quot;, that it was a huge favorite.  Apparently &quot;Session 9&quot; is some cult favorite amongst the renters where I live.  So, if you are daring ..go ahead and enjoy this rather unknown favorite.
B000062Y98|4.0|This is an excellent album in my opinion although it is not nearly as heavy as some of Blind Guardians earlier efforts. The songs have a very grandiose, operatic theme, hence the title. If you enjoy metal with a flair for the dramatic this would be an excellent album to buy, although it is not my favorite album of theirs. I would recommend that people who are new to Blind Guardian try some of their earlier albums first like 'Tales from the twilight world' or 'Somewhere far beyond' which is probably my favorite album of theirs.(But I love them all.) My favorite songs on this album are Precious Jerusalem, Under the ice, Age of false innocence and the epic And then there was silence.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Folks--this is a beautiful movie and I agree with the poster that was disturbed by those who bashed the film on here.<br />This movie was thought provoking and touching and nice Spielberg film.<br />The DVD is great (widescreen of course) and there are tons of extras.<br />If you like movies that actually have a plot and written well, give A.I. a try.  You may not like it, but you will never forget it.
B00004Z459|5.0|This is probably the best album I've heard for a while.  All the songs are great.  With a blend of rock and hip hop it's just perfect.  I'm not really a big fan of rock, but I give props to this album and this new band Linkin Park.  All the songs in this album can be released as singles.  Hope to hear more from them in the future.
B000006ZL4|5.0|Well, at first Im a Dream Theater fan. But this is amazing.. no comparasing with DT.. this have it own style<BR>Progressive metal with very heavy guitar riffs, an excelente vocals, a completeley power bass and cool drums. So if u like good playing metal this is for u.<BR>Michael Romeo is an excelent guitar player, like a heavier and better Malmsteen... and the keyboards solos r cool too.<BR>And the band is amazing too.. Listen to songs like Pharaoh or Of Sins and Shadows if u want power.. or The Accolade or The Divine Wings of Tragedy r cool long porgressive songs...<BR>So this is an album indispensable... If u like european metal like Stratovarius u will like this too..<BR>Soo buy it now..
B00001OH7G|5.0|This album represents one of the best live blues playing that I've listened to in my 45 years.  Rory is not a typical rock star who is interested in flashy presentations.  He lets his strat do his work.  Great slide (A Million Miles Away), acoustic (As the Crow Flies)and hard ass blues-rock(Tattoo'd Lady).  If you are interested in any history of rock n roll, Rory brings it with his renditions of Walk on Hot Coals, Who's That Coming and Cradle Rock.  Buy this recording to see where real rock n roll came from.  And appreciate a Master At Work.
B00002E224|5.0|A few words on Before Sunrise- No, the two main characters never see each other again. They never forget. They cross each others minds every day and that's perfect!<BR>   The scene in the record store is worth the price of admission. They go in the listening booth to play Kath Bloom on vinyl, he wants to kiss her and she him. They don't, that was perfect.<BR>   The harpsicord dance to the Goldberg variations is perfect. At the train when he tells her he wants to see her again and she almost cries and says I didn't think you wanted to see me again. The end when they fall asleep on seperate trains to the sound of Bach, all perfect. I could go on forever..........
B00005R2M3|3.0|I'm pleased that Shakira didn't change her style for this album. She rocks in true Shakira form.  Every other Latin artist I am aware of generally abandons Latin musical stylings when singing for a crossover audience, which negates my purpose for listening. However, I wouldn't give Shakira total credit for making an English crossover album since approximately 1/3 of the album is sung in Spanish.  Why?  English-language singers generally don't include ANY Spanish songs on their albums.  (Nor, to my knowledge, do they dye their hair black.) However, my biggest complaint about this album is that Shakira's attractive voice is buried in the mix, especially on the English songs.  I can't understand very much at all of what she is singing about.  What a shame.  What is the purpose of making a crossover album if you feel the need to downplay the distinction.  Hopefully, her voice will ring loud and clear the next time around.
B000062TU2|5.0|u rated this movie a 5 because  i think that it is a thilling movie its all about a boy that is a wizard but he dont know it. U see his parents died when he was a little boy because a evil wizard lord voldimort hated them so he killed them. then he whent to go and kill the baby harry but he was so strong that when when he used his spell it back fired and it hit him.Harry didnt know all this stuff because hei aunt and uncle never wanted him to find out plus they keot hom in a little coubard under there stairs.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|You say that Belle endure abuse from the Beast but it wasn't because she loved him. She sacrificed her freedom for her father. She hated the Beast in the beginning and actually ran away. It wasn't until the Beast began to love her and to be kind to her that she began to love him back. This story tells you to look past appearences which is an amazing and very important lesson. I think that it is almost the most important thing anyone can learn. Belle is an intelligent and strong willed heroine and the Beast, once he begins to learn to love, is extremely sweet and learns that if you truely love someone you have to let them go. I think it has the best message of any Disney movie...
B00003IPFK|4.0|It's difficult to bring an excellent 500 page novel to the screen, but Lonesome Dove comes pretty darn close.  My suggestion is to read the book, digest it for a month or two and then watch this mini-series.  Duvall &amp; Tommy Lee Jones are perfect as Gus &amp; Call.  The scenes are faithful to the book.  The soundtrack is breathtaking.  The one weak spot is the casting Frederic Forrest (an otherwise very capable actor)as Blue Duck.  He does not bring the menace that was so haunting in the novel.  Otherwise it's a great flick!
B00005QIPH|4.0|I didn't experience most of the hype around The Strokes.  I didn't know who they were till about a month ago, and I'd only heard one song, Last Nite which I thought was alright.  I decided to buy the album, and while it's not the greatest thing ever, in my opinion, it's probably one of the better rock albums to come out in the last two years.  Sure there are a lot of other bands that might be better, but this is still a good album(it's GREAT when compared to all that other [junk] out there like Puddle of Mudd, Nickelback, Adema, Linkin Park, Limp Bizkit, etc.)  <br />If you're interested in buying an album that simply sounds good, then buy this cd.  It's got some good catchy toons, and is more musical than most of that other stuff(I'd say [junk]) your hearing today that's said to be rock.
B00005JKED|3.0|But if you want to see a really good film of this same genre, watch &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; , with excellent performances by Al Pacino and Johnny Depp.
B00003CXTG|4.0|Contrary to many one-sided reviews I have read, I enjoyed watching the DVD. No, this is not exactly a &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;, however it is still a great movie (Even though there are a few flaws). Because of mis-leading promotion, I think it may have lead some people to believe that this movie would be straight-forward action, similiar to &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. If you are the type of person who only like action movies without any type of drama, then you probably won't like it (There is plenty of action in it). However, if you don't mind a little drama, I think you will enjoy it as much as I did. If you aren't the latter though, still give this movie a try. You might like it. I certainly enjoyed it. It does help to see for yourself whether or not you like a movie.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|First the good-the set design is very good, and if Moulin Rouge wins an Oscar for Art Direction/Set Direction, or for Costume Design, those awards will be deserved.  There, that didn't take long...<br />I'll admit that I was turned off when I heard Christian singing the line \\"The hills are alive...\\", but I let it slide initially.  But when I then heard the throng at Moulin Rouge singing Nirvana's \\"Smells like Teen Spirit\\" in unison, I was disgusted.  Most of the reviewers have defended this move, saying it was \\"original\\" and helped resurrect the musical.  Well, don't most musicals use their own original numbers? And if not, don't the musicals at least use contemporary music? The reason I'm fiercely criticizing the musical numbers (especially the use of Nirvana), is that these numbers, when you listen to the lyrics, simply do not transport you to 1900's Paris.  Granted, Baz Luhrmann's Paris is a fictional Paris, but if you're going to use a set period piece, at least use music that evokes that time period.  <br />I do enjoy good love stories, but unfortunately I was not convinced by this one.  This is not the fault of the two actors, but Luhrmann's constant refusal to have a steady shot for longer than two seconds throughout the movie derails the love story.  This is unfortunate, because I think both actors (Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman) are very good and deserving of a better script.  I hope they're given the chance in a future film with a better love story and director.  The love story is trite-it's not a major criticism, but combined with the aforementioned criticisms it sinks the love affair. <br />This \\"musical\\" is an artsy form of an MTV production.  I have to agree with an earlier review who termed Moulin Rouge a feature-length MTV video.  I believe that the musical can make a revival, but not based on this ....  If you want to see a true musical, see \\"Singing In the Rain\\", \\"Oklahoma\\", or the underrated \\"Meet Me in St.Louis\\".
B000002U82|5.0|Pink Floyd, undoubtadly one of the greatest bands ever.  Five years ago when I was 12, I started getting heavily into music (mostly heavy metal), and I discovered classic rock.  I kind of went down the list so to speak; Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, and then I discovered Pink Floyd when I was going through my Uncle's old vinyls, and there I found it; &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot;.  I loved it the first time I listened to it, it was everything I wanted in a band.  The laid back atmosphere, the musicianship, everything was an experience.  Unfortunately though, many kids of my generation see Pink Floyd as a &quot;stoner&quot; band.  Well, Pink Floyd sure as hell was never a &quot;stoner&quot; band, I would call them psychedelic, but whatever they were, there is one thing that anyone and everyone can agree upon; Pink Floyd was an amazing band, and &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; is one of the finest albums ever recorded.
0316776963|4.0|as a fan of david sedaris from this american life, i was ready to devour this book from the moment it entered my hands. the problem was, i just couldn't chug it down. havinf heard several of the early stories read for that show, david's voice in my head kept preventing me from reading without distraction. i also noticed that many of his essays take on more life when he read them than when i was. luckily, this changed as i read on. by the time i got to the later stories from france, the ball was rolling and i was in stitches.
B000063UR2|5.0|A great classic movie that featured a then newcommer Tom Cruise. I find that everyone who sees this marvelouse fairy tale loves it from the begining. The special effects are masterfull even for the time and the story is fabulous.
0451169514|5.0|Being from Derry in Ireland myself this book was a sincerely creepy affair.  I loved the magnificent seven/seven samurai premise.  It rawks! I read the Danse Macabre anthology of horror book by Mr King right before starting IT.  IT contains a lot of the theories expounded in DM regarding our deepest fears, similar to The Body, It's young characters always land me in my past with a bump reminiscent of falling off the swing again. One word more CLASS
0553106635|5.0|I really enjoyed the first book, A Game of Thrones, and the second one, A Clash of Kings, was even better... then A Storm of Swords topped even that!  A great read! Can't wait for the fourth book to come out!
B00005221M|2.0|Before purchasing this DVD, I read an interview with Michael Mann, in which he stated that his purpose in creating this &quot;director's verson&quot; was to restore some of the &quot;epical scale&quot; that he felt was missing in the original. He wanted to deliver a &quot;bigger, richer&quot; film experience to the audience. Unfortunately, he failed in the effort. The DVD version is a sad disappointment.  Scenes have been amplified without compelling reason. For example, early on the young men are playing lacrosse while the British soldier attempts to raise a militia; several seconds of the lacrosse game have been added which appear to serve no useful purpose in the narrative. The visual quality of the film is strangely washed out - gone is the vividness of the theatrical and VHS picture. The continuity of the film seems fitful; the story no longer flows smoothly. And the final scene on the lookout point contains added speech by Chingachgook which, though I am certain was added with the laudable aim of enhancing his character, came across as poorly written and unconvincingly delivered. In other words, there was probably good reason for eliminating it in the original. And there is more bad news for the fan who wants to see those wonderful extra goodies - the behind the scenes footage, the &quot;making of the film&quot; documentary, the cast and crew interviews.  There aren't any. This, to me, is one of the great added bonuses of spending the extra money on DVD, but don't look for them in this one. My recommendation is to skip the purchase of this DVD, content yourself with the VHS, and hope that, at some future time, Mr. Mann will decide to try again to give us that bigger, richer experience he desired.

0345448898|5.0|I love to read more than anyone I know and I have read probably thousands of good books. These are the best. They have enough action to keep you on edge throughout the whole series, but they are not utterly devoid of reasoning. While most popular science fiction and fantasy is just chock full of epic battles, space travel, fireworks, and quests, these books give you somthing more to think about for a long time afterward- the nature of war, religion, humor, love and humanity.  Phillip Pullman manages to weave together the lives of his characters in skilled and often unexpected ways. Definately a 5 star series. A word of caution- you MUST read them in order to understand the complicated plot.

B00003CXXP|4.0|Jude &amp; Haley are frightenly robotic and believable and Teddy is fantastic. The special effects are amazing, but the script borders on cheese just as you think you're on a roll. If you want to watch Pinocchio, then watch this, but if you want a good sci-fi film go watch BladeRunner.
B00000JY1X|5.0|This is a brilliant collection of songs that rewards repetitive listening - I keep discovering new twists in the lyrics or funny quirks in the orchestration.  It is hard to imagine that Stephin Merrit is not already a household word.  If you like truly original artists (like Zappa, Eno, Laurie Anderson and others) you will love this great collection.  Just buy it.

1570427496|4.0|I bought this book mainly because I wanted to read it first before I went to watch the movie (and also because I am a sap,heh). The plot was nothing great, you could kinda predict what was going to happen next. However, Nicholas Sparks has a real cool way with words - very sweet and at times, very humorous. It made me laugh aloud a few times. He painted this really quaint and beautiful small town in my head and its characters, etc. Though you could predict the ending, it will still make you cry because it's a simple and old-fashioned story of first love, its ups, its downs, its pain .. go read it.

0767802470|5.0|One of the greatest war movies ever made. One of the highest grossing films in German history. The novel is also a great read. The quality of this DVD makes an amazming movie into a better one. If you are intrested in submarines, WWII or suspense you WILL like this.
B0000024VP|5.0|'Sunshine Superman' came out around the beginning of one of the most experimental periods in rock history, a period that also spawned (right around the same time) the Beatles' 'Revolver', Dylan's 'Blonde On Blonde', Simon &amp; Garfunkle's 'Parsley, Sage, Rosemary &amp; Thyme', the Byrds' '5D', and the Stones' 'Aftermath'.<br />Jagger and Richards' &quot;Lady Jane&quot; could have fit very nicely on Donovan's album if a few words were changed here or there.<br />Donovan's contribution was right up there with the best of them. He utilized the combination of sitar and tablas more extensively than the rest of these groups/artists, and also included on several of his numbers a generous helping of medieval-renaissance sound, as well as seamless fusions of these with each other and with more customary blues, folk, and soft rock. It's pretty much all very sophisticated, tuneful, and deeply inspiring.<br />I won't dwell on &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot; the single, or on &quot;Season of the Witch&quot;, as both have received more than their fair share of airplay over the years. Here are evaluations of the best of the others.<br />&quot;Legend of the Girl Child Linda&quot;: I had a friend who during our high school years used to listen to this song every night before he went to sleep. It's a fairy tale, or a collection of them, made into a medieval/renaissance sounding song, with acoustic guitar, string quartet, harpsichord, clarinet (also oboe?) and bells providing the accompaniment.<br />&quot;Three King Fishers&quot;: cosmic romanticism, with distinctly eastern flavors, and smacking of tales of the Arabian Nights as well, using acoustic guitar, sitar and tablas in a minor mode to achieve its air of mystery. &quot;Oh, I dreamed you were a jewel, sitting in golden crown on my head.&quot; The title may be a play of words on the Fisher King [from the Grail legends].<br />&quot;Ferris Wheel&quot; is somewhat similar, but in a major mode (uplifting, not as dark); using sitar, tablas and electric bass. This one tends to fly me to North Africa.<br />'Bert's Blues', starts out as rather traditional, jazzy-sounding blues (acoustic guitar and acoustic bass with little harpsichord licks) with lyrics to match. But half way through, things flip into a long 'b' section that at first seems like it's only a bridge. This is highly unusual as it's still using kind of a blues scale, and blues rhythm, but harmonically goes into a space-time zone that's very much like the &quot;Girl Child Linda&quot;, only much darker (this, after all, being the 'blues'). Check out some of the lyrics:<br />  &quot;Fairy castles, stark and black in the moonlight-<br />  The jingle jangle jester rides his stallion.<br />  Seagull rides across my eyes forever-<br />  Sadly goes on his way to Hades.&quot;<br />and:<br />  &quot;Lucifer calls his legions from the hillside . . .&quot;<br />The instrumental accompaniment during this during this long section is all string quartet. The breaks are solo harpsichord, then string quartet with clarinet playing the lead. The song ends up back on the 'a' section [the blues] again.<br />&quot;Guinevere&quot;: more medieval-renaissance soft rock; but with tasteful fusion provided by sitar and tablas; lyrics are Donovan's imaginative take on the Arthurian legends.<br />&quot;The Fat Angel&quot;: more raga rock from its true master (here, using tablas, sitar, acoustic guitar, electric bass). The line &quot;fly Jefferson Airplane, gets you there on time&quot;, provided a name for one of the many budding San Francisco bands. I wonder if Trans-Love Energies, which later evolved into the White Panther Party, also took their name from the line &quot;fly Trans-Love Airways, gets you there on time&quot;? I guess I'll have to ask John Sinclair sometime.<br />&quot;Celeste&quot;: A very stirring song, which in some kind of circuitous, subconscious way reminds me of Joni Mitchell's &quot;Cactus Tree&quot;. Strings, organ, drums (played very softly) bass, sitar, harpsichord. This has always been one of my sixties emotional anthems.sichord. This has always been one of my sixties emotional anthems.
B00005UQD5|4.0|I had never heard of Session 9 but came upon it at a video rental. Wasn't expecting much.  However, this film from beginning to end, was truly unnerving.  Each scene was composed in such a way to be both beautiful and creepy as hell.  Other reviews here have covered the story quite well so let me just say that sleep that same night did not come easily. The chill factor was such that it left me hyper sensitive to every little creek and straining to see what was behind every shadow. Not to mention the mind working overtime to &quot;figure it all out.&quot;<BR>Should be a creep classic.
0789723107|4.0|Steve Krug does a great job of pointing out the necessity and effectiveness of site design that incorporates good usability features. We all know that usability is important, but we often forget is that what seems obvious to us may not be obvious to our visitors. Between the book's concise explanations and very effective graphic visuals, I was really able to walk away with a better feel for \\"user friendly\\" design. <br />The fact that this book is short, simple, and easy to read makes it a handy addition to any developers library!
B000060MMI|5.0|I have been a fan from the first note of \\"Salty Dog\\" on Swagger and rushed out day one to buy \\"Drunken Lullabies\\". It did not dissapoint. If you are into loud, rowdy Irish pubsongs (and let's be honest, who isn't) that grab you the first time you hear them then you cannot go wrong here. I have been looking for a new Pogues and these guys will do the trick. They are a little harder, takning more from their punk influence than Shane and Crew (think of them as the midway point between the Pogues and Dropkick Murphys) but the spirit is the same. There really is fantastic range of variety on this record. It is remarkable that a band is able to pull off rousing bar-room tracks like \\"Drunken Lullabies\\" and \\"What's Left of the Flag\\" in one breath and more subdued, but equally moving tracks like \\"If I Ever Leave this World Alive\\" and \\"The Son Never Shines (on Closed Doors)\\"  while still being able to pull off a captivating (near) instrumental cut like \\"Swagger\\". Anyone who is tired of the overproduced and completely uninspired dreg that has become par for the course and is looking for some solid songwriting from some people who make listening enjoyable do yourself a favor. Also don't miss out on Swagger either, both are well worth the price of admission. Slante'.
0440180295|5.0|The description of Slaughtehouse Five as either an anti-war or science-fiction novel isn't necessarily a negative, or even incorrect label, but, let's say instead, a restrictive one. It would be similar to calling \\"Beowolf\\" a poem or \\"Dr. Strangelove\\" a black comedy. It is a truthful assesment, it just doesn't do the work justice.<br />Slaughterhouse is a brilliant satire/black comedy of not just war and science-fiction, but humanity, love, death, friendship, and any other ideals that we as a race hold dear. It is this that causes the biggest problem with Vonnegut's appreciation by mass audiences, \\"How can he make fun of that?\\" Simple, he just brings in a space-craft.<br />My favorite character of not only Slaughterhouse, but all of Vonnegut's collective work is by far and away Kilgore Trout. The essential paperback writer, and perhaps an insight to what might have been with Vonnegut (consider what would have happened to him had his work been released at a less tolerable time-period during the history of American Literature and you will see what I mean) Trout is a pat on the back for any independent artist, regardless of the genre, that the effect your work has on a small group is not lessened by the size of your audience, but, instead, confirmed by the reaction of the few. He is also hilarious and brilliant.<br />Other then Trout, however, the story revolves around the life of Billy Pilgram. Not the life as you or I, or a lesser writer even would see it, but as according to the view of Tralfamadorians, an alien race who has a greater understanding of the view-point of time then humans ever will. So it is through their eyes that we witness the fascinating life of Pilgrim. From his days in captivity by the German army during World War II leading up to the fire-bombing of Dresden, to his abduction by aliens and use as a museum piece as he \\"mates\\" with porn-star Montana Wildhack, through marriage, plane crashes, insanity, and death we not only watch his fascinating life, but find ourselves laughing at our own ridiculous society. If you enjoy satire, black comedy, and poking fun of all that you hold dear, then Slaughterhouse is defenitely for you. If not... then read it anyway.
B00002E23E|1.0|Do yourself a favor and DON'T buy this movie.  I love zeppelin to death, but the stupid footage and the lame live versions of the songs just makes it all bad.  I'm going to try to resell mine on ebay.
B00004S6GL|5.0|Elliott Smith's \\"Figure 8\\" is one of the only rock albums I own that I simply will never get rid of. After being highly addicted to it for like a YEAR, I had to put it away for a while and only recently did I really sit down and listen to it again all the way through, and I can't say I've lost any appreciation for this phenomenal work. I could write twenty pages about this album, but there's no point. I cannot praise this album enough, and if you have even a passing interest in vintage rock, acoustic, and possibly a little bit of psychedelia, this album is absolutely priceless.<BR> Oh yeah, and one other thing, Elliott Smith doesn't really listen to, or even like, Simon & Garfunkel, but some people think he borrows from them because they really don't know what real folk music is!

B00005R1N3|5.0|These ordinary mundane words will chill your blood after one viewing of \\"Black Christmas\\", certainly among the finest horror films ever made.<br />Starring Olivia Hussey, Margot Kidder and Andrea Martin,<BR>the film begins as an urban legend come to life: the old standby of the psycho stalking the college sorority house. The thing about urban legends though is that they usually stem from a grain of truth.  While this film was released way back in 1974, I believe it's still as timely as ever in our violent and  repressive society.<br />Inspiring a host of imitators, including horror standards such as Halloween & When a Stranger Calls, as well as lesser knowns like Don't Answer the Phone & Don't Look in the Basement, Black Christmas was one of the first to bring the terror home.  The villain stalks his prey in the one place where they feel safest - their own home.  Many viewers of my generation still shudder upon hearing that famous quote, \\"He's calling from inside of the house - get out of the house!\\" (When a Stranger Calls) But BC had already been there and done that in a big way.<br />While the film works famously on all levels for any horror audience, I think it resonates most deeply with young women who will soon be facing adulthood, and moving away from home and familiarity. This is the *ideal*  horror movie for a slumber or Halloween party. <br />The best recommendation I can give the film is this: It's been almost 20 years since I've set eyes on it and I'm giddy with the anticipation of seeing it again.  I could go on and on but I need to log off and clear the line - I'm expecting a phone call...

B00005LB50|3.0|Having always been very curious about Buffalo Springfield, mainly from the few teaser songs included on Neil Young's Decade, and from of course hearing (\\"For What It's Worth\\"), I had pinpointed them a band that I needed to investigate more for about 5 years.  I also was aware of the backlog of unreleased material that they had recorded as an act, and was primed for a box set release (or at least a lengthy double album) release of their material for years).<br />Then just before Christmas, this Box Set hits the market. So I figured I would give it a try, I mean I knew I would like the majority of the music--being a considerable fan of both Steven Stills and Neil Young's post Buffalo work.<br />I put each of the cd's in, and was amazed at first. This band was perhaps one of the strongest and most experimental (in the folk/country/rock genre) that has ever been assembled.  I mean the music on all 4 of the cd's is spell-binding. It may take a few listens to get into, but once you do you are hooked.<br />The first cd, features a bulk of well executed and superb demos. Mostly consisting of unreleased songs or early versions of songs that will turn up drastically different in their later versions. It's hard to surpass any of the material on the first disc. All of the demos are superb, my favorites being \\"Come On\\", \\"We'll See\\" and surprisingly to myself at least, a plaintive \\"Baby Don't Scold Me\\". After the first 10 songs of demos are finished, we reach the actual versions of what would become their debut, Buffalo Springfield. And this disc, as well as the set itself will prove, that from the get-go this band was amazing.  The first disc is chock-full of classics, including \\"For What It's Worth\\", \\"Sit Down I Think I Love You\\", \\"Nowadays Clancy Can't Even Sing\\" and my personal favorite Buff Springfield song, and Neil Young song in general \\"Flying on the Ground is Wrong\\".<br />Disc Two continues on the pace with disc one. The album opens mostly with demos again, although herewe can hear how strong musically this band was in a few superb instrumentals: \\"Kahuna Sunset\\" and \\"Buffalo Stomp\\".  Neil's superb demo, \\"Down Down Down\\" actually outshines the two songs it would later become (it seems to be a mix of \\"Down to the Wire\\" and \\"Broken Arrow\\"), and what a song it is, almost warrants the set in this one song alone.  Disc 2 carries on with mostly alternate versions of songs found on disc one, and is perhaps the most enjoyable of the 4 discs.<br />Disc 3 is also a real stunner. Stills' \\"Hung Upside Down\\" is a brilliant mix of soul, folk and country. Furray's soulified \\"Good Time Boy\\" will convert even the strongest critic to this band's merit. Neil's demos are the highlights here, \\"The Rent is Always Due\\" and the \\"Old Laughing Lady\\" are brilliant.  We also have the majority of the songs from Their 3rd and final release, released when the band was all but split up. \\"Undo-Mundo\\", \\"Questions\\" and \\"I AM A CHILD\\" being the biggest standouts.<br />So now that you've read about three stellar, easy five star reviews, you might be wondering what the problem with the set is to warrant the 3 star rating (or you read some shorter reviews listed here already and are waiting for me to get to my point).  Ultimately while the music on here clearly rivals that of the Byrds' brilliant boxed set (simply a must-have). THe fourth disc is a complete ripoff. Here we have a disc of material that is entirely (besides I believe Mr. Soul) a complete rehash of the songs from discs one, two and three). They are presenting the band's first two albums together on one cd.  Now I would forgive this if the price of this set had been closer to a three cd set, but at $55 dollars and up for this set, I felt completely ripped-off. Especially considering that this set doesn't include all of the band's released material.<br />To add to my anger towards this ripoff set of some of the most brilliant music ever released is that the fine and thorough booklet that accompanies the setcontinually discusses how strong a live act Buff Springfield were.  I can understand that they might not have an entire show or performance, but as earlier releases not available on cd atest, there were some released live performances.  This wouldn't be a big issue with me had the book not mentioned almost every other paragraph about how strong this band was live.<br />Ultimately, this set was really promising. THe first 3 cd's were brilliantly compiled. The rip-off and hence the low rating is given because of disc 4. Approach with caution. Ordinarily I would rate a set with this blatant a rip off a 1 star review, but being that the music on this set is still endlessly enjoyable, I feel it can't be lower than a 3 star rating.  It's a shame too, because this set has me hooked on them, and I am a new convert.  If you like folk, country, folk rock, Americana, or just good ol rock and roll, buy a Buffalo Sprinfield album with confidence, just be forewarned about this set before you do.
0618002227|4.0|The Fellowship of the Ring is an exhilarating and well written book by J.R.R. Tolkien. That is probably why they made it into a movie too. I chose this book because I have been hearing that it is simply great. My brother also has read it and gave me the whole series to read myself. I have read the book titled The Hobbit which leads up to this trilogy, and it was just exciting to read. That was one of the reasons I have chosen to continue and read this author's books.Another is that there are new pictures from the movie which were put on to the covers. I felt I should at least give this novel a try after what I have been seeing and hearing about it.<BR>      I believe that Frodo is the main character over the whole book. Not just because he is on the front cover, but because he is the key to destruction or peace. Even though there are other main characters that accompany Trodo or stir up trouble, it surrounds Frodo since he holds the one thing that could bring evil upon everything.Frodo is the adopted son of Bilbo, the main character in The Hobit. He has inherited Bilbo's wealth for he had an adventure which gave him treasure in the end. Anyway, Frodo has many good attributes like being friendly and being moral. Through that he has made many friends as well as enemies.<BR>      It starts when Frodo was given the ring from bilbo.The ring that Sauron once made to control and destroy all. Now Frodo, and his hobbit companions go to Rivendell to escape the Ringwraiths that were after the ring. If Sauron got hold of the ring, he would destroy all that was good. That is why nine travelers were chosen to accompany the hobbits and destroy it in Mordor at Mount Doom. Later, the fellowship gets broken by armies of orcs, but Frodo and his loyal companion move on.
B00003CXXP|4.0|The best way to describe AI is probably as three movies packed into about two and a half hours.  The first part focuses on David's relationship with his new family.  The second part is about his journey to find the blue fairy.  The third part is about what happens in the future.  I know that's a little vague, but I can't give any more away than that.<br />That's a very different way of doing things, to say the least, but it sort of works.  The storyline about David's attempts to get his mother to love him is really quite fascinating, but it only manages to loosely tie the three story arcs together.  However, even loosely tied together, the story stays constant and doesn't stray from the same general plotline.<br />By themselves, though, the last two parts in particular are very well done.  The journey from the woods to the home of the blue fairy is really brilliant.  Everything from the Flesh Fair to Rouge City, while new and strange, never seems too out of place.  There are nice little touches thrown in that add to the story as well.  I particularly enjoyed the last half-hour or so because it is both brilliantly thought out and amazingly emotional.<br />In terms of acting, AI is very good.  Haley Joel Osment isn't quite as good here as he was in Sixth Sense, but he still is perfectly believable as a robot with feelings.  Jude Law is excellent as Joe, a pleasurebot on the run who helps David and William Hurt, who is one of my favorite actors, is outstanding in a small role as the doctor who creates David.<br />Visually, I'm not sure &quot;stunning&quot; even begins to describe AI.  I have seen many big-budget movies in my time and this is the most incredibly detailed and spectacular film I have ever seen.  Painstaking detail went into this whole movie, from the backgrounds to the robots to the sets.  The whole thing is simply to incredible to be put into words.<br />My only real problems with this movie are really found in the first part.  The whole concept of a robot child moving in with a family who has a sick son is just a little strange.  It could have been done better I think if more time had been spent in the movie explaining the relationships between David, his parents, and the son.  Also, I think Teddy, the walking, talking bear could have been used more.<br />It's only fair to warn people about a couple of things with AI as well.  There are hardly any humorous moments in the movie.  It is a dark, sometimes depressing look at the future.  Also, this movie might be too intense for children.<br />Overall, I think AI is one of those films that could have gone down in history as one of the greatest, but a few little flaws keep it from getting there.
B00005QZ7U|1.0|From beginning to end this movie went from bad to worse.  The directing, acting and music were some of the worse I have ever seen.
0375804153|5.0|I remember reading this book as a child, and I loved every page!  It's creative and well put together.  Every page is a new surprise!  Everyone in the family can enjoy this book.  Now that I have children, I can now pass the tradition of loving this book on for many more generations to come.  This is a book that provides many smiles and laughs to children of all ages. You'll love it, and your children will love it, and their children will love it and so on and so on.....
0307120007|1.0|Drab book. My baby girl (now 10 months old) has had this book for four months now.  While she loves books she finds this one uninteresting.  I think it its too filmsy and entirely too drab.  This experience has made me cautious about the amount of credit I should give to these reviews.  It seems a bit like the emperor's new clothes... can't anyone else see that he is naked?
B00005JKDQ|5.0|Yes, the special effects are great.  Pixar takes basically the same technology as \\"Toy Story II\\", probably added some improvements, and brings us another visual delight.  This one should be a big success on video, as kids are going to love it in their libraries.<br />But of course, it wouldn't mean beans if there were not a good story.  This one creates a brand new world for us.  I wasn't aware of this but it seems that the monsters that hide in our closets have a back exit that leads into their own world.  In this world, scaring kids is just another day at work, and they punch a clock in the same manner that we do.  They are not bad monsters for scaring us, it's just what they do.  <br />So everything is going fine until an actual kid get's into the monsters' world and gums everything up.  Turns out the monsters, at least our leading monsters, are really good guys who just scare kids as a job.  When they encounter the child, who THEIR world considers the monsters, a lot of prejudice has to be overcome.  But once they accept they child, protective instincts take over, and they try to put everything back in it's place.  This, of course, entails all kinds of difficulties, which entertain us enough to make this one a keeper.
B00003CXI1|3.0|This movie was great!  The only problem was it wasn't as good as the books.  I think the books are better than the movie.  I think the books were fantastic, marvelous, ect... One thing I noticed was they didn't include snapes task in the movie.  I thought that was wierd.  <br />I loved this movie!  Pre-order it today!
B00003CXXI|5.0|The bar doesn't go up that much, as I think what Pixar does is equally as good.  This one's animantion is just as good, but just, different.  One problem I've had with all kinds of computer animation is that everything comes out so clean.  This animation takes the time to dirty up it's characters a little bit, providing more realism, which I like.<br />The movie's also terrific in that it does work at both the adult and child levels.  The kids will like seeing some of their favorite fantasy characters in another context.  While they may have less than pleasant personalities in this movie, I don't think that's going to emotionally scar our nation's youth, and the adults can enjoy the many zingers that get thrown in.  <br />But the familiar characters take a back seat to the brand new creations of this story.  Eddie Murphy as the donkey is great, if standard sidekick material.  But the animation of the Shrek character is more enjoyable with each viewing.  We've had slobs as heroes before, but never has such delightfully rude behavior been so incorporated into a lifestyle.  How Shrek brushes his teeth, catches fish for dinner, and provides a candle to light his dinner table are done so well they may become the new way of polite society.  <br />Well, maybe just in the movies.  But I think the Shrek character has a lot of potential for a string of movies.  I anxiously await the next one.
B000062YB1|4.0|seasons in the abyss is a good album, but it definately doesn't live up to the hype.  it lacks both the intensity of reign in blood and the heaviness of south of heaven and sounds flat at times.  the first 5 tracks are killer but after &quot;dead skin mask&quot; there's some serious filler on here.  on &quot;skeletons of society&quot; and &quot;temptation&quot; it sounds like the band isn't even trying, but then &quot;born of fire&quot; kicks in just in time to get you ready for the eternal classic &quot;seasons in the abyss&quot; which is without a doubt one of the best slayer songs of all-time, i love that awesome intro.  compared to albums like Reign In Blood and God Hates Us all Seasons is pretty weak, but even a weak album by slayer shreds anything by most bands out there and that's why it gets 4 stars.
B000002OX7|5.0|This 1971 effort by The Who is a classic for good reason--it continues to provide pleasure over thirty years after it was originally released, and the songs actually get better the more you listen to them. Oh, for the days when rock and roll was actually rich, complex music instead of teenybopper nothingness . . . but that's a diatribe for another day.<br />The five-plus minutes of \\"Baba O'Riley\\" (known incorrectly by an awful lot of people as \\"Teenage Wasteland\\") are instantly recognizable and a full taste of things to come on the rest of the album. The synthesizer reminds me somehow of one of those dogs you see in the back of a car--stationery body with slightly quivering, bobbing head. There's a strong sense of tension to it--and the payoff, a minute or so into the song, is worth it. <br />The John Entwistle tune \\"My Wife\\" is a charming and affectionate paeon to rock's poor wives, complete with Beatles-inspired trumpets blaring in the background. \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" and \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" are obvious, and obviously terrific, rock and roll classics that bolster the overall strength of this superb album. \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" plays around with synthesizer again along the same lines as \\"Baba O'Riley\\" and does it to mesmerizing effect. <br />No rock and roll CD library is complete with this amazing album.
B00003CY0V|5.0|This movie is totally AWESOME!!!!!! Its chucked full of action!<BR>The plot is [good]!!...
B000000WF0|3.0|Sure there is quite an amount of good material on this album and the flow of this album is good, however there are some tracks which are just too long and unmelodic yet they dont add to the 'feel' of the album. Compare this with OK computer's Fitter Happier. A totally unmelodic song but adds so much themetically and emotionally to the album. Or Automatic For the People's New Orleans Instrumental No.1 which carries on the album mood from one track to the next. By the time i'm at the 6th track, i find myself skipping tracks to Lucky Man. The worse part of it all, is that there are so many beautiful tracks which are just so darn good.(Sonnet and the Drugs Dont Work is one of my top ten favourite songs) which just makes u wish that this album could be more concised and better (thats why i always tend to buy albums without the extra tracks , they always seem to kill the mood). I think thats why i'm so critical of it, because the contrast between the good songs and the mediocre ones are just too great. And what's with the extended jams. The songs should have ended where ashcroft's stop singing his last melodic note....but nOoOOo....he continues with his meandering voice back by an equally lack of art noise. The quality of material too doesnt justify the length of the disc. However, i still strongly recommend anyone to buy this album for the best tracks are probably some of the best songs you could ever hear ( and they are littered throughout this album ...
B000002ADT|5.0|...<br />The merits of \\"Kind of Blue\\" have been hashed and rehashed, so I have but one thing to add: if you are a jazz novice, you are likely to play this CD and wonder what the fuss is about.  The modal structure is familiar to anyone with a background in Western culture, and the musicianship, although first-rate, isn't geared to impress, but to envelope.  (Davis, Coltrane, Adderley, Evans, Chambers, and Cobb -- what, they couldn't find Louis Armstrong?)  Consider, though, that you're hearing these incredible sounds from the perspective of over 40 years of history passed.  In 1959, \\"Kind of Blue\\" was a muted thunderbolt striking deep into the heart of what had become a stagnant art form.  The fact that \\"Kind of Blue\\" sounds like what most of us would now call \\"traditional acoustic jazz\\" is a testament to its importance.  And that it continues to captivate so many is a testament to its timelessness.  In other words, \\"Kind of Blue\\" is the rare masterpiece that represents a stark historical transition within a musical form, yet remains accessible and inspiring to new generations, including those who don't ordinarily listen to jazz.  This CD won't beat you over the head, but it is likely to worm its way into your subconsciousness in the most appealing way.
B000000WA4|3.0|It has been a good 8 years(roughly) since i bought this album. I remember how enthusiastic i was to get it, right after hearing Bullet With Butterfly Wings on the radio. And after listening to it, i was enthralled and thought it classic. I then took on the task of forcing this album down everyone's throats. <br />Listening to this album many many moons later, I must say, it has not aged as well as i thought it would have. Some of the tracks just sound too similar (Lily &amp; Beautiful) and overblown ( Tales of a Scorched Earth &amp; X.Y.U). There are, however, several great tracks here, Classics really, like tonight tonight, 1979, bullet with butterfly wings, galapogos. The trouble is that all the other tracks basks in ranks of 'pretty goodness'. I would have no contention listening to 40 minutes of 'pretty good' songs (i would actually label the album quite classic if it was so) , however, this happened to be a double disc album! The ratio of great songs to 'pretty good' songs is just not enough to justify a double album.<br />But then again, if the Pumpkins/Corgan intended to have an album of such great diversity it would be impossible for them/him to show it in just one disc. I understand the need for a double album ,however, the 'pretty goodness' of the majority of songs dilutes the whole album. <br />Hmmmm, so there you have it, there aer some really excellent songs in it and all the other material in it are, to say it again, 'pretty good'.
0525946284|4.0|Have you noticed the recent spate of fiction that presents us with women heroines that would make Rambo feel totally inadequate?  Ken Follett evidently became aware of this and decided he'd take this idea one step further. Enter a whole group of feminine freedom fighters.<br />It's WWII and D-day is close at hand. The allies have decided that a key telecommunications center, located in a small town in France, needs to be taken out. After a failed attempt on the center that involved numerous French resistance fighters, British senior agent Felicity (Flick) Clairet returns to England and recruits five women (actually 4.5 women, but I can't explain that here) to return with her to destroy the heavily guarded installation. Give them a few days training and they are off. Also in the story is the intelligent, somewhat evil German colonel who is hot on their trail. The chase is on. One setback after another plagues the wily women, but they elude their pursuers until... Well read the book and see what happens.<br />If you like WWII secret agent stories then this is just for you. Action, suspense, sleeping around, infidelity, gay love, cross dressing, torture, Neanderthal SS men, all the usual ingredients of the genre are here.
B000002B7W|5.0|Some albums capture important moments in rock history and others are just there.  This is an absolute classic and proves that metal was not just a phase, but an important musical presence.  And of course, it was the instrumental genius of Rhandy and energy of Ozzy that really drives this recording.  Ozzy has had many highs, both on and off the stage, but he peaked here.  yeah, Jake E. Lee and Zak Wylde are good, but Rhandy was unbelievable.  Night after night he delivered the goods.  I'm bummed as I was supposed to see the Band on the Diary of a Madman tour in Maine, but Rhandy's death put a kabosh to that.<BR>My only wish is that Ozzy will release more recordings from this tour as their are some real gems, such as the shows in Indy and Montreal.
B000002NJS|3.0|When Madonna released this album back in march of 98 it became<BR>smash. I Dont know why. This album had the hits Frozen and Ray Of Light to back it up and yes this album sold 12,000,000 copies<BR>worldwide.But sold 12,000,000. Does it mean its good or does it<BR>means the album is good if it wins over 4 grammys. Hell no<BR>Most people who probably reviews this album thought. This album<BR>i so original and had beautiful lyrics on it lets buy it. <BR>Because they havent heard anything a like it. Well let me just<BR>say one thing. Madonna is a mainstream act. She is just not doing<BR>this to geed good critic. She is doing it for the money and the fame and of course now a little respect. For the album itself<BR>this album contains about 7 songs that I actually liked. The<BR>rest is just a filler. Madonna hardly does anything on this album<BR>either. She is just the product. Many people may disagree with me<BR>on this. Dont get me wrong I am a Madonna fan. But this album<BR>is so overrated. The lyrics they are meant to be personal and<BR>meaningful which I truly respect but she writes like a 5 year old sometimes. The sound of this album is good but might be<BR>a little overproduced (not as I have anything against it. It does <BR>not match with these kinds of songs). Everything mixes up which ends up like a little disaster. If you want to buy a real <BR>electronic dance album buy Bjrks POST or DEBUT or something with Tricky and something with Madonna buy EROTICA or BEDTIME STORIES .
B000000OSE|4.0|Too many metal albums from the '80s and '90s are really starting to sound dated.  The good new is that there are alot of bands that wish they sounded as good now as G'n'R did when this was released.  Izzy and Axl were a formidable song writing combo.  And prior to Izzy leaving, things were really looking up.  Matt certainly fit well into the band after the departure of the old drummer.  Strange that he was booted out for substance abuse....but I digress.<br />This album has as many good tunes as UYI2.  The fact that there are two albums is testament to the fact that G'N'R were big, but not big enough to ram a double album down the throat of Geffen without paying a huge fee.  In the end, they were right and the label was wrong, as usual.  <br />The tour was great.  I saw them in Mt View, Ca.

This album has it<BR>all. Though this is basically a rock album it is my favourite Radiohead album. Every song is good and there is no filler. It is like listening to a greatest hits album cause all the songs here<BR>could be a radio hit. Hey there were 5 or 6 hit singels on this album (not in the USA by the way). But around the world this album got a massive airplay. I only wished it had sold more here in the USA and globaly although being a hit.

0790731452|4.0|MARS ATTACKS! has gotten a lot of bad press becuase people miss the intention that Burton had. The disc is given a decent transfer with interactive menus, trailers, alternate language, and my personal favorite: a spearate music only track where you here nothing but Danny Elfman's amazing score and the various songs while watching the movie. A good movie and a good DVD. Leave MARS ATTACKS! alone. It's a cute flick.
0790734850|4.0|That's not a knock. Well, not much of one, anyway. Curtis Hanson was handed a near-impossible task: translate the best crime novel in a generation - one that requires a six or seven-hour running time to render faithfully - into a two-hour film. Give him credit for doing a good job of it, but let's not get so dewy-eyed that we ignore what was lost here: not just vital subplots but depth, layering, richness of detail. Gone are not only the Inez Soto/Dieterling-cum-Disney angle (and the piercing social commentary threaded into this sub-narrative) but the entire background/motivating force to the Ed Exley character, now reduced to a by-the-book, son-of-a-dead-patrolman tightass. Further, the concluding half-hour piles the climaxes together, one after another, straining and finally shredding credulity. The decision-making involved (likely forced down Hansen, Ellroy and screenwriter Helgeland's throats by the moneymen holding the pursestrings to the entire project) has also robbed us of any chance of seeing the entire LA Quartet brought to the screen, at least in any recognizable form, now that the Dudley Smith cat's out of the bag & dispensed with.<br />So, then...what's on the PLUS side of the ledger here? Pacing and performances. While the characters of Bud White, Ed Exley & Jack Vincennes have been pre-softened for your viewing convenience, Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce & Kevin Spacey pour everything they have into their roles, and...for the duration of the film...you believe in these characters. Crowe may be the current flavor-of-the-month, but DAMN he's good, smoldering like the burning tip of a Chesterfield. Spacey works vocal inflections and raised eyebrows like a virtuoso musician (he patterned his interpretation after Hanson's suggestion of Dean Martin as the ideal Vincennes, were this film actually made in '53) and Pearce, in the most thankless of the three roles, overcomes both the scenario's short-shrifting of the character's motivations and his own too-youthfulappearance, managing to turn both to his advantage. The female lead, Ms Basinger, while overpraised, does fine, heartfelt work; and Danny DeVito is dependably Danny DeVito. All the secondary roles are both beautifully-cast and expertly-played as well, which helps the production immeasurably. James Cromwell is physically wrong for Dudley Smith, yet makes the role his own, emanating a bottomless pool of menace; Tomas Arana makes a wonderfully slimy Bruening, and David Straithairn and John Mahan both seem plucked from the 40s - they are uncanny physical matches to both their characters and the era being evoked. And Curtis Hansen keeps the action hurtling forward, a series of snowballs rolling downhill, picking up speed & force as they coalesce into one single storyline. Anyone not familiar with the novel is going to have damned little to complain about, and even Ellroy fans will grudgingly admit that the film being as good as it is constitutes a minor miracle. Still, those viewers who know only the film should make tracks to Ellroy's novel. Their pleasure will only be intensified by that small sting of regret at What Might Have Been.
078322804X|1.0|I was desperately hoping to buy this DVD, thinking that the producers would do the obvious...include a 'family friendly' language option. My two young boys would love to see this movie again, but I can't let them due to verbal content. Every DVD I own has multiple languages, and this movie had to be `cleaned up' for broadcast. So why not here? Yes, it's an excellent movie. Too bad somebody wasn't thinking when it came to the 'options' department...
B000021YQV|5.0|This is the best album of 2001. Hands down.<br />As a metalhead I was impressed by Iced Earth's latest effort but this is just mindbending.<br />Buy this disc.  Get a pogo stick.  Prepare to smile.
B000053VAF|5.0|Honestly the first time I saw this movie I was confused.  See, I am not a religious person so I kept having to ask questions.  I didn't get many of the 'jokes'.  The second time I saw it I remembered all that I had asked before, and it was actually quite funny.  A bit more profanity than I like, but still good.  And I am surprised to see people unhappy with Alanis Morrisette in this movie.  I thought she was fantastic as God.  If there was a God, that would be exactly what God SHOULD be like.  Best scene in the entire film: God doing a handstand under a tree and wearing plaid boxer shorts.  That is exactly what I would want in a God.
B000002TPS|2.0|I love 'Deth.  Heck, I wanted to be Dave Mustaine when I was growing up, but even my adoration can't save this album. Here's how it goes....<br />First four tracks are solid. <br />The remaining tracks are uninspired and boring. Is that Nick Menza or a drum machine stuck on the same beat?  The acid-tongue of Mustaine is gone here.  The power and fury that dwindled on Countdown to Extinction has been snuffed out.<br />The only reason I still own this disc is because of the first four tracks.  It would make a great EP.
B00003CWOL|1.0|WORST MOVIE I EVER SAW.  THERE IS SO MUCH SWEARING, YOU NEED A LOT OF SOAP JUST TO CLEAN IT UP.  THERE IS NO FUN IN THIS MOVIE AND NO HAPPINESS.  JUST BLOODY SENSELESS KILLING.  THE MOVIE MOCKS THE CATHOLIC RELIGION WITCH IS VERY DISTASTEFUL.  DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU HAVE GOOD VALUES.
B000002V0Q|4.0|This is a great album.  But when I read most of the reviews on here I'm blown away by some of the love dished out.<br />Best ever?  Thrash?  Heaviest Megadeth album ever?<br />My good friends, let's not get carried away. Gushing love is a good thing but let's not overlook something obvious about this album:  COMMERCIAL.<br />Yes folks. The big 'C' word.  Ever notice how all these songs (except Ashes) are neat and trimmed for radio length?  Ever notice how furious time changes and 18 different guitar riffs have been slimmed down to a mild handful? Ever notice how bad Psychotron is?<br />Don't profane the past. Listen to Rust In Peace, listen to So Far, and listen to Peace Sells, and then listen to this.  You'll notice a huge difference.  Don't get me wrong, I love this disc.  Best tracks include: This Was My Life, Countdown, Ashes, AofA.  <br />But please don't call this thrash.  Please don't call this Megadeth's best ever.  And please don't say it's the heaviest 'Deth because that is simply untrue.
B00005UEAR|3.0|DT underwhelms with their most ambitious CD yet.  Slowly drifting away from Dream and more towards Theater, the whole 2nd disc sounds like a heavy broadway play.  The 1st disc starts out well, but goes downhill with each track.  The lyrics have always been their weakest link, however they are almost embarassingly bad on this effort.  There is some good jamming and Mike Portnoy is always fun to listen to...but make sure you crank it up to drown out James Labrie as much as possible.<br />On another note...i'd pay a fortune to hear these guys cover FZ!!
B00004TH7Z|4.0|This disc is such a welcome relief to see Bruce and H back in the fold. But for those of us that expected the Midas touch on the first reunion will be disappointed by this disc....somewhat.<br />Make no mistake, there are some great tracks on here.  And it is the best studio album for IM since No Prayer For the Dying.<br />The Best: Blood Brothers, Wicker Man, Ghost.., BNW, Fallen Angel.<br />Solid Middle: Out of the SIlent Planet, Thin Line.., Dream of Mirrors, Mercenary.<br />Weakest Link: Nomad.
B000002U8I|5.0|Tina is no doubt a good performer, but no album she has recorded before or after her official comeback has matched the sheer artistic brilliance of this one.<BR> Although there have been several moments of glory during the ode to Ike songs of yesterday and the Ike bashing songs of today , Private Dancer embraces a liberation from confinement that Ms Turner has yet to match or equal.<BR> A classic from start to finish
B0000024VP|5.0|After Donovan's folky period on Hickory Records (and his hit Catch the Wind), he surfaced in 1966 with this gem of an album fueled by the hit title track.  With Shawn Phillips on Harpsichord and John Paul Jones' production, this was a very heady experience and unlike any of his previous albums to date.   My feelings towards this album are the same as they were in 1966 - front to back, a fantastic listening experience.  There's a number of standout tracks - Three King Fishers because of the fantastic guitar/harpsichord jam at the end, The Fat Angel (ostensibly about Mama Cass) and The Ferris Wheel are wonderful, but The Trip (the original flip side to the title track on 45) is a [great] song that sounds as good today as it did back then. His odd phrasing and psychedic background was new and different for the day and really holds up well to repeated listening.   Most of his floral cuteness wears a little thin on many of his albums, but not here. Celeste, the album closer, is a real tear jerker that has been covered by many artists but the original is still the best.   Let this album play once through and you too will be hooked.  His follow up - Mellow Yellow - is nearly as good.
B000001GPX|5.0|Quite simply put, this is an example of the kind of thing one<BR>could call a &quot;desert-island&quot; recording-something you'd want with<BR>you on a desert island.  Hits it right on the mark, excellent for<BR>a beginner to Beethoven.  Ranks with the best, that's all that <BR>needs to be said.  <br />Put this in your car cd player, and the frustrations of driving<BR>melt away.
B000002U8I|5.0|While Tina has always been a good entertainer, No album before or after her official comeback can match the artistic brilliance of this album. <BR> The sheer freedom of the material is a welcome interval to the ode to Ike tunes of the 60's &amp; 70' and the Ike bashing songs of later years. <BR>  Don't get me wrong there have been several moments of glory for Ms Turner.<BR> But this is a classic from start to finish.
0679720200|5.0|This book is about the death of innocence.  In other words, we all got dirt in our past; I don't care, if you ARE the spitting image of Ghandi or Mother Teresa.  Innocence simply does't exist.  And, \\"democracy begins only when we all realize that we are guilty.\\"  The point is: it isn't anyone's business what you think, do, or are.  Herd instinct triumphs in this novel, alas!  But, this book will make you want to fight for your individuality, overthrow the system, be who you are.  And, it will make you detest the injustice that plagues the world.  Get it and read it religiously.  <<The Plague>> is also very good, adding another flavor of intimacy.  Watch for the special parts where Camus lays out his interpretation of events- at the end of The Stranger- as this is where the madness of the injustice is explained.  Forget <<The Fall>> unless you are reading for the existentialist philosophy, but still it isn't too hot.  But, even in the good novels suspension of disbelief is a useful tool; use it.
B00005JKZQ|2.0|I swear there was a time when Robert De Niro was in a movie, it usually meant it was good. Right now I'm thinking of \\"Goodfellas\\", \\"Casino\\", \\"The Deer Hunter\\", \\"Raging Bull\\", and \\"The Godfather pt.2\\" not to mention many many other true classics in cinema. If De Niro wants to try \\"lighter\\" stuff, that's fine. I didn't mind \\"Analyze This\\". I thought it was a good movie. But, there's a line between good and bad films. And De Niro is sadly crossing this line.<br /> \\"Showtime\\" to be honest has a rather mindless plot. It's on the corny side. There is nothing memorable about this film. I saw it Saturday and today, I can't remember more than 5 mins put together of what I saw.<br /> Why is this movie so bad? It's boring. I never felt like the movie went anywhere. It has all these jokes and ideas in it's head but, nothing ever amounts to much. The jokes aren't that funny. I chuckled, I admit. But, there were no big laughs. The movie just plain and simple lacks in every department except for one. It has a nice cast; Robert De Niro, Eddie Murphy, Rene Russo and a cameo by Willam Shatner.<br /> \\"Showtime\\" is about two cops. One who does his job well and another who only became a cop because he was a bad waiter. The good cop is Mitch Preston (Robert De Niro) and bad one is Trey Sellars (Eddie Murphy). Sellers want to become an actor. And after an incident in the open moments of the film, (I won't give it away)Sellers finds out that he and Preston are now going to be partners on a reality cop show called...\\"Showtime\\". The reason for the show is because Preston is seen as a loose cannon. A \\"Dirty Harry\\" as tv producer Chase Renzi (Rene Russo) describes him. The \\"humor\\" comes from the fact that these two cops don't like each other. This all sounds mind numbingly boring to me.<br /> \\"Showtime\\" has one good scene. It deals with Willam Shatner trying to \\"teach\\" De Niro and Murphy to act like tv cops. Who knows, maybe this could have been a good film. But, what we see on screen is anything but a good film.<br /> Bottom-line: Few laughs in this mediocre yet predictable comedy. That has mundane acting. And is very boring!a good film.<BR> Bottom-line: Few laughs in this mediocre yet predictable comedy. That has mundane acting. And is very boring!
B00005N9CV|5.0|I am not a jazz buff but like some vocal artists with great phrasing and style. She has it. I never heard of Diana Krall until she appeared with Tony Bennett in a concert I attended at Hollywood Bowl in 2000. I liked her enough to get the CD. It's simply great. It's a fixture in my car CD changer and I can't wait to see and hear her again.
B00005JKYS|5.0|Being a young adult born in the year 1980, I never had a true understanding of the Vietnam war. I didn't understand the full mind-set of the era, even though I've read several books on the events that took place during the war. This movie, and this movie alone explained it to me. And in truth it's one of those movies that I wish I hadn't seen. <br />For an epic war story this movie had all of the aspects that make a movie great. It had outstanding cinematography that parallels both \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and \\"Black Hawk Down.\\" The choices made for the music to this movie only add to the atmosphere of the battlegrounds. And the opening sequence that ends with the audience staring down the barrel of a gun, creates an absolutely disturbing feeling. But this movie also includes a wonderful story behind the soldiers, that a lot of movies tend to forget about. The wives that had to survive the war finally got their just amount of screen time.(and not the terribly stupid love story time that \\"Pearl Harbor\\" spawned) The novel \\"Black Hawk Down\\" did an excellent job of showing both sides of the conflict, that Ridley Scott seemed to lose in the making of the movie. This time, director Randall Wallace didn't make the same mistake and that made for a much better movie. <br />The acting in this movie was superb. Mel Gibson did a great job as usual, continuing his quest to fight in every war that ever took place. Barry Pepper filled his role as reporter Joe Calloway nicely. Sam Elliot had by far the strongest characters in the movie, Sergeant Major Plumley, and I can't see anyone else in his role. Even Chris Klein, of \\"American Pie\\" fame, could pass for an actor in this movie. <br />What seals this movie as a great in my mind, was the closing minutes of the film. Some movies sadden me, but I can handle soldiers being killed and widows crying, without really blinking an eye. But this movie really got to me. The North Vietnamese general's lines at the close of the movie, sum up the despair that was to come. And I finally understood what the war did to this country. And for the first time in a long time, I left the theatre with tears in my eyes.<br />The Breakdown: <BR>1.  Plot- 9 (Great choice for a true life war topic)<BR>2.  Characters- 10 (Nicely chosen characters to focus on out of the hundreds who fought the battle)<BR>3.  Flow- 9 (Spent an adequate time on the background story and the action scenes went by quickly)<BR>4.  Atmosphere- 10 (Battle grounds were realistic and excellent choices for music)<BR>5.  Cinematography- 10 (Beautifully shot and realistic special effects)<BR>6.  Entertainment factor- 10 (the time flew by)<BR>7.  Replay factor- 8 (solid movie, but some will be bothered to much to watch a second time)<BR>8.  Casting/character depth- 9 (everyone deserved to be in this movie and Sam Elliot was awesome)<BR>9.  Relevance to genre- 9 (Great war movie that had very emotional aspects)<BR>10. X-factors- 10 (Vietnamese general's speech to close the film along with the scenery will be in my head for a long time)<br />Total: 94/100
B00005OM4N|3.0|This album is typical and the songs are all stuff we'd expect from her. But isn't that what we love about Britney, the fluff, the corn, the predicitability. I must admit, the Neptunes did Britney a huge favor by making \\"Slave 4 U\\" I hated her until I heard that song...Also, I'm feeling the summer song \\"Anticipating\\" and \\"Lonely.\\" Do I recommend this album? Well, no. Burn only those songs I mentioned because the rest of the album I don't care too much for. Save money.
0800177177|5.0|...This movie was NOT meant to be a faithful rendition of the original novel by Bram Stoker (\\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" in the title notwithstanding.) Vampire lore owes a great debt to this...gothic novelist, but the movie had  more grandiose goals than mere mimicry. This movie is a synthesis of the various subplots, interpretations, lore and speculation that has flowered AROUND the novel over the years. This is the movie of the Dracula tradition, not a purist's adaption of the novel.<br />The departures from the novel are not mere eye candy meant to appeal to a modern audience. Debates about how effectively the eye candy appeals are irrelevant. This was not their purpose. These \\"departures\\" are powerful interpretations that have compelled so many viewers, readers, and thinkers that they have become part of the way  we \\"know\\" Dracula. People have been thinking about Dracula for years. This movie is a documentation of that thought.<br />Lucy's and Mina's highly sensual encounters with the Count are  largely accepted interpretations of the unsupervised and thus highly suspicious encounters in the novel. The addition of \\"topical\\" material, like early cinematographs in the background, delve into the social context of the novel. Stoker's characters are fascinated with new technology. This informs their hopes, just as the mysterious villain from the east threatens their civilization. The brief little dance between Mina and Van Helsing represents the valorous love, tinged with barely concealed sensuality and possessiveness, that motivates all the men who fight for \\"their girls.\\" Dracula himself has had so many romantic and sexual fantasies strung about him over the years that his transformation into a \\"lover\\" in this film is hardly suspect. Yes, this is a departure from the text, but certainly not the tradition that has evolved around Stoker's compelling title character. <br />In all, this movie deserves kudos for taking on a rich and complex tradition rather than merely a novel. The fact that it manages to be beautiful and include so many quality performances is simply icing on the cake. The result is perhaps disjointed, but faithful in its goal.
B0000025RI|5.0|What can I say about this album that hasn't already been said or heard. It's a wonderful album, one which I still listen to this day. This album is one of those essentials. I remember I bought about 5-6 copies of this album because we listen to it so much over the years that they either get scratched beyond belief, lost from always being out of the cd case from excessive use, etc. I love it and always will. Great album, great artist.
068484267X|4.0|Frank McCourts memoir of his childhood in Depression Ireland is a tale of a struggle against poverty, orthodox religious affirmations and nationalistic fervour. What lifts him from human degradation is ambition and the sheer will to live. His fascination for America is his salvation as he drives himself to achieve the ecstatic vision of the Statue of Liberty. McCourts depiction of human strength is simple yet profound. He is a talented storyteller. This is a must read for all who are in the brink of giving up hope.
0792156684|2.0|First of all let me say I loved this movie. It is one of my favorites. So why am I giving it 2 stars? This DVD has no extras! Titanic is the biggest movie ever and there's no extras! There have been countless TV specials on this movie about the history of the ship and how they did the special effects but none of that show up on this DVD. Not even the Celine Dion music video of \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" which is one of the biggest songs of all time. I'm sure it'll only be a matter of time before Titanic is re-released as \\"The Collectors Edition\\" with everything I've been talking about but that makes me even more angry. These movie companies release a DVD and then a short time later they bring out \\"The Collectors Edition\\" so everybody who bought the first one got ripped off!
0142000655|5.0|This is an amazing book. I wasn't sure what to expect when I first opened it, but then I was hooked. This book teaches you about good and evil. Every character was interesting enough to be their own character. from this book I learned a lot about the world in 1900 and today.
B00000JMQC|4.0|A lot of people have criticised this for ruining the image of Oz that was imprinted on everyone's mind when they saw the classic musical 'The Wizard Of Oz'.  Yet this is what the Disney remake's main attraction is, that it is bold and daring and sticks closely to the actual stories.<br />The distinction between the grey real world is well evoked (although admitedly this distinction was better in the original movie).  Oz is a sparkling land of wonder whilst home is boring and overcast.  Dorothy (a superb debut from 'The Craft' actress Fairuza Balk) finds Oz after a nightmarish experience at a clinic where she's to receive some kind of electric therapy.  This theme of nightmare and dreams is constant, with plenty of eerie figures that will probably scare younger children.  Whilst the first movie was a lot more sweet-natured, this is more grim.  The 'wheelers' and even the good guys such as the talking chicken, are perturbing to say the least.  However, Mombi the witch is what people will really remember.  Missing a head, she keeps the heads of all of the beautiful maidens of the land locked up in a long corridor so that she can switch whenever she feels like it.  Indeed, a corrupted Oz with a crumbling yellow brick road and a delapidated emerald city couldn't be further removed from the original and give a worrying air of anticipation that is rare in a children's film.<br />The final scene involving a rescue attempt of the Scarecrow are also brilliant, with some truly impressive special effects as well as a touching scene between Dorothy and new-found friend Tick-Tock, a robot.  It's a shame that this wasn't a bigger success at the box office, as its ending involving Dorothy looking at her reflection to find the princess of Oz and then finding that it's vanished, provoke a dreamy quality which marks the escapism that people require from the mundane, workaday world.
0142000655|5.0|When I picked up this book I was not sure what to expect, but I soon got hooked. It was a refuge for me and I found it incredible to live the lives of those in Salinas, California. This book talks about good and evil in ways that I hadn't even thought of before. All the characters were so interesting they could have been their own story. This book opens your eyes to the world of  1900 and today. I highly recomend it.
B000000OPZ|5.0|That is what WHITESNAKE will be remembered for. Coverdale's singing is beyond reason, Sykes takes advantage of the opportunity given to him and proves that he feels better as the first-guitar man. Unthinkable riffs are 'Still of the Night' and the remakes of 'Crying in the Rain' and 'Here I Go Again' that first appeared as classic blues songs on 'Saints & Sinners' album (1982). The sound also helped the commercial success of this album as it is remarkably solid and full. \\"Is This Love\\" hit the charts at No.2, even though it sounds more like a pop song
B000002KBU|5.0|This is one of the best pieces of recorded material of all time. It may not be techincally this or that, but it is still a masterpiece none the less. I have kept the vinyl version in great shape, and bought the CD. I can't think of a track that I don't like, or one that I like over the other. I own most of Joni's work, but of them all I am most fond of this one. I listen when happy, or not... it still touches me after all these years.
0451191153|1.0|Appalling load of tosh from a selfish and racist writer, which will appeal to tepid minds and people looking for an easy codification of life.
B00003CXHJ|1.0|Right, so this film isn't actually based on the real life event, so therefore we British shouldn't feel offended by the disgraceful revisionist ideas of this film?<BR>This doesn't stop you Yankees waving your stars and stripes every time an American hero (no matter if they're fictional or not) kills a nasty Russian, Vietnamese or German does it?<BR>This film may be made up, but a very similar event did take place, so you can understand why we British feel offended at whats being implied.<BR>If you can't tell I really did not like this film.
B00003CXI1|5.0|READ all of the books.  You must!  They are terrific!  These religious fundamentalists criticizing the movie are complete lunatics.  It is complete (and wonderful) fantasy.  It is appropriate for children who are old enough to not be scared by evil villains (I'd estimate age 7 and older).  Please see this movie - buy it!
B00005UJBP|5.0|The Japanese version of Britney contains 2 bonus tracks and the original 12 tracks.  This new side of Britney is shown in this incredible album.  The hot single 'I'm A Slave 4 U' really puts more R&B into her singing.  Her famous ballad 'I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman (co. written by Dido)' really deserves its best.  This is one of her best songs, which is even featured on Crossraods.  The two bonus tracks are wonderful!  I can't believe JIVE refused to add them to the US release.  I Run Away is probably one of her best ballads ever.  When I Found You is also good, and I think they should have all been on the US release.  Too bad they didn't have 'Before The Goodbye' in this version.  That is one of her best songs ever, and was one of the first to be produced for the album.
B00005R23X|4.0|I bought the Superbit version and I found that the picture and sound quality were superior to the standard DVD. What set me back was the loss of extras due to the disk space needed to store the excellent sound and pictures.<br />The story itself was better than expected and I found Gary Oldman's acting outclassing every other character and made Keanu Reeves look like a novice.<br />Highly recommended, and one to add to yr collection
B000008LUN|5.0|This really is a great album! I don't think they ever topped<br />this album! PHENOMENON has a very enjoyable blend of hard rock songs<br />and acoustic guitar driven folk-like songs. The hard rockers<br />are terrific, of course: TOO YOUNG TO KNOW is a very catchy and<br />upbeat hard rocker, with a great guitar solo from SCHENKER;<br />ROCK BOTTOM is the heaviest track here, similar in structure<br />to the RUSH song WORKING MAN and has a very long instrumental<br />section where SCHENKER solos his rump off and OH MY is a very<br />short but enjoyable riff rocker. MICHEAL SCHENKER is definitely<br />the star here, with his melodic and very tasteful lead guitar<br />playing; almost every guitar solo on here is GREAT and stays in<br />the memory. His soloing reminds me of ACE FREHLEY's, tho SCHEN-<br />KER would go on to be 20 times the guitar player. SCHENKER's<br />guitar playing would improve tremendously on future albums; he<br />would definitely get much faster, but his songwriting was very<br />strong on this. Of the acoustic songs, my two favorte are TIME<br />ON MY HANDS and CRYSTAL LIGHT; they both feature some terrific,<br />emotional singing from PHIL MOGG and are brim full of melody<br />and catchy vocal parts.<br /> A PHENOMENAL HARD ROCK ALBUM!
0790733226|5.0|This DVD has the best commentary on special effects that I have ever encountered.  One of the people responsible for those effects comments that this is the only movie which he still had to work on after seeing the preview, though he is sure the people who saw the preview never noticed the subtle effects which had not been added yet.  Everything in the movie seems to reflect a level of involvement that real life rarely offers, creating a tension which is so great that the best scene in the movie was cut because someone laughed at that point in the preview.  I might have laughed myself, if I was there.  The level of disagreement about life on other planets is intense, and evidence that something far more advanced might be observing us is as frightening as this movie makes it seem.  My favorite disagreement was about whether a chair would be necessary for space travel.  If the design for a pod doesn't include a chair, don't try to take one.  Philosophy might also be better if it wasn't an excuse for getting some university chair, which is not the kind of philosophy reflected in this effort.  Embarking on this trip, which presses the limits of what might happen at the speed of light, could easily be considered more thrilling than the finer points of any philosophy.
0805047905|4.0|This book was initially well-received by my toddler, but has since lost some of its luster. Whether the story line or the illustrations, I suppose appeal is subjective, regardless of the age.<br />At any rate, this book goes from page to page, asking each animal what is seen. The response is always an animal of a different color, so the book is educational for its identification of both animals and colors. I like it for that reason.<br />The book is a good one to have in your toddler's library. I recommend it.
B00003CXRM|5.0|As comedies go, this one is difficult to explain.  George Nelson, while setting a record for the number of banks robbed in two hours, happens to shoot a herd of cows.  The last cow in the movie must represent the idea that the death penalty would be entirely appropriate in that case, and George Nelson is last seen agreeing, but I shouldn't be giving so much away.  The easiest part of this movie to understand is the idea that the main characters could record a hit record.  Life is imitating art on a large scale when the soundtrack itself is a best seller.  Having a hit record becomes so much more important than anything else in the movie, the comedy might seem insignificant.  This is too funny to seem like real history, but it is the perfect commentary on old time anything that might be related to hard times in Mississippi.
0694003611|5.0|This little book, in the board book edition (are there any other versions available?) was given to my son when he was only a few months old, and it became an early favorite.  It is the story of a rabbit bidding a \\"good night\\" to every object in his bedroom.  There is a melodic cadence to it, and with repeated use, would seem to be an effective tool in the Pavlovian or Classical conditioning of your child in going to sleep during or shortly after its reading.  The animations are made so that the rabbit's bedroom gets darker as the story unfolds, and it is truly bedtime for all, upon the book's conclusion.  <br />This is a very good (if not \\"definite\\") selection for toddlers and perhaps preschoolers.  I recommend.
B00004RF98|5.0|OK, there was a time when I just didn't feel like seeing this movie, because I dismissed it as one of those cheesy musicals that Hollywood put out year after year when this one was made, but then I actually saw it.  What a fun, fun movie!  The music is exceptional, the story is incredibly amusing, and there are plenty of classic moments to be found here besides Mr. Kelly hanging from the lamp pole.  Anybody who gets through the \\"Make 'em Laugh\\" number without at least chuckling isn't human.  Lots of funny jokes about the times, like people calling talking motion pictures \\"vulgar!\\"  Well, I'm not gonna give the whole thing away, so just check out this movie.  It'll change the way you think about musicals forever.
0802130208|5.0|To be honest, I had never even heard of this book. I bought it at B and N's because it was on sale, and the first few pages were interesting enough. Fate, she was kind that day. :) It's one of the most engaging books I've ever read. Hilarious and tangible. It also uses a vocabulary that would be easy reading for a 9th grader. If you're a night reader like me, be prepared to stay up late! You won't want to stop reading!
B000060OYV|4.0|This album is the Japanese version of the long-awaited \\"A Night at The Opera\\" (ANATO) from Blind Guardian. After more than three years of silence and their masterpiece \\"Nightfall In The Middle Earth\\" (NIME), only a super-release could satisfy the super-exigent listeners that were captivated with NIME about three years ago. As I am among those \\"super-exigent listeners\\" I can't give five stars to this album in spite of its high quality and the exquisite musicianship they have deployed here. Why? Because it is somewhat chaotic and disorganized, it abused of double-bass drumming, its songs are less epic than those contained in NIME, it lacks of \\"feeling\\" (I would say that it's a tad heartless) and it contains too many similar tunes (the songwriting and resources shown in more than a half of its tracks can be squeezed in just a couple songs!). I guess that old die-hard fans of Blind Guardian will love this CD because of its aggressiveness, its intensive work on choirs and its speedy-power-metal sound, but those longing for more diversity and finer music will be certainly disappointed.<br />Additionally, that title \\"A Night at The Opera\\" makes your expectations rise to the heaven, and you will find yourself quickly landing (or crashing!) after immediately discovering that this ANATO from Blind Guardian has nothing to do with the ANATO from Queen -which was in fact an instant classic. Sincerely, I was waiting for more progressiveness, more variety from song to song, more art and soul in choirs (I am speaking here even about the choirs of NIME!)... Where is the \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" of this ANATO? Where is here the mosaic of contrasts that Queen delivered once in their homonym release? How did Blind Guardian dare to call this CD ANATO? Don't miss me, this is overall a superb release that will satisfy the people loyal to Blind Guardian, but it can't be compared to the ANATO from Queen, neither to the magnum opus NIME from themselves! Perhaps \\"Battlefield\\", \\"The Maiden and TheMinstrel Knight\\", \\"Punishment Divine\\", \\"And Then There Was Silence\\" and \\"Harvest Of Sorrow\\" (the bonus track) are the highlights to this album. All the other tracks are also great, but perhaps they wouldn't add too much to the entire recipe, which is in general exaggerated in condiment. <br />Finally, go for it without hesitating, but for me NIME keeps being the best from them - keep that fact in mind when listening ANATO: this is not NIME II. Four stars and a half is a fair score!
0345349571|5.0|Tuchman's book has proved an invaluable resource to me, as I am currently writing a work of fiction that takes place in 1300s London.  Her book is pure pleasure to read;  the writing style is fluid, vivid and colorful, and she writes with such intimacy of the characters that one could almost believe she knew King Edward or the Black Prince.  In short, this book excellently portrays the 1300s in all its gruesome-yet-rivoting detail, leaving we medievalists thoroughly satiated.

B000001ELD|5.0|Of course everybody loves Gene Simmons the demon. His solo album has so many guest stars like on of my favorite guitarists, Joe Perry of Aerosmith, Cher & Chassity, Bob Seger, etc. But don't be fooled and think that this makes the album a great one. In my opinion, this album is TERRIBLE! All those Gene Simmons fans, don't expect this to sound like KISS (\\"Calling Dr. Love\\", \\"Christine Sixteen\\", \\"She\\" or \\"Deuce\\"). This album is by far the worst of the four solo albums. And the part about it that I don't like is while Gene's albums is terrible, he has the nerve to pick on Peter's album for being different than KISS's ordinary sound, and claiming Peter can't sing. How rude and inconsiderate is that? I got news for you Gene, outside of KISS, you can't write a tune to save your life! If you buy this CD, you will know why I said Gene can't write a tune outside of KISS!
0790749556|3.0|Much has been said about this film over the years. Many think it's somehow below par because Astaire & Rogers are playing secondary co-stars rather than leads. But consider this: each new A-R film borrowed plot points from their previous one. They were 'comic relief' co-stars in 3 different movies: FLYING DOWN TO RIO, ROBERTA, and FOLLOW THE FLEET- the last two movies both with Randolph Scott and a singing love interest. These two latter films alternated in relaease with GAY DIVORCEE, TOP HAT, and SWING TIME- and if the plot wasn't 'mistaken identity' (my least favorite story), then it had Astaire & Rogers as one of two couples. I actually preferred these films a tad more because Astaire and Rogers weren't carrying the heavier half of the plot. They already know each other and can make wicked sideline commentary while waiting to go on the dance floor. This is most evident in the wonderful first duet in ROBERTA, \\"I'll Be Hard To Handle,\\" a wonderfully spontaneous tap debate in a rehearsal setting. This sequence transfers to the critical plot twist with the title character. While the film does go surprisingly dramatic, it's carried off quite nicely with Irene Dunne and title character Helen Westley- already established in a kind of mother-daughter working relationship- in the breathtaking scene which becomes the song \\"Yesterdays.\\" (It's a bewitching moment when the light dims in the room as Dunne's vocal fades away). And all the crazy fashions are worth enduring for the Astaire-Rogers duet of \\"Smoke Gets In Your Eyes.\\" Rogers emerges as one of the models on parade (following a cameo by a platinum Lucille Ball) in what looks like a satin nightgown and joins Astaire for a sublime walk-around-the-floor. My only complaint lies in the poor sound quality of the musical soundtrack more than anything else.
B000002MNL|5.0|I purchase this cd the same year that it came at stores. Then, i losed it and its the day that i have not forget about this title (its been 6 years or more). All the songs in this cd just capture me. I have like four cds of Morrissey and all of them are really good, so, if you like his style or you dont know him but want to, this is the cd to start with, because it has variety and power. (forgive me for my bad english)

B00005JKJA|3.0|As I walked through the parking lot of the movie theater to see this film, I heard exiting moviegoers saying things like, \\"I'm NEVER going to another David Lynch movie again!\\"  \\"Amateurs,\\" I thought.<br />By the end of the film, I understood those comments.  Although I will most certainly patronize future Lynch films, this one angered me because it kept me thinking throughout that something would eventually tie all the weird plot twists together.  When it didn't happen, I just got mad, feeling like I had been watching two and a half hours of form with no substance.  I thought, \\"Couldn't Lynch have made a movie that made at least SOME sense?\\"  I spent those two and a half hours trying to remember all the weird little twists, thinking they would be important later.  However, I strained my brain for no payoff.<br />However, I will say this:  Those two and a half hours do go by pretty darn fast.  It's not a boring movie by any means.  And a totally abstract movie sounds like a great idea.  Unfortunately, this wasn't weird enough to fall into that category.<br />I will also say this:  I do plan to watch it again, as perhaps it will make more sense the second time around.  First impression, however, is THREE STARS.
B00005UQ9F|4.0|Session 9 is an intense, but somehow low key film that moves in and out of being a story about working class people trying to make a living, and a haunted house tell. I'm not sure at what point I started questioning the movie's action, but it seems to me at some point the whole thing went askew, turning into a slasher movie. I know this sounds like a bad review, but its not, this is a well-crafted film that uses a building as a character better than any film I've seen in a long time. In my opinion it would have been a little stronger if the working class aspect and the work these guys were doing had been played up a little more, or maybe if the filmmaking crew would have gone more for the creepiness & ghost story- shoot I don't know! But I did enjoy the ride, but at the end I looked around and didn't really know where the hell I was!
B00003CXI1|3.0|I love Harry Potter.  Like everyone who does, I've read the books many times. I saw the movie the day it opened. And I have pre-ordered the DVD.<br />It is a fantastic movie, but only if you are as familiar with the books as I, and my fellow fans are.<br />It is the Reader's Digest version.<br />I realize that it is extremely difficult to put a long book onto the screen sucessfully.  They did a decent job, and it was fun and interesting to watch.  However, the part that makes the books so absolutely enjoyable was missing -- the character development.<br />The movie is devoid of character development all together, and in fact some characters never get a name.  Take for instance the character of Neville.  While he is in the movie, most first timers to Harry Potter were highly confused when he stood up to his friends and later received points to win the house cup.  Meanwhile, if you read the book, you not only worry about Neville after he is frozen, but cry when he wins the cup.<br />It is a good movie, but pales in comparison to the book.
2218717166|5.0|I was introduced to the Bescherelle series by someone at work, and on my last trip to Paris, bought it for my own grammatical sanity.  It categorizes the verbs into three groups, and conjugates a great number of verbs to justify the categorization.  Afterwards there's a section on each group, explaining how the verb used, and identifies the exception cases. <br />This is a great educational tool for all those studying in french.

067101756X|5.0|Here is my thoughts on this book. This is a fascinating book that is well written, logical, and easy to read. It clearly explains how the great jump in our technology happened in the last 50 or so years. IF it's true. If it's not a true book, then the author is very creative and the book is still a good read.<br />I for one do not doubt that this whole book might be based on truth. Basically the author recounts how he got a filing cabinet full of information that he had to 'farm out' to companies. The information? technology that was retrieved from a downed space craft (UFO) that crashed in Roswell. The author recounts how he helped share this information with others so that they could use it to increase our technology.<br />Fascinating.
B000001ES4|4.0|I like the album, but I would prefer more traditional Irish music. Their style is more synthesized or augmented than acoustical. Still, it's a good string of music. I play it and their first album frequently at home, b/c my wife used them to help her relax while in labor with each of our two children.
0060934913|4.0|I like this book. Its funny, at times witty and I kept on reading while I was having a severe alergic reaction to something. This book makes me appreciate the people who put food on my table. Now I tip more.
B00001ZULV|2.0|I love Genesis, but I cannot endorse this collection.  Naturally, it is impossible to include all the songs that fans might want in a single-volume; that doesn't bother me so much.  However, I think it was a huge mistake to shorten many of the songs here -- especially \\"Mama\\", in which an entire verse is removed at its emotional arc.<br />My opinion: die-hard Genesis fans will get excited at the start of each song...and be annoyed by the end of many.  For this reason, I can only give the collection 2 stars.
0800141601|2.0|First Knight probably has the best look to it out of all the  other movies about the charcters of Camelot. The score by Jerry Goldsmith is superb. Sean Connery and Julia Ormond are probably the best Kind Arthur and  Guinevere ever as well. Richard Gere however just doesn't work  as Lancelot. He looks clumsy with a sword, he's sort of laughable too.  He lacks the edge of  Viggo Mortenson in  Lord of the Rings  or even the charm of Heath Ledger in a Knight's Tale. Even just looking at the cover of the dvd, it's obvious that something is wrong with the picture and it's not Connery or Ormond. Gere  lacks the heroic look that is needed for Lancelot. I can't say that he at least doesn't have some chemestry with Ormond though.<br /><br />  The film still wouldn't of been great without him as Lancelot I must admit because the movie still has it's problems. It's predictibale for one thing, everyime  Guinevere is in trouble you just know Lancelot is gonna come to rescue. Meanwhile it would of been nice to see Arthur get some action instead of being smothered with the predictability that something is gonna happen between Lancelot and Guinevere that will betray Athur's trust in them.
0871137380|5.0|Mark Bowden deserves applause for his carefully researched account of the Battle of Mogadishu.  Black Hawk Down is an excellent account of the battle, drawing on numerous interviews with the men who fought the battle to paint a vivid picture of the fighting.<br />Black Hawk Down sets the stage first, explaining what had happened in the year leading up to the battle and how both sides had come to their respective positions.  Then he rolls right into the battle, taking the reader from the preparation (and the numerous errors made then) to the fast rope into downtown Mogadishu, and how things started going wrong right from the start.<br />Black Hawk Down is a portrait of the valor and courage of the American soldiers who managed to fight off attacks by an enemy who outnumbered them by ten to one, and who were ready to finish the job they'd started before the Clinton Administration chose to end the mission.  It is a fitting tribute to the soldiers who fought and died in the battle.
0440224764|4.0|This book was gripping - I could not put it down.  However, the ending changed that.<br />Then ending consisted of maybe 2 pages.

B00005JKJA|1.0|Quite possibly one of the most boring films of great potential I've ever seen. I just wanted it to be over. This film could have been so good if they'd been a little less wanky, and a bit more in touch with the characters'. None of the shortfall was due to the cast mind you - stunning performances by them. It's the script that made me want to drive nails through my toenails. I hope this gets remade some time in the future with changes, because it was several yawns short of brilliant.
B000002AZ8|3.0|I'm a huge Pearl Jam fan - been following them since the beginning.  So when Vitalogy came out, I was more than a little disappointed.  While VS found the band exploring some new ground after the success of Ten, Vitalogy showed the true extent of the experimentation that was going on.  I wasn't impressed.<br />To be honest, I believe there are as many good songs and there are bad on Vitalogy.  Nothingman clearly makes up for the pain inflicted upon the listener during Tremor Christ.  Corduroy compensates for Spin The Black Circle.  Last Exit and Immortality offer a reward for having stayed with the album through Pry, To and Bugs.  And Betterman makes up for the tragedy that is Stupid Mop.<br />So, while there have been better Pearl Jam albums both prior to and since Vitalogy, its worth a listen.  If nothing else, it shows an interesting point in the development of the band.  Lessons learned from failures are just as important as those learned from successes.

B000001DWG|5.0|Mother Love Bone is one of the larger branches that formed the Seattle grunge family tree that gained popularity in the early 1990's.  And what a formidable branch of that tree the band was.<br />Led by vocalist and visionary Andrew Wood, Mother Love Bone combined elements of classic rock, punk and glam to form something truly unique.  This collection compiles the band's total output.<br />Highlights include `This Is Shangrila,' `Stardog Champion,' `Bone China' and the remarkable `Chloe Dancer/Crown of Thorns.'  What is astounding is that Mother Love Bone could be bizarre, obnoxious, and truly moving all at the same time.<br />When Wood died, Stone Gossard and Jeff Ament teamed up with Chris Cornell and Matt Cameron (then of Soundgarden) and newcomer Mike McCready to record a few songs in tribute.  This project became the brilliant Temple Of The Dog.  And from those sessions, Pearl Jam was born.  While Wood's absence from the music scene was and is truly missed, the good that came out of the tragedy is remarkable.<br />This is an important collection.
B00003CXXP|5.0|I'm not too surprised to see some very negative reviews here, this is an unusual and challenging film that requires some patience. If you are looking for a breezy date flick or sci-fi romp, look elsewhere. If instead you want a thought-provoking quest that examines a whole range of fundamental human issues from daringly original perspectives, you must see this. Kubrick began by asking, what is the limit to what our machines can accomplish? Could a robot actually learn to love, to be human? By the end of Haley Joel Osment's quest, you might ask yourself if we could ever be as human as this robot. Along the way, the film also asks, how we are intelligent and conscious? What basis do we have for holding a machine, or a human, morally accountable for his actions? What is it that makes us care about our loved ones, or feel devotion to a higher being? How real is any human interaction? How much are our relationships really worth to us? This film elevates science fiction to its highest calling, to use fantastic technology and an outlandish scenario as the only possible method to make a totally new and original strike at the most basic human questions. In that way, it is on par with Kubrick's previous sci-fi masterpiece, 2001: A Space Odyssey, and with the Carl Sagan film, Contact. I never knew what turn it would make next - I was astonished. The film's only weaknesses come from the changes made by Spielberg after he took over the project after Kubrick's death - for instance, the occasional and totally needless narration. Those are minor distractions though from a fitting finale to Kubrick's startling career.
B0000027RL|5.0|There was only a little advance buzz on this but I was at the record store when they started stocking shelves with Ten.  I had been a fan of Soundgarden for a while and had recently picked up the Temple of the Dog album so I had some familiarity with the band.  But I don't think I was really expecting something like Ten.<br />Unlike many of the `Seattle grunge' albums released at the time, Ten was polished (years later the band maintains, and I'd have to agree, that it was perhaps a little too polished).  The production was excellent, the writing solid, and the playing magnificent.  The band was able to blend melody with aggression, beauty with raw emotion.  And Eddie's voice tied the whole package together.  When I heard Ten, it was like a bolt of lightening.  And I was hooked.<br />By now, everyone's heard most of the songs on this album ad nauseum.  Since Ten, Pearl Jam have changed directions many times over and created some incredible music.  But I don't think they've put out an album since Ten that's been as powerful.  Very few bands can claim to have produced such a masterpiece.
B000025C85|5.0|I have had this CD since the mid 80's when a friend from England introduced me to Jarre.  This is of my favorites in my \\"New Age\\"/electronic CD collection.

I am listening to Zoolookologie as I write this - enjoy!
B00005OAIE|4.0|I knew nothing about John Mayer - hadn't even read a review of the album - before it picked up Room for Squares but I was attracted to the disc, in part, by the bonus disc that came with the copy I purchased.  On it Mayer covers Stevie Ray Vaughan and Jimi Hendrix instrumentals.  Because of the quality of this bonus disc, I've got to assume that Mayer is a misunderstood musician.<br />Room for Squares comes off as a pleasing pop/rock album complete with blues and jazz influences, nice hooks and pleasing vocals.  Some could say its bland but I have enjoyed this album a lot.  After listening to the bonus disc, I came to realize that Mayer is one talented guitarist, truly a master musician.  The problem:  this doesn't really shine through on Room for Squares.  Much like Eric Johnson, known for both stunning guitar instrumentals and bland pop songs, I think Mayer's a little misunderstood.  He's got talent that he doesn't showcase.  Clearly, he needs to put his incredible guitar talents to good use on his next release.
B000002MZ6|5.0|A fantastic example of Oldfield's genious. Recently bought this album and it is a long, VERY relaxing, set of songs. Most flow from one to the next (in the usual Oldfield style) and it captures a really nice sound. If your driving on the motorway in the dark &amp; rain this is a perfect sound track to enjoy. It's also great to sleep to. Unlike his discovery album, for example, it has very few lyrics involved, so it's more like Tubular Bells 2- but in a fully relaxing way. After a hard days work- this album is perfect. If you are an Oldfield fan, and don't own this, then it's perhaps the best one to add to your collection. If you are just getting into Mike Oldfield, then this will probably hook you immediately.
1570427496|5.0|I read this book because after I saw the movie, it touched my heart. I wanted to see if it was this good in the book so I borrowed it from my friend Faith. Also, the cover seemed so romantic and peaceful. When I read the back, it seemed so sad and romantic that I just had to read it. Plus, many of my friends recommended this book to me. I'm glad they did.<BR>The main character is Landon, a troublesome boy. He doesn't really care about school or his future. At first, I got mad at the way he treated Jamie Sullivan. However, after seeing his love for her in the end, I completely changed my view about him. He is so sweet and loyal to her. If I had a boyfriend, I would want a guy like him.<BR>I fell in love with this book as soon as I read it. It is so sad and romantic. I cried when I read the end. It gives me hope to think of such a love. This book was so sweet and touching. I could read it over and over and never get tired of it.
B00003CWTH|1.0|This is the worst movie ever! i loved Boogie Nights and then Paul Thomas Anderson comes out with the worst movie ever! I hated it. When frogs where raining I felt like cutting my own arm of with a butter knife. I dont care what he was trying to symboliz, it was ridiculous. This movie was so long and slow, i dont see anyone being able to pay attention. i love movies, and usually can stay entertained by Teletubbies, but this movie was ridculous. If you are reading this review dont ever rent this movie......ever! I'm serious. This is not ingenious, or profound...It's just plain dumb. Dont try to find any connections between anything cuz they are none. You mind as well rent \\"Trucks\\" or \\"Leprechan 4:in space.\\" the story line just might be better in those.
0871137380|4.0|The gripping and suspensful story of Black Hawk Down by Mark Bowden, recalls the inncident of 1993's Somalia's uprising.  With its carefully detailed story of how some of America's finest soldiers fought fearlessly, Mark Bowden can capture all the action in a breathtaking story.  While embarking on a mission to capture one of somalia's biggest warlords, Rangers and Delta force troops get tangled into a bloody mess of combat..in the air and on the ground.  With so many gun fights, some of the millitaries \\"invinvible\\" helicopters get shot down and a few men become prisoners of war.  Page by page of never ending action, this book takes you on a wild ride through the streets of Somalia, and makes you belive that you were actually there.  If you thought the movie of Black Hawk Down was great, great ready for the book becuase it is so much better.

6303433766|3.0|Heavenly Creatures. It has the sort of beautiful tracking shots and pristine images of beauty interlaced with claymation fantasy sequences that looks like what would happen if the art sensibilities of a painter crisscrossed with the storytelling skill and photographic eye of a filmmaker. Director Peter Jackson has this command of colors, shape, form and also story, characters, plot that make Heavenly Creatures not only a dazzling visual experience, but also a story that resonates long after you see it. <br />The story, which is based on fact, about 2 murderous New Zealand girls, is amazingly well-developed. It is slow moving but the characters come through strongly. I think that Pauline and Juliet are two distinctive movie characters as film comes.  The drama never lowers into melodrama and the film could have made the characters black and white visions of evil or insanity. Instead the girls are neither. They are simply confused, insecure, and a little brainwashed by their own obsession with each other to the point where they have little control over themselves.<br />The acting is simply incredible. Kate Winslet is a remarkable actress and many of us have known it for a long time. Her performance is nothing short of astounding. She creates a<BR>convincing, albeit eccentric and exaggerated character in Juliet- rich, unpretentious, brilliant, and obsessive. Melanie Lynskey I didn't enjoy as much (her character is unpleasant, no fault to the actress), but she is an ideal lonesome, darker counterpart to<BR>Juliet's near manic. Her facial expressions seemed to say it all... her anger at her mom, dad, Jon, the world which she felt was trapping her.<br />Though I had a few reservations after I saw this (too slow, too ambiguous), ultimately the message that sometimes good people do inexplicably shocking things, and the visual splendor of Peter Jackson's directing have stuck with me. <br />Heavenly Creatures is worth seeing, and worth loving.
B0000027RL|5.0|This CD is a brilliant piece of work that shows Pearl Jam's excellence.  It includes Jeremy, one of the best songs by Pearl Jam ever, Even Flow which is also a great song.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes Pearl Jam or bands similar to them.

Before I read this book, it was out on movie, but I preferred to read first and watch the movie.  This book was poignant, and I wouldn't forget it soon.  I enjoyed so much reading this beautiful love story.  It is one of my favorite books.  Almost all of my friends read this story and suggested for me to reading it.  While reading this book, it was hard for me to let go of it.  Story was fascinating and good as Harry Potter.  Landon Carter went to Beaufort High, and once been in love.  He never thought he would fall in love with Jamie Sullivan, a daughter of Baptist minister.  She was a kind of a girl who would prefer walking than a ride, spend spare time with orphans, and carry and read an old bible during lunch than hang out with friends.  She wore a same sweater everyday, and always had an old bible with her.  She didn't have much friends at school, but many ladies knew Jamie and how benign she was.<br />Landon was voted as a student body president.  And had to join a drama club.  Jamie and Landon met many times during drama club, but they didn't talk.  There was a Homecoming dance coming in Beaufort High, and as a president of the school, Landon didn't want to mortify himself, so he took out a yearbook to see who was available for him to go with to the dance.  Not too many were available except Jamie Sullivan.  Landon looked at her closely and closed the book.  He thought for a moment.'Jamie can't be that bad.'  So he got up and went to ask her to the dance.  \\"Jamie, would you go to the Homecoming dance with me?\\"  \\"Landon, what a surprise! Sure, I would go with you.  On one condition, promise me that you won't fall in love with me.\\"  Landon almost laughed at the promise and gave her his word.  The night of the dance didn't go as well as he had planned.  It was not that Jamie was bad, but she was a bit tedious compared to others.  <br />From next day, Landonwalked Jamie to her home as she wished.  Landon tried avoiding meeting and talking with Jamie since the dance was over, but Jamie kept following and made Landon talk.  After some time, Landon liked talking with Jamie, and started doing things with Jamie.  They went to dinners, visited orphans, and walked home together all the time.  On Christmas eve, Landon collected jars for Helping Orphans as Jamie wanted.  He counted the money inside, but was shocked at how little there was.  He thought Jamie would be disappointed, so he took out his $400 and added to what was there and took it to Jamie.  Jamie counted and there was about $470.  Jamie was so happy, she almost had tears in her eyes.  After Jamie picked toys as gifts for Orphans, Landon and Jamie went to the orphanage together.  Landon gave Jamie a present, a new gray sweater, and Jamie gave Landon a present, an old bible that she used to carry.  She explained to him that it was her mom's bible.

0694515302|2.0|If you picked up this book to help you build your existing business or build a new one, you might be disappointed. Since your thinking of starting your own business, then you should know that most small businesses fail within the first five years. The author hits on some reasons why they fail but most of these you already know. Do you know that if you are not organized, if you don't change or create new ideas or plans and become stagnat or if you force yourself to do every task yourself, your business will be limited in growth and may eventually fail? Right there is the first 25% of the book fit into one sentence. Then he goes onto his love affiar with turn key businesses. But when he starts talking about his favorite business it should make a reader nervous. He starts talking about the great sucess of McDonalds fast food restuarant franchise. McDonalds is a great success and one to be looked at carefully but not for the reasons he points out. It's apparent he has not been in a McDonalds all that often. He mentions that at McDonalds they depend on consistancy at all their chains. For example the fries stay in the fryer for ten minutes \\"a soggy french fry is not a McDonald's french fry\\". At any McDonalds a customer knows what to expect. Then he goes into mention that this is why McDonalds chain resturant is more successfull than those businesses that depend on trade name recognition. I'm sorry this throws a red flag. People eat there beacuse it is fast and it is [not expensive}, not becuase of consistant service. They make a large profit because they keep costs down. I do believe that McDonalds spends a large budget on trade name recognition, I have seen many commercials for McDonalds within the last year; particularly with the Olympics. This whole section undermines the rest of the author's book. If you know that a large section is misleading or biased it makes it difficult to listen to the rest the ideas without already being judgemental. I admit that I am not thesmartest business person but its clear Michael Gerber isn't either.
B00001QEE8|5.0|I loved this movie as a child, now my son does.  He has a number of favorites, and this one is at the top of the list.
B00005QK5X|5.0|With this release you get 3 albums, many bonus tracks, liner notes, artwork, etc.  The digital re-mastering was very well done and all 3 discs sound fat and loud.  Thanks to Greg Sage for re-releasing these!!!    About the music... this stuff was completely unlike anything else at the time and really broke new ground.  Today it still stuns me how unique the music is.  The recordings were done on what today would be considered fairly \\"primitive\\" equipment and it's amazing what Sage was able to create in these conditions.  Youth of America, the title track, is a total onslaught of psychotic yet highly musical themes that develops over half an album side.      There are many highlights, I love all three records.  If you have an appreciation for music that is punk, blues, hard rock, psychedelic or the like (the guitars are reminescent of Hendrix at times) do yourself a favor and pick this up, you won't regret it.
B000002GQE|5.0|In this day of cacophonous, dissonant music, it's comforting to know that the Moody Blues are there for us.  There's no explaining their music.  You listen and you know; and you understand.
B000059MEK|2.0|I'm a massive fan of Daft Punk and dance music as a whole and Daft Punk's debut album is a totally awesome piece of work. This long-awaited follow-up, though, is another story totally.<br />It seems Daft Punk have become one trick ponies, as almost (if not every) track on &quot;Discovery&quot; is the same sort of track with the same tricks used... If it wasn't bad enough that nearly every other dance artist &amp; DJ is making music with robot voices, Daft Punk really take the biscuit by over-using the vocoder to nauseating effect.<br />The same goes for the &quot;stereo phasing&quot; effect - it becomes beyond irritating on this album and becomes less music and more of just unlistenable noise. The overall feel is that of people trying to be technically clever and not giving a toss about the consequences...<br />It's a shame really, as Daft Punk are innovators and have the abilities to make great, original dance music but &quot;Discovery&quot; is a total let-down and has become an album I rarely want to listen to. Also, nothing here beats &quot;Around The World&quot; or &quot;Da Funk&quot;, despite the similarities in tracks such as &quot;One More Time&quot;.<br />Overall, I'm not impressed with this overhyped, over-emulated album. I may be in the minority but I was personally expecting something a lot better and more listenable than this.
B000002GQK|5.0|The unique sounds of the Moody Blues.  I've always been confused by the critics claims of the Moodies' music being pretentious.  Please, don't confuse honestly and truth with dissimulation or ostentation.  Their message is universal and timeless.  Listen; hear with your mind and understand.
B000059XUT|5.0|Truth to say, I really didn't expect to like this feature. I never even saw it in its theatrical run. I finally saw this film when my best friend brought the video over and said \\"you'll love this movie!\\" DUH! Since that fateful night, I've watched this film dozens of times, and it's become one of my all-time favorites. <BR>Now, first off, let's comment on how ground-breaking this film was when released. It was Disney's first foray into computer-animated film, and an undeniable gamble. With a strictly first-class voice cast (Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, etc.,) Disney could have wound up very red-faced if it flopped. With dialogue this well-written, animation this well-executed, voice acting this inspired, there was no way it could lose.<BR>The basic gist of the film is this: Woody(Hanks), is the favorite toy of his owner, Andy. All is well in the world until Andy gets a new toy for his birthday, a Buzz Lightyear(Allen) doll, who doesn't realize he's a toy. Woody gets supremely jealous, then tries to off(!) Buzz, only to have to try to save him when the rest of the toys realize what happened. They form an alliance just get back to Andy's house before the family moves to a new home. During the ensuing adventures, Woody realizes he's at fault, Buzz realizes that he's a toy, and that they are becoming great friends. Oh yeah, and they get back to Andy, too. <BR>There's a great feeling to this film, that of friendship, that pervades it to the end. There's an almost tangible feeling of heart to this film, and that is what makes it great. The transfer to DVD has left the film sparkling like a diamond, with crisp colr and defining contrasts. The sound is all you could want in a DVD release, also, and the really wonderful thing is the entire family will enjoy it and laugh and possibly cry some, too. What more could you want?
B000002GQH|5.0|The Moodies stand apart from the rest of the musical world.  They've never produced huge commercial hits (even though they are very successful)...their music is more than that.  Ironically and sadly, the truth and honesty in their music has always somehow caused the critics to label them as pretentious.  Probably because they stay away from pop (or any) formula and write music that touches the truth in us all.  This is music created for every generation.  Listen, see with your mind and understand.
B00005Y228|5.0|For those of us old enough to remember the infectious (but semi-annoying) &quot;Locomotion&quot; remake Kylie did in the late 80's, it seems as though she just re-appeared after many years hiatus from the music scene.<br />However, she's had a number of albums and massive hits in the UK and Australia (and, for the most part, the rest of the world) and it's good to see her success picking up again stateside.<br />This album is just REALLY good - I was over in London last year when &quot;Can't Get You Out of my Head&quot; was the song that other artists were probably calling &quot;Can't Get You Off of the Charts&quot; I picked up the whole FEVER album and loved it.  While I am not typically into clubby music these days, the songs on this album are refreshing pop/club numbers, and perfectly suited for Kylie's voice and style.<br />Her voice is no Celine, for sure, but songs like &quot;Spinning Around,&quot; &quot;In Your Eyes,&quot; and the title track, &quot;Fever&quot; all have single potential.  I hope that American audiences are open enough to explore more of Kylie's material, because it's really good stuff.  You may also want to check out other singles/albums she's released overseas.. and a GREAT duet she did a couple years ago with Robbie Williams (available on her previous album, on Robbie's album &quot;Sing When You're Winning&quot; and as an import single)..
B00003CXRM|5.0|Subtle and not so subtle metaphor of a movie.  Very interesting and entertaining.
6300215512|5.0|\\"I am big. It is the pictures that got small.\\"<br />\\"No one leaves a star. That's what makes one a star.\\"<br />\\"All right, Mr. De Mille, I'm ready for my close-up.\\"<br />By the former silent movie star  Norma Desmond in  \\"SUNSET BLVD.\\"<br />Billy Wilder's masterpiece is, in my opinion, one of the best examples why cinema can be considered a superior form of art.  The spetacular \\"Sunset Boulevard\\" is here to remember us that sometimes Hollywood's movies can be so amazing that they become larger than life<br />For those who have commited the sin of not watching it yet, I'll try to put it in a nutshell. The narrative is told in flashback by a film-noirish voice of the now dead screenwriter Joe Gillis [Willam Holden]. But the show  here belongs to the legendary silent film star Norma Desmon [Gloria Swanson], who has not worked for several years and now is developing her own script based on the legendary story of `Salome'.  She lives in a reclusive mansion with her butler Max von Mayerling [Eric von Stroheim]. In order to have her script edited by a pro, she puts the writer up at her house. As the movie goes on, they start an obssessive relationship of love and hate and pitty.  In the background there is the film industry with its ephemeral idols and eccentric stars.<br />It seems to me that one of the most insteresting aspect of this film is the interrelationship between life and fantasy. For one, Gloria Swanson, the actress who plays the former silent film star, happens to be a real life former silent movie star. So this part looks very autobiographical. In the same way Norma experienced stardom, so did Gloria, and now, they both are decandent and have been ruled out from the industry due to the talkies. To make things more brilliant, her butler Max von Mayerling --  melancholically played by Eric von Stroheim -- is the the director who discovered and made her into a star at age of 16. [Now, can you guess??] Eric von Stroheim himself used to be a silent movie director and [ I'm pratically at a loss for words] he discovered Gloria.<br />Still talking about the movie itself: there is another pole in the script. Part of the movie happens at the Paramount Studio --which, by the way, produced the movie. There Joe secretly works with the script reader Betty Schaefer, writing an original script that will buy his freedom from Norma. There also is Mr De Mille [playing himself] working, who Norma wants to direct her `Salome'.  These relationships filled with good-intentioned lies and jealousy will lead the characters to their tragedy.<br />The more Joe involves with Norma, the more he sees how she has lost the touch with reality. She lives in a dream world where she is a star with millions of fans begging for her return. She receives letters -- thanks to her devoted butler -- asking for autographed photos. She watches her old movies and she is delighted with them. She meets her friends, former actors, weekly for playing cards. Her friends?  Buster Keaton, Anna Q. Nilson and H. B. Warner. All of them real-life former silent movie stars. Joe calls them `wax woks'. However, what Joe is blind to is how close to Salome's story is his. The metaphor gets clearer and clearer as the movie goes on. Joe doesn't foresee that he will end up with his John the Baptiste's  head on a platter for her.<br />The script penned by Wilder, Charles Braxett and D.M. Marshmam, Jr. is full of memorable moments and lines. Those I gave in the begining of my review are the most famous ones, but there are many unforgettable words. The direction is precise and and effective -- but we couldn't expect less from Wilder. The settings and lightings are fantastic. There is one sequence that is very telling to prove the tecnical and human greatness and beauty of the movie. When Norma is in sound stage 18 at Paramount waiting to talk with Mr De Mille, she is sat at his chair and one boom microphone -- a symbol of sound in Hollywood -- brushes her hat, she pushes away in disgust.But the best moment is when one eletrician focuses a soptlight on her and a crowd of fans conposed of technicians and extras gathers to admire abd pay homage to the age-old star iluminated by the shaft of light.<br />All in all, this is a movie that deserves to be watched the more one can. If you haven't seen it yet, go for it. You haven't the faintest idea of what you are losing. If you have seen this, watch more and more, because every time it gets better and better.st.

B00004YRQA|5.0|This card is the greatest... This card is certified to give you the most updated and quickest way to save and load your games. I heard the MadCatz and Nyko's 8MB memory card are also great, but not as great as Sony's. Some of my friends have them, but it's not quite as good as Sony's. If you buy a Sony 8MB memory card, you have a less of a chance of getting your files lost or corrupted. Plus, if the memory card doesn't work when you just bought it, you can call Sony's customer's service phone line and they'll get you a new one. The other third parties don't have that option. It works great, if Sony just came out with a 16MB memory card, then it will be better than the Sony 8MB memory card.

B000001FN3|3.0|When the opening track (&quot;A Dream Within A Dream&quot;) ended, I was expecting an amazing album.  Unfortunately, that's not what I got.  It could have been marvelous, but parts were just laughable.<br />There are two things to note about this album:<br />1) The music is amazing.<br />2) The vocals are awful.<br />The first track began with Orson Welles reading a work by Poe.  Some noise gradually built up behind his voice.  The voice then left and the noise turned into music.  And the music was really good.  Pink Floyd has a sound that cannot be duplicated, but I could have easily been persuaded that this was a Pink Floyd song.  It has a keyboard playing circular melodies, Gilmour-like guitar work, and an explosion of drums a la Shine On You Crazy Diamond.<br />But then comes the next song, &quot;The Raven,&quot; laden with robot voices and extraordinarily melodramatic vocals.  This and every other song with vocals (except for &quot;The Cask of Amontillado&quot;) is complete garbage.  If you can tolerate the singing, then you will probably love this album.  If you are like me, you will wish that the amazing music was not soiled by the often-tacky voices and robot sounds.
B000002LE6|5.0|\\"Welcome to the New Power Generation . . . the reason why my voice is so clear is because there's no smack on my brain.\\"<br />With those words, Prince kicked off one of the most exhilirating and mesmerizing LP's in recent memory.  Armed with funky bass lines, horn riffs, guitar licks, clever lyrics, and supreme confidence and openness, Prince puts out a new message of spirituality and love.<br />The 9 tracks of Lovesexy are nearly flawless.  I could rave about each of them all day, but a few stand out in my mind.  The first track, \\"Eye No\\" is the perfect marriage of gospel soul and JB's funk, with a clear, terse message of faith (\\"Eye No there is a heaven/eye no there is hell/listen 2 me people/I've got a story to tell/eye no there was confusion lightnin' all around me/that's when I called His name/don't u know he found me.\\")  \\"Alphabet St.\\" is a timeless pop ditty infused with sly sexual inunendo. \\"Dance On\\" features fierce drumming and some great social commentary on drugs and gangs.  The title track is pure joy, with some great synths and horns.  \\"When 2 R in Love,\\" a holdover from the Black Album, is a classic, minimalist Prince \\"slow jam.\\"  As with \\"Sign,\\" Prince explores a wide variety of topics on these tracks, but the pace and flow of the LP tends to bring them all together into one masterpiece.<br />I truly believe that, along with \\"Purple Rain,\\" \\"Sign O' The Times,\\" and \\"1999,\\" this is one of Prince's landmark albums.  Unlike other LP's, Prince is unequivocal about his views on spirituality, and begs the listener to join in on the fun.  He still uses Lovesexy imagery in his current music (\\"New Power Generation,\\" \\"NewPowerSoul\\").  Thematically, the album has endured.<br />Two years after releasing \\"Lovesexy,\\" Prince said of the LP, \\"you either had a mind-blowing experience or you didn't.\\"  Well, I did.  And while I cannot fathom some of the other reviews on this site (James Brown imitations?  \\"Eye No\\" being one of the \\"worst\\" Prince songs?  HUH?), reasonable minds can disagree.  Sure, the album cover isn't the best (I think the LP would have gone platinum with another cover), and the 1-track CD is supremely annoying, but I can live with that.  Hopefully, you will too.  Buy this album.
0812550706|5.0|Many times adults don't stop to think about how mature our children really are.  Ender's Game is a perfect example of the \\"grown-up\\" decisions a child must make whether he is or is not aware of it himself.  Ender Wiggin is a boy; one of extreme intelligence, but still a boy.  He is made to play games in order to become a better soldier in war.  At first it is the game that intrigues him.  He is drawn into the art of winning and learns how to manipulate the game to suit his purpose.  What Ender is not aware of is that the game was never a game.  It was a reality that was hidden from him in order to keep his sanity.  Though Ender runs close to loosing his mind, his fighting spirit won't allow to stop the game.  <br />Orson Card does a magnificent job in creating this adult world for a child to save.  The obstacles Ender must face, as unfair as they may seem, keep the reader spellbound, wondering what Ender will do next.  Ender is the epitamy of the child in every adult that tells us to keep playing, no matter how hard the game gets.  Although there are many times Ender wants to quit, the reader makes him unable to quit.  I was unable to put the book down until I knew what the final outcome of the game would be.  Ender's Game is a wonderfully written book about a young child being forced into an adult world through the use of games.  I would highly recommend this book for young and old minded alike.
B000002J1Y|2.0|Yes a 2 not because I am not a fan of Yes but because the digital remastering is HORRID. If people are praising the sound on this because it's better than the vinyl then the vinyl must have been unlistenable. This is all top end and it seems every instrument is trying to compete at being higher on the scale than Jon's own voice. Nerve racking to say the least. IMHO this is not worth keeping in my changer while I have all the studio remasters which are all keepers.
B00000IAU3|5.0|My sister insisted I get this CD too.  I heard &quot;Thank You&quot; on the radio and admittely her voice is very pretty.  Her voice is solid and strong voice with the smoothness echo-ey beauty of Sarah McLachlan. &quot;Thank You&quot; is my favorite track on the CD for it's beauty of voice and really nice beat background music.  &quot;Here With You&quot; is also an excellent track portraying different vocals skills than &quot;Thank You&quot;.  &quot;Hunter&quot; is wonderful especially lyrically.  The song talks of a queen who gets restless and wants to go out into the world again (hence the hunter in her).  This is a CD worth getting because their isn't another voice like hers: the uniqueness wins me over on this one.  One to add to your music collection if you like collecting great music or great voices.  It should also be noted that at the Brit Awards (England's Grammy equivalent) Dido won Best Female Artist for two years now.  Get this CD or borrow it from a friend to listen to and see what the English already know to be a great singer.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Nothing really needs to be said about this classic British sitcom, except that it contains some of the most brilliant, most hilarious, and most humiliatingly ghastly moments in the entire history of television.<br /><br />And \\"Fawlty Towers Complete Collection\\" brings together the entire series in all its embarrassing avalanchal glory. It's one of those universally funny TV shows, all about the undignified exploits of a perpetually hostile, repressed and tetchy hotel manager, and the more competant staff who try to keep thngs sane, written with demented zeal (\\"That's Brahms! Brahms' Third Racket!\\") and excellent comic acting.<br /><br />Basil (John Cleese) and Sybil Fawlty (Prunella Scales) run a moderately-sized hotel in Torquay, with the assistance of the clever waittress Polly (Connie Booth) and the Spanish waiter Manuel (Andrew Sachs) whose grasp of English is a work in progress. The hotel is home to a dotty old soldier, fluttery spinsters, and a revolving door of very dissatisfied customers.<br /><br />Basil Fawlty (Cleese) puts out a snotty ad to attract a \\"better class of customer,\\" which attracts a pleasant aristocrat. Basil fawns revoltingly over the man, neglecting the other guests. But savvy waittress Polly (Connie Booth) discovers that another guest (who Basil snubs because he's Cockney) is a member of the CID -- and that Basil is in danger of handing his valuable coins over to a con man.<br /><br />And it's not the last disaster that Basil only manages to make much worse: an inept gang of builders are called in while Sybil is away; a bunch of couples seem to be cheating on one another; four Germans arrive at the hotel just in time for Basil to suffer a brain-scrambling head injury; a deaf woman causes general hotel mayhem; and the creme-de-la-creme of Torquay society arrive for a \\"Goumet Night,\\" just in time for the chef to get drunk after Manuel rejects his advances. Hilarity (and roast ducks) ensue.<br /><br />An American tourist who demands a Waldorf salad -- after the cook leaves for the day -- ends up tangled in Basil's web of lies; an overnight guest expires in bed, leading to a frantic cover-up; an anniversary party is wrecked when Sybil storms out just as the guests arrive. And after a health inspector condemns Fawlty Towers, Basil discovers that Manuel has a pet rat (\\"Is Siberian hamster -- a filagree!\\") -- which is soon running wild through the hotel.<br /><br />Anyone who's sick of the recycled sitcoms (\\"Hot Young Urbanites Fall In Love and Have Misadventures\\") that pepper the TV landscape every single season might want to try \\"Fawlty Towers\\" -- the humour is still fresh, the writing is hilarious (\\"If the guest isn't singing 'Oh What a Beautiful Morning,' I don't immediately think 'Oh, there's another snuffed it in the night'\\"), and the actors were great at physical comedy.<br /><br />Basically every episode is about a bad situation that Basil makes infinitely worse, until the entire episode is a landslide of lies, offenses and disasters. Each episode is full of gags (Basil strangling the gnome), misunderstandings (\\"There's a kipper sticking out of your vest\\"), and plots that revolve mainly around Basil's increasingly frantic efforts to keep everything \\"normal.\\" Everything gets crazier as the episodes wind on.<br /><br />And Cleese's writing is typically brilliant here -- Basil gets most of the great lines (\\"Always reminds me of somebody machine-gunning a seal\\"\\") but there are some glorious bits of dialogue from others (\\"Will you stop talking about the war?\\" \\"Me? You started it!\\" \\"We did not start it!\\" \\"Yes you did -- you invaded Poland!\\").<br /><br />Cleese plays Basil as a slightly deranged, high-strung, incompetent guy who treats his customers like so many itchy spots, and Prunella Scales serves as the more competent, vaguely contemptuous counterpoint to him. Connie Booth's Polly is the only truly smart and clever person in the entire hotel, and usually gets sucked into Basil's freaky schemes (\\"Flying Tart!\\"); and Andrew Sachs is rather cute and sweet as the much-abused Manuel, whose half-learned English provides quite a bit of humor (\\"I am from Barcelona!\\").<br /><br />The new edition may be worth the dip for fanatical Fawlty fans -- apparently the entire series is being restored. Additionally, Cleese has gone back to record commentaries for ALL the episodes, and there are interviews with everybody in the main cast. Sounds like it's going to be good.<br /><br />\\"Fawlty Towers Complete Collection\\"  is one of those shows that shone brightly and briefly, like a fireworks display.

B000002N3N|5.0|I heard this CD at a friends and when track 4 Athear Neamh came all it was breathtaking.  The clarity of voice and the beautiful smoothness bluesy oboe-like flutey vocal range is gorgeous.  I mentioned it to my friend and she said this is her favorite Enya CD.  Admittedly I got the CD just for the one track and I'm not sorry.  This remains one of the best in my collection of great songs and I can record it alongside other greats e.g. Dean Martin or The Carpenters and Enya measures up.  My husband and I also picked out China Roses as a good track.  Rarely does one finds a CD where just the one astounding track is worth the price of an entire CD, but this is one of those jewels.
B00005RFAI|5.0|I wouldn't have called myself a PINK fan last year. But after \\"Get this party started\\" came out, and the Moulin Rouge soundtrack, I took notice. I just got this CD today and I've listened to it 3 times already. It's fantastic. A mixture of blues, rock, rap. She has a sexy and balanced voice that just works! I bought my CD used and it works great - what a great idea.
B00005K3O4|5.0|Browsing around the video store, I ran across Killer Klowns From Outer Space.  A first rate second rate movie, Killer Klowns holds the fifties B-ness in the eighties hip-ness and everybody loves a clown, so why worry about these guys except they are cocooning the townspeople in cotton candy to store on their spaceship and drinking their essence with large silly straws.  Other than that, the townspeople who pause to watch a shadow puppet show put on by a Klown-on-the-street are being eaten by the caricatures transformed on the building wall and godzilla makes a cameo.     The Killer females of the species stowed on the lower deck don't mind galaxy-hopping and meeting aliens, in this case earthlings nosing around the ship.  They perk right up after the earthlings slide into their lair, appreciating the company and a smile different from their jagged-toothed boyfriends.     This movie isn't really scarey.  Killer Klowns From Outer Space is just slapstick science fiction so there's nothing to worry about... unless you've got a clown on a rocking chair in your bedroom... and the smile is beginning to turn upside down...
B00005R87Q|4.0|Think of this movie as a true race car - it forgoes luxuries like plot and acting in favor of pure speed and excitement.  The car chases and drag races in this movie are the best I've seen since \\"The Road Warrior\\", and this film will go down as one of the best car movies in history.  It does an excellent job of capturing the underground street-racing scene, too.  There actually is a \\"club\\" of kids who race their rice rockets late at night when the cops are sleeping, and their culture is fascinating.  They probably exist in your city and you don't even know it.  <br />The paper-thin plot basically follows an undercover cop who befriends the same man he is supposed to arrest.  Throw in some awesome cars and you have this movie.  I didn't enjoy the squeeky-clean shine that the filmmakers put on everything - every car in the film is waxed with a $5000 tape job, and whenever the racers drive anywhere they drive in perfect synchronization, like ballet or something, and it looks stupid.  All the girls are sexy and thinly clad, the lead actors were obviously choosen for their looks rather than their rather poor acting ability.  The dialog is boring, and the performances are universally dead-pan and boring.  So what.  The action scenes are hot.  This film actually puts the actors in the cars and hanging off of trucks going 70 mph.  The drag races actually manage to turn what is essencially a short, visually boring event into pure excitement, reminiscent of The Matrix and other modern films.  You can't read about it, you just have to see it.<br />THE DVD - the extras on this DVD are the best I've ever seen.  You won't find documentary overkill here, just a few great little features that are very effective in helping you understand the film.  The clip on editing shows how the director cut some gory footage to achieve a PG-13 rating (and increase the film's take by $100 mil), while a visual effects montage combines storyboard clips with bluescreen shots and final footage in a way that is infinitely better than those boring storyboard stills every other DVD forces you to wade through.  The \\"Making of\\" documentary is interesting, because of the unique way in which the action scenes were shot and how the REAL racing culture in LA affected this movie.  Finally, the audio commentary is informative, but the director's voice puts me to sleep.  The audio/video quality of the transfer is excellent.  A good dvd.
B00003CXI1|5.0|Oh my word! This is, without a doubt...the BEST movie i have evr seen! It was sooo great!I really liked how it showed that it is easy to make people feel welcome, especially the 1st years when the older students greeted them when they came in. I thought the two BEST parts in the movie were when Ron says \\"That was bloody brillant!\\"....my friend and i LOVE that saying now!...and the part where the troll attacks....(To my friend...We love u troll....lol!) ...even though it must have been awful for poor Hermione! My favourite characters are troll, fluffy, Harry, Ron, and Hermione! In general...this was the most BLOODY BRILLANT movie I have ever seen! ***** all the way! GO TROLL!....LOL!<br />~Hermione (my nickname! Hehe!)
6305165912|5.0|Please do not hold fargo against \\"the big lebowski\\".  This movie is extremely entertaining.  You'll never find a movie with more memorable quotes; the dialogue alone is worth the price.  The plot is slightly convoluted, but if you are concentrating on the plot you're missing the point!  I've seen this movie many times now and I still love it.  It is everything Fargo wasn't! Remember: The bums will always lose.
B0000640VN|5.0|He turns a character that could have been an English fop flop into a chivalrous romantic lead.  Whatever happened to the scene of Hugh in the bath tub, though?  The scene made the trailers, but not the final cut.  What a shame.  I was beginning to thing it was a Hugh Jackman \\"thing\\" to give us a little pectoral peep in his films.  Remember X-men, Swordfish, and Someone Like You?  Heck, even Paperback Hero, I think.  Oh well...maybe X-men 2 will make up for it.<br />Oh, and the story was sweet.<br />Hugh, take your shirt off!  ;)
B000002TQV|5.0|Since the Bends turned Radiohead into one of the world's preeminent rock bands, the band has moved away from the more traditional song structures featured on The Bends in favor of new ways to express their themes of alienation, isolation, and seething rage.  <br />But the Bends is still Radiohead's best work, and for obvious reasons.  Epic in scope without being self-indulgent, The Bends takes the distorted guitars of grunge and adds a sense of melodrama and good old rock-n-roll majesty that, at that time, had been missing from popular music for almost two decades.  In blending the two together, along with adding their own distinctly British personality, Radiohead makes The Bends a landmark recording that still feels fresh today seven years after its initial release.<br />The record has that wonderful touch of arrogance that transforms the band from one-hit brooders (as on \\"Creep\\") to bonafide rock gods.  The guitars on the opening \\"Planet Telex\\" thunder in, heralding the band's arrival to the rock stratosphere, and the album just goes and goes from there.  Every song works, be it balls out rock songs (\\"Bones\\"), or quieter, ghostly pieces (\\"Street Spirit,\\" \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\").  All of it is tied together by lead singer Thom Yorke's voice.  Credit Yorke with somehow making a voice that should, by all accounts, be incredibly irritating resonate and echo in the mind of the listener.  It's alternately haunting, raging, and powerful; even making the transition from gentle lullabying to Billy Idol-quality snarling in the course of a single song (\\"Nice Dream\\").  It's a wonderful performance, and the band underneath matches him note for note.<br />Radiohead has released records more complex (OK Computer), more challenging (Kid A), and more ambiguous (Amnesiac) than The Bends.  But they've never made a better record.  And, in a way, that's a good thing.  Free from the burden of having to create their rock masterpiece (which this is), they've branched out in new directionsto see how far they can push the outer limits of both their music and their collective psyche.  It is that later work that makes Radiohead one of the world's most important bands, but it is The Bends that makes them [behind] kicking rock stars.  And everybody loves the latter.
B000003TA4|4.0|I first heard bits from this album back when it first came out and I loathed it. It seemed formless to me, and I was into much, MUCH more experimental bands like Mr. Bungle, and I thought, \\"I've heard enough. Get it away from me.\\"<br />The fact that it became so annoyingly trendy only made it worse, and I avoided it like the plague.<br />It would seem that I have a thing for investigating certain staples of pop culture ten years after their watershed trendiness has evaporated when I can enjoy them without feeling like they're being rammed down my throat. Musically, this also occured to me concerning the Guns N' Roses recordings...P>At first listen, it was every bit as grating as I remembered. But then I gave it a couple more spins and listened more closely. Ten years later, it's obvious why this album became such a huge hit. Sure, it sounded different for the Top 10 at the time--that's a given. But when you strip away all the wild, monotonous-at-first sounding loudness which on a first hearing gives the impression of often being on the verge of sheer white noise, these songs are ***NOT*** \\"grunge\\" songs: they're Top 10 pop songs performed in a grunge style. Create a completely different musical production for them and they would sound every bit as melodic as a Beach Boys tune.<br />Perfect examples of this fact are \\"In Bloom\\", \\"Come As You Are\\" and ESPECIALLY \\"Lithium\\". The melodies in the songwriting are far too deeply buried in thrashing to be noticed right off the bat, but they ARE there.<br />A side note: don't expect the copy you buy to necessarily contain the much-ballyhooed \\"secret song\\". This extra track appears on random discs (a mistake as has been claimed, or just mere shrewdness to get people to buy more than one copy searching for it?), and the only way you can tell for sure if you are getting one with the extra music is to either have a store clerk open it for you to check it out first or to buy the now out-of-print gold CD pressing.<br />Oh yeah, andthis CD is also not necessarily as \\"negative\\" as you'd be led to believe: in \\"Territorial Pissings\\" for example, you might at first think of the tune as a rant against the hippies with its sarcastic singing of \\"Smile on your brother, everybody get it together, learn to love one another right now\\"... but when you listen to the lyrics and hear Cobain insisting that we've \\"GOT to find another way\\", you can see he's simply pointing out that the hippies didn't provide the answer as much as they had hoped, that another ideology and different approach is needed to be tried instead. This is a sentiment also expressed by Paul McCartney on his closing song for \\"Off The Ground\\" in his desire to help his listeners \\"get it right this time.\\" That's not negativity, nor is it a rant against the previous generations. It's simply pointing out the urgency for another and better attempt to correct life, and that's not a negative statement. In fact, it's downright positive and encouraging, and also every bit as much in the spirit in what the hippies themselves tried. (As Bowie once sang, \\"Same old thing in brand new drag.\\")<br />This one will grow on you. It's not a perfect listen and actually tends to sound far too commercial for the more artistically adventurous ear even for the time it was released in, but it never insults your intelligence--in fact, in it's own loud and confoundingly sloppy way it is every bit as beautiful as John Lennon's \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" album, certainly performed the same way and with the same primal scream lyrics.<br />Give it a try, and be sure to at least give it a handful of listenings before you give it your final verdict. There's something happening here.
B00003CXPJ|2.0|Zoolander is basically good for a few chuckles, but I have no idea how it has a 4 star rating right now.
B000002LVB|5.0|Although Doug Yule would futilely continue on and attempt to use the name he did not have a hand in creating, this is the last Velvets album since Lou=Velvets(not to slight any of the other stellar artists in that band)and that is that. With Loaded, Lou gives us the record he logically should have given us in 1967 as it would have insured their commercial success...which Im sure they would have squandered anyway because they were antipathetic to the music listening populace. We are no less glad that The Velvets were iconoclasts, nevertheless...in the end, they showed everyone that they could play and when they did it was good. You have two hands down rock classics in &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll&quot;( and I am going to say something music snobbish here, if you havent heard these, you have work to do!) and the rest of the record, maybe with the exception of &quot;Lonesome Cowboy Bill&quot;, is a blast too. Amazing long closer at the end-&quot;Oh!Sweet Nuthin&quot; rivals &quot;The End&quot; on the Beatles' Abbey Road for Best Song To End A Career With.
0446677450|4.0|I think Rich Dad Poor Dad was written very well and he gives great examples on how to become financially literate.  I like how he went from the stories of when he was a little kid to a adult.  I also like how he reiterates his points throughout the book.  I wish he would have gone into more details in some areas but as a whole it was very good.
B000002KHH|5.0|What an album, Heavy Metal at its best(at that time and a long time following it). Nothing at this time sounded like this. Not even their first album was this heavy.Every song on this album is killer. Even the instrumental,which unlike others, is not at all boring. I read that somebody said it is a filler...What the...is he on. If hes not on anything he has no sense in music at all. Planet Caravan is an awesome trippe(?)song. Ozzy voice sounds so cool, and the music goes right with it. The guy who rated the songs in his reveiw did ok. Except every song on this album is 100% and nothing less.He rated Planet Caravan with a 95% and rat salad with an 80%.Come on dude you sound like ytou have more sense than that. Wouldn't you think(as that guy described)since planet caravan is so dark and cool it would be 100%...War Pigs has some of the coolest lyrics ever. Iron man and paranoid lyrics are cool too. Electric Funeral is probaly my favorite song. It is so dark and cool and I love how they change it up in the middle of it. Hand of Doom is also a Favorite. it is a great slow song that greats an awesome speed up. Rat salad i love as well as Faries Wear Boots. PLanet Caravan is such an awesome song. The others I am sure you know. Dont listen to the bad reviews or even the four star reviews. This album, out of a scale from 1 to 5, is a definite 7. This is must have for a music fan. I highly recommend Master Of Reality which is a little heavier and better than Paranoid.  If you don't have this album already buy it now.
0613177312|4.0|I read this book when I was a young teen and I like it still as a good indication of Stephen King's still developing talent when it was written.  I only hope that this work doesn't share the same fate following 09/11/01 that The Rage did following Columbine.
1573226521|2.0|This book was nothing more than a drug-lovers novel written for crack-addicted hippies all over.  Murder, lies, law-breaking and sex are common place, making a horrifying, yet strangely realistic story.  A romantic eden collapses into hell, during which the characters minds develop towards insanity and memories that will never be forgotten... never judge a book by it's movie or those that star in it, horribly misleading.  I watched the movie before I read the book and it gave me terrible preconceptions about the book, which eventually were proven untrue.
044651652X|5.0|Tremendous love story told with a philosophy seldom found in a novel.  It is not just the telling of two people meeting in the summer in Iowa, but it is the summation of two unfilled dreams.  They were not to be, but they were good dreams.
B00005221M|5.0|This review is for those who have the VHS version and have hesitated to by the directors cut on cd because of some rather precautionary reviews done here at this site. I just bought the cd (having really admired and enjoyed the VHS version) and I can simply say that the cd version is slightly different but every bit as entertaining as the 'original'. The added scenes are nicely done, but are short and DO NOT hurt the flow of the film. As to the loss of a short piece of vocal music that was deleted and is disparagingly remarked upon in earlier review: I found the deletion of what was an obvious plant of a commercial song (probably a studio attempt to help promote the commercialism of the soundtrack) to be an improvement. Great flick on either VHS or cd. Get it.
B000002UAX|5.0|You can't argue that the Beatles were the greatest band to ever set foot in a studio. Not only did they change music as we hear it, but they were able to make songs that you could enjoy over and over again with out getting tried of it. The White Album expresses this. Starting with the being and to the end. You get a fulfillment of great songs that you want to groove your head to. Every song is just absoulty great, it's a perfect ablum; thats hard to do, but then again the Beatles made a quite few more perfect albums. Enjoy this album, because it is highly underrated by a lot of critics when we all know as fans that this album add more class to rock and roll than any other album on the market. Notice that the White Album also had no number 1 hits, but too many it is still considered the greatest Beatles Album of All Time.
0316776963|5.0|Sedaris will have you laughing out loud.  This is pure satire from a gifted mind.  I read this on the airplane recently and I completely forgot to be nervous or afraid.  I was laughing so hard, I had to run to that tiny bathroom. Other passengers must have wondered if I was on drugs... It's just  that funny.
B000001EUL|5.0|First off, after reading several of these reviews, I suddenly feel old. This album was truly exceptional, as was the tour that followed. I saw them at The Aragon in Chicago in 1979, and was totally blown away. Sammy Hagar was the opening act. Michael Schenker's return from UFO was definitely a highlight, and his work on songs like Coast to Coast and Lovedrive is awesome as usual. As my title says, Lovedrive truly propelled The Scorpions into the U.S heavy metal mainstream. I own all of their previous albms as well, and they had already made it big in Japan. If you get a chance, check out &quot;Fly to the Rainbow&quot;, and you'll hear 18 year old Michael Schenker jamming with Uli Roth, in yet another classic work by The Scorpions. Oh for the carefree days of High School, hangin out and rockin to Lovedrive
B000062Y98|5.0|This album is perfect.  That's about all i have to say.  It exceeds my high expectations for a follow up after Nightfall in Middle-Earth.
0345440900|5.0|A great , easy read for tired Mommys. Simple, gentle and easy to understand for first time Mum's with no baby experience. I read this when my son was one year old (March 2002) and after ten years as a professional Nanny I found the book was a great reasurance that all was well in our little world and I also found it to be full of wonderful tips to refine my skills in baby comunication . This was the first book that I found that actually shared my own thoughts on caring for Baby and put them nicely into words. If you read it with your heart you will hear and see your amazing baby in a whole new way. Invaluable.
1568497369|5.0|This is a good book. Like all of Christie's books, it captures the reader's attention. It makes the reader want to read more and find out what happens in each chapter.

B00003CXXP|2.0|If I were to rate the first Act of A.I., I would have given it 4 stars. This act was the only place in A.I. that Stanley Kubrick had obviously influenced.  If Kubrick had any influence on the rest of the movie then it doesn't show.<br />The Prologue (where William Hurts character is proposing the new form of A.I.) is similar to such prologues from Paths of Glory and The Shining. A scene where no action occurs, but the ideas presented are what draws the viewer into the story line.  <br />I thought the first Act was amazing. Kubrick's adult content shows through Speilberg's childish method of filming and scriptwriting. Unfortunately, there wasn't any credibility or coherency for the rest of the film. When Davie reaches &quot;The End of the World&quot;, where does Gigolo Joe, and Teddy go? Then William Hurts character arrives (for no good narrative reason) only to disappear for no reason. Then Gigolo Joe returns. Where the hell has he been?  Was he off exploring for himself? More importantly what was Gigolo Joe's purpose for this film? What's the purpose of having a &quot;love&quot; bot in this film? Couldn't it have been any other type of robot? Speilberg's script offers no answers for these questions. Obviously, Stanley Kubrick wanted a robot that was programmed to love gets attached to a robot that programmed to &quot;love&quot;. This use of the word &quot;love&quot; would create questions like &quot;what is love, co-dependency, lust, and selfishness&quot;. A.I. starts these ideas, but it never finishes them.  <br />The end of Act three would have been a good place to end the movie. Instead we had to endure the forth Act.  Most movies don't have a forth act. Coincidentally, 2001: A Space Odyssey does. Was Spielberg trying to achieve the same type of ending as 2001? They are similar in that both movies go on a journey only to come back to a familiar place.  (This is also what Carl Sagan's Contact did) I suppose there is a possibility that a forth act could have worked, but this one didn't. Without going into too much detail, but the ending had no credibility, it dragged on, it was superficial, and it served no narrative purpose other than to give a happy ending. And why do these beings have the capability to bring back the mom for 24 hours, but not more time? Why just 24 hours? Does that make any sense to anyone out there? These super-beings also reminded me of Mr. DNA from Jurassic Park. Teddy says: &quot;I have a piece of Mommy's hair&quot; and the super-being should have said: &quot;BINGO! Instant Mommy DNA!&quot; Perhaps then they could have opened HUMAN PARK and then the movie could have truly dragged on forever torturing us all.<br />Finally, If someone could bring Stanley Kubrick back for 24 hours, would he watch A.I. and be happy?
B00004XQ83|5.0|This is great. I'm listening t right now as I rght this review. It has some old 'old time religious' music back in Grandmas younger day. Even has &quot;I am a man of constant sorrow&quot; twice. Well...three times if you count the instrumental version. And the movie is just as good if not better. This CD is an enhanced CD by the way.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Well, it's not really a review. I would just like to say that anyone that considers this just noise, and not music, must have a very slow mind. I'm not trying to insult anyone specifically, but for such a great thrash record, it sure has a lot of 1 star ratings from some of the worlds biggest boneheads. Every song sounds the same? Sounds like something a metal virgin would say!! It's a classic, regardless of what some 12 year-olds say.

B00005QATY|5.0|What can I say. The title of this here review says it all really.<BR>But you'll have to watch it twice to fully understand it. There are some parts that you need to pay close attention to. You need to get thesoundtrack for it as well. There's some really good 'old time religious' music on there. as well as &quot;I am a man of constant sorrow&quot;. Which, by the way, I am listening to now.
B000002UCN|4.0|Wow, i've read some real stuffy overblown reviews of this cd right here. For the most part i have grown immune to the Beatles as they are and have been played for years. I am still stunned by the classics and I give both McCartney and Lennon all they are due. Harrison seemed to be always a sideshow. If i purchased this cd it was for one hit, &quot;You&quot;! I could care less about the criticism of the simple melody and i could care less about all this analysis from people who really dont &quot;get&quot; music and the artists simple translations of thought to music and lyrics. &quot;You&quot; says something to me about somebody I knew once and still know, it's to the point and it means alot to me, really simple. Alot of other Harrison standards are on the disc too. Get off your high horse, drop the cash and pick it up, seeing that George is taking a dirt nap right now im sure he'd appreciate.<BR>it.
B000062Y98|5.0|The closing track on this CD is enough to warrant buying it. The song is truely amazing. The fact that the song runs 14 minutes and repeats the chorus only three times is astounding. The song may be 14 minutes, but it doesn't feel that way, it's not an experience like Peter Frampton, the song flows by and is incredibly enjoyable. Other stand out tracks include: The Soulforged, Battlefield, and Precious Jerusalem. There are no bad tracks. If you liked Nightfall in Middlearth then this album is a must, but if you cannot be pried away from Blind Guardian's very old heavy sound then you may not enjoy it the way I did. If you've not yet heard Blind Guardian then this is a good album to start with.

B00002E224|5.0|Doesn't everybody at sometime want this?  It's a sweet memory in the making, the story that you will tell your friends/lovers for decades to come (and it will get better with age).  It is perfect in its brevity. Both characters know that they will go back to their lives, probably never see each other again, and want to hold onto the moment.<br />I stumbled upon this film on dish, and I was not immediately drawn in as I was not too familiar with the actors, but it grows on you.  It is hard not to imagine yourself in the same situation.
B00005Y228|5.0|I've read the mixture of reviews for this album, and I think what is important to understand about this album is that the 'sameness' of sound that some reviewers have complained about is really its strength: 'consistency'.  Kylie has fashioned an album with a distinctive sound, and that sound follows through on every single cut.  And it's an infectious sound - it's impossible not to dance when this album is playing.  I love it.  If you like synth-pop, eighties (yet technologically modern) dance music, you can't go wrong here.  And, as far as Kylie's voice is concerned - I do actually think she is a better singer than this album might suggest.  But 'Fever' is more about the audio environment being created, than it is about showing off the technical merits of Kylie's voice.  Her voice becomes part of the soundscape rather than being featured up-front.  I wish more artists would concept their work as fully as Kylie has done here. Get on down, Kylie!
B000002J09|5.0|im sorry this is not going to be a particularly great review.  i thought this was my fave. led zeppelin album until i heard 'ii'.  sorry i wasn't really born at the time so im a bit behind!  i decided to go with 'iv' first obviously cos it had 'stairway to heaven'.  but the whole album is great!  'misty mountain hop' is one of my favourite dance around stoned songs!  we all know jimmy page is a great guitarist and the solo in 'stairway to heaven' is pretty orgasmic as solos go.  but i should not leave out robert plant either!  one of the greatest vocalists in the world who has influenced many people.  although he never hit the same heights again after led zeppelin.  i still feel that it was jeff beck who started the whole heavy rock of the time with his 1st release a year before zep's.  but still this is for sure one of the greatest albums of all time, which kinda shows as i own it and wasn't born when led zeppelin first started... great albums always live on!  anyway you all know what they are about so just buy if for whatever reason you dont already own it.
0452282152|5.0|This book not only gives life, albeit fictional, to the artist Vermeer and to his well known portrait, it also brings the reader into a delightful story of a young woman in Delft whose family has fallen on hard times which seems to redirect her entire life as she is forced to become a maid.  The triumph in the story is her ability to take on this new role, but not successfully enough to give up her dignity and self esteem.  I found it also to be a marvelous illustration of the passion one can fuel with imagination as a young woman, and the reality one finds with age.
B00005JKQX|5.0|First off, I have to admit that I wasn't originally excited to see a movie that runs for over 2 hours about a mathematician. I guess I just wasn't in the mood. But after seeing the movie, I was so glad I did!. What a movie!. What performances!. It was easily my favorite movie I had seen this past year. Okay, on with the movie. Russell Crowe plays John Forbes Nash Jr., a brilliant mathematician who first began at Princeton University, where he created an incredible economic theory. This got him a MIT professorship as well. But then came a horrible down side. Nash was diagnosed with schizophrenia. The disease made Nash become delusional. Through all this, he did win the Nobel Prize too. The delusion part of Nash's life is what Howard really goes for here in the film. He really gives you a look at the disease and of any mental health problems that hasn't really been done before on the big screen. He did it perfectly with no flaws at all. Mr. Crowe. What can I say?. I have to admit that I'm not a fan of his, but I do respect his work and think he is one of our greatest actors we have working today. He is tremendous. You have never really seen a performance like this before. If you say you have and that it's cliched, as I know some of you out there have, you just didn't get it. Crowe's performance is downright astonishing. Your not watching Crowe. You are watching John Nash. If he doesn't win the Oscar for this, well, then there is no need for the academy to go on. He deserves it for this. He really didn't for \\"Gladiator\\". And then there is the lovely and brilliant Jennifer Connelly. She holds her own up against Crowe, and that is no easy task. It only shows you how remarkable she is. I never would have suspected her to be in this kind of acclaim when I saw her in her ealier career(Labryinth, Seven Minutes In Heaven, The Rocketeer, Suspiria). She really is worthy of all the attention. The supporting actors are all great. Christopher Plummer, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg,and even Judd Hirsch. The music by James Horner is perfect for this film. Many people bash it as 'sappy' and 'cliched'. Oh please. This movie is great filmmaking. The acting is the best that we could possibly hope for. Anybody who doesn't see that, or has to ridicule because it left out some elements from the book, need to relax. Get over it. What it all comes down too people, is that this is a love story. Alicia Nash stayed with John through all of the hell. Today, they are in their 70's, and they are still very much together. Nothing is more powerful than that. How wonderful. A Beautiful Mind is a beautiful movie. It rekindles your faith in filmmaking. Come Oscar time, if there aren't any gold statues with this film's title on them, it will be a huge upset. Go see this movie. You will fell better afterwards knowing that you did. What a treat. Thank you Ron Howard.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road makes a great case for being the best Beatles album, not only songwise, but in production and overall effect. While they arguably reached the peak of their songwriting with the White Album - or even Revolver - Abbey Road is an immaculately crafted album that is the obvious blueprint for almost every epic album that has come since. It's no exaggeration to say that this was the first album of the modern rock era. Though Sgt. Pepper was an amazingly pionerring effort, Abbey Road, with its sidelong medling of disparate songs creates an amazing run through absolutely immaculate songwriting - clearly laying the groundwork for Pink Floyd's 1973 masterwork, Dark Side of The Moon. Individually, it contains some of the Beatles best songs: John Lennon's socially-conscious monster, Come Together (complete with a killer bassline from Paul); the masterful I Want You (She's So Heavy), complete with a long, crushing guitar coda that is an obvious forerunner of heavy metal; You Never Give Me Your Money, which transforms from a delicate piano intro to a furious rocker; and others. George Harrison had also clearly blossomed into a songwriter on (or very nearly on) the level of John and Paul, and he contributes two of his best pieces ever here: the immaculate love song, Something, and the delicately beautiful, Here Comes The Sun. However, the clear highlight of this album is the long medley that takes up most of the second half of the album. Forging a seamless transition between disparate styles, this was a highly great and incredibly influential maneuver for the band to undertake. However, it's the production all through the album that makes it great. For the first time, George and the boys had 8 tracks to work with, and they used them to full advantage. Martin certainly deserves high praise for his production work on this album, including engineering the medley, and the great orchestrations. As this was the last album the Beatles recorded together, it is a fitting swan song. The last vestiges of their teamwork are here - the beautiful harmonies on Because; the excellent basslines that Paul contributed to the other's songs (Lennon's Come Together and Harrison's Something; and on and on. Although we all mourn the loss of the first of the Great bands, and perhaps the greatest and most influential of all-time, at least they saw fit to closer their career - and the 1960's - with this wonderful swan song, their masterpiece.
B000021Y77|5.0|I'll just cut to the chase. It's in German, it's subtitled, and you'll do yourself a disservice by not reading on. Run Lola Run is the hippest, most original thriller since The Matrix. <br />Remember how everyone, including myself, was so amazed by the fact that 1999's hit The Blair Witch Project cost so little to make? Here's another fact: Germans, like most Europeans, have never had the luxury of a big budget. Indeed, the reason they don't make films like The Matrix is because they can't afford to. The other side of the coin is that they have learned to be exceptionally inventive. It's a shame their movies don't have much of an audience here, and I generally believe that subtitles are a problem. Ironically, Hollywood makes half it's money overseas, and in all non-English speaking territories, our movies are dubbed. That's why you can listen to a DVD movie in French or Spanish, if you care to. These are simply the soundtracks from the foreign releases. <br />Luckily for us, Run Lola Run is almost entirely a visual experience, with a storyline so simple that complex dialog isn't necessary. The throbbing techno-industrial music is a key to the enjoyment of the movie, but these sounds are universal. <br />How's this for simple? Lola gets a phone call from her boyfriend, Manni. A drug deal has gone horribly wrong [I won't tell you how!], and if she doesn't get a large sum of money to him in twenty minutes, he's a dead man. So Lola runs - literally - to try and get the money. In a plot device so clever you will simply have to see it for yourself, Lola gets not one but three tries of twenty minutes each to successfully complete her task. Each attempt starts out in exactly the same way, but because of the way small things occur as she is running down the stairway of her apartment building, there are three different outcomes. All of them are startling and unexpected. It is left to each viewer to decide which outcome they prefer. <br />The acting is uniformly excellent, from the two leads down to the smallest roles. As Lola, Franica Potente has an intensity and an energy level that is almost exhausting. Of course, she must have run a thousand or so miles to prepare for this very physical role. Moritz Bleibtreu is perfect as Manni. He is utterly believable as a guy who gets himself in a situation which is at once scary, because if the consequences and hilarious, because it is caused by the silliest of mistakes. <br />Writer and director Tom Tykwer is a major new force behind the camera. Like many Europeans before him, the success of this movie may lure him to the bright lights and big budgets of Hollywood. Even if he refuses the call, which might be a wise decision, his is the kind of inventive moviemaking that will be copied over and over again anyway. And why not? Herr Tykwer's cinematic tricks are well worth repeating.
0385505833|5.0|If you're looking for a &quot;regular&quot; John Grisham book here, it's not what you'd expect.  But it is still well-crafted as only he can do.  It takes a lot to make me laugh and by the middle of the book I was laughing so hard I had to suppress it so as not to wake my husband asleep next to me.  I meant to take this with us while we celebrated Christmas and New Year's on the beaches of Mexico (yes, celebrate and vacation at once) and forgot to take it along. I got to it now in March and recommend it to anyone who needs a lift of spirits and/or a little perspective on the mostly chaotic Christmas season.  Worth the read!
0780628551|3.0|When The Astronaut's Wife landed in theaters, it didn't take off. In fact, it appeared to fall off the distributor's launch pad. I can see why. It has a fatal flaw which denyed its having much commercial or critical success, but I feel that what's good about it is that it tries very hard to overcome this problem. <br />Juliann and Spencer Armacut [Charleze Theron and Johnny Depp] are a married couple who are still madly in love. He's an astronaut, and she's a grammar school teacher. Except for his exotic profession, they could be a typical couple. Naturally, she worries about him, and her worst fears almost come true when there is an accident aboard a space shuttle. Spencer and a fellow astronaut are outside the craft repairing something when they are suddenly cut loose. For two agonizing minutes, they float helplessly in space. The rest of the crew manages to rescue them. Back on Earth, both men are hospitalized for a short while. It doesn't take very long for the two men's wives to figure out that their husbands are somehow different. Very different, as it turns out. These changes are not for the better.<br />The movie is beautifully photographed. One scene in particular is brilliant. After the accident, the wives are rushed to NASA headquarters. There, Juliann stands in front of a huge television. A camera in the nose of the shuttle shows its approach for landing. It is as though Juliann were landing with the craft. The set designs are also good. In the beginning, all the sets are cozy and warm. When the couple moves to New York afterwards the incident, the sets are vast and cool and elegant. And somehow as empty as space itself.<br />I have long felt that Johnny Depp is the best physical actor on the screen today. He has an otherworldly quality about him to begin with, and so he does not do as well as some other performers in the emotional sense. He builds his characters by body language. Charleze Theron is one of the most promising, as well as beautiful, youngactresses around. She does her best work through her emotions. I think that, as a screen couple, they are an interesting pairing.<br />Naturally, I won't reveal the ending, but I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't say that it is the fatal flaw. It makes The Astronaut's Wife end up like an elaborate joke with a bad punch line. I think the problem a lot of people have had with it is that everything else is crafted so well. This prevents it from being in the category they call Bad Movies We All Love. It is a shame that no one was able to bring the cast and crew back to shoot a different ending. Doing so is not all that uncommon. Many movies have been salvaged this way over the years. One famous example is Sunset Boulevard. The original opening had the unintended effect of causing the preview audiences to roll in the aisles with laughter. A new opening was filmed, and the movie became a hit, not to mention a classic.
6300182266|4.0|I saw it on the Silver Screen(at a USAF base), and yes, it is better than anything Lucas ever dreamed of.<BR>Did Galactica \\"steal\\" anything from Star Wars?  No, just a few SFX. If anything, Galacica is the modern interpretation of events that could have taken place after the Pearl Harbor attack, if it would have occurred at a different place and time.  The TV series, of course, is based on The Seven Samurai, Noah's Ark, Shakespeare, and other tales of storybook heroes and villians.  So as long as you consider the shortcomings of it's \\"Chariots Of The Gods\\" premise, just admit that it is still great entertainment at the expense of network TV at that time.
B00005ATQD|2.0|The two most widely anticipated movies of 1999 were George Lucas' Star Wars 1: The Phantom Menace and Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut. It wasn't hard to predict that both would prove somewhat disappointing, simply because the hype for both pictures went beyond overkill. But Eyes Wide Shut's publicity campaign took a sad and unexpected turn when Kubrick died suddenly... just after completing the film. In the surrealistic circus that was his cinematic life, Kubrick could not have scripted a more dramatic climax to his life. His fanatical fans were no longer in the position of defending only the enigmatic director's latest epic. Now that his life was over, they had to defend the movie's place in his lifetime's body of work. A reviewer at Time magazine proclaimed it \\"Kubrick's final, haunting masterpiece,\\" a phrase latched onto instantly by Time-Warner's gigantic publicity department.<br />All this puts me in the unhappy position of telling my readers where Eyes Wide Shut probably belongs. It's place in Kubrick's legacy might best be summed up by a quote from T. S. Eliot's The Hollow Men: \\"This is the way the world ends....not with a bang, but a whimper.\\" <br />The movie stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, of course. They play Alice and Dr. William Harford, an upper-middle class couple living in London's fashionable West End. One night Alice admits to William that she has had sexual fantasies about a man she met at a party. When he becomes angry over this, she accuses him of hypocrisy. Surely, he has also had fantasies. This fight sends him on an odyssey in which he first takes up with a dead patient's daughter and then with a hooker. Later, he learns of a mysterious private club that allows its members to explore their sexual desires. He manages to get inside the club, but in doing so, he puts himself in more danger than he ever expected. <br />...Some people have argued that Eyes Wide Shut works if you perceive William's journey to be a dream. I say that changes nothing. What we have is three hours of watching a couple we wind up caring nothing about, because Kubrick's view is so detached. That cold, intellectual viewpoint, which made 2001: A Space Odyssey [1969] the best movie ever created in its genre, does not work here. Kubrick didn't always use this technique. His Spartacus [1961] was the most intelligent - and arguable, the best - Biblical epic ever filmed. Yet that film succeeded not because of spectacle, but because of its making the characters all too human. It moved everyone who saw it. <br />...Still, I don't think that Eyes Wide Shut's being one of his weakest efforts diminishes his legacy in the least. If you look at the works of the greatest directors, you rarely find that their last movies were their best ones. Having directed A Clockwork Orange, The Shining and Dr. Strangelove, as well as the two movies mentioned above, I doubt that Kubrick's light will fade anytime soon.<br />To anyone who thinks I have judged Eyes Wide Shut too harshly, I can only say that we usually judge our heroes the harshest.
1570427496|5.0|I've read this book 5+ times and I've seen the movie 4 times.. and yes, I cried every single time (both in the book and movie).. there's not enough words to explain how magnificent they are...SO amazing!!
B00003OSSL|2.0|Oh, how I looked forward to this movie before is was released. Two of my favorite stars and one of my favorite directors. Who could ask for more? As it turns out, I could ask for a lot more. <br />Random Hearts starts off well. Dutch Van Der Broeek [Harrison Ford] and Kay Chandler [Kristin Scott Thomas] have never met. Their spouses certainly have. They are having an affair. One morning they take a flight to Miami. Dutch and Kay are worry-free, because they have not been told the truth. So when the plane crashes shortly after takeoff , killing everyone on board, Dutch and Kay go about their mundane daily business. News reports flash everywhere, but what has it to do with them? Everything, as it turns out. <br />Dutch is an undercover policeman, and when he finds out his wife was traveling under the name of Mrs. Peyton Chandler, he goes on a quest to find out about the length and duration of the affair. At first, Kay, who is a Congresswoman running for reelection, wants nothing to do with him. After much persistence, she joins him on a search for answers that can never be found. Along the way, they also fall for each other. <br />Random Hearts is probably a well-meaning attempt at examining the grief process. It has so many problems that that examination never works. For one thing, this is one of the grimmest, most humorless movies I have seen in a long, long time. I should think that a veteran director like Sidney Pollock would know that, when the subject is heavy, you've got to crack a joke or two along the way to relieve the audience's stress. At least there should be a couple of characters who doesn't need Prozac. This is especially true about a movie that runs nearly two and a half hours.<br />I think the intention was to make the film poignant. Harrison Ford's performance prevents its becoming this. He is unbelievably awkward in his love scenes with Kristin Scott Thomas. I can't imagine that he's a bad lover, so I can only assume that this was his interpretation of the character. His sour-faced, awkward attempts at intimacy make it hard to believe that Kaye would want him much, if at all. Scott Thomas handles her role with aplomb, although her English accent creeps in now and then. <br />There is a subplot involving Dutch's undercover work. Except for a moment near the movie's climax, it has nothing to do with the plot. Sadly, it's a lot more interesting than the rest of the movie....
B00003CXPJ|1.0|I remenber when movies were good.  Now, at 25, I realize that Hollywood has just stopped trying, and is in the business purely for the money.  Zoolander is categorized as a comedy, but I wasn't laughing.  It is probably funny for kids under eleven years old, what with all the urination jokes and non-material characters.  Ben Stiller was funny in meet the parents, but this movie is boring and too predictable.  It [stinks], so be advised to keep far away from this waste of time that further enriches Hollywood and its constantly falling standards of quality.
6305657947|4.0|For a movie to succeed as mere entertainment, as simply a refreshment, it had better be good. The Thomas Crown Affair is very good. It is sophisticated, it is amusing, and it is sexy. It is also what they used to refer to as adult. Of course, the meaning of that word in reference to film and video has changed a lot in the last twenty years. So, I mean it in an old-fashioned sense.<br />The Thomas Crown Affair is a remake of a very successful 1968 movie. The story has been updated, and some changes have been made which I think make it a better movie. The original starred Steve McQueen, who was 38 at the time, and Faye Dunaway, who was 27. Today's stars, Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo, are both 45. This change proved to be a key to success. It takes an older woman to be as worldly as the clever and talented Thomas Crown.<br />Thomas Crown [Brosnan] has it all, He is handsome, educated and enormously wealthy. Yet, Mr. Crown is easily bored, and the only way he can get through life successfully is to make a game out of it. One of these games is about to be played, and we've been invited to watch. Thomas is preparing to rip off a $100,000,000 painting from New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. The first twenty minutes of the movie are about the theft, and while it is interesting, it is fairly similar to a score of other movie heists. It is when Catherine Banning [Rene Russo] first appears that things start to sizzle. Catherine, daughter of a bounty hunter, works for the insurance company that stands to lose a lot of money. Catherine seems willing to do about anything to get her theif. She, too, makes a game out of life.<br />Working with the NYPD, it doesn't take long for Crown to become Catherine's prime suspect. But, where is the proof? Where is the painting? Best of all, where is the motive? It takes a Catherine to understand that sometimes the motive is the game itself. She decides to get to know Thomas Crown, and she gets to know him very well. At first, she tries to maintain some professional ethics. When these don't work, she blithely throws them out. What she can't find out vertically, she can try to find out horizontally. Yet, this decision leads to problems. Thomas is as good an investigator as she is, while she is as much of a scoundrel as he it. It all becomes a very elaborate game, and it gets very interesting when the pair starts to bond with each other emotionally. <br />It is remarkable that, in a culture obsessed with youth, the hottest screen couple of the year is middle-aged. True, Ms. Russo and Mr. Brosnan are in great shape. He is, after all, the current James Bond. Still, it is this pair, who are as close to 65 as they are to 25, that show us what a torrid affair is really like. And it is this element that makes The Thomas Crown Affair so successful. This couple simply has a magnetism and a knowledge that simply doesn't exist in a pair of twenty-year olds. You'll simply have to see it to understand what I mean. In any case, this was the best romantic crime caper of 1999.
B000051ZST|1.0|A ninth-rate attempt at a film about the great college tradition.  Cannot compare to PCU, Revenge of the Nerds, Back to School, Real Genius, ANIMAL HOUSE, many others.  This movie has nothing original, and Tom Green's role could have been much funnier.  MTV films seem so politically correct, and this was no exeption.  If you like the Disney/McDonalds-style crap music and brainless shows MTV mass produces these days, you'll probably enjoy this horrible film that drains stupid teen-agers of their allowance money.
6305718954|3.0|Stigmata did well at the boxoffice, and I can understand why. Despite its ridiculous plot, it comes off as a well made horror/thriller. It should please many of the genre's fans.<br />Father Andrew Keirnan was a scientist before he became a priest. He has an interesting job. He works directly for the Vatican and travels the world checking out reported visions and miracles. Most of these turn out to be bogus, but in South America, he witnesses an event that he cannot disprove. Upon the death of a priest there, a statue of the Virgin Mary in the local church begins to weep blood. While all this is going on, a boy steals the dead priest's rosary and sells it to an American tourist, who sends it to her daughter as a present. As soon as it arrives, the girl begins to experience a condition know as the stigmata. She begins to suffer the wounds that Christ suffered on the cross. What makes it all the more mysterious is that the girl isn't Catholic. In fact, she doesn't even believe in God. Father Keirnan becomes involved in ways he never dreamed possible. And a Cardinal back in Rome is willing to do anything to hush the whole matter up. <br />Patricia Arquette is marvelous as the victim, Frankie Page. She throws herself into the role, and while it isn't a part worth losing sleep over, I can't help but admire Arquette's energy. She should have a long and successful career. Gabriel Byrne gives his usual serviceable performance as Father Keirnan, a man who long ago lost his own faith. Jonathan Price is suitably creepy as the nefarious Cardinal Houserman, while Nia Long does okay in the thankless role of Frankie's best friend. <br />This brings us to the fly in the ointment - the plot. The Catholic church was particularly upset over Stigmata. I'm not Catholic, so to me it was basically just another movie. Still, the whole thing is illogical, and I suspect that the screenwriter was either a former Catholic with something against the Church or someone who didn't do their research. The stigmata is supposed to be the blood of Christ. It would seem that, if such an experience really occurred, it would bring the person to a higher plane of existence. Instead, after a particularly horrific episode, Frankie and her friend decide that the best idea is to go to the local disco. After all, it's Friday night. Later, Frankie goes through a demonic possession straight out of The Exorcist. This scene is in total opposition to the original notion that she is made to suffer for the purpose of some greater good. The story becomes a muddled mess of theological mayhem, but I do not think the Church will suffer any irreparable harm from this Hollywood Stigmata.
B00005LC1H|5.0|Excellent british humor--you can't go wrong with this. Basil (Cleese of Monty Python) is the luckless, racist, sexist el-cheapo of a hotel manager who, in the end, you can't help but feel sorry for. Great gags, overpowering wife and self-destructing plots plus poor old Manuel the bean bag make for a very entertaining cast worth repeated viewings.
B00005UQ9F|1.0|...I always enjoyed David Caruso's work on television, but I have yet to see him in a film that I feel truly showcases his talents.  Also, I rarely write negative reviews -- of films, books, or music -- but after watching this last night, I feel like I've been insulted.<br />The building in this film -- an abandoned mental hospital -- is definitely possessed of a personality of its own, but I can't say much for the charcters or plot.  Several interesting avenues are approached -- but none of them are explored at any length or with any intelligence.  One of the characters in the film stumbles upon a cache of tapes relating to a notorious sexual abuse case, involving efforts of doctors to awaken repressed memories in a multiple-personality disorder patient -- but other than listening to a few of the tapes and making some notes, that's as far as this is explored.<br />I also found it a little hard to swallow that the haz-mat team featured in the film, pressed to do what they admit is at least a two-to-three week job in a week's time, finds so much opportunity to sit around and irritate each other and explore the various rooms and corridors of the hospital.<br />The atmosphere depicted in the film was nicely portrayed, but that's about the only plus I could find in it.  I was left feeling like I had wasted an evening.

B000062Y98|5.0|I must say that I was nervous when I picked up this CD. I mean, I've been anticipating this album's release for about a year now. It took them a little longer to record this album because they are perfectionists...and that is why there is no other band like Blind Guardian.<br />The most immediate thing that I noticed about the new Blind Guardian is that they sound bigger and fuller. The guitars are more pronounced and clear, the drums are more definitive, and the orchestration that seemed to merely permeate past releases is now here in full force. This is Blind Guardian in your face! The choruses are also huge and demand your full attention. I would have to say that the most pleasant suprise of all is the much-improved drumming of Thomen Stauch. Not that he wasn't good before...I always thought of him as just a consistent drummer. Look out, because he really comes into his own as a precise and technical percussionist with a style all his own. <br />For those worried that Blind Guardian would abandon any part of their sound, your fears are in vain. As far as the speed element of their sound is concerened, they inject enough speedy moments into their songs to keep things constantly at an up-tempo pace (see 'Precious Jerusalem', 'Under the Ice', and especially 'Punishment Divine'). I'll put it like this...every single thing that Blind Guardian has ever done well in the past is here and done better than ever. Hansi Kursch's voice is more clear, powerful, and convincing than ever. And the riffs...oh the riffs. Andre Olbrich should win an award for the riffs he came up with on this one. Unreal. One last thing...the production is practically flawless.<br />In summary, it was well worth the wait. I have to say that after being a Blind Guardian fan for 3 years now that they are the most exciting and musically rewarding band to listen to. They belong in the same category with Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, and Iron Maiden as a band who just revolutionized the genre of heavy metal. In fact, this release transcends metal. It is the purest definition of remaining true to one's own style and perfecting it and expanding on it. There is no one else that does what Blind Guardian does. A Night at the Opera represents everything that metal was supposed to be: Creative. Powerful. Thoughtful. Energetic. Relentless. Thanks BG!!!
B00005V3Z4|5.0|I went to see this film in the theater a few months ago, knowing very little about it, and was absolutely blown away by its inventiveness, cleverness, and vitality.  For some reason it never got a real release here in Boston, and so now it appears on DVD having hardly been in theaters.<br />But the DVD of this movie is extremely well made and complements the movie well: lots of commentary, and a ton of deleted scenes.  The movie is incredibly mysterious, and the DVD kind of helps to clear up the mystery.<br />Not only is this movie set in the 80's, but it also has an 80's movie feel: it has a tone that is somewhat remininscent of &quot;repo man&quot;, &quot;heathers&quot;, with a little &quot;highlander&quot; (?!) thrown in.  the high school slo-mo scene set to the tune of tears for fears' &quot;head over heels&quot; is a classic movie moment.
B00004RF98|4.0|I love this movie and bought it for that reason, but I was disappointed to find that one side of the disc is blank, and there is no widescreen version on the disc. I guess they're not making DVD's like they used to... 5 stars for the movie, 3 for the DVD so an average of 4 stars.
B00003CWNR|2.0|This movie isn't just a \\"pleasant\\" little \\"coming-of-age\\" story. The rolling hills, Fall colors and pretty faces are just superficial aspects of what really amounts to a somewhat preachy morality play, in favor of ethical relativism and \\"choice.\\"<br />There can be no doubt that this film is an argument in favor of what philosophy majors call \\"ethical relativism.\\" M. Caine's character practically holds your hand and spells it out for you...it isn't subtle. Ethical relativism is the belief that there are no steadfast rules in life, no fundamental principles to adhere to...only subjective choices made under ever-changing conditions. Therefore no person has the right to \\"judge\\" another person's actions. This is very convenient for those of us who wish to behave in a less than respectable fashion. There are no heroes, and no villains--no concepts of \\"better\\" and \\"worse.\\" We act as we see fit, and no one has the right to impede us. <br />Ironically, we ARE asked to think of this world-view as \\"better.\\" We ARE supposed to see Tobey Maguire's performance of an abortion in the end as a sort of spiritual maturation, as if he has graduated from his infantile revulsion towards the inherent violence of this act by embracing the relativism of it all.<br />The only people we ARE allowed to judge for the worse, apparently, are those who do not share this \\"sophisticated\\" world-view (as is evident from many of the posts on this site). We attack those who have not abandoned their principles, calling them \\"naive,\\" \\"closed-minded,\\" \\"faint-hearted\\" and simple. We make generalizations and call them fundamentalists and zealots and hypocrites, all the while taking the moral high-road that we criticize them for allegedly taking. <br />Understand that this movie IS about supporting a particular political/philosophical viewpoint, and attacking those who disagree...whether you like to call it propaganda is up to you.
0812550757|5.0|Good fiction illuminates current human events, regardless when it was written.  For example, who can deny that \\"Othello\\" or \\"Les Miserables\\" contain characters that are readily identifiable today?  So, rather than hype this book and tell you what a great read it is (and it is), why not use it as a prism for the most pressing issue of the day -- terrorist Islamic fundamentalism?<br /><br /> Some background about the book first.  It's 3000 yeas after the Bugger Wars of Ender's Game.  Everyone hates Ender Wiggin as a xenocide, a species killer, and lots of people love the original Speaker For the Dead, the person who wrote the humanistic \\"Hive Queen\\" and the \\"Hegemon,\\" which attempts to explain Buggers to humans, and visa versa.  Few people know that the original Speaker For the Dead and Ender Wiggin are the same person.  Ender is called to the Brazilian colony of Milagre to \\"speak\\" or provide a frank eulogy, for scientists who were cruelly murdered by an indigenous tribe of intelligent entities that look a lot like pigs.  Ender discovers that there had been a horrible misunderstanding between humans and the \\"Piggies,\\" which had led to the deaths of the scientists.  Ender and the people of Milagre make a treaty with the Piggies.<br /><br /> Application to September 11, 2001.  Are the people of Milagre the West, and the Piggies the Moslems?  Hmmm.  Card's basic theme that misunderstanding between civilizations leads to tragedy is applicable here, but you really can't go much past that.  In \\"Speaker For the Dead,\\" the two civilizations had no particular ill will towards each other.  They simply misunderstood each others' beliefs and motives.  In contrast, the September 11 crew and those who agree with them have a misunderstanding about the nature of reality, which cannot necessarily be corrected through greater cultural interchange, as \\"Speaker For the Dead\\" implies.<br /><br /> Much more useful is Card's classification of human interaction: utlanning, framling, ramen, varelse and djur.  See pages 38 and 41.  Although in \\"Speaker\\" the classification applies to both inter- and intra-species relations, it is still useful here.  Are fundamentalist-terrorist Moslems misguided framlings, or are they a metaphorical djur?  Our policy seems to be to treat them like djur, the wild beast, until they show themselves to be framlings.  Communication with them *is* possible, though difficult, so they are not varelse.<br /><br /> Now compare September 11 and the \\"humanistic religion\\" of speaking for the dead.  On page 39 Card states that \\"Speakers for the dead held as their only doctrine that good and evil exist entirely as human motive, and not at all in the act.\\"  Applied to September 11, 2001, the conclusion is that if the motives of the 19 highjackers were pure, if what they thought that what they were doing was for the good of their people and themselves, then the act was good.  Any sane person flinches from such a conclusion.  That may be a reductium ad absurdum example, but we live in a reductio ad absurdum world post-September 11.  So don't buy into the moral philosophy of speaking for the dead unless you are willing to go that far.  Speaking honestly about a person's life is one thing; providing indirect justification for mass murder is quite another.arelse and djur.  See pages 38 and 41.

0790736039|2.0|I saw this movie as an eight year old many years ago and I was terrified for too long too remember.  Now, years later, I just finishing reading the book, (The book was amazing, I highly recommend it!) and decided to see the movie afterwards.  I was horrified-but not in the way I was expecting!  <br />The movie was boring with bad special effects and no regard for what actually happened in the book.  I could list obvious errors for each scene, not just things which a Made-for-TV-movie couldn't include, but cases where things go against what is stated in the novel.  The characters (mainly Richie, who was always my favorite) do not act the correct way.  Henry and his gang are greatly pacified as well as Bev's father and even It.  It, the creature, suddenly has new rules for what it can do and what can hurt it.  The movie was a horrible disappointment with no knowledge of the novel Stephan King wonderfully wrote.
B00005V3Z4|2.0|I was really looking forward to this movie, but so much of it strikes me as a really well made, feature-budgeted student film. <br />Why?<br />Because \\"Donnie Darko\\" is bursting with inspiration (some fresh, a lot borrowed) and yet it just doesn't seem to have the wisdom of very much actual experience. I was both fascinated and frustrated at every turn and in the end I was mostly just disappointed.<br />For starters, \\"DD\\" is saddled with one of the most opaque and least likeable main characters since \\"Brewster McCloud\\" (which comes to mind because it, too, is an intriguing and risky but ultimately unsuccessful experiment). Jake Gyllenhaal plays Donnie with the \\"head down, eyes up\\" sad-smile glower of a Kubrick anti-hero. Sometimes Donnie is smart. Sometimes Donnie is dumb. Sometimes Donnie is mean. Sometimes Donnie is cool. Sometimes Donnie is crazy. Which is like most teenages (or even most people) but it becomes problematic when we can never get a rough estimate of how many cards the central character is playing with.<br />The other characters aren't much help, either. The villains are cardboard and heavy handedly drawn; virtually free of any sort of complexities, they proudly sing the virtues of censorship, psycho-evangelism, and easy answers. Donnie's rebellion against them almost makes it appear that he's taking easy bait.<br />Everybody else just sort of wanders in and out of the story, and I was really surprised at how ill-used Drew Barrymore, Noah Wylie, Jena Mallone and especially Maggie Gyllenhaal are. They're all very good when it occurs to the script that they should make an appearance, but most of the time the script would rather watch Donnie be kooky.<br />Finally, there are just too many elements of \\"DD\\" that remind me of, or refer to, other stuff. There's the malevolent infomercial guru prancing around on stage and he seems to belong to another movie (say, \\"Requiem for a Dream\\" or \\"Magnolia\\"). There's the mystical rabbit-like wanderer (probably onlya coincidence that \\"Sexy Beast\\" has one, too, but what about, say, \\"Gummo\\" ?). The troubled wild child in counselling (\\"Good Will Hunting,\\" \\"Ordinary People\\"). When the movie wants to be cheeky, it displays a theater marquee with the \\"Halloween Double Feature\\" of \\"Evil Dead\\" and \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" (zing! crash!). And one would think, since Donnie's mother is versed in Stephen King (she's reading \\"It\\" when the movie opens), she'd at least have a clue where her story was going.<br />Based on the amount of deleted scenes on the DVD, and the wealth of information that's covered therein (including a particularly interesting but excised revelation about Donnie's medication) I think this was a movie that lost its way during the editing.  Director Kelly doesn't seem to have any real regrets on the commentary track so I doubt there will be a more coherent \\"director's cut,\\" but I imagine that a longer version would've filled in some of the blanks that I was left with at the end of the film.<br />Nevertheless, as a horror movie, \\"Donnie Darko\\" does strive for something MUCH more subtle than most of the recent offerings from the horror genre. It does have genuine moments of creepiness and dread. I felt led on and let down by \\"Donnie Darko,\\" but I'd rather see this creepy failure five times than see another variation on \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\" which, fortunately, is one movie \\"Donnie\\" doesn't emulate.<BR>I'll be interested to see what Richard Kelly does next.
0930289234|5.0|...although I don't think it will ever happen. Watchmen came at a time when comics were stuck in a rut they had been in since the early sixties, and blew everybody away. It was a product of it's time and the effect it had could never be duplicated. Most comics out today are pretty much the grandchildren of Watchmen and The Dark Knight Returns. These two stories and a handfull of others changed the way we think about comic books. They introduced more mature and relevant themes that went way beyond the typical super-hero fare that dominated everything up till that point. Watchmen is a brilliantly written masterpiece of comic fiction illustrated by the very talented Dave Gibbons. Gibbons' style dosen't ever get him on to any &quot;hot 10&quot; list's because of his subdued, low key style, but perfectly brings to life Alan Moore's story with his excellent storytelling skills that no early Image artist like Rob Liefeld or Erik Larsen could accomplish because of the fact that there aren't buildings exploding every two panels and the characters have to look like real people. Watchmen slowly simmers to a boil then explodes into a very satisfing ending (regardless of what some people say).<br />This story represents what I wish we had much more of in comics, well concieved, well executed stories that advance the medium and brings it closer to an artform that will gain some respect. Thank god for guys like Alan Moore and Frank Miller who show that comic books can be just as powerfull and entertaing an industry as Movies, TV, or novels, and sometimes surpass them.
B00005JKZQ|4.0|If you've seen the trailer for this movie, you pretty much know what to expect, because what you see here is what you get.  And even if you haven't seen the previews, it won't take you long to pick up on what you're in for-- specifically, a good time and plenty of laughs-- from this clever satire of \\"Reality TV\\" shows and \\"Buddy Cop\\" movies, \\"Showtime,\\" directed by Tom Dey, starring Robert De Niro and Eddie Murphy.<br /> Mitch Preston (De Niro) is a detective with the L.A.P.D., and he's good at what he does; but working a case one night, things suddenly go south when another cop, Trey Sellars (Murphy), inadvertently intervenes, a television news crew shows up and Mitch loses his cool, which results in a lawsuit by the television station that's going to cost the department some big bucks.  Except that they may be able to get around it, thanks to Chase Renzi (Rene Russo), who works for the station and likes what she sees in Mitch-- enough to pitch an idea to her boss for a \\"Reality\\" cop show, that would feature none other than Mitch Preston, whom Chase sees as a real life \\"Dirty Harry.\\"<br /> Her boss likes the idea and gives Chase the green light.  Now all she has to do is convince Mitch to participate, which shouldn't be too hard, since the station has agreed to drop the lawsuit if he will do the show.  But Mitch is a cop, not an actor, and he wants nothing to do with any of it-- that is until he has a heart-to-heart with his boss, Captain Winship (Frankie Faison), who puts Mitch's future into succinct perspective for him.  And just like that, the show is on.  Oh, yes, there's one more thing; for the show, Mitch is going to need a partner.  And who do you suppose they're going to come up with for that?  Let's put it this way:  Trey Sellars is more than one of the usual suspects.<br /> This is Dey's second film as a director, his first being \\"Shanghai Noon,\\"-- also a comedy-- and he's definitely showing a penchant for the genre.  From the opening frames he establishes a pace that keeps the story moving right along, and he allows his stars to make the most of their respective talents and personal strengths, including their impeccable timing.  With stars like De Niro and Murphy, Dey, of course, had a leg up on this project to begin with, but he's the one who keeps it on track, demonstrating that he knows what works, achieving just the right blend of physical comedy and action, and employing the subtleties of the dialogue to great effect.  <br /> There isn't a more natural actor in the business than De Niro, and he steps into Mitch's skin like he was born to it.  And after years of doing hard-edge, cutting drama (in which he turned in one remarkable performance after another), with such films as \\"Analyze This,\\" \\"Meet the Parents\\" and now this one, he has firmly established his proficiency for doing comedy, as well.  Mitch is not an especially complex character; he is, in fact, something of an \\"ordinary\\" guy, but therein lies the challenge for the actor-- to make him believable, to make him seem like the guy who could be your neighbor and just another member of the community.  And on all counts, De Niro succeeds.  He's Mitch, the guy you run into at the grocery store or the bank, or say \\"good morning\\" to on your way to work; who likes to watch the game on TV and has a life, just like you and me, who happens to make his living by being a cop.  It's the character Mitch has to be to make this film work, because it makes the \\"ordinary guy in extraordinary circumstances\\" angle credible.  It's one of those role-- and work-- that is often wrongly dismissed out-of-hand, because it looks so easy; and, of course, this is what makes De Niro so exceptional-- he does make it look easy, and he does it with facility.<br /> As Trey Sellars, Eddie Murphy turns in a winning performance, as well, and it's a role that fits him like the proverbial glove.  Trey is a cop, but also an aspiring actor-- and a bad one-- and it gives Murphy the opportunity toplay on the over-exuberant side of his personality (reigned in enough by Dey, however, to keep him from soaring over-the-top into Jim Carrey territory), which works perfectly for this character and this film.  From his melodramatic take on a part during an audition, to his throwing out of one-liners-- delivered by looking directly into the camera (which as far as he's concerned isn't even there) while filming the \\"reality\\" show-- Murphy's a riot.  And he has a chemistry with De Niro that really clicks (which is not unexpected, as this is another of De Niro's many talents; his ability to connect with and bring out the best in his co-stars, all of whom-- evidence will support-- are better at their craft after having worked with him, including the likes of Meryl Streep, Christopher Walken and Ed Harris, just to name a few).  Most importantly, this is a part that allows Murphy to excel at what he does best, and he certainly makes the most of it.<br /> Russo makes the most of her role as Chase, too, a character who isn't much of a stretch artistically, but whom she presents delightfully, with a strong, believable performance.  And William Shatner (playing himself) absolutely steals a couple of scenes as the director of the show.<br /> The supporting cast includes Drena De Niro (Annie), Pedro Damian (Vargas) and James Roday (Camera Man).  Well crafted and delivered, \\"Showtime\\" is a comedy that's exactly what it is meant to be:  Pure entertainment that provides plenty of laughs and a pleasant couple of hours that will have you chuckling for some time after.  It's the magic of the movies.
0385503954|5.0|Ian McEwan's Atonement renders the story of the Tallis family during a crucial epoch-- the interwar period, 1935, just before WWII.  The spotlight shines most directly on Briony, the early-pubescent daughter whose household will soon swell with the arrival of new family members.  Briony has the insecurity and longings that remind a reader of Holden Caulfield, along with the latter's desire to set things right in her own preconceived way.  Briony dreams of becoming a novelist but will later become a nurse to \\"atone\\" for the sins of her actions that lead to unintended consequences.  In fact, true to the book's title, its characters in general atone in various ways for the often disastrous outcomes of their actions.<br />Besides the depth of character development in the book, we the readers are also treated to a marvelously vivid set of images of a world gradually hurtling toward war.  There is Briony's stripping in the fountain for Robbie Turner, and the latter's desperation several years later at Dunkirk, waiting in terror for an uncertain rescue as the Nazi death trap closes in around him and his compatriots.  A worthy and in some ways superior follow-up to McEwan's Amsterdam.

The Coehn brothers, by inspiring this compliation, have re-introduced bluegrass and \\"country-folk\\" to the wider public, and the wider public has remembered that they actually like it.<br />Filled with rich, colorful voices in pure, unprocessed performances, this recordring delights with its directness.  One remembers that the human voice- sans echo, sans endless melisma, without a backbeat- is beautiful in its own right.<br />Highlights include Ralph Stanley's \\"O Death\\", which, in the film was sung, ironically, by the grand wizard of a KKK-like group,  and the seductive \\"Didn't Leave Nobody But the Baby.\\"<br />Having listened to this recording perhaps a dozen times now, I find that there are a few songs that have become a bit grating.   I find that the de facto \\"title cut\\" of this soundrack recording, \\"A Man of Constant Sorrow\\" is not particularly interresting musically and begins to get a little tedious, particularly since it appears in three different versions on this soundtrack.  Also, \\"Down to the River to Pray\\" sounds a bit too much like an advertisement for, say, a \\"wholesome\\" oatmeal for me to take to it wholeheartedly.<br />And call me heartless, but  \\"In the Highways\\", sung by the infuriatingly whiny children the Peasall Sisters, has sent me diving for the \\"skip track\\" button more times than just about any other song in my collection.   <br />But there are enough melodic gems in this filled to the brim recording to make this a worthwhile purchase.  Just keep the remote near by.<br />Those who enjoy this music should check out the field recordings of Alan Lomax.

0446677450|5.0|Thesis: The point of Rich Dad Poor Dad is to teach people the financial information that the antiquated school system is incapable of teaching. Kiyosaki made clear the difference between an asset and a liability, and the importance of knowing how to make assets work for you. He also focused on the idea of having money work for them, instead of working for money.<br />Summary and Analysis: In Robert Kiyosaki's  Rich Dad Poor Dad , Kiyosaki tells parents that the worst piece of advice that you can possibly tell your children is to go to school, study hard, get good grades, get in to a good college, graduate and find a secure job. Kiyosaki feels that schools are teaching students how to be employees, not employers. Kiyosaki teaches the reader through telling the story of his two fathers; his \\"Rich Dad\\", and his \\"Poor Dad.\\" His real dad, the poor one, was a very well educated man. He graduated from college, earned a degree, and became the head of education in Hawaii. Even with all of his education he lived most of his life in poverty. His \\"Rich Dad\\", who was actually his friend Mike's Dad, was the one who provided him with an education on business success.  His \\"Rich Dad\\" was a high school drop out, who was very financially knowledgeable and really knew how to make money work for him. Even though not scholastically educated, Kiyosaki's \\"Rich Dad\\" turned out to be one of the richest tycoons in Hawaii. Kiyosaki is able to provide business advice from many different viewpoints telling the reader which father's advice he chose to follow.<BR>  Kiyosaki teaches many lessons ranging from \\"The rich don't work for money\\", and \\"Mind your own business\\", to \\"Work to learn-Don't work for Money\\", and \\"College education for $7,000.\\" In his wide variety of lessons, Kiyosaki teaches us that a standard college education is not enough to be financially independent and prosperous. In changing times it is important to be financially literate. Kiyosaki truly teaches us how to make money workfor us by making a lucrative asset column, and focusing on new investments in both property and stocks.<BR> This book really opened up a whole new outlook into business and investments for me. I had never really thought about the whole liability versus asset issue before, and never really realized how important a financial education is. Kiyosaki's usage of diagrams, as well as clear descriptions made the book very clear and understandable. I find myself thinking about possible investments and new business ideas because of the different ideas his book gave me. Rich Dad Poor Dad had a very big influence on me and has made me more financially literate and will make me more successful in the long run.
B00004RJ71|5.0|We live in an entertainment society where the face of a minority tends to represent the face of a drug dealer or a gang member.  Although that is a partial truth to a sad reality that many in our families face, this movie finally serves as a proper representation to people from other cultures and from other communities of life in the streets of East L.A. as a Chicano.<br />Paco Aguilar (Benjamin Bratt) shows the turn-arounds that many in our community have made for many years now, being able to change from a life of gangs and crime to becoming a figure of authority and respect.  Cruz Candelaria (Jesse Borrego) shows how the gifts that are within our fellow brothers and sisters can be tarnished by the devils that are within the drugs that reside in our streets.  And last but not least, Miklo Velka (Damian Chapa) shoes the struggles that many in people face from being of mestizo blood, which is true to members of mixed race from any background or ethnicity.  His fight to belong leads him towards the world that exist in the confines of San Quentin.<br />Very few movies have given light to the true reality that exists in our beautful culture, and Blood In Blood Out is at the top of that list.  I am somebody who has a little of Paco, Cruz, and Miklo within me.  I don't care who you are, after watching this movie, you will know that you have a little bit of all three of them in you too.  This is a great movie whether you are Chicano/Latino, Anglo, Asian, African-American, or any other race.  This belongs in all movie collections of any culturally-concious movie goer, in any format.

6304675348|4.0|In the grand tradition of unforgettable slasher flicks such as \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\", \\"Halloween\\", \\"Friday the 13th\\", \\"A Nightmare On Elm Street\\", and all the not so memorable imitations to arise in their wake, comes \\"Scream\\", a film about a small group of high school friends (Neve Campbell, Skeet Ulrich, Rose McGowan, Matthew Lillard and Jamie Kennedy) whose lives are turned upside down when fellow members of their student body start turning up dead, brutally murdered by the hands of a mysterious masked killer who could very well be one of their own.<br />This 1996 effort written by Kevin Williamson and directed by modern fright master, Wes Craven, truly is \\"clever, hip and scary\\" in its ability to successfully combine elements of horror, mystery and comedy into one nice, neat, little blood-soaked package.  Along with an exceptional leading cast, \\"Scream\\" also features strong supporting performances from both David Arquette and Courteney Cox, as well as an unforgettable cameo appearance by Drew Barrymore.  Buffs of the genre will also have fun picking up on the various references to older films which helped pave the way for this modern horror \\"classic\\".  Two sequels soon followed, \\"Scream 2\\" in 1997 (the better of the two) and \\"Scream 3\\" in 2000, neither of which are necessarily bad films, but they're certainly not able to compare to the original as far as wit, character strength and story development go.<br />However, as is the case with any ground-breaking motion picture, numerous rip-offs and imitations are bound to follow.  A slew of \\"whodunnit\\"-type slasher flicks have been released over the course of the past few years in an attempt to cash in on the popularity of the \\"Scream\\" franchise, including films like \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\", \\"Urban Legend\\", \\"Valentine\\" and the direct-to-video quickie \\"Bloody Murder\\", all of which range from being merely mediocre to downright awful.  So forget the rest and go with the best!<br />\\"IT'S A 'SCREAM', BABY\\"!!!

B00005QIPH|5.0|I'm not an expert in music. I don't listen to much underground bands unfortunately. But here's my take on what I bought recently, The Strokes.<br />It's a good CD. Actually, it's a really good CD.<br />While I've been on my computer the past 6 hours, I have not taken this CD out of my drive, nor have I skipped any songs. I have also not grown tired of this cd yet.<br />The Strokes have a certain quality about them that is found in every good band. Pure, raw, honest energy. The Strokes put forth their music in a pure stream of enthusiasm and a a method of perfection.<br />I in no way mean this is a &quot;studio&quot; album. It doesn't sound like it, and that's what I like about it. They play well, and that's all there is to it.<br />&quot;Is this it?&quot; has already made it to my play-daily pile, Along with Nirvana's &quot;Nevermind&quot;, Rage against the machine's &quot;Self-Titled&quot;, AC/DC's &quot;Back in Black&quot;, Jurassic 5's &quot;Quality Control&quot;, now goes The Stroke's &quot;Is this it?&quot;.<br />It is honestly a great album from a great band with great energy and will keep me listening to for a long time
B00004RF9B|4.0|Tremendous special effects, and a great plot, combine to form a movie that is very watchable even today. Some of the acting is a bit old-fashioned, but the style is amazing.<br />This DVD transfer is about average, clear and bright but taken from a rather faded print. I saw a lower-definition broadcast of it which did have better colours. However, it's a miracle these old movies are now frozen in time, no more deterioration (is this true?)
B00003CXXP|1.0|This film is one of the biggest loads of nonsense that I have seen at the cinema in a long time. The film is: childish, sentimental, boring, ridiculous, simplistic. If you have not seen it, don't waste your time and money on it. It's much worse than you could ever suspect.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|I know everyone has already rated the video 5 stars, so a 5 star DVD is not surprising, but the audio commentary by director and choreographer add so much to your understanding and appreciation of this great quirky movie.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I never expected to like Moulin Rouge. I despise musicals. Yet, of all the movies I have seen this year, I believe Moulin Rouge is my favorite (I liked the Fellowship of the Ring, but had quibbles--plus Moulin Rouge is an original piece of art).<br />The more I see of Ewan McGregor, the more impressed I am. He could have gone far too over the top with the role of Christian, but he is spot on. One gets drawn into his story and dragged away with him. He deserves the at least as much praise as Kidman is receiving.<br />Kidman is indeed worthy of the praise. This is a killer, yet delicate role that would have disintegrated in lesser hands. The mixture of knowing innocence she brings to the role of Satine is sheer genius. She also shows a great ability at comedy.<br />The supporting cast is delightful. John Leguizamo, Jim Broadbent, and Jacek Koman are all unforgettable. Kylie Minogue gets the festivities going delightfully as the green fairy. Richard Boxburgh is a wonderfully incompetent villain.<br />I'll admit I still do not like all the music in Moulin Rouge. What won me over when I first saw it, and continues to win me over today is that Moulin Rouge is a great love story. It is a great meditation on the meaning of love.<br />Baz Luhrmann has created a great story and wrapped it in a stunning cinematic vision (a revolution indeed). I have seldom been so impressed with a movie as I am with Moulin Rouge. This DVD version is packaged with all kinds of cool features and extras. I recommend it highly.
B000002KIK|4.0|Never Say Die catches Sabbath at an awkward phase.  An album had been all but done with vocalist Dave Walker and Ozzy returned.  Ozzy refused to sing anything written with the other vocalist.  Much of the material was written off the cuff and show the sab's ability to improv.  It's a weird record, but fans should delight in it.  Bill Ward's vocals on \\"Swingin' the Chain\\" are an unexpected high point.
B00005OAIE|5.0|this CD is absolutely GREAT! John's lyrics are heartfelt and sincere. The catchy tunes will make your other CDS grow dust! he truly is a great singer/songwriter and this album proves it. In concert this guy is a music god, on CD we get just a taste of his wonderful talent.  there is no room for improvement here. this album is fabulous and worth more than 5 stars. John Mayer is amazing!
B00003CXXP|4.0|I see a lot of credit going to Stanley Kubrick for the good aspects, and all the raspberries going to Spielberg for the goofy parts. This can't be right or fair! It's very impressive anyway. I thought the sentimentality fairly well controlled.<br />This movie has a live teddy bear in it, all the way through. A treat for bear fans, though his voice sounds a bit creepy.
0316287059|5.0|As a proffesional make-up-artist I have to give all the three of Kevyn Aucoins books I have, five stars: Face Forward, The art of Make-up and Making Faces. <br />All books are similar in the way they describe how to apply a straight beauty-make-up, but different enough so that each book brings something new. Aucoin is a make-up-genious and it is truly amazing to see the changes he makes to famous and not-so-famous faces.<br />Each photo has a good explanation to how the make-up is applied and why. This gives great help to a beginner...sort of a fill in the blanks approach to make-up.... and to a proffesional the book is filles with tips, ideas and just tons and tons of inspiration. These books are just about must-haves when it comes to make-up. I can recommend them all highly.
0684803356|2.0|I entered this book thinking highly of Hemingway, having read some of the Nick Adams stories as well as The Old Man and the Sea.  But Bell is quite a disappointment.  The 1930s-era characters seem to be speaking an off-putting and unwieldy gringo Shakespeare (\\"Thou hast crossed the arroyo, Ingles\\").  Moreover, the revolving themes of duty and honor and the instrument of war / administration vs. the individuals who carry out the specific deeds don't seem to develop.  Rather, the reader is subject to endless conversations with rather boring people, then Robert Jordan muses in an unenlightening manner upon the conversations he's had.  About 1/3 of the way through the book I was thinking \\"just blow the damn bridge up, make love to Maria, and go home.\\"  Having skimmed the Cliffs Notes, apparently it takes a few hundred more pages for that to happen; pages I am unwilling to read.
B00005A46T|1.0|Ouch. Life in Iowa ain't so bad folks, I lived there for 14 years and had a blast-(I went to high school with a couple members of the knot in good old IOWA...but I digress.)<br />Criticisms leveled against this disc by others are quite true. These guys are just another in a long line of somewhat talented bands to be embraced by the corporate music culture (how is it that the material on many albums by these types of bands continues to become more and more disgusting? What's the point? Not enough death and hate in the 'real' world for you?). Just wear some masks, sing about stuff that is completely repugnant and sickening, play fast double bass and galloping power chords, and throw in some satanism to boot and we'll sign you. It's a sad state of affairs.<br />I will give kudos where they are due-the sound of the disc is really good from what I remember. Very thick guitars and I thought Joey did a nice job on the drums. The danger with this type of music-call it 'death metal' if you want (I don't agree)-is that it is difficult to sound truly original and write material that doesn't all kind of run together like so much soup. I didn't hear anything especially ingenuitive on this disc. You can hear some of their influences easily at times, especially with the slayer-esque riffs. I guess we shouldn't be surprised that the material here is low-brow. Too bad these guys won't use their position to say something-ANYTHING-positive or worth repeating. Mix together the bad elements of any 10 metal bands and you have Slipknot. After hearing the disc a friend of mine told me \\"I feel obligated to give my condolences to their parents.\\" Me too. <br />The lyrics are complete garbage-in turn childish, horrific, laughable, and disturbing for the sake of being disturbing. Bottom line: If you're dumb enough to shell out the $ you can take their anger, hatred, and depression with you and listen to it day in and day out! For some real talented extreme metal try norwegian death metal/prog metal band Extol and their recent release \\"Undeceived\\". Now THAT'S talent.
B00005MCX2|5.0|Space Ritual has all of the groups most important members.  Mike Moorcock is there, Lemmy, Rob Calvert, Nik Turner, and of course Dave Brock.  A psychedelic masterpiece, Space Ritual sets the blueprint for Skin Yard, Voivod, Soundgarden, and Notably Monster Magnet.  The experiance is other worldly and stunning.  A must for those discovering the band.  This live album might be the best of all Hawkwind records.
0792153189|3.0|This movie and its illegimate twin, &quot;Armageddon,&quot; are efforts to &quot;do better&quot;--through special effects--than a really good movie of several years ago on the same subject.  It fails.  I think the older movie was entitled &quot;Asteroid&quot; and it starred Sean Connery and Natalie Wood.  The special effects in that one were adequate and the plot and action much better.
B00004XQ83|5.0|I bought the soundtrack before buying the DVD. We had seen the last part of the movie on one of the premium movie channels just a few days previously. Unfortunately we missed the beginning and as it was premiering, it was unclear as to when it would show again. The soundtrack is great. A combination of old country, blues and religious hymnal music. I think that in order to fully appreciate the CD, it is necessary to see the movie. The movie is funny, off-beat, up-beat, sad and heartwrenching. I was a little disappointed to learn that George Clooney was not actually singing, but he did a realistic job of lip-sinc. The 'clogging' was his own and hilariously funny which is one reason why you need to view the movie to get a real feel for the CD. Personally, I am happier with the DVD than with the CD. Listening to the CD just doesn't have the impact that 'seeing' it does. The CD I have in my car. I, of course, loved &quot;Man of Constant Sorrow&quot; but like &quot;He's In the Jailhouse Now&quot; which the movie character actually sang, and &quot;The Big Rock Candy Mountain&quot; is an old favorite from my childhood. The harmonious tunes of the Krause group and the others are beautiful. It's good to hear that so many of the young people also like the soundtrack. This is Americana at its finest. As far as I'm concerned, it's a winner and I'm so pleased it won the Grammy award. A bit surprising, yes, but well deserved!
0790742780|5.0|Ok, so I bought this movie on my friend's say so, and it is one of my new favorite movies ever! Definitely top 5.  It's about this guy, who's license plate says D-Fens.  He has recently been fired, and one day he's in a traffic jam, it's really hot, the ac does'nt work, the window won't roll down, and he just gets out of his car and says &quot;I'm going home&quot;.  And he tries to go home, but along the way he has run ins with the ills of modern society, and he fights back!  It's so cool, he makes a stand for the working stiff!  Several memorable scenes include one where  he gets frustrated at those road crews who never actually fix anything, so he &quot;gives them something to fix&quot; by blowing up a chunk of the street with a rocket!  Then there's this scene where D-Fens is on the phone, and some guy behind him complains about him being on it to long, se he shoots the phone with an uzi and says &quot; I think it's out of order&quot;!    He's just an ordinary guy who's sick of the frustrations of modern life.  The end may dissapoint some, but really, could you see it ending any other way after all that happens?  See this movie, you'll love it!
B000060P79|5.0|This is such a sweet CD... this band really rock! tunes like &quot;my alien&quot; and &quot;im just a kid&quot; r just not sumthing that u come across everyday... it really rate this CD... well worth it... simple plan RULE!
B00005A1PR|5.0|A truly talented sista was robbed at the Grammy's but that doesnt even dampen the effect of her excellent debut, Acoustic Soul. On the album she fuses her voice with excellently written tunes about coming into her own, and self love,and love just to name a few. She pays tribute to her influences and other legends in music which displays her humility. By the end of the album you feel as though you been vibin' with her for hours. Watch out for her sophomore release due later this summer 2002.
B000000H7I|5.0|But this is still about as good as brutal death metal gets.  \\"Pierced\\" sounds a little more polished to me, not only in production, but in songwriting.  And \\"Pierced\\" has a little more variation in songs.  But \\"Effigy\\" is still more or less essential if you're serious about Death Metal.<br />Mike Smith's drumming is creative and excellent and the Hobbs and Cerito twin guitar attack may be my favorite in the whole Death Metal genre.  Mullin's vocals are almost impossible to decipher on this album (not so on \\"Pierced\\").  However, he is probably my favorite brutal DM vocalist overall.<br />The cool thing about Suffocation is that repeated listenings reveal a little more detail.  There are always hooks and changes in the songs that keep jumping out at you, which is what seperates this band from some of the \\"sonic sludge\\" you get in a lot of extreme metal.
B00004XPPE|5.0|In an age when many movies are digitized and Bruckheimer-ized to death, I can pop \\"Fail-Safe\\" into the DVD player and enjoy a time when a great story and superior acting carried a movie. \\"Fail-Safe\\" is a take on the age-old theme of men discovering, perhaps too late, that they are the victims of the very machines and systems they created. Henry Fonda is unforgettable and utterly believeable as a President who is trying to avert all-out nuclear war by convincing his Soviet counterpart that an American bombing run on Moscow is a mistake. Other reviewers rightfully laud performances by Dan O'Herlihy and Walter Matthau, but for my money Frank Overton's portrayal of SAC commander General Bogan, though often overlooked, is as strong as any I've seen.<BR>Thank goodness this film was made in 1964 (in stark black-and-white) instead of today with our special-effects temptations.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|I do not recall the exact year, but in the early '90's Walt Disney Home Video released a CAV Laserdisc version called \\"Work In Progress: Beauty and the Beast.\\" In the words of the liner notes: \\"It was opening night of the 1991 New York Film Festival...\\"Beauty and the Beast\\" was presented in its full feature length, the animation still in various stages--including line drawings, rough sketches, conceptual scene paintings and final color. Upon the film's conclusion the crowd responded with a rare standing ovation, a prelude to the phenomenal success that would follow....<BR>... Here is a rare and unique glimpse into the creation of a classic. You'll visually experience the four steps of animation throughout Beauty and the Beast as a work in progress. For novice and collector, it is a thrilling voyage into the intricacies of the animator's art, a breathtaking behind-the-scenes look at the creative process that resulted in the aware-winning masterpiece, \\"Beauty and the Beast.\\"<br />...
B0000214F0|2.0|I have heard the hype surrounding this film for years and my curiosity was always aroused to see it. The film borrows heavily from Fellini's Satyricon and Kubrick's Clockwork Orange and attempts to shock us more than educate or entertain us. The \\"shock value\\" is all that can really be said for this film.<br />The portrayel of Caligula is one-dimensional and predictable. One never learns where Caligula got his childhood nickname \\"Little Bootinkins\\" nor learns much of his illustrious father Germanicus or any other details of his upbringing. McDowell is unconvincing as a Roman nobleman and statesman, nor is his portrayel of insanity very convincing either. One gets the feeling that Malcolm McDowell is just reprising his role of Alex from Clockwork Orange in a toga. <br />My only positive remarks would go to Peter O-Toole in the role of the aged and degenerate Tiberius. It is an inspiring performance that seems out of place in the context of this film. The camera work is amatuer and the acting is rather flat. The sets look [poorly made] and manufactured instead of solid and real. Indeed, Ancient Romans spent much of their time outdoors and this film is set almost entirely in indoor settings that look like bad science fiction sets left over from Barbarella. There is not a single scene filmed on location nor did the production take advantage of the city of Rome where it was filmed.<br />There was not enough depiction of Caligula's mental insanity and personal insecurities in my opinion. Suetonius tells us that no one was alowed to look down upon his balding head nor mention a goat in his presence. Caligula's obsession with his own divinity was also not shown to full effect. Why did they neglect to show his decision to erect a statue of Zeus at the temple in Jerusalem?<br />The DVD transfer is rather grainy and the picture quality is fuzzy. The sound is also not the best. This also adds to the \\"cheapness\\" and \\"sleezy\\" feel that I initially objected to at first. There is alot of potential to this film that sadly, does not satisfy in the end.<br />In a nutshell, this film uses the story of Caligula to make a bad film about degenerate sex, rather than using degenerate sex to make a great film about Caligula!
B00005NGSE|5.0|This was recorded in 1978, and there are those Linkin Park new metal type kids who will dismiss it as too old. Bad move, the Scorps kicked butt big time in Tokyo and this is one of the classic live albums, anybody who likes music LOUD will love this.<BR>The oddball I refer to is \\"Kojo No Tsuki\\" the Japanese fans liked this traditional folk song, but everybody I know finds it odd and out of place.
B00000K3D4|5.0|This is, without a shadow of doubt the most wonderful fantasy tale I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. Whether your young or old, this tale will capture your heart instantly with its loveable characters and brilliant cast. Jennifer Connelly plays the part of a troubled teenager convincingly without being cheesey - a refreshing change!David Bowie - my first love, is, in my opinion the only person who could have played the part of the Goblin King. He portrays his part as cruel, but he is so very charming you cannot resist liking him. The fantastic costumes and wild colours wrap this film up into a delightful parcel - a definate must for any fantasy lovers!<BR>     The tale is simple but effective. Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) must fight her way through the terrific Labyrinth to save her baby brother for being turned into a goblin by the Goblin King, Jareth (Bowie). With the help of Hoggle, Ludo and a whole host of other amazing creatures makes this a tale of friendship, love and excitement!I leave you with one thing, 'Give back the child. Through dangers untold and hardships unnumbered I have fought my here to the castle beyond the goblin city to take back the child that you have stolen. For my will is as strong as yours and my kingdom is great. You have no power over me!'. Enjoy everyone, enjoy!*L
6305350205|3.0|I can see see Servo and the robots viewing this movie on the program.  I can see them doing jokes about Shatner's stunt double doing the rock climbing and fights. The whole plot with the God planet is real bad. I don't know how Shatner got this one made. If Paramount is for a re edit with new special effects and the &quot;rock people&quot; the Shatty one wanted to come out of the pit I'm all for it.  On a special effects dependent feature like this one it would be worth it to revamp the effects.  It would have saved the whole film to have a worth while ending.  You can't blame poor Bran Ferren; the special effects producer. He was given a small budget and could not work outside of the money given him to produce a decent movie.

6305810109|5.0|We all know and appreciate Lynch with his twisted movies in which the viewer is forced to expect the unexpected and abnormal. When I heard the news, I was very excited that he was going to shoot a road movie that was nothing to do with paranormals and weird characters. After watching Straight story I was wondering  where was he before and why he was not shooting movies like this that can be called normal in his standards once a while.<BR>First of all this is a road movie. But also a movie about an old man who tries his best to achieve what he wants against all odds.<BR>It is also about humanity, respect as well as the elderly people who have seen all about life  but either extremely ignored or not remebered. Lynch manages to build a story combining all these elements and making the movie a visual and an emotional beauty.<BR>Straight story  takes us in to the heart of America with the real American people who are always there but rarely seen in the hollywood productions as normal,friendly folks.We also enter in to the world of elderly, their limited lives and their emotions.  Beautiful camera shots of fields, simple but touching music as well as the remarkable performances by the actors and actresses make this movie a classic. Even during the common road scenes it is difficult not to get very emotional. Lynch not only knows how to get chills to the spine with his previous works, but he also knows how to get in to the people's hearts by a camera.<BR>Overall in my opinion Straight story is an excellent movie which is better than the recent oscar awarded movies with their spoiled  million dollar actors and actresses as well as overblown budgets.<BR>A film for everyone and a film to remember.
B000063UR2|2.0|...  ...<br />The DVD does not say whether it is the original European release (...  ... Tangerine Dream did the second version of the score..not the first) or the American version.  I own both on VHS.<br />The American version with Tangerine DReam is good, but lacks the logical sequence of events that the European version does.<br />I had really looked forward to being able to have both version ...
0380002930|5.0|Simply put: The best book ever written. (That goes for Ulysses by James Joyce, too!)
0385334206|5.0|This being my first ever experience with Vonnegut, I don't think I was ready for the incredible words written within it(not to mention the pictures drawn). This book not only made me more interested in other Vonnegut novels, but also changed the way I looked at the craft of writing and the way I look at the world.<br />In between bouts of gut-busting laughter, I found insights into the human race, society, politics, sex, and lonliness which were all very well expressed and honest. Vonnegut shows all that is egregious in America and the world, and presents it to us in a humourous way.  Read this book...it may change your life.

B00005QDW1|4.0|Several albums in, \\"Rock Steady\\" had ridden the crest of several popular reviews, and was genuinely well-received...All through this album, the band's 80's influence is astounding, but strangely enough, it's also totally fresh!  \\"Hey Baby\\" is marginal pap which doesn't deserve it's lead-off single status.<br />\\"Don't Let Me Down\\", \\"Making Out\\", and \\"Underneath It All\\" are all great A-sides, proving (thankfully) that the band knew enough to let their hair down and just make an album that was actually FUN to listen to.  If the more critical reviewer slams them for using so many producers, I can't be that political.<br />I've always been a sucker for a good pop tune, and this album is loaded with them.
B00000K0DK|5.0|This film is a masterpiece. The last tycoon of the first half of the twentieth century. A power and an influence entirely based on newspapers and a new way to practice journalism : journalism as a reality show. Kane has the tendency though to think he can mould the opinions of people as if he controlled them through his papers. The film is a sad demonstration of the impact of such journalism and at the same time its limits and its failures. Actually he is destroyed in his political career by the same papers and journalism that all the other papers immediately imitated because the circulation of Kanes papers was menacing the others to be crushed down into oblivion. But the film also explores the personal dimension of the character, his pharaonic ambition, his cult of collecting artistic artefacts or any other collectibles, his love for his second wife and its inevitable end because she could not live up to his dream of being some kind of king or god on earth. She felt abandoned and crushed by the famous palace of Xanadu and finally decided to leave. Strangely enough the film does not emphasize the death of his son, from his first marriage, a death that must have been particularly dramatic to Kane. The film is also a masterpiece by its technique and the way the story is unveiled and developed. It tried all kinds of story-telling techniques, a film in the film, a musical in the film, a jounalistic investigation within the journalistic world of Kane, and a completely exploded plot line that follows the investigation more than chronology. Things come apparently haphazardly though in an absolutely planned way. The structure is not clear cut and onesided, but rather a multifarious and multifacetted structure that gives to the film a tremendous power and dynamism.<br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
0345349571|4.0|This book is long, detailed, with a host of characters who's names are almost impossible to remember. It was a tough read & I have to admit that I had to intersperse the reading of it, with a couple of \\"lighter\\" books on the side. Worthwhile though? I'll say! Tuchman has a style that brings one intimately into the world she is describing. I felt chastened by the suffering of the Black death victims, exhausted by the toil of the peasants & angered by the corruption of just about everyone else. Churchmen who sold the services that should have been freely given, many of whom shamefully refused to give plague victims last rites for fear of contagion. Nobles & knights oppressed the people they were supposed to protect. Kings & princes made pacts with each other that were never intended to be honoured. Honour, indeed, is a quality almost non-existant in these troubled times. The book describes all the trials & tribulations of 14th. century life. It's proper \\"warts 'n all stuff! The battles, revolutions, intrigues, tortures & the daily struggle just to get through to the next day. I particularly enjoyed learning of the main \\"pillars of Chivalry.\\" Whilst one might expect to assume \\"valour\\" as a quality, try \\"knightly love,\\" which was pretty much a license to go off & indulge in loose living. Marvelous! It's a demanding read but absolutely worth the effort.

B000002J1U|5.0|After two ground breaking raw hard driving blues rock albums. Led Zeppelin III was an escape from the raging electric guitars from their first two efforts to a more acoustic environment.  There is no doubt about it that the majority of Led Zeppelin III is an acoustic experience.  Is this a bad thing?  Heck no! After occasionally putting one or two acoustic tunes on their first two albums the band strived to make Led Zeppelin III an all out acoustic effort.  The result is <BR>a beautiful unplugged album rather than a rough raw edgy hard rock album.<br />That doesn't mean that the band went completely soft for this album does have it share of rockers.  The opening track <BR>THE IMMIGRANT SONG is a classic rock tune.  CELEBRATION DAY has some wild slide guitar.  SINCE I'VE BEEN LOVING YOU is a classic Led Zeppelin blues masterpiece and OUT ON THE TILES is an underrated funky hard rock tune.  <br />However apart from those songs the rest of Led Zeppelin III is acoustic.  FRIENDS has some wonderful acoustic playing.  GALLOWS POLE is an interesting experimental song.  TANGERINE is a wonderful country rock style tune.  THAT'S THE WAY is a beautiful acoustic ballad.  BRON-Y-AUR is a fun acoustic jam.  The closing track HATS OFF TO (ROY) HARPER is bizarre acoustic blues which is okay but not great.<br />In closing Led Zeppelin III is definelty not the band's strongest effort but it is proof that behind those raging guitars that this group did have musical talent.  Some of the acousitc experimentation are successful some aren't but the majority o this album is excellent.  Several of these songs should have appeared on the band's &quot;Early Days Best Of&quot; CD but didn't.  Bottom line: I highly recommend you get this cd the album itself is very impressive and quite nice.<BR>Highly recommended but essentail to all Zep Heads.
6304057709|3.0|While the cast was stellar, the editing and screen play was not.  I much preferred the BBC version on VHS (c.1987, distributed by CBS/Fox Video).  This version with Irene Richard and Tracey Childs, was closer in content to the book than the more recent, Emma Thompson version.  The BBC version did omit the third sister, Margaret, however the rest of the film and it's characters were intact and mirrored the book.  Some of the scenes which I thought crucial to the story were omitted in the Emma Thompson version.  Willoughby's midnight ride to make amends with Marianne was left out of the newer version and others as well.  Thompson gets 3 stars, BBC still reigns supreme in my book, and Jane Austen's.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin toured extensively throughout 1969.  They played so many concerts that their time in the studio was rather limited.  Therefore the Led Zeppelin II sessions were quite rushed. This made the album come off as a more rough harder rocking album than the bands blues driving debut.  Despite the rather rushed production Led Zeppelin made one of their finest albums.<br />Led Zeppelin II turned out to be one of the group's biggest albums.  It changed music and influenced an entire generation of hard rock bands.  This is considered by many a blueprint for all hard rock band followers.  It is with a doubt a classic album!<br />The album opens with WHOLE LOTTA LOVE the group's biggest single.  The song may be a little repetitive but the guitar riff is awesome and the song itself is none the less one of the band's best tunes.  WHAT IS AND WHAT SHOULD NEVER BE is another awesome tune that obviously influenced groups like Nirvana.  THE LEMON SONG is a wild out of this world rock song.  Things calm down with the beautiful ballad THANK YOU.  However hard rock returns shortly with HEARTBREAKER another hard rock tune with a classic guitar riff.  HEARTBREAKER leads into LIVING LOVING MADE another wild rock tune that is actually a real fun listen.  RAMBLE ON is another acoustic song that is tied in with Lord Of The Rings somehow.  MOBY DICK has a killer drum solo by John Bonham and a classic guitar/bass riff by Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones.  The final track BRING IT ON HOME is an underrated classic blues rock tune and the guitar here is excellent!<br />In my opinion this is the best Led Zeppelin album.  There is not a single bad song in this collection here.  All the tunes have some impressive guitar work by Page.  Plant's vocals are very raw and energetic.  Bonham's drumming is wild and Jones' rhythm section is catchy and impressive.  If you don't have this album then you are not a Led Zeppelin fan! <BR>Get it!  You won't be disappointed!  Highly recommended!
0060934913|4.0|Bourdain gives it to us just the way he see it.  An irreverent look at what goes on in the world of food service in honest language.  No sugar coating here, nothing flowery or contrived; he just spits it out there the way he sees it.  Fast read, highly entertaining.
1573226521|1.0|Alex Garland's book, The Beach has shown me the wonders of marijuana. This may be a good thing to certain individuals, but to me, it is not. I have been introduced to dope, and right now I suffer from many dope-related illness's. It was a nice high, but now I'm just a pothead.
0064407667|3.0|I think that this book has a good start.The only thing that is sad in the begining is that there are three little kids at the beach.They are having a lot of fun and I mean a lot of fun.Until they recieve very very bad news.The bad news  was sent by their parents good friend Mr.Poe.He tells them that their parents has just died in the house because of a horriable fire.I think that this book is a book that I'm starting to like this book more than Harry Potter.The Bad Begining is one of those books that are very interesting.I find The Bad Begining a book that I would reccomed to others such like my mother.The reason I think my mother would like this book because she likes books that are very interesting such like this book is.The Bad Begining really starts off as a bad begining.The Bad Begining has a lot of things in it that I really don't enjoy.Like because they are orphans they are being treated very bad.

B00003CXXP|5.0|From the opening scenes to the heart wreching end I was enthralled by A.I. To watch this film one is left with a sense that by creating Robots are we breaching a line.  With the spiritual guide of Kubreck, Speilburg put all of his heart and soul in this flim.  His previous work made it so more pwerful, from E.T. to Schindler's List.  From The Sugerland Express to Saving Private Ryan.  A.I. is a true cinematic acheivement.  Now by one question is why wasn't it nominated for best picture?
B00005BJ2O|2.0|I thought I wanted to see the film. Nicole looked sooooo good in the trailers for it. I bought the soundtrack (it was one of 12 for a penny ;) It has moments. It has dialoguish-sounding stuff way too mushy for my tastes. Some of the music seems catchy and cool...some consists of gratingly butchered popular tunes. I haven't quite decided if I really like it or not yet...but it makes a poor advertisement for the film. I'll probably wait for it to come out highly edited on FOX some night. The soundtrack might wind up for sale on a card table on my front lawn.
0525241248|4.0|When trying to teach Taoism in a Western classroom, foreign words and concepts, as well as scholarly language, often hinder me.  Many students, and myself, get bogged down in what the author says rather than explore what Taoism is.  This book is a helpful tool.<br />It is a quick read.  Although you will not get all from the book until you reflect more on it, the language is easy to follow and the example of Pooh is witty and not threatening (rather than the names with unknown pronunciations).<br />I would recommend this to anyone wanting to move towards understanding Tao and Wu Wei.
B00003CXI0|3.0|Only because I felt like the only person in the world who hadn't read any of the books, I finally broke down to at least see the movie. Was it worth seven bucks? Not to me...<BR>I needn't go over the plot--even I knew what the film was about after having so many strangers gush to me about the book like it gifted readers with magical abilities itself. The story was okay--a bit predictable, but it is a kid's book after all. The special effects were sometimes almost cool, often somewhat primitive compared with other fx-filled forms (for example, any scene where a kid gets shaken by broom or beast makes the kid look as loose as wet laundry and not very life-like at all...not to mention the rather poorly animated snake at the beginning, etc...) I was able to see where some religious groups could take offense to a few of the references, and though I found the picture quaint at best, I'll admit I probably would have loved this film if I'd seen it at age seven. This generation's Wizard Of Oz? Hardly. A bit scary for younger viewers, a bit boring for older, the only thing I really took a liking to was the real-live Wizard's Chess scene. Buy this movie if you're a true fan, otherwise you may soon get sick of your youngster quoting from it. If a thirty-something who still watches cartoons in his pajamas and hunts for quarters to put in the ... toy dispensers by the supermarket exit wasn't impressed, would you be?
B00005RY7X|1.0|Seriously, this guy is having  laugh. This is corny, unimaginative boring music. There is no inventivness. All the song are based on the same material over and over again.<br />I honestly think it sounds like what the tellytubbies would come up with if they were in a band.<br />As for the corny 80s style \\"crowd singing\\"? I just don't see how this album can be claimed to be anything other than rubbish.<br />He also sounds like he is Swedish/Norwegian with a none to clever grasp of th eEnglish language. His lyrics are horrendous, repetitive and extremely childish. I could very easily mak a better attempt. Seriously please listen before you buy. I should have !!!!

B00005JKCF|5.0|I am now 51 years old. I was there in the beginning. The first comic books, the cartoons, television, it has taken all this time to find the perfect director and cast, visuals and audios, to recreate the way it was. I applaud you!<BR>...
6304233639|5.0|Oh, man! This is definitely one of the cooler testosterone-fueled movies I've seen in a long time! When I sit and stare at a screen for any great length of time, I like to be educated or just have a good time. I4 is pure entertainment, out to do nothing but excite you. The special effects were satisfyingly awesome and the overall pace quick--funny at the right time, hair-raising at others. I love action films and I enjoy sci-fi, but am seldom impressed with what I see. This movie is well worth the money--rent it first, and once you're hooked, add it to your Guilty Pleasures Collection!
B00003CY3W|5.0|If you love oddball stuff you will love this movie. Thora Birch is perfect as the sarcastic and confused teenager, but dont think that this is the typical teen angst movie--it's so much more. Steve Buscemi is goofy and fun to watch as usual. Most of all, I think this movie portrays how the teenagers that try to be so different and daring are really confused and desperately searching for their place in a world where everyone seems happy if you just give them \\"a McDonald's and a pair of Nikes.\\"

B00005A46U|5.0|Start to finish this is just a fantastic album. Caravan have quickly become one of my favourite bands (bought my first album of theirs around a year ago), and this album is one of the biggest reasons why.<br />Even if Caravan aren't your &quot;thing&quot; you really owe it to yourself to listen to track 7, the greatest piece of music the band ever wrote, _For Richard_.<br />The bonus tracks are great too, _A Day In The Life of Maurice Haylett_ in particular is a great song, and it's hard to believe it never surfaced untill now!<br />So what are you doing still reading this review?? Add this item to your cart immediately!
B0000027RL|1.0|How can it be, in the name of Heaven, that a CD originally released in 1991 can still cost US$ 15??!! Fifteen bucks!! We all know how must cost a virgin CD...I will just get my CD-ROM recorder and make a copy for myesel. As foR Pearl Jam, this band is an American product made for Americans: No substance at all...
B00005A0V0|4.0|This was my first Caravan experience, and for the most part, an excellent album. Most people would rate it as their best, but I would have to give that title to their second album, &quot;If I could Do it....&quot;.<br />I guess the reason that it falls short of the top spot for me is that, for starters it doesn't have &quot;If I Could...&quot;'s track _For Richard_ on it, and secondly the mammoth final track, _Nine Feet Underground_, doesn't do much for me overall. However I'm definately the minority on that, as most would list it as one of the top 3 Caravan songs. I think about half of it's great, the other half doesn't interest me much...<br />I owned the release prior to the new Decca re-release, and I must say they did a great job with it. The bonus tracks are excellent, and the sound quality top notch.<br />You owe it to yourself to pick this album up, as it contains some fantastic music, but in my opinion the ultimate Caravan album was the one prior to Land Of Grey &amp; Pink.
B00004RFCM|5.0|Everychapter is awesome but the case with the dvd is very cheapest..anyway  I love this ..
B00005QZ7U|4.0|&quot;Moulin Rouge,&quot; directed by Baz Luhrmann, seems to be one of the most wildly polarizing films of its time; I get the impression that people either love it or loathe it. I found the film inconsistent, but ultimately both entertaining and technically impressive.<br />MR is a musical set in late 19th century Paris, primarily at the nightclub of the title. The story involves the relationship between dance hall girl Satine (Nicole Kidman) and bohemian writer Christian (Ewan McGregor). Luhrmann mixes into the story songs (and snippets of songs) from many different decades of the 20th century, ranging from The Beatles' &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; to Madonnas's &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; and much more. The result is like a wild ride on a chaotic musical time machine. This together with the outrageous costumes and wild visual effects makes MR at times a startling assault on the senses.<br />I found the opening portion of the movie to be far too silly and hyperactive. But once Kidman and McGregor's characters meet, the film really starts to soar.<br />The performances are on the whole outstanding. One performance that really didn't work was that of John Leguizamo as Toulouse Lautrec. The versatile Leguizamo, normally excellent in such character roles, is far too cartoonish and over-the top here. But this misstep is more than made up for by the rest of the cast. Kidman is a revelation as Satine; she becomes a true screen diva in this role. Jim Broadbent brings energetic fun to his role as showman Harold Zidler; his rendition of &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; is one of the unforgettable highlights of the film.<br />But the true heart of the film is Ewan McGregor's superb performance as Christian. He brings a palpable passion and tenderness to the role of the romantic dreamer. It's a brave, triumphant performance for this tremendously versatile actor.<br />&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; is a daringly different film that succeeds overall as a piece of art. I give director Luhrmann a lot of credit for holding all of these elements together.mann a lot of credit for holding all of these elements together.
B00000ILDF|4.0|Alien 3 starts right were Aliens left off. Ripley, Newt, Bishop, and Corporal Hicks are peacefully sleeping in their cryotubes on the way back to earth when something goes terrbily wrong. Aparrently, the queen had lain an egg inside the dropship she hid in on the way back to the Suvlaco in Aliens. The egg hatches and cracks through Ripley's cryotube, impregnating her. Meanwhile, the glass it broke on its way to get to Ripley's face cut the facehugger and caused it to bleed. The acids soon starts a fire in the ship and an escape module is jetisined with Ripley and crew (including the facehugger) inside it. The escape module crashes on Weyland Yutani's \\"Fury\\" 161, where an all male work correctional facility is located. The ex-cons take care of her (well, some of them do) and Ripley slowly revives to find that Newt and Hicks are dead. Meanwhile, the facehugger that impregnated Ripley came off her face before arriving on \\"Fury\\" 161...and survived. After that, it impregnates one of the ex con's dog. Now, without weapons of any kind, Ripley must lead the ex-cons to battle the alien as she did in the original.<br />Now, I'll admit that this movie does have some problems. First, some of the speical effects are just plain bad. Although there is only about 4 or 5 horrible special effects shots, they really stand out and sometimes ruin the sequence. The close-ups on the other hand look great and scary. (The close-ups are used throughout most of the film.) Another thing people don't like about this movie is that Hicks and Newt were killed. This is actually a GOOD thing because if Hicks survived, he wouldn't be able to do anything because of his wounds. He'd probably be the first one to die. And Newt would probably be raped/mollested by one of the ex-cons. Aside from that, the only other flaw is some plot holes. First of all, the facehugger impregnates Ripley, comes off, and then goes on to impregnate a dog. Now in the first one is showed the facehugger coming off and dieing after it's first victim, but there's nothing that actually says that a facehugger can't impregnate two victims. Maybe it was a different/unique kind of facehugger.<br />The good things: The alien is a lot more intersting that those in the other two movies. Since it came from a dog, it can run on the walls and ceilings, as well as spit acid into victim's faces. Also, the movie tries to be like the first one, which is good. At the end, it makes an unmissable reference back to the first one. (If you've seen the movie, you'll know what I mean.) Last, the ending is the best in the series. Instead of the usual blowing the alien out of the airlock, here it is burned with gallons of hot lead. Then it is exploded by the cold water from the sprinklers. After that, there is a very dramatic scene in which Ripley kills herself and the psychotic company gunmen do away with some of the surviving cons. <br />The ending is so great because director David Fincher knew this had to end the trilogy, so he had to make it as dramatic and mermorable as possible, which he did. <br />All in all, a good flick, third best in the series. If you don't like this movie, please give it another chance. Sure, it can't compete with Aliens; it took away the hard-hitting action. But it's still a great film on its own. Should not be missed. Definetly should be a part of your alien collection.

0345440900|4.0|I was hesitant to read this book at first, since it had so many reviews comparing it to Gary Ezzo and Babywise. However, I think it is very different! Hogg's attitude towards babies is worlds apart from Ezzo's, and is very refreshing! She does encourage structure in the baby's day, but is much more flexible about it than Ezzo. She acknowledges the important fact that breastfed babies need to nurse much more often when they are going through a growth spurt. I do think that she has poor breastfeeding advice. I would suggest to a nursing mom that she not attempt to implement any feed spacing until the baby is at least two or three weeks old and is gaining well. Then, she should also remember that the schedule should be more like 2-2 1/2 hours rather than 2 1/2 - 3 hours. Also, take the author's own advice and be flexible! I checked this book out from the library, but am planning on buying a copy for myself!
B00005JKED|4.0|I was great to see denzel play the &quot;villian&quot; this movie. This is a very gripping real life movie. It brings to the light that to serve out justice you need to &quot;break&quot; or bend the law to get the job done.
B00005RHGK|1.0|If movies could make us dumber by simply watching them, this movie would be one of them.  I expected a rollicking horror film, but instead got a mediocre effort at best.  The first few minutes of the movie were genuinely scary, however, it went downhill after that.  The plot was predictable, and the ending was a feeble attempt at black comedy.  If i could give this film less than one star, I would.
B00005NP04|5.0|My grandmother bought this CD for Christmas and I instantly played it. Every single song that I have listened to in past years, and the ones I love were on this remarkable compilation!! Martina has one of the best voices in country music today, and she uses various emotions with it, depending on the song, as if she was \\"acting out\\" the song. (like in a drama or something). I love, \\"Independence Day\\", \\"Safe In The Arms of Love\\", \\"Broken Wing\\", \\"Valentine\\" and \\"Love Is The Only House\\"! \\"Blessed\\" is a song that anyone can apply to. Great effort!!!
0525946284|5.0|Ken Follett writes very exciting books, and this is certainly one of them. The action is almost non-stop, as is the suspense. Despite the breakneck pace of the book, the author does take the time to give us some character background for most of the folks, and that helps a lot in retaining our sympathies. He's even considerate enough to give the major Nazi figure some redeeming (at least in his own eyes) qualities, which serves to make him not the total monster we often meet in books of this type. If you want a read that will keep you turning pages from beginning to end, and one that you will enjoy, I recommend this bok.
B000008H1Y|5.0|Although I like everything that Tull has put out over the years, I think this album is full of energy and possibly some of the best rock'n roll flute Mr. Anderson has done ( The Whistler). It has lots of complicated rhythm and great lyric, that Tull is known for.
0446608955|5.0|Very Very different from the movie. A real page turner, and every emotional. It makes you want to think twice about judging someone before you know them. I'm NOT going to tell you the ending...I suggest that everyone pick this book up!
0671024256|4.0|I respect Stephen King a lot after reading this book. It is clear he wrote it not to settle any scores, make money (as if he needed any more) or to get his take of himself and his work in the historical record.<br />He seems to have been genuinely motivated by the desrie to give some friendly advice to aspiring writers and to chat about his favorite topic; writing.<br />Some of the lessons I gleaned from this book:<br />If you want to be a novelist do three things religiously: read, read, read.<br />Just finish the damn story. It is not rocket science.<br />Your genre will choose you and not vice versa so do not force yourself into a genre because you think you want to strike it rich. You won't.<br />The whole literary/schlock dicotomy is a ruse. Write from the heart. Some people have Carrie in their heart, others have The Corrections.<br />Keep chugging. King sent stories for years and endured hardship after hardship before selling Carrie.<br />The size of your desk doesn't matter. You won't find your novel in the bottom of a beer can or whiskey bottle, either.<br />Secure a good reader that you trust.<br />It is not as hard to make it as you think -- provided you know what you're doing.<br />Seek many opinions but be prepared for each one to be different.<br />Every man deserves a wife like Tabitha King.<br />The first half of the book is a long autobiographical essay which I enjoyed quite a bit. King talks about himself with both humility and insight and disarming frankness. Following his journey is as useful as any advice.
B000007SPT|5.0|Yet another reason to knock off the head of someone next to you who says, &quot;I just don't like 80s music,&quot; as if there were some single genre from any decade! Please. To add insult to injury, ersatz headless wo/man is also doing injustice to all of the great work (like this) which came out of our supposedly shameful past (though I'd be, and am, more ashamed of the 90s and these past few neonatal years on the whole). This record is lovely.
B00005Q66T|3.0|GHV2 - MADONNA<BR>Well, the queen of reinvention's third \\"best of\\" set is a real disappointment. Not that the divas' songs are horrible or the fact that this compilation is a pure cash in release. The fact is, the set of 15 tracks does not justify all that this immaculate material girl has achieved over the last decade or so. The last decade for Maddy hasn't been exactly smooth sailing as her earlier works in the decade was largely ignored and critically panned and she almost lost confidence in herself. It is a real amazement how this woman manages to bent, twist and morph herself from one character to another year after year without loosing her cool which is alone well worth applauding and praise. Anyway, back to this CD, as highlighted before, there are a lot of material missing like many other reviewers have commented and that's what is stopping this already brilliant collection from being a superb collection. I mean, where on earth is \\"Rain\\", \\"I'll Remember\\" and \\"Nothing Really Matters\\"? I am complaining because this is not a true representation of Madonna's success. The booklet is amazing and it just shows how much the girl has changed over the years though the cover is really something to wonder over. Aside from that, there is also no new singles though the inclusion of the GHV2 Thunderpuss Megamix wouldn't harm since it's almost impossible to find since it's only available through a promo CD. Therefore, the songs breakdown per album is as follows:<BR>EROTICA<BR>- #2 Erotica<BR>- #1 Deeper &amp; Deeper<BR>BEDTIME STORIES<BR>- #4 Secret<BR>- #10 Take A Bow<BR>- #3 Bedtime Stories<BR>- #6 Human Nature<BR>EVITA<BR>- #5 Don't Cry For Me Argentina<BR>RAY OF LIGHT<BR>- #9 Frozen<BR>- #11 Ray Of Light<BR>- #14 Drowned World / Substitute For Love<BR>- #7 The Power Of Good-Bye<BR>AUSTIN POWERS SOUNDTRACK<BR>- Beautiful Stranger<BR>MUSIC <BR>- #15 Music <BR>- #12 Don't Tell Me<BR>- #13 What It Feels Like For A Girl<br />Therefore, there are many pros and cons about thisrelease. The main pros are:<BR>1. Some of the songs are edits and are not just the album versions.<BR>2. The endless collection of pictures inside the booklet is really worth getting because it's one amazing wall of pictures.<BR>3. The captivating album cover.<BR>4. It's a Madonna release for heaven's sake.<BR>And the cons:<BR>1. Many tracks are missing therefore the album title is rather misleading because many of Madonna's biggest hits are not present. <BR>2. We've got every song there is if you've got all of Madonna's previous albums.<BR>3. The fact that there are no new materials is rather disappointing.
B000002LCK|5.0|Forget their new record. What the hell was that about, anyway? This is the real New Order, the old New Order. I don't really have the patience at the moment to say just how much I love this collection of songs, so spare me and buy it immediately, then blast it on the car-stereo in a musical drive-by for the mental and spiritual benefit of your neighborhood, campus, prison, whatever. It's good times.
B00005RZTI|5.0|Kylie is without a doubt, Australia's biggest selling female artist surpassing fellow Australians Tina Arena, Merril Bainbridge and even Natalie Imbruglia. While US residents may see Kylie's latest chart domination as a sudden move since such a long absence from the charts, the rest of the world has been served with one Kylie album after another and we knew Kylie is back in top form with her last release \\"Light Years\\" which was an 80's affair while her latest effort \\"Fever\\" tops that giving us one of the best selling singles of 2001, the simply irresistible, addictive and potentially annoying dance anthem \\"Can't Get You Out Of My Head\\". Unfortunately, the other tracks on the album is not as strong as \\"Can't...\\" but never the less, most of them are appealing in their own ways. \\"In Your Eyes\\" the second single to be lifted from the album is not as instantly appealing as \\"Can't...\\" but is addictive and likeable in it's own ways. \\"Fever\\" is a mid tempo jam and would probably be the slowest track on the album. \\"Come Into My World\\" is a reincarnation of \\"Can't...\\" and follow the same root and could potentially serve as the fourth single after \\"Fever\\". Other tracks on the album are brilliant dance floor smashes which makes this CD an essential one for all parties. The down side to this collection is that it is not as diverse as Kylie's previous album \\"Light Years\\". A brilliant set of mindless yet catchy dance smashes that are sure to get you grooving in no time. Potential buyers please be aware, there are several different version of \\"Fever\\" available internationally. The original album contains 12 tracks. The Australian edition contains \\"Tightrope\\" as a bonus track. The US edition contains two extra tracks, so you lucky people. Kylie's previous album \\"Light Years\\" is also worth checking out considering it contains 5 Top 20 smashes including two #1's in the form of \\"Spinning Around\\", \\"On A Night Like This\\", \\"Please Stay\\", \\"Kids (With Robbie Williams)\\" &amp; \\"Your Disco Needs You\\" plus the original version of the club smash \\"Butterfly\\".<BR>Track listing:<BR>1.

B000007SPU|3.0|For me at least, the woman pictured on the cover is staring forward aghast, saying to herself, \\"What the hell happened?\\" You (and I) can interpret this in two ways: (1) that this record is really a descent from its predecessor, It'll End in Tears, and (2) that the goodness of Filigree & Shadow itself actually falls off as one nears its end. It becomes overwrought, and at times I don't know if I'm hearing something from 4AD or an... impersonation of Culture Club. I'm also told that Blood is even more disappointing, so head for the origin with this series, folks.
0060930187|1.0|Dull, boring, &amp; overrated. Why are so many reviewers in love with this book? Is it because the author killed herself in real life? It certainly can't be the quality of the writing or story. Imagine if you wrote a book about your day to day life, getting up in the morning, including your thoughts on breakfast, your discussions with neighbors, ... etc. Boring right? To me this book was just that, a mundane description of a mundane life.
B000002U9E|5.0|Oh my God. This album is wonderful. It also reminds me that with Kate Bush we actually had (as of the latest reports of her delayed new release, at least) a strange phenomenon (as opposed to the usual pattern of good release, shakey second, bad follow-ups) taking place: mediocre early albums transitioning into something very good but very pretentious (The Dreaming), finally hitting a summit with this record, then leveling off a bit (TSW and TRS). It's gorgeous, and, additionally, probably the first work that began to make headway against my (sometimes debilitating) Torimania (not that there's anything wrong with having that). If you have anything resembling a taste for the dreamy, impressionistic, or, quite simply, the good, then get this immediately.
B000059QY3|5.0|This shows us what all the shouting was about and no wonder Solti called Decca and said, &quot;Get over here!&quot; Gheorghiu is splendid from beginning to end. But she also had a wonderful director in Richard Eyre who certainly made some interesting choices along the way - Violetta alone at the top of the opera waiting for her guests; her running round the room at the end with one last burst of energy before she dies. Plus the director had a woman who could act. Plus she's really beautiful and knows how to handle her body. Watch the way she uses her arms. Watch as she unpins her hair as she sings sempre libre becoming once again a young girl for just a moment. This is an actress. It's wonderfully designed and costumed as well. Her Alfredo is good but is at his best during the last act. At the end you knew you had seen and heard something wonderful and wished you had been at Covent Garden that night. Fortunately it was taped. I recommend this highly. It's wonderful opera and wonderful theatre.
B000002HJD|2.0|First of all, I haven't listened to this album in a long time, but in a weird way, I kind of have. Confused? See, I found a great bootleg online that has the whole poetry session used for this assemblage, and it also includes Jim's last ever recording session (Paris, 1971 with a bunch of not-too-great French hippie session guys) and &quot;Orange County Suite&quot; before the remaining Doors put all their overdubs on it, about 30 years after the fact. For the curious, its called &quot;The Paris Tapes.&quot; As for the Doors version of this album, its alright. The Doors described it pretty well when they called it &quot;A movie for your ears.&quot; The music is carried off well, but I'm not into the whole thing anymore because of the way Jim's words are chopped up. That great Doors live performance on here of &quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot; is now also avaliable on the excellent &quot;Doors Live In Concert&quot; collection.
B000002HH9|5.0|This is just a great cd, with all kind if music style in it, like only &quot;The Cure&quot; know how to make.

IT is a movie of love, hate, war, peace, gives you action, romance, and history all in one. It has many good actors and actresses and some parts are filmed live in Scotland. This is a very good movie if you like all of the above.
B000050HTO|4.0|Knowing that it is impossible to compile Dylan's 40 year career into one greatest hits package, this two disc collection does a fine job of trying. If you are a newcomer, this is a good place to start. Hopefully it will encourage you to delve deeper into Dylan's legacy. Even if you are already a Dylan fan, however, this collection is nice because it includes &quot;Things Have Changed&quot;(previously, it was only avaible on the WonderBoys Soundtrack). It's also nice to get all these great songs on two discs. It includes bits and pieces from Dylan's entire career, from his early classics to newer pieces, like &quot;Not Dark Yet&quot;. It is a fine overview of an incredible artist.
6303921248|5.0|If you have the time to spare, the movie is a masterpiece in itself. Colin Firth as the stoic and solemn hero &quot;Mr Darcy&quot; plays an excellent fairytale gentleman. I was enraptured by the performance of Jennifer Ehle, the daughter of a middle-class gentleman who strikes Darcy's facy. Their barbed exchanges left me speechless, and one can't help but wish at times that they would just shut up and fall in love like they're supposed to. In the end it was a fabulous performance by all, and left me begging for more. Bravo.
B00000I07P|5.0|this album catapaulted bon jovi to the top of the rock and roll heap.after two moderately successful albums (1984's self titled debut and 1985's 7800 farhenheit), jon and the boys hit paydirt with &quot;slipprey when wet&quot;,released in 1986.from start to finish,this album is all killer,no filler! it contains the #1 hits &quot;you give love a bad name&quot;, &quot;livin on a prayer &quot;,and &quot;wanted dead or alive&quot;. it is also one of the best sounding albums i've ever heard.it sounds as if it were a live record.what more can i say? this album is nothing short of brilliant and one that any hard rock fan should not be wothout!
B00000099Y|5.0|This album is amazing, insane, and it totally rocks.  This is one of the best albums of the last 10 years, and makes me want to break something everytime I hear it.  (Thats definitely a good thing).  The intricate melodies and head banging rifs just get me pumped.  The highlight musically is &quot;H&quot;, and the highlight entertainment-wise is &quot;Message to Harry Manback&quot;.  Buy the album just to laugh to the great lyrics in that song.  It's all-around greatness on this disc.
0553296981|5.0|I read this book after many of my friends read it. They described it to me as a very sad book. Also, I saw the movie of it on ABC channel 7. I cried at the way they were being treated. When I saw one of my friends with it, I asked if I could borrow it. Luckily, they did.<br />The main character in this story is Anne Frank. She was a Hebrew girl who lived during the Holocaust. She loved to write in her diaries and keep an open mind. After her and her family were caught by the Germans, they were sent to special \\"camps\\" where they were treated like dogs. Still, after being harrassed and violated, Anne remained strong. I really admired her for what she had to be put through. I also felt so bad for her.<br />I really enjoyed reading this book because it reflects on a true story. Unlike other fictional stories, this is an actual diary of a real girl. As I read the book, I begin to feel her pain and anguish. I actually got a real glimpse of what happened during the holocaust. After reading this book, I felt as though I was really there. I cried for a long time after I finished this book. It was one of the best books that I have ever read.
B00005Y228|4.0|When I first heard \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\" on the radio, I thought perhaps it was the latest track from Macy Gray. When I heard the song was by Kylie Minogue, I thought: \\"WHO???\\" <BR>A week later, a friend of mine was talking about her current favorite song, and emailed me the MP3 file. Lo and behold, the same song. Having recently purchased the album and listened to it several times, I have to say that this is a refreshing, crisp album.<BR>Most of the tracks, especially \\"Love Affair,\\" have a discernible dance club beat, but not overwhelmingly so. Nor does the music overpower the lyrics. Minogue's vocals are smooth, clear and understandable.<BR>Wanting to know more about this \\"debut\\" artist, I learned that she has several albums going back to 1989! Minogue, who hails from Australia is very popular in England, and surprisingly is just getting her foot in the door here in the U.S. I'm intrigued and want to hear more.<BR>Besides \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head,\\" there are a couple of other tracks which I expect to hear on the radio any time now: \\"Fragile\\" and \\"Your Love.\\" Three other tracks are too long to likely receive air play (4+ minutes.) The rest of the CD is pleasant on the ears. Some tracks seem to have a Kate Bush influence. A couple of songs are sleepers, but the rest shine.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|For those who were around when punk hit the UK it would come as no surprise to know that the Clash have stood the test of time while the Sex Pistols didn't. The Pistols did one superb album but the rest of their output was dire. The Pistols had huge amounts of energy but their nihilistic message ultimately got you nowhere. The Clash usually had more hope in their lyrics- their message was normally about people taking their destiny in their own hands to improve their situation. The Clash were always open to a far greater range of musical influences than the Pistols who just got stuck in a punk rut. 'London Calling' was probably the greatest Clash album. My personal favorite Clash song, 'the Guns of Brixton', (surprisingly not written by either Jones or Strummer), is on here, as are other superb Clash highlights, especially 'Spanish Bombs' and 'London Calling'. The album also has one of the best sleeves of all time. This is one of the best punk albums ever, although to describe it as a punk album overlooks the wide range of musical styles on here. This was one of the most influential and creditable bands of their generation. If you like this album check out Stiff Little Fingers (offered referred to as the Irish Clash) and Mano Negra (considered as the French Clash).
B000053VAF|4.0|The fourth film in Kevin Smith's Jersey Trilogy, 'Dogma' comes as close to a mainstream movie as he has done to date, including 'Jay & Silent Bob Strike Back'. The story is self-contained with none of the recurring characters, save J & S.B..<br />A lot of issues are brought to the surface here, not the least of which the directors dissatisfaction with the current state of Catholicism and it's effect on ones faith.<br />Simply put (yes simply; I'm leaving a lot out): two angels banished from Heaven seek to utilize the dogma of Plenery Indulgence to gain re-entry, with the help and encouragement of a muse residing in hell. If they do so it ends everything, because it proves God's wrong. Meanwhile, God has been put in a coma while out playing skee-ball. So Heaven is on it's own.<br />To thwart this, an angel from Heaven enlists J & S.B., the great great great (etc.) grandniece of Jesus, another muse and a deceased unknown apostle. Insanity ensues.<br />At the end, God is back on the job, everybody's better for the experience, and if I understand correctly, another Immaculate Conception has taken place(Note; although God is depicted as Alanis Morrisette, Catholics ought not see this as celestial lesbianism. It's noted that God really has no sex).<br />I found it entertaining. Jason Lee, as always, puts in a wicked performance. Alan Rickman was better here than in 'Galaxy Quest'; Metatron is a hoot. I could have done without the Gogolthin and Serendipity, but they don't hurt the film. Affleck and Damon seemed to be having fun. And Jay outdes himself, making the Almighty blush.<br />I didn't see any overt disrespect to the Church in this film; rather, it asks a lot of questions we should be asking ourselves, especially in terms of mysticism and overkill.<br />But don't let that stop you from enjoying the film simply as escapism.
B000002KIE|5.0|If you like punk this album is a must for your collection. It is landmark album of huge significance. Powerful musical anarchy. The highlights are obviously 'Anarchy in the UK' and 'God Save the Queen' but there are a number of other powerful punk songs on here. Definitely not for the faint hearted- if Phil Collins is your favorite artist I'd be surprised if you liked this.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I just loved everything about this movie.  I fell in love with Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman. It was the most romantic, funny, weird and drama movie I have ever watched.  I saw this movie 14 times...THIS IS A MUST BUY!  All though the songs aren't new it felt as if I heard these songs for the first time.  Ewan McGregor and Nicole Kidman are brilliant together and I would love to see them do more movies together.  Ewan blows Tom Cruise away in this movie!!!!!
B000002UAR|5.0|I think the Beatles were one of those bands who were best in their mid-career. Their early albums were a little bit sugary and included too many straight cover versions. It was with 'Help', 'Rubber Soul' and 'Revolver' that the Beatles started to become not just a successful band but a significant one. This album is a classic by any standards and there's something for everyone. I don't like all the songs on here ('Goodday sunshine', 'doctor Robert' and 'Yellow Submarine' never appealed to me), but most of the rest is excellent and truly inspired. You expect John Lennon to be producing excellent material (and here he doesn't disappoint) but the Paul McCartney songs on here are also amongst his best ('For no one' is probably the finest song he ever wrote- he was always best at 'end of relationship' songs). The album ends with probably the most significant Beatles' song ever: 'Tomorrow Never Knows'. This was the hint of what was to follow and provides a clear indication of why the group are remembered as one of the best of all time. I would love to have seen the faces of those who bought the album when it first came out and heard this track which even today sounds highly original and off-beat. This is a must for all people seriously interested in music.
B000002UA9|5.0|If ever a young soul were to ask you: &quot;What is rock and roll?&quot;  You can can hand them this and say &quot;here you go&quot;.  The Beatles' debut album was rushed out upon the success (in the UK) of the single &quot;Please Please Me&quot; (hence the title).  Tacked on to both sides of the first two singles were the best of their stage act.  And, believe it or not, this was accomplished in one day (!) as it was all recorded in just under 585 minutes on Monday February 11, 1963.  It was mixed the next week and released in the UK on Friday March 22, 1963.  Believe it or not Capitol (the US distributor of EMI stuff) passed on this and it wasn't until I Want to Hold Your Hand in January, 1964 that Beatlemania hit the US of A.   <br />The essentials (in addition to the awesome title song) are track one (which had the working title of &quot;17&quot;) and the closer which was recorded in one take at the very end of the long, long session.  Man, you can hear in John's throat too!  This is the definitive version of &quot;Twist &amp; Shout&quot; and is raw, raw rock and roll.  In between is a mix of covers and originals.  <br />John's &quot;There's a Place&quot; is nice, but maybe not essential.  Finally, I've heard a number of George Harrison compilations from burners over the last few months but often they leave off &quot;Do You Want to Know a Secret&quot; (probably because it was composed by John).  However, I think it's a forgotten gem.<br />Now then, wouldn't it be cool if Capitol/EMI were to release a single CD best of the early years (pre-Hard Day's Night)?    Maybe even in Stereo?  Oh well we can dream.
B00000K3G8|5.0|One of my biggest regrets is never having seen Talking Heads live. If the video of this album is anything to go by they were one of the best live bands ever (unfortunately they didn't tour the UK enough). The collection contains many of their best ever songs including the fantastic 'Psycho Killer'. Excellent rhythms drawn from a wide range of influences. The group ranged from Punk to World Music. Their stage presence is fantastic. This performance is a must for anyone who likes the band.
B00004XMTJ|5.0|And I have the book it is based on too both on audio tape and paperback. I loved Grisabella when she sang the song, \\"Memory\\". I have Andrew Lloyd-Webber's Encore CD and love the rendition Barbara Streisand sings of \\"Memory\\" too. Mestophole certainly was a little devil, but he sure could dance.<br />Of course, all of the Lloyd-Webber musicals can stand alone, so to compare them to other shows I've seen live would be unfair.  My favorite musical is still \\"Phantom\\" though.  That half-mask is really distracting.
0671027573|5.0|This is definitely a great read.  I love funny mysteries and this is by far one of my favrorites.  From the first to the last page you won't be disappointed.  The characters are fun and plot is well written.  Although I figured out the ending, it didn't take away from the fun I had reading this.
B000002JSV|4.0|I remember the first time I heard this album, and I do mean album. I was surprised with the bluesy feel. It was different than Dirty Deeds &amp; High Voltage. I enjoed it very much. Bon's voice was brilliant on this album, just like on every album that he was on. I was surprised to hear Gone Shottin' in the Beavis &amp; Butthead movie and on the soundtrack, but that just goes to show that sometimes it's not the hit songs that are really the hit songs. GIVE THIS CD A TRY.
B00000AFFF|1.0|After your brain explodes! Don't believe the hype!
B000003TAB|4.0|I am going around reviewing Nirvana's obscure records, because I somehow figure Incesticide could use another review more than Nevermind, with its 650+.<BR>LOL, at 5,000-something Amazon.com sales rank, I wonder if there's anyone out there who knows this little corner of Amazon.com even exists, let alone wants to buy the CD, but it doesn't make it any less cool and, in my opinion, HILARIOUS, :o).<br />I dislike 3 songs on this CD-- Mexican Seafood (which I guess is just not my type of, um, humor); new wave Polly, because while the acoustic and electric versions of this song *rock*, this one seems out of place. It's a serious song, it doesn't sound good at a ridiculous punk speed. <BR>And, well, Downer, which just doesn't go anywhere (and yet managed to get onto not one, but 2 Nirvana records, drat). <BR>But come on, disliking 3 out of 15 songs for someone as picky as me is a new record. Especially for a B-sides collection. <BR>The interesting thing about Incesticide, in my opinion, is that lots of its songs are more accessible than the majority of Bleach, and far more accessible than Endless Nameless from Nevermind. And maybe even Territorial Pissings. If you like these songs, which I do, and if you wanna listen to something other than Nevermind, which is a long shot, then it's completely safe to buy Incesticide. :oP<BR>I like it as much as Bleach, and basically think that while it's not as essential as Nevermind, In Utero, or Unplugged (whaddya know, for once I agree with Amazon's essential-picks!) it's money well wasted if you wanna see a funny side of Nirvana. <br />So let me get on with this: Beeswax, Aneurysm, Sliver, Stain, Turnaround, and especially Hairspray Queen with its orgasmic ending (literally), are HILARIOUS songs. I totally agree with the reviewer who said the beginning of Aneurysm and it's pace-changes crack him up. Songs like Dive, Big Long Now, and Aero Zeppelin shouldn't BE on a B-sides album, period.<BR>And Molly's Lips and Son of a Gun are justanother piece of proof that Kurt Cobain was kickass at song covers (see Unplugged). <BR>When my strictly-Smells like Teen Spirit friend heard Hairspray Queen she was like \\"what's with the squealing\\"? But the second time she heard it, she started paying attention and thought it was funny. I can't promise you'll feel the same way, but if you like music anything more than while vacuuming, you just might appreciate Incesticide's eccentricities. Which, by the way, don't exist in mainstream music.<br />Oh, and the Rolling Stone dudes don't know what the hell they're talking about.
B00005N5SF|3.0|Plato's Stepchildren has an intriguing set-up, but the episode simply goes way too far in silliness when Kirk and Spock are being forced to perform. Apparently this was necessary in order to fill up time, but it's an insult to the viewers and an example of how the creator's abused the endless possibilities idea of the future. It has interesting moments, though, but forget the infamous interracial kiss--it was forced and completely unemotional. In this episode, Nichelle Nichols is absolutely gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous in that classic gown, but she is outdone by the more stunning Barbara Babcock, who gives a wonderful performance here.<br />Wink of An Eye is also very intriguing, and superior to Plato's Stepchildren, but it bites off more than it can chew. The situation with hyperaccelerated existence and normal existence is very interesting and fun, but it is carelessly done, and the episode becomes more confusing than anything else. An average, but passable episode.
B00005LC6Z|4.0|Halloween II will never be as good as the original but what sequel is. However, this sequel picks up right where the original left off in the search for the psychotic Michael Myers. Halloween II brings back Jaime Lee Curtis (Laurie Strode) and Donald Pleasance (Dr. Sam Loomis). Michael is after Laurie and hunts her down in the hospital. Michael will stop at nothing to get to her no matter how much mangaling and butchering he has to do. We learn of Michael's motive and why he has returned to Haddonfield. The sequel spills more blood than the original and Michael Myers is just as terrifying. If you saw the original you have to see the sequel. It is one of the FEW horror movies in which the sequel has the same main characters played by the same actor/actress and has the same plot as the original.
015626224X|5.0|In this book George Orwell describes how it really is being a lower class individual in two of the most famous cities in the world.  I believe that every single person who reads this book will have a different look on a homeless person afterwards.  The only people who are able to read this book obviously are not in this situation, and reading something like this expands your knowledge of something you know nothing about.  The book reads very quickly and is very informative.  I personally do not read that often in my young busy life, and this is a book that I actually finished so that has to say something.  I highly reccomend this book.
630026999X|4.0|From two of the greatest horror minds ever, George A. Romero (Night of The Living dead) and Stephen King (The Shining, Cujo, Carrie ...) comes Creepshow. Five tales from the Macabre which will have you screaming in fear instead of laughing. Tales of a murdered father back from the grave to get his Father's Day cake. A simpleton growing into a weed caused by an outerspace meteor. Two humans turned sea creatures back for revenge against the man that murdered them. An old crate that contains a living nightmare with an appetite for destruction. A cold hearted millionaire living with about five million cockroaches. Creepshow is different than any horror movie you've ever seen or probably will ever see (not counting Creepshow 2). It stars well known actors such as Hal Holbrook, Leslie Neilsen , Ted Danson, Adrienne Barbeau, Ed Harris and even Stephen King himself makes a cameo appearance in this one. Don't miss out on an oppurtunity to watch this horrifying comic book come to life.
0679745203|5.0|Director Minghella may have had a lot to thank Ondaatje's writing for the inspired technical brilliance of the movie version of \\"The English Patient\\". One realizes this after reading the book.     Over the last one year, the book has become a constant in my life. Not only do I recommend this highly to everyone I know, I have read sections of it to people on occassion. Sometimes over the phone... long distance. Perhaps this will give you some idea about the savoury old-wine sensuality of Ondaatje's words. Just read how he describes words -- like Zerzurra, or even, Libya..    It is a simple enough story of four wounded lives coming together in a war-torn Italian village for some days. They relive a little of their past, mingle their pain and desolation, heal what little they can, and finally, part ways. And yet, how exquisite the story telling -- with the lightest touch, how subtle the art!     The deserts of Ondaatje's Africa is a sea of sand without borders, that even while rife with politics, holds its timeless secrets close to the heart and remains utterly inaccessible. It's a lost world that he writes about - and this is a book about loss. The count Almasy (who was cursed with the wrong name) summarises it best when he says to the thief Caravaggio (of the missing thumbs), \\"Everything I have ever loved or valued has been taken away from me\\".
B00005KHL0|5.0|The original Halloween is one of the greatest horror movies of all time and my personal favorite. Even though I've seen it numerous times I can't get enough. On Halloween night in 1963, six year old Michael Myers brutally murdered his sister in the small town of Haddonfield Illinois. Now, 15 years later, he has escaped from a mental institution to reek havoc amongst the trick or treaters. Jaime Lee Curtis stars in her first role as Laurie Strode and is pursued by Michael Myers throughout the entire movie. Donald Pleasance plays Dr. Sam Loomis (Michael Myers doctor) and warns Haddonfield Police of Michael's return. Hesitant to believe the wild accusation Dr. Loomis must hunt Michael down before he can do anymore harm. Halloween will scare and delight you at the same time. The music score for Halloween is still creepy almost 25 years later and is synonymous with the movie. If you only see one horror movie in your lifetime, see this absolute classic, Halloween.
B000062Y98|5.0|In the history of melodic heavy metal, there has never been an album as over-the-top as this before and there may never be an album as over-the-top as this again. Fans of Rhapsody, Lost Horizon, Domine, and Tobias Sammet will love this.<br />Get it while you can.
6302038308|4.0|I must say I actually saw Evil Dead 2 before I saw the original Evil Dead. Evil Dead 2 is an absolute must see for fans of blood and gore. The blood and gore in this movie is Extreme to the max and will leave you screaming for more. Evil Dead 2 is just as funny as it is scary. It does not have much of a plot as Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend drive to a secluded cabin in the middle of nowhere. Ash plays a tape and unleashes the evil dead. He and his girlfriend are then stalked by menacing demons and inanimate objects that come to life. What a great excuse to throw blood and gore all over the screen. Even though I've talked to people that say it's a stupid movie I believe Evil Dead 2 (Dead By Dawn) is clever, comical and outlandishly terrifying. If your not looking for an intriguing and interesting plot, but looking for plenty terrifying visuals , great special effects and GORE this is your film.
B00005JKBC|5.0|I saw this movie on the big screen and loved it. Great story, action, and keeps you thinking the whole way through. The movie kinda reminded me of Usual Suspects. Redford is awesome like he usually is with all his movies. Can't wait to see it again when it comes out on video.
6300267881|5.0|What can I say about this 1973 classic? The Exorcist is the most terrifying movie I've ever seen. I first saw it when I was 8 years old and it gave me nightmares. even 17 years later this movie still gives me spine-tingling sensations. Linda Blair (In her most known role) plays a 12 year old girl possessed by the devil himself. Her mother (Ellen Burstyn) takes her to every doctor imaginable and they have no prognosis on 12 year old reagan's condition. Believing that reagan is somehow possessed by a supernatural being she turns to father Damion Karros for an exorcism to release the demon from her 12 year old girl. This movie spawned two sequels but could never match the mystique or absolute horror of the original. The Exorcist is eerie, creepy and everything you've heard it to be. The Exorcist theme, Tubular Bells (Mike Oldfield), is just as eerie and mysterious as the movie. This is an ABSOLUTE MUST SEE!!!!
0446677450|4.0|Rich Dad, Poor Dad, does an excellent job of clearly describinging how money works.  Throuh the prespective of nine year old boys, grappling with the concepts of having money work for them.  The ideas are presented clearly, in a manner that people can relate to.  The book presents ideas, and concepts eveyone who earns money should be aware of.  While stressing the importance of educating children about the powers money can have.  The concepts, presented in the form of lessons, are easy to follow, and apply to everyday life.
B00003CXCQ|4.0|Okay, first, let me say that this is a wonderful DVD.<br />There's nothing I can add to all of the praise heaped on this collection--a beautiful transfer of the movie which looks as good as when I saw the digitally-refurbished re-release back in the 90s.  The discs are chock-full of games, trivia, archival footage, promotional material from each time the film was re-released, and on and on.<br />I do have a warning, however:  at the time SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS was released, there really was no such thing as widescreen cinema.  It was produced and exhibited in the 4:3 aspect ratio (standard TV shape).  If you have a widescreen TV, you'll either need to watch it distorted (about 33% wider than intended), framed by vertical bars (windowbox?), or trimmed at the top and bottom.<br />It's a minor annoyance, though:  don't let it deter you from owning this masterpiece.
B00004WKII|5.0|You will get the most out of this collection if you are an electric guitar player who likes Jimi Hendrix and you are familiar with is work.  I'm not saying others won't like it (Hendrix fans, drummers, bassists, etc.), but if you know what a Stratocaster is, or a Fuzz Face, or an Octavia, and you like these things, then you will hear sounds on this set that will inspire you.  I don't think you will hear them by listening to the sound clips because a lot of the good stuff happens after 2 minutes into the songs.  A perfect example is my favorite track on the album \\"Bold As Love\\" Disk 2 Track 7.  This track combines huge fuzz tone with an amazing 4-minute guitar solo that may be the best of its kind.  Another favorite is \\"Hear My Train A Comin'\\".  Again, this song contains an incredible octave-fuzz sounding solo that will knock you out.  Other reviewers miss the things that guitar players will appreciate the most.  They complain that there are too many versions of the same song.  How many times have you practiced the same song or riff over and over again listening to the subtle differences?  This is one way in which this album gives you enormous insight into the creativity of Hendrix.  You will hear things you have never heard on the radio.  Most songs have a page worth of background info in the accompanying book.  You will learn that Hendrix was very particular about the final product, whereas in these CDs you can literally hear him creating and polishing his music.  Ironically, this makes him MORE human to me (even though I never went with the \\"Jimi is God\\" crowd in the first place).  I totally disagree with anyone who says that this would be a good first Hendrix album.  This album is for people with mature tastes.  First, get the stuff that Hendrix wanted you to hear, then come to these CDs and learn his secrets.
B00004XONN|1.0|It was with great anticipation that I bought this CD. I'd heard The Bends and enjoyed it. I'd read the reviews, which seemed to be universally enthusiastic in their praise. I was massively disappointed. This is musical navel contemplation. It seems that you open yourself up to sounding obtuse by savaging this effort, but it was a huge waste of time. The silver lining is that it's only 40 minutes long or so.
0553565915|4.0|This is a truly beautiful version of Christian type afterlife. A well written story of her near death experience.
B00003CXXP|3.0|I'm not going to totally trash this film because it does have replay value.  I can watch it over and over again to try and figure it out.  The acting is pretty good.  The boy (forgot his name) will go far in life with those type of acting skills.  I don't own the movie but I've watched it several times.  The robot lover was entertaining as well.  The special effects and graphics were top notch.  Spielberg always does a good job in that area.  But the problem I am having is that I'm trying pretty hard to figure out what the movie is about.  David is trying to become real so he sets out on a 'pilgrimage' to find the 'blue fairy'.  The reason he believes in this is because his mommy read Pinocchio to him.  I know that much.  I also understand that he is saying that the end of the world is near because we are trying to get rid of the macines because humans won't live forever and all that will be left is machines because humans will destroy themselves.  Im guessing thats what it is but if someone can give me more insight into this then that will be greatly appreciated.  I would recommend that every one see this movie at least once; maybe youll understand it better than I have.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|The problem with many mysteries and thrillers is the climax is sort of a letdown compared to the rest of the movie. This is not the case with Memento, which has such an unfathomable ending that you'll want to watch it again right away. The film concerns Leonard (a superb Guy Pearce) who suffers from a disoder that leaves him unable to remember any new thing after a few minutes. To help himself remember, Leonard develpos a system using photographs and tatoos. The film is a revolutionary concept. We actually travel backwards with Leonard until the startling conclusion. You see, Leonard is looking to extract revenge on his wife's assailent. A sympathetic friend (Carrie Anne Moss) seems to be helping him. And mysterious guy (Joe Pantolino) seems to know a thing or two as well. Throughout the course of the film, we learn that things are not always as they seem...
B00005JKYS|4.0|There's no doubt that this is a powerful film, but there are some noticeable flaws. First off, the beginning scenes don't mesh together well. They seem contrived, not natural. However,the film flows more nicely once the guys get to Nam. Another problem with the film is that Wallace decides to portray the side of the enemy. This worked fairly well in Pearl Harbor, cause it led to the suspense of the coming attack. But here it seems as if Wallace is haphazardly trying to cause sympathy for the enemy. We know when the enemy will attack, so we are prepared when it comes. Wallace should've left the part concerning the enemy out all together, except for a touching scene at the end. Lastly, although I admire Mel Gibson as an actor he seems out of his element here. It is mostly because of dialogue, his one-liners make him seem more like a politician than a military man. Those circumstances aside, this is an enjoyable movie. There are some heartbreaking scenes (I give the film credit for addressing the \\"war at home\\" front.) And I must say it's refreshing to see a Vietnam film that doesn't portay the solidiers as either brutal mercenaries or strung out dope addicts. Futhermore, Barry Pepper gives the most outstanding acting in the film. This film won't win any awards, but it is well worth your time.
B00005Y7AW|5.0|This CD is amazing. I would highly reccomend it to anyone - everyone I've played his music for so far has fallen in love with him. His styles range from playful to sassy to heartbroken to hopeful - it's amazing. Buy it ^_^
B00005QHPQ|1.0|Hero is a great song.So inspirational and so natural in sounding.The hit single released some time at the beginning of this year,took me back to 'You are my Number one'a mellow hit so pefectly done by Enrique, not so common from a Latino singer.<br />Talking about the whole Album, 'Escape' is too good for a man who i first knew through his Tecno type music,such as Rythem devine,to mention but a few.<BR>Although,Enrique went back to the roots with a metromix version Hero,i don't think there is anyone who can claim not to enjoy his music and the Album 'Escape' in particular.<br />I happen to be a Radio presenter,but i was too exited and played Escape,before sampling it off air,hoping it was a slow hit,but all in all i was not disappointed and  i got close to 20 phone calls, appreciating the song.<br />Ladies and gentalmen,guys and babes,If you have not bought a copy of the album 'Escape', what are you waiting for? Nice listening.<br />              Ahmed Bogere Masembe-Radio Presenter-89.2FM, a subsdiary of 88.8,89.9CBS FM Kampala,Uganda-East Africa.
B000002J09|5.0|The magnum opus album of their career and one of the most important record in the history of rock & roll, the band took that leap in the direction of immortality that they're firmly ensconced in, ever since. Continuing from the thunder roll of their Sophomore effort, and the self indulgence of their third record; the band combined a little bit of both for this album. <br />Thematically this album remains a record which of all their albums was most influenced by the LOTR. From the apparent resemblance of the figure on the cover of the album to Gandalf the wizard, to allusion to the dark lord in the \\"Battle of Evermore,\\" to the choice of the two paths, and visions of rings through the trees in the epic \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\"... <br />Musically..., this albums is like a patchwork of influnces that the band had till that time; self indulgent at times and thunder grooving at other times, it takes the listener through a veritable juggernaut of musical journey. In fact a listening to the rambunctious throbbing of \\"Rock & Roll\\" is essential to any student of rock music to actually understand the effect that the Zeppelin has over the evolution of both hard rock & heavy metal, laying the templates for both. <br />Lastly, of course, the album is about \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\" One of the most enchating and mystifying track of all time, this song gave the anti Satanist puritans the most substantial material in their supposed crusade in proving the essential link with rock & roll and satanism... Well if one considers that these British invaders notched up phenomenal popularity and records sales in virtually no time and without any semblence of publicity campaigns; thriving solely on the word of the mouth, it does strike a odd chord.<br />Musically, however, there could not be any doubt about their capabilities, the best of which is captured in the album. Thematically, lyrically and conceptually there have been better albums than this, but for the sheer musical celebration there willnot be a better album than this fourth offering from planet Zeppelin.
B00004U8PA|5.0|Daaahlings, what can you say about this High Camp classic that hasn't already been said? On the heels of Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane, the divine Tim Curry hammered the final nail into the well-nailed coffin of Establishment gender stereotyping. As you can tell from the audience reactions, the androgynous Doctor Frank persona is as liberating for females as it is for males.<br />A strong collection of songs from maestro Richard O'Brien drives this Gothic masterpiece, concerning the misadventures of (Damn it) Janet Weiss, played by the ravishing Susan Sarandon and her RoboNerd boyfriend Brad Majors, played by Barry Bostwick.<br />There are just so many classic scenes and one liners that I can only respectfully suggest that you just go right ahead and buy this puppy. While the film lures you in with a feast of archetypal significance, you are probably better advised to check your brain at the door and relax with a chill bottle of parafino.<br />It can be easy you know... having a good time...
B000055XMF|4.0|I cant believe this film is so unknown, it should be a cult classic. I had been meaning to see this film for years but never got around to it since I hated the Who's first film outing, Tommy, so much. Quadrophenia is nothing like Tommy, its not a rock opera and is only slightly based on their album, they pretty much drop the whole Quadrophenic/Schizo plot and focus on what it was like to be a Mod in swinging 60s London. The main character Jimmy (played perfectly by Phil Daniels) struggles with his identity and the likelihood of \\"selling out\\" to society. There are fantastic scenes of Mods rolling around the working class neighborhoods of London on their scooters and fighting it out with the Rockers at Brighton Beach, great stuff. The riot in Brighton is pretty intense, Sting of all people really gets in to it. They just dont make \\"growing up\\" films like this anymore, truly a must see for anyone with a vague interest in the Who, Mods, Rockers, 60s English Culture and a great disliking for the [boring ] that passes for youth culture nowadays, has to watch Quadrophenia
B00000J7RZ|1.0|This is just wrong. The music is awful. I can't believe this was allowed to happen. I'm sorry for ranting, but, WOW!<br />Lopez has one of the worst voices in music and cinema history. A high pitches nasal sqeal that manages to both repulse and terrify you. The writing is awful. Lets be honest here, no one has bought this for the music. They've bought it for the cheesecake photos of Lopez inside. Please, do not buy this.
0962477060|5.0|First off let me say that I have played guitar for about 10 years off and on.  There were things I just didn't understand.  In fact I was just about convinced that you did have to be born with musical talent to improvise to music, either that or I believed that people were actually lying about it.  One week with this book and I had far more knowledge than I had with ten years of playing.  I didn't become technically better or know more songs, but I had an understanding.  A clear consice understanding of what the guitar is.  If you are series about playing, and you feel that there is just something that you don't know then this book is for you.  I was un-fortunate in running into guitarists who tried to keep what they knew a secret.  Trying to make it more complicated than it really was.  Now I have the knowledge to realize that in fact what they do is not complicated, and I am sure that those people would feel extrememly embarassed if they were ever in the company of really good musicians.  A must buy.  The best guitar book I ever bought.  Hands down.
0440211727|4.0|A Time To Kill by John Grisham was a fascinating book.  The story incorporated courtroom drama, racism, and moral values with a new twist.   I don't usually like novels on the court system but Grisham grabs your attention in the first ten pages and never lets go.  He is definitely a talented author.  If anyone ever handed me a book by Grisham again I would read it without question. <BR> This is the novel to read especially if you enjoy suspense, drama, or just a good book.  I have never read a novel with so many twists, turns, and conflicts.  John Grisham will keep you on your feet.  This is a great read and I would recommend it to anyone.
B00005OAIE|2.0|HIS VOICE IS SMOOTH BUT EVERY SONG SOUNDED THE SAME, IT WAS PRETTY BORING.....MAYBE HE'S BETTER IN CONCERT?
B00005TT77|4.0|Yes, nothing can ever take the place of the original; however, this is the best compilation of Beatles remakes (and we all know there are enough of them) I have ever heard.  Although not every track is great, most of them are.  My favorites are: Across the Universe, I'm Looking Through You, You've Got to Hide your Love Away, Golden Slumbers, and Let it Be.  Strawberry Fields and We Can Work it out definately leave me wanting, but nothing on this album is a total turn-off for me.<br />I highly recomend this album as a refresher course in why we love the Beatles and as an artist work in its own right.

B00005IBGQ|5.0|This is one of the most unique releases I have heard in the past couple of years.  Rufus Wainwright is a genius in modern music.  He brings the full/big sound to folk/rock music in a way I would have never imagined.  This album often brings three thoughts to mind: show music, Beatles ballad, and sountrack.  Yet the album definately witholds enough big sound to allow his marvelous voice to shine through.  His lyrical suggestion and tone takes me to thoughts of Nick Drake and strangely, Pete Yorn; however, I can see some link to Ben Folds showier music shine through as well.<br />Greek Song is one loved by nearly everyone, Cigarettes and Chocolate is definately the single, and Poses and Grey Gardens are my personal favorites.  I highly recomend this album to anyone who enjoys new and unique lyrical music.

B0000399WI|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and I am not a prison movie fan by<br />nature, but this one is riveting. The acting is suberb. Morgan<br />Freeman is the best. And what can I say---You go Tim:0) Tim<br />Robbins as usual was awesome. There is not much he can't do. If<br />you have not seen this Walk--no run to your video store.
B00003CXXP|2.0|I rented this movie hearing all of the great reviews expecting a pretty good movie.  I watched it for a little while then turned it off after 45 minutes.  I just couldn't get into it.  I think Haley Joel Osment is a good actor but to put it short...
0786889284|4.0|Ridley Pearson has been called the best of the &quot;thriller&quot; writers and he IS GOOD. Good characters, good plot, superior writing; Pearson has it all. Unfortunately he wrote a novel here that is too long for the plot. It gets tedious because the author STRETCHED the plot and spent much too much verbiage on a non-essential sub-plot of a troubled child. That is the only thing that stopped my giving this book five stars. If you are a reader of this genre, it is well worth your time. Tip: skip over a lot of the child stuff; you won't miss a thing.
1570427496|4.0|This book is a very sad, but also full of joy.  It contains something that can never be able to express without even crying.  This book written by Nicholas SParks is about a boy named Landon that is a senior in High School but does not know what he wants to do in the future.  He does not have a care in the world for anyone, but his friends and family.  During the beginning of the new year of his senior year, he notices the nice and plain Jamie Sullivan.  ...<BR>I really enjoyed this book because I believe that it is not only a love story but it shows a lesson in life also.  In these written pages the lesson is that there is always something more deeper and more beautiful than the outside of a human, and I believe that Landon learned this when he met Jamie
B00003CXAY|5.0|I have loved this film for many years and I do own the director's edition of the film on DVD. I thought everyone would like to know that I received an email from the director/producer of Koyaanisqatsi this morning stating that the long legal battle over the rights for both Koyaanisqatsi AND the sequel, Powaaqatsi are over and the DVD will be released as early as the Fall of 2002. Both films will be released on DVD and VHS at this time! The deal was struck between IRE and MGM in late January. So, the wait seems to be over...Only a little longer to wait and these gems will be out on DVD! :-)
6302797519|4.0|LORD JIM is a great film. It really surprised me how a great movie could be adapted from a bad novel! The movie is AWESOME! A great film for the collection. This film screams DVD Release! Please do so. PULEASE!!Grade: A
B000062X90|5.0|This is, simply put, one of the best albums of all time.  My jaw dropped when I first heard Blowin Free on the radio, I was speechless when I first heard the double leads in Sometime World and Time Was after buying it an hour later, and I still get goose bumps when I hear the opening chords of Warrior and the syncopated axework at the beginning of Throw Down the Sword.<br />Every song on the album is incredible.  The melodies and harmonies are infectious and the musicianship is impeccable.  Even the vocals (never their strongest suit) sound good.  But it's the double leads on Argus that make this the best twin guitar album ever (just my opinion Allman Bros fans).  This is Wishbone's best album and it still sounds fresh after 30 (jeez - I can hardly believe it) years.  Over those years I've turned a number of friends on to this album and almost all of them have become WA fans.  <br />The remix is great -- probably a little crisper than the original.  I'm personally not crazy about throwing in the three \\"Live From Memphis\\" songs as I feel it detracts from the feel of the Argus \\"concept,\\" but if it exposes listeners to more of this band's music then I guess it's a good thing.  <br />Too bad they couldn't have included a big fold-out of the original Argus album cover art in the cd case -- I don't know how many hours I've spent looking at that barely perceptable spaceship in the upper corner.  <br />Enough nostalgia.  For those of you that haven't heard this album, please take a listen.  For those that have, I highly recommend checking out this remix -- it'll blow you away.  Again.
0375728007|5.0|Landon Carter was an ordinary teenager who was looking for a relationship.  Jamie Sullivan was kind, cheerful, shy, and the daughter of a priest.  She was more of a giving to community type of girl while Landon didn't care about any of that yet somehow, they fall in love.  He would walk her home from school everyday.  One day, Jamie finally confesses to Landon that she has Leukemia and that she was dying soon.  Week after week, she started getting weaker and weaker until she was in a wheelchair.  By then, she was very pale and was all bones.  Landon knew that she was going to die soon but he loved her so much that he married her.  Even though Jamie was still very weak, she still walked down the aisle.  <BR>   I really liked this book because it was very touching, romantic, and sweet.  It kind of teaches you to not judge a person until you get know them.  This was a story of true love.  Landon didn't care of what his friends thought, he just wanted to stay with Jaime forever.<BR>   My favorite part of this book was when Jaime walked down the aisle.  She was very weak.  She had to sit in a wheelchair because she couldn't hold herself up, but she still walked down the aisle.  Even though she stumbled a lot and it took a long time, she still made it all the way.
B00005QEO2|5.0|I've never been what you would call a huge Aerosmith fan, but over the years, I've owned several of their albums and I consider &quot;Pump&quot; to be one of my favorite rock-albums of all time.  In my opinion, that was their most consistent album and I can still never get tired of playing the thing.  Songs like &quot;the other side&quot;, &quot;what it takes&quot;, and &quot;love in an elevator&quot; never wear out their welcome and always manage to bring back memories of my child-hood.  Permanent Vacation also had some good tunes, as well as Get a Grip and Nine Lives, but I never made the effort to buy ALL of them.  I guess this set was put together for casual fans like me and I'm really glad for having picked it up.  On here, are 34 songs culled from their Geffen years and, in all honesty, there really isn't a weak track.  I liked the double-live set &quot;A Little South of Sanity&quot; and I find it a little puzzling that they would include the live version of &quot;Hole in My Sole&quot;.  But, then again, that's just me.  Also, we get &quot;Deuces Are Wild&quot; from the Beavis and Butthead Experience and &quot;Blind Man&quot; from the 1994 greatest hits &quot;Big Ones&quot;.  <br />This is a fantastic &quot;hits&quot; package and my only complaint is that there wasn't more stuff from Nine Lives.  But oh well, can't have everything.  All in all this is a solid buy that even the rabid fans may want to have.  It's good times.
B00003CXXO|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It was unique in that it portrayed a young man-made robotic boy's, (played by Haley Joel Osment) love for a cold, insensitive, selfish woman whom he called mother. This woman scarcely even noticed him, and was only trying to fulfill some selfish desire, and once she got him reared him as some sort of pet in which she occassionally found funny and odd. Upon receiving him as a gift from her husband, she was warned that she should never used the words &quot;I love you&quot; to the man-made robotic boy without sincerely meaning her words. Because once the man-made robotic boy heard those words, he was forever emotionally tied to her. It appeared as though her adoption of the man-made robotic boy into her home was merely out of selfishness.  She later assumed the role as &quot;mother&quot; and was met with the same unconditional love that she eventually gave.  She had a son who was in a coma. At the beginning of the movie, the diagnosis for his improvement was grim.  This lead to the implementation of the man-made robotic boy. The movie never gave many specifics as to what was actually wrong with the biological child. However, as soon as he began to come out of his comatose state, the mother nearly rejected the man-made robotic child over her own.<br />The real child assumed his rightful place as the apple of his parent's eye, and apparently all was to be well; yet the competiveness of the man-made robotic boy was sad and heart-breaking. It was annoying to see the real boy lavished with love and security. While the other child assumed a position that was almost non-existent.<br />The climax of the movie was when the mother convinced the man-made boy to go with her for a ride. She drove him several miles away from the home and abandoned him in a wooded area. It was difficult to watch the struggle that existed between mother and son.  The boy kept pleading for his mother not to leave him. And eventually she jumped in her car and  sped off leaving him like a hurt, sad, and grief-stricken.  After running after the woman, who undoubtedly told him that she loved him. He was left alone with a broken-heart, and many questions as to why his mother who loved him so dearly would just leave him. His journey for the life that he once knew began when he encountered another man-made robot,( played by Jude Law). The man-made boy remembers a childhood story that mentions a blue fairy that granted the wish of a puppet who wanted to be a real boy. He believes that by finding the blue fairy that he would reunite with his mother. He felt that by finding the blue fairy his wish of having the motherly love that we all craved could eventually be satiated. <br />This movie literally broke my heart. I cried because it was so moving and so real. A lot of people wanted this man-made boy to get over his emotions for his mother. They wanted him to assume his natural identity as a robotic being. The boy only wanted what he deemed as his -- a mother's love. The story was so ironic and the ending even more baffling than its beginning. It was if for several hundred years the man-made boy remained under sea, praying to a statue of a blue fairy that he would establish a relationship with his mother again. It is sad . . . The ending is beautiful, light, and magical. Anyone who has a heart would find it moving and warm.<br />Though this  movie to me had lots of potential, apparently several people did not agree because it performed poorly at the box office.  Nevertheless, I am not other people, I am me, and to me this movie was sentimental, sweet, and amazingly good.
B00003CX95|5.0|This is an excellent movie. The story is intruiging, and the folk hero main character is very appealing. I am certain that history portrays Wallace as a villain, since it is the victors who write the history books. However, Braveheart will have you hoping that this vilian is triumphant. He's ten times the man Robin Hood is!

0671024256|5.0|This is the best writing book I have read since I &quot;Writing Down the Bones&quot;.  Whether your a King fan or just a writer, you will gain valuable knowlege from this book.  It not only looks at the craft of writing, but the experiences behind the craft.  It shows your how everyday experience can become extraordinary novels.  Definitely a must have.
B00005LKHV|5.0|This movie is meant for teenagers and young people, in my own opinion. It makes me laugh every single time I watch both AP and AP2. The new gags always get me, and I can't help but laugh my [butt] off.
0064407667|5.0|Read this with your children! It's as good as Kingdoms and Elves of the Reaches and it's hillariously irreverent!

B00005JKYS|5.0|I love this movie... From begining to end it hold your attention. I have watched it twice and the acting is great, The action is great a movie worthy of awards. If you want a true story that will pull at your heartstrings this is it. Go and see this movie you will not be dissappointed!!!!!!!!!
B00005OAIE|4.0|...It's a great cd, not only because of the catchy melodies, but also because of the quirky lyrics.  These lyrics are about everyday experiences, and are easy for the listener to relate to.  As a college student, I think that John Mayer has an unique ability to express just how you feel. It's a fun cd, and can be played over and over again.
B00005Y228|5.0|It's great to see Kylie hitting it big in the USA again since her &quot;I Should Be So Lucky&quot;/&quot;Locomotion&quot; days of the late 80s.  And at age 33, she still sounds (and looks) as good as she did when she was 20, if not better!<BR> <BR>I purchased &quot;Fever&quot; days after its official USA release date knowing that the album had already been #1 on the album charts in the UK, Ireland and Australia.  What I didn't know was to expect besides &quot;CGYOOMH&quot; (#1 on the singles chart in the UK, Ireland and Australia) and &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;, already out in Europe and Australia as the follow-up single.  Three weeks later, I'm still playing that CD at home and in my car with a passion.  Fun catchy lyrics (besides the la, la, las of &quot;CGYOOMH&quot;), a great Euro-pop dance sound (no ballads here) and Kylie's sensuous voice are all neatly wrapped up and tied into this package of an album.<br />It's a &quot;Fever&quot; you'll definitely want!
B00005UEAR|5.0|When Scenes from A memory was released, I reviewed it and said it was their best album to date, which I believed right up to the release of this album. Now I'm torn between the two albums - I'd have to make it a tie. But, they are very different albums. It's very obvious with each new release that they are gradually pushing the stylistic envelope a little further each time. Just enough to keep from getting boring but not too much, which would turn away too many fans. And they continue to push their chops and precision to the limit. Jordan Rudess is absolutely the perfect keyboard player for them - for my money, the best keyboard player I've ever seen - period. Of course I think John Petrucci (guitar), John Myung (bass), Mike Portnoy (drums)and James LaBrie (vocals) are also the best at their respective instruments - but I won't belabor the point, I've said it many times before. Let's also clear up one other thing: JM's bass is not mixed too low at all - it's very audible. The reviewer who wrote that has a bad ear for that type of thing obviously.<br />1. The Glass Prison - is one of my all-time favorite DT tracks for sure. I love that song. Can't get enough of it. The reviewer who said it seems shorter because it's so good was right on the money. It just doesn't seem like it's 13 1/2 minutes long. Heavy as hell - I love it. Also, this song contains something else - some lead vocals by Mike. It's just a few lines at a time, but he's improving greatly, I think especially because of his involvement in Transatlantic. This song is quite melodic for such a heavy song. The tempo changes are quite fun too. The guitar solo is killer.<br />2. Blind Faith - I really enjoy the lyrics to this one. I think that Petrucci and Portnoy (who write most of the lyrics) are brilliant lyricists but I really like it when James gets a shot - his lyrics seem less specific and leave more to the imagination. It makes a great change from their usual lyric style. The music is great too. Very melodic. <br />3. Misunderstood - this is also a great song - the mellow intro is absolutely beautiful. This song is not really what I would call an all out ballad. It starts somewhat that way, but builds to be quite heavy as well. And I love the outro. Something which I haven't noticed any reviewers to have mentioned is that the outro is very, very King Crimson-esque - which I guess relates back to LTE w/ Tony Levin. I love the manipulated pitch of the drums on that part. VERY cool. They've never done that. Also very cool and utterly bizarre guitar solo by John. Nice Experimentation.<br />4. The Great Debate - OK, I am not really a big fan of politically-tinged songs and it doesn't seem most prog fans really are - but the other reviewers are really missing a great song because they're hung up on that. Once again - more experimentation, it's a piece of the puzzle that makes them such a great band. I think they did a great job - the mixed in fragments of conversation are very well done and fit the concept of the song, while the ambient keyboard intro is beautiful. The bass is totally in your face as it enters (again - was the guy who said the bass was too low just totally deaf or listening on a tiny speaker???) - The riffs throughout this song are great and the song maintains the usual highly melodic nature of the majority of DT's stuff. My second favorite song on the album. Also, my other favorite killer guitar solo from the album (the other being on The Glass Prison). By the way, the lyric is Are they JUSTIFIED (NOT satisfied)... And I don't believe they are taking a position - they are illuatrating the debate and letting the listener draw his/her own conclusion. But it shows why I like the change of LaBrie's much less specific approach to lyrics as stated in my comments on Blind Faith.<br />5. Disappear - this is a great mellow tune. At first I didn't relate to this as well because I love heavy stuff so much... but this is a great tune too. It is quite simply put, beautfully melodic...<br />6. Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence -- This totally rivals Scenes from a Memory for great long concept pieces. To oppose a previously expressed view: the Overture is amazing - it's soundtrack progressive metal. This is Jordan's genius REALLY shining through. Solitary Shell is a standout section - The verses are reminiscent of either Styx in their \\"Fooling Yourself\\" mode or maybe ELP. But the standout section is the guitar break where JP shows off some seriously cool DiMeola-like acoustic passages. But my favorite part is \\"About to Crash (reprise)\\" - I'm also a big Steve Vai fan, so I love the Vai-esque riff that opens this part and then when the vocals enter it reminds me of Derek St. Holmes at his peak in the early Ted Nugent stuff (\\"Working Hard, Playing Hard\\" from the Cat Scratch Fever album comes to mind). The whole 42 minutes is awesome....<br />Another masterpiece. My favorite band of all-time...
B00001X590|4.0|this is a fine start. cocker is helped out on this debut album by an impressive list of british rock luminaries-jimmy page and steve winwood are certainly the best known, but also guys from bands like spooky tooth and procol harum, among others. cocker's band from the period is, of course, also excellent on this disc. cocker is probably the finest male white soul singer period, with the possible exception of the aforementioned winwood.there's a few decent originals, such as the hippieish sandpaper cadillac and the soulful ballad change in louise. the minor british hit marjorine is ok. everyone knows the versions of feelin' alright and with a little help from my friends. there's also good covers of the standard blackbird, nina simone's don't let be be misunderstood, and dylan's i shall be released and just like a woman. for me though, the masterpiece on this album is an incredible tour de force called do i still figure in your life? this is a cover of a song by an obscure british late 60's aggregation known as the honeybus. it's an excellent , sad track with great organ work by winwood and superb vocals by cocker and the female backup singers. i'm surprised that this isn't a well known cut by cocker, and that it wasn't released as a single. this is a fine debut record , most of the tracks are first rate, and cocker's 2nd album, simply called joe cocker! is another worthy addition to one's record collection.
0446677450|4.0|I found this book to be very useful.  More than simply entertaining, Rich Dad Poor Dad gives the reader an entirely new perspective on money.  The book explains different ideas necessary to gaining financial freedom, and as the book states, get money to work for you.  Through a series of personal stories told by the author, the reader gets a feel for the concepts that, while far from conventional, the author insists are key to financial success.  One of the main features of the book is that, unlike many other financial books, Kiyosaki does not simply talk at you, but rater teaches by example.  His use of personal anecdotes gives the reader a deeper understanding of the concepts offered, allowing the reader to get a firmer grasp of the ideas than would be possible were he to have written the book in another style.  Although Rich Dad Poor Dad is different both in style and content than other financial books I have read, I found it to be one of the most helpful, entertaining, and insightful books I have come across in a long time.
B000002KHH|5.0|i bought this cd i big lots for about 5 bucks.it's not the warner bros. version but says'curtosey of dorchester holding'. i sounds really good,so i reccomend this version.
B000002L99|5.0|Believe me, when David lee Roth left Van Halen, I was [mad]. When I bought the ALBUM (shows my age) of 5150 and put it on my turntable, one listen changed my mind. This album stands up, even after all these years. I used to listen to this thing every day after school, and I still do not get tired of it, even though I admit I only listen to it occassionally now. The weakest point of the album is, of course, the last song, \\"Inside\\". Other than that one glitch, I love this thing. the drumming is top knotch, even though Alex is using those stupid Simmons pads everyone loved in the 80's. If you are to get 2 Van Halen CDs, get this one and 1984. If you are going to get 3, throw in Diver Down too.
B00005QZWJ|5.0|Yes, that's right - the score. Apart from two Enya contemporary celtic/newage numbers, the whole soundtrack is epic, renaissance, middle ages, dark ages, B.C. and at just the right spots romantic and modern. I can't think of a film better served by its soundtrack in decades... And that's all I have to say. Feel free to disagree, of course - but only if you've got the music running through your veins and still can't abide it. Which - let's face it - is a slim chance (says the non-expert in film scores)
B000002I8D|5.0|I love this album, it's one of the ones I will always have in my CD bag, but man is it so depressing.  Great stuff for his first solo effort and I would highly recommend finding live versions of Hand in Hand, my alltime favorite Phil song.  This is really one of those essential albums.
B00005OWIU|5.0|This is a wonderful CD, but I don't recomend it to any Hard Rock people or anything. The tracks are simply great in my opinion, they really make me think! ^___^ I enjoy them very much, and recomend this CD to all those people who aren't really into: Rap, Hard Rock, etc. If you are interested in those, I really don't think you'd like this CD! But, if you'd like to, go ahead an buy it. ^^ I love it myself.<br />My personal favorite track is number nineteen, Hedwig's Theme. ^-^= That one I asoulutly love! Over all, I give this CD a five. I love John Willams music, I hope you will too. :)
B000002GXX|5.0|I would rank this one third on my Eagles list.  By this time Don Felder has made one album with the group and now toured with them, so now they are truly a band.  The music is tight, the writing good and even the instrumental is squared away.  Some very underrated songs on this album, including: Visions, I wish you Peace, Journey Of The Sorcerer...good stuff here.  Add this one to the playlist too.
B00005AQGH|5.0|I have a pal who used to listen to pac and I used to tell him to &quot;turn off that foolishness&quot; so one day I had a blank cassette and I decided to put some music on it -any kind of music- the only cd available was The seven day theory. I took it home and forgot about it....one day I was home on vacation and I decided to put in this cd and put set the player to random select .....the first song that played was &quot;white man's world&quot; and I was addicted. I love all pac's tunes and although I think &quot;all eyes on me&quot; was a great commercial piece I think this was a totally deep cd and in that sense closer to who pac was. No one is like pac and when I heared that he had passed I was dumfounded and stayed away from school for weeks. He is the greatest of all time and will not be bettered because the fans feel him..We feel him because he felt us in the sense that he sang what we all feel and see everyday. I always wonder why he recorded so much .He must have be driven and like no other.------ Makaveli for life--
B00000016O|5.0|This version of Hotel California was made just for headphones.  Turn off the lights, slip on the 'phones and let the music just soak in.  This album is so freaking good, even the overplayed tunes come back to life on this version.  This is really their best album, and anything after this was going to be a letdown (see-The Long Run).  Get this version!
0060934913|4.0|This book was just plain fun! Sure, Bourdain is a little mean at times, but for a peek behind the scenes, you couldn't ask for better. For all those who have a fantasy that being a professional chef might be interesting, worth a read! I read it in 2 nights and laughed out loud while reading.
B000002IG4|5.0|Here is another one I used to play over and over and over again when I was in high school.  If I wanted to get really depressed I would play Face Value, if I wanted lift myself back up again, if only for a short time, it was Hello.  This album has it all, ups and downs, instrumentals, jazzy tunes, catchy tunes, everything.  I love I Cannot Believe it's True and am so happy it was never released as a single for it is another song I can relate to so well.    You need this one fill your Phil collection.
B00005RYL9|5.0|What the makers of the sequels and the TV show, even, seemed to never get through their heads is that the events in this film make up the END of the story of the Immortals. Period.<br />The TV show at least touched on the fact that there were thousands of possible stories in the lives of the Immortals BEFORE the events of this film.<br />Oh, well, at least we have this one, and can ignore the rest. I'm looking forward to this Immortal Edition for more material and a better transfer.
B000002IP1|5.0|Yes, I have said in other reviews Phil Collins is one of my favorites, I expecially love his drumming and he is a good songwriter and singer as well, but let's not forget he's a drummer!  This album has some great moments, and some flat ones for me.  I love Father to Son, a great song which I used to find myself listening to a lot when I was younger (oh those whistful days of being 20-25 years old) and Find a Way to my Heart.  These are underrated and not as well know as the other hits on here, but to tell you the truth, I wasn't entirely taken with some of the hits.  In fact, I remember when paradise came out I thought this album would [need help] I am glad I was wrong.  The other 2 albums that came out after this weren't nearly as good, so get this one, and Hello, I must be going, and No Jacket, jsut for a trip down memory lane.....oh, those 80's......
6304466498|4.0|i can't think of this movie without laughing outloud!  Dark Helmet is a character that will live on forever...and every time i watch this movie, there's another joke that i get...there are so many subtle jokes (a word here, an odd saying there) that you're constantly having epiphanies everytime you watch it...and watch it with a group of people...because there are jokes that will go right over your head, but someone else in the room will understand (my mother had a Ford Galaxy when she was younger and had to fill me in on that joke)....and the cast of actors is perfect!
B00005V1Z5|5.0|I happened to be feeling down before the movie, but after watching it, I felt really relaxed! It was a such a fun movie.
B000002KBU|5.0|this album is incredible. it's the first album of mitchell's that i purchased .... i can't even begin to describe the beauty of her music on this cd...just buy it and you'll see for yourself. it's become a necessary staple in the music that i listen to daily, and i usually listen to groups such as led zeppelin, jimi hendrix, and mothers of invention. buy this album. pronto. :)
