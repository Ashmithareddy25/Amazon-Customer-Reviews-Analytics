B0031S4K5E|5.0|An English version of ponyo that was very glad was impressed though it was uneasy first by reaching of goods to home in Japan, too. Hereafter, I want to buy it in American version Amazon.
0800177975|1.0|This film is a seventh-rate Terminator wannabe.The acting is secord-rate & over the top mainly with Lieutenant Dekker.The action scences are quite decent at best .The celebrity cameos are pointless.Some jokes were funny but not all of them.Not to metion,the lack of realism in the film's \\"real world\\" segment.I give this film a 2 and a half out of 10.

B001DJLCRC|4.0|Definitely not for children, but a great series if you're a Bryan Cranston fan (from Malcom in the Middle). We especially love it, because it's filmed locally here in Albuquerque & New Mexico. Great story line. Great acting. Very well written & directed, with great attention to detail. You have to see the 1st episode in the series (pilot), before any of the subsequent episodes, or you'll be lost. We're already working on the 2nd season.

There is a noticeable change in my running and i ran a half marathon in 1 hour 41min. last weekend using these methods. I shaved off a whopping 8 minutes off my best time.
B002WY65VU|5.0|My sons brought this over one night to watch with a few beers, and honestly, I didn't expect much. Disgustingly gross; but my wife & I were laughing ourselfs off the sofa! Woody Harrelson & Jesse Eisenerg were a mix like the Odd Couple...on steriods! A must see, if you don't mind blood & guts with your comedy. I had to buy a copy of the movie for my own archives.

B0000041ZT|4.0|I bought this only because it has the great tune from Eyes Wide Shut, the movie starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. It is hauntingly infectious. Took me a while to find the exact version from the movie too. Amazon really helps in that respect, because I could listen to the tracks on the album and verify the correct movie soundtrack tune. Entire album is very good, and I never buy any album for one song, but kinda did that with this one. Don't have any Shostkovich. Trying to wander from my usual faves of Vivaldi, Bach, and other Baroque masters.
0393327345|4.0|I admit, when I first started reading this book, I was almost sure I wasn't going to like it.  That's not because I went in with preconceived notions, but rather because the style of Palahniuk's writing threw me off in a way I hadn't expected at all.  It's not stream-of-consciousness throughout, but in parts it is.  It switches from first person to the rare second person (to stunningly great effect later in the book when it's earned, to iffy effect early in it).  It jumps from scene to scene without transition, without letting the reader get a feel for the characters, the setting, the plot... anything.  You essentially have to hit the ground running.  I'm not ashamed to say that the style threw me off, but I'm glad I stuck with it, because by the time the fifth chapter rolled around, I realized what I was reading.  My initial thoughts (\\"Maybe style over substance?\\") were smacked away when I just let myself go with the incredibly strange and oddly captivating flow.<br /><br />It's wildly inventive.  It's smart, a bit pretentious, but not annoyingly so.  It's ridiculously ambitious, especially for a first novel.  \\"Fight Club\\" is absolutely a must read, because the oddness and effectiveness of Palahniuk's style really takes this novel to the next level.  While there is a twist at the end (I won't spoil, though I'm willing to bet 95% of the people who'll be reading the review already know it, thanks to the movie), I feel like that could have been delved into more.  Which makes me a bit conflicted, because I do think a LOT could have been delved into more in the novel.  But that's just it.  Palahniuk gives us what we need to know, the bare minimum, to understand the story.  Nothing more.  It makes the novel quicker, harsher, and more surreal.  It has the energy and nightmarish quality of a post-apocalyptic tale, but it's not that.  It's a story about what men can do to each other and society in return for what society has done to men.<br /><br />\\"Fight Club\\" is flawed, brutal, funny, and at times, elegant.  It's full of stuff that you've never seen in literature before Palahniuk hit the scene, so for that alone, it's worth reading.  I wouldn't go as far as others have and call it a classic, but it's a damn good book that, like Tyler Durden's kiss scar, will stay with you long after you've finished.<br /><br />Also, Palahniuk's Afterword made me appreciate the novel even more.  It adds an element of realism, grounding this surreal book by explaining its influence on society as a whole.  Fascinating stuff, and it actually makes the novel itself stronger.  Solid, solid read.<br /><br />8/10
0393072231|5.0|Michael Lewis's \\"The Big Short\\" is an exceptional book.  Written with clarity and a sense of the human dimension -- whether odd or foolish, greedy or breathtakingly reckless -- the book makes the subprime mortgage debacle much clearer than anything else I've read on the subject.  Rather than focusing on the 'titans' of Wall Street (although they certainly claim their place), Lewis looks with wit and insight at this financial disaster that most of us barely understand through the stories of a small number of individuals who played key roles in trying to fashion a financially realistic response to the folly that was afoot.  A truly interesting and informative book!
0385523386|5.0|I've read two books this month that really opened my eyes on the impact of the drug trade on the USA.  The first was Orange is the New Black.  Written by a Smithie who graduated shortly before I arrived there, the book is the memoir of a woman who gets mixed up with international drug smuggling after graduation, then goes straight and goes on to the life you'd expect from a Smith graduate.  Then, many years after the incidents involved, the Feds show up and take her to prison.  She spends a year and a half in \\"Club Fed\\", which isn't as fancy as people have made it sound.  That said, she has some experiences with the bureau of prisons that make her realize that \\"the camp\\" was a paradise in comparison.  At any rate, she herself had her eyes opened to the effects the drug trade had on others, the toll it takes on our society.  The majority of the women she is locked up with are minor drug offenders, some of whom are serving long sentences due to sentencing minimums, many of whom are mothers of young children.  She writes about how the prison system does very little to rehabilitate or prepare these women for a life outside.  Instead, it breaks them down and institutionalizes them, so that they can only  handle life behind bars - and then unceremoniously dumps them out on the street with 30 dollars in their pocket and the address of a homeless shelter.  She notes that she is treated better at times because of her blond hair, and highlights the racism among the prison staff.<br /><br />However, much of the memoir is funny and uplifting, about the great friends she makes among the other prisoners.  Although you'd imagine that as an upper-middle-class, well-educated white woman, she might find it hard to fit in in prison - but she has just the right personality to make it. She is street smart enough that she doesn't come off as snooty, and while she has some of the same fears and thoughts as I would have, she handles herself so well that she becomes quite popular in the prison system.  And the other prisoners aren't the hardened cons that you see on Oz - they actually make her feel welcome and it's a great community of women like any other.  At any rate, the memoir really shows how the author changed her perspective on life and makes it sound as if, although unfortunate, her experiences being locked up in Danbury gave her some lifelong memories and friends that are _almost_ but not quite worth the experience.<br /><br />I'm glad I'll  never be in prison, but I found this book absolutely fascinating and read it straight through in a few days even though I wanted to save it for an upcoming plane trip.  After all, the author and I have a lot in common.  I am so glad I decided to get a job in technology after graduation, lucky as I was to be graduating into the first Internet bubble.  It was fun to be able to place the author's locations, like Northampton Massachusetts.  I've even stayed in the Congress Hotel in Chicago (yup, it IS a dump).  And of course I remember when the Martha Stewart trial was ongoing.  The songs she mentions, and the current events, will make this book something of a time capsule.tem.

0596009208|5.0|This was my first Head First book that I had bought (around Nov '09), and I have bought 5 more since (to date, May '10).<br />After reading this Head First Java book, I was able to teach myself java within approximately a month.<br /><br />I won't comment on the specific techniques and methods the Head First series implements, but I will tell you what these books do for me:<br />..<br />I am a VERY visual and global thinker (The kind that draws things when he/she's trying to explain something, and thinks of objects/maps instead of words and sounds).  As such, I like to know what there is to learn about a subject before I dive in, and I don't like to sweat details until they're relevant.  And that is EXACTLY what these books do; they construct a mental map of what there is to learn about a subject from the get go.  As this mental map develops (simply by frickin' skimming these books, it's amazing!), you're better able to evaluate the context of things, and better apply and build upon ideas and concepts.<br /><br />Now, these books are not per se good reference manuals, but that doesn't matter to me for two reasons.  1) The mental maps they paint are alone worth much much more than the price of the book (even if you don't download it illegally).  2) The 'interwebs' is a GREAT reference for programming - specifically for Java, VB, Javascript, C++, HTML, XML, etc.<br /><br />I spend my free time teaching myself programming because I enjoy it so much now! .. hopefully that's not a bad thing
B003B8GK02|5.0|I waited a couple days before putting up my review of Omega. This album is one of those albums that grows on you the more you listen to it where Phoenix on the other hand I burned out on pretty quickly. I really do think this is the best album they have put out (note: I can't speak for the Payne albums)! In my opinion even better then the first one. In my opinion there isn't a bad song on the album. A couple a bit weaker then the rest, while songs like Holy War, Listen Children, End of the World, Light The Way are stellar songs! Way to go guys for hitting a home run on this one.... To bad it won't get the airplay or attention that it deserves.....
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|In the vast wasteland of Network television, occasionally a bright flame will appear; usually it is snuffed out before it can find its voice or a viewer following.  Instead of giving us another CSI: Louisville or Law And Order: The Special Parking Squad, the minds at ABC Studios came up with something a bit newer, a little quirky, overall very entertaining and a boon to us writers, a hero named Richard Castle.<br />Castle introduces us to the series lead, Richard Castle (Nathan Fillion, Firefly), a writer that has the time honored problem that plagues all writers; writer's block.  On the surface Castle has all the things we writers aspire to; he's famous, he has a large (though it appears mostly female) following, he's rich, and his poker buddies are other famous writers.  However he is also a single father of a teenage daughter, Alexis (Molly C. Quinn, My One and Only) who is a fair match for her father's intellect, and has to deal with his mother, Martha Rodgers (Susan Sullivan, Dharma and Greg) who relives her glory days on Broadway, thinks her son's career needs her guidance, while also living with them.<br />Castle's opposite is an attractive, street-smart NYPD homicide detective, Kate Beckett (Stana Katic, The Spirit) who is driven to solve unusual cases, and has deep reasons for doing so.  Her, and subsequently her team, Javier Esposito (Jon Huertas, NCIS) and Kevin Ryan (Seamus Dever, Army Wives), are unwillingly drawn into Castle's world, when his invades Beckett's in a series of murders, based on Castle's novels.<br />The chemistry of the two leads (Fillion and Katic) is substantial and the duo play well against each other, but more importantly the supporting cast is just as strong; which also include Lanie Parish (Tamala Jones, The Wood) a medical examiner and friend of Beckett, Roy Montgomery (Ruben Santiago-Hudson, The West Wing) Beckett's boss who is frequently amused at Castle's irritation of Beckett, Meridith (Darby Staunchfield, Private Practice) Castle's first ex-wife who brings a new definition to \\"deep fried Twinkie\\" (trust me, you just have to see the episode).  The viewers should offer kudos to the casting people and the writers, for putting together this team.<br />After their initial investigation, Castle has decided that he has found his muse and the answer to his writer's block, in the form of Detective Beckett.  Using his considerable pull with the mayor of the city, he manages to get assigned to Beckett's team, while she works her cases; he takes notes for his new book series.<br />Cleverly written, quality acting and inviting to viewers, Castle, blends together some of the better characteristics of former television detectives, such as Remington Steel/Laura Holt and Maddie Hayes/David Addison.<br />If you enjoy a good police story and a little comedy touch to your drama, then you should be watching Castle.st ex-wife who brings a new definition to \\"deep fried Twinkie\\" (trust me, you just have to see the episode).

B000VSAEYI|5.0|I purchased as a birthday gift for my 2 year old nephew that was used at his birthday party. Ten or more kids jumped, splashed and had a great time in this pool. It was simple and quick to assemble. Great for toddler age kids because the water doesn't get too deep. I am going to purchase for my two kids! Great product!
0307463745|3.0|This is my first review. I am in the middle of this book and there are just too many \\"gems\\" of advice here.  Maybe their advice will work and I do agree with them but I would like better examples that are more than 1 paragraph long.  I think the ideas are pretty good and pertinent to the world now but the format of this book is akin to bullet points in a PowerPoint presentation.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|Excellent, exciting movie.  I wouldn't recommend it for small children, because they might have nightmares, but hopefully, adults will be fine with it.
B001QOGYFY|3.0|Okay, except the airplane crash episode the movie follows all \\"The Thing\\" control points - from the very beginning and straight to the hole in the ice.  After that Mr. Sena tries to do something without Mr. Carpenter's help, but... I just don't want to repeat what was said before - just watch any of those one star reviews.  The movie is not that bad, if you like Discovery channel, of course, and Mrs. Beckinsale in the shower supposed to be attractive replacement of bearded Mr. Russel playing chess with computer, but I expected a little bit more from \\"Swordfish\\" director.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|Due to the fact that the Federal Government pulled the plug on my analog television last summer, I was not aware this show had been renewed by ABC; it's future had been dodgy, at best.  Thanks to the internet [where I have to wait 24 hours for viewing], I've been able to keep up with most of this season's episodes and must say it is quite an improvement over season 1.  I believe one of the writer's from Firefly has come on board, and if I'm not mistaken, Castle even dressed up as Mr. Fillion's Firefly character for Halloween - what a hoot!  And his Indiana Jones getup at the Mummy exhibition was another clever infusion of humor so indicative of this show - as was having Erick Avari, from the Mummy movie franchise, play the curator. This is a step above most other crime shows on television [NCIS being tops for me]and even has credible post-mortem medical examiner scenes, if you're into that sort of thing. Overall, this show deserves to outlast most of the drek that's on network TV these days.  Fabulous casting all around[Stana Katic was a vampire in \\"The Librarian\\" with Noah Wiley] - long live Castle!
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|Typical Disney fare. Great animation and story for the kids. Watch it in Blu-Ray, the colors are just so much better than regular DVD.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I am sure that most Star Trek fans will like this movie.  For me the things that I found most satisfying is the perfect characterization the actor who portrayed Kirk achieves.  He did a great job in my opinion of capturing Kirk's mannerisms, gestures, swagger and cocky self assurance.  I thoroughly enjoyed his performance.<br /><br />I also have the same appreciation for the actor portraying Spock.  Perhaps a bit soft spoken, but he is a spit image look alike for Nimoy, and that goes a long way.  He also captured the essence of Spock. As for the other standard characters, I found the actor portraying Scott to be the next best performance, but not so much Sulu or Uhuru.  Uhuru didn't sell me on her character, and I never knew Spock and Uhuru had a previous relationship. I did not, however, think the actor playing Chekhov was well chosen.  Totally unbelievable.<br /><br />Story line was pretty good, and I thought that Eric Bana played a superb \\"bad-guy\\" role.  He is fast emerging as my favorite male lead, since Troy.<br /><br />I am in sincere hopes that the studios will continue the Star Trek series, as it appears they have hit on a winning formula here.

B00127RAJY|5.0|It's a great workout video. Makes you sweat in 20 minutes. I like the fact that you can do it for 20 minutes a day or longer if you want. The abs exercise are not that great but after the cardio and strrength, I need that break!  I would have liked to skip all the talk in the beginning and get to the exercise quickly but the DVD does not let you do that...  Overall - it's a good workout
B000063DFS|5.0|Great album from Ozzy that set the standard for metal albums of the late 80's and early 90's.  Great song set, great sound quality and just killer riffs!
B00000269G|5.0|This is classic Erroll. If you only had one Erroll album, this would be a good one to have. I have it in vinyl and in CD form. Concert by the Sea, I got for free back in the 50's when I first joined the Columbia Record Club. I play the drums as a hobby, and I'm still playing to this one. It is upbeat; it's in person; it's great.<br /><br />This, of course, is the updated re-recorded Columbia Master Series. So the sound is even better than on the original. I have them both. You can't miss with this one.

0679759328|5.0|The perfect cover for an excellent, insightful novel. The dabbled light on the walk, the chair that says \\"Europe\\"; a lone woman, hands in her coat, head down, obviously deeply absorbed in considering a cusp of her life, trailed by her one true friend, her dog... or is it a cat? And the \\"lac\\" of the title is Lake Geneva; the story unfolds on the Swiss side. What sort of hotel is it? \\"Travel agents did not know it, or had forgotten it.\\" It has a special function, for a special cliental: \\"Certain doctors knew it, many solicitors knew it, brokers and accountants knew it.\\" And in particular: \\"Those families who benefit from the periodic absence of one of their more troublesome members treasured it.\\"<br /><br />Edith Hope arrives at the Hotel du Lac not because it is a sought destination, but rather her absence from another setting is desired. She has committed a grievous faux pas, but we don't learn what she has done until a brilliantly written flashback, three-fourths of the way through the novel, reveals her decision that \\"The Loneliness of a Long Distance Runner\\" would have understood so well. Hope is a middling sort of novelist, who writes \\"fantasy and obfuscation\\" for the (female) tortoise market. The \\"hares\\" didn't have time to read, so she spins her tales for the \\"tortoises\\" who win every time, because \\"they prefer the old myths...they want to believe that they are going to be discovered, looking their best, behind closed doors, just when they thought that all was lost, by a man who has battled across continents, abandoning whatever he may have had in his in-tray, to reclaim them.\\" Wow!  Such is the power of Brookner's prose. As she explains, Hope could write these tales because she was a tortoise herself.<br /><br />And the \\"hares\\"? \\"To Penelope, men were conquests, attributes, but they were also enemies; ... Her tone with such men was flirtatious, mocking, never serious; she spread about her a propaganda of rapid affairs, rapidly consummated, with a laughing lack of commitment on both sides.\\" \\"I'm talking about the complacent consumers of men with their complicated but unwritten rules of what is due to them. Treats. Indulgences. Privileges. The right to make illogical fusses. The cult of themselves.\\" \\"The whole sorry business of baiting the sexual trap was uncovered by Monica's refusal to behave herself in a way becoming to a wife: by sheer effrontery she would damage her husband's pride, humble him into keeping her, or, if not, ruin his reputation.\\"<br /><br />Yes, the tortoises and hares of life. Another Brookner theme, one of the critical ones, particularly for women, and their haunting bio clock, is age. The author plays it so well, keeping the reader guessing how old the characters are at the Hotel. Be prepared for a surprise or two. And those other characters, they are so authentically drawn, with a balance of empathy and criticism. And if you have a few miles on your odometer, you might say, yes, that is just like... so-and-so. Why could I never articulate the self-absorption of the shallowest of lives as Brookner has done?<br /><br />Brookner certainly deserved the not quite eponymous Booker Prize for this novel, written over a quarter century ago. Even at the time, the author was describing a social anachronism of a place, as well as the misfits who did not particularly seek refuge there as so much as they were sent, as though it were an asylum.  But her insights into the human condition remain \\"cutting age\\"; a pleasure and a pain to contemplate. So, I'll close with two: \\"The company of their own sex, Edith reflected, was what drove many women into marriage.\\"  And: \\"And once you are married, you can behave as badly as everybody else.\\"<br /><br />Finally, Brookner teases you with the ending, as you wonder: Will she pull an \\"Edith Hope\\" herself?<br /><br />Positively 5-stars, particularly on the re-read.on both sides.\\" \\"I'm talking about the complacent consumers of men with their complicated but unwritten rules of what is due to them.

B00000DFTG|4.0|This is a great album for Black Sabbath but the vocals from Ozzy these days just plain suck.  They need to do a Reunion II with DIO, he can't still sing amazingly.  Dio Sabbath = real Sabbath, in doubt listen to this album, Ozzy sticks out like a shore thumb and wont shut up for five seconds so you can hear the bands (not ozzys) amazing performance.
B000XVT7SW|5.0|Long awaited video and masterfully cinematographed. The interpretation of Jon Vickers in my opinion exceeds expectation as he infuses drama and presence and perfect melody in his \\"Vesti la giuppa\\". None of this irritating laughter that clashes with the intensity of the moment and takes away the pain that he tries to convey. Highly recommended video for anyone looking for excellent singing and direction.
B000068R1X|5.0|This has always been the best Ozzy album in my eyes.  This album also contains classic songs Oz still plays in his live sets today, great metal album, awesome guitars, super riffs! \m/
B003JYOEYM|4.0|Like the title says, it's not Romero's best, but still a good flick. It has good pacing, and doesn't drag, like \\"Land of the Dead\\" (IMHO). Also it's not super action packed, but gives you enough to be entertained. It's best parts are the commentary on losing loved ones, and the measures we would go through to preserve them; and what living on a small island during a zombie outbreak would be like. And lastly, this flick has some of the best ways to kill a zombie in any Romero movie I've seen. If you want more action and thrills, you might wanna see \\"Land of the Dead\\", but if you want a good story with the classic zombie commentary this is for you.
B000002B7Y|1.0|Ozzy was never any good solo, more like pop metal.  This is ozzy doing hair metal...oh joy.  Ozzy sucks.

B001CDLATE|5.0|An artistic triumph taking the viewer around the world to illustrate mans contentious relationship with nature and oneself. The movie highlights the cyclical nature of our rise and falls throughout history and the impermanent quality of it all. A constant throughout throughout the film is is both the beauty and destruction perpetuated by man and nature in their ancient relationship and dance together.
B000063DIR|5.0|Ozzy was on fire after Blizard of OZZ, with the release of Diary it only escalated his solo prowess that much more.  From start to finish this album is amazing and just as awesome and better in some ways than Blizzard Of Oz.  Awesome, solid metal!  \m/

You know when you have an adorable, gifted and talented relative who doesn't know when to quit and keeps messing up your valuables? Well, Justin Timberlake's mitts have invaded \\"Hard Candy\\", along with that boorish Timberland. It's like your cute little relative smudging his or her hands all over your Limoges or heirloom tablecloths with chocolate. It was like an older relative trying to keep up with the little darling, but getting exhausted. The 'Timbers' overproduction and heavy beats overpowered Madonna's vocals.

Griffith's seminal \\"Birth of a Nation\\" have so many people, critics and moviegoers alike, been more ambivalent about a major cinematic work.  That ambivalence is perhaps best exemplified by Roger Ebert, who gave \\"Apocalypse\\" a \\"thumbs down\\" in his original review, and then subsequently rated it number one on his list of the best movies ever made.    Even Francis Coppola is ambivalent about his masterpiece; he reworked it more than once even before it was released, and did so again when he learned viewers were misinterpreting the exploding village behind the closing credits.  And then came \\"Redux\\", with an entirely new set of modifications.  This package allows you to render your own opinion on the original version versus Coppola's latest incarnation.    I was surprised, frankly - surprised that he expanded scenes which, in my humble opinion, did not need expanding at all (the plantation sequence and the Playboy Playmates, to name two) and left untouched the one part that begs for clarification: the ending.  Mind you, I understand the ending is intentionally murky; but it doesn't truly work - it's fundamentally unsatisfying - and when you so obviously funnel a story toward its ending from minute 1, there is an obligation to provide an ending with more definition, more imagery, more everything than Coppola has given us so far.    Coppola calls \\"Redux\\" the \\"definitive version\\", but let's hope not. One day, let's hope that he produces a third version that minimizes the plantation sequence, at least, and fleshes out the finale.  Of course, that may not be the definitive version either - but it would be gratifying to have at least one version that ends as it was supposed to, in Francis Coppola's original vision.    But for now, we must be happy with what we have - and this packaged set allows us to do thatbetter than we ever have before.
0802473156|5.0|I picked up this book after hearing a couple of people talk about it.  One said he thought it could have saved his marriage had he read it before he was divorced.  Naturally, I was curious and ordered a copy.<br /><br />It's an easy-to-read book and the stories the author uses to illustrate his points make it all very clear.  The five languages can be applied not only to marriage, but other relationships as well...definitely worth reading and passing on to someone you care about.
B0009UC810|5.0|Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi ARE the Blues Brothers.  Watching this again after 20 years or so, I'm amazed that the movie hasn't aged at all - the transfer looks great and the pair seem born for the part in their trademark shades and suits.<br /><br />Credit has to go to John Landis who was at the peak of his powers for putting together a completely seamless comedy-drama-musical, replete with car chases, somersaulting church congregations, and bazooka wielding women.  It sounds ridiculous to describe it, but it comes together completely.  According to Wikipedia, this made the film at the time, one of the most expensive movies ever at US $ 30 million.<br /><br />More than a 'Mission of God' - the Blues Brothers is a historical trip through the blues, as Jake and Ellroy Elwood go in search of their band, they find and live the music.  What other film would feature John Lee Hooker, James Brown, Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles credibly in a storyline?  Simply remarkable.  A film like this today would be impossible to make.  They really don't make them like this anymore.<br /><br />The documentary that's featured isn't tremendously exciting but informative nonetheless.<br /><br />PS - I think Dan Aykroyd lost something when Belushi died.
0439023483|5.0|Dear Suzanne,<br /><br />You don't mind if I call you Suzanne, do you?  I feel like I know you so well already, know the lovely, twisted inner workings of your mind that compelled you to create a masterful creation such as The Hunger Games.  You brought Katniss (\\"the girl who was on fire\\") and Peeta to life and showed them to me, and you made me fall in love with them and hate them, cry for them and cheer for them.  You introduced me to the sad world that they were born into, that of District Twelve,  \\"where you can starve to death in safety.\\" I don't like what you have done to me, Suzanne, leaving me feeling unclean and over-privileged, and then mocking me (that's right, just like the silly mockingjay) with this ridiculous trilogy that I must now read, that I must stop everything I am doing and get my hands on these books.<br /><br />  \\"The rules of the Hunger Games are simple.  In punishment for the uprising, each of the twelve districts must provide one girl and one boy, called tributes, to participate.  The twenty-four tributes will be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold anything from a burning desert to a frozen wasteland.  Over a period of several weeks, the competitors must fight to the death.  The last tribute standing wins.\\"<br /><br />What sick and twisted socio-political system could come up with such a thing?  And televise it for all to watch - that's just cruel and wrong and it makes me feel awful to admit it, but... brilliant.  I mean, I don't even like reality T.V., Suzanne, and I certainly would not want to watch your Hunger Games, let alone participate in them, but like a train wreck, I could not, and still cannot look away.  You have left me wanting more, with a need for understanding.<br /><br />I need to know Katniss, maybe even become her, because she is strong and full of spirit in a way that I long to be.  And in her actions, I see my own need for survival and struggle to maintain a relevance in life, when everything but living and dying has become so trivial.  I need to know that my life has not been minimized into a series of well angled camera shots as I shoot an arrow through another tributes heart, or that my friendship with Peeta is merely a contrived (and possibly made for T.V.) substitute of everyone that I left behind in District Twelve.  And maybe more than anything else, I need to know that Peeta does not lose himself, because he said those fateful words:  \\"I want to die as myself.  I don't want them to change me in there.  Turn me into some kind of monster that I'm not.\\"  Because if he lost himself, what does that make me?<br /><br />All of this need - it hurts, Suzanne.  Why did you do this to me?  And will you leave me again, paralyzed with need after Catching Fire?  I have a feeling you will because you're cruel like that, but like an obedient follower, I will be there, waiting patiently for this dystopia and whatever other meager rations of information and emotion that you have to offer me.<br /><br />I love you, Suzanne.

We all need work and this book is a great place to go looking; read it and move forward!
B000FS9FCG|5.0|I watch this movie at least once a month. The special effects are very subtle, but that is what makes them great. You will like the character V, but you will LOVE to hear him talk. The dialog in this movie is just out of sight.  The story is very cool, and the characters in the movie are well fleshed out. I have been surprised at how many people found this movie confusing. The pivotal detail appears later in the movie, but the sequence of events and motives are clear throughout the film. Do not be intimidated by the length of the movie, or the fact that it is a \\"comic\\" movie (I must say I love comics). None of this will matter b/c it is a great show regardless of the story's origins or duration. You will be left wanting more.
1401308201|5.0|This is a spectacular book! I am a huge Wicked fan and this tells the whole story of Wicked from the initial idea to touring productions. There is so much information, tons of great photos, and so many fun pages (including how to do Elphaba's dance), it keeps any Wicked fan busy for a long time. All in a beautiful book designed to look like Elphaba's book of spells.
0061537969|5.0|What happens when a very smart dog learns about the human world through his interactions with his family and what he sees on television? In his sensitive and highly spiritual novel, The Art of Racing in the Rain, author Garth Stein speaks in the voice of his unlikely hero, Enzo, a lab/terrier mix with a surprising philosophical bent.<br /><br />Enzo is a good and loyal dog who has long felt that he is not like other dogs. Once he watched a National Geographic documentary on Mongolia that talked about how, when a dog died, he was allowed to roam the plains until he was ready to come back, and, when the dog is ready, he will become a man.<br /><br />Enzo wants nothing more than to become a man. He feels he is already a human soul trapped in a dog's body. He envies men their thumbs and small tongues, and feels that if only he had thumbs, he could be so much more.<br /><br />Enzo has been a good and faithful companion to Denny Swift, a race car driver who gets derailed from his racing dreams by life. Through Denny, Enzo learns the art of driving a race car by focusing only in the moment and allowing connection to everything. Now, at the end of his life, Enzo reflects on his life with the Swift family. He looks forward to his reincarnation a a man, where he will use all he has learned from Denny to drive a race car. And in that life, he will seek Denny out, walk up to him, shake his hand and say, \\"Enzo says hello\\" with a wink and a nudge.<br /><br />Filled with gentle wisdom, The Art of Racing in the rain is a compassionate and sensitive novel that never feels preachy, but offers up a philosophical view of life and the beyond, why we are here, and how we can love and appreciate our lives as human beings. And there's no need to be a dog lover, an animal lover or a racing lover to be captivated by Enzo's message.

When I picked this book up in the fabric shop, I could not put it down. It's right up my alley -- I love antique/vintage fabrics. There is a good-sized photo of each quilt block & the fabrics are divine -- wonderful eye candy to me. There are block diagrams, too, for each block. I will certainly make many of these blocks, but I'll figure out the rotary cutting instructions myself. I don't do templates.

B0019OP0GU|1.0|I haven't read the book, so I had no idea what to expect. I heard people singing its praises, so I thought I'd watch it. It looked a little corny, so I was already braced for that. It's not really corny, it's just really boring. I don't have anything against British cinema or period set movies, but this one just went on and on and left me wondering where it was going.    The storyline is rushed, which wouldn't be that bad if they didn't also rush the character development. The movie just presents the girls as growing up into pretty teenagers that get sent to a performance academy due to financial need, this being paid by one of the elder sister's, Sylvia (Emilia Fox), tenants.     From there, you just get a feeling of entitlement from the girls. It's like watching a 30's set version of My Super Sweet Sixteen. Pauline (Emma Watson) soon gets a big head because she's pretty and it assures her roles in acting. Watson's acting is terrible. I love her in Harry Potter, probably because I'm so used to seeing her as Hermione, but even in that role I think she's a pretty mediocre actress. Ballet Shoes gave her a chance to shine on her own light, but she looks too old for the role and makes her character come off like a drama queen.     Posy (Yasmin Paige)is supposed to be gifted in ballet, hence the title, but other than that, we don't really see her dance well. Furthermore, it's not really clear why it should be titled Ballet Shoes because her dancing is a pretty minor thing in the plotline. It only makes her come off as a spoiled brat and only diverts the attention from golden-girl Watson for a mere seconds.    Speaking of temporary attention detractor, this brings me to Petrova (Lucy Boynton), who the movie treats just like the author did when picking her name. She moans a little bit about hating performance and wanting to be a pilot. The audience is supposed to feel sorry for this character but instead it just feels like a breath of fresh air to have a character not being painted as beautiful and talented in this movie. I didn't particularly like her more than the other orphans, but it was less boring to watch her struggle where she didn't belong than having to watch Watson's character whine because she was in an early film.    Overall, the movie version of Ballet Shoes butchers any meaning in the story by using cheap techniques like the apparently made-up romance between adult characters and constantly trying to make the audience feel sorry for the orphans. The former fails simply because they were adopted when they were babies by loving people, had the good fortune to find some random lady to pay for an education, where blessed with good looks and are considered talented enough to earn a living. They also kept reminding us they were poor, which I felt hard to sympathize with seeing as they still had new-looking clothes to wear and lived in a house bigger than mine.     Based on the reviews I've read, this movie is no good unless you have the lingering memory of the book. I have not read the book, so I only have the lingering memory of frequently checking how much time was left of the movie.
0679905278|5.0|I purchased this book hoping that it would be in good enough condition that I could give as a graduation gift. It arrived in perfect condition! Seems like brand new! I will not hesitate to give this to my nephew (with a few dollars tucked inside, of course!) I hope to give this same book to all my nieces and nephews as they graduate high school and begin thinking about the paths they will take in life.  It is very insightful and I have read it to them since they were toddlers.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Daria is a hilarious, satirical series about life in our self-obsessed, oblivious culture through the eyes of someone who rejects the bandwagon and any of the pressure to jump on it. Daria is a sardonic, brilliant teenage girl who is trapped inside of a meaningless school life and a disengaged home life alongside very superficial, preoccupied and/or clueless people-- She and her sidekick Jane have a scathingly sarcastic and deadpan way of making sense of the insanity around them, forced to go with the flow but never without a well placed witty zinger! The all time best quote from Daria was her comment regarding being forced by the school psychologist to endure a \\"Self Esteem\\" course: \\"I don't have low self esteem- I have low esteem for everyone else.\\" The episodes leave me shaking my head, smacking my leg and wanting to hit a rewind button over and over. My 16 year old son loves the other Daria episodes that were previously put on DVD and VHS.

1597801585|5.0|After living in Thailand for several years and being married to a Thai women, the book is accurate in the ways it uses the culture of Thailand and especially the way it deals with the climate warming, peak oil, and ecological destruction within the Thai cultural framework.  It was fascinating that he choose Thailand, and only referred to a broken-up Europe, a destroyed America (Emprie of America?), Finland ( seed bank in Norway), Japan (too many calories, not enough people),and China ripped apart into several small states,indirectly.  The peak oil scenario destroyed the power of these nations and it made sense that they would have no influnce except through the calorie companies of the \\"midwest compact\\" search for the \\"gene bank\\" in Thailand. Also, the technology was an intersting mix of approaches to harnessing energy without the benefit of oil, which has a tremendous influence on our culture, especally the alternative energy sources which are dependent on oil for their start-ups--and would hence have a difficut time gaining a foothold in Thailand (no solar panels or wind).  Also,the story of politics within Thailand with it's multiple competitors for power behind the scenes is true as it is today with the red and yellow shirts fighting each other on the streets, in 2010.  Also,the competing plot lines of the calorie man's search for the seed bank, Hock Seng's desire for lost position and wealth, and the most important is the story of Emiko's desire for freedom which is undermined by her genetics to obey a master which culuminates in her ultimate sexual subservience during a group gathering to witness her degradation and the eventual leading to her one impulsive act outside of her genetic programming.  It's a very good read and finds resolution of the plot conflicts. It was tantalizing with a an opening at the end for Emiko's search for freedom in a way that she didn't expect.

It picks up very fast and is very good, the cast is great and meshes very well with each other. It does not follow the books very well at all but what movie/show does. We look at it as an alternate story and enjoy both in their own ways. The second season is even better then the first! as of now the show will not continue to a third season unless fans get involved!

I was swayed by  all of the 5 star reviews & the &#34;its one of Kings best...you have to read this...you won't be disappointed&#34; comments. Boy; I sure was fooled! The Long Walk was one of the WORST books I have ever read. It did not even make sense. Maybe there is some kind of deep symbolism at play that just went over my head? 100 boys go for a walk & get shot if they walk too slowly. They fart...talk about sex...eat tubes of concentrated food...watch crowds who gather on the roadside wave at them...crap in the road while the crowd watches them. Its this over and over again. Save your time & money.

B000002KNU|5.0|For some REALLY strange reason, I've always been skeptical of Talking Heads '77.  Maybe it was the bland album cover.  Seriously, a bright red/orange cover is really boring to look at, haha.   I guess for the last several years a close-minded part of me was assuming the quality of the music would reflect the album cover.  BOY was I wrong!    I actually really love this album from beginning to end.  The songwriting is, of course, highly unusual, quirky and distinctive.  I wasn't expecting every moment of the album to be so darn memorable though.  Definitely a complete surprise when I found myself falling in love with every single song selection.    The lead singer sounds nervous when he sings, and I absolutely *love* his style.  The rest of the band supplies a great deal of little creative tricks as well, used to spice up the songwriting to even greater heights.    In fact the majority of these tunes should have been huge hits.  \\"Psycho Killer\\" managed to becom a hit (and rightfully so- I LOVE this song) but what about the REST of the tracks?  Find me one weak song on here and I'll eat my hat!      A classic album.  I personally prefer it over Remain In Light, which is supposed to be one of the Talking Heads very best albums.  You just can't beat creativity and originality when it's displayed *this* awesomely.
B003AYBCV4|5.0|The previous reviewer was disappointed that this CD wasn't as good as the Audio Fidelity remastering of \\"Parsley, Sage, Rosemary & Thyme\\".  As far as the absolute sound of the finished product, maybe that's true.  But I guarantee that has nothing to do with AF and has more to do with what is on the master tape itself.    A much more apt comparison in my opinion would be in line with the intent of the product: how it compares to the generally available CD release.  In this category, this disc is absolutely wonderful and beats even the \\"Parsley, Sage\\" remaster.  Whether you have the current 2001 release (which is actually a remix) or the original Columbia CD from the '80s, I think you'll be pleased.  Both of these AF S&G releases are of the original mix that was only recently uncovered (after being thought to be lost or too worn out).  If you have the 2001 CD releases, these will sound significantly different.  Vic Anesini did a great job, but the Audio Fidelity releases restore the original echo chamber sound - instead of the digital reverb found in the 2001 remix/remasters.  My favorites are the title track, \\"Richard Cory\\" and \\"I Am a Rock\\".  These also restore the missing midrange in the 2001 versions.  Also, if you have any compilation made after 1997 (when the remixes were actually done), you do not have the original versions of these songs.  That includes \\"Old Friends\\" 3-disc set, \\"The Best of S&G\\", and \\"The Essential S&G\\".  Buy this disc if you are a fan!!    All in all, I'd say the Audio Fidelity \\"SOS\\" is a bigger sonic improvement than \\"PSR&T\\".  I would have paid twice as much for this disc.

0140259449|5.0|Jane Austen. Her name is practically synonymous with classic, understated romance, as well as comedies of manners with a subtle, sly sense of humor.<br /><br />And Austen's \\"The Complete Novels\\" brings together the full complement of her finished novels, from the little-known \\"Lady Susan\\" to the classic bestseller \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" (and everything in between). This collection is flled with lovably flawed heroines, beautiful formal prose, and some rather unconventional love stories.<br /><br />\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" become a problem when Elizabeth Bennett takes a dislike to the handsome, aloof Mr. Darcy, helped by his own aloofness and the devious Mr. Wickham's stories about him. But Mr. Darcy isn't quite the villain -- he's the hero. And \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" clash when the two very different Dashwood sisters, smart Elinor and romantic Marianne, both fall in love -- one with a man she can't have, and the other with a guy who may be horribly unsuitable.<br /><br />Anne Elliott has a problem with \\"Persuasion,\\" since she was once briefly engaged to the impoverished sailor Frederick Wentworth. Now he's returned from war as a wealthy hero... and Anne still loves him. \\"Mansfield Park\\" is the backdrop for shy Fanny's life with her rich relatives, who usually treat her as a servant -- except for her kindly cousin, Edmund. But when the flirtatious, fashionable Crawfords arrive in the neighborhood, it unbalances the lives of everyone at Mansfield Park.<br /><br />And \\"Northanger Abbey\\" is a fitting location for Austen's spoof on gothic romances, in which the hyperimaginative Catherine Moreland has to learn a lesson about the difference between fantasy and reality. \\"Emma\\" is a frothy romantic comedy about a rich, somewhat spoiled young lady who tries to arrange the lives of people around her so that everyone is happy.  And there's \\"Lady Susan,\\" who is sort of the evil sociopathic twin of Emma -- a brilliant and manipulative widow who seduces, plots and schemes. Yummy stuff.<br /><br />The omnibus collection displays the range and depth of Austen's writing skill beautifully; though each story is very unique they're laced together by common themes. Except for \\"Lady Susan,\\" each story is a love story, tempered with some clever commentary on the society of Austen's day (example: entailment, which plays a part in several plots), and a biting, sharp-edged wit (the mockery of the toadying Mr. Collins and the obnoxious Elliott family).<br /><br />And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen painted her stories vividly -- there's a bit of roughness in \\"Lady Susan\\" and \\"Persuasion,\\" but nothing too dramatic. Each one has powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"), as well as deliciously witty dialogue (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But she also weaves in some intensely romantic moments as well (\\"Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death. I have loved none but you\\").<br /><br />Austen also had an interesting range of heroines -- quiet ones, melodramatic ones, intelligent ones, naive ones, and mildly spoiled ones who think they know best. But each one has a major character flaw that must be overcome before she can find true love and happiness And she has an equally fascinating range of love interests: the quiet shy Colonel Brandon, the sexy and clever Henry Tilney, the blunt Mr. Knightley, the generous and honest Edmund, and especially the smart, sexy Mr. Darcy (who has a flaw of his own to overcome alongside Lizzie).<br /><br />Jane Austen's \\"Complete Novels\\" draws together all her finished novels, and let readers explore the mannered society and obstacle-filled love lives of her heroines.f.<br /><br />The omnibus collection displays the range and depth of Austen's writing skill beautifully; though each story is very unique they're laced together by common themes.

1402210795|5.0|This was quite an unexpected treasure of a novel! The characters were so absolutely real they felt like they leapt off the page into breathing, and the dialogue and events were so amusing I found myself constantly laughing aloud- so much so that my husband would stop his online RPG to ask me what was so funny. (And now he plans to read it!) I was delighted by this tale and consider it one of Heyer's very best- along with the aforementioned books [[ASIN:1402219474 These Old Shades]] and [[ASIN:1402219504 The Masqueraders]].
140120841X|5.0|In the great Alan Moore's book \\"V For Vendetta,\\" V is an intriguing anti-hero, strangely clad in a black robe and a Guy Fawkes mask, rebelling against the fascism of post-nuclear war England.  The mood is Blade Runner meets Orwell's 1984.  \\"V\\" is typical Alan Moore brilliance: deep characterization, dialogue that draws upon classic literature, and political/philosophical blood coursing through its veins.  The interplay between V and his female \\"protégé\\" Evey is particularly satisfying; it both moves the story along and adds definition to the characters.    If you are like me and slept through most of the forgettable movie, go out and read this book!  \\"V for Vendetta\\" shows clearly Moore's maturation as a writer, as he went on to masterpieces like Watchmen and Swamp Thing.      The artwork in this volume is not captivating and at times is hard to follow.  Alan Moore credits the artist David Lloyd with being a co-creator of the storyline.  I'm spoiled by the level of artistry in graphic novels today.  The inking and colors in \\"V\\" are primitive in quality compared to today's stratospheric standards.  Perhaps some of the sparse panels were done for artistic effect - so I could be misinterpreting what the artist was trying to accomplish.    This novel rises to the level of quality fiction such as 1984 or Animal Farm, dispensing with the tired superhero genre.  On a broader level, this book made me contemplate why and how superheroes had hijacked the graphic medium in the United States for so long.  Only recently are we getting top-quality \\"comic books\\" that don't deal with superheroes - such as \\"Fables\\" \\"Last Man\\" and \\"Ex Machina.\\"  \\"V for Vendetta\\" blazed a trail for those modern masterpieces, even though it took decades for them to follow.
0373774184|5.0|Ah! I wish I could read this anew without knowing what was coming next- and slowly savor the moments. It is a love story through and through. My, oh my- you will have to read it yourself to see what I mean!
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|This movie was well done. It was also dark and disturbing. Mystic River showed what can happen when a frustrated man takes the law into his own hands after his daughter is murdered. I thought the ending was sad. I won't give too much away; this movie is definitely worth watching. I'm glad I finally saw it.
1878424114|5.0|The heart is holistic, contextual and intuitive, Chopra MD argues. He is right. Intention is transformation of energy and information. His unique way of expressing the Seven Laws was informative and easy to use. Seven laws include : Potentiality, Giving, Karma (Cause and Effect), Least effort, Intention and Desire, Detachment, and Dharma (True purpose).<br />I believe the book is worth the money. At the time is was written, his ideas and these conceptions were cutting edge in Self awareness/Universalist (someone who believes in all paths and respects the differences in others) movement. This is an ideal I follow and I realize it is tough as it asks you to accept all and judge noone including yourself. I recommend this to spiritual people and people desiring to see how they can work with Energy/thought and affirmation to create desired outcomes.
B0010X745K|5.0|This movie was a little gorey, but scary. The Mist had a different ending than Stephen King's story. I have to admit, I didn't like the ending to the movie. I preferred the story's ending. Both the story and the movie are highly recommended.
0307593525|5.0|Volume 1 of this set is so concise and has so many of the basic details necessary to lose the fear of a kitchen and dive right in I would recommend it to anyone who sees a spark in their friend or child to pursue a cooking passion.<br /><br />The classic recipes are just a joy to read...a little heavy to produce but well worth owning and using as a launch pad into a variety of different menus!<br /><br />Love it, wish I could get it signed, but it will be treasured forever!

B0031RAOVY|5.0|A very heart warming show.  I highly  recommend all dog lovers to watch this  film.
B001JAFYFG|4.0|I was wary of this purchase due to other reviewer's claims of a poor transfer. However, I found this Blu-Ray Disc to be very clear and clean. The original print used to make the transfer from does have scratches and the colours seem a bit washed-out, and the special effects were 70s effects and not up to today's standards... but there really wasn't very much graininess at all (which is my major peave). So, I was pleased. They did a very good job with this older film.

B000HT3PPG|5.0|Miracle on 34th Street - what can you say - but one of the best Christmas movies ever! There have been many remakes and knockoffs of this move but not one can hold a candle to the original. Whether in black and white or colorized, this is an enjoyable movie to watch with the whole family. The storyline, acting and setting of the movie can never be duplicated. It is a smart well crafted movie that will \\"tug at the heart strings\\". It is a must to see and if there is anyone out there that hasn't seen this movie (???), do yourself a favor and rent, Netflix and, better yet, purchase the movie to have for your own video library.
0393072231|5.0|The Big Short by Michael Lewis was too intoxicating to put down. The insights on derivatives, CDO's and the shenanigans played behind the scenes on Wall St. went way beyond the realm of most expectations. Unbelievable what they could do with leverage and other peoples money with no apparent government intervention, or regulation! Proof that there is an aristocratic class in America that operates above and beyond the normal rules of society with total disregard for ethics or any sense of fiduciary responsibility. A must read for anyone who would even contemplate putting their money, let alone their their faith in Wall St.
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|The new Slash CD is pretty amazing. So many different artists one CD. And with Amazons pricing system I ended up only Paying $7.99 per CD and it arrived on time.
B001T30232|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read. It might sound cliche, but I connected with Enzo and Denny, the main characters, like I've never connected with a character before. The ending moved me to tears and I truly believe this book has changed the way I live. I can't write much more about the book because I don't have enough words ready to write down that convey my emotions about it, but I feel like I have to recommend this book to everybody I can right now.    Hearing Enzo recount feats of racing drivers like Senna and Fittipaldi helped me like the book, too :)    If you can read, you should read this book. If you love dogs, or racing, or both, you should read this book this very moment.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|Movie was great, arrived on time and in excellent condition. I will do business with this seller again.
0316069906|5.0|I  have gone back and forward with vegetarianism throughout my life.  So the basis for the \\"unrest\\" I have always felt was always there.  This time though, after reading Jonathans book, I have not looked back. I have purchased this book 8 times so far; and have given it out to that many people in my life whom have showed some interest and an open mind to simply find out about the facts of how our food is being brought to our plates.  I do not take the stance that I am better than any person who chooses to eat animals.  I do not look down on any person who maintains that choice.  I do however urge everyone to be informed about what they are putting into their bodies, and this book is an excellent vehicle to gather that information.  The one thing I can say since I made the switch, is that I have never felt this kind of peace.  In a world that is nothing but stress and agitation, my life was exactly that, stressfull and agitated.   Just knowing that I no longer participate in tortured flesh has brought me a sort of balance that I have been searching for my whole life.      Jonathan writes this book from an unbaised place...of course he is vegetarian, but his writing simply states the facts without adding in his own emotion and opinions. He writes in a way that is captivating and clear.  He writes in a way that allows the reader to make their own opinions about the facts that are stated.  This is a very powerful book, one that I will continue to buy again and again and handout to anyone who is willing to open their eyes.  My favorite quote from this book:  \\"Even the slightest sound will wake someone who is sleeping, but no amount of noise will wake someone who is pretending to be asleep.\\"  READ THIS BOOK...it is amazing.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Our family loves this movie, and for a family of parents and teens to all like the same movie can be rare.  We like Sandra Bullock in almost anything, so we did not analyze this story line and what parts were believable/true, etc.      The \\"feel-good-ness\\" of the movie comes from:    *  seeing people doing something daring and rare,  *  seeing, as another reviewer stated, the power of mentors,  *  seeing love in action with no strings attached,  *  seeing a John Doe nobody become something great    I felt like paying it forward more often after I watched this...inspired into action.
B00005KARK|5.0|Item was just as described ... in like new shape; looked brand new!  No scratches on CD at all; played perfectly!  Thank you!
0385504225|3.0|I like the plot of the book \\"holy grail of masons\\" and enjoy the books from the author. There were many repetitions of characters and their physical state but there was no physical change. I like the pyramid concept and decoding the message or secret location. I think digital fortress was much better version of solving the clues but this book doesn't provide interesting clues.  I am not sure of why liquid oxygen[...] is used to drown Langdon as Mal'akh wants to destroy all clues to reveal the secret.    Overall the book is good and little too long.

B000LAZDQA|4.0|Shortbus (2006) written/directed by John Cameron Mitchell (Hedwig and the Angry Inch) is truly not for the easily offended. It is the film like nothing I've seen before and I've seen many films. It should be named Real Sex and the City or Every Thing You Always Wanted to Know About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask had not the latter title been taken already by Woody Allen. Actually you don't have to ask anything - you will get more information and graphic answers that you ever would hope for. This is the film where the graphical sex scenes are in abundance, they are extremely explicit. John Cameron Mitchell means business, and he gets down to it. By his own words,<br /><br />\\"In the old days, when you couldn't show sex on film, directors like Hitchcock had metaphors for sex (trains going into tunnels, etc). When you can show more realistic sex, the sex itself can be a metaphor for other parts of the character's lives. The way people express themselves sexually can tell you a lot about who they are. Some people ask me, \\"couldn't you have told the same story without the explicitness?\\" They don't ask whether I could've done Hedwig without the songs. Why not be allowed to use every paint in the paint box?\\" John Cameron Mitchell<br /><br />But after the initial shock, you realize that there are ideas, feelings, the attempt to understand the important things - what do we want? What is sex for us? How to understand ourselves first of all, how to communicate your desires, how to fulfill them? Shortbus is totally honest; it does care about its characters, and tells their stories of struggling with all sorts of existential difficulties, sexual or not, without condescending, with the equal dozes of sweetness, wit, and understanding. The film was made by a talented filmmaker. The beginning scenes would certainly grab your attention while introducing a viewer to few New Yorkers whose lives will be intertwined later. The music score and the songs are nice and set a melancholic mood, they provide a welcomed rest for the passengers on the Shortbus. The cast that consists mainly of non-professional first time performers, did a convincing job. It is not porn, it is an independent dramedy that uses sex scenes to answer many questions about life.<br /><br />The DVD includes the documentary Gifted and Challenged: The Making of 'Shortbus'. I found the Making... quite interesting and a lot of fun.<br /><br />3.5-4/5a welcomed rest for the passengers on the Shortbus.

B0030Y11XS|4.0|It was the abuses of 19th Century-style Capitalism - excessively long hours at low pay, violent strike-breaking, child-labor and the like - that helped give Communism its initial appeal.  As a cure, however, Communism was worse than the disease, yet some of the worst capitalistic ills were still removed.  The corruption that often comes with big wealth has never gone away, but, as Michael Moore contends in his documentary, Capitalism:  A Love Story, it is more ruinous now than ever.    The problems (as Moore presents them) are linked to the excessive ties between business and government, particularly (but not solely) under Reagan and Bush, Jr.  This resulted in a number of financial disasters, most significantly in 2008 when economic collapse seemed imminent.  But was there really the danger of collapse, or was it just another scheme by Goldman, Sachs, et al?    For those familiar with Moore's narrative style, this movie will fit right in with other works such as Sicko and Farenheit 911.  Much as Moore is good at illustrating his points (often with humor), he has his flaws too.  For one thing, he meanders a lot and some of his most compelling issues - like companies taking life insurance policies out on employees and children being sent to institutions by a judge more interested in kickbacks than justice - are not followed through on very thoroughly.  Moore also tends to hold \\"the people\\" completely innocent (if a bit naive), ignoring the fact that many of them were spending money they shouldn't have.    The movie presents Obama as the President who may turn things around, a promise that seems still up in the air right now.  Of course, Obama would have just been starting his presidency when this film was completed.  It's often a very slapdash movie, but Capitalism:  A Love Story also will make you angry at a system that offers a lot but often delivers only a little.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I already owned some of the previously released Beatles CDs.  The first two albums Please Please Me and With the Beatles will sound quite different in stereo, and I'll have to admit wasn't sure if I liked it, but after further listening I'm glad I got the stereo.  The songs are crisper especially Ringo's percussion contributions can be better appreciated on stereo.  Hard Day's Night, Help and Sgt. Pepper also never sounded better!  This box set also includes all the Beatles singles which in itself is a real treat.  I hadn't heard some of these songs in years!  I am enjoying all of this fab music from the most important rock band in the history of rock music.  You will also enjoy the mini documentary DVD that is included.  It is informative as well as entertaining.  This box set is a real treasure for any Beatles fan!  I love you George!!!

B003JYOEYM|5.0|George Romero's latest installment of the dead series offers a new look in the world of the dead. Taking yet another look at a cross-segment of Americans and how they deal with an apocalyptic scenario gives us clashing view points on how a small community may come to terms with a drastic change in their way of life.      Many people who view this film will apppreciate the new avenue they are being driven down and will come away with a smile on their face for an original storyline that could hold water in many different genre's. Others may find the film pretentious and will long for the days where zombies trap and stalk happless victims who are confused and affraid by the situation they are in.      If you are looking for an action film gorefest this film will not be up your alley, however, if you are looking for an interesting story with zombies and guts thrown in you might just enjoy this ride.
B0013D8LG8|5.0|-----\\"First Knight (Special Edition)\\" is a great movie.     All the actors were good.     The movie has a good mix of action, visuals, and drama.     It can be seen many times.     I recommend it for everyone.     The \\"Special Features\\" are good.     The feature on movie sword fighting vs. real sword fighting was educational.     Enjoy!  ---Jim

0307269981|4.0|Stieg Larson scores again with the second book in his suspenseful trilogy.  Anyone who likes psychology, mysteries and strong heroines will enjoy \\"The Girl...\\" This book fills in a lot of the blanks left by book one, but also leaves with a cliff-hanger ending.  I will definitely be reading part three of the Salander/Blomquist saga.  When Hillary Clinton talks about raising the place of women around the world, I think of Salander.  She is amazingly tough, but fighting the good fight -- defending herself and other women from oppression.  Don't get me wrong, men will like this book too.  My 96-year-old father read book one and is looking forward to book two.

B00000K44W|4.0|Let's review this for what it is now, not what it was then. What it was then, was just another Tull album. They were churning out nearly one a year, they were one of the most extensively touring groups in the `70s, they were maturing. Those of us in our teens and twenties were thinking \\"What happened to our rocking Jethro Tull? Only half of this album rocks and then not very hard.\\" Were we getting bored with them, taking them for granted? Probably. Soon, \\"Heavy Horses\\" was relegated to the discount bins as an ill fated \\"cutout\\" album. (But, how many of us remember what great finds could be found in the those boxes of \\"cutouts\\"! Flipping through hundreds of albums at places like Woolco and walking out with half a dozen \\"finds\\" for 99 cents each! Those were the days kiddies!)     What it is now (as we are all older and can appreciate it) is a unique combination of Celtic folk music and rock and roll that has never been and can no longer be duplicated. It can be copied, but one can never duplicate the original. Each song is complex and masterful. Ian Anderson and his mates were at the peak of their artistic prime, turning out phenomenal compositions that, unfortunately, probably did not meet the expectations of their less than sophisticated fans at the time. (I put myself in that group, being in college at the time and wanting to party.) \\"Aqualung\\" and \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\" had become the quintessential Tull party albums of the day and we wanted more of that. Both \\"Heavy Horses\\" and its predecessor \\"Songs from the Wood\\", when listened to with a mature ear, are like hearing them for the first time. They are amazing! We can sit down, take a load off, and listen to the work and appreciate its complexity and artistry. The interplay between each of the players and the instruments is amazing. The sense of timing perfect, and the variety of tempo and rhythm contained in each song is anything but boring. They still manage to rock fairly substantially and more than I realized some 30 years (+) ago.     If you are considering revisiting these Tull albums, and are perhaps reading this review, then by all means consider it no more and get this back on your sound system. (be sure you get the 2003 re-mastered versions) Only now, listen to it. Sit back with a book, or glass of wine and just let it play. You will be surprised how often you just stop, listen to it and think: \\"Wow\\" this is amazing stuff. I forgot just how really good it is.\\" There is nothing like it (even close) being put out today, and I am including some cutting edge, fantastic prog such as the Flower Kings and Porcupine Tree. (Yes, I can change and grow with the times as well.) I can't give \\"Heavy Horses\\" (and \\"Songs from the Wood\\") five stars when compared to Tull's earlier works, (some which are ensconced as \\"essential\\" when considering the history of contemporary rock), but it sure is a solid four and 1/2. After a 30 year absence I am listening to this album(s) as if it just came out and I am enjoying it for the first time.     Post script: Don't give up on Ian Anderson and Jethro Tull. Be sure to check out later releases such as \\"Catfish Rising\\" and \\"Roots to Branches\\". More mature works but still the trademark Tull sound.

B002Z7FWBI|4.0|Watching this series again makes me wish we could send \\"Dirty Harry\\" to Congress!  It's a classic \\"Good vs. Evil\\" action series and it's nice to temporarily re-enter a world where the \\"Good\\" wins - regardless of how hard it was to prevail.  Also, I'm glad I got the set before somebody foolishly supposes that they can do an remake or \\"upgrade\\" of this character!
0385523386|2.0|The book sounded so interesting that I couldn't wait to read it.  The 1st chapter was fantastic but then that was it. Kerman does not tell the whole story, it is quite obvious.  She casually glances over the fact that she was a lesbian and a drug smuggler. Instead she goes into uninteresting details about women she meets in prison.  In fact, there is so many women she writes about that you cannot keep their names straight and after a few chapters, I know longer cared to keep them straight.  I find it very hard to believe that drugs and her sexuality didn't play a bigger part in this story.  It seems like she is trying to keep it a PG-13 rating for some reason.  I say just tell the truth or just take out some F words and sell it as a YA novel.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|This is an awesome series that had me hooked from the first episode I watched.  Pure fantasy and fun along with the most beautiful scenery New Zealand has to offer.

B0026I4EU6|5.0|I know Marcus Luttrell. We were stationed in Hawaii at the same time and he and several of the SEALs from SDVT-1 used to come down to the bar that I was a bouncer at part-time. Marcus, his brother Morgan (I called them the \\"twin towers\\") and the other guys that I met helped my son decide on his course of action to become a SEAL. Marcus was at the bar one night after he had returned from Operation Red Wing and I noticed that he had changed. I realized that he had just returned from his harrowing ordeal and talked with him about it. He was very humble about his experience (and I'm pretty sure the op was still classified, so he couldn't say much). Marcus and his Brother are both exceptional men, and I am proud to have known them. Trying to get in touch with Marcus again, as I live in Texas now...and he also lives back in Texas where he belongs. This book is a well written work that will help immortalize the lives of the guys (Su,Axe,Yankee{Mikey} and Dietz) who gave their lives for their Nation. Reading this book gives a very concise narrative of events from the only survivor of that op. It's as if Marcus is telling you in person, the story of his ill-fated team. Thank God that Marcus was spared to be able to pass on the story of the courage of these men, and men like them.  God Bless Marcus, his brother, Morgan; his team mates and all service members that have served and/or are currently serving our great nation. If you have the opportunity to meet Marcus or his brother, you'll see what I mean. Genuinely nice people, and an honor and a priveledge to know them. With deepest respect...Andy  \\"Si Vis Pacem, para bellum\\" - If you seek peace, prepare for war.

It includes all essays and extra drawings from previous compilations, and is hard-bound very attractively. It is a great purchase for anyone who loves Calvin and Hobbes!
B000VSAEYI|1.0|Had this pool for exactly one week before it a two-foot seam spontaneously ripped open, thus leaving it absolutely destroyed and useless.  The sad part is that my son never really even used the actual pool; he just loved the sprinkler part. That means this stinky turd of a product hardly had any wear and tear, save for a fair amount of water pumping through it for that week.  In fact, when it exploded, my son was nowhere near the pool.  It just ... whooooooosh ... exploded in a tidal wave of water.    Sounds like other people have had good experiences with this pool, and minus the durability issues, it was pretty sweet.  Still, I'd steer clear if I were you.

I'm not a technical photographer, so don't know how he does it, but with pictures this engaging I don't care.  I would have liked to have bought some of his prints, but they are way out of my price range.  These are stunning photos - if you like African wildlife, you won't be disapppointed.

Leave it to Amazon to offer such a great deal! For around $1.50 per disk (with each disk having 3-4 episodes on it), you can't beat this price. This is such a wonderful family show, and I am so glad to be able to watch this show again and relive my childhood memories of watching this every Saturday evening with my family. My friends and I now regularly have \\"Dr. Q nights\\" where we'll watch a few episodes, and I am able to make new memories while watching this wonderful show!
B002RI9S2Y|1.0|I only read 10 pages of this book and had to put it down. i never judge a book until i have finished it, but with percy jackson i had to put it down straight away. the writing technique is useless and the whole story line is a complete copy of harry potter. 0 stars.
B002VECM72|5.0|What an incredible ride this story represents!  Even with the typical Hollywood embellishments, it represents a great story that's well told.  A must see for the hold family.  A truly faith and life affirming movie that's worth owning.
B001ED7C58|5.0|[[ASIN:B001ED7C58 Twilight Soundtrack]]  Absolutely amazing!  The music takes me back into the movie.  The diversity of the songs is brilliant.  It is emotional just listening to the songs.  Wonderful soundtrack, glad to own it.  Probably need to buy another, I'm about to wear this one out!
B0017XD3OY|4.0|OK, this movie was pretty good but, not great. Oh...it was CREEEEPY!  :)<br /><br />Will Smith does a great job of acting (5 stars for him)<br /><br />The plot is good - kept us engaged but, somebody dropped the ball. There were a few things that would have made the movie much better like showing how smart the \\"mutants\\" were, more flashbacks etc. 20 more minutes would have solved this. (4 stars)<br /><br />Special effects were....\\"so so\\". (3 stars). The mutants were obviously CGI and not believable.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This is an excellent film adaptation of Elizabeth Gaskell's masterpiece North & South, the story of a woman who moves from a lovely, countryside existence to a English textile mill town due to her mother's health concerns.   The film is not the typical English garden, cottages, everything is lovely atmosphere but instead reflects the overall atmosphere of a mill town:  many dark, rainy days, little grass, views of factory areas, dark colors for costumes, and very impoverished characters.  Even the leads are not \\"hollywood handsome\\" in the typical sense....yet this is the beauty of the film in that the setting is realistically reflective of a mill town, prior to unionized labor, when mill workers were not protected by health laws, or child labor laws, and where illness and want were a matter of course.       This is not a happy, wappy, let's go to the ball sort of movie...but one that deals with the serious socioeconomic issues of life in such a town between the mill owner and his desire to keep the people employed and his mill working, the workers who are underpaid and undernourished and want the mill owner to pay more, and the main character who wants things to improve for both sides.   There is a slight romance, characters in general are low key, and the focus is on relationships as well as the economic realities that affect those relationships.  Overall it is not a cheery film but a poignant,worthwhile, entrancing one, with a feel good ending.  An excellent, serious film, as you can see from all the other reviews. (G-rated).    If you are looking for a film of similar superlative quality with a less serious, somber slant,  the same author wrote \\"Wives & Daughters\\" which is more Jane Austen like, in that the emphasis is on social interactions in a small English village, beautiful costuming, a romance as well as an intriguing plot and many wonderful characters.  You can purchase it or borrow from a library, but it is superb. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GIXLUC/ref=cm_cr_mts_prod_img
B002JVWR9U|5.0|The best new show on television!!!!  It may have been aimed for the younger viewer,  but I'm in my late 40s & LOVE it!!!!  Can't wait for the next season!
0142410349|5.0|I personally have not read this book, however; I did enjoy the movie. My daughter, 9, loves this book and has reread it several times.
B000SMWUPS|4.0|Our City Mini doesn't have any sort of tray or cup holders so this purchase was a must.  I have to say that for the price this cannot be beat.  We can bring a bottle of water (or 2), cell phone, keys, sunglasses, and still have room to put the dogs retractable leash in there too.  Great purchase!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Was addicted to the show after the 1st episode!  Am now a fan on facebook!  Love it, love it, love it!  Will get season 2 the day it comes out!
B001E45XT4|4.0|Overall:  Great deal for the money.  Got it on sale here at Amazon.    Likes:  -  Playback audio quality is sharp for movies, video and games.  I could hear a few gritty details in movies that I'd not heard in a while compared to my super-cheap ($15) headset.  -  Mic sound quality is good according to my workmates.  Tucks away when not in use.  -  Really comfortable after tweaking them for my size 8 head.  I had to gently but firmly expand the headband.  -  Cheap.    Dislikes:  -  Just mentioning if you are looking for a headset that's also 'quieting'.  I was not looking for a 'noise isolating' headset but I was a little surprised at how much nearby noise I can hear with these on.  The soft-foam surrounds are super comfortable, as mentioned, but I think it's partially because they are so breathable.  This also allows external noise to compete with the audio.  -  If you like to wear the headphones on your head with the headband at the base of your neck, this might not be the one for you.  I do that because I go from working at the computer to visiting clients and I don't want to mash down the hair at the very top of my head.  It sits a little awkwardly on my head in this position, more so than other headphones I've tried.    Regrets:  None
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This has got to be one of the most fantastic movies I have ever seen. Just be prepared to cry. If you are a pet lover of any sort, especially dogs, your heart will be broken. But on the flip side, you will also gain much knowledge and love for your pets. This movie will change the way you look at your dog. As for me, my two Labs were right by my side as I watched. I hugged them through out the entire movie.  And men, don't be surprised if tears fall from your eyes as well. They did from my husband. The loyalty shown by this fantastic dog will stir you to know that your pet as well,has just as much  love and loyalty to give you. Rent it, or buy it. But make sure you you don't miss it!!
B001JNNDGA|5.0|This version does include both the Original Theatrical Version and the Recut Version Edited for Graphic Depictions.
B002ZMZBD2|5.0|Awesome music to accompany an outstanding movie.  Hans Zimmer really captures the essence of Holmes and Watson's relationship with his unique style.  I challenge you not to start swaying with the music and getting into it.  This movie was definitely wrongfully shunned at the OSCARS.  By far better story than AVATAR.
0689870272|5.0|This book lives up to the hype. We got it for our daughter when she was like 8-9 months old and she's grown to anticipate what the animals say by around 15 months old. She excitedly asks for this book. Lots of the Boynton titles are pretty good, but this one was a natural fit.
B002ZOHVN8|3.0|Dont try to fix it.... The editors were doing great with the style of thier first two cd's. This is a bid departure. Overall, the first third of the cd is very good. The remaining two thirds of it is not their best material. I dont mind the synth oriented stuff , its just that they did not do it well. The songs have odd topics that just dont move me like the other previous material did.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|For a long time I dreaded watching this movie because I thought it would get a little long, as per the usual Michael Moore fare.  To my delight, I discovered that this film does an excellent job of exposing ironies and fallacies in our health care system.  The ironies are so well displayed that several times I burst out laughing.  So many points are made throughout the film.  What is especially startling are 9/11 rescue workers who have to go to Cuba to get good health care.  While the Al Quaida terrorists are getting top of the line treatment at Guantanamo Bay.  It is truly unreal.  I consider this movie to be Michael Moore's best.
B00371QQ2U|5.0|we watch this on our new LED tv and it's totally clear, makes you feel like you are part of the action. totally worth the movie.
B0031ZWZR2|5.0|Shows that make us THINK are awesome. Unfortunately, they are not for the masses. But if you like to ponder the nature of our existence, time, fate/destiny vs. free will, quantum physics and how it relates to all these things, alongside suspense and drama, Flash Forward is for you.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I totally agree with this film, I'm happy they made something about our current fast food we eat, it changed my world on what I eat, watch this movie it's worth the renting. eat organic and shop at whole foods and farmers markets.
B001C3KCSY|4.0|CD arrived in great condition and on time. No complaints here...and the price was right.
B002SQ364Q|5.0|I just loved this movie!!  It took me back to a time in my youth when everything was so simple. I thought it was so funny that it kept me laughing. I didn't want the movie to end! Great memories!
B00000DG1R|4.0|CD arrived in great condition and on time. No complaints here...and the price was right.
B002MBAJ4M|1.0|My husband & I are long-time Mule fans but wouldn't recommend buying this CD. It is by far our least favorite Mule release ever. It's dark and depressing, with songs like Railroad Boy. A slow song with a monotonous beat about suicide...really??? I thought By A Thread might grow on me after a few playings, but that hasn't happened. It's been packed away and we're back to playing the old stuff.
B000WMEAKC|4.0|CD arrived in great condition and on time. No complaints here...and the price was right.
0877180121|5.0|My 6 year old daughter, who is just starting to read, loves this book. It is simple enough that she can read the instructions, but still interesting. She loved being able to move forward through the book on her own.
1591843162|5.0|Linchpin is the most personal work by Seth Godin and his most passionate and compelling call to action yet.  When you are done you'll want every person in your organization to read this book. Few of the messages here are new, but the combination of ideas and the clarity of the writing makes this book, like Godin himself, indispensable.  In short, his message is: The world is changing. Obeying the rules doesn't cut it anymore.  To have an extraordinary life, you must be remarkable.  And you can start now, in your current job, without waiting for permission.    I'll include here a short synopsis of the book, a list of all his recommended reading, and then a series of quotes that I wanted to re-read myself.    Synopsis by chapter:    The New World of Work: The industrial revolution demanded workers who follow instructions.  The world has now changed, and there aren't any more good jobs where you get rewarded well for obeying the rules.  What the world now demands is people who are remarkable and make a difference, people who don't need to be told what to do.    Thinking About Your Choice: Everyone can choose to become indispensable.  You can start now, in your current job.  Indoctrination: How We Hot Here: School indoctrinates us to obey authority and doesn't have much to do with becoming educated.  Draws heavily on John Taylor Gatto.    Becoming the Linchpin: Become an expert in your field. Do emotional labor - be willing to make a connection and be remarkable. You'll need to work without a map.  Avoid jobs where there is a standard of perfection, because there is no profit once you start up the asymptote.  Instead, find a job where there is no upper limit on performance.  Instead of a resume, have a portfolio, a set of recommendations, a blog, a reputation for being remarkable.   In skiing, the one who leans the most wins the race.  A linchpin leans into the task.     Is It Possible to Do Hard Work in a Cubicle?  Defining art - in the sense that has nothing to do with a paintbrush.  Art defined as anything that's creative, passionate, and personal; as a personal act of courage, something that produces change in another person.  The Resistance: This chapter draws heavily on The War of Art. Artists ship.  Tips on overcoming the resistance.  Signs that the lizard brain is at work. Quoting a Bre Pettis blog post on the \\"cult of done.\\"  You ship by not doing things that want to distract you. Take a news vacation. Take an Internet diet.  Shenpa - Tibetan for scratching the itch. Avoid checking your email - learn to live with the itch and don't scratch it.    The Powerful Culture of Gifts: Gifts make you indispensable. Give gifts without any expectation of a payback.   Gifts signal to the world that you have plenty more to spare.  Gifts make a tribe.  There is no map: Prajna: a life without attachment and stress. Don't take it personally - don't try to teach fire a lesson when it burns you.  Learn to navigate disruptions and inconveniences in stride. Don't get attached to outcomes. \\"Lab assistants do what they're told. Scientists figure out what to do next.\\" \\"Art is an act of navigating without a map.\\"    Making the Choice: Burn your copy of Candyland. Don't teach your children or employees to be map readers and rule followers.  \\"More cowbell.\\" A bigger badge isn't going to help you get things done. Don't wait to be given authority. Make it happen with what you have now.  Fill in the following sentence: \\"I could be more creative if only...\\"  The Culture of Connection:  Give genuine gifts.     The Seven Abilities of the Linchpin:   1) Providing a unique interface between members of the organization  2) Delivering unique creativity  3) managing a situation or organization of great complexity  4) Leading customers  5) Inspiring staff  6) Providing deep domain knowledge  7) Possessing a unique talent  \\"We can't profitably get more average\\"    Suggested reading:  On Gifts and Art:  The War of Art by Steven Pressfield  The Gift, by Lewis Hyde  The Gift, by Marcel Mauss  Art is Work, by Milton Glaser  Man on Wire, by Philippe Petit  True and False, by David Mamet    On Sociology and Economics  The Lonely Crowd, by David Riesman, with Nathan Glazer and Reuel Denney  From the American System to Mass Production, 1800-1932, by David Hounshell  The Power Elite, by C.

The compliant masses don't help so much when you don't know what to do next.    Artists are people with a genius for finding a new answer, a new connection, or a new way of getting things done.    There are no longer any great jobs where someone tells you precisely what to do.    It's easy to buy a cookbook (filled with instructions to follow), but really hard to find a chef book.    The Hierarchy of Value: Lift / Hunt / Grow / Produce / Sell / Connect / Create and invent    The only way to get what you're worth is to stand out, to exert emotional labor, to be seen as indispensable, and to produce interactions that organizations and people care deeply about.    If you want a job where it's okay to follow the rules, don't be surprised if you get a job where following the rules is all you get to do.    Take a risk that you might make someone upset with your initiative, innovation, and insight - it turns out that you'll probably delight them instead.    Would your career advance if you could figure out a way to do an even better job of following your boss's instructions?    We train the factory workers of tomorrow. Our graduates are very good at following instructions. And we teach the power of consumption as an aid for social approval.    It's almost impossible to imagine a school with a sign that said:     \\"We teach people to take initiative and become remarkable artists, to question the status quo, and to interact with transparency. And our graduates understand that consumption is not the answer to social problems.\\"  Being good at school is a fine skill if you intend to do school forever. For the rest of us, being good at school is a little like being good at Frisbee.  It's nice, but it's not relevant unless your career involves homework assignments, looking through textbooks for answers that are already known to your supervisors, complying with instructions and then, in high-pressure settings, regurgitating those facts with limited processing on your part.\\"    What they should teach in school: 1. Solve interesting problems. 2. Lead.     Your job is a platform for generosity, for expression, for art.    If you don't have more than a resume, you've been brainwashed into compliance.    Art is anything that's creative, passionate, and personal.    Art is a personal act of courage, something one human does that creates change in another.    Art is the product of emotional labor. If it's easy and risk-free, it's unlikely that it's art.    Art is any original idea that can be a gift.    The greatest shortage in our society is an instinct to produce.    Artists think along the edges of the box, because that's where things get done.    It's not an accident that successful people read more books.    It's interesting to say it out loud, `I'm doing this because of the resistance.'  When you say it out loud, the lizard brain retreats in shame.    Giving a gift makes you indispensable.    `Teamwork' is the word bosses and coaches and teachers use when they actually mean, \\"Do as I say.'  Gifts not only satisfy our needs as artists, they also signal to the world that we have plenty more to share.    An artist is someone who uses bravery, insight, creativity, and boldness to challenge the status quo.  The difference between \\"If\\" and \\"And\\"
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I bought this several months ago and am VERY happy with the purchase. I paid more than the price of $100, but it was well worth it. The carrying case is nice.<br />PS ... you don't have to be female to enjoy this series.
B002AWJEU8|5.0|I saw Steve & co. in one of the best live shows I've ever seen on this tour in New Jersey, so imagine my delight when I heard that he was putting out a DVD/bluray from the same tour! Suffice it to say, I was not disappointed. In fact, frankly, I was thoroughly blown away.    Chances are, you're familiar with Mr Vai's unhuman chops. I must say that the band he chose for this tour was, by all accounts, very much up to the challenge of playing with a musician of this magnitude. The violinists on this show were amazing and truly added another dimension to Steve's already beautiful and multi-layered music. All the musicians here played together with such harmony that you'd swear they'd been doing it for years. (Some of them have) Also appreciated was the fact that everyone was given their moment to shine. The duet between Alex DePue and the absolutely STUNNING Ann Marie Calhoun left me in awe, wanting to go buy a violin. But not only were the chops all-around fantastic, but more importantly, you could tell that every member was really enjoying themselves, having the time of their lives, and putting their heart and soul into every note played.    As far as the direction of the video, I pretty much considered it flawless. People who buy a Steve Vai video buy it to watch him play guitar. And with Where the Wild Things Are, you won't miss a note. The cameras always knew where to be, which on occasion was focused very closely on Mr. Vai's hands during very difficult passages. Now I know it was filmed in 720p rather than 1080p like some have complained, but I will say that on my 36\\" 720p television, it was rather spaklingly good quality.    In short, if you love complex music, amazing musicianship, and just a flat-out mind-blowingly good show, BUY THIS DVD (or bluray or whatever) By the end you will be so in awe of what you just watched, you'll need to watch it again and again.
B00000721J|5.0|As a home-recording junkie myself, I LOVE this album for it's intimate look at what a great songwriter (one of the greatest) does when he's noodling around at home with just some basic recording equipment to work with.  The brilliant and the mundane reside perfectly together in this album of musical Polaroid snapshots.  You can hear the songs where he laid down a simple drum track first and then jammed on top of it, come-what-may, and others which were crafted carefully from the beginning.  As others have noted, the love shown here for his wife Linda permeates the whole thing.  That this love lasted until her untimely death is well worthy of reflection and admiration.<br /><br />I can easily see how folks who aren't recording geeks themselves might be turned off at the frivolity and lack of polish in parts of this album.  Not everyone who loves Picasso is going to be interested in a glance at his sketchbook.<br /><br />And yet...I look at the reviews here and see that many people were touched deeply by this album who clearly are looking at it purely from a listener's perspective.  Was there a bit of genius in the making of this album?  Yes!  A bit of audacity?  Yes again!<br /><br />This is Paul, after all.  ;)  Enjoy!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What is it about this series that so enchanting, engrossing, fun and immensely entertaining?  Everything!  The no name actors are brilliant in their performances.  The direction inspired.  The action builds up like a hot date and at the end of each episode you feel like smoking a cigarette.  What's not to love about this series!  Like a hot date, the memories leave you warm and fuzzy ... and wishing for more ... far more!!!
B0021L8V1G|4.0|Taking place six months after the first Iron Man, Iron Man 2 finds a world where Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) has successfully \\"privatized world peace,\\" but fearing other countries getting their hands on Stark's Iron Man technology the Senate seeks to have Tony hand over the technology to the government. Also seeking to steal Stark's technology is Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) who wants to regain a weapons contract with the military. Complicating things further, a mysterious Russian physicist named Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) turns up to destroy Tony Stark.     Iron Man was a huge surprise when it came out in the early summer of 2008. A 2nd tier Marvel comic book, Iron Man became one of the top grossing movies of 2008, and even held it's own very well against the juggernaut that was The Dark Knight despite it's much smaller fanbase. It also resurrected Robert Downey Jr.'s career, showing that he was capable of leading a franchise despite his past mistakes, and showed that Jon Favreau was a viable action director. Since then Downey has found himself nominated for two Golden Globes winning one of them, and added yet another big action franchise to the current notch in his belt. Of course, all eyes are on Iron Man 2 to see if the movie will top it's predecessor in the expectations department, so how does it hold up.     In my opinion, Iron Man 2 equals it's predecessor. The second installment of Iron Man is funnier than the original, and it ups the ante on the action from the first movie as well. What really makes the movie though, is not the action, but the characterizations. Fleshing out Stark's narcissism as well as his inabilities to deal with his emotions opens new doors into the character. Favreau and new writer to the series Justin Theroux (Tropic Thunderdo a great job of handling a large cast that would normally sink most other comic book franchises.     The casting in this movie is superb even if it seems jarring to see so many actors and actresses playing characters that aren't typical for them. Apart from The Spirit and The Island, Scarlett Johansson hasn't played an outright action fueled character, but she equips herself admirably to play the part of a believable martial arts trained heroine. Don Cheadle does a great job taking over the role of Rhodey from Terrence Howard, and even tops his predecessor. Sam Rockwell does a superb job as Stark's rival, and a man who tries his hardest to be as iconic as Tony Stark, but fails miserably on all counts. Mickey Rourke steals nearly every scene he's in, though, as Russian physicist Ivan Vanko. I was never sure if I would be able to buy him as a Russian, but the work he put into researching for the character definitely paid off.    On the downside though, sometimes it feels as though there's too much of a rush to get from one point to the next. Scenes feel as though they move to the next before they're truly done playing out. Unfortunately, this is one of the issues of having such a large cast that needs to have proper screen time to flesh out the characters. To add to that, the second half of the film is a bit derivative of other action films. While the film may do a great job of going in a different direction than other comic book films by outing it's central character and performing a character study on a man who thrives on his popularity in that position, but in the last act of the movie it falls into the same trap as other action movies with an ending that can be cliché.    All in all, I highly recommend this movie, especially if you like movies based on comic books and if you like the first Iron Man. Franchises like Iron Man, the current Batman series, and Kick-Ass set a new benchmark for comic book movies and action movies in general. With great action, acting, characterization, and originality these movies have moved beyond their genres to capture something that extends beyond it's core audience.    4.5/5
0452289963|5.0|The most profound wisdom eminates from these writings.  This book has literally changed my life for the better.  Eckhart Tolle has a way of cutting through to the raw essence of humanity.  Anyone who gives this book a poor review just doesn't \\"get\\" it yet and it isn't the right time for him or her.  If you are becoming aware of yourself and seeing your behavior from another perspective (the you outside you), get this book, read it again and again!
B00006AW2M|5.0|I doubt that there would be 54 previous 5-star reviews for this album if, as so many have maintained, it really was the worst one made by the Rolling Stones. And my review makes the number 55. I think TSMR remains one of the most interesting albums in the Stones discography. Lord knows what they thought they were attempting when they made it, but who cares? It's as engaging a piece of psychedelia as any that came out in the 60s and is rivaled only by the first Pink Floyd album for being one of the more sinister tripped-out albums ever produced. There is an edge to everything on this disc, whether it's the reverbed-laden guitar of \\"Citadel,\\" the deadpan ersatz raga of \\"Gomper,\\" the free-form antics of \\"Sing This All Together (See What Happens)\\" or the cold wastes of \\"2000 Light Years From Home.\\" Even something as pretty as \\"She's A Rainbow\\" has a scrawl of chaos writ large across it towards the end. Some have maintained that it was the Stones' answer to SGT. PEPPER, but I don't believe it for a minute. It's more like an acid trip that has exhilerating highs and devestating lows to it, and it's fascinating no matter how many times I play it.
B003C5FMEE|5.0|just got back from Jazz Fest and is a sea of fabulous music, trombone shorty towered over most. cant say enough about this guy, this band and this cd. the arranging, the lyrics, the orchestration, the playing. just terrific    buy this cd, listen to him live
0691142165|5.0|Reinhart and Rogoff's \\"This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly\\" is a strong quantitative look at financial crises.  They define a financial crisis as an inflation crisis, currency crash, currency debasement, bursting of an asset bubble, banking crisis, external debt crisis, or a domestic debt crisis.  During their investigation they continually emphasize the role \\"This-Time-Is-Different Syndrome\\" plays in instigating a crisis.<br /><br />The authors examination of history is outstanding.  Nearly a 1/3rd of the book is data appendixes and throughout the chapters the authors continually use graphs and tables to illustrate their point.  The book provides ample empirical evidence for academics looking for a starting point for research.  At the same time their narrative is simple enough for laymen untrained in economics to understand.  When it comes to describing history it is hard to explain how the authors could have better fit 800 years of data into 300 pages.<br /><br />The major problem with \\"This Time is Different\\" is its almost complete lack of a theoretical economic explanation as to WHY crises occur.  The authors go as far as saying that people's behavior change with time but they do not explain why in any great detail.  Whenever questions of theory are presented the authors generally leave the reader with further (unanswered) questions or short remarks (like with their examination of the Brady Plan).<br /><br />In Kindleberger's \\"Manias, Panics, and Crashes\\" he uses Hyman Minsky's 'Financial Instability Hypothesis' to explain why financial crises occur in a mature capitalist economy.

0385486804|5.0|Into the wild is an non-fiction novel by Jon Krakauer about adventures of Christopher MacCandless. Into the Wild is about Chris grew in a pretty wealthy family. He dissatisfied with his parents who always wants to divorce. He also has many complains about the society. He is tired with it. He chooses to live on his own without telling his family where is he going. Finally, he got his destination-Alaska.. On his way to Alaska, he goes to many different states. He meets many new friends. He leans how to survive on his own. Actually many friends tells him that his parents is really worry about him. But Chris's obstinate personality makes his journey appears many difficulties, some of them even very dangerous to death. He insists his ambition, and continues his journey.    Christopher McCandless leaves his family in 1990. He changes his name which symbolizes his new life. He tried to find \\"lost Christopher.\\" On 1992 August, people find his dead body. Even though his death is an accident, this what he chose for his life-to leave his family and go to Alaska on his own.     One interesting part about this book is that the author leaves many parts for us to think about what happen to Christopher. He talks many things about Christopher's past but he didn't mentioned too much about the investigation. I think this is one of the point that make this book interesting. At least it makes me think about what happen to Chris. And maybe his past will related to his death. If the author simply just tell everything about what happen to Chris. I don't think this book will be fun to read. Krakauer uses Magical Bus, Chris's death as the beginning of the book. From that, it starts talking about his past. At first, I got kind of confusing because the order doesn't seem right which it talks about Chris's death first. But this made want to keep on my reading and see what happen to Chris.    There are several themes about this book. First, you are the one who control your life. You are the onewho pick a road to go further your life. Sometimes if you pick a wrong road. You may not be able to go back or even it can be the end of the road. In this book, Chris is a great example. Chris is a very smart teen. He does really good in school. He is a fast learner. He actually has this ability to have a great future. He could find a great job and earn a lot of money. But he didn't choose that. He rather be very hard. Go through all these adventures. Finally, he wants to go home, but he couldn't. he figures out no matter how smart he is or how much knowledge he has, he couldn't deal with the nature. Finally he died from hunger. One touching part is that at the end he called \\" Mom! Mom! Help me\\". He noticed that how mush he misses his family. No matter what he wants to achieve, nothing as important as family. For Chris, this is a very meaningful experience.  For us, we may think this is a stupid decision. That's what I think when I read this book. But after reading this book, I think I learned more about Chris's character. I thought Krakauer  was right in the caused of Chris's death. It touched me by his plight regardless of his foolish adventure and the final scenes involving Chris's family were emotionally destructive.  Second theme is that the relationship between father and mother can affect their children. In the Book, Chris is tired with his parents who always want to divorce. Chris is really sick with it. So this is one if the reason that he leave the family. Also, communication between children and parents is very important. Chris never really tells his parents what he wants and parents don't talk to Chris too much. And now when Chris's die, everything is too late. If they had good communication. I believe their relationship would go so much better. Chris might not leave the house and go to Alaska and finally he wouldn't die. Last theme is we shouldn't only think of ourselves. We should also think of people around us. Chris leaves his family without any notice. Do you think it is fair to his family?    I highly recommend this book to everyone because this book the author has a very interesting writing method and make this book fun to read. It also makes us to think about what happen to Chris instead of telling you what happen right away. That's how it makes me want to keep on reading it to find out the truth. It also has many great morals. Our life can be really long or short; no one would know how long are we will live. But our life is full of adventure and inestimable significance. As Chris said \\"If we admit human life to be ruled by reason, the possibility of life will be destroyed.\\" I totally agree with this quote! This is only way that we can live happily.

0307454541|5.0|I rarely read fiction.  I generally do not like fiction.  I don't know why I picked this book up at Walmart; cover, yellow design, what-ever. About 5 days later and 600 pages into it, I saw that I was absolutly hooked on this trilogy.  The character development is amazing.  I cannot remember sitting and yelling at a book as I have this series.  I do not want to get ahead of myself, but on a scale of 1-10, this book is a 20 and the second book in the series is a 50.  Need I say more?  Lisbeth Salender is a great character for all time.  Cunning, smart, interesting, all of the adjectives can be used on her.  As I said earlier, I feel like I am in a dark theatre watching a B rate horror flick and the group behind me is yelling to the screen, \\"Watch out girl, watch out behind the door!\\"  You have been there, this Lisbeth character engenders a desire to protect her, she is innocent yet unbeleivably crafty at living in todays society.  You will root for her and her supporting cast of characters.  I have ordered the third book of this millenium series and my only regret is, no more Lisbeth after another 6-700 pages.  What am I going to do?  Seriously folks, this is a great read.  I had never paid attention to crime novels.  To think I would express any interest in a swedish crime novel is incomprehenible.  Funny though how you just have to give things a chance. Go out and read this book, it is worth it.

B000002B7O|5.0|I love Ozzy, even though he is a Madman. I mean, you'd literally have to be a madman to change the bass guitar and drum tracks on two of the most epic-sounding albums ever recorded in the history of the world, wouldn't you? That's what Ozzy did (Well, he and Sharon). It's a sad, sad part of the legacy to one of the greatest singers in Rock and Roll history. So, Diary of a Madman sounds like a fitting title now more than ever. - UPDATE: I just read that they will be re-releasing Diary of a Madman with the original bass and drum tracks added back to the mix the way they originally were recorded for the 30th anniversary editions of the album.<br /><br />As fate would have it, I luckily own the 1995 remastered issue of this great album which features all the songs exactly as they were originally recorded and intended to be enjoyed forever more, until Mr. and Mrs. Madman had it changed.<br /><br />Anyway, don't let the corny album cover image fool you, Diary of a Madman is one of those kinds of albums that you listen to and it amazes you with it's sheer epic greatness. This album is an absolute musical work of art and really belongs at the forefront as one of the best albums of all time ever.<br /><br />If you are a big fan of the Ozzy era Black Sabbath albums like I am, you probably thought that nothing Ozzy would do afterwards could ever come close to the great things that they did together on those albums. Well, you'd be wrong as Diary is just as good as anything Ozzy era Black Sabbath did, at least in my opinion. And believe me, thats saying a lot.<br /><br />While Ozzy's first solo album, Blizzard of Ozz is a very, very good album, Diary of a Madman just takes all that sonic goodness and goes an extra thousand miles more into the stratosphere with a powerhouse-packed recording that excels it in every way. Every song on here is awesome, especially You Can't Kill Rock and Roll, Flying High Again, Over The Mountain, S.A.T.O., Tonight...Oh Hell, they're all great tracks!<br /><br />The musical lineup of Ozzy Osbourne, Randy Rhoads, Bob Daisley, and Lee Kerslake are like a match made in Rock N' Roll Heaven and combined together they made a musical masterpiece with this album and I highly recommend getting the original 1995 reissue version if you want to hear it the way it should be listened to.<br /><br />Everyone knows and praises the excellent Randy Rhoads for his contributions to this album, as well they should, his guitar playing is truly phenomenal on this album, but really, the whole team delivered musical magic on Diary of a Madman. It really is an amazing piece of work and I can't say enough good things about it. If you don't already own it, what the heck are you waiting for? Get it NOW and let it rock you like a madman!<br /><br />Standout Tracks are: All of Them!Osbourne, Randy Rhoads, Bob Daisley, and Lee Kerslake are like a match made in Rock N' Roll Heaven and combined together they made a musical masterpiece with this album and I highly recommend getting the original 1995 reissue version if you want to hear it the way it should be listened to.

0345349571|5.0|There was a time when I liked to read virtually anything by the self-made historian Barbara Tuchman. That was back in my very early left-liberal days when I was much enamored of the Kennedy boys and it had been reported that at some point during the Cuban missile crisis (for the younger set, look that up on \\"Wikipedia\\", or some other ancient source) that Jack Kennedy had read her \\"Guns Of August\\". The import of that reading by him was that he, supposedly, thought through her contention that the subject matter of that book, the struggle of the various bourgeois governments of Europe to play \\"chicken\\" and win before World War I, got out of hand well before the issues could have been resolved short of war. In short, that world war was entirely avoidable had cooler heads prevailed. Well, I have long given up my left-liberal past and with it a move away from a dependence on the top governmental view of social change. I have also moved away from Tuchman's premise that merely by acting rationally bourgeois governmental leaders could, and can, solve any problem that confronts them. Still, I like to, on occasion, read her books because, whatever our political differences, I know that she will mass a great deal of useful information about her subject.    That is certainly the case here with her monumental overview of the 14th century in Western Europe, as seen through the prism of one of the premier noble families of France. A family that was central to much of the political, social, economic and religious action of the century, the Coucy family. Moreover, as her title indicates, she has a thesis here as well- that the calamitous 14th century has some important lessons to tell a late 20th century audience about how to save itself before it is too late. While, as I mentioned above, Tuchman is always a good source for interesting historical data and it s always good to \\"learn\\" the lessons of history these lessons seem to be directed, once again, toward bourgeois governmental leaders. I would draw rather different conclusions and look to a different section of the population to impart that information.    Well, why pick on the 14th century? For this reviewer, who has mentioned in the past that in his old age he wanted to sit back and study the role of religion in the development of Western capitalist society, especially those early protestant movements, this is an important period where the grip of the Roman Catholic Church and its far-flung bureaucracies were being challenged on many fronts by secular forces (and defended by other such forces). For Tuchman it is one of those decisive turning points in history where such concepts as the rule of law, the notion of a rational elite (as exemplified by the Coucys), the beginning of the flourishing of cities and the emergence of the bourgeois element that would drive (and still drives) Western society, and in the process create nation-states out of the patchwork of duchies, archbishopric sees, counties, and all lesser forms of governance. In short, the outline for modern society that the modern reader can recognize, for good or ill.    If you are looking to delve into the seemingly never-ending fights between various nobilities, mainly in England and France, a bewildering array of very unstable alliances, the `skinny' behind the two Pope (Avignon and Rome) struggle in the Catholic Church that ran riot throughout the later part of the century, or the absurdly complicated manner of solving conflict through an occasional war then this is your first stop. If you are also looking to get a glimpse at the culture, mainly high Church and chivalrous noble culture, the way the various local nobilities lived and intermarried (another cause for bewilderment, if you are not careful), the way wars were fought and who fought them and the place of such phenomena as plagues, pilgrimages, the late Crusades, and such this is also a place to stop. If you want to know everything about the several generations of Coucys, you will get that as well. And all these fairly fluently-written six hundred plus page are done so with the needs of an interested, but nor knowledgeable, layperson in mind. And with some very interesting illustrations, as well.
B0002XMF5I|5.0|The only complaint I have had all these years is that the album seems short.  It only has seven real songs plus two spooky soundng instrumentals that take up space that should have been dedicated to at least one more complete song.      Musically, it is my favorite of all my Sabbath CDs and I have lots of them.  I would love it if Ian Gillan got together with the other Sabs to make another album.  Maybe the could call it Reborn since the Black Sabbath moniker is now exclusively an Ozzy gig.    I got this CD when I was sixteen back at the start of 1984.  MTV had put the video for Trashed on heavy rotation so I just had to get it.  I did not know who this screamer Ian Gillan was back then but his vocals really kicked butt.  Heck, Born Again made me a Deep Purple fan.      My favorite songs on Born Again are the title track and Keep it Warm.  They have a real personal feel to them that does not go away once it creeps in you.   They are not full-tempo rockers as are Trashed, Digital Bitch and Hot Line, which are really good songs on their own, but they still rock - sort of like AC/DC's Ride On.  The album has two other complete songs called Zero the Hero and Disturbing the Priest that are bit quirky - musically, lyrically and in terms of vocals.  Gillan must have had fun singing those songs live.  Together the album is quite eclectic but still a total hard rock and metal trip - totally Sabbath.    I recommend it to any fan of good music.
B002N4DYZO|2.0|Don't bother with this version if you can absolutely help it - get Karajan's with Dernesch and Vickers. It's SO much better. At least listen to and compare both versions before you decide. That's what I did, and they're like night and day. Even if this had the superior sound quality and mixing (which it certainly doesn't) it would still be inferior for its lack of interpretive depth. Unless you want Beethoven to sound Baroque, avoid this version.
0307346609|1.0|I love zombie movies, zombie books, if it has a zombie I like it.  A book must tell a story and World War Z is a weak attempt at story telling.  Sorry, I know lots of people would disagree but that is my opinion.  I hated all the subtle politically correct bull crap.  Cuba, Pinochet, the author writes his characters dialog as though he understands politics at the \\"street\\" level or something.  But Max can't hide his politically correct indoctrination learned in some U.S. University where kids graduate so much smarter than those who've lived it.  I've lived in Cuba and Santiago, LloLleo, Cartagena, Chile.  I know more than most about Pinochet and Max needs to live a little more on the street to seem even a little more convincing. That's just my opinion.  Sorry Max.  I loved the idea of the book.  I bought it, I couldn't finish it because it was way too lame.  Better luck when you're older and know what you're writing about.  The good news for you is simply this - you're laughing all the way to the bank.  So good job.  That is brought to you by the horrible American system your professers disdain.

B001GCUO5W|1.0|This isn't a very good movie in my opinion.  It doesn't go anywhere and after awhile you figured out whats going on and once that is done, then all you doing is watching the movie to see if you were right.  I am hugely disappointed because I like Leo's movies and Martin Scorsece's movies and yet this didn't work at all.  The movie is just moody and what I mean about that is that I think it tries to hard to be some type of film noir.  DiCarpio's performance will drive you nuts, the dialog, the accents are just bad.  Mark Ruffalo doesn't seem to have anything to do and it reminds me a lof of Eyes Wide Shut.  In fact I call it Scorsece's Eyes Wide Shut.  Now I am not telling you not to see it, but this is a rental only.  You sit through the whole thing and when it's over you will say to yourself, \\"What in the world did I just watched!\\"  I said it, my date said it and the rest of the people coming out of the theater said it.  Everyone and I do mean, EVERYONE I know, was disappointed in this movie and we all really really wanted to like it.  Some people say you have to have an open mind and that it is more deep.  But when you peel back the layers, you have nothing.  The previews make you think its a supernatural thriller... just skip it.  I would wait for it to come on one of the paid channels (HBO, Showtime, etc), but if you think you really have to see it, then rent it.  It's not worth it on blu-ray and its not worth it on standard DVD.

B001C4CI8U|5.0|If you've enjoyed J.J. Abrams' other work like \\"Alias\\" [[ASIN:B000H5V8DG Alias - The Complete Collection (Seasons 1-5 + Rambaldi artifact box)]] and \\"Lost\\" [[ASIN:B0019LY5IM Lost: The Complete Fifth Season]] then you'll also enjoy \\"Fringe\\".  It features a strong female lead in Anna Torv as FBI agent Olivia Dunham, but the overall plot is not as complicated to follow week to week as \\"Lost,\\" even though there are hints to an more over-arching story web.  Not surprising from the title, \\"Fringe\\" is largely sci-fi with a substantial amount of the story focusing on FBI investigations into bizarre and unexplained events known as \\"The Pattern.\\"  The FBI has brought in Dr. Walter Bishop, a slightly insane genius, to aid in their investigation as well as his son, Peter Bishop, who helps translate Walter's science babble into layman's terms.  Much of the plot is also character-driven, and I especially love the interactions between Walter, Peter, and Olivia.  John Noble, who plays Walter, nearly steals the show every episode!
B000059H98|5.0|This movie has stayed stuck in my mind since the first time i saw it over ten years ago. And this DVD brings back all the memories. Lori Petty is, i'm convinced, the ONLY person who could've played the role of the title character. this movie is pure greatness. even the low budget wallaby-kangaroo-dog-human hybrids are fun to watch. to appreciate this movie you have to appreciate the budget and constraints they most likely had to work with. this movie was never going to be a wide spread success but lives on in classic B movie status as my 2nd favorite movie of all time, behind only the almighty Army Of Darkness. the movie is as quotable and memorable as AoD and should be appreciated as such. if you want originality mixed with comedy and a bit of action, this movie is for you. don't pass up the chance to see greatness and Lori Petty at her best, and hottest (in my opinion)!

B000000OU4|5.0|As someone who has been in love the the musical gifts of Pat Metheny since I first heard in more than 30 years ago on an \\"All Things Considered\\" segment featuring a new artist playing songs from the New Chautauqua album, its amazing the utter joy and rhapsody that comes from listening to his music. Its funny reading a lot of the comments which bemoan the supposed \\"commercial\\" aspects of this album. In a funny kind of way it reminds me of sentiments that I read from people of Classical genre when they speak of Jazz. It is certainly one's right to like what one likes, but to state that Jazz, a music which is based on the foundation of open expression, does not follow a certain prescription is the height of irony. No matter, when you listen to The End Of The World, you realize that if you had to have a one final song to listen to if it really was the end of the world, this just might be it. The End Of The World takes you on a melodic, harmonic, and emotional journey that culminates with the sound of thunder that still awakens me from a dream like state brought on by the fierce urgency of Pat's euphoric, metaphoric,  and soul stirring solo. The emotional embrace of \\"Something To Remind You\\" is breathtaking, and the apocalyptic vocals of \\"Red Sky\\" bespeak of another place and time. Sure the words I use may appear gaudy, but they fail to do justice to the music that the PMG has created. I listen to everything, classical, blues, r&b, folk, ragtime, free jazz, and everything in between. This album goes on the \\"If I had to have 10 CDs on a Desert Island List\\" I love the compliment one poster wrote, raw though it may be. He said \\"Ignore album and die ignorant\\". Well no truer statement has ever been made. This is the music you listen to and realize that must be a God, or some higher power to create something so beautiful. And as the title indicates, if God made any better music, he must have kept it for Him/Her Self.

B00169N0BK|3.0|Okay.  Not sure why Amazon doesn't show the rather lengthy review I wrote for this .  Very frustrating.  So, I will summarize what I said.<br /><br />I want to love this product.  But so far, I can't.  I calibrated my MacBook Pro 15\\" running Snow Leopard, and was pleased with how the \\"color\\" looked.  But then I opened up a file I'd worked on previously in Photoshop.  No, I'm not saying I'm upset the colors seemed off.  I expected that given I created the original file before calibrating.  What I found to be horrid was the degree of banding I had in grandient to black areas.  Before, using the Apple default profile for the screen, the blacks smoothly transitioned to the lighter area.<br /><br />At first, I thought, well, the Apple profile must have been wrong.  But then I realized... wait... NO!  I can SEE the difference, so I know the monitor is capable of it.  So, I opened the profile up in ColorSync, and displayed the visual 3D graph of the gamut.  I compared to Apple's.... sure enough, Colormunki's profile chopped off a HUGE portion of the range that the Apple profile lets me see (i.e. the monitor can do it, but Colormunki failed to measure/detect it correctly).<br /><br />So, in order to test, I installed it on my work laptop (a slightly older 17\\" MacBook Pro, running Leopard... and yes, I removed the software after testing, to try and stay compliant with the licensing).  The laptop LCD calibration also had a profile that was similarly chopped off (not quite as bad though).  So, I calibrated the 20\\" Cinema Display.  The Colormunki profile almost exactly matched Apple's!!!<br /><br />Okay... so... maybe it's that the laptop LCD's both have glossy displays?  I opened a support ticket with X-Rite, and over 24 hours later am STILL waiting to hear SOME sort of response beyond the automated email reply.<br /><br />So, I decided to test more.  Last night, I took my work Cinema Display home and calibrated it while connected to my personal laptop.  I expected it to have a matching display profile like I had at work.  Nope!  It chopped off the color space for the Cinema Display in a similar manner that it did my personal LCD.  Very weird!  I wasn't expecting that.  Same screen, two computers... both similar hardware for laptops, only varying in version of the OS (Leopard vs. Snow Leopard).<br /><br />Okay... so... maybe it's the lighting at my home.  I took my personal laptop to work (and the Cinema display back), and recalibrated.  Same results as at home!!!  So, to preserve sanity and make sure something's not wrong, I recalibrated the same cinema display with my work laptop, with the monitor in the same position, same lighting, etc... that profile was accurate!<br /><br />So, it's either something about the hardware of the laptop, or the version difference in the operating system, I think.  What's odd still, is that I would have expected my work laptop to match Apple's profile much more than it does if it was just hardware/OS.<br /><br />THEN, there's the printer calibration.  It's a little more difficult to test this one.  I guess I could bring test chart prints to work to test using my work laptop, or take my work laptop home and test.  But what I had when I printed a baby photo was aweful.  The default profile from KODAK (just using a 5100 AiO at home) matched skin tones VERY well.  The hair was more black/gray than the screen, but given the cyan of the printer profile typically punches out past the gamut of the screen (especially my laptop LCD), I sort of expected a bit more cyan in the picture, that I knew I wasn't seeing on my display.  But when I printed the exact picture using the Colormunki profile, the hair was much more orange/red, and the skin tones were PINK!  And not cute baby pink... more like little piglet pink!<br /><br />I am awaiting their support to reply.  Not having a response after well over 24 hours doesn't convey good support to me.  If I don't hear from them tomorrow, I will be calling their support lineto be a little more insistent on getting my technical support.
0061537969|4.0|I will be honest...this isn't the perfect book, however it is pretty good.  The story line was quite captivating, holding me until I finished the book in 3 sittings...2 days...and the quickest book I recall ever reading.      Just a casual observation:  I find the author quite interesting in that his name is Garth Stein.  He has similar facial features as Garth Brooks, and his writing cadence, to me, is similar to John Steinbeck in a book like Cannery Row.  I wouldn't compare him yet to Steinbeck, though, because Steinbeck is my hands down favorite.  But, this is a very good book.  I would consider reading other Stein works.

Won various prices in Holland; best new talent SNS-Reaal price(15.000 euro's)  Best serious talent(Dutch radio 3)  Best played song on radio 3: 2009 back it up(part of the album)  Also part of the album is a night like this; was number one on the dutch singles charts;(still in the top 10 after 18 weeks!) number one on dutch i-tunes(still in the top 5!) for 4 months.  It was used on the internet for a commercial bij Martini; a big success; being watched one and a half million times.!!  The album was released on 29 januari 2010 and immediately number one on the dutch album charts and still is after 14 weeks and has sold more than 100.000 copies which is quite a lot for Holland having a population of 16 million and the fact that everybody is downloading legally or otherwise.   The album is since its release also number one on the dutch i-tunes albumcharts and still is.  The music is inspired bij movies from the forties and fifties  with bigband music and with stars like Grace Kelly and Humprey Bogart.  Its mambo,dance,jazz,hiphop, pop and more!  The band consist of a bass-player; keyboardplayer; 2 saxaphoneplayers; 1 trumpetplayer; 1 guitarplayer; 1 dj, and of course the singer Caro Emerald.  Catchy  modern jazzpop; standout tracks: stuck; the other woman, that man;back it up; a night like this;  4,5 stars  Highly Recommended
B000002GKT|4.0|Humble Pie were one of the best legends of early heavy metal/hard rock. Some sources say as far as coining the term \\"heavy metal\\" it was first used to describe the bands 1968 debut album As Safe As Yesterday, others say it was Alice Cooper, but whatever the case, after Steve Marriot left the Small Faces, he created a forceful rocking band with then unknown guitar god Peter Frampton who was just a kid. Their first 3-4 albums were some of the best racket England was cooking up, of course whether you prefer those albums or not, most great hard rock bands of the 70's owned the stage, and this classic live album is no different. Aside from I Don't Need No Doctor which occasionally garners some FM airplay, most will be unfamilar with the tracks unless you know Pie.     The group chooses a cool varied selection of their own songs like I'm Ready and Four Day Creep along with one of their popular (albeit of the time) radio cuts Stone Cold Fever. A lurching cover of Walk On Guilded Splinters is also a major highlight although to some the lengthy song might be dated but the showmanship never wears thin. For the first year of the 70's these guys were on the throne of the heavy metal mantal alongside Zep, Sab, Purp, Alice, Mountain, Budgie, Sir Lord Baltimore, Grand Funk and so fourth. Sadly, Frampton left after this live album right when the band struck their biggest success with the Smokin' album. Still, even that couldn't approach Frampton's own upcoming live album that would be a mega smash and still is.    Time has been good to Pie, who are only a little dated and their live album still holds up as does their fine teeth kicking studio albums. The only weakness might be a weak remaster job and perhaps some bonus cuts to widen the running time because the CD versions still retain the original tracklisting of the LP that obviously cut a bit out of the concert for time restraints. Still, you cant go wrong. For soulful wailing vocals over a vicious guitar laden rock n roll sound, pick up Rockin The Fillmore and other Humble Pie albums.

The first few pages were a little slow, but after the first few chapters it pulls you in. you get lost into this make believe world suzanne has made and wont be able to put it down. i recommend this book for anyone! the only thing i will say about it, is if you get squimmish very easily over blood, then maybe you should take it slow with this book. Otherwise i would give this book an A+++. Theres romance, violence, life lessons, government, and much much more. There is a part for everyone in this book which is why i think i fell in love with it so much. If you are looking for a book that will be unforgetable i recommend this!
0393072231|5.0|First, I'll forego the obvious -- that all students should be made to read this book, and not just business majors, but all students who hope to obtain a diploma or certificate of any sort; that those who wish to cast a ballot in other than a local election should first be required to read this book; that all Tea Party members should have this book read to them. I'll also refrain from savoring the delicious shadenfreude the whole market collapse has brought at the expense of the Free-Market Pentecostalists, many of whom are yet in denial, and those who left snotty comments under my previous reviews here which expressed skepticism at books testifying to the perfection of the markets.<br /><br />Further, I won't make any jokes at how this book would serve as the perfect book for a 12-step group to be called Libertarians Anonymous.<br />(Hello. My name is Alan . . .)<br />(Hi, Alan!)<br />( . . . and I'm a recovering Objectivist.)<br /><br />Instead, I'll go much further and propose that this book should be included in all future editions of the Holy Bible -- perhaps inserted after Jude but before Revelation.<br /><br />And why not? Certainly this book tells the story of a cataclysm of Biblical proportions. It features a Jesus-like figure whose people turn against him, a voice crying in the wilderness; a Job who, after tribulations, was blessed in his later end more than his beginning; most of the characters depicted are of the Chosen (except for a few villainous Goyim); and this is the most profound story of retribution against the rich and powerful since the parted Red Sea closed, drowning the Pharaoh and his army. The words Lewis makes-up for Steve Eisman's big speech at the end just as Bear Stearns was collapsing are easily the equal of The Sermon on the Mount:<br />  \\"The upper classes of this country raped this country. . . . .<br />  You built a castle to rip people off.<br />  Not once have I come across a person inside a<br />  Wall Street firm who was having a crisis of conscience.<br />  Nobody ever said, 'This is wrong.' \\"<br /><br />True, this is the not the most detailed or accurate account of The Great Unraveling, but it is the most entertaining.

Steve Eisman is a character sort of like Harry Bosch in that he offends everyone . . . but gets justice.<br /><br />I'll leave it to others to judge how much of this book is accurate and how much came from Michael Lewis's fulminating imagination, but -- O My Masters!--  what writing!

B00297FEUS|5.0|Stay Hungry is a landmark album for Twisted Sister and possibly for metal generally. The band knew they had a monster on their hands before the release, but could not have predicted the positive effect that `those' MTV videos would have on the album's sales, the band's extreme profile and music videos generally. This was ground breaking stuff and aped almost immediately by other groups of that era.     And so to the music. First off, there are the two well known anthems of `I Wanna Rock' and `We're Not Going To Take It', both of which seemed pretty anti establishment at the time. Time has worn away the shock value, but the songs remain entertaining to this day - rowdy, bouncy and catchy. By contrast Captain Howdy and Burn In Hell are great dark horror movie style classics, the former bolstered by an urgent riff, whilst the latter speeds along on Pero's driving drumming, muted in power somewhat by the production style. The title track is a homage to Arnie and the film of the same name - it's a frenetic opener but loses some clout due to the aforementioned production style.     The overall production is now the stuff of infamy. But to my mind the straight forward, almost poppy, sound is a marked improvement over the garage grunge of the Epps produced predecessor, You Can't Stop Rock and Roll, which sounds lazy and sloppy in comparison. In hindsight they could have gone heavier (which they later did on the reworked Still Hungry) but it's arguable that part of the cds success is down to the accessibility afforded by the 80s pop production sound.     Of the rest, The Price is impassioned and a surprisingly emotional ballad, whilst closers The Beast and SMF are crunching, fist thumping, live favorites - not at all as commercial as the singles, but they do give the album the variety and heaviness.The new recording 30 is good also,should have been tagged onto disk 1 intead of being on disk 2 with out takes and demos.Should have been a special edtion with Still Hungry and Stay Hungry in same set.
1592332803|4.0|Most vegans fall into one of four broad classes: animal rights advocates, environmental advocates, organic/health food proponents and what one of my favorite authors (in [[ASIN:1569243581 Vegan with a Vengeance : Over 150 Delicious, Cheap, Animal-Free Recipes That Rock]]) describes as \\"middle aged Republicans with heart disease.\\"  One might conclude from the other reviews on Amazon.com that the target audience for this book is mostly the first and last. The prevalence of egg replacer (not an organic product nor part of a traditional macrobiotic diet) probably will turn off the middle two groups.  There is also a heavy dose of white flour and refined sugar which will turn off the organic/health food proponents.  That makes it sound like a book of comfort food for animal rights advocates and middle aged Republicans with heart disease.  But that view is unfair.<br /><br />The strength of the book is that the author has done a lot of work finding vegan versions of many comfort foods. and produced an almost encyclopedic book on vegan baking.  To be honest, it may be that some of these foods really need eggs or egg replacer. If you don't want to eat white flour and egg replacer, then maybe you should forgo Crepes Suzette.  There are a number of traditional recipes (e.g. the Scandinavian rice pudding, German Apple cake) that work very well along with mundane foods like cornbread.  I judge a cookbook on the recipes I like, not the foods I do not like and would not eat (I can not think of a cookbook from which I would eat half the foods if I saw them on a menu).  We have found more than enough recipes to savor in here to be worth recommending.<br /><br />I would note that the author's oven may run a bit cold.  I know mine runs a bit hot and I usually have to scale back to keep baked goods from drying out.  It seems that with this book I have to throttle back a bit more than average.  This should not be taken as a criticism of the book. Just start checking for doneness earlier rather than later (and watch the temperature).  By the way, the author does have a nice section on troubleshooting temperature and time to get the best results.<br /><br />I am using four stars to draw attention to the fact that it may not be for everyone (e.g., the religiously organic people on your gift list).

0307454541|1.0|*Spoiler Alert*<br /><br />I can't see how this was supposed to be a thriller.  As so many of the other 1-2 star reviewers said, most of it was a drawn out description of the research done by Lisbeth and Blomvist.  Or about their meal choices (mostly sandwiches).  I don't understand the motivations, or even most of the actions, of any of the characters or Blomvist's appeal for almost every woman in the book, including Lisbeth.  Someone please explain to me how she can be upset at the end of the book by seeing Blomvist and Erica on their way to bed together when she knew from the beginning that they've always been involved, even while in relationships with other people, and when one of the things she claims to like about him is that he doesn't try to change how SHE lives HER life.<br /><br />Some other reviewers have claimed that this is supposed to be a feminist book, and that Lisbeth is a feminist hero.  I can't disagree more.  Answering brutality done to you by a man with brutality of your own is not any kind of feminism or \\"equality\\" that I want to be a part of.

1400049628|4.0|So my husband saw this book ages ago and commented on it to me. Parody books really aren't my thing but I thought it was a clever idea. Eventually he bought it and read it, seeming to enjoy it pretty well. It certainly lead to some funny conversations about beefing up the home security. While planning to read zombie fiction for a theme-of-the-month I decided to toss this one in with it. I mean, why not figure out how to survive a zombie attack if I was going to be reading so much about them?<br /><br />For a book shelved under humor there's a terribly serious tone to this guide. The kind of serious tone that never falters making you almost go \\"hmmm, does this guy really believe this crap?\\". That is what makes it soooo good! This is the sort of well researched and thought out parody that I think most readers who are into zombies or have read a few too many survival guides can get behind. If I were heading out into the workplace every day I think this would be an excellent tome for watercooler chat fodder.<br /><br />What really surprised me though was that my ten-year-old picked it up to read. My kid hates reading. He is also terrified of only one thing in this world and that thing is zombies. When he was little all we had to do to get him to stay in his room when he was sent there for a time-out was to start up a nice zombie moaning noise, tip our heads sideways and shamble toward him. Thanks alot Mr. Brooks! Now I can't pull that one on him anymore because he no longer fears zombies thanks to everything he learned in this book. Of course, that does make it easier to watch some of our favorite movies in another room without him screaming to turn it off.<br /><br />All in all I think this is a terrific stocking stuffer for your favorite zombie fan or even a kinemortophobic tween.
B000EGF0NW|5.0|Sebold has received justifiable acclaim for The Lovely Bones. It is doubtful if she could have written that without having had this horrific experience and written this superb book.<br />She was raped as a college freshman at Syracuse, just before finals. This is the step-by-step story of that experience and its aftermath.<br />Sebold is a rarely gutsy woman. She identified her attacker and stayed with the court process until he was imprisoned at Attica. Very few women have the courage to go through this process, which is perhaps as horrific as the event. Her own roommate had the same experience and opted out of pursuing it.<br />Having done all that she had to take herself through her own recovery, through drug addiction and, how shall I say it, estrangement from normal sexual responses for a long time.<br />This is a relentlessly honest volume.<br />Not enough good things can come to Alice Sebold to make up for this experience, but one hopes that nothing but good things will.
B000SEKO4K|3.0|This ebook contains everything known to have been written by the great bard, and as such is worth having on your Kindle so you'll always have the great works of Shakespeare by your side.<br /><br />That said, however, I am rather disappointed with the formatting of the Kindle edition.  It completely lacks diacritical marks (accented characters) and proper justification of text, which makes it difficult if not impossible to glean the proper metrical structure of the lines.  For example, if a single line of verse is split across two speakers, then the typical convention is to have the second line pushed out to the right so that its left edge aligns with the previous line's right edge.  The editors of this text chose to follow this convention, and even illustrate it in the introduction, but in the actual plays the formatting is lost and it turns out that even in the introduction it was \\"faked\\" with an image.  Furthermore, line numbers are provided every 5th line, but they are simply tacked on to the end of each 5th line of text instead of being properly right or left justified, and it is extremely distracting to read these line numbers as part of the normal flow of text each fifth line, especially since the lines are formatted in the \\"ragged right\\" style.<br /><br />If you want to have all of Shakespeare's works on your Kindle, this is the best you'll find right now.  But due to the above formatting issues I cannot recommend it wholeheartedly.

0743289692|4.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali's story grabs you from the first pages of the book.  Dreams of abandoning a predestined future in favor of an education and career became a hard fought for actuality.  She was raised in a strict Moslem environment; Somalia, Saudi Arabia and Kenya.  Trying to make peace between her anger at her repression as a female and following the tenets of her religion was an internal battle that she describes well.  Running away to Holland to escape an arranged marriage of which she wanted no part, finally allowed her the freedom to blossom and become the person she is today.  This book is not only about a woman's liberation in the Western sense; it is the story of a woman courageous enough to fight the moral battles imposed on her by a restrictive upbringing.

1423113381|4.0|Summary: Carter and Sadie Kane have been raised apart since their mother's death, six years ago. Then, one fateful Christmas Eve, their father takes them to the British Museum to \\"make things right.\\" That's the beginning of the Kane children's adventure into an ancient story and their own past. They learn that not only are the Ancient Egyptian gods still in existence, but their family has been intertwined with them for centuries. Set, the worst of the gods, has hatched a diabolical plan which Carter, Sadie, and an assortment of gods and wizards must thwart.    What I thought: I loved this book!  It was really interesting to have the story from two points of view (Carter and Sadie).  The narration reminded me of [[ASIN:0590629778 Animorphs]] books, in that there are two beings in one mind, or [[ASIN:1569319804 Ayashi no ceres (Ceres: Celestial Legend)]] in which the main character is also having her being taken over by a goddess.    Like the [[ASIN:1423113497 Percy Jackson series]], the story was fast-paced and entertaining.  I found this book more entertaining, and I think that that's due to having two narrators to play off each other--and anyone who has a brother or sister two years older or younger will definitely be able to relate to the sibling squabbling in the book!  While many people have at least a little knowledge of Greek mythology, I feel like Egyptian mythology is not as popular and well-known, but I definitely want to learn more now.

I would recommend this book to anyone who is even considering Atkins.
B002T9H2ME|2.0|I found the movie to be a \\"cult\\" wanna-be production.  Predictable ending.  A little boring.
B0039SFKSW|5.0|In my early days as a journalist, I tried many different kinds of writing, including reviewing new record albums. The first one I did was the second album from what was then -- as now -- my favorite music group: Asia. The album was \\"Alpha,\\" the band's followup to its powerful self-titled debut.    Sadly, I lost my copy of that review long ago, but I remember much of it. I wrote about how I invited my sister to listen as I dropped the newly purchased vinyl LP onto my turntable. (Yeah, I know, I know...) Her comment as the opening track, \\"Don't Cry,\\" pounded through the speakers? \\"It's definitely Asia.\\"    Twenty-seven years later, the original members of Asia have offered up \\"Omega,\\" arguably the bookend to \\"Alpha.\\" And what a bookend! It's an impressive musical adventure that shows how the already excellent talents of John Wetton, Geoff Downes, Carl Palmer and Steve Howe have become even richer through the years.    Though \\"Alpha\\" had plenty of great music, it's generally considered a commercial disappointment. There was tremendous pressure on Asia to quickly recapture the success of the first album, which spent nine weeks atop the charts in 1982 with hits such as \\"Heat Of The Moment,\\" \\"Only Time Will Tell\\" and \\"Sole Survivor.\\" As if to put a fine point on their expectations, Asia's handlers dropped them into a frozen Canadian wasteland, thinking a remote studio locale--and lack of distraction--would stimulate their creativity. That Asia managed to put out an album at all, and one as good as \\"Alpha\\" managed to be, is a testimony to their incredible musical prowess.    \\"Omega,\\" on the other hand, comes at a time when the band--which, in its original lineup, broke up after \\"Alpha\\"--is experiencing an impressive renaissance. Reunited in 2006 and touring annually since, Asia produced a comeback CD, \\"Phoenix,\\" in 2008. \\"Phoenix\\" was a solid effort demonstrating the growth that each member had experienced over the years, even if it didn't shake up the music world the way\\"Asia\\" did in '82. (In this iPod era, what album possibly could?)    So \\"Omega\\" becomes something of a greater experiment: Was there more to tap from the Asia well? Could one of the best bands of the 1980s one-up their comeback, in a way \\"Alpha\\" failed to do?    In my view, the answer is a resounding \\"yes.\\" \\"Omega\\" impresses in every way that \\"Alpha\\" perhaps did not. While \\"Alpha\\" had good and not-so-good elements, every track on \\"Omega\\" pegs the 'Wow' needle. It's how one would expect a band with the great talents of Asia to sound a quarter-century hence, and even more so considering their pre-Asia pedigree (King Crimson, Yes, ELP, The Buggles). The music is richer and more diverse, the themes reflective of longer life and deeper life lessons. And, if this is possible, each member of the band simply sounds better than ever, whether in instrument or voice or both.    One hopes that, despite its name, \\"Omega\\" doesn't prove to be Asia's final musical offering. The depth and quality of this outstanding album says that there is much more wonderful music that Asia has to share--and all of us are the better for it.    In short: It's definitely Asia!
B000YAA68C|4.0|The best parts of this film were the scenes with Butler and Swank together -- both before his death and afterward via flashback.  Especially fresh was the scene when they first meet in Ireland (via flashback), and when Swank meets Butler's parents.  I would have liked to see the couple's relationship develop from the beginning, rather than using a contrived death and the business with the constant letters, which to me, got in the way of how these characters actually felt toward each other.  When one tells a story it is usually recommended as being more effective when one shows how, rather than tells how.....and the letters made it into a story that is told rather than one that is shown...the flashbacks SHOW how their romance began, and that is why they are so appealing and interesting.  Butler and Swank have plenty of star power, sex appeal, and certainly the acting chops for these roles.  The contrived letters took up so much time that I finished the film wishing it had had a more conventional plot.....if she had gone over to Ireland to see him before their marriage, meet his family, and so on, the actors had enough skill to make that fresh and new, but perhaps that has been done to death; at least they did not make the Irish look like yokels or buffoons; Gerry's parents seemed incredibly real, open, considerate, and sweet, and it would have been interesting to see Gerry with his parents, but we are not given that chance.  And Swank's delight in realizing that they did not hate her for \\"taking Gerry away from them\\" to live stateside was quite nice and refreshing.  None of the \\"Meet the Fokkers\\" stale stupidity in these scenes whatsoever.  Also the ending, where Swank and Bates arrive in Ireland was nifty.  Why did they not do more of that, develop that?  Instead we got the usual ditsy Lisa Kudrow (not my favorite) doing her usual innane thing -- who wants to watch Kudrow when you have Swank and Butler?  They only acted together for about 15 minutes at the beginningand end.  I just felt the plot was contrived to squeeze as many tears out of the audience as possible and I was hoping for more showing how their relationship developed.  Hope to see Butler in many more romantic comedies.  His comedic, romantic skills are SO appealing and his talents wasted in action flicks (300?  DOH!!  So ridiculous.)  I thought Swank was credible in a feminine lead, however, except in the flashback scene in Ireland at the end where they first meet, she seems mostly cranky in her scenes with Butler, which makes one wonder why his character would put up with her, since she seems to spend most of her time complaining and picking fights.  Why would such a happy-go-lucky guy like Gerry even stay with someone who constantly finds fault?  She was so sweet and open when they first met in Ireland, and willing to go along with the mad-dog story Gerry was giving her even though she knew the sheep dog was tame.....it would have been cute to go more with that lightness.  I would also have loved to see how her shoe designs grew out of her life with Gerry and her delight in him....  Kathy Bates was terrific; Harry Connick creepy -- a weird character who one minute was acting logically, and loaded with self-respect and a clear view of himself, and the next blurting innanities and acting depressed and self-defeating.  Why was his character even IN the film?  I cannot see how his character moved the plot forward at all.  Just some thoughts.

B0019N8P2W|5.0|I just got my copy. As I opened it, I noticed that there is a note on the inside of the set from series creator Glenn Eichler describing the wonders of this box. However, he also details its horror, and that is that \\"99% of the music has been changed, because the cost of licensing the many music bites we used would have made it impossible to release the collection (and for many years did).\\"    Now, if you're a die-hard Daria fan like myself, this will discourage and upset you, but will not keep you from owning and enjoying this wondrous box set. It looks great, it sounds great, and the extras are awesome. But it won't be exactly the way I remember it. It will be a new way to experience Daria. Maybe not the most authentic, but it's as close as we're going to get.

1401323820|4.0|This was a fun, quick read. Mystery novels are not my thing, but I adore the TV show \\"CASTLE\\" and this book reads exactly like a show episode. In fact, bits and pieces of scenes from the first season where playboy novelist Richard Castle is riding-along with Det. Kate Beckett make their way into the story. Castle's counterpart is Jameson Rook, a magazine journalist shadowing Det. Nikki Heat (based on Beckett) to get an on the job perspective for an article about NYPD homicide detectives. Captain Montgomery, Medical Examiner Lanie Parish, and Detectives Esposito and Ryan also have doppelgangers in the novel: Captain Montrose, M.E. Lauren Perry, Det. Ochoa, and Det. Raley, respectively.    If you saw Season 2's second episode of \\"CASTLE\\", then you also know that there is a sex scene in the novel between Rook and Nikki Heat, which does not occur between the TV series' characters. I love how they handled that aspect on the show -- very funny.    The murder mystery aspect itself is pretty good.  Probably not a mystery plot worthy of an A-list novel, but certainly well thought out with sufficient twists and turns to make the story interesting.  So, hard core mystery fans might not find this novel engaging enough, but this is definitely a more entertaining read for fans of the show and those not heavily into the genre.
B002VECM6S|5.0|My husband and I finally got around to watching \\"The Blind Side\\" tonight and I'm glad we did - this is truly a heartfelt and inspiring movie with not only a stellar performance by Sandra Bullock, who is truly deserving of her Oscar, but also incredible performances by the rest of the main cast. Based on the true experiences of Michael Oher (played by Quinton Aaron) and Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock), the story is credibly portrayed without sinking into over-the-top sappiness. This is partly helped by the matter-of-fact manner in which the story is told - there are no overly long melodramatic scenes, and all the crucial plot points move along at an adequate pace.<br /><br />The stand-out performance is definitely by Sandra Bullock who is perfectly cast as the plain-talking, at times acerbic, but always having her heart in the right place Leigh Anne Tuohy. Her compassionate nature shines through every action - an outpouring of love without any expectations whatsoever. Her family rallies around in supporting Leigh Anne's decision to embrace Michael as one of their own - and I particularly enjoyed the antics of Sean and Leigh Anne's young son who develops a close brotherly bond with Michael. The touching family scenes are nicely balanced with the football scenes, be it training (loved it when Leigh Anne takes matters into her own hands during a training session that is not going particularly well), or an actual game.<br /><br />My husband initially expressed some cynicism about this movie (prior to watching it) - he was concerned that the movie would be more of a cliche given the themes of class and race, but after watching it, we both agreed that \\"The Blind Side\\" is no cliche - it is truly a heartfelt, inspiring, family-friendly drama that emphasizes the virtues of compassion, civic responsibility, and the pure, abiding love of \\"family\\".

B003AYPMBU|3.0|Judas Priest is one of the most influential metal bands, the metal gods have delivered many times during their career and their back catalog is nothing short of classic and amazing. They made so many great albums during their long career like \\"Sad Wings of Destiny\\", \\"Stained Class\\", \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\", \\"Painkiller\\" and of course \\"British Steel\\". I'll admit \\"British Steel is not my favorite Priest album but it's up there and it's the one that first got me into the band to begin with. I remember seeing the video for \\"Breaking The Law\\" and it got me hooked on the band, I listened to everything Judas priest from then on. I still listen to Judas Priest and \\"British Steel\\" today, it's one of the albums that defined metal. Point is...they're one of the metal greats and \\"British Steel\\" is an excellent album yeah yeah. 2010 marks the 30th anniversary of British Steel and to commemorate this event a 30th anniversary edition of the album is released. What does this special edition of a classic metal album offer more than what was on the 2001 remaster? Well it turns out that they added things to the 2001 remaster (this remaster gave two extra tracks if you remember \\"Red, White & Blue\\" from the Turbo sessions and \\"Grinder (Live)\\" from the Defenders of the Faith tour). There also a three disc edition (the same thing as this one except with a live disc with the songs of the concert that`s on the DVD)available of this special edition trough Judas Priest`s website and as an import on Amazon.<br /><br />In terms of new music there's nothing much here, in fact there's absolutely nothing at all. It's the 2001 remaster of British Steel repackaged with a DVD. This means no extra songs, demos etc. None at all. Seeing how the extra songs on the 2001 remaster weren't from the Bristish Steel sessions or tour they could have done something special but there's nothing from either the session or the tour. There's a different album cover yeah, it's the razor blade from the original cover without the hand in a black background with blood underneath.<br /><br />Judas Priest celebrated the album in 2009 playing Bristish Steel live from beginning to end, the included DVD with the 30th anniversary edition of the album is a concert from the Seminole Hard Rock Arena in Hollywood. If you check the preview at the top of this page you can watch \\"Breaking The Law\\" and it gives you an idea of the DVD, the energy of the show and how much fans are still into it! Great concert and Halford hits all the high notes which amazed me, I didn't think he would be able to do so, maybe it was that he was fueled by the audience. This is more evident during \\"The Ripper\\", simply amazing. \\"Freewheel Burning\\" has the motorcycle intro which is really cool. \\"Diamonds and Rust\\", \\"You've Got Another Thing Coming\\" and \\"Hell Patrol\\" are among my favs so to see that the band still plays all of them is special to me. There is also \\"Prophecy\\" from Nostradamus the last album which is great. The selection of songs is really classic songs with British Steel songs totaling 15 songs.  The band is into it, the crow is into it and you will definitely be into it as well. In terms of DVDs that comes with an album this one is by far one of the best and not just because I love Judas priest! There are many times when the DVD you get with a CD is mediocre, not this one, and the show is filmed at reasonable pace so that it doesn't switch the action every second I'm thankful for that. There is also on the same DVD a documentary on the making of British Steel which interviews the band members (except drummer Dave Holland) about the album that I liked, it lasts about half an hour.<br /><br />Good news is if you want to own this package to upgrade your version of British Steel ( whether it's on Vinyl, the remastered CD...) to get the DVD is that it's only $12 at time of reviewing on Amazon(I paid mine 16$ in a local CD store) so it's pretty reasonable. My only disappointment is that the record company didn't include the extras they could have and that fans would really want such as demos, unreleased songs (if there are any) and other live tracks. So basically you are buying the 2001 remaster with a very good DVD of 15 songs and a making of, not exactly the best thing but not the worst either because it's a very good concert, the reason to buy the thing. Maybe you`ll want to get 3 disc edition for the extra concert CD. 3 stars.hey could have and that fans would really want such as demos, unreleased songs (if there are any) and other live tracks.

0143039431|4.0|I had always thought of myself as lucky for avoiding authors like Steinbeck and Fitzgerald in both high school and college, but after reading \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\", I realize now I did myself a service. Being below the age of 18 in high school, and still being financially supported by my parents in college, I would have probably knocked the book. I think the themes in the book are so complex and so adult that there is definitely a maturity level that needs to be reached to appreciate the book.<br /><br />Steinbeck does an excellent job of relating to the Joad's struggles, painting a picture of the depression, and truly captures the pain and reality of the travels to the west in 1939. Just from reading the book made the depression so much more alive where I could feel the Joad's heartbreak. I was just sick reading about the treatment of the people, but relieved to see the acts of kindness done throughout the novel. My favorite character was by far Ma. She set an example of how to keep a family together and the true definition of a humanitarian. Though I wouldn't have begged to read this book in high school, or college, I am truly appreciative that I waited to read it.
B0038VPB5W|4.0|This is a solid effort by the BFMV boys. A lot of people complain that it's not like The Poison or Scream Aim Fire. Well, to those people I say - A band cannot constantly produce the same album over and over again. Music changes and progresses in one way or another. With that said, I like this album, however, I think it is the weakest of the three full lengths that they've released. Can you tell that they used a Good Charlotte producer- yes. Unless it's just a coincidence that they're choruses sound overly 'chorused'. By that I mean that they use studio effects that make the choruses sound so clean it's almost bad. Pleasure and Pain, Begging For Mercy, Dignity, Your Betrayal, and the title track Fever definitely carry the rest of the album. All in all- a good album. If you're a BFMV fan you have no choice but to pick it up.
B00000J2SR|4.0|This album may not have been as good as rising but it's way better than listening to the modern average radio nonsence with nothing but a whole bunch of talentless hip hop posers or the nu metal artist of today. I thought every song on this album was absolutely decent, The singer Joe Lynn Turner kinda sounds like dio so for what ever reason dio left this singer was a great replacement for dio, the keyboardist David Rosenthal probably not like toney carey but he's a fine wicked keyboard wizard for these great songs and ritchie blackmore's guitar's were wickedly awesome!<br /><br />My advice: Say no to the radio and buy some rainbow albums!<br /><br />\m/ Stay metal \m/

1439153663|5.0|Wow.  Really, wow.  This book covers the time period from 1791-1810 in Virginia.  Revolving primarily around the plantation home of James Pyke and the lives of his slaves.  Admittedly, I was a bit reluctant to start this book, but I had chosen it, so I picked it up and began reading.  That's all it took.  The first adrenalin filled chapter will grab you.  You figure, heck, now I've got to see what happens next and you start the second chapter.  There the book settles into a less frantic pace and you follow the lives of 7 year old Irish servant Lavinia, and the half white/half black slave, Belle.  Belle fills the void left by Lavinia's deceased mother, and Belles extended family takes Lavinia in as one of their own.  The book is written through the eyes of Lavinia and Belle, with alternating chapters describing their view of what is happening at their home/plantation.<br /><br />  Thankfully, this is not a book where every slave/owner interaction is abusive and unpleasant.  Yes, there are some instances when things aren't pretty, but on the whole you get a wonderful view of the love that the slaves shared amongst themselves and with Lavinia.  You get a sense of the foreboding future that lies with the plantation owners son, Marshall.  He suffers at the hands of a \\"respected\\" gentleman and it affects his entire life and those around him.<br /><br />  I don't really like to write so much about the storyline and ruin it for others, so that is all I'll say about the plot.  Be assured, if you are like me and don't enjoy reading unpleasant things and would hesitate to pick up this book because of its slavery storyline, please re-think that.  Even the author stated she initially didn't want to write the book because she found slavery so abhorrent, but she had an unusual inspiration to do so, and she did it beautifully.  I feel almost guilty saying I enjoyed a book concerned with slavery, but I truly found parts of it very heartwarming.  It was one of those books that while I was doing the dishes, I thought about it and couldn't wait till I could sit back down and read the next chapter.  I hope to get my teenage daughter to read it and even my husband has shown an interest in it.  And tonight, I think I may even give that Molasses Cake recipe a try.ng the dishes, I thought about it and couldn't wait till I could sit back down and read the next chapter.

B002ZG9968|1.0|Holy perky opening credits batman! I almost stopped watching at this point due to annoying music and color combinations. Overall, I'm not really sure when the characters did what they did in the movie. I didn't understand the gross out moments, like the dog throwing up a pregnancy test and gross fluids at the gyno... yuck. All that I can figure out is that this movie was written for guys. It actually casts women in a pretty negative light and focuses on this random boyfriend's forbearance and tolerance. Gag. Seriously, what guy takes over financial responsibility and slips directly into marriage mode with woman he's been dating for a few months  and is pregnant with another man's child? And yet again, another movie makes me not want to have children. That should make K happy!<br /><br />The movie starts out on such a traditional note, by presenting all the requisite stereotypes with commonly unique names:<br />Clive - The gay best friend who is over involved in the friendship<br />Mona - The high maintenance best friend who is over involved in the friendship<br />- Don't expect to ever really see these two again<br />Zoe - The \\"every girl\\" (though I don't honestly understand how anyone can relate to JLo, she never really gives off an approachable vibe, more of a freaky diva one.)<br />Stan - The perfect dreamy guy who chases down a random girl he met to make all her dreams come true<br />A quirky pet - a French Bulldog in a wheel chair<br />A horrible, horrible soundtrack compiled of music that I hear at my gym<br />A ridiculous premise possibly resulting in a ginger baby<br /><br />However, some things were very realistic.<br />Every guy that I've ever met and then walked home with has grilled me about my first kiss and other girly details.<br />French bulldogs love to chew on pregnancy tests.<br />JLo is too thin to properly handle a garden hose.<br />JLo has to wear giant black framed glasses to drive.<br />Chili is edible on the stovetop and will not burn you and bread makes an excellent napkin.<br />Somehow you can \\"grow\\" and make cheese on a horse farm.

B00003CX5P|5.0|The pacing can be off at times but Liam Neeson's performance is as captivating as Alec Guiness' from the original and his performance combined with the beautiful action scenes make this film irresistable despite it's flaws! And no..jar Jar didn't bother me...he simply plays the fool that is vital to the storyline much like the fool in Shakespeare's King Lear and Akira Kurasawa's Ran. Natalie portman also did a good job as the Queen...acting in a performane well beyond her age at the time. This is a film about noble characters that some mistake as &#34;wooden.&#34; I also love the look of the movie. Shot on film and on more reals sets than the other 2 PT movies. And who can forget Darth Maul, a total bad ass!to pay the taxes imposed on by the Federation and as a result the Federation imposed a blockade, despite the fact that Naboo \\"is a democracy and the people have decided.\\" Turns out, as revealed through the book based on the original screenplay (and the must read for all Star Wars fans masterpiece \\"Darth Palgueis\\") that it is THE TRADE FEDERATION THAT IS BEING TAXED BY THE REPUBLIC AND IN RETALIATION ARE BLOCKADING THE PLANET OF NABOO. Why Naboo out of all the planets? Because this is where Senator Palpatine (Sideous) uses the opportunity to become Chancellor. That is why Naboo was specifically chosen. It was all decided in advance with the Federation thinking that Sideous was doing them a favor but Sideous was in it for himself. THIS IMPORTANT CONCEPT WAS COMPLETELY OVERLOOKED AND LOST IN THE FILM! Lucas really should have reiterated more on the fact that it was the Trade Federation who was trying to play the victim here, upset because THEY WERE THE ONES BEING TAXED and used this victimization as a guise to blockade Naboo in retaliation against the Republic's enforcement of taxes on all of their trade routes. We also needed a scene with the Trade Federation asking Sideous, \\"Why Naboo, out of all the planets in the entire galaxy,\\" then Sideous could give them an answer they want to hear, \\"Because Naboo has plasma and other resources that will make you wealthy. Don't worry about the Republic, I will make the invasion legal.\\" This would have conveyed to the viewer the motivation for the villains, something that was sorely lacking in this film. Instead everything is super vague and the only thing that caries the film are the visuals and Liam Neeson's great portrayl of Qui Gong.    The sub-plot of discovering Anakin and freeing him from slavery had very little issues to me. However the depictions of slavery could have been a little crueler in order to be more believable but I think it was more of a life of forced servitude rather than slavery as you and I know it and youhave to remember that Anakin is Watto's bread and butter, he's the only human that can pod race, remember? So beating him to the brink of death wouldn't make sense.    This film is also heavily criticized for it's acting, with critics claiming that the performances were wooden. It is here that I deeply disagree. I think people went into this film expecting performances akin to the original trilogy but they have to realize that these are completely different times and people we are dealing with in this film. I love the characters in this film because they are noble. This isn't a film about rebels and pirates, it's about Jedi and nobles. I think Liam Neeson, as Qui-Gong Jinn, is the heart of this film and if there is one central saving grace that carries this film out of its various plot holes it is his character. I think he is amazing. Liam Nessons presence is like Alec Guiness' in the original Star Wars. He literally carries the film on his shoulders and I can watch him being a wise Jedi all day because he does it flawlessly. He is literally the ideal Jedi that I always use to imagine about before the Prequel Trilogy came out. I think his performace was excellent and not wooden. I think too many people mistake playing a noble character for a wooden performance.    The same goes for Natalie Portman's performance as Queen Amidala. She performs well beyond her years and does an excellent job (her best performance out of the entire trilogy) of acting out a noble character and gets mistaken for a wooden performance. In addition Ewam McGregor is perfectly casted a Obi Won, despite playing more of a supportive role in this film and the actress that plays Anakin's mother does a fantastic job as well and is very believable.    It was also great to see Ian McDiarmid return as Sideous/Palpatine/Emperor. It helped connect the film to the old trilogy.    Despite my praise for these actors, I do have some criticism for the actor that plays Anakin.    George Lucas hadn't directeda film for 20 years and also the fact that Lucas has always been a visual director is probably why many people felt more to be desired from the actor that plays Anakin, Jake Lloyd. When Anakin had to say goodbye to his mother, all we got was a faint squint and barely watery eyes. When a child has to say farewell to their mom forever, you know they are going to be sobbing out of there minds and in this key scene the performance we got left much to be desired in my opinion. This scene was very important too because it was suppose to show the fear that the council was talking about when they were appraising Anakin in regards to whether he should become a Jedi but that was all lost with Lucas' terrible direction. It's not the actor's fault though and I am sure of it. On  a good note it is far more forgivable because he is a child and I think kids can get away a poor performance more so than an adult actor because the behavior of children is very variable. So it is easy for me to forgive this performance and I didn't expect too much out of Jake, it's just that you wish he gave more during the scenes that were supposed to be the emotional ones.    In regards to the controversial midichlorains plot device..I think people need to wake up when it comes to this. MIDICHLORIANS ARE NOT THE FORCE, SO STOP SAYING THAT'S WHAT THE FILM DEPICTS! Midichlorians are microscopic organisms that live within all living cells (like organelles) and if you listen, as a Jedi or Sith does, you can hear them communicating THE WILL OF THE FORCE. The force is still mystical, so stop complaining! I like this concept because it's a reality: not everyone is born equally, some are born with talent some are not. Some things I can do better than you, some things you can do better than me. If anything this makes the concept of people with super powers like the Jedi seem more real. If any fat couch potato could simply call upon the will of the force than the whole concept loses credence (and it's exactlythese type of people who hate this concept: Fat couch potato fan boys who wish they could be Jedi, wishing they could telekinetically bring the next slice of pizza to them from the pizza box from across the room).    In regards to Jar Jar, I think he gets way too much scrutiny and hate and I think he interjects a sense of personality other than noble into this film. Despite what critics say his character was important because without him, the Queen would never have had the aid of the Gungan army. People need to learn to lighten up too when it comes to his comedy and learn how to tap into that inner child (if they still have one). I feel that the people who hate Jar Jar and the Gungans are the same that hated the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi. Those people probably shouldn't be liking Star Wars to begin with in my opinion. For some odd reason there is this belief out there that after Empire Strikes Back that Lucas sold out and created the Ewoks to appeal to kids and make toys but if you read J.W. Rinzler's \\"The Making of Star Wars\\" books and see some of the first story treatments for the original film, you'd see that there was always supposed to be a battle on a forest planet that involved furry indigenous creatures, so essentially you haven't liked Star Wars since the beginning! So get off this boat and stop complaining about things that are geared towards children.    And in regards to the dubious allegations that his character is racist, people need to stop being ignorant. First of all he was created by a black actor named Ahmed Best, not George Lucas!. George Lucas created the design but let Ahmed completely create the character from innovation (listen to the audio commentary on the dvd). Ahmed was hired because of his movements too, not because he was African-American. The goofiness of the character was all improvised. Second of all. people claiming this is racist towards Jamaicans in fact display their idiotic ignorance because those making this claim clearly have never met a Jamaican in their entire lives! News to you politically correct Stalinist: Jamaicans don't even remotely act like this! Moreover, George Lucas is married to and has a child with an African-American woman and has lobbied against racism in the film industry against black film makers and how the industry overlooks films made by African-Americans.    Then there are more racist accusations with the character Watto, with critics claiming that he is a racist cartoon against Jews. Again people are so ignorant it is sad. First of all, Lucas is Jewish (Lucas is a Jewish name). Second of all, the character of Watto is a tribute to the film Ben-Hur (just like the pod race was a tribute to the chariot race). Watto's character is based on Hugh Griffith's performance as Sheik IIderim, who too was a slave owner. Watto's face was even molded after that character, which is the reason for the big nose. People really need to stop trying to claim this film is racist because in the end they are the ones that look like fools.    One thing I love about this film is the whole Ben-Hur tribute because that is one of my favorite movies ever. I love that this film pays tribute to older films and aside from the Ben-Hur references I feel that Qui Gong's character is a tribute to a samurai character out of an Akira Kurasawa movie.    I also love how this film introduces us to the mysterious Sith but leaves us guessing and drooling for more. Darth Maul was a great character (glad he's back in the TV show) and the fight choreography he performed was amazing.    It's attributes such as this that make this film worth viewing and where Lucas' strengths shine through. The Pod Race is easily on of the greatest chases in the history of film and always leaves me at the edge of my seat every time I watch it. And the sound is amazing! I also love the fact that Anakin is only 9 years old but races like a god! This was an excellent way to show how much of a prodigy and special kid he was, whileat the same time paying tribute to Lucas' old days of racing hot rods in Modesto.    I also love the fact that out of the entire prequel trilogy, this was the only one shot on film and as a result, looks more photo realistic. I think this is the best looking of the prequel films and that the CGI blends in perfectly with the real locations (Episode 2 and 3 was blue screen composited with miniature sets). The cinematography is great and sets are beautiful.    Despite these positives there are several more plot holes that were overlooked in this film and hurt it from reaching its full potential.    In the film there was no reason for Anakin to go with the Queen and Qui Gong to Naboo. In the novel, which is based of the original screenpley, this was explained: since the council rejected Qui Gong's plea to train Anakin he essentially was responsible for him and was his guardian. We needed to see this. It should have been in the movie, not cut.    Also having Anakin built C3P0 felt very lame, especially to \\"help mom around the house.\\" In the novel this was better explained: it was more than to just help mom around the house, it was so he could use him to interpret languages from aliens during trading so Watto wouldn't get swindled in a deal. This explanation gives much more credence to Anakin being the builder of C3PO. We needed to see this. It should have been in the movie, not cut.    Another thing lost from the screenplay in the transition to the film was the reason why Jar Jar had to go with Qui Gong into the city on Tatooine, something that was really illogical in the film. There was no explanation as to why Obi One had to stay and Jar Jar had go into the city. Basically Jar Jar went to make Qui Gong appear less like a Jedi and more like foreign travelers. We needed to see this. It should have been in the movie, not cut.    The novel also explains the removal of the explosive device that all slaves have, this was a huge plot hole in the film. We needed to see this. It should have been in the movie, not cut.    And my final critique is against the improbability of Anakin finding child-sized helmet and goggles in the Star Fighter. To me this was the most unforgivable and stupidest mistake in the entire film. This was not needed at all.    In the end, I have to honestly admit that I really like this film despite all it's flaws. For me, it is redeemed mostly by Liam Neeson and Natalie Portman's performances as true nobles and the breathtaking action pieces and alluring sets. I get what Lucas was trying to do by approaching this film with more of a political mindset. I appreciate that he took that back story very seriously, it's just that his direction and editing decisions could have been better. Despite this the undeniable sense of discovery and mystery I feel when I watch this make me feel like it is a great introduction to the Star Wars back story and Expanded Universe. I wouldn't recommend watching this before the original trilogy however. Watch those first and if you crave to learn about the back story to  Star Wars then watch this. I definitely recommend picking up the book \\"Darth Plagueis\\" by James Luceno after. To me, that is the real Episode 1 that has all the main back story to everything, Phantom Menace was just a preface...a real fun one.
B001VNB54A|2.0|Mediocre acting, about 40 min of story per hour and too drastic hollywood rewrites of Sledge's real life experiences. With the fine book \\"With The Old Breed\\" to build on, I think they could have made a much better film.
030726839X|5.0|Mr. Hastings presents another candid and thorough history in clear lucid language. As he admits in the Introduction, this is well trodden ground but his approach is refreshing, something like Cezanne returning to Mount Sainte-Victoire. His tribute to the late Roy Jenkins is a perfect touch.<br /><br />I am docking him one star because the jacket photograph is identified as the Prime Minister watching a \\"Flying Fortress bomber maneuver over an RAF establishment, July 23, 1941.\\" With such a precise date, they should get the aircraft right and it is not a B-17 Flying Fortress but appears to be a Bristol Blenheim, an aircraft of more mixed virtues.  I regret not giving five stars to a writer whose works I so admire but he has written enough military history to understand the responsibilities of command.<br /><br />I am amending this review after another reviewer corrected me. The aircraft is, in fact, one of the earlier B-17's, which I had misidentified as I thought the jacket photograph showed a two-engine plane. The website to which he directed me noted that the first use of this plane and others like it on the RAF's initial attempt to bomb Berlin took place on the date of this photograph. Mr. Churchill is thus watching the very first step on the road back to Berlin.
B003BKF6AU|5.0|I bought this vinyl from my local record store on May 7th, a few days before its release date of today.  This Double LP consists of two 180-gram (high quality) vinyls, each in its own cardboard decorated sleeve.  I've uploaded a photo showing the contents.  The record also includes a 256kbps digital download.  A very well designed record throughout, as far as packaging, although it doesn't include anything extra like a poster or CD.  However, for a double LP, the price of $14.99 I paid was exceptionally cheap.<br /><br />As for the music, I love it.  If you liked Boxer, you will like High Violet.  It's slightly more sad overall, but the sound is great.  You'll notice right away that you like it.

B002VPE1B6|2.0|Excellent movie - poor Blue Ray disk.    I had to update my Blue Ray player in order to play this, and it played glitchy.  Even after applying the latest patch to the Blue Ray player, it had difficulty reading the disc well enough to produce sound without skipping and clean video all the way through the movie.  The stop/play menu buttons were all unresponsive.  I pulled the plug on the Blue Ray player and used the DVD version instead.  After the movie, I tested another Blue Ray title, which played fine.    Sony's Blue Ray products are consistently absolute and utter crap.  The players should not need to be updated to play current titles and the constant technology updates means sometimes buggy implementations and glitchy playback.      I am getting sick to death of it, and will continue to choose DVDs until I have no other choice.  The only redeeming thing about this distribution was that a DVD copy was included.    If you haven't yet made the switch to Blue Ray  - don't bother.  It's way over-hyped and it's really not worth it.

B003LFLOOW|1.0|I think this is a great movie but what was so special about it was its special effects which couldn't be enjoyed through Amazon Video on Demand because the quality was so poor and blurry. Don't waste your money, if you want to go to the store to rent it or just buy it!
B0006GAOBI|5.0|After hearing from so many people, \\"I can't believe you, of all people, haven't seen this movie,\\" I finally watched DONNIE DARKO (2001). I got the movie for Christmas, and it's been sitting there, waiting for me to sit down and watch it. I kept thinking it was a slasher movie or something, and really didn't want to see a slasher movie, but because everyone kept saying I'd like it, including my son, I finally watched. It's not a slasher movie - chalk that up to really bad marketing years back when it came out. DONNIE DARKO is by far one of the best dark, strange, and brilliant films I've watched in a long, long time. And I don't use the word \\"brilliant\\" for movies lightly. OK, I can be pretty easy to please sometimes, but in this case - wow. Now, it might not be for everyone, it's a little surreal, definitely creepy, but the cast, especially (but not limited to) Jake Gyllenhaal as Donnie, is so strong, the writing and, hell, everything down to the music, it is an experience you should treat yourself to. Now, I strongly recommend getting the Director's Cut - it's 20 minutes longer but I can't imagine a minute of it being cut, and supposedly the special effects were ramped up - so if you end up missing the stunning visuals towards the end, then you're missing out. Won't get into the plot much, but I will suggest that to understand it, read carefully the pages of the book he finds (you'll know what I mean when you watch it), even pause the DVD enough to do this. They might make no sense, but it'll get your head ready for the ending. Anyway, a 5 out of 5 stars in the Dan movie book, if you like slightly left-of-center films, which I do. :-)

B000E33VWW|5.0|I know, I know. I should have watched this back in 2005 with everyone else. But, look, I have been really BUSY since then, ok? Cut me some slack, dangit.<br /><br />At any rate, I finally did get around to watching it, and it really is as good as everyone said. When the movie begins, Capote (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is fresh off the success of Breakfast at Tiffany's. He's looking for a new story to write, and he stumbles across a newspaper story about some brutal murders in Kansas.<br /><br />He heads to the tiny town that has been turned upside down by the tragedy and quickly realizes that the raw material there will help him create the best book he's ever written. As part of his research, Capote develops a close relationship with one of the accused killers, Perry White. As a viewer, I was unsure whether or not his relationship was genuine or self-serving, and I think that's the way director Bennett Miller wanted it.<br /><br />Over the course of four years, Capote works with Perry, trying to get him to tell him the story of the night of the murders. In the end, Capote publishes one of the most revolutionary novels of the 20th century - In Cold Blood. However, the experience clearly takes its toll on Capote, whose career follows a steady downward trend after In Cold Blood's marvelous success. It is the viewer's pondering of what effect writing the novel must have had on the author that makes watching the film so worthwhile.<br /><br />Definitely worth seeing. Performances are wonderful, and the story will make you think.
B00376AWHK|1.0|I just received my copy of Audio Fidelity's 24KT Gold version of Machine Head. What a huge disappointment.  What a waste of almost $30.  The double 25th Anniversary CD mixed by Roger Glover is vastly superior to this release in every single category. Sleeve, pictures, info, etc.  And the sound is so much better than this gold thing it's not even funny.  I bet that if at this moment I had a way of playing the original vinyl LP I got in 1976, it would sound better too.    What a waste of money. What a joke.    Stay away from this one, people. Get the 25th Anniversary double CD instead, you won't regret it.
B001PA0FFO|4.0|I recently got around to watching Doubt, the onscreen drama starring Meryl Streep, Amy Adams and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Wow. It was not as dark a movie as I had feared, performances are uniformly astonishing and the film keeps you second-guessing (which, I imagine, is the point).<br /><br />Inevitably, Streep is the star of this film. The legendary actress plays Sister Aloysius Beauvier, a nun who serves as the principal at a Catholic school in the Bronx. The year is 1964, and the school has just admitted its first black student (Donald, played by Joseph Foster) in the fall. There's a charismatic new priest in St. Nicholas parish - Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Father Flynn often finds himself at odds with Sister Aloysius' strict ways with the schoolchildren and her faith.<br /><br />So when young, naive Sister James (Amy Adams) mentions to Sister Aloysius that Father Flynn may have taken a bit too much interest in Donald, Sister Aloysius becomes certain that the relationship has developed into something improper.<br /><br />Without proof, the two nuns confront Father Flynn, who defends his innocence. Undaunted, Sister Aloysius schedules a meeting with Donald's mother (played with heartbreaking genius by Viola Davis). The woman, who is dealing with her own suspicions about Donald's nature as well as violence in the home, provides Sister Aloysius with no method through which to exercise her moral certainty.<br /><br />As Sister Aloysius becomes more and more definite in her efforts to oust Father Flynn, questions of faith and doubt emerge in stark relief.<br /><br />What can I say about this movie? Meryl Streep is a goddess, and anyone who denies it is a fool. The woman is Proteus-like in her ability to inhabit any character with utter credibility. It completely blows my mind. Adams and Hoffman aren't slouches, either, but Streep owns this movie.<br /><br />Though the story line isn't a happy one, rest assured that the film focuses on Sister Aloysius and her quest. The film purposefully neither confirms nor denies the suspected relationship between the priest and the boy, leaving the viewer to wonder if the nun's conviction has any truth.<br /><br />A fascinating character study. Worth watching for the performances alone, although the film's moral statement about \\"innocent until proven guilty\\" does make one think.nor denies the suspected relationship between the priest and the boy, leaving the viewer to wonder if the nun's conviction has any truth.

B003102JDM|2.0|...fall asleep about half way through a movie. All the way to the end. I'll admit I was tired when it began, but to actually fall asleep?! Very dull, IMO.  Surprising,  because I  really  dig a lot of  Coen  flicks, and was really looking forward to this one. Woody  Allen does this stuff much better  - funnier, sadder and  more poignant, far more cleverly, and  with better music. Can't win 'em all. Will look forward to their next, hope to see them again  reach the heights of Fargo, Lebowski, and Man Who Wasn't There.
B002PMV9FG|3.0|Dear Harry Potter,<br /><br />I'd like less lovey dovey, more bone-crushing magical action, please.<br /><br />Yours in wizarding,<br /><br />Me<br /><br />While I found this movie entertaining, I thought it was more of a logistical backflip than a great movie in its own right. I recall that one of the things that impressed me the most about this book in the series was its deft set-up for the final installment. The movie operates in much the same way. Though there is some plot action going on (most notably, Dumbeldore's death), the primary purpose of this part of the tale is to put all the pieces in place for a grand finish.<br /><br />There was an emphasis on the raging hormones of all the characters in this movie, but I thought it a bit overdone and oversimplified. Less love and more story, please!<br /><br />Effects were great, with the horcrux scene in a gloomy cave being particularly noteworthy. I was also impressed with the actor who played Voldemort/Tom Riddle at 16, Frank Dillane. Beautiful, with just the right touch of creepy. Worth seeing, but I'm much more excited about the coming two movies. Hope they don't screw them up.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|I watched this movie last night.  Fortunately I didn't have to pay to go to the movie theater to see it.  A family member owns this movie.  The one star is for the mixture of good computer imagery (good computer programmer).  To say the best, the story line is boring and the usual hollywood political idoacy.  The plot seems created by the same guy who writes most of hollywood's trash today and pre-school political childs books.  I guarantee that a new copy of this movie will be available for less than $5 at your local Target in less than a year.  If you really want to see it wait until your family member buys it then, and don't waist your money.
B002RSDW80|4.0|I loved this movie.<br /><br />First of all, Meryl Streep. Need I say more? She totally nails the Julia Child voice and mannerisms. But she does it while maintaining Julia as an actual person, not some 2D caricature. Amy Adams, as Julie Powell, is no slouch, either. Streep and Stanley Tucci do an excellent job of re-creating the Childs' warm and wonderful love affair, and Chris Messina is admirable as Powell's long-suffering husband.<br /><br />Though there is significantly less profanity in the movie than in the book it was based on, it's a pretty close match up other than that. And I loved the light touch of the film, which filed off a few of Powell's harder edges from the book. Though Childs' inability to have a baby was referenced, it wasn't belabored, and though the Powell marriage went through its up and downs (and ended, I believe, not too long ago), those troubles didn't overwhelm the real story - a woman's discovery of her voice and her confidence in the kitchen.<br /><br />I laughed out loud a few times, and I completely enjoyed myself while watching this movie. Very much recommended!
B00375DBWY|1.0|This tour is nothing more than an absolute disaster.  I have no doubt that if fans had known that this show would be so poor before they bought tickets, I bet many people would have opted to skip it.  Madonna tries way too hard this time to be \\"hip\\" and \\"cool\\" with sleazy costumes and dance moves, and it just looks embarassing - nobody wants to see a 50-something doing that stuff.  Even worse, the setlist is terrible - filled with songs from her forgettable album \\"Hard Candy\\" and any of the older songs that she sings are butchered and remixed to the point where they are unrecognizeable.  I don't know about you, but I hate remixes and I definitely hate remixes that make the song sound completely different from the original.  Lastly, the \\"choreography\\" is lazy and cheesy and just a lot of bump and grind that anyone could do.      I find it funny that Madonna's two best tours - Blonde Ambition and Re-Invention STILL have not been released properly on DVD.  If they ever get released, I would recommend getting those instead.
193413712X|5.0|Loved this book, the most optimistic book about death imaginable. Without being false or sentimental, it embraces the view that life is worth living despite the pain and suffering it comes with, and it comes with a lot.<br /><br />It's rare book can make you cry from a happy thing happening, and that this book does that. It's not so rare that a book can make you cry from an unhappy thing happening. This book does that too.<br /><br />Bravo.
0618918248|5.0|Sometimes, when I finish reading a novel--if the novel is especially well-written and the characters are memorable--I'm sad that I have to leave the characters and the world of the novel behind. It's like saying goodbye to a friend. I cannot recall ever experiencing that feeling after having read a non-fiction book--until now. Richard Dawkins is simply brilliant--he articulates ideas and theories in ways that I wish I could, and his reasoning makes so much sense that it's almost impossible for a rational person to disagree with him. I respect him for his courage in exposing the frightening power that supernatural faith has over many people in the world who claim to be enlightened, and I envy him for his ability to express his ideas so clearly and convincingly. I deliberately read this book slowly so that I could savor the power and brilliance of Dawkins' argument. This book will become a permanent fixture on my shelf, because I never want to lose the ability to cite his reasoning when some well-meaning \\"Christian\\" tries to convince me of the value of faith and religion. It has been a very long time since I've read something that makes this much sense.
B001E75QGG|5.0|The movie is a wonderful return to a classic character, as Harrison Ford is able to recreate the part with ease. The only other returning character, Marion Ravenwood, doesn't come off as clearly as in her previous outing, but Karen Allen is still captivating and the easy, natural way Marion and Indy fall back together is more realistic than having them \\"fall in love again\\". It is clear that they were always still in love with each other and the simplist of declarations is all that is necessary to put their relationship back in full force.     New character Mutt Williams (Shia LaBeouf) is a credible addition to the Jones family, another young man running away from his heritage. John Hurt makes a great crazy man (but we knew that already) and Ray Winstone's Mac is a nice twist on the traditional Indy sidekick. Jim Broadbent makes an acceptable faux-Marcus and Cate Blanchett chews the scenery deliciously as the Commie badguy. (Who is actually motivated by a foolish love for collectivism - a nice touch.)     If the dialogue is a little creaky in places and some of the effects less believable than the previous films, it is more than balanced by the sheer entertainment factor, as well as Ford's portrayal holding the whole thing together. At least it errs on the side of fun, unlike the worst film in the series ('Temple of Doom') that ratcheted up the \\"darkness\\".
1423113381|5.0|\\"Red Pyramid\\" is so much fun I hope you put it on your to-be-read list.  The pacing is fast, the characters are well formed, and there's lots to learn.<br /><br />This new series from Rick Riordan, unlike the Percy Jackson series, is told by a brother and sister -- Carter and Sadie -- who alternate chapters.  The setting is an alternative earth where magic exists.  In this case, the magic is based in Egyptian mythology rather than the Greek of \\"The Olympians\\" books.  And Carter and Sadie have their heritage flow from the pharaohs rather than from be offspring of the gods themselves.<br /><br />The story begins when Carter and Sadie's dad bring them together on the eve of Christmas.  Their gatherings are strange enough since Carter and Sadie only get to see each other for two days a year-- they have been raised apart since their mother's death when Sadie was 6 years-old-- but this day their dad takes them to the British museum to see the Rosetta Stone after hours.  And what starts off pretty weirdly only gets seriously strange when their father blows up the Rosetta Stone and releases some gods that were perhaps better left in their prisons.  It's an event which leaves them effectively parentless and starts them off on their strange journey to bring the forces of the universe back into balance.<br /><br />Besides the story and the Egyptian elements there are some other interesting aspects to this story.  For one, Carter is black while Sadie is very light skinned.  This and the fact that they are different genders allows Mr. Riordan to show us their world from different perspectives.  And the author doesn't skip the chance to point out the social issues that arise from those small differences.  Carter's dad, for example, has drilled into him that being a black boy/man means that he must take special care with how he dresses, while Sadie is accepted as she is, red streaked hair and all.<br /><br />TALKING POINTS:::<br />Well written, Riordan includes a lot of humor in this quick paced book.<br /><br />It's amazing at how adept he has become in tucking facts into the flow of the narrative.  There's lots here for most adults and kids to learn.<br /><br />Highly recommend this book for Tweeners and Middle-graders and anyone else who isn't a stuffed shirt and likes kidlit.<br /><br />AR level = generic \\"4\\"<br /><br />Pam T~<br />(reviewer, booksforkids-reviews)mazing at how adept he has become in tucking facts into the flow of the narrative.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|Slumdog Millionaire tells the story of Jamal, his brother Silam, and Latika. All three children are orphaned in an attack on the Mumbai slum in which they live. They join forces to lead an adventurous, poverty-stricken life. Jamal and Silam become separated from Lakita in the midst of a daring escape from a gangster. For years thereafter, Jamal searches for Lakita. He finds her years later, only to be separated from her again.<br /><br />In desperation, Jamal manages to land a spot as a contestant on the Indian version of \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?\\", hoping aginst hope that Latika will be watching so they can be reunited. In a twist of destiny, Jamal discovers that, due to the unique experiences growing up in the slums, he knows the answer to question after question.<br /><br />Though there are definitely some very difficult parts of this movie to watch (especially at the beginning, when the primary characters are helpless children, prey to the unsavory environments that surround them), the film is ultimately uplifting. A marvel of casting, to boot, as a gifted actor portrays each of the princpal characters in different stages of life.<br /><br />Sooooo worth seeing. I really loved it!
0767802470|5.0|As far as I'm concerned, Das Boot is THE submarine film, and one of Germany's best films (alongside Nosferatu, both versions; Metropolis, and Downfall).  More modern films such as Crimson Tide and U-571 are more entertaining on the popcorn film level, but compared to this those films are just merely entertainment.  Das Boot may not be 100 percent realistic, but that doesn't matter that much anyway.  Everytime you watch this film, you get the feeling that this is the real deal.  Das Boot may not have a profound anti-war message within (war is ugly and needless, obviously), but it really doesn't matter much.  Das Boot works better as a hellish portayle of submarine warfare, hell, that's the main point of the film.  Needless to say it works extremely well.<br /><br />The film's plot concerns the trip of a U-96 Submarine.  Be thankful of what you get when you see them hang out in a fancy nightclub, that's all you get until sinking into the incredibly confining and cramped submarine.  Much like real war, you get periods of quaint moments, with some really intense moments.  And really, that's where the movie pretty much is.  Everything else is plot that I don't want you spoil.  Storms, claustophobia, tensions between the soldiers, health risks, attacks on the submarine, and depth charges are all of the things that await the viewer.<br /><br />Much of the film's sucess is the fantastic direction, as my review has been hinting at.  It's all true.  The bleakness and unglamorous depiction of submarine warfare is intact in the beautifully designed visual style of Das Boot. The confining quarters are shown throughout the whole film, and everything the camera does is right on the mark.  Even when the people run around with a panic, the camera seems to do so as well, and it even shakes like a maniac when the submarine is hit, like it would in real life.  It's non-glossy grit adds to it's realism.  The lighting varies from well lighting to sickly grim red and blue atmosphere.  The sound is great as well, with every beep, explosion, and everything else intact with gutso and brooding craft.  The Director's Cut is responsible for the better sound quality, so be sure to get that version if you want the full experience.<br /><br />I'll give you an example of how great the direction of this film is.  During a part where they are partially submerged they suddenly see a boat approaching them.  As the submarine went under and showed the submarine doing so, I actually turned my body down into a limbo position instinctively when the boat's bottom showed up on screen.  This wasn't on the biggest screen either.  This should give you an example on how well made the submarine experience is depicted.<br /><br />It may be icing on the cake, but the film does have good messages and some interesting characters, all portrayed as human beings, both flawed and with virtue, like most soldiers in real life.  The movie does a good job at portraying them as such, as it shows these people as just cogs in the Nazi machine, their no different from the other hapless soldiers who are required to fight the war.  They all are very interesting, and one even has a lustful love of submarine engines (as one who adores the roar of a F-22 Raptor, I can relate).  It may make no sense to people who think all German soldiers are bloodthirsty Nazi's like the ones in the Indiana Jones films, but for those with a brain and can seperate that, you will have troubling believing this.<br /><br />Das Boot is one of the more substantial war films.  It's anti war film message is direct and engrained more than anything else, it's warfare scenes (in the water) are exciting, the plot is great, and of course it's the movie that really let's you feel what being in a submarine is like.  To me that's a very good thing, even if it may not be as emotionally powerful as Saving Private Ryan.  Try seeing this on the biggest screen possible for maximum effect, but either way, this film hasn't dated one bit and still floats to the near top of the great war fims.  Oh, and forget the overrated Stalingrad, Das Boot is much more superior.f the great war fims.  Oh, and forget the overrated Stalingrad, Das Boot is much more superior.

They actually finished all the books within the series!!
0307454541|4.0|I simply could not put this book down. The novel is like a cross between a murder mystery, an epic tale about a successful business family, and a business/financial labyrinth, with a bit of love thrown in.<br /><br />Here's the skinny: Mikael Blomkvist is a journalist who has just been burned by a major expose that went wrong. As he recovers from the greatest setback of his career, Blomkvist is hired by Henrik Vanger, an aging business giant, to discover what became of his favorite niece, Harriet. (Harriet disappeared more than forty years ago. No body has ever been found, and no one has ever heard what became of her.)<br /><br />For various reasons, Blomkvist takes the job. In his search, he pairs up with Lisbeth Salander, a tattooed punk computer prodigy. The two develop a relationship as they uncover clues to the old mystery.<br /><br />Though there are certainly some parts of the book that were difficult to read (Blomkvist and Salander research a series of grisly murders), character development in this novel, particularly in the case of Salander, is amazing. The plot moves quickly and keeps the reader guessing as to the truth - suspects, motives, the lot.<br /><br />Worth reading. I stayed up at night to finish this one.

B0034JKZ3G|4.0|Great modern Disney movie. My 1& 2 yr old girls love it, especially the songs. Based around new orleans & jazz music. There are some darker themes in some parts dealing with the voodoo doctor & some mild violence but mostly harmless fun. I got the combo package so I could get the digital copy for my iPhone. Definetly worth purchasing.
0439023491|5.0|I am so in love with this series! The Hunger Games was and amazing read, and Catching Fire was a worthy sequel. I didn't feel like the book dragged at all, and I feel like the second book definitely added depth to the overall story. It was NOT FILLER, as so many middle books in a series are. I was left breathless, and wanting more. I simply can't wait for the next book!

This second book features both Blomkvist and Salander, but more of the latter than the former.<br /><br />In book two, we learn much more about Salander, her history, and her motives. And though I wouldn't say that the end of book two leaves the reader hanging, there are certainly a few loose ends to be tied up.<br /><br />That noted, I admit that the tale of the novels' author was another driving factor in my reading tear. From Wikipedia: Stieg Larsson was a Swedish journalist widely considered an expert on extreme right and racist organizations. He frequently wrote and spoke publicly against such movements. Because of his public position, he'd made some enemies in Sweden. As a result, he reportedly lived under death threats from his political enemies for years. Swedish law states that, to marry, one must have a public address on record, and Larsson was so against his address being made available that he did not marry his long-term companion, Eva Gabrielsson.<br /><br />Apparently, Larsson worked as a journalist and speaker during the day, and he came home and wrote these books at night. His goal was to complete a series of 10 books. However, he had written three books before he even approached a publisher about having them printed. Once he'd had a contract written up and delivered the first three books, Larsson died. He died, at the age of 50, of a massive myocardial infarction (heart attack). He left behind the unfinished manuscript of the fourth novel and synopses of the fifth and sixth in the series.<br /><br />Now, to me, the story of the novelist is nearly as interesting as that of the novels themselves. Who works all day, lives under the threat of death, then goes home at night and completes THREE ENTIRE BOOKS without a peep? Then, he just shows up at a publishing house, turns the three books over, then promptly dies? Utterly fascinating.<br /><br />And what's also intriguing is the unfinished work. I will forever wonder what he would have written, what, say, the ninth book would have been about, had he lived to write it.<br /><br />Regardless, I can vouch for the fact that the first two novels are thrilling page-turners and worth every word. I anxiously await installment three and mourn all the books this author never got the chance to write.hed work.

B000WQW988|4.0|so, i love this concert, and i listen to the cd all the time. my problem is with the DVD audio...when i play this with my speakers at home, i cannot hear the guitar leads! they are mixed way quiet, and very in the background. i don't have a fancy stereo with 5 speakers - just an amp hooked up to the dvd player, and two big speakers, but that shouldn't matter! i have tried every audio setting (DTS, dolby 5.1) on the DVD menu, and you just can't hear the lead guitar. maybe if anyone knows of some secret setting on the DVD menu that makes it so you can hear kurt's guitar like you can on the CD version, i'd love to know it!!

B002JVWR9U|5.0|I always had an interest in \\"Dracula\\" and the historical figures of which he was a composite (at least one was female). I did tune in to Barnabas Collins' adventures, but wasn't compelled by them. Generally, the portrayals have all been so campy and uniform in characterization. I will, of course, try \\"Dark Shadows\\" again when it comes out in movie form, simply because Depp is Barnabas! (Who wouldn't?)    Bring us up to century: The whole \\"Twilight\\" thing just seemed ridiculously puerile and, sorry, that Pattinson guy is downright raggedy, compared to Paul Wesley, and yards less interesting. Didn't get into \\"Buffy\\" or \\"Angel\\"--again, it all seemed somewhat tongue-in-cheek.    When I saw the promos for \\"Vampire Diaries\\" (I, too, didn't know it was based on tweenie books), there seemed to be something slightly different about it but, then, we're talking the network that has \\"90210\\" and \\"One Tree Hill,\\" which probably wouldn't have interested me when I was actually in that age group. To be fair, I love \\"Smallville\\" and \\"Supernatural,\\" so I'm not dismissing the CW by any means--simply slotting them in, generally, to a particular demographic.    I decided to try \\"Vampire Diaries\\" and was hooked, irrevocably, on the entire atmosphere, backstories, and so on. The high-school aspect, eh, but the rest is very grown-up in tenor and the storylines have become increasingly compelling. It is actually an interesting show and, of course, the beautiful, but not cookie-cutter, people don't hurt (anyone else notice the distinctive similarities between Steven McQueen's face and expressions and those of his grandfather?).    Hope it sticks around. With \\"Lost\\" going and probably \\"Heroes,\\" as well, after the upcoming, abbreviated, season, the shows I'm loyal to are becoming fewer and fewer.
B000F3UAFC|3.0|Yeah, I know, this is based on an Oscar Wilde play, but that doesn't excuse the somewhat stolid tone of this lavish production. Despite the lush sets, I wasn't enthralled. Scarlett Johansson looks like she is in way beyond her depth here. She seems to have but one expression. All the old ladies and old men function as background gossips, but they never really become part of the program. It lacks a sense of subtlety, overall. A bit too broad.

032147404X|4.0|I bought this to help my girlfriend get into photography.  I'm somewhere in the intermediate skill range, and already have a solid understanding of the technical aspects of photography.  Reading through this, I found that I agree with a lot of Kelby's tips.  There were also quite a few that useful to me, even at my skill level.  His results-oriented approach works really well.<br /><br />I found only two (glaring) problems that really need to be revised in the next version (and I don't see how the editor even okay'd them in the first place).<br /><br />1) Skip the first chapter. As others have noted, Kelby takes the reader on a wild goose chase of lies and misdirection. This is in bad taste especially for a beginners book, since they are not going to know when you are BS'ing them or not. It follows the formula: \\"this is the secret of photography .... gotcha!  You are such a gullible sap!\\".  You can read the chapter on Amazon to see for yourself.<br /><br />BUT the rest of the book is not like this.  That's why I urge you to just skip the first chapter.  I urge Kelby to dispose of it and save some trees.<br /><br />2)  The author overuses the word \\"pro\\".  If you can go for even one sentence without encountering it then you're probably not reading this book.  He seems to be under the delusion that novices walk around all day bouncing that word around their head. It becomes meaningless.  Someone please send him a thesaurus. Or just drop some of the occurrences altogether.  It's already understood that we want to take better pics.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|This series must be seen to be believed. I happened upon season 1 by accident and haven't missed an episode since. Breaking Bad is one of those rare creations that takes the darkest of circumstances and brings them to a place where you can care for, understand and empathize with the \\"everyman\\" cast of characters while not glossing over the collateral damage of their incredibly poor choices. Addictive seems too obvious an adjective to describe the series but probably is the most fitting.    I would recommend watching Season 1 if you haven't already to provide you with the backstory (so as to not miss the references in Season 2); however it would not be necessary since the Second Season is powerful enough on its own.[[ASIN:B001DJLCRC Breaking Bad - The Complete First Season]]    This is a story with a lot of heart, intelligence, a wicked sense of humor and enough action to keep anyone craving the next installment.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|The superb HBO Miniseries \\"The Pacific\\" is another remarkable collaborative production effort by Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks. It follows the US Marine Corps through the horrific World War II Pacific battles of Guadalcanal, Cape Gloucester, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa.  Short interludes in Melbourne, Australia; Paris Island; and some stateside hometowns provide a jarring counterpoint to the battle scenes.<br /><br />Comparisons with \\"Band of Brothers\\" are perhaps inevitable.  \\"Band of Brothers\\" had the advantage of following a single unit through the war, and was derived primarily from Stephen Ambrose's superb book of the same name.  The narrative thread of \\"The Pacific\\" is the experience of three individual Marines whose lives are reasonably well documented.  However, their stories overlap minimally, and the ensemble feel and continuity of \\"Band of Brothers\\" is lacking.  Perhaps in compensation, \\"The Pacific\\" is a gritty, violent, and painfully graphic presentation of what it was like to be a Marine in the Pacific war.<br /><br />The three Marines featured in the miniseries are meant to be broadly representative of the Corps.  John Basilone is a pre-war Marine who wins the Medal of Honor at Guadalcanal, and is sent home to sell war bonds.  He will fight to return to duty, first as a trainer of new Marines, then as a leader of troops at Iwo Jima.  Robert Leckie joined up after Pearl Harbor and survived the fighting on Guadalcanal before being sent home for wounds suffered at Peleliu.  Eugene Sledge joined up a little later, held out by a medical condition, and would serve \\"With the Old Breed\\" at Peleliu and Okinawa, as his autobiography puts it.  He carries the narrative to the end of the war, in the mud and carnage of an Okinawan battlefield populated by large numbers of civilians as well as combatants.  A final episode captures the efforts of the survivors to reintegrate back into civilian life.<br /><br />Each episode of \\"The Pacific\\" opens with a few remarks by surviving veterans and a voice-over narrative by Tom Hanks that connects the episodes.  Every effort appears to have been made to show authentic uniforms, weapons, and equipment.  The individual episodes run less than an hour, but they pack an emotional punch that should be plenty for all but the most hardened viewers.  \\"The Pacific\\" is highly recommended to those viewers who found \\"Band of Brothers\\" to be a worthwhile experience.ns and a voice-over narrative by Tom Hanks that connects the episodes.

B003K1EYM6|4.0|While I agree on the outrageousness of the opportunistic pricing by marketplace vendors here at the moment, it does NOT mean this product should get a one star rating.    That being said, the connection kit (if you can get ahold of one) works as described.  I've tested it with Nikon RAW NEF files and it works beautifully.  It maintains the original untouched NEF through the camera -> iPad -> iPhoto on Mac path without compromising the RAW image - this was a major concern for me.    A friend has a DSLR that takes Compact Flash and after a great deal of research was able to find a USB card reader that was compatible with the USB connection adapter so she could view/transfer the images without having to tether the camera over USB!  The biggest issue was finding a CF card reader that did not draw too much power from the iPad.    My only gripe, and the reason for the deduction of a star is the performance / ease of quickly reviewing images.  I find the highest utility of this device is to quickly review a photo on a much larger screen while on location.  When you first put the card in, the Photo app generates thumbnails of the images on the card.  These are of a fixed size and to view the image any larger you must fully import the image into the Photo library on-device then view it.  There is no way to view a larger image directly from the memory card.  This makes the process of reviewing a few images amongst many pretty cumbersome.    For fun, I tried hooking up a USB keyboard to the USB adaptor and can confirm it works like reports elsewhere have said.  3rd party apps don't have access to all of the function keys/control key combinations yet but built in Apple apps do.  Maybe in a future OS release?
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|If there was any justice in this world, Katey Sagal would have earned a slew of awards for her portrayal of Gemma Teller Morrow in FX's biker gang drama, loosely based on Shakespeare's Hamlet.  Season One introduced us to the Sons of Anarchy, a California based biker gang with its fingers in gunrunning, porn, and other illegal activities.  Much more so than in the first season, Gemma is the emotional lynchpin around which the other characters rotate.  Most of the tension in Season Two is the growing animosity between club president Clay Morrow (Gemma's husband, played by Ron Pearlman) and stepson Jax Teller (Charlie Hunnam), who serves as vice president.  Some of the events from Season One have left a bad taste in Jax's mouth and threaten to tear the club apart as he seeks to take it in a new direction.<br /><br />From Episode One, in which the Sons are threatened by a white supremacist group upset by the bikers dealing guns to \\"colored\\", Gemma is forced to carry a secret that could destroy the club.  This secret brings her closer to Jax's doctor girlfriend Tara and corrupt Chief of Police Wayne Unser.  As the rift between Clay and Jax deepens, the club must deal with the white supremacists, the ATF, and problems with their Irish gun connections, as well as other personal demons stemming from the events of Season One.  Everything comes to a head in an amazingly well-written finale that will keep you riveted and frustrate you at the same time.<br /><br />In my opinion, SoA is by far the best show currently airing on television.  The writing and acting is all superb and I've been really impressed with the pacing of the series.  They really have a handle on how to deliver the highs and lows necessary to maintain interest in a series over the course of a season.  And let me reiterate how amazing Katey Sagal is in the role of club matriarch Gemma Teller Morrow.  Her character is such an important one to the myriad of story threads in Season Two and Sagal's performance is critical to what makes SoA work.  She really brings a presence and intensity to the role.  Watch the 90 minute episode \\"Balm\\" and you too will be wondering how come she didn't win an award for her work on this show.what makes SoA work.

B0015DWJX2|5.0|I really loved this book!  The epistolary style is a bit hard to follow at the beginning, but it does get easier as you read and get the people's names nailed down in your head.  The characters are charming and quirky, but their letters do give a dose of the harsh realities of the German occupation of Guernsey during WW2.  Its a very human book, full of the great and small tragedies they survived.<br /><br />As a few reviewers have said, there were some fairly predictable elements (mostly dealing with the romance aspect) but these were minor irritations (at least to me)

B002FGU3XQ|5.0|Terra Fi 3 is a first-rate successor to the 'classic' Teva sandal. Fit and comfort are excellent from first use, and, unlike the flimsier Hurricane model, footbed construction is comparable to the classic Teva. Footbed improvements include more-upturned heel cup in back, and 'shock-pad' directly under heel for added support; after a month of wear, I like both. I wear my Teva's all day, every day from April thru November, and wish every shoe I bought was this comfortable and functional. Just bought a second pair for beach/biking/whatever.

B002OEBMN4|5.0|The funny thing i always see on here with a Slayer Cd review is they are either getting bashed for not sounding like Reign in Blood or they have lost what they started with. This is a band that has been around for 20 plus years. Do some of you want a constant repeat like some bands are guilty of or do you want something fresh. I think this album for Slayer embodied both what they started with and what they have become. Its called maturity which all bands should have some do not. I like Slayer period some i like more than others but this band is what alot of what some bands wish they could be. Most reviews i see say Slayer is not what they were, they got soft, changed their style,basically what they are saying Slayer didnt make another Reign in Blood and they dont like it. I think this is one of Slayer's best. If u dont like to nit pick everything and have always like Slayer then buy this album.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|The film \\"Dreams\\", last full length feature of Akiro Kurosawa touches on enormous themes, and is visually exciting...<br /><br />Broken down into several short films it captures the lives of different men, women, and children. Each scetch has its own unique setting, and is completely unlike the other ones in terms of the visual effects used. Kurosawa masterfully interplays the normal and the grotesque. Simplicity and fairy-tale. Despite - there s always a very very reach useage of colors, a palitte astounding to ones eye. Overall, it is a rather sad movie. Sad in in its thoughtfulness, presenting a stage of a director who has already passed a cusp of his prime and is thinking about his going as well as the more universal meaning of his life. That said, Kurosawa doesn't want his viewer to be sad. On the contrary he wants us to lit up and see the deeper magic of life..
0316044938|1.0|Good start.  The idea of a murdered 14-year-old telling her story as resident in heaven is an attractive idea.    However, the story-telling goes down hill rapidly as the characters behave in manners so bizarre, so quickly, that as a reader I find it hard to keep interest.  The most ridiculous point (amongst many) is the main character's desire to spend her only time back on earth having sex with a little boy (now grown up) who used to like her.  If the girl is raped then brutally murdered at the age of 14, one would think sex is probably not the most important thing on the mind of such a soul.    A good story must have a good beginning, a decent middle and an equally good end.  The author has failed even at the second hurdle.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Long criticized for it's washed out appearance, the original taping of this, the best interpretation of P&P IMHO, suffered the problematics of low budget TV productions and older technology, which did lead to over exposure, washing out of color, and extremes of contrast and shadows. This digitalized version only enhances the sets, brightens colors of clothing, complexions, avoiding the problems of the filming techniques which to my opinion distracted from the experience of the the story in the '95 production....  Long and short.... I am more than happy I purchased this new DVD.

0743486285|5.0|Nikki Sixx's story is nothing but fascinating.  The style this book was written and the words inside of it felt like I was reading tales from my own journal.  No, I never lived as a rock star, nor did I have fame or the things his age and money left him do -- but there's something to be said for the erratic, lucid scribblings of a mad man.  I've journaled since I can recall, and these single lines, occasional paragraphs and reasons behind his writings are just as I tend to do myself.  There's also something to be said for the unconventional portrayal of one's biography.  I no longer possess the attention span to fully follow chapters, paragraphs, and endless stories of someone's entire life.  The way this is broken up and frequently changing pace kept my attention and made me appreciate the day to day happenings instead of the standard, \\"I was born here, went to school here, lost my way, it was crazy, and let my glamourize my downfall\\" style of most who feel possessed to \\"write a book\\" as had now become so common amongst, ooooh, just about everyone.    The other thing I really respected in reading this were the tales and accounts of other people in his life.  I feel no biography is truly complete until you know how others close to you perceived your life, interactions, and relationships with them.  It's one thing to have your own experience, but I feel when something's written merely one-sided from the author's view behind their own skull, you get a lopsided portrayal.  It's easy for many to skip accountability and responsibility and inadvertently try to justify all their missteps by simply telling readers why they did what they did or what was going through their mind at the time.  It takes a lot of humility and bravery to let others dish about you and let others read the negative things many had to say and share.    This book is relatable to many addicts, but also -- I would imagine -- gives a really detailed account of the beast of addiction so many get lost in to those who've never experienced it themselves.  I felt it was chronicled so well that someone who's never touched a drug could really see just how things get out of hand so quickly.  It wasn't just the fame, the talent, the music that led Nikki to where he ended up .. this story could be anyone's story.  And, I feel he made that clear with the very quote even left on the back cover.  I am very impressed with this and would recommend it to mostly anyone.

0393327655|3.0|Harris' book would seem to be a reasonable response to the 9/11 attacks.  Indeed the event brought into focus the danger of religious fanatics acting out their otherworldly fantasies.  Although Harris sees Islamic extremists as the greatest danger, he also points out the threat of the more fanatical Christian fundamentalists in the United States.  His observation that Jerry Falwell and Tim Lehay (the co-author of the \\"Left Behind\\" novels) were allowed to participate in Nation Security briefings under Reagan is genuinely shocking!  I grew up attending a little country church in close proximity to the local Youth for Christ ministry and state Klan headquarters.  \\"George Wallace for President\\" bumper stickers were embarrassingly easy to find in the church parking lot.  In those days my father dismissed fundamentalist organizations like Youth for Christ as something \\"for lower class people\\".  Sadly, this is no longer the case!  To have these primitives so close to the nuclear button (and their yearned-for Armageddon) is a recipe for disaster--a self-fulfilling prophecy that I have no desire to see played out!  On the other hand, it is difficult for any person unaffiliated with organized religion (let alone an avowed atheist or agnostic) to aspire to high political office in our county, regardless of their qualifications and character--clearly a ridiculous state of affairs!<br /><br />Harris' somewhat novel remedy to this problem relies on the assertion that if religious moderates were to disavow the miraculous claims of their respective faiths, religious fanatics would be exposed as the danger that they truly represent, their numbers would be reduced by societal pressures, and they would be exiled from positions of power and relegated to the margins of society.  In the world that Harris envisions, admitting that you are in favor of a foreign policy that looks to an immanent second coming and Armageddon would seal the doom of any career in politics, while a profession of outright atheism would be heard without exciting any great concern.  Although I would be very happy if his approach were successfully implemented and such an enlightened world actually came to pass, I must confess that I have my doubts as to its effectiveness of Harris' strategy, at least in the USA.<br /><br />As I reflect on the changes that have come to our country since I was a small child in 1950's, and having grown up with evangelical Christians, I am aware of what they regard as their somewhat embattled status.  Since the 1960's our country has changed quite a bit.  As a child attending a public elementary school the symbols of religion were still very much in evidence.  We led our own grace at the school lunch table--although at a ridiculously rapid staccato pace that was anything but reverent!  We participated in the school Christmas pageant that celebrated the birth of Christ.  In our homes, TV shows and comedians did not mock religious values.  The news did not feature college students protesting conservative views.  In a little county town like the one in which I grew up, most people were white Protestants, with only a few blacks living within a carefully prescribed zone.  In retrospect, I suppose that this seemed like a safe and well-ordered world to even the most strident white Protestants.  Now, however, religious symbols have been largely forced outside of public spaces.  The media, once tightly controlled, is now full of all kinds of things, some of which are openly hostile to traditional Protestant values.  People from other racial and cultural backgrounds are now part of a rapidly changing national demographic profile.  These changes can only add to a feeling of isolation that drives many evangelicals father to the religious fringe.<br /><br />It seems to me that advancing the argument, that Abrahamic religious should be completely abandoned, may not best way to deal with fanatical evangelicals.  Perhaps I should note at this point that one of Harris' claims, that religious fanatics have as complete an understanding of their religious scriptures as anyone, is incorrect.  While still a religious teenager I embarked on my own complete reading of the Bible.

Accordingly, sensible religious people search for such things as central themes and historical trends in the books of Bible instead of embarking on a paranoid justification of its many inconsistencies.  For me, I was struck by the difference between Jesus' generally compassionate observations in the Gospels and the extremely hostile remarks often found in the Old Testament.<br /><br />These differences may be due to the nature of Hellenic Christianity as advanced by Saint Paul and the authors of the Gospels--essentially an attempt to seek a middle ground between the stridently nationalistic version of Palestine-based messianism and one which is able coexist with Roman authority.

0060888695|5.0|This is the perfect match of voice and text. The first-person story narration, plus Spacek's light Southern accent and marvelous acting skill, makes you feel as if a grown-up Scout is telling you her story. A wonderful listening experience -- highly recommended!
B0025KVLU6|5.0|I hoped not to love the Beatles remasters, since it's obscene to have to buy these CD's twice to get the best possible sound.  These all live up to the hype-just incredible clarity. I'd have to compare the sound of the white album to any jazz CD I've heard, including audiophile labels like Telarc. Why weren't they mastered like this the FIRST TIME? Still one more complaint, why don't the earlier discs include both stereo and monaural versions-there is plenty of megabytage. But still, WOW!
B003JSSPSY|5.0|When this show first started on television I was ecstatic because I've read all the books.  At the beginning I was a bit disappointed because the characters didn't fit the way I had envisioned them to be due to the books.  Therefore, I left it for awhile and hadn't watched a few episodes.  Lo and behold, I decided to give it another try and boy was I glad I did.  There's everything in this show one could possibly want, friendship, comraderie, morals, respect, action, humor, strength, honor, love, philosophy, choice, evil, monsters, you name it, it's got it.  Not to mention of course the amazing scenery, costumes, visualizations, oops, I just did.  The second season left me no recourse but to make sure I never missed another episode again.      Now I can't believe that there may not be a third season.  This is by far my favorite show.  There's never anything good on television fantasy-wise and I'm so bored with all the vampire shows.  Please, PLEASE, if you're reading this ABC Disney, don't let us down by canceling this show and its characters that a lot of us have come to know and love.

B001USHRCK|5.0|I only bought it recently from Lego and I really enjoy looking at the details and marvel at the whole construction from every angle. The minifigs, the animals, the food etc are all rare pieces. The ability to fold the houses makes it compact and even portable. The colours are fabulously vibrant and cheerful. Architectural details of a Medival style is impressively detailed by using bricks, which itself is ingenius. I love Lego and own a good number of sets. This is one of my favourites and is the best til date. I've ordered the Architecture series through Amazon and will post my reviews here too soon. Hope they don't disappoint me!

B002HJ9PTO|1.0|This particular lavalier mic is not the quality of the older models by Audio-Technica; it has a slight hissing noise in the background and doesn't pick the audio up well.  We are hooking this mic up to a JVC GZ-HD6 HiDef camcorder and dismissed this problem as being the camera because we troubleshooted and hooked a traditional mic up to it and it worked fine.  Even when the footage is brought into editing, we turn the audio up and you get more static than talking.<br /><br />We are beginners when it comes to video production, but even we wouldn't count on this mic to do the job-especially since we've used other mics and know what quality exists. We are now looking to just go with wireless mics.

B002ZRPQ5K|4.0|\\"Night Train\\" is an 8 track EP by UK trio Keane and finds them continuing along the experimental path their last album \\"Perfect Symetry\\" took them.<br /><br />\\"House lights\\" is a brief instrumental with electronic flourishes, followed by the catchy upbeat \\"Back in time\\". The lads worked with Somali/Canadian rapper K'naan resulting in \\"Stop for a minute\\" (which sounds like a Coldplay/Jay-Z collaboration), and the absolutely lovely \\"Looking back\\" (with a triumphant horn section, it samples the \\"Rocky\\" theme).<br /><br />\\"Clear skies\\" is clap-filled guitar Pop, \\"Ishin denshin (You've got to help yourself)\\" is upbeat synth Pop featuring the vocals of Japanese artist Tigarah in the verses, while the synth driven \\"Your love\\" wouldn't sound out of place on a New Order or Depeche Mode album. It features a rare vocal performance from Tim Rice-Oxley. Closing is \\"My shadow\\", a classic Keane piano ballad with yearning choir boy vocals that swells to Stadium-esque proportions.<br /><br />Some will hate that there is less piano Pop, more synths and even rap these days in Keane's sound and that's perfectly fine, but those willing to let an act experiment or evolve will enjoy the ride. My only complaint is it's all over too soon, but it is after all an EP.
0375842209|5.0|The message I take from this book is how people with so little in their lives and facing hardships endure and carry on.  They do more that just survive; they live their lives and find happiness in the most important thing: the beauty hidden in the people around them.    Yes, the introduction in the beginning of the book is a little odd.  But hang on because the gem of this book is what is found in between in the description of the daily rhythms of lives in wartime Germany.  It provides one with a different perspective on growing up in Germany during WWII.    I highly recommend this book to teenagers and adults alike.
B0035WTE2U|3.0|I've never been a huge fan of AC/DC, and seeing a selection of some of the band's most well-known songs re-packaged as a soundtrack to Iron Man 2 may come off as being little more than a quick cash-in for all parties involved, but for newbie listeners to the band, the Iron Man 2 soundtrack is a worthwhile enough endeavor.  The Iron Man 2 soundtrack features such AC/DC staples as \\"T.N.T.\\", \\"Back in Black\\", \\"Shoot to Thrill\\", \\"Highway to Hell\\", and more besides, along with a bonus DVD and booklet featuring band pics and stills from the Iron Man 2 movie.  All things considered, there is nothing here that any fan of AC/DC hasn't seen plenty of times before, and won't see plenty more further on down the road.  Still, for new or young listeners to the band wondering just what is this long-lasting thing called AC/DC, the Iron Man 2 soundtrack is a worthwhile enough endeavor as a compilation piece to set them in the right direction of discovering the rest of the band's catalogue.  For everyone else who has enjoyed these tracks time and time again though, the Iron Man 2 soundtrack is practically worthless.
B003405MF6|5.0|I have been a Jeff Beck fan for quite some time. So I am happy that he is still interested in doing anything at all. This disc is another example of why he is in the Rock &Roll hall of fame. At first I thought it was a rather slow disc, but then the more I listened to it, the more it grew on me. He is so magical to listen to. If you have the chance, take in his recent tour... we are not geting any younger.

B002QQ8HAG|3.0|The success of television shows devoted to fashion and of websites that follow the runways is ample proof that when it comes to our appetite for fashion, more is more. The handicap that this documentary faces is that we think we know more than we do. Take Anna Wintour, who was so memorably caricatured by Meryl Streep in \\"The Devil Wears Prada.\\" Anyone would probably pale in comparison to a fictionalized representation of herself by Meryl Streep, so if Wintour emerges from this film as less interesting than you had assumed, it's not her fault.    It may be the fault of the director, however. Surely the world that Ms. Wintour orchestrates is a complicated place, and everyone on screen agrees that Wintour's influence is far-reaching. But no one, least of all the director, seems to be able to say precisely why. Instead, R.J. Cutler's direction gives us redundant shots of Wintour at runway shows or studios (always with dark glasses, which begs the question of whether she can actually see what she is supposed to evaluate) or of her capriciously nixing shots that her staff has spent many hours - and even more dollars - to create. There are a few scenes where we think we will get a glimpse of her fabled powerbrokering (a meeting with the head of Neiman Marcus, for instance), but even then we see few specifics. At times Wintour speaks directly to the camera, revealing, among other things, her siblings' dismissal of what she does professionally, but these moments don't cast her in a particularly sympathetic light. Even her daughter says on screen that she cannot take the industry seriously, and nothing about what Wintour says or is shown to do makes a compelling case for why her daughter - or we - should think otherwise. The film takes as a given the premise that fashion is important and that Wintour is its most important person. Lovers of fashion will go along with the premise, but even they might be troubled that time and again people in the film - Wintour included - betraya fear that fashion is viewed only as a guilty pleasure for stupid people. Wintour's decision to begin putting celebrities on the cover of Vogue is mentioned as a concrete example of her genius (she understood early where our fixation with celebrity in this country was headed), but even that \\"achievement\\" is undercut in the film by the sad photoshoot of Sienna Miller.    Ironically, the real heroine of this documentary's story is someone who at first glance does not embody high fashion: Grace Coddington. Ms. Coddington is Vogue's creative director, and her wrinkled face, frizzy hair, and plain black clothing belie her importance in a world that is celebrated for being skin-deep. Through the story Cutler shows us, however, Coddington is revealed as the long-standing source of the magazine's best material. She works tirelessly at the photo shoots she oversees, explaining to those around her the choices behind the textures of the fabrics or the concept of the lighting. Her visions are cohesive and gorgeous, but most importantly, they are intelligently articulated. Under Cutler's direction, the camera lingers over Coddington's tired face and the beautiful images of fashion that she creates, letting us see a highly creative mind at work. That she puts such thought into photographs that are so often blithely thrown out by Wintour (without good explanation as to why, at least on screen) makes her all the more sympathetic. Cutler, perhaps unknowingly, sets her up as everything that Wintour is not, and the comparison is not kind to Wintour. Where Coddington explains her vision and justifies her artistic choices, Wintour simply pronounces her final judgements. Coddington is kind to the models, bringing them treats and asking whether their outfits are too tight, while Wintour jokes about people's weight and demands that fat be photoshopped (even on non-models). Coddington seems to care deeply about the clothing and its details, especially at the couture shoots in France, whereas Wintour often just looks bored. Cutler peels away at the many levels of Coddington, letting the viewer know only gradually that she herself was once a model on the pages of Vogue, and that she suffered a disfiguring accident that required facial plastic surgery. Her story is far more interesting than Wintour's, but that's probably because it is told better.    Ultimately it is Grace Coddington who emerges in this film as the \\"author\\" of Vogue, the creator of the very things that readers love most. The \\"inside\\" look at Anna Wintour and her control of the magazine sticks to the surface of its supposed primary subjects, and while a focus on the surface of things may be fine for the business of fashion, it won't do for documentary filmmaking. Where the film does triumph, however, is its showcasing of Coddington, who quietly, stubbornly, and convincingly makes the case for fashion as art.

0440243688|4.0|Jack Reacher witnesses a suicide by a young lady on a subway train. Curious as to the cause, he unveils a complicated plot of world terrorists seeking to retrieve a photograph of Bin Laden. Included in the photograph is an older shot of a current politician running for public office. Using a combination of intellect and raw power, Reacher investigates, punches out several people, runs from the NYPD, the FBI, the DoD, and the terrorists. The end of the book has him shooting, knifing, kicking, and ending the evil. It is a fun but violent roller-coaster ride guaranteed to keep the pages turning.     The political overtones with regard to Bin Laden and Al Queda give the book a global feel in spite of the localized action--most of it takes place in New York City. The story zips along as Reacher tries to avoid but at times confronts his many adversaries including the terrorists and local law enforcement. Probably the most fascinating dialogs occur with the politician Sansom who obviously has strong character traits and is committed to high morals while attempting to get elected. It makes for a healthy personal tension. Often books of this nature point to the imperialist politician as being the impetus for the negative events, yet in Gone Tomorrow, the politician is trying to set the record straight and help Reacher achieve his goals.     As stated in earlier views, I have often wished for more solutions to the problems than just punching and shooting, but in this story the violence was choreographed from the beginning and found myself cheering for Reacher's success. Accurate descriptions, characterizations, and clear distinctions make for a fun ride as Reacher saves the day. The super-hero stuff in the hands of a lesser writer would be rather elementary, but for experienced writer Lee Child, it works.

B002WY65W4|4.0|The two girls in the movie believe that there's a safe place in the USA where no zombies can get into.  This syndrome is one that attends all survivors of the apocalypse, and Woody Harrelson notes that people in the west think the safe place is in the East, and the easterners think it's in the west.  Didn't this happen in The Stand?  I know it happened it Stephen King's later novel Cell.  The two girls believe that the safe haven is at Pacific Playland, a Disneylike theme park that just so happens to be their favorite place anyway, so they spend the whole movie trying to get there.  The older girl, Emma Stone, must be so happy now that Lindsay Lohan's in the doghouse, because this is exactly the kind of part Lindsay L used to play all the time, in fact they didn't even bother re-styling Emma Stone, just used some of Lindsay's old wigs and eye makeup and bronzer on her.<br /><br />Zombieland is the story of their journey, and of the interesting guys they meet along the way....  Woody Harrelson plays Tallahassee, a mountain man survivalist who loves him his big guns and his Twinkies.  Jesse Eisenberg plays Columbus (this conceit of calling the characters by the names of cities is pretty tiresome), pretty much the same Aaron Kuninesque part he played in Adventureland with Kristen Stewart, and as everyone has noted, the two movies are both laid in amusement parts as if to signify--what?  Actually Zombieland keeps up a lot of energy only to lose it all bigtime when the girls hit Pacific Playland.  And the third man they encounter on their travels is--well, that's spoiler territory and it's funnier if you don't know who it is, which is the way we encountered it.  But many will know anyhow that one of the world's top stars takes a very unlikely part in this movie.  I liked it but later I thought, uh, what's the point of the movie, that everyone's against white people who need to \\"nut up or shut up\\"?
B0039SFKSW|5.0|In my review for 2008's &#34;Phoenix&#34; I opined that cd was &#34;what a 3rd album would have sounded back in 1984&#34;.<br /><br />This contribution however was what the 2nd album SHOULD have sounded like way back in 1983, the year of &#34;Alpha&#34;.<br /><br />Much in the way that &#34;Never Again&#34; kicked off &#34;Phoenix&#34; with a rocking start, &#34;Finger On The Trigger&#34;-originally recorded by Wetton and Downes with Icon-benefits tremendously from Carl Palmer's powerhouse drumming and Steve Howe's jazz-rock electric guitar stylings.<br /><br />&#34;Through My Veins&#34; signals the first collaboration between Steve Howe and John Wetton in nearly 30 years. A powerful and moody piece much akin to &#34;Wish I'd Known All Along&#34; from &#34;Phoenix&#34;.<br /><br />&#34;Holy War&#34; is an amazingly powerful piece that again showcases Steve's guitar and gives Carl Palmer his supreme moment on the album.<br /><br />&#34;Ever Yours&#34; is the album's requisite ballad. &#34;Emily&#34; a bonus track is the only chink in the armor. this one was better left on the shelf, although not bad enough to kill the rest of the cd.<br /><br />&#34;Light the Way&#34; is about Steve's guitars; steel and electric. Both superb.<br /><br />&#34;End of the World&#34; is another outstanding group performance from start to finish, and the ending sequence where it changes from major to minor for the coda is reminiscent of GTR's &#34;The Hunter&#34;, which was a Geoff Downes composition, and also featured Steve Howe on guitar.<br /><br />&#34;There Was a Time&#34; stars with Portuguese 12-string and piano in a dark 2/4 time. Carl comes in midway and the tune rocks the rest of the way out. Superb vocal from Wetton.<br /><br />&#34;I'm Still The Same&#34; is pure pop, in almost a Beatles mode...<br /><br />&#34;Don't Wanna Lose You Now&#34; is stronger than &#34;Emily&#34;, but not so strong as the rest of the album. I wouldn't have ended the album with it as they did.<br /><br />&#34;I Believe&#34; is a triumphant anthem, along the lines of &#34;Phoenix's&#34; &#34;An Extraordinary Life&#34;, and would have made a wonderful album closer.<br /><br />If you were to swap &#34;Emily&#34; and &#34;Don't Wanna Lose You Now&#34; with &#34;Midnight Sun&#34; and &#34;Open Your Eyes&#34; from &#34;Alpha&#34;, you'd have an album as strong as the first, but considering the fact that so many gave up on Asia years ago, the fact that they can still produce work of this quality shows the enduring talents of these four rock legends. 5 stars.<br /><br />There is a Japan-only CD of &#34;Omega&#34; which features an excellent blues-rock style track entitled &#34;Drop A Stone&#34; as the bonus track instead of &#34;Emily&#34;.  I would rate this track among Asia's best and am slightly upset that this track is only available on the Japanese release.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this a long time ago and let me tell it has really helped me lose weight. I wanted to give a few pointers that have helped me get more from this DVD. First of all memorize the routines and use your own music. This makes it so much more enjoyable.  On my Itunes playlist you can make a new list of music everyday I usually just skip to the new song when I finish a circuit somewhat keeping the music to the exercise, medium pace strength, fast cardio, slower abs. Next when I decided to move to level 2 I did it once the first week, twice the second and so on. 3rd for variety you can alternate the levels, but add things to the ones you have \\"mastered\\" When I got pretty good at level 2 I started go back and alternating with level 1, add wrist and ankle weights. On the chest flies lift one or both legs as you do them. Lift one leg off the ground for the push ups. That way you are having variety but still keeping up the intensity.  I have 4 of Jillians non-BL DVDs and the power sculpting one and I have lost almost 50 lbs. I am 47 years old and have had 10 children and currently weigh 121! But more importantly I FEEL terrific!
B000U0F7RG|4.0|I had never seen the show when it was on TV but had read good reviews regarding the show and the actors and heard the writing was top notch. The only thing that kept me away so long was it was called \\"Gilmore Girl,\\" which was a deterrent but I was caught surprised at how special this show is. Sure it is about the Gilmore Girls but it's also about everyone in the pleasant town called Stars Hollow. The ensemble is top notch, especially Lauren Graham and the dialogue is top notch. So we started watching the entire series and are on season 3 now.<br />I would definitely recommend this for Mothers and their Daughters but also families because it is about the family unit and the relationships within the family.<br />Give it a try. I don't think you will be sorry.

He puts a lot of effort into what he does and he doesn't deserve to be judged like an adult for acting his age.
B003BKF696|5.0|When the National announced High Violet earlier this year, the only logical response was to become rabidly excited over the next album from one of the best bands of the decade. After growing some quiet acclaim in their early years, the National took the indie music world by storm, unleashing two genius albums in the span of two years, touring unendingly around the globe, and basically being the barn-burning rock band they've aspired to all this time. Between the carefully crafted performances and Matt's bottle of wine, their live show has become somewhat legendary, and the legend is sure to only become greater as they start touring in earnest for High Violet.<br /><br />Which brings us to the music. High Violet is probably the best album the National have put out, and that's saying a lot given how excellent Alligator and Boxer were. The reason that I feel like High Violet may be a better record overall is because both of those aforementioned albums suffer from passages of weak songwriting, i.e. the end of Boxer and the middle of Alligator. High Violet has not discernible weak points, exhibiting tight songwriting from front to back. Highlights for me include Sorrow, Afraid of Everyone, Bloodbuzz Ohio, and Lemonworld, all of which exhibit the sound of a band on the verge of an emotional collapse, but always pulled just back from the brink, giving them a chance to approach it again from a different angle. If you thought Alligator and Boxer were angst-ridden and brooding, you'll be in for a surprise when you hear the dark undulations underneath the surface of High Violet's tight arrangements. Truly, a record perfect for a year as singular as 2010, one of the best music years in a long time.

Really, the only things I would add are the ability to use rechargeables that would charge in-unit (i.e. charge the cameras, charge the flash); the ability to run off the camera's power if the battery is dead (but that might be a limitation of the camera that precludes such a feature); and the ability to at least rotate 90 degrees so you could bounce when taking a picture in the portrait position (you can of course bounce off a wall, but the results are, well, unpredictable).  Results out to 15 feet are outstanding, out to 30 feet not bad, and its integration with Nikon DSLR's logic is incredible. I remember the Canon AE-1 (dating myself here), the world's first \\"automatic\\" camera with TTL metering, and how exciting it was when \\"automatic\\" flashes appeared as accessories. Well, \\"semi-automatic,\\" as they still required dialing in numbers. I don't know how, but between the Nikon and this flash, they figure everything out together. You set your desired brightness as if you were dialing in an index number (assuming you want to even bother doing that much), the duo figure out how far away the target is, and adjusts everything accordingly. The instructions warn that they don't promise consistent results when bouncing - and you will bounce, that's the whole point of such a flash (no more red-eye, ever!) - but to be honest we've had nothing but excellent results even bouncing off high ceilings. The unit even powers down when you turn off the camera so you don't waste batteries. You won't do continuous shooting but you'll get a shot every five seconds or better with fresh batteries.    One thing I was concerned about was lens shadow - we have the zoom autostabilizing lens and it causes a shadow when using the the pop-up flash at all but one zoom level. Not a problem at all. If you use the autostabilizer or one of the longer focal length zooms with a lens hood then you might have issues. Of course, if you're bouncing, then by definition the problem goes away.    One last beef, which is not a limitation of the flash but rather then D40 camera, is that the camera's software does not check if an external flash is attached when you hit the popup button, so it is possible to deploy the popup which then smacks into the external. I'm not sure what happens if you were to try to take a picture with both flashes up and on - it would be great if they actually all synched together, but since the D40 pop-up is not able to fully deploy with this flash sitting on top, I seriously doubt it.

B001OST0LW|5.0|Some have called me the number one Batman fan in the world since I used to publish a Batman \\"fanzine\\" back in the 70's and 80's.  I was a fan long before the Batcraze of even the Adam West era.  Of all the Batman movies produced so far, this one more clearly defines the persona of the Caped Crusader, save the movie serials from the 1940's.  And while it does deviate from the history of the character, it does present itself as being able to stand upon it's own merits.  Needless to say, I am not too happy with \\"artistic license\\" that promotes profit over accuracy.  Still an enjoyable movie.
B0034GK7DM|4.0|If you love sweet harmony and the soulful sounds of fiddle and steel .. then this CD is for you.   Very old-fashioned song-writer style country music .. with out all the electronics and gadgets  in top-40 country today, these songs are pleasant and bright with youthful country spirit. My   favorite thing about the recording is the vocals. Easton has a great voice and the backing harmonies  hit you on every song. Great production and superb musicians abound! Every fill is tastier than the next.

B0030Y11XS|2.0|I put off watching this DVD until last weekend because I wanted to wait for it to come out on DVD.<br /><br />As far as documentary making goes this film it is an incoherent mess.  To be fair, Moore has never been a top drawer documentary film maker -he never claimed to be one.  I cut him a lot of slack most of the time because some of his stuff is entertaining, but this one is especially sloppy.  I think his hate for the America we now have resulted in some poor decision making.  While I agree with his dislike of the America we have become, my discomfort comes from a very different place.  Most annoying is the silly charge upon GM head quarters and the cartoonish antics like the crime tape stuff.  Enough already.<br /><br />Ultimately Moore's unsupported thesis is that socialism provides a more democratic and fair economic system and that the European model of a government controlled economic, medical, and social security system should be adopted in the US.<br /><br />Oddly enough, as if to present balance, he has his actor friend Wallace Shawn at the beginning the film describe why a classic economic reading of free market capitalism is superior (not a panacea mind you) to socialism.  In short, a free capitalist market is the most efficient and democratic way to determine demand for goods and services --not a government bureaucracy which leads to waste, corruption, inequity, and in many cases throughout history, genocide.  I appreciated that concise few minutes of the film even if it was only offered as a nod to fair documentary journalism.  Unfortunately Moore never returns to the theory and its clear validation through the American experience.<br /><br />All Moore proceeds to do for the next ninety minutes is claim capitalism is evil by illustrating the seemingly endless collusion of corrupt government officials and corporate CEOs.  The basic tenant of Moore's argument (and all pro-socialists) is that free market capitalism is a zero sum game i.e. for every winner there is a loser.  That is simply not true and a great myth perpetrated by all socialists in an effort to support their beliefs.  All of Moore's \\"zero sum\\" examples illustrated problems associated with big government, political corruption, and theft among the elite.  He offered ZERO proof that capitalism or free markets are the problem.  It becomes painfully clear very early on in the film that Michael Moore (as many reviews on this thread also demonstrate just reading their reviews) has no idea what free market capitalism IS!<br /><br />In a cloud of ignorance so thick you can smell the stink, Michael Moore spends most of the film telling us all what we already know: that big government programs like the trillion dollar TARP bailout of big corporations was evil...Gee Michael, NO KIDDING!!  But the corrupt tentacles that connect the US Treasury to Goldman Sachs and all over Congress have nothing to do with capitalism or free markets.  It is called cronyism and corruption -things birthed naturally from big government!<br /><br />In the end, Michael Moore fails to produce one single piece of evidence to prove that free market capitalism is the evil he wants it to be.  If Moore had refocused his effort on the real evil (big government) and re-titled his documentary then he would have been taken more seriously.  Unfortunately all Moore can do in the end is prop up a dusty old socialist democrat Bernie Sanders and extol him as the man with the answers to all of our problems.  Moore goes further down the rabbit hole and laments the death of high paying union jobs and benefits.  He then puts the cherry on top of the socialist soda with the \\"hero of the stupid,\\" FDR, as his proof that democratic socialism works.  Are you kidding me?  FDR and LBJ created the welfare state.  Social Security and Medicare are massive Ponzi failures for everyone except a few early recipients who paid little and are getting great returns.  Future generations will get NOTHING.  We are now paying severely for these and other welfare policies by way of misinterpretation of Article I, Section 8, Clause 1 of the United States Constitution, AKA the General welfare clause.  BTW, just for the record, every modern Republican president has failed to address these issues as well -proving that all politicians are just one party united by corruption driven to steal from you and me in an effort to eliminate rights and liberties and enrich themselves.<br /><br />Like any high school dropout filmmaker, Moore lacks the critical thinking skills necessary to put together a truly interesting documentary.  He offers only false cause and effect fallacies and one side of the low hanging fruit known as emotional arguments.  He provides absolutely no analysis of the killing machine he so wants to emulate --the massive unemployment and unsustainable debt in socialist Europe, the inhumane living conditions, practices, and policies of communist Cuba and Venezuela, and of course the natural extension of Soviet and Chinese communism that produced mass genocide.  At one point Moore limply holds up Japan as an example of a well oiled government/private symbiosis.  Oooppps, wrong again Michael.  Japan has been in a massive recession since the late nineties and their government pension system is failing faster than ours.<br /><br />Sorry Michael, free market capitalism may have a few problems and may need a little tweaking here and there, but it is by far the most advancing, egalitarian, and humane economic system ever tried.  Lastly, let's just look at the facts: the countries with the freest markets are the most advanced.  Countries with the least free markets are third world countries.<br /><br />Bottom line: Michael Moore has failed to make a documentary that any thinking person can take seriously.  Moore offers no new model or new ideas, just a retread of old silly socialist myths.  This film is an obtuse mosaic that fails to make any real point other than government corruption is everywhere.  For that you need only to read the newspaper every day.  Two stars only for the kernel of truth Moore stumbled upon but didn't develop.

0142410705|4.0|I read [[ASIN:B001LO54Y6 Paper Towns]] by Green and absolutely loved it.  So, I decided to read his previous books as well.  This was a great coming-of-age/road trip story that was quirky and entertaining.  A highly recommended read.  I did like Paper Towns a bit better than this book, but this book was still a great read.<br /><br />Colin is a child prodigy; he learned to read at an incredibly early age, knows a magnitude of strange random facts, and is constantly anagramming in his head.  He also has a quirky thing for Katherines; he has dated 19 of them and been dumped by them all.  After being dumped by Katherine 19 he has fallen into a funk; his buddy Hassan decides what Colin needs is a road trip.  So off they go on a road trip.  Colin is determined to use the time on the road to develop a mathematical theorem that will predict how long a relationship will last.<br /><br />This was a fun read.  Full of interesting footnotes and quirky mathematical equations; as well as interesting characters.  All of the characters are exceedingly well done.  Green's writing is superb.  He does a great job of putting a lot of interesting facts, a lot of quirkiness, great humor, and some coming of age lessons into this interesting read.<br /><br />The book was very engaging; I never got bored.  I liked all the funny facts that Colin knew, I also enjoyed Colin's struggle to work through the mathematics to predict the relationship equation.<br /><br />There wasn't much that I didn't like about this book.  But I did like Green's book Paper Towns better than this one, I think it is mainly the characters that make the difference.  This book isn't quite as adventurous or mysterious as Paper Towns was.  I never really liked Colin all that much, he was a bit self-centered...that made a difference in how I liked the book overall.<br /><br />Overall this was a great read.  I didn't like it as much as [[ASIN:B001LO54Y6 Paper Towns]] but it was close.  I look forward to reading the only John Green book I haven't read yet \\"[[ASIN:B002N2XI2U Looking for Alaska]]\\".:B002N2XI2U Looking for Alaska]]\\".
B002N8A14M|4.0|This nano 5g cover is exactly what i was looking for.  I wanted a cover that would clip onto my clothes as well as be used as an armband.  I bought one initially at the apple store but it had a plastic cover going over the wheel making it very very difficult to use, so I returned it and after seeing positive reviews ordered this one.  It's just about perfect. It looks nice, it protects the ipod, it has the clip and the armband, and it fits into my ipod radio with the case on-- as long as I don't put the piece on the dock that makes it fit the nano perfectly.  My ONLY complaint is that the case scratches very easily.  Just a few times placed in my purse and there were several scratches.  BUT I solved the problem by storing it inside one of my son's little socks, and now it's perfect.  I'm very happy :D
B00004XQ83|5.0|This CD is a great addition to the movie.  As you listen to the songs, you can picture what is going on.
B001PU8N0I|4.0|As with \\"Bleak House\\" this is a wonderful production with wonderful acting and evocative theme music. But then, why am I not giving it five stars rather than giving it 4 starts? I think the problem is with the book \\"Little Dorrit\\" itself - as a drama it has nothing like the quality of Bleak House - the book is a book of 2 halves which fit together somewhat akwardly i.e the pre and post incarceration period for the Dorrits.     No matter how good a production is, its very difficult to cure a problem which is a problem with the book itself. There are some parts of the story which are too bizarre to be beleivable - the murdering frenchman, for example, is not really believable and I felt uncomfortable with the ending (the House of Clenham angle) - obviously it was delightful that Clenham and Little Dorrit get it together. So, what I am saying is that the book has too many problems and I don't think without being unfaithful to the book, that these problems can be ironed out by any production. Thus, whilst I greeted each Bleak House episode with real interest and joy, I was happy to merely watch Little Dorrit on and off i.e. I was not driven to watching it whereas I was with Bleak House.

0790732254|1.0|Some bad movies like Operation Eichmann have a certain campiness that makes them almost fun to watch.  This movie has no such redeeming virtue.  It is not just bad, it is bad in an arty, pseudo-intellectual phony sort of way.  Granted the acting is good, given the circumstances. It goes on and on like a hangover or a bad joke with no humor or punch line. The characters are repulsive and obnoxious. Did I mention boring? You feel the author is admiring his own pointless dialogue and certain audiences may find it profound because they think there is something they ought to be getting. There is not. SPOILER. You find out at the end the couple are fighting about a non-existent child they never had. At the conclusion the child is verbally \\"killed\\" so that the marriage can live. Who cares if the miserable marriage lives?  Do yourself a favor and have a root canal instead of watching this movie.

0780020685|5.0|Best Japanese movie I have seen so far. A great work done by Kurosawa in 1954.    The plot is about a village got information for a group of bandits were coming for their crops. To survive, they decided to fight the bandits instead of giving them the crops. To do this, they attempt to hire samurais. But they basically cannot afford. However, a group of 7 samurais (or 6+1 fake one - Kikuchiyo), were impressed by the peasants' braveness and receive the contract for almost no pay (a bowl of while rice). Finally they defeated the bandit but 4 of 7 samurais died.    To enjoy this film, you do not need any understanding on Japanese culture because this film does not really have a correct setting of it. For example, To express the conflict between the samurai class and the peasant class, Kurosawa made those two classes into two absolutely independent societies, samurai cannot live, work or fall in love with a peasant and a peasant can never become a samurai. This is not true in the real Japanese history, because at the time this story took place, the leader of the country, Toyotomi Hideyoshi  is originally a peasant. But according to this feature of the film, it is easier to let audience impressed by the information that the director was trying to let us know--heroism, friendship and love.    Something bad about this movie:   Everything is long--the intro, including the staff list, and of course the whole movie(over 200min), some scenes are waste of time. But this is not a big deal because you could fast forward on your DVD.   The battle sense is kind of stupid, by making all the bandits stupid--a bunch of guys only rush into spears and blades and getting killed, make this part of movie not so interesting.

0691126658|4.0|Because it is so comprehensive, the book is very useful for birdwatching in these central African countries; because it is so comprehensive it is both heavy to carry and less useful for picturing variants in a local area.

An excellent basic text, and well worth carrying, especially if traveling by jeep. Don't leave home without it!

B00275EGWY|1.0|One of the most boring, uninspiring and poor movies I have seen in a long time. This is the typical \\"Hollywood rewarding its own\\". The subject of Irak is sentitive to most US citizens but this is not sufficient reason to give an award to a movie that has no real plot, is repetitive, lacks good acting and falls into a trap from the start. I never leave a movie theater no mater how bad the film but in this case I almost made an exception and asked for my money back.

1567184855|5.0|Is there anything more important that knowing the meaning of life?<br /><br />Michael Newton is bravely going where no man has gone before.  Sure, there have been people who have written books about their Near Death Experiences.  Sure there are mediums, clairvoyants, psychics and prophets, but while they all tell us what it's like to die, maybe that we have multiple lives, but no one has ever told us what souls do in between their lives.  How do we choose our next life? Why do we pick certain parents? Countries? Hair color?<br /><br />Well maybe some ancient peoples might have given us a clue their writings, but mostly we can't read them any more, so here is a look at 'heaven' as told to a trained man of science by the superconsicous of his patients.  I have never been so blown away in my life.<br /><br />Through Newton's work with regressing normal people, not abductees, not people who have died, not people who have a 'gift', but regular Joes who can speak the unspeakable while in a hypnotic trance. Now as a trained hypnotherapist, I know that a trance is nothing more than putting aside your conscious mind and going into the imagination, which is the rehearsal room of our mind(think Holodeck, Trekies).  We all do this while watching t.v., driving or anything that bores our ego into submission.  This is the principal of the Native American's Vision Quest.  Drive yourself hard enough and you can get past the gate-keeper into your higher self where all the answers to the questions lie.<br /><br />Newton's work is so groundbreaking that I'm surprised he found a publisher.  Tapping into the soul to ask it questions such as what's our real purpose here as human beings is . . . well, I'm stunned.  I've read and reread all of Newton's books and will probably keep doing so until I can do the same work myself.  Buy this book and know the meaning of your life.  Is anything more important?<br /><br />[[ASIN:1608605809 When I Dream]]

0307588335|3.0|The book describes the events that led to the Lehman fall. It is a good source from someone who worked at Lehman. During the climax of the crunch, the author described the events from third parties point of view. The book gives some idea of the activity in a trading floor, the kind of detachment between business areas, the weakness of Risk Management, etc. The credit crunch has a lot of points of view, it is one of them.

As we are nearing the end of this season, it is he who is rapidly outflanking just about everyone.  Meanwhile, Walt is in chaos as Hank lies in critical condition in the hospital.  As usual, he is pulled in all directions at once and can barely keep his nose above the water line. There is a great scene in the hospital where one of these terminator types recognizes Walt and, in a state of instant hatred, crawls on his stumps to try and reach Walt at the hospital door, making big blood patches with each motion forward.  This scares Walt to death. Just terrific stuff.

While I am not a fan of sequels, the book left me wanting more and wondering where some the characters journeyed next.  Bravo!
B001PJRAUS|4.0|For hardcore Jane Austen fans this version will be a travesty because of the many twist and turns they take with P&P but if you are to look at it for what it is (another adaptation of a classic) it is good clean fun. Jemima Rooper is just magnificent as the quintessential Jane Austen aficionado who gets to be the heroine in her favorite story something many of us would love to do I am sure. Mr. Darcy is just magnificent and his character is played the same way it has been played since Laurence Olivier did it in 1940 with his haughtiness and incomparable benediction. The only downside to an otherwise great version was that a very funny scene in which Jemima sings \\"Downtown\\" has been cut and leaves the viewer scratching its head because of the conversation followed right after. If you are like me and would like to own the uncut version the UK amazon site has it otherwise I advise many to buy this Dvd for they will have a grand time.
B000AADYRQ|2.0|There are strong points to this album. \\"I Will Follow You Into The Dark\\" is a beautiful, borderline insightful song. Now, if you're a Death Cab Fan who ENJOYED their rough edges, this album will not meet your expectations. Don't get me wrong, with tracks like \\"Summer Skin,\\" you'll quickly realize that Yes, DCFC is somewhere in this record.. but, it's so masked in the gloss of something else it's not as recognizable as you'd think. There's a lot more piano on this album than previous releases, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but something has changed in the songwriting. Lyrically, it's still the same Ben Gibbard/Chris Walla duo - clever and on the verge of dismal. You can see that in such tracks as \\"Brothers on a Hotel Bed\\" and \\"Marching Bands of Manhattan.\\"    I don't want to say that now that DCFC has gone to a major label, they suck. They're still the same band, and it's obvious.. but -something- has changed, and I absolutely don't recommend this album to the beginning fan. I ripped it on my computer and gave it away, in fact. Narrow Stairs, even more disappointing. I suppose it's because their initial appeal for me was the raw, lo-fi gritty sound, during the days of Barsuk  Records. Now, it could just be that Ben Gibbard is now married and obviously changed not only his borderline-emo lyric content, but the entire band's sound. I suppose that's a possibility. Or maybe I'm just not on the hype of Death Cab For Cutie and I want to hang onto You Can Play These Songs With Chords and We Have The Facts and We're Voting Yes. I first noticed this change in sound on Transatlanticism, where this \\"evolved sound\\" really shines. It almost feels like a thick glossy coat over their music, and it just works really well on that album. But as releases progress, it's almost like a stale cigarette smell starts to linger overhead.     I've met many who prefer Transatlanticism forward, but I myself do not. Plans isn't a terrible album, but it's in no means one of their best. I'malmost afraid to hear anything after Narrow Stairs.
B000EDWKXI|4.0|Heath Ledger is an AWESOME actor. Jeremy Irons did a mediocre job. Nevertheless, the movie is entertaining and funny. The ending is somewhat disappointing... (script & plot could definitely have been more polished )
1423113381|4.0|Having explored the trouble caused by Titans and Greek gods, Riordan has apparently turned his attention to a new pantheon -- Egyptian gods. \\"The Red Pyramid\\" is overlong in places, but Riordan's first Kane Chronicles novel is a rollicking adventure/fantasy filled with ancient deities (in modern forms), fireballs, hostile magicians, and a basketball-playing baboon.<br /><br />Ever since their mother died, the Kane kids have hardly seen one another. Carter travels the world with his Egyptologist father, while Sadie lives with their maternal grandparents in London. But when their father attempts a magic spell and is captured by the god Set, Carter and Sadie are temporarily whisked away by their uncle Amos -- and then found by a mysterious magical cabal called the House of Life.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the kids soon learn two things -- Set is planning to destroy the world in just a few days, and the House has decided that they must be killed. So they're on the run with the cat goddess Bast (formerly Sadie's cat Muffin), trying to find a way to stop an ancient god of chaos from killing their father and plunging the world into horror.They'll have to venture into ancient, unspeakable dangers, and discover a side of themselves that they never knew of... but even that might not restore Ma'at.<br /><br />On the surface, \\"The Red Pyramid\\" sounds a lot like Riordan's Percy Jackson series -- you've got disaffected teenagers trying to save the world from evil gods, and finding out they have some magic powers themselves. But it actually is a rather different story (there's no safe haven for these kids!), and the interwoven Egyptian myths and magic give it a very distinct flavor of its own.<br /><br />The one problem is that the plot feels a bit stretched out, with lots of action interspersed with long stretches of inaction. But the plot is also very complex and carefully laid out, with lots of miniquests woven into the main storyline, plenty of humor (\\"How to tame the five essential elements of the universe--earth, air, water, fire, and cheese!\\"), and lots of flashy glowy magic (floating hieroglyphics, halls filled with memories, axe-headed demons, shooting fireballs, clay shabti, et cetera).<br /><br />And his characters are well-drawn to start with, and are carefully fleshed out as the story goes on -- Carter is a likable, earnest young man who obviously wishes he had a bit of normalcy, while Sadie is a snarky, sassy girl with a fragile heart. Bast is also a wonderfully quirky, catlike character (\\"That's the spirit! Now, let's have a picnic\\"), while the gloomy Anubis and mad scientist Thoth make great supporting cast.<br /><br />\\"The Red Pyramid\\" rambles on at times, but Rick Riordan's latest is still a fantastical, magical journey that paves the way for a whole new series.

B002ZCDR88|5.0|Natalie Merchant has created a one-of-a-kind wonder of an album!  On first listen, I realized that Leave Your Sleep was something special, but after several listens, while reading along with the beautiful booklet of poems and poet summaries, I more fully appreciated the artistry of these songs and the remarkable achievement of this 26-song collection.  The diversity of musical styles is noteworthy in itself, but what most impresses is the inspired selection and use of those styles to bring to life the memorable little worlds of these poems and the unique cast of characters and tales of imagination.  As is the case with great popular music, it is the endearing melodies, stunning singing and playing, and creative arrangements that capture the listener and provide a source of endless listening pleasure.    After 35 years of collecting and listening to music of all genres, and with 2500 albums to compare to, I honestly believe Leave Your Sleep is an instant classic and belongs in the ranks of the greatest albums ever recorded.
0486474917|5.0|Everybody knows him -- the pipe-smoking detective on Baker Street (with or without the movie-added deerstalker), who is able to deduce all sorts of things just by glancing at a person. \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\" shows off Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's first collection of short stories involving Holmes, mingling human psychology with sometimes bizarre mysteries.<br /><br />Holmes is visited by the masked King of Bohemia, who has a slight problem: he's engaged to a princess, but his former lover Irene Adler has a compromising letter that could jeopardize his future marriage. But Adler has a formidable brain of her own. Then Holmes is hired by a man who was hired by the mysterious Red-Headed League, and given a strange job... which is somehow connected to a criminal undertaking.<br /><br />Among the other strange cases that Holmes and Watson undertake -- a missing fiance, a strange murder in Boscombe Valley, a dead man who was sent five orange seeds, a woman whose husband has utterly vanished, a blue jewel hidden in a Christmas turkey, a dead woman whose last words were \\"it was the band, the speckled band!\\", a young engineer given a dream job, an American heiress who vanishes directly after her wedding, a broken beryl coronet, and a young woman given a surreally weird job.<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes mysteries come in two types:<br />1. The case is completely baffling, and Holmes is needed to unravel the knot of obscure clues.<br />2. The case seems straightforward, but Holmes is needed to connect seemingly unrelated clues to the crime in order to find the REAL perpetrator.<br /><br />There are plenty of both kinds in \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,\\" with a dozen cases that require Holmes' unique detecting skills -- it can be something as simple as locating a letter, or something as complex as foiling a robbery or counterfeiting ring. Doyle's stately, dignified prose is heightened by moments of excitement or horror (\\" It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek\\"), and he wove in a lot of human psychology into Holmes' cases.<br /><br />Holmes himself... is Holmes. Doyle didn't like his detective much, but Sherlock's knife-edged intellect and fascination with puzzles are strangely hypnotic -- even if you wouldn't like to be roomies with the guy, it would be amazing just to sit and watch him work. Watson is the perfect counterpoint for Holmes: he's not a genius but is definitely intelligent, warm-hearted and capable.<br /><br />\\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\" is a magnificent collection of Holmes' first twelve short cases, filled with murder, intrigue and all sorts of weird crimes.

B000JQUMPI|5.0|Somehow I missied this classic growing up and only downloaded it as I was looking for something to read with substance that was free.  What a lovely tale.  Definitely on my list of alltime favorites.  I am now inspired to peruse more \\"great classics\\" I passed over in favor of NYT bestsellers in the past.  Thank you Amazon.
B0030AJXAA|5.0|This is Harrison's remix of his classic album & it works so well, especially when you get extras like the live version of \\"My Sweet Lord\\". It sounds great although I don't have the original to compare the mix to & I heard that so long ago I can't even remember when or where. If you are a fan you will love this material. If not & you are looking into the works of the greatest single band ever, this would be a fantastic way to do so. Even though the group broke out of the Beatles, they never stopped producing wonderful music.
B001AQTWF2|4.0|Noone loves Whit like I do... but...through all that her voice has been, it's just not  as strong and managable as it was.    This is a good project and one that gives her true fans hope that she still has it.    There are flashes of her former STUNNING GREATNESS but by and large she just can't do  with her voice what she once could.  She wants to but the pipes just won't do it anymore.    Her voice may very well never return to the pinnacle that earned her millions of dollars, millions of loyal fans, and a moniker that identified her as \\"THE VOICE\\".    Nevertheless.. for her fans you'll find solace in the fact that she still gives it  all she has... it's just that.... is that \\"all\\" still good enough.  I suppose only time  will further tell the story.  Right now.. take the moments of brilliance that you find in this project and savor them.

0439023491|5.0|\\"Catching Fire\\" is a rare case - a book where a sequel lives up to (and perhaps exceeds) the standard set by an excellent first book.<br /><br />The story picks up only a few months after \\"The Hunger Games\\" leaves off, and wastes little time before setting of at the same breakneck pace, in unexpected directions. Suzanne Collins has a talent for efficient, clever plotting with lots of twists and turns, and she shows a unique understanding of her characters through clever one-off lines and overall character development.<br /><br />She also displays a love of sharp, vivid imagery in her prose - one example is a chilling phrase from the early pages: \\"The smell of blood was on his breath...I imagine him sipping it from a teacup. Dipping a cookie into the stuff and pulling it out dripping red.\\" That one gave me the shivers for days.<br /><br />The result of all this fine craftsmanship is a clean knife-edge of a story, each chapter leaving this reader panting for the next one. Good luck finding a place to stop for a break (or to sleep) - once the story got going, I had a hard time putting the book down for anything.<br /><br />\\"Catching Fire\\" feels like a natural extension of the story begun in \\"The Hunger Games.\\" It could have ended at the first book, but I'm so glad it didn't. In these two books, Collins has sparked a fire and created a conflagration.<br /><br />Who knows where it could lead from here?
B00007FOMP|5.0|You just can't be a Marvin Gaye fan and not own this one!  This brother was soooo before his time.    Nobody has a voice like his. (....though Sam Cooke does come to mind, actually.  Not that they sound alike so much, but there is a PURE MUSICAL QUALITY to their voices that few others had then or have now.)    This project is the bomb!  Though written several years ago, the message in the music  is still very relevant today!  And Marvin delivers like no one else can!    FABULOUS

B00005QGAT|4.0|You could already tell that this dude was gonna be BIG.  No one I don't think could have  predicted that he would become the supersonic megastar that he did become.    But from this project you surely could tell that he belonged out front.    Very enjoyable look back at the starting point from a solo point of view for a man  who would become a music legend!
B0021M9L1E|5.0|I found this book at my friend's house in Chicago, while I was visiting a few weeks back. This is definitely one of the best and most relevant books I have ever read. Great writing style, I could not stop reading until I finished.
B003BKF696|5.0|On High Violet the National takes us on a journey through the eyes of a 30-something protagonist, fearful of love and of the trappings of suburban settling down.  When the album begins, the narrator is \\"walking with spiders\\" into a relationship and contemplating the rabbit hole he is about to go down.  Through the course of the album, he experiences sorrow (Sorrow), fear (Afraid of everyone), schizophrenia (Lemonworld), resigned embattlement (Runaway) and sardonic self-contemplation (Conversation 16).  Perhaps the perfect ending is the closer Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks in which the narrator turns to a world-weary realization that \\"all the very best of us/string ourselves up for love\\" and that somehow it's all going to be okay.  It's a wild, emotional ride but totally worth it.  Similar to the band's prior releases, you may also find that it takes several listens to fully appreciate (I've been listening to a stream on NPR while at my computer for several days now).  The payoff is music that doesn't tire easily.  Like classical music, the National's songs are built to last and you will still enjoy them years after hearing them for the fist time.

If you have the right high-fidelity equipment (tube amp, good loudspeakers, interconnects), this recording will project a beautiful stereo image as well as extend your sound stage way past the loudspeaker placement.  It's worth the price just for \\"Cocaine.\\"  It blows my mind every time I listen.

0307454541|3.0|A lot of thought and a LOT of words went into this novel.  It's over 600 pages but they're gonna have absolutely no problem making a 2 hour movie out of it that nobody is going to want to see.  The \\"girl\\" is a modestly interesting Robin-style sidekick that's shoehorned into a frame story that is mostly frame.  The main story is about a totally one-dimensional journalist who is no Batman.  He's after an industrialist whom we literally never see or utters one single word of dialogue.  In the meantime, he is hired by ANOTHER industrialist (a semi-enemy of the first) to solve a totally unrelated locked room mystery from almost a half century ago.  Photos and the hunt for more photos take the place of actually talking to suspects, most of whom are now dead.  When we finally get to the reveal of the big bad, it comes from out of nowhere and its fake jeopardy is totally wrapped up with whip cream and a cherry on top literally within 25 pages - and we've still got over 100 pages to go in the story.  Um, for what?<br /><br />The author of this book obviously is writing some sort of autobiographical daydream about a past-middle age writer who gets to sleep with a harem of atypical women over a thirty-year plus age range while rooting out evil industrial and governmental baddies.  And taking his slow, sweet time writing dense prose to do it.
B002IR3PSC|4.0|I saw Tull later in 1978 on this tour and it was a show I could never find enough superlatives for--now I have this and I don't need words. This band has it going on on all fronts--songwriting, talent, energy, enthusiasm and showmanship. The torture here comes in two ways: first, the beginning and ending of the show being a still-photo slideshow rather than the concert and second, the brevity of the whole thing. Tull's shows that year were two hours and then some, so this one just gets you warmed up before ending--such sweet sorrow. At this point in the band's history they had the confidence that comes with a long history of success but they were still having (obviously) so much fun. They remained a great live band after this, of course, but for me they were never better than the few years surrounding this tour. I am stunned that this is all we have to choose from during this era.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|I love these two artists!  I know and love every song on this cd-what a treat to see and hear them together. They have only gotten better with age.

B002VECMAE|1.0|This movie is so bad, it will hurt your brain and make you feel less intelligent.

B0039UTDA6|1.0|LIFE has chosen possibly the worst narrator EVER for this wonderful series.  I have actually found myself unable to watch this because of Oprah's inability to read properly. She was obviously selected for the US audience because everyone loves Oprah, right?  Well, the producers should know that everyone does not love this egotistical \\"star\\" with her 5th Grade reading skills.  What a huge mistake.    The best part of the \\"Planet Earth\\" series was Sigourney Weaver's incredibly intelligent, soothing voice.  Oprah's voice is anything but soothing, it is embarrasing.  Do yourself a favor and buy the original version without Oprah so you can enjoy the magnificent footage without having to listen to this poor choice of a narrator who obviously does not understand the subject matter and can barely read the words.
B000003TAB|5.0|To me, this was the most awesome Nirvana album--rivalling \\"Nevermind,\\" and in some ways more aggressive, innovative and totally music to drive to.  \\"Dive,\\" \\"Sliver,\\" \\"Molly's Lips,\\" \\"Been A Son,\\" \\"(New Wave)Polly,\\" \\"Hairspray Queen\\"--this is a must.

0393072231|5.0|Michael Lewis writes a damn good book.  It keeps you \\"in\\" the book, meaning each investor's story, feeding on the others, makes it hard to put this book down.  This book along with others telling the story of greed, corruption and stupidity by large financial institutions, is important to the layman as well as policy setters.  Michael Lewis should be brought to Congress to let the political ignoramuses know just how complicit they are when they deregulated financial standards that had stood for decades.   I found the book as entertaining as any excellent novel I have ever read.

And the bonus - you get the CD which features songs from the show.  This is a bargain with Amazon to say the least. Once again - Madonna's energy - creativity - dancing - ensemble as a group is larger than life.  For those out there who critisize Madonna and her work - which is something I never understand - get a grip!  She is an icon and holds the magic to entertain and make people feel good after all these years! And that's what it is all about......very simple.

You can record to 4 channels at the time and adjust the levels individually which is absolutely awesome. And for the price... you can't beat it.

B003KVNV4S|5.0|\\"High Violet\\" finds The National at a high point, poised to either find their way at last into the hearts and minds and stereos of Middle America, or to fall back--either into hipster obscurity in the bars and art galleries of Brooklyn, or hipster exile in the suburbs--and be mourned by their dedicated fans but unremembered by the public-at-large.<br /><br />Ever since 2005's \\"Alligator\\" (or better yet, 2004's \\"Cherry Tree EP\\"), it's been clear to everyone who was actually paying attention that this is a band with the ambition, and more importantly, the skills to be the Next Big Thing. And yet they also have the canny hipster sense that it's unwise to look like you're actually trying. So this album finds them both writing anthemic choruses and mumbling them, crafting sharp tunes and sludging them up, and generally continuing to be infuriatingly fascinating.<br /><br />The New York Times' recent glowing profile of the band--one could call it a puff piece, but this is a band that deserves puffing--alluded to the general critical sense that this is a band poised to make the musical equivalent of the Great American Novel. And while that's an accurate picture of their potential, it's still somewhat misleading. Their previous two works were like Bukowski set to music--they're edgy and darkly funny tales of urban alienation and angst and alcoholism, tremendously enjoyable, but still somewhat out of the mainstream. Whereas \\"High Violet\\" is more like Updike, with married-with-child lead singer Matt Berninger as Rabbit Angstrom, and a little extra angst on the side. He's settling uneasily into domesticity and starting to care about the things most people care about, but he's also trembling with fear, seeing danger around every corner. He promises us it isn't \\"Rabbit, Run.\\" (\\"I won't be no runaway, `cause I won't run\\" ends up being one of the best and most memorable choruses on the album.) But there's enough conflict and longing for oblivion that it obviously isn't \\"Rabbit at Rest\\", either.<br /><br />Again, Berninger's observations seem more squarely aimed at the average American here than on previous works; \\"I still owe money to the money, to the money I owe\\" feels like a zeitgeist-capturing line if ever there was one, something that sounds equally apropos for Brooklyn or Brooklyn Park. And yet Berninger's unable, unwilling, and has no need to entirely shed the jaded urbanite persona he's revealed to us on previous albums. So all this leaves him with one foot still planted in white hipsterdom and another astride the white picket fence, and with no clear sense of whether he's coming or going. Whereas on \\"Boxer\\" he sang \\"Can I have a minute and not be nervous, and not think about my dick,\\" here he's talking about how \\"we live on coffee and flowers, try not to wonder what the weather will be.\\" He mentions hoisting his kid on his shoulders and giving him ice for his fevers, but also says, \\"I don't have the drugs to sort it out.\\" Is he out of drugs? Is he off of drugs? Abstaining for the sake of the kid, the wife, himself? Or are there simply not enough varieties and quantities of drugs to give him peace of mind in such a complicated situation? Like all the best lyricists, he's written this in a way that it can be interpreted many ways, and mean many things to many people depending on which parts resonate with their own experiences.<br /><br />Musically, the band's as tight as ever; they always remind me of a moonlit sea, dark and energetic, deep and intense, but with bright flashes and intricate details. They've sludged things up a bit at the end of the somewhat Springsteen-ian \\"Terrible Love,\\" taking a page from their live act, where they've been doing a messy deconstruction of \\"About Today\\" as a staple closer for some time now, and \\"Little Faith\\" has wonderful low ominous strings that help make it perhaps the most brooding song they've ever written, which is really really saying something. Still, all in all, it's of a piece with their previous works, which isn't exactly a bad thing. (The album as a whole has a solid, conventional arc to it, which isn't bad, but also isn't as daring as \\"Alligator,\\" which put some of the most charging and driving songs at the end of the album--the musical equivalent of trying to end a relationship with a face-melting post-breakup late-night booty call.) It closes with relatively sedate songs, \\"England\\" and \\"Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks\\" which, one senses, are either the least exciting songs this band's written in a while, or the ones that just take the most listens to let their slow brilliance sink in.<br /><br />It's perhaps fitting that they're ending things on a mellower note; again, the band seems like they're at least trying to settle down, to reverse the exodus so many of our generation made at the beginning of our twenties when we fled suburbs and responsibility, preferring the darkened streets and crowded bars of the city to any sort of domesticity. \\"We'll leave the silver city, `cause all the silver girls gave us black dreams,\\" he says on \\"Conversation 16.\\" But it's hard to tell whether he'll succeed, or whether he wants to; the same song finds him declaring that \\"I'm evil,\\" one who wants \\"to believe in all the things you believe\\" but is nonetheless \\"a confident liar.\\" \\"When I said what I said, I didn't mean anything,\\" Berninger tells either his wife or himself or us, which obviously leaves one wondering about the sincerity of it all. Do they want to find a comfortable place in Middle America? Do we want them to? Or is it just for show, something they're doing because they think it's what's expected of them? \\"I'll explain everything to the geeks,\\" Berninger promises (which means I, for one, am definitely owed an explanation.) But since it's the last line on the album, the questions remain unanswered, the tension, unresolved. Still that tension is what brings us back to their albums again and again, and hearing new things each time; it's not answers, but the search for answers, that makes this band compelling.ly a bad thing. (The album as a whole has a solid, conventional arc to it, which isn't bad, but also isn't as daring as \\"Alligator,\\" which put some of the most charging and driving songs at the end of the album--the musical equivalent of trying to end a relationship with a face-melting post-breakup late-night booty call.)

Still that tension is what brings us back to their albums again and again, and hearing new things each time; it's not answers, but the search for answers, that makes this band compelling.
006621131X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  This book is many things rolled into one - memoir, music bio, artist bio, love letter to a wonderful friend/lover, and snapshot of the NYC subculture during the 60s & 70s.  Even if you're not a huge Patti Smith fan, you will be after reading this book. Very well written, like a true poet.
B000YI7MRM|4.0|So here's what we got, we have an epic film that shows a new side to movie sword fighting as we see it. Alatriste shows rapier sword fighting as it truly would have been back in the period. The story is tricky to follow at times, however it is a very involved story, so it's justified. By far one of the best period pieces i've bought in a long time.
0525421580|4.0|This review originally appeared in [...]    The latest book I finished was Will Grayson, Will Grayson, by John Green and David Levithan, who is well-known for writing Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist. It falls into the same category as recent high-school classics I Love You, Beth Cooper and King Dork.    High-school kids simply make for great comedy characters, and there is no exception here. The title refers to the two protagonists in this quick-read-of-a-novel. They have the same names and happen to meet up one night bizarrely and awkwardly in a porn shop in Chicago. They both find themselves drawn to a friendship with Tiny Cooper, an outrageously fat and gay tight end on the football team at straight Will's school. Tiny is producing \\"the gayest high-school musical ever\\" which also happens to be called \\"Tiny Dancer\\" and is his life history told through the lens of boyfriend breakups.    There is not a huge plot line, but the character development is excellent. By the end, there is a real sense of connection between the reader and the main players. And although the story doesn't necessarily flow effortlessly, there are plenty of humorous, enjoyable scenes throughout, including the one in which straight Will becomes the only member of the student-body Straight Gay Alliance and when he joins Tiny and friend/girlfriend/fellow-music-lover Jane to see Neutral Milk Hotel but gets kicked out of the club for having a fake ID that claims he's not old enough to get in.    And Maura is gay Will's friend until he finds out she has created his fake out-of-state boyfriend named Isaac in a lengthy online love affair. This incident results in the two Will Grayson's meeting.    Green and Levithan have come up with a creative work plan, in which one wrote the gay Will's chapters and the other handled the straight Will parts. In that light, the flow is surprisingly strong, and, in the end, the plot is not the really crucial element.    This is a good and funny read and well worth the time for mature teens and adults alike.    ***1/2 out of ***** stars
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|The Pacific is definately not Band Of Brothers. Nor was is made out to be. Band Of Brothers was about how war created a brotherhood between \\"Easy Company\\". The Pacific on the other hand shows an accurate protrayal of the brutalities of war, both physically and mentally. The Pacific shows what was going on on the western front during WWII, when most of the American eyes were concentrated on the War in Europe. This series shows what our Marines went through physically and still are going through mentally in the War against Japan. IF you're looking for a mushy war movie that makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside, this isn't your cup of tea. This is the realities of war.
1439153663|5.0|I loved this book from the start.  This book should be on the bestseller list as \\"The Help\\" has been for some time.  It's a wonderful heartwarming story.
032147404X|1.0|I got this book series as a present from my grandma, because I am into photography and know at least the basics    I open up this book as excited as ever, seeing all the new information I shall receive to better myself    The first page is entirely him lying about a term then not telling us what it actually means (after reading it twice I think I got it) and that's pretty much the entire book, offering basic ideas inter laden with the basics of photography, for example getting a cable release for when it is on a tripod, aka the reason they were made.    I find this book to be useless to everyone but someone who doesn't know anything about photography and doesn't mind the constant stream of sarcasm.

B0000640VO|5.0|I saw this recently in a hotel room while on a business trip.  I began watching casually, but became drawn in the longer I watched.  (I think that's what good art is supposed to do...)  I won't go into the story -- that's been done enough here.  I just want to tell what I found to be the most memorable scenes:    1) The scene where Amelie is cutting up the copied letters in order to create a new letter purportedly from her older friend's fallen loved one.  THe scene begins with her holding up a letter and a scissors, then zoom!, fast-forwards through all the cut and paste to then show her soaking the newly created letter in wine to \\"age\\" it.  That was just cool.    2) The scene where Amelie is standing near the photo booth and sees the bald man emerge with the toolbox.  \\"Of course!\\" some of us say, while the camera focuses on Amelie smiling, and the scene goes entirely white.  It's the ultimate expression of:  \\"Then it dawned on me!\\"    3) The scene where Amelie finally opens the door and finds Nino standing there.  Nothing is said.  She kisses him in three different places on his face and neck.  He looks at her and then does the same in return.  I don't react kindly to \\"sappy\\" scenes, but this was done so well, expressing amazement, recognition, kindness, respect, and happiness, AND yes, love.    This film is wonderful and artistic.  If I were to suggest an improvement, I would want to add a component of faith, just because that, like love, romance, joie de vivre, etc. is so important to so many people, regardless of what so many others tell them they must or must not believe.  If I were to cast any criticism, the restroom romp scene was a bit overdone, but yes it was amusing...      Great fun to watch, and I'd recommend it as one of the best foreign films I've seen.  Thanks.
B002TVQ4HG|3.0|Triangle (Christopher Smith, 2009)<br /><br />The heap of \\"great concept, so-so execution\\" movies seems to be growing a lot faster than it was five or ten years ago. I'm not sure if this means I'm more critical of technical details or more open to ludicrous ideas being great, but either way, there you go. And I will leave it to you to decide which of these things is the case when it comes to Triangle, the most recent film from Severance director Christopher Smith (not to be confused with American Movie director Chris Smith, by the way). Unfortunately, I can't leave ti to you in this review, as that would constitute major spoilers; you'll have to see it for yourself. And lest I sound like this review is going to be all gloom and doom, you should see it. With the caveat that it's the same kind of \\"should\\" that has teachers assigning you Sir Walter Scott in high school; you'll be better for the experience, but you might not enjoy it.<br /><br />The movie starts off with a bunch of folks going off on a three-hour tour. There's Greg (The Secret Life of Us' Michael Dorman), the scruffy, lovable skipper, and his mate Victor (Liam Hensworth, recently of Knowing, and best-known these days as the boyfriend of Miley Cyrus). Then there's Greg's ex Sally (MacLeod's Daughters' Rachel Carpani), her beau Downey (Noise's Henry Nixon), and Heather (The Heist's Emma Lung), because Sally always, Greg tells us, brings alongs a nubile young thing to set him up with. Except this time he's got someone along he's interested in already, Jess (Turistas' Melissa George), a waitress at a diner Greg frequents who's badly damaged from a former relationship (this is never explicitly stated, but you can gather it from the opening sequence; Jess has a child). All of this is setup, then we wander into a freak thunderstorm that capsizes the boat. After some time floating about, they find themselves a cruise liner, and it swings by to pick them up. That's when everything gets weird. Weirder still, Jess feels like she's been there before...<br /><br />You may actually have figured out the Big Twist (which in this movie is separate from the Big Reveal, which is kinda nice) just for the bare-bones synopsis of the first twenty minutes you got there (and if you read any of the studio's promo materials, they're even less cagey about it). But I won't give it away, because part of the fun of the movie is getting to the first (false) climax and asking yourself what they're going to do for the next sixty-five minutes, then finding out. It's fun stuff, and it's not a bad little stable of actors, though I'm not sure Melissa George is quite good enough yet to carry a movie on her own. I love her as an ensemble player (Turistas is a movie I return to again and again), but in both 30 Days of Night and Triangle, I felt something lacking when she was elevated above the rest of the cast. I'm not sure exactly what, and I'm certain this isn't a permanent condition for her (it could certainly be the material in both cases), but it left me feeling vaguely dissatisfied once again. Most of the rest of the cast here just seems to be kind of playing along, bored (Lung and Nixon are exceptions, and of course their parts are the smallest of the main characters). The direction is competent, if not inspired, and the sets are very well-done, and for much of the film lend it an air of creepiness lacking in many of the other haunted-ship flicks that have come across the bow recently. The big problem is that the intricacy of the plot spirals out of control towards the end, and whether you're satisfied by the film's resolution or not seems, from what I'm reading on the net, to depend on how much time you spend thinking about the last couple of scenes (and/or talking them out with others); I'm still waffling. It's solid enough to hold water, but like other aspects of this movie, it seemed like there could have been more. ** ½s been there before...

B0011UF79C|1.0|Hello audience...my beautiful readers. You trusted me through Suddenly Last Summer and you trusted me through Twilight. Now, I've got another for you. Oh but it's so much worse than both of them put together and mixed around. This is Gattaca. I mean the name should put you off immediately. Gattaca? Seriously? Is this a new pokemon figure...eww. Anyway, I had to watch this movie in class...I'd rather take a test. It's one of those modern movies that makes you really nervous and anxious even though you were having a perfectly carefree day before and would have continued that way if you weren't forced to be \\"entertained.\\" You know what I mean--the dramatic music in every bloody scene...the huge, bare interiors of buildings with only shiny white walls and no furniture whatsoever...no, I take that back...maybe a simple metal chair in the middle. And then they have that close up on disgusting things like blood and needles. The characters, however glamorous themselves, can not save the movie due to the script. It reminds me of cardboard. My monotoned professor could write a more engaging script that was less predictable. Every thing is eeked out of proportion. There is never one relaxing moment. Even when the two love interests are strolling through this field of shiny futuristic I don't even know what's, and they  are \\"connecting\\" by having long, \\"original\\", and \\"inspiring\\" drawn out back and forths like (this is a rendition):  girl: I've got so many things wrong with me....\\"(long pause)  boy: ..no you don't...(another long pause)...no you don't...(looks up and squints into the sun, mouth slightly open, and turns to the girl moving his head at 1 cm per second looking more like he will kill her than love her)...no you don't...\\" -fade out very slowly into next scene...All of this is bound together by unmelodious frantic tinkly themes that are always hinting that multiple homicides are about to be committed.     Alright, alright. I will now give you the plot overview becauseI know some mean person will say: \\"you didn't even review it! Gosh! I'm going to give you a bad rating.\\" Well, here you are: So, there is this dude named...oh I forget but it's not important. He's a dude. That's all you have to know. He lives in this \\"very realistic\\" time that will \\"most definitely\\" be reality in twenty or so years when there is a class system based on genetics. This means if you have a heart defect, you are going to be a servant all your life basically while those who are physically and genetically perfect rule over you...having all the high positions etc. Wow...so inspiring. Sorry, I just hate science fiction. I find it tedious and just stupid. But, this is stupid on all levels. So the great drama of this tale is that our dude has a heart problem but dreams of going to space of course...and so he decides to pretend to be a healthy dude so he can go. (There are all these genetic tests in the building where he wants to work such as blood tests.) Anyway, to do this, he gets this other dude to give him his blood which he will use in place of his own and does all this stuff so that very little of his own DNA will be left there and painstakingly leaves the other dude's fingernails etc at work because this dude is valid. And of course, there is the intense drama that our dude will be found out. Bla bla. And through all of this intense stuff, there is the girl...the girl with the mystery. The chemistry between them is so intense, so relatable, so honest, and so real it's like...it's like...oh I know, you know when you go to the store really late at night and you think the store is completely deserted until you realize that there's this creepy guy there in the isle who is staring at you as you reach for the peanut butter and all you think in your head is: why the hell does it have to me? and how the hell can I get out of here alive? ....that's what it's like.  Anyway, I hope you enjoyed my review! Please leave nice comments because I haven't said anythingmean about you, now, have I? Cheers.
0790731894|4.0|I really liked EXECUTIVE DECISION for two basic reasons.  One, the bad guys are Islamic terrorists--the most likely group of thugs to take over an airplane.  (Yes, this movie was made pre-9/11; nowadays you would never see Hollywood dare go that politically incorrect route again.)  Second, Steven Seagal is only in this film briefly.  (I stood up and cheered following his departure.)  Yet putting all of the above aside, this is one fun flick to sit down and watch, as a reluctant intelligence expert (Kurt Russell) leads a group of commandos clandestinely aboard a jetliner to stop the terrorists before they can inflict catastrophic death along the eastern seaboard.  Meanwhile, back in DC, the Secretary of Defense (Len Cariou), acting on behalf of the abroad President, must make an executive decision:  Allow the commandos to do their job--even though the plane is getting perilously close to Washington--or blow the plane out of the sky, killing over 400 innocent people.<br /><br />Nothing like a good seat-squirmer.<br /><br />The cast, led by Russell, meshes well; special unit forces members include John Leguizamo, Joe Morton, and B.D. Wong.  Oliver Platt is annoying, but that's just me, while David Suchet plays an evil, snarling (yet stereotypical) head zealot.  Best of the best is Halle Berry (wolf howl), playing a flight attendant who assists the special team.  Yes, it's all over the top, from the stealth fighter secretly sucking onto the airplane to unload the commandos, to Morton and Platt's endless bomb disarm attempts, to a silly emergency landing (sure, just anyone can land an airliner).  But there are thrills and chills galore, twists and turns, and a boatload of suspense, making EXECUTIVE DECISION one wild and fun ride.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
B001UV4XUG|4.0|I'm long past the twenty-something target audience for this film, but that didn't spoil the poignancy that permeated The 500 Days of Summer.  A cute play on words (since Zooey Deschanel's character is named Summer), the film is a bittersweet look at an almost two-year romance between Tom and Summer.  Tom Hansen (played adroitly by Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a typical guy with a dead-end job at a greeting card company, a job he settled for when he gave up looking for his dream job as an architect.  Summer is hired as the boss's assistant, and some sort of a relationship develops between the two.  Tom falls head-over-heels for Summer, and we can see why; she's cute as can be, bright, flirty, and a bit distant.  A sure-fire recipe for a serious love affair-at least on Tom's part.<br /><br />The movie cleverly jumps around, from meeting at work, to a few tentative dates, to a more physical relationship, to Summer telling Tom that she's young and free, and wants it to keep it that way.<br /><br />They say that in every relationship, one partner is more committed to the relationship, and to the other, than the second party.  That's true here, and Tom is the fall guy.  She finally tells him that she wants to 'just be friends' (ouch), but they keep running into each other.  Finally, Summer meets another man, gets engaged, and the relationship between the two leads seems doomed.<br /><br />I liked the film more than I thought, probably because (as any other guy) I can relate exactly to being in that position, that is, really thinking that someone is very, very special, and they thinking not at all the same.  Of course, most of the time one finds that out soon.  Poor Tom had to wait at least six months or so.  Summer, I think, just didn't want to be left alone.<br /><br />This rings true to this reviewer.  His friends are very believable in their relationship with Tom, going so far as to fix him up with someone else to get Tom's mind off of Summer.  Summer is believable in the casual cruelness she on occasion exhibits, just because she doesn't want to be alone.<br /><br />Recommended.  'The 500 Days of Summer' shows snappy, believable dialog and characters, both major and minor.  Even Tom's boss' actions ring true, for a small company who is willing to give one of their long-time employees a break when he is obviously in pain.  Three and one-half stars for 'The 500 Days of Summer'.casion exhibits, just because she doesn't want to be alone.      Recommended.

B003E66Y2A|5.0|Utterly original, terrific animated film, with great voice performances by Mike Meyers and Eddie Murphy,<br />written with lots of adult wit and humor.  Word play and visual puns abound. You don't have to be a kid to love it,<br />or have kids to rent or buy it. Charming, sweet, funny and romantic.<br /><br />Amazing, hip use of music (including John Cale's version of Leonard Cohen's 'Hallelujah'- how's that for obscure?).<br /><br />On DVD, make sure you get the re-released (or out of pint original) widescreen version, so you don't lose chunks<br />of the lovely visuals on the sides of the frame.<br /><br />The new blu-ray/DVD combo is quite strong.  I always thought the DVD (the widescreen, not the 'full frame'<br />version) was really good looking, but the blu-ray still adds some extra, sharpness, depth, and color.
B0037W68F4|5.0|For those out there who are not digging it, give it a few more listens. I must admit, when I first streamed the album off their site I did not like it. I found it too stream of consciousness, divergent and boring. However, after buying the album, it has seriously grown on me, to the point, I feel it's a better album than Oracular Spectacular. Hard to compare as they are both very different, great albums, but this is more of a journey, more layered interesting and genuine. That said, there is one song on the album I have never liked. I find \\"Brian Eno\\" very obnoxious. Beside that, this album is damn near perfect.

1440469563|4.0|When Mr. Dashwood dies, leaving his estate to his son by his first wife, his second wife and three daughters are left in difficult circumstances.  They are vaguely unwelcome at their stepbrother and sister-in-law's home, but they don't have sufficient funds to live easily elsewhere.  Luckily, a relative steps forward to offer them a home at a small cottage some distance away.<br /><br />The two older Dashwood girls, Elinor and Marianne, are of marriageable age, and begin scrambling to find appropriate matches.  Elinor is attracted by Edward, an awkward man who is her sister-in-law's brother.  The match is not approved by Edward's family, who is more well-off than Elinor, and they conspire to separate the couple.  Elinor is reasonable and stoic, and bears her hurts quietly.<br /><br />Marianne, an impetuous and emotional girl, falls for Willoughby, a charming man who seems to have good prospects and who dotes on her and the family.  But there may be trouble brewing in their relationship as well.<br /><br />I find Austen's novels to be a fascinating glimpse into the difficulty of life in England in the late 1700s.  The society is so complex and so rigid, and the characters spend so much of their time trying to navigate their way through the social restraints before they are even free to try to fall in love and choose a spouse.<br /><br />I liked reading about the struggles and triumphs of the Dashwood sisters, although I found the ending of this story to be a little abrupt and not quite satisfying.
0767812166|5.0|I saw Starman not long after it came out and always remembered how bittersweet the story was and how great the lead actors were. I recently bought it and watched it again and it's still a great movie and has aged well. The underlying story and the acting is just so good. It's not a movie to watch when you are PMS-ing. I choked up in several places and was a mess by the end. Just a great chick movie to add to your collection.

If you are just curious about HR, distance, and time, then buy something much more basic.  If you are concerned with size, although this is better than previous Garmin Forerunners, go for Polar brand watches.  But, if you are willing to deal with a bit of bulk and a long \\"train to use\\" session, this watch/GPS/HR monitor is amazing.  The Bezel is touchy though.  It is only for serious athletes.

0385523904|5.0|I have been interested in North Korea for quite a while, and although I was afraid this book was going to be a downer, I took a chance and am I glad I did.  This is my favorite non-fiction book I have read in a very long time.  In the times I was not reading the book, I was talking about it to other people and thinking about it.  I could not wait to \\"return to North Korea in my mind.\\"    I am a sci-fi and fantasy buff, and the real North Korea described in this book is as incredible as anything in fiction.  It is also a cautionary tale for well-meaning Western leftists.  Ask North Koreans how that socialized medicine is working out for them.  How about their government run utilities, housing and food programs?  On the bright side, life in North Korea is very environmentally friendly.    I only can hope that Barbara Demick does another book of the stories of North Korean defectors.  Maybe, just maybe, we'll get a defector from the elite of North Korea someday.  I can't even begin to imagine the lives of their elite.  The stories from the ordinary people are mind blowing.
B000001FS3|5.0|After its release, Bono was quoted as saying \\"The Joshua Tree is the best record we've made to date, but it will not be our best record by a long shot.\\"  People may argue about whether or not it is their best record, or even was at the time, but I think it would be difficult to support the second half of the statement.  \\"The Joshua Tree\\" was released on the 9th of March, 1987 and was a critical success, and a sales success as well as it reached number 1 on the charts in over 20 countries.  It was U2's fifth studio album, and with it the group explored different genres, and in particular blues, than they had in their previous albums.  At the same time, the album also builds on their previous release, \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\", both in sound and with their decision to stick with Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois as producers.    The album opens with the brilliant \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\", the third single from the album, and a piece which sets the tone and the style for the entire album.  The second track is \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" which was also the second single from the album which brings forward the religious aspect of the album, both in lyric and in gospel influence.  \\"With or Without You\\" is next, and it was the first single from the album.  A song dealing with internal conflicting feelings and desires.  \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" brings in a different sound, and yet works well with the rest of the album, this is the first political song from the album.      \\"Running To Stand Still\\" brings some blues into the album, with its acoustic interaction between guitar and piano.  The lyric refers to the heroin epidemic in Dublin during the 80's.  \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\" is next, a song which had been planned to be a single, but when they had difficulty with the video they released \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" instead.  That problem aside, this track would have been a good single.  \\"In God's Country\\" is the shortest piece on the album, andprobably the highest energy one as well.  It was released as the fourth single for the album in the U.S. and Canada.    \\"Trip Through Your Wires\\" is next, a piece with a different feel than most of the rest of the album, with Bono playing Harmonica, and a lyric which plays with good vs. evil and the path which our desires lead us down.  \\"One Tree Hill\\" was released as a single in New Zealand and became number one there.  The song was written about Greg Carroll, to whom the entire album is dedicated.  Greg was Bono's assistant, and died in a motorcycle accident during the period when the album was being recorded.  \\"Exit\\" is another interesting piece, which appears to be dealing with suicide or perhaps murder, as it starts soft and builds to a heart-racing crescendo, and then jumps between the two contrasts.  The album closes with \\"Mothers of the Disappeared\\", a final political statement about the civil war in El Salvador and the people who \\"disappeared\\".     \\"The Joshua Tree\\" took U2 from an internationally known and respected group, to the status of one of the greatest groups in existence.  They broadened their sound by exploring different genres, yet maintained their own identity.  It may or may not be your favorite U2 album, but it is one of those albums which is known by even the most casual fan, and it is one of the defining albums of the period.

I have seen KEANE for every live performance in Chicago and have all their releases including all their UK singles.  This CD sounds like they are trying to bring disco back.  I thought DISCO ended with the disco demolition at Comiskey park in the late 1970's?  I absolutely hate the songs with K'NAAN and TIGARAH.  RAP doesn't fit well with KEANE music.  COLDPLAY used rap on an already well established hit on their EP for a different version...not new songs.  The song with TIGARAH sounds like it should be on THE DISNEY CHANNEL.  My son is also a BIG KEANE fan and he heard a clip of this song on the internet and said for me to pick up only one CD  The songs BACK IN TIME, CLEAR SKIES and MY SHADOW are true KEANE songs BUT certainly not their strongest efforts.
B003EPPEP4|5.0|I was never a jazz person but since great artists like Brian Setzer and Nikki Yanofsky, i'm slowly turning.     This girl has a fantastic voice and her songs are very upbeat. Her band sounds great and even her mellow music is good because it really showcases her beautiful voice.    This young lady has a fine future. She is highly talented and i can't wait for her next CD. This one is only $7.99 and a steal for that price.    But there is one bad thing about this album. 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow'. I am so sick of that song.
0553213075|5.0|Shakespeare's play THE TEMPEST is, much like THE MERCHANT OF VENICE, a play where one is not quite sure whether to ascribe characterization to the ethnic stereotypes of the time or laud the playwright for looking beyond the prejudices of society to the universal equality of human beings. The plot of THE TEMPEST is generally about  exiled duke and magician Prospero luring his enemies to his island to wreak vengence is entertaining enough, what remains with me after every reading is the interaction between Prospero and the indigenous islander Caliban. How, as Shakespeare has the reader ask, can Prospero blast his fellows for overthrowing him if the magician has done the same to Caliban?  THE MERCHANT OF VENICE had Shylock giving a moving defence of his humanity before the jeers of Elizabethan society, but then he went back to being the Jewish villian that contemporary audiences would love to hate. Caliban gets that too, for although a European character muses on the possibility that primitive societies are superior to his own, Caliban is mostly exploited for a sort of comedy: watch as Prospero harasses and torments the foreigner!<br /><br />Over the years I've seen certain conservative writers blast the tendency of contemporary readers to focus on the Prospero-Caliban relationship, seeing it as a manifestation of political correctness. Still, that's what makes THE TEMPEST intriguing and saves the play from being a fairly goofy account of conspirators getting their comeuppance through an elemental spirit playing tricks on them, and then two young people falling in love but being commanded not to get frisky.<br /><br />I read the Bantam Classic edition of this work, which features some fine supplementary materials. The chapter on The Tempest in performance tracks the play's remarkable staging history, for Shakespeare's original work was usually extended operetta-style with music and dancing until the 20th century. Bantam also includes extracts from the 16th century works which served as an inspiration for Shakespeare's setting: Sylvester Jourdain's \\"A Discovery of the Bermudas\\", William Strachey's account of the same incident, and Baron Montaigne's essay on cannibals.s an inspiration for Shakespeare's setting: Sylvester Jourdain's \\"A Discovery of the Bermudas\\", William Strachey's account of the same incident, and Baron Montaigne's essay on cannibals.
B002VECM72|5.0|First I will say this is not normally \\"my kind of movie\\" but I am so glad my better half insisted we see it, great is an understatement! The key is that for a couple of hours you end up totally in the world of the movie, the story is compelling if nothing else from that it is based on a real life story. Sandra Bullock, which I like in a couple movies, just pulled out all of the stops on this one, I could not find a thing to complain about but a lot to compliment!    I will not give the in-depth blow-by-blow film critic review as I am not qualified and it looks like a couple hundred already did.     If you are looking for an enjoyable escape movie for the family this is really hard to beat.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I really like this show.  Its one of the funniest show on tv right now.  I wold recommended to anyone who needs a laugh.
030745455X|5.0|Unlike most of my Larsson loving friends, I liked Played with Fire better that Dragon Tattoo.  Lizbeth Salader remains one of my favorite female characters ever.  A brilliant hacker who thinks fast on her feet and manages to overpower and/or outsmart all those evil men in her path with her instincts, intellect and pint-sized physical prowess.  The foundation of her social disfunction and flaming rage is finally revealed. Played with Fire was more succinct than Dragon Tattoo plus not a quite so over-the-top in it's conclusion, but who's comparing? Read them both.  OK, it's not literature but it's the kind of compelling read that leaves reader's like me looking for the next book.  Read the trilogy in order if you can.
B000EULJLU|3.0|I liked Tool when they first came out with Undertow, then released there old first EP Opiate that had some good stuff on it. Back then they were more raw, and about riffs and complex music rather than progression and lots of soft sound, voices, and slow bass lines. I like some of the songs on this album but nothing is really exciting, it seems as though after Aenema they started taking some Valium or Xanax or something because they toned way down and lost a lot of energy. I'm all for some of there newer music if i wanna relax and fall asleep, but i like there days of being ticked off and telling people where to go etc.Hopefully the next album will have more energy and lose the ambient sound, although this could also be do to the side project A Perfect Circle wondering into Tools music? Maybe. Anyway highlights here are........    Vacarious  Jambi  Wings of Marie 1 and 2  Lost Keys
0307165485|5.0|My children got this book for Christmas in 1970.  Through the years my children and my grandchildren have loved it to death.  The latest grandchild was stuck with a book missing both covers, 10 pages at the beginning and 8 pages at the end. This edition replaced a hunting story with one more appropriate.  Great book for children starting at about one year of age and continuing up to about 7. There are simple stories with just a few words and more complex stories for an older child.
B002WCLG3O|2.0|I was very hyped about watching the animated shorts, had seen a few on xbox live and was relatively impressed. then i rented this and was thoroughly dissapointed. i think i only liked 3 stories of the 10? some are really good (the babysitter, probably the best) and some were truly awful (the dbz one is the one that comes to mind) it's a good rental but don't waste your money, doesn't expand the universe very much other than giving the forerunners story. the rest are just mediocre at best. don't waste your money on this product. i'd maybe pay $10 at most. it's just not that good.
B002WTC92E|3.0|I really enjoyed this book! It is not the best chic-lit book  I have read, but it is definitely worth reading. It was my first novel by Ms Weisberger, even though I saw the movie \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\".  I like this author and look forward to reading more of her work.
0061854549|5.0|It's fantastic book. Tells about the \\"secret\\" motives and powers that drives us. Anyone who reads this book should read also Robert Cialdini´s INFLUENCE.
B00081U6EG|4.0|This is a concert celebrating 50 years of the Fender stratocaster guitar held in London in 2004. Honestly, I purchased this dvd just because Paul Rodgers was one of the performers. It's the only live viewing that I know of him performing Muddy Water Blues, which made it worth the price, imho. The entire concert was nicely done, from the opening performers, the Crickets with Albert Lee and Brian May providing the guitar work to Joe Walsh just killing it on Life's Been Good and Rocky Mountain Way. There were several folks I've never heard of, which sent me to the internet to check them out. All in all, a good show; besides obviously Paul, the standout performances to me were Gary Moore doing a respectful version of Red House, Paul Carrack and Mike Rutherford with How Long and I Can't Dance and the aforementioned Joe Walsh numbers. The highlight, of course, was Paul. Opening his set with an unhurried, soulful as hell performance of Muddy Water Blues; Paul then introduces his son and daughter and the three perform the kids' beautiful song, Drinking. Crowd pleasers All Right Now with Brian May and Can't Get Enough with a somewhat lost Joe Walsh follow. The only bad performance, I have to say is Ronnie Wood singing Ooh La La; oh my. He's saved, though when all the stars join him for a rousing version of Stay With Me with Paul doing a great job on vocals despite obviously not knowing the song. If you like inspired guitar playing, this is a nice disc to pick up.
1595141715|5.0|I read this book a long time ago, and the haunting words of Hannah Baker are still in my head. This book is an absolute page-turner; I couldn't stop reading it. Page after page, chilling account after chilling account, I read straight through it in the span of three days. The time flew by while I was reading it, because I was absolutely sucked into another world:  the world of Clay Jensen and the town he lived in.    There are two major characters in the story. First we have Hannah Baker who sent out thirteen audiotapes that had recordings of her voice in which she explained the thirteen reasons why she committed suicide. Clay Jensen is the other main character and he received the tapes. The story is told from his point of view, and there is a twist. It gives his thoughts just like traditional stories in normal fonts, but weaving in the tapes made by Hannah Baker in italic font, which is something I applaud Jay Asher for. That is one of the parts that hooked me to this book.    \\"You can't stop the future, you can't rewind the past. The only way to learn the secret is to... press play.\\"    These lines gave me a good portrayal of the book. This is located on the back cover and the way letters are replaced with symbols gave me a haunting feeling which set me up for the book very well.    \\"And in the middle of the room, one desk to the left will be the desk of Hannah Baker.\\"    \\"Empty\\"    That line from page 4 is one that gave the book an early start as far as chills go.    I would recommend this book for younger teenagers. This book contains a complex topic that is very real, and very frightening. It happens in real life and I think that kids around that age should be exposed so they know what's out there. If it were to be read as a class, it would make the experience and the amount they get out of it even better. I also think that parents of children around this age should read it so they know the symptoms of trouble for children around that age.    When you are donereading this you will receive a tough message pertaining to a tough topic... Teen suicide.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|As a follow-up to their critical sophomore effort, Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge, My Chemical Romance decided to release something of a concept album, or rather something resembling a `story' album. Like Metallica's Master of Puppets, The Black Parade has a prevailing theme, one of death, insanity and coming from beyond the deathbed, all revolving around a conceptual character, who looks suspiciously like it was created by comic book writer Gerard Way, the character most aptly named as The Patient. A prominent character in the album, appearing in the music video for Welcome To The Black Parade and referenced in many other tracks, he represents a satirical version of the everyman, not beyond a hair's distance from the afterlife itself. But it seems it is the closest to death that one feels life in the most tangible ways and My Chemical Romance brings across that singular message with the same raw grit that paid off dividends in the first two albums.     Way's vocals were very much the same screams, the same wild cannon of lyrics we have come to expect from My Chemical Romance's front man, brief shades of Helena is back in tracks like House Of Wolves. The visceral energy of ever-present danger could be felt in that song, within every lyric sung by Way, every rift and sound behind, right down to the drums, as it is on Mama. But this doesn't come before the concept of Death was properly introduced in the first few songs, where poetic lines like \\"Throw on the black dress\\" in The End. and \\"And if your heart stops beating\\" in Dead! ushers in The Patient on his surgery table, telling us essentially about how life has only begun, even after all is said and done.    Tracks like Famous Last Words and Cancer pushes the ball forward even further. But it is in The Sharpest Lives that My Chemical Romance shows off the band's uncanny ability to pull along an exciting and action-filled tune. To include such a song on an already tasteful and well-written (just try to find another song as funnily written as Mama) album tells so much about the maturity of the band, which boasts some of the best guitar, soloing and otherwise, and bass play they have come up with. To understate that fact would be easy.    Emotionally charged songs like Teenagers and I don't love you sound like obvious Gerard Way messages, where the campiness and poignancy of teenage love and rebellion run through the earpieces like they were put through emotional transistors. Every listen-through of both would just solidify the belief that this album is the real deal, a solidly engineered, well-developed bundle of power and gutsiness and storytelling.        Hardcore rock enthusiasts aren't likely to keep this album on their play lists for long. But that can only be attributed to the strangely untold belief that mainstream music sucks. Ignore that and allow the realization that My Chemical Romance has finally hit the proverbial musical stride and made the masterpiece everyone has been waiting to sink into. Not every band that hits the big-time loses its luster. Remember that.

1569242739|5.0|This is an amazing book. When I became vegan for health several years ago the peer pressure was terrible. I ONLY lasted a few months before I stopped; bored with the food and the pressure of those around me.<br /><br />Those health reasons never went away but now health is POPULAR; Vegan stuff is relatively easy to get; and people have been putting their cooking abilities to the test. Thanks to books like this, my friends no longer pressure me to eat carnivorous fair, instead they want to know what I've done `this week' with my latest vegan delicious discovery.<br />The Carrot cupcakes in this cook actually won over people who previously hated carrot cake! My bake happy roommate and consummate carnivore is always stealing my book!<br />Great pictures! and I love that it's not just a regular recipie that was \\"converted\\" using egg substites etc...<br /><br />Complaint? Yeah I was hoping a poppyseed recipe would be in there... so I'm actually hoping for a VCTOTW... 2.
0316069906|5.0|I chose to read this book basically because I think I would read anything by Foer, after loving both of his first two novels.<br /><br />It begins with Foer explaining that he has recently become a father, and giving a brief history of his family (notably, he is a practicing Jew, which plays into his personal decisions and explanations) and their eating habits, he expresses a struggle deciding basically how to bring up his son in relation to eating. Sounds silly or minuscule in importance? Bare with me.<br /><br />The next chapter is an interesting comparison and bringing-to-light of the fact that pigs are startlingly similar to dogs; in personality, intelligence, 'personability,' life-span, and character. He then lays out how many breeds of dogs are just as safely, nutritiously edible as pigs, and gives examples of how many countries and people-groups throughout history (and even currently) immensely enjoyed dog as a major food. Basically, pigs could make just as good of a pet as a dog, and dogs could be just as good as food as pigs, but here's his point: We, Americans, don't see it that way do we? For some reason, dogs are the ones we've domesticated in our minds and homes, and God forbid we ever eat one, that'd be gross, inhumane, etc. Likewise, pigs are dirty, and stupid, and are fat worthless animals God intended us to just eat anyway, right? This chapter sets the tone for the rest of the book.<br /><br />Without going into too much detail or ruining things you could read for yourself, the book is basically about this: the meat industry is incredibly rich (a multi-billion dollar industry with profound government influence), and corrupt beyond belief. The book is not simply a pro-vegetarian plea, nor is it just a gross-out, shock value book trying to scare people out of eating meat. It is smart, well-researched, loaded with facts and statistics, and interviews with workers inside and out of the industry. The meat industry affects our world in far more, and far greater ways than I had ever realized.<br /><br />I could go much farther into this but will leave you with a few thoughts:<br /><br />I am convinced that nearly all meat comes from absolutely tortured animals who are genetic mutants brought up in disgusting and painful environments and abused throughout their lives until a (most times) excruciating death.<br /><br /> I am convinced that because of the antibiotics, steroids, chemicals and feed given to these animals that meat is incredibly unhealthy for us to eat (in a way that it didn't used to be).<br /><br />I am however also convinced that I, as an individual, changing my diet alone, even if I were never to eat meat again for the rest of my life, would not change the industry's power one iota.<br /><br />I am also convinced that becoming a fanatic and intense advocate of this would be a waste of my time and energy, as suffering animals is infinitely less important than human souls dying to an eternity without Christ, which is what I believe, in this life, is my focus and 'calling.'<br /><br />I have yet to make a personal decision of where to go from here, but this is one of the most interesting books I have ever read, and I do absolutely think you should give it a shot.ver realized.

B00000IZOR|3.0|This is great if you only want it for a pull toy.  My kids love the noise it makes when it is pulled and the moving eyes.  This doesn't work as a phone though because the cord to the reciever is way too short, and kids don't want to hold the entire toy up to their head.  They want to talk on it like a real grown-up phone.

B003BKF696|3.0|I know it is already trendy to call this the album of the year, most reviews are stellar, but so far I am slightly dissapointed. I think it is just easy at this point to rave about The National and I am a big fan. There is no question it is a beautifully crafted album, many layers, excellent production, and the lyrics and tone are impressive, but there is also no question that it is mostly boring.     I have no problem with slow songs but they still have to grab you. There is no Soho Riots or Start a War on this album. Those songs have an amazing underlying emotion but also sound great. High Violet has many slow, depressing, songs that just don't pull you in.     It's not enough just to write lyrics and about dark subjects we can all relate to. That is better for poetry. This is music and this album is just a bear to get through.    Vanderlye is entirely overproduced and supposed to create some sort of epic ending but it fails. They tried too hard on that one. Check out Amsterdam by Coldplay(when they were good) on Rush of Blood, for the perfect balance on an epic closer.     Bloodbuzz is one of the best songs of the year, Terrible Love is a great opener, and LemonWorld has some nice hooks but overall this is just too down without anything to hold onto. Where would you ever play this album? By yourself in a dark room if you are contemplating suicide I guess.     I could not play this for any new people to try to convert them and I don't think this will win them any new fans. Then again, that is not the point. National is happy where they are.     I just expected more. I give it tons of credit for craftmanship, musicianship, and effort, no doubt, and I hope it grows on me, but right now there are only a few keepers to me.
0375842209|5.0|From the description, I thought this might be a \\"kids' book\\" but I couldn't have been more wrong. It did not talk down or lower itself to be understood. It was simple, eloquent and full of description which I often find annoying but which added immeasurably to this novel. There was just enough lightness to perfectly balance the grim subject matter without trivializing it. Highly recommended.<br /><br />A note on Kindle formatting: I noticed very few errors but the pages would occasionally look wonky to accommodate Death's 'announcements'. Not a big deal and didn't distract noticeably.<br /><br />If this review gave you information that was helpful, please feel free to click the YES button below!
B002GDM2UA|5.0|I bought this Blu-Ray Disc with much apprehension as I was very disappointed with the Special Edition DVD.  I am glad to say that the Blu-Ray did not disappoint in the least.  The colors are all rich and vibrant.  The scenes are very clear for the most part, every so often a scene is a little \\"grainy\\" but not enought to affect the pure enjoyment of watching this classic movie that is finally on Blu-Ray.  It actually felt like I was watching this movie for the first time, a big accomplishment as I have watched Highlander many, many times.  The sound quality is also excellent.  This Disc plays fine in my Blu-Ray player in America.

B002ZCDR88|5.0|In an internet download age, it takes real guts on Natalie Merchant's part to release a true concept album, and one that ranks among the best ones.<br />The first thing you notice is the book, beautifully printed on lavish paper, containing all of the lyrics (poems, actually) and brief biographical essays about the featured poets.<br /><br />Then, more important, there's the music.<br />Which is as rich, varied, textured, sophisticated yet highly enjoyable as you could possibly imagine.<br />Almost every facet of popular music is explored, and NM succeeds in mastering them all.<br />And the voice...<br /><br />Disc 1:<br /><br />1) Nursery Rhyme of Innocence and Experience - with Irish band L&ugrave;nasa and a lush 13 pieces string orchestra: an evocative song about sailors, children's dreams and coming of age. Ends with a beautiful orchestra-only coda.<br /><br />2) Equestrienne - A \\"circus song\\" that might well be Ms. Merchant's \\"Being for the benefit of Mr Kite\\". The strings underline a 3/4 melody and NM overdubs herself on harmony vocals on the chorus. In the quiet passages you can hear the \\"breathing\\" of the pump organ, which seems to echo the snorting of the horse the song's about... nice touch, don't know if that was intended though.. ;-).<br />Drum rolls (strangely unaccredited) introduce the crescendo of the brass arrangement. Again, a delightful coda, with \\"pizzicato strings\\" this time.<br /><br />3) Calico Pie - one of Edward Lear's poems set to a delightful melody. Very up-tempo and joyous banjo & fiddle spark off the light-hearted mood here, again NM doubles her voice on the chorus. The extra touch here is the dulcimer solo on the bridge. Great song.<br /><br />4) Bleezer's Ice Cream - A stroke of genius. One of the clear winners on the album. An exhilarating, irresistible list of the 28 unlikely flavours Ebenezer Bleezer keeps in his freezer... Gospel group The Fairfield Four counterpoints NM as she runs through the unlikely list. Pure, no-prisoners fun. Trumpeter-extraordinaire Wynton Marsalis arranges and plays a brief, great solo.<br />On the outro the instruments gradually fade out, leaving NM and the group chanting almost a cappella.<br />There's no way this number can fail to put a smile on your face whenever you listen to it.<br /><br />5) It Makes a Change - The steady piano chords (with bass and drums courtesy of Medeski, Martin & Wood) of the arrangement bring us in pure 60s pop territory, reminding me of The Carpenters in particular... and the brass explosion in the ending, accompanied by the always steady rhythm, are playfully Beatlesque to my ears... another great song.<br /><br />6) The King of China's Daughter - Chinese melody and instrumentation for this delicate poem about a \\"skipping rope made of singing birds' notes\\". Tasteful and gentle.<br /><br />7) The Dancing Bear - This time it's Klezmer time with the Klezmatics! Perhaps not much new here musically speaking, but again a great melody and the Klezmatics' spicy playing turn this great poem into a beautiful song.<br /><br />A trio of songs with sparse instrumentation follow, which give emphasis to the beautiful melodies and to NM's voice, really on the foreground here:<br />8) The Man in the Wilderness<br />9) maggie and millie and mollie and may<br />10) If No One ever Marries Me<br />m&m&m&m begins with only piano (again, strangely unaccredited in the liner notes), guitar and bass, till a beautiful string crescendo in the bridge allows the song to really take off.<br />\\"If No One...\\" turns out to be, in lyrics (Alma-Tadema's poem), melody and arrangement, a quintessential Merchant song, one that would have perfectly fit among the best things in any of her albums.<br /><br />11) The Sleepy Giant - Baroque instrumentation (concertina, Baroque guitar, viola da gamba, harpsichord) for another enchanting \\"period performance\\".<br /><br />12) The Peppery Man - Gospel group Fairfield Four (there's five of them, actually...) return for this number.Which begins as a very rural, down-home blues with only vocals (NM+FF) and a slide dobro. One by one they are joined, in order, by guitar, tuba, diatonic and chromatic harmonicas (left and right channels), baritone sax and drums, till the whole number becomes a bouncy, soulful, almost marching band-like Dixieland affair.<br /><br />13) The Blind Men and the Elephant - again the Fairfields in another great Dixie number, to which the Ditty Bop singers add a 30s ironic feel.<br /><br />Discs 2 kicks off with a stunning sequence of 6 absolute masterpieces:<br /><br />1) Adventures of Isabel - a relentless, infectious Cajun arrangement, continuously relaunched by its stop and go structure. Check out the plucked banjo passages. Masterful.<br /><br />2) The Walloping Window Blind - A playful song about an eccentric, off-the-wall sailing crew, filled with Peter Pan-ish characters. You can indeed imagine, as NM stated somewhere, children jumping on their beds while singing along. L&ugrave;nasa again lend their whistles and uillean pipes to the playful mood.<br /><br />3) Topsyturvey-World - One of the most unusual tracks on the album, this XIX Century poem effortlessly is turned into a very relaxed reggae groove. Wonderfully conceived and performed, one of the highlights in my opinion. Sheer brilliance.<br /><br />4) The Janitor's Boy - Another New Orleans flavoured gem, with Wynton Marsalis' arrangement and a humorous, growling trombone feature. The poem's lines are so irresistible in their youthful innocence and exuberance.<br /><br />5) Griselda - Another highlight and a track that will please those who like their Merchant at her most rock'n'rolling. A spirited, vibrant Memphis soul rocker in which each verse is kicked forward by a relentless guitar-Hammond-horns crescendo. Thumbs up for James Spake's superb arrangement here.<br /><br />6) The Land of Nod - A plucked harp introduces maybe the most cinematic number on the album. A 26 piece strings & brass orchestra provides a lush, soaring and moving soundtrack for this journey into the obscure Land of Nod. Majestic.<br /><br />Four songs follow which in my opinion are fine, but perhaps don't add much to what previously heard:<br />7) Vain and Careless (Baroque style); 8) Crying my little one (beautiful melody - with L&ugrave;nasa); 9) Sweet and a Lullaby (a \\"country dance\\" song) 10) I Saw a Ship A-Sailing (L&ugrave;nasa again)<br /><br />11) Autumn Lullaby - which is exactly that, a tender lullaby given the sparsest arrangement of the whole lot of songs - only harp, clarinet and flute.<br /><br />12) Spring and Fall: to a young child - We approach the grand finale with another highlight. A twenty odd piece orchestra, masterfully and subtly arranged, lending dark and arcane shades to a sombre poem about a child facing for the first time the mystery of death.<br /><br />13) Indian Names - the last track is perhaps the most difficult and demanding one - the poem is about Native Americans' heritage, still living in the rivers and the land they'd given their names to. The music is very interesting, even if not immediately catchy... this one requires perhaps repeated listening to grow on you.<br /><br />Moral: a great album throughout - pure quality and not a single filler - how many records can you say that about, nowadays?nic and chromatic harmonicas (left and right channels), baritone sax and drums, till the whole number becomes a bouncy, soulful, almost marching band-like Dixieland affair.    13) The Blind Men and the Elephant - again the Fairfields in another great Dixie number, to which the Ditty Bop singers add a 30s ironic feel.    Discs 2 kicks off with a stunning sequence of 6 absolute masterpieces:    1) Adventures of Isabel - a relentless, infectious Cajun arrangement, continuously relaunched by its stop and go structure.

Four songs follow which in my opinion are fine, but perhaps don't add much to what previously heard:  7) Vain and Careless (Baroque style); 8) Crying my little one (beautiful melody - with Lùnasa); 9) Sweet and a Lullaby (a \\"country dance\\" song) 10) I Saw a Ship A-Sailing (Lùnasa again)    11) Autumn Lullaby - which is exactly that, a tender lullaby given the sparsest arrangement of the whole lot of songs - only harp, clarinet and flute.    12) Spring and Fall: to a young child - We approach the grand finale with another highlight. A twenty odd piece orchestra, masterfully and subtly arranged, lending dark and arcane shades to a sombre poem about a child facing for the first time the mystery of death.    13) Indian Names - the last track is perhaps the most difficult and demanding one - the poem is about Native Americans' heritage, still living in the rivers and the land they'd given their names to. The music is very interesting, even if not immediately catchy... this one requires perhaps repeated listening to grow on you.    Moral: a great album throughout - pure quality and not a single filler - how many records can you say that about, nowadays?
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This DVD is not only eye-opening, it is the truth!  We have been \\"health-nuts\\" for 10+ years, but still didn't really realize what our food industry does to animals (and people).  We thought that it was bad food just because of the way they are raised/grown.  Not so.  Our food industry is really bad because of the way they are treated - physically.  Not only is the food being produced *bad* but it is also a money-making frenzy.  The government is not interested in our health, they're just out to get a buck.    I hope many people will see this and take action - don't just agree with how bad things are going, TAKE ACTION.  This stuff needs to be stopped *now*.    -Christy
0385528752|5.0|The Heath's had me at Made to Stick, but cemented the reader relationship with me in this book.  The writing is crisp, the ideas are woven throughout the book and work in context, and the core principles are simple to visualize and implement.<br /><br />I am an executive coach that deals with the change process in individuals and teams on a daily basis.  My work means that I live in the world described by this book. What could be easier than describing the three steps that make up the main headings of this book?  Direct the Rider.  Motivate the Elephant.  Shape the Path.  Wow, very simple.  And the stories they use to illustrate each point and sub-points are well researched and not repetitve.  I have seen one or two of the stories in other writings, but not the vast majority.  More than well-researched, they are poignant and memorable.  The stories don't drag.  And they are on target.<br /><br />I am a fan!  What's next?
B002WTC92E|4.0|I didnt think this book was that bad at all. No it wasn't the best book I ever read but I thought it was a fun quick entertaining read. I had no issues with any transitions that others may have had. I'm glad she did something different than the first two novels. It's time to break away from the mold before people stop picking up the books. Overall, it wasn't a horrible book and think that others may have just expected too much from her Devil wears Prada days. I would give this a try. Check it out from the library if other reviews scare you away into purchasing- that way, no obligation to buy!
1400052173|5.0|I had a very similar experience to Ms. Skloot when I took a \\"Tissue Culture\\" course in college in the late 1980's.  Her name was mentioned as \\"Henrietta Lane\\", but nothing else was said of her.  Being lazy and not a being writer I never bothered to find anything else about Henrietta Lacks.  I am grateful for this book.  I even ended up studying at Johns Hopkins and lived in Baltimore and I had no idea of the great story behind these cells.  The book flows and I read the whole book in two sittings. A fantastic story made even better by the writing skills of Ms. Skloot.  I highly recommend this book.
B001OQCV2O|3.0|Everything about this film I expecting going into it.  I was entertained by the action sequences and of course the explosions and sounds were awesome.  Who doesn't like to see mass destruction?  The storyline was a little silly but that was expected as well.    However I will point out one thing about this movie that probably other reviews won't cover and that is Emmerich's use of the Genesis HD video camera to film some of the live action sequences.  The use of this camera, especially during the underwater action sequences at the end was extremely distracting in the fact that it does not look like film at all but video.  You can notice this by the smoothness of the action and it looks more 'TV' like.      I understand this was Emmerich's first use of this camera but I don't think enough effort was put into making these sequences 'film' like.  When you compare to the rest of the movie these scenes stick out like a sore thumb.      A note to all directors: The film look is something we all like. Please don't ruin it with the HD cams or if you are going to use them please do the proper post work to make it look like film.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|if you are thinking of buying this you are already familiar with Lost. nothing more needs to be said.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|The Fabulous Mr. Fox is a brilliant film done in a fanciful, uncommon style.  I took my kids and their friends, age range 9 to 13, and all loved it.  Some adults I have talked to just hated it, or didn't get it, or saw it as a propoganda film.  I am an adult, and I just loved it.<br /><br />*** Spoiler alert! ****<br /><br />This story sets a nice foundation and builds upon itself through its characters.  It is presented using (now-rare) stop animation.  The style is colorized with an orange/brown scheme (sunrise, sunset) and is nearly perfectly voiced.  It is recognizable as a Roald Dahl book, and also as a Wes Anderson film.  It is appropriate as a kids' movie, but it is also a nonreligious, nondramatic parable regarding the human behavior to regress to your instincts.  \\"Wild animals\\" need to be kept in check, but tend toward activities not well received by the [in this case, woman] who would otherwise 'keep' us back in civilization (as regarded).  Mr. Fox has a trademark whistle and a guilty, 'silly-me' grin -- he knows what he is and how he is received.  But, then again,(!) the future wife was also front and center in the original schemes as well....and yet demands we regress into what is proper.  She is here more risk averse, not as daring, and probably not nearly as 'stupid.'  She is more civilized.  Ponder the situation, and it hints about why we allow ourselves to be captive and to conform.<br /><br />Also note some parallels to Roald Dahl himself: has was a writer, very athletically capable, captain of several teams (very tall too), was a pilot in Africa in WWII and reputedly engaged in espionage.  Read 'Going Solo,' his autobiography, if you want to learn more (it's also very good.)<br /><br />I'm going to watch this one over again.  Fun, fun stuff!
B000SMWUPS|5.0|This was a great add on and works really well. I just wish I had paid attention to reviewers who said don't fold your stroller with it on, we bent the rim of the caddy the first time we used it but it bent back and still works great. The zip mesh pocket is a nice touch.<br /><br />It even works with our Joovy Kooper's split handles (it doesn't have one long straight rail) so if you are worried about it slipping on that kind of stroller it doesn't seem to have any problems on ours.
B00013F35I|5.0|This DVD supports the CD release \\"The Rising\\" by Bruce Springsteen & The E-Street Band. Bruce Springsteen & the band may be older, but there is no loss of momentum in delivering a stunning performance by these versatile musicians! Songs from the CD \\"The Rising\\" predominate but old classics are not forgotten. The 2 DVD set has 3 hours of beautiful performance by the band, including bonus material on some rehearsal footage of \\"The Rising Tour\\". It may be the first time in ten years that band is playing together again, but this does not show at all, great performance, highly recommended! My favourite performance is in the song \\"Land Of Hope And Dreams\\" (Bruce Springsteen & Steve van Zandt are great at this gem of a song)! This song is also very appropriate after the 9/11 incidence & it blends very well with \\"The Rising\\" songs or theme!
0780626494|5.0|A view of a period in our history surrounded by fear and paranoia concerning the nuclear holocaust that was coming from Cuba circa 1962.  This wonderful glimpse of the early 1960s mentality served up by Christopher Walken as the ever positive (yet prepared for the coming apocalypse) husband and father, along with Sissy Spacek's perfect mother, makes this romp a joy to watch.  Brendan Fraser as the \\"spitting image\\" positive thinking, Perry Como loving, son makes a perfect entrance into modern day society after growing up in a bomb shelter. His innocent, loving approach to everything he sees makes a good movie and script even more enjoyable.  Alicia Silverstone gives one of her best performances in film (along with the movie Crush, which introduced her). Her \\"seasoned\\" woman of the world approach offsets Fraser's boy man perfectly. The tone is perfect, and the performances are a delight. Look for a wonderful dance to Mr. Zoot Suit. If you don't love this movie, you don't like movies period.

1416914307|5.0|\\"City of Glass\\" is an amazing book that contains dark antagonists, ingenious plot, and great point of view.  To start, the antagonist is absolutely perfect.  He is the kind of guy who experiments on his own kids for power.  Whenever he appears in the book, readers' hearts jump.  Also, this book has a plot that rivals \\"Harry Potter\\".  \\"City of Glass\\" was full of action and fun, but also amazing details.  It is full of love, danger, and at the end happiness.  All in all, its plot is amazing.  Last, this point of view is very interesting.  It is in third person, but the narrator doesn't know everything.  It really keeps readers on their toes and wanting to know the book's secrets.  This book has dark antagonists, an ingenious plot, and amazing point of view.  \\"City of Glass\\" has no rival.
B002VECM72|5.0|My hubby and I saw this movie the day it was first released.  After watching it, I said to him, \\"You've just seen an Academy Award winning performance by Sandra Bullock.\\"  (The rest is history!)  The story itself is beautiful and inspirational, especially in today's sick environment of what qualifies as a \\"movie\\".  It's rewarding to know that there are still good Christian families like the Toohey's who care about people and will take the initiative to do something positive for another person.  This movie will make you reflect, make you cry, make you proud and make you want to see it again (which is why I bought it)!!  Three cheers for the entire cast (and the real Toohey family)!!
0743496736|5.0|Nineteen Minutes by Jodi Picoult is the best work of literature ever written due to its amazing plot, incredible characters, and astounding resolution. Nineteen Minutes has a very unique plot because in all of the novels Jodi Picoult has written, there is a twisted ending, meaning that it isn't a perfect fairy tale ending that a reader would have hoped for. Jodi Picoult put a creative and interesting twist on Nineteen Minutes's resolution which is very unexpected and is more real than fairy tale endings. Nineteen Minutes has remarkable characters because the detail that Picoult uses to create the characters in this novel is wonderful and really lets the reader relate to the characters and step into the characters' shoes. Also, the resolution in Nineteen Minutes is unlike any other because it is so real and life-like that readers must feel the emotions swarming in the characters' minds and hearts. Nineteen Minutes by Jodi Picoult is outstanding and is filled with suspense and is engrossing. It is a must read.
B003K3OF78|4.0|I love Keane, pure and simple, and I realize that this EP could possibly be viewed as a step in a non-keane-like direction, but hang on folks.  Entertainment Weekly had a middling review, and the other negative reviews on Amazon made me want to step and say \\"let Keane express whatever it is they feel like expressing, however they feel like expressing it!!\\"  Do you really want to buy Hopes and Fears all over again?!?  There are some really beautiful songs on this album (especially the second to last track), and I think it is interesting to hear bands invite other artists to their party, and see what they can come up with together.  I look forward to more experimentation from this band in the future. If you have enjoyed Keane before, then hop onto this express train, and see where it takes you.  The ticket is pretty cheap!
0061922315|5.0|Over the years I have placed thousands of children in adoptive homes. I was in Viet Nam during the 70's with FCVN and then went to work in Kolkata with Mother Teresa for a brief time before starting my own work through International Mission of Hope and I returned to Viet Nam in 1988 and we began working with special needs children.   This book was recommended to me by a young woman who I placed from India. As with many books written by those outside the adoption field about adoption I approached it wondering just where the author would go 'off track'. I also have published my own book which is listed here on Amazon. I was amazed. This is a wonderful novel sticking very closely to what I see as the fact of how many children have been abandoned. I loved the story. I might add we place thousands of baby boys for adoption too from India and Viet Nam and perhaps those are children born of unmarried mothers. This is a realistic story, that could have happened. My only sorrow was that the mother and daughter did not meet. Job well done. Cherie Clark of IMH
B002VECLVO|5.0|This is a story about love between two adults. The casting is excellent, never seen Colin Firth looking better; handsome and talented. Tom Ford's first effort is superb. Loved the film and the soundtrack. Bought it on iTunes when I got home from seeing the film at the Harvard Exit Theater in Seattle. This is my favorite Colin Firth film, and I was very pleased he was nominated for the Oscar. I can see why it went to Jeff Bridges, has nothing to do with his performance being better than Colin's. That's not how the Oscar's work. Two different styles of films, two wonderful performances from leading men. Hollywood executives \\"market\\" for awards. Colin attended the Oscar hype events looking dashing and his wife looking beautiful. Jeff attended the same events with his beautiful wife but he is from this town and clearly it was time to give the Dude the statue. I was glad for him.     Both stars have a lot to be proud of. I do wish Tom Ford had gotten the best director nod. It certainly was not an easy film to direct. Jeff went bar hopping in Santa Fe, far less demanding but he rose to the challenge of the role. Bar hopping is hard in small southwestern towns!
B0001907DA|5.0|I got this DVD set as a gift for my dad in India who loves comedies. I vividly remember watching some of these movies (particularly Police Academy 1,3,5 and 6) in theaters when I was a small kid. All the individual DVDs themselves are in a cardboard box and there is thicker outside Cardboard box for storing these 6 DVDs. I have had this DVD set for about 6 years now (I bought it from Amazon in 2004) and they have stood the test of the time. The cardboards are of high quality and do not show any sign of wear. The DVDs themselves are working perfectly well even after 6 years as long as you don't overly abuse them. The movies themselves are hilarious and can be watched over and over again.    My dad and myself must have watched each of these movies at least 10 times on various occasions and each time we laugh out loud heartily. We particularly love the following movies out of the seven a lot. In order of hilarity:    1. Police Academy 1  2. Police Academy 3: Back in Training  3. Police Academy 5: Assignment Miami Beach  4. Police Academy 7: Mission to Moscow.    The rest of them are also hilarious, but I particularly love the above ones. Enough people have already reviewed the individual movies in detail.    Just get this boxed set and have fun with the entire family. Great Buy!

B001P3SA94|2.0|I looked forward to seeing this movie - but it was a huge letdown.  Besides the historical inaccuracies as detailed by earlier reviewers here on Amazon - I felt the actors chosen to play these music icons weren't based on ability, but to try and get a younger audience to pay attention to the film.  Mos' Def is NOT an actor in any way, shape or form - his portrayal of Chuck Berry was wooden and inaccurate.  On the other hand, Eamonn Walker's take on Howlin' Wolf was STUNNING.  I'm sure the makers intentions were good - but the obvious budget restraints and poor choices in actors left me feeling like a great opportunity to shed light on an otherwise under-documented period of music history was squandered.

B00337KM2S|5.0|Not a feel-good movie, but an ironic one about people that have come up with a philosophy to minimize engagement with the human element of their lives.<br /><br />George Clooney's character; Ryan Bingham, has come up with a personal philosophy that sterilizes his life. He travels with the sparest of luggage and has streamlined his routine for the ultimate efficiency. He has created a system that works. In fact he teaches a course on his philosophy and it is clear relationships are filed under baggage.<br /><br />He is a corporate axman, the most heartless of positions. He is the person that is hired in to fire people. He is on the top of his game and thinks he is essential. Ironic considering what he does for a living. Essential or so he thought until a young new hire (Anna Kendrick) in his company thinks she can out efficient him and take it up another step to virtual firing. In a bid to show just how essential firing done live is (to keep him on the road for his frequent flyer miles), this ax man, offers to show her the ropes, on why his way is better.<br /><br />On the way, he meets Alex (Vera Farminga), a similarly-minded woman, with the same philosophy that he has and they forge an alliance, of non-involvement.<br /><br />So as not to provide a spoiler for the movie, I will stop here.<br /><br />You can see how heartless virtual firing would be, though only a step up from an anonymous person handing you your papers and the movie only too well demonstrates this.<br />I also found the conversation between the new hire in her 20s on working and relationships with Alex, clearly a woman in her 40s enlightening. Do young women think they are letting older women down, when they don't put their jobs first?<br /><br />I felt the acting was very well done. George Clooney was on top of his game as the polished confident (and somewhat cocky) executive. Alex (Vera Farminga) had a similar polish with a  warmer edge and the new hire (Anna Kendrick) was clearly on her way. Her acting was wonderful and clearly captured all the emotions of this experience.<br /><br />This road trip was an awakening for all the characters.he emotions of this experience.    This road trip was an awakening for all the characters.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|A MUST see for anyone who eats! Especially for the health conscious. You'll never look at your plate the same again!  Accolades to the producers of this film. It was done tastefully (no pun intended) and yet gets a very \\"unpleasant\\" point out to the public.  WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE OUR FOOD COMES FROM!!  It's time for the American consumer to take a firm stand against these corporations that are knowingly poisoning us AND our children all for the almighty dollar.  The food supply is the first place where the government should be regulating. No one is watching this industry; least of all the FDA.  America....it's time to educate and protect yourself and your families. It's time to take action.  WAKE UP and watch FOOD, INC.!!!!!!!
1595141979|5.0|This book was much darker then the previous two. The changes in Rose were almost scary, even though I liked it that she started seeing some new options in her life. And I loved the way she and Dimitri got together and started making plans for their future. But all the time, I had that feeling that something bad is going to happen. And it did. So bad. :(((( I just can't believe it :( I want things to go back to the way they were and have a happily ever after!!! Wishful thinking :( Can't wait to read the next book though, and see if things can be patched up.
B000244FDW|1.0|My wife and I are huge fans of Pride and Prejudice.  We already own two other versions of the movie, the one starring Keira Knightly and Matthew Macfayden, as well as the A&E version starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. When I found this BBC version I had to buy it, hoping I would like it as well.  Unfortunately I found it very disappointing.  The acting is inferior to the other two and it doesn't follow the book as well in either dialog or story line.  ( I have also read the book several times). The Mr Bennet character was much too stern, Mr Darcy way too cold and stiff, and the Bennet girls were so much the same it was hard to tell them apart.  We watched the film once and decided it wasn't worth a second look.  The  A&E version is by far the best of the three.  It is superbly acted and follows the dialog and story line of the book very well.  The newer version is very good as well but is too short to allow the relationship between Darcy and Elizabeth to evolve.  It all happens too quickly to be credible.
030745455X|3.0|...to Larsson's first.  True TGWPWF is a page-turner (and thus -- thankfully -- a very fast read).  But it's a page-turner because SL has the formula down so well.  Chapters divide in brief sections, each with its requisite cliff-hanger ending.  The reader reads on, and on and on, and on and on and on, waiting for things to unfold.  Propelled from cliff to cliff, (s)he never quite reaches a summit. TGWPWF is endless scene-setting leavened with smatterings of action.  The mystery it treats is a compelling one, but not enough to sustain a 600+ page novel.  TGWPWF could easily have wrapped at several hundred fewer pages.  Any fan of The Girl With the Dragoon Tattoo rightly wants to spend many hours and many hundreds of pages in the story SL created.  The problem with TGWPWF, though, is that it presents a far less complex and interesting story than that of TGWTD.  And to boot, it has one of the most abrupt endings in the history of fiction.  SL owed his readers more.  Here's hoping the third book in his trilogy rivals his first.  The second did not.

1416950176|4.0|Alright, I admit it.  I tried to start the series at book three.  Why?  I don't know I liked the sound of the book I guess.  I am trying to broaden my scope of literature for children and am trying to read all sorts of books, so I tried Spiderwick Chronicles out of order.  Bad idea.    Today I walked into a classroom and noticed the first book, The Field Guide, on a students desk and quickly borrowed it so I could figure out what the faeries and brownies were all about.  The story of the Grace family moving into their Great Aunt Lucinda Spiderwick's house starts out fairly ordinary, but soon becomes extraordinary when the children find they are not living in the house alone.  There are faeries amongst them.  Not Disney style fairies, but naughtly little faeries that want their book (The Field Guide) back.  The faeries pull some naughty tricks to prove that they are not fooling around.      If you are into fantasy fiction, this series is fun and quick to read. I give the authors a lot of credit as they create some very fun creatures into this story and the whole series.  As a parent of a second and fourth grader, I would be happy to read the series aloud with them or allow them to read them for themselves.    By Kerri J.

B003K3OF78|1.0|Keane was quickly become one of my all time favorite bands after its first two amazing albums. Under the Iron Sea was perfection in my opinion. I was greatly looking forward to Perfect Symmetry, which left me feeling a bit disappointed. Only about half the songs were good. I was desperately hoping they would abandon that 80's pop sound with this new album and go back to the haunting piano melodies I loved so much. Alas, I'm disappointed again. More so this time, as there is only one good song on Night Train. I hope they go back to their roots someday. I've never had a band that I loved so much they were in my top all time favorites drop so quickly into becoming a band whose songs I immediately turn off when they come on the radio. I really cannot stand this new sound. Very very sad.
B00275EGX8|4.0|Probably change your perception on how hard the life you live really is after watching the routine of a bomb specialist. Lots of really charged scenes where you are left more speechless than amazed. I did not see this movie until after it won best picture and I can say now that it was worthy. The best character in the movie by far is Jeremy Renner. He shows no fear as the team leader and embraces danger at every chance.
0786886811|4.0|I have probably made about half the recipes in this book, and while it clearly has flaws (notably the measurements and the ingredients that are hard to get in the US) I would still recommend it. I'm a pretty dedicated home baker, so I'm always on the lookout for new recipes and this book contains just the sort of recipe I like, all baking, only mostly sweets.      It's true, that there are some recipes that haven't worked out (I'm looking at you, Brownies!) and others that I've had to modify. But it's just the sort of fun book that encourages that way of thinking. Instead of throwing my hands up in frustration, I've tweaked, tasted and substituted my way through the book, and it has been a lot of fun.  Recipes like the Banana Bread and the mini-Cheesecakes that have become favorites, and the pantry section has encouraged me to scale back canning to the point that it is fun again.     In all, the good in this book (fun style, interesting recipes, and many great ideas) far outweighs the bad.  Don't make this your first or only baking book, but if you enjoy being in the kitchen, you'll probably have a lot of fun with this one.
0971407614|3.0|Received this book as a gift. Felt that the spelling errors were very annoying and detracted from my enjoyment of the book.

B002ZG983M|5.0|Uma Thurman's The Bride would certainly show \\"Kick Ass\\" to her daughter, in time to prepare both themselves for Tarantino's Volume Three. \\"Kick Ass\\" is a bloody, violent action extravaganza that is smart enough to find its own footing, without being bogged down by censorship, and audience expectations. The highlight of the film is Hit Girl, who singlehandedly steals the spotlight from all her adult counterparts, including Kick Ass himself. This element of deconstruction, about how an 11-year-old girl could kill, maim, often bloody, with abandonment, and even with relish, is effective, for the most part. However, one of the main reasons why the film did not sit well with other people is in regards to the ethical implications of the character of Hit Girl, whom all fantasies, both carnal and violent, I'm sure, have been projected onto her on the big screen. However, though the deconstruction of the representation of superheroes and also our myriad of expectations coming from the typical way they are drawn is merely effective for the most part in this film, the lack of dramatic and emotional substantiality is what weakens the film, in regards to where it stands on ethics and morality. It does not matter if there is a lack of ethics and morality in the film, it is after all, a deconstruction, a satire, an overturning of the comic book and super hero genre. However, it seems to gloss it over at the end. Yes, this is a film about superheroes, but it does not mean that it could just skim over the emotional and dramatic nature; even flawed superheroes are just as humans as the viewers who root for them. Hit Girl appears to be merely shaken, not traumatized by the end. Sure, she has been efficiently trained to be like that; however, she is still a child. Even Batman in \\"The Dark Knight\\" had been given a chance to contemplate, Hit Girl has only been given a scene with her staring down at melted marshmallows floating in hot chocolate getting cold, a scene that does humanize her, but not enough. Having said that, \\"Kick Ass\\" is a great film, but it can only be truly appreciated by those who are able to understand it enough within a contextual postmodern realm, others will shrug it off as immoral and pointless.
0064430227|5.0|I found this book at the library when I was a kid and fell in love with it. It was from my parent's era but I don't think it will ever go out of style. I have such fond memories of Harold and the adventures he had with his purple crayon, which is also my favorite color. I recommend this book for young kids and their parents, too. Everyone can use an adventure!

B0035KGWR2|4.0|When I learned that Amy MacDonald was releasing her sophomore CD A Curious Thing this year, I was very eager to hear what she would have to offer.  I thoroughly enjoyed her debut This Is The Life, and I wondered what direction her music would take.  Listeners hoping for This Is The Life II will probably be disappointed as her sound has changed.  This is apparent from the opener \\"Don't Tell Me That It's Over\\" as it is produced slickly compared to the more sparse style on This Is The Life.  It is electric with energy from the first notes as it carries through the first chorus and yields to a brief stringed accompaniment.  There is also the heavily Coldplay influenced piano theme that repeats at different parts of the song.  All combined it creates a broad, sweeping sound that was nowhere to be found on This Is The Life.  While it is quite different, it is also really cool.  The opener sets the tone for the CD as a more mature sound - even on songs that on the surface are similar to This Is The Life lack the degree of feisty attitude.  Take \\"This Pretty Face\\" for example.  It has the same saloon sounding piano that \\"Barrowland Ballroom\\" had from her debut, and the theme seems to be more of regret than bravado.  Listeners will also find more musical complexity on songs such as \\"I Got No Roots\\".  It starts out sounding like a ballad lament for the first minute but then it builds over the next 40 seconds into a bouncy pop rocker.  This song also contains the line that gives the CD its title \\"And this life I lead/it's a curious thing\\".  The song that would sound the most at home on This Is The Life is the peppy \\"Love Love\\".  It is the song that also seems to suffer the most of the repetitive lyrics so common on This Is The Life.  A whopping nine lines in the song contain the title phase.<br /><br />I've hinted at this some already, but I think that the more significant change on A Curious Thing is the perspective that MacDonald seems to have gained.  I would expect that the experience of success and touring has matured her in ways beyond the roughly two and half years between recordings.  On \\"Ordinary Life\\" I can't help but think of other artists (such as Nirvana's Kurt Cobain and Counting Crows Adam Duritz) who have found fame to be more than they bargained for - \\"I don't care about the spotlights/I don't care about the nights/All I wanted was an ordinary life.\\"  Other songs show a depth in both lyrics and instrumentation.  I can't help but get a strong sense of loss listening to \\"My Only One\\".  The string arrangements that serve as the primary backdrop create a bittersweet sadness that really supports the lyrics.  Similarly \\"Troubled Soul\\" seems to be an earnest message to someone she knows who is hurting.<br /><br />The one low spot on the CD for me is the ill-advised inclusion of the hidden track - a live recording of Bruce Springsteen's \\"Dancing In The Dark\\".  Covering The Boss is risky business, and for MacDonald it doesn't pay off.<br /><br />Overall, though, A Curious Thing is a very strong effort from Amy MacDonald.  I was quite pleased with both the maturation of instrumentation and lyrical content.  Some may find the changes too much, and I would encourage anyone in doubt to take advantage of online options for listening to full songs before buying.

0764207407|5.0|When I saw that Sense and Sensibility was available for Bethany House bloggers, I was curious.  Why would a publishing company want a review of a famous classic novel?  And more important, how would I write a review of a Jane Austen novel?<br /><br />I had never read this classic; I had only seen the 1995 movie.  I really wanted to read the whole story, so I requested it.<br /><br />Here is what makes this version different:  The editors are reading and commenting right along with you.  There are notes in the margins throughout this Insight Series edition.  Some of the notes are relevant facts about Jane Austen's life.  Some comment on how a scene or character was portrayed in movies.  There were notes to help me understand the culture of the time.  \\"Ranking Our Dislike\\" was a comment updated often in the book, followed by a list of the characters that make you angry.  Some comments are just plain funny observations.  Some of my favvorites:<br /><br />\\"We'll warn you now: Marianne's bad mood is going to last the next 30 chapters.\\"<br /><br />\\"Why did we need to invent the word metrosexual when Jane had great words like fop, dandy, and coxcomb?\\"<br /><br />\\"Those of us over 35 would take offense, but we've outlived the ability to be annoyed.\\"<br /><br />If you read this book, you will not be reading it alone.  You will have others along side to make you laugh, help you understand, point out moments of faith, and sometimes give a little bit of trivia.<br /><br />I found it very enjoyable.
014241011X|1.0|The premise of this book is the murder of children.  In an increasingly violent society it is irresponsible to expose our children needlessly to fears that any and every woman they know could be a witch who seeks to hunt them down and kill them.  I have asked my children's school to remove this book from the school library.  We do not need reading material that desensitizes our children to the most heinous of crimes.
B002ZRPQ5K|2.0|I love Keane, I have all of their albums, Hopes & Fears is by far my favorite.  I was excited when I saw this album was coming out and went out and got it the first day.  Unfortunately, I found it to be somewhat disappointing.  It has a completely different feel than any of their cds and I just don't find it to be all that appealing.  One or two of the tracks are alright, but overall it was unsatisfactory.<br /><br />If you feel that you must have all of Keane's albums, then feel free to go ahead and get it, but I have to say, I don't think this was their best effort.

B002MLYA0G|5.0|Is this worth paying the inflated prices quoted by third party sellers? No - but, this can be purchased for much less on amazon.co.uk. This is the UK version of the movie and fans of Let The Right One In will appreciate the commentary from the director, Tomas Alfredson (this movie actually marks his directorial debut in the horror genre) and also the author John Ajvide Lindqvist.<br /><br />\\"Let the Right One In\\" is a lyrical Swedish movie that explores myriad themes - friendship, first love, bullying, adolescence, and vampirism. One might think there are too many themes to be handled in one movie, but 'Let the Right One In' is so-well directed and well-cast that all of these themes fall seamlessly into place within the almost 2 hrs running time.<br /><br />I was riveted from beginning till the end, and the one word that kept coming back to me as I watched this movie was \\"hypnotic\\" - the story is of 12-year-old Oskar [Kare Hedebrant] who is a victim of bullying by a group of classmates. Oskar doesn't fight back, instead he thinks up ways of avenging himself whilst roaming about his apartment complex during the winter with copious amounts of snow all over. Whilst out on his nightly jaunt, Oskar meets a strange girl named Eli [Lina Leandersson] who tells him straight off that she can't be his friend. Despite this, the pair are drawn to each other, even while Oskar updates his scrapbook with the latest news of gruesome murders in his town, where the victims are tied up and strung upside down before having their blood drained. Much later, Oskar who is by now completely infatuated with Eli, learns a shocking truth that has some important repercussions on both his friendship with Eli and for those around him.<br /><br />\\"Let the Right One In\\" is as much a coming-of-age tale as it is a vampire tale - both threads are credibly woven into the story, and neither one detracts from the other. The coming-of-age part is ably pulled off by the two leads - young Oskar & Eli learn to manouver around the awkwardness of male-female relationships with a sweetness that I have not seen on screen for a long time, and both take turns in playing the 'stronger' role - Eli commands Oskar to stand up for himself, and later Oskar finds himself in the role of Eli's protector.<br />The vampire thread is also credibly woven in - yes, there are the compulsory gore scenes that go with the territory, but never in an over the top manner. Even the effects are rather muted, making them all the more credible. The cinematography of the snow-covered landscape does much to add to the stark atmosphere and to enhance the desperate sense of isolation that goes with being a vampire - \\"I must be gone and live, or stay and die\\" - a young yet old soul trapped within the confines of immortality, and the necessary brutality that comes with it. The viewer struggles between revulsion and compassion for this lonely vampire.<br /><br />\\"Let the Right One In' doesn't exactly conform to any particular genre - part adolescent drama, part vampire/horror/suspense, it is nevertheless a compelling watch and a must-see.kwardness of male-female relationships with a sweetness that I have not seen on screen for a long time, and both take turns in playing the 'stronger' role - Eli commands Oskar to stand up for himself, and later Oskar finds himself in the role of Eli's protector.

1416550550|5.0|How long it's been since I found a novel that I could not put down! From page one, the mystery locks you in, walking right along Nell and Cassandra through the past and present. Just an absolutely lovely tale of lost love and family.
B001LF347E|5.0|I must say I really enjoyed these shows, which was a surprise, since I was skeptical at first. I was quite familiar with the Arthurian legend with both Arthur and Merlin portrayed as men at their prime time, meaning old Merlin and a grown up Arthur. So, the DVD cover centered on one skinny boy did not exactly look promising. Besides, all the lead actors/actresses were not familiar to me. But boy, was I surprised!    Once I started the first episode, the introductory line delivered by the Dragon, \\"In a land of myth and a time of magic, the destiny of a great kingdom rests on the shoulders of a young boy. His name... Merlin\\", with its musical background and flash scenes for the opening, picked my interest fast!    I learnt the basic characters were the same as what I knew from other Arthurian legend. It has Merlin, Arthur, Morgana, Uther Pendragon, Guinevere, Lancelot, Mordred and the Excalibur. But, Merlin in this BBC version have many differences like, a talking dragon who acted as Merlin's advisor, Merlin being the same age range as Arthur, Morgana as Uther's ward and in some ways, acted like Arthur's sister, and Guinevere who was a handmaiden to Morgana, instead of a born royalty, definitely an interesting different take from the usual version.    The main 4 casts were not familiar to me, maybe because they were not playing many shows, yet. That's one reason I think why I doubted them in the first place. But I found they were good actors with each episode to come. I think Colin Morgan was a perfect choice to play Merlin in this version. He could act smart, foolish, confused, annoying, upset and funny, anytime it required. Bradley James was athletically built and adequately agile to play a playful prince, who liked nothing more than to hunt and fight. He has a heavy timbre voice too, to suit the great future king. Angel Colby was able to portray a Guinevere, who wasn't born a royalty, yet she acted as honorable, kind and sometimes majestic, to suit a queenly character one day.  Katie McGarth played Morgana well, a girl with troubling dreams which turned out to be the sign of her growing magical power later.       We got to see how each character grew into maturity with each event they faced, especially Arthur and Merlin. The young prince Arthur in pilot episode was an all-too-common pompous spoiled boy; he then grew into a more thoughtful man, and became a loyal friend. I could imagine how great a king he would be later with more life experience he walked.    Merlin, on the other hand, started as a boy who was confused with his magical power, and had an immature self-pride for the power. Yet, with each episode to go, his childish pride gradually dissolved. He became more confident, and understood his great destiny entwined to Arthur. Of course, the two of them were still acting boyishly from time to time. Arthur still annoyed Merlin with his occasionally being a prat, and Merlin to Arthur, by his smart-ass comments all the time. And that was something I enjoyed much, because it made the show funny despite the dark danger they had to fight all the times.     The monster/danger in each episode might be felt as repetitive after some episodes. But it was okay, because the point of the show wasn't the monster. It was more about how all those adventures in overcoming the monster/danger building up Arthur and Merlin's relationship, from a mere servant and prince relationship, to solid friendship built on unwavering trust.
B00352TZCE|5.0|This was a great movie! It had the feel of a regular suspense movie, but the setting is so novel that you're thrown off balance. The conditions are so hostile in Antarctica that it doesn't take much effort to commit murder. Definitely give this one a shot.
0802798225|5.0|This was one of my favorite books.  I love the characters and what they taught each other.  They were able to look at their totally different lives in a new light and discover that they had more in common than they ever would have thought.  It was a story of true love and finding that one person that understands you more than anyone.  And also of sacrifising it order to keep that love.  It reminded me a little of a modern day West Side Story with a happy ending.  If you love romance, you have to read this book and it's companion....Rules of Attraction.  It is equally as good.  These were my first Simone Elkeles books that I read and I will definatley be reading more of her works and keeping my eye out for upcoming releases.
0307454541|1.0|This book (and all other works in the series) glorify violent rape and violence against women. With the pathetic attempt of throwing in an unrealistic female heroine to try to balance it out. The author may have spent his career fighting right wing radicalism, but that doesn't make him a feminist. Unless you yourself hate women, and enjoy rape scenes that are just short of celebratory you'll probably be left feeling sick with yourself at having read this.

B0039SFKSW|5.0|\\"Omega\\" is the second album since the reformation of the four original members of Asia, and it shows further musical, lyrical and even, spiritual development within the band.      Sonically, what is most noticeable about \\"Omega\\" is the presence of John Wetton's bass guitar high in the mix.  Along with Carl Palmer's stellar percussion work, Asia's rhythm section provides a driving beat that hasn't been heard to this extent on any previous Asia album.  The opening track, \\"Finger on the Trigger,\\" is a real tour-de-force.  Who said 60-year olds can't still rock?  Others like \\"Listen Children,\\" and \\"Light the Way\\" rock with a renewed energy.     Although it lacks the progressive elements of its predecessors, \\"Omega\\" is full of great hooks, even on the mid-tempo numbers.  And the arrangements are such that they allow keyboardist Geoff Downes and guitarist Steve Howe plenty of opportunities to overlay their instrumentation above the rhythm.  The album is well-produced by Mike Paxman and this results in an abundance of wonderfully multi-layered musical textures.  \\"Omega\\" sounds as if all four members truly enjoyed the recording experience.      Most of all, Wetton's voice is in peak form; strong and sounding better than ever and he sings with great emotion throughout.  As is typical of his songwriting, Wetton's lyrics are mostly autobiographical and are influenced by the spiritual renewal he has recently experienced in his personal life.  This is particularly apparent on songs such as \\"Ever Yours,\\" \\"End of the World,\\" and \\"I Believe.\\"  Musically, the latter two, along with \\"Holy War,\\" maintain Asia's identifiable majestic keyboard-driven sound.    Interestingly, the eighth song of the twelve on this album, \\"Emily,\\" is billed as a bonus track.  Along with \\"I'm Still The Same\\" and \\"Don't Wanna Lose You Now,\\" they provide the albums' most pop-influenced moments.  The emotional \\"There Was A Time,\\" begins with a sparse arrangement highlighted by Howe and Downes' flavorful instrumentation.  It gradually builds in intensity as the subjects' pain is reproduced in Wetton's vocalization.  \\"Through My Veins,\\" one of two Howe/Wetton compositions on the album, speaks of the pain and emptiness one can experience in coping with the loss of a loved one.     There aren't too many albums where every song is a keeper, but \\"Omega\\" is one of them.  Simply put, this is a sensational album, undoubtedly Asia's best since their debut album in 1982.  Brilliant!
B000001ELP|2.0|ok, folks. kiss is a good time, big, dumb rock band. i think their first 6 or 7 albums are great, but why suddenly get all (cornily) inspired and pretentious?!?! the answer is BOB EZRIN. yes, he produced destroyer, which is great, but he also had JUST co-produced the wall... one of THE commercial breakthroughs of all time. so kiss sees $$$$. we all know that money drives gene at the very least, and likely paul too, so this was probably a (failed) attempt at cashing in with the concept idea popularized very recently (at the time) by pink floyd. it's hard to write a coherent concept when you're used to writing about chicks and partying (even though you don't party), so... THEY FAILED. this effort made ace sick enough to bail on the whole situation and i don't blame him. this album is a syrupy, pretentious mess. rock and roll all night and party ev-er-y day my ass...

1423113381|3.0|First off, I love the Percy Jackson series, so naturally I preordered this as soon as it became available.  Overall, The Red Pyramid was a fun read, but fell way short of the fantastic writing Riordan is capable of.  First off, while I loved the first-person narrative of Percy Jackson, it just didn't work here.  I don't know if it was because it swapped between the two main characters, but I found the first-person perspective quite annoying in this book.  The two main characters, Carter and Sadie, were not well developed, and were almost interchangeable.  At least the name of whoever is currently narrating the story is printed on top of each page for quick reference -- just in case the reader loses track of who is speaking.  The Egyptian take on the book was fun and refreshing, although Riordan stuck too much to the original myths, and did not excercise near enough creative license - thusly, it felt very forced and much like Riordan was writing on an assigned topic, with a list of elements to include - nothing at all like the creative spin and angles he took when writing the Percy Jackson series.  I hope Riordan lives up to his potential in upcoming books - I know he is capable of it.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|I am huge fan of Pink Floyd and David really shows his perfection in this album ..... The strings are never overbearing or too cloying as is so often the case where anyone attempts to render rock in classical brushstrokes. Performed whole here, the work is improved by the setting - the stately grandeur sounding custom-made for huge arenas - along with a brace of PF classics. It's stirring stuff, as you'd expect. On a more somber note, however, Live In Gdansk works as a fitting swan song for keyboardist Wright, who passed away on September 15th.
B001KVZ6FW|2.0|I'm sure most people will thoroughly enjoy this movie. But I found it disturbing from having gone through the experience of Grandparents and Parents growing too old to take care of themselves and the seemingly endless legal, emotional, and physical demands involved with that. Enjoy it if you are lucky enough to have not experienced anything like that. But for those of us who have, Up is torture.
1932100660|5.0|This is a fascinatingly persuasive and well-researched book. Any person who eats should read it, just as any person who eats should read many other books on the link between nutrition and health, just as any person who eats should see the effects of different diets on others and on themselves to have a first-hand account of the power of a truly healthy diet. Don't limit yourself in a matter of the most critical importance.    Although most reviewers raved about the book, some criticized it, often on the basis of an alleged pursuit of the vegan/vegetarian \\"agenda\\", as if this were a valid argument to dislike the author and/or his book. If Campbell came to the conclusion that a balanced (mostly) vegan diet is the healthiest, say for the average twenty-first-century dweller hoping to live decently past 100, he must obviously foster that agenda, just like he would foster an omnivore agenda should he have found that an omnivore diet were ideal. Everyone is fostering some kind of agenda, the question being how soundly so.    The environmental, social and even biological paradigms of today resemble in a limited manner those of 99% of our past existence as a species/society, and therefore it is pretty natural that our modern conclusions about the link between diet and health will rest on very different grounds than those known from before. We expect to live much longer, our soils are worked differently, our food is treated differently and is itself genetically different from its ancient relatives, our own genetics is becoming more diverse due to our growing survival rates and ethnic mixing, our urban habits now dictate our lifestyle and so on. A reasonable dietary prescription for the average Joe of yesterday simply cannot be the same as that of today's and tomorrow's average Joe.    Yes, we are never entirely free from our personal biases, and as a vegan for almost 10 years I'm of course extremely inclined to support the book's conclusions and recommendations. But that's also because there are many other authors and specialists who spouse the same view, partially or entirely, and because I've seen for myself the results of a vegan diet on my family and on me. Additionally, our current use of animals leads them to an incalculable amount of suffering to which most people, in my experience, can't be indifferent once they decide to face it. So I am fostering a vegan agenda also on the basis of compassion.    Finally, the vegan agenda is now being pushed by many environmentalists as well, given the increasingly obvious environmental impacts of the massive management of livestock in our planet. So expect more of this agenda to come to you in the next years and decades... I just suggest you to work your biases around and be concerned with the reasons why a vegan agenda is being pushed in the first place, whether on health, ethical or environmental grounds (or all of them). I know it can be unsettling and irritating to have an agenda that demands you to move away from some of your beloved habits being pushed onto you, but please try to give it your best consideration - for your own sake and for many others'.

B001UE276A|5.0|The new album is definitely not disapointing! Moreover, when it comes in a set of 3 CD's, a DVD with videos, pins, cards, posters and beautiful books, it makes the purchase well worth the money for all Depeche Mode fans out there. For most Depeche Mode fans, our age and social status should permit us a few extra bucks to spend on what we always admired in music an poetry when it comes in a beautiful package with so many extras. Even my wife (who is not a DM fan) allowed me to place the box in the middle of our large coffee table instead of a vase. My son, who was a Michael Jackson fan for a while, told me to burn him copies of every CD in the set for his room. I personally feel it probably has been the best collectible CD/DVD set I've ever bought.
B000PMGS8G|5.0|I remember watching this movie on HBO back in the 80's. They played it so often. Seems like every time I cut school for the day, Flash Gordon was saving the Universe. I bought it and played it for family movie night for my kids. They liked it once I explained that it was suppose to be \\"corny\\". Very colorful costumes and scenery. Kinda \\"Wizard of Oz\\" ish. I can watch it over and over.
0307346617|5.0|At its best, science fiction isn't simply about zombies or space; it asks questions about our society and about ourselves.  \\"World War Z\\" does this. While the accounts of zombies and how to battle them are what draw you in, the real meat of this book is in the questions it asks. How would the governments of the world deal with a worldwide, devastating pandemic? After much of the population is wiped out, how would we reorganize? How would individuals deal with the overwhelming fear in such a situation? Are humans resilient enough to come back from this kind of problem?  And it's a dark, highly-entertaining ride as it answers these questions. I highly recommend this book.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|OK I'll admit I didn't read the book so I cannot complain that it does not closely follow the book.  However, I have read many books made into movies and have yet to find a movie that can do the book justice.  I read someone complain about the kissing at the end.  It is a nearly closed mouth, not-in-any-way disgusting kissing scene.  Puh-lease people love this movie for what it is.  I watched it in full the first time, then I started only watching the parts with Margaret and John.  Now, I'm watching parts of John without Margaret.  Richard Armitage makes this movie what it is!  And his mom, and Nicholas Higgins (Brenden Coyle).  The little things Richard does just add so much -- his eyes the way they cut to the side when Mr. Bell has called for Margaret from across the street, the crinkle in his forhead when Mr. Slickson calls him away from Margret at the dinner party, the smile after his mother tells him Miss Hale will never have him and he admits she is right and, oh my goodness, even when he yells \\"Never\\" to the striker who asks about sending the Irish home.  The first time I watched it, I didn't catch all of the little things that John had done to help his workers.  But if you pay attention, he is quite a forward thinking, honest master.    When I first read of someone comparing this to Pride and Prejudice, I was in full agreement.  I'd consider myself an expert on that movie (the 2005 Keira Knightly one).  But once you think about it, the only similarity is that the women are strong.  We never dove into Mr. Darcy's business affairs and he didn't have an overprotective mother.  I would continue to compare, but I don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it.  I think I'm drawn to these movies because I am a strong woman and I wonder how I might have lived back in those days.     If you are considering buying the 3-series set, please rent or borrow first.  Cranford is too slow for my tastes and Return isn't much better.  Poor Miss Matty just has no luck.  I've started watching Wives and Daughters but quite honestly it hasn't captured my attention and I seriously am watching North and South daily right now.
B0014NDXGA|2.0|the infomercial makes it look like a breeze to use, but it is not.  to begin with, a flag that is far away from you looks small in the eyepiece. if the wind is blowing, it is even harder to get it in the little circle for a measurement. plus, if you are not leaning against something solid you will not be able to keep the circle from moving around. it is like trying to shoot a bullseye with a scoped rifle at 250 or more yards while standing without any support for the rifle. your target moves around in the scope.  the flag does the same thing in the v2. it works very well on large targets like a tree trunk, a building, or a person. a good way to use it is to take a reading on a golfer in the group ahead of you as he removes the pin or puts the pin back in the hole. but if the green ahead of you is empty, you dont know if the measurement is to the pin or the tree in line with it behind the green or a hill behind the green.  like the infomercial says, golf is a game of inches on the tour, but i dont play on the tour. the gps devices available now are almost as accurate.  if the measurement is off by one or two yards, it isnt the end of the world for me. i turn my gps on at the beginning of the round, attach it to my bag, and dont have to be messing with it while playing. i dont have to pick it up and look through it everytime i take a swing. the gps manufacturers are wising up now and several of them are selling their devices with no annual fees and come with thousands of courses already installed.  on top of that, many of them are actually cheaper than the v2. i got my v2 as a gift. i used it for 2 rounds and went back to my gps. while using the v2, i had my gps unit on. most measurements were the same or within a yard of each other when i was able to keep the v2 still enough for a good measurement.
B0038VPB5W|4.0|This is a very good effort, and could have been a great album.  Musically, it kicks serious ***.  Great, heavy, guitar riffage.  These guys really know how to write great metal songs.  Nice flow, melodic solos, and wonderful vocal harmonies.  The songs sound GREAT.  The only thing holding this album back from being great is the LYRICS.  Lyrically, they sound like a 13 year old middle school drama student who keeps a collection of bad poetry in his Trapper Keeper. \\"You don't bring me pleasure, you just bring me pain.\\"  Come on, really Tuck?  You can do better than that.  It sounds like a Metallica album that Hansen wrote the lyrics to.  Ditch the sappy love songs and dig a little deeper.  It's one lyrical cliche after another, which really bums me out because the album sounds SO GOOD.  Then again, I also thought \\"Scream, Aim, Fire\\" was cheesy lyrically when I first heard it but it grew on me.  I'll still listen to this one regularly.  But in my opinion, the immature lyrics are the only thing holding BFMV back from being the best metal band in the world.
B0000025SB|5.0|In spite of the drastic change in music that took place during the early 1980s, I did not throw all of my Pink Floyd albums out in an attempt to appear contemporary.  In fact, I bought this 1983 release with great excitement, and was certainly more impressed by The Final Cut than anything the other English progressive rock giants were putting out at the time.<br /><br />Although this is still very much reflective of Roger Waters vision, and re-introduces themes from The Wall (1979), the Final Cut is somehow a more intimate and cohesive album.  This is likely because Roger wrote everything - in fact, this might even be considered his first solo album.  Although David Gilmour (guitars) and Nick Mason (drums) were present, their input was restricted to that of the typical studio musician.  Rick Wright was out of the band at this point.<br /><br />Musically, the Final Cut sounds a lot like The Wall - evidently a few tracks that were left off of the Wall made their way onto the Final Cut.  It is a quiet album overall and the stadium rock influences that crept in on The Wall are pushed far to the back.  Fortunately, this album does not sound like it was released in 1983 and has a very organic feel to it (there are no washes of digital synthesizers or that \\"big\\" 1980s drum sound).  The lyrics explore and come to terms with his father's death in the war and are some of most astringent Roger ever wrote.  I actually like them a lot and feel that they also provide a nice snapshot of the world as it existed in 1983 - Reagan/Thatcher, the Falklands etc.  Roger sings the vocals on all tracks and his style ranges from a soft whisper to shouting.<br /><br />The 2004 remaster of this album by EMI is fantastic and features the track \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\" along with a nice CD booklet and very good sound quality.  I would suggest picking the remastered version of this album up.<br /><br />Overall, this is an excellent album that I enjoy a lot more than The Wall.  Recommended.

0385342020|5.0|While attending her 105 year old great aunt Sadie's funeral, Lara Lington finds herself confronted by Sadie's ghost.  Even though the funeral depicts that of a very plain old lady with no flowers, pictures, very few relatives and nothing to say about Sadie except for the fact that she lived to be 105, Sadie's ghost is that of a very lively young lady as she existed in the roaring 20's.    As the story continues, Sadie is in search of a lost necklace while Lara is struggling to run a business and get back together with her ex-boyfriend, Josh.  Lara decides to help Sadie locate her necklace as a last wish while Sadie reluctantly helps Lara get back together with Josh.      Things get complicated when Sadie sees Ed, an American man that she wants to go on a date with and she manages to talk Lara into asking him out. As another last wish, Lara dresses as a \\"twenties girl\\" and goes out with Ed with Sadie along with her.  Lara and Ed and Sadie go out again and soon Ed begins to fall in love with Lara.  Because Lara is the only one who can see and talk to Sadie's ghost, Ed has no idea that Sadie even exists.      Throughout the story, Sadie and Lara get closer to each other and they are both able to help each other.  Sadie shows Lara that Josh is not the right man for her.  Not only does Lara locate the necklace, she uncovers even more about Sadie that lets people know that Sadie was more than just a lady that lived to be 105 years old.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Unlike all those glowing reviews of this product that was before it was even released I actually waited until I viewed the product before giving judgement. I've just watched two discs and so far am loving it. I'd always liked the show's witty anecdotes and down to earth vibe. I know an issue with the music is deterring some people from buying this, but it seems mostly like original tracks and I can't remember the exact music from every episode when the show was on tv years ago. Overall I like what I have and hope they release the complete series of Beavis and Butthead instead of just some lame collecters pack.
B001R4CKGU|2.0|after reading this book i was at a loss as to how it won a pulitzer. even the author was in disbelief as something like twenty publishers turned the manuscript down. it reminded me of george w. and his remark on how in the hell he won the presidency?           i read many pulitzer prize winners and very few are bad. this one is bad!             basically the book says that people have hard,insignificant and irrational lives which are rarely remembered for very long.   DAH!!!!!!!                                         a guy named Ted
1552091090|5.0|A heartwarming story about the relationship between a mother and her son. My mother used to read this to me when I was kindergardenish-age, I purchased it for her for mothers day and it brought her to tears, my mother was happy and therefore I cannot rate this book lower than a 6(Even though 5 is Max). Cheers!
B001SS3JS8|5.0|This thrilling novel will have you hooked until the end. Two teenagers and long time family friends, Emily and Chris, end up in the hospital at three in the morning one night. Chris has a concussion and Emily is dead. A gun has Chris's fingerprints on it. Parents and friends are left wondering if Chris killed Emily or if they made a suicide pact together like Chris claims. This mystery unravels itself at a fast pace throughout the book.   The author writes from the perspective of many characters. This helps you understand how the main characters, Emily and Chris, felt and acted in this situation, as well as the effect of this tragedy on some minor characters, like Emily's mom. The emotions and feelings are real, and as you read you feel as if you have been swallowed by the book and are experiencing this in front of your own eyes. This novel is written from different perspectives, as well as different time periods. For example, Chris's mom narrates when they are at the beach and Emily and Chris are only five years old. You experience the story from the time Emily and Chris's parents met to the present action-packed trial in court.    I could not put this book down until the end when Chris gets his verdict. Every chapter would tell a new story and hint at some information that would connect with something earlier in the book. As you read and experience the novel through many different perspectives, you must keep your mind open because some things are not what they seem. You may find yourself changing opinions, when each character reveals his or her side of the story.    If you enjoy this book, I highly recommend the books Salem Falls and Nineteen Minutes, written by Jodi Picoult as well.
0321356683|2.0|This is one of the dumbest books on Java I've ever read and there are quite a few out there. When you look at the contents you think \\"oh, nice an advanced Java programming with some specific examples that could come handy some day\\"    Then you start reading. Before long you realize that this is an academic essay from some professor that tortures students with dull, annoying and useless algorithm problems. You read full 5 pages in discussion of 3 lines of code. Code that will never come in handy!    My recommendation is check it out in a library and see what I'm on about. If you want advanced enumeration and serialization in Java use flipping Google search engine.

B00005JMK0|5.0|Electric Dreams is a little gem of a movie. The movie had the bad luck to be released on VHS very early in the sales cycle and carried a high price tag.  The prices were dropping dramatically, and many people, myself among them, thought the price would come down.  It never did, and what a loss to all that were enamored of the movie. Owning the soundtrack almost makes up for it, but not quite. Part of the charm of the movie is how well the music is integrated with the story. Considering some of the movie vault 'B', 'C', and \\"Dreck' movies that are DVD now, I certainly add my voice, as does my spouse, to seeing Electric Dreams on DVD!
0743496736|5.0|Jodi Picoult. Most people know her as the author of My Sister's Keeper, now a major motion picture. But I was first introduced to her with her novel The Pact. I saw a friend reading it, and after she was finished, I borrowed it.  I could not put it down.  After I finished it, I kept going back to re-read sections.  But even The Pact comes in second to 19 Minutes, a story of a high school shooting in a small town, and the people who have to deal with the lasting effects.   19 Minutes is shown from the perspectives of several different characters. This really adds information and depth to the story, because you can see what each character is thinking, and how it all comes together in the end. The story begins on a seemingly regular day. Nothing is amiss at Sterling High until: Peter Houghton, class geek, starts shooting. Ten victims are killed, another nineteen are wounded. Kids who were never hurt are scarred for life, and tranquility is shattered. All in 19 minutes. Josie Cormier was found unconscious in the locker room that day, with Peter and her boyfriend Matt, whom Peter shot, twice. She should be the best witness for the case, but she can't remember anything.   To make things worse, her mother is the judge sitting on the trial, creating even more of a strain on their already temperamental relationship. Picoult's amazingly real writing style is so descriptive that you would think you were there. You feel the emotions of the people of Sterling.  At least I did.  As they try to rebuild their lives, Sterling High must deal with the fact that Peter did not get to this point on his own and that they all played a part in the final outcome.   This story contains emotion and real life elements. The sensitive relationship between mother and daughter. The `eat or be eaten' philosophy of school. It really makes you think about your own life, and how seemingly harmless actions can have a huge impact. An insult, a punch, can have repercussions that most would find unbelievable.  Jodi Picoult weaves together an incredibly complex, thought-provoking story and, like her other books, gives it a killer ending. Filled with twists and turns, 19 Minutes is a book that will keep going around and around in your head, long after you flip the last page.
B003LFLOOW|1.0|Up until last night, I'd have said that \\"Watchmen\\" was the worst modern extravaganza-type movie of all time. Now that I've seen \\"Avatar\\", I've changed my tune. \\"Avatar\\" is, without a doubt, the very worst movie I've ever seen EVER. I'd been avoiding it since I first saw the trailer, not because I don't like sci-fi (I do), not because I don't like CGI (I do) and not because I couldn't stand James Cameron (I didn't really care about him one way or another, until now). I didn't want to see it because you could tell the plot was absolutely nothing new, that the dialogue was barely fit for a made-for-basic-cable mini series, and it was going to be three hours of agony. My husband was dying to see it, and once it was available to stream straight to the Roku as a rental to watch on our giant screen, there were really no more excuses I could make. \\"How bad could it be?\\" he asked, poor thing.<br /><br />Ten minutes in \\"Oh...really bad. Like, really seriously bad.\\"<br /><br />I know it was cool looking, and the bluepeople and floating mountains and space-rainforest critters were all nifty, but I couldn't even give myself over to the special effects because everything else about it was so atrocious. I dig spectacle, but GEEZ can I get even a smidge of believability in my spectacle? Just a smidge? And by \\"believability\\" I don't mean \\"oh, it's just not possible to zip your consciousness into a 12-foot alien.\\" I'm talking about things like \\"unobtanium\\". I don't care if it's an in-joke. It's completely stupid.<br /><br />James Cameron has given us some terrific movies with super effects, characters you feel for, and plots (predictable though they may be) that move along nicely. This is not one of them.<br /><br />\\"Avatar\\" was a lousy rehash of every predictable plotline that ever existed, paired with the worst canned dialogue ever written. It is a stunning, shining example of what happens when you give a person exactly enough rope to hang themselves with. Written, directed & edited by James Cameron?<br /><br />That man needs to focus on one talent, because he simply doesn't possess all three.

The book always leave me in good sprits when I finish a chapter :)
B002ZRPQ5K|1.0|Here we go again. Last time it was Perfect Symmetry with all the 80's synthesizers and a couple of nice songs. This time it an EP with one song that is Ok. \\"My Shadow\\" is not a bad song but it is far beneath the quality songs on the first two cd's. As another reviewer stated have we lost this band to this old sound? These songs are forgettable and that is being kind. The rap song is a joke. It might have been a good song if it was just Tom singing it without a rap beat. Again, no piano from Tim or drums from Richard. Just computer generated tripe.What is with the theme music from the \\"Rocky' movie? How far do these guys have to fall before they pick themselves up and start making music that means something again. They used to write songs for the heart and now they just write for your feet. I borrowed that phrase from someone on Keane's website and they are absolutely right.
0393072231|5.0|Michael Lewis is one of the most gifted and entertaining writers today - anyone who has read his reputation-forming [[ASIN:039333869X Liar's Poker]] will know this (if you haven't, and you aspire to a career in finance, you should), but his subsequent offerings, particularly the singularly brilliant [[ASIN:0393324818 Moneyball]] have also been outstanding. He distinguishes himself from his peers firstly by his thorough insider's understanding of how, when and why finance works (and by extension how, when and why it doesn't) but also a deft turn of phrase and devastating wit. When the subject is the logic-defying but leaden topic of tranched portfolio credit derivative armageddon, both attributes are in good demand. And both, in the shape of Lewis' airy but insightful writing, are in abundant supply.<br /><br />The rosette for \\"best book about the financial meltdown\\" is hotly contested - luminaries such as [[ASIN:1586486993 George Soros]], [[ASIN:0071592814 Mohamed El-Erian]] and [[ASIN:0446561932 Hank Paulson]] have entered more or less weighty tomes (some excellent, some portentous, some a bit wacky); as have well-respected and deeply learned journalists like the NY Times' [[ASIN:0670021253 Andrew Ross Sorkin]] and the FT's [[ASIN:B00381B7XC Gillian Tett]].<br /><br />I thought I had awarded my own best-in-show to Sorkin for his massive and all-encompassing political tome, which manages to encompass the total business perspective across an extraordinarily wide theatre of conflict, somehow holding the whole thing in focus the whole time. A criticism I had seen levelled at that book was that, while it admirably covered the outright red alert state of affairs that prevailed at boardroom level for a couple of years after the credit crunch, it failed - didn't really even try - to explain what, economically, caused all this mess in the first place.<br /><br />Here, therefore, is the ideal companion volume. Instead of viewing the battle from Operations HQ by reference to the crisis meetings of Wall Street's and Washington's Masters of the Universe (the image that comes to mind is beetroot-faced generals strutting about impotently while the Andrews Sisters push military units around a big map with snooker cues), Lewis takes us right into the heat of the combat, like a journalist embedded with a crack squad of advanced position infantry men as they dodged sniper fire and the general fog of war armed only with a Rusty Humvee and some tarpaulin (think Generation Kill as opposed to Downfall).<br /><br />This strategy enables Lewis to tell some interesting human stories - the rag-tag collection of fellow travellers he introduces us to are, as befits players in a tragic farce - idiosyncratic outsiders and loners - but through their experiences Lewis offers uncommon colour as to what it is like at ground level engaging with Wall Street.<br /><br />Along the way you will learn, with great clarity and simplicity of image - exactly what mezzanine mortgages-backed CDOs were, why the went wrong, and how the self-fulfilling cycle of CDO creation ratcheted a well-intentioned risk-spreading device into something which was nothing more, really than a glorified ponzi-scheme. And, unlike [[ASIN:0470553731 Bernie Madoff's scheme]], which took some time and expertise (if not much) to reverse engineer and figure out, this one - an order of magnitude larger - went on in full, transparent view of everyone.<br /><br />That said, I do think Lewis over-simplifies, though not in ways that fatally undermine his case - but in ways that are calculated to make the whole market sound as preposterous as absolutely possible; an exertion which really was not needed. The role of AIG and the Monolines, for example, in converting the \\"towers of dross\\" into triple A securities, was under-explained. Lewis characterised the insurers as investors: in a sense they were, but actually they were insurers of the performance of these bonds for other investors - yes; exposed to therisk of their default so investors in that sense, but in return lending their own triple-A credit rating to the senior slices of what Lewis compellingly describes as a cow pat pie.<br /><br />Lewis is especially, and incompatibly, unkind to some investment bankers in particular (a point well made by David Bahnsen in his excellent Amazon review), and having read this, it comes as no surprise that The Big Short should have fuelled the ire of the Senate financial services committee - whose chairman repeatedly referred to it - in its recent hearing on the Goldman Sachs Abacus situation, Goldman being repeatedly implicated within Lewis' pages.<br /><br />With that in mind it will be interesting to see how The Big Short fares in this year's Goldman Sachs/Financial Times business book of the year (among the judges: L Blankfein)<br /><br />But if Goldman is bagged, poor Howie Hubler from Morgan Stanley - who had the prescience to short the mezzanine tranches, but catered for the negative carry of his CDS premia by going long the (equally suspect) triple A tranches (ouch) but in ten times the size (ouch to the power of ten) thus losing nearly ten billion on a single trade is utterly excoriated.<br /><br />Not poor Howie at all, actually, as he (like all Bank employees) got to keep previous (multi-million dollar) bonuses and was simply deprived of his own \\"forward carry\\" - a small and asymmetrical price to pay for putting 15bn of his employer's shareholders' money at risk.<br /><br />Lewis handles the build-up to the final collapse masterfully - especially the lack of faith shown in his motley band of brothers by their own investors even as CDO indices plummeted yet, by some remarkable anomaly, the mark-to-market valuations of their short positions continued to decline - and the denouement when it finally arrives is as striking as you'd expect (Lewis, with a thriller-writer's flair, pegs it to a (positive) CDO forum being held at Bear Stearns, during which Bear's stock price, hour by hour, tanked.<br /><br />As the dust clears Lewis returns to Liar's Poker, which he regrets has been read more as a how-to guide rather than the cautionary tale he intended. As an odd coda, in the epilogue, Lewis meets his old boss and nemesis (though from the exchange it transpires to be the other way round!) John Guttfreund. Clearly Guttfreund hasn't got over the damage Lewis did to his reputation (to be fair, Lewis was simply the first among many - and Guttfreund did preside over [[ASIN:0471498114 the most catastrophic hedge fund failure of all time]] well after Liar's Poker was published, so it's a bit glib of Guttfreund to sheet all his troubles back to Michael Lewis), and even now Lewis has not entirely forgiven the old Titan, for ushering in the era of the publicly owned investment bank, which Lewis contends was the sine qua non which made all of this disaster possible.<br /><br />An interesting thought, whether that impulse, so many years ago, might have led to all this now.<br /><br />Olly Buxtonse, but in return lending their own triple-A credit rating to the senior slices of what Lewis compellingly describes as a cow pat pie.

B002P4VUMQ|5.0|I love this CD. Full of energy..definitely great to drive to. I'm not a big fan of writing long reviews..so I'll just say that if you're a fan..it's a great addition to your collection
0061922315|5.0|I read \\"Secret Daughter\\" in 4 nights! It is one of those books with which you love to crawl in bed. The story is wonderful because it's not like any \\"typical\\" story that American readers choose, but one that has elements/emotions/situations to which everyone can relate . I was worried about the ending....but very happy with the way Shilpi Somaya Gowda chose to close her first novel. I will be sure to follow her as a new author!

B0019N8P2W|5.0|I wasn't expecting the DVD to come so fast since it had just been released today. But I happen to go check the shipping status and they said it was sitting in the door. I'm so excited and couldn't wait to begin watching but then I saw the note from the creator himself saying that sadly, the music was changed entirely \\"because the cost of licensing the many music bites we used would have made it impossible to release the collection (and for many years it did)\\". It was probably a huge sacrifice that they had to make (and didn't want to make) to finally get this DVD out. It's not going to be the same watching this but at least the episodes themselves haven't changed. I'll still enjoy watching this nonetheless.
0743490304|4.0|Early Dan Brown--an excellent story but totally different from the Davinci Code or Angels and Demons.
0385504225|3.0|Really what is there that can be said that hasn't been said in the two and a half thousand Amazon (and countless others) already?<br /><br />Trying to match the phenomenal craze that was The Da Vinci Code seems an impossible task. Unsurprisingly Lost Symbol has been years in the making and unfortunately still doesn't quite live up to its predecessor.<br /><br />The plot lacks the same controversy, the only people likely to be offended by this piece are scientists, and let's face it. As a whole scientists aren't known for their extremist opposition to such books, especially when compared to say... the entire Christian religion. The Lost Symbol builds on such ideas as global cognition and ESP, including that ridiculous idea going around that if you think loving thoughts at water it'll freeze into beautiful crystals.<br /><br />Brown delves into character backstory for this novel, and unfortunately this makes his plots drag, where Da Vinci was a somewhat fast paced wild ride around the world, much of the action of Lost Symbol occurs in a mere few locations while we are filled in on random pieces of history.<br /><br />The antagonist of Lost Symbol is about on par with Silias, everyone's favourite albino monk but there is no secret mastermind behind the sinister plot in Lost Symbol and the story feels worse for it. There is a mandatory twist at the end which is surprising but not well executed (my question being how did ----- fake his death without anyone catching him up later?)<br /><br />There are a few pieces of well executed humour, and Brown's familiar easy to read prose is still there. Of course even though Lost Symbol may not live up to expectations there is no doubt that any book of Dan Brown's will be a raging success, all that really remains to be seen is whether Brown will continue with his Robert Langdon series and ever match the hype of Da Vinci code, or settle for the millions he must have already earned with his massive writing career.
B003E48AYC|4.0|i have to say i didn't have any over or under expectations going into this movie. I loved it!! i found it a cross between the silliness of the disney alice and the super creepy Alice that came out when i was a child, with red buttons and sammy davis jr. i'm not sure why people didn't gather that its a sequel type move... did you see the commercials for it? people are upset that the movie is not for children, nor is the book, try reading sometime. add wizard of oz to that list, not all sweet, pretty and kind. also its tim burton, all of his movies are similar in style. i like his style personally. the details that are in this movie are amazing to me. the red queen and her palace blew me away. the \\"heart\\" detail from the clothes, to the floor, to even her lipsick. my only complaint would be that is wasn't longer, if left me wanting more, but then that's a good movie too. i adore anne hathaway as the white queen, and the johnny depp as the mad hatter is wonderful!! over all it will be a movie to add to my collection.
B001VNB54A|4.0|The Pacific does a very good job of paying tribute to the men and women who served in the Pacific theater of war during World War 2. Every American should know the history of World War 2, and I believe this series should be a part of that learning process. There is a lot of attention to detail and historical fact that history buffs will appreciate, and the story is told well enough that the average person will understand why American leadership did everything they could to prevent an invasion of the Japanese mainland.    The Pacific follows elements of the United States Marine Corps 1st Marine Division across various battles in the Pacific, including Guadalcanal, New Guinea, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa. In contrast to Band of Brothers, The Pacific emphasizes character development and spends a good deal of time on this. Since the two theaters of war were very different from each other, you cannot compare the two series accurately beyond that difference in story-telling.     The war with the Japanese was intensely psychological in large part due to the environmental conditions, and the Japanese Bushido Code that drove Japanese soldiers to accomplish their duties even by killing themselves in the process. The series does a good job showing the affect of this plus the overall affect of war on the sanity of the Marines. One will quickly understand why Marines did not take many Japanese prisoners of war. The series also does a good job portraying the extreme disadvantage of the Americans in some battles and leaves the viewer wondering how any Marine could have survived.    The biggest fault of the series, and the reason for the 4-star rating, is a personal opinion that less time could have been spent on character development while still telling the same story. There is about an episode-and-a-half worth of time that could have been stripped out of the series to provide more time expanding upon the battles. While the character development is extremely important, especially to showing the psychological impact, it was over-done in this series.    Short of that, this is a series that I will definitely be purchasing as it becomes available and will be recommending to friends.
1849162743|3.0|I was surprised by how let down I was by this book.  Yes, there were a lot of elements to it that I found deeply satisfying, but it just did not have the impact of the first and especially the second books for me.  Where The Girl Who Played with Fire was so explosive I found myself gasping, this book just didn't provoke anything like that reaction for me.  I'll write in very vague terms in an attempt to avoid spoilers.<br /><br />First off, I have to say that I was very uninterested in the side plot involving Erika Berger.  I've never really liked her character all that much, and having a good portion of the book devoted to her was a disappointment for me.  I didn't feel that this aspect of the story did anything to move the plot.  I can sum it up by saying that I felt it was unnecessary.<br /><br />The most eye-rolling part of the story for me was Mikael's continued conquests.  That guy gets around, and then some.  This is a plot point that I frankly find silly as I've always found Mikael a pretty vanilla character, so it's a little difficult for me to determine just what is so irresistible about him.  Throughout the series, I derived more enjoyment from reading about his journalistic methods than I did actually reading about him, and this book is no exception.  He does gets points for being a champion for Lisbeth, though.<br /><br />That said, it's probably not too difficult to figure out that what I most care about in these books is Lisbeth.  What was really disappointing about this book was how long it took to bring her into the story.  I found myself reading and thinking, \\"Where's Lisbeth?\\"  Once the story began to revolve more around her, I was much more interested.  I was quite satisfied with the way her story ultimately comes full circle.  Though Lisbeth remains Lisbeth throughout the series, she does grow immensely as a character.  I can see how she'd be the type to rub some readers the wrong way, but I think she's simply amazing.  I read voraciously and there is simply no character like Lisbeth out there.  I'm going to miss her terribly.<br /><br />The best part of the book, by far, is the ending.  It felt the most like the other two, with that sort of hold-your-breath suspense that I found so prevalent in the others.  It also laid out a very interesting moral quandary.  It was masterfully done, and I only wish that the rest of the book had been the same.<br /><br />My overall impression is that this book wasn't as complete as the other two manuscripts.  It could definitely have used more tweaking, which is to its detriment.  Still, it is without a doubt a must-read for fans of the series.  I am very glad to have it and am happy to have something of closure to the story.  I very much regret that there won't be more.er like Lisbeth out there.  I'm going to miss her terribly.

B003DEMV1Q|5.0|This CD has those slow adult jams like Papers, There Goes My Baby. We have those club thumpers like Lil' Freak, and the Pop # 1 record OMG. Also Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home), another R&B Hit. Those radio and clubs hits have already certified this CD a success. Great album Usher.
0307454541|1.0|I was very put off by the book. First of all, it was more graphic than necessary when describing sexual abuse. I wanted to vomit. Secondly, the book has about 40 characters and with the Sweedish names, it can be hard to follow. I felt obligated to finish the book since I had already invested so much time, but I tell friends and family to not make the same mistake as I did.
0307277453|5.0|You should read this book if you want to develop a better understanding of man's evolution and how we are  related to other species.    Neil Shubin's book provides a fascinating introduction to man's evolutionary history.  The author demonstrates our relationship to other species by describing the evolution of various and key aspects of our bodies, including our skeleton and our senses for vision and sound.  Some explanation is also provided for the process of building our bodies; i.e., what controls this process and how this \\"organizer\\" is similar to that found in other species.    This is a very well written science book.  Concepts are presented clearly and the author makes his points concisely, without a lot of the redundancy or excessive explanation frequently found in science writing.   The examples and illustrations are well done and very helpful for understanding the material in the book.    \\"Your Inner Fish\\" is one of the most useful books I have read that brings together fossil and biological evidence (including DNA) to demonstrate our relationship to other species on the evolutionary tree of life.  I highly recommend this book.

0553284347|5.0|The title \\"Toxic Parents\\" appears to be an understatement at first.  I've lived under controlling parents for the last 40 years.  I have survived the suicide of my twin brother and half sister.  It would be easy for me to blame my father which I believe was instrumental.  With controlling parents the stakes are high.  I heard a story about another family whose daughter finally got the nerve to move out at 41.  But the son didn't and stayed til his mother's death til he turned 57.  The effects are real and deep.

B002UD56I6|5.0|Here it is, the sequel to the greatest movie of all time (Thriller). Ok, not quite, but This Is It deserves all of these 5 star reviews. I'm not one to just hand out 5 stars for anything, especially movies, but after my first viewing of This Is It, I was impressed. Not only is this an excellent concert performance, but it offers a look at just how much of a perfectionist Michael was, and shows that the man really did know his stuff when it came to music. He wasn't a performer who let everyone do their thing while he did his couple of tasks. No, Michael took part in every single aspect of the show. Music, lighting, effects, visuals, costumes, the guy made sure everything was perfect, and you have to admire that. Had he lived to do the performances he was rehearsing for on this disc, I think it very well could've been the greatest tour ever. All those people who flew across the world just to get tickets, and those who payed an ungodly amount for them...they definitely would've gotten their money's worth.    This Is It, in case you still didn't know, is almost an entire concert performance. It's rehearsals for what would've supposedly been Michael's final tour, and he was pulling out all the stops to make it the ultimate concert. It starts out with the main dancers being selected, out of hundreds, and we get to see how happy each and every person is to even have a chance to dance with the master himself. Each person that gets screen time to talk about how important MJ was to them is genuine, and you can't help but feel happy for these kids when they get selected. After that, it quickly gets into the main show, and you're treated to almost all of Michael's biggest hits. While the performances recorded aren't finished, since it's just rehearsals, they included a lot of the visuals that would've been shown on the big screen behind everyone, and work the lighting as well. Not every song goes through without interruption- there are times when Michael stops or re-does certain parts because he felt it could've been better, or if a light didn't go off at the right moment. I can't stress it enough- the guy wanted everything to be perfect for this show. There are also some semi-backstage bits where Michael works with the band and lets them know what the exact tone and rhythm is that he wants for x song at x point in time. You can tell when he gets frustrated, but MJ manages to keep his cool most of the time.    My only complaint is one that's pretty small, and something I understand, and it's that Michael doesn't perform much while singing, as far as his facial expressions and arm movements go. Watch his videos for Beat It, Bad and a few other classics, and then see him perform the songs here and you'll see what I mean. Regardless, I enjoyed every minute of this show. The little movie he made for Smooth Criminal was great, and I think I would've lost it if I were in attendance, had the show went on. What impressed me the most was the plan for Thriller, and how zombies would've been flying over the audience. How could you NOT want to be there for something like that? I know this review seems one-sided with how much praise I'm giving it, but this really is an excellent documentary/concert, and it deserves the high ratings it has. They never make this a MJ tribute, and focus on his death. In fact, they don't touch on it at all except a tiny bit at the end. I'm glad they did that.    Visually, it doesn't get much better. The show is presented in 1080p and looks spectacular. Even with 'just' footage from rehearsals, everything looks amazing, and it makes you wonder why more backstage footage doesn't look this good. The audio is a treat for the ears too- presented in 5.1 DTS-HD MA. There are subtitles in English and French, but 75% of this is songs that everyone getting it should know by now, even if they don't speak the same language.    The special features are minimal, but still great. The extras for both the blu-ray and dvd include 2 documentaries and 3 featurettes. One for finding the dancers, one- Memories of Michael that's pretty touching, and then another for the costumes used in the show. The blu-ray gets some exclusive extras though: Thriller and Smooth Criminal vignettes, the making of the Smooth Criminal vignette, and then the blu-ray live fare. I don't know if Kenny Ortega is one of those directors who chooses to let the film speak for itself, but I would've liked it if he had done a commentary track with stories from the set. But as it is, I'm happy with what's here.    Every Michael Jackson fan should see this at least once in their life. I bought it without seeing it prior, and it was a good choice. While not every one of his biggest hits is performed on here, you're still getting a lot of them. And to see MJ dance just as good as he did when he was younger, that's worth admission on its own right there. The man was amazing, and seeing how he is on here when talking to his dancers, stagehands, band members, and everyone else, you get the feeling that he could never hurt anyone, and wasn't bitter even after the media messes he was in. So don't be a smooth criminal, just buy This Is It today.

B0019N8P2W|5.0|I'll try and be as detailed as possible.    1. The Packaging.    The complete set comes in one DVD case. It's plastic, not cardboard. The DVDs themselves are attached to \\"pages\\" inside the DVD (similar to the Justice League and Superman complete series sets, if you're familiar with those. A lot of other DVD compilations have started using this format lately as well, so you might've seen it elsewhere). The DVDs are NOT dual-sided, thank goodness, so inadvertent scratching should be minimized. All in all, the packaging looks sturdy, and arrived in perfect condition from Amazon. Not a single disk was out of place.    2. The Episodes.    When you first load up a disk and get to the menu, you're presented with two options: Episodes and Play All. These are pretty self explanatory, however, it appears that if you want to see the Daria Day intros, you must go to the Episodes section and individually select the episode you want to watch, and you'll be presented with an option to watch the ep with the intro. Not every episode has an intro. Also: only the first episode on a disk has the complete credit sequence, all the rest just have the title card (as if they had been edited into a large TV marathon, which I think helps).    Also, as most of you are already aware (especially the ones who downloaded some eps off of Amazon recently), most-if-not-all of the incidental, licensed music has been replaced with, as the initial press release said, \\"generic and scene-specific music.\\" The music is SIMILAR thematically to the original tracks but, yanno, a hell of a lot cheaper. Those of you who taped every episode of Daria off the TV and watched them until the tapes broke, you're probably gonna be disappointed. However, if you love the SHOW (or if you're like me, and have only seen a handful of original eps), the loss of the music is really inconsequential. Also, the music they used IS appropriate to the scenes, so someone actually paid attention while dubbing this stuff in, and didn'tjust throw generic tracks in at every point where a licensed song used to be.    One final musical note: every commercial bumper now has a sampling of the Splendora theme, and each credit sequence has a lyric-less version of the theme playing over it. This does KINDA get annoying after awhile, but really, you can ignore it. At least they actually kept the bumpers IN, y'know?    In terms of episode quality, they all look GREAT. Everything is crisp and as clean as it could possibly look. The sound quality is nice and clear.     Disk 1: Season 1 (Picture of Daria)  Episodes 101 through 109  Esteemsters; The Invitation; College Bored; Cafe Disaffecto; Malled; This Year's Model; The Lab Brat; Pinch Sitter; Too Cute    Disk 1 also has three ads at the beginning for The Maxx, The State, and the three Mike Judge Beavis & Butt-head compilations. This seems to be the ONLY disk in the set with these ads, which is good. You can manually skip past these straight to the menu, but you cannot use the 'menu' function to jump past them.    Disk 2: Seasons 1 & 2 (Picture of Jane)  Episodes 110-113, 201-205  The Big House; Road Worrier; The Teachings of Don Jake; The Misery Chick; Arts 'N Crass; The Daria Hunter; Quinn the Brain; I Don't; That Was Then, This Is Dumb    Disk 3: Seasons 2 & 3 (Pictures of Quinn & Trent)  Episodes 206-213 and 301  Monster; The New Kid; Gifted; Ill; Fair Enough; See Jane Run; Pierce Me; Write Where It Hurts; Through A Lens Darkly    Disk 4: Season 3 (Pictures of Kevin & Brittany)  Episodes 302-310  The Old and the Beautiful; Depth Takes a Holiday; Daria Dance Party; The Lost Girls; It Happened One Nut; Daria!; Lane Miserables, Jake of Hearts; Speedtrapped    Yes, Daria! (aka The Musical Episode) is included. All of the music should be intact, since it was created specifically for the show and doesn't used licensed tracks.    Disk 5: Seasons 3 & 4 (Pictures of Helen & Jake)  Episodes 311-313, 401-406  The Lawndale File; Just Add Water; Jane's Addition; Partner's Complaint; Antisocial Climbers; A Tree Grows in Lawndale; Murder, She Snored; The F Word (aka \\"Fail\\"); I Loathe a Parade    Disk 6: Seasons 4 & 5 (Pictures of Stacy & Upchuck)  Episodes 407-413, 501-502  Of Human Bonding; Psycho Therapy; Mart of Darkness; Legends of the Mall; Groped by an Angel; Fire!; Dye! Dye! My Darling; Fizz Ed; Sappy Anniversary    Disk 7: Season 5 (Pictures of Jodie & Mack)  Episodes 503-511  Fat Like Me; Camp Fear; The Story of D; Lucky Strike; Art Burn; One J at a Time; Life in the Past Lane; Aunt Nauseam; Prize Fighters    Disk 8: Season 5 (Pictures of Mr. DeMartino & Ms. Li)  Episodes 512 & 513  Movies: Is It Fall Yet? & Is It College Yet?  Special Features    3. Final Thoughts.    As mentioned elsewhere, the DVD comes with a special letter from Glenn Eichler, explaining the reasons why 99% of the music has been changed.     Aside from the music issue (which, again, to me is a non-issue), this is the set we've all been waiting for. The episodes are INTACT (not the Noggin edits), pretty, and as funny as they were the first dozen or so times you watched them.     Really, I implore you, if you've been waiting for Daria on DVD, don't let the music thing hold you back. You really DO want this set. It's not EXACTLY what you've been asking for, but it's within 99% of it, and in my opinion that is DEFINITELY worth it.
B003F76HFC|3.0|While I've read every one of Wickhams books - including all the Sophie Kinsella. I must say this isn't my favorite, nor is it the worst.  In true Wickham fashion you have the main character who like a lot of us out there, put off what needs to be done until it's almost too late. While there were parts that made me laugh, there were sections I wish I could jump into the book and slap a few characters. Easy read and recommended for any Chick-Lit lover.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|When most people hear the name Sherlock Holmes, they think of a professional detective that is prim, trim, proper, polite, wears a funny green hat and cloak that is constantly telling his partner, \\"It's elementary, my dear Watson.\\"    Unfortunately, all these assumptions of Holmes are incorrect, and this movie is the first ever to portray Sherlock Holmes correctly according to Sir Author Conan Doyle's character.    What I love about this movie is that all the characters that are in it (aside from the main antagonist) are actual characters in Doyle's stories and are all portrayed correctly.  The movie itself- though slightly hard to follow the first time around, plays just like any Sherlock Holmes story reads, leading the viewer on the case, but the viewer never see Holmes' thought process of the case revealed until the very end.     I saw the movie before I read any of the books or stories of Sherlock Holmes.  After the movie, I was curious to see how much they stretched the characters and story and how much they distorted it.  I was plesantly surprised to find that the movie stayed true to Holmes' character as well as the other characters that were in the movie.  Holmes' is an enduring character and this movie is a great tribute to the books!

0393312836|5.0|Of course the book came before the movie, but if you fell in love with the movie like I did, reading the book is even more love.  I'm glad Stanley omitted the prison murder and the teacher mugging.  However I think adding the last chapter to the movie would have been better.  So Alex could be shown to loose interest in mayhem somewhat.
B0039OGGVQ|3.0|Heard some of the songs on the radio and really liked them and I enjoy Slash's guitar riffs too.When I got the CD it was just ok.Great guest artist but kinda blah.
B0039SFKSW|4.0|I'm going to put this on both the UK and the US amazon sites, since the reviews of this album are reasonably similar as at the time I'm writing this.<br /><br />I've gone through other reviews on both sites and I think references to John Payne aren't valid or relevant anymore since he's gone and this Asia is what was at the beginning and is once more.  Therefore I'm only going to make comparisons to Asia, Alpha, Astra and Phoenix.<br /><br />Having given the debut album 5 stars I can only give this one 4 stars since its in no way comparable in content or quality, but its better than Astra and Phoenix which I'd say were 3 star albums.<br /><br />Like Phoenix, and for that matter the other 'proper' Asia albums, this one starts with what is essentially the best track.  A rousing rocking number with a good beat.  'Finger on the Trigger' lays the foundation to what is hoped to be an enjoyable musical experience (5/5).  I had the same hopes for Phoenix but apart from the start, the end and one other, it was like a caramel bar; soft and sickly sweet in the middle.  'Through My Veins' was only marginally less than the opener (4/5), and that was because I didn't care much for the melody but Steve Howe's guitar play pulled this one through.<br /><br />'Holy War' was a delight (5/5); top marks for John Wetton managing to get the word Trebuchet into a song.  As a fan of history I enjoyed this one for its content as well as the melody and the racey beat.  But then after this the album fell a little flat in the middle.  'Ever Yours' was too much like the sickly sweet offering from Phoenix.  I liked this one the least (1/5).  Things picked up nicely with 'Listen Children' (4/5), an upbeat number that had Yes-style chords to it towards the end with Geoff Downes' synths.<br /><br />Then there was a relapse.  'End of The World' was reasonable (3/5), with a great anthemic intro but maybe a little too much of a Christian type of lyrics?  The ending was nicely melodic.  Then we had three consecutive songs that I thought were (2/5); 'Light The Way' had an average sounding melody and a harsh beat to the song which I found a little jarring.  'Emily' was reminiscent of a 70s pop song, at least Geoff Downes' piano was anyway, and the whole sound reminded me of Pilot.  Did enjoy the story of the song with a man's lament of never being able to consumate his love of a woman as she was a lesbian.  Nice Mona Lisa-type twist there.  'I'm Still The Same' ends the trio of songs I didn't really care much for, even though it does sound like an ELO song.  I liked ELO but this song just doesn't sit well with Asia.<br /><br />Thankfully came two good songs after this, (4/5).  'There Was A Time' certainly has a folk influence, and that's something I like and admire.  I'm getting more into folk music these days and after seeing Jethro Tull live and am about to see Show of Hands, this track shows how much English folk music has been forgotten.  We need more of these sort of things.  John Wetton's voice is so versatile and superbly suits this style.  'I Believe' has a great start and carries on with a lovely foot-tapping, head-nodding beat.  Its what I'd call Driving Rock.  And I agree with other reviewers who state this should have been the album closer.<br /><br />Finally a bit of a let down with 'I Don't Wanna Lose You Now', (2/5).  Its a comfy pipe and slippers sort of song that really doesn't do much and this should never have been an album closer.e (2/5); 'Light The Way' had an average sounding melody and a harsh beat to the song which I found a little jarring.

B000RZIGUY|5.0|Sean Archer (Travolta) has been trying to hunt down his son's killer, an infamous terrorist named Castor Troy (Cage), for six years. Now, Troy has activated a bomb that would destroy a large portion of Los Angeles, and the only ones who know the exact location are him and his brother Pollux (Nivola). When Troy is knocked out and put in a coma, there is very little development in knowing where the bomb is supposed to be. Archer has only one chance in getting the information from the sociopathic Pollux, but his own brother is the only one he can trust. This leads to a highly secretive surgical procedure, in which Sean Archer \\"becomes\\" Castor Troy. After the surgery, there is hardly any difference: the hero looks exactly like his rival. And since this movie requires a whole lot of suspense, the story takes a vicious turn as the real Castor Troy miraculously comes out of his coma, and forces the doctors who were responsible for the operation to help him \\"become\\" Archer. Soon, \\"Archer\\" revels in his rival's family life, while \\"Troy\\" adapts himself into his rival's criminal life.<br /><br />Yes, the plot may be a bit implausible, but I think that's beside the point. What we have here is not only an explosive action film, but also a distinctive human drama. We see how this secret surgical procedure affects both men's careers, companions, and loved ones. And the drama mixes very well with the action scenes, which are some of the best ever filmed. Director John Woo has done a superb job with this one. Bullets and shells fly everywhere, cars and boats explode, people are jumping from here to there, it's almost insane! And yet, Woo and the screenwriters still give us time to breath with some dramatic scenes involving the chemistry between both main & supporting characters. Almost every scene involving action and drama is contrasted perfectly. Again, the plot isn't entirely realistic, but what really matters here are the high-octane action and the effective drama. Congratulations to Woo, Travolta, Cage, Allen, the supporting cast, the stuntmen, and the entire crew that worked on this film.<br /><br />Grade: A-o, Travolta, Cage, Allen, the supporting cast, the stuntmen, and the entire crew that worked on this film.

B00003CWNR|4.0|This story touches on various important themes - rites of passage, freedom vs. responsibility, etc. - but like certain real life events or lessons, it's one of those things that you experience and then move on. This is not a movie for watching over and over. That would be missing the point. I saw it once, enjoyed it very much, and invite you to do the same.

My belief is that the strong mathematical content on high school inhibts, or even block the mind in formation of high school students.     This book is different, this gives a flavour of \\"what is Chemistry\\", and raises the curiosity sense of people to dive into the subject even further, in my view this is the type of book that should be adopted in high school. I am really thinking on contacting the authors and translate this book myself into my native language.    I saw some reviews criticizing the low technical content of the book, and in my view this is a mistake, the book has inumerous information that connects people's life with average things, even the quantum Physics page with the different probabilistic curves of electron positions is exactly what average people should know about it. Thís book is not aiming readers like me, however is one of the books that I most use to address to friends, co-workers and nephews some of the wonderfull things that Chemistry brings to society, it's around us.     And in top of all, have never seen so many great pictures in a science book, as I have seen in this one.
0316017922|4.0|The book came within the timeframe mentioned.  It was new and intact, however, some of the latter pages were creased at the top, probably from some other weight being placed on top of it.  The pages weren't ripped nor was the actual content impaired, but still.  All in all, it's a good and interesting book, and for that price, it was good enough.
B00242KCWS|1.0|This album is nothing special and sounds like Ozzy demo's which they more than likely are.  LAME!
B001HN694K|5.0|I was prepared not to like this film. I am not a Tim Burton fan, nor did I have fond memories of Alice In Wonderland. I was surprised at how entertaining this was & it is visually spectacular.
B00005N5RM|4.0|Breathe, while you still have time to scream.  This is a great updated remake of the original (it's an \\"updated movie\\" if 1988 fx can still hold water). This is a great substitute for the original since a lot of 50's movies won't hold a new crowd since they generally are black and white, a little too sweet, and have pie plates on strings for UFOs ( thank you Ed Wood! ).          This one can hold its own. It has violence, but not gratuitous, and some language, again not too much. It also has a nice eery feel and takes place mostly at night.  This is definitely one for the teenage horror fan collection that can be taken out and savored every now and then.        This one fits in well in the category of John Carpenter's The Thing.
B0000AK7AB|5.0|This is by far the best film ever.  I love this story.  The characters, the soundtrack, the location.  WOW!  A great addition to your family collection at home!
B00005JKG7|5.0|This is just a great movie for all to see. It has an \\"R\\" rating, and I cannot understand why.    Language - NOPE.  Nudity   - NOPE. ( Jaime Lee, tisk, tisk)  Gore     - NOPE.  Violence - Not really. Read more.    Somehow the mood of the film and the editing of the film successfully set up a book like quality allowing the viewer's mind to fill in the blanks with bloodier and more violent imagery than actually was filmed.    I've seen this four times, the last with my 12yo niece who loves the horror genre. She agrees that the film is actually pretty tame but leaves a pretty solid felling of uneasiness long after.
B003BYYDXW|5.0|My world 2.0 is a brilliant album! Justin Bieber is an extremely talented guy and he deserves credit for his hard work. This album truly expresses what every teenager feels and his music has a true meaning to it. I would strongly recommend this album to anyone of any age group because i belieb (sorry i couldn't resist) that everyone can relate to it :) <3 xx
0894803123|4.0|I bought this along with a KitchenAid Ice Cream maker attachment, and I'm glad I did. The recipies are clearly written and easy to follow, and offer alternatives if you have issues with certain ingredients. It takes a little while to realize that there really aren't that many recipies in the book, but almost all of them are easily modified or adapted, something the authors frequently encourage.  Recommended.

1400064287|5.0|I am a solo entrepreneur. This book is amazing for getting me to better communicate what it is I do. If you tell them three things, they will remember nothing. I had three bullet points on the home page of my web site. Get people to experience the problem you are solving vs. telling them the solution. Now, I do.    My business has done better since I implemented ideas from this book. Read it, ponder it and implement it in your small business.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|My adult daughter recommended the book to me and I was attracted to the mind-bending premise of an annual \\"games\\" that killed 23 of 24 young people involved in it.<br />As I got into the book, I could not put it down. Suzanne Collins' prose is wonderfully spare and to the point.  Her story, examining a plausible future, is an achievement of imagination and insightful social commentary. And to top it off, it's a tremendously-engaging thriller with unlikely heroes who are anything but perfect.<br /><br />Three cheers for The Hunger Games!

0316017922|5.0|I recently read Outliers; The Story of Success by Malcolm Gladwell. I enjoyed this book even more than Gladwell's other books, The Tipping Point and Blink, which is really saying a lot. Gladwell  is a journalist by trade, writing for the New Yorker magazine since 1996 and a reporter for the Washington post before that. I think this background gives him a writing style that makes it easy for me to become fully engaged; I end up loosing myself in his writing. As a result, I find that I read through his books quickly, unwilling to set them aside for a time, like I am with many other non-fiction books.    Outliers is all about how successful people are made. It dispels the myth that success is all about luck or even about being extraordinarily smart. Instead, Gladwell shows, success is a combination of opportunity and practice. Gladwell also points out that our heritage plays a significant role in our abilities. However, if we acknowledge our heritage, we can overcome its potential pitfalls rise above it.    Throughout the book, Gladwell looks at well know figures' (like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and The Beatles) paths toward success alongside people I'd never heard of including a group of genius kids, a school girl from the Bronx, and Korean pilots.    After reflecting on this book for a few weeks, I am left with a few nuggets that I'll take with me:  1. Success is a combination of opportunity and hard work. Neither alone is enough.  2. If you want to be truly good at something, do it for 10,000 hours.  3. Be careful not to underestimate how much your heritage / cultural legacy impacts you. Instead, know thyself- understand what your negative tendencies are and learn to correct for them.    In the end, I am a fan of Malcolm Gladwell and look forward to his next book.  --------------  Like my review? Find more at [...]
B002VECM6S|5.0|My wife and I watch this movie last month on PPV, and we loved it. The best part about it, is that it was based on a true story. I knew a lot of young guys like this when I lived in San Antonio, and any one of them would have loved to have the help this man had. Its great to see someone stand up for someone like this, and have it turn out to be a great thing in the end. Sandra Bullock really did a great job in this role, and derserves any of the honors she got for it. I would recommend this for any family, as it is a great family movie, not just one for adults, but for the whole family. You all hit a homerun with this movie.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This a series with great acting, and a great story. I liked that it gives a depth to the people behind the history, and the dynamics of the people.  There was a real authenticity derived from the resource of the original letters of the people involved. I particularly liked the portrayal of Abigail Adams, played by Laura Linney. But she had a great character to play. I would like to read more about Abigail Adams.  The music score was excellent, and overall it is highly recommended as not only a great story, but a factual history of the birth of the American nation.  The DVDs are region 1 locked, but play ok on my 'all region' DVD players here in Australia.
0061743526|4.0|No doubt, over the decades, many people have written fine summaries and analyses of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", the novel.  And so I shall refrain from writing one.  Suffice it to say that it is one of my favorite novels.  I think that reviews of the \\"50th Anniversary Edition\\" should not so much be about the story as it should be about the edition.  Here are my observations:    The cover is nice.  Nothing is wrong with it.    The pages have a deckled (ragged) edge, on the side that is opposite the spine.    The copyright page does not indicate as to whether or not the paper is acid-free.  The paper does not seem to be acid-free, but I could be wrong about this.    The print on each page is consistently dark, and this is good.  The font size is sufficiently large.    In terms of content besides the novel itself, there is nothing special.  It has a one-paragraph foreword that was written by Harper Lee in 1993.  In the foreword, she requested that no introduction ever be written for her novel.    In short, I give five stars to Harper Lee for her novel, and three stars for this particular edition (because I suspect that the paper is not acid-free and because I don't particularly like deckled edges), yielding an average of four stars.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|Its surprising how some books get turned into feature-length movies almost annually, such as Alice in Wonderland, while other books rarely get the big-screen treatment maybe once a generation.  The Sherlock Holmes stories are a great example of the latter.  Written for both adult and teenage audiences, they are found in every library, yet outside of the occasional PBS special, I've never seen a recent movie based on any of the books.  But Hollywood finally caught up, and produced a very good movie near the end of 2009.  Framed as the beginning of a movie franchise, this movie does not spare any expense.  It features a cast full of stars such as Robert Downey Jr., Rachel McAdams, and Jude Law.  There are great special effects, an original soundtrack, solid costume and set design, and very believable action scenes.  The best part of the movie however is the plot; you the viewer figure it out as Sherlock Holmes figures it out.  This keeps up the suspense level.  All in all, a great movie; I'm surprised it did not do better at the theaters.
B00008XEOI|4.0|I grew up watching the Lion King.  So when I decided to buy it on DVD, I went all out and got the collector's series gift set, with the special edition DVD.  Love the film but didn't really care for the added digital mastering, including the new song by Zazu (Morning Report) when Simba is learning to pounce.  That song left a particular bad vibe as the producer's screw up an epic film.  I still favor the scratchy VHS original, but the case, story book, and original artist drawings included with the set are a nice touch and a must have of any true fan.
193413712X|2.0|I was excited to read Tinkers, since it just won the Pulitzer Prize. Plus, Marilynne Robinson loved this book, and I love her books, so I came to it with high expectations. I'm sorry to say that, for me, the book was disappointing.  While acknowledging the author's undeniable verbal skill and originality, and accepting that the book must speak in a vivid way to some readers, I have to say that the book as a whole struck me as depressing and overwrought. It lacks the quiet wisdom and subtlety of Gilead and Robinson's other works. The book is punctuated with otherworldly pyrotechnics, but I searched in vain for the profound simplicity that lies at the heart of authentic spiritual experience. The author's art is intermittently dazzling but ultimately fragmented; the vision is poignant and humane but incomplete. That said, I will watch with interest to see where this clearly gifted novelist goes next, after this remarkable but flawed debut.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|I have used the V2 range finder now for 3 weeks, playing golf at least 3 times a week.  I have found the V2 to be extremely accurate, versatile, light weight, compact, and easy to use.  I also have a Sky Caddie to compare distances, and the V2 is right on every time.  I am a 5 handicapper, and I've found this device to be perfect for my needs.  I purchased this model because I had read other reviews that the more expensive models with more features and 7x power were not as compact and easy to use because of the size and having to hold the higher power models very steady when looking through the viewfinder.  The Sky Caddie gives faster readouts, naturally, so I use it most of the time; however, it still has a $50 annual renewal, requires periodic charging (about every 4th round), and new courses have to be downloaded.  I think most players would do fine with just the V2.
0140187650|4.0|I bought this book because it was required for one of my classes. Personally, I found that the style of writing was pretty hard to follow and understand. In general, the sentences are extremely long and several ideas are connected with a string of commas, dashes, and semicolons. However, Arendt makes really great arguments that are definitely worth the time.
B000FIMG68|5.0|This is the whole premise of lost! They will keep answering questions only to cause more confusion! Season 2 really turns on the mystery juice and introduces the damn hatch! That hatch was so freaking annoying, but it does lead to some excellent plot elements and characters. Oh and we get to see if they were any other survivors or not. If you're a lost fan, chances are you already know what happens here but if you're new to it (like i was) then keep going it only gets better and more frustrating.
1416914307|4.0|It could use without being TOO descriptive though. Made it hard for me to follow and create my own version of the author's world. I just need at least three or four things about how the place looks like and i've got the rest of the picture in my head but the author had to describe the whole place like in one or two paragraphs and by the end of those paragraphs I already forgot what she was describing.

B000FVQLRA|5.0|Seeing the name Roman Polanski has become quite common nowadays, but that attention is focused more on his private life than the films he has directed over the years. The Pianist is one of his most celebrated films, winning 3 Academy Awards including one for Polanski as Best Director. It also won the Palme d'or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2002. The Pianist is a Holocaust film, based on the autobiography of pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. Roman Polanski survived the Holocaust and this was obviously a personal project for him; I think his personal history is (for once) relevant to the film, because his background makes him very aware of the Holocaust and the horrors that accompanied it.    The film begins in Warsaw, 1939 as Great Britain declares war on Nazi Germany. Wladyslaw \\"Wladek\\" Szpilman, a highly lauded pianist and his Jewish family see their happy existence crumble around them, as Germany's invasion of Poland is well under way.. They're required to wear armbands identifying themselves as Jews and soon are evacuated from Warsaw into a Jewish district.    There's not much more that needs to be said about the plot. Unlike many Holocaust movies, The Pianist gives a very in-depth look at the day-to-day life of Jews in the Jewish ghettos. What makes this so impactful is the way Polanski lets the story unfold. We know where the story is going, while Szpilman and his family do not...Yet, we're just as shocked as they are when things go from bad to worse. Don't think from what I've said that The Pianist is just another history lesson...There's a deeply human, intriguing story that draws you in and can be quite suspenseful.    The film itself is incredibly well-made and I applaud Polanski for re-visiting the unspeakable horrors that he lived through. There are scenes that are shockingly horrifying and they are filmed with an unflinching honesty. Polanski almost always keeps his camera detached from the action, making the audience feel like a helpless onlooker. In one ofthe film's most devastating scenes, Wladek is separated from his family as they're put on a train to what will be certain death. It's not only fantastic on a cinematic level, but an emotional one as well.    Adrian Brody won the Best Actor Academy Award for his performance as Wladek and he really did deserve it. He gives a believable, low-key performance completely without ego or bravado. Its perfection and power come from how human it is and his ability to never seem like he's acting. Brody IS Wladek Szpilman in this film.    Movies don't come more powerful than this film. It's a beautiful, heart-breaking, suspenseful film with one of the decade's greatest performances and one of the world's greatest directors.  There's a scene towards the end that is one of the most profound and powerful in the entire film...And it's just a man playing piano. It's a perfect example of how thoroughly Brody portrays Wladek, but also a testament to what an amazing director Polanski is. The Pianist is one of the greatest films ever made about the Holocaust, but it's also one of the greatest films ever made. It's an absolute triumph that shouldn't be missed.    GRADE: A
0307473465|5.0|While at the dentist office recently the hygienist and I disagreed on the timeline of the movie-The Reader- we had both seen. She insisted the movie opened at the time WWll was still in progress. I stated that the early events took place in post-war Germany. I ordered the book to read the sequence of the action. I was correct! I can't wait for my next appointment with my hygienist. I will give her the book to read.  I'm glad I have my own copy of the book. It is a good read as well as a great movie. The moral dilemmas make you examine your own  possible course of action, given the circumstances.  Having the opportunity to purchase the used book in excellent condition on Amazon is a real plus.

0061914177|5.0|I want to start out by saying that I read ALLOT of the reviews on this website and other websites about this book  allot of positives and some negatives. While I very much appreciate and value the opinions of others like myself who enjoy books like this, I have to say that I think allot of people are missing  the point of this book and other books like it. You should not buy a book and expect to get rich overnight or that the ideas will solve all of your life or financial problems. Gary,and people just like him, are simply sharing a story of how \\"they\\" became successful and the process \\"they\\" took. Does that maean the exact same process will work for you? No, does it mean it MIGHT or COULD work for you? Absolutley! Most people finish reading a book and say \\" I don' get it?\\"  and then get mad or frustrated then write reveiws on how it's a scam or just another get rich quick plan that does not work. Perhaps you need to read it again. When you first learned algebra in high school were you perfect at it the very first time you learned it? It highly doubt it. How many times have you watched a movie and saw something the second time that you did not see the first? The first time I read think and grow rich I was totally confused. After buying the audio version and reading the book again 2 more times , I finally got it. As I right this review this book is selling for $10.99. So the question you should be asking is NOT is this book going to make me a billionaire? You should be asking yourself, did you find or come across an idea in this book worth $10.99? I know I have already found one.  There is an old success rule out there that goes like this; If you want to be successful , find someone in the field that you want to be working in who is already successful and do what they did. I know for myself that rule has worked for me in the past. I doubled my income in one year by following that rule. So you should appreaciate when successful people share their \\"hows\\" of success. All their ideas may not work for you  , but what if just one of them did? I do not know Gary or work for him and I am not affiliated with him in any way shape or form. In fact this is the first time I have ever wrote a review on a website. I just get tired of people writing  bad reviews on books that do not deserve to be written simply becasue the reader was expecting the \\"quantum leap\\" to success and did not get it.<br />My thanks are for Gary and all the successful people in this world who take time out to share their story with the rest of us.ll their ideas may not work for you  , but what if just one of them did?

B0034G4OWM|4.0|I thought this movie was cute and perfect to watch with your kids. I honestly don't know why it has such low ratings. It's very funny. Brendan Fraser stars as a real estate developer named Dan Sanders who is planning to tear down the forest and build a mall. The animals of the forest soon decide to take matters into their own paws and make Dan's life miserable, until he realizes what they want. Dan's wife, Tammy doesn't believe him about the animals, and insists that he gets therapy. During an eco friendly fair, the animals will have their revenge against the man who is making Dan destroy the forest. If you love comedies, and children's movies, you'll love FURRY VENGEANCE!!!
B000LC55F2|1.0|Vat's vit this facockta movie already?  Now he's over here, now he's over there.  Please, another headache I don't need!    This one in the movie has a twin brother, and they're both in business together. ... Big mistake. ... I went into business with my brother-in-law.  We opened up a kosher delicatessan in Scrotumville, South Dakota.  Goyim for as far as the eye could see   -- but, what the hell, we took a chance.    One day -- talk about your \\"Transporter Man\\" -- my brother-in-law absconded with all the funds -- *and* the waitress -- *and* the transporter -- *and* the money -- to Prickly Heat, Ecuador.      This was some feency-schmeency transporter, I wanna tell ya.         So anyway, what do you care about my problems.  About me, Yasha J. Banana, the oldest living Amazon reviewer (if you call this living), trust me, you could care less.      Am I right?  Have I struck the nail on the head?      I must say that although I didn't care for this flicker, I was intrigued by the fact that twin brothers were romancing two beautiful women at the same time -- and both gals thought it was the same guy! ... Or was it one guy romancing two women?  Or were the two women schtupping each other on the side?      Who knows with this cockamammie movie!  What do I care about magic tricks?  They couldn't have let us at least *once* have a good look at Scarlett Johannsen's tukas?  Put a G-strong on that shiksa, brother, and I'm a happy nonogenarian!      Personally, when it comes to schtupping though I, Yasha J. Banana --flute-tuner, hat blocker and one-time towel boy at Plato's Retreat   -- I recommend FULL DISCLOSURE!  You have a twin brother, you make sure your girlfriend knows who's who.  Either that or establish an odd day/even day arrangement.  Or you both eat onions.    Now on with my review ...     See, this one magician gets a machine that he uses to clone himself.  Once this happens, *everybody* in the film gets so excited!  The director can't believe it: \\"A machine thatcan close one of my actors.\\"  He goes nuts.  But rather than tell the audience in clear, simple language: \\"This guy has a machine that clones himself\\" -- oh no, this mensch of a director keeps us guessing for the entire movie.      If I could, I would have given him such a kick.    Can you imagine if I had such a machine -- a machine that could clone 97-year-old Jews.  Yasha J. Bananas all over the place!  Ho boy!      What a comeback the Catskills would make.     Depends' stock would go through the roof.      On every street corner you'd hear people say: \\"Yasha, boychick, so nice to see you. ... Again.\\"    I'd clone myself night and day and day and night -- and have each of my clones do the same thing.  Pretty soon there'd be so many  Yasha Bananas, there's be a \\"Yashaville\\" city; then a Yasha County; then they'd have to recognize me, Yasha J. Banana, as a sovereign nation.       Then there'd be spinoff nations -- Inner Yasha, Outer Yasha, Upper Yasha, East Yasha, West Yasha.      Pretty soon I, Yasha J. Banana, would go global.  I'd start moving into your neighborhood, knocking on your door asking if you want to give to the U.J.A..  And if you refused, I'd be back, and back, and back.    There'd be so many of me, I'd be able to elect politicians, fill stadiums, surround the Rockettes.      I, Yasha J. Banana, would be *everywhere.*  Eventually I'd go into business and make a fortune selling myself whatever crap I wanted to sell myself.  All sales final.    I'd start a religion.  The entire congregation would be me, Yasha J. Banana.  We'd all walk to services on Saturday singing, \\"We Are The Jews!  We are the world!\\"      I'd have a fund-raising drive.  Another fortune!  I'd make those ganefs at the 700 Club look like pikers.    Of course, naturally, at 97-years-old, all us Yasha J. Bananas would, alas, be dying off.  But think of it, the morticians would be in heaven!  Little kids would beg their parents to send them to morticians school.  \\"Eulogies 101\\" would become a require course in all colleges and universities. ... Goddammit, we'd be dying like flies! ... As I said to Sophie Tucker when I asked her to stand on a mirror back in 1937: I can see it all now -- traffic jams filled with hearses and grieving widows.  All over the world, hundreds of thousands of 97-year-old Yasha J. Bananas, clutching their hearts, rolling their eyes to the heavens (\\"This is the Big One, Elizabeth!  I'm comin' to join ya.\\")  The smell of Ben-Gay mingling with rotting flesh.  Shuffleboard courts littered with 97-year-old carcasses.  Social Security belly up.      Of course naturally you might say, \\"But Yash, bubi, boychick, wouldn't you want to use your ability to clone yourself for the *good* of others?  What about ... the brotherhood of man? What about ... uplifting the human condition?  What about everyone, not just Yasha J. Banana clones but *everyone* holding hands and singing Cumbaya.  Yash, come on now, what about justice, what about ... the people?\\"          And do you know what I say to that -- FARK THE PEOPLE!      Where were the people, where were the customers when I opened up my kosher delicatessan in Scrotumville, South Dakota and nobody went for my \\"Sheep Dip Surprise\\"?  Or my \\"Gourmet Goyim Gefilte Fish.\\"      Fark the people!  And the cavalry they rode in on!      Let 'em get their own cloning machine.      Before long Yasha J. Bananas will be ruling the world!  Uber Yasha!  Viva La Revolution!  Pastrami on rye for all you Bananas!    Your pal,    Yash
B002ZRPQ5K|2.0|When did Keane become an 80's pop band? When Keane first emerged with Hopes and Fears, they were unique and modern. Under The Iron Sea was an incredible follow-up album. After that, they released Perfect Symmetry which was half 80's pop and half beautiful modern music.<br /><br />This album is unfortunately an extension of the 80's pop half of Perfect Symmetry. Between the cheesy synthesizer sounds and the electronic drums, this is just not the Keane I was looking forward to hearing. I hope their next album will be a step in a better direction, but I fear we've lost Keane to this new, yet out-dated style.

B0031RAOW8|5.0|this extremely well done film is about loyalty.  something that is in short supply in our daily lives and is evidenced by many of us who have animals.  though this story is unique, it shows the love and dedication of an animal to his companion/owner.  a short while ago i was watching jerry maguire,  one of my favorites, and when cuba goodings asks tom cruise why he got married,  he answers, she was loyal.  weather it's to your wife, family, and yes your animals,  loyalty is the ultimate sign of love.
B0002V4SXC|5.0|This is a well mastered sacd, It really makes for a big sound, tonally sweet,well balanced, I enjoy it, first time that I have heard the songs, but they are good and I bet that the regular CD sounds pretty good too. My SACD collection is up to about 9, got an Oppodigital universal disc player a couple of years ago and it makes normal CDs sound great and it plays SACDs,HDCDS,DVDA, plus any other type of Disc that you can put in it. Only change that I made on this 168 dollar player is I put a bigger power cord on it.
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 is almost unquestionably one of the funniest books ever written, but there is a depth to it that forces it to resist categorization as simply a humor piece.  It satirizes war in a way that's more condemnatory than most \\"serious\\" novels could ever dream of.  The absurdity of it all makes it almost nightmarish; nothing is what it seems, which I guess is a pretty accurate general description of war.    I've read Catch-22 from start to finish a couple of times, but my favorite aspect of it is that it really doesn't even have to be read in order.  There's no telling how many times I've seen something that reminded me of Appleby or Major Major Major, and I'll just pick up my copy and read their particular chapters, always amazed at how well they function as self-contained stories.  In short, this is one of my all-time favorite novels, and I feel that its scope is broad enough to appeal to just about everyone.
B003EPPEP4|2.0|I first heard Nikki on the PBS program, from the top. I was blown away by her enthusiasm & talent. I bought her Ella, of thee I swing. I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, I am not impressed with the production values of this album. I'm not sure who her producer is, but I think they missed the mark. Nikki, please buy live at blues alley by Eva Cassidy. To your own self be true. You will understand once you hear Eva, who is sadly, no longer with us.
B00005MP58|3.0|This movie was okay, but the newer version with Kiera Knightly was the best.  The casting was not good.  I thought \\"Lizzy\\" was too light-hearted and not dramatic enough.  The casting of her sister, Jane, was especially disappointing because she is supposed to be the \\"beauty\\" in the family, and the actress was not, no offense.  I watched it once but won't watch it again.  Better to rent if you must.
1416575464|5.0|For starters, I purchased this book on Amazon because it is way cheaper here than in a specialty store. I love the layout of this book, it's very informative with lots of beautiful photographs and illustrations. I definitely recommend it if you like creative, somewhat vintage and antique with a little contemporary all mixed in one. If you didn't know anything about decorating before, you should know plenty after picking this up!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I loved this movie and have watched it over and over.  It really meets the expectations of the book.  I even liked the ending better than the book.  Very romantic.  Kiera Knightly was an excellent \\"Lizzy\\" and the other characters fit the parts really well.  I highly recommend this movie.
0195145925|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of the most misunderstood books on Amazon. A lot of the reviewer expect the same pseudo-scientific, philosophizing, feel good, new age mumbo jumbo so prevalent and highly rated.<br /><br />They are rightly disappointed, since this was not the aim of this book.<br /><br />In fact what Barbour tries here is to make a case for finding the basic principles underlying one of the most successful modern physical theory: the general relativity. In fact he manages to establish this connection making \\"The End of Time\\" one the most meaty popular science books of all times.<br /><br />It is true that Barbour does don't convincingly explains the psychological illusion of time in a timeless universe, but it would be foolish to expect that, since the problem of qualia is still an elusive, poorly understood interdisciplinary concept. Still, this shortcoming does not make the book any less intriguing.<br /><br />The only irritating aspect of the book was the narcissistic attitude of the author. He has not decided whether he writes a popular science book or an biography of himself (I don't use the word autobiography, as he praises himself as if he would be a different person.)<br /><br />Still I give this book 5 stars, since it is extremely well written and Barbour makes an excellent job to make a very hard technical topic intuitive and accessible. The only reason he seems to fail is simply the very modest average intellectual capability of the general audience.<br /><br />For example, a lot of the layman reviewers attack the notion of timelessness, which is in fact does not originate from Barbour but is a most mainstream view among all self-respecting physicists. The notion that the arrow of time is a consequence of the entropy increase in the state-space is neither new, nor very controversial.<br /><br />What's a new however is that the topology of Einstein's space-time manifold is naturally glued together from disjoint three dimensional moments based ona similarity metric alone is not widely recognized.I think this is a very fundamental and interesting insight, which deserves a good deal of thoughts. This conclusion of his, however is not a subjective opinion, but a well defined mathematical statement proven by Barbour and his coauthors.
B002BGLP2I|5.0|Notting Hill is a colorful district of London west of Bayswater, more Bohemian in the 1980s than its fashionable and affluent modern face might suggest. This unlikely metropolitan enclave was the inspiration for the \\"Notting Hillbillies\\" moniker chosen for this superb bluegrass-country band formed by Mark Knopfler together with Steve Phillips, Guy Fletcher and Brendan Croker in 1988. Knopfler's idea was to create a kind of counterpoint to the then enormously successful Dire Straits: a laid-back, guitar-based country band which could play smaller and more intimate venues and which might attract a slightly different audience. \\"Missing\\" is the only album the band ever released, and it's a gem.<br /><br />The tracks are a mixture of traditional, mainly American, country/bluegrass numbers and a few new songs by the band members in the same idiom. \\"Your Own Sweet Way\\" is Knopfler's only composition on the album and the only one on which he sings the lead: a slow, harmonious minor-key beauty with a haunting quality all its own. All the songs are good, and the guitar work stands out as truly exceptional. A few of the songs clearly date from the early part of the 20th century and the lyrics are often delightfully innocent and archaic (\\"Workin' on the railroad for a dollar a day, gotta get my money, gotta get my pay...\\").<br /><br />The album has a real laid-back feel and can be listened to any time of day or night. Many of the songs are poignant and all instantly memorable, with vocal harmonies overlayed with understated but virtuoso melodic guitar accompaniments. It never ceases to sooth, to brighten the mood, to bring a smile. It's quality music for all occasions, with a quirky feel all its own, and you'll never tire of it.<br /><br />A second album would have been welcome, but alas \\"Missing\\" was a one-off.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|A cute movie of about a unique friendhsip of little girl and a man who were both in the hospital.  A story telling made both of them and are part of the characters, too. I love their scenes and customs.  I recommend this to all!! Enjoy watching as much as I did.

B001NXDIMK|5.0|Season 2 of \\"Damages\\" picks up right where Season 1 left off, with fallout from the Frobisher case lingering.  In season 2, a new case is introduced involving an energy corporation and its nefarious CEO, played smashingly well by John Doman.  William Hurt, Marcia Gay Harden and Timothy Olyphant join the cast.<br /><br />In season 2, the show is still excellent, but the plot is somewhat more convoluted that it was in season 1.  While convolution, in my book, generally adds a welcome layer of depth, mystery and complexity to a show, in this instance it brought some confusion with it, particularly with regard to a character named Dave Pell who's trying to get Patty Hewes' husband Phil Grey to become energy commissioner.  Since I watched the show on DVD, I didn't have much down time between episodes, so confusion was minimized.  If I'd spaced out the viewing, however, I might have gotten lost.  So, when you're watching, pay attention to Dave Pell and how's he's involved.<br /><br />Although Ted Danson is in season 2, he's not what I would consider to be a main character and he is sorely missed. The seeds of Arthur Frobisher's continued presence in the show are, however, planted in season 2 as he seeks clarity and attempts to build a new business.<br /><br />Some of the best TV out there.
B0036EH3UC|3.0|I am a science fiction movie and TV fan.  This series is not what I expected it to be.  It is an interesting series with beautiful CG special effects, excellent actors and actresses. Unfortunately the sub-story lines got stretched at places and cease to make sense.  Whenever the plot gets stuck it brought in \\"gods will\\". I will not list the inconsistencies here because it is not the purpose of my review. The inconsistencies became more obvious when you watch the entire series continuously, as if the writers made up the main and sub plots only as the series progressed. The entire series is full of confused human and cylon trying to find themselves.  Throughout the series you see human and cylon hallucinate as if they were all on dope. The series tried to take on too many serious issues and had too much preaching. There were so many sleeper cylons living among the humans, the entire Galatica fleet should have been wiped out before the 3rd season ends as I think it should. Vulgarity was taken as being cool to the extend it is affecting some of the reviewers. The mood of the series is too dark for my liking.  The only way to enjoy this series is to shut off one's logic. I do not find this series entertaining. If you are into dark science fiction type of stories, you may like it.  Just do not expect it to be like Star Trek, Dune, Babylon 5, Stargate or even the original Battlestar Galatica.    A word on the DVD set picture quality.  The picture quality overall is good.  My dvd player is a Pioneer BlueRay BDP-51FD.  With upscaling the picture quality in general looks excellent on a Phillips 47\\" 9000 series LCD TV.  I don't find it necessary to own everything in Blue Ray.
B0013JG7IQ|5.0|Kenneth Branagh and Stephen Fry have reworked Mozart's strange but beautiful comic opera \\"The Magic Flute\\" as an anti-war story set in the first world war. The music and acting are brilliant: aspects of the revised story are very peculiar (though no more so than the original) but in general it is both beautiful and entertaining.     In the original story, the hero Tamino (Joseph Kaiser) is a prince: here he is a junior officer in the army of some unidentified European power, and at the start of the film he and his men are sent \\"over the top\\" in an attack on the enemy trenches.     Where the 18th century opera had the hero attacked by a serpent and rescued by three ladies, in this version the ladies (Teuta Koco, Louise Callinan, and Kim-Marie Woodhouse) appear, initially, as nurses and rescue him from a cloud of poison gas. Recovering consciousness, he finds himself in a slightly different World War One trench system, where he meets the \\"bird man\\" Papageno (brilliantly sung and acted by Benjamin Jay Davies.) In this version the bird man uses his feathered friends to check for clean air: as in the original he also provides companionship to the hero and comic relief.     On the front where the hero now finds himself, the opposing armies are those of the Queen of the Night (Lyubov Petrova) and the sorceror Sarastro (Rene Pape), and it does not become obvious for some time which represents good and which is evil. The Queen makes her grand entrance on top of a Mark V tank and begs Tamino to rescue her daughter, Pamino (Amy Carson) who is being held prisoner in the fortress of Sarastro. Tamino and Papageno set off to rescue her, but it is soon apparent that in this magic world few things are what they seem ...     Director Kenneth Branagh, who co-wrote the screenplay with Stephen Fry, has removed most of Mozart's masonic symbolism, though not quite all, and replaced it with imagery reflecting the horror and waste of war. Stephen Fry produced a new English libretto to reflect this. For example, the song which in the original has the lyrics \\"O Isis and Osiris\\" has been given completely new words to fit a commemoration of the dead, which is taking place in a war cemetary, with a message pleading for peace.     One aspect which has been changed hardly at all is Papageno's desperate desire to find the girl of his dreams, Papagena (Silvia Moi) and their eventual meeting is brilliantly funny.     \\"The Magic Flute\\" contains perhaps the most beautiful song ever written for the human voice, the Queen of the Night's aria, which in context is also one of the most shocking things ever written. I presume Lyubov Petrova must have first recorded this in a studio and then mimed to her own voice while filming: both her singing and acting are first rate, and this scene is both psychedelic and truly horrifying.     Nobody with more imagination than a stone ever forgets the first time they see this aria performed in context and those watching this DVD who have not previously seen a stage or film version of \\"The Magic Flute\\" will find it no exception - it will sear itself into your memory.     Parts of the opera, like the original, are pretty nonsensical, but it worked for me. The singing, both from the main performers and the backing from the Chorus Apollo Voices, was excellent throughout, as was the Chamber Orchestra of Europe. Special Effects were very cleverly done.     I agree with those reviewers who thought that subtitles would have been useful: the male performers were without exception easy to follow and I didn't have too much difficulty making out what Amy Carson as Pamina or Silvia Moi as Papagena were singing. However, Mozart's music, beautiful as it is, makes extreme demands on the voice in certain places, particularly for the Queen of the Night and the three ladies, and there were certainly sections where I had difficulty making out the new words which Stephen Fry had written for these characters.     Nevertheless, I enjoyed this version.If you are a fan of Mozart in general or the Magic Flute in particular, buy or rent this, and I think you are most unlikely to regret it.

B0012909NQ|4.0|Buongiorno. It's clearly the best Live DVD that Genesis has made to date.  Two disks that cover the entire concert in Rome from the \\"Turn It On Again\\" tour, and a third disk thats shows a documentary of them planning the tour.  The concert has an amazing lights and FX that supersedes anything they have done in the past.  The stage setting has a modern art rock feel to it, and I thought that the computer graphic images that was propelling on the screen behind them did justice for the excellent music that Genesis was playing flawlessly.  As we all know the saying \\"when in Rome do as the romans do\\" does not fit the description of the Genesis songlist.  If you are more keen to the 70's Genesis I would say that this DVD is more your cup of tea.  The concert does not only play the expected old songs like \\"Firth of The Fifth\\", \\"I Know What You Like\\". Songs like \\"In The Cage\\" is introduced back into their old medley.  Other old  songs that made their way into the list are like Los Endos, Ripples, Carpet Crawlers, Cinema Show, Afterglow, and Duke's instrumentals.  I personally thought that to start the show with Duke's intro, and end the concert with Ripples was not a good choice.  The order of the songs they chose did not work for me.  \\"Turn It On Again\\", which usually is a song they play near the end was their second song.  Their finisher was \\"Invisible Touch\\", which did not suit at all.  I know they have three decades worth of music to satisfy the audience, and it's not an easy job to put this kind of concert together. The \\"We Can't Dance\\" tour flowed better, but one thing that the \\"Turn It On Again\\" tour did boast is their musicianship.  Daryl Stuemer's guitar playing is definitive in this concert.  Even the duo drum solos with Chester Thompson and Phil Collins was much more enjoyable than their previous solos I have seen.  Phil's singing sounds more musical than before, and it seems like everything is lowered by two keys, which does take off the edge a bit, but then again what you get is a pleasant vocal performance.  Mike Rutherford's guitar playing has more of an attack, and his bass playing has more of the youthful energy of early 80's Genesis.  Tony Banks?  Well what can I say?  He always will deliver, and his choice of lead synths sounded more digitally fresh than ever.  The sound of the entire band was clear and the performance was calculated like true professionals.  Now I thought that the stage design made it hard to film this concert.  The actual stage was small, but their whole set was humongous!  The proportion did not make sense.  When they filmed the audience looking at the stage it made it feel as if this concert lost it's intimacy.  It looked like they should have utilized the space more on stage.  It felt as if the band was too crowded together for a concert that has hundreds of thousands of people.  If you are giving the impression that you are playing in a galaxy, than you should be situated as one.  The directing wasn't the best, and the cameras overplayed the audience just a bit.  That being said it's the best filmed Genesis concert to date, cause if anybody has seen the previous released concerts you would agree that the filming and editing was not that good.  You should see the \\"When In Rome 2007\\" concert because of Genesis.  I just hope that this is not the last Genesis tour.  Arriverderci.n again what you get is a pleasant vocal performance.

0345472322|4.0|What separates people who perform consistently well in life from those who don't?  According to psychologist Carol Dweck, it's their mindset.  Dweck identifies two mindsets: the good growth mind-set and the bad fixed-mindset.  The fixed mindset believes that you either got it or you don't. You are either born talented or smart or gifted in some way, or you're not.  Those with this mindset expect success merely from showing up and rely only marginally on preparation, hard work and learning.  Unfortunately, those with a fixed mindset can never afford to fail because this would give the lie to their supposed inborn gifts.  When they do fail, they sulk, feel bad, blame others and don't think about ways to improve.  Eventually they stop taking risks because that may further expose them to failure and its consequences.    In contrast, those with a growth mindset do not believe that success is based on talent alone.  For them, talent is a foundation on which they build.  When people with growth mindsets fail at a task they may feel the same disappointments as those with a fixed mindset, and even become depressed.  But instead of giving up, these people will look for ways to do better the next time because they believe that they are not \\"fixed\\" but can continue to learn and grow.  They remain on a learning curve all their lives, a curve that may have its ups and downs but one that continually rises.    I found the most important advice to be how to approach parenting through a growth mindset by praising the effort more than the talent.  This will help your child develop their own growth mindset as they learn that their abilities are not set in stone, that they can bounce back from a set back and grow from failures.    Dweck's claims, backed up by research and case studies, make sense, although I am always skeptical of any explanation of human behavior that reduces individuals to a few categories, in this case two.  In fairness, Dweck does say that people can jump from one mindset to the other, as she herself admits to.  However, theses like this one always leave me with a sense that complex human behavior has been oversimplified.  For example, there were many other reasons why Enron failed, the mindsets of their top leadership being just one of them, while Dweck's use of Enron as a case study suggests that the growth mindset was the main contributor.    One other infraction: Dweck offers the following individuals as growth mindset models as reflected in their decisions and character: Roger Clemens, Alex Rodriguez and Tiger Woods.  In hindsight, I think she would have preferred to choose other individuals - the first apparently lied to Congress, the second lied about his use of steroids and engaged in extra-marital affairs, the third also cheated on his wife.  Oops.
B0031RAOVY|2.0|My wife and I were really looking forward to viewing this movie as we love animal movies of all kinds, especially dogs.  Hachi is one lovable dog, extremely cute and full of acting ability.  But unfortunately he is the best and only good part of the movie.  The plot is non-existant with a movie that is so slow with no sense of developing the characters of the movie.  Richard Gere does a pretty good job as does his \\"daughter\\", but his wife never warms up to the dog and we never learn why. Rent the movie, but just do not see why one should purchase it.

Although I have to admit, the first hundred to hundred-fifty pages were kind of dull due to the long introduction that Brown write in order to introduce his readers on the background story. However, after suffering from the first hundred pages, the book became fast-paced and highly suspense-oriented. I simply cannot put it down: I even crept up at night to read the book by nitelight. The plot, the characters, and everything were just pieced themselves perfectly together and makes the book so good. Highly recommended for those who still haven't read this.

B0030Y11XS|3.0|This film is entertaining and engaging but is far too slanted to the left and has too much content that is separated from reality for me to want to call it a documentary. There are a lot of comments from laid-off auto workers who are upset that they aren't getting the deal they expected from the auto companies. Welcome to life my friends. Things have changed over the last 50 years.<br /><br />After spending some time watching people being upset with not getting their house paid for or their retirement reinstated, the film just got to be too irritating for me and I turned it off. I'm a registered Democrat and I support much of the left wing agenda. This though has nothing to do with a liberal viewpoint as it does with what I can only imagine is Michael Moore's still bruised ego over having lost his job years ago.
B001E5OKEC|3.0|I recently got into the Jonas Brothers, and the album \\"A Little Bit Longer\\" was the first one of theirs I purchased. When I discovered there was a limited edition with a bonus DVD I decided to get that, too. Also, I'd heard their cover of the Beatles' \\"Hello Goodbye\\" and thought \\"Great, now I'll have it on cd as well!\\" but no. The track is nowhere to be found on the cd, even though it's listed on the back cover of the album. I've come to understand more people have had the same problem and I wish I'd known too, before I placed my order.  But on the other hand... The record's full with fun & catchy pop songs (my personal favourites being Shelf, Lovebug, Tonight and Got Me Going Crazy) and the live performances on the dvd are great, with Demi Lovato's guest appearance being a nice highlight. The \\"JB Rules\\" part is big fun, and a nice glimpse into the world of the JoBro's.

160094048X|4.0|Let me start off by saying that I am not vegan. I am vegetarian, but I am a baker and I like to dabble in vegan baking, as it gives me new challenges and opportunities to try different things. With that said, I am really enjoying this book. Most of the recipes that I have tried have yielded great results, with the end products being very similar or exactly like their non-vegan counterparts. So far I have tried the following recipes from the book:     Chocolate Chip Cookies: Being as Chocolate Chip Cookies are one of my favorites, this was the first recipe that I tried from this book. I wasn't entirely pleased with this recipe. I was sure to follow the directs exactly, but each time I got dough that was so greasy that it wouldn't hold the chocolate chips. What is worse is that once I managed to get the cookies on the tray and baked, there was still a trail of greasiness left behind by the cookies (I know for a fact I did not screw up the measurements, and I also tried the recipe twice adding a little less oil than called for, still no luck).    Oatmeal Raisin Cookies: Good, but I felt like something was missing from them. I think the recipe just needs a little tweaking and then it will be great.    Deluxe Cocoa Brownies: Very good. I made these because I was craving brownies. From what I read in another review, these may be perceived as dry brownies (I guess some may think they look dry in the picture in the book), but there are definitely not. They are moist and so good. I got my dad to try these and he had no idea that they were vegan. My only problem with this recipe is that perhaps they are a bit too cakey for brownies. I know a lot of people who enjoy fudgey brownies more than cakey brownies. If you are looking for a fudgey brownie, this may not be the right recipe for you.    Graham Crackers: Really good, and very similar to store bought graham crackers. I made these and brought them in for my friends in school, and they had no idea that they were vegan. My onefriend thought that I was lying when I said that I made them...haha. For those interested in making them: they are best with the cinnamon sugar on top.    Chocolate Cut-Out Cookies: I liked these, but not enough to keep making them over and over. I didn't think they were anything special.    Gingerbread Cut-Out Cookies: Good, but I feel like they could be a little spicier. Also, I had some problems with the dough being really sticky. I had to add some flour to get it to not stick to everything, so that probably affected the flavor a bit.    All in all, it is a pretty good book. I love the pictures, and the fonts are a fun addition. I also enjoy that it has a section about ingredients and substitutions since some of the ingredients may not be available to people. I would definitely recommend this to vegans and non-vegans alike.
B003BKF696|5.0|This album makes my heart hurt, but in that good way.  It is simply one of the best albums to be released this year, and, as far as I am concerned, in a long, long time.  Pick it up now!
B0036B8MXC|5.0|Begging to differ from one reviewer...this IS for girls/women...don't be so narrow-minded : )<br /><br />So, right of the bat....this is not for the squeemish, nor the prudish! This version of the Spartacus epic is BRUTAL. Brutal is the way life was in the Roman Empire, and for that matter everywhere in the the ancient world. Is this so different today? What I admire about this series is that it is unrelenting! It gives no quarter. Unless you turn the tv/video off, it doesn't give any leeway...you have to face the demons inside all of us!<br /><br />Most people in the privileged countries today have been coddled, pampered, deluded into believing we are \\"civilized\\". The fact is we are ALL only one breath away from what we are forced to view on \\"Spartacus\\"! If you have the tenacity to watch episode after episode, to accept the lesser parts of us, you see we all have a little of ALL the chartacters that inhabit the ludus. Sex, violence, brutality, love, empathy, courage and sacrifice are an integral part of every human being. Deceiving ourselves that we have evolved beyond the circus is miopic.<br /><br />If you love the good old days in Rome, the artistry of the arena, beautiful men and women, the ugly and cruel masses...the intecracies of local politics....IF you have the heart to face your demons...Spartacus is a fantastic journey. Give it a little time and let it wash over you without regret...like the blood into the sand. An odyssey well worth taking!

B003AYPMBU|5.0|my favorite album and it may be because it's to hard to answer. for me is Sad Wings of Destiny ,<br />then British Steel... ive seen Priest 4 times and besides owning the original release ive never seen them do Rapid Fire , Steeler , The Rage , Hell Patrol , Grinder , You Don't Have To Be ... is just so awesome to me. THEN THEY WIN A GRAMMY FOR DISSIDENT AGGRESSOR FROM SIN AFTER SIN. ( by the way , Scott Travis the JP drummer<br />was only 16 when sin after sin came out ). how can i , a totally die hard fan of priest from rocka rolla to this gem. did you notice the absence of pyrotechnics ? do you think they were needed ? i think not. the smiles on their faces (the band )shows even after roughly 36 years of pounding out the best metal of the world. glenn tipton<br />( in the making of british steel ) said he honestly mentioned maybe they should close shop and get regular jobs and remember how hard they tried. but they busted the rear ends day after day and as i said sad wings is my fav<br />album, when british steel came out it was just the right time , the right music , packed stadiums and i'll tell ya that british steal was coming out from the sin after sin release. it was just building the foundation where priest is today. their a super group , but with all the same members. (excluding the drummer revolving door) scott travis fits in perfectly and the puzzle was complete. i hope they never stop playing because i just cant<br />picture that. from what rob halford said is that a new album would probably come in the spring of 2011. he said they needed the rest and a well needed and deserved one while the Metal God is preparing a tour with his own band<br />and of course that's Halford. a great cd cleaned up a bit and a 16 song live concert with the band talking about<br />british steel and how it came to be and they put it out with a $ 12.99 to $ 15.99 is something i cannot , at all ,<br />comprehend. when he thanks the fans we thank judas priest for being around \\" for all the world to see \\".<br />Judas Priest is number one and always will be. thanks for reading.

B002ZRPQ5K|5.0|This EP serves as an excellent sample platter for all that is Keane. From the beginning, this band has dedicated themselves to expanding their horizons and refusing to rely on well-worn paths. Night Train refines the experimentation of Perfect Symmetry while maintaining the beauty of their earlier albums with the latter half of the EP.     House Lights - Sounds like the opening ambiance for their live shows. If the transition from this track into the second were smoother, this track would serve a more blatant purpose...    Back In Time - Engaging synth work. Like early Killers meets Keane, this is a solid opening track. This will be fantastic live.     Stop For a Minute - Bravo to Keane for trying new things. Of the two K'naan tracks, Looking Back has more radio potential.     Clear Skies - Beautiful song. Fantastic guitar hook, well orchestrated and builds effectively. This song should excite older Keane fans greatly.    Ishin Denshin - Listeners will likely scratch their heads at this track if they have no previous experience with Japanese Pop. Light and happy fluff. I can't help but smile when I hear it.    Your Love - Wonderful chord progression and chorus hook. Tim does an admirable job singing. Heavy use of computerized/autotuned voice, but that's generally accepted in the present music scene.    Looking Back - The stronger of the two K'naan collaborations, Tom and K'naan play off each other well, and the blatant use of a Rocky theme emphasizes the lyrical content well.     My Shadow - This track is exciting proof that Keane haven't forgotten how they got here. The closing lyric is unforgettable, and the orchestration is classic Keane.     This album will slowly grow on you, and is a shining example of the band's unique personality.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|When booting up this movie I wasn't especially attentitive as I had no unique expectations for what I assumed was just another \\"science fiction\\" or \\"horror\\" film. I was on the road watching it on my PowerBook. ...Well. What a surprise. This film has stuck with me for months. Subsequently I purchased the Blu-ray version and have watched it in various locations under ideal circumstances. I've recommended it to my movie-loving friends.  The feedback has been amazment, and totally positive. Not only is the CG work flawless, the acting, especially the lead actor, and the direction, all are of the highest level. This is not only a \\"message\\" piece but a fine adventure story of unusual dimentions. It's certainly a different sort of 'adventure' at that. The design of this film give it an immediatcy that never fail from first to last frames. A deep-seated universality in the links between principle elements (initially unimaginable) is not only surprising but positively enriching.- When first asked, by my wife, what I was watching, I just could not say I was watching something about Humans battling 'Alien Prawns' ...I merely said I was catching up on something with Peter Jackson's name on it. Now I'm happy to suggest this picture as a modern classic. And it's ultimate message is nothing less than thought-provoking.
B000002H33|5.0|Ah, the challenge of reviewing a classic album, especially one as influential as this: Metallica's breakout album. It is revered (and despised) in equal amounts throughout the metal world, but you can be sure every metalhead knows about this, and was probably told about it from friends or shows claiming it to be the \\"Best Thrash Metal Album Ever!\\" That's where I disagree: I simply don't think it has enough real \\"thrashy\\" material to be considered a thrash album, let alone be considered the best one ever made. Not to say it's not good, far from it. This is still my favorite Metallica album behind ...And Justice For All, and has some of their best songs on it. However, most of it is very mid-paced, which I think would claim more of a traditional metal label or even doom at some points.    Now, on to the actual music: what you have here is a towering monument to a once-great band's not inconsiderable talent. It showcases some of the band's most catchy-yet-still-undeniably-metal songs, from The Thing That Should Not Be to Damage, Inc., this album is packed with songs that rage with crushing power, Lars Ulrich pounding the skins and providing a heavy backdrop for James' heavy riffs and vocals to tear across, and Kirk soloing like a madman. I think it should be worth mentioning that, even though James isn't exactly a lyrical wordsmith, the best lyrics besides those from Justice are found here, all conveying a mood of loss of control, be it from drug use, Lovecraftian terrors, or insanity, This is some of Mr. Hetfield's best work.    Although I like every song on here, I would like to point out my high points and low points on the album. My favorite song on this album is without a doubt, Battery. This song is just fantastic, roaring along at Mach 10, yet still sticking in your head after a single listen, and having a main riff that makes you instinctively bang your head like a mongoloid doesn't hurt, either. Kirk's leads in this are the icing on the cake, quick and adept,yet still blistering and melodic, this song has some of my favorite guitar playing on display. My least favorite song on the album, however, is Orion. That song alone almost made me take the album down a star. I'm sorry, but the only Metallica instrumental I like is Call of Kutulu, and that's because it has the one thing none of their other instrumentals have; flow. Orion to me just seems like they wrote a ton of riffs (which are, admittedly, good on their own) then slapped them down in random order on tablature, and recorded. It just sounds disorganized, and just misguided. I can tell they were trying to make this an epic testament to their riff-writing ability, but focusing on SONGWRITING should have come first. Their songwriting ability is why I love their early stuff, and they seem to forget that they are adept at it on Orion.    So, despite one overlong instrumental, this album is just cool. I'm just going to leave it at \\"It's a kick-@$$ METAL album,\\" and leave it at that.  Highly Recommended
B002JVWR9U|5.0|When True Blood finale'd for the season I didn't know how I would make it.  But then Vampire Diaries aired and while there is nothing that can take the place of TB, darned if VD doesn't make a perfect companion.  Like a little sister.  Each week it's so blindingly good that I never realize I'm not breathing very much until the commercial comes and I can finally let out a sigh. It actually plays like a movie in the broad sense of the word.  It's like a mini movie every week.  Even watching the reruns is almost as exciting as the first time you saw it. It's just flawless and the only way I'm going to be able to make it when it's on summer hiatus is because True Blood comes back next month thank God.  I still hope they play VD episodes all summer.  Even the thought of being without Elena, Stephan, Damon, Bonnie, Caroline, Matt, Jeremy and even little Ana is more than I can bare.  CAN'T.WAIT.TO.BUY.THE.DVD! And for the record I'm in my late 30s.
076790592X|5.0|This is a book I found very interesting. Mitch Albom gets to know his teacher,who was diagnosed with an illness and was told he was going to die.I found this story very touching.  It made me laugh and cry. Morrie points out so many things in this book, we as people overlook.    Morrie pionts out the simple things in life and shows lots of wisdom throughout the whole book. He trusts Mitch and tells him things, he wouldn't tell everybody else. A very good reminder what a true friend like Mitch was, to Morrie as sometimes it is hard to find that certain someone you can confide in.    I learned alot from this book. I think sometimes in ourlives we are working; so hard to keep up with our busy lives. We don't take the time we should and smell the roses. Life passes us by so quickly.

B0039TD7PY|3.0|If you were into music in the 70's when singer/songwriters dominated it would be hard to escape the music of Carole King or James Taylor. This CD, DVD and Tour, looks to recreate the magic that was present at the Troubadour in the early days. Much is done well, veteran musicians that were icons of the era are backing up the duo, vintage instruments were used and seems there seems to be no post dubbing.     My problem is the sonic quality of the recording. James Taylor's recent works have been sonic jewels and even early works of both of these performers have a nice warm and dynamic quality about them. While nice to listen to, this CD sounds, well, flat. Much to much compression was used so you loose the dynamics of the performance. This is most notable in the louder performances such as \\"I feel the Earth Move.\\" Another problem for me was the quality of Mr. Taylor's guitar. It sounded like they used some sort of internal pickup rather than a good quality microphone.     Yes I'm picky and yes, I'm the kind of person that pays way to much for stereo equipment and most listeners will probably never notice the issues. But I could hear the compression on the stereo in my old pickup. It sounded more like listening to an FM radio station than a CD. The thing that bothers me most is, with the technology available today, everything that is being produced seems to sound better and better.  Why would a historic performance by such marvelous singer/songwriters sound so - well bad?    Next time pull in the folks from MTV Unplugged to do post.
B001QERPDO|3.0|I bought this CD on the strength of the reviews here and on a couple of live YouTube performances. The Script has talent, and they've put together a decent album with a couple of great songs but the others blend together into a less memorable mix. The energy on the songs is high, the lyrics are generally smart and occasionally very original. If I had to compare them to other artists they are like Matchbox 20 meets Maroon 5 meets James Blunt meets Craig David (remember him? the way the Script uses backing guitar can sound exactly like him on some tracks). Like Maroon 5, this album's songs are catchy but also like Maroon 5 to me the songs wore out their welcome fast. The delivery is high energy and they sing in a torrent of words, so the initial impact on first hearing the album is forceful and gets your attention. But I didn't think the album stands up as well on repeated listenings.    Overall I give this album 3 stars for generally good songwriting and delivery, and an enjoyable contemporary sound. But I wish there was more there there.

B002RKSZN0|4.0|Even the best authors in the world sometimes put out something that... well, isn't up to their usual standards. For Jane Austen, that book was \\"Mansfield Park\\" -- her prose is typically excellent, and she weaves a memorable story about a poor young lady in the middle of a wealthy, dysfunctional family. But put bluntly, Fanny Price lacks the depth and complexity of Austen's other heroines.<br /><br />As a young girl, Fanny Price was sent from her poor family to live with her wealth relatives, the Bertrams, and was raised along with her four cousins Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia.<br /><br />Despite being regarded only little better than a servant (especially by the fawning, cheap Mrs. Norris), Fanny is pretty happy -- especially since Edmund is kind and supportive of her at all times. But then the charming, fashionable Crawford sibilings arrive in the neighborhood, sparking off some love triangles (particularly between Maria and Henry Crawford, even though she's already engaged.<br /><br />And the whole thing becomes even more confused when Henry becomes intrigued by Fanny's refusal to be charmed by him as the others are. But when she rejects his proposal, she ends up banished from her beloved Mansfield Park... right before a devastating scandal and a perilous illness strikes the Bertram family. Does Fanny still have a chance at love and the family she's always been with?<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Mansfield Park\\" is Fanny Price -- even Austen's own mother didn't like her. She's a very flat, virtuously dull heroine for this story; unlike Austen's other heroines she doesn't have much personality growth or a personal flaw to overcome. And despite being the protagonist, Fanny seems more like a spectator on the outskirts of the plot until the second half (when she has a small but pivotal part to play in the story).<br /><br />Fortunately she's the only real flaw in this book. Austen's stately, vivid prose is full of deliciously witty moments (Aunt Norris \\"consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him\\"), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others). And she inserts some pointed commentary on people who care more about society's opinions than on morality.<br /><br />And the other characters in the book are pretty fascinating as well -- especially since Edmund, despite being a virtuous clergyman-in-training, is an intelligent and strong-willed man. The Bertrams are a rather dysfunctional family with a stern patriarch, a fluttery ethereal mother, a playboy heir and a couple of spoiled girls -- Maria in particular develops a crush on Henry, but doesn't bother to break off her engagement until it's too late. And the Crawfords are all flash and sparkle: a pair of charming, shallow people who are essentially hollow.<br /><br />\\"Mansfield Park\\" suffers from a rather insipid heroine, but the rest of the book is vintage Austen -- lies, romance, scandal and a dance of manners and society.d herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him\\"), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others).

B003EDYWDQ|5.0|There is no point discussing Yundi Li's flawless technique and 'Chopin style', because they are well known facts. And this is about the quality of this music, not his more or less maturity or ethnicity.   I wish he would use a slower tempo and take his time in some of these Nocturnes. I feel this all the time listening to Pollini (and to the extreme tempos of Argerich). I prefer the calmness of Rubinstein in the No.7 and of Kissin in the No.10, for example. But Li's artistry is such that in the faster playing he does not leave out any expressiveness.   I find this especially true in the No.13, Op.48 No.1 I always preferred the slow, detailed interpretation by Edouard Hamlin. It took just a few times I listened to Li to make this my favorite. It sounds to me like a force of nature, and it justifies by itself having acquired this whole collection.   I seems that Li retains all of his earlier fire, and he even masters better the use of tone, resonance of the piano.  Not all the Nocturnes in this collection may be favorites, this is too subjective to earlier listening experiences. But if there has to be just one, this collection qualifies as a choice among the few best.   There is uniqueness in these interpretations. Like the case of most of his CDs, I feel this one is also a must-have.

0375826726|1.0|While i did enjoy the first book, and managed to find some redeeming qualities in the second, i struggled to make it through Paolini's third installment. For such a long and detailed book, I find it amazing that Paolini managed to forget to include any semblance of a plot line. The first two books, while frequently forcing the reader to endure barrages of meaningless anthropological explanation regarding the overly invented cultural details of fictional civilizations, did direct the reader along a somewhat entertaining path promising suspense and eventually a mysterious conclusion. Brisingr managed to take an already complex plot and make it nearly impossible to follow. I believe the roller coaster analogy works best to explain what Paolini has done here. Books 1 and 2 took the reader on a very enjoyable roller coaster ride. Some ups, some downs, a few twists and turns thrown in here and there. With book three, Paolini added several hundred pages of slow and pointless scenic roller coaster ride - with a few unrelated and seemingly irrelevant twists and turns added at random intervals. In summary - Paolini is clearly a talented writer - with immature and undeveloped story telling ability. He became too close to his work with the third addition of his inheritance cycle and mistakingly thought his fans might enjoy an in-depth look at dwarf politics for 300 pages. If the writer has any mercy, he will take the massive loss of fans that he incurred as a result of Brisingr to heart, and bring his once noteworthy story to an end in a creative yet succinct manner.

Hopefully, their next album will be more like Oracular and less like this one or I might become one less fan.  Take a listen for yourself but be forewarned to not expect greatness.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|It's inevitable that Maynard James Keenan's two projects Tool and A Perfect Circle are compared to each other. His voice, his lyrics, his musical style, and unique approach is so massively influential and popular, it's only natural this happens. However, the similarities of the two bands end after Maynard James Keenan. This album \\"Thirteenth Step\\" is by far the best APC album of the three released. The album opens up with the seemingly mellow \\"The Package\\" and is a very satisfying opener and as the song closes in on the five minute mark, listeners are given some very strong riffs and heavy singing from Maynard. The next few songs flow seamlessly. \\"Weak and Powerless,\\" \\"The Noose,\\" \\"Blue,\\" and \\"Vanishing.\\" The Noose in particular, is an absolutely mesmerizing song. A very good highlight of this album is Vanishing. This song might have to grow on some. It did for me. But eventually I fell in love with it. It's got a very melodic and softer singing style that meshes with the music very effectively. I love the drums on this song in particular as well. Very memorable songs on the second half of the album include: The Outsider, Pet, and Gravity. Gravity to me, is a perfect song all throughout. The themes reflected in this album many people, myself included, can relate to. Having guilt, suffering from an addiction, even if it's not alcoholism. The album refers to battling inner demons, letting go, and having to deal with things that are completely out of control. APC is in it's own right, a very good band and cannot be compared to Tool. I love both of them, and the only thing they have in common is MJK. Overall, I highly recommend this album to anyone. Whether you like tool or hate tool, this album will not disappoint. And if you don't love a song or the album at first, chip away at it. I promise it will grow on you.
0756405890|5.0|This book got me into soooo much trouble with my boss.  I stayed up until the wee hours of the morning unable to put the book down and showed up to work tired and distracted, wondering how the story would play out.  Although this book is familiar to others in this genre, it has a very unique way of telling the story and is so well written that even the strange and unusual seem commonplace without the author having to go into deep explanation. I really enjoy how the author shows how a simple story can change form and how truth can become distorted as it passes from one person to the next to the next. Having been an avid reader of fantasy for over 40 years, I truly believe that this is one of the best I've read in a while, and sit in frustrated, impatient anticipation for the release of the second book in this series.    I am recommending this book to my niece, age 15, not an experience reader (yet), who I feel would have no difficulty keeping pace with the complexities of the story line simply because of the author's expertise in the craft of \\"turning a phrase.\\"

B0021L8V1Q|4.0|Iron Man 2 explodes and lights up the screen with great action sequences, timely humor & an actor in Robert Downey Jr. that is perfectly cast as the cocky playboy Tony Stark. Yet, with all the superhero movies we've been seeing over the past few years, I'm afraid the FORMULA has become routine and stale.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, Iron Man 2 delivers on nearly all levels but this movie reminded me of Spiderman 3 in a way.  A slam bam beginning. A gushy uneventful middle and a slam bam ending. Iron Man 2 even took the stalish step of duplicating themselves. Just like the first movie when Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges) stepped into the mammoth, souped up original Iron Man suit, Ivan Vanko/Whiplash steps into a souped up, mammoth suit of his own creation. My apologies for saying it, but \\"ho, hum\\".<br /><br />It's almost like Paramount knows they have us by the cahones with Spiderman, Iron Man, Thor & Captain America, and they have this cookie cutter screenplay machine that kicks em' out with the least amount of expense on their behalf. \\"If we give em' a more complicated script, we're gonna have to put in more Iron Man scenes in the middle and that's expensive. And of course we have Thor, Captain America & another Iron Man to think about. Keep it simple. Keep the cost down.\\"<br /><br />I just couldn't help thinking this after I left the movie. I hated Spiderman 3 for this very reason. I was nodding off in the middle for godsakes. Christopher Nolan delivered with Dark Knight. He gave us a unique look into the world of Batman that was interesting throughout and had us EMOTIONALLY involved. Heck, even the original Batman series knew that people didn't want talking... they wanted Batman.<br /><br />Anyway, despite the uneventful middle to this movie, where the most exciting scene was Tony Stark dancing around drunk in the Iron Man suit shooting fruit, it is still a good movie that is certainly worth a trip to the cinema and a purchase on DVD or Blu-Ray... just, one of these days... we're gonna have to demand more for all the money we've made the studio.

Unfortunately  this book is not without fault, I found the book very predictable.  Without spoiling the book I discovered the  chief protagonist upon his first introduction in the book.  Dan Brown has a definite formula he uses in his books.  In a way if you have read one of his books you kind of know what to expect.  I read this book after reading Da Vinci code, Angels and demons, and The lost symbol.  Having read those books it was very easy to see where this book was headed due to the similarities between this book and Brown's other books.<br /> Having said all that I still recommend this book, especially if you have not read Brown's other books.

B000MZHW40|3.0|If I can see a movie more than once,it's pretty good. If I can see it every time it passes through the cable box then it's very good. The Bourne Identity is very good. So is Groundhog Day. Blood Diamond is just a one-or two-time movie. I think the reason is that it's predictable. Zwick knows how to direct and the actions scenes hold your attention, De Caprio plays his part well and Djimon Hounsou (Gladiator) offers the audience a role that is reasonably believable. The problem is that it all falls apart at the end, when Hollywood takes over....I don't want to say more, given you may not have seen the movie yet....It is worth seeing...just not more than once....or twice    ...and one more thought...movies are art, or at least they are supposed to be...and art communicates with each one of us in a different and often unique way. What I mean to say is that just because I rate this movie with three stars doesn't mean that you should....
B000QUCNOK|5.0|This is a great movie that is almost as good as the book and there's an end on the matter.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|The more I mull over this fascinating film the more I'm convinced that all the hype and praise it received (being toted as the best vampire movie ever) is accurate.  I mean, I am not a vampire aficionado by any means, but I have seen a few of the more well regarded vampire films and this one blows them all away for me.  There is just such raw and sinister relevance to this poignant story that I can't help but hold it in high esteem.<br /><br />I really, really need to read this novel!<br /><br />The film tells the story of a young boy named Oskar who meets a young vampire named Eli.  Oskar isn't aware right off that Eli is a vampire, but they bond due to a mutual feeling of exclusion.  Eli, being a vampire, is reclusive almost impulsively and has no real companions outside of a man named Hakan who takes care of her by killing men and bringing her blood.  Oskar is a small and wimpy young boy who is constantly picked on and finds himself internalizing his rage in wild fantasies of killing the boy who is harassing him.  That is how Eli and Oskar meet.  One night while acting out his frustrations on a defenseless tree, Oskar is approached by Eli and they soon strike up an unlikely friendship.  This relationship takes them through mutual hardships and helps the other to grow in areas they are struggling.<br /><br />This is very much a love story that is far less about love and more about affection.<br /><br />When one dissects the core of this film they find so much more than they bargained for, or than they initial thought they'd discover.  This is far more than just a monster movie, this is a beautiful depiction of adolescent angst and the need to find someone to share in and thus alleviate your pain.  There is also a lot here that is so subtle and merely hinted at.  I have read on some of the novel's broader scope and I love they way that this film insinuates a lot while leaving the majority of the back-story to your imagination.  Eli is a mysterious character, but there are plenty of hints to her story dropped for us to nibble on.  These tidbits add to the layers of pain in her eyes and the emotional depth we see in her undead soul.<br /><br />\\"If I wasn't a girl...would you like me anyway?\\"<br /><br />The subject of revenge and childhood alienation and subsequent domination is given proper and enlightening treatment as we consider Oskar's situation as well as the similar yet contrasted state that Eli finds herself.  Eli is very much like Oskar, yet she is a matured variation of him (beings that she is 200+ years old) and yet she maintains the same need for vengeance that he feels at his young age.  This detail tragically shows that pain etched on the skin of the young very rarely fades with time.  Oskar's undeniable desire to be older himself (he knows his age to the day, which is a tell tale sign of someone counting the days until something better) is also a tragic detail, showing the loss of youth in today's society.  With all the pain and all the heartache, our young ones are chucking away what should be crucial years of their development for adulthood.<br /><br />The title of the film alone (English translation being `Let the Right One In') is a testament to the level of emotional relevance this film carries.  The title refers to the emotional bond between Eli and Oskar, a statement referring to letting one in emotionally.  Throughout the film Eli makes it known that she must be invited inside, and this is metaphoric for the need she has to belong and or be wanted.  The same is true for Oskar, and once Eli begins to share her truth with Oskar it becomes apparent that she has `let him in' just as he has `let her in'.<br /><br />Carrying the film's heavy themes, young Kare Hedebrant and Lina Leandersson (both making acting debuts here) are astonishingly effective.  It doesn't hurt that director Tomas Alfredson baths them in a sea of rich metaphoric light.  Alfredson allows his actors to become one with the imagery, creatinga beautifully complete film.  The attention to detail is simply breathtaking.  From the score to the cinematography to the script to the acting, everything is a perfect compliment of the other.<br /><br />This film is truly haunting, but not in that generic horror way.  `Lat den Ratte Komma In' is far from generic.  It is intoxicatingly real, a film that shies away from the clich&eacute;s presented in this overdone genre (the characters are real and gritty as apposed to sexed up and artificial), giving us something with a purity rarely seen in a film containing this much bloodshed.y breathtaking.

B00003CX8Y|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />The Walt Disney Company's 1991 animated film \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is remarkable for the way it balances the demands of the classic story with its own stated aims of providing family-friendly entertainment.  This film has very little in common with the classic Jean Cocteau film of 1946, but in certain key scenes it also does not disregard the mature angles of the tale.<br /><br />With the voice talents of Paige O'Hara, Robby Benson and Angela Lansbury, it opens its story in an ideal French village following a short prologue detailing the origins of the Beast.  In the village, the heroine Belle is a bit of an odd duck, always reading books and avoiding the advances of Gaston, the local brawny sportsman who rudely courts her.  She is much more interested in looking after her father, the eccentric inventor Maurice.  When Maurice gets sidetracked on his way to a tradeshow, his and Belle's lives will change forever.<br /><br />The differentiating factor which marks this adaptation as Disney's own is its supreme narrative balance.  While it is very clear the Beast can be dangerous, he is much more tormented than evil.  By contrast, Gaston, who is beautiful in the eyes of the village, is a vain, soulless greedy man.<br /><br />With excellent songs like \\"Poor Provincial Town,\\" \\"Be Our Guest,\\" and the stirringly romantic title song, Walt Disney's \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" will continue to be applauded for a long time.
0385504225|1.0|This book was a huge disapointment.  Story line was a duplicate of previous books but with a very weak ending.  I was down to 45 pages left and it took me three weeks to finish. This will be the last Dan Brown book for me.
0385342039|4.0|A down on her luck heroine bumps into her great great aunt's Sadie's ghost at her wake. She never knew Sadie as a living person.Aunt sadie cannot rest until she finds her necklace and makes sure our herione doesn't make the same mistakes she did as a twenty something year old flapper girl.It's really stupid for about fifty pages,it just reminded me of a bad tv movie. But I was on a bus trip and worried about my one friend who has cancer. Once they got past the long drawn out funeral scene,the story turned into a mystery like why didn't this girl meet her aunt who was hurt that none of her family ever came to visit her in the nursing home ? why does her insanely rich uncle get mad whenever she starts asking about sadie? And Sadie is something else,she's pushy, she likes sex, and loves to party and she is a hell of a businesswoman.So if you need something fun to lighten up your day, read this. This book is like eating a piece of red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting,it is bad for you,but it puts a smile on your face and you can walk the calories off later.

0810979772|5.0|I have a kindergartener and a third grader who are gung ho over \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid Do-It-Yourself Book.\\"  My 8 year-old son, who never enjoyed writing, is writing every day in his own diary.  The kids fought over it until my kindergartener went out and bought her own.<br /><br />I asked my son what was so special about this diary.  He said it asks him questions.  I looked and half the book is filled with pages prompting things like \\"Five things nobody knows about you because they never bothered to ask\\" or \\"The worst nightmare you ever had.\\"  There are 16 pages of full color Zoo-Wee Mama comics followed by lined blank pages for the children to write freely.<br /><br />This Do-It-Yourself Book is a hit.  My kids have shown their books to all their friends and I've seen other kids toting them around, as well.  It inspired my children to go on and buy their own private locked diaries after having gone through this one.  If you have a \\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" fan, this book is sure to delight.
0307271862|3.0|I just finished this, and, frankly, if I thought this was as good as Mankell can deliver, I wouldn't bother reading anything else of his. As noted in other reviews, It starts out very well, stumbles a few time, then veers off into a tendentious discussion of the politics of modern China, neo-colonialism, and revisionist history of Africa. At one point a character delivers a speech to an assembly of China's movers and shakers, and we get the whole speech, page after page of it. It's good, but who needs it? Mankell does a convincing job of presenting China as a setting, but to do that, he has to drop his basic murder-mystery story to establish China as an emerging power center and to explain the existence of one Chinese man who may have a reason to commit the original murder.     The book started to go sideways for me in the first few pages (SPOILER ALERT!): the murder is discovered in rural isolation by a lone individual without a cell phone, and Mankell has to invoke some fairly creaky (and visible) plot mechanics to bring the murder to the attention of the police. Later in the story, crucial characters are conveniently rubbed out by faceless snipers with high-powered rifles. Characters like those pop up, then disappear again, while the reader is left wondering what's going on with Vivi, the interesting woman police chief back in Sweden. We never find out. The big murder scene just seems to be Mankell's means to get us into a discussion of Chinese politics.
B002SQFZ68|5.0|Yes, some cons: bonus songs out of context, no video on Bad Medicine, however, the overall experience far outweighs the coulda/shoulda.<br /><br />First and foremost: Great, selectable sound! Nothing goes without it.<br /><br />Bon Jovi got older, but not old. I think the band matures well; the long awaited live versions of \\"Dry County\\", Living In Sin\\" and even \\"Runaway\\" sound appropriate to their (and my) age, I'd call it 25 years of artistic growth. The band is believable and fun, maybe more than ever.<br /><br />Adding \\"Hallelujah\\" to the set, one of the most beautiful songs ever, not only proves once again that Jon really can sing, it suggests growth and honest appreciation of musical art. Brought across excellently!<br /><br />Oh, and Richie singing \\"I'll be there for you\\"? Fantastic!<br /><br />Enjoy!
0971407614|2.0|I was only expecting a book of bodyweight exercises, but was pleased to see a rather bulky section at the beginning discussing nutrition, strength training versus endurance training and other often-overlooked but vital aspects to fitness. However, upon actually reading this material, I was dismayed to see good, current science alongside urban legends and discredited theories. For example, the author repeats the tired old \\"eight cups of water a day\\" recommendation, although that has always been an urban legend that won't die, like \\"we only use 10% of our brains.\\" Also, considering that this book was published in 2010, it's unacceptable that the author is perpetuating the assumption that cholesterol causes heart disease, when there is no evidence for this, and research indicates that high cholesterol is a symptom that appears in tandem with heart disease -- caused by the same underlying problem, not the cause itself.<br /><br />Then there's the writing. Or, I should say, editing. But wait -- there wasn't any. If anyone over the age of 13 had actually proofread the author's work, he would have corrected the dozens of times the term \\"loosing weight\\" was used. Another gem was how some foods \\"reap havoc\\" on your body. This despite the fact that \\"losing\\" was spelled correctly in a couple of places. I don't blame the author, but this is far from a professional piece of work. Note: Spell-checking is NOT editing.<br /><br />As for the \\"bodyweight\\" exercises, about half of them require equipment. You just replace gym equipment with common household objects, such as phone books, chairs, bookshelves, boxes, and towels. Having said that, I think that the collection of exercises is good, although I question the wisdom of doing dips with one hand on a table and the other on a bookshelf. Not many home bookshelves are built for that. But there are exercises there for all muscle groups, and the author helpfully provides progressions which allow even an out-of-shape beginner to work up to the more difficult exercises.<br /><br />So if you rip out the first third of the book, ignore the recommendation that you use a bookshelf as one half of a set of parallel bars for your own safety, and just use it as a comprehensive exercise reference, you're good to go.ficult exercises.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|i really dont care about 40 minutes of outtakes and special features and interviews with the cast and all the other stuff.  for twenty bucks and get both blu and regular dvd, its a bargain on an awesome film.  this is spectacular special effects and the movie is all i want.  get this and you will be happy!
B000V3OKW0|3.0|I agree with virtually everything Giordano Bruno (another reviewer here) wrote about this piece (very eloquently reflecting much musicial erudition). One does not get a feel for the overall structure of the suites because they playing is rather too slow, focusing on each note instead of the work as a whole. The dance like nature of the suites is suffocated. The main attraction about this recording is the beautiful tone of Fournier's cello. The accoustics are very rich.
0061673730|1.0|Don't believe the hype.  The whole premise that \\"Quality\\" is an undefineable thing is ridiculous, and the whole rest of the book is built on that flawed premise.  A huge disappointment after hearing so many wonderful things about the book.
B00004T2FQ|5.0|Everything is just as it should be here. Superb performances, hardly any weak link in the cast and the recording is clear and well balanced. My rating for this CD is five stars because I do not believe there is a better highlights rendition to be found of this particular composition, everything considered. I am not rating the composition but the performances. This is not a most profound piece of work but beautiful music. However, if you want the whole opera then perhaps Solti's version (with Merrill et al) is a better option since it captures the pathos of the work much better than this version. The downside to the Solti version is the sound balancing but there is an \\"enhanced\\" remasted version of it out there which supposedly fixes the imbalance. That remastered issue is out of stock and very hard to get second hand.

I'm not sure what I can mention that won't be a spoiler so let me just say I thought this was a nice end to the series.  I purchased my copy from the UK and was worried it wouldn't arrive before the US version was published but I received it about May 10th so it was worth the $20.  However, I don't believe buying the book for the outrageous prices listed here would be worth it.
B00386EZJU|5.0|I haven't ever taken the time to listen to one of John Powell's film scores in detail like this before. Sure, I've seen his films, mostly DreamWorks Animation pictures, but I never really paid attention to the music before. In How To Train Your Dragon, the orchestra just stands out a whole lot more and supports the story so well.<br /><br />Until now, I've only cared about the soundtracks to Pixar films, and their three composers: Randy Newman, Michael Giacchino, and Thomas Newman. These guys are great, but they're not the only ones! (John Newman, Harry Gregson-Williams, and Alexandre Desplat (of [[ASIN:B002OULHPG Fantastic Mr. Fox]]) come to mind.)<br /><br />I think the mark of a great film soundtrack is one you can listen to by itself and still know what musical cues match up with specific scenes in the movie. Another plus is soundtracks with two or three main themes that keep recurring, and may be linked to a specific character or idea. HTTYD's soundtrack does both of those things.<br /><br />My favorite film soundtrack is never consistent. Two years ago, it was Thomas Newman's [[ASIN:B0017LFKMY WALL-E]] that I liked. Last year it was Michael Giacchino's Up soundtrack. Currently, it's HTTYD (this review). I have a feeling that Toy Story 3 and Randy Newman's soundtrack for it will oust this one as both my favorite film and film soundtrack this year, but we'll just have to see when that time comes.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I was a bit discouraged that all the music from the original series had been scrubbed out of this DVD collection because of licensing rights. Still there seems to be a decent amount of extras and the price is very good for getting all five seasons and the two TV movies. I always appreciated the sarcastic wit of Daria and it was a pleasant surprise to find it on Amazon.<br /><br />It's too bad that MTV is simmering pool of reality show slime nowadays and would never develop a show like this ever again.
B0035J6TA8|4.0|...or too young to listen to, and appreciate, something truly beautiful, I recommend this music. Many of the songs, like \\"Flume\\" and \\"Power of the Heart\\" are very moving and emotional.     Because the set tends to have songs that have the same pacing and mood, I've found that this release is best listened to in short 3 or 4 song doses. It doesn't really lend itself to \\"beginning to end\\" listening. It also helps, I think, to skip around a bit and listen to things in a different order from time to time.     The recording quality, at least to my ears, is excellent as well. Every instrument is perfectly placed on the soundstage and the balance is beautiful.     All in all, an outstanding release from a legendary performer.

0517548232|5.0|It's amazing that this book was written in 1946 but is so relevant today.  Everything Hazlitt discusses about government spending, regulation, market interference, subsidies, deficit spending, and rampant encouragement of consumer debt relates directly to what is happening today.  The book is written in a very readable, straight forward manner that anybody can understand, even a Democrat politician whose only reason for living is plundering and looting from the productive members of society and transferring the swag to the looters and the moochers (i.e. - their voters).    I can't think of a better treatise on the war between the \\"tax payers\\" and the \\"tax eaters\\" than this book.  Hazlitt refers often to \\"The Forgotten Man\\", a book by William Graham Sumner published in 1883 which went into much detail on how government policy will always favor the politically connected at the expense of the powerless.  Politician A passes a law to benefit constituent B at the expense of constituent C (The Forgotten Man).  Amity Shlaes recent history of FDR's \\"The New Deal\\" used the same title \\"The Forgotten Man\\" and was one of the best books of 2008.    I highly recomment this book.  It's concise, interesting, and the most readable economic books ever written.

I am already an experienced prenatal yoga teacher and an Iyengar student, so I figured this book would be perfect for me to continue my learning.  However, I actually disagree with some of the suggestions in the book.  For example, in the \\"Problems A-Z\\" section,the suggested poses for heartburn are almost all inversions.  Which is the last thing you want to do when acid is already coming up the esophagus. I would have also liked to see some explanation for why certain poses are suggested to help alleviate different issues.      That said, the pictures and descriptions of the poses and excellent.  I also really enjoyed the anatomy section at the end of the book.
B001OQCV2O|4.0|Entertaining movie. I usually fall asleep during movies, this movie kept me awake.  Worth watching even though the special effects are stronger than the story line.  Nice to see someone other than Bruce Willis or Tom Cruise save the world.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I was SO EXCITED when I got it in the mail yesterday! Daria was a smart, intelligent and unintentionally funny show that epitomized the 90's. MTV had a hit in this show and the current state of the channel couldn't be further than it was when this show came out.<br /><br />While I am bummed that the music is taken out of the show, I understand that this is a reason why some of my favorite shows haven't been fully released or at all onto DVD, so I was more than happy to purchase it minus the iconic music that it contained. I was, however, pretty peeved when the only type of booklet or information was a tiny sheet saying \\"tough crap,\\" and we should be happy we got the set at all. The creator could have gone about this in a different way...<br /><br />I was hoping a booklet about the episodes or some additional information on the show but just received the crappy \\"no music sheet.\\"<br /><br />Regardless, I am more than ecstatic to be able to watch these in full (okay, okay, sans good music, but honestly, the replacement music isn't bad) and even happier that the last few days have been rainy and terrible-- an even better excuse to relive parts of my preteen/teen years all over again.

0971407614|5.0|I am Mark Lauren's newest and biggest fan. This book is gold.  You get a total of 111 exercises for your entire body.  The exercises are given a rank of 1 to 4, with \\"1\\" being the easiest version of an exercise and \\"4\\" being the hardest.  So if one version is too easy, you go to the next to keep your strength and fitness progressing.  Alot of the exercises with rankings of 3 or 4 I have never seen before.  The author also includes 4 10-week training routines for beginner to advanced trainees.  And these aren't your usual \\"do 3 sets of 10 reps\\" or \\"stand in front of a mirror and flex your biceps\\" workouts either! They are short, intense workouts that include circuits, supersets and tabata protocols.  Be advised...I started the \\"Basic\\" program on Monday and am still sore as hell today.  The protocols change every 2 weeks so you aren't doing the same workout for a long time.   Yes, some of the exercises require some equipment like a pullup bar or dip stand or dumbbells. The author makes several suggestions regarding household items you can use instead.    If I had one complaint it would only be that I haven't found anything regarding warmups, cooldowns or stretches.  But that information is found easily enough on the internet that it probably wasn't really necessary.    I haven't been this excited for a bodyweight workout book in a long time. Well done Mr. Lauren!

0553801503|3.0|I liked this book.  After the unrelenting 3rd book, constantly exclaiming \\"that is so wrong!\\" with all the shocking twists, being so gripped at times by my characters' fates that I looked up spoilers, I was glad this book wasn't a clone.  I appreciated the break, the calm, to just hang around in this world before being thrust back into the action of the real main characters (Jon, Dany, Tyrion).  Tthis was a good prologue.  I will definitely miss Jaime in the next book, though he may reappear at the end, and we'll have Tyrion.  Regardless, here Jaime's were my absolute favorite chapters; Cersei's became repetitive, annoying in terms of her paranoia; Brienne's perspective was quite boring without Jaime, though the best cliffhanger of the book.    I admire GRRM's judgement in splitting the book, having this come first.  Quite a risk.  I think the timeline may be tough with some characters' whose fates we know just starting out on their journeys in Book 5 (see Samwell in Jon's preview chapter.  You can find all the preview chapters here: [...]).  Yet GRRM is so talented at turning obstacles into assets.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I received my order in just a couple of days. I love this CD!! With a life like the one that she has had it is so much more meaningful to listen to it! I am very happy to see her succeed and realize her musical dreams! It sounds like her dream to sing was all she had and that made her happy, besides her mother's love, of course! I love her rendition of \\"Wild Horses,\\" \\"Cry me a River,\\" and of course, her now famous \\"I Dream a Dream,\\" but there is one song in particular that gives me goose bumps and I have to listen to it over and over and that is \\"Who I was Born to Be.\\" In the middle of all of her physical difficulties and the school children's mockeries, I can picture that lonely little girl listening to her name in the wind and singing to herself!! Very moving! I hope that they make a movie of her life. That movie will do very well too!!
B003EVFALQ|5.0|I am inspired by this album. Natalie Merchant has provided us with a set of poems, each one orchestrated meticulously, and melodies that truly provide a terrific representation for each one. Some reminiscent of Celtic, one very oriental, some very lively and fun, some mellow and gentle. I had not heard of several of the poets that Merchant researched for this album. I imagine were any of them alive, they'd be pleased with the interpretation in music.  I could just imagine what Ogden Nash might say!  I'm grateful that Merchant provides a booklet giving the background of each poet, and most with a photo.  My favorites are on the second cd. I especially like those that pertain to children, lullabies.  I really like the songs the orchestration of which is much like Chicago--brass, mixed instruments. And, there is one that makes one want to join the sailors on their ship (Heave Ho).  I don't agree with the notes that pop up for the album in Real Player. Merchant is not like Emily Dickinson. She is much more like Edna St. Vincent Millay. Sometimes feisty, sometimes sweet, sometimes joyful, sometimes mellow--always a woman of this century.
0061537934|3.0|Not a \\"curl-up-with-a-good-book\\" read - it is more like a \\"leave- in-the-car-to-have-handy-if-you-have-to-wait-for-something book\\".  Due to circumstances,  I have  had to leave it before the end. Although I am not in any hurry, I  do intend to finish the book.
B003EYVXYQ|3.0|The PlayStation Network was offering a pre-theatrical release HD rental of Survival of the Dead, so I just had to give it a try. And as it turns out, Survival of the Dead was, quite simply put, dumb. But ya gotta throw an extra star at the guy that started it all back in 1968, right?<br /><br />Romero allows a 2004 top notch remake of [[ASIN:B001CW7ZW6 Dawn of the Dead]] by Zack Snyder that takes the zombies to a new level: they're really vicious, they run, they seem a little smarter, and (yuck) they can give birth. Then the following year, in Romero's [[ASIN:B001CW7ZVC Land of the Dead]], the zombies seem to have forgotten how to run but now they are even smarter than in the Dawn remake. They're like \\"learning zombies\\". And that's the concept Romero goes with in Survival. Plus in Survival of the Dead there's this whole Hatfield versus McCoy's-esque thing going on, which to me was just a distraction from what I was really here for: Zombies chasing people around in a world gone mad. But no, the \\"When Zombies Attack\\" theme is overshadowed by this family feud that occurs on a remote island that 4 survivors from the mainland (including one that first appeared in 2007's Diary of the Dead) try to make it to after hearing that it might be a safe haven from the zombie infested world.<br /><br />I thought that the 1990 remake of [[ASIN:B00000K3TO Night of the Living Dead]] was terrific. Survival was fun, and it was probably better than the forgettable [[ASIN:B001CDLARQ Diary of the Dead]], but it was a step away from the realistic situations predominant in the more recent versions of Night of and Dawn of. (Wait a minute...realistic situations...the walking dead...???)<br /><br />Oh, speaking of \\"the walking dead\\"...are you familiar with the comic book series [[ASIN:1607060760 The Walking Dead]]? If not you're missing out on a fabulous spinoff of Night of the Living Dead. Don't like comic books or graphic novels? Well you're in luck because AMC is converting the comic books into a series starting in the fall of 2010; all headed up by [[ASIN:B000Q67876 Frank Darabont]]...should be great, but I don't know how they're going to put some of the hardcore stuff on basic cable. Anyway, I digress....<br /><br />I was entertained by Survival of the Dead and would not suggest anyone interested in the genre pass on it, especially George A loyalists. At least what George seemed to lack in a more believable plot line he faithfully made up for in going for the gross out.nto a series starting in the fall of 2010; all headed up by [[ASIN:B000Q67876 Frank Darabont]]...should be great, but I don't know how they're going to put some of the hardcore stuff on basic cable.

B002LFPAUC|5.0|I mean, it's hard to review Fawlty Towers, one of the great television comedies of all times. This is the edition to get though. Good video quality and decent sound throughout. It really adds to the experience compared to the previous editions. Or perhaps, one is less distracted by the video. Either way, recommended. Five stars. Really pretty darned nice. Just go and buy it now, or get it from Netflix if you prefer.
031606792X|4.0|I'll preface my review with a little bit about myself since so many people seem to \\"flash their credentials\\" when trashing this book.  I'm a 30 year old Ph.D. student at an Ivy League school studying psychology and human nature.  I watched the Twilight movie after it came out on DVD and didn't get it; I felt like I was missing some important background information.  I watched New Moon two weeks ago (better than the first, at least for standing on its own as a movie) and thought that maybe I should just read the books to figure out what all the hype is about.  So I read all four books in less than four days.  And I LOVED THEM.  I loved them for as much as what they were as what they were not.  Yes, Stephenie Meyer isn't a literary genius; I'm not going to compare her to great contemporary or classic writers like J.K. Rowling or Jane Austen.  My English lit major friends have a field day picking apart all that's wrong with her writing style.  Well guess what--I didn't read these books so that I could debate the mechanics of writing or think deeply about some symbolic sacrifice.  I read them for enjoyment and I enjoyed them immensely.  I'm contributing my review to the fourth book because this seems to be the one that people hate the most.      First issue: I understand what critics are saying; Bella got everything she wanted and maybe a few things she didn't initially think she wanted, like a baby, and oh that's so horrible.  Why?  I'm sorry, but didn't Elizabeth Bennett get everything she wanted at the end of Pride & Prejudice?  Her sisters' marriages all work out, she gets to live in the big mansion with Mr. Darcy, and everyone lives happily ever after.  Harry Potter lost a few characters along the way, but he gets to marry Ginny, Ron gets to marry Hermione, and their godson (son of Lupin & Tonks) gets it on with one of their relatives.  I'm using these books as examples because they seem to be the authors most commonly chosen as a comparison to Stephenie Meyer, butthe literary world is filled with happy endings with little sacrifice in achieving them.      The second issue people seem to have is with \\"rules\\".  Vampires can love a human, but oh having a baby with a human, well that's just silly.  You realize we are talking about VAMPIRES right--a fictional entity?!  It seems a bit ridiculous that people get so upset over this, as if Meyer has somehow offended real vampires.  I don't read tons of vampire novels, so maybe there is some big literary rule book out there saying what vampires can and cannot do.  But last I checked, Stephenie never said anything in earlier novels that suggested that the only fluid in a vampire is their venom.  She doesn't say anything about it except when Edward speaks in an earlier novel (Eclipse maybe?) about being just like a human man when Bella talks about sex.  Meyer didn't violate her own rules.  Instead, I think people are just upset that something happened that they didn't want to happen and use the excuse that it's breaking the rules THEY (not Stephenie) believe vampires should exist by.    The third issue critics have with this book is the lack of a big fight scene at the end.  I will admit that I was disappointed there a bit, too.  Several chapters of building up to a climax and then...nothing.  But then I started to think about it and wondered what I would have wanted to happen.  A few key people die, but Bella and Edward survive with their love for each other?  The vampire masses that the Volturi assembled rise up to defend their individual rights?  The Volturi crash and burn and the Romanians take the power back?  Guess what--sounds an awful lot like the final battle sequence of Harry Potter & the Deathly Hallows and then everyone would have accused Stephenie of being unoriginal or plagiarizing.  Related to this is that while Breaking Dawn represents the end of this series in Bella's voice, Meyer has alluded to the fact that this is not the end of her writing about the Cullens.  So maybe the big ultimate fight to the death will come later.  I don't know.  She's the author and can write what she wants.    The fourth issue I've seen reflected in these comments is a mixed bag.  Either the final book isn't sexy enough or it's too smut-filled.  Well, to each his or her own.  I'm actually happy that Stephenie finally lets Edward and Bella have sex; what's the point of sexual chemistry in the first three books if you are never going to do anything with it.  Maybe I wanted a bit more, but I had to remind myself that these books were written for young adults.  As for Stephenie's religious motivations, as some have cited, well that's her business--but I never felt like it was overt or jammed down my throat eitehr.  Given her background, I'm not surprised that a baby was the a result of the consummation of the relationship, but I don't think it was ridiculous or crazy either.  I'll admit that I wasn't expecting it, but it wasn't a total turn off either.  Maybe it's because of my age; babies aren't weird or scary and don't have to be an ultimate mood/relationship killer--I actually think Stephenie gets that part right, even though other people find fault with the passion Edward and Bella still seem to have post-pregnancy.    Overall, are the books a little silly?  Sure.  Are they literary genius?  Probably not.  Do they tell a good story?  YES.  Maybe if I had been reading these books as they came out and had built up two years of suspense imagining what was going to happen in the final book (as I did with HP7), I would have felt let down.  But as it was, I didn't give myself time between books to ask, \\"Hmm, and now what do I want the author to give me in the next book?\\"  I just followed the ride she took me on and enjoyed it.  I deal with enough serious topics in my life that these books were the perfect escape.  In some small way, I actually appreciated that the series ended in an completely unexpected way.  Books can serve different purposes and not allof them have to be literary gold to be good.  Some people are going to identify with Bella and others will run far, far away from her.  I am not embarrassed to say that I now consider myself someone who gets her and the world that Stephenie Meyer painted.

0440539811|5.0|But for the right type this book is definitely 5 stars.  I've tried to write more a few times now but nothing I can write explains how I felt reading it.  It's one thing when a story sucks you in but quite another when you start feeling like you are an integral part of the story and not someone reading words on a page.  It can be really hard to get into it at first, eventually it's hard to get out of it.

B002VECM6S|4.0|Micheal Oher (Quinton Aaron) was a large black kid who grew up in the Memphis projects living on people's couches because his crack addicted mom was unfit to take care of him. One day, Tony Hamilton (Omar J Dorsey), trying to enroll his kid into Wingate Christian School, also gets Micheal enrolled in the school. Moving from place to place to find shelter, Michael finally comes across Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy (Sandra Bullock and Tim McGraw) who invite him to stay at their house, and eventually invite him to be a part of their family.    The story of Micheal Oher is really a quite amazing one. Oher traveled from place to place never really having a place to stay, until he was invited by the Tuohy's to stay with them. Having never remained in a school for more than a year, and failing miserably, the Tuohy's helped him raise his grades to be able to play football (and basketball) in school. Eventually this lead to him being one of the most sought after high school players for college recruiters. Just before the 2009 NFL season he became a first round draft pick for the Baltimore Ravens and became the 2009 Rookie of the Year. With such an amazing story of \\"rags to riches\\" how does Oher's story translate to film?    Very well. One thing that surprised me, and I found refreshing was the fact that a such an openly Christian family was actually treated respectfully and without ridicule. I say this because the movie itself actually has a genuine spirit to it, it doesn't completely feel like a by the numbers inspirational sports movie. The writing does a great job at keeping many of the true things that happened in real life in the movie, moving things around as is typically necessary for screen stories, without making things feel forced. As sports movies go, this movie feels fresher than many that have come in recent years.    This, of course, is the movie that not only earned Sandra Bullock her first Oscar nomination, but her first Oscar win as well and for good reason. Playing a character based on a real person is already a daunting task, but for an actress known most for playing America's sweetheart type roles, playing a strong willed genuinely philanthropic Christian woman is definitely not an easy task, but Bullock equips herself well and steals the movie. And Quinton Aaron as Michael Oher does a fantastic job playing Oher as a person who is shy, quiet, and even somewhat cynical, but doesn't allow his cynicism to define him. Throughout the film we watch these layers removed as he becomes more ingrained in the Tuohy household.    My biggest problem with the movie is some of the changes they felt the need to make to this already fantastic true story. Michael Oher already knew how to play football before being placed on the team at Briarcrest (the real school that he attended while in the Tuohy home). Making it seem as though he didn't, to me, is an insult to the true character this film is trying to portray. On top of that the story, as portrayed in the film, is a little too good to be true. Having researched the matter a bit there's a lot in the real account of the story that does seem that way, but there was also a bit more struggle to get Micheal's grade's up, and he also wasn't the perfect teen that they depict him as in the movie. This lack of an inner struggle for the main character, as well as the lack of an outer struggle throughout most of the movie drags it down a few notches.    All in all, I think it was a really good movie, and while it might not, in my opinion, be an Oscar worthy movie on the best picture front, its definitely one of the better inspirational sports movies to come out in recent memory. Check it out for the performances, the heart warming story, and the inspiration that you will derive from it.    3.5/5
B000063DIR|1.0|This remaster is NOT the original music! It has a different rhythm section.  And it's not even stated on the CD package/cover when purchasing it! Whomever is responsible for altering the original recording (Sharon?) should be ashamed of themselves! This is a prime example of greed running roughshod over original art. How do you think Picasso or Monet (or their admirers) would feel if their art was altered, then re-sold as the originals? This is just as bad as picking up a compilation CD of yesterday's 70's or 80's hits, only to find out the songs are not played by the original artists, but by some cheesy wedding band or subpar studio musicians.  I am beyond dissapointed in this latest ugliness and greed, as evidenced by these non original releases masquerading as the original tracks.
B002KDUDG6|3.0|I own all of Michael Buble's albums and this one is his weakest.  It feels as if he is running out of standards to cover.  The best cut here is his original \\"Haven't met you yet.\\"  I also liked \\"Crazy Love\\" and \\"All of me\\" both of which showed off his wonderful phrasing. But \\"Cry Me a River\\" was way over-produced and his \\"Georgia on Mind\\" is a pale version of Ray Charles's.  All his CDs feature a cover he would have been better off leaving alone and here it is \\"Heartache Tonight.\\"  It just does not sound good remade as a swing tune.  (He made the same mistake with \\"Try a Little Tenderness\\" on It's Time).  If this is your first Buble album you may rate it higher but to see what he is really capable of, check out It's Time or Call me Irresponsible.
0743487486|3.0|This books brings up some very good points about the way children are raised and treated in North American culture. He does admit, however, that he doesn't know how to fix the issue, only that there is a problem, which he goes on to explain in depth. He gives a few guidelines on how children might be treated better (mostly to do with giving a child respect when disciplining) in order to give them a stronger upbringing which will ultimately result in more confident, self-sufficient and ego-stable people. It's hard to un-learn one's first teaching (from our parents) on how to raise children, but it's worth it. And while, Alfie doesn't know the real answers to his questions, he makes a parent think and try to figure out how to best deal with the problems.

B0019N8P2W|3.0|I have been looking forward to the Daria on DVD for many years now. Like all the other posters I am bummed out about the music changes, but understand the reasoning.    I am a bit upset with encoding quality. You can clearly see distortions and MPEG artifacts during fast motion, as well as edge aliasing. To see a really pronounced instance of this, watch the mystic spiral music video, all the background effects are really distorted.    This is particularly upsetting since most of the video in daria is low speed with fairly static content, so a decent encoder operated by a competent compressionist should have easily been able to get excellent encodes, even with 3 hours of video per dual layer disc. What is particularly vexing about it is that, the discs have a lot of empty space. Disc 1 is 7.6GB, which means it is well past the size of a single layer disc, but they had about 10% more space available that they could have used to get better encoding quality with almost no effort.    Ultimately the set is a bargain, but I would have been happy to pay more for a better a product. Hopefully MTV kept the raw digital files around and will do new encodes in the future if the series is ever rereleased.

B001L5SXQG|4.0|Bruce Springsteen releases another CD with Brendan O'Brien (BO) as the producer. There is therefore some commonality with the 2007 offering \\"Magic\\" which (BO) also produced. Bruce Springsteen is a bit heavy on this album, has a difficult dream he is working on & the death of a close friend & longtime band member Danny Federici. There are however some solid gems on this offering including \\"Queen Of The Supermarket\\", \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", \\"Surprise Surprise\\" & \\"The Last Carnival\\" : this is a wonderful tribute to the death of the band member Danny Federici. He died of melanoma, a form of skin cancer. The tribute song \\"The Last Carnival\\" is a beautiful soulful soothing goodbye song to the fallen Danny Federici! The bonus DVD has a glimpse of \\"the hard work\\" at the studio on the album \\"Working On A Dream\\". \\"A Night With The Jersey Devil\\" is a bit scary video for me included in the package, a halloween tribute of sort. On overrall the album is satisfactory but Bruce Springsteen can certainly deliver a better product!
0618918248|3.0|More of the same. Religion is bad because... God doesn't exist because... not much more insight into a belief system that lacks proof (anti-theism). Most philosophy outside of theological philosophy lacks any staying power. This is the reason a student of philosophy and even the philosopher can spend his/her entire life speculating and never really find an answer to their questions... whereas philosophy with God at the center leaves one fulfilled. After all, circular logic only works with God.
B003BKF696|5.0|Their supposed classic, Boxer, had a handful of great tunes but in between there was just too much alt-country like stuff that went nowhere and just hung out there in the air. With this release, they've entered the realm of fully modern rock. Sure there's hints of Interpol and Joy Division but the true influencial sound and style here is from one of the greatest and least well known melancholy bands of the 80's & 90's, the Swans. After hearing this cd I went back to the Swans most accessible albums, The Burning World and White Light From The Mouth Of Infinity, and the resemblances are stunning. When listening to Runaway, I can't help but think that I'm listening to a slightly more emotive Michael Gira. The best music transports you to a place you have never been before and for this reason alone I would call this album a classic.

B002VECM6S|3.0|This is an enjoyable movie to watch, and the fact that it's based on a true story makes it more of a \\"feel good\\" movie. Sandra Bullock delivers a fine performance as does the actor who plays Michael Oher. However, the acting performances of some of the other characters were pretty bad, some actually REALLY bad. And I have a hard time believing that most of the actual sequence of events really happened that way--the story seems to have been \\"Hollywoodized\\" quite a bit. Michael Oher fights off several armed gangbangers at once? He's a big guy, sure, but it seems likely that at least one of the gangbangers would have shot him. And the scene where Leah Anne threatens the gangbangers with guns was a little cheesey--\\"Oh yeah, well, I'll shoot you first, boy!\\"--that was basically what she was saying. Kind of wondering if that scene really happened.    Tim McGraw as an actor? How about someone like Dennis Quaid playing Leah Anne's husband--that would have been a more appropriate casting, I think.    The movie has some funny parts, but some would-be funny parts just come off as corny. The best part of this movie is the ending, since it's a happy one. So it's OK, but I wouldn't give it 5 stars, or even 4. It's just not THAT great.

I am looking forward to this release being the perfect keepsake for an amazing tour.

0385732554|4.0|Lois Lowry uses very direct writing to express how humans have changed their lives into something that cannot exactly be called 'life' anymore. Set in the future, the book describes the life of a boy named Jonas who lives in a 'Community'. Jonas gets selected as the Receiver of Memory at the age of twelve, the age of maturity in his Community. Before his training, Jonas was like the rest of the Community; ignorant to all that is happening elsewhere. They do not even know what animals, snow, rain, music, colors and sunshine are. But during his training, Jonas learns about the true meaning of life; its joys and pains which have been eradicated from the Community. During this whole time, a baby boy named Gabriel has been transferred to Jonas's family unit, to be taken care by his father, a Nurturer. Gabriel could not sleep soundly, and was sentenced to be 'Released' at first, but was given the chance to be cared by Jonas's parents, to see if he could change his sleeping habits. However, Jonas soon learns that Release was not all what he thought it was; it was not just the simple, humane and helpful act of transferring disabled citizens of the community to somewhere else where they could be better cared for. It was something that Jonas did not even think the Committee could ever imagine doing until the Giver shows Jonas 'Release' before his very own eyes...  The book is a thoughtful and reflective read. It demonstrates how humans can become ignorant and toss away what is important and welcome unnatural things that they think are important into their lives. The only flaw in this book is that there is no clear ending of what happens to Jonas (who escapes the Community with Gabriel after seeing the Release). Readers are left at the cliffhanger worrying what Jonas will end up in. However, this might also leave readers pensive and allow them to think more on the book and its true meaning. Overall, a good and timeless read.

Please go back to \\"Felt Mountain\\", now thats music. I hope Alison & Will read this because your fans deserve better!!! \\"Voicething\\" is the best bet on the CD, an Edda Dell'Orso or Bjork vocalizing thing going on. \\"Hunt\\" is the only other track thats worthy of listening to in my opinion! The title should be \\"Head First Into The Trash Can\\". Please Goldfrapp give us our music back...

B00000IL26|5.0|Five stars for the music.    If you decide, after reading the critial reviews that maybe the new RVG remastering isn't for you, or would like to compare music samples between the RVG remastering and the sound of the original Blue Note release, here's how to find the original remastering, which sounds warm and full and really pleasant (like often original Blue Note releases sound). I very often prefer the older releases.    You can pick it up for less than a dollar (plus 2.98 shipping). I did :)    This item is often hidden in the search results, but here's a direct link:    http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000005HCM/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&me=&seller=    or search amazon for:    B000005HCM    Enjoy!

0805091742|5.0|Why, with all our expertise and training and technology, are there so many mistakes?<br />Atul Gawande goes a long way toward answering this question.  As it turns out, we can probably do vastly better at what we do by employing a humble, low-tech tool: the checklist. Through a variety of stories, the kind that make him such an entertaining read, Gawande demonstrates that it is not a lack of talent, or lack of desire to do a good job, or lack of expertise that diminishes outcomes.  Rather, it is that our brains are not dependable or exhaustive record keepers.  We can develop skill and create, but we forget.<br />And depending on what we forget, that can have a dramatic effect on our outcomes.<br />More expertise won't help.  The age of the master builder, who knew everything about the structure being erected, has yielded to the age of the super-specialist where even the separate disciplines of medicine are being further split and differentiated.  Surgeons are more educated and at least as skilled in their practice as architects and pilots are in theirs.  So, why do so few buildings fail and planes crash and so many patients have complications?  The answer may be alarmingly basic.<br />My experience coaching investment advisors present me with exactly this conundrum, one reason I was drawn to the book as soon as I heard about it.  As in medicine, financial professionals have more knowledge and skill than at any time in the past.  And we routinely make mistakes.  Leave things out.  Forget stuff.  Sometimes, it means a disappointed client.  Sometimes it leads us to make an investment that hurts a portfolio.<br />We have so much knowledge to track and catalog.  Our brains routinely fail us in recalling what we need to know and when.  Fortunately, we can utilize external tools to ensure we address all the critical issues, and it can be as simple as a piece of paper.  But how do we design an effective list?  How do we successfully integrate it into the activity we want to accomplish?  And why, when the power and reliability of this device has been so widely proven, do we so ardently resist using it?  These are questions Gawande explores in his engaging style.  He works through those questions to assist the World Heath Organization in improving surgical outcomes globally. And demonstrates the challenges and rewards of developing and implementing checklists in his own practice.<br />He doesn't tell us how to design our checklists, probably because he can't.  Each situation will be custom.  But in recounting the history and describing his own frustrations and successes, he shows us a path to make this tool our own.hy, when the power and reliability of this device has been so widely proven, do we so ardently resist using it?

0316069906|4.0|The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because it didn't feel like there was an option for good choices at the end. Reality is, there probably aren't any good food options except for growing your own. Safran Foer takes his quest to feed his child right to a whole new level with writing this book. I'm glad I read it and the information has already impacted the way I am spending my food dollars. No more so-called cage free eggs at the grocery store or at restaurants. I wish everyone would take the time to explore where their food really comes from.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|LISTEN UP, PEOPLE (or, as Drago would say, after firing his gun, PEOPLE, PEOPLE, PEOPLE!!) -- Anyone buying McLINTOCK should realize that the Paramount DVD depicted above, which is authorized by the John Wayne Estate, is the ONLY DVD edition that will look good and be complete. It's sad to read one-star reviews from purchasers of this item in 2010 who don't understand that any other DVD version is a bootleg and will not look or sound remotely like a proper professional release of the movie. And the Paramount edition does, indeed, look and sound sensational, and doubly so as it's the first time the movie has been shown letterboxed on home video, in the correct aspect ratio and the full image visible.

0547258305|5.0|This addicting novel ate both my homework and three hours of sleeping time. This vivid novel will always remain prominent in my mind; Graceling will never melt into the blur of YA fantasy. It is the type of book that I will be quite sorry to return to the library; I have the strong desire to place it on the prized section of my bookshelf. With a flawed yet likeable ensemble of characters, a fast-paced plot, and an original concept, Graceling is one of the top five YA novels of the year. The actual idea of Gracelings is amazing; it made me jealous that I didn't think of it first. Gracelings are gifted with a supernatural power at birth, and the sign of this power is shown by eyes of two different colors. The Graces that Gracelings can be born with can be as useless as the ability to rotate one's entire torso, or as powerful as the ability to read minds.    The characters are one of the strongest aspects of this book. Eighteen-year-old Katsa, the main character, is a fierce heroine who defies all weak women stereotypes. It's quite refreshing to have a female protagonist who can protect herself and those around her, opposed those stereotypical, helpless women who never engage in a battle. Katsa's character develops beautifully, and her mental journey is centered on her humanization and finding the ability to cope with love. In the early pages of the novel, Katsa reflects upon herself:        \\"She knew her nature. She would recognize it if she came face-to-face with it. It would be a blue-eyed, green-eyed monster, wolflike and snarling. A vicious beast that struck out at friends in uncontrollable anger, a killer that offered itself as a vessel of the king's fury.\\" - page 137    Then we have Prince Po, who is a superb character. The only personal problem I have with him is his name - Whenever I read \\"Po\\", two other people jump into my head: Po from Kung Fu Panda, which is sort of fitting since both characters are gifted in marshal art skills, and the more dissimilar one,Po from Teletubbies*. Besides that miniscule and forgivable downfall, the author executes the romance between Katsa and Po fantastically by letting their relationship develop naturally, not at all like the annoyingly unrealistic sudden-true-love-within-twenty-four-hours romance scenarios in Twilight.    Another aspect I like about this book is the villain. The author counters Katsa's powerful ability to kill anybody she desires by gifting the villain with an equally powerful skill, causing the plot to take many extremely interesting turns. Surprising us with unsuspected movements of the storyline, this book is not as predictable as it may seem.    Though simple and clean, in some places, Cashore's writing bothers me. It is slightly choppy, and I would not agree with the praise on the book's back that describes her writing as \\"elegant, evocative prose\\". Fortunatly, the dazzling plot and characters outshine her mediocre writing. On the contrary, I noticed that Cashore manages to make her description, which is often the more boring part of a book, very exciting to read, sometimes by integrating it with the action. For example:        \\"She couldn't believe the coldness of this passageway over the mountains. She couldn't believe wind couldblow so hard and so insistently, without ever easing. Every breath of this air was a blade gouging into her lungs. Her arms, her legs, her torso, especially her hands - every part of her that was not covered with fur burned with cold, as if she had thrown herself into a fire.\\" - page 352    Cashore describes the freezing conditions while still engaging my attention, which is part of the reason why this book is such an addicting read!    In conclusion, this novel is a rich, well-blended medley of action-packed battles, violence, mystery, suspense, romance, heroism, snappy dialogue, and superpowers. If you have not read Graceling, go get it from your library, or even better: buy it! After finishing this book, fans will ravish down its prequel, Fire, and eagerly await the release of Bitterblue.    Cover Rating (US Hardcover): 4/5 - I love the sword in the background and the color scheme, and the eye reflected in the sword adds more essence. Especially after reading the book, I realize that the pretty cover is quite well done, capturing the book's charm. Though it captures the feel of this novel, I wish it was more distinguished. Something about the cover reminds me of other fantasy novels, and I probably wouldn't pick it up if I was in a bookstore.    For more, go to my blog at [...]

0316069906|3.0|The rise in consumer awareness of what we eat is to be encouraged and celebrated. In this book Jonathan Safran Foer presents his personal journey through the US meat industry.  The vivid pictures he paints of farms and slaughter houses are deeply disturbing and depressing, although, perhaps most sadly of all, not surprising.    The author calls upon witnesses from all corners of the industry who hold a broad spectrum of views. These observers, disarming in their honesty, provide humor, pathos and add depth of feeling to a subject most of us would frankly rather ignore. The book is well written, moving the reader deftly from the traditions of his grandmother's kitchen to sadism in the modern slaughterhouse.    On occasion, Safran Foer references The Omnivore's Dilemma by Michael Pollan which covers aspects of the same subject. These are critical in nature and unfortunately not always strictly relevant or necessary, somewhat diminishing the force of Safran Foer's arguments.     More problematically, however, Safran Foer fails to take his arguments to their logical conclusion: he advocates vegetarianism due to the tragic life and death of nearly all animals in the meat industry. Many points he raises (admittedly not all, but the author repeatedly tries to avoid drawing arbitrary lines) apply equally to the dairy and egg-laying industries. Therefore, veganism would be the most ethically coherent rejection of this system. However, one suspects that a call to veganism would not resonate nearly as much with the book-buying public.    This last point notwithstanding, knowledge of what we eat and what it means to us both personally and globally is to be strived for: \\"Eating Animals\\"  is thought-provoking and a worthy addition to the body of work assessing the modern food industry.
B00030DEQE|2.0|From everything I read about this Intel network adapter card, it should have worked well with my computer on which I had recently installed Windows 7 64-bit Ultimate.  However, when I had trouble getting it to work correctly after a normal install, I searched the Intel support website, only to find that Intel supports only a very few of their network adapter cards under Windows 7 64-bit, and this is not one of them.  While I accept it as my mistake that I bought the card without checking the Intel support site for compatibility before I made the purchase (the Amazon product descripton provided no indication of Win 7 compatibility), I strongly suggest that anyone planning to purchase an Intel network adapter check the Intel support site for compatibility with Windows 7 before pulling the trigger.
B000BSLU2S|5.0|I have a moderately large heat sink on my CPU, but it only does any good if it has a solid contact with the CPU.

B002QEXN2K|5.0|Another awesome CD from John Mayer.  Continuum has always been my favorite, but after listening to Battle Studies a couple of times, I think it's better.  Where Continuum is full of slower, powerful songs, Battle Studies has a lot more quicker, upbeat songs.      My favorites are Perfectly Lonely, Assassins, War of My Life and Edge of Desire.  All we Ever Do and Half of My Heart are slower, but also very catchy.  You can listen to this disc from start to finish and over and over.    Highly recommend!
B0033TJATW|5.0|I really enjoyed the whole video. Some of the segments are really funny. I couldn't stop laughing. Other segments are dark and disturbing. They all give you a window into the creative mind of Michael Jackson. The movie opens with a production of Man In the Mirror, a mixture of a few different live performances from the Bad tour. The performances are so passionate you can feel the energy coming right through the TV. You can understand why people are fainting and crying! Lots of little gems in this video. The video was pressed overseas, but there weren't any flaws. The picture and sound quality are good.

1423113381|2.0|I pre-ordered this book for my kindle and was quite excited to receive it.  I am a big fan of Egyptian history as well as the Percy Jackson series. What I got was essentially Egyptian mythology retold in nearly the same manner as the Percy Jackson series except with different characters. The gods and goddesses have nearly the same ways of appearing and disappearing and being explained into loss or existence as they do in Percy Jackson. The magical methods of travel (enter in one spot in the USA and emerge in another in just a moment or two) were almost the same (except for different methods of travel as they relate to the myths).  The characters were very similar to those of Percy and his fellow demigod (only now they are called godlings).  I found very little new and refreshing here. There is still the element of not being able to trust anyone, people are lost then found, lots of sarcasm, etc. In terms of Sadie and Carter (and I am reiterating what others have said), their \\"voices\\" sound almost identical. It was only when one of them mentioned the other that I was alerted to who I was \\"listening\\" to...otherwise, I often got them confused. He seems to have churned this one out using the same formula as he did for Percy Jackson.  Overall, if you are not familiar with Percy Jackson, it would be an exciting, adventurous story with sassy and honorable protagonists. If, however, you were looking for something new after Percy Jackson, this probably is not it. I don't think I will be ordering the next one.

B001UW58YK|4.0|very good this show. Good sound, good songs, but the image resolution could have a little better ..
1423113381|4.0|First, I felt the book had a deeper, more complex plot than any of the Percy Jackson books.  How Riordan weaves accurate Egyptian mythology into his works is wonderous.  But, I thought this also caused a bit of confusion.  Egyptian myth is not as commonly known as Greek myth, and I found myself becoming confused at times with the many varied mythological monsters and beasties.  It was tough keeping them all straight.  Also the shifting narration from Sadie and Carter worked well at times but did throw me off a few other times.  If I found myself confused, a 38 year old history teacher, then it might frustrate some younger readers.      I also found myself towards the middle of the book drifting.  It was taking too long for me for the protagonists to unravel the mysterious plot.  This may also be due to the fact that this is a longer work compared to the Last Olympian books.  But, I've never been known for patience or a lengthy attention span.    But I can say that the climax of the book and ending were very satisfying and well worth any trudging through the middle.  I read ravenously towards the end and laughed out loud multiple times and was very saddened once (I got better).  The book's ending sets up some very exciting possibilities for the future of this series, and I'll be sure to preorder those as they come.  For younger reluctant readers though, hit them with the Percy Jackson series first unless they have an insatiable appetite for all things Egypt.
B001CD6FKI|1.0|Because this is the most confusing movie I've ever seen.  I was able to discern who the good guys and the bad guys were, but beyond that, I couldn't tell what was going on throughout the movie.  Where are they?  WHEN are they?  Who's that?  Why do they care about that?  Why are they trying to kill him?<br /><br />But perhaps this whole thing was brilliance on the director's part, successfully mimicking the sensation of spinning out of control and smacking a wall?

0374531269|4.0|I listened to the audio version of the book and I think hearing the words spoken aloud made this book touch my core.    I see that there is some controversy surrounding the validity of this book - and a few harsh reviews questioning Ismael's experiences. From my point of view, when I read a book that has received this much publicity, I expect that there will be a certain degree of sensationalism. I expect, especially in the case of an adolescent, drugged and taked off to war, to report inaccuracies, to mix up dates, and to remember things somewhat differently from how they may have actually occurred. This is the basis of many theories of memory in psychology. In fact, if you do a few minutes of research, you will see (1) that 2 people can witness a car crash but recall significantly different stories; and (2) see that there have been cases of people wrongly being charged of sexual abuse due to false memories.     But I digress.    This book, fact or fiction, memories of one boy or the compilation of several (as the accusations go), is still astounding. The experiences of child soldiers is heartbreaking and terrifying. The images in my mind as I heard the recounts of the violent and horrific acts can not be erased. I was truly moved by the lost innocence of the young soldiers; horrified by the violence and the torture tactics and the many, many deaths; and deeply touched when Ismael meets his family, and by his experience in New York.    If you havent read this book, please dont tell the controversy scare you away. It is still a fascinating read about an experience that American children can not even imagine.
B002ZG997C|5.0|A fine post-apocalypse tale with the Hughes bros, Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman, Jennifer Beals, etc, doing a bang-up job bringing this taut, well-made cautionary tale to the screen. I strongly suggest that anyone thinking about ordering the DVD read the 1-star reviews first, take note of their uniformly angry, bitter, vitriolic tone...then order the DVD anyway. Movies that make people on the fringe so angry they would burn all existing copies if they could, must be doing something right! If you missed this edgy, scary thriller in the theater, don't be deceived by the agenda-driven 1-star reviews. This is an excellent, thoughtful film that will stay with you and haunt you for a long, long time.
B0011NVC9I|5.0|To watch this movie you need to judge it on it's own merits, not based on any perceived accuracy to a thousand year old poem. Too many reviewers write it off because it doesn't follow a rather old and boring poem, which yes I have read.    I personally find this new story better. I find the characters more multidimensional, and the overall plot more interesting.     So what makes this movie better than other animated films we've seen? It has to be the intangibles people do not often talk about. The directing, editing, cinematography (or the animation equivalent), choreography, sound editing, and musical score are all top notch, and all the best I've ever seen in an animated feature.     The acting is very good as well, Robin Wright Penn, is probably the weak point, but all the other players do well. Granted, the motion capture technology Robert Zemeckis is pioneering doesn't get every facial twitch, but it gets most now. I wonder if many of the negative reviewers realize the faces were actually performances as caught by motion capture technology.     I won't even comment at how good the graphics were, that some people went into the film thinking it was live action should tell you that, but I think as a society we've gone beyond judging animation based on how real it looks. What is more important? The story, they directing, or how real it looks? We like movies like \\"300\\" which look unreal on purpose.     I originally saw this film in IMAX 3d, and that was a great experience, but I've also seen in on the small screen a few times and it still holds up. Don't believe the negative reviewers, some people will hate anything that isn't live action, and some people will never accept a Beowulf movie that doesn't stick to the original one dimensional poem. But if you want to be entertained, and have an appreciation for the skills of a director, you should watch this. I think, if the story was exactly the same, the actors exactly the same, and the directing/camera shots/settings/angles/action choreography were all the same, but it WAS live action (and maybe not called Beowulf to not offend the literature snobs) it would have been universally lauded. But those who dislike it, mostly dislike out of prejudice against animation and against non-faithful reimaginings of old and dusty poems.
0307454541|4.0|I bought this a month ago and was quite surprised at how quickly I became engrossed in it. I barreled through it in a few days. But I felt that the book could have been 50-100 pages shorter; too many details about secondary or lesser characters that was unnecessary.  And the ending was a little too quick and unsatisfactory, until I remembered it was the first of a trilogy. But even with that it was a good book.
0790740443|3.0|This is one of my husband's favorite movies.  I don't think it's great, but over time I've come to enjoy it.  It's what we call a \\"B\\" movie, sort of middle-of-the-road - the acting's pretty good, the special effects are OK, the script is fair.  Kurt Russell is my husband's favorite actor, so that's probably why the movie ranks so high with him.  I watch it for Jason Isaacs, who plays a secondary part as a nasty military guy.<br /><br />I had a greater appreciation of the movie after listening to the commentary by the director and others.  It's very informative and fairly funny in parts (the interplay between Paul Anderson and Jason Isaacs, who are apparently friends as well as co-workers, is very enjoyable).  Sometimes I think it helps to hear what they went through while making the movie and why they chose to do this or that.  I was amazed to hear that Russell broke his ankle early in the shoot and they had to work around that.  I was also surprised that prior to filming he spent over a year in the gym creating his look for the movie.  That's dedication.<br /><br />I won't go over the plot since others have done it very well already.  The movie is a Western disguised as a sci-fi story.  I don't think it's as derivative of other movies as Anderson's \\"Event Horizon\\", which is in its favor.<br /><br />So, make some popcorn and enjoy the movie - once to hear the dialogue, and once with the commentary on.

B003CH8WZS|5.0|Don't be afraid to disturb the neighbors. Just because Hackett recorded this mostly in the living room of his house direct to computer, and thus hardly making a sound out side the headphones, doesn't mean you should litsen to it that way. This deserves to be played loud. The eight songs here on the first disc play to all of Hackett's strengths. The dynamics go from hushed, Bach influenced interludes to wailing crescendoes full of extraordinary dynamics. Added to the mix are magnificent contributions from his regular band, including Roger King, and special colleagues, namely Anthony Phillips and Chris Squire. If there is a drawback to this, it is Squire as he does tend to overwhelm Phillips and Hackett. You can adjust the bass down on his contribution. The great thing is he plays with abandon and that's clearly the order of the day.  To hear Phillips and Hackett essay their efforts on acoustic 12 and 6 string guitars is to listen to the craft of playing at its very highest. And all this didgery do is in service to the songs themselves, which are among Hackett's very best. There are world influences from Andalusia to Istanbul, compelling rhythm work and imaginative lyrics. I had never been much of a fan of Hackett's voice, but he holds his own strongly on this outing. In fact, I can not imagine anyone else singing these songs with more authority.  The second disc is a collection of live cuts, hallmarks of his Genesis years. Blood on the Rooftops and Fifth of Firth are absolutely brilliant. The closer is an extra living room track. All in all, not just a bunch of extras, but songs with a life and vitality of their own.  This is a superb outing in every respect. If you are a Genesis fan, this is the best post Genesis album by any member, including Gabriel, since Hackett's revisiting of his G catalogue a few years back. If you are simply a fan of great guitar work, this ranks at the top. For Hackett, it excels in ways I wouldn't have expected. By all means, pick this up.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|\\"(500) Days of Summer\\" is a unique film about Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a young greeting card writer who falls head over heels in love with Summer (Zooey Deschanel), a new assistant in his office. Summer tells Tom right off the bat that she's not looking for anything serious, but he can't help himself from falling hard for her. When Summer decides the relationship has run its course, Tom feels like his life is about to end.<br /><br />This movie is told in a series of flashbacks that occur before, during, and after the relationship. It's a very creative film that handles a sensitive topic very well, and I'm sure it's a movie that anyone who has ever had their heart broken can relate to. The narrator of the film warns us at the start of the movie that this is not a love story, but viewers may fail to listen to him just as poor Tom doesn't listen to Summer, and therefore not everyone will like the way the movie ends. However, I think this is a brilliant little film, and I really enjoyed it.
0783227434|5.0|I never thought that Sam Raimi could possibly do anything crazier than EVIL DEAD 2. I was wrong. ARMY OF DARKNESS is the perfect horror-comedy, w/ an unleashed and unhinged Bruce Campbell reprising his role as Ash. AOD is an overdose of non-stop hilarity and insane slapstick. Campbell has never matched his wild performance here. Almost every line he utters is quotable! His feel for physical comedy is sublime. Watch as Ash takes one flogging after another, battling demons, zombie doppelgangers, and a skeleton army! If you like a bit of madness in your horror, you can't do any better than this classic...

B003AYPMBU|5.0|Without a shadow of a doubt do i guarantee that you will not regret this purchase. This is a classic piece of Judas Priest and heavy metal history and i was fortunate enough to see them live during their summer British Steel tour. From beginning to end this concert will rock your socks off. I am truely amazed at how much better Judas Priest seem to sound as the years continue to go by. You get the remastered British Steel album which sounds very good and you get the live DVD which is great. The DVD is filled with 16 explosive live music that'll keep you rocking till the dawn. Judas Priest sound so amazing live, that if i can, I would Strongly reccomend that you pick up the 3 Disc Deluxe version of the British Steel pack. I can tell you that i have not regreted getting the live CD and they just sound amazing when you blast the music. The Priest truly sound amazing and there are no signs of the priest stopping and i cannot for next years priest tour and who isn't to say that we wont be seeing remakes of other albums the priest has made.
1932100660|5.0|I have read a number of books on diet and nutrition and didn't expect much different from this one.  I was wrong.  Uniquely, this book has a large amount of science-based data on nutrition and disease and makes a compelling case for changing what we eat.  Whether or not you follow the recommendations and move toward becoming vegetarian or vegan (I have), the book is an interesting read and clearly debunks the healthfulness of many fad diets.  I bought copies for my kids and hope they and their families change their diets as a result.

B0038Z5SEW|4.0|\\"The Edge\\" was originally released in 1997 and is now being treated in the high-definition Blu-Ray style we are becoming accustomed to. It was directed by Lee Tamahori who later went on to more action-y films like \\"Die Another Day\\" and \\"xXx: State of the Union.\\" It was written by David Mamet, brilliant playwright and screenwriter who also wrote \\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\" five years earlier featuring Alec Baldwin. The story is that of billionaire Charles Morse played by Anthony Hopkins coming with his model wife Mickey Morse played by Elle Macpherson to Alaska for a photo shoot with photographer Bob Green played by Alec Baldwin and his assistant Stephen played by Harold Perrineau (whom you might know now as Michael from \\"LOST\\"). When the men go off in a plane in search of that perfect shot, it crashes and they are forced to struggle to survive in the wilderness over 80 miles from where they began lost in the woods.<br /><br />What this movie has works in spades. First you have the location which is perfect. Then there is the writing and development of two main characters whose layers peel away like an onion when put to the test in survival mode. The direction and chosen camera angles build up the suspense in an amazing way. There are close-ups and angles used where you can only see one character in the shot and you are convinced that something is going to come up behind them or the person they are talking to any second. Most of the time it doesn't, but when it does....WOW!<br /><br />Having Anthony Hopkins' stony disposition at the forefront gives an aura of experience hardly any man can match and Alec Baldwin looks almost foolish occasionally by comparison. Hopkins has a gift for being mysterious and eccentric while flashing the slightest of occasional smiles to appear human (or creepy). The character Charles is a genius of sorts picking up facts wherever he goes and retaining them, and claims to hardly ever put them to use. He is put to the test here in the ultimate survival situation in the middle of nowhere dealing with injuries, a giant bear, weather, and the men in his company losing their cool. There is particular tension between Charles and Bob over a woman. Alec Baldwin attempts to pull out all the stops by cracking jokes, having a mental breakdown, and oozing tears in moments of ultimate weakness. He achieves what he was going for because that's what he appears -- weak. Charles on the other hand despite all manner of challenges never fails to lose his cool and stoically plots out plans of action logically with little emotion and treats it all as a puzzle to solve instead of despairing.<br /><br />Bart the Bear gives one of the best animal performances EVER in this film. He's one of the biggest bears I have ever seen in my life and absolutely terrifying to behold. He has such a presence in this film that he gets fifth billing and he earned it. As a psycho maneater bear, I was awestruck by his imposing size and determination to run after those men for dinner.<br /><br />The scenery in the Alaskan wilderness is breathtakingly beautiful even when the wandering survivors are exhausted and at the brink of starvation, the mountains will catch your eye and you'll wish you could be there in that moment to experience the majesty. The plot of the movie is thrilling and suspenseful but with the added bonus of the atmosphere tagged on, this film goes to a whole other level of enjoyment captivating the senses.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />Some trailers for Broken Arrow and other films you've forgotten about that will undoubtedly be released on Blu-Ray soon. Very surprising that they couldn't find SOMETHING to put on here for the new storage capacity. There must be reliance on picture quality alone for people to go out and pick this copy up.in the middle of nowhere dealing with injuries, a giant bear, weather, and the men in his company losing their cool.

055358894X|5.0|Modern fantasy tends to ape the current bestsellers - bloated Robert Jordan type epics in the 90s, gritty war-and-politics stories in the George Martin era. The Lies of Locke Lamora is awesome because it doesn't fall into this trap; Scott Lynch realized that it's better to make something original.    Originality is something this book has in spades. The city, Camorr, breathes with life, even more than the famous New Crobuzon of China Mieville's books. Equal parts Renaissance Venice and early modern London, it feels real in a way fantasy cities rarely do, with a culture and a political economy that actually seem plausible and consistent. The characters are anything but cliche, and the villains are some of the most evil I've ever encountered. And the ending is awesome, despite the fact that there is a sequel, which is the rarest of rarities in the fantasy genre.    The book's one limitation is the slight predictability of many of its plot elements. Though the story is twisted, convoluted, and wildly original, Lynch has a tendency to telegraph his punches a bit - you kind of know how the characters are going to react to a situation before they know it themselves. But maybe I've just read too much fantasy.    In any case, The Lies of Locke Lamora is, in my opinion, the best book to come out of the \\"new fantasy\\" crowd of Lynch, Abercrombie, Rothfuss, Bakker, Sanderson, etc. It breathes new life into the genre.
0316010669|5.0|This is my third Malcolm Gladwell book in the last 12 months. The title makes it sound like one of those hand-wavy, self-improvement books that will help you be all you can be. Instead it it is a deep look at the power of first impressions and what really happens in those first micro-seconds (ie. in the Blink of an eye).

0142000655|5.0|Quite simply one of the most brilliant American examinations of the consequences of this kind of popular dichotomy, of our need to classify things in terms of good and evil.  One warning to all potential readers, please please please do NOT see the James Dean film they made from this.  The novel is incredibly rich.  The Trask and other families are amazingly complex and the history of their lives and times is rich.  Steinbeck was a brilliant craftsman with a great flair for allegory.  James Dean was a moment of teenager angst.
1400067936|3.0|This book has a lot of overlap with the other book, \\"Black Swan\\" in more ways that one.<br /><br />1. It is necessary to fish through the book to find the author's points. The whole book could have been written in just over 1/2 the space that it actually took to write it.<br /><br />2. The author's ego came through on every page. Every single page. Every single, solitary page. Has there ever been a book in which \\"I\\" was used more often?<br /><br />3. In a continuation of the first point, the author chose some very strange subtitles for each chapter. For example: \\"Wax in My Ears\\" went off on a story about someone who was tied to a mast and had wax put in his sailors ears so as to have them be able to avoid the Sirens' song. And can you imagine that it took all that just to say that the author does not listen to readers comments?<br /><br />4. The book started off easily enough to read and then seemed to get exponentially harder as time went on. By the time I got to the last 50 pages or so, it was dragging along enough for me to read it.<br /><br />Taleb's \\"....more on that later\\" was REALLY annoying. What would have been the problem with addressing a point from start to finish? It seems like he used that phrase 10 or 15 times in the book.<br /><br />On the good side:<br /><br />1. The author did make some good points (that had actually been made before) such as the difference between the Utopian Vision and the Tragic Vision.<br /><br />2. There were some definitions of finance terms that I had not heard before, and the book was useful in that sense.<br /><br />In summary:<br /><br />1. Interestingness: Great topic, but verbose presentation.<br />2. Ease of Reading: Not as good as it might have been<br />3. Coherence: Fair. The whole structure of the book would have been helped by a glossary and subtitles that clearly pointed to the topic<br />4. Value of Information/ unit of time: Fair. As before, if the book had gotten to the point, the value of information gathered per unit of time could have gotten much better.
0553582038|5.0|I never thought I would ever like a book that was pure fantasy. I have loved these books and am patiently awaiting the fifth.  The story takes place in a fantasy country, the very cold North and warm South. Above them all is a wall of ice 700 feet high built for many thousands years protecting the country from wildlings, giants and other strange things. The wall is managed by people sent to the wall by punishment and although they hated to go it was better then hanging. They are called the black and end up very close since they need each other's help to guard the wall and stay alive. This story is about a land torn apart by Lords who wish to be kings instead of being governed by one king of the realm causing much war. The story is told through each character, some you will love and some you will hate. This is an exciting and fun series, but it is written in a more realistic manner which for me makes it great. This is about many people and not just one powerful person which makes for exciting and fun reading. It is a series you will come to love whether or not you are a fantasy reader.

0307387178|5.0|This work began with a fascination about Christopher McCandless' tragic and touching story, but one senses that it evolved into a beautiful medication on what it means to be a young man in an age when so many young men are left wanting for father figures and searching for meaning in the wide world.  Krakauer's chapter on his own youthful adventure felt out of place initially, but the more I thought about it the more I liked having it there.  McCandless' story touched a very deep nerve in American culture and there is something about finding oneself as a man in the world without fathers that leads us to take these kinds of risks, even members of the bubble wrapped and disneyfied generations will continue to do these things and defy the mainstream \\"social critics.\\"  Krakauer captures the essence of what it is to be in this place of wandering and seeking as a young angry Odysseus in our culture so fixated with crap that we understand McCandless and his desires even if we don't agree with his means.  Krakauer's writing and instincts are as sharp as ever and this story with its central character that seems to exemplify integrity has as many oblique edges as can be found in any great tale.  I only wish there were more young men like Chris McCandless about.
B003K3OF78|3.0|I absolutely loved the first two Keane albums.  Under the Iron Sea was almost a religious experience to listen to.  However, I bought Perfect Symmetry without listening and discovered how truly awful it was most of the way through, with a few sort of OK \\"Keane\\" songs near the end.  The 80's synth thing was just plain bad and completely unimaginative.      I hear a lot less of that mess in this album.  It's more what I was expecting Keane to evolve into, with a little hip-hop added in.  Obviously these guys are into that sort of thing, and they do a reasonable job of it without ruining their work with it.  Still, this is only getting 3 stars from me instead of 4 b/c it's way too short.  8 songs, plus that Amazon-only hokey remix?  How bout a few more songs, fellas?  I'm still coughing up for it.

(HA HA)    This movie is one of my favorite movies of ALL times!! I believe that if you want to see   a film that was pretty well made in the day of B&W you would throughly enjoy this nail-biting  film.     Norman is hard to hate, he is such a \\"good\\" Mother's boy. He obeys everything that his Mother   tells him to do. He works hard at the motel and waits on her hand and foot! She says to do   something and he will greatly honor his Mother. He has some issues because of the absence of his  Father, but he really really has feelings towards his Mother.

B001GS0O88|4.0|I saw the movie years ago, but I remember it quite well. I sorta like reading  books after I see the movie that way I can put an actual face on the characters.  The movie was a little different but the story line was the same. Grisham is a talented   writer but I don't like the way he portrayed blacks in the south as if they are all a bunch of poor  ignorant folks who walk around singing \\"We Shal Overcome\\" hell I don't even know the  words to the dam song! All in all it was pretty good for his first book.

B001JQTSG6|5.0|Ahh \\"Raging Bull\\". The movie that should have won picture of the year in 1980, but the Academy was probably too shocked and repulsed to award it. So it won for Best Editing and Best Actor. Which is great. Does anyone remember the picture that won for 1980? \\"Ordinary People\\". Which by itself is a very good picture. But nothing comes close to \\"Raging Bull\\". Few films still do after almost 30 years. That is the power of \\"Raging Bull\\". Jake LaMotta is not a nice person. But he could possibly be considered the Mike Tyson of his era. A troubled youth turns his energies to becoming a world class athlete, only to totally self destruct outside the ring. His attributes inside the ring are applauded, outside they lead to his downfall and arrest.<br /><br />Anyone with a Blu-ray player must have this film in their collection. Now all we need is \\"Taxi Driver\\" with the Criterion LD commentary, and all will be right. The opening alone is enough to go buy this film. In fact, there are just a handful of movies where the opening defines the movie. They are:<br /><br />\\"Raging Bull\\"<br />\\"Apocalypse Now\\"<br />\\"The Godfather\\"<br />\\"Midnight Cowboy\\"<br />\\"The Graduate\\"<br />\\"The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly\\"<br />\\"For A Few Dollars More\\"<br />\\"A Fistful Of Dollars\\"<br />\\"West Side Story\\"<br />Any James Bond Film<br /><br />There are more, but you know where I'm coming from. In the end, why haven't you bought this Blu-ray?
B001GCUO4S|1.0|Well, they managed to sunk this franchise further below (spoilers below).<br /><br />The thinny (but eventually engaging) premise made this franchise survive more than the only one film that it deserved. After all, it was a clever idea: who can be a stronger vilain than Death itself?<br /><br />The previous three movies did never bother to even try to explain the following questions:<br /><br />a) Why the main character has/acquires the premonition power?<br /><br />b) Why Death goes through all the trouble to plan extremely intricate plots to get his victims after they survive its first plan?<br /><br />c) Why all the teen characters, when faced with such tremendous odds, appears to have no relatives, parents, friends, contacts, anyone who could help them?<br /><br />This fourth chapter bothers even less with answering those questions. Also, it's extremely more cruel than the others before: there's not even a hint of hope for the characters to survive (and they don't) And the cast sunk to a new low: performances were uniformly lousy, to a point that you simply don't care. You simply doesn't know nothing about them: if they are students, if they work, whatever.<br /><br />To make things worse, the writer planned a \\"twist\\": after all the struggle fighting Death's inegenious plans, the main characters figures that Death had planned for them to die that wat all along. Naughty Death...<br /><br />Anyway, this is indeed the worst of the four movies.<br /><br />But they will make another, be sure of that... At least, they could gather an audience by promising to explain why the premonitions occur...
B002VECM4A|5.0|I used this video as an introdution to Adolescent Health for pediatric nurse practitioner students. We only watched the first half and will do the whole movie again at the end of the course.     The movie was \\"a punch in the belly\\" for seasoned and novice clinicians yet one student said: \\"This happens in my neighborhood every day.\\"    Sometimes art can let us get to places that textbooks and course outlines and evaluation methods cannot. I think that the movie opened possiblilities to these students that will allow them to approach adolescents with broader minds when they begin their practical experiences.

B0021L8V1G|5.0|Behind the armored suits and superb special effects, Iron Man 2 is a tough story of a fall from grace and redemption. Director Jon Favreau and Robert Downey Jr. (reprising Tony Stark/Iron Man) dare to give the man behind the iron mask a mission besides saving the world: saving himself, with a little help from unexpected friends.<br /><br />As the story begins, Tony Stark faces the consequences of revealing his Iron Man identity.  The government and a rival arms inventor (an over-the-top Sam Rockwell) want the suit; a revenge-seeking Russian physicist (a perfectly cast Mickey Rourke) is after Tony; and Tony himself is being poisoned by the miniature nuclear reactor that keeps him alive.  Tony slowly self-destructs, wrecking his business, his relationships with long-suffering personal assistant Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Air Force buddy Rhodey (Don Cheadle), and finally his status as Iron Man.<br /><br />At rock bottom, Tony gets a hand up from Colonel Nick Fury of SHIELD (a nicely restrained Samuel L. Jackson).  Fury provides Tony with a means, and a motivation, to work out his own salvation.  En route to a smashing finale, Tony gets a key assist from Fury's undercover contact inside Stark Industries.  As enigmatic SHIELD agent Black Widow, Scarlett Johansson is \\"all that\\" in a form-fitting unitard; her thrilling hallway fight sequence might have been the centerpiece of a movie with less visual firepower.<br /><br />\\"Iron Man 2\\" is very highly recommended to fans of the franchise as an excellent sequel.  There are hints the next sequel may be an \\"Avengers\\" movie.
0321356683|4.0|If you want to know the good things about this book, read the other reviews, many of which I agree with.  This review just states what makes the book 4 stars for me instead of 5, because none of the other reviews I read pointed them out.    Most of the items in book are very good, a few are great and well worth the price of the book and the time it takes to read it, but some have to be taken with a grain of salt.  They probably make sense if you come from the background of working on the Java API team, as the author does, but wouldn't make much sense on any of the projects I have worked on.  The problem is that all are presented as universal truths and only through experience can you tell which truly are and which can be ignored.    I also feel that some of the items need to be tempered with just plain practical usefulness.  I know that programming a certain way makes the code bullet proof from certain errors by not compiling if those errors are introduced, but if the code is quite a bit harder to understand and those errors are rare, is it really worth it?  Also, some of the items are written as if everything you are writing is being published and supported publicly.  If code and interfaces are just being used between two teams within the company, or even just on a single team, some of the logic used to describe why items are important don't make as much sense.  Again, I just feel that these are something that make complete sense if you are writing on the API team, but not necessarily in every other case.    My final small complaint is that the author tends to be a bit wordy on some of the items, fully explaining out every nuance of the wrong way to do it, which tends to create noise in some explanations that are pretty heavy anyway.    Overall, I would recommend the book, it has already made my programming better.  An additional note is that I did not find any errors in the code examples or even the formatting, something that I find rare in programming books.

B002ZOHVN8|4.0|I am of the opinion that \\"In This Light and On The Evening\\" is The Editors' best album to date. It takes their Joy Division/Interpol roots and pumps up the synths while seriously downplaying the guitars. They also seem more engaged with the songs than on \\"An End Has A Start.\\" And before you know it, I'm making comparisons to Depeche Mode's \\"Black Celebration.\\" As devotees to the new new wave, The Editors have found a solid groove.<br /><br />That much is obvious on the opening track. A pulsing synth may surprise the guitar fans of the prior two albums, but then Tom Smith's deep baritone lets you know that you've got an Editors album on the player. Then comes a big revelation; \\"In this light and on this evening, London's become the most beautiful thing.\\" Smith's happiness meter has spiked up noticeably on this disc, to the band's betterment.<br /><br />That's not to say The Editors have gone completely soft. \\"Raw Meat/Blood Drool\\" is a pretty disturbing number. That said, it also has a memorable hook, which is something that categorizes most of \\"In The Light...\\". There's an obvious effort to make bigger melodies here than before, along with catchy choruses. Make no mistake, The Editors aren't The Archies. But with this album, they've managed to match their passions with their song-craft. Already one of my faves for the year.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|A fascinating, paradigm shifting book for die-hard baseball fans.  You cannot argue with the facts this book explains--nor can you argue with the long-term success the Oakland A's have had by defying \\"conventional wisdom.\\"  More importantly, as a fan of a \\"small market\\" unsuccessful team, I'm amazed more Major League teams aren't following the model explained by Mr. Lewis in this book.  I'm certain the general manager of the Kansas City Royals couldn't do worse if he'd take a look at this book.  If you're a serious fan of baseball, you MUST read this book.  You may not agree with Lewis' conclusions, but you'll definitely re-think how you evaluate what you're watching on the TV.
0316044695|5.0|I am a man of few words and have never written a book review on Amazon. But after reading this book I had to break my silence. I could not put the book down. Even though I had to work the next day,  I read late into the night. I was sleepy all day at work, but when I got home I continued reading the book until I finished it that night. After I finished reading the book, I could not stop thinking about it. I strongly recommend buying this book.

B002VECM6S|5.0|Not to take anything away from Sandra Bullock, who definitely earned her Oscar, but it's Quinton Aaron who truly makes the movie. His eye movements, facial expressions and body language are so good and genuine that you almost forget that you're watching a movie.  And then, even when his character begins to verbally express himself, Aaron still manages to keep it real and genuine all the way up to the end of the film.  It's a shame he was shunned by the Academy, because he deserved to take home an Oscar, too.  I just hope he doesn't become a \\"one-hit wonder\\", because his work in \\"The Blind Side\\" rightfully should open some more doors in the film industry.
B0038P9LTU|5.0|Rhapsody's best release since Dawn of Victory. There are still some of the overly dramatic-narrations in some tracks, but this album delivers some of the best and most memorable songs since legendary tracks like Emerald Sword, Holy Thunderforce, and Dawn of Victory
B000KCHZK6|5.0|Unusually great voice. Stand out songs are \\"Sinkin' soon\\", \\"Thinking about you\\", \\"My dear country\\" and \\"Little room\\".

B0036D7Y34|4.0|\\"Con quest'opera si pu&ograve; dire veramente che ebbe principio la mia carriera artistica.\\" (\\"It can truly be said that my artistic career began with this opera\\"). Verdi may perhaps be forgiven for taking artistic licence with this observation to Ricordi, his publisher; his previous works were the patchy and immature \\"Oberto\\" and the comic flop \\"Un giorno do regno\\". \\"Nabucco\\" marks a huge advance over these two works. Verdi here begins to find his true voice, mining the rich seam of cantilena melody which characterises his best early work and adding to it both psychological profundity and economy of expression.<br /><br />Re-visiting this recording and comparing it with those by Sinopoli and Gardelli, I was struck by the tautness and impact of the libretto and plot. All three recordings have their flaws but all three are to a large degree successful and I found that I had been wrong to relegate this one to third place. Verdi was as incapable as Shakespeare of creating cardboard characters and it is remarkable how both the villains of the piece, Abigaille and Nabucco himself, emerge as complex, tormented souls, far more absorbing than the supposed heroes. They are the forerunners of that long line of father-daughter pairs; Solera's libretto stimulated Verdi's imagination and his emotions at a time when he was trying to emerge from two years of grief and suffering, marked by personal loss and (comparative) artistic failure.<br /><br />Of course, the popularity of \\"Va, pensiero\\", the emphasis upon spectacle, the four marches, unison choruses and brassy scoring all combine to support the reputation of \\"Nabucco\\" as the chauvinistic rallying-call of popular legend. However, in the admixture of private passion and political chicanery, certain situations and even specific musical ideas are clearly proleptic of later, greater works such as \\"Simon Boccanegra\\", although the masterpiece it most resembles in mood, atmosphere and in its melding of extremes is perhaps \\"Aida\\". Certainly his contemporaries thought well enough of it to choose its music to accompany Verdi's funeral cort&egrave;ge.<br /><br />Muti's conducting of this 1977 recording has been condemned as crude and aggressive. He is hectic at times, to be sure, but that is hardly out of keeping with the swift pace of events and he still gives his singers space in the more contemplative passages. By comparison, the more experienced Gardelli lets the action unfold in more relaxed style and has a more persuasive overview of the score. Sinopoli is simply erratic, with to much of a stop-go approach, dissecting every bar and letting tensions droop before trying to whip up passion out of nowhere. Nonetheless, I prefer Sinopoli's brisker, shapelier account of \\"Va, pensiero\\" to Muti's uncharacteristically lugubrious version; Gardelli's lies in between, as you might expect.<br /><br />The eponymous starring role is in all three cases taken by a first class baritone. Manuguerra has the smoothest, most sheerly beautiful voice, with more sap in its upper reaches than the aging Gobbi and more bite than Cappuccilli's woolly tone, but all three bring admirable virtues to the part: Gobbi is of course the most moving and characterful, Cappuccilli displays his celebrated long-breathed line in \\"Deh, perdona\\", while the underrated Manuguerra combines some of the best features of both the others in a detailed, compellingly vocalised account.<br /><br />As Abigaille, all three spinto sopranos - as Scotto had become by this stage of her career - provide the listener with thrills and vocal virtuosity. Dimitrova has a rather thin, wiry tone and the steam-whistle top notes, so typical of a certain type of Slavic soprano, tend to flutter, but she has the range and measure of this fiendish part and I sometimes think its worth owning Sinopoli's recording just to hear her wonderful pianissimo top C alone. She has no especial psychological insights and her registers are disconnected, but it's still a worthy assumption. Suliotis excels in a rôle tailor-made for a fearless, uninhibited twenty-two-year-old of formidable gifts and talent. She, too, suffers from poor integration of the two registers but capitalises on the contrast between her floated top and trenchant low notes. She is, of course, the artist who most recalls the formidable performance of Callas in her 1958 recital conducted by Rescigno. Scotto, too, shares features of Callas's delivery, including a biting delivery of text and the less recommendable lapses into flapping top notes when pressed at forte. When not pressing too hard, Scotto can still float the top and hers is a formidable firebrand of an Abigaille - she is the best actress of all. Given the intensity and conviction of Scotto's performance, I find that I am now much more forgiving of those squally high notes and inclined to prefer her to Dimitrova, who is technically superior but more generic in characterisation.<br /><br />All three basses are fine artists: Nesterenko for Sinopoli has a mighty voice but lacks the warmth and authority of Ghiaurov - who is rusty and occasionally bleak of tone at this stage in his career but still impressive - or Carlo Cava, who has less voice than either but has thought more deeply about the inflection of words and nuances of character. All three make a beautiful job of their aria \\"Tu sul labbro\\", with its beguiling six-part cello accompaniment. Robert Lloyd is a notable High Priest for Muti; I wonder if I am the first to notice that he must have been absent for whatever reason (not worth paying him to sing so little?) during the second, 1978, recording session and thus we hear the unmistakable voice of Ghiaurov, deputising for Lloyd in the High Priest's one line in the finale.<br /><br />In sheer vocal terms, Muti scores over Gardelli with Elena Obratsova's Fenena. Decca made the mistake of simply under-casting Fenena with the inadequate Dora Carral, but the problem with Obratsova is that she has far too much voice for so passive a character. Her stentorian tones are not a good fit for the delicate Fenena, although she vocalises better than either Carral or the late Valentini-Terrani, making a particularly fine job of her prayer in the last act.<br /><br />One of the great pleasures of the Muti set is to hear Veriano Luchetti in the brief and rather ungrateful role of Ismaele. His smooth, ringing, Italianate tenor is far preferable to the clumsy Prevedi for Gardelli and superior even to Domingo, slumming it in a bit part for Sinopoli. Luchetti is particularly admirable in the lovely trio \\"Io t'amava\\".<br /><br />The Ambrosian Chorus sounds a little lean in comparison with the Vienna State Opera Chorus or the Berliners but as ever they sing with verve and precision. The Philharmonia respond with alacrity to Muti's taut direction and the sound is excellent.<br /><br />I remain irritated by EMI's penny-pinching and inconvenient policy of putting the libretto on a third CD-ROM; I do not want to go to the trouble or expense of printing off my own and thus simply take a libretto from another set on my shelves - but not everyone has multiple editions of the less popular Verdi operas. One minor point: in this re-packaging (not a re-mastering, I think; this dates from 1986 but remains satisfactory), in the cast list EMI have managed to transpose the surnames of that estimable tenor Keith Collins and soprano Anne Edwards.a fearless, uninhibited twenty-two-year-old of formidable gifts and talent.

B0017APQ1K|4.0|\\"The Gangs of New York\\" is Director Martin Scorsee's epic on New York City's mid-1800's gangs.  The cinema and sets for the timeframe are amazing and Daniel Day-Lewis is perfect in his role as the Bill the Butcher.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio plays Amsterdam Vallon who is a son of a well respected gang leader.  He sees Bill the Butcher kill his father.  Amsterdam, now fully grown, wants to get revenge against the Butcher for his father's death. The movie shows how Amsterdam gradually works his way into Bill the Butcher's group and eventually earns his trust and respect.  Amsterdam also meets and has to deal with the beautiful Jenny Everdean (Cameron Diaz) during his quest.  It seems like this is more of a chore than love most of the time, although Jenny is a beauty.<br /><br />The cinematography and historical sets of New York were amazing.  The movie was good, but overall could have been smoother in connecting the scenes.  The chemistry between DiCaprio and Diaz was not there.  The Gangs of New York is a solid \\"good\\" - but could have been fantastic if the editing hadn't created a somewhat choppy story.

B003BKF696|5.0|\\"High Violet\\" is a dark, mysterious record.  It often sounds subdued, and it is rarely joyous...  yet it is not morose.  The reverberating tones speak in an overall way to inner demons and conflicts, but the percussive rhythms are a heartbeat full of life, the guitarwork and arrangements propel the story with satisfying detail, and the voice of Matt Berninger is the soul of a true musical mansion.      This is the music of long days spent examining half-lit corridors.  The pace changes incrementally as the recording moves along.  Softly picked and strummed guitars provide punctuation for the story at the onset, and become more forceful as things build, as the listener explores various side doors off of these hallways.  Here and there, surprises are uncovered and the pulse picks up dramatically.  So like many life journeys, the album is a journey of ups and downs, with more realizations and more uncovered richness as it goes along.  Some may claim this album lacks momentum, but this is not so.  \\"High Violet\\" has a very strong pulse.      \\"High Violet\\" may not pack the immediacy of \\"Alligator\\"; if it does, it does so in a more subtle way.  Intensity flows through every track.  From start to finish, this CD seems more stylistically consistent than \\"Alligator\\" or \\"Boxer\\".  While the record builds as it goes, Berninger's vocal range expands from his usual baritone into some upper register singing by the final tracks.  For fans of this group, there are many instant classics:  the dreamy \\"England\\", the moody \\"Terrible Love\\", the drama of \\"Runaway\\"...  every song has it's own qualities of greatness, and all are worthy of mention.       Everything about this album is solid.  It is a masterpiece.  The National is to be commended for such an exquisite creation.  It is a cohesive band, truly the sum of all its parts.  Fans should be very satisfied with \\"High Violet\\", and new listeners will find the album rewarding as well.  And 4AD Records is to be commended for adding The National to its stable of high-quality artists!      Don't walk, but run to your CD store and buy this one.  Then, settle in for a quiet time of contemplation, dreams,  and soulful exploration of Emotion's private places.  This record is remarkably easy to get caught up in, and for me, that is why, in time, I believe it may be considered a classic.
B0035J6TAI|5.0|As a longtime Peter Gabriel fan, I was slow to warm up to the idea of this type of release.  Not just for the sake of it being a \\"covers\\" album, but also because, as so many others would likely agree, part of what I love about Gabriel is his use of keyboards, guitars and drums, particularly the African-influenced sounds.  I caught sneak peaks via his podcasts released from his website, and didn't truly appreciate what I was hearing.  Then one day while out and about I saw the CD sitting on a shelf and decided to give it a buy.  I put it in my stereo, and I swear to you all, I haven't been the same since.    Every song on this record, although originally written and performed by other artists, is Peter's.  Bowie's \\"Heroes,\\" a monster in its own right, is breath-taking on this record.  Maybe one of the best songs I've ever listened to.  And the same can be said for all the tracks (although I have yet to fully warm up to the Radiohead tune).  Peter shows his voice is still strong.  In fact, I would say his voice hasn't sounded this powerful and pure since SO and even before.  His ability to quietly whisper a song and then erupt into the melody of a song like \\"Flume\\" or \\"Mirrorball\\" is just incredible.    To those looking for a radio hit, don't look here.  You won't dance to these songs, either, unless it's \\"Book of Love\\" being played as your wedding song.  What this record brings is music that allows the listener to look inside themselves, uncover the places in their lives that have been left untouched for years, and in the end, feel good.

0307454541|5.0|This in-depth crime novel could be enjoyed in a marathon reading session or in a slow paced manner.  The novel touches so many informational bases: state rules pertaining to custody, computer hard & software, law enforcement protocols. Crimminal bases: murder, rape and cover-up.  Psychological bases: depression, fear and revenge. I'm on page 451 and plan a final marathon reading session as LisBeth prepares to plan a rescue and solve the mystery. I'm liking the book very much and plan to order the other two novels in the series.

1595141979|5.0|This was the darkest, scariest, most intense of the books so far- and even with all the conflict, I'm pretty sure it's my fave. I have really enjoyed the way the characters have grown and learned from their mistakes. A lot of young adult books have the kids making the same mistakes over and over- it's nice that these ones are making new ones instead! I also love the growth of the relationship between Rose & Dimitri. It's hard when you are hoping that what you think is going to happen won't happen and you cringe as you turn every page that brings you closer to knowing, but that is what makes this book sooooo good.  This one is definitely my favorite. Do yourself a favor...READ THE SERIES!!    I was trying to wait to read this series until I had the 5th book, but I slipped up. I read the first book in about 4 hours, and couldn't stop til I finished the next 3. (Who needs sleep anyhow?)  What a great series!  It's interesting, engaging, & funny.  You connect so easily with the characters and their lives, these books are just wonderful!     I just read the 7 House of Night books, and these ones are so much better! The Vampire academy books are well written, dark without being too dark, filled with suspense & humor. They are scary- but not too much and have just enough romance- without being dirty. If you like vampire books, and need a light read, these are a great pick!
0060090367|2.0|I am in the midst of listening to this book (on CD) .  I find the emotions Clare experiences when her husband leaves her to be very realistic.  However, getting her body back  4 weeks after having her baby and finding a hot new lover in that amount of time seemed a bit unrealistic.  A huge problem I have with the book is her derogatory comments about Italians.  In the first few chapters, she's mentioned three times how emotional and quick to anger they are.  If we're dealing in stereotypes, how would Miss Keyes enjoy a book mentioning how drunk the Irish always are?  Of course, she probably wouldn't mind as the sisters in the book, including the main character,  appear to be alcoholics.  My parents never would have tolerated the rudeness the sisters show toward their parents. \\"Shut up, Dad\\" would have been the last words I ever uttered (and rightfully so).  Clare goes on and on about everything, and I find myself hitting the button for the next track very often.  Some of what she says is funny or insightful; some is just prattling.

0307346609|5.0|This is not a typical blood and gore book as many of this genre are. It is a compelling story. And at times is an uncomfortable read. The reason for this is that the book is a commentary on man and war.   The one thing I would like to see is a sequel. It seemed to end prematurely with way too many loose ends.  In the end the question remains.... Did the humans win? And if they did at what price.
B00275EGX8|1.0|This movie is utter garbage. Nothing about it is realistic, its overly stylized and slow as molasses. They didn't even deserve the measly 16m they made. Because it was such a bust in the box office, they've decided to sue their fans now. This is the last bigelow movie I will ever see.
B000050XEI|5.0|I love this album.  If you've heard other albums by Enya, you've heard this one.  The same thing you get every time, which I think is very nice.

B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I actually randomly bought this book in paperback a few years ago while on vacation, but I had to add it my eLibrary too.  After reading the first few chapters again, I remembered why I like Lee Child's Jack Reacher: The ride he takes you on is never smooth, never dull, and very entertaining.    If you've never read any of the Reacher books, they're a fantastic series.  In this book, we have have the pleasure of getting to know Jack, and trust me - it really is a pleasure.  He's a loner, a bit dark, a former military man, smart as a whip, and maybe a bit of a dirty boy.    Freshly back into civilian life, he tries to bum around the south in order to try to adjust to life outside - something he's never really experienced. Instead he quickly finds himself in the middle of a big conspiracy in a small town completely by accident, and the big wigs at the head of it want him to take the fall.  Boy, did they pick the wrong guy to mess with.    Lee Child delivers a great read with the first of the Reacher books.  Filled with twists and turns, subtle and dry wit, Child allows you to experience an adventure that you don't want to end.  All the characters are realistic, while the story at times seems insane, it remains entirely believable given the circumstances.  The craziness of it all makes it much more fun!    If you want a good action/mystery read, pick this one up.  You won't regret it.

B001IAOEXU|3.0|I tried these out on a recommendation of a Gamestop employee who said \\"I don't game without them\\". I was pretty excited as I have always thought the current PS3 controller design for R2/L2 should have been trigger style like the Xbox 360. Snapping them on was simple enough and didn't take too long to try a few games out with them. I tried a First-person shooter (Resistance 2), driving game (Gran Turismo Prologue), and a flight/third person shooter (Warhawk). I have to say that it was slightly more difficult to reach your fingers around the trigger as it sits on top of the original button making it a bit further away from your fingers. Secondly, because of the way I hold the controller, my middle fingers or fore fingers rest directly below the R2/L2 buttons and if I wasn't careful, depressing the triggers would pinch the skin on my finger. It was VERY irritating as I would be focused on playing the game, but subconciously I would be worried of pinching everytime. After about a couple days worth of playing, I decided to take them off. For some, the triggers will be just the right fix for the current triggers for the PS3 controller, but for me, I can do without them.
0810988232|5.0|Ever since 1981, I have always believed in the faeries and their unseen world after reading Brian Froud's original Faeries. This oracle brings me full circle to the real \\"magic kingdom\\". This deck lets one experience a reading from faerieland. The art is stunning! The backs are strong offering reversals if preferred.<br /><br />The organization of the deck is not based on tarot. Its quite original, with a few wild cards thrown in for you, the reader to deal with. The deck is playful and welcoming. The meanings are for you to interpret. If you need a solid reference, there is the handy hardcover book, carefully written by Wendy Froud. Each card get the rational meaning for those who need it. She handles it skillfully, without giving credit to the otherwordly inspirations. Yes, some of the meanings are harsh. The faeries arent always kind and gentle, often times mischievious and troublesome. I like her writing and have little doubt that a good reader would have a problem with the set.<br /><br />It works for beginners, simply for the fact that anyone using this deck is beginning, myself included. I love learning this new system, which challenges and teaches me about someplace I have never considered before-my own heart, where the faeries have always lived!
B00393R1ZC|3.0|I received my Daria DVD today and I was excited to finally get it. I read the little paper inside the set which explained why the music is gone.  99% of the music is gone, what a big let down!  I really loved the music as it was a huge part of the show.  I'm happy that I can now watch Daria but it's so incomplete with out the music that fit the theme of each scene.  I'm hoping that eventually they will be able to release the DVD in its original format.  But for now this will do.    I had never seen the first episode of the series and today I was able to.  Which finally killed my curiosity.  I've been watching each episode all afternoon and most of the evening, but I can't get over that the music is gone.
B001RTP48G|5.0|PSB have always been on my favorite band list. Yes seals the deal as the greatest band of my time. It has 11 catchy tunes that happily are stuck in my head. In this age of internet downloads, I am sure glad to have a hard copy of this valuable collection of pop songs. The Way It Used To Be reflects the sad state of affairs in the music industry which reflected our society for over 50 years in the English speaking world. Fashion, hair styles, posters and most of all the music on the radio or MTV all added to our culture. They are the last of thier kind-the classic pop band-which has become an endangered species.     Yes contains hope that our pop culture isnt over. It sold a lot of copies-mostly in The UK, Europe and Asia. PSB are now a one hit wonder in the USA. In club and dance circles they thrive. Internationally, they thrive. This record should have been the awarded a Grammy for best album! It was ignored. No American artist can hold a candle to PSB.     The entire record is epic in scale! More Than A Dream contains more hope than they have ever recorded. Pandemonium pulses powereful dance beats. Legacy reveals more about our current society than we care to notice. Socially, Yes is still relevant. The politics are toned down. These tunes seem to be written for the fans. I relate entirely. Oh Yes, the dance mixes on the bonus disc are Absolutely Fabulous!!!
B00280LYIC|4.0|I had been putting of this series for awhile now.  Although I normally love YA, I just thought this one would be more along the lines of a children's book and wouldn't keep my attention.  And, I was wrong (and someone better record this, because I don't say it often...hehe).  This was a very engaging read from the beginning to the end.<br /><br />I really love reading about Greek mythology and this book really went in depth with it, there were several times that I wrote down names just so I could look them up later, made me feel NOT smarter than a 5th grader!!  Percy is a great charcter, he's a scared kid who still stands up for what he believes is right, even when it would have been alot safer for him to run away.  Percy meets some great characters along the way, some destined to be his friends, some destined to be his enemies.  And sometimes the ones he thinks are friends don't turn out that way.<br /><br />It's a perilous world that Percy finds himself thrown into, and I was glad to go along for the ride with him.  I dug through this book at lightning speed and I'm really excited to read the rest and see what trouble Percy and the crew find their way into next time!
0307473465|4.0|'The Reader' is about a teenager who falls in love, and has a sexual relationship with an older woman.  After the affair he discovers that in a prior life she worked for The Third Reich and was involved with something bad, very bad.  In the end the past comes back to haunt the woman, and the teenager is haunted by memories of the woman through his adulthood.  No happy endings here.    Although the story is rather simple, it is written as a memoir by the young man, I think the author makes it work by the genuine emotion projected by the two main characters.  The two characters aren't very likable but I was very empathetic to their plight.  Yet at times I felt the author didn't dive into details as well as he should have; it was if I was reading the Reader's Digest version of a fuller novel.      Bottom line: a depressingly realistic story of doomed lives.  Recommended.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|She's clearly saying freak b**ch where she's supposed to.  And, this superstar has earned a new fan.  I didn't even know who she was two weeks ago (I fall behind so easily) and I now find out she's been the most successful artist in the world for the last two years.  And, I can see why.  She doesn't create bad songs...another factor in having earned my fandom.  I don't care what style of music someone plays or makes.  If it's great I'll listen, and buy.  I will neither pay nor download crap from anyone.  Most pop stars cannot make three songs that are good on any given album, let alone 8 or 10.  She hasn't hit a low point with me with any of her songs.  They are ALL gold.    She's got some of the most aggressive pop music I've ever heard, both in lyrical content and in the sheer force of what's coming off those instruments.  From what I understand she's also playing most of the songs herself as well has having written them.  She's stepped into a new world now and I think she'll be around for a long time.  If she will take care of herself she could end up as big as the Beatles, Elvis, and Michael Jackson were.  Based on what I've heard so far there's no doubt she's got talent to match them.  There are elements of all sorts of musical forms in her stuff.  I even hear some shades of Led Zeppelin in her stuff.  And, from this double album I've learned that she is very diverse.  How she expands her work in the future will be interesting to observe.  She's a bit on the strange side, but she plays up the glam b**chy role very well and with attitude not seen since the early years of Madonna.  She's hot on the charts for good reason.  She's breaking records left and right.  Perhaps she will be able to generate album sales like once happened before the internet took off.    I love this album double and consider it now one of my most prized CDs in the collection.  I'm sold.  She's great.  She's one of those who you'll never understand but always breathlessly await.  I've played her music constantly for the last several days.  I am mesmerized.  Very few artists ever do that to me, especially now that I'm on the backside of my life time.    There's not a bad song on either of the records in this double, and I've seen that she's already planning a 3rd.  Get in line behind me because I'm buying when it hits.      I'd just like to hear her do one metal song.  Just one.          Also, I'd like to add here as an edit that \\"Teeth\\" is the finest pop song I've ever heard.      It's better than \\"Billie Jean.\\"  It's better than \\"Hey Jude.\\"  It's the best, period.
B002CJ5YQW|5.0|I love Liam Neeson, he did a good job on this movie. Very tight psychological thriller.
076780421X|5.0|la primera vez la vi en la TV, pero definitivamente es una de esas peliculas que tienes que teenr para verla cuando quieras.
B00005EAXF|5.0|This is a great album, really shows how talented the band is. Good song selection, some more obscure that I don't remember hearing on the mainstream media. A couple of covers I think they did as well on as the original groups. Recorded in Portugal 2001.  Acoustic flying V and Explorer who else would have thought of that.
B0025UHKNS|5.0|After using a Polar RS100 and switching for the Forerunner 405 cx I have just one opinion:<br /><br />Awesome watch!
0375826726|5.0|As always this series is just incredibly awesome. This book doesn't disappoint with lots of adventure and fun. It's great to see such a young author's writing style develop and mature - this book is an amalgamation of all that he's learned from the first three. Extremely professional and a great story line :o)
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|I was just about done with T.V. altogether. Between the reality show snooze-fests and the usual cut-and-paste sitcoms & dramas, I was about to resign myself to just watching DVDs. And then along comes Sons of Anarchy. Season One captivated me, and Season Two drove it home. If you are any kind of intrigued with the biker lifestyle, you have got to see this series.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|As always amazing - anything with David Attenborough is worth buying - he doesn't go in on boring, uninformed projects - this is just as always professional, interesting and just awe-inspiring. You just get so absorbed and learning as you go. Just incredible. If you love everything else he's done, get this now! :o)
B00275EGWY|1.0|Just an overall horrible film. Even though many of my friends claimed that it was extremely realistic, I found it to be very \\"hollywood\\" in nature. DON'T BUY IT.
B00328G4V6|2.0|I am totally lost here.  I do not believe for one minute that Jimi Hendrix would have released this half-baked recording.  He was of the finest and most professional guitarists/musicians of the 20th century.  This does nothing to advance his legacy.  I am in love with Jimi Hendrix the guitarist/singer/songwriter and the recordings he issued while he was alive.  This is second rate material and I do not think he would have approved of its release.  I apologize to completists (I'm one too), but don't call this new and groundbreaking.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|Love it, love it, love it.  What more is there to say.  Some of Muse's greatest titles.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|Good Movie, kind of different than I thought or was use to with this character. But still good.. well worth watching again.
B003405MF6|5.0|simply stated, this is a beautiful, musical album.  beck continues with grace and taste.
B000007ODL|5.0|Loved the cd, bought it for one song and got a full cd that I enjoy.
B001I82RU4|2.0|I bought the record for \\"Bella's Lullabye\\"...it's the only song I like on the whole album and I've listened to it several times to try to develop a taste for it...I guess I'm just not goth enough for it.
0785134352|5.0|Never heard of Kick Ass before the movie and I thought the trailer looked great.  I searched out the history and saw this collection of the comics and gave it a read.  I was amazed.  Sure it's raw and violent, but it is also fun, entertaining and refreshing.  John Romita Jr's art has never been better.  It really brought the story to life and what a great story it is.  I have still not seen the movie and am afraid that it can not possibly live up to how great this book is.  It took me back to when I used to run around the back yard with a towel wrapped around my neck pretending to be a super hero.  I dreamed of doing what Kick Ass did in this book, but wasn't stupid enough or brave enough to actually do it.  I saw one of the twists coming a mile away, but there was another one that I didn't expect.  Each issue just kept getting better and the ending makes me impatient to see how the story continues.  If you aren't offended by language, violence and a little nudity then pick up this series and see just how much fun comics can be.
B003BKF696|5.0|What an absolutely beautiful album this is. I first came across The National last year on the compilation album [[ASIN:B001KVW574 Dark Was the Night]] where they contributed the lovely \\"So far around the bend\\".  Lead singer Matt Berninger's doleful baritone perfectly suits these soothing songs comprising jangly guitars, tinkling pianos, warbling hypnotic effects, orchestral embellishments, and a retro feel.<br /><br />Opening is the fuzzy Folk of \\"Terrible love\\". \\"Anyone's ghost\\" is an absolutely brilliant Rockabilly-inflected song Chris Isaak would kill for. The chiming \\"Little faith\\" is a delicate thing with lightly military beats, while lead-off single \\"Bloodbuzz Ohio\\" is upbeat and still manages to be beautifully gloomy.<br /><br />Everything is brilliant really, but the ballads really stand out; \\"Afraid of everyone\\" (with ghostly harmonies and ending on a nervy note), the acoustic string-swathed \\"Runaway\\" (with Berninger crooning \\"We don't bleed when we don't fight / Go ahead, go ahead / Throw your arms in the air tonight\\"), the spectacular \\"Conversation 16\\" (creepy sounding with reverbing/haunting effects, my absolute favourite), to the gentle piano-driven \\"England\\" (which builds to a euphoric climax).<br /><br />They remind me of so many of my favourite acts; Editors, Interpol, Arcade Fire, and even Morrissey. Definitely one of the best albums of the year, which should see them getting even bigger than they are now.
0446698342|5.0|This was a bit lengthy but worth every minute of it!  I really liked it!  It kept me interested and I was constantly thinking of returning to the book to read more of it!  It was inspirational.  It was full of warmth and Love with a bit of excitement (edge of your seat kind) here and there!  I really enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone who likes Nicholas Sparks.  If you haven't read his books, this is a good one to read!
B0038Z5SEW|4.0|When It was announced that Anthony Hopkins would appear in an action thriller written by David Mamet with support from Alec Baldwin (Glengarry Glen Ross)--I looked forward to a brilliant effort--and I wasn't disappointed at all.  Mamet has fashioned a \\"Deliverance\\" type thriller but with a twist in that it's about how two men survive in the wilderness and then how they survive each other.  Hopkins finds his niche in Mamet's language and of course, Baldwin, who was already brilliant in Mamet's \\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\" matches him in artistry and wit.  In it's own way, \\"The Edge\\" is more of a theatrical piece/play than the 1972 classic with Jon Voight and Burt Reynolds, but it's still very good thanks to the two leads and fine direction by Lee Tamohori (We Were Warriors;Along Came A Spider).  Hopkins in fact later saw it on video and proclaimed to be a pretty good little action flick--I doubt that you'll be disappointed at all. The Blu-ray version is several notches better than the standard DVD, particularly in the colors and the definitions of the Canadian Rockies where this was shot.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Legend of the Seeker is an amazing show!! I've read all of Terry Goodkinds books, including Law of Nines, and I have to say they really have stayed true to the characters of Richard, Kahlan, & Zedd!! Because of the mature themes in Goodkinds books, Legend of the Seeker has masterfully spun the tale of the Sword of Truth by making it viewable for all ages! The forbidden love is so beautifully portrayed by Bridget Regan & Craig Horner, Kahlan & Richard respectively. They bring to life the characters Goodkind created, adding so much more to characters I know & love. With NZ as its backdrop, the scenery couldn't get more amazing & the special effects are second to none. On top of that, the musical score won an Emmy! What's not to love? If you're looking for something your entire family can enjoy, this DVD collection will be perfect!! My nephews love it & visit me just to watch Legend of the Seeker.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|I will focus most of my review on the double DVD in question. As to the film itself, I can only endorse everything said by the other reviewers, I defy anyone not to like this movie - most will love it. Just one thing, Joan Leslie deserves a special mention. As a 16-year old actress playing a 16-year old Gracie she is wonderful. Cooper was just about as big they could get when this movie was made but Leslie plays her scenes with not a trace of diffidence or self-consciousness. Black and white has many strengths, not the least of which is that it minimises the effect of studio sets. None of this movie is filmed on location, but it doesn't matter. In many ways it simply emphasises the quality of the performances. Contrast this with, for example, the wonderful Anthony Mann location work in his James Stewart westerns - for me the scenery is almost too good and diminishes the story-telling. The transfer to DVD of this movie is good, if not exceptional. It would benefit from the loving care given to the Basil Rathbone Sherlock Holmes series by the UCLA labs, for example.     So, the movie is great, what about the extras? On disk one, in addition to the main feature, there is a commentary, a couple of contemporary cartoons, and some galleries of stills. I don't like cartoons, or find stills interesting, so the commentary is all that is left. I went to sleep watching it, and switched off less than halfway through! Good commentary adds to what you see on the screen, with insightful extra information about the characters or the making of the movie. I'm afraid this, by and large, simply tells you what you are seeing. It was with some considerable feeling of anti-climax, therefore, that I inserted the second DVD. It's great! There is a feature on the making of Sergeant York that is very interesting, stimulating, and worth paying for in itself. The insights into the political background to the movie are of particular merit. This is followed by a retrospective on Cooper's career fronted by - Clint Eastwood! I must admit I was surprised at the choice of presenter; Eastwood's westerns tend to be brutal and cynical - everything that Sergeant York, and Cooper, are not. I needn't have worried, I'd forgotten that few know as much about the movie business as Clint. Remember his reaction when once asked why Oscars seemed to be eluding Spielberg? \\"Well, perhaps Stephen is just too successful for some people in this business\\". Clint puts across the material he is given on Cooper with similar honesty and affection. Another very welcome addition to this set. I will never regret buying it - nor will you.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|The CD for Soldier of Love is by far, yet another of Sade's finest moments.  As deep and sensitive as her thoughts go, this music yearns and stays with you.  I find myself humming or harmonizing as I work through my day.  I am captivated and moved by \\"The Safest Place\\", a magnificent work of genius, for anyone who has ever felt the emotion of love.  It reminded me of a dream that I once had, of love lost and preserved in my heart. \\"Soldier of Love\\" grabs your soul and beckons a call for Love, waiting, and watching...until you find someone new.  It's all a journey that transpires into a tug-of-war with your emotions of love and trying to understand the reasons why we fail or succeed.  I was completely intrigued and moved.
0747572593|5.0|The rich writing conveys the desert setting, powerful love affair and intriguing adventures of five main characters.  It keeps readers on their toes as it jumps from past to present, one character's point of view to another's  but is well worth the effort required .  Themes and nuances are many.  The book is worthy of a dissertation topic.    Reading the book and then seeing the film make a very fascinating duo.  Surprisingly, each is strong in its own way.
1400063515|5.0|The life lesson at the heart of Mr. Taleb's book is that black swans are unforeseeable, and even rare. But, they are more common than we usually account for. When they do appear, they can have a drastic effect, heightened by the very fact they are unexpected.     The new 75 page essay added to the original book is dense with difficult ideas.  But, it is worth the effort to read it carefully, and roll each idea around in your mind as you go.  Striking is Mr. Taleb's reference to the value of old teachers, because they know things that are not readily explainable as rules that you can catalog, but nevertheless are valuable, because they are robust to unexpected perturbations.  These things that old people know are transmitted as faith, religion, or dogmas - but they work, and have worked.    Examples could include the idea of \\"thrift\\", or \\"prudence\\".  These values are not readily written as rules to be followed.  What is, after all, \\"prudence\\"? But, prudence would very likely have made our financial system robust to perturbations. Like, say, an unexpected fall in home prices.     What was missing in 2008 in America was robustness of the financial system to unforeseen perturbations.  A forecast was made:  home prices would never go down.  A huge edifice of debt was built upon this forecast.  The forecast was wrong.  The financial system had made no provision for this (like, being prudent, or thrifty).  So, the debt castle crumbled.    Other reviewers here feel that Mr. Taleb's naming of names of some of the villains made them uncomfortable.  Not this writer.  Rubin, Bernanke, Greenspan, Geitner, Larry Summers, and others, are all big boys, very able to defend themselves, if they can.  It is refreshing to have someone publicly identify the most prominent and powerful financial figures in the country as the banksters they really are. American capitalism has been broken, possibly forever, by capitalists.        In this light, this is an extraordinary book, whatever its literary merits.  Always, always, consider what would happen under unlikely outcomes when making critical decisions.  Unfortunately, public policy systematically favors fragility.  Politicians live under the bell curve.  We may yet all die under the bell curve.
B000VEA30W|5.0|I know I'm really late to the party but I'm finally an Avenged Sevenfold fan. I started with this CD and I'm working my way back. M. Shadows voice took a while to grow on me but now I can't get enough of this band.
B001SS3JS8|5.0|Another great novel by Picoult, who isn't afraid to tackle the tough \\"let's not talk about it\\" issues.  I did not find even one paragraph of this book to be superfluous.  Here are two contemporary families we learn to care about from the very first chapters.  Know that these people will touch you and stay with you long after you finish the last page.  She develops her characters so well...relationships between the spouses, adult friends, siblings, and teen \\"soul mates\\" evolve through her mastery of storytelling.   The author does not offer all the answers but lets us share a journey of incredible pain and heartbreak.
1440469563|5.0|I'm not going to review this novel because it seems I would not even know where to begin.  Instead I am going to review the audio download which is what I had this time.  I enjoy listening to books while I clean, it is my way of getting myself to stay busy.  I have been known to spend several days with my nose stuck in books having done absolutely nothing throughout the day.  Now that I have started downloading audio books to my iPod, I can wear my armband and get tons of things done around the house and go for long walks while having my favorite stories read to me.  The best of both worlds!  Sense and Sensibility is performed by Juliet Stevenson and she does a wonderful job.  Her voice  gets a little 'nasal-y' (I'm sure that's not a real word.. lol) and stuffy sounding at times, but I'm not sure if she does that on purpose to suit the characters.  It was a little distracting and annoying, but most of her reading was pleasant.  I would recommend it to any Austen fan that wants to listen to wonderful stories while being productive.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Finally bought and read it after seeing it in the top 10 kindle list for so long. Took a few chapters to get into, but once it started picking up, i couldn't put the iPad with Kindle app loaded  down (sorry my own twisted humor insert). Well worth the $5.99. I'm going to download the next one now.
B00000IQW5|5.0|Nice story, adapted from an earlier film, plus a great cast makes this a good, old-fashioned, enjoyable movie.     Richard Dreyfuss and Holly Hunter are wonderful as the couple whose love is the subject of this story.  The chemistry is terrific; the scene where she dances with him in her white dress, after he returns to visit her after his death is amazing.  John Goodman is solid in his important supporting role.  I've read little mention of Brad Johnson, as the handsome guy who replaces Dreyfuss in Hunter's life.  I thought he was true heart-throb material and wonder whatever happened to him.  It was delightful to see the lovely Audrey Hepburn playing an angel, a perfect role for her.    Not a modern, cynical view of life which is unfortunately popular among cineasts today, but if you don't mind being unfashionable and just want pure, heart-felt enjoyment, then you'll love this film.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|Wonderful, I would recommend this to anyone, real family values and shows a true picture of how our goverment tried to eliminate the native americans, not unlike what Hitler tried to do with the Jewish people.  My children and I watched this show every week together and now my 17 year old (this was her graduation present) are watching this every night since we recevied it, we do not watch regular TV to much anymore.  In addition Joe Lando is very sexy and shows how a man should treat a woman and how to show love.  How the man takes care of his family and true family values.    Love the show
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Excellent book. A great story of fatherhood, love, gearhead/racing, friendships and persevering from a dog's point of view.
B0025KW29U|5.0|One of those DVD's you have to almost force people to watch, then they don't give it back.  Fillion, Day and Harris are simply wonderful.  Quirky, odd, amusing, wonderful music.  The \\"making of\\" is certainly worth owning the DVD for.  Now I understand how they \\"do it\\".  Weadon's team is amazing.      There's a sequel out there, will donate a kidney to see it..    Good for teenagers, nothing in this to offend anyone with intelligence.  Besides taking over the world, death rays and unrequieted love.
1439148953|4.0|I really enjoyed sitting back and relaxing with Brooklyn!  I spent the entire weekend completely immersed in Ireland and Brooklyn.  I was absorbed in the transformation of a young girl who grew into a noble woman.
B002FGU3YA|5.0|Though I cringed at paying so much for sandals, after getting a different brand last year that didn't make it through the summer, I thought I'd give these a try. I have had them for about 2 months now and have only worn them a few times. However, I have found them to be extremeley comfortable. The built in support and the cushioning is great. I have also found that they stay on my feet when walking on side hills as well as up and down. I would definately get these again assuming that they last like I expect them to.
B001I5M9SC|4.0|I was not familiar with Andrea Bocelli when I purchased this disk. I certainly did not know that he is blind. I was blown away by his talent. The performers he chose to accompany him, matched and complemented his talent exceedingly well. His brief introductions between tracks were not at all \\"excessive\\". I watched some of the performances over and over (particularly those with Sarah Brightman). Musically, I found all of them flawless, and my young children were equally captivated and impressed.    I was primarily looking for a pristine Blu-ray audio/video experience, though, and I felt that it fell a little short here and there. The image quality is fantastic, with full HD resolution, great dynamic range, no distracting noise (even in the darkest of scenes), and no compression artifacts. But the image is frequently slightly out of focus. Most of the cameras seem to wander in and out of razor-sharp focus as they move, and when they come to rest, they may or may not be in perfect focus. Nobody else noticed this, nor were they concerned about it when I pointed it out. The 5.1 PCM audio track sounds really good, with fantastic dynamic and tonal range, and no A/V sync problems. The soundstage is immersive, and faithful to a live concert experience. Since the concert was held outdoors, I expected none of the reverb typical in a concert hall, but a very minor reverb still exists due to the amplification at the venue (or perhaps it was added intentionally). This does not distract, and may even enhance the sound. However, I recoiled at the unnatural sound of the audience applause (thankfully not too frequent). It sounds as though it was recorded in a pipe for better microphone directionality.    Nevertheless, the faults are highly insignificant, and this is one disk I will continue to play again and again. I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone with an appreciation for top quality music and performances.
B00004VXF2|5.0|Unless you are (a) seriously into avant-garde and industrial music, (b) an obsessive collector of all things Lou Reed, and/or (c) an obsessive collector of  German RCA imports, do not buy this album. It is not for you. I can almost guarantee that 75-80% of everyone on Earth who hears this album will hate it. Metal Machine Music is, among many other things, long, loud, complex, unsettling, bizarre, and advanced. By \\"advanced\\" I mean that perhaps some day in a postmodern future this kind of music will be standard fare on FM radio. But at this stage in human evolution, you either \\"get\\" or \\"don't get\\" Metal Machine Music. I get it. The full disturbing hour plays out like some kind of drug-inspired classical madness; snatches of riffs and melodies pop up here and there, but for the most part it all kind of blurs together into an imposing sonic wall of pure terror. But if that's not your thing, then don't waste your time or money. You'd probably be better off not knowing what a stoned misanthrope with two guitars, a leather jacket, and a contractual obligation is capable of.
006621131X|5.0|Dear Reader,<br /><br />I've always adored both Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe's works, all of them, all the time.  Even though I'm positive, well, of course from reading the book, I know that they, themselves didn't always like all of their works.  Well, I certainly did and still do.<br /><br />But the most fantastic thing that I found in this book is that even though we lived in different cities, it seemed to me, when I was reading her account of their life back then, that I had lived somewhat of a parallel life to theirs.<br /><br />This is one of those great books that puts you at exactly where, when, and the how of it all happening.  The zeitgeist, so to speak.<br /><br />I'm thrilled that she wrote this book!  I can only hope that she will write even more books.  But, if that's not to be, then I was blessed to have read this one.<br /><br />So, thank you Ms. Patti Smith for taking me back down memory lane.  I totally enjoyed every single word of it.<br /><br />Best Wishes,<br /><br />Susan
B0000033WC|5.0|Andy Warhol's musical proteges came a long way from their 1967 debut with German chanteuse Nico to 1970's Loaded. In sharp contrast to the group's more punchy, near-punk efforts, Loaded is an instantly likable masterwork of quasi-psychedelic art pop tunes that would not be out of place on a \\"golden oldies\\" radio station, yet somehow bear the distinguished stamp of Lou Reed's songwriting genius throughout. Eschewing confrontational themes such as drug abuse and S&M-related subject matter to deal with the more topical subjects of love, depression, and frustration with oneself, Reed manages to bring fresh life to such pop-rock cliches with his innovative arrangements and unconventional song structures; few songs follow the basic \\"verse-chorus-verse-bridge-chorus\\" format so common to the genre, most consist instead of intricately interwoven melodies and uplifting hooks interspersed throughout, so everyone will find something new with each repeated listen. The closest Reed comes to his more challenging repertoire is \\"New Age,\\" a sparse ballad in which the fan of an aging actress laments the loss of her glamor. From the Beatles-esque \\"Who Loves the Sun,\\" to the vaguely trippy \\"Cool It Down,\\" to the bluesy wailer \\"Train Round the Bend,\\" each and every song on Loaded is a gem of experimental Baroque sensibilities. Highlights of the bonus material include a Dylan-ish reworking of the sunshine pop waltz \\"I Found A Reason\\" and Maureen Tucker's innocent serenade \\"I'm Sticking With You,\\" which fans of the movie Juno will recognize from the film's soundtrack.
1853260339|5.0|Everybody knows him -- the pipe-smoking detective on Baker Street (with or without the movie-added deerstalker), who is able to deduce all sorts of things just by glancing at a person. \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\" shows off Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's first collection of short stories involving Holmes, mingling human psychology with sometimes bizarre mysteries.<br /><br />Holmes is visited by the masked King of Bohemia, who has a slight problem: he's engaged to a princess, but his former lover Irene Adler has a compromising letter that could jeopardize his future marriage. But Adler has a formidable brain of her own. Then Holmes is hired by a man who was hired by the mysterious Red-Headed League, and given a strange job... which is somehow connected to a criminal undertaking.<br /><br />Among the other strange cases that Holmes and Watson undertake -- a missing fiance, a strange murder in Boscombe Valley, a dead man who was sent five orange seeds, a woman whose husband has utterly vanished, a blue jewel hidden in a Christmas turkey, a dead woman whose last words were \\"it was the band, the speckled band!\\", a young engineer given a dream job, an American heiress who vanishes directly after her wedding, a broken beryl coronet, and a young woman given a surreally weird job.<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes mysteries come in two types:<br />1. The case is completely baffling, and Holmes is needed to unravel the knot of obscure clues.<br />2. The case seems straightforward, but Holmes is needed to connect seemingly unrelated clues to the crime in order to find the REAL perpetrator.<br /><br />There are plenty of both kinds in \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,\\" with a dozen cases that require Holmes' unique detecting skills -- it can be something as simple as locating a letter, or something as complex as foiling a robbery or counterfeiting ring. Doyle's stately, dignified prose is heightened by moments of excitement or horror (\\" It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek\\"), and he wove in a lot of human psychology into Holmes' cases.<br /><br />Holmes himself... is Holmes. Doyle didn't like his detective much, but Sherlock's knife-edged intellect and fascination with puzzles are strangely hypnotic -- even if you wouldn't like to be roomies with the guy, it would be amazing just to sit and watch him work. Watson is the perfect counterpoint for Holmes: he's not a genius but is definitely intelligent, warm-hearted and capable.<br /><br />\\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\" is a magnificent collection of Holmes' first twelve short cases, filled with murder, intrigue and all sorts of weird crimes.

0385333846|3.0|I thought this book was maybe a tad over-rated, perhaps because I just read catch-22 and this was supposed to be in the same vein.  It's a bit disjointed (by design) but once you get used to that, it's not too difficult to get used to the shifts in time and place.  There are some funny lines here and there, and a few insights into the lunacy of war, particulary the bombing of dresden, but overall i would not say the book profoundly moved me.  I don't doubt Vonnegut's talent and you can see flashes of genius, but i still was left underwhelmed by the totality of the book.  I kept waiting for more.  If you want great dark humor centered around ww2, with cutting insights regarding society - then i'd go back to catch-22.  I'm willing to try another Vonnegut book - but this one leaves me a bit let down.
0156013983|2.0|I love the fantasy and the art work that is in this book.  What bothers me is that  this \\"children's\\" book uses suicide as an answer to the main character's problem.  I can't help but wonder what negative connotations this sends a child before they reach the turbulent teen years.
B0026P3G12|4.0|I liked almost every song on this cd. She has an amazing voice. Thought it was odd they put two spiritual songs and a Christmas song on the cd, but they are done so well I didn't mind. I downloaded the cd on my ipod so I just put the Christmas song in that playlist.
B002ZRPQ5K|5.0|I'm a little shocked by all these negative reviews. Yes, the Keane of 2010 sounds a bit different from the Keane of 2005. But that is not a bad thing! In fact, I think it show that they are not afraid to change it up and take some risks. Who wants to listen to 4 albums that all sound exactly the same? Keane are artists, and they prove it with each album they make. I love every song on this EP - I love the collaborations with K'naan (love his almost haunting singing voice), love that Tim sang on one, love that they are showing everyone that they have more than one sound. Artists should be allowed to grow and change. Thank you Keane, for daring to experiment. This one worked wonderfully. Can't wait to see you in Boston in August!
B0039OGGVQ|5.0|I was initially put off by this new release because of some not so great reviews.  A friend of mine suggested it though and I'm glad he did.  I usually critical when it come to retro metal.  You never know when the \\"old guys\\" are going to make a good release.  I listened to this all the way through and I like it alot!  It is diverse and creative. Probably one of Slash's best work.  Go Slash!
B001OQCV2O|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It kept me on the edge of my seat most of the time.  I watched it a 2nd time the next day and probably will watch it again.  Action & special effects were fantastic!  Great acting too!
B000002UAU|5.0|Not a lot to say here.  If you like the Beatles, then you will love this CD!  If you aren't familiar with the Beatles, then this is a good album to start with. It is well worth the price of an actual CD to get Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
B0035J6TAI|5.0|This is the best cover album I have ever heard. Scratch My Back highlights Gabriel's producing and interpretive skills which are as good as they get. The  music is orchestral which  gives life to the amazing vocals, on a decent sound system the music comes alive. Bowie's Heroes is an interesting entree followed by Paul Simon's work and Bon Iver's Flume. Peter's daughter is friends with Bon Iver which lead to the magic happening on this piece. Bon Iver has been very complimentary to the direction and creativity Gabriel's version has taken, as it is a radical departure from the original.   Play Lou Reed's Power of the Heart for someone you love, it will make the hair on the back of their neck stand up.  I have been a fan of Gabriel since Genisis hay-day in the early 70's marked by such albums as Selling England by the Pound. After Gabriel left the band it took a distinctive commercial direction which was not my taste. If your looking for rock n roll this album is not for you, but:  If you have appreciated Gabriel's artistry over the years you may fall in love with \\"Scratch My Back\\" as it is epic in vocal presentation,  creative use of the original songs, and its stunning use of orchestral music. In a word Amazing!
B001RPD06I|5.0|I bought this card to expand the storage on my Sansa Clip+ mp3 player.  Class 2 is not a factor when playing music files, although it did take about an hour and a half to load 16G worth of mp3 files on board.   No biggie, since I only have to do it once.         Overall, I'm happy with it.  It turned my 8G music player into a 24G music player instantly. Well worth the price.       For the guy that bought the phony card, that's getting pretty common on the 'net these days.  I specifically paid a few bucks more and ordered direct from Amazon to avoid just that scenario.  Independent sellers seem to be the most common source of phonies.
0307266303|5.0|Great book.  It arrived in perfect condition & just in time for my husband's birthday.
1400031001|5.0|Following a character through his or her life can be very absorbing. That is what this novel, written in the form of an \\"intimate journal,\\" does and it includes most of the major events of the 20th century. It is fiction skillfully interwoven with history.<br /><br />Any Human Heart tells the story of Logan Mountstuart through his diaries, and his experiences. Born male, rich, good looking and arrogant at the beginning of the century, he dies a modest, kinder and wiser man. Logan's life might seem preposterous but it is certainly engaging.
031606792X|1.0|The first two editorial reviews on this page hit the nail on the head.  I felt none of the previous emotional connection I'd built up to any of the characters because they were so OOC.  The most emotionally stirring part of the book, Bella's pregnancy, loses its effectiveness due to the switching of POV from Bella to Jacob.  The final section of the book is overcrowded with unremarkable, extraneous characters and the lack of action is very disappointing.
B003ELKNOK|1.0|...This reissue is idiot, They want sale, make money with new pictures and 3 miserables live tracks. Is really a decption this reissue, i and almost all BJ fans wanted \\"Borderline\\" as bonus track, and others rarities of period, not 3 live tracks...! 1 star! Not exist 0 star as option unfortunatelly!
0723257639|5.0|I ordered this as a christening gift for my nephew on Monday 10/05 and it arrived in Sydney Australia on 14/05 as per the guaranteed delivery date (the christening date is 16/05 so i was counting on the item arriving on this date).      I was worried that the box may be damaged in transit but it was packaged so well that the box is in amazing condition.  This is my first experience using Amazon and will definately use them again. Really happy with my purchase and service - this set makes a wonderful gift for a child and my hope is that my nephew will treasure it for a very long time.
0060558121|2.0|I just finished American Gods. I've read that along with his novel Neverwhere and some of his graphic novel series, Sandman. I am prepared to say I don't see why he's such a big deal.  I found American Gods to be self-indulgent and mostly just plain boring.
0743454537|1.0|The last 25 pages or so. This was my first Picoult reading experience and I hesitate to take on another after finishing this. The subject matter was interesting and the writing was above average, if not needlessly wordy.<br /><br />The ending, however, was ridiculous, medically unbelievable, and probably an attempt to shock the reader. Way too much irony for me.<br /><br />I disliked every character except Anna. I rarely say this but,,,,the movie was far better.
B001FBIPF0|5.0|I've only recently gotten into Fall Out Boy, and it's all thanks to this album.    Folie à Deux is superb- each track is catchy and thought-provoking.     I've gone back and gotten FOB's entire discography starting with \\"To Your Grave\\", and I would have to say each album since then is better than the one before. This album is surely Fall Out Boy's masterpiece.    At the risk of offending FOB fans, I would have to say the reason I enjoy this album so much is it has a very Panic! At The Disco feel to it. I prefer P!ATD, but I enjoy this album equally as much as any of the music by that band. I can't quite put my finger on where the Panic! feel stems from exactly (outside of Brendon Urie -singer for P!ATD- lending his vocals on \\"20 Dollar Nose Bleed\\"), but I'm sure anyone familiar with either band would sense it as well.
B002TYZKIM|4.0|This DVD made me so sad that Michael Jackson died. What I noticed most about \\"THIS IS IT\\" is how thin and frail he looked. He pushed himself, obviously, but you could see he was struggling to offer the same amount of energy the much younger dancers had. In some dance sequences he barely dances (moves his arms and legs kind of half-heartedly, like afraid to do too much); sometimes he was robotic; and throughout he never sings, just lip syncs though all the songs. It's almost painful to watch, knowing that he was tricked into doing 50 shows when he was not up to it. He wasn't performing because he loved it and missed it, but because he had enormous debts. This was not a happy man, and now the company is trying to recoup their ticket losses by selling \\"what might have been\\". Well, judging by this video, what \\"might have been\\" might have been worse - suppose MJ had collapsed on stage during one the performances and died? He tries so hard in this video I can believe it happening - he didn't want to disappoint the fans. The other sad thing is the interviews with other dancers, all of whom are soooo enthusatic and excited about working with MJ. Sadly, they all lost their jobs when MJ died. After all those months of training, that was awful. That was hard to watch too. It was too sad. But as films go, this concert film feels raw and thrown together - it's the sight of seeing MJ in his final performance that is the focus. Years later, when the grief has subsided, I'm sure others will see this as a rushed concert film, not particularly well-made or well-edited.
030745455X|5.0|Larsson's writing and its translation are better the 2nd go around.<br /><br />The second of the Millenium trilogy begins with a story for Mikael's paper on the sex trade. Especially why it continues to proliferate in spite of some of the most stringent laws on the books in all of Europe.<br /><br />The journalist pitching it is writing it in tandem with his girlfriend's thesis. People in the highest echelon are involved in the sex trade and its cover-up.  They work with Mikael and his magazine and do not cross until Lisbeth meets them on the same evening they are murdered. Lisbeth becomes the prime suspect.<br /><br />As a result, Lisbeth and her life are under a microscope by the police. As a result, all of Lisbeth's contacts are drawn into investigating her past and searching for the true murderer.  The search brings to light all the players<br />involved in her \\"guardianship\\" and hospitalization at a sanitarium as a teen.<br /><br />The climax is a true testament to the fleshing out of the Lisbeth character.
B0032KNA4I|5.0|I received this movie when I was suppose to and I had no problems with it. The movie was thrilling.
B00133KHCY|5.0|What a nice movie, a pleasant film.  There are lots of twists and turns in this, and I kept waiting for the Hollywood version of the Greek tragedy, but it didn't happen.  This flick will leave you smiling and maybe even a bit misty eyed, a great one to watch with your spouse or SO.    Music is the backdrop, and the acting is as superb as the story is improbable.  For once Robin Williams doesn't dominate the scenes but plays the part of the benevolent scoundrel, who you'd love to hate, but can't. Freddie Highmore, the \\"orphan,\\" will steal your heart and you keep rooting for him as he squirms and wriggles through one musical scene after another trying to locate the parents he is convinced are still alive - parents who all the officials assure him are no longer around.    The story will suck you in, the music, a seemingly wacky combination of classical, street and pop, will entertain you and you'll not want any interruptions while you enjoy the story. Very difficult not to rate as five-stars !!
B0001HLVS2|5.0|\\"Master and Commander\\" was a great guy's flick - intense battle scenes, rugged sailors aboard a ship (indeed, most of the film takes place on the ship except for a brief time on the Galapagos), surviving a storm and drought, and other challenges.<br /><br />The acting by Russell Crowe and several other characters was great and I would imagine would be realistic for a ship crew during that time period.  At a little over 2 hours, the film seemed to breeze along smoothly and was enjoyable the whole time.<br /><br />The basic plot is an English ship trying to capture or sink a French ship during the time of Napoleon.  Without giving away the ending, I will tell you that the action was riveting and the film kept my interest.<br /><br />Watch and enjoy this \\"guy's flick\\" - okay, some women will enjoy it too!<br /><br />Recommended.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This version of Persuasion is (in my opinion) the best of the two I've seen. The acting is incredible and the story is very accurate to the book. There are some differences, of course: for example, The Mr. Eliot and his eldest daughter are quite unattractive whereas in the book they are supposed to be beautiful. Still, these changes did not greatly bother me as an Austen fan and I accept them as an alteration the director (or whoever) made to convey the true nature of these vain characters. Amanda Root is a very likable, mild, discerning, real Ann, and Cirian Hines (or however his name is spelled) plays a strong, intelligent, fallible, delightful Captain Wentworth. Definitely worth purchasing!     I received the package promptly and it was in perfect condition. It was also very inexpensive for the quality of the product.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|TAKEN<br /><br />STARRING: Liam Neeson, Maggie Grace, Famke Janssen, Leland Orser, Holly Valance, Katie Cassidy, Xander Berkeley and Oliver Rabourdin<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Luc Besson and Robert Mark Kamen<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Pierre Morel<br /><br />Rated: PG - 13<br />Genre: Action / Thriller<br />Release Date: 30 January 2009<br /><br />There is almost nothing more rewarding in a film, than one that can entertain you and stimulate your brain on current events simultaneously. Taken is marvelous at this because its premise is not only something that makes for a great action thriller, but is also a huge problem in the world today, often overlooked by many: human trafficking.<br /><br />Liam Neeson gives a balls-to-the wall performance as ex CIA operative Mills. Neeson may not look like an angry stud like Willis, Schwarzenegger or Stallone; but trust me, after seeing him here, he's more than convincing. I enjoyed seeing him play a ruthless villain in Batman Begins, and he takes that same dark edge and brings it to our hero in Taken.<br /><br />Mills has lived a vey fast paced life and seen action in numerous global conflicts to include Afghanistan. All that is behind him now though, as he has made plans to mend his tattered relationship with his teenage daughter Kim (Maggie Grace). Between the hurt feelings of several missed birthdays and Christmases due to the excessive travel of his job, and Kim's mother's new insanely rich live-in boyfriend; Mills has his work cut out for him.<br /><br />At 91 minutes, Taken is a very short film, especially for its genre. But it never seems short and it gives us everything we need early on, to care for its characters and the events that happen to them. The relationship between Mills and his daughter is crucial to the story and had it not been believable, the film would have suffered. It is believable. He cares for her more than anything in the world and wants nothing but for her to be happy.<br /><br />So naturally, when his ex-wife (Famke Janssen) and Kim need his permission for Kim to leave the country, to follow U2 to France with a friend, Mills wants to oblige them. It's painstakingly hard for him at first, as he is more than aware of the dangers that face a young girl traveling without adult supervision in Europe; but we already know from the film's title that he will let her go.<br /><br />Mills is super-smart however and exceptionally well prepared. He buys her a universal cell phone, and only agrees to let her go if she will in turn agree to calling and checking in with him at his approved times.<br /><br />On the first day in France, Kim witnesses from across the hall, her friend being kidnapped. The film's pivotal moment is a phone call between Kim and her father as she explains to him what is happening.<br /><br />When I first saw the trailer, I thought Mills was in on it, by his freakishly calm comment to his daughter, \\"They're going to take you.\\" But the only reason he is so calm is because he realizes he only has a few precious seconds to tell Kim what to do, before these heinous men take her. He tells her to hide under the bed and to shout out every detail that she can about her captors, and that he will come for her. The suspense builds from there as one of them actually picks up the phone, and Mills delivers some of the best one-liners in any action film of recent years. The scumbag's response? \\"Good luck.\\"<br /><br />Having obviously recorded this conversation with hi-tech spy equipment, Mills uses sources in Langley to assist in narrowing down the list of suspects. A nice little game of `I told you so', and an immediate plane ticket to France from his ex-wife and her rich boyfriend, and he's off.<br /><br />Taken could have easily been over the top and unrealistic but Neeson plays Mills so genuinely, that we never doubt he'd be capable of pulling any of these things off. Yeah, there are a few one guy takes on several guys action sequences, but they are executed well andinitiated with Mills' brains, rather than bronze. His wits and extensive training allow him to infiltrate these European trafficking layers with great ease.<br /><br />I have no idea how they pulled off a PG - 13 rating, but they did! The action is intense and in your face and the suspense could shatter bones. Mills has no mercy in this film and we love him for it. Watch for the scene that takes place at a dinner table, while Mills visits an old friend. You will never see what he does coming; you'll know the one I mean.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the actors they cast to play the villains in the film as well; you really want to see them suffer for what they've done to these young women. In case you are unfamiliar with the term human trafficking, let me simplify it for you. They kidnap young women, drug them, and sell them to rich men to use as sex slaves. Many of them as is the case with Kim are minors and virgins, and they go for the most cash. Make no mistake, this may be a big Hollywood movie, but this goes on every day in our world.<br /><br />I've read some skeptical reviews on the film from writers who seriously doubt that this world exits to the extent that the film portrays. I'm more than convinced that it's not far off. I've seen some truly evil people in my life and I've seen how money can corrupt people too. Give evil men money and power and what do you think they'll do with it? No-one can deny that these women go missing, so where are they going then?filtrate these European trafficking layers with great ease.

B001FB55L2|4.0|Jim Sheridan's much anticipated movie 'Brothers' most certainly lived up to my expectations.  The story involving a very nasty incident in Afghanistan during the war against the Taliban and the subsequent subsequent return home of the hero is drama of the highest level. Jake Gyllenhall and Natalie Portman both give superb performances as the hero's brother and wife.  The development of the brother's character from most irresponsible to fine upstanding citizen was excellently handled by Jake Gyllenhall as was Natalie Portman's as the wife.  Tobey Maguire's performance of our hero's post traumatic stress disorder on his return home was a mesmerising 'tour de force'.  Most highly reccommended.
0393072231|5.0|A week with this book has taught me more about how people on Wall Street think and operate, and about how little they actually know about what they're doing, than countless news stories and articles and interviews over the course of a year have. Lewis is a consummate storyteller, and he manages to make this story interesting by focusing first on the smart people, the ones who saw the collapse of the sub-prime mortage machine coming.  What will surprise you is how deliberately uninformed, reckless, greedy and just plain stupid pretty much all of the folks at the big companies remained through this whole mess.      Lewis also has a unique perspective, having worked on Wall Street and already written Liar's Poker, which was about the financial collapse in the 80's, a book which, at the end of The Big Short, his former boss says \\"f-ing ruined my life.\\"  That's one of my favorite points of The Big Short, where Lewis makes the point that, just like in the 80's, all the guys who had a hand in causing this crisis, whether they stay on Wall Street or not, have walked away from the table filthy rich.    I went to the actual book store to buy a copy for my mother and was surprised to find this book buried in the financial section, not even on the front shelves--and while I haven't read any of the multitude of other books on this topic, I can't believe any have done nearly as good a job at helping readers, even those completely disinterested in finance, understand the nuts and bolts of what these thousands of greedy imbeciles have done to our economy.
0385341008|5.0|In times of evil and hardship, it is comforting to know that there is solace in the world.  \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\\" is an endearing novel about courageous individuals during the Nazi occupation.<br /><br />On Guernsey Island, a group of men and women form a literary book club as a front to fool the Germans.  The novel, told in the format of letters, is a quick read.  I could not put the book down once I began.  Through all the tumult and horrors of war, the people on Guernsey found solace and strength through each other and through books.<br /><br />The audio version of this novel was read by a group narration.  All the narrators are exceptional, and the book will stay with you for a long time.  We all need to be reminded that hope exists even in the midst of strife.  I'd also recommend \\"Number the Stars,\\" by Lois Lowry, and \\"84, Charing Cross Road,\\" by Helene Hampf.  Happy reading, and God bless you.

Bride of Re-animator being #2.<br /><br /> So i had to order this from here.<br />I was not disapointed. It was a good as i remember.

An old adversary is back too.<br /><br /> I recommend seeing Re-animator first cause this is it's sequal followed by Beyond Re-animator
1557427283|3.0|Summary: I wouldn't suggest buying this book. You're better off Googling grammar rules as you get suspicious about your writing.<br /><br />Pro: Good summary of rules, with examples. I think the world would be a better place if everyone followed some rules: e.g., commas for dependent clauses, clarity on a statement's subject.<br /><br />Con: Some rules feel dated. They cover (1) rules that nobody breaks today or (2) wrong rules. An example of a wrong rule is suggesting that \\"We read a book, and trusting all of its rules, we made mistakes\\" is correct, while \\"We read a book and, trusting all of its rules, we made mistakes\\" is wrong (note comma's position). Language is a fluid organism; using an early-20th-century book today poses a risk to your style.<br /><br />Suggestion: stick to this: [...] . When in doubt, Google it.
B0001Z36PK|4.0|I recently became acquainted with the Neil Hannon project \\"The Duckworth Lewis Method\\" and was very impressed by the album. British music tradition in the vein of great songwriters like Ray Davies and Pete Townsend.<br /><br />I subsequently wanted to listen more closely to some of the recent The Divine Comedy, and the choice fell on the album \\"Absent Friends\\" from 2004. Perhaps it was not quite what I had hoped for although there without question are many beautiful songs on the album.<br /><br />Some of the tracks are a little too heavily arranged  for my taste - a little too grandiose. However, there are fine exceptions, where a simpler band-sound is predominant.<br /><br />Tracks like \\"Come Home Billy Bird\\", \\"The Happy Goth\\" and the title track are melodic Brit-pop at its best.<br /><br />Moreover, one must admit that songs like \\"Sticks and Stones,\\" \\"Our Mutual Friend\\" and \\"Charmed Life\\" is very fine compositions.<br /><br />Lyrically Hannon is a great storyteller. Good examples are \\"Our Mutual Friend\\" and \\"Come Home Billy Bird\\".
B003C5FMEE|5.0|Backatown is an incredible album which marks the national debut of New Orleans' brightest young talent Troy \\"Trombone Shorty\\" Andrews. This cd mixes funk, rock, & some hip hop beat,along with traditional Brass band Jazz music into a Gumbo pot of great sounds. There's not a bad song on the cd and some of the highlights are the title track \\"Backatown\\" as well as \\"Something Beautiful\\" which shows Lenny Kravitz' influence on Troy.  Overall, an excellent buy !

0307593525|5.0|Although I have to admit that I haven't yet made any of the recipes from either book, I'm giving it a 5 stars based on the layout and how easy most recipes look.  Had I not seen the movie, I probably would not have even considered even looking at this book.  Once it arrived I immediately opened it up and to my surprise, a lot of the recipes look fairly easy and  uncomplicated.  For some reason, I thought Julia Child's book would have recipes that were hard to make and with ingredients that I had never seen but that is not the case.  Can't wait to make my first recipe!

We purchased multiple copies for family and friends because we felt that, in good conscience, we couldn't keep the information to ourselves.  It is so much more readable and broad than the title suggests, and it will change lives.
B000NQRE0K|5.0|Most of us are aware that Braveheart won the coveted Best Picture Oscar in 1995. I'm not going to review the film itself. What you need to know is that the blu ray version of Braveheart is first rate and breathtaking from start to finish. Stunning detail and sharpness throughout. This is the best looking transfer from this era that I've yet seen on blu ray. Paramount reserves its blu ray \\"Sapphire Series\\" treatment for select few films (Braveheart, Gladiator, Forest Gump, and most recently Saving Private Ryan). Superb sound quality. Generous interesting special features. This is a must own for high def fans.
B00004SAAY|5.0|How can one heap more praise on J.S.`s compositional skills than have already been heaped?  I certainly can't and I won't even try!  All that I can say is that his extreme genius really shows itself in this wonderful recording of his Concertos for Harpsichord, Violin, Flute and Oboe--either originally written for the instrument or reconstructed from another composition (i.e. concerto for Oboe d'amore, strings and continuo in A major which was taken from the  Concerto for harpsichord BMV 1055)<br /><br />In this wonderful, \\"bargain basement\\" priced recording, we get five (5) discs for $34.85 that features Trevor Pinnock as conductor and/or harpsichordist leading the English Consort.  And do they ever perform delivering these marvelous works magnificently and wonderfully playing the \\"outer\\" fast movements with much vigor, tonal beauty and  great phrasing.  At the same time, they also play the \\"inner\\" slow movements with much beauty and warmth.<br /><br />DGG has done a great job transferring these older recordings--lovely sound that is so rich and warm.  Do buy this collection if you desire to hear dear Johann at his very best and played superbly.

This amazing, energetic, misunderstood sub-culture has little press. The extremes of the culture are fodder for generic sensational stories. (I mean who wants to hear about 50 skins drinking and seeing a band with no violence occurring?).   representation of skins in cinema: Some awful 70's \\"Skinhead\\", which was in name only; \\"Suburbia\\"; \\"Meantime\\", \\"Made in Britain\\", accurate, but scary. And the ultimate in ridiculous, \\"American History X\\". Despite stunning cinematography from Kaye - phenomenal acting from D'Angelo, Gould and Norton - this script was a glorified After School Special, contingent on a contrived script. Although it does represent the Metzger sub-section, all in all it was silly.  \\"Made in England\\" by Shane Meadows (who was an actual skin) is a strong film. It explores the chasm between pride and ism (nationalism, racism, etc). It is set in the tumultuous 1982 of England. It portrays a fatherless (lost in the Falklands conflict)child, a working mother, and the charismatic draw of a single, struggling man.   When i watched this on the big screen in Newport, i was floored. Here is finally a film that can delve into the nuances of a culture without falling into the tempting traps of sensationalism. Here, there is not nazis and anti-racists; not a clear contrast in ideologies. What there is, is blossoming Nationalism in a time of fear and unknown repercussions.  This dances on the fine line of how confusing a sense of pride can be and the frightening slope that people slip down. We watch these images through the eyes of a child, and it is easy to see how simple this predicament could be. But naiveté is no excuse. and the will be consequences. Beautifully shot, Superbly acted; kept taut and tense and morose, Meadows skilfully tells a compelling story.  This film had a scary reverberationin a post 9-11 America. And should serve as a warning. Too bad no Oi bands would attach themselves to this, but a fantastic skinhead reggae soundtrack over images of desolation and war is fun. and to see boots, braces, and Ben Shermans on a big screen that is usually filled with pop culture and vapid people, moved me. i love this film. Oi!
B001EI5CA0|5.0|If snowflakes made a sound, that is.  Very pretty music; suitable for the time surrounding Christmas, but not so Christmassy that you can't enjoy it all winter.
B001G70M6S|3.0|I have only taken one photo so far.  I pulled out the white tab with great difficulty.  The black tab did not come out far enough for me to get hold of.  By opening the camera and some VERY careful maneuvering I got the tab out far enough.  When I pulled the photo out I ended up losing the next photo.  With more experience I might avoid this in the future, but this film DEFINITELY has a problem with tab design as well as being very difficult to pull through the rollers.  I'm hoping the rest of the pack will be trouble-free!    By the way, the photo came out beautifully except for a roller mark from where I stopped pulling briefly.
B0039SFKSW|5.0|Asia's 2010 release \\"Omega\\" is one of the band's best.<br /><br />Stylistically, it is a combination of 80's era Asia and the songs on the Wetton/Downes \\"Icon\\" series. So, knowing that going in, expect this record to be very accessible and \\"poppy\\" to a degree. There is nothing here that resembles 1996 \\"Arena\\" era Asia, and that is fine, because that is more of John Payne's style than Wetton's. As for Steve Howe, he is in fine, fine form once again here. The guitar solos are not as fast and furious as they were at times on \\"Phoenix,\\" but \\"Omega\\" has twice the hooks, making it a marginally better record, which is saying something, since Phoenix was very good in its own right.<br /><br />Highlights include \\"Finger on the Trigger\\" which was a song taken from the Icon series, and also \\"I Believe\\" which could have come right off of 1982's \\"Alpha.\\" Other tunes, such as \\"Holy War,\\" \\"Light the Way,\\" and \\"Listen Children\\" are more pop-rock than prog-rock. But the elements are still present in small doses.<br /><br />There are a couple of ballads too many, and that is mainly because they don't develop hooks as strong as the rockers. As hard as the song \\"Emily\\" tries, it never really takes hold. But that is a minor complaint. This is one of Asia's best albums, and it almost defies the laws of physics and genetics that this band is still this good considering their considerable......experience. A mature, well-crafted set of tunes from four guys who have delivered time and time again.
B002ZG9846|5.0|This film is a work of art. People who haven't seen the film yet cast their reviews putting the film in a negative light...step aside.  This film hits all the spots.  It is funny, exciting and refreshing in world that increasingly seeks to censor every little thing. A large bulk of negative reviews are from extremely naive parents.  Nuff said!  Great film!
B002VPE1B6|3.0|If you just want to see the regular movie in standard 16:9 format, then this disk is fine. Nice quality transfer, 1080p, no promos or commercials. If, like me, you have a full home theatre system that utilizes the 2.35 to 1 movie aspect ratio that most high-end Blu-ray disks feature, then you'll be dissapointed. You really notice the cropping of the sides of the film to fit the 16:9 format on a movie of this scope. Also missing are a \\"Director's cut\\" longer version, which most James Cameron movies are known for when released on disk. On many - such as Terminator 2, Aliens and The Abyss - the longer home version makes a huge impact when viewing the movie. Hopfully the next Blu-ray version will contain all of this - it's just too bad it wasn't on this release.
B002TVQ4HG|4.0|This psychological thriller is a mind-bending exercise in cinematic treachery.  It's original and well done with an outstanding performance from Melissa George.  Nothing is as it seems and you'll find yourself enthralled with its complexity.  Go to the IMDB and the message board for this movie and you'll find some intriguing theories on the plotting.  Certainly an above average thriller and well worth your time.
0439023483|5.0|I loved this book & am about to start the 2nd.  Read the 1st in one sitting, though I kept promising myself I'd put it down \\"at the end of this chapter.\\"  Was described to me as appropriate for audiences who enjoyed Twilight & I agree.  Not related topics, but I believe they'll appeal to similar readers.  I absolutely loved it!
1400049628|5.0|This is one of the best books i have read. everyone needs to read this book at least once in their life. Mostly just for practicality. If one is prepare for a zombie Apocalypse then you are prepare for every major disaster that could possibly happen on earth.

B0021L8V1G|4.0|Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), AKA Iron Man, is targeted by Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), a Russian physicist with a hunger for vengeance and a talent for designing powerful energy whips, and Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell), a venal munitions manufacturer who covets Stark's fame and success.    It has become almost obligatory for everyone to say that this film is not as good as the first, but I liked it more.  Director Jon Favreau and screenwriter Justin Theroux incorporated a large number of elements from the Marvel Universe (Iron Man, Whiplash, Nick Fury and SHIELD, the Black Widow, Justin Hammer, War Machine) but made it all pull together in a coherent narrative.  This bodes well for the upcoming Avengers film, which Favreau will help produce.  The motif of the basically good but also weak man within the invulnerable suit of armor is used to good effect, but even the more weighty aspects of the film are handled with a light touch that keeps it hugely entertaining.  Also, character is not sacrificed for the sake of spectacle.  There may not be as much action as some might wish, but when it comes it really lets loose and the context gives it real stakes.
B00337KM2S|5.0|This movie was great!  Don't want to give anything away, but I spoke to a few people who really couldn't stand the shoe being on the other foot for a change.  George Clooney is just so likeable, and Vera Fermiga (sp?) and Anna Kendrick were both fabulous.    A really different movie, loved the family in northern Wisconsin, everything about it was authentic and you could see the price the main character had paid for his no-strings-attached lifestyle.  This is a movie men and women will both like.  I actually watched it twice, and I am not a chick flick kind of girl.  This is NOT a chick flick.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I enjoyed this film tremendously.  It actually was the first really great romance film I have seen in many years.  The costumes were stunning and the set design was amazing.  The acting was superb. I saw this movie twice in the movie theater and had to buy it.  At the heart of it, it is a love story which is so amazing at times it doesn't seem real even though this is a historical film. I think Queen Victoria would be proud of this film and Emily Blunt's portrayal of her. I have seen many British Royalty films and this is the first time I felt the real love between the Royals.  It is a real \\"feel good film.\\"
B002KVSJ64|5.0|As crazy as this sounds, I think my mom should have heard of Breaking Benjamin.  They are that good.  They should be that big.  But she hasn't.  So obviously something is wrong.    I actually saw them live back in '03 on tour with Cold and Godsmack.  We actually arrived at the concert a little late so their music just kind of ended up being background to our getting situated, finding seats, etc.  I had pretty much written them off as radio trash.  Boy was I wrong...    Here it is, years and years later, and Breaking Benjamin has suddenly become one of my favorite bands of all time (along with other timeless bands that are my favorites like Tool, The Tea Party, Muse..).  I wish I had paid more attention to them back when I saw them briefly in concert, I could be a long-time fan.  But here I am trying to play catch-up.  Let me just say this band is truly amazing.  There is not a single song by this band that I do not like.  I've not been able to say that about a 'newer' band in a LONG time...  they truly do not have a bad song.  It's like they don't know how to make one.  Beautifully put together, lyrics poetic, excellent studio mastery...    Just amazing.    Breaking Benjamin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Not a bad song on this album!  5-STARS like ALL their albums!!
0316069906|5.0|Although I stop eating red meat and pork in 2008, in the beginning of 2010 I only ate chicken and turkey. But before I even finished the book I became a vegetarian. For those on the outside looking in, it seems like a hard thing to do. But I've been weaning myself off meat and pretty much transitioned over a two week period. For me knowledge is so powerful and once I know the truth, I can't ignore it. Join me!
0307454541|5.0|I am actually listening on audio, but this book is great and intriguing.  I even find times getting to work and home and not wanting to stop listening.
0071373586|5.0|I have worked +12 years on marketing of multi-national companies and to me this book is a masterpiece for basic to middle experienced marketing managers, as it covers the basic concepts of positioning (also called equity or consumer image) with simple but eye-opening examples, is amazing how many millionaire failures I have seen that could have been avoided following cases from this books; i.e.: wonder why Axe shampoo is not as big as its amazing deodorant products ... or why Toyota keeps flying in the US despite latest bumps in the road?, read all the foundations here (but not these updated examples, unfortunatelly). Net a must for all marketers. I only missed more recent and complex examples taking into account a more globalized and digitalized world.    As usual I will end / begin saying that any good rating must consider: 1) performance (what I expected vs. what I got) and 2) value (how much I paid vs. what I got). This book adds value at a super price, is a no miss!
B001LF347E|4.0|I like this show even better the second time around. It's great watching it on dvd instead of having to wait each week to see what happens next. As others have mentioned it starts off a tad slow, but then most tv shows do have to take time to find their footing. Just don't take it seriously and enjoy the ride. If you like stories about Merlin and Arthur you will probably enjoy this. My only complaint is no episode guide on the dvd. Hopefully they will correct that when the second season is finished.<br /> I enjoy the fight scenes and the ways they find for Merlin to help Arthur while still keeping his magical ability a secret.
0143038583|1.0|This book is a long journey through many accusations, and little real substance. Michael Pollan devotes the first half of the book to criticizing the corporate agricultural machines of Cargill, ADM, and Monsanto, and the politics (subsidies) behind it all, but then weakly offers the solution as independent smaller farms utilizing a grass-based system versus the giant corporate machines utilizing a corn-based system. The fact that a McDonalds meal is actually 60% carbon molecules derived from corn doesn't tell me much. Is a carbon molecule derived from corn any less healthy for me than a carbon molecule derived from wheat, or from grass? A balanced diet in either case is probably what is essential. All conjecture, no medical facts or statistics. He then spends the remaining half of the book on his noble quest of killing a wild boar, and picking mushrooms, for his all natural \\"gatherers meal.\\"
B00288KNJU|5.0|Okay, I saw this in the theater in 3D.  I liked it and considered buying it in blu-ray, but didn't get around to ordering until about a month ago.    The 2D version is stunning.  Great color. Great sound.    I already knew that the actors and music were perfectly suited to the animation.  What I didn't expect was that I would find myself revisiting this dvd over and over again.  There is just so much to take in---everything works so well as a whole, and I marvel at the craftsmanship! It is one thing to have such an inspired vision, and another to actually bring it to life.  Also, the bonus material is well worth watching.   That \\"Other Father Song\\" by They Might Be Giants is just so catchy.  (Can't get it out of my head sometimes!) --and the rest of the soundtrack is memorable.  This blu-ray set is one of my favorites, along with Up, and Avatar and the Pushing Daisies television series.  If you enjoyed the movie in the theater, you will love owning the blu-ray disc.

0393072231|5.0|Michael Lewis took an arcane, complicated subject (the packaging and selling of sub-prime mortgage bonds and credit default swaps) and made it understandable and entertaining.  I enjoyed the stories of the odd assortment of individuals who out-guessed the market and found the book to be a fascinating read from start to finish.  I'd recommend it to anyone who has been trying to figure out what happened to bring about the recent economic crash and the bail out of the \\"too big to fail\\" investment banks.
B000000H7I|5.0|Arguably one of the most brutal albums ever made, Suffocation's much lauded classic \\"Effigy of the Forgotten\\" stands as a testament to metal's ability to make you want to get up and smash things. This death-grind masterpiece goes full speed ahead from start to finish with every instrument playing as fast, technically, and especially loud as possible.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|The film that started the Disney/Pixar collaborations.    Who does not love the original \\"Toy Story\\" if you are an animation fan?    A great film, memorable characters.  Buzz Lightyear is my favorite.  The flaw, still NOT a Randy Newman fan.    We ALL know the reason for this March 2010 DVD release was to promote the June 2010 release of \\"Toy Story 3\\".    For fans this DVD release is a let down.  YOU WILL DO MUCH BETTER WITH THE 2005 2 DISC DVD PACKAGE.  GO FIND 1 OF THOSE, THIS EDITION IF YOU WANT EXTRAS IS A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT.    Only 1 disc compared to the 2005 2 disc edition.    A bunch of extras-ONLY FEW MENTIONED ON OUTSIDE DVD PACKAGE.  Most of them for kids.  I am a fan of the film, I want making of specials, actor information, etc.  Do NOT look for stuff like that here.  Go to the 2005 DVD 2 disc package.    NO chapter search list.  NO film information inside.    IF you want just the most & basic extras this is for you.  IF you want more information/extras YOU ARE BETTER OFF GETTING THE 2005 2 DISC RELEASE.    5 rating FOR FILM NOT DVD PACKAGE
0312370849|3.0|For me, Sarah's Key is a study in contrasts.  The first is the narrative structure (at least in the 1st part) which alternates between the story of Sarah, a young jewish girl caught up in event of the Vel D'Hiv in 1942.  The other story is ex-pat Julia Jarmond who is a journalist writing about these events for her magazine.  Julia discovers a link to these events through her french husband's family.    The next contrast is my reaction.  I really enjoyed the first half of the book where the story alternated between Sarah and Julia.  Sarah's story is quite compelling, giving a personal glimpse into an event where the child has no idea what/why the events are occurring.  Julia's voice and story provided a bigger tableau on horrors of the holocaust, but also despite the events, some of the events have been forgotten.  However, once the story completely focused on Julia, I quickly began to lose interest.      The last contrast for me is that I thought that the writing was not very good, especially in Julia's voice.  Maybe I'm being overly picky, but the author often started paragraphs in a series of questions which I found very annoying.  I felt like this would be a great book for young adults except that certain aspects of Julia's story are very adult-themed.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|After the original 1995 \\"Toy Story\\" the 1 that started Disney/Pixar collaborations.  Film fans know the history of \\"Toy Story 2\\".

B001IAOEXU|5.0|Sony really should have incorporated these triggers into the original design.  After playing w/ them, it is nearly impossible for me to play w/o them.  They stop the finger slip, which for me, often causes me to lose :)  I have 3 sets of them.  Worth every penny.

1573229725|5.0|If you read a lot of book blogs, I'm sure you've come across a few reviews of Fingersmith by Sarah Waters. And I bet they all have one thing in common: the reviewer laments the fact that they can't really tell you any more than the bare bones of the plot because then it would spoil the book for you. Then they go on to praise the book and tell you \\"Just read it. Trust me. It is that good.\\"<br /><br />So who am I to attempt to do the impossible? You truly cannot write too much about Fingersmith without spoiling everything that makes Fingersmith such a dizzying, delightful read. I saw a comment by Nymeth from Things Means A Lot (who wrote one of the best reviews of this book I've come across) on another blogger's review of Fingersmith that said:<br /><br />  The first rule of Fingersmith is that you don't talk about Fingersmith.<br /><br />Of course, this is a reference to Fight Club (of which I've only seen the movie and not read the book), but, when I thought about it, there are definite parallels between Fight Club and Fingersmith (aside from the need to be close-mouthed about plot points). And so I felt I must respect the code and not talk too much about this book. But here is what I can tell you.<br /><br />* Reading this book is like looking into a kaleidoscope. You see things fitting together in an intricate pattern but then you turn it and all the pieces align in a new pattern. And then you turn it again ...<br /><br />* Reading this book is like boarding those Wild Mouse rides you see at amusement parks where you get whipped around on these crazy sharp turns that make your head spin.<br /><br />* Reading this book is like watching Mission Impossible where the ... WAIT ... I can't continue with that one. It might give too much away.<br /><br />Let's just say that if Fingersmith was a food, it would be a pretzel. (Because of the twists). I think the true brilliance and fun of Fingersmith is the plot twists that leave you feeling dizzy, invigorated, duped, nodding, shaking, and wanting to leap ahead to find out where Waters is going to take you next. (But don't think the plot twists are all the book has going for it. It is also amazingly well-written; provides a brilliant sense of atmosphere; and creates memorable, indelible characters that will stay with you.)<br /><br />So, what else can I tell you?<br /><br />* The book is set in Victorian England. Now usually this is a turn-off for me. I associate \\"Victorian\\" with \\"dead boring.\\" (Unfairly, I suppose, as I haven't read all that much of it.) I always think books set in the Victorian era will focus too much on virtue and being good and social niceties and the big scandal would be if someone used the wrong spoon to stir their tea. (I'm totally speaking out of my ass here, by the way. I don't know ANYTHING about Victorian novels ... just a vague sense of what I think Victorian novels are or would be like. I'm sure many of you will try to convert me now.) So, if you have an unfair prejudice against books from the Victorian era like I did, discard them. This book is ANYTHING but boring and stuffy.<br /><br />* Fingersmith is a term that means \\"petty thief,\\" which is how one of the main characters, Sue Trinder, earns her living in London. Fingersmith might also refer to someone who has mastered a skill involving the use of his or her fingers. It could also have another connotation that makes more sense after you read the book but I'm not going to tell you about it. OK ... I will ... let's just say the book has been called \\"lesbian Victoriana.\\" So now you figure it out yourself. (And that is your only \\"warning\\" that this book deals with the Love That Dare Not Speak Its Name.)<br /><br />* The book is 582 pages but once you hit the end of the first part, you will want to read the book at every available opportunity so make sure you have the time available. Once you board the crazy ride that is Fingersmith, you won't want to get off!<br /><br />* You will never look at a pair of white gloves in quite the same way.<br /><br />Oh ... enough already. Just read it!!! Trust me!!!! You'll love it!! (Unless you really don't care for suspenseful, twist-filled, well-written, unforgettable, kick-ass, Gothic, big themed, psychologically thrilling, heart-in-your-mouth historical fiction. If that isn't your type of book, then by all means skip it.)<br /><br />I hereby award Fingersmith 5 stars and pretty much guarantee it is going to be one of my Top 10 reads of the year.hite gloves in quite the same way.<br /><br />Oh ... enough already.

0765322889|4.0|I'm sad that I waited this long to start reading the Malazan Book of the Fallen. It is a refreshing change from the heroic fantasy of the likes of Robert Jordan. While I enjoy the hero's journey, Erikson makes his world feel more real even though it is, at times, even more fantastic.
B001BWTVMO|4.0|I bought the SHM version of Led Zeppelin II from japan because I hoped I could get a better sounding CD of a classic album and band.  I am a big fan of Zeppelin.  I have all the remastered CDs (1994?)  I own Led Zeppelin 2003 DVD, and The Song remains The Same remastered DVD.  I also have a paige/plant video called No Quarter and a couple of greatest hits.  I paid $25 for this SHM (super high molecular) material CD.  I am also a HiFi buff.<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect from this CD.  maybe I was hoping on less distortion or smoother highs.  some people have said that SHM cds sound more \\"warm\\" or \\"analog\\" maybe even \\"vinyl\\" (minus scratches I guess).  I just had a quick listen to both CDs again...  The SHM cd has a greater amount of low volume elements in the sound.  softer parts of vocal reverb, more subtleties of cymbals and instrument timbre's  and the overall volume of the tracks are not pushed right up to 0db and do not feel as squished in the mix.  resulting in lower distortion.  overall I prefer the SHM cd, but I'm not sure if alot of these \\"improvements\\" will be heard on an average stereo.<br /><br />The packaging is a CD sized replica of the original bi-fold album sleeve.  there is also a paper/mylar? sleeve (no LZ printing on it).  The disc itself looks similar the the US Atlantic CD except some of the colors are different.  THE DISC IS ***NOT*** A MINI REPLICA OF A VINYL RECORD.  the SHM cd does come with an extra white paper booklet (printed in japanese with english lyrics)  I can't read Japanese, but there appears to be a review or history of the band and maybe discussions about the songs on the disc.<br /><br />Overall I prefer the SHM disc, but I might not get more of the SHM cds because of the price.<br /><br />If you are a big Led Zeppelin fan and have a very high quality stereo, you might want to at least pick up your favorite album on SHM from japan.  enjoy
B00275EGWY|3.0|2009's Oscar winner for Best Picture was a bit of a bust. The film follows the work of a bomb-disposal unit in Iraq. There's plenty of boom-boom, and the film provides a sense of Iraq that is dreary, desolate and dangerous. But like many recent war movies -- \\"Jar Heads\\" being one -- it fails to deliver on the inner lives of its characters. We see comrades fighting brutally among themselves and taking insane risks, but get no insight into what drives them. Even the \\"hurt locker\\" of the title barely gets its due. Some might call this respecting the audience's intelligence, but I call it lazy and shallow.<br /><br />At the end of the day, the film has little to say about Iraq, and less to say about modern warfare or the life of a soldier. Other than \\"war is fun for some people.\\"
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Probably the all-time classic Christmas story. The characterizations are absolutely timeless! Jimmy Stewart & Donna Reed work well together. Supporting cast members complement them very well.
B0019N8P2W|3.0|Don't get me wrong; I love Daria both as a character and as a series, but this is a half-assed release on the part of MTV. They decided against playing the opening credits before each episode, only at the beginning of the first episode on each disc. This is something I've not seen in a DVD release since, well, since Daria was airing on TV. This is baffling since they included the mid-episode cut scenes before commercial breaks. The most damning thing, however, is that they didn't bother to clean up the transfer. Some of the episodes have a bit of jitter to them, and some episodes have a good deal of dust and scratches on it that make it look closer to VHS quality rather than DVD quality.<br /><br />The scrubbing of late 90s and early 2000s music from the episodes was a regrettable, but understandable decision for a series that had come and gone before the rise of DVD releases of American TV shows (and before contracts were drawn up with record companies to include a tune's use in later release). The most noticeable scrub-job I've seen so far is Adagio for Strings from the end of the episode, \\"The Daria Hunter.\\" The scene of Sandy running after the bus and falling down is referencing Platoon, but without the music from Platoon playing in the background, the scene just sort of falls flat. It's a minor annoyance for fans of the show, but it's significantly less annoying to me than the jitter, the dust, and the scratches.<br /><br />The best thing about this release for fans is that many of the episodes haven't been seen in their entirety for years because certain things were just a bit too racy for The N and sadly, those were the episodes that were often included in torrents of the series. This fact alone is worth the price of admission despite all the flaws.
B00005LK95|4.0|Not the caliber of the first one but still an enjoyable movie to watch. Characterizations were well done but the robot is the star!
B003E8P9G0|4.0|Gong into this book, I had high expectations. I've read and loved the Percy Jackson, so I expected no less from this book.  The only things I didn't like about the book was that it was written like they were saying it into a tape. The warning in the beggining of the book? That confused me. And also, fight after fight after fight!  But in all, I did like the book. This book made me laugh a lot.  I tip my hat to Mr. Riordan. :-)
B002VECM72|4.0|I have always enjoyed movies that are based on true stories, this one does not dissapoint.  It was very well done.
B000002MUQ|4.0|I just recently bought Balance after being a life-long Van Halen fan but giving up on them during my college/Grunge days in the early 90's.  Fortunately, I got a little reminiscent (had to use MS spell check for that one) for my favorite band from the 70's and 80's and decided to buy balance.  I have always been both a Roth and Hagar fan but have alway considered 5150 one of my favorite albums of all time.  This is easily the 2nd best Van Hagar album and one of their top 5 albums.  Like many reviewers have said, this album got lost in the Pearl Jam / Nirvana days of the mid-nineties but still holds well 15 yrs later.  The production is better than any other VH album and it makes me long for the Sammy days again.<br /><br />Buy and enjoy!
B0021L8V1G|3.0|Of course it is important to understand that this is a movie based on a comic strip.  It is not and was never intended to be great cinematic art but it is a fun movie and entertaining.<br /><br />Property Destruction = 4 stars -- The Taliban must be dying of envy<br />Special effects = 3 stars -- lack of creativity and more and more iron men doesn't make the special effects better.<br />Screen Play = 4 stars -- saved by final scene with Senator Stern which was very clever<br />Character Development  = 4 stars -- Good supporting cast<br />Acting = 4 stars -- Downey may be a waste as a person but he has immense talent and it is fully used in this movie.  Well done.  Paltrow also does a great job and given a much better chance to show her talent in this sequel. Mickey Rourke also did an excellent job especially with the accent.  In fact the entire cast did a great job.<br />Sound track = 2 stars -- the sound track at the beginning was so annoying it destracted from the movie rather than enhancing it.<br />Personal Hygiene = 1 star -- I am sort  of tired of seeing the leading men walking around looking like they haven't shaved in days or taken  a bath in weeks.<br /><br />Nevertheless this is a fun movie -- not quite as good as the original but fun nevertheless. Downey and Paltrow are a pleasure to watch and probably saved the movie because it would be hard to imagine anyone else playing these parts.
B002SQFZ68|4.0|...or JBJ's voice is really nasal in this DVD. Almost annoying. ANYWAY, nice concert. But Bon Jovi still owe us, fans of live recording a good live DVD/DOuble CD of a single concert shot in one night! Like a Real Live BAnd that they are!
