B004ZJZQH4|5.0|I saw this movie some years ago but it has taken me a while to make the purchase.  I am so glad I did! You gotta take a second look at this film. I know, you say you are not into the history of or even the factual bases of the whole space thing.  Well, I say this: It's not about the space program or the facts of the whole incident that nearly cost three lives during the space program, it's about how a  few individuals pulled together at a crucial time to save another life.  Look at it and see how moving, how amazing the stars of this film pulled this off  right before your very eyes.  I say again, this film is a great one!!
0525423656|5.0|If you love romance and friendship this is for you! All i have to say is im sooo excited for the third book! Yay!
B004K4IZ54|3.0|I absolutely loved Tron: Legacy and I was so excited about seeing it in 3D. My excitement was soon quenched after just a very short excursion into the movie. I purchased the Imax- Under the Sea and it was outstanding. Tron is NOTHING in comparison. I also watched Avatar 3D before seeing the 3D version of Tron and maybe that was the reason for so much disappointment. Tron: Legacy is not even in the same league at all. I cannot understand why viewers are giving this film such high marks. I just do not see it. Each to his/her own.
B005ER6SNM|5.0|gave 5 star if you consider that this movie succeded as horror.otherwise its just sick garbage.the point of director was to shock people with some really deep,dark and sick sexual fantasies.many people blame this movie but it was stated that it is controversial.warning:might be too graphic for many women to watch this and anybody else who's sensitive.since i grew up in serbia and much of the world dislike us,watch this movie to hate us to the bone:)

1582701709|5.0|I have never written a review on amazon.com and i am a very frequent user but right now i feel i have to give my honest review. Seeing how some people can say this is a horrible book just saddens me. Hopefully anyone searching for a better life no matter what your situation is this is the book. This book has changed my entire life and also my entire family. 3 years ago my father gave me this book and it was the darkest time of my life. My home was put in foreclosure, my mother attempted to commit suicide and I was told i would not graduate high school. I cried and suffered my entire life because of the lack of knowledge I had over the law of attraction. When i began applying this law i realized this was so real. I felt like I was a warrior with this book. Like it was life or death at that point and I was going to live no matter what. My home was sold after one year, i graduated high school on time, and my mother is the greatest miracle of all.This book is for the believers. I hope this book continues to bless the lives of who truly are desperate for help. I am FOREVER grateful for this book. Thank you so much Rhonda Bryne for this book.
B0053VKP8S|2.0|I purchased this item due to my new HDTV not having headphone jacks which apparantly a lot of them don't.  So I ran a digital audio cord from my TV to this device, and then rca cables from this device to input jacks on a tuner, which in turn has a head phone jack; the box does the job but will not play dvd recorded episodes seeming to make them off limits with a loud 'do not go there' noise.  It will transmit anything from my blue ray player such as CDs or Netflix movies, but makes a loud ticking noise at odd intervals; your ears get used to it after its on for a few minutes and you get involved with whatever you are watching, but it is certainly a nuise, this 'tick' going off every 30-120 seconds.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|To be able to tell a story as serious as this was and still inject some humour is truly amazing.  The actors did themselves proud and the production was excellent.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire and this app is great. it even let's you use any photo you want as the background and back of the cards. I highly recommend this download if you like solitaire.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I if I had to wait six years for this book to come out I probably would have hated it too. I have read all these books together in the past month or so and this was the first book that I actually skimmed through a few chapters. I know Feast for Crows got really mixed reviews but I still highly enjoyed it anyway. But this book actually has a chapter that we've already read from Crows in here but it's Jon's point of view not Sam's. I thought that was a real waste of space. And I don't care for Vitarion and I thought there was useless time spent on the Dornish men here. I've read that Crows and Dragons was originally one book but GRRM broke it up into two planing that Dragons would come out within the year of Crows and it never happened that way because GRRM decided to rewrite Dragons. My feeling is he probably shouldn't have done that. Oh well. There is usually a dud in every batch. Hopefully the next book does not take any where near as long to come out. I still can't wait to read it.
B001IF277K|5.0|Exact same battery that came with my Xperia Play, so far it works as well as the original. While the packaging was just a plastic sleeve, in a bubble envelope, this really couldn't matter less.
B004LWZW4M|4.0|Totally different from the original! but better I thought.  The special effects were brilliant.  Pure escapism.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Lola
B0067LY4WG|4.0|Ten New Songs and the Future were both better.  On this album and on Dear Heather, he is just phoning it in, and I wish he would quit opening albums with embarassing songs where he literally refers to himself. (Yeah, I know it's some of that Mount Baldy Zen shtick, but pleaeeeease!)  And more guitar, please, Lenny. Playing over a synthesizer track... getting SOOO old!  Maybe it's as Joyce said to Yeats when he met him... \\"You're far too old for me to be of any use to you.\\"  Still an A- minus, just for effort. The cornet tracks are good. But we're still waiting on your Christmas album.
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|Loved it!  From High Island to the garbage heaps of Brownsville to Orcas Island...from a family of lifetime birders...been there and done that!
0142800805|5.0|This CD set arrived in exactly the condition as in the listing.  I am usually concerned about purchasing unseen CD's but they all played well and I am quite satisfied.
0385344228|5.0|If you are a character-driven reader, you'll be totally captivated by this novel. Defending Jacob by William Landay is intense. While you'll fly through it, turning page after page, unable to put it down, you will be emotionally drained once you're done. One family is torn apart by a murder charge no one could have imagined. As the reader dives deeper into the Barbers' lives she's not sure what to believe. Is Jacob guilty? Is he innocent? Labeled a family drama, a legal thriller and a psychological thriller, Defending Jacob grabs on and never lets go.<br /><br />This story is told by former Assistant District Attorney Andrew Barber, who has been subpoenaed in April 2008 by his former colleague, Neal Logiudice. And as much as this story is about the Barbers, it is also about Logiudice: his blind ambition, his determination to succeed, and his desire to prove he's one better than his predecessor.<br /><br />Defending Jacob is certain to add more awards to William Landay's resume. I highly recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun game, the kids love to play them, and fun for adults to....also having to play to unlock creates an all together different challenge

B0054JZC6E|4.0|awesome game no complaints my 4 yr old enjoys playing .... like that you can unlock games makes the point of playing enjoyable
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its a fun game its just seems like its for kids mostly but other than that its a five star rating!
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Wasn't expecting to like this \\"pre-Spartacus\\" mini-season nearly as much as Season 1 (Spartacus: Blood and Sand), but WOW, I totally LOVED IT!  Just as good as Season 1 (Blood and Sand) in my opinion.  And I really liked the fact that they toned down the \\"graphic novel-style\\" comic-booky action scenes that bothered and distracted me in Season 1.  They still have the somewhat overdone 300-style slow-mo stuff, but that's not too bad.  Overall, the action scenes were very good and I was totally into the multiple-on-going stories.  The writers did a really excellent job.  VERY entertaining series.  Great acting, and I LOVED the addition of actress Jaime Murray's new character Gaia.  Both the character and the actress are AWESOME!!!  The sets, costumes, music, cinematorgraphy were all incredible.  And as is now the series' signature, LOTS of nudity and sex, so this show is for adults-only.  Highly recommend this 6-episode mini-season that is a PREQUEL to Season 1 (Spartacus: Blood and Sand), to all those who enjoyed Season 1!  And if you have not watched any of the Spartcus TV shows yet, you may want to watch Gods of the Arena first (Season 2) and then Blood and Sand (Season 1) afterwards, as Season 2 is a PREQUEL to Season 1.  Really look forward to Spartacus: Vengeance (which will be the third season)! Major props and nods of respect to all those invoved with making this terrific series!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I show this game to everyone I know. They love it too!  This is highly recommended by my whole family.

B005HSG3TC|4.0|Does a great job of protecting my Kindle Fire and does not add significant bulk or weight.  I liked the video on Amazon that demonstrated the cover, so I knew what I was getting. When I bought this it was significantly cheaper than the competition.  It looks to me like the competition's prices are coming down--indication to me that this is a good product.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! I love the fact that you can have the verse read to you and many more good extras that just make Bible reading easier! very very very highly reccomended!

B001HN6922|2.0|I enjoyed the first one much more.  Not as clever and less innocent.  I thought they relied on sexual jokes too much... anyone can do that. Disappointing.
B00000JLWW|5.0|It was just as described! Shipping was fast! This was an excellant purchase. I lost my orginal movie in a house fire. I just had to replace it. Thank you so much. This is one of the best movies of all time. I will definately purchase from this seller again.
0812550757|4.0|OK, so the whole reason you're looking at this book review is because you fell in love with Ender's Game or, more probably, you fell in love with Ender himself.  If you want to read more about Ender, you have to read this book.  But I'm telling you now, this is no easy task.  The rest of Ender's story is told in three books: Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide and Children of the Mind.  If you're going to read the first of those, be prepared to read all three.  You can't stop with just Speaker for the Dead.  But you COULD stop right now, having only read Ender's Game, and be satisfied.  No?  Well, I warned you...  Everyone else is going to tell you that Speaker for the Dead is *completely* different from Ender's Game.  IT IS.  Imagine pairing the Hunger Games with Seven Years in Tibet.  That's how different these two books are.  But as bizarre as it sounds, the progression of Ender's character is totally believable.  If you're looking for more Battle School stories, I would skip this book and move on to Ender's Shadow.
B0064MT1QW|5.0|This movie looks great in HD blu ray.  I watched it twice just because everything popped and it was like watching the film for the first time.  There were lots of details that were previously muted that are now visible in blu.  The sound is also great.  The story is mature and for adults who have a full understandng that human nature is flawed.  You don't have to agree with the love story to enjoy the fact that expert craftsmen within the business earned their pay.  Cinematically it is beautiful to watch and on an emotional level you anticipate the impending train wreck but nonetheless keep watching.  A very well made well told story.  Highly recommended especially in blu.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|After Grisly Manor I was hungry for more and this game did not disappoint.  From the fantastic graphics to the engaging puzzles to the subtle music, I loved it all.  The journal, map, and hints are great adds.  Finished Manor in 2 hours and Lost City in about 6.  I would pay as much as $5 if I knew I would be playing for at least a week.  Keep them coming! I can't wait for the next one!

B0059XTUB8|4.0|There are movie stars, and there are Movie Stars. For ten short years, few shone as bright as Marilyn Monroe's. In the fifties and early sixties, she was every American man's dream girl, from presidents to princes. She might have been the quintessential female star of the Hollywood sound era, a pinup Greta Garbo in living, luscious color.<br /><br />You won't need to be a fan (or a man) to fall in love with \\"My Week with Marilyn,\\" which features some of the best performances of 2011. In a role that would scare off scores of actresses, Michelle Williams is nearly spot-on as the once-plain Norma Jeane.<br /><br />At the height of her fame in 1956, Monroe traveled to Olde England to make \\"The Prince and the Showgirl,\\" directed by none other than Laurence Olivier, the regal grand man of the British stage and screen. During brief intermissions in the troubled production, the 30-year-old Monroe struck up an unlikely friendship (and perhaps more) with Colin Clark (Eddie Redmayne), a lowly assistant director not unexpectedly dazzled by the blonde bombshell.<br /><br />Clark's 1995 memoir (\\"The Prince, the Showgirl and Me\\") was followed by \\"My Week with Marilyn\\" in 2000, and those few days have been translated with taste and movie-loving brio by director Simon Curtis and screenwriter Adrian Hodges. Unlike the exploitative handling of Monroe before and after her tragic death in 1962, Curtis, Williams and company have fleshed out the person behind the one-dimensional star image: insecure, innocent, frightened, and mercurial--as well as a heavenly vision of beauty and sensuality....<br />--------<br />Full review now playing at \\"Deeper Into Movies - The Current (and Classic) Cinema\\" [...]) and on Facebook.
0439023491|5.0|I was given the Hunger Games for Christmas. I was slow to start it but once I did I couldn't put it down. As much as I loved the first one, Catching Fire blew my mind. It was by far my favorite of the trilogy. I read it in 1 weekend (completely blowing off all the errands and chores I needed to accomplish). I wish this series could last forever!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Fairly easy to use, tags are nice, GUI could be better and more intuitive. Overall, okay app, a little frustrating at first.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|The hundreds of other reviews will tell you this is a great fan.  I just wanted to write a quick review to let anyone know that this fits comfortably inside the [[ASIN:B0026FCI2U Cooler Master HAF 922]] case even with the 200mm side fan installed. This is a VERY tall CPU heatsink so it might not fit in every case.
B0059XTUMC|4.0|Iris in on an ornate picture palace in 1927 Los Angeles. Onstage, suave matinee-idol George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) hams it up at the premiere of his latest flick before a packed house of smartly dressed Jazz Agers. In this cinematic love letter written and directed by Michel Hazanavicius, Valentin's character is sealed with a kiss blown back to such icons as Douglas Fairbanks as well as sound star Gene Kelly....<br /><br />Despite Dujardin's charming, nimble presence (he won Cannes' Best Actor award), the real star of the show is the film itself, a jaunty black-and-white trip down the memory lane of the silver screen. Shot in the boxy 1.33 celluloid format of old, \\"The Artist\\" is anything but square; it looks so positively right that its negative might have been uncanned from the vaults of MGM, Paramount or Fox (pre-Murdoch) during the bygone studio years....<br /><br />Audiences may be amazed and delighted by Hazanavicius's adoring attention to period detail, from Murphy beds and \\"Pickfair\\"-era Hollywood mansions to such quaint screen punctuations as wipes, irises and slow fades. While \\"The Artist\\" borrows too much to be an artistic masterpiece in its own right, it deserves a joyful exclamation--aloud--for its heart.<br />-----<br />Full review now playing at \\"Deeper Into Movies - The Current (and Classic) Cinema\\" (deepintomovies.blogspot.com) and on Facebook.
0743277465|5.0|This book is a wonderful in-depth self awareness guide filled with a lifetime of wisdom.  It teaches the development of the learning process in a competitive environment and any other aspiring practices.  It explains how important it is find the value in our mistakes, failures, and even our victories and accomplishments.  Even these preceding sentences are an understatement to how insightful this book is.  If I could put my credibility on the line I would do it and recommend this book.  5 stars for sure!

030788743X|4.0|If you haven't stumbled across this one yet, but basic plot is pretty simple. It's the year 2044, and humanity has basically lived up to it's social, economic and environmental promises of doom. James Halliday (a reclusive legend who is equal parts Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Mark Zuckerberg) has died, leaving his vast fortune, as well as control of OASIS (his fully-immersible virtual reality based role-playing, gaming, social networking environment), to whomever solves his puzzles and wins his final game.<br /><br />Halliday is a self-professed 80s freak, and his final manifesto is riddled with clues relating to his pop-culture obsession. In fact, the video of his last-will-and-testament is set to the tune of Oingo Boingo's Dead Man's Party, and populated by virtual mourners digitally extracted from the John Hughes films of his (and, incidentally, my own) youth. If the gunters (the good guys) and the sixers (the bad guys) are to have any hope of finding the final Easter egg hidden in OASIS, they're going to need to be experts in the movies, television shows, cartoons, video games, and toys of that lost decade.<br /><br />What follows is a well-written, remarkably well-paced read, gleefully propelled along by the self-awareness of its own novelty. Wade and company have to play their way through old text-based Tandy adventures, Atari console games, and stand-up arcade classics. They're forced to role-play their way through movies like Wargames, with points won or lost for getting lines right, delivering them with the right tone/attitude, and completing all the movements. Best of all, they get to descend into musical geekdom, playing their way through the 'concept' behind Rush's masterpiece, 2112.<br /><br />Of course, 80s pop-culture nostalgia aside, this is still (at its heart) a book about a video game. Fortunately, the characters are strong, well-rounded, and engaging, with Aech and Art3mis nicely rounding out the Wade/Parzival trilogy of game players. The sixers are an army of largely faceless goons (think Stormtroopers), but their leader, Sorrento, is a suitably over-the-top villain, obsessed with winning the game and seizing control of OASIS for nothing more than corporate greed. While the plot had a definite dry spot in the middle, it still held my attention, keeping me reading right through the end.<br /><br />Had this been a story rooted in the nostalgia of any other decade, I doubt I would have found it half as enjoyable, but it must be said that Ernest does more than just pay lip service to the 80s. His love for pop-culture absolutely permeates the novel, guiding it, shaping it, and driving it, as opposed to just decorating it. All-in-all, a much better read than I anticipated . . . even if it has left me mourning my lost youth. :)s goons (think Stormtroopers), but their leader, Sorrento, is a suitably over-the-top villain, obsessed with winning the game and seizing control of OASIS for nothing more than corporate greed.

B00386EZJU|5.0|Rich elements of exciting bagpipes, surprising wind section and thunderous, rhythmic percussion is every bit as thrilling to listen to as the film is to watch.  Score sores with 'Romantic Flight' and laughs playfully with 'New Tail' and 'Astrid Goes For A Spin.'  Warms the imagination. Whole album may be long listen for the kiddies, but a piece or two at a time: very beautiful.

0061990477|2.0|I remember in the 80's the TV movie was a sensation. I did not watch it due to school.  However I was curious as to what made it so popular.  So I read the book. A third way in it was interesting, but then the story dragged.  So I switched to audio book version.  The story never got anywhere.  Events came and went, people grew up, got old. But no one you could really root for. The problem may be that the author spread the plots through three generations so they dilute any impact the story might have on the main characters, namely Ralph and Meggie.  With the hindsight of current abuse scandals involving priests, I could not help but feel uneasy about Ralph's early affections for Meggie, however innocent it may be.  Also, the lust that Mary (Meggie's aunt) had for Ralph seemed abnormal even judged by 21st century standard.  One cannot help but compare this to Gone With the Wind.  However, you do care for characters in GWTW, no matter if they were good, bad, meek or strong.  And you would keep looking forward to each new chapter.  I wish I could say the same for \\"The Thorn Birds.\\"
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I'm obsessed with this amazing album. I love her style, lyrics and voice. I don't understand why so much backlash is out there against this amazing and for once ORIGINAL artist.  Stunning album full of love and heartache set to a haunting unique breathy voice full of artistic beats and catchy pop hooks blended perfectly.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This cover works great.  Allows you to read without having to hold the reader in your hands.  It folds back to form a stand, and when you're not reading, it is a protective cover.  Also, for those of us who don't know when to stop reading, you don't have to worry about dropping your kindle should you doze off.
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|Have all of the other Thing movies. Can not wait to compare this movie to the other ones and then then tell others about it.

B005GUQIDC|5.0|Her voice and style is jus WOW! It's original in the sense that she is not being katie perry for example. It's almost like she has a jazz, old school feel! I haven't bought her CD yet, but I'm going to buy it this week when I get the chance.  She's also GORGEOUS ...  I hope to see more of her.

0451450523|5.0|Seriously one of the best of the quest-type fantasy books out there. It's a good length for a medium to short read, but it is condensed with many events and characters. The book has a gripping plot and feels like reading a classic fairy tale and a modern fantasy book at the same time. I'd recommend this for all ages and preferences of books.

B005HSG3TC|4.0|this product does just as it advertises.  the pictures/video helped me realize how to use the stand so that it doesn't need to be on a flat surface for the stand to work (great for reading in bed). Only down fall is the felt that is on the inside of the cover to keep from scratching the front of the kindle collects dog hair really well.  Not really a fault of the product more just an observation.
030746363X|5.0|I love this book.  Timothy Ferriss is such a great writer.  He's funny and sarcastic and makes you want to hear what he has to say.  I have not read the entire book, but that's the way it's written.  You only need to read the portion that pertains to the goal you are trying to reach.  I can't wait to set my next goal and read the next section.  And the program is so easy and doable.  I highly recommend this book.

The second.....maybe 4 stars. This one just seemed like it was nothing more than Katness rambling on and on and on. It was disappointing to me. I would only give this one 3 stars and feel like she could have done so much more with the last book.

B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|Purchased this CD for a gift.  Report to me is, \\"it's a great CD\\".  Arrived as stated, well packaged, no problems with purchase!!
B002BTYZEK|1.0|The movie's new cut was more watchable than the original.  BUT  As a reader of massive amounts of history I hate how the movie butchered the history and sequences of the actual event.  The two initial lynchings that so outraged people at the time are missing totally.  Instead we get people doing things they never did at times when they should already have been dead.  We get a mis-mash of poorly handled gun fights in an out of sequence manner.  The invented gun fight where the various people surround the gun men is so badly handled it is silly to watch.  The actual seige of the gunmen by the sheriff's posse of 200 men is ignored in favor of a silly circular wagon fight where the settlers are symbolic indians.  Characters and their basic motives and history are misrepresented in so many instances that it is pointless to note them all.  Beautifully photographed and as a child of people who actually lived through that era IN Wyoming that is the only redeeming thing about the picture.  The scenery is not enough to rescue this child of the 60s movie.  The result is the triangle shirt waist gang versus the bad guys and that is not what happened.  I bought it but can't stand to watch it again.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is alright. mainly just leavinng  the review to receive the points. alright for passing the time. alright not addicting though
B0064NTZJO|5.0|There is something so original about this movie, I couldn't stop thinking about it after I watched it. The story, the music, the acting and suspense was all there. I love this movie so much I bought it the next day after renting it. After you watch it you get such a calming feeling do due the excellent acting from Ryan aka The Driver. If you haven't seen it yet, you will know what I'm talking about after you see it. Worth every penny!!!
0062082353|5.0|Chris Kyle and the rest of our elite special forces are true warriors and american heros. The silent few that do so much to protect us. This book was fantastic and I read it in 3 days which is pretty fast for me to read a 300+ page book. The book makes you feel like your right there at times.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a great game for anyone that likes to play solitaire. I highly recommend it. I can mindlessly play it for hours.
B006W0QOF2|1.0|Drive did lots of things right-- Ryan Gosling was great, the scenes and the cinematography were great, but the story completely lacked a coherent point or end or beginning.  The bad prison men made the husband get the money, no wait, the bad ex-producer's  silly sidekick made the husband get the money from a pawnshop, no wait from some east coast money, no wait from the mafia.  Then the sidekick (who just happens to be related to both sides of the robbery) then tricked everyone because he didn't want anyone to finger him for stealing from the mob.  Oh wait, he would have had to kill all those people who knew or the mob would have figured it out anyway.  Somehow he and his partner the ex-producer were so surprised by this fact. So Ryan Gosling kills everyone that the ex-producer and his silly sidekick didn't kill so that no one will know that he or the love interest were involved.  THEN HE LEAVES THE MILLION BUCKS after he was stabbed in the gut.  So now he leaves the chick with a kid, no husband and no money and he doesn't come back to help her either. And he drives till he dies (maybe-- no clear ending). So I paid for this movie why?  I was bored, no wait, the mob made me do it, no wait, I am only a stuntman in my spare time. Ultimately, you get the feel that the point of this movie was left on the editing room floor.
0439023513|1.0|This 3rd book in such an intense and addictive series was a major disappointment for me. During the last chunk of Mockingjay, the book feels confusing and incomplete to the reader. The author changes the way she writes and situations lack explanation all the while Katniss changes her (previously very strong) character traits and becomes someone readers don't recognize. Where did the strong, courageous and loyal character go? All I can say is that when I closed the book, I felt cheated and it seems to me that the author deprived readers of explanations and expectations-- and not in a good way. Did Ms Collins go through some major life change or have a strict deadline that she had to meet, in turn rushing Mockingjay???  I understand some readers' explanation that this book is about war and not a romance, but the previous books led the reader to believe it was both. In this book, the author created more questions than answered and focused too much on Katniss's emotional issues than finalizing the plot.  Sigh. I hope they change the ending in the movie. But I LOVED the other two books.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Ready Player One is one of the most riveting books I've devoured in the past year. Reminiscent of Willie Wonka if he conjured computer code instead of candy confections, this thrill ride of a tale showed how dreams could come true against the odds even in a dystopian future. Plus the 80's pop culture references delighted me to no end. Great pacing, messages and character development - Ernest Cline, you're cooler than Ferris Bueller!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the mobility and the smooth flow of this game . Well done! This is a great relaxer in the down time, while waiting. We all do a lot of waiting.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i bought this game because i wanted to find something i can play on the bus. i was pleasently surprised when i saw the variety of games. it's super addicting and hard to put down.
B0045HCJKS|5.0|How can you go wrong with a movie starring the great Yul Brynner; but to top it all off Westworld just happens to be a classic  Science Fiction movie without green men, creatures and ray guns,
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I highly recommend this series and the corresponding books to anyone who isn't bothered by graphic sex and violence.  I am eagerly awaiting the future seasons.
0470876417|5.0|I really recommend this book. It's very easy to read and the examples adds a very complete approach to understand the canvas model. For us who we loves the strategic area of the business administration it's really refreshing to find something new and current.
B0015AARJI|3.0|The controller works fine, the way it is supposed to.  I am upset however it did not come with the cable to connect and charge with.  I didn't see that info when I was ordering.  Of course they want more money from you to buy it separate.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|It ain't deep or break through, but this is a collection of kick ass tunes.<br /><br />Don't overthink it, just jam along.
B006QS0PF0|5.0|Portia de Rossi's book was amazing!  There are very few individuals (actors at that!) who are willing to expose their very personal struggles.  This book took courage to write, and I commend her for that.  It, I am sure, will also be an inspiring story for all of those struggling with excessive weight loss - trying to maintain America's \\"perfect\\" physique, which is anything but perfect.
B006O5Y0SS|5.0|I'm not a huge Woody Allen fan. Some of his movies I enjoy and some I'm left just scratching my head, but this has restored my faith in the man. I found this movie to be a great escape. It really draws you in. Great acting, great scenery. Very enchanting.
B00631VJLE|5.0|This is, as a whole, the best Lacuna Coil album I've heard. Buy it without hesitation. The cover of REM's \\"Losing My Religion\\" is better than the original. Their music resonates with my soul so perfectly. Cristina is the hottest woman in the world, thanx Italy. As a guitarist, I love the Lacuna Coil guitar pick that came with this box.
B004D7GU3C|5.0|I love this CD/ Ricky Martin is back and the sound is great. I love his music. In this CD he goes through a range of music which he has always been good at.
B000PKX2KA|4.0|Product lived up to its expectations.  Would have preferred a little more detail in the setup instructions, especially in larger print, but overall well worth the cost.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This.is ling lasting, fun, and is great. But I installed all the new boxes, and they havent updated it yet.
B003AWRMCE|4.0|Not much to add that other positive reviewers haven't already said. If you are still on the fence about this one after working your way through this many reviews, just trust the Academy Awards.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love having a bible that doesn't require physical space, and incorporates search functions, downloadable translations, and daily bible reading plans to help keep me reading the Bible and Godly minded.  Thanks for a great app greatly executed.
B005OK722U|5.0|this was a great movie and i recieved it on time and undamaged. i was very happy.i h been waiting for this movie to come out for some time and when i saw it . it was well worth it. its a movie id definately reconmend to my friends who like scary movies.
B002VPE1WK|3.0|This bag makes sense only if you are a small frame person going on a rigorous hiking expedition once or twice. Let me explain ... The design of the bag is way too busy with waist strap and chest strap designed to secure bag to your body. Problem is unless you are a small person, the chest strap is too short to the point of being useless.  Second, the waist strap with its padding is fairly large and cumbersome and gets in the way. Unless you are going to use it regularly for hiking purposes, it just gets in the way.  I cut off both the chest and the waist straps and now I actually like the bag little better.  I use the handle on the top of the bag a lot on my other bags and on this bag, the handle seems very flimsy and question its ability to hold up over long haul.  Hence the crack about taking this bag only once or twice for the hiking expedition.<br /><br />It has lots of pockets and slots internally but they are all fairly large.  I would have liked more smaller pockets to keep small items like memory cards and batteries secure and separate. There are two small pockets externally on the side with flaps secured by velcro; I would have preferred zippered pockets here.  The side strap, presumably for tripod is marginally useful for small, light tripod.  The inside lining where the velcro dividers attach is weakly constructed as the lining walls are not reinforced with additional stitching and the back/bottom of the bag does not have velcro covering.  Therefore, the dividers only attach to the side walls and not the back wall, making them less secure. Overall construction and material quality is marginal at best reflecting its low price. The appearance of the bag does not scream expensive either, potentially lowering the risk of theft and adding to the adage, hiding in plain sight.<br /><br />I love Amazon, just not this bag. I bought this bag because of overwhelming positive reviews. In hindsight, I would spend a little more and get one from Lowepro or Tamrac.
0439023521|5.0|I finally got into the Hunger Games craze and I got hooked.  I absolutely loved it!  I totally recommend it.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|All I wanted was to finish my harry potter movie collection so I bought this regardless of the terrible ultraviolet reviews. I just wanted the harry potter 7 part 2 dvd at a really good price, and thats exactly what I got. I don't really care about the ultraviolet version as long as I have an actually DVD disc that I can play in a dvd player or laptop computer, which is what I got when I ordered this. So I don't know why everyone is complaining so much about the ultraviolet version, as long as you get a DVD then whats the big deal? And its really cheap!
B005HSL626|4.0|game rocks works so perfect love it ninja that cuts fruit game is awesome can't wait till fruit ninjas 2
B006B31B80|5.0|This show is better than 3 star rating it currently has...It's a good show. You can't have zombies running around like crazy every episode. It'd get old guys.
B004ZJZQBK|3.0|Movie was enjoyable but I had to watch the DVD as the bluray was incompatible with my jvc xv-bp11. I do have the latest firmware and it is the only disc I have been yet unable to play. I buy region free blurays from the uk all the time without problem.The 3 star is for the movie as I never downgrade for shipping or service.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|Having heard so much about this series, I took the plunge to view season one and try to catch up before season 2, part 2 debuts.  It was worth the wait, as this series is not just \\"another\\" zombie series.  It is well written, well directed and pretty well acted as well.  My only pet peeve is that we really don't know how humanity perished and it is odd to see abandoned military vehicles and installations.  What happened to the soldiers!?  Minor quibbles aside, this is a first rate series and harkens us back to George Romero's zombies.  I only hope the series can maintain its momentum.  If you are even slightly interested in a zombie apocalypse, and more importantly, how the survivors manage amongst themselves, this is a series for you.
B00005JKGK|5.0|I've been looking for this movie, at last I owned it now on DVD.<br />I received this today.  Right now I'm watching it here in my PC.<br />And later when I get home , I'll play this on my player. Watch it all over again.
B00650SSWG|5.0|The movie was rented laying around the house so I thought I'd watch it after hearing about it.  I watched it & I liked it! LOL The movie is perfect for todays day and age doing a good job of representing the promiscuous times of today.  Unlike the past where you would be your wifes 1st, 3rd or even 5th partner we live in age where people get together casually.  This has its pros & cons which the movie does a perfect job of capturing, leaning more to the idea of love & finding that special someone.  With scattered parts of comedy & drama this movie touches on so many subjects gracefully.
B005OSUKSA|5.0|If you like classical music, and if you like to hear classical music performed with incredible talent, you should buy this CD.  Friends from Germany introduced me to David Garret nearly 3 years ago, by mailing me a CD.  The CD cover showed a handsome young guy, holding a violin.  I thought, \\"Oh dear.\\"  While I like and appreciate all music (except rap, which isn't music), classical was not always necessarily at the top of my list.  So imagine my surprise when the first song on the CD turned out to be a kick-butt version of Michael Jackson's \\"Smooth Criminal.\\"  I was driving at the time, rocking out to such amazing music.  A minute or so into the next song, I had to pull over.  It was \\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\" (which I later learned was made famous by Metallica), and is so beautiful that it brought tears to my eyes.  Since then, David brought out another mostly rock-themed CD, \\"Rock Symphonies,\\" which I highly recommend.  Imagine a violin with the range, nuance and emotion of a human voice.  Amazing.  I've been fortunate enough to have seen David Garrett in concert twice (in Reno in 2010, and in Sacramento in 2011), and he continues to amaze.  Aside from the fact that he is drop-dead gorgeous, he's the most talented musician I've ever heard.  (Oh, and my German friends are a little jealous because they've been trying to see him in Europe for a few years, where he is a HUGE deal, but have been unable to get tickets -- they sell out almost instantly, plus the tickets are three- to six-hundred Euros per.)  \\"Legacy\\" is pure classical.  No rock infusions.  And it's absolutely beautiful.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I finally got the chance to read The Hunger Games and I have to say that I agree with the majority of reviewers. The book is an excellent read. It is very fast-paced, at times very vrutal, and engaging throughout. I would recommend this book to most readers.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|decently fun game. fills the time when your bored and nothings really going on. also highly addictive. one two three four five six seven
B0063GORYU|5.0|my favorite game. great for keeping your mind engaged. strategic and fun. don't have to have tons of time and is a good game for those times that you are kept waiting for an appointment.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun game but it gets harder to unlock games the further you get. You have to replay games a lot to get enough points to unlock another one, especially if you beat the new game on the first try.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app should be num ber one of free apps oh yeah it. rocks and everyone should be able to play
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote on my kindle fire, galaxy, and macbook. Seamless sync between them all so that I never skip a beat. Never any issues, I highly recommend it.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|This is my second paid of Ear Force Headphones. I had the wired pair originally. They worked well and I enjoyed them, but they had one design defect - they didnt hold up to being slammed in a moment of rage on MW3 lol.  I decided to step it up and purchase the X41s. I have not been disappointed in the least. These headphones are great. Setup was a little tricky, since you have the set up the receiver. Still, in less than 10 minutes I was up and playing. The sound and quality is simply amazing. On more than one occasion I have actually turned my head looking to see if what I heard was on the game or not. For MW3 players, my K/D has actually jumped .45 since switching to these. You just hear so much more than with the other headphones. It takes a few games to adjust to how much you can actually hear. More than once I have turned to shoot an enemy flanking me, only to find out it was a teammate hundreds of yards away.  The features on these headphones are nice. There is a bass boom that is easy to toggle on and off. Chat volume is seperate from sound volume. Chat comes through the headphones without affecting the sound, which is important, because you can still hear your surroundings over the chat. In addition, the mike can be unplugged from the headphones quickly if you dont like having a mike attached.  There are a few small issues I must mention, though they dont affect the overall quality of the product enough to take away a star. First of all, because it is wireless, there tends to be some interfernece occasionally. Mine mostly comes from my cell when I surf the net on it between maps. There also tends to be occasional popping, mostly when I move more than 30+ feet away (like going to the kitchen to grab a drink). I have my xbox connected wirelessly to the internet, yet I have not noticed any issues despite the fact my receiver is about 6 inches from my xbox. Also, in case you were wondering, when using these headphones to chat, you still have a wire running to your controller. Maybe in the furture they can make this portion wireless, but for now this is what we have to work with. The cord plugs into both the controller and the headphones with ease. However, a few times I have had to remove and replug because it didnt make contact correctly. Typically just pushing the contacts in firmly will do the trick.  In the end, I am pleased with the headphones. The quality is amazing. The product is solid. The price is a little steep compared to other headphones on the market, but you get what you pay for with these headphones.
B000G6R7B8|5.0|The watch, Seiko SNK808K2 is a very good watch.  I had to return the watch and got great service from Amazon.  The only thing about the watch was that it is not for diving over 600ft.  The return service went by the book, GREAT.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I'm a pastor. I looked at and tried several Bible apps. Not only do I constantly recommend it to others, I use it myself. All of the features work great. And, I enjoy access to all the different translations. Kudos to LifeChurch.tv.
B005TQACLC|1.0|Where do I begin with this concert Blu-ray/DVD? You know when you're left with questions after watching a concert Blu-ray/DVD that it's a failure all around. That's the only way to describe this travesty. Was there even a point of putting it on Blu-ray? Because you'd have to be both high and deaf to enjoy it? I'll never know.<br /><br />Ok let's get down to it. The obvious being the lip-syncing. Why ignore the elephant in the room? I know this is pretty standard for Britney because she's done it her entire career but why did she make the decision to have her pre-recorded, or \\"live\\" vocals dubbed over? She would've gotten some credibility as people would believe she was singing live. And yes, it was Britney's decision, Epix released a statement stating that it was up to the artist. It begs the question as to why she'd want that. What's the point of being a singer if you don't like your voice or you don't want others to hear it? Why do fans have to fight tooth and nail just to hear you live? It's not like your albums aren't edited enough to where you sound robotic and unnatural. You're better of waiting for the demos and stems to leak. What adds insult to injury are the 30 seconds in total, performances with Sabi and Nicki Minaj which had more live singing than from Britney and it was her concert/tour. Also, does Britney and her team think we're stupid? They dubbed over 'Baby One More Time' and 'Slave 4 u' with the album vocals, you're talking vocals from albums that are over a decade old. I give up.<br /><br />The dancing, more like what dancing? Whipping your hair isn't dancing, Willow Smith does that and still sings live. \\"arm dancing\\" isn't dancing either. I used to be able to defend Britney and say \\"she dances really hard and therefore it's ok if she lip-syncs\\". These days she does neither. I gave her a major break during Circus because it was her first tour in 5 years and she went through a lot leading up to it. I've run out of excuses and can't and won't defendthis.<br /><br />Epix and team Britney really dropped the ball as well. The cover, really? That took a lot of consideration to use the album cover. I hope they didn't think too hard with that decision. The image on the disc itself was much better. When you go to the menu and hit \\"song selection\\" they messed up a few song titles as well. It's 'Lace and Leather' not 'Leather and Lace', it's also 'Trouble For Me' not 'Trouble'. Did they not pay any attention at all? There's parts where they pan to the audience and it looks pixelated and choppy. And what's with the image on the back cover, the top left B&W photo? That looks like a photo backstage, prayer circle before the show perhaps? That's not on the Blu-ray/DVD or part of the show. Is that an indication that there was extras to be included originally?<br /><br />In short, like I said, there's questions, and there shouldn't be while watching a concert. In my opinion, the only thing that was done correctly and would make it worthwhile are the Music Videos for each single released. And even that's not on the DVD. If you don't have Blu-ray you're screwed. What I gathered from this? Britney doesn't want to do this anymore and her team hates us all. Don't be the last to know....that this is a waste of time and money.
B0073LWEXK|1.0|the worst game I have. couldn't find any of the objects. they were so small! I had to rub my hand on the screen and got lucky. wouldn't regimens it.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I wanted to see what the 1st season was all about, So I ordered it, then I had to order the 2nd season.  Got totally addicted to this. I don't watch much tv but I really enjoyed this series. Can't wait for season 3.
B004SBQAN8|1.0|Good Lord! What is going on in this world when this \\"Twilight\\" Sci-Fi drama can pass for entertainment? I mean this film makes the Twilight series almost seem watch-able. I really wanted to like this film, as the premise sounded interesting, but after only minutes I could see what franchise audience this film was after and it certainly wasn't mine. It's just a terrible film on all levels, even as an adolescent coming of age movie with puppy love romance, it just fails. Horrible and a complete waste of time.
B002WJI63A|1.0|Definitely not worth the $19.+ I was charged for it.........face is cute, but the doll's hair looks like a misplaced backpack in the back......bought this as a birthday gift for my granddaughter........if she didn't want it so badly, I would have probably returned it.

B001YYQ9SS|4.0|The story is let say zero and I don`t care becouse I can see one of the most awesomes fights in movies histories.I remember slowing down some action scenes becouse they were to fast :D.The video quality and graphics are amazing and it onnly makes me want more and more remake of FF7 on ps3 just imagine this game in FF13 engine it would be beast.I saw this movie as a kid and it was the most awesome thing i showed to man friens and they were all amezed.So in conclusion this movie is more entertaining than all last FF games becouse you don`t have to watch freaking sope opera for 40 hours which I think is why FF lost it`s juggernaut name in gaming industry becouse in all current FF games you just play for weeping kids which puts away a lot of players just imagine imagine how would be cool to have FF game in the style of Vampire Hunter D or something similar I mean the artist from this movie works on FF13-2 which such a bad and boring main character.A lot of people sad that they would play the game becouse the gampley is improved but these character and styte puts of so many people just like at FF13-2 Japan the sales are so poor compered to 13 sales which I thing atleast have dude with a beard :D.  Sorry for the worst english grammar on the internet.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|pretty good, games are kind of difficult though. still fun, good time killer, but games are tiring after a while. have to play and beat.games to unlock others.
B005ZKYXZI|4.0|It would have been so much better without that annoying kid.It could have been little bit more serious.You will know all the plot after five minutes which is found in almost all popcorn movies.  Now about the good parts.Fights are entertaining,effects are very good and I liked  Hugh Jackman performence and would like too see him in a more serious films.  Bad grammar as allways :)

B004I744AS|5.0|I didn't find the free dictionary that came with my Kindle Fire easy to use so decided to try this one. After using it for about a week, I'm 100% satisfied and surprised that I got it for such a low price!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Gameplay works great and I really enjoy playing on my kindle fire! No freezes or errors that I have found. Crisp, clear images.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Yes!  Fire Maple Games is back with a follow-up to the excellent Grisly Manor, probably my favorite mobile game to date.  I love the Myst-lite puzzle-solving gameplay, and honestly, if they put out a new edition every quarter, I'd buy it without hesitation.  Lost City is a marked improvement over Grisly Manor.  Animations in the environment, a longer quest, and new map and hint features make this a more polished, frustration-free experience.  Loved it.

0553805371|4.0|Hawking is one of those geniuses who can occasionally come down to earth and speak to those of us who are less intellectually gifted and help us to understand complicated things. I really learned a lot of basic stuff from this book. Note that it is not for the more advanced: it is a real basic, \\"Quantum Physics and the Universe for Dummies\\" kind of book. Short, easy to comprehend and with great pictures to enhance one's understanding of the material presented. Hawking makes a few statements that I consider odd--no, not the one about the universe not needing any gods to get started, I am totally in agreement with that--but his matter-of-fact statement, right out of the gate, that philosophy is dead. Really? I studied it a bit at university and felt that it still has something to say to us. But whatever; if Hawking wants to pound nails into philosophy's coffin, in my opinion way prematurely, well then let him. Suffice to say that if you want to know a little about quantum theory and how it relates to the origins of our universe but you aren't in a position to quit your job and study this 18 hours a day for years (which is probably what it would take to REALLY get this stuff down), this short little book will make you feel smarter after you've read it, and won't give you a migraine trying to understand the material.
B005HSG3U6|2.0|I ordered this thinking it would be great. It isn't, doesn't stand up as it should ,falls over because the groove that the flap  is suppose to fit into isn't deep enough.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|love this game! play it all the time. my son is thirteen and he plays it every chance he gets.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it gives you what you ask for, but it isn't worth all the hyper, in my eyes. there are some good and bad games and the layout isn't the best choice, but for a free game, it gives exactly what you see. it can be very fun though, give it a try.
0439023521|5.0|Finished this in a day...on to Catching Fire...cannot remember the last time I could NOT put a book down, much less started right in on the next one!  Compelling, flawed characters and a plot that stands on its own merits, but...allegorical commentary if you choose to go that direction. Amazing read!  LOVING the quick delivery via Kindle, too!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|To many downloading issues. This device sucks. Do not buy this product. You can't even order a book. But the credit card info never malfunctions
B005HSG3TC|5.0|It does its job and its light weight. Nothing to complain about except maybe price. but all pad covers are over priced so it doesnt matter.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is really fun and there are games that are a little frustrating but it makes it even better because you get addicted
B0063GORYU|5.0|love playing spider solitair.the game is challanging at times. the cards move easily. the pop up ads before each game are. a pain, but easily gotten rid of.
B0058YPG1G|4.0|I don't know what to think of this series. I am definitely hooked and can't wait for the next DVD set. But Jessie's decline is disturbing and so is that of Skyler. It's getting harder to like these characters or to see any redeeming qualities in them. I am trying to avoid any spoilers for Season 4, although NPR did wreck it for me with an interview with Aaron Paul re: his killing of Gayle. Still an incredible show for the interplay between Walt and Jessie. The best \\"odd couple\\" to come on TV in a long time.
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|Loved it until I bought the full version, now when I play my phone (Samsung Epic 4g) freezes up!!!  Sent email with the problem and never heard back!
1455510319|4.0|Connolly is keeping the pace going with Mickey Haller and co. This one had a predictable ending, but still engrossing although I missed Harry Bosch.
B005K15SPG|5.0|Last year I was the only one of my friends who had ever heard of this band. Now everyone I know LOVES them. This CD was a major part of a really hard year. Soooo good!
B006W0QOF2|5.0|I really just had to contribute to rectifying the problem of this not getting more overall stars. I saw it in the theater and purchased it in every format. Gosling has never been hotter, he's so sexy in a quiet mysterious way, and then in a sweet protective way, and then he goes a little psycho so you wonder if you want to get out of his way, but no, the hotness is too strong. The cast is great, the music is so weird and perfect, and the director keeps churning out great films. I'd recommend \\"Bronson\\" by him, while it's very violent, it's got similar music and is very creative. Gosling is superb in every film I've seen him in, which is almost all of them, there's nothing he can't play. His album \\"Dead Man's Bones\\" is great too, he can sing! He can do ballet! Really, is there anything he can't do?

B005LAIGOQ|5.0|What a cheering prospect: two great institutions of British supernatural cinema making a good show of not being stone dead after all.<br /><br />Latterly consensus had it that Hammer Film Productions, having introduced the post war generation to spanky gothic horror, was a long time deceased, wiped off the map thirty years ago by the Americans and their ghastly slasher franchises ([[ASIN:B000RIWAVW Halloween]], [[ASIN:B005D7E80S Friday the 13th]], [[ASIN:B0058N2T3K Nightmare On Elm Street]]), which left nothing to the imagination, and nary a haunted cupboard for poor old Hammer to hide in.<br /><br />Hammer's was always a distinctly British pleasure: campy gothic mansions, busty English virgins floundering wantonly at the hands of glowering gentlemen vampires and tension ratcheted by a heady collection of instantly recognisable tropes: bumps in the night, creaking staircases, candlesticks, quavering gas lamps and pale, cassocked children with faraway stares wandering menacingly in and out of the frame, all girdled with a patina of sauciness.<br /><br />An increasingly thick patina as the years wore on: Just as Freddy Kruger was firing up the chainsaws and breaking out the hockey mask, Hammer was tipping into Carry-On territory. I don't think Syd James appeared in a Hammer horror, but he convincingly [[ASIN:B003XF1V0W spoofed one]], and you fancy he might have turned in a memorably lecherous Van Helsing had the dice rolled differently. Not long afterward, Hammer folded.<br /><br />All the same, Hammer remains a grand if not exactly solemn pilaster on the frontage of Britain's cinema history. There's an argument (which I may have just invented) that even [[ASIN:B003ZSJ212 Star Wars]] owes a debt to Hammer: Princess Leia, Darth Vader and Grand Moff Tarkin are archetypes which may as well have been lifted straight out of the Hammer playbook. David Prowse, Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing were longstanding Hammer alumni.<br /><br />Thirty years or so later, it seems, like its own ghoulish progeny, that Hammer cannot die. Indeed, it seems in rude health, if its new production The Woman In Black is anything to go by.<br /><br />The film delivers all the old Hammer features in spades. And candles, self-rocking chairs, overgrown moonlit graveyards and macabre clockwork dolls. If I had to point up a reservation, I would say it was short a fruity Susannah York in a rippable bodice - but otherwise it nails the Hammer idiom for the twenty-first century.<br /><br />Effective and (mostly) discrete employment of CGI bestows the Woman in Black a gorgeous, stylish look, and the production design is magnificent, from the dark panelled offices from which struggling articled clerk Arthur Kipps is dispatched to the provinces, Jonathan Harker-style, to sort out the papers of a deceased lady's estate, to the majestic tidal sweep out to her mansion perched on a rock resembling St. Michael's Mount and as joyously gothic as any haunted house you'll ever see.<br /><br />Now I mentioned the continued prosperity of two great British cinematic institutions: the other, of course, is the beloved boy wizard Daniel Radcliffe, played to such memorable effect in the eponymous film franchise by young Harry Potter.<br /><br />Few film fans haven't fretted about Potter's chances of escaping the Radcliffe typecast. It is a weighty burden indeed to have played such a definitive character so early in one's career. These first post-Radcliffe films are a make or break for Potter's prospects of cinematic longevity.<br /><br />In that regard, The Woman In Black is both a good and a bad choice.<br /><br />Bad in that, being set in an up-country Gothic pile and having a supernatural context, it is hard not to read in some of the Hogwarts idiom: that Arthur Kipps reaches it aboard a steam train from King's Cross seems almost intentionally referential.<br /><br />Good, though, in that the Hammer style relies for its impact mostly on its direction, staging, lighting, editing,sound and production design: almost anything but acting. The film requires little of its lead: if anything, more is asked of the supporting characters. They must (and, thanks to nicely understated performances from Ciar&aacute;n Hinds, Shaun Dooley and Roger Allam, do) project a discomfiting weirdness on proceedings. The unwilling hero, Arthur Kipps, must instead be a blank canvas. We are expected to project ourselves on to Kipps: that's how we become caught up in the suspense. Potter's admirably colourless performance is pitch-perfect in this regard - faint praise, I dare say - but if he is to lose the Radcliffe tag, this is the way to do it. In fairness to the young wizard, for large parts of the screenplay he is the only character on screen: there are only so many acting chops you can show off by creeping along an empty corridor.<br /><br />There is, of course, one character trait Kipps must have that his audience lacks: a complete lack of judgment upon encountering eerie phenomena.<br /><br />Say you're alone, marooned by tidal mudflats, in the grounds of a deserted Gothic mansion and armed with only a box of matches and a cocker spaniel. Dusk is falling, and from nowhere a vigorous clanking starts up in the upper part of the house. Popping outside to investigate, you catch a ghostly face at a top floor window out of the corner of your eye. You must not, as would a prudent audience member after the merest moment's consideration, make at once to the shore and start swimming for your life. You must instead take your box of matches and investigate, to the accompaniment of loud, discordant incidental music, even though you ought to know your matches will surely fail. The idiom requires it.<br /><br />This makes for a superbly thrilling visual experience. No matter how transparent the director's intention, it is impossible not to be caught up. There were, at my preview screening, professional film critics watching through their fingers. If there had been sofas they would have been leapt behind. A boy of 14, who had been a bit cocky as the film opened, migrated to his father's knee and buried his face in the man's neck.<br /><br />Kipps approaches a peephole and looks in. The entire theatre knows exactly what is coming next: a ghoulish face will flash close-up and an explosive scream will jolt the theatre. But when it comes you still jump out of your skin. This is fully exhilarating. The tension and release is orchestrated expertly by director: it is a very, very, good piece of film making.<br /><br />The ending is unusual and, I thought, a little flat, but on reflection I thought it deftly handled, though exactly how I don't feel able to say.<br /><br />So how to grade The Woman In Black, then? It is expertly edited, framed, lit and directed. It is fully cognisant of its own pedigree, of which it sees the funny side. It does feel short a vulnerable fruity maiden or two. But by comparison with Rebecca Hall and Dominic West's recent The Awakening]] - in concept a very similar film - it is vastly superior. It is no Citizen Kane, but nor is it trying to be. That is not a sensible standard to hold it against.

B0073LWEXK|4.0|great app. worked perfectly, and its very fun. the reason i gave it 4 stars because maybe its a little TOO fun. very addicting, i finished it in one night, and the statues really creeped me out &lt;:(
B002WIDRM6|5.0|This CD holds no surprises, the title song is excellent and the rest of the songs are also easy listening.
B006E4QCXU|4.0|I love it. it is fun and boring at the same time. :)  .p.s. get it. get it. get it. get it.  :)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the game was fun at first. but later, ut began getting harder and harder to progress the game. it no longer became fun
B0069UP2PI|2.0|Everyone has already brought up the star power of this movie so there's no point in mentioning it again, but what I will say is that it doesn't hold a candle to \\"Outbreak,\\" a similar movie with a similarly impressive cast.<br /><br />\\"Contagion\\" lacks any sort of a clear story line and becomes more of a playbook for the government if a virus were to spread across the country.  Every major plot point occurs extremely abruptly and when the movie is suddenly over, you'll be left with more questions than answers.<br /><br />This isn't to say \\"Contagion\\" is a terrible movie, it just had the potential to be so much better than it is.  It is a rental at best.
B003YL4KS0|2.0|I think the title of the review says it all.  I didn't notice the box under the product photo that states that the video content is only available on iphones, ipads and ipods.  Bummer!

B005H29GSI|2.0|We got this game for the kids (9,7,5) for Christams.  While it looks ok, it is slow to play and the slingshot is difficult for kids to use.  They tried it a couple times, usually when a friend sees it, and now it collects dust on the shelf.  Stick with the original!
B005K17RU0|4.0|would have given five stars but had trouble getting it to change to my city and stay there on the map. figured it out and now works well.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app works great. It is easy to search and handle and is very good for the ones not too familiar with the traditional bible in book version.
B002BWP49M|5.0|This isn't a review of the actual movie, but of the blu-ray. I spoke with customer service and this edition DOES NOT HAVE ANY OF THE SPECIAL FEATURES.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love using this simple app; it is so convenient and great for Bible study. Its got all the essentials and works beautifully.
0553381695|4.0|This book is written with such fluidity from the fist that it doesn't feel like a second book but as if it was split for no reason but that the size was risking the book to be unsellable.  What can I say more than that it's awesome, long but worth it.  I enjoyed it more than the first simply because I hadn't seen this on TV as it's not been made into a TV series yet.  The characters are interesting and the addition of new once added to the story.  I really enjoying inclusion of more magic in this one.  As with the first my complaint is about the Kindle version and that the maps are too small to see properly and I can't easily access the index of families in the end (at least I can't find how to do it).  Although, again - it's hardly the fault of the writer.  I am putting off starting the 3rd as from what I can understand from others that have read all the books - the 3rd is the last good one in the series.

0765350386|5.0|First in the Mistborn fantasy series.<br /><br />My Take<br />It's a corrupt world with a small group at the top cruelly oppressing the majority; its leader seemingly a God. But Hope is not something that can be killed.<br /><br />Oh. My. God. This was incredible! A small cast of characters for such an epic and I could not put the book down. Tension, drama, incredibly diverse characters all fighting in the common struggle of power versus decency.<br /><br />It took a while before I understood what the chapter intros were about. Do read these. It is essential for understanding events in the story at the end. Sanderson is very subtle about the hints and indicators he provides in an attempt to prepare you for the ending. He really does an amazing job of providing mysteries that he just keeps dragging out even as he provides us with lots of action.<br /><br />You do have to wonder along with Vin what the Lord Ruler meant at the end. There has to be something that keeps the ash falling. The mist had to come from somewhere. Where does this power of Allomancy come from? Does it have to do with the mist? Is the mist a by-product of the ash spewn by the mountains? What about the atium? How does it relate to the mist or the Allomancy?<br /><br />Kelsier is ruthless in eliminating anyone in his way or who could be more useful dead for the cause. But it's a practical efficiency. He also devotes himself to teaching Vin about using her Allomanical gifts.<br /><br />The Story<br />Vin is a child of the streets, abandoned by everyone she has ever known. Her brother Reen taught her with beatings to draw away from attention, to survive. That she will always be betrayed. And so her life goes until the day she meets Kelsier, a Mistborn. He was the best crew leader until he and his wife Mare were betrayed while on their greatest heist.<br /><br />Kelsier has believed that the woman he loved had betrayed him, yet, she too was enslaved in the atium mines until the day she was beaten to death for not delivering her quota. A quota she had given to Kelsier. That day he Snapped and vowed to avenge her death, to lead a rebellion to take down the Lord Ruler.<br /><br />That time is now. It has been two years since he escaped the Pits of Hathsin and he has roamed the countryside. Learning the people who are enslaved by their rulers. The leader of the rebellion, the one who took over from Kelsier's brother Marsh, Yeden has hired Kelsier to make the rebellion possible. The greatest caper ever if Kelsier can convince the men he trusts to plan this, to pull it off.<br /><br />An army of 10,000 men hidden from the soldiers, the Inquisitors, the Lord Ruler. Inflame the Great Houses into war. Disrupt the economy. Send the city garrison out on a wild goose chase. Remove the Lord Ruler.<br />It's a small group that plans this destruction of their world. None believes it to be possible. Yet, they will try. And ain't Lord Venture going to be surprised...<br /><br />The Characters<br />Kelsier \\"Kell\\", a.k.a., The Survivor of the Pits of Hathsin, later known as the Survivor of the Square, is a wanted man. The Lord Ruler wants to kill him for his thievery. The populace reveres him for escaping from the Pits of Hathsin. No one has ever lasted more than a few months let alone escape. He sees himself as a troublemaker. He is certainly interested in murdering nobles and then planting their bodies where it will cause the greatest disruption amongst House allies.<br /><br />Vin, a.k.a., Lady Valette, has a Gift of Luck. She and her half-brother Reen made good use of it to survive from city to city. To find a place for themselves in a thieving crew. Now Reen has run off and left her and she hoards this small gift to stay alive. Until she meets Kelsier and discovers the truth about her gift. Vin's task in the rebellion is to learn to use her myriad skills and attend parties and balls in Luthadel to spy on the nobles. A task at which she slowly learns of the nobles' viciousness.<br /><br />Dockson \\"Dox\\" is a runaway skaa from a plantation. His purpose in the rebellion is to organize space and supplies. Breeze Ladarian is a Smoother; he manipulates the emotions of others. Ham is a Thug and will handle security as well as train their army. Clubs Cladent is a Smoker; he will cloud the air and prevent the workings of their Gifts from being sensed by the authorities. Lord Renoux is a kandra, a sentient mistwraith who can replicate anything dead when they absorb their bodies. He poses as a weapons dealer and Vin poses as his niece providing her entr&eacute;e into society. Sazed is a Terrisman, a Keeper, bred to work as a Steward; his job is to coach Vin and protect her in her guise as a lady of a noble house. Keepers are a special breed of Terrisman whose sole purpose in life is to remember and pass the knowledge on to the next generation. Each Keeper tends to specialize in an area and Sazed's specialty is religions and languages.<br /><br />Yeden is the leader of the rebellion. He begins by distrusting everything about Kelsier. Marsh is Kelsier's brother, a Seeker, and the former leader of the rebellion. He dropped out when Kelsier was caught and sentenced to the Pits. He will infiltrate the Inquisitors and pass on their secrets.<br /><br />Obligators and Inquisitors utilize the Misting talents and maintain order for the Lord Ruler.

1451627289|1.0|As many writers age they lose the ability (or desire) to create - this book is a sure sign that this auther may be aging. He has copied the literary style of Stephen King down to a t.  Many small stories combined in one binder to create an image of a larger than life book.  Much like King's recent 11/22/63.  I must admit that Koontz can do it as well if not better than King.  I am waiting for Koontz to tell us a story like he used to.

I immediately opened the case and put the Blu-ray version in the player.  I still can't believe that it was done live.  This particular performance really brought the Phantom of the Opera to life.

0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay is the final book in the amazing Hunger Games trilogy and starts after Katniss was rescued by the rebels in the Quarter Quell games (Catching Fire).  She is now in District 13 where the rebels are headquartered and pressuring her to be the Mockingjay; the face of the rebellion.  It doesn't take long for Katniss to realize she is not out of danger yet.  In order to keep herself and her loved ones alive, she must now answer to those in charge of District 13 who are all too willing to resort to the same evil tactics and climate of control used by the Capitol to gain position in the war.  The Capitol is also still trying to silence her and the rebels and will kill anyone who stands in their way.  This was a great end to a fantastic series.  Although Mockingjay is very dark, Suzanne Collins managed to maintain the same feel throughout the trilogy while changing the style of the plot a little from the focus on the Games in the first novel to the struggle for Panem in the last one.  An amazing series; cannot recommend enough!

B00006I53S|4.0|I bought this lens a while back as a replacement to the stock 18-55 lens that came with my XT (and then T2I after).  When I took my family to San Diego for the first time it renewed my passion for photography.  I had bought a Digital Rebel XT back in 2006, but I kind of let it slide to the wayside for other hobbies.  When my oldest was finally old enough to take on vacations where she'd remember things we hopped in the car and took the drive to San Diego to go to Sea World, the SD Zoo and the beach.  I figured it was as good a time as any to give it another try, and hit up a friend who was a bit more enthusiastic and she loaned me her D series, and a few lenses (one of which was this one) to take with us so I had a bit more flexibility.  By the end of the trip I was hooked again.  The bug bit me.  Last summer I had decided to start buying new glass, and a new body, and remembered this lens fondly.  It's not going to be something you're going to use at professional events/photoshoot's, but it's a solid carry lens and replacement for the stock 18-55 lens.  The glass is pretty solid, and the 28-135 range is a good mix that gets you close enough for quick shots, and long enough that you have a little bit of flexibility.  We use it as our go to \\"toss it on\\" lens all the time with our T2I.  PRO'S:  - Solid glass  - Sturdy construction  - Good mix for a carry lens (18-135)  - Image Stabilization (Yes, pretty standard)  - Fast Focus  - Solid image quality  CON'S:  - Heavy  - Lens Creep  - Possibly a little pricey for the overall  The only real con is that it's a heavy lens, and because of the design you can get some lens creep.  Carrying it around on your shoulder you'll find the lens extended every time you grab it.  Not a big deal, but worth mentioning.  The same can also apply to still shots depending on the angle.  I've had it creep a bit when I'd focus it, and let go of the lens for whatever reason and a combination of weight/design cause it to slide a bit.  Easy fix is just hold onto it.  When you're taking your picture to be safe hold onto the lens so it doesn't creep.  If you can't there are plenty of little things you can do to minimize the creep.  Overall I would rate the lens 4.5/5 but since I can't do a half star I'm going to give it 4/5 for the creep/weight.  I still highly recommend it as a transition from the stock lens into something a bit more multi-purpose.

B00005PJ8O|5.0|George Scott`s acting is superb. It`s so convincing that it glued me to the chair from the beginning till the end. It touches me deeply because Patton was revealed as a human being with both strength and weaknesses. From what I learnt from history books, the movie contains many facts too.<br /><br />This is one of the few movies that leaves a long lasting impression on me. No wonder, it won 7 Oscars in 1970 including the best picture.<br /><br />In short, it`s one the best that my money can get in terms of biography movies.
B004LWZW7E|4.0|\\"in Time\\" is a good, decent movie and I enjoyed it! However, the whole time I was watching it, the movie kept reminding me of \\"Logan's Run\\". Sure, there were variations in the plot and some of the concepts were different. But the underlying theme appears to be taken from \\"Logan's Run\\" and updated to reflect modern concepts.
B005DESVPO|5.0|This cd is awesome!! has such a swag!!!  I cant stop listening to it. I really became a fan when i saw him on david lettermen.  get it! you will love his vocals... but you will trip out when you see how much his guitar  stylings remind you of jimmy hendricks.
B0013N4AT0|5.0|Still Life is still a melodic death metal album but it's not as heavy as MAYH and it's way more progressive. It's their first true progressive album and it has songs ranging from death metal to acoustic ballads, overall a diverse album. Still Life is an essential album to any Opeth fan and it's just good music in general. Still Life and My Arms, Your Hearse are their best albums and some of my favorite CDs. Most people would put Blackwater Park or Ghost Reveries as their best, which are both amazing but I'd prefer their albums from Morningrise to Still Life. '90s Opeth is a lot better, Still Life isn't as accessible and it doesn't limit their music as much as their later stuff.

B0064TVQ5E|2.0|Deleted due to frequent error of game suddenly stopping and returning to carousel page, with distorted graphics.  Haven't had the Kindle long but this is the only app that has problems so far.  Just seemed too buggy on my device, will keep looking for a better Mahjong.
B001TW68P4|3.0|Over all I found the CD average, however a few of the songs made this a very worthwhile purchase and I will play them many times.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The books were great until the the third book. I felt that the authour didnt get its reader at this point. As a reader the war and and the family drama was important to us but what was even more important was the love story that was developing. She gave us pages and pages and more pages of preparing for the war and then the actual war and gave us 5 pages of what happened between katniss and peeta. ugh soo frustrating. First two books were great! they had a great balance of all story lines.
B005HSL626|5.0|that is the best game I have ever played and u can unlock different things based on your score. YOU BETTER LIKE IT
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love playing this game. It goes fast, has hints and is overall fun to play. I just wish there was a &quot;no ad&quot; version even if I had to pay for it I would.
B004U52VPS|1.0|I can't believe anyone would rate this above 1 star. If you are buying it merely for decoration purposes, like to decorate your desk or something then it's great. But to actually play it is a different story. One reviewer posted that it is \\"tedious\\" and that is the perfect word for it, TEDIOUS. It is nothing like the computer version at all. I think the worst thing is that most of the time, the birds don't even hit the target. It's not fun at all...very boring to say the least. You can't sit in the same spot because you have to keep moving around so that you can rebuild your target. My advice, DON'T BUY IT, stick to the version on your phone.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app.. love the ease of use for reading.... wish note taking and copying verses to notes was a little easier , like split screen or something... but overall amazing Bible

B004I8WD6E|5.0|After getting my new iPhone 4s, I was searching and searching for that \\"perfect case.\\"  I tried around 10-12 cases on in the store, purchased 2 (that I returned), never quite happy with how they looked and felt.  Then I found this case.  Here are the reasons I love it:<br /><br />Clear- shows of the white 4s really well<br />Sort of Grippy- iPhone 4 and 4s are really slippery, and this is a nice balance between grip and smoothness<br />Circular pattern- looks really cool<br />Cut outs- Everything fits (even older \\"non-slim\\" audio jacks, just barely)<br />Screen protector- Sure its not the best, but its a bonus.<br />Price- Everything else in stores run 20-40, and this was just 9.<br /><br />I highly recommend this case, and I plan on doing a follow up review in a few months to comment on durability.<br /><br />**Updated after 2 months of use**<br /><br />I'm still thrilled with this case.  For the price it just can't be beat.  As some reviewers have commented, it does in fact become less clear over time (but to be honest I don't know if that's the plastic or just the amount of dirt and wear on it over time).  It does a really nice job of softening falls (much better than the harder plastic alternatives).  I still highly recommend this product.
B004FOA84A|5.0|Bought this game thinking it was gonna be stupid, but loads of fun. The over all game is not long, but trying to figure out where everything is makes it long. Challenging at times and easy at times. Can be played in 2-3 sittings. Took me about three days to finish the game, I would usually play for half an hour before bed. This game would also be great for young kids 8-11 to play with their parent(s) or by theirselves, it would keep them content. Also this game has better game play on a tablet rather than a phone. I played it on my Kindle fire. Overall fun game, and it keeps you occupied and content.
B0063IH60K|1.0|This is an excellent game but until they offer a paid NO AD version like on the IPad I will only give it 1 star. I HATE ADS!!!
B003PBB4ME|3.0|I originally thought I would try this with a gripped 60D. I use it alot for video work. Because of that the 60D has a battery grip. Nothing chews through batteries like video work on a DSLR.  But you can't mount a 60D on this when the battery grip is installed on the body. Not enough working height.  So for small height camcorders...great design.  For gripped DSLR's doing lot's of video work...not so smart.  OTOH if they had skipped the artsy cruve design and made it basically the same BUT with a right angle design...they could've made it with a verticle extension option in the back...whoah...what a concept.  And had they made the feet just 1-2mm farther apart...why, you could've used the very common standard Bogen/Manfrotto PL200 rectangular quick release plate on the NOW corrected female tripod threads. And thus the standard Bogen/Manfrotto RC2 system line of heads or the Bogen/Manfrotto 323 adapter receiver would work. As it is currently made...the flip lever of the Bogen/Manfrotto RC2 system base hits the foot of the platform and does not securely hold this unit on an RC2 system head or adapter.  hmmm...a little bit of fore thought would've gone a long way.  So instead...I now use it for non-production work and a Canon SX40HS. OK for a \\"fun\\" combo.  But I'm not overly bent out of shape or anything because the \\"bang for buck\\" factor is not bad. Just disappointed at another example where a bit more thought would've made a great product.

0142429104|2.0|After the first chapter or two I wondered where the story was going.  It never really went anywhere.  This is a monologue from a mother who thinks her parenting and her kids are fascinating, and they just aren't, or at least not told from her point of view.
B004XE0P5E|1.0|My initially response to any artist that receives the amount of critical hyperbole as Bon Iver is to be deeply suspicious and step back. After deciding that I held out for long enough I'd peek my ears through and see what all the fuss is about. And after listening to the record in broken fragments as it was almost impossible to listen the whole way through I thought, is this it?  Overbearing in its faux earnestness, deliberate in its affected disjointedness, condescending in its supposed loftiness, insincere  in its vulnerable romanticism.  I can't help but hear a record as premeditated in commercial sensibility as a Justin Bieber record. Maybe he is Justin Bieber for 30 year old hipsters, but it just seems, to me, so targeted and so relentlessly affected.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|The Iron Lady is the story of a woman with dementia, who happens to once have been the first female Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. True, Margaret Thatcher is rumored to have Alzheimer's disease, but to let that dominate the movie is nothing but demoralizing. The film hurries through each and every one of her policy triumphs as quickly as possible, except for the Falklands, but languishes on each sign of sexism, downturn in fortune, or political criticism with longing intensity. For example, the epic economic upsurge in the British economy caused by her re-privatization and conservative economic policies is only shown with quickly flashed headlines in a sequence in which protesters attack Thatcher's car.<br /><br />Watching the film is like watching a biography of Winston Churchill focused solely on his alcoholism or JFK focused exclusively on his supposed philandering.<br /><br />The whole thing feels like someone said, &#34;let's celebrate her as a woman who overcame sexism and became a leader, but let's minimize her pro-business economic policies at all costs.&#34; The producers seem to want a symbol for their beliefs as opposed to presenting her actual beliefs.<br /><br />There's a great story waiting to be told about a woman who successfully re-privatized a socialist state and raise her nation's stature from declining to ascending... unfortunately that story is still waiting to be told.

The quote the old saw: \\"I laughed, I cried, it was better than Cats!\\" Well, I've never seen Cats, but this is great.<br /><br />The box set is neat, it comes in a blue box that looks like an official document file folder, and the individual seasons ate packaged like files. There is also a script of the Pilot, and some other stuff I haven't finished going through yet...

I'll reorder in a few months when Amazon gets a fresh batch, hopefully with functioning subtitles.

B0021L8UPS|5.0|I loved this movie even though I knew the twist at the end. The young actress that played Ester is outstanding and the stuff that nightmares are made of. She is just plain creepy in the movie. Her Russian accent is just enough to convince you that she is from Russia but still understandable. The movie moves along nicely from start to finish with massive chills along the way. The producers even felt it necessary to put a disclaimer at the start of the movie telling people not to be put off by the idea of adoption if they are thinking about adopting an older child. Yes, there IS something about Ester!
B000N0WCLC|5.0|Movie is awesome. Bluray is awesome. Special features awesome, especially the documentary. Nice story and acting. Good action. Buy it.

B0057MFA42|5.0|20 years ago, I told my self Nirvana Rules and I wrote that everywhere I could. In my school books. On my table. School canteen table. Carved it on the chalks to the point it annoyed my teachers. I say it again. Nirvana Rules. Awesome concert. Bluray video quality is good enough (a bit grainy) but still worth the buy. The only complain is that I feel the audio and video is not totally synchronized. I notice this clearly when watching Dave. I hear the snare sound miliseconds before he actually hits it. It is not a major problem but considering this is a musical performance, sound and video precision should be given priority.  HOWEVER, This is still totally worth the purchase.  -NIRVANA RULES-

B000W7JWUA|5.0|We have owned this game for about three years now, and I decided to purchase it as a Christmas gift for my friend and his family. With this set, you can play with up to 4 players. In order to play with 6 players, you must purchase the expansion pack (sold separately). The game is a building and trading game that is very interactive. I found it helpful to direct my friend to an online tutorial, since I would not be around to teach him how to play it.

1400052181|5.0|On the face of it, this is a fascinating story about how an intrepid young science reporter attempted to uncover the true story on how some cancer cells taken from a dying patient in 1951, led directly to the development of polio vaccines, chemotherapy, cloning, gene mapping, in vitro fertilization, drugs to combat leukemia, herpes, influenza, hemophilia, Parkinson's disease, sexually transmitted viruses and many more.  But what raises this story above the genre of just quality biography and science reporting is a 10-year long quest for the personal story that lay behind the science that raises issues regarding, not only scientific research, but also ethics, race, class, and faith.  The basic facts of the story is that a poor black woman at a John Hopkins University Hospital clinic in 1951 was diagnosed with a virulent case of cervical cancer that would quickly kill her.  Unbeknownst to her and her family, the doctors would take some cancer cells from her biopsy for research purposes.  Until this time researchers had been unable to keep cells alive for more than a few days.  However in this case, Henrietta Lacks' cells not only survived, but also duplicated themselves every 24 hours.  These first \\"immortal cells\\" would quickly be disbursed to hundreds of labs around the world and become \\"one of the most important things to have happened to medicine in the last 100 years.\\"  This is how the story existed for 38 years until a factoid in her beginning biology class in community college intrigued the author, Rebecca Skloot, and started her on an adventure to find the person behind the famous \\"Hela\\" cells.  The story of this decade long search would take the author through science labs, mental institutions, churches and hospitals with a cast of characters that would include Nobel laureates, grocery store clerks, convicted felons, storefront preachers and professional scam artists.  The author would quickly discover that the family of Henrietta Lacks had no idea about hercells and their importance for nearly 25 years after her death, until Henrietta's granddaughter happened to accidentally discover the information while discussing a friend's work in a lab at John Hopkins University.  The story then becomes the long tortuous saga of the author's attempts to gain the trust of Deborah Lacks, Henrietta's daughter, who not only has the sole remaining copy of Henrietta's medical records but also is the gatekeeper into the Lacks family itself.  But to gain that trust, the author had to overcome the fear and skepticism of a poor, superstitious, uneducated black family ill-treated by doctors, researchers and society as a whole.  The true stories of the barbaric medical experiments on blacks such as the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiments, along with unfounded rumors of a more recent vintage at John Hopkins, were never far from the Lacks' family mind.  This beautifully rendered story ultimately leaves us with the question that often perplexed the Lacks family itself - how could Henrietta's cells make millions for biotech companies who sold them, while many of Henrietta's descendants could not afford health insurance and Henrietta herself would lie buried in an unmarked grave.

B0007KS7D0|5.0|Unable to secure a Canon 250D close up lens in the 58 mm size for several months, I finally decided to try the Raynox DCR 150.  I have a Nikon D5100 fitted with the 50 mm F1.8G prime lens. I was initially concerned that there may be darkening of the image at the corners due to the Raynox being only a 49 mm lens or that the resolution would be noticeably poorer than that of the Nikon prime.  I am happy to report that there is no significant darkening at the corners and that the DCR 150 provides tack sharp close up's. Fine hairs on a bee, the texture of an orchid flower and subtle colors all come through beautifully.  There was no sign of chromatic aberration either.  The real challenge is being able to focus accurately when often your subject ( an insect or a flower ) keeps moving. A tripod would provide the best quality, although I found that by using a small aperture ( f11 ) and manual focus that I was able to get some very impressive first shots.  A few reviewers have made note of the difficulty in removing the protective caps from the unit.  All I can say is that for me it was a minor issue  In summary an excellent product and well worth having in your gadget bag.  A product that exceeded my expectations

B0029LHW68|5.0|An absolutely fantastic, complete CD.  I was lucky enough to snag this gem when amazon had it for $5.  I was first introduced to this album by a friend who described it as \\"epic.\\"  Once you give this CD a listen, you will discover that that is the perfect way to describe it.  Catchy guitar riffs, soaring (awesome) vocals, and appropriate percussion accompaniment are all highlights in TIW.  Everyone who listens to alternative rock radio will recognize \\"Kings and Queens,\\" but this album offers much more than just a single.  Buy it.<br /><br />P.S.  This is an exceptional album to have on while working out.  Something about the flow of the record is just very motivating.  Enjoy!
B006W0QOF2|1.0|I thought this was going to be cool. Great cast, interesting cinematography, but it's hollow, boring, pointless, plotless, full of glaring inconsistencies and altogether a waste of time and money.
B006O3MU96|3.0|It's definitely not as good as you might think. Again the old version has a lot more room and Doodle jumps much higher. If you're debating on whether you should buy it or not, I say it depends. If you wanna try something new and you a buck to spare, I hope you know it's not refundable.  Otherwise, na.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Perfect game to subside my boredom. Works perfectly every time. Installed quickly and takes up very little physical memory. Highly recommended to the card game buffs out there.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Everyday we wake up and know who we are.  We throw on some clothes, rush to work, take our kids to school, or even enjoy the solitude of a day off.  We live a life of routine, BUT the routine is one that we own.  We understand.  We relate to.  It is our life; we have created it and therefore we live it.<br /><br />But imagine if that were not the case.  Imagine waking up to nothing.  You do not know your name, you do not know who the man/woman/child who is sleeping in the bed next to you.  You have absolutely zero recollection of where you are.<br /><br />What would you do?<br /><br />I asked my Facebook followers a few weeks ago a rather complicated question.  It appears simple in it's statement but holds a world of complications if taken seriously.  Would you rather lose your LONG term or SHORT term memory, and why?  The answers were interesting, and extremely varied.  Some were aghast at the thought of losing either. Some (myself included) were happy with the thought of losing their past, but it was one statement, one very bold and very eloquent statement that dominated the pack.  \\"My past made me who I am, if I forget it, who am I?\\"  Now I ask you, how do you argue with that?<br /><br />  \\"Christine wakes up every morning in an unfamiliar bed with an unfamiliar man. She looks in the mirror and sees an unfamiliar, middle- aged face. And every morning, the man she has woken up with must explain that he is Ben, he is her husband, she is forty-seven years old, and a terrible accident two decades earlier decimated her ability to form new memories.<br /><br />  But it's the phone call from a Dr. Nash, a neurologist who claims to be working with Christine without her husband's knowledge, that directs her to her journal, hidden in the back of her closet. For the past few weeks, Christine has been recording her daily activities--tearful mornings with Ben, sessions with Dr. Nash, flashes of scenes from her former life--and rereading past entries, relearning the facts of her life as retold by the husband she is completely dependent upon. As the entries build up, Christine asks many questions. What was life like before the accident? Why did she and Ben never have a child? What has happened to Christine's best friend? And what exactly was the horrific accident that caused such a profound loss of memory?<br /><br />  Every day, Christine must begin again the reconstruction of her past. And the closer she gets to the truth, the more un- believable it seems.\\"<br /><br />Now, I have to be honest... I picked up this book for 1 reason and 1 reason only.  This quote:<br /><br />  \\"An exceptional thriller. It left my nerves jangling for hours after I finished the last page.\\" - Dennis Lehane<br /><br />For those of you that don't know... Dennis Lehane is the author of (to name a few) Mystic River, Shutter Island, and Gone Baby Gone.  His writing style is, (for a lack of a better word) chilling.  So when I read that \\"Before I Go To Sleep\\" left his \\"nerves jangling for hours\\" I couldn't pass it up.<br /><br />What I expected was (not necessarily) an average amnesia riddled read, but one that delved deeper into the psychosis that tends to fuel it.  What I didn't expect, was a thriller that I didn't want to put down.<br /><br />I would be remiss if I didn't say that the book (as a whole) start out slow, and yes...there was a point in the very beginning when I was sure I was going to hate it for it's gut wrenching repetition, but I'm glad I stuck it out.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Because about a half way through, once you've gotten to know the \\"real\\" Christine, (even if she hasn't) you come to understand that something is horribly wrong, AND...without consciously realizing it... anxiety starts to build in your chest and you become inexplicably tied to her. You have to help.  You do not exactly \\"understand\\" what she is going through... but you sympathize with it, and more importantly...you want to fix it.<br /><br />But that doesn't happen.  Insteadyou are forced to sit back and watch, (ok..read) while her life is continually dealt blows.  You WILL know what is going on... like me, you are sure to have a light-bulb moment when everything makes sense, but again...there is nothing you can do about it.  So you keep reading, hoping that she will remember, that a little spark will ignite that missing memory, that despite her doctors, her husband and her friends... she will SEE that light at the end of the tunnel and she will run like hell to get to it.<br /><br />Because at the end of the day...she has no other choice.<br /><br />This book will drive you crazy.  It will make you mad, but it will make you THINK! Which is exactly the point Lehane was trying to make.<br /><br />If you like thrillers, if you are fascinated with the mind of the unaware...take a crack at it.  If nothing else... I guarantee you that the last sentence is worth the other 514 pages.<br /><br />Happy Reading my fellow Kindle-ites and remember: \\"Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability, but comes through continuous struggle.\\" - Martin Luther King Jr.are sure to have a light-bulb moment when everything makes sense, but again...there is nothing you can do about it.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised at how thin, yet durable this cover is. I was thinking about getting a leather cover, but they looked to thick and bulky. This one was the best choice for my preferences. I like how it fits and how durable it feels. I would change 2 things if possible - make the front cover hinged, instead of a flap; and create a better way to \\"latch\\" it closed (maybe magnetic???), the elastic strap feels like it will wear out.

B0068AWQQ2|1.0|This the worst movie I have watched in recent memory. I wasted two hours of my life & would rather have done something more productive with my time. Not worth buying or renting at Redbox. You have been warned watch at your own risk. If there was a way to rate this movie with 0 stars I would have done so... 1 star is too high of a rating.
B005WMADYE|1.0|So, Amazon is in the business of sales..and honest reviews of crappy items apparently inhibit sales..hence the title of this review.<br /><br />If you think \\"Speed Racer\\" was high art, then this movie is for you. If watching someone else play a video game is your idea of a great moviegoing experience, this flick has your name all over it.<br />If you're into well written plots, dialog, or story..look elsewhere.<br />If you think the emporer's new threads were AWESOME, buy this movie.

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|The 411<br />Goddess and I watched this over the weekend and we can't get the songs out of our head. We are both humming \\"Think of Me\\". Think of Me Think of me fondly When we've said goodbye Remember me once in a while Please promise me you'll try Goddess was in love with all parts of it. She loved the clothes, the hair the songs, the music, \\"Oh thank you God for giving me someone to enjoy my beloved musicals with.\\" If you have never seen Phantom now is the time. This stage production was so beautifully done that Goddess thought it was a movie and insisted for a while that it was done on \\"green screen\\". It truly was beautiful. The scene where the phantom is taking Christine to his underworld looked like they were on a boat. The phantom and Christine are truly incredible. This production was obviously live and amazing. The camera work, set designs, music, actors, singing, incredible. I felt as if I had actually see a stage show. The Royal Albert Hall is massive and breathtaking.<br /><br />The performances by Sierra Boggess and Ramin Karimloo are so powerful that I found myself sobbing three times including the end were Sarah Brightman and previous phantoms sing. LOVED IT!

1933952806|5.0|This book made it make sense.  I bought the D7000 and was never REALLY happy with my results. After sending the camera back to NIKON for repairs on a nikon diagnosed Back Focusing issue.  When the camera came back, It was so much better but I still wasnt happy. This Book, along with the David Busch book helped me to understand the complex autofocusing system of my camera.. and WOW what a difference.  This book is EASY to understand, he speaks clearly, but doesnt treat you like a \\"dummy\\".  Its great on the kindle, because you can click on all of the links to previous chapters!!!  Great book, Kind author whom you can tell enjoyed the camera and writing the book for you.  You need to get it before any others. Trust me, and read that chapeter a few times on auto focusing and you wont be sorry!!!!!!! It'll change how you feel about your camera!

B004EPYZSU|1.0|I rented the movie on Blu-ray.  When I accessed the extras to watch the extended version, there was a notification that extras were available only when the movie was purchased.  I'm including this on this site hoping someone will let the PsTB (powers that be) know that if they seriously think I'm going to spend good money, especially the incredibly inflated prices they demand when a movie is new, with out knowing what I'm getting, they are seriously deluded.  This movie was distributed by Universal Studios Home Entertainment and this practice of not including extras on their rental discs is a growing travesty.  I'm recommending that all of us who want the extras and want to see them before we buy the movie stop buying anything from Universal as a protest.  At least that is what I'm going to do.  As a matter of fact, I think I'll not see movies produced by Universal in the theater, or rent them, or purchase them.

B000UZQI0Q|5.0|The Well of Ascension is one of those very few novels that upon completion, you simply say \\"wow\\". This isn't just a good sequel to the already incredible first novel The Final Empire. It's one the greatest fantasy epics I've ever read and it easily surpasses the original.<br /><br />One of the many reasons The Well of Ascension works is because author Brandon Sanderson is able to avoid one of the biggest pitfalls when writing a sequel: predictability. Many authors make nearly identical sequels to pad out their story lines, making them lackluster and their series stagnant. Brandon Sanderson is able to avoid this downward spiral and then some. The Lord Ruler is dead, the good guys are victorious, the enslaved skaa have been freed from their oppressive overseers, and our heroine finds true love. Of course that still leaves the world in a complete state of disarray and chaos. After nearly an eternity of oppression and censorship by the Lord Ruler would it really sense for everything to just fall into place? How does a world recover from such an existence? That question resonates throughout the entire book. This has allowed Sanderson to change the focus of the of the Mistborn series from one of rebellion and oppression to political intrigue and survival. It's a refreshing change for the series yet at the same time it retains its already established identity.<br /><br />Describing the sense of scale in The Well of Ascension's story as \\"epic\\" would be a drastic understatement. With the aforementioned Lord Ruler being killed this allows the various tyrants and warlords across the Final Empire to fight for supremacy across its various dominances. With Luthadel no longer the seat of power for the Lord Ruler it has come under siege by Straff Venture and several other armies all vying for the prize of the massive city and its supply of atium; and of course their problems don't stop there. Discord and desperation run rampant among the remaining nobles making it difficult for Elend Venture, now king of Luthadel to even hold onto his crown let alone stop the invading armies from destroying their new found freedom. All of this while the prophesied evil The Deepness slowly begins to reemerge onto the unsuspecting world. The characters are thrust right into the middle of this crisis and must find a solution to a seemingly impossible situation.<br /><br />This is one of those few books that literally never stops entertaining you. My only gripe that I had with the previous novel The Final Empire was that it eventually fell into an entertaining yet formulaic pattern towards the middle of the book. That is not the case in The Well of Ascension at all. Nearly every chapter brings something new to the story like characters, unforeseen twists, and various political issues and foreign threats. There's no boring sections and no uninteresting or boring characters to drag the narrative to a halt. Sanderson does all of this flawlessly while continuing to illustrate some of the most intense and adrenaline filled action scenes that I've ever read from any genre.<br /><br />With the throne empty after the skaa rebellion, the heroes are forced to step out of the shadows and into the ravenous world of politics where they'll learn the harshness of leadership. Taking power was the easy part, holding onto it is the true challenge. As Orson Scott Card ever so happily praised, Sanderson understands how leadership in society works. He portrays a very Machiavellian sense of burden which leaders must overcome in order to protect their kingdom. Elend Venture's reign couldn't have come at a worse time, the materialistic Luthadel nobles don't exactly take to kindly to the man who has limited their sense of power in society, keeping their cut-throat intentions in check is only the beginning. Despite having freedom and a voice in politics due to Elend's fair legislation, the skaa cannot be fully trusted either. The removal of their abusive owners comes with the loss of their food and shelter. They were slaves, but they at least were able to survive. After what seemed like an eternity of servitude to the Lord Ruler and his nobles, the skaa simply cannot comprehend the premise of freedom.<br /><br />Character development was one of Sanderson's strongest areas that he showcased in The Final Empire which he continues to demonstrate to an even greater extent. The individual members of Kelsier's crew have been installed in various positions of power within Elend's government. It was interesting to see the once thieves and conspirators having to adjust and find a place in the spotlight. I particularly enjoyed the attention given to Sazed, he was a particularly stoic character in the last book so giving him more personality was a welcome change. It's also very clear that the Mistborn trilogy will always feature dual protagonists for each of the three novels. The Final Empire featured the charismatic Kelsier as the mentor to the cynical Vin. The Well of Ascension focuses instead on Vin and Elend as lovers, both trying to keep each other and their kingdom safe from harm. Many fantasy and romance novels that I've read have always boiled down to a weak sexually driven relationship instead of a strong well-written character driven one that focuses on the characters' needs and vulnerabilities. Brandon Sanderson puts the competition to absolute shame in the Well of Ascension which felt like a coming of age story for the two. Vin and Elend aren't looking for thrills and pleasure, they're both flawed human beings who gain balance through each other. The stalwart yet feeble King Elend gains courage through Vin's bravery and strength while Vin finds comfort through Elend's love and compassion, something she has never felt in her entire life. Sanderson can literally write a better romance than most authors can when he isn't even writing a romance novel to begin with. Every one of these amazing characters despite all the power at their fingertips and existing on a completely different plain of reality feel genuinely human. They actually feel like real believable people which is something many fantasy authors have trouble replicating.<br /><br />I knew the sequel to The Final Empire would be good, but I didn't think it would be this incredible. Where many authors's stumble on their second iteration Brandon Sanderson soars. I will personally remember The Well of Ascension as one of the greatest sequels that I've ever read and one of the greatest books in general. The incredibly well written plot with non-stop action, and some of the most lovable characters that I've ever seen will keep you guessing and begging for more. Once you finally reach the end Vin will most likely become one of your most favorite characters of all time, if she isn't already.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|Let me begin by saying, I am a big Stephen King fan!!  I am currently on a quest to read all of his literary work so I was excited to read this book....and I was not diasappointed.  While I feel it deviates a bit from Stpehen King's classic style, I was still impressed and intrigued by this book.  The characters were engaging and believable.  The plot was complex.  Most of all, the books grabbed me from the beginning and surprised me at the end.  It was a great read!  Thanks Stephen King!!!
B0010VD7EE|2.0|This review only addresses the 2008 LP pressing by Plain Vinyl records, not the music itself - which, IMHO is an Elliott Smith masterpiece.  In fact, it's only Elliott's music that elevates this product beyond the minimum one star rating it truly deserves.  I first noticed some significant hissing on Side 1 and thought that perhaps something was wrong with my turntable or receiver.  Consonant sounds such as \\"S\\" sounds or drum snares had a significant high-end crackle and hiss.  Flipped over to Side 2 and there was a huge skip on the first song \\"Everything Means Nothing to Me\\".  I took the record off and inspected it with a magnifying glass, but didn't see anything.  I cleaned the record like a madman and tried a few more listens.  Tried Sides 3 and 4 - same problem.  By this point, I was almost pulling my hair out and feverishly checking every little detail of my audio setup.  I wasted a good hour in this fashion until, finally, I decided to go online and do some sleuthing.  Lo and behold, I discovered others who were having similar problems that I was - including that huge skip on \\"Everything Means Nothing to Me\\".  Obviously, then, this is a bad pressing by the manufacturer.  Because of my love for this album, I tried to overlook the quality problems on this LP and continue listening - but I simply couldn't bear to hear the music butchered like that.  Ended up returning the item, and will simply continue listening to the digital (CD/MP3) version of this until I can save up enough money to purchase a copy of the original, 2000 pressing by Bong Load records.  Too bad.

1466401885|4.0|This is a self-published book that is worth the read. I admit, even though I have one self-published book of my own, I still tend to be a self-published book snob. Not only that, but I read this on my phone! The horror. I'm glad I read it. Travis and Abby have a difficult to explain kind of relationship. It's a very co-dependent type situation. Both of them have a past to contend with. Travis' is a man-ho. Plain and simple. Abby is running from her past and all the family dysfunction that goes with it. Theirs is a strange and compelling relationship with so much sexual tension you could slice it with a knife. There's violence, some foul language, sex. None of which bothered me. It was refreshing to read a love story that isn't all fluffy sunshine and roses and happy-ever-after. The emotional roller-coaster of real life drama. Great read!

B000YRY8BG|4.0|Gripping story, weak ending.  I was really into this series and waited eagerly each week for the next episode. The acting is top notch and the writing clever, but the end, to me, was abrupt and it felt almost too simple. I won't give anything away, but I felt a little disappointed and had hoped for an epilogue of sorts to give us involved viewers some closure. i do want to mention that the series is far better than the movie remake.

0307593312|1.0|Don't fall down the rabbit hole!  This book is pretentious, repetitive, & boring.  Half way through I asked myself \\"Is Murakami playing a horrible joke on us?\\"  I thought everything about this book was terrible. The plot was overwrought, the sexual references obnoxious, and the book could have been helped by heavy editing. Very disappointing to a Murakami fan.  Don't spend your money on this one!
B004LWZWBU|5.0|This movie lifts my spirits every time I watch it!  An excellent story with engaging characters.

0743454537|1.0|I'd never read Picoult before, and the premise of this book had me thoroughly captivated: a child is created to be the perfect match for her leukemia-stricken sister so she can be a donor. But by the age of 13, young Anna puts the brakes on her sister's latest need: a kidney.<br /><br />There are many other descriptions here of what the book does and does not do. Frankly, I found it captivating, even though some of the subplots got unwieldy. Campbell, the attorney with the service dog? His ongoing fictitious explanations for the dog's purpose were sometimes funny (\\"I have a heart problem; he's great at CPR.\\") Although his refusing to pay attention when the dog is howling at him is thoroughly implausible. I have that particular malady, and no one in his right mind would stay to fight a case in a courtroom rather than getting the aid he needs. Stupid stupid stupid.<br /><br />And Sara, the mom from hell who always puts Anna second to her sister's needs? She's got to be one of the most irritating characters in fiction. Not to mention her older brother, who becomes an arsonist so he can exert some control over an uncontrollable world. We saw that one coming miles away.<br /><br />There were a lot of very good things about this book at the beginning, and enough of a mystery to make me wonder how the courts - and Anna - would decide.<br /><br />But the reason this book went into the trash as soon as I finished it was the appalling ending. After getting us fascinated by the premise and invested in the characters, the author pulls the stupidest stunt imaginable. We are led, throughout the book, to know it will not end well. But the sacrificial lamb Picoult chooses makes no sense at any level. Where was the editor? How did this book get published?<br /><br />My first and last book by this author.

B004I8WD6E|1.0|[updated 2/21] OK, the screen protector is junk. After regular use it now has a thumb-sized smudge where I (apparently) touch the screen the most, making it difficult to see the screen under it. FAIL. Do not buy this.  [old] As my subject suggests, this was a mixed bag. The product itself is quite nice and works the way you'd expect. However, my screen protector arrived pretty scratched. Also, a nit I'll pick: The packaging proudly announced it was (I forget the wording) special and easy to use. Ironically, it was difficult to open. Also, instructions weren't included for half of it (I forget which half now). Anyway, it works well, and I decided to keep it - scratched - because I figure it'll get scratched eventually.

0439023521|1.0|Everyone else loves this book.  Perhaps because it means different things to different people.  What the point of the book is can be debated.  What can't be debated is what we need to go through to get to the point.  At one key moment in the book (and here is the spoiler) a twelve year old girl is captured in netting, tortured (until she calls the name of her friend), and then upon the appearance of her friend she is killed by having a spear driven through her stomach.  The person who kills her is a 14 year old boy.  Upon her friend seeing her killed she shoots an arrow through the neck of the boy.  The girl shooting the arrow is 16.  The book is well written, if not a bit predictable.  The question I had while reading the book is why was it written?  It lacks the subtlety of Lord of the Flies and ultimately delivers a much less powerful message or warning.  Basically, we have a story that uses the theme of kids being forced to kill kids to advance the plot.  Not my cup of tea.  And it may not be your cup of tea too if you are in the minority like me.

B00729GQ0A|4.0|Sophia is a girl with some regular problems and some not-so-regular problems. Her mom doesn't understand her and the people in her Colorado town won't respect her Wiccan beliefs. On the not-so-regular side, she's suspected in the death of a neighbor, the attractive guy she's just met is non-human, and she keeps hearing voices that may or not be related to an ancestor burned as a witch generations ago. Rebecca Hamilton has created an imaginative world in this entertaining and provocative book. As Sophia finds clues about the people/undead around her, she uncovers truths about herself--her history, her abilities, her future. The story twists and turns and builds to an action-packed ending, as Sophia uses every power she has to protect her new family and start another chapter in her life. A well-written and intelligent novel, the first in what promises to be an exciting series.  Mary Vensel White, author of  [[ASIN:B006NSGD36 The Qualities of Wood]]
B0033AX1YG|5.0|Upon hearing the rumor that Gary Moore plays very well the guitar, I bought this in order to observe his left hand to pick up the chords. If you like an electric guitar, it seems this DVD is utile for you. He is most of all singer, and at the same time he plays the guitar. The speed to pick up the chords is very quick, and .... I think it is not etiquette to tell any longer about his guitar technique. You need to see directly his hands.

B005NQ94KS|1.0|I love Anne Hathaway.  She is just so luminescent and just a joy to watch.  She's also one of the more talented young stars who can tackle a wide range of things (she can sing, she can do comedy, she can to drama, she can be sexy) and so I tend to get really excited when I see her name pop up.  When `One Day' came out I remember some of my friends talking about how the novel was really, really good but that it seemed almost unfilmable and so they were nervous about how this was going to pan out.  I have yet to read the novel, and so I didn't have those worries.<br /><br />I saw `Starring Anne Hathaway' and I was sold.<br /><br />I love you Anne, but this movie was ill-advised.<br /><br />The issue with `One Day', an issue that never goes away and permeates every scene, is that it is structuralized in vignettes that span over the course of twenty-some-odd-years but that consist of one day per year and so we rarely get filled in on the events of the year, just the moments of that one particular day (the same day each year, the day that the two main characters originally met).  In literary form, I can see how this could work because there is opportunity to expound, but in an hour and forty minutes it is very hard to convey much of anything.  As a result, the relationship between Emma and Dex takes no shape.  It just doesn't feel real.  The burgeoning love they are supposed to form really doesn't come across at all, so when the film reaches critical moments towards the end it feels rather forced and not truly legitimate.  Another thing is that the context surrounding the importance of that day never really feels necessary either.  I mean, it's not like they do something special with one another on that day every year.  Sometimes they don't even talk to one another, but for some reason things happen on that day every year that we need to see (or so it would seem).<br /><br />Outside of the botched structure and flakey storytelling, the acting is also a miss of sorts.

0307477479|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and am anxious for our book club discussion - it will lend itself well to delve into all the  charactors and plots.  I am super bummed I read it on my reader.  There are so many interwoven plotlines and charactors I feel I missed some connections due to my having to go back and find them.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|The video arrived shortly after I ordered it in very good condition. There is nothing that I can think of that is wrong with it. I appreciate the low price and the short amount of time it took to receive the video.  Thank You
B004APVI1G|5.0|I'd seen this movie in 2D and thought 'this would make a Great 3D movie'. Indeed, the effect was, imho, as good as 3D gets in its current state of development. The story employs a 'coming of age' genre that will no doubt get very old very fast for adults required to view it multiple times as dutiful parents or grandparents, but the kids will stay fascinated.<br /><br />So I rate this movie 5 stars for the 3D effect, and is of referrence quality in this regard. Another movie I'd like to see in 3D is 'How to Train Your Dragon'.  That movie had the added attraction of being faily humorous at times.
0062073494|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, it is a great read! It is a true page turner, I read it too fast, now I need to find another book to read. Before reading this book, I had watched a PBS documentary about the Orient Express, this was nice because then while reading the book I had in my mind a very clear image of the train decor, cars, etc. Enjoy!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I find this game a challenge and very playable. It is great when you have to wait a few minutes. It looks great also on the display.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I really love this game! My first experience with Fire Maple games was The Secret of Grisly Manor. This continues along the same path, but with a different story line. Also, the game is longer and much more complex.  The built in hint guide is a nice feature to have, as well as the scene map to help you navigate around. Take my advice, though, stick with it without going for the hints!  The graphics are sharp, colorful, and clean; the music and sound effects add a nice touch. I'm running this on a Kindle Fire and had no problems whatsoever.  If you like puzzle games in the genre of Myst, you will definitely enjoy playing this game. If you've played Grisly Manor, this is a must-have.
0385737947|5.0|The book was brand new condition except for a red marker line at the bottom of the book pages.  A very good read too!  I liked it as much as \\"The Hunger Games\\", but it would be OK for slightly younger readers (10-13 year olds)
B00005JLWN|4.0|Looking through the reviews, I noticed that there were actually dim bulbs out there comparing this film to The Matrix. Huh? Well, evidently some online reviewers either can't or don't read, and can only make comparisons to things that exist in the most recent annals of pop culture. This film is actually an update of the classic book and film, \\"Farenheit 451\\". It does a convincing job of portraying a militaristic society of intellectual and artistic intolerance (\\"Matrix\\" comparers, anyone?). Bale is terrific, as is the supporting cast. There are some pretty harrowing moments, and the message as is poignant now as it has been for the past several decades. Recommended for thinking sci-fi enthusiasts.
0802473156|5.0|This book is a Godsend. If your relationship isn't what it used to be, or hasn't reached its potential yet, then give it another chance and try reading this book. It's helped my marriage so far, and I'm sure that it will help yours too. :)

B0073LWEXK|5.0|as stated above, this game is amazing! I couldn't put it down. works great on kindle fire, not buggy at all. I will say, though, in order to play you need to use critical thinking skills and you need to have patience.
0439023491|5.0|For me, this trilogy was not book one - book two - book three, or, the second was worse or better or whatever. It was one story throughout. It could have been one big book with chapters, because you couldn't read them independently anyway. It may not have been the most educated litterature I've ever read, but frankly, I couldn't put it down, and couldn't stop thinking about it. It is quite fascinating. Comparing it with Twilight is stupid. There is no resemblance whatsoever.<br />One of the reviews for the final book (Mockingjay) made total sense me: The reviewer compared it to real soldiers, war and what life is like afterwards. Going into this read with that mind-set makes it a different experience. As far as Catching Fire, I did not think it was a repeat of The Hunger Games at all, like some reviewers here say. Each book has it's own agenda but it is a continous story and when I was at the end of one, I wanted to start the next one right away. I just wish it didn't end. Can't wait for the movie.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I got this app on my kindle fire and instantly got addicted no wonder they sell the t- shirts and novelty mugs!
0393317552|1.0|It's tempting to point out the the good bits. When I read it I really appreciated the depth in which he explores biogeographical factors in human history. It was a idea I hadn't seen explored before and its certainly very important. It's also tempting to point on the little mistakes. Diamond's historical scholarship is far from rigorous and he tends to extrapolate a lot from hearsay and narratives that he made up himself. He has a section on the site stinkyjournalism for doing this with respect to current events. However the important aspect of this book is the oversimplification. From a certain deterministic point of view, history was a product of a variety of factors and you can pick one and declare it the \\"cause.\\" Geography, however, is an odd choice when there are so many people being unpredictable. The problem with claiming geographic determinism, is that it allows people to ignore historical and modern systems of inequality. You can't say that slavery, colonialism, or genocide were historically inevitable and somehow justified. By oversimplifying social and cultural systems, Diamond is supporting inequality and neo-colonialism.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|I first viewed this movie at a theater with the big screen and great sound. It was a wonderful experience. From the very first scenes with that great music playing I knew I was going to like this picture. As the story developed I was completely taken in as the events opened up a fantastic adventure.  When the DVD became available in Blu Ray I just had to own it. Amazon as usual had a good price and great convenience so I bought it from them. I have watched it at home twice and surely will do so again in the future.
1401233066|3.0|I love the Fables series of graphic novels, but they are starting to dry up entertainment-wise.  Now, it would be ridiculous to assert that a series based on Fairy Tale creatures living among us in the modern world is getting too far-fetched, but that is the feeling I am getting.  It might be time for this series to gracefully fade away.  I highly recommend Fables 1-12 however.
B005DF2QMC|5.0|great product to use, very simple instructions. Would like more in depth instructions. It would be nice to have a power cord adapter because two AA batts don't last long
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it's great listening and reading along.  it gives a whole new perspective! my senses come alive!! And it's nice for my kids to listen to before they go to sleep.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|great to help you organize your thoughts and plans. I love that you can include different media. it is a nice planner and useful across different computers
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Reading book description seems like a fantasy book which I do not like too much.  Seeing the Hunger Games book being always the best book shown in Amazon for many weeks, I said to myself \\"Since I like all books as long as it is well written, so I'll try this book\\".  Well I give this book a 5, one of the best book I ever read.  This is in a world of classes of people, the rich and dominants and the poor and oppressed people. Always full in intrigues even when they were getting cleaned and groomed for the games.  Anxious to read the second book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|soo many games to keep anyone occupied during any kind of down time. I recommend it for anyone looking for great games to play
0446556750|4.0|I didn't enjoy Connelly's last book but this one was a winner.  Mickey Haller, the \\"Lincoln Lawyer\\" is the star while his half-brother, fabled cop Harry Bosch, only plays a supporting role -- albeit a very important supporting role. I sense that Connelly is slowly phasing out the aging Bosch and phasing in Lincoln Lawyer Haller, but although he's a good character, Haller is a lawyer, not a cop.  Thus, Connelly has to turn to Bosch for good cop action, which could be a weakness in future Connelly novels if Bosch is gone.  In other words, Connelly needs to start developing another cop protagonist.  But \\"The Reversal\\" is generally a good book -- mostly a courtroom drama.  Not a lot of police action.  In fact, I don't think Bosch so much as throws a punch. However, I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Reversal\\" and am looking forward to future Connelly novels, however they unfold.

145162445X|4.0|Lawrence Krauss has made a glorious attempt at explaining the current thinking of cosmologists, astronomers and physicists about our Universe, its past, present and future. Overall, for the patient and well-educated reader, this is an excellent discourse, one that I thoroughly enjoyed.<br /><br /> Krauss's premise that the Universe emerged from nothingness and will someday most likely be nothing again is convincing and reflects current cosmological thinking.<br /><br /> I don't know enough to challenge Krauss's presentation - but I do know enough to be irritated by his arrogance and his outright hostility to religious people.<br /><br /> I am not religious by any stretch of the imagination, but I do recognize the right of those who believe in religions that don't call for the destruction of other people to believe what they will as long as they don't try to force me to believe in it too.<br /><br /> Intelligent people are capable of making their own decisions, aided by clear exposition of science such as Krauss provides here. His sniping at religious people is unnecessary and, in my opinion, demeaning to Krauss.<br /><br /> Other than that, as an attempt to popularize highly esoteric science, \\"A Universe from Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather than Nothing\\" is a good read.<br /><br />Jerry
0062112430|5.0|When I first opened this book, the only things I knew about Delirium were that many people think it's incredible and that it has a killer cliffhanger. For the most part it was a great story and I can see why people would be dying to see where the next book picks up, but for some reason, it wasn't completely what I was expecting. That's not a bad thing in the least.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver had created a world where it's not safe to show your true feelings. I really love the thought and deep meaning put into the story. It is true that love is sort of this disease we all tend to suffer from, but it's the most wonderful disease I've ever known. The change in appetite, increased heart rate, inability to think straight- they could all definitely be classified as symptoms to something threatening. I loved wandering down the path with Lena while she traded ignorance for courage. Everything about her mindset changed completely by the end of the story. One thing I can say for sure is that I'm very thankful to have a copy of Pandemonium at hand, because I just have to find out what happens between her and Alex, since Delirium has such a bittersweet ending.<br /><br />See more of this review at The Hollow Cupboards- thehollowcupboards.blogspot.com
B0058WFO06|5.0|Steven Wilson. I should have known if Akerfeldt liked him there had to be something interesting about his offerings. But \\"Grace\\" goes boldly where Heritage could only hope. I am giving this review on the basis of one track...Raider II. I don't even need to hear the rest of the album. Simply a maniacal, hysterical, and sublime smorgasbord of instrumentation on a level I've not heard since Scott Walker's \\"Drift\\". Music can't always be this good because we would have nothing by which to benchmark it's ingenuity. This is the second time that Mikael has turned me on to an artist of the avant-garde variety. I won't second guess him again. If the Storm Corrosion collaboration is anything like this then what sonic wonders await!<br /><br />Your mileage may vary but \\"Raider II\\" is simply breathtaking in its composition and emotive power. It is all at once ominous, precious, theatrical and densely intricate. It traverses all the avenues and back alleys of sound, both dissonant and confluent. Haunting in both breadth and scope, it delivers the listener inexorably through its catacombs but with a willingness that far exceeds its length. The Wilson itinerary has covered all of the logistics and you need only adjust the belt...and the speakers.<br /><br />As an update [2/17] and afterthought...the album is all that I imagined it would be. From the devastatingly haunting and heart-wrenching \\"Belle De Jour\\", to the swirling, sinister syncopation of \\"Remainder the Black Dog\\". Wilson weaves something magical, monolithic and malevolent all at once. \\"Like Dust I Have Cleared My Eye\\" is so precious it falls on you like snow.<br /><br />I don't know how Wilson supplants this stupendous segue into the surreal but put me on the waiting list for the attempt.
B006BQM762|5.0|This was a wonderfully made movie that really immersed you in the time period it was set and care about the characters and the outcome.
B005KELQEU|5.0|This sleeve has been a great item to have. I just slip my Kindle inside, slide it into my purse and I'm off. I don't have to worry about my car keys, an ink pen or something of the sort scratching or gouging my Kindle's screen or housing.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is outstanding. I use it all the time. Great features and very easy to use. I highly recommend it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a must have application.  I love having the entire. Bible at my fingertips.  Easy to access book and chapter and being able to select the version you prefer makes this a perfect reference guide.  Bookmarks and other tools make it easy to use.

B0067QPVD2|5.0|This movie, I must say is a damn good remake of the 80s version. Excellent CGI!  Outstanding work on answering some of the mystery about the ship, but we still need more info about the alien species. This movie is well done and my hats off to the producers! Not only did you guys get it right and NOT screw up an original franchise, but you took it, a step further. That's Brilliant. Great cinematography, great sets!  Great actors! You guys know what the hell you're doing and I really appreciate that! In closing, I wish someone would remake the classic 1951 original, with a nice updated version by today's standards of the alien humanoid! Key word \\"humanoid\\" not a CRAB that body snatches!  Its kind of hard to believe that a \\"galactic crab\\" can build a smooth looking space ship like that,  have intelligence, and yet still be that hostile toward people?  Really guys!?  I challenge you to remake the 1951 classic. Now that would be impressive, indeed. Thanks you!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games are fun and i like how you always win some points. i still cant figure out the soccer ball game, that sucks, but i like the challenge.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|The cover is attractive, keeps the screen clean and has a pocket for papers. The cover stands up for a hands free read. Really nice.
B00631VJIC|5.0|Fantastic!! Great songs, well put together, so glad i bought it.  All the songs on the album suit the show and you can relate certain songs back to parts in episodes and what series they are from.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed the first 2 books so much & was hooked in no time. In less than a week I've finished the books. I have to say I was disappointed because the ending felt rushed. It tried to tie all the loose ends too quickly & I had to read the ending twice because I missed some of the implications. It just felt anticlimactic, but I still love the trilogy, so I've let the rest of the plot make up for the ok end.
B0015AARJI|1.0|i hate my control, is so hard to use it because the buttons are hard to press. hate it. horrible
B0001Z37HM|3.0|Classic fun movie.  My wife has had this movie as a guilty pleasure on VHS for years, finally glad to have found it on DVD for her to enjoy.  Cheesy by the nature, but if you love the original Conan and those movies you'll enjoy this one.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|If you love The Beatles, and want to hear the mixes that they wanted on record, the mono box set is a must have. Just make sure you get a genuine set, not a chinese forgery. It took me three times, but I finally got one.
B000JJRIN4|4.0|With the success of her successful 2004 debut \\"Love Angel Music Baby\\", I was fully expecting another batch of club-centric, highly infectious dance numbers that continued to highlight the solo career of Gwen Stefani. If there's one thing that really shifted from LAMB to \\"The Sweet Escape\\", it's her image, which she re-defined for this album. Instead of praising the Harajuku girls or going on and on about fashion and glamour, she tries to explore some different themes, such as relationships, commitments, and living life in the fast lane. However, these messages do not \\"The Sweet Escape\\" a complete departure from her debut album, because she delivers them with the same sensual and glossy vocals as she did in 2004. Also, she still uses an abundance of double entendres to execute songs such as \\"Yummy\\", which is the guiltiest pleasure on the album. So Gwen is consistent, never straying into foreign ground and always sticking within the boundaries of her norm. What sets the album back, however, are the strenous efforts that lie in \\"Now that you got it\\" and \\"Breaking up\\", which simply don't live up to their potential, and are also, quite frankly, grating on the nerves. Her best moments on this set, and maybe even in her entire solo career, are my recommended tracks \\"Early Winter\\" and \\"Wonderful Life\\", which she delivers with efficiency and grace. So overall, this album is an anomaly, it does sound different than her previous work, but at the same time is still the same Gwen we all know and love.
B0015AARJI|1.0|Don't buy controllers off Amazon.  The first one I bought was a cheap knock off, which I had to wait forever for a new one.  And the second one I bought is honestly just not great, you can tell the difference between it and the ones you buy from a retail store.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|This is a great app. It does what it says it does.<br />But the controls are very clunky on the Fire. And using it over the internet is much slower than over a local network.
B003ES61EE|3.0|it's a convenient lens cleaning pen with both the large and small cleaning head. so you can clean not only the lens but also the tiny spaces such as the view finder, and even the CMOS. however, it does not pretty much work for me as I use SLRs and DSLRs most of the time. when used on lenses with a large front glass(compared to the small DCs), its cleaning head is actually not firm enough to hold it vertical to the lens surface all the time that it may kind of twist. slightly, it can create new blots on the glass. or if it twists severely, it may cause scratches. I personally do not recommend it for expensive SLR lenses. but it would be good for small digital cmaeras with small lens.
B0059XTTXC|1.0|This movie started out extremely slow.  There are movies that start out slow and then build up and become great edge of your seat amazing thillers.  This is NOT one of them.  The characters were completely uninteresting.  I just could not wait for this thing to end.  I'm not sure I could give a very accurate discription of this film being as I'm sure I fell asleep at least twice.  One of the top 5 most boring movies I have ever wasted my time on.  I gave it one star because that is as low as this website allows.
B005HSL626|4.0|I think this app is very fun. I just got it on a kindle an d I recommend it more on a kindle or nook because the graphics are better, its a lot bigger, and easier to see! I would absolutely recommend it!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|App downloaded and installed with no problems, until I tried to play the games.<br /><br />\\"Welcome to 101 Games\\"...and that was it. Subsequent re-istallations did absolutely nothing to get the app to start.<br /><br />On a scale of 1 to potato, this app rates in the negative numbers. It's an absolutely worthless app.
B006CEKZ4Y|4.0|This 70th Anniversary Blu-ray release of arguably the best film of all time is a bit of a mixed bag especially for those who already have the standard disc version [[ASIN:B00003CX9E Citizen Kane (Two-Disc Special Edition)]].  My copy of the standard disc upscales very well in 1080p on my blu-ray player and while the picture quality is very good and bright, there are still very faint white spots in some frames for example in the scene where the reporter is reviewing the manuscript in the vault.  The sound quality is also good there but this blu ray version has a vastly superior sound quality coming in DTS mono.  The strange thing is that when it comes to the picture quality, the blu-ray shows a lot more grain when compared with the vault scene in the standard version and while the white spots are virtually a thing of the past, the lighting is pretty dark and at the end when the reporters leave Xanadu, you can hardly see a thing on the blu-ray while you can still make out the faces on the upscaled standard disc.  As the second disc on the \\"Battle for Citizen Kane\\" is virtually identical to the one on the standard release there is nothing to compare among the two here.  The booklet packaging with the colour photos and pages is nice but other than that, there is nothing really to distinguish between the blu-ray and the standard dvd release.<br /><br />Better sound quality but arguably slightly better picture quality when compared to the upscaled standard disc and equal special features except for the better blu-ray book packaging makes it a tough call on whether or not to double dip.  For me, I kinda regret doing it as the improvements do not \\"wow\\" me enough.<br /><br />You will have to decide about \\"upgrading\\" but if you don't already have this film in any form, you might as well get this blu-ray.  As for me, I wish I didn't as my Special Edition 2-disc Standard DVD release upscales well enough so much so that I don't feel ready to part with it the way I do with other blu-ray upgrades that I have done.t I have done.
B005IDXIL2|1.0|Claims to be compatible with Android-capable devices. After it restarted my device NO LESS THAN THREE TIMES during the download, I have to conclude that this app is, in fact, NOT Android-friendly.
B006ZS81GG|5.0|A bunch of strong songs lyrically, vocally and production wise. Could almost be mistaken for a greatest hits album!  Lucky Ones is my favourite, a simple and beautiful love song.  She did not grow up rich. Her father is a real estate agent who bought a bunch of dotcom names in the nineties and held on to them at some cost. He only started to make money on them well after she left home. He may well be helping her now though.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are fun for a while. they get boring after a time, however. it is good that there are many to choose from.
1451627289|5.0|A (very) long, satisfying read with richly textured characters and settings. It mostly avoids King's quirks, like repeating the same phrase in a jarring font over and over, which breaks up the narrative for me. Here he only uses a large boldface cap to indicate signs, and it is not too jarring or too repetitive. There are no spooks in the story - it simply explores the simple question of what one should do with a private doorway to 1958, and the pitfalls that could arise.<br /><br />The story is a clever take on time travel and changing the past, with rules that prevents paradoxes. Jake has to overcome an inertia of the past that resists pivotal events from being altered, and the costs and consequences of making changes are well thought out. How far do you go to save the world?<br /><br />What if a crippling event shaped you into an extraordinary human being? Should you avoid it? You can ask the same question about a nation.<br /><br />A fascinating read.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I've been waiting for another mystery game like Grisly Manor. This was very fun and challenging. It worked flawless on my Droid X.  How about another one?
B005HSG3VK|5.0|If you've got a Kindle Fire, you need one of these, IMO, to protect it and keep it clean without dramatically increasing it's overall form factor.  A high quality, durable and functional cover that your Kindle Fire will be right at home in.

0061537934|5.0|This book has so much heart. Denny goes through so many trials and the outcome of his consistency is inspiring. Definitely added to my all time favorites and a MUST READ. The story will change the way you view things. This book is best read by mature ages (17+).
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Giving two stars instead of one, because the quality of the writing/stories is good. But the book is really bad, and unfortunately, still long like the previous books. Per another review here, this book is not what a person signed up for when starting the series. The story from the first books has been lost, and events are taken up by new characters, newly introduced, or elevated from minor to major characters. I've quit real reading and started skimming and skipping.  Perhaps Martin had in mind the lore of Tolkien, the Silmarillion or such, in creating background stories for everything. The problem is that while Tolkien's world had background and side stories, you don't have to read them to enjoy the LOTR trilogy. The LOTR stands as a continuous, well structured story, even while drawing on the background stories Tolkien may have had in mind in creating his world.  Martin has also lost or discarded critical story lines along the way. The Starks are scarcely involved in the story. Maybe fine if this were real-life history one was reading, but not if one has invested time and energy in reading and getting involved in a story someone is telling. Even real-life history gets revised for story telling to make it more interesting. It is as though a history of JFK, in its third volume, includes tales of Chelsea Clinton going to college. Killing off a character unexpectedly does serve to make the tale exciting and unique, but killing off a character shouldn't end the story being told.  The brother/sisterhood of the direwolves? Apparently it didn't mean anything. Per Ned Stark, the pack that stays together survives, but the pack seems to have disappeared, along with Ned's head. And sadly perhaps, the heart of the series.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I have had this watch now for 3 days. It has kept near perfect time, despite what some reviews have said. It is still within two seconds of when I set it three days ago. I do agree, it is a bit on the small side but will work great as an everyday watch. I think a woman could eaisly wear this watch without it looking too big. I was looking for something thinner to fit under long sleeve winter clothes anyway so this will work nicely.  The band is acceptable and should hold up for a while. I would prefer it to be a bit wider, but I believe the size of the band/watch is consistent with the military style they were going after.  I purchased mine from ebay. It came with everything it should including a nice box and \\"pillow\\" and basic instruction manual all for $80 shipped.  I am tired of replacing batteries in my watches and have decided to start getting automatic watches. I will be looking at more Seiko's. So far very happy with this one.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I looooove this game. really is a lot of fun to figure out. scenery is also quite beautiful. kudos to Fire Maple Games. looking forward to future games from them.
B005JLN9Z8|5.0|The better it gets.  At this point I now enjoy the songs from this album more than the first one.  I don't care if the songs are \\"serious\\" or not, they sound awesome.<br /><br />Steel Panther gives me a small glimmer of hope for the future of music.  In this world of autotuned pretty boy no talent pop stars lip syncing their \\"concerts\\" (and superbowl halftime shows) to boring repetitive soft sissy lyriced music, Steel Panther still rocks.  That really comes through on this album.  Michael Starr is one of the best vocalists around, and the lead guitar Satchel is criminally underrated.<br /><br />If you ever get a chance to see them live, do it.  Easily the best rock concert around, you can tell they love what they do.  And unlike some great bands that sound awful live (looking at you Guns), Steel Panther sounds just as good live as they do recorded.

1416955070|5.0|I knew City of Bones was going to be an amazing book before I even started it. I have read the Infernal Devices by Cassandra Clare and I just fell in love.<br />The Mortal Instruments and The Infernal Devices are said to be companion novels, so the idea of the story remains the same, just different setting and characters. I will honestly say that I loved the characters in this book, more than The Infernal Devices.<br />I really love Clary. I love that fact that she's an artist, like me. I really like how she isn't shallow, and how she is a strong character as well. She is a smart girl, and thinks for herself. What I liked most about her is that she didn't like two guys at once (like how it was with Tessa in The Infernal Devices), Clary stuck to one, and I really liked that.<br />Jace is okay. I guess he was just too similar to Will in The Infernal Devices. I guess I'm just a bit tired of all those bad boy characters. Though he's nice and all, and I do like him, but I guess I'm not just all gaga.<br />The story is very interesting as well. It grabbed all my attention, from  the beginning, and especially to the end. I was also very shocked towards how Simon was allowed to blend in with them as well. Even though he was not a shadowhunter, he stayed with them and helped them, which was pretty cool because i really like Simon.<br />I'm really happy about this book, and I really do want to read the second book. With all the books i have on my TBR list, I hope i can fit \\"City of Ashes\\" in there somehow!

B006HGXGWU|5.0|Hard to believe that this film didn't garner a Golden Globe or Oscar nomination! The performance of Michael Shannon (Curtis)is simply amazing. He's a quiet blue collar worker, displaying increasing paranoia as he has visions of an impeding apocalypse. Or is it a slow descent into mental illness? Even as his family and world are falling apart, Curtis calmly tries to make sense of incomprehensible. The story moves slowly but builds to a stunning but ambiguous finish. This movie will stick in your soul for days.....easily my favorite film of 2011.

B00479SVBU|5.0|I was looking for something to allow me to play music from my phone on my car stereo, but other FM transmitters I tried were weak, giving static and local broadcast stations overriding the FM transmitter.  This device doesn't have that problem.  No static and it sounds like the device is plugged into the car stereo.  I found that using an SD card with music to be a better solution as I don't have to get my phone out of my pocket and plug it into anything every time I get into my car.
B002BWP49C|3.0|Well, what else can one say?  Nobody here seems to be having much fun, what with all the grim gloomy weather and creatures and conflicts and angst.  It is, however, more entertaining than the last two were.  Bella's dad is as gloomy as ever, Jasper has maybe one line, Rosalie has suddenly become nicer, Bella's pals get short shrift, Jacob learns how to deal, and Bella and Edward welcome their new monstrosity--oops, I mean baby--by the end. There is also a major change for Mama Bella.  The music and locations are great, though the wolves always looked cheesy to me.

B006HGXGWU|5.0|You have to wonder, as the characters do, if the man is truly mentally ill or if he really is seeing apocalyptic visions and no one else is.  This keeps you guessing till the end, and even then, you are not quite sure what is happening...but in a good way.  It lets you ponder the situation and you truly feel for the characters and what they go through.  Nice work from all involved.

B000UX6THK|4.0|What a mind bender. Twin Peaks is one of the strangest and most innovative TV shows ever made. It is lurid, eerie, surreal, terrifying, quirky and absorbing. It is an odd little saga with odd components, including the usual mundane stuff and the paranormal - along with strong performances that make it all work. It is a genius mix of soap opera, parody, mystery/detective show, and horror film, all thrown together to create something insanely complex, surreal and entirely original. It is symbolic, it is insane and it is tragic.<br /><br />It is symbolic, it is insane and it is tragic. The brilliance of this show lies in the fact that it can completely parody and mock its characters at one moment, and take them and their feelings completely serious the next while at the same time creating an unexpectedly terrifying and somber mood. The tragedy surrounding Laura Palmer's death is palpable and heart breaking, resulting in the show creating an emotional resonance that reveals that Lynch is not to be taken lightly. This show will make you sit down in amazement, trying to figure out what Lynch was smoking and how you could get some.<br /><br />Lynch and Frost wanted to mix a murder mystery in the form of a police investigation with soap opera elements in order to create a series that was scary and sexy, funny and decadent, mundane and surreal. The mystery of who killed Laura Palmer was going to be the main plot element which - over time - was to gradually recede to the background as other townsfolk and their stories were unfolding. In fact, the murder was never really supposed to be solved, as was actually done half-way through season 2, and the aim for Twin Peaks was to expose the gruesome underbelly of the Leave it to Beaver and apple-pie America.  Thus Twin Peaks was born and the rest, as they say, is TV making legend.<br /><br />Laura had secrets and around those secrets she built a fortress that no one seemed able to penetrate.  Everytime she tried to make the world abetter place, something terrible came up inside her and pulled her back down into hell, taking her deeper and deeper into the darkest nightmare and everytime it got harder to go back up to the light. As FBI Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan), with the help of Sheriff Harry S. Truman (!) (Michael Ontkean) and his local law enforcement team set out to solve Laura Palmer's murder and get to the bottom of those secrets, they also tap into the lives of these seemingly ordinary townsfolk who each harbor not only great secrets of their own but also entertain severe dysfunctions on a multitude of levels.<br /><br />It is interesting how Lynch took that picture of the prom queen with the perfect smile and the small, sleepy town she was living in and painted all black over it. As the audience gets to know the people of Twin Peaks and Laura Palmer, it becomes clear that there were terrible secrets and a dark facade hidden underneath that perfect smile and those sad haunting eyes.<br /><br />Twin Peaks is as much about the mystery of this surreal, secluded town, its eerie, mysterious woods and its lurid characters as it is about the life of an American teenager having lost her bearings, entangled in a web of deceit, drugs, promiscuity, crime and sheer terror.<br /><br />By creating Twin Peaks, Lynch ventured into creating a soap opera but of nightmarish proportions. At times it is light as air and mundane, at other times it is terrifying and sinister. We are introduced into a beautiful and sleepy small American town that has, beneath the surface, crossed over into a very real nightmare. As the narrative of Twin Peaks unfolds, we become intensely drawn into the lives and drama of its multifaceted characters and realize that while there is an element of terror in there, there is also familiarity; a bizarre kind of reality that cannot be described easily but can always be felt when entering the world of Twin Peaks.<br /><br />With the revelation of Laura's murderer and the resolving of the main story arc less than halfway through Season 2, the pace changed and the series seemed to drag on a bit only to meet an unsatisfactory cliffhanger ending. Some of the characters began behaving in a way designed to service an extended plot instead of the plot responding to the characters. It was like they let out all the air at once and then suddenly they had about 12 episodes to go with nothing to do, since, after all, the show was mainly about Laura's death and the mysterious circumstances under which she died.<br /><br />The truth about who killed Laura should really have come last, not half way through. The connection Lynch drew between the evil that is lurking in this town and its woods, Laura's death, the concept of the Black and White Lodge and Coop eventually being inhabited by Bob, were brilliant and everything fell together, but the order should have been reversed and the revelation of who murdered Laura and the demise of Cooper should together have made for an explosive finale. Lynch blamed network pressure for the decision to resolve the Palmer storyline prematurely.<br /><br />The possible romantic relationship between Cooper and Audrey was also never resolved and instead they had him more than half way through season 2 fall in love with a random girl named Annie Blackburn (Heather Graham), Norma Jenning's sister. It was an abrupt deviation from a story arc that had so naturally developed over time and was just awaiting its conclusion.<br /><br />The official story for why they did not pursue the romantic storyline between Cooper and Audrey was that MacLachlan himself had objected to the idea because he believed it would have been out of character for Cooper to be falling for a teenager. But the reality seemed to have looked differently, as reportedly Lara Flynn Boyle (Twin Peaks' Donna Hayward), who was dating Kyle MacLachlan at the time, objected to co-star Sherilyn Fenn being paired together with MacLachlan in a series of romantic scenes, especially considering their considerable on-screen chemistry. Boyle seemed to have been further irritated by the fact that Fenn's character Audrey was gaining prominence in the storyline while Boyle's character Donna was given little to work with and had gradually been moved to the background.<br /><br />In a recent interview Finn recalls that David Lynch, by creating Audrey, had \\"made a character that got bigger than his original characters that were the important characters [in the show]. And those girls were not happy about it [...] this was supposed to be the Lara Flynn Boyle show.\\" Finn's increasing popularity on and especially off screen as well as the immense chemistry she and McLachlan had, were apparently too much for Boyle to handle and so it is believed that she pressured McLachlan to convince the writers that a romantic relationship between Cooper and Audrey was out of the question.<br /><br />Of course,  it would not have been out of character for Cooper to have fallen for Audrey; he was only a few years older and it was obvious that he had already fallen for her throughout the show, so following through would have just followed the natural course of how things had been set up. Whatever the reason for it, the abrupt ending of Audrey and Cooper's romantic relationship and the introduction of random love interests for both was probably the worst misstep of the series, creating a disconnect.<br /><br />You might also want to consider reading [[ASIN:1451662076 The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer]], which is a haunting and chilling recollection of her life from the age of 12 up until shortly before her death at 17, telling us, in her own words, about the shattered life of a teenager entangled in a web of deceit, drugs, promiscuity, crime and sheer terror. I thought it was interesting to see that Laura wasn't the victim everyone thought she was but that she, in fact, was also strong and had a dark side to her, with dark desires, that most people wouldn't think a teen like her does or should have. Twin Peaks is as much about the mystery of this surreal, secluded town, its eerie, mysterious woods and its lurid characters as it is about the life of an American teenager having lost her bearings.<br /><br />The ultimate question Twin Peaks poses, and never answers because that is not Lynch's style, is what is that mysterious, evil that lurks in the woods, or the soul of men; is it insanity or evil? What even is insanity, what is evil? When we say someone is a schizophrenic, like the One Armed Man in Twin Peaks, what does that really mean? Did people imagine BOB? Can anyone believe BOB existed given how fantastic the circumstances surrounding his presence seem? As Agent Cooper said \\"is it easier to believe a man would rape and murder his own daughter?\\" Is it more comforting calling it that and expressing it in terms we understand?<br /><br />Twin Peaks is all about that little space - the line between insanity, evil and the surreal - the very fabric of which things are made, secret kept, actions towards each other informed. because what really is the definition of evil in relation to the human condition? When someone commits an evil act, while others never break the law their entire lives you wonder what separates the latter from the former. Is BOB, as Major Briggs suggests, just the evil men do?<br /><br />In this saga David Lynch is showing us - in his very own peculiar way - that there is more in heaven and earth than is dreamt of in our philosophy...

0930289234|5.0|A brain-joltingly awesome tale of superheroes and superpowers in an untidy, morally gray world.  The dialogue is superb.  The story is deep, multi-threaded and more than a little bonkers.  The linework is so precise, so expressive, as close to perfection as human hand can approach.  Ditto for the phenomenal coloring with its excellent contrasts and eye-popping palette that's not quite candy-bright.<br /><br />I can't believe it took me THIS long to discover WATCHMEN!  There can't be many comics out there like it, line and color and word swirling so smoothly together to form a thing that is just . . .

0374275637|5.0|In my role as a senior executive, I have always had a fascination with thinking and performance. In this case, I was interested in the two categories of thought that the author presents. The first category seems somewhat similar to that detailed in Malcolm Gladwell's, Blink.

0061703087|5.0|This book, like all of Crichton's great works, makes one question humanity's future as science continues to make amazing, though sometimes scary, advancements. Will man make machines that are so smart that they will turn on us? You may not enjoy it as much if you don't have at least a passing interest in science and medicine, as some of the explanatory \\"scientific\\" passages are quite lengthy and detailed. But I found this to be another of Crichton's very enjoyable, fast-paced thrillers!

B004LWZW7E|1.0|First off, be clear that this film unashamedly states that its time economy system is actually \\"Darwinist Capitalism\\", quoted from Weis; the million year man, although there is nothing free-market or capitalist about it as in the film they can apparently just raise prices and no other business/person steps in to compete by selling the same goods for less, pushing back down prices. No, this film with all it's ridiculously preachy anti-capitalism and cliched lines is really about the danger of a big government who has the power to control markets, business and people be it big socialist/open society or fascist (tho I'm sure the maker of this film would vehemently disagree). Other times this film is simply ridiculous with its glaring plot holes and unbelievable moments. Examples include: 1. They meet a roadblock of at least 12 armed men with automatic weapons and drive pass and through all of them unscathed 2. Apparently while noone ever ages due to genetic engineering, everyone dies of what looks like heart failure when the clock on their arm runs out, but the film never goes into any real depth explaining why and since it's stopped when they transfer this \\"time\\" why doesn't anyone go create more of the stuff that's stopping death and solve the problem or if it's a programmed death (as one can infer), why don't the protagonists/others go get the death gene removed/fixed? But no that would apparently ruin the painfully flawed premise and strongly anti-capitalist tone and metaphors if one introduces logic and the fact that in a capitalist/free market system some entrepreneur would invest to start a business to find, create and sell a cure and customers would buy the cheapest, most effective cure offered. The constant preachiness throughout the film is grating but don't just take my word or interpretation, read some of the quotes as they are: \\"This is merely survival of the fittest - Darwinist Capitalism. Natural Selection\\" by Weis, \\"I worked out how to escape\\" Leon \\"andnow you want to make sure no one else does\\" Salas, \\"All they have to do is keep raising the cost of living\\" Salas (you know government printing money, raising taxes and burdensome regulations might have alot more to do with this than \\"evil\\" businesses), \\"Does everyone from the ghetto steal?\\" Sylvia \\"Oh that's rich coming from you! Let me guess, now you like the idea of sharing?\\" Salas (the rich got so by offering goods/services of value that people decided to buy, when did that become stealing? - only if capitalism ceases and government forces people to buy a product or service / prevents other companies from competing), \\"He was killed for giving away what he won... for giving them hope\\" Salas, \\"Taxes and prices go up so people keep dying. How else could there be men with a million years when most live day to day?\\" Hamilton, \\"If you guys are looking for stolen time you should arrest everyone here!\\" Salas (at fancy party), \\"For a few to be immortal, many must die\\" Weis (the rich generally do not become rich by stealing from or killing their customers, but creating something that will improve people's lives / people want). And sick justifications for robbing people and banks to give to some other person like \\"Is it stealing if its already stolen?\\" and \\"Don't think of it as stealing, think of it as repossession\\" Salas. Terrible, the pretty faces and tense running to save mother/love interest scenes are the only things that gave enough entertainment to bear it. At least I can save you the time.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I think the author did a fantastic job telling the life story of one of my heros. I knew a lot about Steve Jobs going into this book and this book served to fill in the gaps in my knowledge and offer me some tantilizing tid bits that I'll never forget. I thought this book was huge when I first started but it zipped along and I was sorry when I came to the last pages.<br /><br />I thought the interviews and quotes from Jobs were fascinating. The fact that virtually every one of his family members was also interviewed was amazing to me. The book continuously held my interest, but I have to say there were some gaps. I suppose those gaps were necessary for some reason but I could tell things were missing and that was unfortunate.<br /><br />Finally I felt the book was complete enough. It certainly told the story of his life and the book even moved me to tears at times. I have been an avid Apple product person since the first Mac in 1984 and Jobs even made me a fair bit of money though my purchases of Apple stock over the years. In fact, if it had not been for the revolution of the Apple computers I don't know where my career might have faltered and taken me. I'm very happy to have read the book and I think Issacson can pat himself on the back for such a rich and telling biography of a man that was hard to know and changed the world so much for the better. Thank you for writing it.
0812977246|3.0|I liked Gorky Park, but I found it somewhat confusing and rambling at times.  I did like it enough that I read the next two in the series, and I have to say that I adore the main character, Arkady Renko.  He's just a wonderfully wry and complex protaganist.  I also find it amazing how the author is able to portray life in Russia during different time periods.  I do highly recommend these books--but if you find yourself slogging through Gorky Park a bit, keep going!

1451627289|5.0|I just finished this book today, and I was enjoying this story so much, I did not want to see it end! Some disclosure upfront: I am a huge fan of Mr. King, and have read many of his novels, plus dozens of his short stories. Up until \\"11/22/63\\", my favorite Stephen King book was \\"The Dead Zone\\", but I think I have a new #1 after reading this.  Any fan of Stephen King is already familiar with his writing style. Yes, he probably uses too much foul language, but when I read his works, I always feel that I am listening to a close personal friend. King is of our generation, he is \\"one of us\\" - I get the feeling that if I really met him, I would feel very comfortable talking with him.  You can see many of these qualities in the protaganist of the novel, Jake Epping - a regular guy from modern times, who is thrust back into the past. You see the world from the late 1950's/early 1960's through Jake's eyes, and as you travel with him, you feel like you experience it also. Comparisons of life in that era vs. today's era are constantly brought up, and are very humorous at times. Since Jake is essentially a \\"good guy\\", you want him to suceed, and you don't want to see him hurt. He makes contacts and relationships in the past, and you really feel for the character as he tries to do the right thing, because he is a \\"good guy\\".  As the title suggests, the plot concerns the JFK assasination. King obviously did his homework on the details of the facts surrounding this event, but the book is not a history lesson, even though you will learn a few things.  The ending was quite satisfactory, and the whole experience had me wishing for more  If you like a great adventure story, filled with emotional character studies of likeable (and some unlikeable) people, then I heartily recommend this book! You will not be disappointed

1619491761|4.0|From \\"Mansfield Park\\" by Jane Austen: \\"I believe there is scarcely a young lady in the United Kingdoms who would not rather put up with the misfortune of being sought by a clever, agreeable man...\\" Every young lady except Fanny Price, that is.<br />I thought \\"Mansfield Park\\" was different from Jane Austen's other, more popular novels. For this reason, many readers do not like the story as well, but I truly enjoyed it. Instead of desperately searching for a wealthy husband, the main character searches for her own values and true, non-financially-advancing love.<br />The main character, Fanny Price, is adopted by her wealthy aunt and uncle in order to ease the financial burden of her poor parents. Here she is given a proper, upper-class education, but does not receive equal treatment with her female cousins. She is casually disregarded and mistreated by her aunts and is ignored by her uncle. However, she finds solace in the friendship of her cousin, Edmund, who goes out of his way to comfort and protect her in his capricious home, Mansfield Park. Years later, Fanny finds herself in love with him, but Edmund still treats her like a little sister. When a \\"worldly\\" young lady catches his eye, Fanny believes that all hope is lost. However, as time goes by, she becomes more beautiful and people start to notice her. A rich young gentleman suddenly proposes to her, but she refuses him, still holding out for Edmund's love. Everyone around her is frustrated that she won't accept the gentleman, who is more than socially worthy of her. Even Edmund tries to persuade her, but she cannot bring herself to marry a man who she doesn't love and whose values she is uncertain of.<br />Though Fanny Price's character seemed flat to me in the beginning of the story, I soon grew to like her for all her shyness and modesty. She is not as \\"strong\\" as most of Jane Austen's other heroines, but she displays a faithfulness and honesty that I could not help but admire (although it seemed inconvenient to the story at times). Overall, I liked \\"Mansfield Park\\" very well and would read it again. The ending was not as satisfying as I hoped it would be, but I was pleased with the strong message that some of Austen's other novels seem to lack.nt to the story at times).

B00729GQ0A|5.0|Bottom Line Up Front: This is quite a stellar addition to the field of \\"fiction\\" as a whole, and there is certainly a wide, delicious range of worse things to spend your money on (And you would have still made an excellent purchase on thsoe). If that's all you care about, scroll upscreen and click that little orange button prompting you to \\"Buy Now\\".  Rebecca delights with her debut novel. She opens with an interesting, unique character with a host of pre-existing problems milling about in the background, few of which go unexplained (And those that do are as minor as any real person's unexplained issues). The action begins when Sophia (aforementioned unique character) 'finally' decides to take charge and tackle the problem of a tinnitus-like hissing in her head. It is then, and only then, that the plot does kick off, with Sophia stumbling into her destiny. The author offers a genuinely enjoyable twist to the classic traits and origins of Vampires, alters the traditional werewolf into something much more enjoyable, and, most importantly, does away entirely with the silly \\"Vampires and Werewolves at war\\" trope that seems to follow those two around wherever they go, as well as a take on the half-vampire, half-werewolf that makes sense instead of going the easy route and making them super-powered monstrosities.  Despite stumbling into a world she does not understand, Sophia remains a delightful, strong character whose actions have effects - and those actions are made almost entirely for the good of other people, even the morally grey ones. Her relationships with the surrounding cast of characters (Very few of which could be truly considered \\"minor\\" or \\"Just Supporting\\") are deep, organic, and portrayed realistically. She injects original supernatural beings into her world to add a dash of spice to the 'verse, and maintains a pace which had me finding it difficult to turn off my Kindle app.  There are a few scenes which, to be honest, feel almost like filler - stuffed into the middle with little reason or resolution, but as this is merely the first entry in what promises to be a fantastic series, I'm sure Rebecca will clear all that up soon.

B006E4QCXU|5.0|There is no screenshot ability.<br /><br />You cannot change background color.<br /><br />Other than these two features, this app is incredible.  I spend way too much time playing with this... so many patterns can be created by gathering all the pixels into one tiny lump and by pressing and rolling on top of it.  It's really quite spectacular.<br /><br />Add a screenshot ability and I'd be in heaven.  Also having a white background would be kinda neat too.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|I love this album, I could listen to over and over again and I actually have been. I feel like Lana wrote this album for herself and herself only. She said what she felt and what she wanted to sing about, unlike other artist who only make songs with no meaning as long as they go to the top of the charts(Rihanna, Katy Perry, etc). I think she's different and I like her way of singing. It obvious she's talking about the same person/experiences in most of her songs since there are a lot of repeats of things and it doesn't bother me. I'm glad she sings about what she likes. I've heard she might not make another album because she feels like she has said everything she needs to say in this album. Which kinda makes me sad but I rather have no album then one without meaning from her.
B005M0R524|2.0|Buy a different set! This one is not complete - season 2 is missing the last episode, Christmas Special! Unfortunately, the publisher failed to provide any info that the last episode is not included in this set . . .  Also - these is no information on the set box, the dvd boxes, nor on the discs themselves what episodes are in what box, and on each disc! We are talking some 14 episodes, plus extras . . . It would be helpful!  I suggest buy other sets, and check the list of episodes included! If there is one to check . . . :)  Otherwise - I'm still a big fan of the series. Not of the team that marketed this item though!
0812548094|3.0|I have both a hard copy and the kindle version, and while the story itself is great, the editing is horrible in the kindle version.  Repeated mix-ups of \\"than\\" instead of \\"that\\" (and vice versa), repeating of previous sentences, repeated words (had had, that that), and in some cases missing words (of, a, an, etc)  Again, good story, but the Kindle version needs editing bad.
B000063WDH|5.0|This is The Back Keys' best effort yet.  While their albums continue to display impressive skill & depth, this is my favorite album.  There's a raw energy & an edge that acts as a foil to their skill & competence as musicians.  Unadorned & effortless.
B005EHNPRO|5.0|excellent, this product arrived on time, very accomplished and in perfect condition. Thank you. excellent, this product arrived on time, very accomplished and in perfect condition. Thank you.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Believe it or not I just found about this girl like a week ago because I realized that her record was about to being sold in a record store here in my country. So, I did my research after looking at the album cover (which I found pretty nice... but that's because Lana is on it... she's gorgeous!) here on Amazon, listened to the track clips and the first thing that came to my mind while listening to most of the songs was Mazzy Star. For some reason, Lana's voice flirts on memories that Hope Sandoval's voice kept in me for many, many years. When you look at Lana you can't imagine that this girl could take her music seriously. She is so charming and naive when you listen to her talking but actually, when it comes to her songs, she's so convinced on leaving a good impression in every track for every soul that takes some time to listen to her record.<br /><br />The songs are hunting, addictive and beautiful all at the same time. \\"Born to die\\" is gorgeous and \\"Videogames\\" is so mellow but never boring. \\"National anthem\\" is without any doubt something that PJ harvey could write down when she's in a good mood and \\"Blue jeans\\" a tune that she might've stolen from Mazzy Star's notebook. (just kidding of course but the comment was necesssary). Here there's no Lady Gaga's circus and freaks nor dumb-boring pop a la Britney Spears. If you give this girl a chance to listen to her record you'll be surprised on how a young girl like her can make something bigger and greater.<br /><br />Now, I wonder if she can match things up with \\"Florence and the machine\\" in a near future. A though task to accomplished for sure. Also, I would like to comment on the following: when you open the CD fold, you'll see Lana's picture looking paintfully gorgeous... I LOVE her lips on this picture. You'll see.
B0073CNGCC|5.0|I watched both season one and two over the weekend!  It was great!  Can't wait for next season.  Wonder why I had never heard of it before?
B0063GORYU|4.0|This game is great to pass the time. It is free, has no real bugs, and commercials are not bothersome.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have read many many Stephen King books and love love them! But this one was unlike anything he has ever written. I just wanted to say that he proves that he is an awesome storyteller period!!! It doesnt matter if it is horror, fantasy or alternate history...he does it and does it FANTASTIC!! The story itself was interesting and hooked me..and it ended the only way it could...and did it with grace. Thank you SK for yet another great story...until next time.
0312641893|4.0|I've recently changed the way I rate book: from now on fewer books will get 5 stars.  This is because there are GREAT books out there I read recently: Divergent, The Blue Sword, etc...  In short, this might have been rated 4.5 stars in the past.  The book is not perfect but it is an interesting plot and so different: a cyborg Cinderella who's a mechanic.  The place is New Beijing, etc.  Although I don't think anyone was surprised by the revelation in the end.  You will hate Adri, her stepmother and Pearl.  One thing I really dislike was page 368, but maybe that's more real than to expect a more diplomatic reaction even from an Emperor.  Sometimes, I feel like the story doesn't flow and certain aspect of it is weird, but I can't put my finger on it.  It is not a 5 star book, but it is engaging enough. It ends with a cliffhanger, not my favorite kind of ending.
B005NF2UE6|4.0|I am a fan, always have been. This album was a welcome after a few years of touring behind \\"Dark Horses\\". From the opening to the closing, solid output.  The only commen,t other than I enjoyed this album, was that it seemed like it was a continuation from \\"Dark Horses\\". Or, more specifically, the majority of the tracks sounded like they could have come from around the same time they wrote \\"Dark Horses\\". Maybe its just the nature of the way this flowed, or maybe it was something else. Maybe I am missing the mark entirely.  Either way, I enjoyed the album.
0062112430|5.0|I am fortunate to have 2 daughters that love to read.  We all trade books and compare notes.  My 13 year old tackled this book last Summer and gave it her stamp of approval.  I read it shortly after her and then handed it off to my 17-year old.  The older one is a very independent, intelligent young woman, immersed in her college selection process, ACT tests, marching band, wind ensemble, volunteering, working a part time job and already taking college classes her senior year of high school.  So when she made the time to read this book, then re-read it, then asked for her own copy for Christmas, I knew it was special to her.<br /><br />She proclaimed \\"Delirium\\" as her favorite book and says she still cries at the ending.  We already have the second book in the trilogy on order and cannot wait to see what happens next.  Delirium is well worth the read.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This game is so great. I had it on my I pod tocjlh and it was just not.the same.on the much smaller screen. the graphics look great and I love the addition of the multiple hit fruit(I dont know what it is called).
B005FPT51K|1.0|I ended up investing dozens of hours attempting to set the camera up. Never worked.  We returned it.. Where to begin with why...  1) When I was actually able to get a wired (plugged into my Internet router) connection, there was a delay. Right off the bat, THAT situation does not allow this to be a \\"baby monitor\\" at all!  2) Despite hours & hours reading documentation & speaking with customer service, we were never able to unplug this from the router, and so we could not move it to baby's room.  3) iPad connection never worked. App crashed.  4) we installed pc software & it was really \\"tech-y\\" and not user friendly  This is more like an \\"IP camera\\" and would be better as a vacation house monitor.... If you have a masters degree in computer networking (company told me to study up on something called \\"port forwarding\\" if I wanted to use this outside of range of our wifi router.
B005G4TJI4|4.0|The movie is exactly what I expected.  The feature film on both Blu Ray and DVD.  However, there are no special features with this edition.  From my understanding, there will be an additional edition of the movie coming out that includes 3-D and special feature discs.
0307887960|5.0|If you are serious about losing weight and want to reprogram your body so it does not need to diet ever again, this is the diet and book for you.
0307277887|4.0|It's exciting to imagine what the reaction must have been when author Jeff Lindsay first pitched the idea for this novel. \\"You want to build a book around a sympathetic serial killer and you expect the audience to actually connect with him?\\" But that's exactly what Lindsay has done.<br /><br />Dexter Morgan is by far one of the most memorable and interesting characters I can think of and Lindsay has done a beautiful job of bringing him to life. It's almost scary to ponder HOW Lindsay came up with some of Dexter's internal dialogue, but I'll leave that up to the psychiatrist. The result is a fascinating examination of the human condition that starts out with a nail biting murder in the first chapters. We're immediately drawn into the mind of a killer and taken along for the roller coaster ride that unfolds. For all his wicked ways, Dexter remains charming, charismatic, and downright hilarious at times.<br /><br />Lindsay also does an excellent job of painting vivid pictures in each scene. The imagery jumps off the page and we're never left guessing what we should be feeling because we're masterfully told in great detail. This is the mark of someone who is truly talented with words and has a good grasp for what's happening in the story.<br /><br />At times, however, this can also be the downfall. Some scenes become a bit too heavy with descriptions and I found myself skipping a few pages. There is also too much repetition from Dexter about how he's \\"not human\\" and doesn't understand human emotions. It almost reaches a point in which I'd recommend a revised edition that removes some of the references. Authors used to release updated versions of their books all the time so I'd see nothing wrong with making that edit.<br /><br />I did feel like things fell apart in the end, especially with the whole Detective LaGuerta storyline. It didn't fit. Again, I'd recommend revising it and there's no harm in doing that. But overall, this is a wildly original and surprisingly fun book to read, despite its dark subject matter. Somehow Dexter's personality makes it feel lighter and more enjoyable. I look forward to reading the next one in the series! My congratulations to the author.tter. Somehow Dexter's personality makes it feel lighter and more enjoyable. I look forward to reading the next one in the series! My congratulations to the author.
0440539811|5.0|If Wilfried Saetty made books instead of paintings, this would be the result.  This is the manifesto I didn't quite know I had; it makes lovely, hallucinatory sense.  RAW is no idiot, for all his idiosyncrasy, and the Trilogy is required reading.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This is a really good book when I got it there were no typos or anything. It is really gripping and any fan of the Percy Jackson series will love this book.
B006Y5EMHM|5.0|I watched the show for the sole purpose to see Raza Jaffrey but I have to say that I am quite impressed with the show.I will definitely be watching the premiere on NBC.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|wonderful app and easy to use. it will even read it to you. very cool. this is a must download for your phone.
0767803434|5.0|I love this movie! Harrison Ford and all the other actors were wonderful in this movie. I've had this movie on vcr for a long time and just ordered it in DVD. I love how Amazon is so fast and effecient with my orders.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|This unit blows my Mbox mini out of the water.  Low noise, great pre-amps and the thing works....unlike my Mbox half of the time.  The best unit for the money!!!
B0070Z4M4I|2.0|It kept along the story line of the 2 previous versions but christ it was set in Antartica and they were having day and night events like they were in Nebraska. Antartica for the most part is either daylight or night for months on end. When directors/producers do not even consider simple things like that it just makes a movie like this idiotic.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|This case fits my iphone4 better than any other case I have tried.  The simplicity of this case makes it look very nice and non-intrusive.  The screen protector that comes with this case is also really good.  It is not the rubbery sticky screen protector like I have had before but it is a hard plastic that fits the screen perfect and the cutouts are exactly correct.  After owning this case for a few days I really like the feel it gives the phone and it seems to protect the phone really well.  I really have no complaints for this case especially at the great price.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I think that this game is fun because it helps you when you are mad or really really very angry
0142407542|4.0|Our 4yr old really liked the Gruffalo and so we ordered this book too, seems to enjoy it but I don't think  quite as much as the first book. In saying that - its a good story following  behind the first book.  If your children liked the first they will enjoy this one too.
140525355X|5.0|I ordered these for my 4yr son, having grown up in the UK I knew about the Mr Men Series already - I ordered a couple of the christmas books to test the water with our son - he loved them and with that in mind I knew we had a winner.  The books arrived with no issues at all from the UK - and I presented these to my son who was so excited he was jumping up and down. He couldn't wait to get the books out of the box and start looking at them - of course we had to then answer who was who on each and every book - he goes to bed each night with a pile of books to \\"read\\" before he goes to sleep and one if not five of the MR Men are in that pile.  I highly recommend these books to everyone.
0385751060|5.0|Good condition. Good book. Good story. I think this is one of my favorites. I've only read part of it, so I bought it to read the rest. I can't wait to finish it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like this 101 in 1 game because its a real time waister. But, some if the levels are like impossible and I keep getting achevments for failing so many times. I have concured all the levels i have unlocked, except for one... the first level...its impossible...
1936850028|4.0|Tons of fun to read of Walt's history with the race and with ski racing in general.  I particularly like the reviews of the other Worldloppet races.  Walter conveys the solitary nature of training, travelling, and marathon racing fairly well, but I'd like to see the relationships more fully developed.  For many the comradery of the early morning car ride, and the post-race libations makeup for much of the training.  Also, the thrill of going right to the edge...of speed vs. control...of stamina vs. exhaustion and the fun factor of just being on snow serve as great motivaters to some and I'm curious what Rhein's take on these topics might be.  Perhaps in a future offering?  All in all a great read to get my mind in Birkie mode. I recommend it for racers and anyone that has a racer in their life.
0525478817|5.0|Hazel has been sick for three years, and she knows she's not going to get any better. When she meets Augustus Waters, everything in her life changes. Augustus is funny and vibrant and unexpected. The two bond over Hazel's favorite book, An Imperial Affliction, and before they know it, they're falling in love. Suddenly Hazel's life is a whole lot more than the falling action of an unspectacular novel.  John Green's latest book is absolutely brilliant. His characters are so realistic and down to earth, but fantastically memorable at the same time. Hazel is sick, but she tries not to let her illness define her. She's very funny and her gallows humor makes her a very accessible character--she's a teenage girl who doesn't take herself too seriously, not a heroically strong, righteous sick girl. Augustus livens up the book much in the same way he livens up Hazel's life. His endless humor, just-go-with-it attitude, and his metaphorical take on life and death are all so appealing. There are many literary references that drive the character and plot development in The Fault in Our Stars, but they flow just as naturally as the pop culture references, making the book unassumingly intelligent. The twist to this story is tragic, yet the book isn't a \\"sad\\" one. Like Hazel, who makes the funny choice when telling a sad story, Green makes a potentially depressing topic overflow with humor and life. The result is something achingly realistic and human.
0439023491|5.0|The book I ordered was in perfect condition. I couldn't put the book down, it was amazing. I finished it in one sitting.
0439023513|3.0|Similar to other reviewers, I was enthralled with Hunger Games, less so with Catching Fire, and finally, with Mockingjay I felt like I was being dragged through redundancy. I get that the brutality of war was a significant theme running throughout the trilogy, but in the end it boils down to telling an interesting story. Hunger Games told an interesting story with new ideas, and relatable characters. In Catching Fire, I felt like the author just wanted to develop her clever idea about the  clock layout during the hunger games. Catching Fire did little to advance the story begun in Hunger Games and I felt it was unnecessary - could have just gone to the third book from the first. During Mockingjay, we got more of Katniss going back and forth between Gayle and Peeta, Peeta and Gayle. This wavering went on for three books and Katniss never developed any self awareness - BORING! Maybe this boring psychological turmoil is appropriate given Katniss' relative youth and expected immaturity. It had the feeling of a \\"coming of age\\" theme but I never felt she came of age. I also grew tired of her constant tallying of what she \\"owed\\" to whom and how she felt she could never possibly pay them back. Another reviewer commented on all the briefly introduced characters in Mockingjay that were subsequently killed. Meet Team 451 - new characters who will be dead in 15 pages. Then there were all the creative ways the author came up with to kill people. She spent more time developing creative weapons than developing interesting characters. Maybe that was the point; in war, after a while, it doesn't really matter how people die, they will die, and the world becomes numb to the details, including the individual victims. If that was the intention, then the author could have spent more time developing the sense of grand loss. Instead she summed it up by saying Katniss' mother couldn't return to District 12 because of the grief she felt. Okay, whatever. There were other ideas that would havebeen more interesting to develop - such as Coin's role, fighting between the districts, Gayle and Katniss' changing relationship from childhood playmates to mature adults growing apart, etc. etc. Once I finished the Hunger Games I felt I needed to finish the trilogy; I wanted to see how it ended because I developed an interest in the characters. By the end of Mockingjay I didn't much care about the characters or the world in which they lived. The epilogue? Whatever. Katniss had babies (isn't that a requirement for a happy ending?) with Peeta, and the babies play in the pretty meadow that hides the mass grave of the citizens of District 12. Cue eerie music.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|great app....so helpful! I make all sorts of lists and notes. also helps that I can sync it on my phone and kindle.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Great to buy the complete set of HP blu-ray at one time!  This was what my daughter asked for for Christmas.  I didn't have to run around and try to find it in the stores.  Got it shipped to my door in plenty of time.  Thanks!
B0063IH60K|3.0|This is a decent game to waste time playing while I am waiting for words with friends to reply.  It also helps to pass time when there is not an open wifi available.
B0068RHSZO|3.0|I avoided Dream House in theaters because of the bashing it had gotten from the critics, so I rented the Blu-ray preparing for the worst.<br /><br />Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz turn in very good performances and there are more than a few twists along the way. I wish I had avoided the trailer because it gave one of them away. Just expect more of a thriller/mystery than a horror film. There are almost no real scares. I think most people will enjoy this one. Not great by any means, but it was a good way to kill 85 minutes tonight.
1592537251|5.0|With sketches from artists around the world, Gabi Campanario has made an important contribution here. This book is the go-to manual for urban sketching that shows the way of life of the urban sketcher through page after page of inspirational work. This is a must-have for anyone embarking on this fascinating and life-changing world of urban sketching, or for anyone (artist or not) who wants to treat themselves to a richly detailed visually eclectic trip around the world. To Gabi Campanario and all of the artists who contributed, thank you for this!
B005LAIGP0|3.0|The Woman in Black is a decent ghost story, but don't expect too much. A couple of loud noise jump scares. Harry Potter does prove that he can carry a film on his own. The atmosphere and set design are top notch, but the simple story is a been there done that. It is worthy of a rental, but check out The Changeling (1980) for some really creepy scares.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just like the original. The ads really aren't as annoying as the other free games  I would recommend this for any Solitaire fan. :)
B006UG90RM|5.0|It was worth the wait. The long wait is over for Van Halen fans and this will be album of the year! A+++
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote creates a fantastic way to organize your documents. you can create notebooks, whit h are great for school,<br />. your notes are datedso you can go back to notes quick and easy from a certain day. And you can connected to your computer or phone so you can access your notes from anywhere with wifi. i would def. recommend this app for people who tend to collect a lot of paper and students.
B0062KMDZ2|3.0|This movie is by far the closest I've come to a 3D experience.  Hint:  Things literally come as close as two inches away from your face.  This is probably due to the fact that this movie was actually recorded with a 3D camera, so it did not have to be reformatted.  The storyline, however, is very premature and cliche in the sense that it lacks the thrill of a mystery (at least to an adult, which, by that, I mean myself).  Overall, good choice for a 3D movie, but don't expect there to be a complex plot in this movie.  Thanks for reading!
B0050SYS5A|1.0|I simply cannot get the Kinect to stabilize when using this thing. Even after re-calibrating and everything the Kinect ends up having an incredibly hard time keeping track of your limbs, especially the legs. I tried this thing with Fruit Ninja and it thought my thighs were constantly trying to swipe fruit.  Another point is that using this device *will* change the amount of horizontal playspace you'll need. For example in Fruit Ninja you don't really need to move much to the right if you wanted to swat at the corners, but now with the zoom you might even need to take a step or two to the right to compensate for what the lens is doing.
B004LE7PCM|5.0|I aways loved the novels of Sherlock Holmes. Firts i read them in Portuguese(BR), and now that i got the oportunity to read them in english for 99 cents makes me fell excited to discover the master of deduction on his own language!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Wonderful and classic game. It has decent options for customizing the look as well as other game options. The ads are unobtrusive in the free version I play.
B005I6EVUG|4.0|Really like the durability of the cover - and the style!  Only thing I would like would be a zipper or closure for when I'm carrying it in my briefcase or bag.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|this film is deserving of an academy awawd, but won't get it because there are too many actors of color
B0067FGYGQ|5.0|This album is the excellent result of taking a wonderful songwriter and giving her the chance to work with a group of musicians who allow her to extend the power of music.  All the ingredients that made \\"Because I Was In Love\\" and \\"Epic\\" so good (SVE's hyper-personal songwriting and her unique voice as a singer) are here too, but so much more as well.  The opportunity to work with a wide range of musicians gives her songs even more depth and power. Sometimes, like on \\"Serpents,\\" she totally rocks out in a way that's astonishing compared to BIWIL. But there are still wonderfully quiet moments here, like \\"Joke or a Lie,\\" which ends the album on a beautiful note.  And her songwriting is even better -- look at \\"All I Can,\\" a song that slowly builds from nothing to a massive sound. But even with all that sound, her words still stand out: \\"Wanting to love as new as I can, Wanting to show I want my scars to help and heal.\\" Or on \\"Leonard,\\" where it takes the whole song to construct the final line, as if figuring it out herself as she's singing it: \\"I am bad at loving you.\\"  If you're already a fan of SVE, don't hesitate to get this -- all the emotional intimacy of her earlier albums is here too, but with a richer and bolder sound. If you're new to SVE, this is the perfect opportunity to check out a singer-songwriter who is definitely worth discovering.
B005RYF5JA|3.0|Regretfully I can't gush over 'Believe'.<br />It's just not as good as previous shows  -- my critique is aimed solely at the Producers, not the girls, who are wonderful.<br /><br />SONG SELECTION:<br />Too many of the numbers did nothing for me -- that's one man's opinion, subjective as it is.<br />Hopefully, in the fullness of time, one or two might grow on me.<br /><br />LOCATION:<br /><br />Why oh why did they record the concert in Atlanta?<br /><br />We can all agree that the Fox is a beautiful theater -- if you're doing GONE WITH THE WIND you couldn't find better.<br /><br />This is an Irish group, surely they could find another suitable location in Ireland?<br /><br />No doubt the girls sing just as beautifully in Atlanta, but outside of the Motherland you do lose a certain ineffable something.<br /><br />Maybe it's money, maybe it was cheaper to tape in Atlanta?<br />If it was a financial decision --  I've heard there are some nice theaters in Kazakhstan that rent for a song  (pun intended)<br /><br />Please, for goodness sakes, go back home for the next one.<br />I don't care if you tape the show in the Ladies Room of the Dublin Central Railway Station, just DO IT IN IRELAND !<br /><br />HOW MANY STARS?<br /><br />Has anyone else noticed that the number of 'stars' is going down ?<br />'New Journey' had 6 ( 5 singers + 1 ), 'Songs From The Heart' had 5, this one has 4.<br />Are the Producers trying to shave costs here too?<br /><br />With this sort of downward progression, how long can it be before they trot out our beautiful Chloe to do the show solo?<br />(and then I expect they will remind us that the name is CELTIC WOMAN, singular ! )<br /><br />Now just to prove I'm not 100% grinch, I must praise Management for their choice of Lisa Lambe ( Lisa #2 )<br />She's a ravishing stunning redhead with a perfectly enunciated angelic voice.<br />Were I only 20 years younger?  ( Okay, let's get real, 30 years younger.)<br /><br />PS: \\"Jumping the Shark\\" alludes toan episode from the HAPPY DAYS sitcom, in which Fonzie jumped over a plastic shark.  A critic later opined that the show went down-hill after that, and in fact it was cancelled not long thereafter.

B006UG90RM|5.0|After hearing the single \\"tattoo\\" I was totally pessimistic, I expected 3-4 good \\"b\\" side songs, however what I found were 12 amazing songs (tattoo is not worthy of this album).  I'm simply blow away by this album!  I've been counting the days since 1984 for another hard-heavy totally american style rock n' roll album to come out...and wouldn't you know it, Van Halen brought it back (I guess G'nR Appetite' shouldn't be overlooked, but you get my point)!  Buy this album, skip work for a day and blast it at loud as possible on your home stereo.  45 minutes of ridiculous riffs, solos, drums and even some outstanding bass.  WVH is easily as naturally talented as the rest of my heroes!  David Lee ROth's voice is pretty solid (I expected it to be weak, totally overdubbed, and digitized). I was surprised how heavy and hard this album is, some of the hardest riffs and songs they've ever recorded!  I can't wait for the show in two weeks, I'll be in the 15th row singing and (head banging a little) like it's 1984 all over again.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great app, but too many unexplained, very challenging games. I would recommend that they include instructions for each game. Lots of good games, though.
B006E4QCXU|5.0|This app is just cool. I love fractals too. I usually play this for a few minutes just before bed. I find being able to control the screen soothing.  Play with the Controls a bit,it's lots of fun.
0316010669|3.0|Blink is a fine work by the highly engaging author, Malcolm Gladwell. The premise of the book is, might it be that we make better decisions in the first few seconds rather than after hours or days of thinking about it? Well, it depends, but Gladwell presents convincing evidence why many decisions can likely be made nearly instantly. His writing is always captivating and his examples are convincing to many. This is a good book to read so long as you step back and consider alternatives and that more thorough studies are needed to validate his claims. A light read.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought this for my 20 year old boyfriend's birthday because he loves this kinda stuff and he loves it! Even I do! It is really fun, interesting and addicting. I highly recommend this toy for anyone of all ages! :)
1591844096|3.0|Linchpin is a healthy read for someone who hasn't thought much about his or her skills and their value to an employer or to others in general. This is a decent book for anyone interested in becoming a key component of a company. The ratio of rah-rah-rah to specifics is a bit too much for my taste but it is a good book nonetheless. This would be a good rental from your local library.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Always liked this type of game.....if you like games like Myst or Riddle of the Sphinx, buy this game, you won't regret it!<br /><br />Other thoughts, this is a great game and I was really disappointed at some of the poor reviews and low stars from children. Please, if you are reading this and you are a child, do not under-rate this game just because it is too difficult for you. It is not fair to the hard working, talented developers of this game.
0307949508|4.0|The Girl Who Played with Fire is the second book in the Millenium Trilogy. In it Lisbeth Salander, a smart but roughened by abuse young woman, is accused of horrific murders. It takes her friend, journalist Mikael Blomkvist, all he has to start solving the seemingly unsolvable case. This is a fine thriller but the reader is left hanging as the story continues in the third and final installment of the trilogy, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.<br /><br />The book is an improvement over the first one and it continues to expose the horrors of institutional rape and other abuse of the innocent.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|cool sweet very addictive. I love it. I think kids would love it fun game and very very addictive the best game ever
030726999X|4.0|The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest brings the reader to a very satisfying conclusion of the Millenium trilogy. We find out exactly who committed the murders that Salander was being accused of. We also get the satisfaction of seeing those who treated her with cruelty be brought to justice. The biggest criminal in the courtroom (no real spoilers here) turns out to be the government that failed her and that set evil people loose on her innocence.<br /><br />Readers unfamiliar with this trilogy will want to at least read the second book in the series, preferably all three.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

0765356139|5.0|There's one problem with a book that follows up the first novel in the series - in book one there was the Lord Ruler, and the impossible, convoluted task of ousting him.  And in the end, Kel and Vin and the rest of the crew were successful.  How is an author suppose to follow that up?  Even with a great idea, how does one create the same sense of suspense, the same sense of impending doom, as the previous book?  The answer - he doesn't.  But he does come pretty close.  There is no lord ruler, but there are 3 armies parked at the city gates all waiting for the right moment to attack.  And there's also a spy who could be practically anyone, leaving you to question all the characters motives.  This book's pacing is a lot slower than the first, a fact that seems to bug many of the reviewers.  I saw a couple reviews saying how dull the first couple hundred pages are.  The bulk of this book is about character development and about explaining how and why the characters develop as they do.  Vin battles with insecurities, Elend learns responsibility and what it means to be a leader.  We learn more about the world, the kandra, and the religion behind the steel inquisitors and the lord ruler.  And true, the Well of Ascension only comes in play towards the end of the book, but the title of this second mistborn novel seems to be really about the journey, spiritually and mentally, of getting there.  I give this book 5 stars.  It isn't quite as good as the first, in terms of how epic the first book felt and how impossible the task ahead of the protagonists was.  But, the author still did an amazing job keeping the story going and evolving it.  I can't wait to read the next novel to see how it all ends.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I grew up listening to Van Halen from 'Runnin With The Devil' to this day.  Amazing CD proving that you really can go back...'Chinatown' and 'Bullethead' could easily fit on Fair Warning and that is saying something...Eddies playing is just amazing.  I still cannot believe how hard this album is. Production is the same warm sounding thunder you grew up with...Daves wild vocals and sense of humor in full force, and Alex's cymbals are the ringing in your ears along with that familiar thunka, thunka...ting, ting, ting..Wolfie rounds out 'The Three Twins'.  A great return to form.

B006UG90RM|5.0|I grew up listening to Van Halen and vividly remember my high school days, hearing Atomic Punk or Eruption blasting from nearly every car in the parking lot. I also remember the thrill of picking up VHII and Fair Warning (and every subsequent album) at the record store on their first day release and finally seeing them in concert during the Fair Warning and Diver Down tours. Fast forward 30+ years later and lo and behold...I'm back in high school again. To say that Van Halen is back would be the understatement of the last decade.  \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" brings back that classic Van Halen sound we've all missed, dreamed  and prayed for during the Van Hagar years (and I don't even count that disastrous Gary Cherone experiment known as VHIII). Sure, the \\"Van Hagar\\" years produced some pretty solid music, but nothing compares to the one-two combo punch of Diamond Dave and Eddie's powerhouse screaming guitars. With songs like \\"Outta Space\\", \\"She's the Woman\\" \\"Stay Frosty\\" and \\"Chinatown\\", Van Halen brings back the carefree, fun-loving, womanizing rocking tunes that you partied to and blasted from your Alpine car stereo from your Dad's Buick. The album overall is absolutely solid, and exceptional with classic tunes throughout. After a period of hard living, wrong choices and bad mistakes, Eddie is playing with that same intense fire as in his youth..you can literally hear that hungry spark in his playing again.  Dave seems a bit hesitant due to age, but his vocals still growl and purr like the old days. Alex is solid as ever with that solid, rock hard VH beat. Even though Michael Anthony is badly missed and no longer a part of the mix, Wolfie Van Halen brings it on and is making his own statement in this band. To hear this band come alive from the dead...this is indeed a big surprise.  After a decade of a hard, depressed economic times, growing apathy, civil dissension, social unrest and distrust in government, business and authority, we need something to uplift ourspirits in this bleak, dour period.  Thankfully, Van Halen has delivered the goods and brought a \\"Different Truth\\", just in time. It's time to turn back the clock, forget our problems and crank it to 11 again!
B006UG90RM|5.0|Truly a great album is like the missing 1985 album.  has all the element we love of old school van halen, but Eddie is killer on the guitar he is the real guitar hero no doubt and Dave did a great job i really miss this guy. The only fault is the missing Anthony. anyway the kid play fine and alex like eddie  rules.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|but otherwise great. got it for my nephew to play with on rainy days and he loves it. great buy.

B00475AYJQ|5.0|This is one of the most engaging and well written novels I have had the pleasure to read. You really care about the characters and become invested in their lives. Behind all that there is the mystery of what has happened to get them all to this point. I can't wait for Day Three.
0321811984|1.0|I do a lot of PPT and was looking for a boost of my presentations.  This is way to simple - better for beginners and not great for B2B work. Ah well.  I like the idea - but one page graphics with one word on them is not what I need.
B006UG90RM|4.0|Normally, I would say that this album deserves 3 stars. It sounds \\"ok\\". It doesn't suck, it's just \\"ok\\". Then once you get to track 6 and onward, it keeps getting better. Suffice it to say, this album is a grower. The main reason I gave it four stars is because I was sick of Van Hagar and I don't consider the album with Gary Cherone to be Van Halen at all. Say what you want about the Michael Anthony gossip but to be honest, I'm ok with Wolfgang and Eddie playing father and son in VH. The chops are here. There's some old nuggets dusted off from the vault and there's also hope for the future. In the future though, I hope they get meaner with the riffs and better with the production. The first half of the album sounds more like demos than a long awaited Van Halen album. My favorite VH albums are Fair Warning and the first one. I hear a little of both in a few songs but not enough to feel completely satisfied. It's good but not killer. That said, it's the 21st century and not the 80's anymore. The live setlist will be killer and I sincerelly appreciate the boys for having balls to shed their differences and finally put something out.
030726999X|5.0|Great book. Read all 3 and was sorry they ended. also went to the movie for the first book dragon tattoo, thought the movie was ok they had to leave a lot out. I hope they make movies out of the next 2 books including this one.

6305907145|3.0|I really liked this movie other than they put in several unnecessary things that were NOT in the book. And it says sexual content on the content advisory, but nothing about nudity and they show nipple! Even if for a moment it's still there. The drawings of what happened with the slaves were totally uncalled for as well, NOTHING like that in the book! Other than all that I think it was pretty enjoyable.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I have been waiting for this album for 26 years. I lived and breathed Van Halen back in High School (music is never as important as it was in High School) and I never thought I would see the day that the Mighty Van Halen would return. I am in amazement that they have come back with a monstrous disc that is all I could have asked for. It is 1986 all over again in my mind, but I can now erase all the disappointment and sadness I felt when they broke up. The links in the chain have been reattached. Thanks guys!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great App that makes staying on top of Bible reading easy. Works well on Kindle fire. Huge variety of reading plans. Very easy yo use.
0307719774|5.0|I really love this book! It's a great journal. What you do is you write in it every day for five years. After you finish one year, you flip back to the beginning and start answering the questions again. You'll be surprised to see how much your answers change and what about you remains the same. Each question provides a few lines for you to answer on so there is a limit. Also, I like that the questions aren't TOO personal or dirty...I wouldn't mind if someone were to stumble upon my book and read it. But I'd still prefer them not to! If you are curious,  recomend this book highly! If you go into it knowing these few things that I've mentioned, I don't think you will be disappointed...I wasn't! :)

The artwork was beautiful, the music was soothing, the puzzles were challenging and yet not so difficult that I couldn't figure them out.  The difficulty level was just enough to make the game last long enough to satisfy my craving for a great puzzle adventure.  Please keep them coming!

B0062NAVXA|5.0|Everyone is a critic these days.  Yeah, yeah.. so the acting isn't top-notch, although I thought they did a pretty great job and I've seen worse (can we say Russell Brand???).  My husband, kids and I really enjoyed this movie and its message.  It is an excellent and timely message to fathers to \\"wake up\\" and be present in the lives of their kids.  The message can work for moms too but the movies focus was definitely for fathers.  I'm not sure how one could give this movie a negative review, unless, of course, you don't want fathers to step up and take an active role in their family and children's lives.  Um.. yes, please (raising hand), I'd like to see more of that!  I'm lucky enough to have a husbadn who already takes a very active role in the lives of our children and our marriage, so I am fortunate but my heart is saddened when I see other wives who do not have that same support.  This was a touching movie that urges all of us, particularly dads, to make the most of your time and plug into your family.  Do you REALLY know your kids?  Do you REALLY take the time to listen to them?  Do you REALLY know what their thoughts and opinions are on the world around them?  Definitely a movie worth watching!
B003MC5N28|4.0|I thought this book was interesting and I liked it, but I never understood why everyone loves it so much. It's a good read, but not a must read.
0439813786|5.0|All my life, I have always chased after the award winners, those books that have been validated by some establishment as good.  I remember trying to justify liking the Caldecott winners better than the mere honor books.  In late elementary school, I tried to read all the Newberry award winners I could, checking off from a poster I had.  Even recently, I have padded my reading list by searching out Hugo and Nebula award winners.<br /><br />_The Invention of Hugo Cabret_ is just such a book, the winner of the Caldecott Medal.  That, however, is not why I read it.  I read it because they made a movie out of it, I guess that's just another sort of establishment validation.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed it as  a piece of art and a meditation on the process of telling stories.  The story is not too complex and can be roughed out quickly: kid's orphaned, gets in trouble, finds magic inside himself along with a surrogate family.  It is archetypical, with details thrown in - Paris, trains, early cinema, automatons, magic acts - but nothing out of the ordinary.  Perhaps it is the mundane nature that sets it apart from other kid's books.  The magic is in reality and not in some outside force.  If that's there, it isn't too heavy handed.  Even though the story is simple, it is for lack of a better word, interesting and good, but not overly didactic.<br /><br />The interplay of the art and the story is what makes the book a singular work of art.  The exposition is in text, but the pages and pages of wordless, rough-ish black and white drawings  move the action forward. The best way to describe it is cinematic, in the style of early soundless films (I think that is the point, but I've been known to be pretty obtuse about this sort of thing).  There's' a reason they made a movie about it, but after reading the book, I question the film's necessity.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great game, totally a great game for family fun. plus its great for any age and easy to understand. for sure a game I play a lot. what else is there to say, download and have fun
B004N44SOI|5.0|I sampled a couple of tunes before buying this cd and I must admit it really rocks.  The production is great as are the arrangements. My only question is who should get the credit for this album? While Nikki Sixx appears to be the \\"leader\\" of this group, is he? He's only credited with playing bass although he wrote or co-wrote the music. James Michael is the hero here. I guess we can just say they make a great team, so really . . . who cares? It's simply a great record. Buy it!!!!!
B005LLX582|3.0|THE TREE OF LIFE was released in U.S. movie theatres at the end of May 2011. It came about the same time as the movie BRIDESMAIDS. I know this because I was an extra in a car commercial at the time and several of the female extras on the set were talking about which movie they were going to see that weekend and I heard many comments like, &#34;Yeah, I've heard good things about BRIDESMAIDS and THE TREE OF LIFE, so I don't know which one to see.&#34; I didn't say so aloud, but when I heard these comments, I wanted to tell these women, &#34;If you're debating between watching BRIDESMAIDS and THE TREE OF LIFE, then you need to go see BRIDESMAIDS because THE TREE OF LIFE is not a movie you will enjoy.&#34; I'm pretty sure that most of the women went to see BRIDESMAIDS and that the only reason they were mentioning THE TREE OF LIFE is because they wanted to seem like they knew something more about film than they really did because THE TREE OF LIFE had won the Palme d'Or at Cannes and it's directed by Terrence Malick.<br /><br />THE TREE OF LIFE is a Terrence Malick film. That's something you need to know because Terrence Malick films aren't like other movies. Terrence Malick films are stunning works of cinematography and visual art. In that regard, they are incomparable and people who are serious about film often like them solely for that aspect. Terrence Malick films also usually have beautiful musical scores and if you were able to turn the dialog off and just listen to the film's music with the film's visuals, you'd have an amazing visual musical combination. It is largely because of these two things that Malick is considered a genius.<br /><br />However, Terrence Malick films aren't like other films, so in addition to gorgeous cinematography and moving musical scores they also really don't have much of a plot. For instance, THE THIN RED LINE is about WWII, but it's unlike any war movie you'll ever watch again. THE NEW WORLD is supposed to be a love story between John Smith and Pocahontas, but if you watch it for romance or action, you'll be bored out of your mind.<br /><br />If you know all of this ahead of time and you still haven't been turned off by it, you might enjoy THE TREE OF LIFE.<br /><br />The film revolves around Jack O'Brien, portrayed as an adult by Sean Penn and as a child by Hunter McCracken. Flashing back and forth between the present and the past (and possibly the future), Jack wrestles with an internal struggle as illustrated by a line from Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Castain), &#34;The nuns taught us there were two ways through life - the way of nature and the way of grace. You have to choose which one you'll follow.&#34; Jack had to decide as a boy becoming a man which path he would follow and as an adult it is a choice he has to make everyday.<br /><br />In addition to those already mentioned, THE TREE OF LIFE features Brad Pitt in the role of Mr. O'Brien. Pitt makes a great 1950s father. He's got the look and moves down perfect and reminded me of old 8mm films of my own grandfather.<br />The movie has some dinosaurs which is pretty cool, though they don't seem to add anything to the plot.<br />I can't say I enjoyed THE TREE OF LIFE, but I did appreciate it. I did really like the concept of nature versus grace and felt the film did a decent job of getting across the power of grace over nature (aka sin).<br /><br />Overall, if you like Terrence Malick movies or if you like art films, you will probably like THE TREE OF LIFE. However, if you've never seen a Terrence Malick movie or if you don't like non-linear movies with very little structure, you're probably best skipping THE TREE OF LIFE. It's pretty much for film aficionados only (and many of them don't like THE TREE OF LIFE).Smith and Pocahontas, but if you watch it for romance or action, you'll be bored out of your mind.<br /><br />If you know all of this ahead of time and you still haven't been turned off by it, you might enjoy THE TREE OF LIFE.<br /><br />The film revolves around Jack O'Brien, portrayed as an adult by Sean Penn and as a child by Hunter McCracken.

B005QJZ5FA|5.0|If you haven't heard of Lana Del Rey by now, then you've probably just crawled out from under a rock (we have a black President now, by the way...)  Lana has garnered a pretty loyal fan base over the last year following a string of popular Youtube music vids from her EP.  She has also come to the attention of many others (myself included) more recently following an SNL performance that garnered much negative attention, including tweets from the likes of has-been actresses Juliette Lewis and Eliza Dushku.  Everyone waited with anticipation for the release of this album to see if she could put the money where her pouty mouth is.  And I think she more than paid off!  The album is a love-letter to fans of trip-hop and lushly orchestrated ballads.  Lana is a vocal breath of fresh air, eschewing the auto-tune that is the current bane of the music industry.  And the tracks are varied enough to not get stale, and as I mentioned, well orchestrated and multi-layered.  It's a sonic delight that compels multiple play-throughs.  It's been awhile since an album has dominated my player as much as this one has.  I've listened to it nearly exclusively over the past week, and even the few tracks that I didn't like at first have become favorites!  The album opens with the four songs that comprised her EP from 2011.  BORN TO DIE, OFF TO THE RACES, BLUE JEANS, and VIDEO GAMES.  To me, these were all fresh as I never heard the EP before.  OFF TO THE RACES is an album favorite of mine, and is frankly the reason I finally decided to download the entire album.  VIDEO GAMES, of course, is the song she will be forever identified with (until she tops it, anyway).  And it is indeed a fantastic and dark ballad, though I think the album boasts plenty of songs to rival it.  Following this is a handful of tracks updated from her previous recording sessions, and some new tracks.  Highlights include more trip hop goodness with DIET MOUNTAIN DEW, a Fiona Apple-esque ballad MILLION DOLLAR MAN, and theswirling (though profane) RADIO.  Through multiple listens, and putting pieces together from her interviews and biography, it becomes clear this album is meant as a snapshot of her teen and young adult years.  We see two sides of Lana here, singing about partying with her girlfriends on tracks like WHAT MAKES US GIRLS and in full Jersey Girl Twang with NATIONAL ANTHEM (\\"Gawd, yeh so hansum...\\"), and then covering more personal ground as the fragile, lovelorn girl who has loved and lost and fears being used, in tracks like the now infamous VIDEO GAMES and MILLION DOLLAR MAN.  Between these two extremes lay tales of how girls are used as sex objects ... stories of drinking, drugs, and the many other things teens do today to cope with their burgeoning adulthood.  Many of her critics brutalized her for their misconception of her as being a shallow artist singing about partying and nothing much else.  But there is much more depth here than appears at first glance.  I caught it at the end of the last song - Lana laments how she was taken away from her best friends in WHAT MAKES US GIRLS: \\"They were the only friends I ever had / We got into trouble and when stuff got bad / I got sent away, I was waving on the train platform / Crying 'cause I know I'm never coming back.\\"  Whatever happened during her youth, it ended with her parents sending her to Boarding school - and with this line, the entire album comes into focus.  It's a lament, a funeral dirge for her lost youth and the friends and loves she was forced to leave behind.  Which leads to the excellent (and seemingly overlooked) album cover.  Lana appears against a mostly clear blue sky with tightly coiffed hair and a white collared shirt, buttoned all the way up to the neck - an image that screams conservative!  She's all grown up now.  But then there's that red bra ghosting through - a reminder that she still retains that wild, party girl somewhere inside her.  You can take the girl out of the party scene, but you can't take away the party girl!  What a fantastically appropriate image for the album!  In short, Lana rode into town this year amidst a sea of insensitive critics who were more obsessed with her background and the size of her lips than her actual music.  Can anyone remember the last time a male artist was chastised for being fake or too handsome!?  Who was the last male artist who was declared a manufactured product of the music industry!?  It's a shame that in our current day and age, we still can't give women a fair shake.  Well, fortunately miss Del Rey has more than proven herself, and I look forward to more to come from her in the future!

B004ZN9W5M|5.0|Words can't really say how much I love this album, but I will try anyway.<br /><br />I was 9 years old when this album came out in 1979. I was only familiar with the single \\"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\\" at first, and I played the '45 until it cracked (literally). I remember the radio playing the entire album late one night (beginning at midnight) and I stayed up until 1:30 in the morning just to listen to the whole thing. Then, my older brother bought the 8 track tape. As some of you who are familiar with 8 track tapes might remember, if you play the thing too many times, the sound begins to warp. Well, I warped my brothers 8 track of \\"The Wall\\" pretty quickly. At that point, I had to resort to going to my friends house to listen to the album (he had the vinyl copy). I didn't get my own copy of \\"The Wall\\" on vinyl until my birthday in September of 1980. Hey, I was just a 9 year old kid, I had no money to buy my own copy.<br /><br />I don't really know what it was about \\"The Wall\\" that made me love it so much. Maybe it was all the cool artwork when you opened the record up (something you won't get if you buy the MP3 version). Maybe it was the theatrical nature of the album (\\"The Trial\\" was one of the weirdest things I had ever heard). My young ears were blown away. To this day, I can still listen to \\"The Wall\\" and never get tired of it.<br /><br />There are numerous classics on this album. \\"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2,\\" \\"Mother,\\" \\"Goodbye Blue Sky,\\" \\"Young Lust,\\" \\"Hey You,\\" \\"Comfortably Numb,\\" and \\"Run Like Hell\\" are obvious ones. For me, it was \\"Side 3\\" of the record that I loved the most. Starting with \\"Hey You\\", a beautiful, haunting ballad sung by David Gilmour that builds to an emotional climax with Roger shouting \\"Don't tell me there's no hope at all! Together we stand, divided we fall!\\" Next up is \\"Is There Anybody Out There?\\" which has one of the most moving, somber acoustic guitar solo I have ever heard. \\"Nobody Home\\", \\"Vera\\", and \\"Bring the Boys Back Home\\" all flow together beautifully, and you can feel real, deep emotion in Roger's vocals. \\"Comfortably Numb\\" ended side 3 on the vinyl version, and this song is truly Floyd's masterpeice. The guitar solo at the end ranks as one of the best ever, by any band.<br /><br />I'll be seeing Roger performing this album in just a few months. I was too young in 1980 to catch Pink Floyd's performances of The Wall, but I knew people who did go, and I felt so jealous. Now, 32 years later, I will finally get my chancebeautifully, and you can feel real, deep emotion in Roger's vocals. \\"Comfortably Numb\\" ended side 3 on the vinyl version, and this song is truly Floyd's masterpeice.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. It's a wonderful layout, the amount of options: audio, different versions/translations is just great! I can read, listen, or both...in any version I choose. Everything is right at my fingertips with this download. 5 stars, my favorite app!
B004ZNA7WY|5.0|I bought this CD the first day it came out in stores, not realizing that this would be the last Pink Floyd studio album. As much as I would love to see Gilmour and Waters reunite and release another PF album, this is not a bad way to end. \\"High Hopes\\" is a great song, comparable to the \\"classic\\" Pink Floyd of the 70's, and if that is the last song on the last album, they've left a great legacy behind them.<br /><br />This is the second album without Roger Waters, and is far superior than the previous effort \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" (although that has some great songs too). Every song on this one (with the exception of maybe Rick Wright's \\"Wearing the Inside Out\\") is great. From the somber, bluesy \\"Shine On\\" style instrumental of \\"Cluster One\\", to the Roger inspired acoustic ballad \\"Lost for Words\\" to the Grammy winning instrumental masterpiece \\"Marooned\\", this is classic Floyd.
B005LZW8FO|4.0|What a nice surprise.  This little indi-film comes from director and co-writer Mike Cahill and his friend Brit Marling who also stars and co-wrote the script.  Ms. Marling is an up-and-comer to keep an eye on.  She plays Rhoda Williams, a brilliant high school student who is celebrating her admission to M.I.T with friends at a party.  On her way home she is distracted by the news of a new planet coming into view that is a carbon copy of Earth.  She sees the blue planet and can't take her eyes off it.  As a result she plows into a car carrying a university music professor, his pregnant wife and their young son.  The woman and boy are killed.  Young Rhoda (Marling) is sent to prison for 4 years.  I assume alcohol is involved in her prosecution.<br /><br />We pick up the story upon her release.  Still devastated by what happened to the family and her own lost future, she takes a job as a janitor in the local high school.  She also pledges herself to apologizing to the surviving father.  At the same time she enters a writing contest to win a trip to the new planet now called Earth 2. The planet is found to be a duplicate of Earth including copies of each person.  She sees this as a new chance at life.<br /><br />When she goes to John Burroughs' unkempt house, she chickens out on the apology but offers to clean his home as a \\"one-time\\" offer from a fictitious cleaning service she represents.  John is a mess.  He's not eating right, drinks a lot and is basically still in a deep state of depression.  Feeling guilty, she offers to return on a weekly basis, but this time gets paid $70.  She never cashes the checks however.  John doesn't recognize her because being a minor at the time her name and other personal information is not known.  Frankly this is part of the story that doesn't make much sense.  Would he not know her?<br /><br />In any case, John begins to regain his life and Rhoda begins to have feelings beyond just guilt.  While I don't think they are in love, they do get intimate and are moving in that direction.  When Rhoda actually wins the contest and the trip to Earth 2, John doesn't want her to leave.  She then must tell him the truth.  This doesn't go well as you would expect.  In the end, Rhoda has a better idea that seems honest if not in her best interests.  A little surprise in the last scene leaves the film open for continued discussion.  This film is really well done.  It isn't perfect but I was taken with the story and especially by Brit Marling.<br /><br />This is a Blu ray transfer which looks great.  There are some very interesting shots using defuse lighting on the interiors and a wonderful look of a New England winter.  The DTS-HD sound is distributed well but this isn't a traditional sci-fi drama so the surrounds are mostly used for the soundtrack.in that direction.

B004ZN9UZO|5.0|While \\"Dark Side\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here\\" were the more popular albums, I always preferred \\"Animals.\\" Very rarely will you ever hear these songs on the radio, and when I play the song \\"Dogs\\" on my car stereo, my wife looks aghast that there's a song that runs seventeen minutes long. These aren't 3 minute pop songs. These are lengthy, aggressive, deep and emotional prog-rock masterpieces built around the bookends \\"Pigs on the Wing (parts 1 & 2)\\"<br /><br />\\"Dogs\\" is my second favorite Pink Floyd song of all time (after \\"Comfortably Numb\\") and features some of the greatest guitar playing I have ever heard from David Gilmour. The lyrics are biting, with Roger focusing on the backstabbing nature of corporate greed.<br /><br />\\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" attacks the rich and powerful who Roger sees as a danger to society, and particularly, Mary Whitehouse, a british campaigner for morality and decency who had once attacked Pink Floyd's music.<br /><br />\\"Sheep\\" seems to be an attack on those who mindlessly follow their leaders with blind faith.<br /><br />This album is one of Floyd's defining moments, both lyrically and musically. This is essential Pink Floyd.
B005OCFHHK|3.0|I love the movies - but I hate the product.<br /><br />We've been told time and time again that if we just want to purchase the BD and not worry about special features, that this was the definitive item. But WB dropped the friggin' ball on this one. Big Time.<br /><br />No primary menus; it's a text block.<br /><br />These BD were culled from spare BD single film Special Editions. Most will list the film's name and denote \\"Disc One\\", when it is the third or fourth movie in the series. This was not a version made for casual fans. This is nothing more than WB redressing their over stock and calling it a new BD boxed set. Way to go, WB. Had you done it right, it'd actually be worth the exuberant price tag, even with Amazon discounts.
B004ZN9OTG|3.0|I remember when I first bought this album (on vinyl) many, many years ago. I was just a teenager then and the only other Pink Floyd albums I owned were \\"The Wall\\", \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\", and \\"Animals.\\" I thought Pink Floyd could do no wrong. Then I bought this album. \\"What the hell is this?\\" I said to myself after the first listen. I wanted to take the record back to the store for a refund. That was my initial reaction. Then I thought about it for a while and realized I should let it try to grow on me. Maybe I would get into it after repeated listens.<br /><br />It worked...to some extent. \\"If\\" and \\"Fat Old Sun\\" are the highlights for me. Both songs were performed regularly by Waters and Gilmour on their solo tours, so they must not hate those songs that much. \\"Summer '68\\" isn't bad, either, but not one of Rick Wright's best. The bulk of the album belongs to the two lengthy, psychedlic experimental pieces \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" and \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast.\\" \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\", other than some nice guitar work by Gilmour, just isn't very good. I suppose if you play the song in the morning while you're eating breakfast, it could work on some level as background music. \\"Atom Heart Mother,\\" on the other hand, is a lot better, with some great musical bits scattered about what is basically a meandering piece. It's not bad, but it pales in comparison to what they would do for the next album, \\"Meddle.\\"<br /><br />Is it their worst album? No. I'd rank it higher than the \\"studio\\" side of Ummagumma, and the soundtrack album \\"More\\". But it is far, far from their best.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|After I saw this movie at the theater, I knew I wanted to have it in my library.  At first I thought it was on the same level as the older one, however, after looking at this movie, I saw it was well written and the apes were superior.  Even though this movie was fictional, I do believe animals are intellegent and can be taught a lot of things, I mean even a parrot can be taught to talk.
B004ZNA5JO|4.0|In 1987, both Pink Floyd and Roger Waters released new albums. Roger released \\"Radio KAOS\\", which I felt was the worst of his solo efforts. It had a bad 80's production value to it, and musically it was weak.<br /><br />Pink Floyd (or, more accurately, David Gilmour) released this album, which musically is quite excellent, but lyrically weak. Gilmour has admitted that he's not a strong lyric writer, and while the lyrics here are certainly better than anything released by today's pop stars, it's not strong compared to anything Pink Floyd had released previously.<br /><br />One reviewer had previously stated that Roger \\"wasn't missed.\\" I feel quite the opposite. He certainly was missed, in the same way that Gilmour is missed on Roger's albums. These are two guys who NEED each other. They're the Lennon/McCartney of the band. To achieve the Pink Floyd that we all know and love, you need Roger's biting lyrics with David's awesome melodies and guitar solos. When they're together, it's magic.<br /><br />There's quite a few highlights here: \\"Learning to Fly\\" and \\"One Slip\\" are great, catchy pop songs. \\"On the Turning Away\\" is a nice ballad that builds to a fiery Gilmour solo at the climax. \\"Sorrow\\" is a heavy guitar driven classic. However, as good as it is, it doesn't really hold up that well next to anything Pink Floyd put out in the 70's.<br /><br />\\"The Division Bell\\", which came out 7 years later, is much closer to a true \\"Pink Floyd\\" album than this, and much better.

B004ZN9R6G|4.0|As a soundtrack album for a bizarre movie about hippies, I wasn't expecting this album to be as good as the albums before and after it (Meddle and The Dark Side of the Moon). I was surprised at just how many good songs are on this, including some real classics.<br /><br />\\"Childhood's End\\" is one of the very few songs during the Roger era that is written entirely by David Gilmour, and it's also one of his best. \\"Free Four\\" is a great song by Roger with lyrics that will soon echo throughout most of his later work (the death of his father.) \\"Wot's..Uh the Deal\\" is a very nice acoustic ballad that could easily stand next to \\"Wish You Were Here.\\" David Gilmour still plays this one in his solo shows. \\"The Gold It's In the...\\" is an up-tempo rocker that sounds completely out of place from the rest of the album, but it works. Even the instrumentals are pretty good here; Mudmen, When You're In, and the title track all sound like they could have been outtakes from Meddle or Dark Side of the Moon.<br /><br />\\"Absoulutely Curtains\\" ends the album with a \\"WTF?\\" moment. This is a good song to play very loud in the middle of the night to freak your neighbors out. It is arguably one of Floyd's worst songs. Overall, though, a very good, solid album.
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|First, I want to point out that I rented this movie to see Jack Black and Steve Martin together. Somehow I missed that it was themed around Birding.  With that said I loved this movie. There were lots of great moments that made me laugh. and I loved all the beautiful shots of the North American outdoors, and the many many birds.  Lastly, this was the first outdoors movie that I've seen in years that didn't have some sort of political slant.
B004ZN9NCY|3.0|If this were released as a live album only, it would rank much higher in the Pink Floyd catalogue. But since it's attached to what is (arguably) the worst Pink Floyd studio album, it sits on the bottom of my list.<br /><br />As a collector of numerous PF bootlegs, there are far superior live versions of the songs presented here. \\"Live at the Electric Factory\\" and \\"Interstellar Encore\\" are two good examples of the same material being performed. \\"A Saucerful of Secrets\\" for example, is truncated to only 12 minutes on \\"UmmaGumma\\", but the typical length on most bootlegs is 20 minutes. Had Pink Floyd just released a double album of live material, then we would have really had something here.<br /><br />The studio album isn't a total disaster, though. \\"Granchester Meadows\\" is a nice little acoustic Roger Waters ballad, and \\"The Narrow Way\\" has some good moments. Unfortunately, the rest is practically unlistenable.
B006362ZR6|5.0|This album is very good.  I have been waiting for new music by The Fray every since there last album was released.  I can say that this album was worth the wait. Their new sound is very good.  I like how the sound has a larger emphasis on guitar.  Piano like another reviewer said is still there though in the background.  Though the song Be Still is a piano ballad.  My favorite songs from the album so far are Be Still, Hearbeat (the first single), Run For Your Life, and I Can Barely Say. The lyrics for the songs are deep touching usual themes that the group has in their song such as love.  While one would think that this would be repetitive or grow stale, the group manages to keep it fresh. I would highly recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of The Fray; it is a day one purchase.
B004ZN9YNC|4.0|\\"The Wall\\" is my favorite album of all time, not just by Pink Floyd, but by any band. So you can imagine my anticipation when \\"The Final Cut\\" came out 4 years later in 1983. However, it wasn't quite what I expected, it was a bit of a surprise. Rick Wright is no longer there. David Gilmour's vocals are almost entirely absent from the record (with the lone exception, \\"Not Now John\\".) Even Gilmour's distinctive guitar work is relegated to just a few songs. It became obvious right away that this is almost entirely a Roger Waters solo album. But, if you look at it as a Roger Waters solo album, it's a pretty great one.<br /><br />There are a quite a few classics on this. \\"The Final Cut\\", the title track, is one of my all time favorite PF songs, and features a beautiful solo by Gilmour that could easily stand up to anything on \\"The Wall.\\" I'm not sure why this wasn't the song they used for \\"Echoes: The Best of Pink Floyd\\", rather than \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home.\\" \\"The Gunner's Dream\\" and the aforementioned \\"Fletcher\\" are also standout tracks. \\"Not Now John\\" was the big single, and it's the only true \\"rock\\" song on the whole album, and is nothing like anything else on the album. Roger's favorites from the album seem to be \\"Keep Your Filthy Hands Off My Desert\\" and \\"Southampton Dock\\", as these are the songs he seems to perform live the most, but these aren't really complete songs, they're more like segues into other, better songs. \\"Two Suns in the Sunset\\" is a good closer to the Roger-era Floyd, about the futility of nuclear war.<br /><br />I hope that the remaining members of Pink Floyd can reunite one more time to create a true, collaborative record, but if \\"The Final Cut\\" is meant to be Roger's last PF album and \\"The Division Bell\\" is Gilmour's last, they've still left a pretty good legacy.
B00479SVBU|4.0|Before purchasing I had never even seen a device of its kind. I watched a couple of online videos to get the idea.  In the evenings I load a USB drive with audio files from my favorite RSS news sources and the next day play them back during my commute. Pretty simple.
B004ZN9Q3K|5.0|In my opinion, everything that Pink Floyd released from 1971 to 1979 is a classic masterpiece. \\"Meddle\\", released in 1971, was the first of many classic albums to come.<br /><br />\\"One of These Days\\" and \\"Echoes\\" are the standout tracks, but the melancholic beauty of \\"A Pillow of Winds\\" also ranks up there with the best of Floyd. \\"San Tropez\\" is a nice little jazzy number sung by Roger Waters. Not one of his best, either musically or lyricly, but still fun.<br /><br />\\"Seamus\\" seems to be the only real throwaway song. Two minutes of a dog barking over some slow blues played by David Gilmour. Pink Floyd would use barking dogs to much greater effect on the \\"Animals\\" album several years later.<br /><br />Overall, a very solid album, with two \\"essential\\" Floyd masterpieces (with \\"Echoes\\" taking up one whole half of the album). I wouldn't recommend this as a first purchase, but it would definitely be in my top five.
B003VR5PPY|1.0|If you like slowly tapping the DS screen, you'll love this! All I did was tap through a LOT of text (and you can't speed through it), then tap on items in rooms to find clues.

When solving puzzles, there's a whole lot of text to inform you how to figure them out, so not sure why the puzzles are even there.

B000NQRE0K|5.0|I saw Braveheart when it came out in the theaters in 1995, and since then I've owned it on VHS, DVD, and now Blu-ray (Sapphire Series). I have been AMAZED at how good it looks for a movie that was made before DVDs were available to most people. I also recently bought the Gladiator Sapphire Series Blu-ray and I think Braveheart is even more impressive despite being several years older.<br /><br />It's so sharp in some parts that I feel like I'm right there with William Wallace. (it's not 100% like this -- maybe in 60% of the scenes -- there are a lot of scenes that are somewhat residual grainy, but any close up is always good) I've been having fun noticing all of the tiny little details they messed up on since I can pause in such high-definition on the blu ray (for instance, at Stirling when the cavalry is charging, there are a few frames showing Wallace and his friends with the spears raised and ready to go, yet Wallace is still saying \\"hoooooold\\" for another few seconds)<br /><br />There may be some additional features on the disc but I haven't checked -- I'm just restocking my best movies in blu-ray format. You won't be disappointed in this disc. I still have no idea how they took a 1995 film and made it look this great.

Until 1996 and the two classic tracks \\"Can't Get This Stuff No More\\" and \\"Me Wise Magic.\\" Now... in 2012... they are back, albeit minus Michael Anthony on bass and backing vocals but by all accounts Wolfgang - Eddie's son - is delivering the goods on this album.  The new album - A Different Kind Of Truth - just flat out rocks! But it does more than rock. It grooves. It has its funky parts. It has its typical VH comical parts and it has Eddie playing like a monster w/ the steam roller of a drummer, brother Alex, behind him. Roth sounds great. The songs - a mix between old demos reworked and completely new songs - are what every VH aficionado has been clamoring for for the past... well... nearly 30 years!  Buy the Deluxe Version - get the DVD - and settle back for some great, fun, rock & roll like only the classic Van Halen lineup can deliver. Well done VH! Very well done!

B004W1GD4A|1.0|The Revived Upstairs, Downstairs:   Entertainment as Ruling Class Propaganda  by Sean Gabb  On Boxing Night and the two next evenings, the BBC broadcast three episodes of a revived Upstairs, Downstairs. For those not aware of it, this was originally a costume drama made by London Weekend Television and shown between 1971 and 1975. Set in a grand London house, it showed the linked but separate lives of both the family \\"upstairs\\" and of the servants \\"downstairs\\" through the Edwardian age, the Great War, and then through the 1920s. Though made on the cheap, it has been generally regarded, on account of its writing and acting, as either the best or one of the best things of its kind ever made. It has been rebroadcast many times. It inspired at least one other series, Thomas and Sarah. Because it ends in 1930, and its world continued another nine years, room was left for a continuation, and many have always hoped that one would be made.  The problem, though, with sequels to a classic is that they will be judged with unreasonable harshness. I admit that most sequels are worthless in themselves, and only come to notice because of what they follow. But many have real merits that are overlooked in recollections of the original. I mention Thomas and Sarah again. This was no worse than many other light costume dramas. I think it sank so utterly and without lament because it was too closely identified with a classic that it could never match. It is with this in mind that I have waited a week before reviewing the revived Upstairs, Downstairs. Different actors playing different characters, the different tone of the late 1930s, different production values from those of the original - these and much else must be taken into account. The revival must be judged both in terms of what it continues and in its own terms.  I have done my best to be just. I have waited seven days. I have kept all the above in mind. I have made every possible allowance. But I am still forced to say that therevived Upstairs, Downstairs is very nearly as bad as it could possibly be. It is dull. It is badly written and over-acted. It is technically incompetent. Its whole purpose appears to have been to serve as legitimation propaganda for the present order of things.  In making this last charge, I think it will help to distinguish propaganda from bias. All historical fiction - all art, indeed - is biased one way or another. Materials must be selected. They must be arranged. Selection and arrangement will reflect a particular vision of the past, which is connected with the values of the writer. The bias of the original Upstairs, Downstairs is broadly whiggish. The past is admitted to have been a jolly enough time upstairs, and life downstairs often had its advantages. The overall message, though, is that the disintegration of the old order that accelerated after 1914 is not to be regretted. But, if I do not share this optimistic view of our modern history, I cannot denounce it as propaganda. It is a bias, but the resulting vision is honest enough to allow more than one perspective. Certainly, it has no visible bearing on how the characters are developed.  The most central character in the series is Hudson, the butler. He ties together the two different worlds of the household. He is an extreme conservative - indeed, a convinced and eloquent reactionary - always ready to call on God Almighty in defence of the established order. But he is never shown as unpleasant or as more ludicrous than everyone occasionally is. He can always be relied on to do the right thing. Or there is Lady Marjorie. So far as she understands its promise, she hates the twentieth century, and makes her opinion plain in episode after episode. She too is never shown as other than decent; and she is given a very noble death on The Titanic. In contrast, her daughter, Elizabeth, becomes a socialist and a suffragette, and she and her friends talk much about equality. This does not save her from becoming a sad and ultimately a pathetic character. We are invited to share the whiggish view of life in and around 165 Eaton Place. At no point are we presented with a choice between accepting that vision in full and switching channel.  It is different with the revived Upstairs. Downstairs. This is nothing but propaganda. It lays down the view that the 1930s were an evil time, and that they were redeemed only by the \\"Good War\\" that followed them - the war that is the foundation myth for the politically correct managerial state of the present. No departure from this view is possible. No considerations of honesty or common sense are allowed to stand in its way. Characters are developed and judged according to how they might, after 1939, have welcomed or deplored the emergence of the new order. Moral notions that emerged only recently, and that are maintained as the consensus largely by threats of punishment, are projected backwards. And this is a significant achievement. Contemporary drama - Eastenders for example, or The Bill and most other police serials - have long since been co-opted to the work of revolutionary change through cultural hegemony. Costume drama, though, has generally been left alone. It is not allowed to be openly conservative in spirit. But, so far as a different state of affairs from that of the present must be shown, it is often implicitly conservative. Taking control of a classic like Upstairs, Downstairs is far more important than - say - giving us another black woman police chief, or another exploration of paedophile cannibalism among the self-employed. By showing that what the ruling class would have us believe was accepted by men of good will in earlier ages, another escape has been closed off from the hegemonic discourse. To quote George Orwell, \\"He who controls the present, controls the past. He who controls the past, controls the future.\\"  Look at the characters in this revival. We now have a Sikh servant in the house. Of course, if not very often,Indian servants had been coming here with their employers for about two centuries. And one of the characters has lived in India. But a Sikh menial who can type and play the piano, and who is fluent in German, and whose regard for his employer's interests goes beyond mere obedience to her instructions? Is this really an attempt to entertain and inform? Or are the producers pushing against the outer limits of the cultural revolution?  We also have a Jewish parlour maid. Again, I have no doubt that Jews have become servants in gentile households - even German Jewish refugees in the 1930s who had, back home, been university lecturers. And fully assimilated German Jews, married to Communists, might still have a total aversion to pork. This character is a little more likely than our turbaned Renaissance Man, but not much more so. Her only function is to remind us why all the nice characters are already set on war with Germany. She is there to make anti-Nazi speeches and scream abuse at the Mosleyite chauffer, and then to shamble with the Sikh round the edges of the Cable Street riot. Once she has done all this, she is surplus to requirements. There is no need to explore any depths to her character, or give her any further part in the action. After about twenty minutes in the second episode, she is allowed to fall down dead in an asthma attack.  She leaves a secret daughter behind her. Though the girl has never been a member of the household, I have no doubt that Lady Marjorie would have had her brought in, so she could be jollied along with kind words and a pat on the head, and then sent off to be taught needlework and other duties befitting her mother's last occupation. In this Upstairs, Downstairs, she is brought into the house to live above stairs, and much of the third episode is taken up with competing efforts to settle her future. Unlike her mother's contribution to the plot, this does lead somewhere. It allows the gentleman of the house to learn that he has a mongol sister shut away in an asylum - and this lets the producers tick another politically correct box.  A box yet to be ticked is the butler. He is almost certainly a homosexual. I did think for a while that he would try for a pass at the pretty footman. But, while some regard was apparent by the third episode, the full sharpness of Cupid's arrow may have been reserved for a future episode. Instead, he delivers his employer's baby in a lavatory while everyone else is listening to Edward VIII's abdication speech. The cook does nothing very reprehensible in the episodes shown last week. But she is a chain smoker, and this surely means that she has to turn nasty in due course - perhaps she will inform on the butler when he tries to kiss the footman.  Staying with the butler and his accomplishments, there is an oddity about his past. He says that he spent 27 years working for Cunard. He then says that he drove an ambulance on the Western Front. Leave aside what gynaecological skills he might have picked up in France - what was he doing there? One of my grandfathers worked in the 1930s on the cross-Channel ferries. On the outbreak of war, he and all his fit colleagues transferred as a matter of course to the Royal Navy. I find it unlikely that any seaman would have served out the Great War on land. This may be an oddity that will drive a future episode. I suspect it is merely evidence of poor character mapping by the writers.  None of the characters is either attractive or credible. Their motivations for what they do are at best too slightly given for us to care one way or the other. We can guess why the chauffer becomes a Mosleyite. We are not properly told why he stops being one. The young lady upstairs is given some motivation for joining him as a fascist. Her jump from here to running off to Berlin to worship Hitler is not explained. Why does Rose - the one surviving character from the original - stop running what looks like a profitable business to go back into service? Does she sell the business? Does she install a manager? Is her salary as housekeeper suitable compensation? We are never told.  Nor, except for advance echoes of the Good War, is there any overall theme to draw all the minor plotlines together. There is a crude attempt at using the Abdication Crisis to do this. But it only involves the family upstairs. And it is very crude. One test of quality for historical fiction is knowing how much information to give out and how much to assume in the audience. The original Upstairs, Downstairs invariably got this balance right. Recall, for example, the approach of the Great War. Most people in the 1970s could be expected to know something of the July Crisis. Therefore, we are given a few passing references to the shootings in Sarajevo and the diplomatic chaos that followed. Otherwise, the various characters continue about their own business in a deepening gloom that they fail to understand. The most telling scene is a card game on an oppressively hot evening in July. No one mentions politics. Instead, we are given an image of a whole civilisation passing out its time between sentence and execution in a mood of grim triviality.  In the revived Upstairs, Downstairs, the characters bob in about out with news like messengers in a Greek tragedy. Anyone who knows about the Abdication is told far too much. When I put everything I did know out of mind, though, I found that all the laboured asides and sobbing telephone conversations did not make a coherent narrative. Matters are hardly clarified by the claim that Mrs Simpson is cheating on Edward with the German Ambassador. If this had allowed us to see more of Herr von Ribbentrop, it might have been an improvement, as he is portrayed as a fine pantomime villain. Sadly, the claim is made only as a crude attempt to centralise every plot round the approaching Redemption by Blood. Needless to say, the Abdication, when it finally does come, falls flat. Because they need to vary the scenewith a sudden childbirth - which also lacks human interest - the producers are probably aware of their failure.  In the original Upstairs, Downstairs, the servants' hall is made into a close community. This allows much light relief, and throws much additional light on the individual characters and how they relate to one another. It also enables moments of great drama. I think, for example, of the episode after Lady Marjorie has died on The Titanic. The household is still in shock. Suddenly one evening, Roberts, who had been presumed lost with her mistress, finds her way back to the house and is taken into the servants' hall. What follows is something that can be watched over and again without losing its impact. It takes first class writing and first class ensemble acting for those tears and pauses, and the words and images natural to someone of limited understanding, to create a more thrilling account of the sinking than any of the film versions.  In the revived Upstairs, Downstairs, the servants are shown a few times listening together to the wireless. There are a few rows. Beyond this, there are probably more revealing exchanges between shift workers in a branch of McDonald's. There is no creation of background for future drama. There is no commentary on or counterpoint to whatever is happening upstairs.  Indeed, several of the characters could be lifted out of the action for much of the time without any loss to the plot. The most obvious case of this redundancy is the housekeeper Rose, played once again by Jean Marsh. After the first twenty minutes are out of the way, she could be removed from every scene in which she appears without loss. Her only function, it is apparent, is to keep telling the viewers: \\"Look, everyone - I am Rose. Therefore, this really is Upstairs, Downstairs.\\" I hope Miss Marsh earned a lot from her appearance. I only wish she had insisted on better actors and more competent writers.  Yes, the writers are incompetent. I say that the originalwas made on the cheap. You can see this from fluffed lines and actors sometimes plainly lost on set. You can see it in anachronisms of street furniture in all the outside filming. You can also see it in the strange immunity from ageing that all the main characters enjoy during the 27 years covered. These flaws are wholly overbalanced by the quality of the writing and the acting. In the revival, money has been thrown in every direction but the writing of authentic dialogue.  Now, since I have had to give thought to this, I might as well say what I think about dialogue in historical fiction. If, like my friend Richard Blake, you are setting stories in the seventh century, there is no need to try for authenticity of words or speech patterns. The idea is that the narrator is writing in Greek, and the reader has been given a good translation from Greek. Ideas and words derived from the words of our technological civilisation must always be avoided. Therefore, no one should say that the temperature has fallen, or that his anger was fuelled by drink. Nor should he be too specific about times of day, or say that things happened so many seconds apart. No one before the seventeenth century could have used such language. But modern slang and obscenities are appropriate. One of Mr Blake's reviewers accused him of incompetence for using the word \\"shite\\", which is a moderately recent word. The reviewer misses the point. As said, the idea is that the reader has been given a translation from Greek. This means that whatever effect was created in the original must be so far as possible repeated in the translation.  It is the same with stories set in England before about 1500. The language of the characters would have been English - but a fairly remote English, and the pretence can be kept up of a translation. It is harder with stories set here during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Care must now be taken to avoid attempts at pastiche, which will probably fail, and might annoy an audience, but also to avoid obvious anachronisms of language. You can say, for example, that something was turned off, but not that it was switched off. I am not sure if you can say that a plot is discovered, since this word, though much used, had a slightly different meaning before the nineteenth century. And, though you will see it commonly used in The State Trials, you will only confuse if you describe someone with dark hair as a black man. Peter Greenaway breaks this rule in his film The Draughtsman's Contract. The dialogue is often authentic. I think I even recall a reference, never clarified for the viewers, to the Darien project. But I believe that one of the purposes of this film is to show the past as remote and largely incomprehensible. Mr Greenaway breaks the rules for a specific purpose. He does not change them.  Again, in my own Churchill Memorandum, I sometimes use anachronistic words and forms of address. But this is a fantasy set in an alternative 1959, and the anachronisms are deliberate.  For the periods covered by either version of Upstairs, Downstairs, the guiding principle is clear. References to things and persons now obscure, or disused euphemisms - earnest for homosexual, for example, or gay for a prostitute, even perhaps Unionist instead of Conservative - should be avoided. Otherwise, the words and speech patterns of the day should be reproduced as faithfully as possible. And there is hardly anything in the language of the 1930s that can perplex a modern audience.  Yet, in the revived Upstairs, Downstairs, I noticed these anachronisms:  \\"Everyone will touch their toes.\\" The use of \\"their\\" as a neuter singular pronoun may have a longish history, but it only became widespread after the 1970s. I do not recall hearing it as a very young child. I do not believe it would have been used in this manner in the 1930s.  \\"British Establishment.\\" This is a phrase that came into use at the end of the 1950s. Anyone in the 1930s who might have used it must be understood to be talking about some aspect of Church government.  \\"Workload.\\" This is an Americanism that was first recorded in 1946.  \\"Ideology.\\" This word would not have been used by an Englishmen of ordinary education until the Cold War.  \\"Under surveillance.\\" This is another Americanism. I am not sure when it was first used in native English, but I doubt if this was much before the 1980s.  \\"Resolve the situation.\\" This is a circumlocution that I do not think was in general use before the 1970s.  I do not think I am being pedantic. The rules I have given are sound. Following them should be a matter of professional pride. Producers who seem to have spent lavishly on getting the frocks right should have insisted on reasonable care about language. Then again, though money was obviously spent, I am not sure how much care was taken with anything. I looked several times at the high quality recording that I made of the series. I am convinced that, in the final episode, I saw three BS1363 power sockets. These were only introduced in 1947. Mrs Gabb is also sure that one of the light fittings contained an energy-saving bulb. Again, in one scene, characters are shown listening to We'll Gather Lilacs in the Spring Again, by Ivor Novello - a song written in 1945!  I might comment on what, apart from three seconds of men in skullcaps when the dead parlour maid is collected, is the total absence of religion from an age when this was still both important and prominent. But I think I have said enough. The revived Upstairs, Downstairs is not just unworthy of the original - it is an artistic disgrace in its own right. It even gives a bad name to propaganda. It shows the sort of contempt for the public that I like to think would have driven Stalin to distraction. That the BBC made it one of the high points of its Christmas coverage is further evidence of the cultural war it is waging against the English people and of how little it regards our intelligence.  I have not readany other reviews. But I hope they are equally hostile. I hope, furthermore, that the three episodes shown last week will have so displeased the viewing public that no more will be made. Beyond this, I will do no more than call once again for the BBC to be shut down on day one of a patriotic government, for its records to be burned, its copyrights disclaimed, and for all those working for it to be kicked into the street without pensions. It is the least these people deserve.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|I have had this headset for over a year now and it still works great! If you don't have a headset or surround sound you should definitely consider buying one because it will drastically increase your gaming! I bought these mainly for FPS games but they also work great for RPG's etc. You can hear footsteps way better with a good headset! Performance wise I would rate these a 5 star because it does exactly what I need it to do. As for comfort they lack quite a bit in my opinion. After a few hours of gaming my ears started to hurt but I eventually got more used to it. I play with them really loud so I'm sure that is also a big factor. The headband also irritates my head so I keep them on more loose to ease the pain. I can't compare these to other headsets because I haven't owned any but these do work really well.

It totally took me by surprise, I did not expect it to be that good. It started of as eroctic read, but as you continue, you learn that its so much more deeper than that. Christian is a sexy a** megalomaniac who has such a dark pass, that he refuses to let anyone get close to him or touch him until Anataisa comes along and starts to change the way he views himself and life. I can say so much more because I read all 3 already, so I know how it ends and I dnt wanna give too much away. MUST READ!!!!!!

If you have read any of Chelsea Handler's books prior to reading this book, it'll be a little difficult to accustom to Tina's different sense of humor, which also makes it hard for you to appreciate hers (Tinas'). I finished reading this book way long after I remembered anything from Chelsea's book and was able to laugh out loud a few times at Tina's different style for funniness. Not bad at all

0385737955|2.0|Watching the news lately and some of the horrible things that happen in our world might have colored my review of this book. I am a mom and read violence all the time in books. Yes I did read the hunger games and would compare this book with the last book in the series. The amount of violence, that is detailed and described, the despair and sadness, the fact that these are all children really disturbed me. I kept reading hoping things would look up and in my opinion they never did. I can't recommend this book to anyone and know that if children read it they will probably not be as disturbed by the violence as an adult might be but I don't want my kids having this kind of violence in their heads. This book is well written and there is no sexual content, but a small innuendo.

B006UIYXL8|5.0|J. EDGAR is a cinematic accomplishment of the first order! From the screenplay (Dustin Lance Black) as acted by a host of consummate actors and directed with extreme sensitivity by Clint Eastwood, the sum of the parts is an extraordinary achievement in presenting a portrait of one of the strangest men in history. The manner in which the life and deeds and personality are woven together presents as full an image of a man of contradictions, a man who planned to have his personal files destroyed after his death in order to maintain the iconic image he so desperately desired, is nothing short of a work of dedicated investigation on parts of everyone involved. And electing to tell this story through the ever-changing chameleon aspects of this bizarre man by shifting from youth to old age in a constant parenthetical manner was a stroke of genius.<br /><br />The rise of young John Edgar Hoover from a mother-favored child, through the emotional conflicts this mother worship produced, through the sightings of incidents suggestive of early 'Bolshevik' interference/threat in this country that Hoover focused on in his usurping power as the head of the newly formed Federal Bureau of Investigation, provides a background from which we can observe the morphing of this obsessed man. The act of staging press conferences around the Lindbergh case and the capture of the big criminals of the day were manipulated to give Hoover supreme power to investigate 'threatening people of interest' by wire taping, spying, etc. But all of this runs parallel to the personal story of Hoover's private sexual life. From his living with his mother until her death, to his incompetent attempt to force himself on the woman who would be his secretary throughout his career, to his bonding with Clyde Tolson who he chose to be his assistant and never was far from his side, to his final hours when Tolson though suffering from the residuum of a stroke was the only person Hoover could trust as Richard Nixon planned his destruction.<br /><br />Each of the incidents that highlighted Hoover's long career as founder and head of the FBI is presented well, but it is the de-mystification of Hoover the vulnerable man beneath the tyrannical façade that makes this film so extremely powerful. That is due to the script and the direction, of course, but it is also due in large part to the brilliant portrayal of this enigmatic beast of a pathetic man by Leonardo DiCaprio: he remains credible throughout and moves through the aging process and intermittent flashbacks to his younger days with complete ease and credibility. Likewise the performances of Judi Dench as his strange mother ('I'd rather my son be dead than be a daffodil' - her term for 'gay'), of Naomi Watts as his secretary who thwarts Hoover's initial awkward physical advances to become his lifelong supporter, and of Armie Hammer as Hoover's love interest Clyde Tolson acted with such a full range of emotion and subtlety that he is completely credible - these key roles are all of Oscar caliber as supporting roles.<br /><br />Eastwood's careful casting of actors for the roles of Charles Lindbergh (Josh Lucas), Eisenhower (Gunner Wright), Franklin Roosevelt (David A. Cooper), Harlan Fiske Stone (Ken Howard), Robert Kennedy (Jeffrey Donovan), Colonel Schwarzkopf (Dermot Mulroney), Bruno Hauptmann (Damon Herriman), Richard Nixon (Christopher Shyer), and Haldeman (Larkin Campbell) gives the audience the opportunity to catch glimpses of the people influenced by Hoover without stooping to caricatures.<br /><br />But in the end it is the slow dissection of the relationship between Hoover and Tolson that is the most powerful element of this film. The audience is left with little doubt that these men were, in truth, lovers without the expected obvious stereotypical activities and conversations. It is an act of greatness on the parts of all involved, and for this reason probably more than any other aspect of this huge film, this biopic deserves to be in the lineup for Best Picture of the Year.

B004EPYZSU|5.0|Very fun movie to watch and there were no plot discrepancies that I noticed.  I thought the title was corny so avoided it at the theaters.  Wish I had researched a bit further so that I could have seen this fun western movie.  Definitely a worth watching movie.

B0064NTZQ2|4.0|Ryan Gosling has had a bang-up year! Every major movie role he's taken on this year has received critical acclaim ([[ASIN:B003Y5H574 Crazy, Stupid, Love (+ UltraViolet Digital Copy)]]; [[ASIN:B0060ZJ7DA The Ides of March]]), especially this one. Let me warn any possible viewers that even though this is advertised like an action film, it is not; this is a drama that has moments of action. I said in the film listed above that Ryan Gosling is going to be on great actor status if he keeps up the pace he has. And with 2012's \\"The Gangster Squad,\\" it looks like he will. In \\"Drive,\\" Gosling plays the unnamed Driver who is a stunt driver by day, getaway driver by night. He is involuntarily involved with a mobster (Albert Brooks) and lives a simple, very quiet life, but things get complicated when Driver meets and falls in love with his neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan). Through extenuating circumstances, Driver finds himself assisting in a heist to help clear Irene's husband's debt to a gangster, but when things go majorly awry, the story really takes off! The drama is suspenseful (the beginning is one of the coolest I've seen in a long time) and constantly keeps you on the edge of your seat. Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn took a really good script from Hossein Amini (based on the novel by James Sallis) and made it great: a film that is not just good, but a philosophical, metaphorical story full of symbolism behind every scene (something Orson Welles loved doing in his films -- i.e., [[ASIN:B0050FXDDQ Citizen Kane (70th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition)]]). All around a wonderful film!

Truthfully, I cried all the way till the end.  My eyes were red and my chest was hurting. It took a month before I got over this movie.
B006UG90RM|4.0|It's real good.  WTF, how is it possible that these old guys did this?  As Rolling Stone says: \\"Against all odds, Van Halen has managed to deliver an album that genuinely measures up to the groundbreaking classics of its early years.\\"  It's guitar rock - which is not popular anymore. Thus, it's impossible to be Eddie Van Halen and have the music somehow sound even remotely 2012. It's just VH writing what comes naturally. They aren't trying to reinvent style or compete with today's music. Thank goodness. Just raw rock. It's fast, heavy and complicated. Almost a little like if Metallica was happy.  The album rolls on and keeps you engaged, then suddenly you're into a song that's a real star.  And that keeps happening.  As a matter of fact, I think there may be more star moments here than on older albums.  I feel as if I went into a coma in 1980 and just woke up today - and you played this album for me - I'd think this album was their next album in 1982.  But then again, there are unique and groundbreaking moments in it that would have actually sounded experimental in 1982.  It's almost like this album would fit in somewhere prior to \\"1984\\" - much like early stuff.  It's like they picked up EXACTLY where they left off.  THANK YOU THANK YOU!  This might actually be some Eddie's best guitar work.  The guy is on.  Some of the songs are so hard and fast they leave me breathless.  Awesome.  I've never paid any attention to the lyrics on any past VH album, and still don't.  I never looked at them for any kind of message.  I see DLR's lyrics just supporting or blending with the music overall like another instrument.  People talk about his wacky lyrics - and only then I realized how wacky the lyrics were on all the old albums too.  I haven't yet discovered a song that would have been the big radio hit back in the 80s.  Thus, I give the album an A-.  But aside from the album 1984 - they never really were hitmakers anyway - they were defined by the overall album as if it were one giant song.  Seriously this is a great album.
B002BWP49M|4.0|Ok seriously people its a vampire movie. Don't expect it to be great and don't expect it to be totally crap because you don't like the generation that is obsessed with it. It's just a vampire love story movie. There's nothing about it that deserves a page long review of why you love it or hate it. It's not going for an academy award. And seriously peeps if you thought it was fine but scared to say that please don't jump on the \\" twilight is gay\\" bandwagon.

0812550706|3.0|I must admit that I am but halfway through this book, but nevertheless felt like writing a review based on what I have read thus far.  I'll keep this short.<br /><br />I am not a sci-fi fan, particulary, but if a book is good then it's good.  This book is good.  However, it is a bit depressing.  The way they portray Ender, and the other children for that matter, is NOT childlike at all; but that is sort of the point, I guess.  They don't act like kids, or talk like kids, or think like kids.  At times, when the reader is in Ender's mind, the darkness that lies there is discomforting.  And the things that he does (as a six-year-old mind you) are equally terrible.  I think the author could have accomplished his goal without making Ender so violent at times.  Ultimately, he is a \\"soldier\\", but still.<br /><br />Also, there are numerous times in the book that the other characters speak in \\"slang\\".  However, it sounds NOTHING like slang at all; they simply eliminate words from sentences.  It makes them sound like very uneducated buffoons.  They are all supposed to be geniuses, by the way.  I found this rather annoying.<br /><br />All in all, it's a good book.  Is it good enough to have a cult-like following?  I don't think so.
B003L20ICE|4.0|This is a perceptive and intelligent film that anyone can relate to who has been married for a long time with kids.  It just happens that the parents are lesbians, both having accepted seed from the same donor.  First the son, then the older daughter, decide to meet him without telling their moms.  The donor dad, of course, throws a delicate system badly out of balance and conflict ensues.<br /><br />That is the plot.  The people underneath are acted with a delicate intensity that is so good it approaches real life, as only the best art can accomplish.  While very funny, this is not a comedy but a serious drama that I found  moving and thought provoking.  Allowing herself to appear splendidly middle-aged, Benning plays a tightly wound doctor, the breadwinner and maintainer of order.  Moore is the designated full-time mother, who is less together and feeling neglected by her spouse.  Their children are also realistic:  the elder daughter is responsible and brilliant, the younger son rebellious and a bit of a laggard who hangs out with the wrong crowd.  The donor father, Russo, is kind of a sensualist rogue, never settling down and entering mid life as a successful restauranteur.<br /><br />Without revealing the spoiler details, once Russo throws a spanner into the works, all the relationships are thrown into question.  Benning is threatened, but she plays it very down-stated, with faux pas and overly strenuous attempts to ingratiate herself.  Moore acts out, with devastating consequences.  The kids move from admiring Russo to shocked disappointment.  It leads to one of those great resolutions that is as unsatisfactory as it is realistic when it comes to long marriages.<br /><br />If the film has a point, it is that this is a family like any other, just with 2 moms.  I don't know if the point needs to be made, but it doesn't distort the drama in the slightest.<br /><br />Recommended with enthusiasm.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Saw the original theatrical version on DVD and the only thing I didn't like was no special features. I knew that, for a movie over 2 hours long, it should have something special. So, hearing about the extended version coming out later the same year the normal came out, I had reason to be excited.<br />I'll admit, I was a bit dissappointed that, for a movie this long, the extended (the longest) had only 16 extra minutes. Nonetheless, it was a great film to watch. From symbolism of early English takeover of Indian lands to a noticeable contrast between drab military areas and exoticly marvelous alien lands. The guy who plays Jake, I've noticed in other movies he's the star of, does a great job of playing a character with a dichotomous personality, playing a part of two different worlds, each being flawed in their own way.<br />Some seem to have quite a gripe about having one movie on two discs. I truly had no problem with this setup (like I didn't for the extended Lord of the Rings), it means less time being lazy and more time being active while watching a movie, even if just a little.<br />The special features provided quite a good bit of insight, though James Cameron forgot to mention, in one feature dealing with the story and the technology itself, that he knew the technology was ready when he saw Golum on LotR. Aside from that, I did enjoy all the features, most especially the deleted scenes and extended scenes.<br />Movie (in all 3 versions) was great entertainment, special features were great, the package itself was very nice, so it was worth the price it was at FYE.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very challenging but entertaining i can play for hours!! it can catch anyones attention from 6 to 84!! Have fun
B002ZG997M|5.0|Before I start on the movie, here's a short list of people I know that's enjoyed this. Me (I'm a Christian, but I refuse to be religious, no matter what the status quo says), my brother (who's a nihilistic agnostic), a former boss of mine (who's borderline agnostic/atheist), and a couple friends of mine (anywhere from Christian to atheist to skeptic). None of them had anything bad to say, no matter how overt the Christian themes were. No matter how obvious the Christianity was. And they never felt preached at, nor felt this was religious propaganda at all. Why? I don't think it was only because there were a couple dozen f-bombs and other such swearing, heavy amounts of brutal violence (including decapitations and dismemberments), and references to taboo issues even churches would be extremely uncomfortable talking about, let alone dealing with.<br />Story wise, by this point in time, everyone knows what it's about, so I'll skip that and go into more technical details. Like something I noticed rarely comes up in other people's reviews- there's references to cannibalism (never explicit, but if you know human biology, you can notice it) and systematic manipulation of religion (something that dictators throughout history have tried using the Bible for, just to control the masses- just look at the Inquisition and the Catholic Church in the Medieval era).<br />Action wise, this movie does provide plenty of heavy action. From the (forementioned) decapitation and dismemberments to crazy gunplay and even a rocket or two thrown in for good (and eye-popping) measure. From the visual style, the people who worked on this (who also worked on Boyz in da Hood) did a real good job at the visual filter to make sure it didn't look like every other Hollywood film (meaning too realistic and next to no actual artistic value), and a couple visual allusions to specific art styles and known portraits, but mainly by the name of the style.<br />As for this \\"religious propaganda\\", I don't see any, and I am, in no way, religious. Just because someone protects a Bible, I suppose, means it's Churchey propaganda. Yet if he were carrying a Bhagavad Gita or the Sutta Pitaka (dealing with Hinduism and Buddhism respectively), no one would care. But atheists forbid that it should be the Bible (let alone the New King James version). Seems like a non-issue compared to the overall feel of the film.<br />I can say that, even as a huge fan of heavy action-oriented films and (actually good) Christian movies, I am proud to own this movie.<br />Still, to this day, my agnostic brother, who has no interest in religion, loves this movie.m, in no way, religious.

B001FB4W0W|3.0|Halfway through this season, I actually felt like giving up if the next episode didn't improve at all. It did, so decided to go on. The murders all felt, in the beginning, like a slowing progress. Even though the introductions to the characters were decent, I did enjoy the cameo by Jim Beaver (who plays Boby Singer in the CW's show Supernatural) in the beginning of the first episode. Besides that, things were far too convoluted and nonsensical for me until the later half, then it got better. But only by some. It had some decent twists in the end, yet I still didn't really feel all that satisfied until the twist ending in the last episode, but only then, I was hoping for some major improvement in the second season.<br />Not even the special features helped me enjoy this season any better.

B005NPLXJ4|5.0|This is a great Lou Reed album. Metallica is a great back-up band for Lou, as good as the Palladium shows (\\"Rock and Roll Animal\\" who can forget Prakash John...?). It's not for Metallica fans, maybe, but for those who don't like it, your kind of ylistener didn't like \\"Berlin\\" or \\"Metal Machine Music\\" or \\"White Light White Heat\\" either. It's an old story for some of us.
B006UG90RM|4.0|I am a huge VH fan, have been for 28 years. This album sounds like  Roth era albums,however, the abscence of the creative friction between Roth,Eddie and Ted Templeman is profoundly evident here.The songs are missing the flow  and dynamics that all VH songs era 78-84 ,w/exception of a few, did. I blame the producers and Eddie for this,( I'm sure he had a lot to do with the production)  Edd is a genius song writer and guitar player,however,he is an awful producer as we saw with the VHIII album.  I feel Dave prematurely comes in  early in some songs,  drowning out  the guitar riffs that already are poorly recorded and rushed.  No mike Anthony makes  a huge difference, because what separated VH from all the other bands was their great background harmonies. The  magic of Ted Templeman and Don Landee is missing, Ted was perhaps more responsible for the structure of their music  than any body else in the band, he is truly missed here.

B0064MT1NU|1.0|The recent Lions Gate release is terrible. Bare bones, muddy transfer, and missing subtitles that were present on the original Artisan DVD - subtitles which are essential to the story, I might add. I was appalled. I'm sending it back this week. I cannot wait for Criterion to give us a proper release of this classic film. I would encourage all fans of the film to stay away from this Lions Gate release.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|I saw this movie in the theater and enjoyed it just as much at home. I enjoyed the nods to growing up in the late 70's and the various kitsch references in music, vocab, etc. It's the 70's \\"Stand by Me\\", meets \\"ET\\".<br /><br />In typical Spielberg fashion, what you don't know (or fully see) is scary and tense, but becomes acceptable by the time the film is wrapped up. Good message. I enjoyed the casting and special effects. Will it change the world, no, but it's a fun ride. Good job, JJ!

B004LWZW4W|5.0|We missed this movie in the theater, but since we've got the Blu Ray at home and a HDTV, we didn't feel like we lost anything cinematically after viewing this Blue Ray at home. Amazon was price matching another national chain's roll out promo, so we got a great deal.<br /><br />The movie focuses on the back story of how the apes came to have human traits. We thought the premises was great, Alzheimer's tie in was believable, special effects and CGI elements were amazing and our house was truly feeling for Ceasar by the time the movie ended. We liked the original PoTA tie ins and hope they do another movie to bridge the gap.<br /><br />We really enjoyed the Blue Ray extra's and hats off for tying in some educational elements and conservation awareness.<br /><br />Purchased one for us and one as a gift.

B005PR2FD8|4.0|I'm not at all familiar with the Tekkenverse, and I'm only going on my friend's assurance that this film doesn't too much mangle the internal continuity of Namco Bandai Games video games. I'm recommending TEKKEN: BLOOD VENGEANCE, mostly for its dazzling CG animation. The story itself gets more muddled as it progresses, although, thankfully, enough coherence is retained. I was able to follow the plot, even though, at times, I did scramble to keep straight just who is who and which their respective allegiances. At its core, the narrative is constructed around a seriously messed-up family feud. The supernatural Mishima bloodline had always been prone to homicidal urges and wanton destruction. But those new to this universe may require a scorecard.<br /><br />Powerful rival corporations use, respectively, a high school girl and a robot posing as a high school girl to infiltrate Kyoto's prestigious Kyogoku Academy to spy on a student rumored to hold the key to the M stem cell, the so-called Devil gene which unlocks paranormal talents and confers immortality. Teenager Ling Xiaoyu, an expert martial artist who rides a panda and looks cute in her standard schoolgirl outfit, is expelled from Mishima Polytechnic High School which then paves the way for the Mishima Zaibatsu company's brand of arm twisting. This leaves Ling's loyalties veering somewhere on the shaky side. It's even suggested that she goes along with the espionage ops only because the target, Shin Kamiya, is a good-looking hunk.<br /><br />You have to credit the script writer(s) for dispensing with the fight tournament format, as that plot device is pretty played out when it comes to adapting video games to cinema. Instead, there is a \\"story\\" which does frame the fighty fights. The film's first half-hour dedicates itself to fun high school hijinks, with Ling Xiaoyu's snooping around qualifying as lighthearted caper. She befriends another girl, the naive Alisa Bosconovitch, who dresses like - to borrow one reviewer's neat description - a \\"cosplay courtesan.\\" Alisa and Ling are soon vying for Shin's affections, although Ling's crush seems more half-hearted.<br /><br />The story drops the high school shenanigans once Shin Kamiya is abducted during a school festival competition. It adopts a more somber tone. The two warring corporations - the Mishima Zaibatsu and the G Corporation - show their hand and deploy their forces. This leaves the outgunned Ling Xiaoyu caught in the crosshairs from all directions.<br /><br />Again, TEKKEN: BLOOD VENGEANCE may be a bit daunting for those just entering the Tekkenverse. There's a lot of things thrown your way. In a good move, the writers opted to focus on only two protagonists (three, if you count Jin), even though plenty of Tekken characters pop up seemingly for the sake of a gratuitous cameo. Shin Kamiya, for one, feels like a gimmick, there only to advance the story and then disposed of. But Ling and Alisa are appealing protagonists and their friendship is really nicely fleshed out. What happens to one of them in the hell's broken loose third act makes for a surprisingly emotional moment. On the other hand, it's disappointing that Ling, in that same third act, is relegated to the sidelines, although, yes, logically, her skills set renders her pretty helpless in the face of the apocalyptic brawl. Yes, the film culminates in an epic three-way battle royale among the Mishima clan, all three of whom exhibit destructive supernatural aptitude. I'll say that this is possibly the best extended animated fight I've ever seen. Three generations of the Mishima bloodline just tore each other up! And just when I thought they couldn't top it, the Mokujin spirits of the Kyoto Castle are invoked and the stakes escalate that much more.<br /><br />This film gratifies several fetishes of them anime geeks. Cute martial artist in schoolgirl outfit - check. Hot robot girl with transformable body parts (and a nifty jet pack) - ditto. Another hottie in tight black leathers springing into action - you betcha! Frequent salacious upskirt shots - yes! Oh, and let's not forget the refrigerator scene which has a toweled-only Ling cuddling with Alisa.<br /><br />The story occasionally drags and baffles, but it's worth sticking around for the CG work and the remarkably rendered action sequences. I really couldn't care less about Ling's search for the kidnapped student and the resulting poking into the M cell conspiracy, but I did like the human touches, the interactions between our two heroines, and even the clich&eacute;d plot device of the robot's developing a sense of humanity. And how can you not get hyped when the fate of the world ultimately rests on a wrecked robot's Skyrocket Super Punch?<br /><br />And a final thing. May I suggest that you watch this with the Japanese soundtrack? The English dub lacks a little something.lack leathers springing into action - you betcha! Frequent salacious upskirt shots - yes!

B006OAB3ME|4.0|Here's the thing we can all agree upon including Sir Paul. He should have done this long ago when his voice was at its best, not wait until he is the ripe old age of 69. But we don't have THAT album to review. We have this one, Kisses on the Bottom.  So what exactly do we have? Well first off, we have a great collection of songs that have become pop standards much like the Beatles' music has become part of the soundtrack to billions of people's lives since the 1960s. Instrumentally, this album is solid through and through. This band easily could have played behind Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., Perry Como, etc. The whole bunch of them would have sounded great against this backdrop of musical arrangements.  Then we have McCartney crooning (most likely to his new wife) with feeling and grace. Could his voice be stronger? Perhaps at times, but mostly he picked a great set of songs in which to sing in this style where you really have to be able to sing. You can't hide behind tape loops and automatic double-tracking like in 1966. So without going back 20, 30, 40 years, we get a well-seasoned singer who knows how to emote with his voice with the best of them, singing songs that meant something to him in his youth.  The big question as a buyer/listener should be, does this album work as something to listen to over and over? I believe it does. He will never be Frank Sinatra, John Gary, Nat King Cole, Jerry Vale, Bing Crosby or a host of other singers who sang when you needed to have a strong voice in order for the microphone to get a good signal strength to make a recording. But They were never Paul McCartney. He wrote song standards! He knows how to sing them too. He even wrote two for this album and the Deluxe Version includes another original he wrote back during his days with Wings, (Baby's Request). All three songs fit nicely without sticking out into this collection. They feel as if they were written at the same time as the others which all span a couple decades from during prohibition to WWII.  This album is not a \\"statement album\\" or the next \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" even though the brainchild of some of the best pop/rock ever was created by the artist. So you can't judge it with that filter on. Just like we don't judge Sinatra's legacy by the Duets album or by his Christmas music. I don't think this will win over new fans, but it won't disappoint McCartney fans who always enjoyed his tin pan alley tracks like, Honey Pie, You Gave Me The Answer, Warm and Beautiful, When I'm 64, and who sang Till There Was You back during the Cavern Days. So judging it for what it is and not what it isn't I'd say it's an enjoyable listen through and through which is easy to listen to and unwind. For fun, mix these songs with some of Paul's best ballads and it will make for an interesting listen.  All the best!
0061730327|5.0|What a great story. It was a little bit tough to get into, but once you met all the characters it was a wonderful story. Not without heartache, the story told of Williams's family's struggle with hunger, a common problem in Africa.

B006UG90RM|5.0|It is great to hear Van Halen.  This is Van Halen, whether Michael Anthony is here or not.  He chose to leave Van Halen and form a band with Sammy Hagar, Chickenfoot (seriously). It sounds like the name of a band starting out and trying to get discovered. I listened to the new Van Halen and listened to snippets of the new Chickenfoot.  There is no comparison between the two; Chickenfoot sounds dated and bad. People said Sammy knocked the way David Lee Roth sings, really and you sound good on Chicken Butt cd's, no you don't.  To squash all of the people talking about David Lee Roth and his singing;  people who can sing Celine Dion, Michael Buble, Donny Hathaway, etc. see where I'm going.  Rock n Roll is not just about singing quality, it's about attitude, personality, etc.  Quit taking the American Idol pills everybody!  Let's get back to music as a whole. I think this is a great album!  The downfall of creating great albums in the music industry is spending the rest of your life having the public compare everything you do to those albums.  Most of the time those critics are trying to feel a void they have in their life now and live in THEIR past.  Van Halen is what they are now, just like we are all what we are now.  Nothing stays constant in life.  Just play this album and enjoy Van Halen, period.
B0060YIBLK|1.0|This is one of the the worst books I have read on communication skills. I only bought this cause of the supposedly great reviews on here.  It was just some story of a man talking about his life and how he realised that manners are the key to success. This book was a waste of money, he kept telling the same few stories over and over again...how he apologied by tilting his head down during a road rage incidient. Yes OK we get it. You figured something out. How about telling us the science behind it if your such an \\"expert\\" ?.  The guy even goes on about he stalked a girl on a plane for an hour waiting for the \\"perfect time to talk\\" . He kept saying \\"I was a FBI agent\\"..so many times in the book I got sick of it . As if that wasn't enough this guy goes on and on and on about how he chatted to this woman, and that woman and this attractive woman. Why mention they are women if you didn't even get any action ? why tell us ? why ?  Save your money and don't buy this book. You can get all the principles from this book in one chapter from Steven Covery's 7 Habbits of Highly Effective People and videos from Youtube.

I don't even like carrot cake, but when I tried one of the carrot cake cupcakes I made for my boyfriend I was blown away with how good they were! You will not be dissapointed with this book, plus the humor of the two authors puts a smile on yuor face. Very funny and down to earth!
B006FE83U4|5.0|Wow! Cannot get over how great this picture looks for being from 1962! Universal did an amazing job on this restoration for blu ray. No matter what other people say on here, there is vertually no DNR used. Grain is intact (which might bother some people) and the detail is excellent! Cannot get over how clear this print looks. Cannot wait to see Universal's blu ray of All Quiet on the Western Front. The documentary on their restoration process is awesome! Just wished it was more detailed, but they get their message across. There are tons of extras to enjoy on this blu ray. I still yet have not watched the DVD from this set, because once you go blu ray...why go backwards in formats?<br />Universal did an outstanding job on this particular release and I cannot recommend this blu ray enough.<br />Please Universal, treat more of your classics with this much respect. We movie lovers love these awesome restorations the studios are doing instead of using old prints.<br />What a way to start Universal's 100th Anniversary with a great transfer like To Kill a Mockingbird in HD.
0307592731|5.0|Such a good story.<br /><br />The author's story is about more than just her journey on the Pacific Crest Trail. It's also about the turn of events that led her there and how she sorted out her troubled mind while facing the day to day challenges of hiking for such a long period of time.  What impressed me even more is that she did it alone.  Cheryl is an amazing person in so many ways.  I would thank her for sharing the good and bad about her life.<br /><br />I live near the PCT and close to the post office where the hikers come for their boxes.  I was once a l trail Angel for a lone woman hiker much like the author.  I asked her tons of questions, curious about how and why a woman alone would undertake such a journey.<br />The trail and the people that hike it for months has fascinated me, so this book was an absolute page turner.<br /><br /> I am inspired and impressed by \\"Wild\\".
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a great game I don't get why everyone says that this game is boring and stupid because they only give you 10 games it says right in the discrption you only get ten and work for the others also the thing that's cool is that you can work for your games and save up I have only had this for 30 minutes but personally this is a very addicting game

0596004966|4.0|First of all, I've come to the realization that the way I learn is through short books and then coding myself. A big book just doesn't do it for me, I get buried in the details and forget most of what I've read. I'm new to C++ and have read through most of Accelerated C++, which is a good book. But it wasn't until I took this pocket reference on a plane trip and read it that everything started coming together. I don't know how they do it but they manage to put examples in there as well, so it was very useful for me. I saw ALL the basics of the language right beside each other and understood better how they inter-relate.<br /><br />I will say this better not be your first C++ reference. The order in which topics are treated is somewhat asynchronous. Properties are referenced in the beginning of the book that aren't explained for 50 pages down the road. But if you're already at least familiar with most topics it works out fine.
B006T5FDLG|5.0|As many of you know the travesty that was Lulu, the experimental album with Lou Reed, was released and received with mostly harsh and critical reviews. The idea was good, but some things are best kept as that, an idea. But we'll get back to that a little later.<br /><br />After a mini tour in support of Lulu, Metallica quickly split off and began their awesome 30 anniversary shows, which saw the return of Dave Mustaine, something the old-guard Metallica fans thought they'd never see. Also during these shows, the guys played 4 'new' songs. The songs were not new, only dug up from the Death Magnetic sessions and played for the first time live. That is what you get here in this, the Beyond Magnetic EP. All are rough demos of songs/jams that didn't make it to DM. And each one of them is excellent, just as good or better as the songs on DM. But, why now? Why release unfinished demos from a last album? Timing.<br /><br />Metallica, I think, knew from the get-go, that the majority of fans wouldn't like or get Lulu. Just look at how fast everyone's forgotten about it. By releasing this and it sounding like their old selves, and anything compared to Lulu, they knew the fans would eat it up. And for the most part they did and are. So the machine keeps rolling, and hopefully learning, at the same time making some great metal in these trying times. If you're a Metallica fan, you'll enjoy this. Hopefully the guys' 'experimental' urge was all let out on Lulu and more productive, dare I say, more back-to-roots Metallica can emerge in the future.

0525478817|5.0|Yesterday, my mother arrived home with news that she had found a package waiting for me on the doorstep. I knew immediately that it was my copy of TFIOS, as I had been eagerly awaiting its arrival since I had pre-ordered it a year ago. As I began reading it that night, I became so engrossed in the story that I almost had to hurl the book across the room in order to part from it and settle down for a good night's sleep.  This afternoon, accompanied by a box of tissues, I finished what I can only describe as the least patronising Young Adult novel I think I've ever encountered. I have been an avid reader since before I started school, and now at the age of nineteen, had long ago moved into adult and classic literature due to the seemingly common belief amongst authors of YA fiction that teenagers are not capable of tackling real issues and 'big' words. Green's writing ( I have also read Paper Towns and An Abundance of Katherines, saving LFA till last) has the same effect on me as the 'modern classics'- it makes me marvel at the power of words, and the ability that some posess to make us think about more than the mundane, every-day workings of our own lives.  I promised no spoliers at all, and so I shan't even mention the names of the characters (I'm sure you know them already anyway), but I will say, if you're a teenager who likes it when adults give us the benefit of the doubt, read this novel. If you're an adult- read this novel.  I think the best way to finish this review is to point you towards the quote that features on its front cover as the most accurate summation of the 'emotional rollercoaster' (to both use a cliche and throw in a sneeky reference to the novel) that this book will take you on. Or I could simply say, reading this book was a few hours very well spent.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of games, but it is somewhat difficult to get enough points to buy the other games ago . it is worth getting.
B00061RZBA|1.0|I purchased this DVD as a stocking stuffer for my Fiance.  It would of been nice to know that the language code for the Dvd would not be recognized by all types of Dvd players.  I have tried it in 3 seperate dvd players and the same thing happens.  Unable to read disc language code.  Sad to say that this has been a waste of money.
B006362ZR6|4.0|The Fray are true to their therapeutic reputation on \\"Scars and Stories.\\" These are melodic, soothing, emotional forays, often downbeat in mood, crafted with the intent to apply balm to listeners' wounds.<br /><br />Despite the more or less straightforward fashion in which The Fray write and record their songs, there are certainly songs that stand out from the warm pool of melancholy. \\"Munich\\" is intelligently arranged with downright beautiful harmonizing and vocal blends, while \\"Turn Me On\\" takes a short-lived detour from the despairing vibe with its jangly, radio-ready melody and arrangement.<br /><br />\\"I Can Barely Say\\" is absolutely aching in its lyrical precision and deep-set, crackling melody. Isaac Slade's vocals are as piercing and emotional as ever. Lead single \\"Heartbeat\\" is pristine, managing to be both muscular in its arrangement and presentation while still retaining a stark, vulnerable quality rife with emotional resonance. It is a multifaceted track that deserves to bring The Fray their first Top 10 pop hit since 2008's impressive, though overplayed, \\"You Found Me.\\"<br /><br />\\"Scars and Stories\\" may be business as usual for the band, but it also benefits from verve, grit and artistic integrity. This is certainly a set of true, sincere, well-crafted music and is precisely what The Fray's fan base is looking for.
B006UG909U|5.0|This is the album Van Halen has wanted to make for over 10 years, even after all the infighting, the firings, the lead singer switches, David Lee Roth \\"re-joining\\" the band for a moment in 2000, and then again for a year or two in 2006, bassist Michael Anthony vanishing from view and replaced by Eddie's son Wolfgang, and meanwhile brother Alex Van Halen just keeps beating away on the drums... you know, it's only So Cal rock and roll, but they like it. And it's a formula that worked for all those years, so why not try it one more time? This is the result.<br /><br />This is a short (and priced to move) album of \\"new\\" songs, so in that spirit I'm going to review this quickly, but if you know me, it never works out that way. Enjoy...<br /><br />13 songs at just over 50 minutes:<br /><br />1. Tattoo - from right off the jump, the sonic jet crashes into your ears. The Van Halen of old has landed, and David's somewhat older voice still soars over the destruction of guitars, drums and synths. This song reaches into my heart and grabs it, as it's friggin' Van Halen, man! This rocked so hard, and the ending just quietly silenced itself. Great song either way. It was number one the second it was released, and to be sure it's just a prelude of things to come on the rest of this album.<br /><br />2. She's The Woman - according to an article by Rolling Stone magazine, this song sounds like an old unreleased song of theirs called \\"Down In Flames\\" from 1977. Sure it does, but who cares? It sounds fresh and loud and once again, it rocks! It's like 1983 all over again, and I can see 10,000 Camaros blaring this album - and this short song - out all over America this summer. This is a great rocker for sure!<br /><br />3. You and Your Blues - the guitar riff is familiar, the voice is haunting and young, the drums come up and the vocal harmonies appear, and there it is, andother perfect Van Halen song. Did these guys jump into a time machine and set it for the 80's, because I'm all for it! This is the song of the album so far, it's rich and lush and the solos are perfect, and the rock is finally back!<br /><br />4. China Town - look out, keep your heads down, and jump right in, this is THE speed rock song of the album - everything is double-time except for David's laid-back vocals, but it's the formula<br />that made them famous through over a dozen albums and compilations, greatest hits albums and live cuts, too. The guitar solo here is vintage Eddie, and is so freaking dizzying your head will spin, and then it stops for that one second and then the song jumps back in full blast! Look out, you're gonna get blown away by this one.<br /><br />5. Blood and Fire - are the boys singing the history of their lives or of the band's, or of both? \\"Told ya I was coming back...\\" Dave moans over the smashing guitar work of Eddie, brother Alex keeping fantastic time, and young son Wolfgang just banging away on the bass. they've been through punch-ups, break-ups, silent glances and some of the best rock ever put on vinyl. Here they are in their fortieth year (!) of working this craziness out together, and I'll be honest, they've never sounded better, fresher and younger! Bravo!<br /><br />6. Bullethead - this song is pure nostalgia, and it takes me to a lost track from \\"Women and Children First.\\" Great stuff, a quick song, and insane lyrics from the boys who invented power-drill rock and roll.<br /><br />7. As Is - As this song is, the drums tell you a monster track is coming. And it sure is, a behemoth of sound, quickly building up to David Lee roth once again keeping up in his own way against the all-out assault of the Van Halens. Who wins this fight on this song this time. I'll tell you - we do, and what a solo in the middle. Once again, classic Eddie at work and it is only getting better. As David half-whispers, \\"Never spoiled by progress...\\" Another winner!<br /><br />8. Honeybabysweetiedoll - One of the odder tracks on the album, something like finding aforeign broadcast of Martian rock on the radio by way of Southern California, but it goes right into 1984 again, as if the boys had never stopped jamming together for all those years. It's sexy, and fast, and it's like a moonlight ride with your lover with the lights off doing 125 on the highway as you get closer to... oh, you know what! Another growling mastertake. The song ends quickly with a quick feedback right into<br /><br />9. The Trouble with Never - what happens when your lover suddenly says no after so much yes? This song once again takes me back to the past glories of the band, but it's a great place to be,<br />and David's voice has never sounded more syrupy and with that sexy quiet growl he is famous for. Another classic.<br /><br />10. Outta Space - What if Ted Nugent decided to play with Van Halen? This is the closest you'll ever get to hearing that, as the song's subject takes us to the stratosphere. Another screamer from David, and another wonderful solo from the master, and he's getting better with every song, and on this song you can feel every fret and string being tortured under his capable hands!<br /><br />11. Stay Frosty - a bit of silly old timey blues, which makes me think this is a sequel of sorts to \\"Ice Cream Man,\\" as the boys have always loved it, but of course jump right into a quick-time version of the song, and they're letting us know that it's good to have fun, but of course keep your karma careful, and who should know about the ultimate ups and downs but these guys? A great bit of solo Eddie work once again in between as well, and of course what Van Halen album would be complete without the big classic song ending?<br /><br />12. Big River - now it's time for a bit of seriousness - not! They run right into this song as they have throughout, with abandon and the type of rock and roll that needs to be remembered, 100 percent! This is a great song and one of my picks for another hit, if they let it happen! The guitar work is solid and the solo here is unmatched and timeless, and even though you may have heard similar versions of it, this is Eddie Van Halen, one of the inventors of the speed solo, and here he is untouched. Serious masterwork.<br /><br />13. Beats Workin' - for these guys, the final song on the album is a love letter to everyone who has ever wanted to start a rock band, to everyone who has failed, and to those who succeeded<br />only to let it slip out of their hands. The power of rock is here in all it's glory, and it's timeless, and it has kept them playing for four decades - young bassist Wolfgang wasn't even born when they started! A great way to close out the album, with a suggestion from the band itself: it beats working, all of it. It's rock and roll.<br /><br />So, I had apprehensions, maybe it's because I'm almost 50 now and my rock and roll idols are dead or have gone soft and gone on reality shows to keep their names alive, or worse, gone off to cover Broadway show tunes. So here it is, supposedly the end of the world, and these guys have the audacity to put out an album of straight-forward good old fashioned rock and roll? Just a guitar, a bass player, a singer and a drummer? Well... yes!<br /><br />I listened, I reviewed, and I loved every second of it. You young kids can call it dinosaur rock, but I dare any of you to tell these guys that. They are rocking their butts off, and it works for me!<br /><br />In the end, I'm giving the album 5 glorious stars - they deserve it, they've restored my faith in true rock and roll, and the fun spirit four guys can have by just sitting down and playing what they've been doing since many of us were young, at least me.<br /><br />Go now, buy the album, and as us old people say, crank it up to eleven! You'll be glad you did!<br /><br />(thanks for reading, and please leave some feedback (or a vote) if you liked it or not, and also check out my other reviews here on Amazon!)4 again, as if the boys had never stopped jamming together for all those years.

B006OAB3ME|4.0|Let's face it - these cover albums from veteran, heavily-moneyed legends of rock and pop are often pretty mundane, or at the very least inconsequential. In spite of this, Paul McCartney delivers quite well on \\"Kisses on the Bottom,\\" with his iconic, velvety voice singing an eclectic, elaborate array of some of the best tunes ever written - as well as two extremely impressive new ones.<br /><br />The gorgeous, lilting \\"My Valentine\\" recalls a fond romantic memory without a trace of sap or sickly-sweetness. It is a damn solid McCartney original that, save for his now-huskier vocal range, would fit in well on one of the classic Beatles albums. \\"Only Our Hearts\\" is similar in its theme and melancholic edge, but better showcases McCartney's expressive, stirring lower register. Eric Clapton plays guitar on the latter while Stevie Wonder contributes harmonica on the former. It helps to have friends.<br /><br />This is not a Valentine's Day album, but it is very fortunately released in the days leading up to the holiday, for its ambiance is certainly warm, balmy and lush - that is to say, romantic. Whether he's singing the nuances of the evocative \\"Bye Bye Blackbird\\" or the timeless, drippy \\"Always,\\" McCartney's delivery is consistently restrained, contemplative and sentimental, yet, importantly, he never sounds insincere or premeditated. Each selection is well-rendered and straightforward.<br /><br />Much of the reason for this cohesion is owed to Diana Krall's backing band, hired specifically for this project. Backing McCartney with a fervent glow on the likes of the brilliant \\"The Glory of Love\\" and the relatively funky \\"Ac-Cent-Tchu-Ate the Positive,\\" they earn their keep here.<br /><br />McCartney has set many records in his long and varied career, and \\"Kisses on the Bottom\\" won't break any of them, yet it is also a highly listenable set of mellow, lovely tunes that goes perfect with a bottle of wine, whether or not the evening skews romantic.<br /><br />(Certain retailers carry different editions, some featuring bonus tracks, so do your homework.)s tracks, so do your homework.)
1440503257|5.0|I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THIS BOOK AND PORED OVER IT AS SOON AS I RECEIVED IT.  SOME OF THE REFERENCES BACK TO THE HARRY POTTER BOOKS ARE IN ERROR, BUT THAT DOES NOT MAKE THE BOOK ANY THE LESS DELIGHTFUL AS FAR AS THE RECIPES GO.  THE CAULDRON CAKES SHOULD HAVE BEEN LISTED AS SUCH RATHER THAN FLUFFY PANCAKES WITH A REFERENCE ELSEWHERE AS TO WHAT PAGE CAULDRON CAKES MAY BE FOUND, WHICH IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT SHE MEANS.  I ALSO THINK THAT A SMALLER MORE COMPACT PANCAKE WOULD BE MORE PLAUSIBLE AS TO WHAT MIGHT BE PACKAGED AND SOLD ON A TRAIN, OR EVEN A LARGE CAKEY COOKIE, WHICH IS EASY TO PREPARE AND COULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED, WHICH IS WHAT I THINK OF WHEN I ENVISION A CAULDRON CAKE (CHOCOLATE, VANILLA, PUMKIN, OR BANANA.)  ONLY J.K. ROWLING KNOWS FOR SURE, AND SHE HASN'T WRITTEN A COOKBOOK COMPANION TO THE SERIES AS FAR AS I KNOW, SO IF THE RECIPES ARE A BIT DIFFERENT THAN YOUR IMAGINATIONS LED YOU TO BELIEVE, IMPROVISE AS YOU WOULD WITH ANY COOKBOOK AND ENJOY THE FUN.  I READ SOME REVIEWS WHICH STATED THAT THE RECIPES WERE COMPLICATED, AND TRULY DISAGREE.  IF YOU ARE ANY KIND OF A COOK, THESE RECIPES ARE EASILY COMPREHENSIBLE WITH READILY FOUND INGREDIENTS IN NEARLY EVERY HOUSEHOLD, OR CORNER SUPERMARKET; AND I COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR KEEPING AN EYE TO THAT ASPECT OF THE INGREDIENTS USED IN THE RECIPES.  THERE ISN'T ANYTHING TERRIBLY EXOTIC ABOUT THE RECIPES, WHICH MAKES THEM USABLE ON A DAY-TO-DAY BASIS.  THAT ALONE MAKES THE BOOK WELL WORTH THE MONEY.  MY NEICES CANNOT WAIT FOR ME TO PREPARE SOME OF THE DELIGHTS THAT HARRY AND HIS FRIENDS ENJOYED AT HOGWARTS, AND WITH SOME HOGWARTS STYLE DECORATIONS, I THINK THEY WILL BE WELL PLEASED.  IF YOU LIKE TO COOK, OR EAT, AND ARE A HARRY POTTER FAN, I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK FOR YOUR COLLECTION OF ALL THINGS HARRY POTTER.  IT IS FUN JUST TO BROWSE THROUGH THE BOOK, AT LEAST FOR ME, AND I AM AN ACCOMPLISHED COOK.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I have seen Phantom in NYC twice and I was really disappoited.  This filmed performance is just fantastic!  I think they were much better than the movie.  I think and hope we will be seeing more live productions filmed this way.I know this was a special production, but I think if I had seen a film from a live NYC - Broadway show, I would have loved it from the begining.  I just finished watching this bluray and wanted to add my 5 stars.  I know I'll watch it many more.  Now, I think they should do Les Mes.  That would hevenly.
B004G25V9S|3.0|The best review I've read for this album simply stated, \\"This album is a first for Opeth, as it is their first album that is simply 'good' instead of 'absolutely perfect'.\\" Sadly, I couldn't agree with this more.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game and my 6 year old loves playing it to. there are so many different types of games tor everyone to play
B0073LWEXK|5.0|So far, this is the best adventure game for Android I've played. Grisly Manor and Special Enquiry Detail by G5 Games, which were the more ok ones I had played until now, don't even come close! I saw other reviews saying it doesn't have clues, but there is a walkthrough right there, in the diary, which is always available on the screen. If you like adventure games like the last 2 Zork games and Mist, this is the closest to that type of game available at this point. Keep it coming, Fire Maple. Kudos to you!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Honestly, there is probably nothing I can write that hasn't already been written. I absolutely loved this entire series, but this first book will always be my favorite of the three. Can't wait to see how they did the movie!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Without question this is the best Weather App on Amazon and for a lot of reasons, first because its the most complete. Its also simple, informative, and the layout makes sense. It doesn't just tell you all the info about the weather in your area or anywhere else you wanna know and all the little statistics, but also will for the next day, 36hrs, 10 days and month with accuracy. there are also videos you can watch, you can see what people in your area are saying about the weather on Facebook and Twitter all at the press of a button... BUT most importantly to me and mangy others there is VERY accurate radar and maps you can use from this app. Trust me they are accurate down to the mile(I live in sw Iowa and tested it a few nights ago during a snowstorm) the radar is the most comprehensive radar I have yet found. anywhere. So that in and of itself makes this app worth it. its free. I mean come one people, you cant possible ask for more. REAL TALK.
0525478817|5.0|There are a lot of books out there that make you laugh till you can hardly sit upright, and a lot that drive you to tears. There are far fewer that can do both at the same time. \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" is just one such book. John Green has managed to create balance where it is sorely needed, walking his characters along the precipice between life and death. This book examines how we live, how we love, and how we die with a strength and grace that is hard to find in this generation of instantly-updated statuses and say-before-you-think approaches to conversation and relationships. This book does not take the careful approach to the subject of death; it takes death in hand, examines it, prods at it, and then crushes it and from the pieces makes something beautiful.  Hazel and Augustus are not perfect and each has their flaws; Hazel sometimes becomes a bit of a test for everyone's patience, and Augustus is too overconfident. In the end, though, it is impossible not to fall in love with them. Their joys become your joys, their sorrows your sorrows. You can feel their grief. They are never just their illness, but instantly become people in the minds of the reader.  Yes, this is a book about cancer. Yes, this is a book about death, but it is so much more than that. \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" is a book about living, about finding purpose when purpose seems so futile, when death is inevitable and rushing up at you and grasping at your throat and still being able to look around and say, \\"I want more out of this time I have left.\\" There is a part in this book, about each person having their own infinity of time left to live. I think Hazel and Augustus spent their infinities the best way they could, by loving each other.  John Green, I thank you from the bottom of my heart for writing such a beautiful novel.  And as always, DFTBA.
B005HSL626|5.0|Fruit Ninja has a lot of really good things you look for in a game( yes, even the free version) great graphics. addicting gameplay, cool unlockable stuff, not just multiple games modes but FUN game modes, great sensitivity when you run you finger across the screen and nice sound effects. I mean really, this game is free, so of you don't think that's enough to get it you prolly don't even like games lol. REAL TALK
B006UG90RM|3.0|Van Halen reminds me of a guy who hit his peak in high school: If you get back together for drinks, old stories, & a pick-up game of football, he's still the man, but then he goes back to work at McDonald's. VH was state-of-the-art guitar-rock in 1978, & all credit to them for begin able to recreate that sound now, but Eddie's 57 years old, Dave's 56.

B004529NKC|4.0|I didn't like Step up 1 that much but I incredibly enjoyed watching Step Up 2, so that's why I had to see Step Up 3.  Yes, Step Up 3 is not for everyone, because it only caters to dance enthusiasts, like myself. It really doesn't bother me if the story is inadequate or the actors were lame, as long as the dance moves are off the hook!  Sharni Vinson is definitely a great choice for this movie, what an incredible dancer. I expected more from Alyson Stoner, though.
B0071MQ37E|4.0|Some of the changes were good to the show, but overall I still think that Broadway is by far the best way to watch this show.  This cast was good, however Hugh Panaro is by far the best Phantom ever.  This production was still good though.
B005SH5K7I|4.0|Zookeeper falls in love with Kate instead. Catches up with her with the help of Bernie the Gorilla by piggy-backing him while he scales the Zakim bridge. Oh, and a Gorilla kicking it in a TGI Friday's is awesome!  Also: Rosario Dawson needs to be on every film ever made.
B0073LJ61S|5.0|I was very skeptical about this new effort after Tattoo was released and had very low expectations.  I couldn't have been more wrong and was really pleased with how good this is.  It flat out rocks!  Blood And Fire might be as good a song as they have ever done.  I can't wait to see them play in support of this.  It's worth downloading the entire album.
0553381695|4.0|Oh Holy Cow! I am soooo in love with this series!! George R.R. Martin has such a knack of keeping me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />At the start of A Clash of Kings there are multiple kings in the realm, vying for the right to Iron Throne. The Stark children are spread out over the land all dealing with their own problems. Jon is searching for the enemy Mance Raider north of the wall. Arya is struggling to maker her way home without Queen Regent Cersei's men finding her. Bran must lord over Winterfell while King Robb marches against the Lannisters. Poor Sansa is still within King Joffrey's clutches.<br /><br />All the while the remaining Baratheon brothers both lay claim to the throne. The Dragon Queen searches for a new army. Tyrion plots against them all in the name of his family. Not to mention the new characters and threats that are introduced in the second installment of A Song of Ice and Fire.<br /><br />Treachery, treachery and more treachery. This is one dark and dreary book that will keep you guessing.
0618918248|5.0|In this book, Dawkins gives a general description of evolution to help his readers understand the concept. He also takes a bit of time to list his qualms with modern religion. Finally, Dawkins argues against the main theological arguments and submits his own counterattacks.  An excellent book by an excellent author.
B000SJJCX4|5.0|I have been refusing to buy a foot pedal tuner for a long time due to the cost alone. I just dont see a pedal that tunes costing $100 plus in most cases. I purchased 2 of these, one for myself (acoustic guitar) and my wife (electric Bass). THey work wonderfully and seem like they will last for a \\"very\\" long time. I'm not sure why you would spend $70 more so that you can stomp, slam, or throw your musical gear around. Foolish! Wonderful product for the money. Highly recommended.
1400052181|5.0|I am not a big non-fiction reader.  Unless it really is intriguing and grabs you, let's face it:  non-fiction can be a drag!  This was an amazing story, from the historical to the scientific to the socialogical, and finally the humanistic perspective.  Henrietta Lacks was an amazing person whose story needed to be told.  But, just as importantly, the story of her descendants and their evolution from an impoverished, uneducated,and unworldly existence to one of assertiveness and justice about what the right thing to do was about Henrietta's story is in and of itself amazing. And that doesn't even address the fascinating scientific story that is enfolded within this book.  Frankly, I cannot imagine a more important book to read!  Crissey

B0015HOFZI|4.0|I didn't read all the reviews again after purchasing this turntable so please forgive me if this issue has already been addressed. As soon as I started hooking up this turntable I was immediately surprised to find there was no ground wire. It's been decades since I dealt with a turntable but what I do recall is ALL the ones I had once owned (Garrad, Dual, Realistic and even my old Sony turntable from the eighties) all had ground wires to eliminate any low rumble noise. Though I was happy with the fidelity, I noticed I had to turn the bass way down on my subwoofers. By reducing the bass, the LP I was playing had an overall brightness with a definite lack of richness in the low end of the sound spectrum.  The fix was easy. I simply ran a wire from a screw on the back of my receiver to the turntable to ground it. At first I thought I'd have a problem because the turntable chassis is practically all plastic. However I found I could attach the wire to one of the screws that fastened the turntable's rubber feet to the body. Just to insure the connection, I placed a small metal washer between the screw and it's contact to the rubber foot, placing the wire in between the screw and the washer.  Voila! I placed the needle on an LP that contained some heavy bass response and the rumble was greatly reduced. In fact I was able to keep the subwoofer's dial at the same setting I normally have it set to when listening to CD's.  For me there was a marked difference and it took less than five minutes to accomplish.
B005K2XUPK|5.0|I love the Timbuk2 products and was glad to see that they had a case for the Kindle Fire. The case looks good and feels great in the hand. The case is a tight fit for the Kindle Fire, so any other skin or case will not allow the Kindle to fit. There is plenty of padding in the case to absorb light falls/drops. I only wish there was a way to charge the Kindle Fire without taking it out of the case.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|as a music fan and muscian i stick mostly to classic rock and randb oldies as my main music but this album and artist is a rare thing these days, bought this album for my brother and he played it all the time and got me into Adele.she is in her early 20's so she will only get better.Adele has a great voice and there are some nice melodies on this album I wish she would try to rock out a bit more but i am a ballad type of guy so i like her songs a lot.best songs Turning Tables nice vocal catchy melodie should be a single best song for me,Rollin In The Deep is the closet to a rock and roll song that Adele gets great backing vocals like church, i heard it when the album came out a few years ago on an alternative radio station.Someone Like You is nice but there are enough ballads on here.if Adele puts some rock songs to go with the ballads she will be even bigger than she is today.I give this album a 4 rating

B0000261RJ|5.0|I'm 39, and the first time I heard Ronnie's voice was on some compilation tape I had bought when I was 14, and heard him sing Heaven And Hell for the first time. I  must have listened to that track until the tape wore out. This was back when there was an invention called tapes.   I went Dio-nuts after that. But it was Sacred Heart that I remember having the kind of feel that was mellow and hard at the same time. It was a magical set of songs for me at the time, and when I listen to it now after Ronnie's gone, it shows how the guy could sing just about anything. Of course, all of his Rainbow and Sabbath work proved this beyond a doubt, but there was something special about Sacred Heart at the time it came out. It's not the crappy album people claim it to be now.   Well, put it on, light some candles for Ronnie, and experience one of the best singers that ever lived.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I didn't really know what to expect with this book... I didn't know much about it other than people I know and some podcasts I've listened to kept recommending it.  I finally received it as a hold request from the library, and it was so worth it. I love this book.  It's not the happiest of stories in one of the saddest times in recent history, but there are glimmers. I love the point of view from which the story is told, and I love the book thief herself.  Max and Rudy will stick with me for a long, long time.  I finished it a week ago, and I'm still thinking about it.  I do not reread books very often, but this is one of the few that I can see myself re-reading. I hope to recommend this to everyone I know who hasn't read it yet. If you haven't, give it a try.

B006UG90RM|5.0|The important question here is this.  Is the rock world better off with or without a new Van Halen?  After thoroughly enjoying a solid, hard-rocking album like A Different Kind of Truth a few times, I say with.  No question about it.<br /><br />The simplest way to put it is that, even though this album can't fully reach the heights of their wild days of the 70's and 80's, it rocks as hard as, and probably harder than, you could reasonably expect it to and provides some welcome surprises.  Most of the album, from what I've read, consists of older, unreleased songs that have been reworked.  While some people have been unhappy that not all the songs are brand new, I think it makes sense.  After listening to some old versions of the songs these are supposed to be based on, it's clear that they've done a considerable amount of work reviving them and shaping them into complete songs.  Also, it gives the band time to work Dave back into the fold instead of tackling all-new material after having not worked together for so long.  Maybe after reliving some tunes from the past, they'll carry that spirit on and write some great new music in the future, but for now, this is not a bad album.  I could tell immediately upon hearing the first single, Tattoo, that it had the flavor of early-to-mid 80's Van Halen, if not quite as edgy.  That is, until I heard China Town.  Wow, seriously?  This song almost qualifies as metal!  Speedy riffing and drumming, and vocals from Dave that sound stronger and more vintage than I honestly thought he'd be capable of.  I mean, I might not be a rabid V.H. fanatic, but what fan of heavy metal or hard rock isn't interested in hearing new material from the (mostly) classic line-up of the band that's produced so many legendary songs, especially if they're going to sound this good?  Songs that smoke like China Town, Bullethead, and Honeybabysweetiedoll (wow, what a heavy groove to the riffs in THAT song!) have way more fire than I expected to hear from these guys.  Eddie surprises me completely on those three tracks and a few others with riffs and solos that really would be labeled heavy metal if they had been released in the early 80's.  It sort of blows my mind to hear him playing that style and Dave singing loudly and aggressively to match it.<br /><br />For the most part, this album sounds a lot like classic Van Halen from their heyday in the 80's.  I think the songs fit into three categories:  speedy, edgy rock like on their first few albums; hard-nosed arena rock like on 1984; and songs that fall somewhere in between.  Wherever they fit in, they're all riff-driven, up-tempo, and energy fueled.  Eddie, on tracks like China Town, Bullethead, Honeybabysweetiedoll, Outta Space, Stay Frosty, and Big River, sounds like the fiery guitarist that always made me like Van Halen more than probably any other staple of classic rock radio, blending loud, cocky blues/rock riffs, technical solos, and familiar melodies that should please all but the most demanding of critics and fans.  These are the older-sounding tracks, where another album standout is Big River.  That one is very catchy, with a great vintage sound.  Also, Stay Frosty, which rocks out after a bluesy acoustic opening, is a nice throwback reminiscent of The Ice Cream Man.  Tattoo, Blood and Fire, and The Trouble With Never are the songs with the most pop/ arena rock flavor, relying more on melody and a laidback vibe.  You and Your Blues, She's the Woman, As Is, and Beats Workin' feature elements of both early and late Roth-era, rounding out a full album that sees Eddie blazing one heavy rock riff after another.<br /><br />As for the vocal department, I've always preferred Dave's voice to Sammy's.  It's not that I consider him a superior singer, it's just that, as a matter of taste, I enjoy Dave's more unrestrained quality compared to Sammy's style.  He's still David Lee Roth, no mistaking that, and even though age has taken away those trademark, high-pitched screams and yells, he hasn't lost the command in his voice.  I was surprised by the power he musters on China Town, Tattoo, She's the Woman, and others.  This album has no ballads, and the singles are the only tracks with a little less fire.  But then, if they led off with a heavy song like China Town or Honeybabysweetiedoll as the first single, they might not even get airplay!  Rock radio might think it was too metal.  The really awesome part about this is that I'm not joking!  The songs really do have that heavy of a vibe.  While I can't quite say that this sounds as incredible as the music from their glory years, it's a surprisingly solid hard rock album from a veteran group who have something to be proud of with A Different Kind of Truth, and I believe the music world is better off with it than without it.t the command in his voice.

B000FVNX2Q|5.0|I purchased the 12C for my real estate appraising class. For someone who had never really spent much time using a financial calculator, I thought the learning  curb would be great. It's not. If you are new to using financial calculator, don't fear, jump right in. There are plenty of online resources showing you how to use the 12C and the effort is worth it. Once you learn the basics, you might begin to ask yourself how you ever lived without one for your work. I'm used to using statistics programs, so the 12C does basic statistics as well. After you learn the first steps, it becomes sort of intuitive. As to recommending the 12C to anyone, yes I would. The only issue I have found is that the \\"On\\" button at times requires pressing it twice. This can be very annoying or you can think of it as great safety feature when you place it back in the case and you think it may turn on by accident it you bang into it.
B005N0PJJO|3.0|I had no idea when I purchased the first book of this triology that it was erotica, and I didn't know until I finished this book that it started out as Twilight fanfiction, but I started making the connection quickly.  In this book Ana started getting on my nerves. I got tired of her going on and on about how hot Christian was.  We get it:  He's georgous.  Move on.  It reminded me of Bella in Twilight a little too much.  Christian got on my nerves as well.  I find him controlling and abusive.  I couldn't deal being in a relationship with someone who was like that.  I think the relationship between Christian and Ana is highly disfuncitonal.  I also found myself flipping through all the sex scenes.  All that being said, it was a decent book and I read it in just a few days.  A very easy read, and there are a few sub-plots that I found interesting.  I feel that this whole triology had the potential for greatness, but dropped the ball quite a few times.

No.  If you are dropping Kindle's off buildings, get something else.

B005LAIGOQ|4.0|Forget Harry Potter when you watch The Woman in Black. One thing has nothing to do with the other. Daniel Radcliffe is struggling not to be typecast, to establish himself as an adult actor, not an easy accomplishment for any child star. Radcliffe does a creditable job in this movie. A classic, gothic horror story, it contains scary elements without resorting to the gory, shlocky slasher stuff of recent decades. As Arthur Kipps, the young lawyer devastated by his wife's childbed death, he has little to do other than to act wary and frightened, and appear foolhardy enough to go where no sane person ever would. This film has many strengths, among them the perfect dark, eerie sets, the cinematography that lends a sense of black and white to what is actually a color production, and enough of a mystery to make the viewer wonder what's going on in the forbidding town to which Arthur is sent to work. Along with him, we figure out, step by step, exactly what motivates the black veiled apparition, and along with him, we trust that he'll be able to put her to rest.<br /><br />But there are weaknesses as well. It becomes a bit tiresome to follow Arthur through the dismal corridors of the haunted mansion, armed as he is with only a candle and an axe. Too much reliance is placed upon the sudden shocking revelation, which the audience learns to anticipate. The most effective scene takes place outside the estate, at a family crypt where Arthur encounters the distraught mother of a dead child. Most of the supporting actors have little to do other than to look forbidding and threatening, but Ciaran Hinds and Janet McTeer are superb in there roles as the grieving couple who, alone amongst their neighbors, offer some support to Arthur. The ending is a true shocker.<br /><br />As is typical, the screenplay is substantially different from the novel upon which it is based, so watch the movie as a separate entity. It's worth a look. I needed a drink to settle down afterwards!

B0000252YK|1.0|I agree with all of the other reviewers in this category, The Ultimate Sin sucked!!!  The production, music, lyrics, everything just was way below what Ozzy was capable of.  However, at the time, this was a very popular album.  Also, the tour was huge.  This was Ozzy's glam moment.  Gotta remember that this is the type of music folks wanted to hear at the time, including me (sad, I know).  Unfortunately, with the exception of No More Tears, all of Ozzy's stuff since Bark at the Moon has sucked!!!  Whats up with that?  He is still good live, but the new material really lacks.

B006UG90RM|5.0|I absolutely can't believe it.  I was expecting this album not not be good at all... I probably should have known better.  This is an absolutely amazing album.  It makes you wonder how they do it.  The album is impossibly brilliant.  It makes you feel like you can have fun again with rock and roll.  I feel like I can breathe.  I don't know how to explain it...  Too many albums out right now are so freaking depressing (and in this economy, do we really need more of that?).  This is what you want to listen to when you are having the best day of your life.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Classic Van Halen with a modern twist! Dave's voice is OK, remember he is in his mid 50's, but still sounds fine. There is no denying that Eddie Van Halen wasn't screwing around in the studio! He is INSANE on the guitar! Wolfgang stands his own, he isn't Michael Anthony, but is proving to be a fine musician. And Alex is fantastic as well! He hasn't lost anything, he is still true to his sound!

B005OCFHHK|3.0|I received this set for Christmas, and I am going to sell it and get the ultimate editions that have been released. One, because I love Harry Potter and this set doesn't do justice to it, and second I am a collector, and an avid blu ray/dvd fan so It upsets me to see what is missing from this set. First, the case is fine, it holds the movies nicely and the blu rays look great, but once you get past the fifth disc you realise that you are just getting a poorly compiled set. For one the later movies are the disc ones of two disc sets, they didn't even try to print a new labels for this set, so each time you see this disc you realise you are only getting half of what is out there. There really are no extas with the last movies, because it's all included on the two disc sets. At least with the first five you get pretty decent extras, but there is so much out there that it seems a waste just to include the movie only version of the last movies.  For casual fans I would recommend it, but if you are like me and love the bonus features, there are better versions out there. I purchased the first movie in the ultimate edition form and am very pleased, the packaging/bonuses are great, and you get so many extras you will be overwhelmed (but in a good way) compared to these editions. I don't like this set because it seemed like they threw it together in order to make a few bucks for the end of the year, they didn't even think about the customers with this one. There were no bonus discs as with other box sets, to put all the extras in one place (to make up for the later movies having so little) But as far as the quality of the movie and how it looks/sounds on blu ray i'd give it 5 stars. and the movies themselves are great (as you know already if you are even reading this) However I think this was just a quick cash grab, but it's cheap enough for the casual fans. and it does free up some room in your collection (doesn't take up that much room compared with the other versions). Solike I said for die-hards I'd say look elsewhere, for casual fans, this will probably be enough for you. And this comment has nothing to do with this set per se, but I feel the last two movies (Book 7) should have been combined into one longer movie rather than two seperate ones.  They say it was needed to cover the material, but even with two movies they still overlooked so much material that their point is rendedred moot. If kids are going to wait outside stores until after midnight to buy a book and then read it in one night, then they'd definitely sit through a three hour plus movie. It's all about the money though. I just think it detracts from an overall great franchise. But you can't go wrong with the movies, or the books...especially with the books. I'd recommend reading them first before seeing the movies, and just don't let the omissions bother you too much. The performances are great and the special effects are awesome. So enjoy.

B003MC5N28|5.0|The Giver won a myriad of awards and deserved every one. My criteria for awarding my 5 stars is, \\"Will I remember this story next week and does it leave me pondering the book's ending?\\" The Giver makes us think about freedom at the most basic level. We must also ponder which is more important, freedom or safety, having needs immediately satisfied through keeping people ignorant or allowing people to make their own decisions though they won't have the cushion of large numbers of people to accomplish goals. Can people live with harsh punishments for breaking miniscule rules? The Giver asks us to ponder many such questions and to contemplate how the story may relate to our own government and how our liberty and freedoms have been and continue to be diluted and even stolen by socialistic leaders.
0307888908|4.0|If anyone gives this book 5 stars they are full of cr@p! It is hardly long enough to be called a book. It is not well organized, nor is it well written. It comes off as preachy from time to time. And it tries to draw an analogy between being an entrepreneur and being a worker in control of his career. Let's get this straight at the outset: Building a career is not the same thing as building a company. An entrepreneur creates things whereas an employee works for someone else. And since the book tries to make some sort of analogy, it is clearly flawed in so many ways. But the gist of the book is worthy.<br /><br />Its gist is as follows:<br /><br />1. Your career is in trouble if you either are, or should be, afraid of where you'd be if you lost your current job. And every employee today can easily lose their job.<br />2. Take control of your career so you won't be afraid of losing your job. First figure out who you are, what you want to do, and where you can fit in to do it.<br />3. Second strategize and plan what you need to do to take charge of your situation.<br />4. Third strengthen your relationships and build a professional network. This network must include powerful alliances and a diverse mix of relationships.<br />5. Work your plan as you continue to build your network.<br />6. Take intelligent risks.<br />7. Keep in mind the plan is very important, but the quality of your network is critical. Life, including your work life, is a team sport.<br /><br />These seven points coincide with the seven chapters of the book. Unfortunately they are not the chapter titles used in the book except for Chapter 6.<br /><br />Since the book is co-written by the founder of the online site LinkedIn, I would have liked some coverage on how best to use LindedIn to build a professional network that includes powerful alliances and a diverse mix of relationships. We don't get that in this book. Could have been a nice appendix if it had been included.<br /><br />Since I like the gist of the book I suppose I could say I liked the book (4 stars). But it has so many problems as touched upon above. I could just as easily say I disliked the book (2 stars). And if I take the average of 4 and 2 I'd be left with an OK book (3 stars).

B00457WZEI|4.0|War Horse was written from the horse's point of view as he grew up on a farm, then was sold to the military and put into service in Europe during The Great War--World War I. It is also the love story of a boy and his horse, the betrayal that caused the two to be separated and the long journey toward their reunion. I think this would be a great book to read to a child.

B004Q7CIFI|4.0|Aside from the burdening length of this fantasy, I just can't find anything wrong with it. King is a master storyteller and, in this story, he tries to rewrite an American tragedy. It evokes pain of the 'Where were you when President Kennedy was shot?' variety. It explores such themes as: What is the value of one man?..a great man? What power does each action confer on the actor? Is the butterfly effect real? Should a deceased public figure be revered down through the generations for, in part, how he died? Would he have wanted that kind of reverence? Like all aspects of the Kennedy assassination, this book evokes more questions than answers and forces each reader to think, analyse and ponder it all. On a personal note, this reader wishes all God's blessings on Carolyn and her children and thank them for their sacrifice for our country.  On a lighter note, I got a kick out of the characters from King's other books popping up in the course of our hero's travels through 1958 Maine. It made me want to reread all those old books, some of my favorite reading of all time. (That was back when my nerves could take a good scare).

0312427646|5.0|This slight volume, a novella, is a wonderful counterpoint to the serious and respectful content of Sally Bedell Smith's \\"Elizabeth the Queen,\\" a celebration of the 60th anniversary of the Queen's accession to the throne.  It is cheeky in a very British way.  It doesn't take itself seriously.  It is a lovely read!<br /><br />The story begins when the Queen, trying to herd her naughty dogs, discovers by accident a kitchen boy, Norman, reading a book in a mobile library on the palace grounds.  Curious as ever, the Queen inquires of the driver about the library, and finally, signs out a book.  Having discovered the joys of reading, she is hooked. Her private secretary is a New Zealander who snobbishly thinks that it isn't proper for the Queen to set herself apart from the people by an intellectual pursuit.  He also resents Norman's rise in fortune to waiting upon the Queen.<br /><br />Driving to the Opening of Parliament the Queen beguiles the time by reading and at the same time giving the royal wave to the assembled multitudes.  After the ceremonies, during which she recognizes that the speech she is reading is terrible prose, she discovers that security has probably exploded her book on the theory that it was a bomb.  This reminds her of the increasing hostility her reading has engendered.  Even her dogs resent the refocus of her attention and show it by maiming any handy volume.<br /><br />Her family is another matter.  They are delighted that her attention is more on her books than on them.  However, their enthusiasm is dampened when she starts giving books as presents and then examining the recipients on the text.<br />Encouraged by the kitchen boy she has a garden party for the literati and finds herself feeling rather like a guest at her own party, unacknowledged by her guests.  She learns that the books are more interesting than their authors, and she is diverted to the classics, whose authors are safely dead.<br /><br />At length the wicked private secretary aided and abetted by others, engineer Norman's dismissal in the Queen's absence, to the University of East Anglia to study Literature.  No one could or would tell the Queen where he had gone.  As she continues without his guidance her reading becomes more and more catholic.  She also is paying less attention to her Royal duties.  The members of her household diagnose her malady as Alzheimer's.<br /><br />She has an epiphany which leads to the amusing end of the story.'s dismissal in the Queen's absence, to the University of East Anglia to study Literature.

B004UXUX4Q|5.0|Two big decisions that could forever affect your family's future are ahead of you. One of them already made, the other still being debated. Then you're hit with news you never saw coming and expected to deal with it quietly.<br /><br />  Matt King (played by George Clooney) is lawyer in Hawaii and, by virtue of his profession, the sole executor a family trust that controls 25,000 acres of untouched land on Kauai that they will lose relatively soon thanks to the rule against perpetuities. In addition, he is married with two daughters and their mother has been in a coma for six months since a boating accident and the terms of her living will dictate that she will soon be disconnected from life-support. His younger daughter, Scottie (played by Amara Miller), is unaware and is holding out hope that her mother will wake up. His seventeen year-old daughter, Alex (played by Shailene Woodley), is away at a reform school, of sorts, and stills bears a great deal of resentment for her mother as a result of being sent away. She claims the motivation for that decision was her discovery of her mother's infidelity and says as much to her father. First rejecting the idea, Matt (Clooney) eventually accepts it and then decides to confront the other man in her life, bringing his daughters along under the pretense of a much needed respite.<br /><br />  Hawaiian music isn't really my taste. Perhaps it's the tone, perhaps it's that I don't speak and could never learn the language. On the other hand, it does set the mood beautifully as do the many shots showcasing Hawaii's natural majesty. Clooney brings the conflict to life with a typically gripping performance and the cast all back him to varying degrees. I will say the part of Brian Speer, the man King (Clooney's) wife was having an affair with was not very well-acted by Matthew Lillard but it's a part with little screen time and few lines so it's forgivable. Buy this movie.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This is great. I love the auto-discovery feature using the gmail account. It actually saved me. I brought my tablet to school and the manual IP that I had entered wasn't working, but the google account auto discovery found my computer no problem. The application itself is great, too. It isn't laggy very much on the net, and across my home network, it streams near-seamlessly. I've actually played a game on this app. It also allows me to use all my windows applications on my Eee Pad Transformer, which is great, since, unfortunately, no application rivals Microsoft Office.

0345522478|5.0|I was determined to start the new year with a fresh start by trying out some new authors, so I was very curious about when The Druid Chronicles by Kevin Hearnes showed up on a couple of my recommended lists. This amazing new series more than delivered to be excellent Urban Fantasy.  Hounded is the first book in The Iron Druid Chronicles. The lead protagonist is a 2,000 Druid named Atticus O'Sullivan, owner of an occult bookstore and apothecary but he really is a druid in hiding. Atticus has been hounded for centuries by a Fae god who wants something very powerful that Atticus has.  Atticus is a fascinating and likeable lead; the secondary characters are an interesting spectrum of non-humans of werewolves, a vampire, witches, demons, Celtic gods and goddesses.  After burning out in disappointment with several PNR serials and irritated with the plethora of faux-Urban Fantasy drivel, Hearne's writing is a dynamic and refreshing return to exciting and original UF storytelling that is grounded in plausible Druid history and weaves an accurate portrayal of the Tuatha De Danann, Celtic, and Norse mythology.  Unquestionably, Hearne's riveting writing is an outstanding addition to the Urban Fantasy genre. I was so completely blown away with Hounded that I bought the next two in the series, Hexed and Hammered, and I can't wait for the fourth book, Tricked, due out in April. Very highly recommended, I look forward to immersing myself into this riveting series.

B005QJZ5FA|5.0|If you are a mature minded person who loves actual talent and not in your face ,obnoxious females like most female entertainers are today then you will LOVE this album. The people that say it sucks all seem to have other motives (you know, everybody likes this so I am going to hate it) and cant possibly have listened to all the songs if any.I just found out it went number 1 in 15 countries around the world ,THERE IS A REASON FOR THIS , and will be number 2 on billboard next week. I have purchased many albums in my life ,95% had 1 maybe 2 songs that were really good this album has no songs that I dont like and 10 that I love.The fact that the people saying negative things about this are so nasty tells you they know this is a great album and maybe they just want attention. I am glad I was not born that way. If you are not that way either buy this album and enjoy.
B001HN6918|5.0|Follows the story line and gives a bit more depth to who Po is. Great movie, watched it dozens of times with my kids.
B0071T5PN0|5.0|This is a shocking return to form. Their heaviest album since Fair Warning, it features Eddie blazing away on guitar like he hasn't in decades. For someone who has gone through so many problems over the years, it is amazing to hear him so thoroughly rejuvenated. Dave's voice has never been better--he has actually extended his upper non-falsetto register and is now actually singing rather than the singing/rapping mix he tended to favor the first time around. The vocals overall are just awesome--classic VH melody melded into unique arrangements over sledgehammer-heavy riffing. For those who feared that Mike's absence would leave a huge, unfillable hole, in comes Wolf, playing the best bass I've ever heard on a VH album and doing an astonishing job with the background vox, including passages where he hits the high notes in Anthony-esque fashion. How crazy is it that the perfect replacement for Mike ends up being Eddie's son? And how about Alex? What can I say, he's always been a monster, no change here--he sounds amazing as well. Some people are so put off with many of these songs being updated, new takes on old unreleased demos, and I don't understand what the problem is. VH has *always* mined the vaults for new ideas, going back to the earlier albums, and many bands do the same. It's still their own original stuff and it still explodes from the speakers quite satisfactorily. When it's this good, who cares where it came from or when it was written?  I was one of those that had basically sadly written off my favorite band forever after all the missteps since Balance. I am thrilled to have them back and in better shape than ever! I just turned 50 yesterday, and to have their triumphant return released a day after that is blowing me away. Can't wait to see them on tour this Spring.

1469984202|5.0|This review is for the e-book omnibus of the 5 Wool books:  I'm not a good review writer, but Wool deserves some kudos. First off, I delayed reading the last 10% of the book (yeah - I'm an e-reader, I go by percentages)... because I knew the story was coming to an end and I didn't want it to end. I wanted to stay in Juliette's world just a while longer so I put it off.  When I mentioned Wool to a friend today, he said, \\"I just started reading Hunger Games.\\"  I told him that Wool was a very different story, but he would like this series, as well.  Wool has that same emotional intensity, that same reality that you buy into with Hunger Games... making you want to stay in the story.  + The characters are very real - flawed but marvelously strong.  + The book has a plot that grabs you as oh-so-real - it could happen to you! (No spoilers here.  + Great e-book pricing, to boot.  No spoilers here - but what would you do in isolation?
B000KC8O3S|5.0|If you like a good classical score than this is for you. The orchestra comes through on this one. Most of the tracks are short so you don't get stuck with a theme that repeats over and over. The liner notes are also interesting to read (not the norm on most releases).  This was a good purchase for me and I will pick up some newer Doctor Who sound tracks in the future.
B001ECDVKE|5.0|Mars Attacks is not for everyone to see. It's humor is wacky to say the least, but is welcome for any movie buffs who are tired of this genres lack  of factual proof that aliens do exist. Having said that you may find the cast heavilly weighted with superstars only to find the most hilarious  belonging to the old lady in a nursing home that kills all the martians by playing a song that sounds alot like \\"Happy Trails\\", that ole cowboy song once played in the 40's or 50's. I'm too young to know those actual dates. In any case I did really enjoy this movie due to the campy but extrodinary special effects by  the film maker, Tim Burton. Jack Nicholson plays two characters that will make you wonder what made him take those roles, however again the roles played by the lesser known actors, actresses will be appreciated when you see Star Wars actress, Natalie Portman in a minor role which gives us the reason to figure out why she made it in other films afterwards due to her most apparent down to earth performance. This is a collector movie after all is done and said though.

B006OAB3ME|5.0|Dear Music Appreciators,<br /><br />If you've always wanted to get all up close and personal with \\"The Cute Beatle\\" then this may be the album for you.  Notice Paul with his arms full of flowers on the cover of his new album - an album loaded with his close-mic vocals on old-fashioned romantic standards...released just a week before Valentines' Day...he might as well be saying \\"will you be my valentine?\\"<br /><br />Whether it's a calculated marketing ploy or just a coincidence of timing, this is certainly a good album.  But it will probably divide some of McCartney's fans and may not win him many new ones outside of those who enjoy \\"the standards.\\"<br /><br />If you're looking for an album full of Beatlesque singer-songwriter brilliance then you'd best look elsewhere.  This is mostly jazzy, old-timey stuff from the 1920's and 30's that a young McCartney first heard from his father's piano.  In the same way that many actors just want to direct, there are many singers who just want to sing the standards, and thanks in part to Willie Nelson's 1978 blockbuster STARDUST many of them eventually do.  Rod Stewart is another prime example of a star who cashed in big on this same concept, though he drew a fair amount of criticism as well.  And then of course there's fellow Beatle Ringo Starr's 1970 effort SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY.<br /><br />After initially thinking \\"oh brother\\" (before hearing the album) I changed my tune pretty quickly about 25 seconds into the opening track - a 1935 tune that has been covered by a host of singers including Sinatra, Bing Crosby, Nat \\"King\\" Cole, and Dean Martin - McCartney gives it just the right amount of jazzy snazz and I found myself thinking \\"maybe he can do this after all - maybe he's just the right singer for the job.\\"<br /><br />For many music fans, their personal reaction to an album of cover songs can depend largely on their familiarity with the songs and the various previously released cover versions of those songs.  I'm guessing your average fan will know about half of these by title alone.  A personal high point of this record for me was the Irving Berlin classic \\"Always.\\"  McCartney gives a respectful and subtly nuanced performance, and I was unfamiliar enough with the song and all its versions so as to make this tune virtually new to me.  A low point was probably \\"Get Yourself Another Fool\\" but only because I was already familiar with a beautiful rendition by Patty Griffin on her LIVE FROM THE ARTISTS DEN album, and then after I heard McCartney sing it I decided to pull up an old Sam Cooke version, and...well let's just say Sam Cooke can sing.  Man can he sing.  I also discovered that \\"Home (When Shadows Fall)\\" is another tune that both McCartney and Sam Cooke have now covered, and again I was hooked on Sam Cooke's version.<br /><br />So thanks Paul for helping me realize how amazing Sam Cooke is (there are still some legends I just haven't gotten around to yet) and for delivering a stellar collection of standards just in time for V-Day.  McCartney's version of any of these songs could probably play in the background of some big budget romantic comedy while the leading characters canoodle each other all over New York City.<br /><br />There are in fact two McCartney originals on this album.  \\"My Valentine\\" is probably the most intriguing of the two because it seems to fit right in with the other songs, as if it was written 70 or 80 years ago - and if it was I'm betting it would have been heavily covered and perhaps even  have found its own slot in \\"The Great American Songbook.\\"<br /><br />If you only want pop-rock music from pop-rock legends then you should turn around and walk away, but if you're open-minded and feel like you could use some old school atmospheric romance in your life, then this album will give you a nice little injection of exactly what you're looking for.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Constant Listeneralone.

B006UG90RM|5.0|Rest assured, a repeat of VH3 hasn't happened here.<br />The more I listen to it the more I absolutely love it! There are some really good songs, with great moments in a lot of places. THANK YOU Van Halen!!<br />Nobody plays like Eddie. He doesn't introduce any new guitar pyrotechnics here but he playes every bit as good as he did 30 years ago. The guy's still got it!<br />Dave's voice isn't as bad as some of the reviews here say. He's about where he was in 1996 when VH came out with the first \\"Best Of\\" album- but he really sounds like the old Dave at times. GREAT to hear!<br />On the DVD- It's a short 4 song acoustic session with Panama, Beautiful Girls, You and Your Blues, one one other (maybe just the intro/jive talk Dave does). They were really having a good time playing Panama, that was good to see.<br />Unless it's hidden in some Easter egg somewhere, the live song \\"You Really Got Me\\" that they released online isn't on this DVD. That was disappointing, but maybe they're going to put out a whole show like this later, who knows?<br />I really hope they put out a blu-ray of some of the recent shows.
0439023548|5.0|Finished the Trilogy in about a week. After Hunger Games I could not wait to get the other two books so I downloaded them from Amazon.  Unconventional because I believe the negative comments are a result of those expecting the typical ending where the Hero of the story comes through virtually unscathed.  Frodo, in Lord of the Rings, is an example of a Non-Hero like Katniss. He needed Sam to carry him through and I still feel Sam is the real hero, not Frodo. Katniss needed the example and assistance provided by others to help her through her mental issues too.  Katniss's emotional and mental state was inevitable when you take the other Victor's lives, presented in books one and two (Haymitch, Fannick, Annie,etc),and her upbringing into account.  I wasn't sure where the Author was going in book two but, for me, it came together in Mockingjay. Yeah, the ending was a little cliche but it did not take away from the overall story.
B006OAB3ME|1.0|I've always maintained that, when a prolific songwriter releases an LP of standards, the well has run dry. This collection does nothing to change my opinion.  And, after having a remarkable voice until very late in life, these songs show that it is now officially shot.  Not a good album. Not well-sung. And one of the worst LP titles that I can recall, to boot!
B004EPZ0AM|1.0|Terrible movie. Quite possibly the worst I've ever seen. It was actually offensive to me.  I wish I could give it a negative score.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|To be honest I can't really find many things wrong with it. The case does it's job, and mindfully keeps the speakers and inputs uncovered. The fold-holder \\"feature\\" works to keep the kindle standing up, and the case looks fine, very minimalistic. Price is still a bit much (to me) for a case, but I don't believe its enough to knock a star off. Had the cover since Christmas and its shown no signs of breaking or wearing out too quickly.

Diverges somewhat from what happens in the Halo:Reach game (came out well before the game did, and Reach is actually a small part of the book) but fleshes out the Master Chief nicely.
B000DWMN2S|5.0|You'll laugh and cry throughout this movie. We especially enjoyed the disparity between the translated and spoken word when presented with the corresponding sub-title.

B001BWQVSG|5.0|This is the best bargain I've seen in the recording business. All 8 CDs of Ms. Argerich's solo recordings with Grammophon for this price is astounding!! But the price is just the beginning. Once you start listening to her music, you will have a sample of what a true artist is really about. Technique, concept, openness, fearlessness and depth is the recipe for being the master that she is.

B0071T5PN0|3.0|I love Van Halen and like everyone else have waited a very long time for this album to surface.  At first listen, Van Halen is back.  After a second listen you realize that the music is great but the vocals?.. Sounds more like a struggling lead singer trying to find his old voice.  I'm sorry to say but the return of DLR was a mistake.  Bottom line is...Great music with poor vocals.  I think I hear Sammy laughing somewhere!

This is going to be something I listen to over and over.  Just downloaded it from the Cloud today and have it on my phone, and know this is one I will listen to constantly.  I am not discounting his wonderful songs that he has written and recorded, but his version of these classics, WOW!!!

B006UG90RM|5.0|You can see the haters coming from a mile away: Cheesy 80's band! It's got no Hagar! Roth is past his peak (or never had one)! No Van Halen without Mike! They raided the archives and reworked outtakes and demos!  But I say, face `em with a smile and turn up the volume, `cause this album is absolutely insane!  Okay, I admit it, I'm a huge fan. To me, VH are the Beatles on steroids. But boy, did they exceed my expectations on this one.  Just to get this out of the way, Beats Workin' and Tattoo don't excite me much, and Bullethead is a bit too punky for my taste. But that leaves 10 tracks that range from really good to brilliant.  The one thing that is practically never mentioned in mainstream reviews of Van Halen is the fact that Ed&Al are probably the tightest, and most adventurous rhythm section around in rock. That was the case in 1978, and I'm happy to say, that's still the case today! Wolf ain't no filler either. I'll continue:  Is it fun? Check. (sooo happy there's at least still one serious band NOT contemplating the various nuances of the agony of living. Dave's on fire!).  Good songs? Check. (great actually, and they are concise and to the point too!)  Does it groove? Check. (try not to move your body as you listen to THIS - I dare you)  Melodies? Check.  (everywhere)  Harmonies there? Check. (yep, even without Mike)  Killer riffs? Check. (everywhere)  Is it original? Check. (I don't care if THEY came up with it before...no-one else did since)  Is it inspired? Check. (can you believe these guys are in their 50's??)  Diverse? Check. (heavy on the up-tempo scorchers, but if you're into rock, there's something there for each mood you're in)  Does it surprise? Check. (each song has a twist...from the solo in She's The Woman to the tonality of HoneyBabySweetieDoll)  Brown sound? Check. (great tone Ed! And Al of course)  Seriously, what else do you want in an album?? Forget all the BS and just enjoy!

B006E4QCXU|4.0|Gravilux is an entertaining and relaxing way to kill time when you need to do something like stand in line, entertain an unruly child for a few minutes, or just need to spend a few minutes thinking things over yourself.  A useful tool for meditation, the changing colors (the colors can be set to random in the App settings) and patterns can help you calm and center yourself.  This was the Free App of the Day, but quite possibly worth the purchase price.
B004EPZ07K|1.0|This is a weak story, told in a clumsy way. It lacked the fun, wonderment, excitment, action, adventure, comedy, love interest that a super hero film should have. The final showdown (with the bad guy a giant smoky octapus thing...with a human head!) is particularly dreary. Mark Strong (Sinestro) made an impression, and the wonderful Angela Bassett also, even with maybe only four lines. Seems like the ring's power could have been used in more creative and interesting ways. Turning a crashing helicopter into a race car on an elevated track...huh?
1401201911|4.0|Red Son is the ultimate alternate-timeline DC comic. It's a thrilling story that illuminates the great contradiction of Superman, between his loyalty to his native country and his raw idealism. I have my nitpicks (Would Superman really be OK with turning people into cyborgs? What's Batman's motivation for being a Soviet dissident?), but altogether I consider this one of the few mainstream superhero comics worth reading.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|I love this show I havent seen anything like it before and fell in love instantly. the characters are so real and the dialogue is great i love wity characters who come together i would def recommend this to people who enjoy mystery/cop shows :)
B00656C6KK|4.0|The CD is very good.  I especially like the song that her son sang.  She has a beautiful voice and I'm glad she finally made a new CD.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I enjoy this Bible app, haven't explored all of it yet, but like it do far. Like the ease of using it.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Exactly what we expected!! This is my sons favorite movie.  He loves it!! I ordered it right after the holidays because all the stores had gotten rid of all their holiday stuff. I was very happy to be able to find it on amazon!
1402760663|5.0|I recommend to any one interested in the history of the American Indian to purchase; Bury my Heart at Wounded Knee by Dee Brown. The illustrated Edition. This well researched book with photographs explains what really happened. How these innocent people were so badly treated.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I have tried many remote desktop apps and this is by far the best in my opinion. Everything is smooth, the sound can be muted on my home computer while it plays over my phone, and there are many intuitive ways to manipulate the interface.
B00102F5WK|5.0|This dvd did not play in my dvd player but I was able to play on my pc which is ok but would like to watch it on tv. was in great condition and also the case. delivered on time.
0736092269|5.0|At first this looks like the perfect strength training book for nerds or bookworms, but after spending a night reading through this I've come to realize that this is by far the best book on strength training I've ever read. It's attention to detail is immaculate if you're a novice looking to get started or experience lifter this is for you.
B0071T5PN0|4.0|The title of my review says it all.  Eddie is on his game.  A 70's hard rocker that rocks with the best of them.  After listening to the album, i understand why tattoo was the first single.  With that being said Tattoo is probably the weakest song on the album.  This album is an Eddie Van Halen showcase.  Buy it!!!!!
B001O2ZW1A|5.0|A well produced sound hard, but introspective, mysterious and well-designed effects. Clearly shows the line of Steven Wilson and remembers some of the albums of Porcupine Tree. Those who like the band is certainly a good recommendation and also for those who like Pink Floyd and want to hear something different. The DVD audio is spectacular and full of excellent shape the sound of this production.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|they always want to play the games. the games are challenge for my 12 and 4 year old. wish their was more of these games.
B006UG90RM|5.0|This entire album is better than i expected.  My only complaint, was the wait. Thanks to the entire Band. see you guys in concert soon.
1440503257|4.0|I placed this on my wish list mainly because I am a fan of the Harry Potter Franchise.  I adore the books and enjoy the movies (though I have my issues with them).  Any way, I was gifted with this book at Christmas. I have tried four recipes and every one of them has turned out to be very tasty.  My husband says if you get one good recipe from a cookbook, it's worth the price. Well, this one is definitely worth it. I have only tried savory recipes and am looking forward to tackling some of the sweets.
B000002LFZ|3.0|Few albums have had the impact of Fleetwood Mac's RUMOURS, which catapulted their career in the 70's as one of rock/pop's most successful bands.<br />This 16 track collection includes all the smash hits from RUMOURS and other songs they hit the charts with.  Two new tunes were also added for this greatest hits compilation.  I never fully jumped on the FM bandwagon but do enjoy some of their songs.  Mac had a way of taking simple lyrics and melodies and make their music infectious.  DREAMS for instance is basically a two-chord song enhanced by the recognizable bass support and Stevie Nicks sinewy vocals.  Therefore it became their only #1 US hit.<br />My personal faves:  the pounding drive of GO YOUR OWN WAY;  the irresistibly bouncy EVERYWHERE; the thrust of YOU MAKE LOVIN' FUN; the romping TUSK, marching band and all; the emotional build in SARA; the erotic undertones of BIG LOVE and the rhythmic energy of OVER MY HEAD--and yes, the sheer hypnotism of DREAMS.<br />I think Christine McVie is a better vocalist but the witchy eroticism of Nicks became their most recognizable trait.<br />A must for anyone who wants to experience those glorious seventies.
B005EWDAFQ|3.0|I am a huge Robert Harris fan, but i have to say this was for me his most disappointing book so far.  It's hard to describe why it's so disappointing without spoilering the story, but after about a quarter of the book I started to worry that the author surely wouldn't just be reusing a hackneyed, done-to-death sci-fi plot that's been around since the 60's.  But by half way through it was almost impossible to deny that that was where the story was going.  I have actually launched (an unsuccessful) quantitative hedge fund previously and his research on the ins and outs of quant hedge funds, their activities and their characters felt very authentic.  He did his research well there.  Unfortunately his research into artificial intelligence, another central theme of the book, seems to have come straight from watching 1970's reruns of The Outer Limits.  As with all of Harris's books the writing is tight and engrossing, and it is an easy book to read in a day or two without putting down.  But unlike many of his other books which are creative and original, as well as meticulously researched, this one is slow, unoriginal and predictable.  As the master writer he is, it is still a very good read, but don't expect another Lustrum, Enigma or Pompei.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this has a lot of fun original games that you must work for to achieve. great game!! some of the games may be a little boring but there are plenty of time wasters
B000FBJF3M|5.0|A very enjoyable historical fiction book that takes you back in time and creates an interesting sideline plot in the last days of Pompeii.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|it is fun at first but after the first few weeks it can get boring but it is a little fun
B00542USJW|1.0|Studio execs had just one goal in mind: combine two popular things (Looney Tunes and Micheal Jordan), no matter how disparate and unrelated they might be, and just throw them into a movie together. Heck, they've been doing it in commercials for a long time, why not a feature length film? Why indeed.<br /><br />Everything else about this movie from the script to the direction flowed from that inherently flawed and nonsensical choice. And from junk comes junk. Hence, Space Junk.<br /><br />I don't actually hate this movie quite as much as I sound, but it's high rating on Amazon really ticks me off. This really is not any good.
B0068RHGJM|3.0|Do not buy this album unless you must have every Nightwish album (which I have).  I have listened to this album multiple times before coming to the conclusions here.  I felt compelled to write this review after coming in from a walk after skipping so many tracks while listening to this on my iPhone.  I recommend just buying selected tracks and avoiding the rest of this album.  I highly recommend the following tracks to download:  Storytime, Ghost River, I Want My Tears Back, Scaretale (despite the hideous male vocal at the end which is truly dreadfully awful), Last Ride of the Day, and Song of Myself (despite the vapid voiceovers at the end of the track).  If you want a nice instrumental overature of the entire album, also download Imaginaerum, but it is not a must have like the other tracks I recommend.  I am a big Nightwish fan but can only recommend 6 tracks and on two of those the songs have abysmal endings, one with a hideous (and not in anything approaching a good sense of hideous) vocal and another with blah, blah, blah interminable voiceovers.  I was excited when my favorite group, Nightwish, was coming out with a concept album.  Sorry, but this album is misconception.  The tracks that are not recommended are either out of the symphonic metal genre and not very good in whatever genre they may belong, or pathetically boring, repetitive and derivative.
0385534639|3.0|This is the author's first novel, and it shows.  The writing is good, the descriptions solid, and the setting is certainly imaginative, but the character development is very lacking.  I read the book for book club, and we all had several unanswered questions such as \\"Why did Marco and Celia fall in love?\\"  \\"How was Bailey qualified to take over Marco's magic?\\"  I won't list them all here, but I will say that all loose ends had to do with characters - their motivations, histories, agendas, etc.  Curious to see what she writes next.  I read that this book has been compared to Harry Potter, which accounts for some of the hype, but I found it nothing like HP.  Sure both have highly imaginative settings, but in HP, the characters drive the story. In NC, the circus takes front stage, and the characters are the backdrop.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|I love this series and was glad that I got the complete set it was a must after getting the first series.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|i love Sherlock Holmes. the vibe from the actors is increadible - the chemistry amazing. that is my favorite part. it's a fabulous movie. a bit too much violence for my taste - i'm just way sensitive.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|a must have after watching the shows on tv and I absolutely loved having the complete set to watch whenever I wanted to.
0790731924|2.0|i got this for my husband as a christmas present. i watched these with my dad as a kid (the TV version) and didn't enjoy it as much as i remember. plus the F word was mentioned maybe 50 times in the movie. a turn off for sure.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|it has been so long since I've played chess the com just manhandles me like some dirty socks left on the floor
B00004Z4WR|5.0|i bought this for my husband for a Christmas present. he loves and obsesses about cars. :) it's the perfect movie. even i enjoy watching it. it's a great movie. there is a ton of humor and the sexy angelina jolie helps too. :)
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Just give it a try, you will not be dissapointed! It starts slow but this is necessary due to the proportion of characters and stories that are gonna happen later. But slow don't meen boring! It only means that mind-blow everyone is talking about will come to you gradualy as the story unfolds, or better yet, folds. After watching this i read the books and all i can say is that the first season, as great as it is, is only the begining. And if writers can keep up good work we are probably talking about best tv show of all time. Every second of attention u give to the show gets rewarded plenty afterwards. Even tho its supposed to be fantasy, that is very missleading. Its a story about people who live in the world where some fantasy exists. This story and the world are more realistic then 99% of shows that are placed in a \\"real world\\".  I honestly believe that people who write negative reviwes are just too lazy to try and figure out what happens here. And for those who rate it bad for sex scenes, please go watch Teletabies. In 10 hours of pure awsomnes there are only 3 sex scenes that we could have lived without, but even they provide important info, cause just as people talk while eating dinner, people talk before, after and even during sex, as well as during hot bath time.  After watching first season I could only cry for more, and I thank the Seven that this was done as series and not movie.
075640407X|4.0|First and foremost I should say that I have enjoyed this book and, because I did, I have already ordered the second part of the series. Its an entertaining book, but in my opinion it does not warrant a 5 star rating because of a few short comings.  Characters lack depth; With the exception of Kvothe and perhaps Denna everyone is clearly either good or evil. Whether they are good or evil becomes obvious immediately when they are introduced, and so far every character in the book has stuck to their role. Kvothe's friends at the university are also pretty flat, I have no idea why they are his friends except for what seems to be random coincidence.  While the writing in the book overall is good, at certain times the resolution of the subplots becomes a bit predictable, at times I could predict exactly what was going to happen next. It didnt happen very often throughout the book, but when it did happen it did annoy me to see the predictions actually coming true. Occasionally I was reminded a bit of listening to someone talk about their D&D, WoW, or any other RPG alt when reading descriptions of all Kvothe's abilities and fast pace of learning.  Despite these drawbacks I am still curious to see how the story evolves. Having Kvothe tell his own story is a very interesting mechanic, and I am hoping it will lead to interesting conclusions. The series has potential, and since it is the authors first I am hoping that the flaws will smoothen out along the way.
1451648537|5.0|I have struggled getting into biographies lately, but truly enjoyed this book about Steve Jobs. When I saw it was over 500 pages I never thought I would get all the way through. Not only did I finish, but I made it through in just a couple of weekends. No doubt Walter Isaacson could not do or print everything, but I felt he captured the essence of Steve Jobs. I did not study him like others, nor do I have a lot of Apple's products, but I was impressed with the quality that went into each design.  The honesty Steve Jobs used and Walter Isaacson used was refreshing. A couple of the chapters may be considered slow, but enjoyed the chapters on Toy Story and Pixar (my son loves Buzz and Woody!), design principles, and building the Mac. Would have been wild and intimidating to be in the room with him and build something to hear his critique. The last chapter about his legacy was touching ans almost worth the book alone (along with his personal insights sprinkled throughout the book).  When talking to Yo Yo Ma \\"you playing is the best argument I've ever heard for the existence of God, because I don't really believe anyone alone can do this.\\" He made Ma promise to play at his funeral.  As a big Bob Dylan fan would love to see someone like Walter Isaacson to do his. Dylan, like Steve Jobs, is a once in a generation type guy that has left their mark and changed the world. Pretty cool, enjoy the book!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its fun even if some of the games are simple I love it. I just started playing it but its a lot of fun
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Love it, and love that someone is doing the Myst-Clone adventure on phones. Just wish it weren't so short! Bought and finished in bed in one Sunday morning.
B0019BI1FA|5.0|In my dvd collection this stays near the top of the stack.  I find myself returning to view one of these four plays every two or three months.  Smart, positive and fun good humor.  Enjoy it..
B0073LWEXK|1.0|Man im sick of buying apps from amazon that dont work :-( Don't buy fire optimus v.  It won't install.  Sucks!!!!!
0439023491|4.0|The author may have copied the format from the first book, but just enough changes were made to keep it engaging. The new tribute characters were just as interesting as the first set. My only gripe is that by far, the arena is the most exciting part of the series. I thought too much time was spent on the boring District 12 crap. I wish they had devoted less time to District 12 and much more to the Quarter Quell. Still a very good book.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|decent game. kept me entertained for a good couple of days. pretty basic though and gets boring rather quick. hence the 3 stars
0439023513|2.0|***SPOILERS***  I'll just say what I liked about the finale and what I didn't like. The first two books were so good, I really hope they make changes to the story to avoid a disaster with the 2-part movie finale.  What I liked:  a) Who Katniss ended up with  What I disliked:  a) It went from an exotic series about deathmatches in creative arenas to the second half of Full Metal Jacket. I love Full Metal Jacket, but this series should never have gone in that direction.  b) The whole Peeta/Gale back and forth really got boring. Make up your mind already, you've had two books to do it.  c) Really? Shooting arrows at hovercrafts? Propos? Come on...give me some Capitol tributes and put them into the arena against the rebels. That would have been a great way to settle it. Not Katniss shooting arrows and taking down airships.  d) The whole war zone theme completely obliterated Finnick's character. He had no place in an army. He was a fisherman with skill using a trident. And his transformation is assisted by a trident boomerang? Seriously? He was a very cool part of Catching Fire and he was wasted in this book.  e) What's cool about an underground quasi-prison?  f) Katniss doesn't address the love triangle until the last few pages of the book. Way too little and way too late.  Very, very disappointing end to what was a great series up until the horribly boring story of District 13 began.
B0071T5PN0|5.0|I really love this album. It sounds so much like the old school Van Roth albums. I'm so glad to see that David Lee Roth got back with the band. Don't get me wrong, Sammy was good with the band, but David Lee Roth rocks out the hardest when he is with Van Halen. They have been absent for so long that I was beginning to think that they were done forever. Thank you Lord for hearing my prayers and getting back the one band in history that I truly enjoy listening to. LONG LIVE VAN HALEN!!!!!<br /><br />Update: After listening to this album several times, I must say that I like it as much as their 1984 Album. It grew on me the more I listened to it. Great album from one of history's greatest bands.
B003L77G10|5.0|This is the best most riveting series on TV. I'm waiting for season 3 to become available for purchase. I so enjoy watching the series on DVD, while the show is on hiatus.
B004I744AS|5.0|this app is great. i use it for alot of my homework (especially biology) and it will give you the biological term of that word. its great i love this app
B00005NMVP|1.0|I bought this CD in the beginning of January and it took 20 days to arrive.  Once I finally got the package I gave to my husband as a birthday present. After 2 weeks he finally told me this is not the original CD, it is another version with different songs  and a little speech between each song. It was too lat for me to returned. I just wished a little information somewhere. Very disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really love the variety of games. there ate no lag problems. I recommend this application because it doesn't get boring.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Totally worth the money to buy this one!  Must see , if you were born after this time period.   A real eyeopener!'Educational in a brilliantly funny way.Great actors.  I will watch this one again! It will open your heart and your mind. Don't  Miss this one
0803730470|5.0|My son received this book as a gift from a friend and we love it.  He is still too young to understand it (3 months old) but we read it frequently before he goes to bed.  Mommy and daddy enjoy the book very much.  We look forward to having him understand the book and are sure we'll continue enjoying it for a long time to come.  It is now one of the books we give to other babies/kids.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire. I'm 14 years old and my favorite game is well I thank you know it is solitaire.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is great!! I play it all the time, works perfect with my kindle fire. great if you're looking to pass the time by
B006UG90RM|5.0|Finally, a new Van Halen album.  It didn't look like it would ever happen for many, many years- but they have come roaring out of the gates here, as they did on the debut & 5150.  Eddie absolutely shreds on this album- some of his heaviest and most impressive guitar work ever.  DLR still sounds exactly like DLR, full of over the top humour and swagger(a good thing!), Alex is huge on drums and Wolfie is great on bass and a good soy substitute for Michael Anthony on the high background vocals.  The songs are fantastic, this is the hardest rocking VH album ever- while still being very much in the style and spirit of classic VH.  No power ballads here- it is balls out rock all the way, and very entertainingly so.  Production is crystal clear, perfect.  The album went to #2 on the US charts, spawned a successful US arena tour, and has sold about 900,000 worldwide- not bad, all these years later, in this day and age. Overall, this is a stunning comeback record that should thrill loyal fans and win over a chunk of newbies, too! One (final?) classic VH album right here, folks. Don't miss the party.
B006OKOZGU|5.0|Paramount is finally issuing it's only Hitchcock title on blu-ray! I'm sure the restoration will be clean, sharp and colorful. They've been good with their classics so  far..so let's hope. This film won an Academy Award for best color cinematography. Two great stars on the French riviera...bring it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is an awesome game! I could play it all day! everyone should give these games a try. these games are a lot of fun and can keep you very entertained.
B0071T5PN0|5.0|Van Halen somehow captured the magic 18 years later. It helped that they used the old demos as a starting point, but really allowing Dave to steer the ship (at least lyrically) is the big gain here. This record is HEAVY, it's a tank rolling down a suburban street running over compact cars and flying a pirate flag that was thankfully found in the attic (admit Hagar era VH was not exactly controversial) Dave is 100% counterculture, living by the Tao of Dave and Dave only. The VH brothers have had since 1998 to get the music right and they did a killer job. Wolf's bass (if he did play and not Ed)sounds more like Billy Sheehan than Mikey, which gives the CD an \\"eat em and smile\\" feel as well. Short answer, hide your daughters, Van Halen are back!
1451627289|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book! I hadn't read a King book in almost 20 years and thought he really hit it out of the park with this one. I also never had much interest in the Kennedy assassination but this peaked my interest. He really did a great job with a story line in two different eras in American history. I highly recommend this book to anyone. Some of my friends have mentioned not being able to stomach Stephen King stories due to the horror but there's none of that here, just a great time travel story with great twists and turns along the way.
B0055SWM08|5.0|A game that makes you think. Very good graphics and plenty of levels to keep you entertained. Money well spent.
B0000A5BTV|5.0|This movie touched my heart. The story between the two lovers makes the movie more and more entertaining as you watch it unfold. I thought it wouldn't speak to me, but it did. You really need to watch this movie in order to understand the true heartfelt meaning behind it. Enjoy!
B005T87QCI|1.0|I beat the whole game and its really boring if you want to get this app don't. waste of money
0446573019|1.0|It was not worth reading this book. No build up of the bad guys, no menu of potential bad guys, no depth. At the end of the book the real bad guy ends up someone who had a very minor role. Save your money and time.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The ease of use is what I love the most about this app. I actually look forward to my daily Bible reading time more now...with all the daily reading plans to choose from.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the game is very addicting and fun but the ads are really annoying.  some games are more challenging than others but good way to kill time.
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|Fifty Shades......I wish there were more.  What an amazing trilogy.  It has everything.  I'm anxiously waiting for more novels from this author.  I would honestly give it 10 stars. The characters in this book are perfectly portrayed.  What can I say? I read Fifty Shades Freed in one sitting.  Enjoy!  I envy those that haven't started yet. I'd like to do it all over again:D
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its awesome and it is a great app that you can learn stratagy from and you can have fun it ROCKS
B005MRXS78|1.0|I'm sad to say that this pan/tilt head was a big disappointment.  It's made of cheap plastic and is way too flimsy for my Sony HD camera which only weighs about 5 lbs.  It says it holds up to 8 lbs, but if it does, it doesn't do it very well.  The Infra red remote is a joke.  The panning is extremely glitchy, it stops and starts randomly during rotation.  The tilt function is virtually useless when I put the HD camera on it, it just cannot tilt that much weight (again, 5 lbs).  I even tried my little 2 lb DSLR, and it did tilt that, but it was still glitchy just like the pan.  In my opinion, unless you're using this for a small security camera or baby monitor, you should probably look elsewhere.
B006H3MIV8|5.0|This gets an extra star for supporting Amnesty International and another for several truly inspired covers. Three stars raised to five.<br /><br />Of course, Bob Dylan has been covered to death over the years. It seems everyone has wanted a shot at interpreting one of his brilliant songs. Unfortunately, some should restrain themselves. There are a number of covers here that are not only some of the worst covers of a Bob Dylan song ever, but among the worse sounds ever committed to a recording device.<br /><br />But fear not, most are at least average or better and there is a ton of good material for the money. If you're like me, you'll also find some truly excellent covers that will only add to your enjoyment of certain Dylan tunes. The covers by The Nightwatchman (Tom Morello), Sinead O'Connor, Johnny Cash and several others did that for me.<br /><br />I imagine a lot of people would be surprised that Miley Cyrus does a song on here, and might be even more surprised to hear that it's quite good. But really, it's the surprises that draw a lot of us to these sort of albums. Chimes of Freedom: The Songs of Bob Dylan has quite a few - both good and bad.
1857885082|5.0|This is probably the funniest, most entertaining book I've ever read about English culture. The author is very witty, yet teaches you a lot about British culture. Highly recommended!
B006UG90RM|5.0|Got this album on Monday and these were my thoughts Monday night.  Just got done listening to the last song. It was a great day here in upper NY to get the new VH album. It hit about 60 degrees and was nice and sunny. So it had that spring time VH feel!!!! I listened to the whole thing in my car driving here to there. To me the Car is the perfect place for VH. I had to listen to the last three tracks in the cold evening hours but thats all good.  Because.......  This album kicks so much butt. It is just great. I don't even know how to put it into words. Sure I am a bit of a VH fan boy but I know when to call a spade a spade and if this album was a poor outing I would have said it. I think I was most impressed with Dave. He managed to really capture his old VH sound. I never really cared for his solo work or how he sang on it and after Tattto I was worried he would sound that way for the whole album (Tatto has grown on me but it is the odd man out song) But Dave sounds great here. If Wolfie is playing his part and not his Dad then he did an outstanding job also. Alex and Ed sound great but I expected that if the songs delivered and they did. My only wish is that I never had the Gene Simmons demos so this whole album could sound brand new. But I love what they did with those tunes so it's not really a complaint.  Thank you Ed, Alex, Wolfie, and Dave!!!!!!!!  I have decided to add to the review since I have had a chance to listen to the album many more times.  Let me first say that I love VH. I love Roth era VH the most but I really Like 5150 and OU812 with sammy also. Not a huge fan of For unlawful C. K. but there are some great tunes on it. Balance is by far their worst album - Just awful and III is not as bad as so many say but it is a bit of a mess and far from perfect. I like some of Sammy's Solo work and hated Chickenfoot I but really enjoyed Chickinfoot III.  As for ADKOT, I would say the new album fits in very nicely with the first six albums. It has that classic VH vibe, Is it perfect? Well I would have to listen to is a billion times like I have with the first six albums to see if it has that timeless perfection. But as of right now it's pretty darn great!!  1. Tattoo - This song is OK and has grown on me but it's just so strange that it's on this album. Sounds nothing like the rest of the tracks  2. She's The Woman  - An old Demo that sounds great. Great riff, catchy chorus, and lots of fun!  3. You and Your Blues - Good tune. Takes a few listens to take it all in but after that I find that a really enjoy this one. love the background vocals in this one.  4. China Town - I love this tune! Has that Mean Streets anger vibe going on. A fast rocker!  5. Blood and Fire - What a great tune. Cut from the same mold as Dance the Night Away. A fun pop song!  6. Bullethead - Not the best chorus but has that Loss of Control, On Fire vibe where the good outweighs the bad.  7. As Is - Another fast heavy Rocker. The chrous is a bit all over the place but this tune is fun.  8. Honeybabysweetiedoll - This song is all over the place. It's more of an Instrmental and reminds me of House of Pain becasue of that. I did this tune but I can see many not careing for it.  9. The Trouble With Never - New song that sounds great. Great catchy chorus. Sounds right at home with the CVH.  10. Outta Space - Another redo that is so much fun you can't help but love it.  11. Stay Frosty - It's more then just an Ice Cream Man sequal. It's a great song on it's own.  12. Big River - Best of their old Demos sounds great updated  13. Beats Workien' - Another old Demo that perfectly finishes out the album. A great fun Song!  What can I say, I Love this album. So much fun. So much Rock. So Much VAN HALEN!!!!
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I read the Hunger Games series and was so depressed when it was over.  I had no idea what to start to read next; afraid everything would fall short of my heightened reading expectations.  The Uglies intrigued my interest and I have to say this is by far the best series I have ever read! I am in college and I find myself sneaking my kindle in between my text book pages to see what happens next. Great for any age and I just had my mom start the book and she loves it too.  Give this crazy plot a chance and you will find yourself dreaming about what exciting thing occurs next.  Every page is a surprise.

B0058YPG2K|5.0|One of the best tv series ever made hands down. There are not too many other shows i can think of worth buying the whole series on Blu-ray. I hate to see BB ending after the 5th season but it's been a awesome ride. Season 5 starts July 15th 2012.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|So I got this because every one was going crazy over angry birds and it was free so I thought i'd give it a try. I actually thought it was an OK game. It's cute how they tied it in with the movie though since I loved that movie. And there's these pineapples you can try to get to get special achievements or something. So it's different from the original angry birds but it just wasn't my type of game.
B0071T5PN0|5.0|PROS:  The energy level is higher now than it ever was.  One of Eddie's best.  Seems like DLR has some kind of positive effect on the way Eddie plays. Eddie seemed like he turn into a rhythm guitarist during the Hagar years.  Well, Eddie's back to playing riffs throughout the songs instead of rythym.  Can't wait to see them in concert in June!  CONS:  Mike's backup vocals are missing.  Another CON is that I'm addicted to this album and keep listening to it over and over and over and over....  Another Pro:  Wolfgang Van Halen will carry the Van Halen gene pool to it's 3rd generation at least, I'm not sure what Ed and Al's grandparents were doing.  Heck, I just found out they are 1/4 Asian.  How cool is that!
1401223176|1.0|I purchased this book because I like the Jeph Loeb Batman comics. This one, however, was very disappointing.<br />Although Batman is a comic, there is a defined world and this book tossed out all of that. This book seemed to be very child-friendly and very predictable. In his other books, Mr. Loeb didn't immediately reveal the villain and kept you guessing. There were also unnecessary characters including Batgirl, Superman and even a super dog. For some reason, in this book, everyone knew Batman's personal identity. It kind of makes the book boring when everyone knows who the masked super hero is.<br />This book may have had an okay ending, but I will never know. As soon as a damn super dog was introduced, I was done.

B0053KWDES|4.0|I have had headphone amps in the past, but have not been too impressed.  I also am not willing to spend big money on a large table top model.  I just want something to give that needed boost to my iPod.  This has done the job nicely.  I hooked it up to my Audio-Technica ATH-M50 headphones and was pleased with the effect.  I don't need the volume set past 3 with the amp set on Low Power and the Low Gain setting on.  I am also pleasantly surprised with the two EQ settings.  They give a modest bump to the low frequencies and don't muddy up the sound. Setting 1 works better for me than setting 2.  With the EQ off the sound is very pleasing as well.  I am very pleased overall.  The packaging is also very nice and includes a rubber molded band to strap the amp onto your iPod or MP3 player.  Also included are rubber feet to keep the amp from sliding off your desk, a USB charging cord for the battery, and a 3.5mm connecting cord.  I have opted to use the Fiio iPod dock (line out) to 3.5mm connector.  This has worked flawlessly and provides a nice line out level to the amp.  Someday, I might try the 3.5mm cord with my iPod shuffle just for giggles.
B006UG90RM|5.0|When Roth left the band in 1985 I was crushed. My absolute number one band had had it's heart ripped out. I felt betrayed, pissed off, and lost. How could my favorite band be ruined!? I eventually accepted Sammy but it still wasn't Van Halen.  As I listen to each new song, I'm transported back to my teens and I 'm awakened to the fact to how much I miss that time.  I love this album and hate that it took 27 years to become a reality. Van Halen is back and they ROCK AGAIN!
B002KAOSEW|2.0|In one short jump, Lee Child went from one of the best books in his Jack Reacher series, Bad Luck and Trouble, to one of his worst, Nothing to Lose.  I think that listening to it on audiobook made it even worse.  This novel starts out slow and goes nowhere.<br /><br />Nomad and former MP Jack Reacher finds himself in Colorado.  In a small town called Despair, he tries to eat breakfast in the only restaurant in town.  But people in the eatery are acting strange and the waitress refuses to serve him.  Before you know it, Reacher has roughed up four young men who claim they're town deputies.  He's arrested for vagrancy, brought up before a judge, and allowed to leave if he promises never to return.  The police drop him off at the town line between Despair and Hope, where a sympathetic policewoman from Hope, Vaughan, gives him a lift.  Reacher finds out that Despair is a company town and that Mr. Thurman not only owns just about everything, but that he employs most of the town at his metal recycling plant.  He's also a preacher for the town's only church, an end-of-times congregation.  There are an awful lot of secrets in Despair and Reacher just can't keep away.  For instance, why is there a military presence on one side of town?  It takes Reacher forever (including many trips back to Despair) to discover what is really happening.  While he does, he's a one-man wrecking ball--breaking and entering, setting things on fire, beating up people, stealing cars, etc.  In between, Child gives us way too much description.  For instance, Reacher rates every cup of coffee he drinks in this novel, and rates the mugs as well.  One scene that only takes 7 seconds takes reader Dick Hill minutes to describe.  It just got tedious.<br /><br />One other complaint is that the subplot about the mysterious men who traveled to Despair was totally unnecessary and out of place.  It certainly didn't add anything to the story.<br /><br />Nothing to Lose is book number 12 in Lee Child's Jack Reacher series, and overall, the series is excellent.  So I will continue to read, expecting that the next book, Gone Tomorrow, will be much better.eries is excellent.  So I will continue to read, expecting that the next book, Gone Tomorrow, will be much better.
0553801473|3.0|I feel this is the weakest book in the Song of Fire and Ice series so far. Half the time I felt I was slogging through the book. While I found the chapters on Daenerys to be rather interesting, the others were less than satisfying. For anyone who may not already know, the majority of this book happens in parallel to the previous novel, \\"A Feast for Crows\\". Toward the end, some of the characters covered in \\"Crows\\" have their stories continued here. As a result, it felt to me like he touched on a lot of different characters throughout without advancing the story sufficiently.<br /><br />A few characters received the bulk of coverage in this book: Jon, Daenerys, Tyrion, and Theon (at least early on). Somehow, despite the numerous chapters about Jon, I didn't feel much progress was made in his storyline. His interactions with Melisandre felt repetitive. There was very little action and it felt like it took too long for anything with the wildings to progress - it would take a whole chapter to discuss a plan and then a whole chapter to more or less repeat the same thing by having it done. The chapters dealing with Daenerys were my favorites, with much of the action and discussion centering how to achieve peace and what to do about the dragons. Even those chapters took a long time for any real progress in the events. And for all the chapters dedicated to Stannis's assault on Winterfell, he doesn't get very far.<br /><br />At times it feels like Martin has overstretched himself by having too many characters' viewpoints and simultaneous storylines to cover. Having just two chapters for a character - such as Arya, Davos, and Jaime - feels more like a teaser than anything else. Other characters such as Samwell and Sansa are left out completely. Having the wealth of different viewpoints can make the work quite interesting at times, but some storylines end up short-changed. At this point it feels like he'll need not just the planned two more books, but several more to come to areal conclusion and tie up all the loose ends.
1451648537|5.0|I like the perspective of the author with this book. Roughly it was two thirds what Jobs was dealing with at work, and one third away from work. Which is probably about how his life played out for Steve Jobs himself. Furthermore, the work side was heavy on dealing with the important decisions and conflicts of opinion that came into play with those decisions. And I can easily believe that also reflects the substance of how his work was experienced by Jobs himself.  You do get a good look at the distasteful side of Job's personality, not explained away nor condemned by the author. One can form theories about the self-centered side, but it's not the author's task to indulge in theorizing and he stays away from it. It would have been interesting to hear a lot more from Job's wife, but perhaps she didn't want to get involved in the biography. She appears more as an outside person - we read of her qualities but we don't see them in play, nor do we see many specifics of her relationship with Steve.  I learned many things about how the Apple products came about, things I didn't know before. And I found it interesting how easily a person of importance can float around in the world of similarly important people. I hadn't realized that personal contacts were so common and natural in that circle.  Easy, enjoyable and interesting to read, this is a fine book.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Lightweight, attractive, sleek, snaps on snugly, doesn't add bulk, offers protection for my investment (Kindle Fire), the faceplate cover opens easily and folds back out of the way when KF is in use and the elastic strap keeps the faceplate cover closed when KF is not in use.

0446571415|4.0|I haven't read all of the Camel Club books, but I've enjoyed the ones I have read. The latest Oliver Stone story I've read deals with nanobots and arborists. Oliver is invited back inside, to atone for past sins and probably die a hero. Again.<br /><br />Before he can begin his mission he witnesses a terrorist attack on a tree. While trying to get to the root of the issue, Stone is paired with Mary Chapman from MI6. Together thy sort through the clues, and after track their quarry back to the CIA training center where Stone, then John Carr, started his career.  The story is very good, though somewhat predictable in a couple of places. Oliver Stone seemed especially interesting as a character here, I thought it was a very good read.

1592400876|4.0|As a daily user of the popular language, bad English, I find it useful to think of the language every now and then. I may even make mine slightly less bad. What I learned at school is to leave it out when in doubt. After reading the book I know a tiny bit more. Even now, after few years since I read the book, I remember something useful of the English spelling - I allowed you to breath while reading my lenghty sentences.  I picked the book at aiport (yes, it was before Kindles) and read it in one go. Entertaining. Recently, I have recommended it to a colleague and decided to write this review to share my recommendation with the rest of you too.
B0018QCXH8|5.0|Greed, power, and vanity just three of the 7 deadly sins on show in this great American blood and fire epic. The story of ruthless, blackhearted oilman Daniel Plainview is simply stunning to behold.  PT Anderson's vivid, cinematic style that powered 'Boogie Nights' and 'Magnolia' is in bravura form here, supercharged by one of cinema's great Academy Award winning performances by Daniel Day-Lewis.  Robert Elswit's beautiful old school cinematography also deservedly won an Oscar.  Jonny Greenwood's brilliant often discordant score, reminiscent of Kubrick's '2001' and 'The Shining' inexplicably didn't get even nominated.  The whole cast is wonderful, but Day-Lewis is unforgettable.  A classic.
B000001FO4|4.0|Cinderella's 2nd engagement proved to be a more successful album than the slightly harsher Night Songs which produced one decent single in &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot;. This album multiplies the finest elements of Night Songs and alters to a Glam melds Blues style throughout. &quot;Don't Know What You Got (Till It's Gone)&quot; brought Cinderella to second tier status in 1988 and remains one of the most touching ballads of the era. &quot;Coming Home&quot; plays with a fast, successive yet laid back sound, very characteristic of the time. Despite a few musical drawbacks this is a solid effort overall and stands as the album that fully incorporated Cinderella as a distinguished act of the late 80's.

0525478817|5.0|John Green presents to you a novel so incredibly thought out that you'll wonder if you yourself could ever fathom a thought as well as he writes them. Hazel and Augustus are beautifully alive together, even when pushing through death. This book will grip your every essence and torture you with wonderful possibilities, even after it's over. So hopeless, so lovely, so hurtful, and so very daring, A Fault In Our Stars is a magnificent addition to my family of favorite books, to which John Green is no stranger.
1594203334|5.0|After looking over the reviews that were posted today on the first day of release I might as well weigh in.  It is obvious that the other reviewers have not read this book.  I, at least, have read the Wall Street Journal's article on it and it was very, very good.  It appears that many good points are made.  I would have to say that the French do not have a corner on this method of child rearing.  I did order the book based on the sample I read in the WSJ and I hope it is as good.  With that said.  Amazon has my permission to remove this review as soon as they remove the inappropriate reviews from those that posted today and have even less of an idea of what the book says than I do.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Elegant release full of great arrangements and Pauls voice is exactly what one would expect, so give the man some credit, ok? Paul has recorded in just about every genre and very well. Listen closely and you'll hear the passion he has for the songs. I could never sing well at any age so I appreciate what he did. The best songs on the album are the ones written by Paul. It's a mellow and melodic ride, and the music is welcome in these difficult and unpredictable times.

0756404738|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss is not a man of few words.  Thankfully he's pretty good with the words he uses.  This was the sequel that was a long time coming and as such there was a level of hype I'm not sure anyone could ever live up with.  The book wasn't perfect but it was still one of the best I've read in recent memory.  It keeps you curious through to the end and keeps you wanting the 3rd book.  Whenever that might come.

I can't say enough positive things about this app.  Did I mention we love it?
B003VR5PPY|4.0|This game reminds me of some of the detective murder mystery games like J.B. Harold: Murder Club from the late 80s early 90s.  Except you aren't trying to pin a murder on a suspect rather you are gathering clues and solving puzzles to stay alive.  With a varied cast of characters and not too difficult puzzles the game is a nice stress free distraction from more fast paced games of today.  The theme and tone is definitely mature, but nothing more disturbing than you would see on some of the more graphic crime shows on network television.<br /><br />I enjoyed the game and every once in a while I'll pick it up and play a few scenarios just for the heck of it.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|Since I've been reading about Sookie and her doings for so many years, she's started to feel like my kid sister, I wasn't sure if I wanted to ever watch HBO's TrueBlood. I just had the feeling that the television show would never be able to measure up to my own imagination combined with Charlaine Harris's inventive storytelling.<br /><br />But I finally cracked, and I'm so glad I did. As so many other reviewers have noted, the television program differs from the books in many ways, but I've watched Season 1 twice through now, and I really think the series, at least in the first season, works really, really well.<br /><br />Anna Paquin's Sookie is brilliantly played, in my opinion. Right down to the gap in her teeth, she is a vulnerable girl in the process of becoming a steel magnolia. Watching her persevere through the hardship her \\"disability\\" causes is a moving experience, and exactly why the Sookie-of-the-books is so loveable.<br /><br />Many of the other characters in the cast don't disappoint either. Stephen Moyer (who says \\"SOOkehhhhhhh\\" in a way that absolutely lights my own blood on fire, baby)is a wonderful Bill; Sam's character isn't as he's described by Charlaine Harris, but hey, Sam Trammell, I am NOT complaining. Ryan Kwanten's Jason Stackhouse is so dead-on, I keep feeling like I'm going to run into him at the local Wal-Mart. And Lafayette, whose role in the books was pretty slight (ending up with his death) has completely stolen my heart. Tara, another character whose role in the novels was strongly reprised for the series, adds another storyline, but I'm not completely certain if it's one I'm going to be interested in for too long. Tara already tends to be, as Sookie would say, \\"a Weeping Willa.\\" That can get very boring, watching a character make the same mistakes and therefore go through the same troubles over and over again. I LOVE Carrie Preston's Arlene.<br /><br />And then there's Alexander Skarsgard's Eric, who is just the edgiest, freakiest, yummiest Eric EVER. I wish Pam's character was closer in looks to Charlaine's description, but Kristin Bauer does the character so well, I can't bring myself to quarrel over such a minor point.<br /><br />All in all, the characters were pleasing, the story lines were interesting and although there were so many parts that were completely different from the books, the series True Blood is amazing fun to watch, a true guilty pleasure.er was closer in looks to Charlaine's description, but Kristin Bauer does the character so well, I can't bring myself to quarrel over such a minor point.

B006UG90RM|4.0|If science is, as Einstein once observed, 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration, so is rock and roll -- and this album is 99%. The problem -- as we witnessed over the years once the original Van Halen lineup went t*ts up -- is that being a technically sound, capable band isn't the same as having that swinging d*ck mentality that Van Halen so perfectly effused on their first six albums behind David Lee Roth. The band went from having a razor's edge to being something far more akin to Disney fare than danger. When the Sammy-led Van Halen imploded, and Dave eventually returned, it was -- and is -- great news for those of us real Van Halen fans. However, while the band still sounds solid and remains -- even vocally -- as sharp as ever -- the light behind the first six albums has to a large degree gone dim.  Don't make any mistake -- for those not paying close attention, this is Real Bona Fide Van Halen. But for those of us hoping the swagger would return along with the element of danger and parental fears -- \\"have you seen junior's grades?\\" -- this isn't it. It's not bad, but it belongs in the second class Van Halen bin, not alongside the first six albums.  Many people will respond by suggesting that after 25 years apart, the brothers Van Halen and DLR have grown into actual adults and are making adult rock. Perhaps this is the album they might have made regardless of the split between 1984 and today's release. And that may be true -- however, given the hiatus, the anticipation, and the fact that many Van Halen fans are hoping for that swagger and attitude that made Van Halen a brand name -- an icon -- would be back. While it is to a certain degree, this album isn't confirmation of that. It's a good first step, I suppose, and it's not awful -- but for those that were hoping for the true follow-up to 1984, this isn't quite that for which we were hoping.  Some standouts are She's The Woman (a re-do from the original 80's Van Halen era), You And Your Blues, Blood and Fire, As Is (sounds like vintage Van Halen), Outta Space, Stay Frosty (perhaps a modern nod to Ice Cream Man) and Beats Workin'.  This will sell and a lot of people will be happy -- but for those genuine Van Halen fans, let's hope this is a warm-up for something really worth waiting for. If and when that happens, this was a good step in the right direction. If this is Van Halen's Swan Song, be glad the original WB releases are available in 20-bit HDCD, fire up the headphones and turn up your radios ;-)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so fun and good for all ages.  It takes a lot of skill and concentration though.  you also need to be willing to play the games over aginthough.
B006UG90RM|4.0|Truth be told, my expectations for this album were extremely low. The product of a dysfunctional family, a lead singer who only occasionally can get along with the lead guitarist, who himself has a history of problems with sobriety and sanity, and the product of huge money being dangled for tours, merchandise, and, oh yeah, music sales.<br /><br />Really, there was no reason to expect this to be much more than a house of cards propped up by song doctors, or else substance-free noodling fashioned into songs by a skilled producer earning every penny he was paid.<br /><br />So color my cynical self very surprised to discover that this, in fact, is a very solid hard rock record. It sounds like a band. The tracks are mostly catchy, in the way that classic era Van Halen tracks were catchy (OK hooks, thrilling guitar fills, salacious David Lee Roth delivery). Is this the return of classic era Van Halen? No, let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's not quite a match to the hungry and young band of yore. There is a nagging feeling that some of this was cobbled together, and this isn't defining in any way.<br /><br />But it's miles better than anyone had a right to expect, and it's a very solid record, in a certain journeyman sort of way.<br /><br />If you loved VH back in the day, you're going to like this. And if you hated them then, this isn't going to change your mind--and it doesn't (thankfully) try. That's about as much as you could ask.

My questions involved the characters.  Though not old Nick. I was interested in Grandpa and Steppa and the Grandmother. But, here are the questions I wish the author would answer.  Why did Ma attempt the suicide? (Inciting incident). Where did this story take place? For me the clues were Grandpa went to Australia and Ma wanted to throw the rug in the incinerator.  I haven't seen an incinerator since 1950. What will happen to Jack and Ma?  Diane Schochet Author of Cog Stone Dreams  [[ASIN:B006S9MQ2C Cog Stone Dreams]]
B003ZSJ212|3.0|I have strong recollections of the release of (what was then) the first Star Wars movie, back in the '70's. As a wee lad, the build up was almost unbearable and the film itself was an eye-popping revelation. There had been almost nothing like it; [[ASIN:B0013K1190 2001 - A Space Odyssey]], I suppose, supplied a similar sensory overload but somehow it didn't have *quite* the impact that SW did. For some reason though, I never saw any of the sequels/prequels and I don't believe I even saw \\"A New Hope\\" much more than a couple of times since its debut. I feel that I can come to the series, therefore, with rather fresher eyes than many of the other reviewers and, I'm afraid, it turns out to be a bit of a disappointment.<br /><br />To get a couple of things straight; I enjoy sci-fi films, action films and all that good stuff - so there's no reason why I shouldn't like SW. Secondly, I have little or no interest in the audio or visual quality of the film or the quality of the Blu Ray transfer or any technical hocus pocus such as that. I expect a product of this price to be of reasonable quality and, as far as I can tell it is (I note with some annoyance that the audio drops out on a New Hope if you select subtitles and then stop and resume playback).<br /><br />The good points? These are six absolutely sumptuous looking films. Say what you like, but watching them is the visual equivalent of a Pan-Galactic Gargleblaster. The look of the Star Wars universe is gorgeously realised and very busily populated - talk about a cast of millions! The environment is rich, exciting and great fun. If Lucas took the opportunity to pep up the earlier films with the benefit of the latest CGI technology? Well, more power to his elbow - he certainly committed worse crimes.<br /><br />And so to those crimes. The acting sucks. It sucks big time and all the way through. Mark Hamill can't act for toffees and should have been strangled at birth. I laughed out loud when, on discovering that his aunt and uncle had been murdered, he did a classic Joey Tribbiani \\"smell the fart\\" look. Hayden Christensen is deeply annoying and deserves a good spanking. I can't understand why he or Lucas thought that a sulky little b!tch of a teenager would be a reasonable precursor to the most feared and hated force for evil in the universe. Ewen McGregor seemed to think that impersonating Alec Guinness was a acceptable substitute for acting and the best I can say about Harrison Ford is \\"he got better\\". Carrie Fisher is fine - I could watch her all day (admttedly not just for her acting). Natalie Portman looked, early in Phantom Menace as if she would be the only reason to keep watching, as the enigmatic, strange and aloof Queen of Naboo. Sadly, it eventually becomes clear that her only task in three films is to give Anakin something ELSE to sulk about and then give birth to Luke and Leia. As a result she just gets boring and ordinary and I couldn't help but think of her as an opportunity lost.<br /><br />Then there's Jar Jar Binks.<br /><br />I'm sorry if you've heard this one before, but there's no getting away from the fact that, unless you're about 5 years old, the entire Phantom Menace is virtually unwatchable thanks to Jar Jar. I had heard that there was an \\"issue\\" with this character but I had no idea. No really, none. I suppose that this is no different than the Ewoks who are almost as hateful (I was rooting for the Empire by the time I'd got to RotJ) and just as obviously playing to the cuddly toy and school lunchbox franchise, but at least they don't infect the whole of RotJ.<br /><br />Plot holes there are plenty of (I'm doing my Yoda impression, here). As if Lucas spent all of his energy on the visuals and a scriptwriter (and acting coach) he could not afford it is (/Yoda).  Overall, it's a fine enough bit of popular/populist story telling - as simple and naive as any Western, war movie or love story.  It's supported by the ground breaking visuals and is quite adequateto keep any 12 year old happy/entertained/excited/engaged. But you could fly an Imperial Galactic Starcruiser through the plot holes. By themselves these inconsistencies would be tolerable in the light of the spectacle of it all, but if you add in the acting (and Jar Jar-isms) the whole six-film series turns out to be a bit of a let down. No - a mystery - I cannot understand why the films attract such a devoted following. If you want an epic scifi series with a broad, majestic vision, try [[ASIN:B001DF681G Lexx]]. OK it's tacky, silly and cheap as chips but it has a sense of humour that the Star Wars series lacks and if you compare their respective budgets, I can assure you which one delivers value for money.<br /><br />I give this two stars and one more for old time's sake, but if, like me, you're an adult and are coming to this with little in the way of Star Wars experience, you could well be disappointed.<br /><br />\\"Luke!

B004SJ3BCI|4.0|A game to show your anger to green limbless pigs with super powered limbless birds. Hmm, interesting. Well, I can honestly say that this game is amazing, but quite frankly it isn't. At this point I will assume that all of you reading this, however few there are, know what this game is about and how popular it is. This game does a lot of things right with large amounts of levels, different superpowered birds, different mutant pigs that somehow can grow facial hair, but the biggest disappointment is its repetivity. Many stages feel like you've played them before, but with one different block and a different background. Along with that, the levels are sure to aggravate you with having to hit a specific block that is always just out of range to actually beat the level. Also, an aggravation I suppose is the rating system. After you've hit that one specific block with one bird and destroyed the pig's entire fortress down to the last pane of glass, you still end up with one star. A bit of explanation of the amount of points to pass a level wouldn't hurt. But overall, a fun game that will render you with dozens of hours playing this while spending half the time yelling, glaring hatefully, or even shaking your mobile device just to knock down one block.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I have been waiting for this collection to be released for ages, and I was thrilled to find it here. The quality of the discs is top notch, none of them skip, they were in perfect condition upon arrival, and they were delivered very promptly. Great value and highly recommended for any Harry Potter fan!
B005HSL626|3.0|This game, like many games on the app department is unique in its own way. Its a simple game where you cut up fruit in various gameplays to overall, reach a highscore. Alert, high score? I thought highscores stayed in arcade games for a reason. They do, because no one wants to play a game to beat a highscore that you set a month ago on a lonely Saturday night. It has good gameplay, and its fun to play on your friend's phone to beat their highscore, but constantly going after your own gets boring after a couple dozen tries. The only real reason to get this is to attempt to get all the unlockables so you can go brag to your friends about how &quot;talented&quot; you are. My advice, stick to taking your friends phone to play this game so you don't lose all the appreciation you have for this game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best Bible app! There is nothing about this Bible app I dislike. I love the daily Bible plans u can chose from, it has every Bible version u can think of and u can download most any of the versions onto your kindle fire so u can read it when your not in a wi-fi area. There's also a place were u can write notes when u feel God ministering to u. I also like the audio versions, so u can listen to the Bible in the car or while your cooking dinner.  Great app!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|At first it seems kinda slow but once you get past a few levels it gets addicting. The kids love it - fun and easy.
0062082353|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It was fast-moving and factual.  It was interesting to learn about the Navy Seals and sniper training.  I didn't realize how big a part the Navy Seals played in the Iraqi war and in Afghanistan.
0385535139|5.0|I hadn't read a Grisham novel in years (since the early days and before he went all mass publication) and I have to say I really enjoyed this one.  The characters were lively and likeable and it held my interest all the way through.  Makes me want to read more Grisham.
0792163710|3.0|$28!!! Come on. I liked it and all, but come on. That's beyond ludicrous. Just on price alone I'd recommend not to buy it. Just wait for it on one of the cable movie channels or get it on Netflix.
B0050Z5MI0|5.0|If you haven't seen Pinocchio on Blu-ray, then you haven't seen it.  I've compared the Blu-ray high definition restoration with the regular DVD version and there is really no comparison. The depth of color and detail in the Blu-ray version on a high definition television is LIKE WATCHING IT IN THE THEATER. You really appreciate the DETAIL, COLORS, and MAGIC the Disney animators were able to create, decades before digital technology was even available.  This Blu-ray version of Pinocchio is in a \\"DVD package\\" meaning, it is in the black case that most DVDs come in, BUT IT CONTAINS THE SAME 3 DISKS as the \\"Blu-ray Packaging\\" version!  It includes...  Disk 1: BLU RAY VERSION of Pinocchio!  Disk 2: BLU RAY \\"BONUS FEATURES\\" (including \\"No Strings Attached: The Making of Pinocchio\\" documentary in HIGH DEFINITION!  Disk 3: regular \\"DVD\\" version of Pinocchio (which makes a good back-up, or one the kids can use while you store the more valuable Blu-ray version in a safer place.  Enjoy!
B002HML756|5.0|This was a great movie and since I live in Arizona and based upon a true story it was especially interesting.  It gives the story based on the man who says he was taken aboard a spaceship and also how it effected his friends who were thought to have possibley killed him before he returned.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Delivery was exactly as stated.  This cd was a Christmas present for my daughter.  She really enjoys Kelly's music and loves her cds.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible app is far and above others that we've seen. Thanks for keeping us in the word. It is very comforting.
B003FIUTA0|1.0|I cannot review this correctly.  When we opened the \\"New\\" dvd case, that was wrapped like a new movie.  \\"Garfield\\" the movie was in its place.  Very dissapointed because this was a gift.  The place that I purchased it from \\"did not\\" have any more in stock.  They said they would refund the money, but I will have to wait until my next month statement to make 100 percent sure they did.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|This sleeve was exactly what I wanted. It has a nice, snug fit with the Kindle Fire. I love the handle, and like that only 2 out of 4 sides open with the zipper. I wasn't aware that the inside of the Graphite sleeve is lime green, but it doesn't bother me at all. I feel like my Kindle Fire is protected and secure. I like that the sleeve isn't too bulky, and it fits in my purse perfectly. I didn't notice any chemical smell, like others have noted.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I just received this item and I already love it.  I had another bluetooth speaker for the car, and the sound was horrible.  I do a lot of rural driving with roads that aren't that great, so there is always a lot of road noise.  This product seems to be my solution.  I will update my review, if needed, after I have used the product a little longer.  So far, so good.  It paired easily with my Pantech phone also.

B006UG90RM|3.0|When I first heard Van Halen was recording a new album I was really excited to hear if Eddie A) still had it and B) could he actually do something to put those who believes John 'teenie bopper' Mayer is a great guitarist in their place... In those two regards I'm satisfied.  Eddies playing is a distorted chaotic-boarding on sloppy- mess, at times, mainly on the rhythm tracks. But there are occasions, most of the solo's, when you have to scream THATS EDDIE ^%$#*&^ Van Halen... A lot of times I caught myself saying it weren't for his trademark harmonics and hammer on's/off's most wouldn't even believe this was Eddie Van Halen. Honestly, there are a few moments of pure genius and other of \\"huh?\\" But thats typical for a Van Halen album.  Well, I suppose I should mention the rest of the band.  Roth is his typical \\"Look at me, look at me\\" nonsensical self. Luckily I couldn't understand half the lyrics he was, umm, singing? The mix on this album is really distorted, almost as if it was already recorded and someone ran it through a EQ using the \\"grunge\\" setting... Really amateurish, and not in a good way.  Alex is his usual self. Which is AWESOME. Alex is still to this day one of the most under-ratted drummers in music. But that muffled mix really affected his sound.  I do have to say, I rolled my eyes with his intro to \\"As Is..\\"  It ain't 1984, brother!  Wolfgang - Except for a solo on \\"Beats Workin'\\" he's adequate. OBTW I'm willing to bet money that it's really Eddie playing that solo... Just saying.  Eddie Van Halen played bass on most of III and all three of the new tracks on \\"The Best Of Both Worlds...\\" He should've continued that trend.  To say Michael Anthony is missed can not be understated. Mikey had a distinctive style and my God the best backing vocal in the history of rock.  I read a comment on the video for \\"Tattoo\\" that Van Halen has a history of not releasing the strongest song as the lead single. Now since the only Van Halen album I actually remember being released was  III and the lead single off that album in fact wasn't the strongest track on the album I allowed myself the hope that the album would be great... It's good just not great. But I don't know about anyone else but I'll take a good Vann Halen album over a 14 year wait over just about anything.  Now a lot of the songs are rehashed versions of songs that Warner Bro's or Ted Templeman deemed to weak to be on \\"Van Halen\\" through \\"Diver Down.\\" So it really does boggle the mind as to why they would chose to record an album full of rejects as their so called triumphant return...  I heard a rumor that the brothers and Roth were arguing a lot over material. That could be why they went back to the old songs. I am being honest when I say the majority of the weak/ flat out bad songs are the old demo's.  Dear Van Halen - leave well enough alone.  1.Tattoo  Song - 2/5  Riff - 3/5  Solo - 3/5  It's a hard driving song about Tattoos with nonsensical lyrics. It's based on an original demo from \\"Van Halen\\" called \\"Down in Flames.\\" This song, by far has the best production of any other song on the album.  2. She's the Woman  Song 1/5  Riff - 2/5  Solo - 3/5  It's a hard driving song about a women with nonsensical lyrics. Another song based on an original demo. Side note: I guess Eddie's feeling were hurt over all the backlash of him having a signature Wah pedal when he only used a wah on one song. Well, now there are two.  3. You and Your Blues  Song - 1/5  Riff - 4/5  Solo - 1/5  It's a medium driven song about, heck if I know, with nonsensical lyrics. The \\"airy\\" riff is the only good thing about this song.  4. China Town  Song 3/5  Riff 5/5  Solo - 5/5 Thank You Jebus!  It's a balls to the wall hard driven rock song about China town with nonsensical lyrics.  There are now three Van Halen songs featuring a Wah Wah pedal.  5. Blood and Fire  Song - 1/5  Riff - 3/5  Solo - 5-5 Oh, be still my beating heart.  A ballad with nonsensical lyrics. Pretty sure this was a reject fromRoth's \\"Eat 'Em and Smile\\" solo album. I'm sorry Eddie but that is a Vai riff and solo, and thats obvious.  6 Bullethead  Song - 0/5  Riff - 0/5  Solo - 1/5, I'm being generous.  It's a hard driving song about a bullethead, I guess, with nonsensical lyrics. Clearly a reject from VH I or II and not a good one.  7. As Is  Song - 4/5  Riff - 4/5 even though it's been done to death by  Nuno, Vai the dude from Steel Panther, etc.  Solo - 4/5 but it's just not Eddie's style.  A balls to the wall hard driving rock song with, uhh screw the lyrics!  8. Honeybabysweetiedoll  Song - 1/5  Riff - 1/5  Solo 5-5 Just because he uses the sustainer so darn defectively.  A hard driven DARK song with, yeah you know about the lyrics.  Okay there is a lot going on in this song, to bad it's not in a good way.  He sure is using that \\"D-Tuna\\" to full effect on this track and there are now 4 Van Halen songs featuring a wah wah pedal.  A special note to Eddie - the scartching the pick above the nut thingy was kinda cool in 1995 but not in 2012.  9. The Trouble with Never  Song - 3/5  Riff - 3-5  Solo - 5-5 The best solo on the album.  A medium-hard driven rock song with um, Roth wrote the lyrics. The hook is catchy, though... There I said something nice about Roth  10. Outta Space  Song - 4/5  Riff - 5/5  Solo 5/5  A really fact paced hard driven rock song with, are you kidding me with these lyrics? I mean is he even trying? seriously you would think Eddie, Al the producer, someone at the record label, the dude cleaning the studio, anyone? Would simply ask Dave - Um, WHAT?  11. Stay Frosty  Song 5/5  Riff(s) 5/5  Solo 5/5  A bluesy-hard rocking - it's \\"Ice Cream Man\\" part two, folks... Simple as that!  12. Big River  Song 4/5  Riff 4/5  Solo 5/5  Medium driven rock song that after checking my official \\"Roth to English\\" translator is in fact about a river. This is probablt the most well put together song on the album, in fact it would be  right at home on \\"For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge.\\"  13.Beats Workin  Song - 3/5  Riff - 3/5  Solo(s)(Both Eddie) 5-5  Medium driven rock song with words in it.  There are now officially a flabbergasting 5 Van Halen songs with a wah wah pedal... Look out Slash!  Over all the album is a strong 3 to soft 4 out of five stars. I just can't help but imagine how good this would've been with a proper singer/lyricist. That is not to say that Roth doesn't have his moments I'm just saying the genius that is Eddie needs someone who can write a better lyric then \\"show me your dragon magic.\\"  Could've, Should've Been A lot Better.
B006H3MIV8|2.0|What a mess.  A combination of old guys who can't get it up any more (Joe Perry, Paul Rogers, Eric Burdon, etc.) and young guys who perform the songs like they have no idea who Dylan is or why he is important (Flogging Molly, My Chemical Romance, Cage the Elephant, etc.).  The exception is Sinead O'Connor absolutely knocking it out of the park with \\"Property of Jesus\\"; a version that can actually stand up to Dylan's version.  I could squeeze one listenable CD out of this four CD mess if I had to.

B004VWH3KI|5.0|Received the book on time and as promised.  The story was not what I expected and lacked any sense of reality.  After reading it I don't understand how this ever became a classic.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wish there was an offline version. the app itself is great..easy to use and love the audio version. Also I use the Joyce Meyer daily plan..it fits perfectly.

B006UG90RM|5.0|28 years later... it really is Classic Van Halen !  1 Tattoo  2 She's the Woman  3 You and Your Blues  4 China Town  5 Blood and Fire  6 Bullethead  7 As Is  8 Honeybabysweetiedoll  9 The Trouble With Never  10 Outta Space  11 Stay Frosty  12 Big River  13 Beats Workin'  This album is a worthy successor to VH's string of classic albums, from the first album of 1978 to \\"1984\\", the last album with David Lee Roth.  A good way to describe it is to start with what it is not: There are no cover songs, no sappy ballads, nor are there guitar solo showpieces. Even Eddie Van Halen himself could never top his own \\"Eruption\\" from the first album. As for what you do get:  Solid songs, some of them old, some new. Brothers Ed and Al play as well as they always have, although sometimes the guitar sound is a little more \\"processed\\" than on the early albums. But they deliver the goods. Wolfie has a different style and sound on the bass than Michael Anthony, but sometimes that works well but many times  you really miss Mike's Beach-Boys-on-steroids backing vocals. Instead we have some creepy, low vocals underneath.  Much of the album will sound familiar to long time fans. \\"She's the Woman\\" is largely intact from the Gene Simmons Demos, except that the middle section which later became part of \\"Mean Street\\" has been updated with a new section.  \\"Bullethead\\"'s rhythm reminds me of \\"Light up the Sky\\"  but it's not the same song. Outta Space (NOT the Billy Preston song) sounds familiar too, I think I heard it on a pre-1978 bootleg somewhere.  \\"Stay Frosty\\" has some of the vibe of \\"Ice Cream Man.\\"  But the real treat is \\"Big River\\", which was called \\"Big Trouble\\" on the Gene Simmons Demos.  It has different lyrics and a ripping solo.  It's been too long since we heard Dave, Eddie, and Alex make any new music together. But with this record, they deliver the goods - a Van Halen album with the same feel as the first six.  I'm looking forward to seeing them on tour this summer.
B006UG90RM|5.0|ALL of these songs are NOT older 75-77 songs.  SOME of them are BUT, not all.  It seems fitting that they use some of the OLD songs...since, it is like a NEW beginning.  It doesn't mean they are \\"Lazy\\".  Don't judge so quick...there will be another album!  And, for all of those who are on the M. Anthony kick.  Get off.  Wolfgang is an awesome bass player...especially for his age.  Listen to the Bass track in \\"Big River\\"!  He will ONLY get better.  His vocals are FINE.  M. Anthony was not the BAND of Van Halen.  His vocals were...BACKUP harmonies.  I thing DLR is a great front man.  He has the 'tude!  It obviously isn't easy to work with a \\"family\\" band.  Judging by the exit of DLR, Gary, Sammy and Michael.  Now, David is back...David was with them for the start...and now until the end.  Which time has not run out on them yet.  Wolfgang is going to keep them \\"young\\" for a while.

0439023491|5.0|Have you ever felt that the whole world was against you but you need to stay tough to conquer challenges and emerge victorious? Katniss is a courageous young girl who is willing to sacrifice her own safety to protect family and friends. Catching Fire is a brilliant book and full of suspense. This book should be rated 4.5/5 because of its marvelous plot, the author's detailed writing style, and the characterization she adds to the survival story. This book is based in future America. Katniss has won the Hunger Games. They are similar to the gladiator battles in the Roman times. Her family and friends are happy but hold a sad tale. Katniss and her friend Peeta have started a rebellion from their actions in the games.<br /><br />The plot is violent with twists and turns around every chapter of the book. Katniss is trying to save her dearest friends and family from the threat of President Snow striking down on her for the unrest she has made in the districts. The thought of President Snow's next action makes me keep on reading and excited. The author has put a lot of cliff hangers in the book and I like it because she doesn't put it in the end of the book. She puts it in most of the end of every chapter. Another thing I like about her writing is that the book is so unpredictable. I never knew what was going to happen next.<br /><br />The author puts so much detail in her writing. For example, when she was fighting in the games I could imagine the amount of stress she had to keep her fellow fighter Peeta alive. It also put an image in my head of the torture the authorities put in the games to the poor contestants. The author also makes the book intense (during the games) which adds to the thrill of the book or make you feel what will happen next, for example in the second game the map of the arena was a clock. Every hour there were monsters or tsunamis in each area of the clock. For example, in the twelve hour mark, there would be birds that mocked a scream from someone you love. This made Katniss go mad. I wished she made more books in her series. The only thing I would change is the length of the games, because I think they are too short, but less torture. I want them a little bit longer because without the games the whole book would not have been thrilling, it would be more focused on how Katniss was a poor girl in her impoverished area of city.<br /><br />I loved how the author used detailed characterization. To me characterization means a lot in the book, without it the book would be boring and every character would be the same. It is just like in the world, everybody is different. (As the rebellion grew, Katniss was afraid the President was going to kill her family). I find her as a strong person but she prevents herself from acting strong, she just wants to stick out for her family and friends. I say this because in the book she wants to fight back but is afraid that Peeta's family, her friend Gilan's family, and her own family would die. Same with Peeta, as she wanted to run away too. If I was in their situation, I would try to talk to some of the neighboring districts about what is happening and come up with a plan to defeat President Snow.<br /><br />This book is only the second book of the three books in the series. Katniss a.k.a \\"the girl on fire\\", made the book on fire. I can't wait till I get my hands on the third book. I heard that the book describes Katniss and Peeta in District 13 (the dead district). I am surprised that there are only three books in the series. Her books are not a waste of your time and they are one of my favorite books. If you like cliff hangers and epic survival books you will like the series. I would not recommend this to readers who don't like science fiction because it is mainly based in the future. Although the series are short compared to others, it is the best series I have ever read. I love the author and the amazing books she writes.you love. This made Katniss go mad.

B006OAB3ME|5.0|Yes - this is not the latest rock record from Mac (that's suppose to be his next release - which I am sure will ROCK!).  It is what it's suppose to be: Paul delivering songs his Dad enjoyed (mostly from the 1930s to 1950s) and songs Paul grew up listening to.  If you are not a fan of this type of jazzy-pop - well this CD is not for you.  This is a stroll down the \\"American Songbook\\" of oldies perfect for quieter and more intimate/reflective moments.  At 69 Paul is in good voice (must be the constant touring) and he delivers an enjoyable assortment of songs.  I especially like:  I'm Gonna Sit Right Down...\\"  My Valentine (one of two Paul originals),  and  My One and Only Love.  It's my understanding Diana Krall helped out a lot on this music with her piano playing and her band. This was a wise choice by Paul as these songs seem a perfect fit for him (and her) and elevates the overall cohesiveness of the entire set.  In the end, this also seems like a romantic letter of love to Paul's new wife and fortunately we get to listen in (and enjoy) the romance-----@  Kudos to Paul-

0920668364|5.0|This is a very moving little book.  A great read for children of any age, including adult \\"children\\".  It will touch your heart!
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|this game is fun but it keeps shutting down when I get half way through. it worked good for a few days on my kindle fire but now it doesn't. please fix because if it were not for this problem I would give 5 stars.
B006UG90RM|5.0|First off, I really don't care about the \\"these are outtakes and demos that Eddie tweaked\\" so-called \\"controversy.\\" I'm of the camp that believes that EVERY band does this. The album SOUNDS great. What more could you possibly want?  Second, this is the heaviest album the band has recorded since Eddie became enamored with synths and other keyboards. This isn't a Van Hagar-era \\"that's what dreams are made of\\" or \\"some kinda alien pulls the string and love comes walking in\\" trip down memory lane. The center of THIS sweet isn't soft or creamy, it's CHEWY. The band has something to prove, and they are lean and mean. If the first album ([[ASIN:B00004Y6O9 Van Halen]]) made you a believer, get ready to believe again.  Roth, especially, is practically feral on this one. Eddie once made a comment, near the beginning of Sammy's tenure in the band, that they'd grown weary of \\"ripping the kids off with a clown show.\\" And Roth's last album...a strange mix of cover versions, [[ASIN:B00009LVY2 Diamond Dave]]...didn't exactly bode well for his future. He's roaring on this one.  I'm still not thrilled that the band squeezed out Michael Anthony, but it is what it is. His vocals are missed more than his bass playing, but somehow the right knobs got twiddled in the studio and the trademark harmony vocals, for the most part, have been reconstructed.  The album...clocking in at 50 minutes...is MUCH more generous than, say [[ASIN:B00004Y6O6 Diver Down]]. I still don't like \\"Tattoo\\"...I thought it was a weak song when it was first released, and I think it's a weak song not. \\"The Trouble With Never\\" sounds like a mash-up between one of the goofball tracks from Dave's first solo album [[ASIN:B004X0XXFC Eat 'em And Smile]] and \\"Panama.\\" You are not going to hear anything really \\"new\\" or \\"trailblazing\\" here...just Roth being Roth and Eddie being Eddie. And in all honesty, isn't that what most of us were hoping for?  It's especially nice, after Eddie's various health problems (self-inflicted orotherwise), he's clean, sober, and can still play rings around any guitarist who decided he wanted to \\"be like Eddie\\" back in the day. There's no shortage of guitar, no shortage of Eddie just RIPPING on one lead after another.  28 years between albums with Roth, and the major difference...as noted above...is that this is a return to the harder-edged sound of the band, with keyboards / synths wither absent or pushed back in the mix.  Whether any of these songs make it onto the band's 2012 concert set list doesn't matter. The Roth era of Van Halen always felt like unfinished business. I'm a fan of Sammy Hagar dating back to his Montrose days, but didn't really care for much of the pop / \\"album-oriented radio\\" / \\"power ballad\\" material he churned out in his Van Halen days. Roth is back in Van Halen, Sammy and Michael are in Chickenfoot...in my view, everybody wins.  I bought the CD and made a mix CD for the car, minus \\"Tattoo.\\" If I loaded the commercial CD into my deck, I'd probably skip \\"Tattoo\\" every time anyway. What I ended up with was 45 minutes of brutal, prime Van Halen, with many nods to the past. Does this band have \\"legs?\\" Will there be another Roth studio album after this one? With Van Halen, you never know. The last Hagar studio album...[[ASIN:B002CORN4S Balance]]...came in 1995. The regrettable Gary Cherone album, followed in 1998. From that point, it was \\"the sound of silence\\" from the band, unless you count the 3 \\"new\\" Hagar tracks on [[ASIN:B00122BEPA The Best Of Both Worlds (US Release)]].  All that matters, in 2012, is that they have a solid new album that is faithful to their fans and faithful to their roots, and they'er going on tour. What happens beyond that...like everything else in their decades-spanning career...is anybody's guess.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love this app! I wish i could get another amazon card soon so i can update it! I highly recommend this app for anyone.:)
0553801473|1.0|Gypped and hoodwinked again!  After the first three imaginative, action-packed volumes, the last two have been pathetically painful. I was hoping Martin had taken some advice from his fans after the disaster that was A Feast for Crows.  Apparently not.  Obviously, Martin is going for the \\"stretching out the series with filler trash a la Robert Jordan show-me-the-money\\" angle, and abandoning all pretense of imagination, decent writing and character development. Why do these series have to go on and on if there's nothing worth reading? Amping up the soft porn and vulgar language is the only nod to \\"action\\" anywhere in this book, maybe a boon to all the lonely nerds camped out in their parents' basements, but not to me.<br />Too many characters discussing nothing, endless repetition of themes (yes, we know Daenerys is unsure, young, and horny.  WHERE ARE THE DRAGONS???  Yes, we know Theron has broken teeth and missing fingers and Ramsay is a sadistic monster.  WHEN IS THE REVENGE??? Yes, we know Jon Snow is young, unsure and being challenged at every turn.  WHEN DOES HE TAKE CHARGE??? Lord Manderly is slovenly, the Lannisters are cruel, Tyrion is the misunderstood Imp, etc, etc) It takes 500+ pages for anything to happen, and it didn't tie up all the unraveling threads of endless characters no one cares about. Creating new characters is no substitute for a good story.<br />Boring boring boring.  A shameful sputtering end to a promising beginning.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|This is perhaps my favorite adaption of one of my favorite stories. In a perfect world this version would have been longer and more elements of the book would have been incorporated into the movie (such as Bertha tearing Jane's veil), but considering the time restraint of a movie like this I believe this adaption has captured much of the eeriness and passion that others fail to. Fassbender is my favorite Mr. Rochester by far. He portrays him with such an intellectual intensity, just as he is in the book. I highly recommend this adaption to anyone who doesn't expect a movie to capture Charlotte Bronte's masterwork verbatim, but that is able to communicate the sense and emotion of the story in a limited amount of time.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|Terrible. That's the only word I can use to describe this movie. Nobody in my family, not even the younger kids liked it. The music and dancing were also a bit suggestive and I wish this had never been made. And they call this a kids movie.
B004J4RQIM|5.0|While this \\"Hit Man\\" may not have the total star power of the first installment, it nevertheless lacks nothing!  The performances in this venue are nothing short of very, very special.  So, put the DVD in, sit back in your prime viewing location, put your feet up, and sit back and just enjoy the entertainment.
B005QUQRE2|4.0|This movie leaves multiple impressions - the first of which is that the actual situation, the second Earth, lacks utterly in plausibility. So do fairy tales, but I enjoy them anyway.<br /><br />Another part of the mix comes from the creepier side of stalking, driven by a muddled emotional mix fueled by some need so deep within her that Rhoda has no hope of identifying it, and no real urge to. In other words, an emotional mish-mosh that pretty much anyone can recognize, if they've ever looked within themselves at any length.<br /><br />The visual layer, though, conveys a quite beauty. Rhoda herself could be very beautiful, if she weren't so desperate not to be. The other Earth has an unearthly beauty, one informed by decades of images from space. It also has a presence that keeps intruding quietly, at every turn. I've gotten a similar feeling near Seattle, where Mt. Rainier seems to loom around every corner.<br /><br />Then, the ending raises more questions than it answers. Years of personal history led up to the period of this movie, and lifetimes continue after this interlude ends - as is true in life, too. \\"Another Earth\\" defies easy description, but don't most things worth any attention?<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters

B0059XTTW8|1.0|I looked forward to this film although as a fan of the novel and the original miniseries, I was prepared for some adaptations as this story was brought into the cinematic format. Even with those (rather low) expectations I was still hugely disappointed. The acting was first rate and the overall design of the film in terms of mood and historical feel was enticing. Unfortunately the scrip rendered the heart of the story meaningless, both in terms of plot and in terms of the point of the story. Tinker, Taylor, Soldier, Spy in it's original version is much more than a \\"who done it\\" spy tale, it's a story about ideology and identity during the Cold War and way in which love and loyalty get corrupted in the face of politics and organizational corruption. The screenplay of this film fails to address these themes in any meaningful way, which is too bad given how superb the performances are by the actors and the production team. By the time the film ends, when the traitor is revealed, so little has been done to distinguish him from the other suspects that I felt I might as well have been watching a game of Clue and the thinly-wrought characters merely so many paper cards. My advice is to read the book and then watch the Alec Guiness mini-series.

My only gripe is that I wish he had sung these songs in his normal singing voice and not as high as he has done on the majority of tracks. I have rated the album a 3 when comparing it to some of his other solo albums. Glad to have this cd in my collection and it will get played from time to time but not as often as some.

0525422943|5.0|If I Stay was amazing. If I let myself, I could go on and on about that book, but I've already written that review, so I'm going to limit myself to one adjective. If I Stay is one of those books with characters that seriously move you and become real to you. You hurt with them, feel with them, love, cry, and bleed with them. So, I'm not even a little embarrassed to admit that when I found out Gayle Forman had written a sequel from Adam's POV 3 years later, I made some really interesting noises, jumped up and down a little bit, and had to take a break from my computer because I couldn't get my heart rate down. It shouldn't surprise anyone that this is/was my most highly anticipated novel of 2011.<br /><br />Antony John, the author of Five Flavors of Dumb hosted a giveaway on his site for a copy of his novel and his ARC of Where She Went. Not gonna lie- I freaked out a little bit. I got my #1 most anticipated book along with a book I've heard nothing but good things about and had been interested in reading. Made of Awesome! So thanks Antony for giving me a copy, and thanks Gayle for writing such great stuff. Now, I'm going to tell you why I loved it. Also- I'm going to assume, if you are reading my review, that you have already read If I Stay, and this review is full of spoilers for If I Stay. (Actually the existence of a sequel is a spoiler, but I digress.)<br /><br />Although this was my highly anticipated book, I was a lot scared of it. I loved If I Stay, and I thought the story was perfect as it was. I didn't think it needed anything else. What if the sequel wasn't as good? What if it ruined the way I viewed Adam and Mia?! The synopsis tells us that they aren't together anymore, and that Adam has a girlfriend. Who is not Mia. After I got this book in the mail, I stared at it for a few days, scared to open it in case my expectations and hopes were dashed into the dirt. How can you top a story like If I Stay?!<br /><br />The answer? You don't. You just finish the story. Where She Went is Adam's story. On the outside, Adam's life is perfect. He's got the rich and famous rocker lifestyle, complete with gorgeous girlfriend, but he is miserably unhappy and suffers from some serious anxiety about crowds. He hasn't talked to Mia in years, and everyone knows better than to bring her up around him. This is the story about what happens when fate gives them a possible evening together, and they decide to take it.<br /><br />Where She Went does not have the emotional impact of If I Stay. It can't. If I Stay is Mia trying to decide if she is going to live or die, and Where She Went is dealing with the aftermath of that decision, and Mia and Adam's break-up. But the magic of both these books is not the situation our characters find themselves in, but the characters themselves. The connection I shared with them as a reader was so strong I knew how they would react or feel as they did. I felt with them.<br /><br />It was so interesting being inside Adam's head this time around, and I feel like that is the real strength of the novel. He is still struggling with his role in bringing her back, only to lose her. He promised her that if she would live, he would let her leave him if she needed to, as long as she was alive in the world, somewhere. But, I don't actually think that he believed she would. So when she does, he takes it really hard. Which is, ironically, when he wrote the music that made his band such a success.<br /><br />Where She Went is told in the same style as If I Stay. We only hear what Adam is thinking, the story takes place entirely in one evening, and a lot of the details are supplied by relevant and revealing flashbacks. This is how we learn why Mia left and what their lives were like after the accident. And, it's not really a pretty picture. Things have been rough for them.<br /><br />Mia's story was scary in it's simplicity. Everything in her story pivots around one crucial event, one major decision- My family is gone, doI stay, or do I go? Adam's story is more complex. Outwardly, his life should be perfect but he's a mess. And people are not quite as understanding or empathetic that you miss your high school girlfriend as they would be about missing your entire family. Although, as I mentioned before, this story can't have the same emotional impact as If I Stay did, the emotion is definitely there, and the story is more complex, more layered. Adam has more he has to deal with than Mia did, and he handles stress in very different (often unhealthy) ways.<br /><br />I could talk your ear off  (or eyes...) about this book all day long. But, to at least appear/pretend that I know how to be concise, I'm going to leave you with the knowledge that this book is wonderfully brilliant and the perfect follow up to If I Stay. Nothing else would have worked for Mia and Adam. Love it or hate it, this was undeniably their destiny and I loved being there to watch them fulfill it.should be perfect but he's a mess.

1439190275|5.0|What can I say? I'm a fan :) I have been on Atkins for a month and lost 12 pounds. I've never been a \\"dieter\\" before because I didn't want to put the effort into doing so. What changed my mind? Seeing my husband go low carb and wanting to support him. Atkins has been an incredibly smooth transition for us. He's seen remarkable changes in his blood sugar readings! He's gone from 40 units of insulin a day with readings in the 300 range to 20 units a day with readings from 60-120, in a month. Amazing in my opinion! I am a believer :)

B0061QD7YS|5.0|Disney has done it again! With the exception of Fox and the Hound, every single 1080p re-release of our favorite animated classics have been given the absolute GREATEST possible transfer imaginable!! This is not a restoration, it is a transformation. The amount of detail painted into all the glorious Main Street USA scenery is breath-taking! And, for the first time ever, you can see it all! I don't care how many times you've seen Lady and the Tramp, you have not seen it until you watch this blu ray. I thought Alice in Wonderland, Beauty and the Beast, and Fantasia got amazing transfers.. honestly, I think this one surpasses them all.<br /><br />A few technical notes about the Blu Ray:<br /><br />ASPECT RATIO:<br />- Yes, it is in the ORIGINAL aspect ratio of 2.55:1. No worries there!<br /><br />AUDIO:<br />- Audiophiles rejoice! You have the option of either a phenomenal new 7.1 DTS-HD Master surround mix, or a freshly restored 3.0 option that is more representative of the original. I happen to prefer the new 7.1, but both are wonderful!<br /><br />Bonus Content:<br />- If the new transfer doesn't sell you alone, I was actually quite impressed with the new bonus features! They include several deleted scenes, a never-recorded song, and an extremely insightful commentary track.<br /><br />Overall: classic film lovers, painters, artists, romantics, movie collectors, and more - this is a required purchase. Lady and the Tramp is one of the greatest love stories ever told and, for the first time ever, given a jaw-dropping restoration that no generation has experienced before. I highly recommend it!<br /><br />PS: You might also want to add these to your shopping cart ;) - [[ASIN:B0026002PU Mueller's Spaghetti, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 20)]] and [[ASIN:B0035N3ADS Ragu Pasta Sauce, Old World Style, Traditional, 45-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 4)]]

B0019I6WDG|4.0|I really like this story. I like the reality of the situation. I think it can teach us all something about children not being ready to raise children. Although Juno was a bit too vocal at times, I appreciated her character. I also liked the relationship she had with her parents, being open and avoiding secrets and judgments. That's healthy if you ask me rather than the opposite. Overall, cool movie to watch with teenagers.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Van Halen is my favorite band of all time. I'd say my two favorite albums are VH II and Fair Warning. I have been waiting for this for 16 years since they released those 2 new songs off the Greatest Hits package. I remember that day like it was yesterday.  When I heard Tattoo, I was slightly discouraged initially. It wasn't what I was expecting, however I liked the song. But I kept the faith, and refused to bash the band like many others who heard Tattoo and discounted the rest of the 13 songs on the album without even a listen. Man oh man, and does the rest of the album kill!  Each and every song following Tattoo are extraordinary songs. Van Halen have returned to form and given us their most aggressive album ever. And to the nay sayers who are complaining about them re-working old unreleased songs, so what? They are THEIR songs that were UNRELEASED for a reason. They were unfinished in the form they were in. I can't understand why a band isn't allowed to use their OWN material that THEY wrote and never released officially. Would you rather other writers come in or Van Halen to sound more modern like Nickelback or have Eminem come in and rap in the middle of a song? Quit complaining and thinking you can tell one of the greatest bands in history how they should sound or make an album. That's why they are Van Halen and you are you sitting in your mother's basement with a negative attitude. If you actually listen to the album, it is, IMO, their best since Fair Warning.  Stand-out tracks for me are: Chinatown, As-Is, She's the Woman, Trouble with Never, Stay Frosty, Outta Space, and Big River. However, each and every song is stellar. Even Tattoo which, when listened with the rest of the album, grows on you like a nice mustache.  At worst I'd say 12 excellent tracks and one not bad track (Tattoo). If you ask me, that's pretty darn good.  A note on production: I was very scared of how this album would sound. I was afraid it would sound too glossy and polished and poppy.I was pleasantly surprised to hear that this album sounds just as good and as raw as any of their early albums. Big Brown Sound from Eddie and Thunderous drum sound from Alex is all there. Very pleased with the production! I feel that background vocals were handled very well also! While Mikey is missed, I didn't think about him once while I listened bc Wolfie nailed it. He is killing it on the bass (almost sounds like Sheehan) and definitely did a tremendous job on the backing vocals. Mikey will always be a part of VH but if that's what it took for these guys to get along again, have fun, and make a great album, then so be it. Wolfie is doing a great job at filling Mike's shoes!  A huge thanks to Van Halen for restoring my faith in modern music!

This set is broken up into six \\"books\\", which have six disks in each, and each disk has five or six episodes in order (ep 1-6, 80-85, ect.). The accompanying book gives the episode names, numbers, and a short description of each episode. There's also a few games dispersed through the disks, as well as director's commentary, and a few \\"behind the scenes\\" stuff as well.<br /><br />All in all, if your a fan of F*R*I*E*N*D*S then this collection is way cheaper then buying each season separately.

0671027344|5.0|I've read this book every year since the 7th grade.  This book brings me back to my adolescence.  In high school I was also friends with the older kids; they taught me how to be cool and they brought me to my first parties.  This coming-of-age novel provides nostalgia encompassing memories of the best and worst times of adolescence.  It gives readers someone to relate to when feeling like there's no one to turn to.  After reading this book year after year, I am grounded by reading it and brought back to my own identity whenever I feel too caught up in the stresses of adult life--I'm brought back to the simplicity of when I was young misfit and how far I have grown.  I hope this book can do that for you, too.
B000001FOL|5.0|Okay i can understand saying shes not the greatest singer or that she didnt write much for the album but saying that a jackson brown original is better than a nico cover is downright ridiculous. For starters i think this album is the first time we truly see nico shine in her own way and not one manipulated by warhol or reed. Yea she covers others matterial but so what shes does an excellent job i think. And to anyone saying her music only evokes one mood and its sadness??? yea no crap!!! Nico was a mid thirties junkie with an illegitimate love child son who was quite sad so of course thats the mood that is coming across! i myself think the album is a masterpiece because it prepares you for the true gem The Marble Index. But seriously anyone looking to get into nicos solo stuff has to start with chelsea girls.
B004KSQN7C|5.0|I got the deluxe as it features Up N Down from the DVD but axed from the regular CD. Love it so much that Femme Fatale is on regular rotation!  It's a very engineered set in terms of arrangements and vocal effects. The last time I really enjoyed a vocally processed dance recording was Cher's Believe. Britney really does have a solid song writing and production team behind her.  Besides the biggies here like Hold It Against Me (rather like soft aural porn) and Till The World Ends, I really love Trip To Your Heart. It should be a single. (Drop Dead) Beautiful makes a fab strutting catwalk number. Criminal is very quirky with a tinge of melancholy. The team really has an ear for great tunes.  Femme Fatale deluxe only contains four additional tracks in addition to the standard edition and comes at a rather steep price. Sony could have put in her videos to really make this edition a collector's item.  The packaging is beautifully done in classic gold, white and black. However, it's a bitch to take out the disk from the inner side opening as it is very tight.
1400032717|5.0|Eugenia Lampiri  \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\"    The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon    It was night, and Christopher heard a dog barking. The next morning he finds out that his neighbor's dog was murdered! That is when he starts to search for clues, throughout the way he finds out things he never knew, and that is when it's harder for him to trust someone.  This book is an adult adventure, full of mystery. The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon deserves  ''''' (five stars) because it has a lot of details the author uses, the setting, the characters, great organization (point of view) and good use of tense.    I have read bad reviews about this book, and I really do not agree with any of them. I think this book deserves at least one award first because while I was reading this book, I felt like I was part of the book, like I was actually there because of all the details that the author used for example I felt like I was right next to Christopher when he said \\"...and there was nothing to do except to wait and to hurt.\\". Secondly while reading I was like \\"what is going to happen next\\" which means it kept me interested like in the part he said \\"And I know I can do this because I went to London on my own, and because I solved the mystery...and I was brave and I wrote a book and that means I can do anything.\\" I am impressed that an adult book kept a child interested. Finally, I didn't want the book to end!    Another thing I really liked about this book is the setting(s). The novel is set in two, very different locations. Swindon, Christopher's home, where everything is comfortingly familiar, and London, the world Christopher experiences on his way to London and London itself, places where Christopher finds it very difficult to manage. This is one of the few times that I appreciate that the author changes the setting of the book. It makes the book more interesting.   I really enjoyed the firstfew chapters of the book because it was describing the characters. I really enjoyed reading about Christopher. One of the things I will never forget is when he said that he was 15 years, 3 months and 2 days old that made me think that he is really good at math, then I read on and found out he was really good at math. I also thought that he was really smart when I read that knows all the countries of the world and their capitals and every prime number up to 7,057! He relates well to animals but has no understanding of human emotions. He cannot stand to be touched. Also he detests the color yellow. There are allot more characters in this book and here are some: -Ed Boone (Christopher's father)  -Judy Boone (Christopher's mother) -Siobhan (Christopher's Para-professional, friend, and mentor) -Mr. Jeavons (the psychologist at Christopher's school) -Mr. Roger Shears (One of the neighbors who lived near the Boones) -Mrs. Eileen Shears (Mr. Shears's wife) -Mrs. Alexandra (an old lady, who is one of Christopher's neighbors) -Wellington (Mrs. Shears' large black poodle, which Christopher finds dead in her garden, with a garden fork sticking out of him) and a lot more.    Point of view is really important in this book. This book is seen through Christopher's eyes (point of view). At some points of the book the author adds some details when he wants to show how Christopher felt. I found that really interesting and creative because you knew how two different viewers felt. When there are two points of view you know how the book is seen through the narrator and the main character in the book.    Mark Haddon made his book in present tense. If the author had made the book in past tens it would change the whole thing because now it shows like everyday life, but if it was past it would be different for example there is some type of technology and it would totally change the setting of the book, the plot, everything.  Also depends how much in the past the book would be in, and they didn't infer that there were computers.    This book is mostly for ages twelve (12) and up but anyone can read this book if they are interested to realistic fiction, young adult books, and mystery.  This book deserves  ''''' (five stars) because it has an adventurous plot, great organization (point of view) and good use of tense.  I believe everyone should read it.  Thank you!
B005HSG3TC|1.0|I purchased this anticipating the folding/easel back would enable me to read from the Fire easily from the bedside table. I felt the material was so flimsy that it did not stay upright. I also wanted something a bit more protective of my Kindle. I returned it immediately (I of course paid the shipping...)

B0050XFXT0|5.0|This episode was amazing to watch... the TARDIS has always played a central role in every storyline, to the point where some viewers may take it for granted. But this time, it gets to be the star of the show. This episode really gets the message across that the TARDIS isn't simply a machine, but that it's, in a sense, \\"alive.\\" I thought the TARDIS was portrayed EXACTLY the way I thought it should. Definitely in my list of top 10 Doctor Who episodes since starting in 2005.
0307593312|2.0|I just finished this book. It was released in Japan in three separate parts, but the american version is one gigantic tome. I don't think it was worth reading and I wouldn't recommend it. It is very repetitive and murikami (or the translators) relies on simple metaphors and cliches way too much. Way too drawn out with no real conclusion or message. Kind of waffling plot with simple characters that come and go and don't adhere to eachother. The attempt to create a fantasy world is pretty lost - too many blind leaps of tried logic to really pull the reader.
B001EC3JME|5.0|My Leatherman XL50 flashlight fits great in this case. It's sturdy, and made with high quality materials. It is a little difficult getting it on and off my belt due to complex stability of the clip, but with practice it will clip on and off much smoother. I highly recommend this product.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|I ordered this because I wanted to keep a microSD to USB adapter in the Compact Flash slot of my PDA. This is thin enough that it can fit inside the spacer that was provided in my iPAQ PDA. Now I can transfer files via USB from any computer to my PDA using the microSD card. Very convenient.  A tip: The plastic shell is very thin, and eventually breaks due to pressure from the clips inside a USB port. I pulled the metal sleeve off, and then poured a little Epoxy resin into the space between the circuit board and the plastic shell. Once the resin cured, it provided a hard backing that will make this item last much longer in regular use.

B006UG90RM|5.0|I think it's incredible and finally something worth the wait.  It is a true and brilliant rock and roll record.  It's got so much vibe and groove.  With much of anything Eddie has done on record has always impressed me, this is the first time all 4 individual members shine.  I love Mikey and it would be a true reunion if he were there and his vocals are missing of course.  But Wolfie is soooo talented !!  Alex does great, Dave is great and then there is Eddie - HOLY SMOKES !!!  The hell he has been through over the last decade is well known and it really sounds like he channeled his experiences into his guitar.  He is off the hook !!  If I were to describe this record in 1 word it would be: Agressive  It's got some heavy stuff but of course is lightened up by the return of Diamond Dave.  Alot of people will say it sounds like a specific piece of their past but to me it has a sound of Van Halen being Van Halen in 2012.  They took a different path when Sammy came on board and it was different and took them to a different level, not bad or good, just different.  This is like after a few exits ... they got back on the path and met Dave and it is a natural progression from where they left off in 1984 ... it's just 28 years ears later.  Welcome Back !
B006HC9AUG|4.0|Die Zauberflöte still represents a challenge that has perhaps been neglected in recent times by the major modern revisionist directors in favour of finding new ways to explore the Mozart/Da Ponte trilogy of works - The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni and Così Fan Tutte - so a fresh approach is always welcome. William Kentridge, the stage director for this production of Die Zauberflöte at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan may not have any new ideas about the opera's central theme of light versus darkness being that of man seeking to rise above their baser natures and impulses, seeking enlightenment over obscurantism, or rationalism over superstition, but as an artist, illustrator and animator the South African director does at least approach these themes with a very distinct style of his own.  The period setting chosen appears to be late 19th century, the beginning of the age of technological advancement, the characters dressed to looking like figures from a Jules Verne or a H.G Wells novel. At the centre of these scientific advances in this production is the camera, a box that in itself represents the use of light - the ingenuity of man - to forge something out of the darkness, much as Mozart uses the music of the magic flute for the same purpose. Within the box of the stage, Kentridge uses shadows and light in a variety of ways that fits in well with this theme, as well as often being visually very striking. Thus, in the opening of Act 1, Tamino battles with a snake that is a projection created by the three ladies of the Queen of the Night, who form it out of the shadowplay of their arms. So right from the outset, Tamino literally defeats a shadow of the forces of darkness, working effectively and in keeping with a meaningful overall concept. Elsewhere, through black-and-white reversal charcoal designs, animation and even some silent movie footage Kentridge finds a variety of means to illustrate the journey and trials of the protagonists, their acquisition of wisdom and knowledge, as well as reflect the symbolism, numerology and the Masonic imagery that is associated with the themes of the opera.  The orchestration here sounds somewhat lifeless, and no-one on the stage - with the exception of Alex Exposito's Papageno, looks like they are having much fun with what should be a delightfully invigorating work. I'm presuming that the arrangement used here by Ronald Böer is period - or more likely semi-period for La Scala - but it feels like there is a distinct lack of verve in the playing and the performances. In a good interview in the extra features, Böer recognises that Die Zauberflöte contains all the different facets of Mozart's work, but the complex personality of Mozart himself is in there too, reflected in each of the characters, and that doesn't always come across here. Tamino can be a difficult role to breathe any personality into, but you don't necessarily need to - the character's (and Mozart's) purity, youthful idealism and single-minded determination (yet one that is open to new ideas and a sense of betterment) is all there in the music and Saimir Pirgu sings it beautifully. So too does Genia Kühmeier's Pamina represent the other side of that nature with a similar clear purity of voice - her 'Ach, ich fühl's' is one of the loveliest I've heard. Alex Exposito is the only figure who demonstrates any kind of life and personality, and he sings Papageno well with clear diction. Where Die Zauberflöte really needs character however, a sense of grandness and imperiousness to give depth and gravity to the work, is in the opposing forces of Sarastro and the Queen of the Night, and unfortunately, neither Albina Shagimuratova nor Günther Groissböck are entirely up to the task.  All in all however, if it's a little dryly performed and lacking a little bit of spark, this is nonetheless a strong performance of Die Zauberflöte that manages to take a fresh approach to the score and the themes of the work. It's certainly worthwhile for William Kentridge's unique approach to production design that makes this never anything less than a rich and imaginative spectacle. The Blu-ray is of the usual high video and audio standards, with extra features consisting of a Cast Gallery and a very interesting twelve-minute Interview with the director and conductor.

B005EHNEDO|5.0|There's been a lot of criticism aimed at Wilco over the last couple of years.Most of their detractors are of the opinion that they have become too conventional compared to the groundbreaking work they were known for at the start of the decade.This might be partially true but it doesn't take anything away from the fact that Wilco are still capable of coming up with well written and meticulously performed tunes.Looking back, great songwriting has always been at the core of their success, rather than any tampering with sound collages and strange noises that was an indispensable part of their music on some of their most acclaimed records.Wilco has always drawn heavily from a plethora of different classic rock and country influences and they might be perceived as being retro in that regard but the songs always came out sounding fresh and new rather than sounding like rehashes of someone else's songs.The whole love is just another excellent record in that vein.You will hear Grateful Dead, The Beatles, Neil Young and other greats in these songs but they never come across as being contrived.What is also worth noting is the phenomenal execution of these songs with  Nels Cline being at the forefront of the exceptional  musicianship with his subtle guitar playing greatly embellishing Tweedy's gems.Tweedy's vocal performance is heartfelt as usual, which is mostly notable on more somber acoustic guitar laden songs.I might prefer Sky Blue Sky and Wilco(the album) but I still marvel at the consistency of this record.Wilco have never released a record that could be considered mediocre let alone bad by any stretch of imagination so you can't go wrong with purchasing of any of their records.However, the newcomers should get Being There and Yankee Foxtrot first and then proceed to other albums.

B006UG90RM|5.0|Hey, if Zeppelin, Clapton and half of the hard rock heroes of the sixties and seventies can fill albums with - and make careers out of - old blues standards, why can't VH go back to their own previous bag of riffs to resurrect and re-work early-career material into a new album?? And if, as the saying goes, \\"great music is timeless\\", then it truly doesn't matter when some of these songs were first written. I, for one, have been listening to the \\"demo bootlegs\\" for years, so many of these songs have a bit of familiarity to them, but the band has wisely re-jiggered, refinished and punched these up to new standards that make them sound as fresh in 2012 as any Halen fanatic could expect. No keyboards (outside of a few flourishes on Tattoo), and no Van Hagar-like ballads. No, just balls-to-the-wall Van Halen - an album that could easily fit alongside Fair Warning as perhaps the heaviest record they've ever done. If the band's aim was to recapture that early explosion we all heard in those first six Dave albums, then their goal has been met. I mean, it was going to be great to hear from this band again no matter what they ended up releasing - Van Halen without Roth is like Deep Purple without Ian Gillan, after all - but here they have blown away all expectations; firing on all cylinders, even after all these years!!
0060873027|1.0|I am getting so sick of these writers whoring out their names simply to sell a bad book written by someone else.  Do they really need the money that much.  Chrichton's name is plastered all over the cover of this book, but that is the bulk of his contribution to it.  As to the book, the plot is stupid and the writing is unbelievably bad.  Do not buy this book, you will be sorry.  I am sorry that I even wasted my time on it let alone my money.  From here on, I will never buy a book based only on an authors name.

B0060FXBNM|5.0|I really like the Transformers movies for the action. Coming from a girl who isn't really into action movies, that says a lot. The only negative thing I have to say is about the movies themselves, not the box set itself. I am not a huge fan of the whole love story dilemma that was woven into each movie. I haven't read any of the comics, so I don't know how well the movies follow the comics, but I just felt that the movies should have been less about the teen love story and more about the transformers story. All in all, I was very satisfied with this trilogy pack because I got all three movies in one box set, for one low price. If you have never seen the movies, or have missed one in the series, I suggest getting this set so you can watch the series from beginning to end. It really is better that way.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|No One has yet been able to dispute the facts that are presented in this documentary.  That means that they are true, and it will really disappoint you if you believe that the U.S. Government is concerned about the health and security of its citizens.  This shows you the insane lengths that this country goes to in its pursuit of energy resources, at the EXPENSE of its citizen's lives and property.  If you don't want to be made extremely angry, don't buy the movie.
0143119680|4.0|I just finished this book last night and agree with the reviews that describe it as a mixed bag.  I tend to gravitate towards thrillers, so  I found myself impatiently reading through some of the discourse.  For instance, every interaction is described in painstaking detail, and I wondered at times when something would \\"happen\\" even as I enjoyed reading the prose.  The protagonist is likeable, though a bit dramatic and immature.  Of course, I liked that the protagonist's love interest is such an attentive male who exhibits the right amount of machismo and sensitivity, so I will read the second book when it comes out to see how the relationship progresses.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved, loved, loved this book.  I really enjoyed the whole scorched earth / city of ember (but way better) vibe.  Now I just need to get my friends to read it so we can geek out on our theories that set this world in motion.

1878424114|4.0|We are 4 people who have bought the book. We read one chapter each week before we meet and discuss what we have experienced during the reading of the chapter. The learning and the  interesting thing is to se how different our experiences are. This goes for both the feelings and the meaning. In this way our awareness  is developed. This gives us better understanding of our interaction with people and things happening around us.  For the last 6 years I have started many groups doing this with different books . I have also done it with my own book \\" Getting the best return\\". I got the idea from Bob Proctor  in Life Success. He call it Master mind groups. The first book I used was \\"Think and grow rich\\" av Napoleon Hill. That is one of my favorit books when it comes to personal development.  Chopras book is very interesting and gives us an even better understanding of ourself. If you like to develop your mind, try it. It is cheap and can give very good results.  Carerra

B0067LY4WG|5.0|This review will address the big question: is Old Ideas a proper Leonard Cohen album like The Future, his last (20 years ago) great effort? The only thing on the two albums subsequent to The Future that matched any of his highs was \\"In My Secret Life\\", deceptive opener to 2001's Ten New Songs. That track had rinky-dink instrumentation and eternal truth in just the right combination, the kind that floored listeners of the album I'm Your Man.  It's of course silly to complain that Laughing Len sings about death too much. Death is one of the life forces of poetry, Leonard's other great line of work. Death is an understandable preoccupation of almost all art, and just about every kind of music apart from the fluffiest pop consciously drenches itself in it. So, that Cohen studies the process and ideas of death is unremarkable in itself.  The old ham has been closing down, ageing and dying with particular vigor for nearly quarter of a century, though. It's a paradoxically sincere shtick, and it began in earnest with \\"I Can't Forget\\" and \\"Tower Of Song\\".  Death is closer than ever. Leonard Cohen has had to come out of retirement for Old Ideas and these poetic last throes are, in line with the natural order of things, more real than ever.  How well put are the goodbyes on Old Ideas, though, given that Leonard Cohen said them all a few times a long time ago, eased himself into retirement, artistically said hello to death, all that? Do \\"Going Home\\" and what follows make for a curious encore?  Leonard Cohen is markedly paradoxical. His lavish humility tells you he's long sustained a tremendous ego. If he leaks self-aggrandizement in the studio, he does so most in his penchant for anthems. A couple turn up on Old Ideas. The problem with \\"Show Me The Place\\" and \\"Come Healing\\" is if anything musical rather than lyrical. It's OK, understandable. Anthems and hymns involve a precarious bit of magic to work fully. Think of the rinky-dink form, in terms of the accompaniment and the word, of \\"Hallelujah\\", one of last century's great hymns.  Old Ideas is overwhelmingly easy to accept all in all. The accompaniment is natural. More important, Leonard Cohen does what you're supposed to do, takes the old to make it new. Most important, the ideas that he manages to make new are several of the wisest, as well as the oldest, that we have.  This review is too long already. I'd rather you find the magic in \\"Amen\\", \\"Darkness\\", \\"Crazy To Love You\\" and all the others yourself anyway. I just wanted to help point you in the right direction: Old Ideas is as good as any great Leonard Cohen album. You have nothing to fear if that's what you want, you have exactly that to love. I trust you know how much a great Leonard Cohen album means, how dearly to hold something like that.
