Thankfully I never did put that lame business out there.<br /><br />During my first day in an actual College I learned something about coding and matrices and arrays, and some other stuff about dangling particaples, and spelling......<br /><br />This book blew me away. One minute I am one with the China Marines duking it out with those Akkido using Nips just after being in a Jap bar eating raw fish.<br /><br />Everybody in this book seems to understand Manilan, English, various Chinese dialects, and the Limits to a Function.<br /><br />Bletchley Park? Well it ain't MacArthur Park for sure.<br /><br />What a delightful piece of work it truly is. Oh say can you hear that star spangled banner ye'et KABOOM... and then we are off to the races.<br /><br />I learned more about submarines and morphine in this book than I did in Chemistry 101 or in about 50 W.E.B. Griffin novels. I learned more about Jungles than I did by reading all 25 Edgar Rice Burroughs Tarzan books at least twice.<br /><br />The Japs have an unbreakable cypher that was broken at just about the time that they created it. The Krauts have an unbreakable code that was also broken by our Allies who refused to use the asset. What the heck was wrong with those Brits anyhow? I kept wondering to myself...if there is a grain of truth to any of this then why oh why did 50 million folks have to die? Was it all about the money? Who is better at keeping secrets? Are the English people really as dumb as their Royal Highnesses come across as being?<br /><br />I dunno which part was my favorite. There are so many good ones. The Cap'n Crunch stuff was bizarre, why not throw that stuff into the middle of a work about War, Cyberspace, the pursuit of purple bottles numbered and labeled by Nazi Doctors who were so intent on curtailing drug abuse?<br /><br />Who got the gold? Ferdinand Marcos?<br /><br />And that stuff about the exquisite nylons furniture store was in a word, hysterical.<br /><br />What a terrific read.<br /><br />Right up my alley leading to Golgotha.nylons furniture store was in a word, hysterical.

B0000258CK|5.0|Had wornout my cassette of this album and hadn't really thought about the music until I saw a PBS special with Carole King and James Taylor.  Had to find the CD and did.  Was so good to get the CD.  Like finding an old friend.  Great!!
B000VR824S|5.0|This DVD is an true music INSPIRATION.  Excellent filming and music!  Jeff Beck and John McLaughlin will blow your mind away not to mention their bassists!!...and of course Clapton, Mayer, Winwood - geeez, the list goes on!!  DVD #2 wins me over.
B003XMUFGQ|4.0|Its interesting to see what a recording artist comes up with when that artist acts as his own producer. For instance, what would Unplugged have sounded like without the benefit of Russ Titleman? Clapton produced this album along with fellow guitarist Doyle Bramhall 11. Together, they came up with 14 relatively diverse tracks that they took obvious pleasure in creating. Anyone skeptical of Clapton's music producing talent need only to listen to \\"Concert for George\\" to be convinced.<br /><br />In this case, the end result is solid, eclectic and easy on the ears. Nothing that will make the hair on the back of your neck stand up but hey, thats just fine. When you want to be buzzed, listen to \\"Freightloader\\".<br /><br />While my taste runs to the more traditional blues of \\"Can't Hold Out Much Longer\\" and \\"Everything Will be Alright\\" there are pretty good New Orlean's style \\"My Friend The Milkman Said\\" and \\"When Somebody Thinks You're Wonderful\\" that are surprising, honest and refreshing.<br /><br />I love the groove of \\"That's No Way to Get Along\\". Less successful is \\"Diamonds Made From Rain\\" with Sheryl Crowe which is a good song but somehow soulless and far less satisfying than other selections on the album.<br /><br />Clapton is still fine vocally although I was more than a little worried about his attempts at American Song Book classics. EC is no Rod Stewart. \\"How Deep is the Ocean\\" is a bit wobbly but \\"Autumn Leaves\\", comes through just fine.<br /><br />There is a nostalgic, autumn-of-the-years tone to this album. \\"Rockin' Chair\\", \\"Judgement Day\\", \\"Autumn Leaves\\" are introspective and nostalgic. Sic transit, gloria mundi EC! You are indeed a guitar god who has passed the test of time.<br /><br />One last comment on the album art, a subject commented on by multiple other reviewers. When I first glanced the album cover on Amazon I thought that the photo was of Mickey Rourke pre-plastic surgery. EC, this is just not a good look for you! Its obvious that the superficial album aesthetics was not a priority for these musician-guys...in this MP3 era.  Doyle Bramhill took many of the photos. And there you have it. The music is the thing.musician-guys...in this MP3 era.  Doyle Bramhill took many of the photos. And there you have it. The music is the thing.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this DVD. I had bought other exercise DVDs in the past and either grew bored of them early on, or felt they did not provide the desired results. This was not the case with 30 Day Shred. From the first workout, I was hooked. The workouts are short, but they definitely challenge you and give you results- I went from a size 6 to a size 2!
0525951652|1.0|The publisher expects kindle users to pay more for this E book, even though their printing and distribution costs are significantly lower than the print edition. Consider too that the book purchased as an e format is basically a license to read this book as many times as you want in the e format.  The book can't be shared, or loaned out, or given to a friend in the hospital or even donated to a senior citizen reading cart or a local library. No one will be able to share your book.This was not the premise on which I purchased my kindle.   E books were supposed to be cheaper than printed books.

0307454541|4.0|First Impressions -- Author Biop?:<br /><br />I'm sure in my book review I will not have a lot of new things to say, but will contribute my insight into this fascinating if dysfunctional mystery novel, The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo!<br /><br />The back-story regarding the author is interesting.  Stieg Larsson was a man, born in 1954, a Swedish journalist who had a life companion, unmarried, worked for a magazine, Expo, and campaigned against neo-Nazi groups in Sweden.  He died suddenly of a heart attack before finishing his fourth novel.<br /><br />The book has the same general themes:  Neo-Nazi-ism, working for a small magazine, having a life companion (except in this fiction, she's married), and having a journalist (except he's disgraced).  Interesting parallels throughout.<br /><br />Story Rolls But Takes Time To Pick Up!<br /><br />The first thing that struck me was the slow, almost biographical documentary style regarding the life of Blomkvist.  We learn that he recently tried and failed to convict a major financier in the Swedish arena of corrupt business leaders, Wennerstrom.  We learn the back-story of this, how he met an old friend on a boat and got incriminating evidence against him -- however, Blomkvist loses a libel trial and ends up getting a prison sentence.<br /><br />The reader never really meets Wennerstrom and the author finds no need to further instruct the reader as to the man's life.  In fact, he is really only mentioned as a man greedy with power and wealth.  And we find out what fingers he has in the corrupt pies of insanity and politics.<br /><br />Rather, the book gives us background into Blomkvist's life:  basically a journalist who has had some modicum of success in his life, and although a man of impeccable journalistic morals and looks down on other financial journalists as hacks -- his personal morality is sketchy at best.<br /><br />His girlfriend -- who's married to another, but they have this \\"understanding\\" wink-wink -- is Eva Berger who runs The Millennium, the magazine that they both work for.  To make a long story short, we learn more about the magazine, the people in it, and the goals they are all going for.<br /><br />The other side of the spectrum is Lisbeth Salander -- the girl with those darn dragon tattoos -- who is another conflicted, strange person.  Blomkvist at least has some sense of intelligence and understanding of humans.  Lisbeth has none of that.  She is very introverted, becomes the \\"perfect victim\\" of the law, the courts and psychiatrists -- and ends up the ward of the state.  All because she simply cannot be bothered with people!<br /><br />Despite this hate-filled notion that everyone thinks she's a freak and her revenge-spawned intention to get at every woman-hating man in existence, we learn a few things about her \\"friends\\" -- and about her unusual ability (she considers it freaky) to have a photographic memory and is an expert hacker -- perhaps the best hacker in all of Europe.<br /><br />Meeting of the Minds:<br /><br />The story really starts moving when two things happen:  Blomkvist gets a job to write a biography on the Vanger family, one of the richest and most influential in all of Sweden.  They are also the most insane, the most amoral bunch of people you've ever had the displeasure of meeting!<br /><br />Henry Vanger actually has the bio as a feint.  In actuality, would Blomkvist please find out whatever happened to Harriet Vanger, who disappeared 40 years ago?<br /><br />After some adventure (and sexual misadventure and some out & out rape & torture -- be warned, not for the faint of heart!) Salander runs into Blomkivst and becomes his assistant researcher in finding out what happened to Harriet.<br /><br />Was Harriet murdered?  And does the murderer still live after all these years?<br /><br />The author's writing style is very interesting -- he takes a long, long time to build up suspense and on occasion beats the reader over the head with some pretty horrific tales!  Then we slow down, almost boring.  Then we cannot stop turning the pages fast enough!<br /><br />Is this book as dysfunctional as the Vanger Family?  Holy smokes!<br /><br />Loved the Ending, But Takes Time To Wrap Up Loose Ends!<br /><br />The ending was mildly surprising and most of the characters are involved as well.  But Larsson takes some time, a good 20 plus pages, to wrap up all the loose ends.<br /><br />My only other criticism involves sympathy:  should I sympathize with an old Swedish journalist cum womanizer who's been dissed by the Wennerstrom Corp., or should I feel for the amoral young woman who could not care less about others to the point of fanatic selfishness?  Tough call!<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />The book is highly recommended for its style and substance, not being afraid of criticizing financial institutions, journalistic bad sense and right wing fanaticism (and associated sexual perversion, protected by the monied elite).<br /><br />Larsson will be missed.  His style of writing takes some getting used to, but man what novels he would have wrote if he had stayed a bit longer to finish that fourth, incomplete novel!<br /><br />Others To Read!<br /><br />[[ASIN:0307594777 Stieg Larsson's Millennium Trilogy Bundle: The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, The Girl Who Played with Fire, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest]]<br />[[ASIN:1844549402 The Man Who Left Too Soon: The Biography of Stieg Larsson]]s book as dysfunctional as the Vanger Family?

B003ZK58WM|1.0|I am afraid that I am in lock step with all of the reviewers who are angry over the price of this book.  It was made available today, and until today I thought the $19.99 price was a typo.    I am a huge fan of Follet, particularly \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"World Without End.\\"  It is truly a shame that I will not be enjoying this piece of work until the Kindle price comes down.  I simply cannot justify the cost.  I have had a kindle long enough that the amount of books I have purchased has far outweighed the original cost of the device.      For those out there telling us to stop whining and buy a paper copy, I have only this to say:  Those who have purchased a Kindle have typically done so for specific reasons.  Whether it is the price of the books, the convenience, or simply an environmental issue, we deserve to pay less for a book, if only because there is no printing overhead.       Simply put, it makes no sense for myself and others like me to purchase the Kindle edition.  Mr. Follet, I hope that you and your publisher are reading or at least being made aware of the issues being raised here.  It breaks my heart to give it one star, but it looks as though the reviews might turn some heads.  I know it did mine.

6305291446|3.0|Picking up 20 years after the end of Halloween II, where Michael Myers is seen burning to death, Laurie Strode, now Julie Tate, has faked her death and become the headmistress of a private school in California, praying that Michael will never find her. She is a functional alcoholic with a medicine cabinet full of drugs, and sleeps with a gun under her pillow. She is struggling to keep things together. Especially now, because it's Halloween.<br /><br />As messed up as Laurie is, she is still has her wits intact, and still retains a healthy paranoia, if everyone else thinks she is overdramatic and overwrought. Good thing, because on Halloween night, a strange car driven by a man in a mask shows up at the gates of the school, the phone's are out, and the school is nearly empty, with the students on a camping trip to Yosemite. Just the sort of environment that Michael Myers loves. There's only one thing that could make this time worse than the last--Laurie has a son, and he didn't go to Yosemite.<br /><br />But Laurie is still Laurie, with all her wits and resilience, and the world definitely needs more horror with strong women in the lead. But there could be more originality, more advantages taken of the new paths horror has taken in the past 20 years.
B0036EH3XE|3.0|A lot of time was invested in the six seasons of this show with so much promise. But it was always even, sigh, unto the end, two steps forward and one step back. Question after question presented and just when you think there is an answer, another curve ball was thrown in the plot, which could have been totally delicious, alas if all the rabbit trails we were sent down, had rabbits at the end of them. It was not to be. I could have added another floor to my house with all the time invested in Lost and then was  left dangling.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|this was shipped right away and its pretty cheap compared to other places that sell it. Awesome if your fan.
B002VPE1XE|5.0|The camera case is, as it states in the product title--basic. This is what I was looking for. Well constructed, you are not likely to find it coming apart at the seams when you are out in the wild. The case is big enough that I can fit my camera, a slice of padded foam and a small video camera if I put them sideways/face-to-face. There is a zipper on the front with a side pocket that fits digital media cards. If I use the bag just for my camera, it also will fit my small battery recharger.<br /><br />One reviewer mentioned the velcro tabs seemed flimsy. I've had no trouble with it coming undone. The case is great for packing your camera for a trip in your carry on luggage or for storing in the car. I found the velcro fastener totally adequate for taking the camera into the field. The camera is easy to get at by quickly unsnapping (velcro) the front tab.<br /><br />Definitely well worth the investment!
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I'll buy Fall of Giants when you lower the price to $9.99.  Sorry, I am not going to buy this or ANY book on Kindle for $19.99.  Nice try.  I buy at least a book a week on Kindle and will continue to do so, but I will never pay this much.
0307592839|5.0|I first read an excerpt from this book in The New Yorker and couldn't wait to read the whole thing.  It's a series of linked chapters told from the viewpoint of different characters, most of whom have some involvement in, or were touched by, the music business.  It skips backward and forward in time from the 70s to now-ish.  The characters are really interesting and so is the music business setting.  But somehow the novel ends up being about time (\\"time is a goon\\" says one of the characters) and loss and not knowing what you have when you have it.  But it's not depressing, I enjoyed the ride with these characters.
B0021L8V1G|4.0|Given the monster amount of goodies and special features for the two-disc version of Iron Man, I was pretty eager to purchase the same for Iron Man 2.  But I find myself painfully disappointed.  The full content of extras includes two featurettes (totaling 15 minutes), 5 deleted scenes, and a music video.  Overall, I find the whole of it to be sorely lacking, particularly in comparison to the first one.  The only advantages (for some people) are the commentary by Jon Favreau, and the transferable digital copy.  For myself, if I had known it would be so sparse, I would've saved a few dollars and bought the single-disc edition.    As for the movie itself, I liked it as well as the first.  They both suffer plot and character issues, but succeed because of the charisma of Robert Downey Jr.  Yes, the second one has just a little bit too many characters with just a little bit too much going on, but unlike Dark Knight, it never loses track of its protagonist, still serving at the core of the film, and pushing it along to make it every bit as good as the best of its genre.
1441866868|4.0|I've only listened to a few audiobooks, but I've found many of the readers severely lacking in range and/or talent.  This reader, however, is excellent.  Except for a couple minor slipups across these 16 CDs, he portrayed more than a dozen characters and a narrator with unique and interesting voices.  Those voices each portrayed dozens of emotions so effectively that it felt like several actors performing the lines instead of just one man.  Excellent job.    And the writing in this book is also outstanding.  Even though I guessed the ending with a fair amount of accuracy by halfway through the book, I had no desire to stop listening.  The characters, while not entirely likable, were well written and highly motivated, and I found myself fascinated to know what they would do next.  The city exists as a unique character apart from the people, living and breathing on its own so much that I had to know what would become of it as well.    The story, however, while fascinating and very well told, is full of far more sex, violence, and language than I would have liked.  While nothing jarred me as being out of place within the context of the novel, dozens of people and animals are killed spectacularly, with much blood and dozens of body parts flying everywhere and described in exacting detail.  And, again, while the characters' actions sprang from clearly defined personalities and motivations, I really did not need to hear explicit details about the windup girl being repeatedly sexually assaulted.  This book is listed as appropriate for both adults and teenagers, but I would want to have some serious conversations with any teenager reading/hearing it.
0689878451|5.0|I bought this book for my family and to use in my work with early educators.  It is lovely.  I became interested in this book because it was on the Banned Book List.

B003XQRZ7E|2.0|All of us who don't like this record...and I really don't after trying pretty hard...wanted to like it.  After all, nobody likes wasting money on music you wished you hadn't purchased in the first place. But there literally is no redeeming quality to this outing.  It's not like - if you don't like the lead vocals, then the melodic riffs and quality of songs make up for it.  Or, if you don't like the song, but the creative performances and production are adventurous and interesting.  All aspects of this effort are less than mediocre. What a shame.  I will listen to samples next time around.  I didn't this time because I thought it was a \\"can't miss\\" project. Lesson painfully learned.

B003ZK58WM|1.0|There's absolutely no conceivable reason for pricing the ebook at more than the hardcover other than to purposely snub ebook readers.     I like Follet a lot, but I'll wait and get this one from the library even if/when they drop the price.    EDIT:  I see some people commenting that it's unfair to rate a book based on price. In most cases I'd agree, but the sheer gall of pricing the ebook higher than the hard back demands a response. The most public and visible responses we have are A) Not buying it and B) Voting the book down to show our displeasure.     If the book were $14.99, I just would have thought, \\"Eh, it shouldn't be that high, I'll get a copy at the library.\\"

He violated his immunity agreement with the FBI and really believed he would lead ADM when the dust settled. Some see him as a criminal, some a hero. View the movie judge for yourself.

B00006ZXSK|5.0|Drew Barrymore plays a spunky heroine (Danielle) in this modern take on the classic Cinderella. In 17th century France, Danielle works as a servant in her own household after her father dies. When she impersonates a nobleperson to rescue a fellow servant from being transported to Australia, she catches the eye of Prince Henry (Dougray Scott). The prince is fascinated by her attitudes, her beauty, and her aim.<br /><br />But there's always a catch - her evil stepmother (Angelica Huston) and stepsister are plotting to ensnare a prince - and will stop at nothing to snag him. The second stepsister, Jacqueline, played by Melanie Lynskey, isn't quite what she seems. Lynksey is great in one of her earliest films (you may recognize her as Rose from Two and a Half Men or her supporting roles in [[ASIN:B00007E2F5 Sweet Home Alabama]] and [[ASIN:B00337KM2S Up in the Air]]).

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Up begins with Carl Fredricksen as a boy meeting the love of his life, Ellie, and shows them dreaming about traveling to the mysterious Paradise Falls in South America. The movie fast forwards through scenes of their beautiful life together, all the while their dream of traveling eludes them. When Ellie dies, and Carl is about to be ordered by the court into the Shady Oaks retirement home, he escapes by tying thousands of balloons to his house and floating to South America. Now that Ellie is gone, Carl just wants to be left alone. Unfortunately, Russell, a local scout trying to earn a merit badge for helping the elderly, is pulled into the adventure too.<br /><br />They head for Paradise Falls and end up battling the famous explorer Charles Muntz who is trying to capture a rare bird assisted by his band of dogs who can talk with the help of special collars. After a shaky start, Russell and Carl become close friends who look forward to spending time together. Up is a wonderful story about chasing one's dreams, but more importantly, it is about making new dreams and never giving up on life.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|This film was extraordinary!  The costumes, the sets, the actors...what a fantastic piece of work!<br /><br />I know little of Victoria, which prompted me to see this movie and I was so pleased with it. I knew she was a strong willed young girl, despite her sheltered upbringing.  This film showed her in an unbiased way in my opinion, showing both her vulnerability and strength.  Her love for her Albert is legendary, and seeing them together in their youth was wonderful.  I had heard that after his death she had his clothes laid out everyday, and they did make note of that fact at the end of the film.  It made me feel badly for her, losing this man who meant so much to her and having to live so many  years alone.<br /><br />I noticed that Sarah Ferguson was one of the producers of the film, and I had heard that she is a descendent of Victoria and that she would have taken great care to be sure that the film was as true to the real story as possible, so I have faith that the movie was based on historical fact.<br /><br />Don't be afraid to give this a try.  If you love period pieces, this is for you.

B003Y3BMFW|4.0|Telephantasm. A 'Phantasm' is an illusion, or could be used to refer to a ghost. So I guess 'Telephantasm' would be an illusion at a distance, or a ghost from afar. Which I think would be an appropriate reference to what we have here -- a retrospective of a band that had been inactive for thirteen years.\\" -Kim Thayil. So this is a new collection with the purpose of exposing the legendary Soundgarden to anybody who was 8 years old when the last album came out. It does work for that, and not bad for the 38 year olds too. My only real gripe is only 12 tracks on each disc? BUT, with two discs I won't complain that much. Basically it's the 24 songs one would expect, with a handful of them being live to freshen it up. I'm happy with the live songs since I've heard the originals hundreds of times. The \\"new\\" song Black Rain is a worthy bonus. The songs I miss most...Little Joe, Ugly Truth, Loud Love, and though I'd never expect it on a best-of, Searching With My Good Eye Closed, which is mind-blowing. The REAL treat for older fans is of course the DVD. Some of these 20 videos I remember very well, some I've never seen, but they all kick-ass, or at least are interesting. Overall a huge improvement over A-Sides, though I'd easily keep A-Sides before I got the single disc version of Telephantasm. Cool artwork as well. Now can I speak for everyone when I say \\"tour time\\"!
B002JCSWV6|5.0|In 1994, Nelson Mandela assumed the presidency of a racially divided South Africa. He preached forgiveness and reconciliation in the new democracy.<br /><br />In South Africa, the national rugby team was beloved by the white minority and hated by the black majority. Mandela decided that changing that animosity would be the catalyst to uniting the country. To do that, the host nation had to win the 1995 World Cup.<br /><br />Starring Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon (and directed by Clint Eastwood), Invictus is a truly inspirational story that transcends sports and politics.<br /><br />Did you know? The movie's title comes from a William Ernest Henley poem that inspired Mandela during his imprisonment. You can read more about the true story in [[ASIN:1594201749 Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That Made a Nation]] by John Carlin.
B000A0GYD2|1.0|I watched the first episode thru gritted teeth. Slow, corny with childish dialog. How can the history of manned space missions be reduced to this? A very inaccurate portrayal of NASA and a sugared up view of the politics surrounding the whole era.  The ever present awful music is enough to put you off you next episode (yes i tried another 20 mins but enough was enough) and after reading the rest of the reviews i seem to be out numbered. Still if you want a show to watch with the intelligence required of lets say Baywatch this is for you-not me.

B003HC8I5M|5.0|Former Genesis singer/drummer/songwriter and solo superstar Phil Collins's new solo album of covers called Going Back is a must for Phil Collins and Genesis and Motown fans.<br />Before I continue the review, many of the bellyaching and complaining reviews are saying Phil has gone Rod Stewart's Great American Songbook approach to covers and so on and so forth. Many have either forgotten or failed to recognize that other rock legends from Paul McCartney (with his 1999 Run Devil Run (a covers album of 1950s rock songs plus three originals he recorded with the late Mick Green and former Pink Floyd singer/guitarist/songwriter David Gilmour on guitars and Deep Purple drummer Ian Paice)) to Canadian hard/prog rockers Rush (with their superb covers mini-album from 2004 called Feedback which saw covers of The Who, Cream, Yardbirds, Buffalo Springfield, Blue Cheer) and The Steve Miller Band (with his excellent Bingo which are all old blues numbers done in his own style was released earlier this year) in the last decade or so have put out great covers albums. There were some lemons of cover albums I admit with Queensryche's Take Cover, Styx's The Big Bang Theory (or as I call it The Big Bong Theory) and Phil's ex-Genesis bandmate Peter Gabriel's Scratch My Back (was uninspiring and BORING in my view) being the offenders. Now I got that quip off my chest, back to the album. This is Phil's first solo album since 2002's Testify and while that album had its moments, it wasn't a way to finish a solo career. In recent years, Phil had developed hearing loss in his ear which put a kabosh on his touring days with a two year long farewell tour and having two young sons with his third wife. Plus he did one last tour with Genesis in 2007. Sadly, somehow during the tour, he injured his neck and spine to the point where he has problems with his left hand now from the tambourine jigs he did nightly and him not having played much drums in recent years by then. He managed to play all of the drums on the Going Back album with the drumstick attached to his left hand, his snare hand (right hand) is fine. When I heard Phil was doing a Motown covers album, I was ecstatic as he is a huge Motown and soul music fan and his covers of \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\", \\"My Girl\\" were all superb. Also having the legendary Funk Brothers (bass player Bob Babbitt and guitarists Eddie Willis and Ray Monette) backing him I knew I was going to be in for a treat.<br />Phil chose his covers wisely and very well. First Motown group he covers is The Temptations and are well represented by Phil's excellent covers of \\"Girl (Why You Want to Make Me Blue)\\" and their 1971 classic \\"Papa Was a Rolling Stone\\". He also takes on Martha and the Vandellas' classics like \\"Heat Wave\\" (done in the same key that The Who did on their second album A Quick One (Happy Jack) but unlike The Who's fast speed version, it's done in its proper tempo), \\"In My Lonely Room\\" and \\"Jimmy Mack\\", all done great. He also takes on Stevie Wonder's \\"Uptight (Everything's Alright)\\", \\"Blame It On the Sun\\" and \\"Never Dreamed You'd Leave in Summer\\" all done well I may add. His take on The Four Tops' \\"Standing in the Shadows of Love\\", \\"Something About You\\" and \\"Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever\\" are excellent. The Supremes is represented with \\"Love Is Here and Now You're Gone\\". Smokey Robinson and The Miracles' \\"Going to A Go-Go\\" is the best cover version I've heard since The Rolling Stones' take on it back in 1982 on their live album Still Life.<br />He does an excellent take on \\"Take Me In Your Arms\\" (which had been previously done by The Isley Brothers and more famously The Doobie Brothers in 1975). Then he covers Curtis Mayfield's \\"Talking About My Baby\\" with great results. Then we have a couple of Gerry Goffin and Carole King penned covers out of \\"Some of Your Lovin'\\" and the closing title cut \\"Going Back\\" (which had previously been done famously by the late Dusty Springfield in 1966 and in 1973 by the also sadly missed Freddie Mercury of Queen as the pseudonym Larry Lurex prior to Queen's debut album being released in 1973).<br />Going Back is hands down Phil's finest solo project since Dance Into the Light. His voice is in its finest form in years and his drumming is stellar despite his physical health issues and if this is his last solo album he releases, he is going out with a bang!<br />There is various versions available (the 18 track CD, a special version with seven more songs \\"Ain't Too Proud To Beg\\" (another Temptations tune and The Rolling Stones had done this), \\"You've Been Cheatin'\\", \\"Don't Look Back\\", \\"You Really Got A Hold On Me\\" (the Smokey Robinson classic which had been covered by The Beatles and Greg lake), \\"Ain't That Peculiar\\", \\"Nowhere To Run\\" (the Martha and the Vandellas classic which had been covered by Santana) and \\"Dancing In The Street\\" (the Martha and the Vandellas classic which had been covered by David Bowie/Mick Jagger and in a rock/funk way in 1982 by Van Halen). Plus a vinyl version. There's also another deluxe import version with a DVD which has all 25 aforementioned tracks plus four more covers out of \\"Too Many Fish In The Sea\\", \\"You Keep Me Hangin' On\\" (the Diana Ross and Supremes classic which has also been covered by Vanilla Fudge, Rod Stewart and Kim Wilde), \\"Tears Of A Clown\\" (originally by Smokey Robinson and The Miracles) and \\"Too Busy Thinking About My Baby\\" and an interview with Phil on how the album was made.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!of Queen as the pseudonym Larry Lurex prior to Queen's debut album being released in 1973).

Without the right occupation, no matter how much frugality one institutes in their life, a person will never be rich.  Case closed.

Most people will never be rich because they do not have the \\"right\\" occupation.
B003405MF6|1.0|I've been a Jeff Beck fan since the Yardbirds. But I would describe this as easy listening elevator music. I mean, Somewhere Over The Rainbow? Yeah, the world really needed another version of that. This is Beck for people who don't really like electric guitar music and want some orchestra and strings to mellow out the sound. Considering that, opinion-wise, Beck himself has been hard on electric guitarists who didn't offer much new or interesting in their guitar music, he should take his own advice and go back to the basics. A waste of time. Go get Live at Ronnie Scotts if you want to hear a terrific Beck album.

B004355D8W|4.0|I've listened to the album a few times now.  I find it enjoyable and somewhat uplifting to hear these classic, sometimes obscure classic tunes in a similar, but different light.  The band / production is superb.  So good that it's not 'current' sounding -- it isn't supposed to be.  The tone fits the perioid -- 40 +/- years ago!    Phils voice fits the majority of songs well.  A handful seemed a bit out of reach though.     Highlights for me include:  Girl (Why You Wanna Make Me Blue)  Heatwave  Ain't Too Proud To Beg  Papa Was A Rolling Stone (EXCELLENT!)  Blame It On The Sun  Never Dreamed You'd Leave In Summer  Standing In The Shadows Of Love  Don't Look Back  Do I Love YOu  Loving You Is Sweeter Than Ever  Really Got A Hold On Me  Dancing In The Street  and Going Back    As a casual fan of Motown, it's quite clear that Phil's affection for the period rings through on each track.  I cannot understand why so many reviewers took the time to bash the record; almost as if they don't understand the point of the album.  Going Back is simply that...going back to a time of truly amazing and talented songwriting.    Hats off to PC for dusting them off the top shelf.

B003ZK58WM|1.0|I was looking forward to the release of this book but agree with many others that I'm insulted as a loyal Kindle owner at the price point that has been set. crazy!! I'm on board with the boycott.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I love Ken Follett but he needs to get a new publisher if this is the kind of pricing they're going to be demanding for this book. I was So Excited to see that his new book was coming out in a Kindle version until I saw that it was priced higher than the print version. What kind of messed up math is that? I will neither buy the print version nor the Kindle version until the price comes down. There is no reason that any consumer will accept for this kind of price gouging. Who does this publisher think Ken Follett is? He's a niche writer, and does not appeal to a wide readership. There are not a lot of people who are willing to committ to a 1000+ page book. This is a dangerous game for both Amazon and book publishers.
B002VPE1AW|2.0|This has to be one of worst films that I've seen in recent times. The only reason for two stars is that the graphics are incredibly well done.  The story is how a group of earthmen (mostly Marines and scientists) have need for a certain ore on a distant planet Pandora occupied by tall blue people called Navi. The earthmen have no regard for the environment of the planet, and run ripshod to tear up \\"sacred\\" landscape in order to obtain their ore. Eventually, the natives win out and are able to drive out the earthlings. So, what's wrong with the film? 1. Character development: acting was poor. None of the characters in the film could be called admirable. Most were sullen, angry people (or Navi) bent on idolization of themselves. Sig. Weaver was a worn out hag. The Navi were angry, never happy, quite war-like and certainly not at peace even with themselves. The military marines and scientists were painted at thoughtless, brain-dead, clueless. The earth \\"traitors\\" that went over to the Navi side lacked any sort of insightful virtue. 2. Plot. This film has often been criticized for portraying developers and industrialists against environmentalists. That is too simple of an analysis. It one looks at the  Navi, they are essentially dressed with African animistic paraphernalia, and the thematic structure of their \\"religion\\" is essentially animistic and pantheistic, with the world \\"force\\" emanating out though every living being that is connected to the \\"mother\\". Animism didn't get the Africans and other primitive tribes too far, and fantasy films are now necessary to promote such religion of animism that is taking over America by storm. In total, this film made it for its graphics arts effects and not for its story, and so barely deserves two stars.

B003ZK58WM|1.0|I can't help but echo the sentiments expressed here. I logged on looking forward to buying this book for my kindle, as Ken Follet is one of my favorite authors and I've been eagerly waiting this release.    Imagine my disgust when I saw the Kindle price a whole lot more expensive than the printed edition.     It may be unfair giving one star as it doesn't reflect the book content, but really guys, pricing like this spells the end of the Kindle for me. Instead, I'd rather now buy a used printed edition...less revenue to the publisher.    Learn to understand your customer. The Kindle price should be a significant savings to the printed edition:    1. Less printing costs  2. No distribution costs  3. No inventory/storage/shipping costs  4. No reselling the book as used    So how do you justify the higher price?

B000O8OTNC|5.0|This Smith's \\"Pocket Pal Multifunction Sharpener\\" is just about perfect for my needs! We have a lot of knives that we use around our workshop and in the house, and it seems that the one I need (or worse yet one my wife needs) at any given time will be dull. This handy unit is fairly small and light, making it easy to carry in my pocket so it is always on hand.<br /><br />The sharpener includes a Carbide slot to rough sharpen very dull or damaged edges, a Ceramic slot to fine hone the edge, and a Tapered \\"Diamond\\" Rod useful for sharpening serrated blades. I like that the rod snaps firmly into the case for safe keeping when not in use.<br /><br />My father was believer that a person who used a knife also needed to know how to use a whetstone (and I still do, on occasion for kitchen knives), but frankly this sharpener actually does a better job on most knives, it also handles serrated edges, and does it a lot faster.<br /><br />This is a real bargain and it far exceeded my expectations!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH
0061433047|5.0|Tiffany Aching is facing an insidious evil; \\"poison goes where poison is welcome\\".  Not a literal poison, but a poison of souls that causes the people who need witches to question, misinterpret, and attack people like Tiffany.  Tiffany spends her days helping people, she goes to \\"feed them as is hungry, clothe them as is naked, and speak up for them as has no voices\\".  What comes for her is blind and hateful.<br /><br />To add to this, the Baron is dying, his son is under the spell of someone other than Tiffany, Tiffany has to face the bane of witches throughout the ages, the other witches are watching and judging her, and, worst luck, the Nac Mac Feegle are ready help her again.  Along the way, she meets the genius behind Boffo, a skeleton that is much happier with a teddy bear than without, a young woman with a unique gift for languages, and Roland's (the son of the dying baron) fianc&eacute;e and her mother, the Duchess.<br /><br />Dark, with humorous highlights.  Sir Terry Pratchett addresses the worst aspect of the human soul; petty and willfully ignorant hatred for those to whom you are indebted.  Someone spends their days healing and giving to others, so, of course, the human reaction is sullen rage and resentment.  At the same time, the Nac Mac Feegle are in fine form.  Jeannie, the Kelda of the Wee Free Men is growing into her role as their matriarch (and mother to most) of the clan.  Rob Anybody has apparently mastered the hiddlins (secrets) of the explaining, the heart of being husband to the Kelda, but truly lets forth his rage before the tale is told.  And of course, there is always Daft Willie and his pal, Horace the cheese.<br /><br />This one was much darker than Pratchett's other books, cutting straight to what is worst in humanity and hauling it out into the daylight, then on to the fire.  The themes and imagery are very powerful, and should have any reader stopping to think about where this has been seen, and what it is really about.  Without spoilers, there is light at the end, but this is in question at times.<br /><br />Deeply moving and absolutely brilliant.<br /><br />Edward M.

B002ZCY7PU|3.0|I have to say, the episodes are rather unappealing in the beginning.  The relationship between Chuck and Sarah is awkward and nonexistent in the first 5-6 episodes.  Also, there is no humor to be found.  Without Adam Baldwin, this show would struggle.  He's the sole source of comedy here.  Nevertheless, the writing drastically improves towards the last 5-6 episodes.  Although, it is evident that the writers grasped for ideas to transition into season four.  I still love Chuck, but I am hoping season four has much more to offer as far as comedy goes.

B0037QGS0A|2.0|The movie has some interesting moments but the twist is easy to see a mile away and the ending is too contrived. Even though Amanda Seyfried's character is written to be the crazy one, it's really Julianne Moore's character who definitely has the serious issues. Definitely not Julianne Moore or Liam Neeson's best, but it does make you stop to wonder if we are too paranoid at times and not paranoid enough at others. If there is a moral to this movie (not that I think there is one), it's to always be loving to the ones we love. When you neglect them, bad things can happen and bad people can really mess up your life.

0743297334|5.0|The Sun Also Rises  is a fascinating novel. I can't believe I hadn't read it years earlier. The protagonist, Jake Barnes, is a tragic hero of sorts. He was wounded in WW1 and his injuries rendered him impotent.  His injury deeply affected his psyche, and he is insecure about his masculinity as a result. The love of Jake's life is the beautiful Lady Brett Ashley, who cared for him during the war when he was wounded. She is a shallow woman, who cares for Jake, but will not commit to him because sex is very important to her. Instead Lady Brett spends her time with a variety of men. Jake, on the other hand, spends much of his time in Paris with his buddies, each drinking in cafes and wasting their lives.<br /><br />The activities that Jake and his buddies engaged in were really quite sad.  They seemed like they never grew up, but instead their behavior was reflective of their wish to forget the horrors of the war.  They wandered rather aimlessly, a highlight being the fiesta and bullfights in Pamplona where the group engages in more drinking, dancing and debauchery.<br /><br />This book was originally published in 1926, and its strength is definitely the style in which it was written. Hemingway's writing is sharp and insightful, and you feel every detail: the sight, sounds, the place. The characters, although flawed were sympathetic. I loved how he got into the psyche of the characters, helping the reader feel what their life was like, and why they made some of the decisions they did.  I thought it was rather ironic that the title, \\"The Sun Also Rises\\", which to me symbolizes a new dawn, a new day, really had no significance for Jake and the other characters in this novel. Rather they never moved on with their lives, stuck in time, as a result of the past. Hemingway seemed to truly understand the struggles and challenges that life handed his characters, and for that matter -- each of us. Some individuals are made stronger by adversity, but others are not. In the end though,  we rarely get everything we want in life  -- do we?<br /><br />A Brilliant novel - Don't Miss It!get everything we want in life  -- do we?    A Brilliant novel - Don't Miss It!

B003VWC4AI|4.0|I am still reading through The Element, but Ken Robinson has already had me underlining, circling and nodding-while-reading at the many wonderful annecdotes and stories that he has to offer. His thoughts on intelligence and education are very refreshing and speak a lot to the full capacity of individuals; not just what happens to be appreciated in one culture or another. Also, the many biographical stories found in this book---walking through the lives of many famous creative and intellectual minds---is one of the most effective ways that Robinson could hope to inspire people reading this book to go out and find what they love, and do that, whether through hobby or career. You will really \\"get to know\\" many of the people talked about as you walk through the days of their lives when they had a passion for something, like we all do, but with none of the proven success and most of the doubt that we all face when putting ourselves out there, doing something that we love. A wonderful and inspiring book that I am excited to finish!
0439023491|2.0|Rave reviews have a kind of magnetism that pull you in, and while I never liked the general synopsis of the story, the accolades stirred my intrigue and I eventually bought The Hunger Games.<br /><br />A few pages into the first book and I could see what all the raves were about.  The first book was a totally captivating story (even though disturbing!) with so much promise.  For one thing, Katniss had all the makings of a first class heroine.  I'd say my greatest disappointment with the second book, Catching Fire, is that all the promise of who Katniss could have evolved into as a truly unforgettable and admired character began to fizzle out.  This was very disappointing.  The author seemed more intent on outdoing the evil she conjured up in the first book rather than developing depth to her main characters.<br /><br />We readers can develop an amazing tolerance for brutal, evil scenarios as long as the hope of goodness prevailing over that evil stays alive and well in the backs of our minds.  In Catching Fire, you start to suspect that the author isn't on board with that theme.  The compassion, altruistic sacrifice, unexpected kindnesses, and real acts of love in the first book was the right balance to the nightmarish scenes.  That balance is far less present in the second book, and without that balance, the story devolves into a deeply disturbing rehash of the terror of \\"the hunger games\\".  I sure wanted the \\"good\\" in the first book to really \\"catch fire\\" and take off in the second, but in book two, the Light fades and the Dark just gets more depressing.  The reader spends more time wanting to shiver away the horrific images because the author isn't doing that for you anymore.<br /><br />I have jumped ahead and read the reviews to Mockingjay.  I won't bother buying that one.

0385732554|4.0|Kelsey Cosentino  Basking Ridge, NJ  Virtual High School   The Giver by Lois Lowry is about a young boy living in what seems to be a perfect world with no flaws or anything that could ever hinder the sanctity of the community. The protagonist, Jonas, is about to turn twelve and receive his predetermined career, as everyone else in the community has everything chosen and decided for them. Jonas is selected to be the next Receiver of Memory, which is to be transferred to him by the Giver.  It is then that Jonas begins to understand the truth about the world outside of his \\"perfect\\" circle. It is also then that he learns that there is something terribly wrong going on in his community and it is up to him to make the biggest change of all of their lives.    I am a high school senior and I have read this story twice in my career as a student. It's a very quick read, although a truly excellent one. The story is strange and completely original. The plot is constructed well from beginning to end, which I especially enjoyed because it was extremely thought-provoking. The end can be interpreted in several different ways, which is something that I personally look for in novels. I prefer stories that will keep me thinking about them long after I have finished them and The Giver was a great novel for just that, as my mother and I still debate over what ultimately became of the protagonist. However, because it is written for young adults, the actual writing and grammar can be a little weak at times for older students or avid readers. But as I said, what The Giver lacks in grammar it makes up for in content, as Lowry combines a common scene with a very uncommon situation, to create an air of folklore that is not to be matched for what could be a very long time.
B003ZSI9YI|4.0|It has been a long while since Phil Collins released a record. Eight years ago, he released Testify, and happily in tune with his wife, Orianne, and they had 2 beautiful children together. But the past few years had a set of heartbreaks for Phil, including a heartbreaking divorce with his wife and he had a injury that nearly cost Phil his ability to play the drums for the rest of his life. Thankfully, he was able to beat his odds, and he still showed his ability to deliver as a driven, with a reunion tour with Genesis back in 2006 and through 2007 and the groups' long-awaited induction into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame, after nearly 40 years of highs & lows. But for Phil's solo work, he had been away from making anything new for his die hard fans. Phil said he wanted to make a covers' record, and he managed to make a good one.<br /><br />Going Back (Deluxe Edition), Phil Collins' first solo album in eight years, bring in a more authentic classic era of Motown R&B, classic 60's style Soul, and a intimate sound that feels like it is authentic, and not watered down, unlike other recent cover albums from Barry Manilow (The Greatest Love Songs Of All Time) and Rod Stewart (Soulbook.) It feels like a really bright treat, unlike some other artists who've tried to do the same thing, where it feels like you've wasted your time, and wasted money from your pocket. The collection of songs deliver from the title track Going Back, to (Love Is Like A) Heatwave, all the way to You've Been Cheatin', to the intimate Never Dreamed You'd Leave In Summer. Every track feels like you're actually feeling that classic era well. Some of those songs also click through Phil well, which inspired him to make some of his classic hits during his solo greats era in the 80's like Two Hearts (Buster Soundtrack, 1988) and If Leavin' You Is Easy (Face Value, 1981.) I was absolutely amazed at the sound, it feels like a great trip down memory lane classic days of Malt Shops & 50's sock hop dances.<br /><br />All in all, while there are other covers' albums out from Barry Manilow and Santana that've been wastes of time, Phil Collins' Going Back is a great buy for your money. While it might not appeal to those who're new to Phil Collins' classic voice and his music, or those who're just sick and tired of weak covers' records, as it might appeal better to his die hard fans of Phil Collins fans. I was absolutely amazed when I heard the albums songs earlier this year and I thought it was going to be a better album, and I really was right. I absolutely recommend this album as a nice buy for die hard Phil Collins fans', or for anyone who desires the classic authentic days of what soul music sounded like back in the 60's and 50's. Phil proved he was going back, and did it well.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B+<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Mastering: A-<br /><br />Overall: B+while there are other covers' albums out from Barry Manilow and Santana that've been wastes of time, Phil Collins' Going Back is a great buy for your money.

B003ZK58WM|1.0|Clearly this is a \\"greed play\\" by Penguin... If you can produce and sell a 1000-page hard cover book for $19.xx and make money, but you make a concious business decision to charge slightly more for the Kindle version, it is a \\"let's gouge the consumer decision\\" rather than a decision to price based on cost.  I'll pass on this purchase... and anything else Penguin publishes.
B003YUC2FE|4.0|No point in selling telling you about the movies themselves. Unless you have been living under a rock for the past couple decades you already know, or seen for yourself, these classics. Each of the three Toy Story films have or will have their own separate Blu-Ray release with a second disk in standard DVD format. So the big question is what else are you getting on this combo pack. Let me give the low down.     For one this trilogy combo pack will essentially be cheaper to get than buying the three movies separately. This is a very good thing for those of you who do not have any Toy Story Blu-Rays as this means you're coming out ahead of the rest of us who bought them separate. Also everybody's favorite talking point on this release is the inclusion of a digital copy for playing on your portables, a feature not included in the separate releases. So is that all the benefits of getting this package? Well you get a cheesy little carrying case that is pictured above, but that's pretty much it.     That's right ladies and gentlemen. No exclusive content. Three disks for each movies (Blu-Ray, DVD and Digital copy) along with a tenth disk that is likely the same supplemental disk that's included in the Toy Story 3 Blu-Ray. If you are looking for a collector's set with never-before seen footage, featurettes, outtakes, alternate endings and whatnot you won't find it here. However if you don't have any of the previous disks you will get a pretty sweet price, and for those moaning about digital copies you will get that too. Oh yeah... and the toy box \\"collector's\\" case.

143350393X|4.0|I just received my ESV Study Bible. I was hesitant to purchase when I saw people complaining about the blurry pages. But I really wanted this study Bible so I thought I'd give it a shot anyway. I took another purchaser's advice and flipped through all the pages as soon as I got it. All was well until I got to Hosea and Amos. Yep, the print was certainly different. I couldn't decide if it was really blurry or a different font at first. It looks like the letters are either in bold type or shadowed. I decided to keep the book because it really is overflowing with study helps. I figure that Hosea and Amos aren't books that are heavily referenced so I can deal with the type issue. It is readable - just distracting. I've posted pictures of the two different pages in the \\"customer images\\" section so you can see it and judge for yourself. Even with the QC issue I would still recommend taking a chance on this Bible. Well worth the price which from Amazon was about a 40% markdown.
B0037TRVD0|5.0|I have been a fan of the ISB since this album came out over 40 years ago.  Recently, I have been buying up all the CDs of their albums (only Hard Rope and Silken Twine seems to be currently out of print)and playing them over and over.  Hangman's Beautiful Daughter was their finest achievement and my favorite recording of all time.  The songwriting, singing performances, choice of instrumentation seem as outrageously creative today as they did in the 60s.  The stretch of music on side two (of the original lp)from Waltz of the New Moon through Swift as the Wind blows me away every time I hear it.  There will never be another band as innovative.  While other fans feel they lost their mojo after Wee Tam/ Big Huge (including their producer Joe Boyd), I thought they made important music throughout their career and well into their solo careers.  I am glad I got to see the band on several occasions as well as Williamson in later years.  No music has ever moved me or influenced me more than the ISB.
0452289963|1.0|If you are a beginner in your spiritual path, this book might be ok but for most this will be a big waste of time. He spends the first half of the book talking about ego (could have done it in a few pages) and the second half he rewrote most of his points from the Power of Now. He gave Oprah a small % and the they are both taking advantage of the poor reader. My sugestion is buy Infinite Self 33 steps and the Power of Now and you will be very happy with both.
030745455X|1.0|In the sequel to \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\", Steig Larsson pulls out all the stops.  He employs every trite and sensational ploy in the dime novelist's bag.  This is a great novel to read whilst awaiting a tardy airplane flight, but is otherwise literary trash material.<br /><br />First, let's examine Larsson's heroine, Lisbeth Salander.  She is a genius computer hacker (self-trained, of course).  She is an expert in financial chicanery (able to successfully pilfer vast sums of cash by computer transfer and set up hidden, overseas accounts).  She is a master of derring-do (she fearlessly and violently confronts any perceived attacker or threat).  She maintains her composure and \\"screw you\\" attitude in situations of extreme stress (she expertly disables two \\"one percenter\\" bikers).  She has trademark idiosyncracies (de rigueur lesbian/bisexuality, punk affectations).  She also seems to be a weapons expert, carefully noting that her purloined Polish Wanad is correctly loaded with 9mm Makarov ammo.  To top all that off, she is a sophisticated, first-rank, mathematician (apparently devising a novel and non-computer-based solution to Fermat's \\"Last Theorem\\" whilst simultaneously executing an attack on her vile opponents).  She's a boxer (\\"Floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee\\", yes she does!). Well, Lisbeth is just Wonder Woman in a fresh new guise!<br /><br />Next, her current major adversary, the nefarious Alexander Zalachenko.  This dastardly villain is a political defector from the former USSR and, to top that off, was a high-ranking officer in Military Intelligence.  He even (gasp!) killed people in the course of his GRU career.  The Swedish Security Police (another convenient foil) chose for realpolitik reasons, to provide Zala with a cover identity and extricate him from the \\"awkward\\" situations he sometimes created for himself.  One of these involved Salander;  hence his appearance in this tale.  He is Evil Personified, especially as he is an Exploiter of Women (!!).  This alone is capable of arousing the vigilante justice streak in Salander's personality (Charles Bronson revenge movie debt here?).  He seems to resemble the Mister Big character from Rocky and Bullwinkle:  a dastardly devil guiding Boris and Natasha but rarely seen.<br /><br />Third, the Villain's Muscle:  \\"The Blond Giant, BG\\" (real name revealed later on in the book) is a shameless reprise of Rocky Balboa's nemisis, Ivan Drago...right out of central casting.  Larsson owes an acknowledgement to Dolph Lundgren, whose measurements (Lundgren stood at 196 centimetres and weighed 111.5 kilograms) he picked right off Dolph's CV.  Of course, BG has a congenital insensitivity to pain which enables him to withstand a full-on Taser blast (which incapacitates due to neuromuscular paralysis, not pain, a fact evidently unknown to the otherwise weapons-scrupulous Larsson).<br /><br />Finally, the supporting characters.  Many of these were imported stock items from the first installment in the series.  Larsson devotes many words to explaining their reprise in the course of the novel.  Larsson himself appears in a semi-biographical role as Kalle Blomkvist, a journalist with NPR sensitivities in both real-life and in the book.  Naturally, the entire book is primed for...a sequel!!<br /><br />The plot itself has some clever contrivances.  The book reads swiftly, as there are few (well, none) lapidary sentences to linger over.  On a gradient of \\"good bad books\\", this one ranks relatively high on the scale for plot and near the bottom for reliance on pandering to current reading tastes.  The characterizations are simply pathetic.<br /><br />To sum up, this book, just like its predecessor, make for great airport reading or filling time on a boring evening.  They will not, however, enter the detective fiction pantheon as exemplars of the genre. Oh, one more thing:  if you like product placement, you'll just love this book!(!!).

B00168OINK|5.0|My family rented this movie first, worried that it wasn't going to be any good, but boy were we surprised!  This movie is great, and on Blu-ray it looks great too!  Great storyline, and an all around great movie!  My son loves it, and honestly so do my husband and I.  If you haven't seen it, you should!
B000002UAR|4.0|By far my most favourite Beatle's album.  The individual styles of the Fab Four shine through here.  Here are my thoughts on each track:     Taxman - Revealing George's tongue and cheek insight into the mind of the taxman, as he looks for every opportunity to tax you.     Eleanor Rigby - Paul did not base this song on a real individual, but years later there was a head stone found in England with the name Eleanor Rigby on it!  Ah - those strings!  They give the song an air of darkness, and the fast paced music style indicates to me that Paul was hurriedly desperate to get his message across.  For me, Paul's delivery succeeds in translating a great sadness and emptiness in the lives of Eleanor Rigby and Father McKenzie.  I assume they both symbolise lonely people of the times as he saw it.     I'm Only Sleeping - I would like to believe that this is John's chilled out description of how he feels when he dreams.  I often find when my dream reaches a crescendo, I am rudely awakened by my alarm clock.  My favourite line is \\"Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping.\\"  That's what I would be thinking every Saturday before noon.     Love to you - The lyrics are joyously layered with the generous use of the sitar.  George Harrison led the way in incorporating classical music in a pop song.     Here, there and everywhere - A simple, melodic love song.  My favourite line \\"If she's beside me, I know I need never care\\".  It gives me as the listener confidence that they can find such security in love.      Yellow Submarine - Paul wrote this very happy tune.  There are no deep hidden meanings in the lyrics as Paul said that he originally wrote it as a children's song.  Apparently the special effects cupboard was raided for the sound effects.     She said She Said - These words were uttered to John by Peter Fonda while they were on an acid trip.  The nonsensical lyrics along with the hypnotic quality of the music capture this moment.       Good Day Sunshine -  A song with old styleinfluence reminiscent of vaudeville times which produced a happy vibe.  Trivia - It was played as the wake-up music on multiple space shuttle missions.     And your bird can sing - A hard edged rocking song that was rumored to be an ode to Mick Jagger's 'bird' at the time, Marianne Faithful.     For no one - There is no love left in this break-up song.  Paul's lyrics help me to visualise a couple facing each other before going their separate ways, eyes tired from tears.     Doctor Robert - A dubious character, pushing his 'remedies'.  If you visit him, your life might feel momentarily better.  I suspect the lads from the Beatles have known many Doctor Robert's over the years.       I want to tell you - George has the best intention of telling his listener all he wants to say, but his thoughts are all jumbled.  He is so full of emotion he is finding it hard to put them into words. The continuous piano chord in the background and the contrasts between harmonies gives voice to his inner conflicts.     Got to get you into my life - In Barry Miles' 1997 book Paul McCartney: Many Years from Now, McCartney disclosed that the song was about marijuana.[2] \\"'Got to Get You into My Life' was one I wrote when I had first been introduced to pot... So [it's] really a song about that, it's not to a person.\\"[2] Many lyrics from the song suggest this: \\"I took a ride I didn't know what I would find there / Another road where maybe I could see some other kind of mind there.\\",'\\"What can I do, what can I be when I'm with you I want to stay there / If I am true I will never leave and if I do I know the way there.\\"  Now I am disappointed.  I thought it was a song about falling in love at first sight with another human.  Oh well.  A great, attention grabbing track.      Tomorrow never knows - The last song on Revolver written by John.  A truly psychedelic experience featuring Ringo's irregular drum pattern, double tracking and the lines 'when in doubt relax, turn off you mind, float downstream.  Possibly an ode to their love of meditation.     I highly recommend you add this CD to your collection.  Thanks to Stephen.M.R for introducing me to this album.
0525951652|1.0|Ken Follett's books have been good reads but in addition to the high price of \\"Fall of Giants\\" I don't think it is as entertaining as the previous books. The publisher is just out to rip off customers for all they are worth charging $20. Their business model is akin to Wall Street's.     I like the Kindle for PC application as we travel the far west performing volunteer work on state and federal public lands. There is no room for a paper library in the camper and I'm concerned about all the trees that are cut that go to print books and other materials that are thrown out, often never having been read. $7 to $9 for an e book is acceptable but $20? I don't think so ever again. Jim & Pippin [[ASIN:B003ZK58WM Fall of Giants]]

0525951652|5.0|Ken Follett is an engaing writer who has continued to keep us engaged with his latest novel. I disagree with the one-star reviewers.

B003ZPCW0S|5.0|My daughter insisted I listen to the audio before I saw the movie.  I enjoyed the audio SO much that I can't stop listening to it... I had to buy the book.  Not only is it a fascinating story, it is inspirational.  I won't detail the steps here, but I have a new found peace as a result of contemplating the principals set forth in this book.  I'm recommending it to all my friends.  (Unfortunately the movie didn't do the book justice... what's new? But I think the movie would have been difficult to follow without reading the book first.)
B00127RAJY|5.0|Seven months ago, I was 40-50 pounds overweight, with a 50th birthday looming. I'd spent 1000+ $$ and many hours on gym memberships, and lost not an inch or an ounce.  I had given up and become a total couch potato for over a year.  Then I go to Wal-Mart, and in desperation, pick up the Jillian Michaels 30-Day Shred for $9.98.  I force myself through workout level 1 and can barely move (literally!) for three days.  But that birthday is still looming...  So back to the Shred video, this time taking it a little easier. I loved Jillian's style--smart and sassy, not cute and annoying like so many others.     Within just a couple weeks, things started tightening and firming up; my clothes got looser.  I stayed on level one for months, and combined the workout with a better style of eating (lots more veggies and salads, occasional green smoothies; avoiding gluten since I think I may be sensitive) and by mid-June, I had gone from 178 to a fit 138, for a total loss of 40 lbs.  Mind you, I still ate my fill of dark chocolate every day, and never felt deprived at all.  If I occasionally fell off the wagon, I just climbed back on and started again. By the way, I never have gotten used to the level 3 workout, so you can tell I'm not some naturally buff athlete, just a formerly overweight mom of 7.    This DVD works, people!  I can hardly believe the changes in my body since February. I feel like a teenager again, and people tell me I look fantastic. I've never been a fitness-DVD fan, though I've tried many, but Jillian's style just really motivates me.  I roll out of bed, get dressed and do the workout right in my bedroom.  The best part is I've formed new habits that are permanent; I have NO DESIRE to go back to my couch potato/junk food lifestyle ever again.  I feel like a completely different person now.    Don't listen to the nay-sayers; you can do this at any age, and your body will respond big-time. Going from a size 16-18 pants to a size 6-8 proved to me that we really can re-invent ourselves.  Next week, this former couch potato is running a 5K race at 50 years old.  Oh, yeah!!  Thank you, Jillian! :-)
B002L3RVCY|5.0|The Clone Wars Season One answers some of the questions the main movies leave hanging (between #2 and #3). In the motion pictures the viewer skips from the start of the Clone Wars to full blown battles wrapping up (and the beginning of the Empire).<br />When you watch the Clone Wars from the perspective of \\"what happened in between\\" you begin to see the relationships Anakin has with the other Jedi. The loyalties and bonding between Clone troops and their Jedi commanders. Take that to motion picture #3 and the betrayal is... worse.
B003UERZ88|5.0|Made of Metal has a variety of different styles and tempos of Heavy Metal songs all on one CD. Rob Halford is called the Metal God because he has decades singing all styles of Heavy Metal and Made of Metal is filled 14 awesome Heavy Metal songs. Made of Metal has Judas Priest type songs with Fire and Ice & Hell Razor, 25 years is a ballad. A couple of songs have hints of Iron Maiden with Undisputed & Like their's no tomorrow. The Mower is an extreme metal song. Matador is a latin influenced heavy song. Made of Metal has Rob's best vocals of all his solo projects. Rob sings on MOM like he sings for Judas Priest. Rob sounds different and very unquie on every MOM song. Buy Made of Metal and give it few listens and you will be writing your own 5 star Amazon review.

B00080Z53O|5.0|With the talents of Director Amenabar and actor Javier Bardem, this movie was undoubtebly going to be at the very least, good.  I was initially not too excited about the subject matter of a quadraplegic wishing to end his life, etc.  But within minutes of watching, I was captivated by the beauty of of this movie seems to celebrate the gift of life more thn anything I've seen in recent years.  Of particular note is the cinematography - for the mostpart, this movie is set in the confines of the main characters bedroom or the local village.  However, on certain ocassions, there are some very tasteful 'dream/fantasy sequences' where Bardem imagines himself flying out of the window, over the Galician hills, to the bright blue sea where he is walking again on the beach.  The way it comes out is seemless and adds a depth to this movie yet the movie in no way, ever requests your sympathy and carefully sticks to the path of telling a balanced view on  the whole 'right to die' situation.  Watch this Movie!!!

B0036EH3WK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed watching this series over the past six years and this set, especially on Blu-Ray, is the best way to own and re-watch this show. For those who have not seen it before, I strongly recommend it though it will not appeal to all. It is best to be watched with other friends who haven't seen it so you can share in your thoughts and theories over the course of the show. This show will be thoroughly missed and this set, complete with the entire series, great featurettes and commentaries, a lew of other extras, and some of the coolest packaging in a box set ever make it well worth the higher price point. Hope you enjoy it as much as I!

B003XX2PD6|5.0|Halcyon Digest is simply a beautiful album.  The production is lush and detailed, which compliments the band's more dreampop-leaning sound on this album perfectly.  This is more of a pop album than Cryptograms or Microcastle, and only one song (\\"Desire Lines\\") features one of Deerhunter's characteristic guitar drone/jam-outs.  That said, the songwriting here is mature and tight, and there is at most one song on this album that's skip-worthy.  In my view, the second half is stronger than the first, but this is a solid listen all the way through and will likely be one of my top albums of the year.  Top songs:  \\"Fountain Stairs,\\" \\"Desire Lines,\\" \\"Helicopter,\\" \\"Coronado.\\"
0743298039|5.0|I loved this book, it is a well written, compelling tale.  It was hard to put down and I didn't want it to end. Well developed characters, a wonderful sense of place and a touch of mystery throughout. Highly recommended!
0446310786|5.0|I'm sure I read this book a long time ago, but I had forgotten the story.  It was a delight to read it again and to be reminded of what life was like when I was a child....the things we talked about, the ways we reacted to things, etc.  This time, it was really hard to put it down at night and go to bed!    The main theme of the book was the somber truth, though, and just a terribly sad part of our history.      I highly recommend this to anybody, whether you read it 40 years ago or not.
B0031ESIZQ|5.0|This game is a lot better than RCT 2. There is so much more you can do and build. There is a mode called Sandbox mode where you have unlimited cash and you have all the rides unlocked. The only con in this game is that the size of the land you get is not that big. Yes you can fit a lot of rides but not enough.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|First off, let me go ahead and say, The Town is one of the best movies of the year. If that's all you wanted to know, have a nice day. Otherwise, continue on my friend.<br /><br />I have said it hundreds of times, rather than spell out the plot I prefer to tell you about my experience and feelings about the film. Let's face it - it's a bore to cipher through reviews only to re-read the same material over and over.<br /><br />The Town is Ben (Gigi) Affleck's second attempt at helming a film, and boy does he succeed. As everyone knows (including Affleck himself, I'm sure) Ol' Ben has been taking heat for his recent choices at the flicker show. Some say it started moments after the final reel of Good Will Hunting had spun. Some say he was doomed once Armageddon entered the scene. I don't know, but I have personally never had a problem with his performances as much as the films themselves. He has been in some doozies, which makes The Town that much more surprising.<br /><br />I loved the movie. The characters are realistic and strong. The plot is thick and believable. There are moments that I couldn't believe I was seeing, as they harkened back to Hitchcock. If you have seen it, I will only say: Tattoo.<br /><br />Ben Affleck definitely has his team to thank, but after doing some research I found that he himself may be the reason for the impact of many of the character driven scenes. He told his fellow actors to take the lines they were given, and use improvisation to bookend the lines. This worked extremely well. Instead of the usual cookie cutter deliveries typically found in a film like this, we have a series of smooth real-life conversations that play at a pitch perfect level throughout. The characters seem like they know each other, and speak as if they have history together. And then there is the cool Dark Knight vibe...<br /><br />There are many scenes that I would love to discuss in detail, but unfortunately I would be considered a jerk to those who haven't seen it. Trust me, though the whole film is great, there are five or more scenes specifically that I could write a hundred pages about. Once you've seen it, you'll probably know what I am referring to.<br /><br />Suspense is a big word and it's hard to find, at least in movies churned out these days. You'll find it here, drawn out tremendously and then kicked up again. I haven't held my breath during a movie in a long while. When you care about the characters, even when they are villains, it's a natural response... Hollywood, ahem.<br /><br />In closing, go and see it. Good movies need to be supported, and I for one am looking forward to next Affleckian projecto.<br /><br />The Town is why I go the movies. `Nuff said.great, there are five or more scenes specifically that I could write a hundred pages about.

B003YBNRHU|4.0|In this world today of Rock & Roll, this music is a \\"Breath of Fresh Air\\", so many bands simply stay the course and their music stays the same, this is a really good cd of new music by the Doobies. I was surprised it was this good, it is a must for good music listeners & not just Doobie fans. Love it!!!!!!!!!!
1427210497|3.0|I found this book beautifully written, elegantly paced but totally depressing. I am having to read it in sections as to not overload the negative input at a given time.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I purchased this workout DVD after I had my second baby. I did read ALL of the reviews before purchase and majority are true.    Not really realistic.! Routines can be deemed as elementary but they are very basic and anyone can do them. But it gets boring by the second day.    ALSO, if you're expecting to shed pounds in 30 days...she doesn't mention anything about what to eat or not to eat? Of course use common sense but it would be nice to mention SOMETHING!
B003Y5H4SO|3.0|M. Knight Shyamalan makes a slight return to his game in the claustrophobic suspense film, \\"Devil.\\" It's not really a horror film as much a tightly wound whodunnit, with five people trapped in an elevator being killed off one by one, as two cops and two building supervisors watch from outside. The film plays it minimally, with the scares coming from surprise and not from gore.<br /><br />That's to \\"Devil's\\" benefit. In fact, the opening credits alone are enough to disorient you, as a fast moving something zeroes in on Philadelphia and the building are soon to be devil-meeters, almost all of them only slightly known actors.<br /><br />Shyamalan wrote the script as part of a \\"Night Chronicles\\" series, with brothers  John Erick Dowdle and Drew Dowdle directing, which is also to the film's benefit. Trimmed down to a fast 90 minutes, no time or space is wasted (even if the ending becomes predictable as it approaches). It makes the potential for more of the chronicles promising.
B000001FOL|1.0|I have a great respect for all music and while I don't like all music, I rarely write a negative review because music is subjective and personal HOWEVER this is not music as know it.<br />I like to play pool but I know I'm not very good at it.<br />It's not a crime for me to record a video of my average at best pool playing and put it on the web. So ... in this respect Nico commits no crime here BUT these reviews are a forum for people to share their opinions and for folks that are searching for a type of music they may like - to find it and the reviews are one point of consideration to use prior to purchasing. Of course, amazon is great in that you can sample a bit of most albums before purchasing and make your own decision. So, that said, here is my opinion - unless you want a very specific mood setting (not saying what mood mind you) collection of music, unless your ear is tuned to accept other than \\"western\\" tonalities, look elsewhere. This album really points out the lack of talent by virtue of the covering of songs by other artists you may well know. If you don't, I suggest you seek them out instead - such as Jackson Browne's original version of These Days which is a beautiful, haunting reflective piece of music.<br />To the less than one tenth of one percent that may well enjoy this album and Nico's brand of whatever it is she is doing - enjoy. For the rest of us, we will continue to wonder about all the great music out there that can't get a record deal!
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Wizards, castles, magic...add in two easy on the eyes main characters and it's a romantic, action adventure with a devious villian. I am looking forward to the second series.
0545123275|4.0|I became a fan of the sort of fantasy literature aimed at young adults but intriguing to older audiences as well through \\"The Golden Compass\\" trilogy.  \\"The Hunger Games\\" trilogy recently caught my fancy--at least the first two books out of three, so I was eager to read \\"Shiver\\" and perhaps on to \\"Linger\\" later.<br /><br />This book, however, more than any of the others, struck me as more appropriate for a far younger reader than I.  Still, there is much to appreciate in the prose and dialogue of this skillful author, and the way in which she carries off a most fanciful plot with ease.  She certainly captures young lust/love in an appealing and accurate way; anyone who is or has been a teenager can believe that raging hormones can induce a feral state, so why not take it all the way unto physical transformations? There's a bit of werewolf in most adolescents from puberty on--I just didn't appreciate how much until I read Ms. Stiefvater's book. Her description of the pleasures of aromas from a wolf-girl's point of view reminded me of an account written by Oliver Sacks of the effects of stimulants on the olfactory sense.  What a lupine pleasure that must be, surely shared by the teen couples I see looped about one another, noses buried in one another's neck and hair.<br /><br />A very entertaining read, but I'm skipping \\"Linger\\" as I've had enough of the \\"I was a teenage werewolf\\" genre for now.
0312356854|5.0|This book is deep,enlightening, captivating, and depressing as heck but will keep you reading to the end.  If you need a book that is written very well and you can handle major travesties, READ THIS BOOK.
0525951652|5.0|I enjoy everything Ken Follett has written, including this book.  I came here to read the reviews posted by others and was shocked to see this book ranking so low.  Then I realized people were judging Ken Follett's latest work based on the price set for the ebook by his publisher.  How ridiculous is that?  I couldn't imagine being in a job where my job review was based on my boss' performance.    You don't want to pay $20 for a kindle edition?  Fine, that is your right.  BUT, please don't judge Follett's book on ebook price.  Judge the book on its merit.
0811876373|5.0|I love her and I love this book.  My first attempt at cake pops failed miserably when i was being impatient and half following the instructions on bakerella's blog.  But, having this book in front of me for my next attempt results in adorable, and delicious cake pops!  The pics of all her creations are so cute- I want to attempt each one!
0525951652|1.0|Let me start by explaining I absolutely loathe the fact that I am giving a book I have not read a poor \\"review\\". Publishers like Penguin are greedy and deserve the backlash they are getting from the ebook community.  This review is a reflection of you, not the author.  I will not pay $20 for a book download, neither will I download it illegally like people are suggesting. Publishers need to take note of the way the music industry changed and even more recently the movie rental industry.  Consumers want their entertainment at their fingertips (downloads) but they also are not going to pay more money for that convenience. Both the music and movie industries are a perfect example of this. I expect this price war in the ebook market to change soon. In the meantime, I'll continue to download books that are $9.99 or less.  Thanks Amazon for sticking up for the consumers as much as you do!
B003Y3BMFW|5.0|Sure, it's basically a greatest hits album plus a bunch of live performances and alternate versions,  but the bonus music videos on the DVD makes this a great, great buy for any fan - most will recognize the classic videos for Black Hole Sun and Fell On Black Days, but note that 13 of the 20 music videos are previously unreleased, and IMO it makes this album a worthwhile buy.<br /><br />They look really dated, yes, probably because of the 4:3 aspect ratio, and the grainy quality of some of them might be irritating to some. Not to mention three distinct versions of Pretty Noose.... but as a fan of their music, I think it only adds to the immersive experience of reliving the glory days of the band...and my own.<br /><br />Not having owned their A-Sides retrospective, for instance, I'm not qualified to judge that compilation's particular merits. Furthermore,  I'm sure there will be much quibbling over the individual tracks themselves (why the \\"video\\" version of Fell On Black Days instead of the album version, for instance). Still, I think this is overall a great buy for both longtime fans and for people new to Soundgarden's music too.
0066620996|5.0|This book was as good as new. Ordered on a Saturday and arrived at my home on Monday without expedited shipping. This purchase exceeded my expectations in every way (price, product quality, shipping time). Highly recommend.
B000063UR2|5.0|I remember seeing this movie in the theater. It was amazing. I saw it three times in two weeks. I have always wondered why it didn't receive better reviews. This DVD tells me why - the difference between the two versions can be subtle in some places and very apparent in others. I had never seen the version released overseas but I must say it has a different feel; much darker and more appealing, at least to me. I still enjoy the US-released version and have enjoyed watching the two back to back to compare the differences.     This DVD is well worth the money! Buy it today and grab the popcorn.
B001OQCV2O|4.0|The Blu-Ray high definition video quality is excellent and very sharp when watching on an HDTV. The audio quality is very good with no noticeable distortion on my stereo system. The acting and plot is OK. This is a modern Noah's Ark type end of the world movie. The special effects were also good.
B001KVZ6LQ|1.0|I love the original 1933 version of King Kong, and always will. This review is about the Blu-ray transfer and it's complete lack of quality. The horrible, grainy picture makes this wonderful classic film almost unbearable to watch. Especially if the scene takes place when it is dark or in the fog (when they ship out to the island). If the master copy of this film was not in good condition, then they never should have put this out for the public. I find it hard to believe that someone viewed this before production and said \\"Yes,it looks fine! Let's put it out there!\\"   Please remember, some films (especially older classics) for various reasons do not transfer well to Blu-ray. Unfortunately,this is the case with the classic King Kong.
1881273873|5.0|A must have for all single people. Teaches you how to be a  better friend.
0312600844|5.0|Though I'm not done with this book, I find it to be more like a revelation than actually reading a book.  I am disturbed and find myself thinking about these people as they would fit into my own life.  I know and understand these characters.  I have thought these thoughts and felt these feelings as a result of how Franzen builds this story and conducts the dialogue.    I find this hard to criticize as actual fiction because I find this book so interesting and disturbing.  As a fan of music, I consider this book to be the equivalent of a great classic album.  There are weaker parts, but they are part of a whole that is part of your life.  If this were a Rolling Stones album, it would be exile on Main Street or OK Computer by Radiohead.  I think that this book will have substantial social impact.
0525951652|1.0|The cost of digital versions should represent a savings, not an increase over a printed copy. How greedy can you get?
B00005JPS8|4.0|Robert Downey Jr., Jeff Bridges and Gwyneth Paltrow<br />star in this 2008 action film based on the comic book.<br />A billionaire playboy turns hero after creating a super-<br />genetic suit of armor. Robert is great in this as usual<br />and this 2-disc set has nice picture and sound plus<br />neat extras. I recommend this good comic book film.
0143037757|4.0|This is the first post wwII history of Europe I have read. I am only to chapter 5 because the print is so small that I get tired reading. (I am 71 and need readers). The book is very enlightening to someone who was born in the US in 1939 and lived through the Cold War period in the military. It helped me understand why Europe and particularly France seemed so unconnected to US foreign policy. I fear the revelations I enjoyed may be wasted upon the young!
B002WIDRM6|2.0|I am thoroughly disappointed with this album. Lady Antebellum seem energetic on TV but half the songs featured here are sooooo boring; they lack real energy and fervor and are too soppy for my liking. The best song on here is the gorgeous and uptempo \\"Run to You\\", which ironically is a bonus track! What a disappointment!
0312370849|4.0|This is a really great book. It's so different from the types of books I've been reading. I found the writing style to be inventive and refreshing. The subject matter is hard and deep, but presented in a respectful and thoughtful way.<br /><br />The story centers on the rounding up, imprisonment and execution of French Jews in 1942. Are you thinking, \\"What imprisonment of French Jews?\\" you're not alone. It seems that this \\"incident\\" was swept under the rug until President Jacques Chirac apologized for it in 1995. Apparently of the 42,000 French Jews sent to Auschwitz in 1942, only 811 survived.<br /><br />The story centers around Julia, an American journalist living in Paris, who is assigned an article on the 60th anniversary of the Vel d'Hiv, named for the arena that the French Jews were brought to when they were arrested by French police in the middle of the night. It was from there that they were brought to internment camps and then, eventually, Auschwitz. Julia becomes enthralled by the story and by its coverup in the aftermath. Upon further digging, she realizes that her family's apartment was only available after a Jewish family was taken from it that night. She becomes obsessed with that family and their tragic story.<br /><br />Tangled in Julia's story is the story of the little girl who lived in the apartment. This book is a 2-for-1. You get the first hand narative of being woken by the police, crammed in the Vel d'Hiv for 6 days and the internment. Tragic is the only word I can think of to describe what happened to this poor family. You also get the horror of a person discovering this event for the first time, 60 years later, and the havoc it wreaks on her life. She learns things about her in-laws and herself that draw her closer to some and apart from others.<br /><br />This story is well-written. It's one of those books where you know the author worked really hard to make it come out just right. I don't want to spoil it. Just read it and find out!
1904920209|5.0|After reading \\"Dough\\" I found out it is the book I was looking for long ago to get over the baking barriers I always had in mind. It actually eliminates the fear of handling sticky unmanageable dough through step by step photos and detailed explanation of the technique which helps in enhancing the performance and avoid usual mistakes; i.e. not only ingredients and recipes. The enclosed DVD is part of the useful introduction which shows how Richard himself handles the dough. The book is divided into 5 chapters with a helpful introduction. The introduction introduces you to the essential baking tools, the common ingredients for almost all kinds of dough and the dough handling methods. The 5 chapters are basically divided into 5 dough kinds; White, Olive, Brown, Rye and Sweet. In each chapter the relevant dough is explained first, followed by the bread types derived from it. There is also a couple of supplementary recipes that may be required for stuffing or topping. This makes \\"Dough\\" a real helpful book for baking professionals as well as for beginners. Finally I would like to mention that you need to read the introdution and recipe you intend to start with thoroughly before you start, in order to be well prepared, furnished with necessary tools and required space and have developed a sequence of work in mind.   Enjoy baking with Richard.
B003MZ0I84|1.0|This is just as bad as their last effort if not WORSE....and I didn't think it could get any worse.   This album sounds identical to the last ablum....and EVERY song sounds like the last song, this is one boring album. There is no song that I need to hear again (ever for that matter). I gave this band one more chance because I liked their first album.  This is another band that I will need to turn my back on.  It was fun for one album but the last two are so much of the same it has become very stale and boring.  How is this band so popular I just don't get it.    Good Bye Maroon 5 you will not be missed in my world.  If you loved the last album then pick it up it sounds exactly the same, in fact if you liked the last album just listen to that and you wouldn't know the difference.  So If you ask me what I think about this album, I can sum it up easy for you....Stale, Boring, Clone Like, and Lame.
B00005N6KG|4.0|Where to start... I started searching for new headphones when my Skullcandy Titans started dropping sound in one ear. For the most part, I love Skullcandy however, after awhile the plug connection starts to go bad like most headphones. I thought that I would try something new and after finding a $10 Sony headphone, I had to check it out.     Upon opening the package, I was surprised on the design, I thought to myself, how could these possibly offer good sound? The earpieces don't go all the way in your ear like \\"noise canceling\\" earbuds, more like they rest on the bottom of your ear, projecting the sound upward and inward. When I first put them on, the plastic earbuds were slightly uncomfortable, however after a few minutes you don't even notice this anymore. Comparing these to my Skullcandies on noise canceling, they don't really compare, the sound canceling feels more like if you were to put your fingers about half way in your ears. Bass, also doesn't compare to the skullcandies, but its not terrible, bass enthusiasts should look somewhere else. Some people commented that the cord was too short, I can see where they are coming from on this but unless you are 6'5\\"+ I wouldn't worry about them reaching from your head to your pocket. Seeing on how they are $10, they are not very \\"sturdy\\", very light weight, but if you don't abuse your things, you shouldn't have a problem with this.     Over all, for $10, these headphones amazed me with sound quality and comfortability. After a few minutes of walking my dog, I didn't really notice the difference between them and my $50 skullcandies. If you aren't willing to shell out much cash for headphones, these are the best deal for the money by FAR.

B003ZK58WM|1.0|I am a huge Ken Follett fan, but I will be damned if I am going to pay $19.99 to purchase the Kindle edition. This is a classic example of greed by Dutton/Penquin.   They have zero distribution and zero paper costs for the Kindle edition; there is no reason to charge $19.99 for an e-book.   Nothing but total greed.       But the only way these publishers are going to change their practices is if readers DO NOT purchase books at these outrageous prices.   Don't buy the hardcover, don't buy the e-book.   If you can't wait to read Follett's new book, BORROW IT FROM THE LIBRARY.  Just say no to Penguin.     PS And Mr Follett, if you are reading these reviews, you should put pressure on your publisher too!
0312370849|4.0|This book came highly recommended to me by my Aunt and I have to pass on my high recommendations for this book to you all.<br /><br />This novel tells two stories - both set in Paris, France, but 60 years apart. You have the story taking place in 1942 - told through the eyes of a 10 year old child. With this perspective, you are not told everything, but we as the reader can start to put pieces together for a more complete story. In her story the characters do not have names - they are just mother, brother, father, etc. For me, the fact that people were not given names - made this anyone's story; it wasn't necessarily just the story of Sarah and her family's traumatic event, but the story of any of the families affected by the Vel' d'Hiv' roundup.<br /><br />The other story is the 2002 story - this is the story of Julia - an American ex-patriot living in France. She is a journalist and begins writing a story about the Vel' d'Hiv' roundup for the magazine that she works for and becomes so absorbed with the story of this little girl, Sarah. As the novel bounces back and forth between time periods, you can use the information you learn through Julia's research to help understand what is going on in Sarah's story.<br /><br />About half-way through the novel the two stories merge in a shocking way. You learn the names and fates of the characters and at that point it becomes Sarah's story - no longer is it the generic story of any little girl.<br /><br />This is a very sad and traumatic story - you will likely need a few tissues. Although the events are sad, the fact that Julia is doing this research and determined to bring these events back into the minds of the public who have forgotten, is admirable and something that I think should happen more often. If we don't remember, we forget - it's a very straightforward concept. For me, the writing was flawless and the story was so inspirational and taught me a lot.<br /><br />4.5 out of 5 stars.
B0024RI72U|5.0|Blind Guardian's tribute to JRR Tolkien's epic tale \\"The Silmarillion\\" is fantastic! The attention to detail is superb. The depth of the band's musical rendition is to be blunt; AWESOME! I have enjoyed the entire album over and over, and will continue to do so! Perhaps the band might try an essay into The Lord of the Rings(if only!).
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I got this for my husband who has a canon 7D and several lenses.  He loved it!  Said it had a place for everything and was super easy to take on our trip to NYC without being an obvious camera bag.

B000G6BM00|5.0|I love this movie, not just because it's a kick ass thrilling sci-fi movie, which it is, but for the universal human themes it presents. My favorite part is when Ripley is getting ready to go after Newt in the alien's nest. She's scared spitless, but has to suck it up and do it anyway. It exemplifies how ordinary people are capable of extraordinary acts when thrust into impossible situations.
0547258305|4.0|This was a very interesting book - read it all in one sitting while on a long flight.  I think this is a teen book, but I'm an adult reader and found it well written, liked the mystery aspect and of course liked the romantic story.  Looking forward to more books to come about these characters and the 7 kingdoms!
0312600844|2.0|Franzen is a good storyteller for the first two thirds of this longish book. Then its as if he runs out of ideas and resorts to cheap theatrical tricks to wind things up. A very unsatisfying last 150 pages. He does capture the arrogant dismissiveness of the \\"progressive' mindset, but I suppose because of his own political leanings seems incapable of fleshing out characters who deviate from that accepted orthodoxy.     The buffonery of characters Carol, Blake & Linda are the most obvious examples. Since many professional reviewers waxed poetic about this tome and didn't point out this flaw, I assume it is due to their like mindedness to Franzen in the political spectrum. Guess Oprah wouldn't have picked this if she felt it didn't serve her own worldview.    As other readers have mentioned, I heard echoes of Philip Roth although Franzen, most likely due to his age, hasn't developed as acute an eye and ear as Roth.  Ultimately unsatisfying read about characters who may develop some self awareness but then retreat back into their own  microcosmic world rather than moving on beyond their comfort zone.
B000BGH22W|5.0|The adventuresome nature of the soundtrack gets my blood pumping and puts it only slight behind Half-Blood Prince on my list of favorite Harry Potter soundtracks. My favorites songs, in whole, include: The Quidditch World Cup, The Dark Mark, Hogwart's Hymn, and Death of Cedric. I also like most of Golden Egg, the last half of Underwater Secrets, and the last minute or so of Voldemort.
B003UTUQ3E|5.0|I was most intrigued when I found out that Station to Station was receiving a special edition rerelease.  It stands as one of my top three favorite Bowie albums, along with Low and Lodger.  I owned a vinyl RCA copy, and I have the Rykodisc remaster from the Nineties.  Nevertheless, I wanted to hear the new remaster, and I was curious about the Nassau Colisseum show, of which I'd only heard the two tracks released as bonuses on the Ryko cd.    I was by no means disappointed on any counts.  The new remaster, from the original analog, of Station to Station sounds great.  The Nassau concert was a true revelation to me; no wonder it is considered a legendary Bowie show!  The version of \\"Station to Station\\" may be the best I've heard; for all of its coolness, there's a certain fire to this performance.  The laid back cover of \\"Waiting for the Man\\" works well.  \\"Life on Mars?\\" is short, just up to the first chorus, but it segues neatly into \\"Five Years,\\" one of Bowie's all-time greatest songs.  Concert albums do not always impress me.  This one, however, is a monster.    The packaging is good.  I particularly like Cameron Crowe's essay and the making of Station to Station timeline.  If you already own this classic, go ahead and buy this special edition.  You won't be disappointed.  If you've never heard it, what are you waiting for?
B000W796OM|4.0|I don't like the moments of super-Hermione throughout (and the way she throws Harry under Whomping Willow scene defies laws of science--one handed, without his shirt ripping off). Leaving out the Marauders doesn't bother me much, but I would have liked to have the significance of Prongs at least left in. And the CGI werewolf is an eyesore).<br /><br />However, I love Harry's (and Dan's) quiet maturity (and messy hair, ha). I also thought the look, pacing, and transitions of the movie were great; and unlike other people's complaints, I find the ending quite fitting. Prisoner of Azkaban is the Harry Potter DVD I've watched most often.
0375842209|5.0|At first it was hard to get into this book because i was trying to find out who was the narrator, but then once i realized it was \\"death\\" it made it a lot simpler.  What a great book, every time i read a book i wonder if it would make a good movie.  I would read this book again, so i think it would make a hearty movie i would watch.
B000ZECQ08|4.0|Like the book, not much happens action-wise, and Yates didn't help by choosing to take out the skirmish at Hogwarts at the end or have the Death Eaters stroll out of the school (where were the Aurors who were suppose to be providing security?) This made the pacing of the movie seem sluggish at times.<br /><br />Some of the dialogue was also weird and the non-urgency of Hagrid and Snape in the cursed necklace and Sectumsempra scenes, respectively, was off-putting.<br /><br />But the best acting of the young stars (with the exception of Bonnie Wright) can be found here, particularly: Tom Felton, Dan (especially in the Felix Felicis scene), Rupert (with his comedic timing), and Emma (with the canary scene being a highlight). And the soundtrack behind this movie is my favorite.<br /><br />All in all, this is my third favorite Harry Potter movie so far (behind Prisoner of Azkaban and Order of the Phoenix).
1594481717|5.0|Our society's past is littered with the fallout of linear thinking, that is, believing that life is a series of if-then or either-or choices. In this book, Pink outlines the fallacy of this approach as we wend our way through the 21st century. We can no longer rely on left-brained thinking to analyze our way through sticky situations. Despite the subtitle, Pink is actually positing that in order to succeed in today's world, we must combine both brain hemispheres into whole brain thinking. (For those unfamiliar with the brain hemispheres, the left brain is sequential, logical, and analytical, and the right brain is non-linear, intuitive, and holistic.)     Pink's proposition provides another framework for systems thinking. As we move from the information age to the conceptual age (a transformation similar to moving from the industrial age to the information age), those who will be successful will demonstrate high concept (an ability to detect patterns and opportunity, create artistic and emotional beauty, craft a satisfying narrative, and tie unrelated ideas into something new) and high touch (an ability to empathize with others, understand subtleties of human interaction, find joy in one's life and elicit it in others, and to stretch for purpose and meaning). He further defines these two concepts into six essential aptitudes: design, story, sympathy, empathy, play, and meaning.    Pink devotes a chapter to each of these six senses, as he refers to them, and at the end of each chapter, he outlines what he calls a portfolio: a list of resources, exercises, and instruments to help the reader practice each of the six senses. For anyone interested in thinking outside the box or practicing systems thinking, this book is a must read. The audio version, which I listened to, has Pink reading the book, which is extremely effective.
0061998494|5.0|I love Craig Ferguson and picked up this audio book to help on my long drives.  Wow, I was blown away by his honesty and humor.  As Craig took me down the memory lane of his life, I was stunned at the low places that he landed.  He makes no excuses for his behaviors or addictions.  Nor does he play the braggart at conquering them.  He simply tells a story that can make you laugh and can make you cry.  Brutally and hysterically open about his past, Craig Ferguson has made a fan for life out of me.
B001FAZYOQ|4.0|Bowie and the Spiders can beat it, who knows how his other albums would have turned out with them in the studio. To me as much as I like many of the albums and the muscians are good, there is something about the way the Spiders functioned with Bowie, to me a bug mistake in judgement. Anyone can copy someone elses riffs, but the person who originates them ... thats where the skill is. Mike Garson, Woody Woodsmansy, Bolder and Ronson created a much more dangerous sound than his later side kicks, yet some of the acoustic and string support really made this unit effective. Great selection of songs. Bowie still learning to master the stage performance but well worth if you never had a chance to see this band live. Not sure but this is probably where he began to be noticed in the US.

I recommend these cards to any therapists (or parents) looking for activities for their clients. It's a creative way to encourage new skills that the kids truly enjoy!
B000002513|5.0|This is in my opinion the best of all his albums. It seems to me the songs on this album are never as good as this selection. Maybe there was a lot of pressure from the rcord label to perform a certain way as aluded to in Rosalita. Not that the skill aren't there on some of the other albums such Darknes on the Edge of Towm. However this album has some of may favourites and I love the use of acoustic instruments and Springsteens voice, Such as the the interplay of the piano and acoustic guitar on New York City Serenade. The E-Street Shuffle the list goes on and on. Everyone really seems to be adding some dimension to the music. This one is well worth getting.
B000KIE11Q|5.0|i just received the watch today in the mail as a gift from my dad.  i just turned 15.  this is one of the most beautiful watches i have ever bought/received in my life.  the only thing i dont like about the watch is the black rubber going down the middle, it looks kinda weak, i knew that in two years im gonna have to replace the strap. otherwise, its amazing, beautiful, and fits for all occasions
B00005QGAV|5.0|Everybody has \\"Thriller,\\" so I'm not wasting my time doing a review even on its Special Edition. \\"Dangerous,\\" however, is one of the greatest albums I've ever heard in my lifetime, and I own at least 100 CDs. This album sold around 30 million copies, but don't be fooled by it selling less than \\"Thriller\\" and \\"Bad;\\" I think it's better than \\"Thriller,\\" but not quite \\"Bad.\\" The album cover is spectacular; observe it and you notice a few things. The concert in Bucharest that went along with this album was great, although he did less on his tour than \\"Bad.\\" Notice that every album from Jackson ever since \\"Off The Wall\\" starts off with an upbeat hit. There has been an amazing 9 singles released from \\"Dangerous.\\" \\"Jam\\" is what brings this album to life. The lyrics are provided in the booklet like his other albums. This song deals with worldly drama and confusion and survival. \\"Why You Wanna Trip on Me\\" should've been another single; this song talks about general problems with the world, like hunger, corruption, crime, and disease. \\"In The Closet\\" has a great pop beat to it although the lyrics are kinda trivial. I really liked \\"She Drives Me Wild,\\" but it's one of those songs I can't dance to because it has a peculiar rhythm to it. \\"Remember the Time,\\" a single that had a great video, talks about lover's past. \\"Can't Let Her Get Away\\" is a reasonable and motivating song for getting someone who may seem intimidating. \\"Heal the World\\" is definately worth the listen; with it being one of the 9 singles, it talks about peace and togetherness. \\"Black or White,\\" yet another single, had an entertaining video with McCauly McCulkin (sorry if I misspelled his name, but he's the child from \\"Home Alone\\"), was an upbeat song with guitarist Slash from Guns 'N Roses but had trivial lyrics. \\"Who is It\\" was a spectacular number that brings you into a serious mood because the lyrics deal with a lover abruptly leaving another. \\"Give in to Me\\" is the most interesting track on this album, as it has an odd beat that gets hyped with guitar. \\"Will You Be There\\" from Free Willy 2 is another single with a slow beat that may make you sad but the lyrics are great. \\"Keep the Faith\\" isn't as sad as the previous track but again has outstanding lyrics about hope. \\"Gone Too Soon\\" is the saddest single on \\"Dangerous;\\" it seemed like it was inspired by a boy who passed away from AIDs. The title track has a great beat to it and is the last single from this album.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|I bought this backpack so that I could take my camera gear wherever I went. I like this pack.  I can easily fit my Canon XTi, Tamron wide angle zoom lens, 100-400mm big lens, 50mm lens, external flash, video camera and pocket point and shoot.  The moveable velcro dividers are great for when I want to keep the 100-400 on the camera for wildlife photos.  I just move the dividers around to fit the lenses.  The other pockets/pouches carry all of my camera batteries and chargers for all the cameras, memory cards, manuals and notebooks, AV/USB cords.  Unlike my other bag, I don't have to leave anything behind.  The only way they could have improved this pack is if it would have more velcro straps to secure the lens from falling out of the compartments when the bag is opened but one could easily make some or just be careful to lay it down before opening it. I am a medium framed woman and it fits very comfortably but I imagine a larger person may find it a tight squeeze.  I would definitely recommend this backpack.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|I bought this complete series from amazon.com brand new. About half of the DVD's jam and will not play. Very hard to get completely through an entire episode on several disks.

B0021L8V1Q|4.0|How do you follow up a highly praised popcorn flick? You add more drama, more peril and a nastier bad guy. Sometimes that mix works and sometimes it doesn't (\\"Batman & Robin\\")in the case of \\"Iron Man 2\\" the results are a bit mixed.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke) the son of one of Howard Stark's collaborators on the arc reactor project uses his own father's designs for his own weapon--whip-like repulsors that can slice things in two. When Venko loses in a conflict with Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Stark's rival Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell)breaks Vanko out of jail with the agreement that Vanko will help Hammer develop his own army of iron men to win back his military contract.

Rhodes (Don Cheadle)finds himself pressured by his superiors to obtain one of Stark's Iron Man suits for their own purposes.<br /><br />Stark discovers that the arc reactor that is powering his suit and keepin ghim alive is slowly killing him.

B003XQRZ7E|3.0|Bonamassa's been around quite a while now, but he's still only 33, & though he's a top-ten blues guitarist, he's also a fan of hard rock.  Apparently he feels that there's greater opportunity in rock than blues. That's fine, but there's a problem here: Just as Clapton never let his musical backing keep him from finding his own, blues-based voice, Joe must stop bending over backwards to play the 'right thing' in every situation. The right thing is -you- Joe. What if Eric had played crunchy hard-rock rhythm guitar all over Cream's arrangements?  Yuck. Ok, maybe blues is somewhat of a dead-end, compared to what a successful rock band can do, but where do -you- fit in?  In a much more blues-based capacity than this, I think.
B003YBNRHU|5.0|A terrific album from the Doobies, \\"World Gone Crazy\\" finds both Tom Johnston and Pat Simmons turning in some of their finest songs in this reunion with long time producer Ted Templeman. Johnston has some of his finest songs here in quite some time and the deluxe edition bonus track \\"New York Dream\\" with its R&B horn arrangement is essential for Doobies fans. The band's remake of \\"Nobody\\" (from their very first album) also sparkles with a new guitar intro that Simmons and John McFee came up with for the song. Johnston's voice has deepened a bit with time and the arrangement/performance here along with Johnston's vocal improve on the original version.<br /><br />Former Doobie Michael McDonald provides harmony and background vocals on Pat Simmons' \\"Don't Say Goodbye\\" while Willie Nelson co-writes and sings with Pat on \\"I Know We Won\\". Both are terrific songs from Simmons and this is probably the best album with both Johnston and Simmons in the line up since \\"Stampede\\". Having Ted Templeman in the chair as producer makes all the difference since he instinctively plays to the band's strengths (as he always has). The mastering for this disc is pretty good avoiding the harsh compression of many contemporary releases.<br /><br />The DVD includes a short documentary on the band co-directed by Pat Simmons. While it includes some terrific vintage footage and interviews with Simmons, Johnston, McFee and McDonald (as well as brief snippets of the band when they appeared on the TV show \\"What's Happening!\\", \\"The Dinah Shore Show\\" as guests, appearences on \\"The Tonight Show\\" and other TV appearances) these are too brief and hopefully there will be an expanded version of this documentary as its clear that Simmons has access to some terrific home movie and video footage and the 31 minutes alloted for the documentary only scratches the surface of the band's history. Missing in the documentary are former band members Tiran Porter, Jeff \\"Skunk\\" Baxter, John Hartman all of whom were around during pivotal times during the band's career. Let's hope there will be a full video release of this as Simmons could have made this an hour and STILL not touch on the band's long history/issues/sucesses.<br /><br />While this deluxe edition isn't essential for the dvd, it is for the two bonus songs.

B000ASDFJU|4.0|The seller was very quick to ship, and the product was well packaged. The selling price was reasonable.   As for the box set, there were a few noticeable differences between the \\"same\\" DVD box set I had purchased previously from a well-known retail outlet and this one, purched via this Amazon vendor. (Having already owned, and viewed this box set, I had a comparative perspective.) Specifically: the \\"box\\" in which the box set was packaged was a very thin, soft, plastic sleeve, and not the hard plastic sleeve the other set had. The photo pages included in the box set were wrinkled as if they had been exposed to water, and were printed on thin paper, which almost made me think they were photocopied. The DVDs were a slightly different color, and, when played, predominantly had the subtitles turned on, and I had to turn them off at the start of every episode. The episodes played from one to the next in order, and only returned to the DVD menu when the last episode on that DVD had ended, rather than returning to the episode (for that disc menu each time and episode on a disc ended. The default option for each episode was to watch a preview of the episode rather than to play the episode, so you had to take care to choose the correct option if you wanted to just play the episode. One very interesting aspect of the DVDs is that there have been scenes here and there in episodes that I know well, that were different than I had seen before; (vastly different) almost as if I was watching the unreleased episodes. Really a funny and pleasant surprise. My thought was that this was either a bootleg version of the DVD set, or a version originally for non-US release. It has been amusing for sure. All in all, the DVD set was a good price and does include amusing, slightly alternate versions of the episodes. The seller provided quick shipping and courteous service. Have a cosmo, and enjoy!
030726999X|5.0|In July 2010 I read The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. As soon as I finished it, I downloaded The Girl Who Played With Fire and started reading it immediately. Five minutes after finishing the second book in the trilogy, I couldn't wait to read the last one. I started reading it again within five minutes of finishing the second one. The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest started out right where the second one ended, so it was a continuous read. I LOVED all of them, but the last one was brilliant! I didn't want to finish it and started reading slower toward the end. The story engulfed me and I knew that there would be no more stories about Lizbeth Salander and Mikel Blomqvist! I will miss them!! Since we have been to Stockholm and Gamla Stan, it made it even more intriguing picturing the places along the way.
B003EY7IUY|1.0|pre ordered book as i am kinsella/wickham fan. do not waste your money as this is the same premise, only exacerbated by a two year old brat, ineffectual parents, dopey subcharacters and a ridiculous denouement. if you must, borrow it or buy at used bookstore. kinsella/wickham has gone out on the ledge on this one. pathetic...

B003ZK58WM|1.0|Although I love Mr. Follet's work, I am in agreement that this exorbitant price is shocking! Why should the eversion cost more than the hardcover one? I would love to contact Penguin books to express my views directly to the publisher, but was flummoxed by their website.

B003ZK58WM|1.0|Really, Penguin publishing?  Greed is NOT good, contrary to what Gordon Gekko would say. Charging more for the ebook vs the hardcover on amazon is just plain ludicrous. Hopefully your two star rating on amazon will wake your ebloviated executives from their version of reality, and make them realize $20 for an ebook is just plain crazy. Until this price comes down, I will go to hell and high-water to ensure I don't add to your overflowing coffers.     Wake up Penguin. Inception is over.
0525951652|5.0|Since when Amazon review is based on the price of books? Can we all be rational and responsible here when leaving reviews to base on the book content instead of the price tag? I understand how ridiculous it is that the publisher priced the Kindle version at $19.99. I have a Kindle and I simply won't pay that kind of price. But if everybody just trashes the book because its price then what's the purpose of reading the review here? I rely heavily on Amazon review whenever I want to buy a book and with such a biased review it simply frustrated me. Please, anybody has read the book and think you can share with us not just based on the price?
B003ZK58WM|5.0|Numerous people on here simply object to the price and then rate the product badly with no actual knowledge of the product itself.  Hopefully people will be smart enough to stick to reviews that offer substance and actually review the book, not the price, or at least read the book and then determine if it wasn't worth the price to them.<br /><br />Is my \\"review\\" contradictory to my statements above?  Absolutely.  The inherent weakness of Amazon's review system is that people don't actually have to review the product at all, they can use the review system as a platform for their own personal politics, as I'm doing now.  I'm providing yet another example to flaws in the review system.<br /><br />That said, yes, I did buy the Kindle Edition of The Fall of Giants and it is next on my reading list.
6302763835|4.0|I admit I haven't seen the film since 1955, but it remains one of my favorites memories. The highest accolade I can give it is that I went to movie without a date and I still loved it.
0385504225|1.0|Digital Fortress was an entertaining if forgettable read, Angels & Demons was good fun even though the bad writing was impossible to ignore, Deception Point's plot was amusing, and I  was entirely entertained with The Da Vinci Code, but The Lost Symbol is a stunningly awful book. The Langdon character has become a slow witted, pedantic bore. The Solomon's are unbelievable super-beings like something out of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan. The clever associations that worked so well in The Da Vinci Code, are often already familiar in The Lost Symbol. The villain is something out of a comic book. I found myself intermittently screaming out loud at the stupidity of it all.      The Lost Symbol  might be turned into a good film, but the read is an aggravating waste of time.
0440178002|5.0|As with any review, we are rating not only the content of the book, but also its delivery, quality of the product and packaging - all of these were very good.    ...but, if I would have to rate just the novel, i would definitely say that it is a very good novel, and one may even think written by the insider into the Japanese culture. A reader can see here how different are/were the East and the West. Their customs, their religions and perceptions of life and death, and lastly of love. Love between the two protagonists seems a strange occurance in a society where \\"love\\" isn't defined as a separate powerful force, that can easily change the current of someone's life. But she learns.......    As for the main character, I think the author presented his fundamental character very well, like why was he looked at as being \\"special\\" by the Japanese?? And his evolution to a full-fledged sword wielding samurai warrior. The transformation has been very positive. In contrast we see the unwillingness on the part of his crew members, who shun the culture that captured their bodies, as a result they completely devolve and in most cases loose their humanity. A good lesson for many of us I think, and in general the book contains multitude of lessons like this, a treasure trove in a way.
0525951652|1.0|Having recently fallen in love with the library, I rarely buy a book anymore, but I went out an purchased this the day it was released. What a huge disappointment!!! I simply couldn't finish this book. It was boring, the characters were unbelievable, and I really didn't care enough to find out what happened in the end.I almost never start a book and abandon it halfway through. The Pillars of the Earth and World Without End were amazing books, and I have a hard time believing how poorly this novel stands up beside them. I haven't been this disappointed in a book in a long time!
1416550550|5.0|I'm always behind everyone else in reading the 'hit' books of any particular year, and this is the case for Kate Morton's book, The Forgotten Garden (2008).<br /><br />I didn't think I would like this book, not sure why, but I find most books that get a lot of hype, aren't usually to my taste, but I'm glad I bought this book and decided to read it when I was feeling a little low.<br /><br />The Forgotten Garden is a thick book, over 600 pages. I love thick books, especially when the story is engaging because it lasts longer.<br />The story revolves around one family over a period of three separate eras and mainly on three different characters - Eliza 1907-1913, Nell 1975 ans Cassandra 2005.<br /><br />It did take me a little while to get into the book, but once I was in, I was hooked on finding out what happens. I enjoyed the way the author went between the three characters and the eras with ease. Three stories within one story would have been hard work, and could easily lost its way, but the author remained true and steady to unravelling the central mystery of the abandoned little girl, Nell.<br /><br />This is the first book by Kate Morton I have read, and to start with I wasn't keen on the distant omniscient point of view, but that changed into a deeper POV once the characters were established, which I much prefer.<br />The descriptions were good and I could clearly see the scenes and the characters.<br />I had solved the mystery half way through the book, but that didn't diminish the story for me at all.<br />Overall, I enjoyed this book and the effort it must have taken to weave the eras and characters together was very well done.
B003V63VNI|4.0|You can tell Boyd's mind is filled with healthy curiosity about humanity here.  He maintains a certain raw acoustic quality with each song which emphasizes the urgency of his message(s).  Fans of early 90s Alice in Chains and STP will identify with the sound of many of these songs.  Boyd delivers amazing vocals, as usual.  Overall, this is a great record which gets better and more meaningful with each listen.

B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Movie - 4.5    In 2008, Iron Man took the box office by storm garnering high praise from fans and critics alike and grossing over $500 million worldwide. Personally, I was very surprised at how I liked it for its storytelling, witty humor, and blockbuster production values. It was thoughtful enough in establishing Tony Stark as a meaningful character, while at the same time providing loads of entertainment. With expectations set high, Iron Man 2 has a lot of anticipation going for it. And while it doesn't quite exceed its predecessor, I think it's just as good. The plot opens up 6 months after the end of the first film and puts Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) in the presence of a senate hearing where the government basically wants him to turn the Iron Man suit over at the \\"interest of national security.\\" But being the egotistical, yet virtuous, man that he is, Stark defends his case with ease by nonchalantly proving it'd be safer under his own personal use. Seeing this from afar, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), is sickened by Stark's actions and false pretenses and vows to put him in his place. In the meantime, rival weapons contractor Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) takes notice of Vanko's ambition and offers his resources in a joint effort to take down both Iron Man, as well as an ailing Tony Stark. Narrative wise, IM2 is a little less personable than the first as we were introduced to Stark, saw him realize his guilt, then become Iron Man in an effort of redemption. Here, after discovering that his palladium chest piece is slowly killing him, Stark must face his own mortality in and outside of the suit. But at the same time, being who he is (i.e. very kept to himself), he refuses confide in anyone. As a result, it alienates him and tarnishes his more likable portrayal from the first film. However, once he comes to terms with his father's legacy, he realizes his mistake and strives to become, not just Iron Man again, but the Iron Man worthy of his Avengers candidacy. Thereal diverging point in IM2, though, (and probably something that's greatly divided the fanbase) is the excess of comic book elements thrown in. The additions of Nick Fury, Black Widow, War Machine, Whiplash, Justin Hammer, and his robot army might feel a bit overwhelming with their newness. But I personally love the feeling of expansion it gives, especially considering the massive amount of crossovers, cameos, and references that will have to be made when Thor, Captain America, Iron Man 3, and The Avengers movies are done. But don't let that deter you. Despite all of the extra components, IM2 is still fun to watch with a snarkier script, more brisk pacing, better special effects, stellar action sequences, and a star-studded cast of actors. The next two years can't come soon enough.    Video - 5.0    Iron Man 2 presents itself with a much fuller image than the first movie. I absolutely love the filmic texture this one has in comparison. The slightly darker look may throw some people off, but I think it helps a great deal in CG effects integration, making for quite a pristine picture. To start off, colors possess an amazing amount of vibrancy. Red, gold, orange, yellow, occasional blues, and a little bit of green (in the Japanese garden) dominate the palette presenting some very cool shots, especially for action scenes. Blacks are deep and inky, while shadow delineation reveals an adequate amount of depth in all the tiny little lines and textures, nothing less from a Blu-ray with a newly minted transfer. Contrast helps to balance things out and doesn't waver a bit in terms of saturation levels or screen lighting. Facial features and flesh tones look excellent, particularly Scarlett Johansson with her pouty lips and pretty green eyes when we see her for the first time and she gets into the training ring. But getting back to the CG, I have to reiterate just how flawless it all looks and fits into the picture and overall scope of the plot. I thought IM1 looked good. Butconsidering how much more action-packed IM2 is, it's amazing to even contemplate the amount of work that went into producing this special effects extravaganza. You can pretty much use any of the action sequences as demo material for the video or audio. But if I had to narrow it down to specific scenes, I'd say the fight in Monaco is definitely good for contrast (being the only daytime fight scene in the entire movie), the meeting with Nick Fury for black levels (not a racial thing, he just happens to be wearing a lot of black, which shows some good detail in his clothes), and the final battle at the Stark Expo/Japanese Garden for overall color (lots of greens, pinks, and charcoals, especially recommended). There's a little bit of banding in the digital backgrounds, but it's only a minor quibble in an otherwise reference video presentation. There are no signs EE, DNR, or a single artifact to sully, yet, another very fine transfer from the people at Paramount.    Audio - 5.0    Like the video, the audio portion of this film also outdoes its predecessor. The DTS-HD track here is instant go-to material and very representative of the advantages of lossless audio in general. From the very beginning of the movie, we get an enticing tease of what to expect in terms of directionality, separation, and LFEs as the opening credits introduce us to some ominous music, Ivan working on his own Arc Reactor, and some pounding bass effects. Aside from the obvious gunfire and weapons mayhem, the sound design for IM2 greatly utilizes all four surround speakers. Crowd noise and cheering make up a good deal of ambience during the more low-key dialogue sequences such as the intro of the Stark Expo (minus the flashy entrance) or Stark's hearing in front of the senate. There's some especially nice reverberation in Downey Jr.'s voice when he speaks on the microphones, and I'm very pleased at how much clarity and buoyancy came through. Dynamic and discrete effects from Jarvis and all the little workshop noises are on par with the previous film, though I might even be inclined to say it sounds better as a result of the balanced score. The score, by the way, is a big improvement. No disrespect to Ramin Djiwadi for his catchy riffs and rhythms from IM1, but John Debney did an outstanding job fusing both a traditional orchestral feel, as well as a contemporary rock one (thanks in big part to Tom Morello for his guitar work). But of course, the real highlight of this audio track is its riveting display of action. All sorts of weapons fire fill the soundscape in every which direction with the rears and sub getting a good portion of the home theater workout. Explosions, palladium-powered armaments and flight, landing suits of armor, and other large machinery showcase some of the finest LFEs I've heard in retrospect to screenplay and mood setting. Again, the obvious choices to use for reference are any of the action sequences mentioned above. But don't be afraid to test the Stark Expo or Senate Hearing scenes either. Fans of the film will be quite pleased with this awesome presentation.    Extras - 5.0    For those who really enjoy special features, this combo pack comes loaded with hours of excellent production and background information. To start, disc 1 comes with an audio commentary by director Jon Favreau, a S.H.I.E.L.D. Vault trivia database, and a P-i-P pre-viz track that can play along with the movie. The commentary makes for an extremely entertaining and informative listen. Favreau maintains a good pace with lots of useful tidbits about the filming itself, elements of the story, and the occasional anecdote. This is probably my favorite feature of all the extras, as it really changed my overall perspective of the plot and its character development, as well as reconfirming my notion that it was all a result of setting up future Avengers stuff. He never leaves a lot of dead space and sounds very enthused about the work he accomplished. The Vault is a coolnovelty that can be accessed from the menu by itself or as a pop up video track during the film via Footage Scan Mode. During the film, it doesn't do much. But as a standalone feature it provides a lot of interesting trivia for this building Marvel Movie Universe. Meanwhile, the pre-viz video track is exactly what it sounds like and makes for maybe one decent sitting at most. On disc 2, we get the meat of the making-of features. Ultimate Iron Man spans almost an hour and a half and covers just about everything up through post-production. The making-of they had on IM1 was great, and I liked how consistent this felt in conjunction to this proposed trilogy. Rounding out the rest of the relevant extras is another 30 minutes of Featurettes. Here, they give some extra coverage on set design and a little bit of background info on Nick Fury, Black Widow, and War Machine. When I first heard they were going to include these, I was expecting much longer segments like the 49-minute exposition they had for Tony Stark on IM1's specials. Unfortunately, the segments for these three don't even amount to half of what they had for Stark. But despite my disappointment, I still dig the commentary enough that I won't deduct any points. It's a very recommended listen.    Overall - 5.0    Iron Man 2 may be something of a mixed bag for general audiences, as the greater scope of things might be a little too overwhelming. I, however, have no qualms with the direction this took and am actually quite excited to see how things will eventually tie together when all the Avengers canon is complete. But regardless of what people may think of the story, IM2 is still heartful enough and is even more witty, charming, and thoroughly action-packed as the first. With reference A/V specs and a pleasing set of extras led by one of the best commentaries I've heard in a while, Iron Man 2 comes highly recommended, and is a must-own for fans.

0525951652|1.0|I too had looked forward to reading the book on Kindle but was shocked to find that the price was higher that the hardbound version.  Amazon needs to revisit its pricing policy on Kindle versions in order to keep the tacit understanding with its customers that electronic readers are a more efficient and, therefore less expensive, way of distributing the texts.
0393061310|4.0|I'm going to be honest. I didn't purchase this book when it first came out because I didn't think, based on the reviews, that it was going to say much of anything that was news to me. It doesn't but then I'm a data junkie and a history nut, etc. It's a decent book but it's saying things I already knew long before the book came out. I can recall reading about the Spanish conquest of what is now Peru in an old History book my parents had used in grade school about the time I was ten. I think I understood who had the advantages and what they were then. I picked up a lot from National Geographic, etc. through the years. Nothing is novel. I have a few nits to pick but basically I agree with most of what he wrote. To me the book is redundant. Your mileage may vary.    If you don't already know what the advantages various early groups and locations had that foreshadowed much of their future gains or lack of same then the book does explain in simple easy to understand layman's language. If you think about what is said carefully and study what is going on around you, you can make some highly likely guesses about what is going to happen to various nations over the next hundred years or so. Prospects for Whites of European descent especially from France, England, and Germany along with the natives of same and the natives of Spain and Portugal stink. I leave it to you to figure out why but my data says these people are largely joining the Neanderthal. Like them we will no doubt leave a few stray genes around.
B0031SU2Y2|4.0|There is tense as the opening is about the method, stress, and danger  of  the desire to smuggle into Europe.  Bilal is an athletic 17 year old from Turkey, and his mission is cross into Europe to be with a girl he loves, and whose family is set against this union.  But being caught forces him to walk to Europe 4,000 kilometers that took 3 months.<br /><br />He intends to swim the English Channel, 10 hours into the icy waters, where his beloved family is now located.  Bilal meets a gold-medal swimming champ turned failure, turned instructor, Simon, who trains him to swim.  Simon lets Bilal and a friend stay at his home and lives in threat of being reported by his neighbors for harboring the immigrants.  Simon, in the midst of a divorce, takes the risk to harbor the immigrants in an attempt to win his wife back prior to a divorce.<br /><br />Director Philippe Lioret had the idea for the movie learning about people who flee their homes at all costs and they followed non-profit organizations who help these people.  The drama is based on a story of a young immigrant who does want to swim the English chanel.  Director Lioret has learned about the very young people who leave their homeland, and the people who help them.  This film has won numerous awards.<br /><br />Although the film is slow for some, its drama is told within the conflicts of loving, leaving, success, failure, hope and dreams. The soundtrack is minimal, acting is impressive.  The French film, released in 2009, is a Film Movement selection.  Film Movement brings to viewers around the country, quality filming, great stories, good directing!  ......Rizzo
B002NXOQF2|5.0|This review will be short as my hands have a hard enough time typing these days.  I picked up this book a long while back with the idea of seeing what all the fuss was about.  A story about a bunch of rabits? How can it be THAT good?  After reading it, I absolutely loved it and subsequently went on to read \\"More Tales from Watership Down\\".  I can't tell you how upset I am that the story ends there. But anyway, it's an incredible story that has me wondering if the author somehow had an \\"in\\" with this bunch of rabits and how could he possibly know all of this for it certainly seemed \\"real\\" and plausible in the telling.  The fact that kids now read this in English Lit (it was new when I was in school) is great because that stuff can often be somewhat dull and hard to read. THIS however is NOT one of those.  I will love this book forever and will probably be reading it again sometime soon.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|Pricing this at $19.99 is a real slap in the face to loyal Kindle users and shortsighted on the part of the publisher.  Some may think a 1 star rating based on price is unfair but ratings influence sales, and at this price no Kindle user should bother.  Sorry Ken Follett.  Your interests are not well represented by your publisher.
0345505387|5.0|I love this book.  It's the first graphic novel I've read.  I'm a huge fan of Diana Gabaldon and the Outlander series.  I consider this a wonderful addition to the series and it just supplements my experience with the series.  I love seeing the artist's interpretations of people and scenes that of course had only previously existed in my own mind's eye.  I love the additions/ extensions of the existing stories which give us just more background to the characters and their interaction.     I do understand some other reviewer's difficulties with faces changing throughout the book.  But I still just consider this the artist's interpretation in conveying the whole scene, rather than making just a photocopy of a previous facial image.  The changes do not limit or go against my whole experience of the book.  I find myself really dawdling over the pages and enjoying it for the work of art that it is.  I find myself reading each chapter at least twice before going on to the next chapter, just to enjoy it all.  Thank you Diana and Hoang.
B0006PV5VC|5.0|Unless you are comatose, this recording will send your blood pumping and make your hair spontaneously combust. I cannot fathom the 'yawn' comment. Perhaps they listened to the music sans any familiarity with the pieces, or perhaps they are ignorant of the stupendous number of other, not so wonderful, recordings available, especially of the Scheherazade. If for no other reason, listen to the unison triple-tongue passage in the last movement of the Scherherzade by the brass. No other recording has even come close. Wow. I understand the last movement was recorded whole, without retakes or insertions, something almost unheard of now. Reiner was noted for the extraordinary energy of his recordings (as in Strauss etc.) and this is no exception. Buy it.
0061433047|5.0|I've waited all year for this book to come out- and am not disappointed. What a lovely read- Once again Terry Pratchett produces a story that is funny, true and bittersweet. I'll miss Tiphany and her crazy band of blue helpers, but I \\"Shall Wear Midnight\\" is a great completion of the tale. Don't waste another second- read the book!
B003Y5H4SO|4.0|I've gotta disagree with part of Paul Giata's Amazon.com review of \\"Devil\\", M. Night Shyamalan's supernatural mystery brought to life on the big screen.  I don't think the lack of pulp dialogue took away from the overall quality of the movie.  As a matter of fact, I think M. Night should stay on the production side of the house (while opening more doors for others to direct his stories) since this is the best movie he's done in a long time, maybe even as far back as \\"The Sixth Sense\\".<br /><br />Alfred Hitchcock and Rod Serling would be proud of this film, which combines simplicity with a twist, and was enough to keep me interested in how the plot would climax throughout the rather short 80-minute duration.  It reminded me of some of the old \\"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\\" and \\"Twighlight Zone\\" episodes; which, by the way were short in length but long on quality.<br /><br />The cast was full of underrated familiar faces, including Bokeem Woodbine, Chris Messina, Jenny O'Hara and Jacob Vargas, who did an admirable job delivering lines from Brian Nelson's screenplay.  John Erick Dowdle did a nice job of guiding the scenes and characters from behind the camera and I throught his style of direction was well suited for this subtle mystery slash thriller.<br /><br />Bottom line: Night Chronicles Productions stepped up to the plate and hit a home run with M. Night's \\"Devil\\".
B002UNMW7O|5.0|I skipped the theatrical released and postponed renting it for months because of the negative reviews given by so many people claiming to have been fans of the original Boondock Saints.  I'm no fan of bad sequels.  In fact, I'm generally no fan of sequels, period.  But I finally got talked into renting BDS II and I ordered a copy online that same night.  Now I want to hunt down all those haters and go all \\"Saints\\" on them for having denied me this pleasure for so long!  This was a fantastic movie!  It is one of the few sequels that is every bit as good as its original!  It was pure BDS start to finish.    If you truly understand the Saints you already know that it's an over-the-top celebration of raw, uncut, testosterone-overloaded, blue-collar masculinity that doesn't take itself seriously.  I don't see how anyone who didn't like this movie could call himself a MAN with a straight face!
B0037LXTUW|5.0|First off, if you own the original Dixit and enjoy it, you should most definitely pick up this expansion.  It is just a small box of 84 cards which can be shuffled into the main deck and played as normal.  Nothing more, nothing less.      Now, if you don't own Dixit, you need to decide between this and the main game.  The main game of Dixit is also only 84 cards, but it also comes with instructions, a scoring track, and tokens for scoring and voting.  You might be able to just buy this expansion, which is slightly less expensive, and come up with another means to score.  But if you've played it and enjoy it, it's probably worth picking up both this and the main game.      Overall I think Dixit is a fantastic game for groups of all types of people.  Many games appeal only to a certain type of person (you know who you are), but this one breaks those boundaries.  It also won the Spiel Des Jahres, which shows that it has appeal for gamers as well.  Highly recommended.
B001F0RA2U|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Redbreast on my kindle even if it was a bit of a disappointment after the Millennium Trilogy.   Pity about the reference to the death penalty in South Africa, which was already abolished in 1990. The passing of a death sentence in the year 2000 is therefore grossly inaccurate.
B003U55J9Y|5.0|What a tear-jerker of a last episode.  I loved the clips from all six seasons and loved how everyone's lives, in the end, were the better for having been to the island.  My hat is off to the writers and the actors.

B003ZSIS6C|5.0|I had a quick browse of the book in the search inside. I decided we were a match so I downloaded it to my Dell Streak.<br /><br />I was perhaps looking for another persons point of view on creating your own way of earning a living. Things that were important to me were dealing with status quo, dealing with all this new found time on my hands and other people's vibe about the non-conformist path.<br /><br />First up I would say the author was a natural non-conformist from the outset of his life. I think if you know from your early 20's you want a different way to earn a living and actually create something, I consider that an early start.<br /><br />It also highlighted to me what a golden era we live in for people that what to work from home. I was in my 20's in the 80's and there wasn't a pool of info out there to do something different and still reach millions of customers. I had to grind on with my computer programmer job for 20 years before I finally found a way to wriggle out at 43.<br /><br />There are some sensible ideas in the book. It really does help to have some sort of map of the way you'd like to live. How many hours you want to work a week, how you spend your money, saving for important dreams and culling useless consumers of your time and money.<br /><br />Sometimes even if you've heard some of the ideas presented in this book before, you'd obviously wouldn't be looking at the book if those ideas had taken root in your outlook. Sometimes you need to just keep repeating these ideas into your own brain until some of it sticks.<br /><br />There is a flow to the book. I would by lying if I said I didn't skip a few bits here and there. But these days I also don't believe in reading everything just because someone tells you to finish a book properly cover to cover. In my case there are certain principles I'm not applying for one reason or another and I need to get them bedded in asap. One of those is making good use of my extra time on my hands. At the moment I have an income that allows me to meet all my basic bills but not much else. I don't use a single credit card (anymore - burnt fingers) and rely on cold cash each month.

B000NQR7R0|5.0|The cd is worth buying just for \\"Fideo del Oeste\\" and \\"Malaguena Salerosa,\\" but you also get \\"Se Me Paro,\\" \\"Severina,\\" and \\"Rey de Los Chingones\\" along with \\"Mexican Sausage Link,\\" \\"Siente Mi Amor,\\" and \\"Cuka Roka.\\" These are all songs I have listened to over and over since buying the album. If you like sad ballads, there are two: \\"Alacran y Pistolero,\\" and one other. Robert Rodriguez was the guy who scored \\"Kill Bill\\" and Chingon performs Fideo and M. Salerosa on the Kill Bill 2 extra features.     One caveat: You'll enjoy it a lot more if you can speak Spanish. If you don't, you can look up the lyrics with Google and then use the Explorer translate feature to know what the songs are about.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|Iron Man 2 is a fun, albeit flawed, sequel that also serves as more of a set-up for future Marvel movies.  That being said, this sequel doesn't have enough of what made the first film so much fun: action, Downey improv & banter, and a villain that doesn't get near enough screen time.  This time around, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is battling the blood poisoning that is slowly killing him, while also taking on rival industrialist Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) and Russian genius Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke).  Gwyneth Paltrow returns as Stark's love interest/assistant Pepper Potts, Don Cheadle replaces Terrence Howard as James Rhodes (who dons the War Machine armor, and seems to wind up being a better acting choice as well), Scarlett Johansson joins the cast as the Black Widow, and Samuel L. Jackson returns as Nick Fury; all of which are pretty servicable, but once again, it's Downey's show, and he's loving every minute of it.  I personally dug Rourke's take on Whiplash as he proves to be the most interesting character here other than Stark, but his screen time is sadly lacking.  Still, director Jon Favreau (who has quite a bit of an expanded role here than he did the last time around as Stark's bodyguard) manages to weave a fun sequel, even if it doesn't have that same kind of magic that the first film had before it.  And of course, make sure to hang around after the credits.
B003N5VOUO|1.0|Two of my favorite Indian actors in one of the worst movies I've EVER seen.  Please read the reviews before you buy this and consider the negative ones most carefully.  The racial/political/religous opinions in this film make it uncomfortable to watch and impossible to ignore.  The message is anti-Christian, anti-American, and politically offensive.

And doing that will create happiness for the planet. Simple as that. It all starts at home. Contemplating your navel is the one and only way it happens. So what if she is \\"selfish\\" and \\"indulgent.\\" What better way to be, I cannot think of. She writes a true story and doesn't hold back the negative stuff she went through. I am so impressed, so inspired. Plus, it's fun to read!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Less cerebral and more visceral than The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, this novel equally rates five stars.  Probably the most succinct review I can give to The Girl Who Played With Fire is this: Lisbeth Salander is one of the most interesting and complex female characters I have ever read, and the ending to this amazing novel is the most exciting, engrossing and gasp-out-loud-inspiring finishes that I can EVER remember reading.
B001NXDSLQ|4.0|In \\"The Search for Reality\\" ( Michael Wiese Productions, 1997) Dale Bell (who received an Oscar for the film) describes the incredible issues that faced the documentarians who made Woodstock from getting the film, to getting the camera crews in place and editing multicamera shots with improvised means. As a document of film history it is invaluable. It also shows that a film is made for its time. You would have to have been there to watch the whole thing with unrelenting enthusiasm. The music is great. In the middle of our current wars, we may need another Woodstock, although the filming and editing would be much easier.
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|I can proudly say without any doubt that this album is one of Avenged Sevenfold's best.

B000FCK8ZK|4.0|I found this book after watching the Showtime series for a couple seasons, mostly to see how the series deviated from the books.  Usually, the book is better than the TV or Movie, but this time, I actually prefer the TV series.<br /><br />The book, however, was decently written and I did enjoy it!  Once I got used to only being focused on Dexter (rather than including tons of side bits about the supporting cast), I had a good time.  The endings of the book and the TV show's 1st season differ, and I can guess why they did what they did with the show.  The novel is not long, and they had to flesh out the story a bit to get through as many episodes as they did.  I will say that the ending is not necessarily better or worse than the show, but once you read it, you will understand why the later seasons went almost completely away from the plots of the novels after that.  :)<br /><br />If, like me, you are coming to the novels AFTER the show, then I would treat the \\"novels vs show\\" conflict the same way you treat various conflicting myths about the Greek or Norse gods:  they are all entertaining and demonstrate different aspects of the character you know and love in different ways.<br /><br />I have already started to purchase and read the later novels, and they seem to be getting even better!<br /><br />Enjoy!

I bought my Kindle for a number of reasons, one of them being the $9.99 price or less for an electronic book.    I'm feeling now like I'm being \\"had\\".    I think Amazon should inform publishers that if they want a book to be offered for the Kindle, it will be sold at $9.99 or forget it.
B004132HZS|5.0|I must admit that I've been a Sherlock Holmes fan since I first read Arthur Conan Doyle stories at age of 10. I've watched lot's of movies based on those stories, but I liked very few of them. Most of the time I was disappointed. So I didn't expect much from this modern interpretation  of classic detective genre. I just couldn't imagine how this would work out with all the high tech inventions that overload our world. It seemed to me that there is no way to adjust the romanticism of the past centuries to this hectic modern time. However, it was done brilliantly in this new Sherlock Holmes series. It gave me a hope that there is still a chance for a modern charming mystery on TV. :) I also hope that they will go on with this movie, because it is a real hit (in my opinion)!
B002NXSRVG|5.0|bottom line loads of jaw dropping action and good special effects.If you like Stephen Sommers the director of the Mummy series (not Mummy 3)and Van Helsing which was also great movies you will like this movie. Check it out.
0525951652|5.0|I have actually bought the product shown, and plan on enjoying the book.  In fact I will likely get 30+ hours of enjoyment from this novel the first time I read it and will likely read it again in future years.  I understand how difficult it is to write such an epic novel, and wouldn't doubt that Ken Follett spent several years doing so.  So, for all those who give this a single star because it's not $9.99, shame on you.  Sure, it may be more expensive than several other books, so don't buy it - and that will get your point across to the people that matter (the publishers who want to sell as many books as possible).  But why screw up the rating system for those who use it to gauge the quality of the work.  I, for one, feel that books are the greatest entertainment bargain around - and while I think the authors certainly should be the ones getting more of the profits - I don't think that paying under $1/hour of reading experience (less if you will read it again or loan it to another person to enjoy).  I don't usually review books that I haven't yet read, and wouldn't review a product I didn't purchase, but I am totally sickened by all these price-whiners.
B002ZG98VE|5.0|In my opinion this one was better then Kevin Costners version. Different story lots of epic action, Russell Crowe was a great robin hood lots of great actors in it like Cate Blanchett (Marion Loxely),Max von sydow (Sir Walter Loxely) and others. I don't understand why the critics bashed it it was very good. Check it out. Watch the unrated version.

The only problem - we almost got a speeding ticket because we were listening in the car and were flying with the music.  Fortunately, the cop was understanding and let us go with a warning.
B003UYV08E|5.0|don't be tricked by the bad reviews of this movie, it is on the par with the incredible hulk which was action packed and had a good plot. Better than the first (not saying i didn't like it) more action. Mickey Rourke(Whiplash) was a great villan like abomination, doc ock(Spider man 2)and joker (Dark knight DC comics) Jeff Bridges was also good.Don Cheadle(War machine) did a great job(better than Terrence Howard) also a better actor and Scarlet Johansson who works with Nick Fury was also great. Nick Fury(Samuel L. Jackson) also has more screen time. Loads of action and a good story. Also check out the end of the credits surprise ending.

B003UYUQZW|5.0|Im not to familiar with the video game never played it but it was a great and fun movie probably the best (Resident evil and Tomb raider were also good). Out of all the horrible video game movies they have made out there it was time to make a good one for a change. Disney had their hand in this one and the producers of the Pirates of the carribean movies that is Jerry Bruckheimer which is why it was good. I thought Jake Gyllenhaal did a great job. Check it out good story and lots of action.
0525951652|1.0|#1, I have to say that I check amazon reviews for EVERYTHING, even if I am buying something from another site. On that note, I hate it when the review is for the price or shipping and not for THE ACTUAL PRODUCT.    BUT when I checked my email and saw that there was a new Ken Follett book out, I signed in right away to download it to my Kindle. The extremely low reviews for a book written by one of my favorite authors really GOT MY ATTENTION. Once I saw the KINDLE price and began to read that these were boycott reviews, I decided that I had to jump on the bandwagon, though this is usually against my reviewing principles...    I know that there are many others like me that check Amazon reviews before buying anything.  I hope this sends a message to publishers and the wonderful AUTHORS WITH INFLUENCE in the literary community.    That being said, I can't wait to read this book based on the LITERARY REVIEWS I have read so far.  In fact, I am already on the waiting list AT MY PUBLIC LIBRARY.
0385340540|4.0|With technology stolen from two US defense contractors, a cutting edge satellite surveillance system dubbed Neptune was secretly built and launched under the very nose of the CIA and the rest of the world's elite spy communities - Israel, Saudi Arabia, Russia, England and China. Nobody even knew of the system's top secret existence (let alone who was operating it) until two brilliant Pakistani computer wizards unwittingly hacked into the system and parlayed that illicit entry into an astonishing piece of software capable of hijacking, manipulating and neutralizing the system.<br /><br />When greed and human nature drive these naive programmers into the arms of Washington power broker, Joel Backman,  to ask for his help in shopping the knowledge of the clandestine satellite system and their superlative software package to the highest bidder, the best laid plans of mice and men and crafty programmers and Washington lawyers are smashed into a million tiny pieces. The hapless young hackers are assassinated and never seen from again and Joel Backman is indicted and hidden away in prison on some nebulous but entirely bogus conspiracy and treason charges. The reputation of his multi-million dollar legal firm is shattered, his partner commits suicide (maybe?) and his son's reputation is left in tatters.<br /><br />The story really begins in earnest when a cynical, conniving director of the CIA and an unscrupulous outgoing president hatch an idea to solve the continuing puzzle of who owns Neptune. Grant Backman a pardon, create a false identity for him in another country, be a little less than 100% efficient in guarding this identity and location and, finally, sit back to see who comes gunning for him!<br /><br />Joel Backman's character as a man, a failed father, a wealthy lawyer and power broker, a broken prisoner, a driven student of culture and language and a newly minted caring lover is exceptionally well-developed. Francesca Ferro, his language tutor, is equally well crafted and a wonderfully detailed study of an enigmatic and sophisticated but very human European woman.<br /><br />While its fundamental premise is a tad over the top and registers a little low on the credibility meter, THE BROKER is an enjoyable spy vs spy suspense thriller with the legal overtones for which Grisham is so well known. It's a cautionary tale that warns of the dangers of power without checks, balances and accountability. It's a dark and sinister story that should terrify readers about the extent to which an unscrupulous government spy agency will go, ostensibly in the interests of national security.<br /><br />Finally, and perhaps this will be quite difficult to believe, it is also a charming low-key romance and a wonderfully informative travelogue on Italian life in the city of Bologna. By the bye, THE BROKER also relates an exceptionally interesting narrative of the difficulties of cultural assimilation and learning a foreign language. As surprising as the juxtaposition of these story components may be, Grisham has pulled it all off quite effortlessly. It's not a combination that will work and be of interest to every reader but I found it thoroughly enjoyable and charming at the same time as it was exciting.<br /><br />THE BROKER is a fine addition to Grisham's already excellent and well-stocked body of work. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Paul Weissdetailed study of an enigmatic and sophisticated but very human European woman.

B003SWNRU2|4.0|Back in the day, we used to go see TT Quick at the now-defunct Airport Music Hall what seemed like every other week.  There would be about 20 of us in the audience, so we could go right up front and headbang.  The guitarist Dave DiPietro had the chops and a killer tone and Tornillo sure had the vox to match.  Anyway, I was quite surprised to see that Udo is not here and Tornillo has taken over.  It's a good choice.  But if you are expecting another Restless and Wild or Breaker, you will be disappointed.  There are a few killer tracks, way too many mid-paced mediocre ones, and a few real turkeys on here.  Now if they had upped the ante, and thrown out the turkeys in place of 3 or 4 more killers, this would be right up there.  Sadly, it's just Accept-able.  Now will TT Quick re-group with Udo on vocals?!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved Loved Loved The Hunger Games!  Definitely one of the best books I've read in a long time.  I finished the book in a weekend which is very rare for me...all I wanted to do was sit and read...I could not put it down.  I started the book and was immediately sucked in to the life of Katniss and the world of Panem.  Read it.
B00275EGWY|5.0|In my own way, I can identify with being an adrenaline junkie. I walk around with a limp from a bad motorcycle crash and I'm still addicted to motorcycles.<br /><br />This movie is an adrenaline rush with knobs on. It takes you into a hyper-reality journey where just like the character, you dont know what's next. Except these aren't bikes. These are bombs. And unlike mindless action movies, its also a pure pychological labyrinth of the wordless expressions of mortality. A salient death wish that becomes an ally for how else can one accept the underlying destruction that waves its hand unless one has made friends with it.<br /><br />Surrounding all of this is the obvious fear that bites at those that wish to get out alive. Such a medley of strange sensations to feel fear, love life, resent death but embrace annihilation. What a cocktail.<br /><br />Even after the second or third viewing its was still reverberating with all the heightened sensations. Kathryn's a genius. Im so happy for her.

B002M9WW30|4.0|By now everybody knows the inspirational underdog story of Rocky Balboa.  You'd have to have a heart made of stone not to feel for the wonderful character played perfectly by Sylvester Stallone.  And while the overall quality of these six films may vary, the heart and character does not.    This blu ray release is very good but with a few caveats.  First off, the original needs (and deserves) a restoration along with a more beefy extras package.  Some extras from the DVD didn't make it (inexcusable really), while Rocky 2-5 deserve a little more love too.  I wouldn't expect full restorations, but surely an audio commentary for each isn't too much to ask.    We may have to wait for Rocky: The Definitive Collection.
0446693804|3.0|Not a fan of Sparks novel I nevertheless admire his success in the literary world, it takes a tremendous amount of work and luck to make it to the top. Personally, I find his stories cliche and his writing not so good, but there are plenty of people who enjoy his books, so it's only a matter of taste. \\"A Walk To Remember\\" is a sweet book, there's not much I can say about it. If you feel like you want to get away from the loud and offensive world of Kardashians, pick up this book. A bad-boy with a good heart, which he hides well to appear to be cool in front of his friends, meets a girl who becomes a real challenge for him. He doesn't like her, he is embarrassed to be seen with her, he hurts her feelings until she captures his heart and tames him (something even Bella Swan couldn't manage to do with her vampire)! How many times have we heard this story? Too many, but then there isn't that much new in this world and Sparks manages to create a sweet, loving, at times heartbreaking atmosphere. Be warned- the ending is not what you'd expect! I skipped the last pages, because it got too sugar coated for me: the good were very good, and the bad repelled and became very good as well.   But either way, I'd pick this book over what's on TV these days.
B002N8A14M|4.0|Exactly what I was looking for. The only reason I gave it a 4 star on ease of use is because the bottom of it where you plug your head phones in is a little tight. I hope the velcro holds up; but overall a really good product.

B002ZG97V0|4.0|\\"Legend of the Guardians: The Owls of Ga'Hoole\\" is an animated film with the enchanting lure of a fairy tale, the intrigue of a medieval political thriller, the excitement of an action spectacle, and the majesty of a special effects extravaganza. What it lacks is the time needed to fully develop the characters and the story; the film, an amazing technical achievement, not only moves too quickly but also feels incredibly condensed, as if not just one, but several of Kathryn Lasky's \\"Guardians of Ga'Hoole\\" books (unread by me) were combined into a single story. With so many plot points reduced to vague descriptions, with so many characters that each have engaging and discernable personalities, I didn't feel like I was seeing a great movie, but rather the beginnings of a great movie. And that's the thing - the beginnings are there. For a film just ninety minutes long, that's quite an achievement.    In what's essentially a redressing of a hero's journey, it tells the story of a barn owl named Soren (voiced by Jim Sturgess), who's brave, idealistic, a dreamer, and devoted to stories about the Guardian owls, legendary for their heroic acts and their protection of the kingdom of Ga'Hoole. His brother, Kludd (voiced by Ryan Kwanten), thinks the stories are merely that - stories - and is jealous of the attention Soren receives. One day, the brothers are abducted and taken to the lair of the evil Metalbeak (voiced by Joel Edgerton) and his wicked queen, Nyra (voiced by Helen Mirren). Once there, the weak owls are mentally incapacitated and forced to pick through owl pellets; the strong ones are brainwashed into joining Metalbeak's merciless army and take part in an insidious plot to take over the kingdom. The details of this takeover are left a little obscure, although it apparently involves a debilitating device that runs on scraps of metal.    Brother is turned against brother as Soren befriends Gylfie, a timid elf owl (voiced by Emily Barclay), while Kludd is primed by Nyra to be the greatest of Metalbeak's soldiers. With a little help, Soren and Gylfie escape, and they realize with great excitement that they have finally learned how to fly. They quickly team up with a kooky burrowing owl named Digger (voiced by David Wenham) and his lute-playing poet companion, a great gray owl named Twilight (voiced by Anthony LaPaglia). Only then does Soren learn that the Guardians are not only real, but also the only hope left for saving ... I guess you'd have to call it owlkind, since mankind apparently doesn't exist in this world. Thus the story progresses to a fierce and fiery battle in Metalbeak's lair, which, if the title is of any indication, will someday become legend.    This 3D animated fantasy, director Zach Snyder's first attempt at family entertainment, shows that considerable care went into creating its look. Production designer Simon Whiteley and art director Grant Freckelton have crafted a world of woodland charm and battle-scarred horror, with just a hint of Celtic thrown into the mix. The owls themselves are a triumph of animation, and I have no doubt that their feathers alone were a painstaking ordeal, what with the texture, color, movement, and transparency to take into consideration. There's a close-up shot late in the film, for example, of Soren as he flies through a violent rainstorm; coming towards the camera in slow motion, his feathers ruffle authentically in the howling winds, and rain droplets cling to his body while others splash into his eyes. It's a breathtaking moment, overflowing with power, grace, and style.    The problem is that it didn't go far enough with the story. Either that, or far too much of it was trimmed away in post production. Whatever the case, \\"Legend of the Guardians\\" is one of the few films that actually needs an extra thirty minutes just for the sake of pacing and clarification. We're so quick to complain about a film that moves too slowly, but we often forget that it can be just as damaging for a film to move too fast - we don't want to leave the theater feeling as if crucial details have been overlooked. As a full two-hour film, I suspect the film would do more than seem complete; it would also be one of the best modern-day examples of a conventional fairy tale retold.    Note: Despite the film's PG rating, \\"Legend of the Guardians\\" is considerably darker than most recent animated films - more so, I suspect, than the studios have been willing to reveal in the ads. There's no gratuitous violence, although there are a few decidedly violent moments of owls in battle. It's not excessively gloomy, although there is a consistent undercurrent of danger and despair. Take from this what you will. You obviously know your children a lot better than I do, but I've always been a firm believer that, in general, kids can tolerate a lot more unpleasantness than adults give them credit for. If this weren't the case, stories by J.K. Rowling, Roald Dahl, L. Frank Baum, The Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Andersen, or Carlo Collodi would not have withstood the test of time.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Set in a futuristic society, this book centers around a 16 year old girl named Katniss who lives in one of 12 districts surrounding a control obsessed capital named Pandem. Each district has a specialty in production, but most cannot reap any of the \\"fruits\\" of their labor as everything is claimed by the capital. Katniss keeps her family alive with the help of her friend Gale by hunting outside the district's fence, an offense that warrants an immediate death sentence if they are ever caught. The book starts on the day of reaping, the day where the capital chooses two of each district's children to fight to the death in an arena. By some cruel twist of fate, Katniss's little sister is chosen. Katniss immediately takes her sister's place and has no expectations of survival, as the games show no mercy.<br /><br />Katniss has many flaws, but it is her underlying strength that captivated me. I admire her courage and determination to survive, which started long before she was thrust into the games. Her depth is amazing as she can be quite selfish at times, but the epitome of selflessness at others. I hated to see her make decisions always in a calculated manor rather than allow herself any emotion. However, this just shows one of the many consequences of survival in such a society. The will to survive at all costs can be such a nasty thing that twists and changes people. The phrase \\"kill or be killed\\" just doesn't seem to be quite accurate. Even if someone kills for their own survival some part of you dies anyway. It will irrevocably change them.<br /><br />I wasn't going to review this series because the book blogger community is seriously overloaded with reviews on the series. However, after reading the books, I've decided that they really do warrant an opinion. I've always enjoyed dystopian books, with some of my favorites being George Orwell's 1984, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, and surprisingly considering the story centers around the burning of books, Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451. Now, I'm not sure if I can really say if The Hunger Games is truly up to the caliber of these books as I have not read them in years, but it did remind me of them. That being said,  The Hunger Games is dystopia at its best, or worst depending on how you look at it. I'm not sure why these type of books suck so many people in, myself included, but dystopian books always seem to cause a stir. Perhaps it is that small part of ourselves that would wish for a utopia and these books show the more likely outcome of someone trying to create such a society.<br /><br />This book was shocking, graphic and shows the cruel side of human nature.  It will suck you in almost from the first word, and is probably one of the most thought provoking books I have read in a very long time. You will find yourself rooting for the characters even though they are in a hopeless situation. It is definitely a must read!451.

B0036TGSIK|4.0|It's easy to like a character, but it isn't often you come across one that you would want to actually be friends with, or maybe even wish you could be like. For me, such a character is Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone), a high-school student from Ojai, California. True, she may only be a fictional character, but she's also the embodiment of personality - smart, witty, and affable, yet not so perfect or above it all that she fails to be human. Despite these magnetic qualities, she isn't noticed much by her peers, and she's all but upstaged by her best friend (Aly Michalka), who makes it a point to believe only what she wants to believe instead of actually listening to the truth. Things drastically change for Olive when she gains an infamous reputation as the school floozy, something she didn't start but certainly chose to perpetuate.    Her story is told in \\"Easy A,\\" which is not only one of the funniest teen comedies of recent memory, but is also one of the most intelligent. Rather than go for obvious lowbrow sex and booze toilet humor, director Will Gluck and writer Bert V. Royal show the temerity to engage the audience with clever dialogue, strong characters, and a plot we can actually care about. It doesn't play down to the audience. If we laugh, it's not because of a vulgar throwaway gag but because of genuinely funny scenarios, many of which are relatable to varying degrees. Perhaps the film is founded on an extraordinary premise, but in my mind, it's a perfectly plausible premise, and the fact that the filmmakers could keep the story grounded while making it entertaining is quite an amazing achievement.    Olive's infamy begins when she lies about having lost her virginity over the weekend to a college student she made up. The lie is overheard by Marianne (Amanda Bynes), a judgmental and pious Little Miss Christian, who proceeds to tell everyone she knows about Olive's indiscretion. Rumors quickly spread. Other students begin to take notice of her, and although she never asked for her newfound reputation, she finds she's appreciating the attention. She's then approached by her gay friend, Brandon (Dan Byrd), who's so tired of being harassed by homophobic bullies that he begs her to pretend to have sex with him. Knowing that no one would believe her if she simply told people about it, Olive drags Brandon to a classmate's party, where they lock themselves in a bedroom and make all the necessary noises. Everyone is fooled.    This includes Marianne and her circle of Christian friends, one of whom boldly suggests that Olive follow the lead of Hester Prynne in \\"The Scarlett Letter\\" and mark herself. Not content with doing things half-heartedly, Olive arrives at school the next day wearing a bustier with a red A affixed to the right breast. In due time, she's approached by other boys who want Olive to do for them what she did for Brandon; she agrees to help them all, although she's well aware that the situation is getting out of hand. It's bad enough that they're using her to inflate their egos. Why must they also compensate her with gift certificates and coupons to affordable stores like The Home Depot and Bed Bath and Beyond?    The ads have prepared us to view Olive as a cliché - a wisecracking teen who never shows her emotions and flaunts her superior intellect in the form of biting sarcasm and dry wit. But we end up seeing nothing of the sort. Olive is a young woman of considerable depth, jokey on the outside but within harboring needs, hopes, and deep insecurities. They emerge during scenes with the school mascot, Woodchuck Todd (Penn Badgley), the one guy who has known Olive most of her life and sees the person behind the reputation. Through him, she comes to believe that regaining her self-respect depends on tracking down each of the boys she helped and coercing them into telling the truth. This proves far more difficult than she expected. It's just as well; the root of \\"self-respect\\" is \\"self,\\" which is to say no one other than her can turn the situation around.    Other characters, such as Olive's loveably liberal parents (Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci) and her perpetually flustered school principal (Malcolm McDowell), add color to the story, even if they are a bit less three-dimensional and serve mostly as comedy relief. The English teacher, Mr. Griffith (Thomas Hayden Church), is not only as witty and charming as Olive but is also remarkably perceptive; the same cannot be said about Mr. Griffith's estranged wife (Lisa Kudrow), which is ironic since she's the school's guidance counselor. I don't want to reveal too much about this couple. Let it suffice to say that Olive's actions have consequences that extend beyond the limits of the student body.    The film is told as a retrospective, Olive opening the film with a webcam confessional that continuously weaves in and out of the story proper. This is far from an original narrative technique, but Stone's performance and Royal's dialogue elevates it to new heights. Right at the start, we're drawn to this character, and we want to stay near her even after the story has come to an end. Not too many roles have this kind of power. Not too many teen comedies are this well written. \\"Easy A\\" is a sweet, sassy, ingenious little movie, one that I hope will not be forgotten ten years from now.
1416972242|5.0|The repercussions of finding out Jace is Valentine's son hit everyone hard, but had the most devastating impact on Jace and Clary. While they are trying to figure out their new roles with each other, Valentine doesn't give them a break. He continues with his plot to destroy all of the downworlders as well as the Shadowhunter's Clave. Because of this, Jace's loyalty is constantly tested and questioned throughout the book. Almost everyone believes he is Valentine's spy and he spends most of this book fighting against imprisonment. In the end, one person's revenge could cost them everything, as without their help, it could all easily crumble.<br /><br />Anyone who read my Review of the first book in this series, City of Bones could tell that I was completely shocked at the twist in the end of the book. I didn't go into to much detail because I didn't want to spoil such a major event. However, now that I've read the second book, I just have to talk about said event. Never would I have expected Jace and Clary to be siblings! The heartache is completely evident between the two throughout this book as they both try to deny/hide their feelings for each other. I cannot imagine finding out the person you love is completely unattainable. They could have overcome almost any other obstacle, but this one just won't go away no matter how much they may want it to.<br /><br />Its funny that the \\"love triangle\\" aspect continues throughout this book considering Jace is her brother, but it does make sense since neither Clary nor Jace can just turn off their feelings. As much as I love Simon's character and his absolute loyalty to Clary, I just don't feel the \\"romance\\" between the two of them. I think Simon is truly in love with her, but one side just isn't enough. Clary of course loves him, but its more of an extremely close brother love, the type of love she should have for Jace. I think there are only two reasons she shows any romance at all towards Simon. One, she is trying to forget about Jace, something that just doesn't look likely, and two, because she is afraid of losing Simon. Even though her feelings might not be romantic, she cannot bear the thought of losing him. The poor girl is just in a losing battle on all sides.<br /><br />There were plenty of shocking moments in this book, and one character in particular was irrevocably changed. Everything about the world and the characters seems so real. All the emotions are felt right along with the characters as they go through the things they do. I love a book/series that really sucks you in, and this one is no exception. The most impressive would have to be Valentine's character. Sometimes the villains in books just don't come across as completely believable or a major threat. However, Valentine is truly a nefarious character as everyone who he comes in contact is utterly destroyed in one way or another. Everyone loves a \\"good\\" bay guy to \\"hate, and Valentine fits that bill perfectly.something that just doesn't look likely, and two, because she is afraid of losing Simon.

B0043IL8BA|5.0|If you are a fan of 80's music or just love great dance-pop, do not miss this one. In my humble opinion it is the best work OMD has ever done. It's as though they have taken their classic synth-pop sound and updated it with a bit of an influence from contemporary electronic artists like Moby, while recalling the song structure of some of their strongest albums like Architecture & Morality and Sugar Tax. My personal faves are \\"History of Modern pt.1\\" and \\"Rfwk\\" but don't skip a single track because you will be missing a compelling song. When the final track arrives, you will be treated to a club-banging single called \\"Save Me\\" featuring guest vocals from the one and only Queen of Soul, Aretha Franklin, and if you hadn't already figured it out by then, you will know you have been listening to an \\"event\\" album.
0439023491|5.0|After her defiance to play by the capital's rules in the last book, Katniss knows her days are numbered. So, when President Snow shows up in her house to threaten her, it doesn't come at a complete shock. She allows her puppet strings to be pulled in hopes of saving her family. However, whether she likes it or not, she has become the face of the rebellion. To make matters worse, Katniss and Peeta, as well as 22 other former victors are thrown back into the games. Katniss vows to do everything she possibly can to make sure Peeta survives. He of course has the opposite desire and it will take everything both of them have to survive.<br /><br />The title is very fitting as this book is at root about the rebellion catching fire. In the beginning there were rumors of rebellion, but the actions of the capital throughout the book really started to add flame the fire. It is assumed that President Snow orchestrated for the victors to have to return to the games, something they were supposed to be safe from. Of course he claimed the creator of the games was the one who set this idea up, but even so he could have overruled it considering his power. I think this was a huge mistake, and only added fire to the rebellion he so very much wanted to squash. Not only did it infuriate the people in the districts, but it also upset the citizens of the capital, his pampered support. The citizens have a certain attachment to the victors, and the districts see them as symbols of hope. He decided to fight fire with fire, not such a wise choice in a situation like this. This mistake had the opposite effect of what he wanted causing the rebellion to gain ground.<br /><br />The love triangle theme continues through this book even though Gale is absent yet again for most of it. I do wish there had been more time spent on her tie to him. As it was written, we are forced to just accept the history and feel his side even though we are continually bombarded by Peeta's love and determination. It was frustrating to feel so much for Peeta, but not really have enough ground to stand on to care for Gale. This made it really hard to feel Katniss's struggle between the two. For this reason, I am glad that the romance was only a small part of the plot.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book, but not quite as much as I did the first one, as it would be almost impossible to live up to. The first game's horrors came at such a shock, but this time around I was left with a slight case of deja vu. Even so, I highly recommend this book.frustrating to feel so much for Peeta, but not really have enough ground to stand on to care for Gale.

1416972250|5.0|This book starts out with the whole gang preparing to go to the Shadowhunter city, Idris. Clary is going to seek out a warlock that knows how to wake her mother, while everyone else is going to talk about the brewing war. Jace of course, being the overprotective person he is, does everything he can to keep Clary from coming, and he almost succeeds. When she arrives, Jace, being the fool he is, does everything he can to get her to leave. I have to say that I was surprised that Clary believed the cruel things he said. She should have known he was just trying to protect her by getting her out of the city.<br /><br />There were plenty of heartbreaking moments in this book. It seemed like everyone's relationship came to a head. I won't go into detail as to not spoil the book, but there is one relationship I can talk about as this event happens in the very beginning of the book. Simon, for once, did the smart thing. He broke off the romance between himself and Clary. She was only trying to forget her feelings for Jace as well as trying to not lose Simon. She needs him, just not in the way he wants her too. I was really glad Simon realized it was better to have her in whatever way was real then a faked or forced romance. That definitely showed a major maturity on his part.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book, and I just couldn't put it down. It was just as captivating as the first two books. While most things were tied up at the end of this book, there were some events that left unanswered questions. I look forward to reading the future books, seeing more in their world, and finding out how the new changes effect all the characters.
B003HC8I5M|1.0|Wow, I had hopes for this, but his voice has really gone south. These are Motown classics wherein the originals not only had tight arrangements and backing (which this CD does on occasion), but possessed some the most incredible vocals to come from that era. His vocals are soft, average and pretty uninspired for such a \\"labor of love\\" project. I can only give \\"Do I Love You\\" (how can you screw up a Ronettes song?) and the title track (some of the most beautiful lyrics by Carole King) 2 thumbs up. As for the rest of this CD, leave the oldies cover jobs to singers like Michael McDonald and Joan Osborne who DO express \\"white blue-eyed soul\\".
1416955070|5.0|Clary is a 15 year old girl who has a \\"crazy\\" mom that seems extremely overprotective. However, Clary quickly realizes that there may have been a reason for all this when she starts to see things other people can't see. When her mother is taken, she is thrust into a world with shadowhunters, demons, vampires, and other creatures. Clary must quickly seek the truth to her heritage and past, if she is to have any hope in rescuing her mother as well as any hope for her own survival. There are plenty of twists and turns that will leave Clary with the knowledge that while she may want to, there is no going back to the way life was before. She will be forever changed.<br /><br />For most of this book, I seemed to realize things long before Clary did. Usually, a clueless character would annoy me, but that definitely isn't the case in this book. The reader's prior knowledge was just enough to keep away confusion and suck them into the characters. I love Jace's character. He acts so sarcastic and concieted, but you can really see all of that is a front to hide his real feelings. He has been through so much and lost even more, so he shuts everyone out, refusing to let himself care. Well, that is until Clary comes along. Something about the two of them just seems to ignite the other. They really bring out the best and worst in each other.<br /><br />Its funny how sometimes the cover of a book can be the determination on whether to give a book a shot. I was in the bookstore the other day, not somewhere I get very often on account of the kiddos, and I saw this book. Absently, I remembered seeing it before on other blogs, but I have to say the images do not do the real cover justice. I don't know why I'm so drawn to them, but I think the covers for this series are some of the best I've seen in a long time. They are really captivating and are honestly the biggest reason I decided to read them.<br /><br />I'm not usually a big fan of fallen angels and nephilim books. Well, I guess that isn't entirely true as I have enjoyed some of the ones I've read. It would be more accurate to say that they aren't usually my first choice. However, I can honestly say I am very glad I read this book. I absolutely loved it! I was on the edge of my seat the entire time and was hopelessly sucked in. The only \\"bad\\" thing I can say about the book would be the shocking twist at the end. Its one of those that leaves you just hoping its all a trick because you don't believe the author could really be that cruel. Hopefully future books will resolve this issue, but even if they don't the book was still amazing, and I highly recommend it.rue as I have enjoyed some of the ones I've read.

0439023513|5.0|In this book, Katniss finds herself yet again as a pawn for someone else. District 13 wants to manipulate and use her to fuel the rebellion. Katniss has had about all that she can stand, but she knows a pawn is only as good as its usefulness. When she sets out to be the Mockingjay, she does it because she feels it is right, but as things go on, she starts to question everyone's motives. District 13 is nothing like she expected and their strict regime and rules are extremely oppressing. Is it really worth it to fight the capital to only pass the chains of bondage to another \\"master?\\"<br /><br />It seems the previous events have finally caught up and we see a much more fragile version of Katniss in this book. When I first read it, I was slightly annoyed at the change in character, but now looking back I can only see it as realistic. The horrors she lived through are not something that you forget easily. They change you, shape you, and eventually break you. Many times Katniss did snap under the pressure, but somehow she still hung on by a thread to her sanity.<br /><br />I was glad to see more of Gale in this book, as I didn't feel a strong connection to him. By the way Katniss described him, he was always strong and rebellious. However, in this book, after seeing District 12 burn before his eyes, his anger becomes a wildfire. He turns into a calculating, detached soldier, who has lost most of his compassion. He truly believes in the phrase \\"All's fair in love and war.\\"  Even Katniss who is a very calculating rather than emotional person doesn't have the ability to kill mindlessly.<br /><br />There rarely is a happy ever after when it comes to war, and this book is no exception. I am glad I waited a few days to review this, my review would have been much different if I hadn't. When I first finished the book, all I felt was despair and anger for the shambles the characters were left in. Now, looking back, everything fits, it all has its purpose. War is not pretty, it is not kind, and it spares no one. Even the ones who survive will be irrevocably altered.<br /><br />I recommend this book, just don't read it expecting a happy ending. It really shows the gritty horrors of war and the knowledge of no matter the outcome, nothing will ever be the same. I would suggest reading the book and then waiting a day or two before making any opinions on it. You will probably find your feelings will change after the despair settles. It definitely did not take the direction I was expecting, but that does not in anyway diminish it. I have a feeling these books will be talked about for years to come.spares no one.

0765326353|3.0|Let me start off by saying I am a HUGE fan of Sanderson's other work.  His stand-alone books (Warbreaker, Elantris) are quite simply the best examples of the fantasy stand-alone genre (admittedly a somewhat rare one!) that I've ever read.  I also enjoyed his Mistborn trilogy, as well, although I did find that it tended to slow down and wander some towards the end.    That being said, I wanted to love Way of Kings.  I truly did.  Sanderson is a gifted writer and the promise of a ten-book long series by him is an extremely enticing one, especially given the prolific nature of his writing.  Unfortunately, though, I have been reading Way of Kings and I am simply not impressed.  I'm about 300 pages into the book by now, and it's almost a chore for me to pick it up and start reading it again.    The main problem is that Sanderson tries to create a HUGE fantasy world for the reader to enjoy and it is simply overwhelming.  There are too many specific cultural references that make no sense.  Some of them do, and that's great, but most of them are just words on a page that are completely meaningless and confusing.  Sanderson made the mistake of starting out with three distinct characters, all in different parts of the world, and each with a different cultural reference point, and it is simply too much.  Foreshadowing is one thing, but overwhelming your reader is quite another.    Don't get me wrong- I did enjoy the world he created as far as it went, and there are some extremely intriguing elements to it.  It's just too much, too quickly.  Even Robert Jordan, whom Sanderson has taken over the WoT from, started out his epic series from a local reference point and then gradually broadened it as he went.  The first 4-5 books of that series were extremely engaging, but unfortunately Jordan got carried away in his own work and the entire series was slowly descending into utter chaos by the time he died.    Sanderson's work is nowhere near as bad as Jordan's last few books were, because at least it tries to keep some focus with three main characters.  However, the other main problem (at least for me) is that this particular book is very dark.  A lot of times, it's just depressing to read.  There's little humor, overall, and the characters are constantly oppressed, depressed, crazy, broke, angry, etc.  Yes, drama is needed to keep the plot moving, but Sanderson overdoes it, in my opinion.  It reminds me a bit of Terry Goodkind's The Sword of Truth series, although it's not quite as dark as those books are.    I feel like Sanderson was trying to create a realistic fantasy world with balanced characters where a lot of tension still remained.  He could take some tips from George RR Martin in that regard, who is undeniably a master at world-building.  What Sanderson fails to do which Martin does so well (in between killing off characters) is alternate the darkness with enough light to balance it out.  It's odd, because Sanderson did a fairly ood job at that in his stand-alones and the Mistborn trilogy, but I just don't see that balance here.    It's quite possible that the book improves past the first 300 pages, but if an author hasn't drawn me in with that much writing I don't really feel any need to keep going.  Sanderson's prose flows very nicely and he does create strong overall characters.  The world is nice and it's solid writing all around.  The artwork is some of the best I've ever seen in a book, as well.  And really, if you like epic, dark fantasy (ie Goodkind), you'll probably enjoy this work quite a bit.      As for me, I like my fantasy to be a bit lighter and a whole lot more coherent.  I think I'll stay away from this series and hope he finishes it quickly so he can get back to writing his solo books!
B001FB55I0|1.0|The movie is not what I have come to expect from a terminator movie.  I think that all the Terminator movies had a story line that was pretty plausible for an everyday event that could happen.  That coupled along with some points along the way that can only be overcome with some major action.  I guess without Arnold Schwarzenegger I should have already known there would not be much good action.<br /> The entire movie is all about the big `Time Paradox' that brings the `John Conner' guy into existence.  How he sent his father back to his mom.  And if he doesn't do this then he will not `be'.  Arnold does make a walk on appearance toward the end but it is really nothing.  I guess I watched it so I can join in the conversation whenever this title is up for discussion.  Just don't expect any action.  It's not a `fun' kill em' all kind of film; but rather a complex theoretical kind of head trip.

0060558121|4.0|This was a fun and easy book to read. I didn't want to put it down mostly because it was such an interesting book but also because it was relaxing. The vocabulary is simple and the plot fairly simple to follow. However it twists and winds in a non-confusing way, very obviously keeping information hidden from the main character, Shadow.<br /><br />Either way, this was a simple enjoyable book I could see re-reading a few times in the future.

B003PIUBZS|5.0|Recently, while watching a movie, a trailer for a different film called my attention. It had almost the same awesome production design and photography of \\"300,\\" a picture that I truly enjoyed. It turned out that the trailer was not about a film; rather, it was about a TV original series. And what a find it was! \\"Spartacus - Blood and Sand, the Complete First Season\\" is what grandiose and majestic entertainment is all about.    The DVD set features all thirteen episodes from the first season, each one approximately fifty minutes long. It properly begins from the beginning, when we first meet Spartacus (not his name at the time), inside a dirty cell, just before he goes out and fight for his life as a gladiator in front of thousands of people that enjoy the killing and dismembering of other human beings. While sitting alone, he begins remembering the conditions that took him there in first place. We are taken back to those happy years, when he enjoyed the love of his wife Sura (Erin Cummings), but his town was always in constant danger from the enemy. Unwillingly, his people - The Thracian -- form an alliance with the Romans, who also happen to share the same enemy (the Getae). Unfortunately, the Romans betray their allies, and Spartacus and his wife are separated, both becoming slaves. Spartacus is sent to Capua, in Italy, where he is ordered to be slaughtered in the gladiator arena. However, he survives and quickly becomes a commodity in the gladiator market.  Although still a slave, he apparently has the opportunity of getting his freedom back one day, depending on his success as a gladiator.    Spartacus is then sent to a ludus, a place where gladiators are trained, owned by the manipulative and brutal Batiatus (John Hannah), who prides himself of having the best gladiators in Capua. His right-hand man, also a slave, is Doctore (Peter Mensah), an impressive African and ex-gladiator who is in charge of training. Spartacus reluctantly accepts to become a gladiator,but accepts after Batiatus promises him to reunite him with his wife. From then on, seeing his wife again is Spartacus' main motivation in life. What follows, then, is the history of Spartacus as a gladiator and all the things that he has to endure to survive. Each episode is unique, in which new characters are added or eliminated, and some we get to know very well. There are friendships and envies, love and lust, trust and backstabbing -- the entire package that provides for a good series.    \\"Spartacus - Blood and Sand, the Complete First Season\\" is meant to introduce us to the Spartacus made famous on film by Kirk Douglas, and the series focuses on his early, formative years, and how he became a leader in the uprising of the slaves against the Roman Empire. But, contrary to the movie version, this series is crude and very much realistic, as well as for mature audiences, with as much blood as you care to see, with plenty nudity and sexual situations, just the way it was during those gruesome years. At the same time, we learn history the hard way. Andy Whitfield shines as Spartacus, as well as the rest of the formidable cast, including Manu Bennett, Lucy Lawless and Nick E. Tarabay. It's all great, addictive entertainment. The DVD set is loaded with extras, like audio commentaries, behind-the-scenes, gladiator boot camps, and much, much more. (USA, 2010, color, 692 mins).

B0031X3DHU|5.0|Swivel sweepers are the best thing since sliced bread!  We use ours in our vacation home on tile floors.  With young toddlers visiting, we were concerned about the cleanliness of the floors.  Our test was to use a regular vacuum, followed by one of the 'chemical' throw away mop cloths.  That should have cleaned the floor.  However, when we used the Swivel Sweeper after doing the other two things, the Swivel picked up a lot of dirt...even dust bunnies!!  We were pleasantly surprised at how well it worked.  The battery allows us to do all of our condo twice before recharging.  The bathrooms get done daily.  With the price as low as it is - we would recommend that anyone with any kind of a hard floor ie tile, vinyl, or hardwood get at least one of these.  BTW you can also use it on carpet..just wears down the battery more quickly!
0525951652|1.0|I have to agree with the other Kindle-user reviewers about the ridiculousness of the price of this book.  While a new, unknown author would have no clout with the publisher, surely someone like Follett would, and should.      I've put myself on the list at my library for the book.  And I won't buy it from Audible as I believe Amazon has a vested interest in the company.
B00123IATW|5.0|This album, Yes's third is a quantum leap forward for Yes - and we have King Crimson to thank for it.... Bill Bruford & other members of the band (I forget whom) saw King Crimson in concert and that shock to the system musically lifted the band to near perfection on this LP. Bruford in particular was smitten to the point of later joining King Crimson (as you all know). I am a drummer & pay very close attention to drum parts & if you listen to the \\"In The Court of The Crimson King\\" CD the drums are very fluid yet aggressive, jazz rock (and totally WONDERFUL,~ WAY ahead of their time!)...so anyway, Bill was influenced in that direction and all of the Bruford era Yes albums greatly benefited. This is also the first Yes album with Steve Howe on guitar and his influence cannot be underestimated.... a must have, stand the test of time recording.
B003UYUQZW|4.0|The Prince of Persia, Sands of Time. Is a nice little movie that, could have been a much better summer movie that it was.  I know what Disney was trying to do. It was trying for another Pirates of the Caribbean series success. Well it missed the mark entirely!  For all his cuteness and sex appeal, in this instance Jake Gyllenhaal is no Johnny Depp. Depp was made to play the role of Capt. Jack Sparrow.     Just as he was ideal for the role of Sweeny Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street!   Gyllenhaal however could only mug and flex for the camera. He had no real sense of comic timing, which would've made his role much more enjoyable.    The plot line wasn't well written either. There could have been a little more creativeness to it than just the \\"Evil Uncle\\" plot device.   And finally, there's the fact that, not all video games make good movie adaptations. Case in point, the Street Fighter movie. The first movie was a near flop and the second was a flop!              So I give the movie 4 stars. Only because it was a nice idea, that could have been better! I think Disney will have better luck with The Sorcerer's Apprentice !
B002MRROKI|2.0|This sounds good, if you like heavily compressed audio and fake, added-in applause and cheers.  This release is heavily edited, with things like the band talking in between songs, and part of smells like teen spirit's opening cut off.

0374158460|4.0|Self-acclaimed literature is nearly impossible to review, due in large part to the nebulous nature of the category. \\"Literature\\" is ill-defined, whose boundaries shift for any number of reasons, least among which is whether the first letter is capitalized in normal usage.    On what basis can these books be judged? One possible course of action would be to set Freedom in a ring with Great Expectations and Middlesex to let them duke it out among themselves -- but that would just leave us with Free Great Sex, and there's not a public library in the world that'll be able to stock that title without a load of grief.    Jonathan Franzen has it let it be known his book is intended to be interred among the ranks of literary fiction, for the high-minded to fawn over now and the teenagers of the future to be bored by later. Setting the intent of this self-aggrandizement aside, readers and reviewers alike must take care to frame the novel appropriately.    To do this, one must look to the title: Freedom. Ultimately, freedom -- and, by extension, Freedom -- comes down to choices. Difficult choices, no-brainers, impossible choices and choices that are made for you. The title, like with his earlier work (The Corrections) before it, is as much about helping the reader keep the novel's purpose in mind as much as it is to sell more copies. The meandering, often disjointed story can be reined in by making sure the theme is at the forefront of your thoughts. It's especially necessary because freedom is, at its core, a completely empty word. Essentially, it's a stand-in for \\"limitless choice,\\" aka \\"everything.\\" And while everything is the opposite of nothing, it's just as amorphous and chaotic a concept.    The plot of Freedom, such as it is, centers around the Berglunds, a Minnesota nuclear family going through more than their share of bewildering circumstances they must face up to or ignore, at their pleasure. It's not really possible to plot the arc of the story, except to say thatthe main characters seem to be the heads of this particular household, with the husband, Walter, more central to the focus than the wife, Patty. Walter is a man deeply devoted to his wife, who adulates in his attention and loves him in return for it. Their children are quite complicated beings, though Jessica, the oldest, does not appear in the story in any meaningful way until much later.    Joey, the younger son, occupies a much more prominent role both in the story and the lives of the two main characters -- fiercely independent (he moves out of the family home before his 17th birthday to live with the neighbors, where his girlfriend happens to reside) while at the same time not entirely comfortable cutting off all ties to his parents. There's infinitely more to the story, but a fear of spoilers and a concern for space prohibit me from even listing all the main characters.    The plot, though somewhat easy to follow, is extraordinarily complex. Like Corrections, the book does not track in a strictly chronological order. This does not hamper comprehensibility too much, but it does require a bit of thinking to keep a finger on when and where various events occur, especially when focus shifts from one character to the next.    The hallmark of the modern Serious Novel can be found in the tribulations -- sometimes more bewildering and unlikely than your average episode of The Young and the Restless -- its characters must suffer. It's tempting to think the author has confused \\"voluminous\\" problems for \\"interesting\\" ones, but luckily the book's strength lies more in how the characters react to various outlandish circumstances than the situations themselves.    Of course, to take the mantle of literature a work must shoulder the load of society's burdens, to tackle the big ideas that plague our collective consciousness. 9/11. two wars, disaffected youth, the pretentiousness of disaffected youth, the middle-aged condescension toward the pretentiousness of disaffected youth, the youthful indifference toward the middle-aged condescension ... even selling out, which I'm not 100 percent certain exists as a concept even in the abstract anymore.    Luckily for him -- and for us readers -- Franzen doesn't even attempt to provide answers but rather seeks understanding, exploration in lieu of explanation. Part of the reasoning for this is almost certainly pragmatic, as definitive diagnoses and prescriptions can be disagreed with, countered or even dismissed. But part surely must lie, as with all things in the book, rooted in the central idea of freedom. To proclaim a solution is to inhibit the freedom of the readers to judge and choose, and to provide an answer on our own.    The characters are remarkably fleshed-out and one of the best aspects of Franzen's work. Psychology has replaced metaphor and simile as the literary devices used to drive home a universal truth or compelling point authors want to get across. Where Nathaniel Hawthorne spent an entire chapter crafting a synecdoche about a bush growing next to a prison door, Franzen and other modern writers dig deeply into the motivations, the worries, the fears and the thought processes behind a character's actions. These insights are especially poignant when the characters themselves seem incognizant of their own reasoning; the specificity actually provides more opportunities to interpret rather than limiting possible explanations, as one might expect.    From a prosaic standpoint, there's a noticeable difference from Corrections. Where before a 100-plus-word, single-sentence metaphor might be thrown in to illustrate how the character has trouble forgetting, Freedom saves the run-on sentences for advancing plot -- or, failing that, at least fleshing out the scene further.    The writing is not without its flaws, however. A significant portion of the first chunk of the book is a third-person autobiographical portrait of Patty -- despite ostensibly being written in her hand, there's not much difference between it and the authorial lugubriousness exhibited by Franzen. It's an uneven bit of writing Franzen rather awkwardly backforms by having other characters praise her writing abilities, but this praise occurs only after we've completed the manuscript -- which none of the other characters have read. It's a bit like if Transformers 3 suddenly introduces the fact that Sam is actually half-fish, and for the rest of the movie has the other characters note, \\"Man, he always was a really good swimmer\\" despite the entire movie taking place deep in the Sahara. Additionally, double negatives pepper the novel to create a slightly more effete tone to the writing, which is not un-annoying.    As far as recommendations go, Freedom is not going to be for everyone. It can probably be enjoyed passively, eyes jumping from work to word and sentence to sentence, but it's going to be a slog. Instead, if you're looking for a book to engage with and think about, you'll find a worthy opponent in Freedom. As to its qualifications as literature, no one can speak to it with any -- meaningful -- authority. But then, even when the American Society of People Who Decide What Literature Is (this is not a euphemism for \\"Oprah\\") comes down on one side or the other, you still have the freedom to ignore them and form your own judgment
B003E8GQ76|4.0|I've never been more confounded by a movie. I'm saying this years later. After reading many reviews of Up In The Air,I suppose it tries to say too much, has too many loose ends. It could work as a cute romance between Vera and George's character and it would be better than most such comedies today, or it could be a slam against corporate America, or a character study about the road not taken (and believe it or not, I like the road George's character took, like the poem. I also want that to be the meaning of the movie; but then again, on more than one occasion, I've been told I think too much). Reitman has the same problem in Juno, and the conflict seems to be deciding how to survive modern life, another theme in this movie. If the great soundtrack tells us the meaning, it's to have compassion for the overconfident, the undecided, the stereotype. (For some reason, amazon.com notes I wrote this 2010, when it is actually 2017!)
0525951652|1.0|With the rewards programs at the bookstores and discounts stores like Target, Costco, etc., it's cheaper to buy the book.  Kindle prices are getting out of line.  Charging so much for popular books is just taking advantage of the consumer.
0451228375|5.0|So you enjoyed Pillars of the earth, you can't wait to get your hands on the sequel (Especially as unlike others you won't have to wait 20 years for Ken Follett to write it!). I'm here to tell you that you shouldn't wait. Order it now without fear of disappointment.    Rarely does a sequel come close to recapturing what was so special about the first book/movie, what Follett achieves with World without end is spectacular.    All the families from Pillars are again represented but generations down the line. How have the families fared and what dastardly deeds and plots are being weaved?    But for the time gap, World without end carries on where Pillars left off and some might be put off by that.. some of the storyline seems very familiar, everyone fighting for survival and to better their station in life.. for me it was like putting on a comfortable pair of shoes, familiar, cozy and enjoyable.    Ken Follett could write another 5 novels just like this and I'd enjoy them all. Epic story telling at it's best.
B003U9V6A6|5.0|Just got this CD today and I can't tell you how many times I've listened to it all the way through. The songs get better the more you listen and the lyrics are so meaningful. I showed my 16 year old and she loved it too! I had only heard the one song \\"For The First Time\\" when I ordered the CD. I still love that one but \\"Nothing\\" is also a favorite of mine. Each song is like a story. I'm so glad I purchased from Amazon and didn't wait until a US release.
B001EN71CW|5.0|After reading here, arguably the best ratings ever for a TV series, I decided to get a copy myself.  I'm a huge Star Trek fan, mainly for it's futuristic view of humanity once we are able to achieve efficient space travel. (Of course, the myriad collection of starships and techno babbles are fun as well)    The founder/visionary of Star Trek, Gene Roddenberry, sold Star Trek to network as \\"Western\\" in space. While the humor and style of original crew was like typical western TVs in the 1960s, I find Firefly a much truer \\"wild, wild west\\". It's nice seeing through the eyes of people fight-for-survival deep in space in alien communities, rather than from the eyes of Starfleet crew.    I'm still bigger fan of Star Trek, but I'm glad I bought Firefly and thoroughly enjoyed it. Too bad it's canceled. Some obvious mysteries on the characters to be unfolded later that never did and never will (e.g., is the Reverend a high level official of the Alliance undercover?)  There were enough hints along the way.
0525951652|5.0|About the book: Yes, somewhat predictable, but a great read. I can't wait to read it again, and look forward to the next installment!     As to the title of my review: Please leave a review for the actual product you are leaving a review about. This is not a forum and is NOT the place to gripe about Amazon pricing or the boycotting of Kindles. I'm tired of sifting through the non-product related complaining bunk to find \\"REAL\\" product reviews.       Thank you!
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|Thought it only made sense to give this a whirl as I've read all the Austen books numerous times and seen all the other productions.  I was never a big Keira Knightley fan, but after this . . .  What's worse, I was completely baffled by Donald Sutherland's performance, especially at the end.  The engagement scene between him and Lizzy made it look as though perhaps psychotropic medications had come too late for Mr. Bennet.  There's so little of Jane Austen's intent and so little left of the characters, they basically borrowed some names and an ending.  I was appalled at the shot of the pig testicles, and I knew at that point we had the commercially-mauled version of a classic.  Jane Austen was a phenomenal writer, and her characters were well developed, and this film can not explain ANY of its characters or their actions.  But they were apparently not creative enough to make up their own story and leave Jane Austen's memory in peace.
B003PIUC02|5.0|I just finished the first 3 episodes and man did I get hooked on already! It's got action, blood/gore and sex! It'll keep your heart pumping at all times!
B003MZ0I84|5.0|This is a fantastic CD. The musicianship is great and Adam Levine's singing is at its best. Listen to it through headphones--there's a lot going on in these songs. I particularly like \\"I Can't Lie,\\" a mellow, Marvin Gaye sort of sound. It's beautiful. And the album grows on you, rather than becoming tiresome, with repeated listening.
B003YBNRHU|5.0|This is a great album with great songs! The Doobies are back! This is the way they are supposed to sound. MUCH better than their previous album \\"Sibling Rivalry\\" which had some good stuff on it, but was disappointing. Hopefully they won't wait 10 more years to make another one! Don't hesitate - buy this CD!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have seen in many years. I bought this after seeing the movie on TV b/c I loved it so much. I watched it again as soon as I received it and cried again. It is heartwarming and despite the simple story very complex in terms of the emotions it brings out. It is a great story of tremendous love and loyalty - although it is sad mainly b/c the other humans in Hachi's life aren't very loyal to him despite his loyalty. But, there is also a deeply spiritual message - especially the way it ends.  It is simply a great movie - the kind that affects you for a long time. I highly recommend this. And if you are a dog or animal lover add a star. If you aren't, you will be by the end of this movie. The fact that is based on a true story only makes it even better.  My two cents,  Henry
B003E6FW5A|5.0|Miklos Rozsa's Oscar winning score has now been released, almost complete,on this 2 disc set. It does lack one item, on disc 1, the fanfare music heralding Messala's arrival into Jerusalem is missing. The last DVD release with the \\"music only\\" of course, has the missing piece.This is the only fault with this fabulous release and unless a potential buyer is expecting to hear this item,like a purist,this part of the review is aimed at them.But as to the rest of the release, it is superb. If this is your sort of musical heaven then you could't do any better than getting yourself a copy. It comes with an elaborate full-color booklet, and the score on 2 discs in beautiful stereo, along with tons of outakes not used in the movie itself and well worth the investment. Personally, I'm waiting for the dvd (done properly) of Sodom and Gomorrah to get a release, hopefully on Blu-Ray with extras would be nice.
0670021652|5.0|Great read!  I thought it would be boring, but decided to give it a try since I really enjoyed Gilbert's \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\".  Wow, does this author have a gift for writing! She comes up with these incredible insights while encountering issues regarding marriage and to some extent women's rights.  The author's own personal story is an interesting saga.  And the episodes she encounters along the way were very touching.  I laughed and cried, and I think those who have no interest in marriage will still find this book an enjoyable read.
0312600844|1.0|Wow, I am just shocked at the waste of time spent on this book. I thought there would maybe perhaps be a message at the end or at least get into the story by the middle of the book, but I got nothing out of it.  I can't believe a book about stealing each other's wives/husbands and cheating and children hating their parents can make it to a best seller's list.  I can easily call this the worst book I have read in 2010.  Not recommended.
B002HNA95E|4.0|I ordered this CD used on Amazon and the first disc does not have the correct track list order.  I have not been able to find anyone online listing the same problem.  All the tracks listed on the disc are included, but the track list order on my Disc 1 is as follows:    01. 4 Mintues  02. Borderline  03. Erotic  04. Everybody  05. Express Yourself  06. Holiday  07. Hung Up  08. Into the Groove  09. Justify My Love  10. Like a Prayer  11. Like a Virgin  12. Music  13. Open Your Heart  14. Ray of Light  15. Revolver  16. Secret  17. Sorry  18. Vogue    Disc 2 is right on.  All things considered this is a nice collection of Madonna songs.  I'm not a huge fan, but she has some good pop songs.  I would have liked to see a couple more included and maybe some other lesser known songs dropped.  I'll Remember, Jump, American Life, and Mother and Father would be valued additions in my opinion.  Otherwise no complaints and a lot of songs for a reasonable price.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|hey, what can i say? Jensen Ackles! That is almost enough! He's hot, he's sexy, he's cool! And the gag reel are soooooo funny! It's one of the best serie all over the world!
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I'm joining the one-star reviewers.  My wife bought the Kindle edition and when I saw the price was $19.99 I went to the Amazon web site to compare it to the hardbound cost.  I was amazed to find the hardbound (brand new) was cheaper than the Kindle version ($19.80 vs. $19.99).  Come on, is this a market test by Dutton Adult, the publisher?  Maybe it's an intelligence test.  We like Follett and have read most of his works, but we won't be making this mistake again.    Jeff Bezos, you can't set the price, but you sure could refuse to offer the book.  \\"When all is said and done, much more is said than done.\\"  Do something.
1453624910|5.0|This little book is composed of four original short stories by Lynn Flewelling, and fan generated artwork. People, don't quail at the thought of fan art! 99% of the illustrations in this book are good to truly outstanding. There is also a satisfying variation in style among the drawings.   The stories are the \\"glimpses\\" into the lives of Seregil and Alec. Each tale serves to supply details of particular life changing events in the Nightrunner's lives. There is a piece about how and why Seregil became Nysander's apprentice; a poignant exposition concerning the meeting of Alec's parents; Seregil's encounter with Micum, who would become a life long friend; and of course, the piece de resistance, Seregil's bonding with Alec. All four vignettes are virtual snapshots of each character's emotional and physical place in the world at a specific time and do not feel extraneous, but rather round the characters out even further.   The excerpt at the end of the book from the forthcoming (in 2011) Nightrunners novel is humorous and tantalizing.  All in all, a very satisfying read, and extremely well priced.
B001KL3GWM|5.0|The first thing I noticed about Already Free was the liner notes.  The two longest tenured members of the band (besides Derek), Yonrico Scott and Todd Smalley, were replaced  on four songs by Tyler Greenwell on drums and Ted Pecchio or Oteil Burbridge on bass.  The change of personnel on this album was a harbinger of things to come.  The Derek Trucks Band is currently nine months into a hiatus that will extend through 2010, probably 2011, and possibly beyond.  My favorite songs are the Bob Dylan cover, Down in the Flood, and I Know.  The low point is Doyle Bramhall's vocals in Maybe This Time.  I like his voice, but his singing is best enjoyed in small doses.  Mike Mattison is outstanding again, as he was on Songlines.    This album is similar to the previous Derek Trucks Band albums to the extent that, like the previous albums, it is different from the albums that preceded it.  I like that.  For too many bands, the songs sound too much the same after a short while.   I like the addition of trumpet, tenor sax and trombone, which creates a full bodied sound without creating clutter.  I miss Kofi's flute, though.  All the songs are good.  This is an album that gets listened to.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|Wow, I watched this movie earlier to refresh my memory, and it's such a beautiful love story that will warm your heart. Belle is an unusual woman who loves reading books and wants a life outside her village. When her father goes missing, she arrives to the castle of the Beast. Belle offers to become the Beast's prisoner if he releases her father. (The Beast was cursed years ago by an enchantress. Unless someone falls in love with him as a beast, he will remain that way forever) I love how he starts out as seeming like a monster, but he turns out nice and he protects her from wolves and a hunter named Gaston. Will Belle fall in love with the Beast before the last rose petal falls? I highly recommend BEAUTY AND THE BEAST!!!
B002YIHO7I|5.0|Sade, expolring her emergence on this wicked Earth, is seemingly a very fragile soul.<br />She knows, from album to album, how exactly to investigate her scars, tattos and injuries through the service as an all-time soldier, soldier of love.<br />Her wonderful, sensual voice sounds as angelic as it could be, with this alto whispering soulful notes, that no other singer can ever produce from a mouth.<br />From a song to another, she shows us her past 10 years and the nowadays: her past relationships (which finished no so great) in Moon & The Sky; her 'anthem' Soldier Of Love, a song of warrior in a battle where no-one can be a winner; her wonderful child, a daughter, Ila, who loves her 'new' father even more than her original one; in Long Hard Road we hear her prayer for every problem to get away..and everything else. Bring Me Home, an amazing deep poetry of Sade Adu, even closer now to something like Gypsy song, which view her struggles in the thoroughfare.<br />...<br />This album is absolutely must for everyone who is keen on the real music, with real emotions.<br />I'm telling it as a long-time Sade fan and more than that, as a big aficionado of the natural real Art!
B003R0LBVW|3.0|I finished this book yesterday and am left with no memorable characters or scenes. For all that Walter and Richard are supposed to love and desire Patty, I could find nothing attractive, desirable, or particularly interesting about her. Likewise every other character in the book.<br /><br />The political rants went on too long.  At times I wanted to stop reading altogether.  Boring.<br /><br />This is not the first book from Oprah's Book Club that I found disappointing.  We clearly have different tastes. No more Oprah picks for me.

However, I can use an older copy of PowerDVD to play it on my PC and everything is smooth as silk.  I don't know why WMP doesn't like that disc, but I'm not too worried about it since PowerDVD will play it just fine.  The 2nd disc also contains an authorized digital copy of the movie (I didn't expect this).

6305428220|4.0|One of the better SCREAM offshoots, THE FACULTY succeeds at being an excellent 90s high school version of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS w/ enough paranoia, terror, and humour to keep things interesting. The cast is unbelievable, including Clea Duvall (HOW TO MAKE A MONSTER, THE KILLING ROOM), Josh Hartnett (HALLOWEEN H2O, 30 DAYS OF NIGHT), Framke Janssen (LORD OF ILLUSION), Elijah Wood (THE ICE STORM, LOTR, SIN CITY), Robert Patrick (TERMINATOR 2, EYE SEE YOU), Piper Laurie (RUBY, CARRIE), and Salma Hayek (FROM DUSK TILL DAWN) as the school nurse! This movie proves what we've always suspected, that our teachers are human hosts for alien parasites! This explains a lot! We also learn that illegal drugs are the salvation of mankind. The alien invaders just can't handle them! Whew! THE FACULTY is fun-tastic! Cheers...
097747609X|5.0|There is a possibility that Hitler may not have even written 'Mein Kampf' word for word and as modern publishers say \\"as told to\\" or by \\"AH and so and so\\". If this is correct this \\"so and so\\" is Rudolf Hess. Like the \\"Hitler Diaries\\" controversy proved Hitler as a writer was disorganized and as having an artist mentality was lazy. Hitler though ws a master orator and Hess literally was his secretary  and wrote copious notes and filled in his own words much of the material.  AH said later he regretted it was ever published.

0805027009|2.0|I learned about the book 'Bury My Heart and Wounded Knee' in my college history class and was intrigued. especially living in Minnesota and being able to trace a small part of my lineage to the Dakota of Minnesota. After looking at a copy of the book at a nearby used book store I knew I had to have it. After receiving this particular book from Amazon I was in for a surprise. It was then when I noticed the subtitle on the book. \\"Adapted for young readers.''<br /><br />I figured that meant nothing more than simplifying the reading so younger readers could understand it. One problem, it Also meant that not Everything that is in the book 'Bury my heart at wounded knee' is in this book. I don't know the exact extent yet of what was left out but all I know is the part I specifically wanted the book for was not in there. In the original there is a chapter on 'Little Crow's war'. This is concerning the Dakota Uprising in Minnesota in 1862. A significant event when it comes to Native American/White Settler/U.S. Government relations. But an even completely left out of this book. To say I was disappointed would be an understatement.<br /><br />The rest of the book is still informative but quite a let down to expect something that should be in the book, but wasn't. So be wary and realize that if you want to read all of Dee Brown's book then you need to buy 'Bury my heart at wounded knee' and not an adaption.
B002ZG99A4|3.0|THE EXPENDABLES<br /><br />STARRING: Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, Steve Austin, Terry Crews, Eric Roberts, Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Sylvester Stallone<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Sylvester Stallone and Dave Callaham<br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Action<br />Release Date: 13 August 2010<br />Review Date: 21 September 2010<br /><br />I know I'm gonna confuse a lot of you with this one. I give Kick-Ass and Piranha favorable reviews without even blinking but can't do the same for The Expendables? Doesn't the title say it all, you may ask? What expectations could I have had of this film? Well, believe it or not, mine were pretty high. I know it's supposed to be a bunch of old dudes kicking butt and taking names, but unfortunately that just wasn't enough for me. Not when I've come to admire Sylvester Stallone as a filmmaker, the way I have.<br /><br />Stallone not only stars in The Expendables, but wrote and directed it as well; as he did his two previous films, Rambo and Rocky Balboa.  But those were far superior to this chunk of a mediocre mess. I'm all for action and killing, and had it not been a Stallone film, I may not have had any reservations at all. But it was a Stallone film and I know Stallone has a much better film in him.<br /><br />Where was the creativity and wit that we found in Rocky Balboa and Rambo? With the exception of a few laughs, the majority of the dialogue here was cheesy and badly written. Lame one-liner after another. And the cinematography wasn't great either. Shots are often filmed way too close and don't flow well with one another, a lot of times throwing the comedic timing off in scenes.<br /><br />Stallone stars as Barney Ross; the leader of a group of mercenaries known as `The Expendables'; and that's all we know about him or them; begin senseless killing! Who are they? Where did they come from? The movie doesn't care. Stallone is a master at hand crafting brilliantly thought-out characters like Rambo and Rocky. He was nominated for an Academy Award for writing the character of Rocky so superbly! So what the hell happened here?<br /><br />The one character in the film I did find some substance in was Mickey Rourke's character `Tool'. Rourke played him as good as we've seen him play any number of roles, and as was the case in Iron Man 2; I wish there were more Rourke. Tool comes into the story to finish up a gnarly tattoo on Barney's back. Before we can ask why it was never finished, he is done in a matter of maybe five seconds, and now we are really wondering what the hell could have possibly happened, to cause them to be unable to finish the tattoo. Anyway, Tool tells Barney a tale of his haunted past, that formed the only scene in the film with a heartbeat.<br /><br />Tool's dark secret drives Barney to embark on a hell-bent rage to save a girl, being held captive by a league of scum-bags powered by the movie's villain (Eric Roberts). But why? Why does Barney care about this girl? They spent maybe 8 seconds together and there is no depth to her character or his, let alone some sort of bond that they could have shared that would warrant such heroic behavior in the first place. Simply put, Tool's words send Barney on his quest. Okay, whatever. So we follow him and he is joined by his pals who include performances by Jason Statham, Jet Li, Randy Couture and Terry Crews; together making up `The Expendables.'<br /><br />It's an absolute bloodbath when they get there, and I do have to say that Stallone does at least get the action right. Very balls to the wall, and a ton of fun. The best action sequences in a long time, for sure. And God bless him on an awesome idea to throw all these studs into one big action flick; especially the cameos by Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br /><br />In short, the movie is like eating a big bag of cotton candy for dinner. It seems like a blast, and it's very tasty indeed; but you have a stomachache after.
0525951652|2.0|I was really looking forward to this book on my Kindle but I will not purchase it at this price. A thousand page book would have been so much easier to read on the kindle. Hopefully the publisher will pay attention to the uproar and set more rational pricing. Or everyone can just wait for the cracked version.
0545310601|2.0|I can't say much more than anyone else here did, except that I was hoping for something so much more.  Depressing, plodding, deaths seemingly thrown in for shock value, blah.
B000065U1N|5.0|Excellent, well balanced, gritty combat of today.<br /><br />I don't like war or taking antibiotics but sometimes they both are absolutely necessary. Black Hawk Down gives you a look into the reality of combat operations. While it is the all mighty US Military on an important mission, you see people just like you and me doing the best they can with what they've got. Like it often happens, the mission is screwed up from the top down. The top thinkers and planners did not do enough research on the hazards in this Somalia city and the little guys (combat troops) suffered for it. I think this movie has the best depiction of modern ground combat warfare while it also offers some insight as to \\"why\\" we go into these places and a look into the diversity of personalities that make up the mission teams. Some are strong \\"get the job done\\", some are weak and want to puke and some are just spun out through the whole thing.  I bought the video so I can sort of get a feel for what our combat troops have to live through in Iraq and Afghanistan (even though this is Somalia). It helped me to understand the importance of intervening to take out disgustingly corrupt rulers (they took the peoples food and just let them starve) but most of all I just love the thrill of ground combat strategies, and there is plenty of combat action.<br />  I  highly recommend this movie to everybody, especially those who think fixing the world is so easy. Next time you catch some illness, try NOT taking your antibiotics and see how far you get.
B0040YFR1Y|4.0|Let me start by saying that I grew up on the Predator films. The first Predator was my first favorite film. I was requesting to watch the VHS by name when I was barely three years old(say what you will about my upbringing lol). The second was a very solid sequel in my opinion because it did such a great job expanding the mythos and possibilities of the franchise. It had obvious problems, but it did a great job of making you understand the predators better.  But then came Alien VS Predator. Yeesh. Nothing about this movie was right. The predators being in the arctic, the aliens being stronger than Superman, the predators being morons, the humans being extremely annoying movie-stereotypes, all of it. It was trash in my honest opinion. Aliens VS Predator-Requiem was a step up, but not by much. The predator, dubbed The Wolf, was extremely cool, and the aliens acted more in character than they had in AVP, but the human characters again were movie-stereotypes and the movie was entirely too dark. I couldn't make out a lot of what was going on. It was like watching an episode from the first season of the X-Files, but worse.  But enough of that, this is a review for Predators, not its predecessors. I like using bullet-points, so here goes-    ~The cast was phenomenal. Adrien Brody is a great actor and always brings something new to his roles. Alice Braga does a very good job as his counterpart. Topher Grace delivers every line with a hard to define quality that just makes him likable. Louis Changchien was excellent in his role as the silently stoic bad ass. But Lawrence Fishburne was a little out of place and seemed forced in. He could have been made a more natural plot device had they fleshed out his character more. But aside from that, the cast works wonders for this film, much like the first Predator film.    ~The action was solid, delivering the goods, but it did feel a little too much like a tribute to the first Predator. Some parts pulled off the tribute better than others. Without spoiling anything, the \\"Billy Bear Showdown\\" sequence is actually pretty damn cool in Predators. And the film's equivalent of rolling around in mud for stealth to flank the predator was very clever.    ~The mythos was expanded upon, but branched out more so than elaborating on what was already there. Though that's not a bad thing. The predators in this movie are from a different \\"tribe\\" than the ones from the previous titles. This explains their differences in behavior such as abducting humans and taking them to their jungle instead of going to the humans' jungle. But the new predators are also different in appearance, suggesting a divergent path of evolution possibly like Vulcans and Romulans. And when unmasked the new predators are wicked, to say the least.    ~The plot was better than most action movies, and its not like the Predator movies need a complex and intricate plot to be worthwhile any how. The humans were abducted from Earth and dropped on this planet to be hunted. All of these humans are in fact killers themselves, making them very dangerous prey. Whereas previous targets for the predators have been chosen based on skills in combat and leadership, these people were chosen simply for their ability to kill others. Royce(Brody) reluctantly takes the role of leader to this group of murderers, but is more interested in his own safety than his team. Isabella(Braga) is the teams \\"moral compass\\" so to speak, and is usually in conflict with Royce's lack of morals and empathy. Edwin(Grace) is the outcast of the group as the only  normal person among them, seemingly picked by mistake. He also plays the comic relief to perfection. The rest of the characters fall into smaller roles and all play their parts in the classic breakdown from large group down to small group, being picked off by the predators. Noland(Fishburne), a years-long survivor on this planet, explains that these new predators and the predators we know from earlier films are at war. Thenew predators are leaner and meaner, and the \\"old\\" predators fight with honor. These people are just caught in their practice sessions.    What more is there to say? Predators easily trumps Predator 2, AVP and AVP-R as the best Predator sequel. If you liked the first then pick up Predators. It pays homage to the original but definitely carves out a spot in the franchise for itself.
1584282584|2.0|Just waste of money. It is boring and nothing interesting. I gave three stars because of quick shipping but now this book in my garbage.<br /><br />added:<br /><br />Yepp... I gave it two stars, my mistake but I wouldn't change it anyway( I added stars not for a book but for the shipping). Now in details why I gave this book bad review:<br />I find this book very boring after reading just a first few pages. Nevertheless, I read it till the end trying to find out why this book had so many good reviews . I spend my whole evening reading this book, what a waste of my time. I got the idea about bouncing flash from the first pages, also there were few comparing images which I liked, but why I had to read whole book if everything was said in the first few pages? author kept telling the same thing in different words over and over and over and I kept reading hoping that in the next chapter there is got to be something new...( no words for myself) I read it all, there is nothing else, just saying that you have to try to use bouncing flash from every possible angle. I don't know author personally as some of the revers said and maybe he is a good photographer I don't know, all I know is that I don't have his book anymore and have no regrets for throwing it. ( didn't sell it because I don't feel that somebody else should waste time reading this book) By the way, I bought at the same time another book, New School Wedding Photographer by Taylor Jackson, I already read it 3-4 times and it still on my table ( he also gave link for a website in his book where you could learn about flash). Have to say that I just loved that book: personal, funny and most importantly it is very informative.<br />P.S nowadays I don't push my luck with books( shipping,waiting time etc..) if I want to learn something I go to my linda.com account and find there whatever course I need to learn or if it is not there or it is not enough I go to youtube also a great place to learn things ( and don't forget that it is free and instant).at it is free and instant).
0765326353|4.0|The Way of Kings is a good epic fantasy.  There were some things I really liked about it, and some that bothered me no end. I bought the hardback the day it was released but found it hard to read almost at once, and had to purchase the audio version from audible to get through it.  I wrote a review of it early on, before I had even reached part 2, and realized it was an unfair review now that I've completed the whole thing.  So this review is to balance the previous one.    I'll start with what I didn't like, because in the end, I did like the book, and so want to end my review with positive comments.  First off, I hated the made-up curses.  Storm you, Storm it all, Storming this or that.  It sounds silly.  There were a few instances where I didn't laugh out loud, but for the most part, I was scoffing at the curses.  They make sense in the world Brandon has created, but I can't help feeling like I'm reading YA fantasy when the worst swearing starts with storm.  I find most strong language offensive, but isn't it supposed to be?  I wish Brandon had the guts to write adult language for an adult book... or not have his characters use strong language at all; I'd be fine with that.    The second thing I didn't like was it was too long, meaning the plot didn't move along at a good pace. Usually I'm a fan of long stories, i.e. A Song of Ice and Fire, or The Wheel of Time.  Each of those great series, though, suffer from whole sections of slow plot.  I'll point out that Brandon's earlier books all suffer from slow middles as well (I liked them all though).  The problem with Kings is that it is slow from the very beginning.  The prologue and first chapter are great, then it's like hitting a big stone wall, and the rest of the book plods along at a snail's pace until the exciting ending.  I would compare it to books 6-10 of The Wheel of Time.  I love those books, but they were middle books.  It's not as big a deal for middle books to move slower... most readers like all of the extra info at that point.  Kings could have moved quicker if 300 pages had been edited out.    The last thing I had trouble with was how it was organized.  There were whole parts where I didn't get to read/hear about my favortie character, Dalinar.  I wish Brandon would have written Kings like his previous books, where he was cycling through all of the characters regularly.      Okay, on to what I liked.  The world creation was amazing.  Brandon has a very creative, smart mind.  His fatastical world makes sense; it doesn't ever contradict itself.  The landscapes he creates (or I created, since it took place in my head) are original and intriguing.  I can't even begin to imagine how long he spent creating Roshar.  He did a great job.    Next, the magic systems are cool and creative, and obviously well thought out.  Brandon is known for his magic systems and he doesn't disappoint in Kings.  Some reviewers have commented on wanting more magic in the book; I think he put just enough in for the first book.  Think of how little of the Power we saw in The Eye of the World.      Another good thing is that Brandon's character's diologue improved vastly over his previous novels.  Even Warbreaker, which only came out last year, suffered from juvenille diologue.  In Kings, I finally believed his people were grownups (except for the swearing).  I think working on The Wheel of Time helped him grow as a writer much faster than he would have on his own.  He's truly starting to fill out his much talked about \\"the next great fantasy writer\\" shoes.  Well done.    Brandon has obviously created something epic.  I believe that the Stormlight Archive really will inherit the epic fantasy crown, passed on from The Wheel of Time.  Will it ever be better than WoT?  Maybe... Brandon has learned a lot from it and may improve upon it... who knows?  Only time will tell.  For now, Jordan's epic still stands as king (with Martin's the angry Duke that wants the crown but can't manage to musture enough energy to declare war).      Buy The Way of Kings.  I bought it twice.  I don't regret a penny of my money.  This series is going to be big.  It would have been nice if the first book had given us more, but I can tell that there will be much more to come.  I only hope that after a few books Brandon really shows that he deserves twenty years or so of our readership as we follow him through this massive tale.  Kings is a good, if flawed, start.  Health and luck to Brandon; you can do it!
0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins is the last book in The Hunger Games trilogy and did not disappoint.  This book is amazing!  There is so much action, well developed interesting characters, and psychological drama that I was engrossed in it right from the start all the way to the end.  To get the most out of Mockingjay though, I highly recommend that you read the entire series.  I felt so bad for Peeta throughout the book but am satisfied with the ending.  There is a lot of suffering but loved that Prim's cat survived and enjoyed Katniss' relationship with it.  There is some humor in this book too which helped balance the gravity of it.  I liked Katniss throughout the series and admired her intelligence, determination, spontaneity, skill, compassion and perseverance.  At no point was I able to know how it would end for sure.<br /><br />This is a great book to end the series and I highly recommend this series to anyone 14 and older.  I also think this entire series would work great for a book club; there is just so much to discuss.  This series is a MUST READ for anyone who likes suspense, adventure, excitement, science fiction and books about relationships.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a friend who recently bought a 52\\" and needed a nature documentary to show off her home theater.<br /><br />She agreed that David Attenborough's voice is more tailored to this genre of documentary ... no offence Oprah.<br /><br />The 1080p HD truly showcases the artistic camera work that went into this series.  [[ASIN:B000MRAAJM Planet Earth]] is a great visual production - however, the [[ASIN:B002UXRGM0 Life]] series can stand up proudly next to it.<br /><br />If you are now building a blu-ray nature documentary library, then this Life blu-ray must be #1 on your list!<br /><br />5 STARS! ... I wish I could have given it a higher accolade - it's that fantastic!!! :)
B002KVSJ64|5.0|I was never the biggest fan of Breaking Benjamin. At most, I called them \\"a decent alternative metal radio band.\\" Dear Agony sure changed that. This album is BY FAR their best work. I know most reviewers typically say that a band's latest album is their best work and usually they're biased super-fans. But in this case, it really is true. Before now, the only Breaking Benjamin album I really liked was Phobia. And I didn't think Dear Agony was going to be able to top it. I was wrong. Dear Agony is a masterpiece. I can honestly say that it is probably the only album in my entire CD collection that doesn't have a single bad track on it. In fact, all 11 tracks made it onto my iPod. It's the only FULL album on there. And that's saying something. Granted, it took a while for 'Give Me A Sign' to grow on me because I thought it was too soft, but I usually have to listen to songs more than once to determine how much I like them.  Honestly, I don't see how anyone who calls themselves a Breaking Benjamin fan can dislike this album. And it's been out for a full year now, so if you haven't picked up a copy yet, I don't know what you're waiting for. I highly recommend it.
1439181780|5.0|Great Book, worth reading especially if you liked \\"The Secret\\".  The book was delivered promptly by the seller.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|No knights in shining armor for this, the damsel is not in true distress, and the Robin we meet is hardened but honest. Yes, the history is a jumble of 11th thru 13th century events and items but this is one of the few movies that doesn't romaticize the times or even the characters. It is a far more realistic step backwards into legend and the ending of this BD leads one to the conclusion that Scott and Crowe want at least a second episode that tells more about the Robin Hood we thought we knew. Fine drama, great detail (watch for the hanging mouse on the goblet), and characters you enjoy. All in all, a strongly recommended foray back to what the Medieval Period was like in all its dirt, squalor, stench, wet, and darkness. Thank your stars that \\"smell-o-vision\\" never became truly popular.
1416589473|5.0|So I was a bit skeptical of a GW book, i.e. the Star Wars novels got ridiculous after a bit, but that being said, I went to Books A Million on release day of this book and sat down and read the 1st 2 chapters, and then promptly bought the book.  It gave lots of insight on what they are doing in GW2, and really got my psyched to play GW2 (as if I wasn't already after after their SLOW stream of content they've been giving us for the last year +).  Anyway...title says it all.  Interesting characters, story, etc, and TONS of lore.
0553805371|5.0|Well written often humorous look at \\"reality\\" It is not an in depth physics text, nor a treatise against beliefs It is, like  his previous best seller, thought provoking. You think  you understand all of the theories. But like much of quantum theory you can only know with certainty a small part  and thus not know other parts.
0439023513|4.0|(contains spoilers)  Even if so many people have expressed their dislike for the way Collins wrapped up her series, it definitely satisfied my expectations. When I finished reading it, I was, as A.R. Bovey describes in his review, \\"shattered, empty, and drained.\\" Prim's death brought tears to my eyes, something perhaps only one other book has ever done.    However, after reading some more reviews and looking back on the book, I've realized that there were a few issues in Mockingjay that would have made me enjoy the book much more had they been presented differently. I wasn't particularly bothered by anything while reading the book (except a possible example could be the lack of \\"tender moments,\\" which were a nice respite whenever one occurred in the first two novels), but in retrospect, there are a few choices made by Collins that I'm not fond of. Despite those issues, I really did like the final Hunger Games installment regardless of whether everything happened exactly as I would have wanted. I think, as others have said, that this book is more open to varied interpretations than the first two books of the series were, and that that isn't a bad thing even if there are many who have decided the book was an complete and utter \\"letdown.\\"    Finally, as a 16-year-old \\"young-adult,\\" I fit this book's target demographic, and I enjoyed it immensely. My hope is that if I liked Mockingjay, my fellow young-adult readers will as well.

0312600844|1.0|I'll not attempt to summarize this novel except to say that it is quite literally obsessed with sex. This is it's only enduring theme save banal left-wing environmental, political and economic messages.  Freedom lacks the satirical humor of The Corrections.  I found the satire eventually annoying in the earlier book, but Freedom could profit from some humor.  The book is a bore, even the endless preoccupation with matters of the groin, eventually becomes tedious and predictable. It is a wonder to me that Franzen required ten years to craft this drivel.
0143118420|5.0|What a piece of work. Not just the beautiful writing (must be read in English - sorry all translators, can't imagine how you can ever do justice) but the actual transformation behind the words. It would never be described as a self-help book but it might be the most actual self help book ever written (or lived). It's definitely a chick book - but one that every man should read... especially if you are raising two daughters, like I do, who you want to understand better now and later... Or if you are Married, ever been married or ever want to get married. If you like Italy, traveling, relationships, anthropology and social reflections of American and world cultures, eating, health, yoga, meditation, love and pursuit of happiness all bound together with spiritual observations this ubud's for you bud!  Thank you Liz Gilbert and good on'ya. ps. I \\"read\\" the Audio book, read or rather \\"performed\\" by the author. wow.

B003VANOFY|5.0|I've had these headphones for 3 days now and I must say that they are the best sounding I've ever had.  Not that I've ever had ones this expensive before so the other ones might not have been as high of quality.  I can't compare to exclusive brands like Sennheiser but I will say that these are phenomenal.  The only thing that irked me is when I took them downstairs while on Skype with a friend and I threw something into the microwave and that killed the wireless connection.  But that's more of a technology limitation than a flaw in the device.  I highly recommend these!

B000EBD9TY|5.0|\\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" has always been one of my very favorite films from the 1950's. Highly regarded as a film that changed the way movies were made both in story content and visually, \\"Streetcar\\" has held up extremely well for a movie that is now nearly sixty years old.<br /><br /> Tennessee Williams wrote the original play that the film was based on and many critics regard this work as William's best. The movie deals with a washed-up sounthern belle named Blanche who is proned to alcohol. She visits her sister Stella in New Orleans where upon meeting Stella's husband Stanley it is evident that a strong sexual bond exists between Blanche and her newly discovered brother-in-law.<br /><br /> The film is known not only for William's powerful and moving script, but for the powerhouse performances of all the leads, especially Marlon Brando who exudes not only moodyness, but extreme sexual tension for Blanche. Despite the fact that the viewer knows he will \\"get his way\\" with her you somehow feel she is getting what she desires.<br /><br /> All the leads received Oscars, including Vivien Leigh who played Blanche, but unfortunately the Academy overlooked Brando. Kim Hunter (Stella) and Karl Marldan (Mitch) also walked away with Oscar gold and the film itself was nominated for Best Picture.<br /><br /> Like most early 1950's films \\"Streetcar\\" was made in full screen so that is the format you will get upon viewing the DVD. The bonuses on this two disc set are flawless and they include three minutes of extra footage dropped from the original version, commentaries, documentaries, and more.<br /><br /> Come, sit back, and watch \\"Streetcar\\"...a movie you will watch over and over!<br /><br /> In 1984 ABC aired a remake of this film starring Ann-Margret as Blanche, Beverly D'Angelo as Stella, and the sexy Treat Williams as Stanley. That version, although a made-for-TV film, is much more explicit, especially the rape scene. Ann-Margret actually suffered bruises from doing that scene. Unfortunately, like many films made for televison this eighties telefilm is not available on DVD, but several years ago it was out on VHS format.r televison this eighties telefilm is not available on DVD, but several years ago it was out on VHS format.

Carried in the Houston area on the local CW affiliate season 2 was moved to saturday afternoon?? In this age of DVR's I guess it doesn't matter when it comes on except to find new viewers saturday afternoon is saying they don't care if anyone sees it or not. Too bad...really great show. Anyway as far as the DVD's I would highly recommend them except it will leave you wanting more.

B003ZK58WM|1.0|I normally wouldn't join the fray but have too. Boycott kindle... $20 for an electronic book is simple robbery. The print copy is cheaper. It doesn't matter how good the book is or who wrote it. If kindle continues to get away with this, soon all their books will be more money for electric copies. And it isn't just them, complain to Apple and B&N...

B000026ETU|5.0|This is Definitely my third favorite Santana album after \\"Santana\\" & \\"Abraxas\\"<br /><br />The product description states that it's an Import and Remastered.<br />The Artwork in the CD Clear Tray had been updated but it's the same exact disc I bought 15-16 years ago. Very unhappy that I now have 2 copies of the same disc with better artwork.<br /><br />Buyer Beware. Disc Info states 1983, Nowhere in the liner notes does this disc<br />indicate \\"REMASTERING\\" Same goes for SHANGO.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Great second book in the trilogy. It is a nice twist on the YA books about vampires - meaning it includes vampire characters but the story itself does not revolve only around vampires. It deals with concepts such as Heaven & Hell, Angels & Demons - unrequited love, friendship, loyalty, teen angst, incest, homosexuality, etc. all mixed together with Vampires, Fairies, Warlocks, & Wereloves. Fun read - definitely get it.
B000059H98|3.0|I saw this when it was originally released on VHS and it looked really cool. I went to it wanting to like it, but that didn't happen. It just wasn't that good. It was kinda hip, kinda cool but somehow it didn't mesh.    It came up in my radar again and all the positive user reviews prompted me to give it another go, but it fared no better this time around. As I watched it I figured out that the problem lied mostly in Tank Girl herself. She's big on the wise cracks and always has a one liner ready to go, but it is all a bit too cute and light. Seems to me that after seeing her boyfriend (husband?) gunned down, and is uncertain as to the fate of her daughter, she would be hell bent on revenge. Here, she's no where near as effected as she should be. Yes. She's going to set out to find her daughter and do in the bad guys but she lacks any sense of fire.    Lori Petty plays Tank Girl who is a renegade in the wasteland that is earth. It was hit by an asteroid and most of civilization is wiped out along with most of the drinking water. The Water and Power company, headed by the usually nasty Malcolm McDowell, wants to control ALL the water which means getting Petty and her rebels out of the way.     The costumes are a bit \\"too\\" as are the sets but, as it's derived from a comic book, I guess you have to figure that into the equation. And, as usual, the bad guys can't shoot for beans and the good guys can put your eye out at a hundred yards and that gets tired way too fast.     There is a lot of fun here but, all things considered, it still needs a better Tank Girl both on the script and in the casting. I like Lori Petty enough but she doesn't have enough edge. We're talking revenge here and she always seems like she's on her way to, or at, a party. She also lacks a certain physical presence. She's a bit too tiny. You need to know that your heroine can kick some butt.    This isn't a bad movie, but I did find myself waiting for the end and that isn't a good thing. If you'reup for some mindless fun then have at it. If you need something with more meat on its bones then skip it.

B003XQRZ7E|5.0|I typically don't put much stock in music reviews and rarely post my own but felt compelled to comment on the new BCC effort. It's perfectly fine to not like something but I think some of the reviews are really off the mark. Some of the comments such as how this is a \\"half-cocked effort\\", \\"the guitars blare (out of sync), that \\"All aspects of this effort are less than mediocre\\" and \\"there literally is no redeeming quality to this outing\\" are completely off base. The guitars blare and are out of synch? No redeeming quality? I think most comments of this nature are coming from Joe fans who don't like seeing him stretch out his wings in new territory and as such are harshly biased.     The reason in a nut shell that I like this CD is because I'm a classic rock fan at heart (although I'm also a fan of blues, metal and some jazz) and this has the unique ability of sounding like it might have come from the 70's yet at the same time feels fresh. It's 70's classic rock 2010 style. The musicianship in this band is phenomenal given the short amount of time they've been together. A perfect illustration is \\"Song of Yesterday\\" where there are many tempo changes with each member adding his distinct flavor without stepping on the toes of the other band members. This song really has great emotion and is my current favorite but it certainly isn't the only one that displays the excellent band cohesion. Most CDs today I'll listen through several times and eventually will cherry pick the most listenable ones. This CD however has legs from start to finish and is solid throughout.     Pick up a copy and be your own judge. I'm willing to bet the vast majority will like it. If not that's fine but I can guarantee you that this is certainly not a \\"half-cocked effort\\" or \\"out of synch\\".

B003IHW0GE|5.0|I have always loved this story. I have a book of her life and I have 3 copies from dfferent years of the book of \\"Little Women\\". The late 50's was the first copy I got. It was from the Whitman Publishers. To be able to get it on Kindle is a plus for me. I am excited about being able to do that. I am about to retire and having different books I enjoy on the Kindle will make it so much easier for me to read. I can take it anywhere without having to worry about it or a regular book getting ruined. Thank You.
B0041ZQHHA|1.0|I was very dissappointed in this album, though I have liked his work with the Killers....  So many of the songs invoke his religious \\"God\\" and the subject matter is boring....    I am not inclined to buy future songs from him.  I wish he had done better!
B003XX2PD6|5.0|Last years Atlas Sound album \\"Logos\\" from the Bradford Cox inspired side project was a wicked delight and therefore it is a pleasure to report that his primary source of music making namely the band \\"Deerhunter\\" originating out Atlanta, Georgia have come out firing on all cylinders on this brilliant fourth album. That said a slight problem may be in store for those of you still deeply smitten by the 2008 double album and wall of guitar noise beast \\"Microcastle\\", since this is altogether a very different proposition. Praise or blame for this must be partly apportioned to the presence of Ben Allen at the mixing desk, this is the man who after all conjured up the sonic alchemy in terms of Animal Collective's 2009 genre defining masterpiece \\"Merriweather post pavilion\\".<br /><br />Check out the watery and sweet \\"Helicopter\\" on Halycon Digest and try not to note the presence of otherworldly elements which Avey Tare, Panda Bear and co teased to the forefront on Merriweather (and for good measure also seek out one of the plethora of mixes of this song on the net not least the joyous Star Slinger mash up every bit the darker cousin of Passion Pit's \\"Sleepyhead\\"). Truly, truly wonderful stuff in both guises. Then you have the latest single \\"Revival\\" a mix of Brian Wilson like \\"Smile\\" induced psychedelia and 70's glam rock. This deserves to a chart smash and of course pigs will fly. The six minute plus \\"Desire lines\\" alternatively suggests that the Cox might have had an advance copy of the Arcade Fire's \\"Suburbs\\" and is full of minor baroque and theatrical flourishes leading up to a storming conclusion which has become the Montreal minstrels signature sound. The Guardian has said of this album that it is \\"timeless music, seemingly made with the conviction that loveliness will always be lovely\\" and no where is this more apparent than on the epic album closer \\"He would have laughed\\" dedicated to Cox's friend the late Jay Reatard which is a two part song that shifts from a rolling bubbling synth pop with almost a Baba O'Reilly motif to a shift at 5 minutes into a darker song punctuated by contradictory lyrics such as \\"I lived on a farm, yeah/ I never lived on a farm\\" which ends so suddenly you despair the CD may be scratched or blotted by a dirty fingerprint. Along the way to this glorious final destination you will encounter other fine songs such as the slow acoustic \\"Basement scene\\" which sounds like Buddy Holly on acid, the thumping \\"Memory Boy\\" a pop song of such excellence that the British Quality Foundation should investigate and the sax driven \\"Coronada\\" which is almost a dirty rocker in this albums context.<br /><br />This is an absurdly endearing record and even after the first listen you know that you are partaking of a dish to which you will return for afters. There is absolutely no reason why Deerhunter and Bradford Cox in particular shouldn't be names whispered in hushed and hallowed tones around the world of rock/indie music and the phrase \\"next big thing\\" attached to them without fear of ridcule. \\"Halycon Digest\\" is an album that Cox and Co have threatened to make over the past decade and aren't we especially grateful that they have delivered in full.ling synth pop with almost a Baba O'Reilly motif to a shift at 5 minutes into a darker song punctuated by contradictory lyrics such as \\"I lived on a farm, yeah/ I never lived on a farm\\" which ends so suddenly you despair the CD may be scratched or blotted by a dirty fingerprint.

0061433047|5.0|I burst into tears when I finished this book - a first for me.      With Tiffany Aching, Terry Pratchett writes a love letter to young girls and a story of how to be a grown woman and not just 'pretty'.    This book tells such profound truth in such simple language that it could easily overlooked while Pratchett lovers look for the next pun.  \\"Poison goes where poison is welcome\\" should be the motto for Fox News.    Thank you Mr. Pratchett for giving us Tiffany and if this is her last story, for creating such hope.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|Just got my Kindle and started reading the Pillars of the Earth on it.  Was excited to see a new epic by Ken Follett coming out.  Was disappointed to see the price.  Won't be buying this one any time soon.
1416583432|1.0|I have never written a review of anything but feel compelled to do so now.  I too got sucked in by the \\"New York Times Bestseller\\" billing.  I could not get through more than 35 pages.  The prelude started ok enough, but then the author felt the need to spend 2 pages expaining why she uses the term \\"the dog\\" and what she means by it.  The whole thing comes across to me as a pretentious mess.  I have a PhD of my own, and when I pick up a book to read for leisure I expect to have an enjoyable read, not a book that is exponentially longer than it needs to be because of the use of extremely long-winded explanations of the author's opinions and unnecessary \\"$100 words\\"  Case in point, and there are many: page 15- \\"Anthropomorphisms are not inherently odious.\\"  It reminds me of a gathering of stuffed-shirt university professors who feel the need to show their intelligence and superiority by out-wording each other.  The author's dog must be glad he doesn't understand English.
1601252463|5.0|Dislikes: I am not too keen on the bomb throwing Alchemist class, though I have yet to experience one in play. Some of the optional rules will not be opted for in my campaign. The add-on \\"traits\\" are too powerful to get for free, but a great idea as a two-for-one in place of a feat.<br /><br />Likes: Everything els.<br /><br />The Cavalier is optimal in design, the racial varients are fantastic, the new spells fill in gaps from the more extensive 3.5 library, the artwork is fair to great, and the write up on the anti-paladin is a hoot. This book is a really great addition to the Pathfinder world. It qualifies as a must buy.<br /><br />I would give support to critical coments fearing an overdevelopment of core characters over situational development of the Pathfinder system in the future. With the Adavanced Player's Guide in our hands, we really do not need more characater options in the core material. New races and spells could be added, but more base classes, feats, optional rules that add-on to existing characters, should be avoided.  Where Pathfinder should take us now should be more places to play, wider vistas for world building, cool gadgets and feared opponents.  This book greatly fills out the core PC. Please do not over-develop Characters.
0307463745|4.0|This book is a new book in a \\"new trend\\" sticking it to the philosophy of big business and corporations. If you follow 37signals at all, you'll likely know what is going to be said, that is why its a 4 star book from me and not 5. It is a great book, but like a previous reviewer said, its basically a collaboration of many of their Signal vs. Noise blogs and some additional commentary about business and how to succeed while staying small and nimble.    I love the layout of the book, with very short sections (2-3 pages at most) on each topic, with real world examples in each section that backs their opinions and ideas. If you're interested in learning more about how they think, or think it might benefit you it's definitely worth a read and can be read quite fast if you're just hammering it out. It is a good book to get a few notes from though, so you may want to do that.
0345505387|1.0|I adore the original \\"Outlander\\" book and the entire series and am anxiously awaiting the final book from Diana Gabaldon. I was equally anxious for the release of \\"The Exile\\" but I'm now sorry I wasted my money on it.  We were promised that it would be from Jamie's point of view but it was from Murtaugh's point of view instead. We really didn't learn anything we didn't already know and the promised explanation of the \\"Jamie ghost\\" was not there either.  The graphic novel was just a fast-forward version of \\"Outlander\\" with the characters poorly depicted and none of the emotion of the characters as they are portrayed in the novel.  After one read of \\"The Exile\\", I've given it away which is something I never do with a book.  Don't waste your money on \\"Exile\\", buy \\"Outlander\\" instead and get the real story.
B002IKLZZY|5.0|. . .is what Hitchcock originally wanted to call this movie.  He gets the lion's share of the credit for this well-crafted classic but you also have to give credit to Ernest Lehman, the screenwriter. Anybody ever read what William Goldman said about this movie in \\"Which Lie Did I Tell?\\"? He was very complimentary of the screenplay, pointing out that about a dozen plot points are all tied up in the last minute or so of the film.       And how can you go wrong with Cary Grant? The great thing about Grant was that unlike most freakishly beautiful movie stars, he always came across as self-deprecating & not especially impressed with his own good looks. I think that's what made him so endearing. Never more so than in this masterpiece.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|I really love this box set but I have to say that I enjoy the few Mono-Vinyl releases that I have more.  I guess I am a luddite.  I have Please Please Me, A Hard Day's Night, Beatles For Sale, Help!, Rubber Soul, and The Beatles(White Album) in glorious Mono.  I didn't buy Sgt. Pepper back then because I thought:  Who would ever buy the album in Mono?  Boy, was I wrong.    Buy this box set it is great for many reasons!
B00005JKGZ|5.0|I'm not much of a fan of musicals from the Golden Age but this is probably my favorite (along with \\"Singin' in the Rain\\"). The songs are great & it does make you feel nostalgic for a bygone era. It's a little too episodic but that's typical for a musical.  The story comes to a stop when they start singing and dancing.  What I really love about this movie is little Margaret O'Brien. It's worth the price of admission just to see her steal the show when she sings \\"Under the Bamboo Tree\\" with Judy Garland.        Having said that, it does seem odd that the kids, unsupervised, would build a bonfire in the middle of the street & that Tootie's family would not only condone her throwing flower in somebody's face, but not punish her for almost killing passengers on a trolley after deliberately derailing it (oh, that Tootie!!). I guess it was a different time & sensibility--like when you see doctors in old movies smoking a cigarette while hovering over a patient who's on their deathbed.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|They need to understand Kindle owners (other eBook reader owners well) are sick and tired of this and won't take it anymore!!!
B0009X766Y|5.0|In 1973 (when I was about ten), my parents took me to the theatre to see this movie. I have been a huge Paul Newman & Robert Redford fan ever since. I absolutely love the card-playing scene on the train. Newman looks like he's having so much fun pretending to be drunk as he gets Robert Shaw's goat. Has any actor ever been more charming in the movies? If so, I haven't seen it.
1434102815|3.0|To the many endorsements of The Elements of Style over the years, I can add my unreserved approval as its being the most helpful book for anyone who needs advice on punctuation and/or style.  It is blessedly short and to the point; students will read it as opposed to the long textbooks familiar to teachers of college writing. The book has been around a long time, but perhaps that recommends it rather than encourages suspicion.  I discovered this book as an undergraduate and have used it throughout my university teaching career.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|After being enthralled with The Foundation, I couldn't wait until Zac's second album was released.  This does NOT disappoint!  This band's musicality, creativity, and overall diversity have me absolutely amazed.  My favorite song from the first album was \\"Jolene\\", and now that seems like old hat.  You Get What You Give has so many great tracks that all sound different.  You can hear elements from so many genres and bands, and they all blend together seamlessly.      I recommend getting this album to anyone who likes good music.  This band never gets old to me, and I'm already waiting impatiently for their next album.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|I was surprised to see that Ken Follett's new book had received such terrible reviews when his prior \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" book and sequel had been so good.  Turns out all the 1-star reviews AREN'T EVEN ABOUT THE BOOK!!!!!!!  They are all disgruntled vengeful people who are angry at the PRICE of the Kindle version.  NONE of them are actual reviews of the book itself!!!  How horrifying that they are RUINING an author's reputation and sending out a misleading message that the book itself is total trash when all they care about is the COST of the book?  Protest to the publisher if you're angry, but you don't PUNISH THE AUTHOR!!! HE'S not the one who sets the price!!!!!  Unbelievable, so selfish and horrifying that people are trying to destroy an author because they want a cheaper version of the book on Kindle than in print.      Let me be the first to say the cost on Kindle was totally reasonable to me, the book length is ENORMOUS.  You'd think people couldn't put their kids through college any more because the cost is so outrageous.  You have a problem with the price, take it up directly with the publisher, but how unbelievably callous and selfish that people are RUINING an author's reputation and bad-mouthing his work in order to get revenge over for what they think is a high cost for a book.  You don't like the price, then don't buy it!  But you DON'T give a book a one-star review if you haven't even READ it.      I'm reviewing the BOOK.  After all, that's the whole POINT of book reviews.  Five stars.  If you love \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" you will love \\"Fall of Giants.\\"  Ken Follett did another amazing job.  READ THIS BOOK!!!!
B003WSFXKY|2.0|I was really looking forward to this Cd to see what Carlos was up to.  Very dissapointing.
0525951652|1.0|I agree with many other Kindle owners that this and other books delivered by Amazon Wispernet are simply listed to high in price. This book (Fall of Giants [Kindle Edition) is outrageously priced and I will just wait until it's priced more reasonable. Amazon, Follett & publisher, you need your head examined. Say by the way Amazon, why are \\"Free Books\\" priced for up to over $10.00. Maybe you need to update your \\"Free Book\\" search engine.
B00026WUAU|5.0|This is one of the most striking cases I know of the remastering process utterly transforming an album. The sound of the original release was muddy and dull. To my ears, the songs lost their impact as a result and I couldn't bear playing it. But oh my, this remaster is near perfect. The instruments sound crisp and full bodied without ever drowning out Dylan's voice at a time when it was surely near its peak.    The majesty of the songs is now clearly evident. While, imo, this is not quite an album of the calibre of 'Desire', the album that preceded 'Street Legal', it is nevertheless a great piece of work; heartfelt, tuneful and played by a band with a ton of punch.    It's worth noting that the sadly late lamented King Crimson alumnae, Ian Wallace, sits on the drum stool and plays with the hard hitting sound of his English peers, Moon and Bonham. And quite off topic, it's fascinating to compare his playing here with his superb jazz chops on two albums he delivered shortly before his death a few years ago as the leader of the Crimson Jazz Trio. Both highly recommended.    If you're still persevering with the original crappy CD version of this, do yourself a favour and ditch 'em in favour of this marvellous remaster. Now, when the hell are they going to not only remaster but remix the shocking sound of 'Empire Burlesque' and forever rid it of that ghastly '80's reverb? The drums? Unlistenable.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|I had heard this compared to 300 which I personally did not care for. Way off! Spartacus takes the scenes from Rome and The Tudors that alot of people really liked and builds an entire series around this. Well Directed and Acted with plenty of Action, Suspense and from a Female perspective \\"easy on the eyes\\" Spartacus DELIVERS! You will find plenty of Deception and Drama as in The Tudors and Rome so you really cannot go wrong! :)
B003U7RP80|3.0|Another in Rhino UK's low cost five album series in original mini sleeves. The sound is varied with \\"The Wicked Pickett\\" being decidedly weird. Indicated as mono on the sleeve - most of the sound comes from the left with intermittent \\"stereo\\" sounds from the right. Always nice to have the original sequencing (and at a reasonable price) that we all grew up with.  However, if you are into the sounds of Memphis, New York, Muscle Shoals and Miami, the Bill Inglot mastering on the 2010 Rhino Handmade boxed set \\"Funky Midnight Mover\\" blows the current set away - many times over. If you want the complete Wilson Pickett on Atlantic and have $100 to spend, take a pass on this set and buy the real thing.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|I can't not love this movie. Iron Man is probably one of my top favorite super heroes of all time. Again, Favreau sticks to what makes Iron Man so great...cool suits, big explosions, and beautiful women. Unfortunately, Favreau makes a few missteps with this sequel.     For one, there is too much going on and not enough time to delve into it. There's the relationship between Stark and Senator Stern, the relationship between Stark and Hammer, the relationship between Stark and Ivan, the relationship between Stark and Rhodey, the relationship between Stark and Pepper, the relationship between Stark and Natasha...just to name a few. In all honesty, any one of these relationships could hold up a movie by themself. Sadly, Favreau tries to shove them all into 2 hours. It works, but barely.    Along with all that, Tony is trying to cope with his looming death. Again, this alone could have held up the movie, but it was just another subplot which had to be explained away within twenty minutes. Granted, this subplot got the most exposure out of all of them, rightfully so, but it didn't get nearly as much exposure as it should've. I could have seen it continuing on to the third and final film.    Even though Favreau doesn't have enough time to delve into everything, he does well with the time he has. The dialogue is witty and fast paced, the acting is superb, and the action sequences are some of the best. In a way, Iron Man 2 is like Thanksgiving Dinner, there's so much to eat, it's all really good, but by the end you're thinking...\\"that was too much.\\"
B001PB3RU8|5.0|Let me preface this with, I never buy CDs b/c I usually download everything.  But I really wanted this for my car and didn't want to have to remember my iPod all of the time to listen to it.    I love this album.  It's so well thought, and I love the sound.  She's incredible.  I'm inspired, relaxed and I love so many of these songs for all different reasons.  Nothing sounds the same, and if it did it would still be amazing.    My musical tastes are Tom Petty, Dave Matthews, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Alanis Morrisette, Tori Amos...    Love Florence and the Machine.  L O V E.
B001U0HBQ0|4.0|Good one time watch and remianed hooked to the movie trhough out. Need not buy in Blu-Ray.
0451228375|2.0|Luckily I listened to this going to and from work to pass the time rather than reading it, or I'd have put it down halfway through.  The characters are two-dimensional and the plot twists almost all predictable.  Spoiler Alert:  After going through half the book with the villains winning every battle, the bad guys are all swept away by the plague.  It gets quite silly after a while.  Cunning Gwenda doesn't realize Ralph still has leverage over her even though he can tell her husband he's the real father of her son?  Time after time you can see what's coming a mile away, and while the writing is competent it's no better than that--it can't overcome the leaden plot.  I read World Without End and remember liking it a lot more.  I just can't recommend this one.
0525951652|5.0|I have given this 5 stars to offset the lousy practice of marking it down because the publisher dictates a distasteful price.  This is not the fault of Amazon or the Kindle... To complicate matters, here in the UK, the price I see is $13.96 so even the author may be unaware of the price you are seeing in your country.
0060935464|5.0|I read this book probably 35 - 40 years ago as a young teenager and had forgotten about it until I came across the movie on TCM (Turner Classic Movies) which shows up every so often in their schedule. Anyway, I wanted to read the book again because it was an intriguing book and the subject matter was race relations in the old south. Author Harper Lee never wrote another novel as successful as this one but if one had to write an only novel in ones lifetime, this was the kind of book to write.     It was painful to read the old practices of the old south because racial prejudice was so prevalent back then that confronting it was not advisable. The story of the Finch family and the perspective from Scout and Jem's point of view makes the story so inspiring and touching because it represented the hope of better race relations based on what they had witnessed in the court room.  The young children of Atticus Finch were the epitome of hope in raising the hood over the ignorant blind rage of bigotry.     There are other characters in the novel worth reading about. If you live in the southern part of the United States, some of these people are very familiar to you. They are your uncles,aunts, cousins, neighbors and acquaintances. They are as familiar as sunrise. The character of Boo Radley and the Radley family was enough to make you keep reading. The climactic end was so satisfying.    Learn from the book - and study other people. It will help you with a better understanding of who you are as a person with prejudice, even if you believe that you have none. We all have prejudices - it's just the way it is. The key is to learn about them and try to unlearn them, especially when it comes to dealing with other people other than yourself.
B003TXKSWK|4.0|John Legend and the Roots. At first I was a little disappointed because this seemed more like a John Legend CD than a Roots CD. The CD is excellent, you CAN listen to it all the way through. The songs are very positive on this CD and at points have a Gospel feel to them. The music will sneak up on you and may you catch your head banging. The Roots truly showed diversity on this one. I am not going to go into details on each song, but do recommend that you listen to Little Ghetto Boy if you are still skeptical.
0545265355|5.0|It was a great idea to get the box set. I really enjoyed the books. It was also way cheaper to buy the box set if you are even thinking about reading these books. It will save you money even if you just read the first two books. I had her about this series from people at work and was affraid it was going to be a super girly books series again, but it was actualy really good.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best series I have ever read. You need to read them, you NEED to. I was kind of skeptical at first due to a description that totally undersells it. I decided to try them out and I didn't regret it at all. Not for one moment did I regret reading these books. I thougt it  would just be a bunch of kids killing each other but there is a love story somehow weaved in that makes this book all the better. Buy it. You will talk aout it for weeks and love it. i certainly did.
B002RWKSII|5.0|Worth listening to a master interpret another master's work.  This is not just an arrangement of Gershwin, this is Brian Wilson taking Gershwin's work and putting it into his style.  The title is apt, this is Gershwin reimagined.
B00095NX9G|5.0|Love it!  So much to go through, love the option of yoga warm-up and cool down.  suggestions and ideas on how to use DVD was great!  My 7-year-old loves to do the yoga with me and take her best shot at the moves.  I am a total beginner, no experience beyond seeing Shakira bust out a few moves, and I find the instruction easy to follow!  Have not watched the entire thing, but I love what I have tried and even if I don't like the rest, what I have experienced is great and worth it!
B0000029DD|5.0|I stumbled upon Jeff Buckley after people kept telling me an artist I was working with had a voice strikingly similar to that of Mr. Buckley's.  A few months later I decided to check this Buckley guy out, and heard Last Goodbye for the first time.  I was blown away!  I learned Buckley had only completed one full record during his lifetime, so I immediately looked up Grace and found five star reviews across the board.  Naturally I went out and picked up my own copy and let it play through.  While instantly taken by the flow of tracks 1 - 3, the flow of the rest of the record just didn't seem to work for me.  I listened to it many times for several weeks and ended up dismissing it as simply a decent record.  I decided to give Grace a spin today after several weeks away from it just for the heck of it, and something finally clicked - something I had caught glimpses of before but couldn't quite see until now.  Like it or not, the beauty of Grace is indisputable.  It unfolds unlike any other great album I have ever heard, and given proper time, the sequence simply works.
B003VQM2M4|5.0|The 2nd release from Nick Cave's alter ego band is vicious, powerful, deranged & depraved; with<br />  the sort of soul-stirring, gut-wrenching depth that only Nick & his cohorts can imbue into such a<br />  menacing core.  Cave's voice is, as always, compelling, dramatic & disturbing all at once.  The<br />  music is dark and raw, packed with both spine-grinding explosions & soulful, hypnotic, grab-you-<br />  by-the-gut rhythms.  Includes members of the Bad Seeds, Birthday Party, The Triffids, Dirty<br />  Three, Alice Texas. Captivatingly dangerous and brilliant!
0307454541|4.0|I heard about this author from friends.  One of them lent me the first two of his three books.  Thanks to my Swedish heritage and trips to Sweden, I enjoyed from the<br />first page.  This volume, however, requires patience for the first 60 or so pages.<br />THEN you have a hard time putting it down.  Larsson does an absolutely fascinating<br />job of weaving a story that you really cannot guess where he is going with this tale<br />of murder, abuse, intrigue, sexual and personal relationships.<br />  I had a difficult time finishing this novel because I was anticipating so many<br />answers to so many questions.  Book two in this trilogy also did not disappoint!!  It merely whetted your appetite to discover where it was going.  Book three began to \\"collect\\" the so many strands.  The reader wanted our \\"heroine\\" to overcome the<br />many difficulties in her life.  The reader wished for and was \\"rooting\\" for her to<br />finally emerge victorious.<br />  In order to not get enmeshed in our Springfield Library waiting list, I went to<br />Amazon to order all three of Larsson's novels. That was an excellent decision for me.  I have since recommended all three of Larsson's novels to quite a few of our<br />friends with the admonition to \\"Please do yourself a favor and read these wonderful<br />books in order.\\"  Amazon satisfied my impatience admirably.
0316017922|5.0|I received my book very fast, It was in great shape and as stated. Will buy from seller again.
030745455X|5.0|This was one great writer, and if not for a book club, I never would have picked it up, as I don't usually go in for the mystery/suspense books. But I am a big reader, and let me just say, if you're looking to step foot into a world that will pull you in one word at a time, one image at a time, get this book. It's been a long time since a book has intrigued me so completely. Did you know you can read the scary parts with your hands over your eyes? I didn't think so either, but check it out. Thanks, Steig. RIP.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|This is the funniest show on television today. It is loaded with smart humor, a talented cast, and beautiful, beautiful Alison Brie.  The DVD came packaged in a smallish box, there were 4 discs, and they were split in two cases. They arrived safe, no scratches, and to much anticipation. I loved it.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|Outrageous. I'll read two other books for that price and wait till next year to read it when the price becomes reasonable.
B00288KNJU|5.0|I would have saved some money. But it was a movie that I missed out at the theater and I wanted to see it. I love stop motion movies and this one was great. Very fluid animation from the artists. Creepily movie too, and you wouldn't expect it given it's look. The 3D also works too but you have to get used to it.
B003JTHESA|5.0|The people who gave this album negative reviews remind me of the people who said that Rush's \\"Caress of Steel\\" was garbage. This CD goes where no Maiden fan has gone before!     In my opinion, this is where Final Frontier Stands, with regards to Maiden's past work (best to least list)    1.  Powerslave (1984)  2.  The Number of the Beast (1982)  3.  Piece of Mind (1983)  4.  Somewhere in Time (1986)  5.  Brave New World (2000)  6.  A Matter of Life and Death (2006)  7.  The Final Frontier (2010)  8.  Killers (1981)  9.  Iron Maiden (1980)  10. Seventh Son of a Seventh Son (1988)  11. Dance of Death (2003)  12. Virtual XI (1998)  13. The X Factor (1995)  14. Fear of the Dark (1992)  15. No Prayer for the Dying (1990)

B003UERZ88|5.0|This album really suprised me. The songs are really cool and Halford sounds great. With Roy Z and Metal Mike on guitars you cant go wrong.    I wish there were less songs and longer guitar solos, but all in all I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B002VECLVO|5.0|A Single Man follows George Falconer, a gay college professor in 1962, through his day as he plans his own suicide.  George, who has never recovered from the death of his long time lover, Jim, several months before, has since become increasingly and unbearably isolated from the world around him.  The inability to share his grief with others has made George's loss even more unbearable and his loneliness even more painful.      Amid amazingly beautiful visual artistry, we see George subtly experiencing the world around him as he moves through his presumptive last day.  After George delivers what he believes to be his final lecture with an uncharacteristic lack of restraint, an inspired young student confides to George his own sense of fear and isolation. George seeks out Charlotte, his long time confidant and friend who was a lover briefly and still clings to the hope she and George might have a future together.  However, Charlotte's insensitive minimizing of George's relationship with Jim and her persistence in lamenting their lack of a long term sexual relationship, makes George realize even Charlotte doesn't understand who he really is.     Tom Ford simply takes the audience into another world by using stunningly beautiful imagery to create Georges world and convey his loneliness and detachment.  I predict Colin Firth will belatedly win a make up Academy Award this year for his performance in this movie and he surely should.
0345505387|5.0|I truly enjoyed this extension of the Outlander experience.  For me, if you don't read the sections found at the begining and at the end penned by Diana then well, your going to miss the whole point of the GRAPHIC novel.  I believe thoes who were dissapointed are trying to box this author into a corner and are not allowing themselves to enjoy her obviously, diverse talents.
B001H5X7KC|5.0|How did they get all those close up shots and all the scenes that involved the camp if the cameras were set up in the forests trees? That's a part of the comedy, hehe.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|I have placed this book in my \\"top 10\\" books read in my life!!!  From the beginning of this book and through the tribulations of Sarah and her parents, I just kept telling myself \\"he could not still be there!\\" in regards to her little brother.  As we got closer to finding him I actually put the book down for a few days because I was just too afraid of finding the truth and had myself convinced that he was found by the kind old man and raised by him.    Apart from learning so much about life for a jew in France, I learned, also, how hope can keep you going through impossible situations.  I think this book should be manditory reading for every middle school child (and their parents).
B003PIUBZS|5.0|For anybody who loved the movie \\"300\\" or the HBO series \\"Rome\\" I highly recommend this DVD.  I liked it so much that I almost called into work sick on Monday so that I could finish the series that I had started the previous day.  I'm sure most women will not be floored by this but my girlfriend wasn't turned off by it.  It is aptly named Blood and Sand and you should probably add guts, gore, and pure awesomeness to the title.
B004386KUY|3.0|As modern legend goes, Carlos resisted Clive Davis' proposal to do an album of classic rock album covers. I wish he would have stuck with his initial instincts. While his beautiful ex-wife, Deborah Santana, was credited with reuniting Carlos with Clive Davis to make a radio friendly album, resulting in \\"Supernatural\\" (and its sequel \\"Shaman\\"). The success of \\"Supernatural\\" took the industry by storm, let alone his dedicated fan base, of which I proudly remain. The album sold over 25 million units worldwide and garnered Carlos 9 Grammies, rivaling Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\". I frankly didn't care for most of the duets on \\"Supernatural\\" save for \\"Maria, Maria\\" (classic Santana revived), \\"Do You Like the Way\\" (Lauryn Hill and CeeLo in the zone) and \\"The Calling\\" featuring Eric Clapton (which was more of a Santana track than a collaboration). For me, the standout cuts on this album was the more Santana-like tracks such as \\"Primavera\\" and \\"El Farol\\".    Since \\"Supernatural\\", Carlos and Clive felt straddled by its success and therefore duplicated the formula on the engaging, if repititive formulaic, \\"Shaman\\".    What a hardcore Santana fan would consider a great album probably would have little commercial resonance. Prior to \\"Supernatural\\", he had all but disappeared from T40 radio though he remained a strong touring act and a staple at classic rock radio with songs like \\"Evil Ways\\", \\"No One to Depend On\\" and \\"Europa\\" for starters.     \\"Guitar Heaven\\" is really nothing but a repeat of the \\"Supernatural\\"/\\"Shaman\\" formula disguised as a Carlos-guitared solo album. But with vocal contributions on every track, the only twist is the old covers album concept. Davis has been wildly successful prostituting this formula for commercial successes by Rod Stewart (now devoid of any rock cred) and Barry Manilow on his decades tribute albums. It has to be taken as the sign of even a Clive Davis now finally past his peak. It has been said that though Davis has had tremendous commercialsuccess, he could never be saddled with making great, critical albums. He gets to laugh all the way to the bank while the artists lose any sign of cred (see Rod Stewart, Whitney Houston for a wide range of examples).    Reading the track listing on \\"Guitar Heaven\\" makes one yawn as these are well worn rock staples that need a lot more than hip producers (Matt Serletic) and marquee vocalists to rise above the pact. While it is hard for Santana to ever make a bad album in my assessment, this concept is just downright boring and near offensive.  Some posters have commented that it is hard to believe this is the same Santana that played at Woodstock. Well, the same can be said for Crosby, Stills and Nash today or Joe Cocker (see \\"Dirty Dancing\\" soundtrack). Janis, Jimi and Sly have either transitioned on or no longer catering to a current scene. Carlos is responsible for educating and expanding my music listening into experimental jazz and ethereal rock. I gladly took the journey though it sacrificed commercially viability.    So while \\"Riders on the Storm\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and/or \\"Back in Black\\" sound fine. He truly shines on \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\" with Scott Weiland. Chris Cornell does a respectable job with the battered \\"Whole Lotta Love\\". This one will certainly not duplicate the success of its predecessors, if only because the business has all but made multi-platinum albums unachievable. Hopefully, Davis will bow out after this release. His covers albums by Stewart and Manilow each sell less than the previous one. As he has now been relegated to \\"Chief Creative Officer\\" at Sony, he has had not one sterling success under his belt since assuming his new role. He applied his covers formula to Harry Connick Jr. and that failed also. Sony may not grant him another stab at Santana. In fact, Carlos submitting a Carlos-driven Santana album probably wont be too well received either. I plan to be at Carlos' showcase dates at The Paramount in Oakland forthis album, if only to applaud his tenacity. Besides I have seen Carlos nearly 2 dozen times. This album wont keep me away...........but, I'll be surprised if it gets more than a couple of spins from here on out. In 1969 when \\"Woodstock\\" happened, no one would have fathom that Carlos would morph into quite the business entity with successful restaurants (Depti Nivas, Maria, Maria, etc.), Santana shoes and wines. Or that he would have a resident tour in Las Vegas. We are living in a different era and it warms my heart that he is still around, like all great artists.     I could never say this was a hell-ish experience, but, \\"Guitar Heaven\\" surely wont live with the angels. At best, it is an earthly reminder that you can run a good thing in the ground, no matter how good you once thought it was.

0374158460|4.0|The word freedom is used a lot in Jonathan Franzen's latest novel. Sprawling, expansive, exhaustive and yes...even exhausting, Freedom is satire. The kind of satire that made me squirm in my easy chair because I am the demographic that Franzen dissects and catalogues, thereby preserving for all posterity the 21st Century American Consumer as a cautionary tale or \\"how-not-to-manual.\\" Poking and prodding at the true cost of being free, Franzen demonstrates that the inalienable right Americans take for granted is tipping the planet's survival irretrievably down the toilet. The novel is a social commentary on life for a certain type of American. One that finds living under the sphere of freedom rather treacherous, but has the good fortune to fritter away the hours with lots of Me-ness. Too much of a good thing can tear families apart. Enter the Berglunds.    The Berglunds are odd birds. Spanning decades in the telling of one family's struggle to get life right, Freedom follows the trail of what-ifs and roads not taken left behind by married couple, Walter and Patty. Young Patty Emerson was a contender. Aggressive, competitive, and eyes always on the prize. Honing her athleticism in a family of political animals and artists was what made Patty special. A stand out basketball player, Patty found her niche as a University of Minnesota Golden Gopher. For all Patty's discipline and sweaty austerity, campus life unlocked the part of Patty's personality that was drawn to danger. For Patty, Richard was irresistible danger of the sort that wore black and played guitar. Richard also held in his possession a friendship with outwardly ordinary Walter. With this unlikely triangle begins a series of mistakes made, freedoms squandered, and lives cobbled together to form a 21st century definition of love and loyalty.    What Jonathan Franzen has written is The Family Saga, territory that has been mined since the earliest days of storytelling. What makes Freedom different and a fine adventure is its laugh out loud humor and flawless weaving of the poetic with the prosaic. I was constantly stopping to try and answer questions that arose in the novel, such as: Is happiness really an inalienable right (because isn't being miserable a hell of a lot easier)? What exactly triggered our addiction to an On-Demand lifestyle? Is there such a thing as responsible consumerism? Must we hurt someone before we allow ourselves to love that person? How can EVERYONE be special (damn sense of entitlement!)? Is the life of a Cerulean Warbler as valuable as that of a child's? The Berglunds are a family who find it difficult to survive under the weight of their love for each other. This makes Walter, Patty, and their children, Jessica and Joey, characters for whom I feel sympathy, but withhold the emotional investment of loving. They are an exasperating bunch, and the aphorism \\"Know thyself\\" is the lesson I've taken from the Berglund's tragicomic tale.    Freedom is a tour de force of all that is right and all that is wrong in American society. I credit Franzen's skill at tackling complex, global issues (zero population growth, anyone?) while attaching a fragile humanity to abstract concepts. One thing in particular that created a connection for me was Walter Berglund's history. Fairly deep into the novel, Franzen paints a picture of \\"the American experiment of self-government\\" by recounting Walter's grandfather Einar's emigration from Sweden to the U.S. My great-great grandparents embarked on a similar sea voyage from rural Sweden to Minnesota, so it was with a certain familial understanding that I laughed at the passage, \\"...because it wasn't the people with sociable genes who fled the crowded Old World for the new continent; it was the people who didn't get along well with others.\\"    I thoroughly enjoyed the rhythm and language of Freedom. I also understand why some find the book frustrating. This is character study at its finest, even when the characters are lessthan exemplary. There is no tight, ironclad plot driving this story. In fact, the plot is a loose framework that enables the characters to drop in and out. Freedom is told in a nonlinear style, and it does a certain amount of backtracking and taking the long way around to get to where it's going. Life is like that. Migratory and full of the unexpected.

B003SHDSRE|3.0|This book started off great!  I was laughing out loud and reading passages to my husband. Then it seemed like the author realized she was having too much fun and sprialed down hill from there.  The middle of the book was just a bit too deep after coming from the laughs we had just had.  The end of the book lightened up in mood but was somehow just plain bland.    It is almost like 3 different women wrote this book without even the decency of getting together on it to get the styles straight.

0345350472|4.0|This ingenious novel, written more than 40 years ago, anticipates what is now becoming a compelling issue of our times:  the synthesis of man and machine.  Science fiction writers have long worried about the creation of robots that could threaten to make man obsolete.  But the issue Dick wrestles with is more subtle than that.      Like many others, he imagines androids so advanced as to be indistinguishable from humans, thereby raising the question of just what it means to be human in the first place.  For Dick, the androids are extremely advanced and even smarter than many of the humans; the difference is their lack of empathy, their lack of an overweaning survival instinct, and their inability to realize cell regeneration (resulting in a 4-year lifespan).  All of this is interesting and raises important philosophical and scientifc questions.     But what distinguishes Dick from other science fiction writers is his focus not just on the robots but on how the humans have evolved.  The humans in the novel embrace machinery to the extent that they too become, in a sense, androids.  Everyone has a \\"mood organ\\" that engineers their moods.  Humans communicate with other humans via an \\"empathy box\\" allowing others to feel their feelings.  If empathy is what distinguishes humans from machines, what happens if humans begin to use machines to enable or improve their empathy?  At some point, does it even make sense to try to distinguish between human and machine?  Don't we create a new life form, a new step in evolution, consisting of human machines?     I remember when I saw the movie, my thought was why not color the androids blue or give them 2 heads; then there is no question who is human and who is robot.  But that misses the whole point.  We may not want to distinguish between the two; we may right now be in the process of creating a whole new form of life that merges man and machine.       As matters turn out since 1969, don't we employ science to engineer our moods with drugs? To create virtual worlds in which we increasingly live?  Are we on the cusp of beginning, via genetic engineering and via artificial intelligence, to create a more advanced form of life known as human machines?      Dick also works into this issues of faith as another defining feature of humanity, though this is not completely developed.      The book is much different from the movie.  The blade runner is not quite as heroic and more prone to self doubt.  The issue in the book is not so much whether the blade runner is himself a robot (a big issue in the movie), but what it means to be human and how human and machine life are merging to create some new form of hybrid life.      Although the concept is ingenious, Dick has trouble with dialogue and plotting which prevents this from becoming a first rate novel.  But the book is quite compelling and entertaining.
0061124265|4.0|This book is about Veronika who decides, as the title suggests, that it's time for her to die and that's how we first meet her.     We find out as the book starts that Veronika has been planning to take her life for quite some time (and in quite some detail) but at first we don't really know why. We find out that she is a pretty girl with a good job who lives in a town that she loves but for some reason there is absolutely no joy in her life.     So one day she says goodbye to her little world, takes a bunch of pills and goes to sleep...and that's where the book really begins. You see Veronika doesn't die but she wakes up in a mental institute where she gets told the pills did irreversible damage to her body and that she will die in a couple of days or so but until she does she has to stay at the mental institute.     Now reading what I've just written I am sure you will think that it's a sad book (and that you probably don't want to read it), truth is that it is one of the most uplifting books I've ever read! Also it is a very light read and not very thick so can be read from cover to cover in a couple of hours. Personally I had it with me when I was doing the Inca Trail in South America, and seeing how sick I was (stomach bug) I definitely needed something uplifting.    So I guess what I am saying is that if life feels dreary and you want to figure out what's it all about again then read this book, actually even if you think life is great just read the book!    Paulo Coelho has a very vivid way of writing that I like, it's like he believes in himself and the world and he is trying to make sure the rest of us can see the world and the people in it through his eyes, and in his eyes it's all kind of great. He also doesn't seem to get embarrassed by certain subjects, for example there is a very explicit scene I the book that made be cringe but that because I personally found it embarrassing and the point behind telling that part I believe was to show the reader thereis no need to be embarrassed.     I have read a couple of Paulo's other books and this is the only one that made me go wow so I am not recommending him as a brilliant writer but this one book is definitely worth you taking a couple of hours out of your time to read.     On another note this book has apparently also been turned into a movie with Sarah Michelle Gellar  as Veronika. I have not seen the film so have no idea what it's like but seeing I am a fan of both the book and Sarah (I mean who can forget Buffy the Vampire Slayer) I will more then likely watch it at some point.

B0044430H8|5.0|I'll preface this review by saying I am a hardcore fan of Trent Reznor and everything he does ie NIN and How to Destroy Angels. So when I heard he was doing a score with Atticus Ross, I was a bit worried, since I have never heard him write music for a movie. Then I bought the score, which really is an album in of itself, and I was reminded why this man and his music is amazing. Yes he does use two tracks from the Ghosts record but I'm ok with that cause really that record is suited for remixing. As for the score itself, to me it's not a score for a movie, but a new album from a Trent and Atticus. In reality I'm not really gonna watch the movie, and if I do its for the amazing music Trent has created.

B0038Z5T4Q|5.0|2 Disc Set - Insider Trading Edition, released September 7, 2010<br /><br />Wallstreet was made in 1987 by writer and director Oliver Stone and starring Michael Douglas, Charlie Sheen, Martin Sheen, Darryl Hannah, and John C. McGinley. A young stockbroker after months of persistence finally bags the big fish, Gordon Gekko, a man whose presence and lifestyle he idolizes. He shuns his blue collar background in pursuit of greed and impatiently engages in illegal insider trading.<br /><br />I first watched this movie after a book called \\"Now Showing\\" claimed it to be one of the best 25 movies....ever, I guess. I must say, all in all, it was a good movie. I actually really liked Charlie Sheen and Martin Sheen's work in it and I believed their relationship. The pull of an actual father and son relationship really added to the authenticity of the roles. I finally got to see Michael Douglas just the way I like him -- being a bad guy, someone getting the best of him, and not seducing women.<br /><br />Michael Douglas plays a big Wallstreet player who has money falling out of his eyeballs and is idolized by Charlie Sheen's Bud Fox. Fox is taught to bend and eventually break the rules to get ahead and get that cold hard cash. This movie is all about greed. Douglas' character likes to buy out the majority of shares in a company and then liquidate it getting away with a quick buck. When Douglas gets going into a lengthy monologue, he oozes confidence which is amazing considering the pressure he was under. Bud Fox grows a conscience when he sells out his father's company to this same fate and decides to fight against it ruining everything he's worked for. This was one of those roles that really made Charlie Sheen stand out and become a celebrity in his own right and brought the extra challenges of that responsibility with it.<br /><br />There is an appearance by Darryl Hannah as random home decorating girlfriend who is very comfortable in her way of living and leaves Fox the first time it gets tough. I thought it would be more dramatic and more of a point of her being in the movie, but there really isn't and it ended up being a waste of screen time and just one more thing for him to lose on his fall from grace. She is a symbol of the rewards that can be earned by a fast way of living stepping on others and her substance is very shallow. Again I really loved seeing someone get the best of Michael Douglas, even if they couldn't get away scot-free and had to face the music. Shows the value of time, hard work, and morals over getting rich quick with some family values thrown in too.<br /><br />Probably an undervalued asset to this film is one of my favorites, John C. McGinley whom you'll remember as one of the Bob's from Office Space and his role of Dr. Cox on Scrubs. Always there to heckle and mock his good friend and has some of the best one-liners in the movie. Actually three of the main five lines people quote from this movie can all be attributed to this character he developed.<br /><br />This is especially a great movie for men and/or people who love business and stocks. This is one of my husband's all-time favorites and many men can quote it readily.<br /><br />DVD Extras:<br /><br />First, there is a new commentary by director, Oliver Stone. He is a precise fellow! Stories are told of how filming is going on and he isn't even looking through the camera, he is following along word for word in the script to make sure his actors don't miss a moment of his dialogue. Before Michael Douglas, Stone considered Warren Beatty and Richard Gere for the role of Gordon Gekko which both declined when the script was in an earlier form. Apparently Gere still wonders where his career would have gone if he had gotten the script that Michael Douglas got to shoot. Douglas had a heck of a time with the lines. There was so much to his monologues and dialogue and much was shot in long takes. When he finally put in the time and memorized his part better, he wasable to put in the performance that was needed. The commentary reveals more behind-the-scenes information as well as Stone's apparently neurotic tendencies. So many times after a line is said, he commented on how so-and-so of some magazine or whatever complained about THAT line but why he justified it being important to the script. If he really was that confident behind each one, he probably wouldn't need to expain, right? He had a LOT of issues working with Darryl Hannah and in retrospect wouldn't have cast her in the role if he could do it over again.<br /><br />On Disc 2, you can watch the entire film with a Trivia Track that pops up helpful facts like when it's Gekko's birthday that he is a Taurus and other facts that are actually interesting about the making of the film and New York and the stock exchange in general.<br /><br />\\"Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps\\" is a very short few minute conversation with the main actors in the new film: Michael Douglas, Shia LaBeouf, Carey Mulligan, and Josh Brolin about their characters and new situations. \\"Fox Legacy with Tom Rothman\\" talks about a generation of men who took up \\"Wall Street\\" as something to be quoted and idolized Gekko, whom was intended to be a villain but was a hero to these young, hungry executives.<br /><br />So really when it boils down to it, this version is just to make a few bucks with the new movie coming out and does not provide much that the 20th anniversary edition didn't out-do.reveals more behind-the-scenes information as well as Stone's apparently neurotic tendencies.

B002JVWRAY|5.0|22 Episodes on 4 Blu-Ray discs, released September 7, 2010<br /><br />\\"Supernatural\\" from series creator Eric Kripke stars Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles as Sam and Dean Winchester, brothers who have been brought up to fight against the supernatural around them by their father. They've gone against all manner of urban legends, vampires, werewolves, a scarecrow god, etc. but this season the two brothers and one fallen angel, Castiel played by Misha Collins face all the might of Satan and his army. Kind of a step up from their previous work.<br /><br />Things get even more dangerous when new foes show up like the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and angels and demons both keep targeting the brothers warning that there is a dangerous fate they both will have to face in the upcoming devastation. With all this going on, they may have to seek a pretty big ally: God.<br /><br />I got to review Season 1 on Blu-ray earlier this year and it was the first time I ever saw the series. I really enjoyed it and now I'm hooked for more. The first season went after so many old school scary stories that I remember from my childhood (Bloody Mary, anyone?) and season 2 quickly brought the death of the eldest Winchester, Sam and Dean's father. Throughout the season, very ominous vague indications were given about Sam's future as a pawn of the demon that killed their father and their mother. Dean was charged with his brother's protection at all costs, even if that meant killing him to prevent him from turning into a tool of the yellow-eyed demon.<br /><br />Now fast-forward a few more seasons and Sam and Dean are battling the apocalypse! It reminds me of when \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" started out slow, then gained momentum until they too had to fight actual Gods and began to run out of big enough baddies to be a good end-season boss to face. The same thing might be happening here but hopefully they'll pull it off well. Interestingly, all the episodes appear to be named after songs or movies with a word or two difference.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />For extras, you get \\"Supernatural: Apocalypse Survival Guides\\" - Bobby's exclusive video collection which is great preparation for the coming end of day's, I'm sure ;-). Then there is Ghostfacers: The Web Series which debuted in April this year following the fearless and often ridiculous \\"professional\\" ghost hunters in a documentary style format. Their first case was about a starlet who was murdered in front of her dressing room mirror and stars A.J. Buckley as leader Ed, Travis Wester as tactical specialist Harry, Brittany Ishibashi as tech girl Maggie, and Austin Basis as videographer Kenny.<br /><br />There is producer and writer commentary on Episode 4, \\"The End\\" which is surprising since it doesn't include the main actors and it's so early on in the season. Also there is one unaired scene from Episode 9, \\"The Real Ghostbusters.\\" Really? ONE deleted scene? Also as always, there is a gag reel. For me this feels like pretty slim extras on this set. The extras that were piled on the Blu-Ray of season one were MUCH more impressive.nce.

B00006G8K0|4.0|Hammer Horror movies are often considered to have come straight out of the \\"horror mill.\\" Still, some were quite decent, and this is one of those. Keep in mind that Hammer movies released in the UK were different than those released in the US, with deathly cold touches that Hammer fiends have come to cherish. In this one, the scene of Lucy being burned on a crucifix by Van Helsing still chills me. Lucy is quite unnerving in her sly, sinister ways, especially as she leads her innocent niece, Tanya, into the woods where Lucy meets her doom.<br /><br />The movie is based on both Bram Stoker's Dracula and his Dracula's Guest. It was a favorite of mine as a child, and some will say a mere nostalgia pick on my part, but I suggest you give it a second look. Lee was especially effective as Dracula--as a child, I thought he *was* Dracula.<br /><br />In usual Hammer style, everyone plays their part to the hilt, and the props are classics. The castle is THE Castle. The wasp-waisted women lust after their Dark Lord, and even a Dictaphone has a major role!<br /><br />As Lucy would say, \\"Yes dear, come! I know a place we can play.\\" That's what Horror of Dracula is: a good romp in the dark lands of horror.
B0032JTV6U|4.0|22 Episodes on 7 Discs, released September 14, 2010<br /><br />WOW. SEVEN discs of \\"Glee\\" plus over two hours of bonus features for this complete first season set! Well, they better since they tried to release the season in two parts to begin with and are now offering a $10 rebate if you already bought the \\"Road to Sectionals\\" half season. \\"Glee\\" began piggy-backing off the viewers tuned in to \\"American Idol\\" and just grew from there. Who hasn't felt like an outsider in high school? Theater majors, choir members, and outcasts across the country followed this show religiously for all the nostalgia it evoked and pretty soon, larger demographics joined in when they saw how entertaining it was. There has never quite been a musical TV show like this and no one can seem to get enough \\"Glee\\".<br /><br />Along with being nominated for 19 awards including Outstanding Comedy Series, Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, and acting nominations for Lea Michele, Matthew Morrison, Chris Colfer, Jane Lynch, Mike O'Malley, Kristin Chenoweth and Neil Patrick Harris, this show ran away with the opening skit to the Emmys!<br /><br />The premise is that a Spanish high school teacher, Will Schuester played by Matthew Morrison takes over the Glee Club full of underdog misfits and slowly through team work helps them rise to greatness. Making up this club are the leading lady, Rachel Berry (Lea Michele), football quarterback leading man, Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith), self-proclaimed diva, Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), head of the cheerleaders (cheerios) Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) forced to drop out after coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch) finds out, rough-edged mohawked Puck (Mark Salling), soprano fashionista Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer), the best dancer who happens to be in a wheelchair, Artie (Kevin McHale), shy Tina (Jenna Ushkowitz), and the other two cheerios, Santana (Naya Rivera) and Brittany (Heather Morris).<br /><br />Most of the conflicts revolve around Mr. Schuester's failing relationship with his wife who is lying to him about being pregnant herself and his mutual attraction with school guidance counselor germaphobe Emma Pillsbury played by Jayma Mays, Sue Sylvester's determination to take down the Glee Club once and for all, Quinn's difficulties with high school pregnancy, Kurt coming out of the closet, and a few romantic hook ups and break ups between the students.<br /><br />All of it is interlaced with song and dance numbers either as assignments or sudden expressions of feeling that help develop a character. Tons of guest stars appeared in this season including from the first cast of \\"Wicked\\" - Idina Menzel and Kristin Chenoweth, Josh Groban, Eve, Molly Shannon, Olivia Newton-John, Jonathan Groff, and my favorite Neil Patrick Harris competing for the lead in \\"Les Miserables\\" with Mr. Schuester! A break-through in uniqueness and a win all around, so check it out.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br /><br />Ok, at first the menu singing that is the ambient transition music for the entire show being in the menu sequence is cute, but it gets annoying VERY fast. There is a \\"Welcome to McKinley!\\" featurette that is an introduction for new students by the Principal and is very silly (\\"There's no \\"I\\" in \\"misunderstanding.\\"). There is a Glee Music Video to Queen's \\"Somebody to Love\\" where all the characters walk down the hallway sweetly in slow motion. You can also watch the full audition videos for Glee Club for Rachel's \\"On My Own\\" which has always had a special spot for me since that's the song I always used for auditions in school and college and Mercede's \\"Respect.\\"<br /><br />The Glee \\"Casting\\" is a behind the scenes journey of a screenplay written in 2005 that was decided to work better as a TV show than a movie. The dependence upon finding cast members who were a triple threat (can sing, dance, AND act) and the first person they found was Lea Michele for Rachel, the most important component for the show that everyone else is based around to make the story work. Apparently she got into a huge accident and totaled her car right before her audition in front of the FOX lot and she managed to nail it despite pulling bits of glass out of her hair. Also there was great difficulty in casting Finn to find a guy who could be a jock and a glee club member. They ended up creating a role for the character of Kurt Hummel after meeting Chris Colfer since he was so unique and interesting for their project.<br /><br />\\"Deconstructing Glee\\" with Ryan Murphy is a shorter featurette about the casting process that was made for TV marketing. The Dance Bootcamp is about learning the dance numbers for the cast members. The irony is that Kevin is probably the best dancer of the group but is always in a wheelchair (except for that daydream sequence).<br /><br />Jane Lynch is my favorite element on the show and she has a couple of VERY short featurettes: one where she talks about her first role in elementary school as the letter \\"A\\" and another called \\"Meet Jane Lynch\\" where she explains why Sue is the way she is and tons of her best quotes are thrown in for good measure. There are several \\"# Things you didn't know about (Jayma, Cory, Amber, Chris)\\" sequences that are very short, cute, and probably are played during commercial breaks to advertise the show. There are video diaries for 8 different cast members about their journey to New York for publicity and drumming up ad support. It would have been easier probably to combine them all into one big video since they mostly get different views of similar moments, but it's still kind of cute and impromptu.<br /><br />When on Jukebox mode, it plays tons of songs from the show one after another that you can leave on just to watch the song and dance routines and you can even put them on shuffle! There is also the sing-along karaoke version of four songs, \\"Alone\\", \\"Somebody To Love\\", \\"Keep Holding On\\", and \\"Don't Stop Believin\\" where the words appear on the bottom and slowly highlight as the song progresses.<br /><br />Dressing like your favorite Gleek is a great little featurette on how the distinctive costuming came about for each character. Staying in Step with Glee allows you to learn the \\"Rehab\\" dance from the first episode performed by Vocal Adrenaline. There are featurettes on the Madonna episode and the Making of a Showstopper. The Madonna episode was a journey through the pop star's career complete with music videos and every incarnation of Madonna possible in background shots and was a big challenge and triumph for everyone involved. The Bohemium Rhapsody showstopper in the final episode took two days to choreograph, four days to get the costumes, and several dancers were injured in the shooting hitting their heads on a steady camera, spraining an ankle, and breaking a finger to name a few.nd totaled her car right before her audition in front of the FOX lot and she managed to nail it despite pulling bits of glass out of her hair.

0312600844|4.0|I found it hard to put down this book. It's literary, but it's also riveting, which is not true of most literary works. I kept turning the pages. The brutally honest depictions of middle-classes families are gripping. I enjoyed the language in most parts. Occasionally there is a part that is weak and should be condensed or cut, in my opinion, to tighten the book.<br /><br />I had a great forward reading experience, but not so great reflecting experience. Maybe it is because there is no one character that is really likeable. Then why go back into that world? Still, I appreciate the author's honesty and loyalty to his own vision.<br /><br />Swann

B002QW7ALM|4.0|On a ship carrying the last of humanity to a new Earth-class planet, the fifth rotation crew awakens to find the fourth rotation crew missing, and the ship limping along under minimal power. Attempting to reach the ship's reactors, Sgt. Bower [Ben Foster] encounters wicked space hounds, and a band of passengers who have awoken and become vicious scavengers, fighting for survival. It would help a great deal if he could remember his mission, but, like his Lieutenant [Dennis Quaid], the process of hyper-sleep has wiped out much of his memory. Worse, it may have sent him into madness, and all this is a terrible dream. Will his ship end up like the Pandorum, with all hands lost?<br /><br />Pandorum is a pretty good example of dream horror. It becomes clear fairly early in the film that Bower may be hallucinating, may never have even left hyper-sleep. That would certainly be a better explanation for the horrors around him than the scenario of the ship being overrun by ghost-white hounds from hell and scavengers. But the film does an excellent job of keeping us guessing, as well as portraying the claustrophic quarters and ducts that Bowers must travel through. His plight is well-plotted and well-played, with all of the problems that would arise in such as situation presenting themselves, and no simple answers. Bowers must use his wits to determine what is real, to communicate with the scavengers, who are from all over the world, all speaking different languages, while dealing with crazed humans and even crazier beasts.<br /><br />Overall, a good movie, worth seeing for its creepy, internally consistent portrayal of a hallucinatory catastrophe in space.
B003R0LBVW|2.0|i enjoyed reading this book but hated most of the characters. the intrigue was there but the substance was lacking and depressing.  the moral seemed to be that living in our modern world is hardly worth the effort.

B003BKF696|5.0|I have purposefully avoided writing a review for The National's 'High Violet' because I felt if I tried to write anything meaningful or even try to write an objective review I thought I knew what I was talking about, I would have failed miserably while doing a serious injustice to the album. I have owned 'High Violet' for months now, and only now I can justly say that 'High Violet' is seriously one of the best albums released in the last ten years. I strongly beg to differ in some people's pale comparison to The National's 2007 'The Boxer.' The depths to which 'High Violet' sinks into The National's commonly dark and melancholy state is staggeringly fresh and beautiful than any of their previous albums. The lyrics are genuinely poetic, but what really makes 'High Violet' truly stand out is its overall ambiance and coherence. 'High Violet' represents a gut wrenching view or realization on life, love, and death much like one does after a night of bad deeds and heavy drinking; 'High Violet' is the aftermath or morning after of such a long regretful night. With only eleven tracks, there really is NO mediocre song available, no skipping is required. If you have a little patience, 'High Violet' will reward you immensely.     The intoxicating opener, 'Terrible Love,' is an ironically positive love experience set against fuzzy guitars and deep and pulsing drums. \\"It takes an ocean not break\\" fits the music gorgeously as it, at times, does sound like crashing waves. 'Sorrow' is an honest and intimate song of defeat. Berninger understands his descent into sadness. He doesn't want to get over his loved one, and he's all right with that. 'Anyone's Ghost' is cold and fittingly haunting. 'A Little Faith' is a dark and brooding and possibly twisted affair as Berninger drones \\"You'll find commiseration in everyone's eyes/The storm will suck the pretty girls into the skies\\" and \\"We'll play nuns versus priests until somebody cries.\\" Your guess is as good as mine. 'I'm Afraid of Everyone' is an excellent take on isolation. Berninger is literally afraid of EVERYone, including his own child; \\"With my kid on my shoulders I try/Not to hurt anybody I like.\\" 'Bloodbuzz Ohio' seems to be the only upbeat track on 'High Violet.' However, the sense of doom is prevalent, \\"I still owe money to the money to the money I owe/I never thought about love when I thought about home/I still owe money to the money to the money I owe/The floors are falling out from everybody I know.\\" 'Lemonworld' (my personal favorite), an undeniably pessimistic song which displays some interesting drumming and percussion work while the deep strum of guitars create an immediate presence. 'Runaway' is a deliberately slow song to end all slow songs. It's dripping with melancholy, yet the lyrics are quite affirming, \\"No I won't be no runaway/'Cause I won't run.\\" 'Conversation 16' declares the \\"kids are in trouble.\\" It's a fascinating song where Berninger reveals his most inner thoughts, \\"I was afraid I'd eat your brains/'Cause I'm evil.\\" 'England' is arguably the prettiest song on 'High Violet.' It's a sweeping epic. 'Vanderlyle Crybaby Geeks' is The National's answer to an anthem, and what an answer it is! What a closer. What an album.     'High Violet' possesses all the right ingredients to make a modern classic! With five full length albums under The National's all ready sophisticated belt, `High Violet' is the one they'll be deservingly remembered for.
B003VANOFY|2.0|I was eager to get these headphones.. read the reviews and thought it would be a good buy.  Got em.. installed drivers and they failed.. They work fine on my crappy dell with vista but not with my current set up in windows 7.. very disappointed.  Called tech support and they told me it was my computer.  I have several friends with experience in troubleshooting such problems and their conclusion was that because its such a new product the drivers suck. (Companies tend to rush products out and release updated drivers later.) But hopefully they update them cause right now I have a very expensive paper weight sitting on my desktop.
0525951652|1.0|I was really looking forward to this book on my Kindle but I will not purchase it at this price. A thousand page book would have been so much easier to read on the kindle. Hopefully the publisher will pay attention to the uproar and set more rational pricing.  Or everyone can just wait for the cracked version.
0439023513|5.0|Okay, I admit it. I cried like a baby at the end of Mockingjay. Don't worry, though, I won't include any spoilers. Let's just say that there is no other way it could have ended and still have such a powerful impact. Everything came full circle. After reading this trilogy, I am offically adding Collins to my favorite authors list. She's truly brilliant! I'm looking forward to reading more of her work.
B0021L8V1G|2.0|This review is not of the film, but  rather more of a \\"heads-up\\" to those of you who are interested in what the extra cost for the double disc includes...   For those of us who enjoy all the \\"bells & whistles\\" on special edition dvds, this release is a real disappointment.     The 2 star rating is not for the movie. The movie is terrific and I would give it 4 stars. Unlike a lot of critics, I liked the story lines - especially the one involving how Stark was recklessly handling what he thought was his impending death. The low rating has to do with the fact that the extras are anemic at best. \\"IM2\\" has a total of 4 deleted scenes and 2 featurettes (the featurettes together totally 15 minutes), with the \\"and more\\" listed on the back cover amounting to an AC/DC video. THAT'S IT. They're all on the second disc, along with a digital copy of the film.     Unlike the first installment, and the big plus on THIS version that wasn't included on the first feature (double-disc edition) is Jon Favreau's director's commentary.     Does the commentary, 2 \\"behind the scenes\\" features totaling 15 minutes, 4 deleted scenes, an AC/DC video and the digital copy warrant the extra money for them when Paramount/Marvel obviously could have included so much more, given what they included on the first installment? Obviously, that's up to you...     Apparently Paramount and Marvel figure that the popularity of the franchise entitles them to charge more for less.
B003YLK2RI|4.0|This DVD release from Slipknot is a great item for Slipknot fans. The live show - Live @ The Download Festival in 2009 - is fantastic. Possibly the best audio I've ever heard on a standard-DVD concert from Slipknot. The set-list has material from all 4 albums, so the mix of songs goes from about as hardcore as Slipknot gets to some ballad-type songs. All in all, there's 17 songs performed in front of 80,000 people, and it makes the DVD worth the purchase if you are a fan.<br /><br />The 'Full-length Film', \\"Audible Visions,\\" is actually only about 35 minutes long, with abstract clips from on-stage clips to backstage shots. Anyone who is familiar with Clown's style of film will already know that you are in for a lot of abstract moments woven together to make a chaotic atmosphere. The film isn't bad, it's just not amazing or anything. Nevertheless, with the live show included, I consider the \\"movie\\" an extra feature, as well as the videos from the album \\"All Hope Is Gone\\". I wasn't as into \\"All Hope Is Gone\\" as much as other Slipknot fans, so the videos weren't anything too special to me, but for fans who love that album, there's another incentive to buy this.<br /><br />Overall, I'm glad I bought this DVD. And for other reviewers that are giving this release 1 star reviews because it isn't available on blu-ray, that's really not what your review should be about. It should be about the material contained within the release. On that basis, I give \\"(sic)nesses\\" 4 stars.<br /><br />R.I.P. Paul Gray.
B003JSSPSY|4.0|Overall, I have enjoyed this programme. Although there were episodes that I simply did not like: Honestly, what was the point of Princess? And Creator had plot holes earthmovers could have driven through. I was disappointed with the poor use of Darken Rahl through most of the second season.     Nevertheless, I was happy to receive my DVD.     In case anyone has not yet grokked the news, the DVD made it clear that this was the second AND FINAL SEASON! The studio ought to have included a length of 2x4 with the DVD so viewers could club themselves over the head with that bit of information.     It would have been nice to have had some episode commentaries on the DVD. The packaging is very pretty, but the producers could have done so much more with the content.
B003UERZ88|2.0|I was soooooooo looking forward to this release.  Nostradamus was such a let down and then Winter Songs was just plain stupid, but this Nascar-boxing-bullfighting pile is just too much for me.    Where did my Electric Eye-Nailed to the Gun-Made In Hell-Freewheel Burning-Metal God go to?  Anybody's guess is as good as mine.  I loved Resurrection and I worshiped Crucible, but this dis-jointed bunch of songs leaves me sad and dissatisfied.    I've listened to it over and over, but with each listen it just gets worse and worse.    The production is cold and sterile.  The riffs are pedestrian.  The songwriting bounces between lazy and silly.  All three of these things are values that I've learned NOT(!)to expect from the Halford band.    These guys used to be at the top of their game, and with some outside guidance it could (and hopefully will) happen again.
B001FSDOZO|2.0|I read some of the other reviews on this album and had good expectations but I was VERY disappointed by the appearance of the product. It doesn't look real at all. Looks very fake and very plastic.     The seller though, was great in getting this to me asap so they get a thumbs up. The product, a thumbs down. It doesn't look ANYTHING like it does on the toilet seat in the picture. Very disappointing.
B002ZG98C8|5.0|Having seen Grindhouse, I remember seeing a funny trailer for a movie called Machete.  I am not sure how the actual movie came about: whether this was an actual trailer or Rodriguez decided to make it due to positive comments on the trailer.  Anyway, I had been trying to find time to see this and I just saw it today in an empty theater.  I could not understand why since this film is one of the best action films I have seen in a long time!    This movie has everything from a great cast, intriguing and very timely plot and many beautiful women.   I was drawn in from the first five minutes and never able to catch my breath again until the end of the film.  Machete is a Mexican police officer doing a raid on one of the Mexican Cartel heads who has kidnapped a girl.  He is told over his radio to wait for backup before going in.  He tells his partner that he is not waiting for anything but is going in.  His partner is immediately killed but Machete is a one man army (like Arnold in The Terminator) against the bad guys.  When he finally gets to the girl he finds out that it is all a setup by his own boss.  The Cartel Head (Steven Segal) then kills Machete's wife right before his eyes.    Fast Forward three years and Machete is in Texas as an illegal alien looking to get by.  Don Johnson is the head of a border militia that guns downs aliens he captures and Robert DeNiro is a corrupt senator that goes on the hunt with Johnson.  Michelle Rodriguez is running a Taco stand while secretly involved in an underground network that gives passage to illegals to the United States and helps them find work.  Jessica Alba is an INS agent watching Rodriguez's stand while trying to catch her doing something that will lead to the head of the underground network.    Machete is approached by the Senator's advisor to assisinate the Senator for money.  He reluctantly agrees but is then set up to take a fall.  I don't want to give anything more away about the movie but it is loaded with highlyviolent and bloody fights including a lot of bad guys getting sliced, diced and gored by Machete's favorite weapon, the machete of course!    I loved this movie from start to finish and the ending announces two sequels (not sure if this was Rodriguez just making it up for this movie or if they were real).  If you love the old Charles Bronson Death Wish movies, you will definately love this film.  Highly recommended!
B002ECN4P0|4.0|While the Rolling Stones' JUMP BACK: THE BEST OF THE ROLLING STONES '71-'93 offers more than a smattering of the band's popular songs from the 1970s and '80s, music fans will note some titles they might expect - most notably \\"Shattered,\\" \\"Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo, Doo (Heartbreaker),\\" \\"She's So Cold,\\" \\"She Was Hot,\\" and \\"One Hit to the Body\\" - do not appear.  The Rolling Stones' success in those two decades was too large for one C.D. to contain.  Perhaps the option of a double C.D. with all the hits plus filler lost out to a single disc that leaves 'em wanting more.<br /><br />But as you groove to smash after smash such as \\"Bitch,\\" \\"Angie,\\" \\"Start Me Up,\\" and \\"Brown Sugar,\\" it may be easy to forget JUMP BACK omits \\"Shattered\\" or whatever song you hoped it would include.<br /><br />As other reviews here observe, if \\"'71-'93\\" means this collection covers the Rolling Stones through 1993, its most recent songs are from 1989's STEEL WHEELS.  After STEEL WHEELS in '89, the Rolling Stones did not release another C.D. of new music until 1994's VOODOO LOUNGE, so technically you could say JUMP BACK covers everything through 1993.<br /><br />JUMP BACK's 12-page booklet features interviews with Mick Jagger and Keith Richards by the late journalist Robert Sandall.  Jagger and Richards comment on each of the C.D.'s 18 selections and share anecdotes regarding guitarists who auditioned for the band between the eras of Mick Taylor and Ron Wood; what the original title of \\"Brown Sugar\\" wasn't; and the real-life \\"Angie\\" who, it would seem, was not Angie Bowie.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|This show is wonderful there are no words to describe how great it is from the story line, to the characters, special effects, the beautiful scenery, and much much more. Season one was amazing, but season two took it to a whole different level with the addition of a new character it made the show that more entertaining. There hasn't been a show this good in a long time this is the only show i actually make sure to take time out of my busy schedule to see. Everyone I have shown legend of the seeker to has become a fan of the show instantly there is yet to be one person who says the show is not good because that would be a lie. Terry Goodkind's book has come to life in an amazing way the lush lands in New Zealand helped to create this world of magic and wizards. I sincerely hope this show is saved for a third season because it sure is deserving of it and i'm doing the best i can to help this show through saveourseeker.com it the first show in a long time that has a moral to it. it is not like everyday shows now that have no point, all they talk about is whose boyfriend is whose, who's cheating on you, who's pregnant with who's baby and the rest are csi's. legend of the seeker is the total opposite it has moral and meaning in every episode that helps us go on throughout the day teaching you to always put one foot after the other. I sincerely hope ABC decides to continue this show the reason its not known to many is through its lack in advertisement the same people who make this show make Spartacus blood and sand and i've seen so many advertisement for it, but not legend of the seeker this show is continuously gaining more and more fans everyday there are millions out there who are fighting for this show. Please help to save it its a show worth every penny and effort.
B002VPE1XE|5.0|I really like this little bag.  I have another couple of these from Amazon Basics, and this one is, by far, my favorite.  It has a few little \\"extras\\" that the other ones do not have. .. for example. . .  a zippered-pouch on the front (under flap) to store memory cards, or other small items.  There is a belt loop on the back, which has Velcro, so it's easy to wrap-around a belt or tote bag strap, etc.  You don't have to actually feed the belt through.  It has a carrying strap as well.  Lots of things can fit inside.  I can put m TomTom GPs, along with the car charger inside.  Most of today's small cameras will certainly fit.  It's just a simple little item that works.<br /><br />This really has nothing to do with the bag itself, but it drives me crazy that Amazon touts \\"frustration-free\\" packaging.. . .  but then they ship this small little box in a HUGE larger box with packing.  I don't know why they couldn't have just placed the label on the box the item comes in and ship it out.  Very wasteful excess packaging to ship.
B003TJ4YU6|4.0|The producer of the first Ed Sullivan/Beatles show was Robert Precht, Sullivan's son-in-law. I had the great good fortune of working for his company, Eagle Communications, in Montana, from 1993-1995 and the stories he told of the Fab Four on this show were wonderful. Arguably, Sullivan made the greatest business deal the world has ever seen by booking the Beatles for 2 shows and paying a paltry $10,000! As we all know - the rest was history following their February 1964 appearance.<br /><br />If you have ANY recollection of that time, you MUST have this in your collection. It's priceless nostalgia and will instantly transport you back to those heady days when anything was possible and all we needed was love![[ASIN:B003TJ4YU6 The 4 Complete Ed Sullivan Shows Starring The Beatles]]

Most shows are stupid to me so I am extremely picky...but this is the only TV show where I dished out the money to buy the season. I am seriously disappointed that it won't have a second season this year...but I am hoping that they will have one sometime soon. I've written to tell them that I wanted them to bring it back. If you do want it back, please, write them. Its the only way they will bring it back!
0765326353|5.0|...that I have to wait for the second book!!! I began reading Sanderson when I learned he would finish the WoT series. His Mostborn books are fantastic, and this book surpasses those! Following different viewpoints of the varied characters is great, and Sanderson is able to consistently blend each character's pre-conceptions and strongly held beliefs into a wonderful work of art. Developing the backstory for the reader both aggravated and excited me. And I love how even the protagonist has his shades of grey. Looking forward to a very long and enjoyable series.

Hopefully, the fans, me included, will be able to see that it goes on after that too.  It is both scary but funny in a strange way but hey, that's what I like.  I just purchased the 3rd and 4th season even though I am still watching the old ones on TV.
030745455X|5.0|Terrific sequel for those that want to know more about Lisbeth Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo introduced in the first book. Not recommended for those that have not read the intro book.<br /><br />Highly recommend the entire series but have a few minor quibbles about this one.<br /><br />Lisbeth is reading a book on advanced math. Although the author and publisher (Harvard Press) are given, the book does not exist. Pity, as I want to read it.<br /><br />Fermat's last Theorem is incorrectly stated in the book. It is far more complex than what Lisbeth is working on. The supposed solution sprang from a branch of math that deals with the fundamentals of space.<br /><br />The Swedish names of people and towns are confusing as many are similar and can get mixed up. A cast of characters would be helpful like the family tree in the first book.

067942850X|5.0|Into The Wild Book Review  Krakauer, Jon. 1996. Into The Wild. New York: Villard Books. xi +207  One might consider the tale of a young man venturing out into the unknown, unforgiving Alaskan bush hard to identify with. Jon Krakauer, however, captures the minds and hearts of the reader as he reveals the truth of a life well explored in his book Into The Wild. Though this novel was undoubtedly written for the hearts of those that are hungry for adventure, it is easy to say that even one as plain as the rest could get lost in this book. Following many other books written by Jon Krakauer such as Into thin Air, Where Men win Glory, and Eiger Dreams, this book is one that is similar in intrigue and adventure, but set apart in depth and meaning. Villard Books, a division of Random House, Inc. New York, and as well as Random House of Canada Limited, Toronto published this book.  Krakauer begins the novel with a scene of Christopher McCandless's last contact with human kind, just before his steps out into the Alaskan Bush. Following the first chapter, Krakauer takes the reader through the scene of how they found the body of the deceased boy.  The story of McCandless's life unfolds from there. Krakauer retraces the steps of the young boy, revealing the theories and reasons behind the journey and death of this young boy.   As Krakauer reveals more and more about the boy and his life previous to April 28, 1992 when he stepped into the wild, it is clear that McCandless was misled by the romantic writings of his favorite authors. It seems that he took the writings of Tolstoy, Thoreau, and Jack London to heart, and decided to live the life that these authors wrote about. McCandless set off to create for himself a fiction novel of his own; with each day in the wild, he wrote a new chapter of his story. Krakauer also inserts tales from his own life that reflect the same mentality and risk that McCandless displays in his journey. Nearing the end of the book Krakauer uncovers the true result and conclusion of McCandless's adventure, however this is a detail that is left for only the readers to discover.  To couple with this story, maps are present on some of the pages in this book that chart and track the journey that McCandless took during his \\"tramping\\" days. They support the text accurately and provide a very real opportunity to put the story to real life and imagine the roads that he treads in the last two years of his life. The retracing of Christopher McCandless's steps, which are depicted in these maps, demonstrate the effort and dedication Krakauer had for uncovering the mysterious journey taken by this young boy.  The book follows a detail account of a life that was lived much on the romantic side of reality. Through the eighteen chapters of this book Krakauer takes excerpts of writings by Christopher McCandless's favorite authors, as well as highlighted sections found amongst his remains that give light to the way he was feeling in the course of his journey. The book is a slight attempt at discovering what exactly was going on inside McCandless's head before the day he died. Although we will never know the answer to just what he felt, Krakauer does an adequate job at attempting to put some order to the boy's journey that forms an explanation of the otherwise unknown.  Nearing the middle of the book, Krakauer turns the words his way describing some of the adventures he had as a young boy, that prove to shed light on the mindset that the young McCandless may just have had as well. Krakauer's adventure of choice was climbing. He discloses the reasons for his passion for climbing in chapter fourteen. He writes of danger aspect of the climb as a major point of appeal to him. He states, \\"The greater the risk, the greater the reward in most aspects of life,\\" (Krakauer, 134). One particular adventure that he unpacks in the book is his ascent of the Devil's Thumb, an icy mountain in the deep of Alaska. He also, like McCandless chose to do thisadventure alone.  Krakauer's journey was full of risk and zeal and over-coming fear, much like McCandless's, however this journey did not cost him his life; though, he seems to think it should have. Much like the vocabulary that is thought to have influenced McCandless to take this adventure in the first place, Krakauer describes the moment when man overcomes the fight of the climb. \\"A trance-like state settles over you efforts; the climb becomes a clear-eyed dream.\\" (Krakauer 142).   Was this the mentality that got a beloved McCandless in to such trouble, or was it something different? Local Alaska citizens sent in mail prior to the article that was published in Outside concerning Christopher McCandless's death. Folly was the reason for this fatality according to him. His letter reads, \\" Why would anyone intending to `live off the land for a few months' ignore Boy Scout rule number one: Be Prepared?\\"(Krakauer, 71) and another piece of mail form an Alaskan local states, \\" Alex is a nut in my book,\\" (71). The census, in Alaska, it is easy to tell, would say that this boy's adventure and death was due to a lack of research and a poor study of the Alaskan wild lands, therefore a lack of preparation in total.   However, I am lead to a different conclusion. From the explanation of this book, I see the hunger and zeal, which was present in this boy's journey through the American wild. McCandless's pursuit of a wild life was one that carried the risk of a wild adventure that must be present in any journey, lest it be anticlimactic, as well as a few simple errors that ended up costing this boy his very life. It was a combination of both. There was error made in his decisions and his lack of nature training and in this respect, his actions are easily considered folly. Sadly, his folly could have been prevented had he done deep and thorough research on the wild lands of Alaska. However, that said, the entire concept of living alone in the bush of Alaska is undoubtedly a riskthat would have been less intriguing had it been anywhere else. Thus, the boy's journey was one combined with folly and risk, which is what landed him the sad fatality of death at an early age.  All in all, it seems that Krakauer's goal in writing this biography of Christopher McCandless was simply to find some answers about his journey as well as to understand better the reasons behind his thirst for adventure. Both of these goals he does very well. By beginning with the boy's death and unraveling the story from there, Krakauer provides a more logical way of explaining what exactly happened to get him there. He interviews quite a few of the people that were impacted by McCandless on his journey and gets a taste of the man he was through the eyes of the people he encountered in his last two years of tramping around the United States.  Therefore, I am inclined to recommend this book wholeheartedly to any person who cares for the wilderness- or doesn't. This book is full of the effect of present day life on the soul of a man built for the outdoors, (and we all were). The conflicts, the laughter, the tears, and the freedom felt through the pages of this book are sure to move anyone who reads them. The story of Christopher McCandless is one that is real and relatable, even to those who don't now much about the wilderness. His journey is as much a tale of discovering truth and the heart of life and happiness, as it is a tale of wild adventure.  Into The Wild is a book for the ages, and perhaps one that will amplify our appreciation for life and those we share it with for years to come.
0811876373|5.0|After coming across Bakerella's blog recently I feel in love with her cake pops.  As soon as I saw she releasing a book I had to pre-order and get it express shipped to the other side of the world.  A great book.  Very inspirational.
1400052173|5.0|This has got to be the BEST book I've read so far(besides 32 Candles by Ernessa Carter); We all have been to the doctor where he draws our blood, takes a sample to determine something. That I can understand. I want to feel that when the staff at John Hopkins took Mrs Lack's culture from her, it was for the specific purpose of checking how her cancer had progressed. What ended up happening was something NONE of the staff anticipated and this is where I stop condoning them. after that, all bets was off. seems to me, the family should have benefited from the sales of those cells if not for the children who were left when she died. Now I am glad that HeLa was beneficial in doing great things for mankind, but they forgot the source and took the credit and to me, that was wrong. What the author did was track down the children of Henrietta Lacks, get to know them, try to be a bridge in getting more info and all as well be the one to write this book as well as open a fund to help educate the descendents of this woman, that I like. what we the reader get is the WHOLE story. Henrietta's, her children and now her grandchildren. Once you finish, you'll never forget it.
0307269981|2.0|I was expecting a lot from this book series given the publicity, but I was disappointed at both the writing style as well as how far-fetched the plot was. I also found the computer-related material to be a lot of buzzwords, which didn't mean anything.

0385342047|4.0|I have read all the shopaholic books and am a great fan of Becky and all the other characters in the book including little Minnie now.  However, I was a little put off by Becky and Luke using the 'F...' word quite a lot in this latest book.  I don't remember them using such foul language before.  I think in the past Becky said \\"blimey\\" a lot instead.  It seems to me that now that they have Minnie they should watch their language a lot more.  Please Sophie Kinsella no more such language !!   Otherwise I loved the story.
0890090572|2.0|The book did not have the image as shown on the second picture on the customer image section. The book is somewhat dilapidated & seems to have been used because having a fold on the middle back is not usual for a new book. This is the first time I am highly disappointed with my purchase. I hope that the other two books I am expecting would not be the same as this one. Kindly post of images w/c the customer would actually receive as this is causing a wrong expectation. A pence more would be ok as long as you get what is promised (as what most of the time the images suggests) because its heart breaking if you get something way less than you expected. As with the content, I suggest that they arrange the stories in chronological order as it appeared in The Strand.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I loved this book.  It started a little slow but I was hooked early on and couldn't put it down.  The twist and turns are unexpected.  The writer did an excellent job of keeping me on the edge of my seat. Needless to say I couldn't start the next book in this series fast enough.
0525951652|3.0|Ken Follet knows how to tell stories. This is true again for this book. It is easy to dive into the plot and forget the world around you. You get acquainted with the characters fast and and are anxious to know what is going to happen to them and how they make out on their way. Therefore, it is a great book to just forget everday-life and have many hours of reading fun.    However, as it is often the case with Ken Follet, the author's weak points are his characters - or the lack of them. The book does not contain any characters, it contains types. We never meet any interesting, complex personalities, we meet THE innocent boy, THE virtuous girl, THE capitalist, THE rich guy and so forth. The acting persons are either 100% or 100% evil and never in betwenn. This makes their actions predictable and an otherwise great story stale.  This circumstance and the announcement that this book is the first one in a series of sequels, seems to make the book a mass product wich the author is interested to sell rather than a book that was written with passion. I am pretty sure that we will meet the very same \\"characters\\" in one way or the other in the sequels, just in different situations or historic settings.    Therefore I rate the book with 3 stars - a nice story for entertainment, but don't expect a masterpiece or an exceptionally original piece of work.

0618918248|4.0|I liked this book a lot and regret that I don't own it as of now; this book can certainly be used as a reference handbook for refuting a lot of religious claims. People have complained that Dawkins didn't know much about religion when he wrote this book and that it isn't that well researched -- or, as one reviewer put it -- it's just him talking. This seems to be true, yet at the same time, I found that he covered quite a bit of ground in refuting why most people (whether they be fundamentalists or religious moderates, as opposed to sophisticated theologians) believe. I think Dawkins' arguments have been caricatured by people who haven't read this book properly and it is an absolute must-read. Still, this volume was not without issues and I hesitated before giving it four stars as opposed to three. Here are my complaints:    This book is mostly an easy read, but a couple chapters are designed to give you a headache and in any case, these chapters seemed to be more speculative. They ruin the flow of the book and won't seem to laypeople to have very definitive conclusions, which are what I think you need to stick to when trying to prove that religion is a delusion. I also found Dawkins' argument using the Anthropic Principle against Creation to be overly sophisticated and at the end, unconvincing. While I unfortunately received a horrid science education and thought I might just not be understanding Dawkins well, I saw John Polkinghorne responded to Dawkins' point the exact way I thought a theist would in his book, \\"Questions of Truth\\" and I (qua layman) found Polkinghorne's response to be more cogent.    Also, his brief treatment of SETI and how we should appreciate efforts to contact aliens seems to be faith-based in itself. Even if there are aliens are out there, why the heck would we want to contact them? First, it seems to be a tremendous waste of time and money shooting darts in the dark into the vast universe. Secondly, maybe them coming here would be nothing less than an invasion and they would take over our planet. Why would we want them to come here?    Finally, I thought his treatment of indoctrinating-faith-as-child-abuse was a bit disingenuous. To say religion is basically child abuse is to introduce the legal question of if religious people should be jailed and their kids all placed in foster homes. As much as we may feel religion is based on mistaken presumptions of the past and harms critical thinking skills, I think the fight is better taken through the educational system than through the legal system. Dawkins might agree, but he owes it to the reader to explicate on if he actually thinks religion should be prosecuted against as child abuse and if not, why not.
0439023513|5.0|I really enjoyed the Hunger Game series. I really had no idea what to expect with the final book, only that district 13 would play a big role. I, like many, did feel that the ending was a bit rushed though, especially with how Gail and her mother just disappeared from her life. I liked how nothing turned out the way the Katniss expected - district 13 was just as opressive as the captial, no one could be trusted, and everything from the first book was based on Katniss protecting Prim only to have that fall apart in the end. It is a nice ending to a great series.
0307269752|2.0|The hero seems like he's got the life the author wants.  Down on his luck because of conspiracies against him.  Really a great guy--who's only fault is being TOO irresistible and thus getting lots of action from the ladies.  It's really obviously written by a man--not that male authors are a bad thing--but I shouldn't be able to tell it because the female characters are one-note stereotypes and the male character is just what a man would want.<br /><br />Other than that, the prose drags at times, though overall, it's a murder mystery, and so if you can muddy through the first few chapters, the intrigue was enough to hook me after that so I'd keep reading.  I also think it's a bit of a crutch that there's a lot of hyperbole--the villain is MUCH WORSE THAN ANYONE IMAGINED!  That other bad guy is MUCH WORSE THAN ANYONE IMAGINED! This results in a lot of graphic unpleasant scenes. And then (vague spoiler alert) when they get the bad business guy, it's MUCH BETTER THAN ANYONE IMAGINED!<br /><br />I got through this one, but I won't be continuing on to the other books in the series.
B003L20IE2|5.0|Best movie of the year--- Pure Awesome in a can. I didn't originally expect much from this one, but it really was enjoyable. If you can just watch, take it for what it is, and go with the flow, it's a great ride. The video game / comic book feel is great. If only reality was as fun.     After watching the movie, I went out and bought the comics-- and they were great as well. The ending diverges a little, and the books obviously spend much more time on the back stories---much more info on Envy, Scott and Kim's past, Ramona, Stills, everything and more. Comparing the movie to the books-- I fully understand why most of the 7 evil ex's had less backstory-- but I felt that they kept the story linear and to the point. If you're just seeing it all for the first time, you can enjoy it all and not feel like you're missing anything. Definitely give it a shot. And, if you like it, the books are even better.
B0018M6J90|5.0|Set in 1939 London, the film follows Guinevere Pettigrew (Frances McDormand), a recently unemployed governess as she responds to an ad for work as a \\"social secretary\\" and into the glamorous show business world of American actress and singer Delysia Lafosse (Amy Adams). In the film, the often silly actress and the frumpy governess form an (often comic) bond. In the end, they discover that they need each other much more than either one could have expected.<br /><br />The art direction and nice musical score make this a delightful film reminiscent of the musicals of the '40s. The pivotal moment of Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day occurs when Delysia sings \\"If I Didn't Care\\" in a 1939 London nightclub. The seemingly glamorous, emotionally calculating American movie star is overcome in this moment of truth and still does a swell job with the tune made famous by the Ink Spots.

B000091OB6|2.0|I was really excited to purchase this album on vinyl and in fact always seeing it in the record store was one of the reasons I decided to jump into vinyl and get a turntable.  So when I finally picked up this Capitol Records \\"from the vault\\" edition I was expecting awesome sound    So I was pretty disappointed to hear very poor sound and numerous pops, clicks, hisses and general surface noise - even after cleaning it.  the retailer was a good sport and let me swap it out for another one but it didn't sound any better.      So even though the album is awesome I would strongly avoid this particular release.  If at all possible find a copy of the original vinyl release from the 80's - much better.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|Adapted from the book by the acclaimed author of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald Dahl's Fantastic Mr. Fox is by no means a movie only for children. In this Wes Anderson work, the art of stop-motion animation is at its finest. Fantastic Mr. Fox, voiced by George Clooney, and his wife (Meryl Streep) romp through the adventures of his reckless thieving ways. With intentional adult humor masked for those of the younger set, both young and old alike will enjoy the sly Mr. Fox and his court of characters.

076790592X|5.0|I never heard nor saw this book anywhere.  I saw an Interview of Mitch Albom on a Korean TV Station I always watch the Heart to Heart of Arirang program. I was at first fascinated with the title of the book when he mentioned about it and more encourage to keep on watching when I saw him signing book in a korean bookstore in Korea.  I giggled when he said he is in Korea when he doesn't even understand the language but still the way he carried himself and interacted with the customers who wanted his signature on this book.  When the host ask him what made him write this book, he mentioned that no one really wants to publish it because it doesn't fall into any category and the only reason is to help Morrie's family in his mounting medical bill and his funeral and as a tribute to the greatest man he had ever known and regretted he didn't keep in touch early on he would have missed a lot in life, and if he didn't see Morrie being interviewed by Ted Koppel what was already far ahead of his ALS he would just have been a long forgotten person in his past and probably not even missed it.  His demeanor while being interviewed was one to be admired.  He was so composed and was talking about Morrie as if he is still well and alive.  Until the time of his interview he can't possibly believe the result of publishing this book, it went to an unknown story to a blockbuster.    I went to Borders looking for this book out of curiousity, flip to look how it is to read a few pages here and there, so I sat comfortably on a couch with my feet tucked under by behind.  I didn't realized I was already reading pages by pages, not just flipping it.  I shed a few tears in silence but cannot hide my giggles.  In a matter of couple of hours, I realized I was already at his supposedly last interview so I just decided to finished it to the end.  Having read the book from cover to, I should have just left it and not bought it, but because of what the book stands for, I ended up buying it, while onthe bus on my way home, I can't help flipping pages to pages rereading parts that seems to have missed but not.  There is a magical mystery of this book about Morries's philosophy of there is no life without death. This is really a very touching story of a dying man leaving a legacy that we shouldn't be afraid of death but instead embrace it. I am encouraging everyone to read this book as it deals with the everyday challenges of life.
B003NX6ZDC|3.0|The Killers are my favorite band, so I was so very curious about the kind of work Brandon Flowers would do as a solo artist. The album definitely encompasses Flowers' love for his hometown of Las Vegas and is themed towards that. Unfortunately, the sound is not that of one you'd hear from The Killers (although each of their albums sounds different, it's still not the same). The songs seem to envelop a more bluesy, country feel. In addition, a certain collaborative feeling seems lost, and it's easy to tell that Brandon Flowers is alone in producing this work.<br />I'm not saying the songs on this album suck, they just lack the flare that The Killers were so amazing at and famed for. I really love the songs Crossfire and Jilted Lovers & Broken Hearts, but despise the song Playing With Fire.
0525951652|1.0|Hard to imagine how this pricing was justified.  I would have bought this if it was $10-12 but $20 is crazy.  I probably won't ever buy it now out of principle.
0525951652|1.0|Jumping aboard the boycott wagon in regards to the Kindle edition of this book. I just got my Kindle about a week ago. Part of the appeal of getting the Kindle was for environmental reasons. But mostly it was because I would be able to read quality books at a savings because of the no printing overhead. Now I am wondering why I bought it. The Kindle edition being more expensive than the printed copy just goes totally against the grain of why I bought the Kindle. Totally backwards pricing!!
B0036TGSR6|5.0|\\"The Ghost Writer\\" is far and away the best film of 2010, despite the criminal and moral controversy of Director Roman Polanski. Perhaps it is these very qualities which give him insight into dark and crooked minds, for let it be declared: Dark and crooked deeds are afoot in this film.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor's character--symbolically nameless in the film--replaces the dead \\"ghost writer\\" behind the memoirs of the previous prime minister of England. His (the PM's) dirty deeds come to light--a symbolic phrase representative of symbolic darkness and light throughout the film--and a firestorm of anger breaks loose at the revelation of torture the PM allowed to be used to gain information.<br /><br />Who, of course, can condone torture? This is where Polanski fairly shows both sides of this controversy and the related racial and religious profiling. Pierce Brosnan's character (the PM) asks pointedly: Which airline would you rather fly--the one that pulls certain people aside for close examination or the one that allows all passengers through checkpoint to prevent profiling? The answer is, of course, two-sided--the public answer and the private answer.<br /><br />So much is hidden and kept under lock and key (literally), but the deepest secret is not even known. McGregor's character discovers hidden information left by his deceased predecessor in the same room both inhabit(ed). The previous ghost writer's death was ruled accidental; the new ghost writer finally believes otherwise. Surely, the predecessor was killed and now maybe, he, too, is in terrible danger.<br /><br />When he finally discovers the deepest and darkest secret, it is too late.<br /><br />The acting is superlative all around, film editing is perfectly executed. Filmed in New England in a moody, misty, gloomy, almost menacing setting along the Atlantic coast, the story becomes reflective of its atmosphere: brooding, haunting, secretive, with each minute, each scene just sitting on the edge and suggestive of something imminently horrible. The great irony, as in the discovery of the torture the PM allowed, is the setting in Martha's Vineyard, the very name of refinement. But here, in its midst, is something dark. In fact, a wall-sized picture window overlooking this ominous ocean-front scene suggests the sinister watcher quality of the PM. Point: Such an excellent film must have an excellent director, so I give credit where it is due, despite that person's ugly baggage.<br /><br />I was completely blown away by \\"The Ghost Writer,\\" my pick for best movie of the year.great irony, as in the discovery of the torture the PM allowed, is the setting in Martha's Vineyard, the very name of refinement.

B000MNOX7Q|5.0|Just watch it! This the best movie I've seen in a long time!!! Very original plot
B000I9U75G|1.0|Wow.  Just.... wow.  Terrible acting, atrocious plot, terrible acting, godzilla appears to be built from the t-rex model in Jurassic Park and... did I mention terrible acting?  This movie is absolutely terrible.  And not terrible in the \\"so terrible its good\\" vein, either - just straight up terrible.  The only thing good about this movie is that it is so horribly, magnificently bad that I cannot imagine anyone ever trying to do this again.    This is the kind of film that permanently destroys an actor's career.  Seriously.  The two hours of your life would be better spent watching paint dry.  At least you wouldn't be rolling your eyes the entire time.
0307266303|5.0|569 reviews and 4.5 star average, what the heck can I possibly add to the discussion? Nothing, but I can drop five more stars into the pot. I've read the book twice and I'll read it again. After thirty years of running, MacOso managed to give me new insights like no writer, coach or fellow runner has done before. Running isn't a sport, it's an expression of what it means to human, to be alive, to be free.
B003XMUFGQ|1.0|i've been listening to the man for 30+ years and this is the WORST he's put out in at least that time. If I heard this on an elevator, I'd getout at the next floor and take the stairs....

B00129H7VS|5.0|If you even remotely enjoy anything about the history of WWII, please do yourself a favor and by this box set.  It's some of the finest work I've seen.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|Lost was, by far, the most well written and daring of television shows to date.  It was nice to see that others appreciated it as much as myself and my family did.  The complete collection has surprises in store for devoted fans who wish to take the time to solve the mysteries the packaging has in store.  I am saving up to get a Dharma Initiative tattoo, because I spent what I had saved on this gorgeous box set.
0439023513|1.0|I can't adequately express my disappointment with the final installment of this triology, it was really disappointing, and uninspired...and this is coming from someone that loves this story so much that I scheduled month in advance to have the release date off of work, just so I could sit around and soak up the story.     I'll admit that the series has always been a rather dark one, but it had that underlying promise of hope for a better future, good will triumph evil in the end, etc.. and characters so real that the reader was really invested in their individual stories. However, that aspect was completely missing in this book.     It was almost as if the author wanted to destroy everything and everyone just to make a philisophical point..and I'm not sure what point she was trying to make. We all know that war is terrible, but in every great tragedy their is always something redeeming or hopeful to hold on to. Not in this war; everything of beauty was taken away, everyone is destroyed physically, mentally, or emotionally, and in the end you are just left empty.  Katniss isn't strong, she's dull. Gale isn't down to earth, he's vengeful without a hart. Peeta isn't peace loving, he's broken The last ten pages of the book, meant to be a happy ending?...just aren't enough to redeem the characters, or repair the damage and heartbreak, the reader has experienced.  I fell sad and empty a day later after reading the book
B003XQRZ7E|2.0|Lets say I like this music which is probably true, sure Glenn sounds better than his days in Purple..... his solo albums are good and yes expectations are High in todays climate .... But let me spill my guts and get the bad over with. Joe Bonamassa plays out of his realm, sure he's great but Ritchie Kotzen would have beeb my first but a bankable name is the better choice.... Jason Bonham is in his Gee, I'm happy with this band mode and plays well considering the lack of original material..... Most of the songs sound similar lyrically to his last 4 cd's everything from Building the Machine .... to his latest effort appears , thinking quick without titles is the multiple freak flag reference from The voice of rock effort...... and with his best friend in CHICKENFOOT its a smart move for a rocker who gets minimal exposure here in the states...... So Glenn who pats himself consistently and many times on the back actually gets annoying and turns this into a bloated affair...... Had this project been a little more interesting lyrically it could have been a much better CD..... Sure it rocks but so does ASIA and Let's not compare Joe's because one continues to Surf while the other flounder's   Thanks
B003JTHETY|5.0|Really a good example of progressive heavy metal.  This album has every thing that makes Maiden great and shows off thier mastery of music. Yes it's a good partner album to dance of death yet it at times reminds you of Powerslave and Somwhere in time. If this is thier last studio effort they are really  going out on a high note.

0345505387|3.0|As a free library rental, The Exile is a satisfying enough addition to the Outlander series. If I had to pay $24.00 for it, I am not sure I'd be pleased.<br /><br />In the introduction to The Exile: An Outlander Graphic Novel Diana Gabaldon describes this work as a version of Outlander events told from the POV of Murtagh with a completely new storyline woven through them. I find this description a little misleading. Murtagh witnesses and participates in only a fraction of the events. The majority of the graphic novel consists of the scenes taken directly from Outlander. The \\"new storyline\\" starts off promising, but fizzles out by the end, because it hardly has any bearing on the events, it just lingers at the edges of the Jaime and Claire's story.<br /><br />Now to the art itself. I like how vividly colorful the drawings are, the landscapes are especially striking. The characters are another story. Whenever they are introduced in the novel, the images of them are great. Murtagh is attractively rugged, Jamie is a stud muffin a la Gabriel Aubrey. But then these images start deteriorating. Jamie by the end of the books looks like his ugly second cousin or something, sometimes I couldn't even recognize him among other characters. What happened? At least Claire is always easy to spot - she is consistently curly-haired with large breasts half exposed.<br /><br />The story boards. I haven't read many graphic novels, but I found The Exile to be awkwardly structured. The story doesn't flow very well and the transitions between the scenes are often confusing. I don't think a person not familiar with Outlander would be able to understand what is going on.<br /><br />All in all, I did like this novel. It is a pleasure to see the images of the characters you know from your favorite books. But I felt the characters could have been written with more consistency and the story itself could have been more interesting and exciting. Nothing truly new or of importance is offered here.
0446560065|5.0|absolutely love the youtube videos and was thrilled to find this book which is just as entertaining!
0525951652|1.0|It's a shame that the publishers have a monetary stake in the book binding companies. It is clear that they are protecting their revenue.     I will wait til this book reaches the NY Times best seller list. Then, per Amazon/Kindle promise, it will be $9.99, right? I do see the irony in the posibility that all these 1 star reviews could potentially keep it off the list. I'm sure that Amazon does not have that kind of traction.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|Remember when you read your first fantasy novel and the hero shot magic fireballs out of their hands?  Remember how you felt?  You get that same feeling here.    I've read others' reviews of this book and agree with a lot of them.  This is a solid 4-1/2 stars, I've read the whole series and loved it.  I agree with a lot of reviewers that the execution of the story could have been a little better, the dialogue in certain parts could have been a little better and some of the supporting characters could have been fleshed out a bit more, but the book makes up for that in its uniqueness.  That's the reason I gave it amazon's 5th star.      The world is a different setting than all the fantasy I've read to date.  The \\"Magic\\" is not really magic, there are no spells, it's allomancy... it's best you read the novels to find out and experience that feeling you had as a kid when things were new!    As for the entire series, I thought it was excellent.  This is one of those series where each book got better because the author got better at writing with each book released.  At the end of the last book, I couldn't help but feel that it was... epic.  Events at the end of the final book tied back to events throughout the whole story and it was evident the author had really thought out the entire series up front. (If he didn't then it sure as heck felt so).    I only give out 5 stars to my favorites, and this series is one of them.
B003J27WFW|4.0|RUSH- Beyond the Lighted Stage DVD-2010<br /><br />Rush. The Canadian wonder has long deserved a substantial media exploration..if for no other reason the rabid fans that have long been associated with the band will chew on any crumb of information or insight that the trio might offer...for the novice or non fan, Beyond the Lighted Stage is a worthwhile endeavor to aid in understanding just exactly what makes Rush tick beyond all reason and against all odds.<br />Scott McFadyen and Sam Dunn, the filmmakers behind Metal: A Headbanger's Journey and the Iron Maiden concert movie Iron Maiden: Flight 666 lend their creative eye and straightforward approach to telling Rush's story which is as much about their bond and friendship as it is about their progressive rise to success despite early criticism, difficult band personalities and a nonconformist approach to being a rock band.<br /><br />The band's tightness and mutual respect for each other is shown through archival footage and coverage of them off stage--you see the unit that is RUSH and insight into each individual member, and whether fan or detractor, it is clear why Geddy, Alex and Neil work as friends and as musicians.<br /><br />McFayden and Dunn also give the non Rush fan reasons...reasons why the band got together, reasons why they stayed when the mainstream press boo'd them off of the pages of the trades, reasons why they struck a chord with an unique and loyal fan base and why they continue 30+ years later. The best motivation to get this DVD?...instead of pandering and glorifying the band, McFayden and Dunn cover the icky bits as well... Lee's most unusual vocal style, Peart's notorious attitude towards their fans, early changes to the band's lineup and even a self depreciating segment on the band's self proclaimed lack of style.<br /><br />Perhaps one of the most surprising aspects of the documentary, are the interviews with the \\"other fan base\\" Rush attracts...fellow musicians who site them as major influences.. Billy Corgan, Gene Simmons, Trent Reznor, Zakk Wylde, Sebastian Bach and Tim Commerford round out a diverse group of well respected performers who joined the Rush club early and have never left.<br /><br />Whether you have a vast collection of ticket stubs in a Rush scrapbook or not- \\"Beyond the Lighted Stage\\", is a worthy tribute to a band and a fitting premise that love them or hate them, you are compelled to respect them.<br /><br />Kim Thore 4 Stars<br />All Access Magazines, Trent Reznor, Zakk Wylde, Sebastian Bach and Tim Commerford round out a diverse group of well respected performers who joined the Rush club early and have never left.

0811870413|5.0|I've been baking bread in northern California for 20 years now. I've worked with some of the best in the area (and some of the worst). I also worked with and trained Nick Scott (son of Alan Scott) . I have never met Chad, but I have always admired his bread. If you want the truth about real bread, this book is a must have.
0525951652|1.0|Great book, lousy precedent.  Accordingly, I really must rate this book, POOR.  Honestly, I do not believe that Amazon should have even offered this book on the Kindle, for it will only encourage absolute greed by many authors and publishers.  Indeed, we should all remember that two of the joys of the Kindle is to avoid the cost associated with a hard cover book (i.e. binding, distribution costs, store overhead, etc.) and, for the tree hugger in me,, to lessen the environmental problems associated with hard print publishing.   There is absolutely no rationale basis for the price on this book, for we are all aware that the electronic distribution is more or less done at no hard costs.  Fair royalties and profit should certainly be paid, but the key word is FAIR.      The author (as good as he is), as well as the publisher and Amazon, are starting a very very evil trend, and I for one suggest that Kindle consumers should not buy any mass market books at this sort of cost, regardless of the number of pages.     In reading the comments so far, I would appreciate it if folks who disagree with me will not bother to tell me to \\"grow up\\", or that I am foolish to condemn  this sort of behavior by the author and  the publisher.  Further, Kindle should be be more selective in permitting authors to publish to Kindle electronically, at such a high price.  Are the Kindle users not already being penalized enough by publishers by the long delays that are often occurring to get a book offered ON the Kindle, from the hard cover publishing date?
0440423023|3.0|I'm in a hard way to judge \\"The Hard Way.\\" For those who like all plot, poor writing skills and little in the way of characterization, this and other Lee Child books are probably great. This one, for me, was about as interesting as cotton candy. This is the only Lee Child book I have read, I confess. But, based on this one, I won't read another. The characters are all stock, as if he picked them off a store shelf and plugged them in to his story. They all talk the same--man, woman, child, foreign born. They are just there for the purpose of jerking you along the author's plot line. They have no life of their own. If you removed certain phrases that are used over and over again, like \\"back in the day,\\" and \\"Reacher said nothing,\\" you could probably cut the total word count in half. Using a period instead of a comma does not a writing style make. OK, this guy is wildly popular. This is a minority report. But Lee Child is not another John Le Carré, Graham Greene, or even John MacDonald. If you enjoy good writing and interesting characters in your crime fiction, approach Lee Child with caution. He may be armed and dangerous.
B003YHSE7W|4.0|I just watched part 2. Mmmmmmm.. It was a good movie with alot of action and they didn't go overboard with it like some reviewers say. I think it was a good balance with action just like part 1. But what I think part 2 lacked was the story. Part 1 had a better story to tell because he was discovering IRON MAN and thats always the best of any movie. The thing is as with most movies, part 1 is usually the best because the story is fresh and new. I think if there never was a part 1 and this was the first of the series.. then it would get a higher rating. But theres that part 1 to compare it too now and so this is what happens. Would I own it on Blu-Ray? YES. And thats saying alot because it has to be a great movie for me to actually buy it. I watched it on a rental DVD but I will buy it on Blu-Ray now that i've seen it. I give it 4 stars because 5 stars to me means theres no better movie out there but I give it a good 4 stars.
B000NU2CY4|4.0|Title says it all, the movie is phenomenal.  Top 5 any day of my lifetime.  But getting it on bluray is somewhat pointless.  You don't notice too much difference even in the sound quality but than again I only have a 5.1 and not a 7.1 system.
B003M7BLOW|4.0|yes, the Athlon II does not have any L3 cache, but that fact doesnt really hurt the performance very much, when you compare a Phenom II X4 to an Athlon II X4, the Athlon is more worth the money, but if you have a little more cash lying around the Phenom in general will offer you great performance for a modest price increase, plus the ability to overclock a great deal, where the Athlon doesnt overclock very well at all comparatively.<br />so far it has done everything ive thrown at it quite well, compared to my old dual core intel processor, it was a HUGE improvement. the stock heat sink and fan are also pretty good, nice and quiet and also the processor doesnt heat up too much. the packaging is no-nonsense, it just comes in a small box with just enough room for the heatsink/fan and the processor itself.<br />overall, in my opinion the Athlon II X4 is an amazing product for the price, its not built for super hardcore gaming or overclocking, but you dont expect anything at this price range to be for that.<br /><br />UPDATE4/5/2011:I regret skimping on the processor when I built my computer. true this is a value processor, but what Ive found is that my processor is the bottleneck for my computer's performance. its not a perfect processor by any means, If you have a little extra money on hand and plan on using your computer for moderate to heavy gaming, you should spend a little more to get a phenom II, the 20-30% more speed/efficiency will help you to no end. however, If you are not going to use it for any gaming or super heavy duty processing, an athlon II will be more than enough to take care of your needs.<br /><br />Build:<br />[[ASIN:B003964KK8 ASUS M4A89GTD PRO/USB3 - AM3 - AMD 890GX - DDR3 - USB 3.0 SATA 6 Gb/s - ATX Motherboard]]<br />[[ASIN:B003M7BLOW AMD Athlon II X4 640 Propus 3.0 GHz 4x512 KB L2 Cache Socket AM3 95W Quad-Core Processor - Retail ADX640WFGMBOX]]<br />[[ASIN:B002LE8D2A Corsair 4GB Dual Channel Corsair DDR3 Memory for Intel Core i5 Processors (CMX4GX3M2A1600C9)]]<br />[[ASIN:B001MTYS06 OCZ OCZ550FTY Fatal1ty Series 550W Power Supply]]<br />[[ASIN:B000Q82PIQ Western Digital Caviar Blue 500 GB Bulk/OEM Hard Drive 3.5 Inch, 16 MB Cache, 7200 RPM SATA II WD5000AAKS]]<br />[[ASIN:B003E474NA Thermaltake V5 Black Edition Mid-Tower Gaming Chassis VL70001W2Z (Black)]]<br />[[ASIN:B002SIMPXM Lite-On LightScribe 24X SATA DVD+/-RW Dual Layer Drive IHAS424-98 - Retail (Black)]]CMX4GX3M2A1600C9)]]<br />[[ASIN:B001MTYS06 OCZ OCZ550FTY Fatal1ty Series 550W Power Supply]]<br />[[ASIN:B000Q82PIQ Western Digital Caviar Blue 500 GB Bulk/OEM Hard Drive 3.5 Inch, 16 MB Cache, 7200 RPM SATA II WD5000AAKS]]<br />[[ASIN:B003E474NA Thermaltake V5 Black Edition Mid-Tower Gaming Chassis VL70001W2Z (Black)]]<br />[[ASIN:B002SIMPXM Lite-On LightScribe 24X SATA DVD+/-RW Dual Layer Drive IHAS424-98 - Retail (Black)]]
0780650441|5.0|Even on first viewing I really liked this film. I loved the acting and the style but somehow I felt a certain emotional distance keeping me from labeling it great.<br /><br />But on second viewing, I found myself far more deeply moved, while still being intellectually challenged by the moral, emotional and ethical complexity of the story of a brilliant quadriplegic man with much to give the world wanting to die. Bardem gives a truly heartbreaking, world class performance, and is closely matched by those around him. Director Amenabar also wrote the score for his own film and it is terrific and original. Throughout, there were stylish touches that gave me a visceral shiver. A few simplistic scenes, and slower moments keep me from calling it a perfect film, but it's not far off.

B003HC8I5M|4.0|There is no question that when it has came down recent artists doing all cover albums, they just have felt like they've trashed the authentic feeling of what the original songs have scored. From the lackluster albums of Rod Stewart's last year's Soulbook and Boyz II Men's 2009 poorly-recognized, Love, and Barry Manilow's The Greatest Love Songs Of All Time (released earlier this year), there just hasn't shown to be much in great artists really capturing the feeling of the classics. But for Phil Collins, he went through a whole lot the past several years that really made him consider leaving music altogether. From the end of his marriage, all the way to a sever injury which nearly cost Phil his ability to play drums, it looked like Phil was on his way out of the music business. But, he had a lot of high noted with his days with Genesis which included a reunion tour, and this past year's indusction into the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame for the group. But would all the highlights bring him back, yes and Phil has tried it again with his newest work turning back the clock.<br /><br />Going Back, Phil Collins' first solo album since 2002's Testify, brings in a more original feeling of the classic 50's and 60's era of great R&B / Soul Music that actually feels like a treat, and not a waste of money on the pocket. The songs and the feeling sound great, as Phil delivers really well on classics from the title track, Going Back, to Girl (Why You Wanna Make Me Blue,) to (Your Love Is Like A) Heatwave. Each song really is worth its effort, and delivers well from start to finish. Phil also doesn't make the album feel like it is cheap or not worth the effort. I was absolutely amazed that Phil still delivers really strong, with the past year so far delivered really poorly made albums from jokes like Rihanna and Miley Cyrus. The record is a great trip that brings out those classic days of 1950's malt shop days and sock hop dances.<br /><br />All in all, while Going Back might not appeal to those whom are new to hearing Phil Collins music for the first time, as would be his classics like Sussusio and In The Air Tonight, or hits from his Genesis days like Invisible Touch showed to stand the testiments of time. Still it is a treat for die hard Phil Collins fans who've awaited his long return, and anyone whom is just tired of those cover albums from Rod Stewart and Barry Manilow that've just gotten very tiring. I absolutely recommend Phil Collins new album Going Back. It is honestly one of the very few good buys of 2010.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B+<br /><br />Price: B+<br /><br />Mastering: B+<br /><br />Overall: B+re new to hearing Phil Collins music for the first time, as would be his classics like Sussusio and In The Air Tonight, or hits from his Genesis days like Invisible Touch showed to stand the testiments of time.

B003J27WFW|5.0|Okay, until about 2 years ago, I was decidedly in the camp of women who would tolerate Rush on behalf of the husband/boyfriend who has been obsessed with them since birth, but wouldn't necessarily call myself a \\"fan\\" of Rush. I knew one or two of their songs from high-school and even sort-of liked Tom Sawyer and Limelight, but I really had little knowledge of the band nor an appreciation of their musicianship, etc.<br /><br />In 2002, my DH took me to a concert on the Snakes and Arrows tour while I was 7 months pregnant with our first child, and aside from the \\"fragrant\\" audience members nearby, I truly enjoyed the show and was suprised by how many of the songs I actually knew.  Mostly, though, I enjoyed the light-show and the washing machines and found myself wondering what hair-product Geddy used, and whether Alex was a natural blonde, stuff like that.  Still, Rush remained somewhere in the Top 20 of my all-time faves behind U2, The Police, Zeppelin, Dave Matthews, Van Halen, Eric Clapton, Journey, etc.  The introduction of Rock Band and Rock Band 2 in our household began to change all that however, and, as our faux-band's intermittent vocalist/bassist, the Rush songs quickly became my favorites to play while on tour with \\"Needs Swabbed.\\"  (Don't ask!)  By far some of the most challenging and enjoyable songs for a wanna-be Rock Star to play of the entire RB setlist are Camera Eye, YYZ, and Working Man!<br /><br />Fast-forward to Spring/Summer 2010, my husband and I attended a showing of Beyond the Lighted Stage at our local artsy-theatre, and, all of a sudden, I just \\"got it.\\"  These are three guys who are true musicians, who write meaningful songs about things that matter in life as opposed to smut, who are committed to their wives and families, were never defined by drug-abuse and womanizing, who never sold-out musically, and who genuinely like each other after 40 years.  What other band can you honestly say all of that about that is still around today?<br /><br />As a female, music has to have some sort of an emotional hook to it in order for there to be a lasting connection and to truly win me over.  Sort of like watching football.  If I know the story behind the team or if there is a player who has overcome great odds or has done something great in life outside the field, then I can get excited about watching a game and rooting for a particular team.  I can't just watch some random team for the pleasure of the game itself.  Sorry.  Same holds true for music.  I can appreciate certain songs for the difficulty of the playing or the beauty of the vocals or intricacy of the lyrics, but a true connection with a song or band is rare.  Either it has to have been relevant for me at a certain stage in my life so as to bring me back to a place in time, or there has to be a story behind it.  Rush has an amazing story.  I just can't help but genuinely \\"like\\" the guys as people first, and I am now listening to their songs with a whole different perspective and connectedness.  I truly get excited about rooting for them to keep bringing amazing music to their devoted fans and new fans alike, and can't wait for our kids to be old enough to see them in concert!<br /><br />In July 2010, my husband and I attended the Rush concert in Saratoga Springs, NY, and although we were some 30 rows back, we both felt like teenagers again and had a whole new level of connection to each other because of our shared love for the band and the music.  Completely different experience this time as compared to the show we attended together in 2002, and the more I'm learning about Rush (just finished Neil Peart's Ghost Rider...a must read!), the more I'm looking forward to seeing more shows together (please keep touring guys!).  Being one of the only \\"hot chicks\\" (husband's term, not mine!) at the show was kinda fun too, given the 80/20 ratio of dudes to babes, and walking into the ladies room \\"line-free\\" was a first for sure!/>As a female, music has to have some sort of an emotional hook to it in order for there to be a lasting connection and to truly win me over.

0312600844|3.0|I went into this book with great hope and excitement.  Maybe that's the problem with a book that's overly-hyped.  I enjoyed \\"The Corrections\\" (\\"Dad just fell off the ship\\" is one of my favorite lines in all of literature), but I just couldn't make it with this one.  I once heard John Cheever at Harvard; when asked what books he read he said, \\"Anything I can get past the third page of...\\" Well, I went fifty pages further, but just couldn't hang on. I found the characters unattractive, which does not mean that I require my characters to be chic or handsome, simply \\"reader friendly,\\" as in, for example, \\"A Super Sad True Love Story,\\" or anything by Roth, Oates or Richard Ford.  I need to feel for them and, yes, identify with them. And yes, I need to have a tiny bit of levity with my angst.   So, enough already. Maybe I'll pick it up later, when I'm in a better mood.  Or maybe it put me in this mood. Hmm.
B00006BTCA|4.0|this record has some great moments. love the out of tune bass on untitled. great changes and melodies.
B000L212HW|5.0|A B-Movie is a film that borderlines on dumb. It has a sub-par script and is acted by \\"B-list\\" actors. A perfect example of this would be any movie that has Katherine Heigl in it, or any movie produced by the Wayans brothers. B-movies, in general, are not good. If it has special effects, they usually aren't good either.     These qualifiers do not describe Reign of Fire in any way, shape or form. When this movie was released, it slipped under the radar of the mainstream movie-going public. This fact does not make it a B-movie. It makes it an ignored movie.     Some reviewers here have said that this movie starts off \\"slow.\\" Basically, that means there is actual story development you have to pay attention to before you get to the action. (And when you do get to the action it's intense.) I showed this movie to some friends who had never heard of it, and now they want to buy it for themselves. I will buy the Blu-ray edition for them as a gift. That's about as good an endorsement any DVD can get.    It is not a B-movie.
B003XQRZ7E|4.0|Finally, a super-group that lives up to the sum of its parts. The key aspect to this album's success is that it's played with real verve and conviction. Other super-groups can have a tendency to rest on their laurels, as if their presence alone is going to spark something. But this album has something special going on and I can't quite put my finger on it. In a way, it's a bit like being greeted by an old friend; there's certainly no shortage of classic rock-isms which add familiarity (Deep Purple, Who, AC/DC are obvious but mid-era Rush comes through too). In fact you could probably play a decent game of spot the \\"influence\\" for each track (\\"Sista Jane\\" is a proper mash-up of Clapton's Crossroads solo with AC/DC backing!). But there's something sufficiently breezy about it too. Maybe it's Joe Bonamassa's flair - previously confined to a more bluesy orientation? Maybe it's the fact Glenn Hughes is approaching sixty but still sings like a god? (Another reviewer described him as \\"shrieky\\", which he does with style if you ask me, but he mixes it up with some real belting so I don't care). Maybe - and I think this is it - it's the softer, balladeer moments of rock: these are presented with true care and craft. The one thing I don't get is the comparison with Led Zeppelin. Okay, Hughes operates a high vocal register, but just because there's a Bonham present and sparks are flying off the neck of a Les Paul does not a Led Zeppelin make. Black Country communion lack the folksy edge anyway and are more anthemic and chorus-led. If there's one gripe (and it's one mentioned quite frequently) it's that Derek Sherinian is totally underutilised; he used to play in Dream Theater for chissakes! The man can play! Overall it's an enjoying and engaging listen. So why not 5 stars? It's not pant-wettingly inventive. But it's great fun!
B003HC8I5M|5.0|When I first heard the 30 seconds samples of this album I was like, ok, Phil Collins is doing a tribute album to Motown.  I like listening to Motown but not a huge fan. After listening to this cd a few times, I have come away very impressed.  Once you listen to it a few times, you can tell, Phil has poured his heart and soul into this project; not just going though the motions.  I just can't stop listening to the single, Going Back, one of the best version done of this song.  I have listened to Freddy Mercury, Dusty Springfield, The Byrds and Bruce Springsteen versions, and I have to say, Phil is my favorite. Definitely hope this album gives Phil the drive to go back into the studio and make a new record with new songs soon.  Welcome back Phil! You have been missed!
B003VIWO9I|2.0|I pre-ordered this book -ages- ago and had been extremely excited to get my hot little hands on it. When the book came, I tore open the package, sat down, and consumed it.  And now that I have, I write this knowing full well that most people will disagree with my take on it. However, like Unseen Academicals and Monstrous Regiment, I disliked this story from the beginning.    I appreciate that he addressed -real- topics that happen in real life--domestic violence, the power of hate, the ugliness of rumors, and the bittersweet nature of growing into adulthood in general. He knows damned well that kids are more than able to deal with these topics, especially if they are being written about in an intelligent, thoughtful manner. That is one of the things I always have loved about Pratchett and that I always will, especially in his kids books. I reread most of my Discworld books at least once every few years--my absolute favorites I reread at least once a year. A few treasured ones (for me, Feet of Clay is my ultimate Discworld book, with the other Guard books behind it) are reread several times.    But this one felt...forced and stilted to me, from the start. Admittedly, part of that is the style. The beauty of Pratchett has always been in his utterly genius way with words, the way he skillfully takes innocent looking words and strings and slides them together into a prose that almost seems to glow on the page with a sly and intelligent sense of humor that -at the very same time- manages to make very real social commentary about our own world. This book lacked that same flow of words and blazingly fast wit. Before people pile on, I understand the main reason behind the style issue (apparently this book had to be dictated) and (frankly) am rather in awe of the achingly (ha, no pun intended!) brief but sweet glimpses of the turns of phrases that were prime Pratchett that occur occasionally in the book.    That said, the real problem with the story for me, period, was the actual....story. The villain was definitely scary but despite this, I found that I disliked MANY of the new characters in the story. The idea of new characters themselves don't bother me. (Moist Von Lipwig is still one of my favorite Discworld characters and Tiffany? Is fantastic!) But I violently disliked Amber, Preston, Leticia, the Duchess, Derek,  and the urban witches. I disliked how several of the characters behaved in the book and the strange way their strange behavior never....really....got addressed. (Two in particular? Jeanne and Roland.) There was also the resurfacing of an long-gone Discworld character that made no sense, seemed tossed in for no particularly good reason and who, ultimately, contributed very little beyond a bit of 'so this is the backstory'. Tiffany's 'adventure' in Anhk-Morpork made zero sense as I read it and seemed, quite frankly, horribly forced.      As I read the book, I was to surprised to find that I felt angry the entire time and I violently threw the book away once I finished. I will reread it down the road and give it another try after some time passes but I'm not anticipating liking it on a second read (I didn't like Unseen Academicals or Monstrous Regiment on a second read either.) I understand where the more positive reviews are coming from  but I have to say, when I finished reading this book, I was extremely disappointed.    Will I buy the next Discworld book? Absolutely, even while knowing I may well dislike it (won't know till I read it). Do I still love Terry Pratchett? Without even a smidge of doubt. Did I enjoy this book? Not even a tiny amount.

B0000A0DRY|5.0|I only wish I could have gotten this album on CD in MONO rather than Stereo; it sounds much, much better. There's entirely way too much echo in stereo. You have only to listen to the few single releases included on this CD like SOMEBODY TO LOVE to hear what a better sound MONO is; at least for this group.

I would highly recommend this book to fans of Diana's Outlander series or any lover of a well crafted story.

B002VWNID6|1.0|If it's not King Arthur corrupting the use of Hadrian's Wall, then it must be....Robin Hood! Most of the reviews talk about the quality of the transfer or the cinematography.  This movie is nothing but incredible nonsense historically.  The first problem is that the movie leaves out the chief antagonist, King Richard's despotic and younger brother Prince John and focuses its entire attention on the Sheriff of Nottingham [John and the Sheriff represent reactionary Norman exclusivity and materialism, unlimited domination and unrestrained taxation while Richard and Robin stand for the rule of law, religious tolerance and the unity of all of peoples inhabiting England].  The city of Nottingham is nowhere near Hadrian's Wall as it is in the East Midlands of the United Kingdom, yet here we have Robin Hood strolling over Hadrian's Wall in extreme northern England as he returns from the Crusades!  Of course, the screenwriters need Hadrian's Wall in order to introduce the cataclysmic \\"Star Wars\\"-like battle-scene-in-the-trees between the bloodthirsty and inappropriately-named \\"Celts\\" and the outlaws (Saxons), because no self-respecting Celt lived near Sherwood Forest at this time in reality, having been purged from this area by the Romans ten centuries earlier!<br /><br />No ones knows if the tautologically-described \\"Celts\\" are Britons, Scots or Picts and, truth is, no one really cares--it is just the fiery action that matters!  There is an apparent but nonsensical trichotomy between the Saxons (now the outlaws hiding out in Sherwood Forest but once the original English), the \\"Celts\\" (even earlier native romanized Welsh or non-romanized Picts or Scots) and the new rulers, the Norman French.  How the Sheriff gets the Celts to fight for him when they hated Norman French control, were once allied with the Saxons and, after he lost his accumulated taxes of gold to Robin Hood, is never explained. Another uncomfortable plot error? Perhaps he just offered them a pig roast and some beer, after all, we are supposed to believe that all these folks care about is fighting, right?  Never mind, it's just a movie, the plot is not supposed to make sense!  Note to Hollywood:  at least find a different location to shoot at, this viewer is tired of seeing Hadrian's Wall misused in every motion picture!fter all, we are supposed to believe that all these folks care about is fighting, right?

It also has some lovely cinematography, several engaging performances (including solid chemistry between the love interests), and rousing action. The \\"second chances\\" aspect of the story undermines its dramatic weight, but then the story is not primarily dramatic. Instead, the story works as a modern swashbuckler, with the emphasis on sweeping romance and gleaming daggers.

B0021L8V1G|5.0|There is alot more Tony than there is Iron Man but to me thats okay because its Robert Downey Jr. At first though i was turned off by changing who played Rhoades but when i found out it was Cheadle i was ok with it. I think Rourke played a great villian but the fight scene at the end did seem kind of short between Stark and Rhoades against Ivan but the action was great and to me there was plenty of it and its got quite a bit of A listers in it with Downey, Paltrow who i hope is in the Avengers film and if they Make an Iron Man 3, Cheadle, Rourke, Johanssan, Jackson, Bettany, and Favreau who is in the movie alot more which is fine by me because i think he should have been in more of the first one. My only problem was with the shipping because they dropped it off at the wrong place and it took me two days to find out where but to me that doesnt count agaisnt the movie it self so it still says at a 5 star. And for some of you that most likely turned it off at the end i would suggest you fast forward to the end of the credits because you get to see a small sneak peak of Thor so if you are looking forward to that you get to see his hammer but still it gives you something. So great movie definitly a buy cant wait to see the next to films of Captain America and Thor to see what thats going to be like and of course The Avengers film.
0525951652|1.0|I will not be buying this--it is outrageous to charge more for the Kindle version than the hardcover.  If Amazon can't stop them, perhaps an organized group of Kindle owners can get the point across.  I have bought many books, but will not be buying this one.
B0001K9IJ8|5.0|This is the second purchase of what has become a Diana Krall obsession.  I mainly bought this for the surround sound experience and ended up just plain enjoying the performance.  Diana uses very talented backup musicians, has a slow and deliberate presentation and has a great sound, especially if you enjoy the intimacy of small ensemble presentations.  I can close my eyes and almost see Diana, in a small jazz environment belting out the toons.  I recommend this DVD highly and am very glad it is in my library.

After an eight year absence where he recording a couple of Disney soundtracks and did a reunion tour with Genesis the man is back in the studio with a new album!  Granted, it's an album filled with Motown songs, but seeing that it's been seven years since he released \\"Testify\\" (which was a rather lackluster album) I'll take what I can get.  Besides, it's not like are terrible songs.  On the contrary: Motown produced many of the greatest radio songs of all time.  Some of them make it onto this very album.  What's more amazing is that Collins records them sounding almost exactly like they did way back when.  This is both a pro and a con.  The pro is that the great sound hasn't been messed with much.<br /><br />The con is that since the songs are only different in the sense that Collins is singing them some of the recordings come off as inferior compared to the original. \\"Uptight (Everything Is Alright)\\" is a great song regardless how you slice it, but if the music in two versions sound the same who would you rather listen to: Phil Collins or Stevie Wonder?  I'll let you be the judge of that.  There are plenty of classic toe tapping numbers on this album (most of which - I noticed - are heavy with drums).  There are also many Motown songs that aren't nearly as popular but prove to be full of that Motown sound just the same.  I'm not sure if the title track (which closes the album) is a Motown song or an original.  Yeah it SOUNDS like a Motown hit...but then again, I've never heard this before, and I know my oldies!<br /><br />The album is 18 tracks of pure bliss.  If bought on Amazon.com or iTunes the album is expanded to 26 tracks of bliss.  This is a great listen.  That said I'll understand if longtime Phil Collin fans aren't just a tad disappointed.  I mean, we waiting eight years for a covers album?  Isn't that something Barry Manilow or Westlife is supposed to be doing?  I get it.  I can't say I'm disappointed too.  So many years of waiting and we only get one original track (which may not even be original to begin with)?  Oh well, I'll take it.  The album is too much fun to knock it too much.  Besides when Collins gets serious he tends to get depressing, so maybe it's good the comeback album leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />Grade: **** stars.

0345438205|3.0|The book was ok but, lets just say, it will never ever be made into a movie. Its interesting looking into the technology that will be here 1000 years from now but the book only gives us slight insights into how earth's society has evolved for the better. That's where Star Trek does a much better job. The ending is not really an ending to the series.

The price was fair for a new book by a top author, and while my wife has a Kindle, I wanted a hard cover version since I know I'm going to want to share this and keep it on the shelf.  I also like to feel I'm progressing through the book - call me old school.  Later, I looked at the review rating distribution to see what others thought and was surprised to see the large numbers of negative reviews.  Thinking I had bought a rare Follett stinker, I started to read the reviews and quickly realized that it was a protest on the Kindle pricing.    I think it's a flawed argument to say that the Kindle version should be cheaper.  That only works if you believe that books should be priced on a cost plus basis - lower production and distribution costs should equal lower selling costs, right? Well, using that argument, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone should then have been priced way lower than the rest of the series, since the rights fees were relatively low, due to Rowling's status as an unknown author.  That didn't happen.  Conversely, several readers have made the point that this is a book that highlights the value of a Kindle since the electronic version is easier to carry.  Why should the author and publisher make less money by giving consumers an added benefit?  If I were them and knew I'd lose revenue with a cheaper Kindle version, I'd simply delay the release of the Kindle version, similar to how a DVD comes out only months after a movie is in theaters.  Would that be preferable to those of you who took offense at the pricing?  This industry isn't here as a charity.  Regardless, you are all free to vote with your comments and pocketbook, as you are doing.      I'm putting this note as a one star review to interject an opposing viewpoint into this discussion - if you agree you can vote this useful, otherwise, you're also free to disagree and send my note to the bottom of the Amazon heap.  I'm sure I'll enjoy the book in any case.
0439023513|4.0|I must say I did enjoy the first two books in this series best.  That being said, I had a hard time putting the book down.  There was never a dull moment with the lives of all the chacters in Katniss' world.  The setting for this story is quite a bit different than the first two with the Hunger Games being center stage.  If my family is anything like yours, you will either LOVE the ending, or HATE it!  Once again there is never a dull moment throughout the book.  Suzanne Collins does a nice job of taking all the characters down their own path.  If you have read the first two books this is a must to find out what happens to all of those we have come to know and love!  I am very sad that it has all come to an end, I loved all three books!
B002ZG977Y|1.0|This movie lacks of everything : Story is nonsense, actors are wooden, edition is horrible, trailed had more CGI than the movie itself (the trailer was even more dramatic and better developed than the movie itself!!) and absolute boring and mediocre music.    Anyone who spent $ just to see a 2 min footage of the Kraken (in the trailer you can see more of it than in the movie) and say this is just for \\"fun\\" and the \\"CGI were good\\" its totally insane.    The plot is ridiculous! gods want to punish men for their disrespect, but at the end of the movie they remain unpunished, and gods had no problem with it!    The pacing is bad as it could be! In 10 minutes the story is in the middle of the plot.    The music has nothing to do with the greeks, or even with epic movies, or anything. Djawadi is just a sucker of Zimmer and get works just cos he is a student of him. His composition are dull, boring, lack of inspiration, and badly orquestrated (he doesnt even use real instruments, just orquestra samplers, and he doesnt know how to use those softwares yet, you can see he just do his less effort if you know the posibilities of those softwares)    For people who dont understand why this movies are made like this : ITS JUST TO CREATE A SORT OF FRANCHISE. If you think they made a movie after a game will make lot of sense, you have at least 90% of fight scenes (men against Hades spirits, guys against scorpions, guys against monster in the woods, guys against medusa, guys against kraken)  For an Arcade game, this is ok, it is suposed you spend more time playing than watching scenes with story development. WHICH IS TOTALLY OPPOSITE TO WHAT A MOVIE SHOULD BE!! Its the same with the star wars prequels.  But we know Luca$$ is a greedy bast and wants to win money only, and he has to make his PC and PS2 games faithfull to the movie, but lets cut with the greed you hollywood animals!!    Avoid this movie at ALL COST!! This is a NON BUY OR DIE situation!!

B003YBNREI|5.0|Similarly to Steely Dan with their [[ASIN:B00004GOXS Two Against Nature]] The Doobie Brothers waited a decade since their previous album to release this.It's on a small label and might seem to go unnoticed as such but all the same it's a very welcome comeback. As we've seen since the turn of the millenium with the new releases by The Rolling Stones and such that,indeed rock n roll would seem to be something middle age people might want to steer clear from. That's actually rather good news in a way for this band considering the fact that in their four decades of existence they've always had as much to do with clean,polished vocal harmonies and melody as they have with the Southern rock and other styles they've integrated into their framework. Lucky for us this is not an album that represents so much a \\"return\\" to anything they did in the past as it is a new imagining of different styles based in what they do best all given the treatment of modern day recording techniques. The album begins and concludes with two excellent slices of Southern fried funk of \\"A Brighter Day\\" and \\"Law Dogs\\" that,while lyrically very much on opposit ends of the spectrum both showcase the Doobie's well renowned understanding of how to work a great groove with a great melodic hook. In between there are many grinding Southern rock n roll style gems such as \\"Chateau\\",the vibrant and reflective title song as well as \\"Young Man's Game\\",very much as comment on what they face in middle age as they self depricatingly explore the possibility that a lot of people coming up today will see them only as a dinasaur band continuing to endure with their sturdy fan base instead of settling into a semi permenent hiatus/retirement. There are also some songs that deliver some more unique ideas to the table. The lightly latin fusion styled \\"Don't Say Goodbye\\" features Michael McDonald on his first appearance on a Doobie album in thirty years and,as someone else I noticed put it actually emmerges as one of the strongest songs on...a very strong album even for those who felt McDonald smothered the band in the late 70's and too heavily altered their classic sound. \\"Old Juarez\\" is a firey latin rocker that has a strong Santana influence and is another easy highlite. Same goes for the modern \\"alternative country\\" styled duet with Willie Nelson in \\"I Know We One\\". These songs are anchored by slower fare such as \\"Nobody\\",\\"Far From Home\\" and \\"My Baby\\". While none of these songs are exactly \\"Black Water\\" or anything like that they have a downhome yet polished flavor that helps them stand out. As far as long awaited comebacks go this is probably among the more potent of the lot next to maybe what Steely Dan did,even if it is somewhat tamer in parts to what the Doobie's did in their heyday. But as we learned in the 90's with Bonnie Raitt's highly successful comeback sometimes time and age have their own kind of rewards.erges as one of the strongest songs on...a very strong album even for those who felt McDonald smothered the band in the late 70's and too heavily altered their classic sound. \\"Old Juarez\\" is a firey latin rocker that has a strong Santana influence and is another easy highlite.

0312600844|5.0|This wonderful book is fun to read. It tells a great story, and is filled with well developed, interesting characters whose problems are relevant to the lives of ordinary Americans.<br /><br />The main character comes from a wealthy, very intellectual family. She rejects this background and becomes a basketball player and a very traditional middle class mom. She is one of a series of \\"rebels\\" in this book who predicate their lives on their desire to break away from their parents. The son of a redneck alcoholic becomes an environmentalist who has his first beer when he is in his forties. His son in turn becomes an unabashed capitalist and a Republican.<br /><br />In short, the book is motivated by its main characters. These people are often troubled, brash, outspoken, and representative of major trends in American culture. As such, the book falls somewhere in between our highly intellectual and abstract authors such as DeLillo and Pynchon, and our popular novelists like Stephen King or Nora Roberts. Perhaps John Irving might be considered a peer. Both authors write relatively traditional stories motivated by character and full of striking plot developments.<br /><br />Freedom is a serious book which deserves to be called literature. Is it a great book? Maybe. If it does someday become a classic, it will be because people feel it captures the spirit of an age, and gives voice to ordinary middle class Americans, showing how we live, what we care about, and the kinds of troubles that plague our days. But worrying about that kind of thing is really a waste of time for most prospective readers. All one really needs to know is that this is very entertaining book, full of well-developed characters who will probably seem at least partially familiar to anyone likely to take an interest in this novel.<br /><br />To cut to the chase: I bought the book, I started reading it. I couldn't put it down. During the day I kept thinking about the book and jealously guarded the time when I could get back to it. Now that it is finished, I'm somewhat at a loss as to what to do next. It's likely to be awhile before I find another book quite so engrossing.hat it is finished, I'm somewhat at a loss as to what to do next.

0784010188|5.0|\\"Hasta la vista, baby\\".<br /><br />A worthy candidate for greatest sequel of all time (along with The Godfather Part II, The Empire Strikes Back, Aliens and Toy Story 2), James Cameron's Terminator 2: Judgment Day delivers everything that a movie should deliver. It's got dazzling action sequences, spectacular visual effects, an intelligent human story, great characters and a nice blend of action, comedy and pathos, all wrapped in this one $100-million juggernaut. A welcome relief from the bloated misfires of Michael Bay, Rob Cohen and Paul W.S. Anderson, T2 is a movie that uses it budget for ideas and emotions instead of hollow gimmicks and indulgences, a movie that dares to thrill you emotionally and provoke you intellectually.<br /><br />T2 is set nearly a decade after the original Terminator. In the first Terminator, cyborgs from the future sent a machine (Arnold Schwarzenegger) back to time to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton), the mother of human resistance leader John Connor. The plan failed when the human resistance sent Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) to protect Sarah and together, they managed to destroy the machine. Flash forward a decade later: Sarah is committed in a hospital when she is falsely assumed to be insane; her son John (Edward Furlong) is raised by foster parents; and Guns N' Roses and Public Enemy are all the musical rage at the time. Once again, the machines send a Terminator (Robert Patrick) back to time, this time to kill John Connor while the humans send back a guardian to protect him. The twist, of course, is that the guardian is basically a replica of the first Terminator, except it is programmed to protect.<br /><br />There are visual effects that are used to show off and then you have<br />visual effects that are used to tell a story. T2 rests in the latter category as the centerpiece of the special effects is the T-1000, a cyborg made of liquid-metal that can dissolve into various environments and possess the ability to turn into copies of the human it interacts. The T-1000 is a wonderful creation as we see him emerge from floors, transform into human figures, dissolve down from ceilings and create knife-like weapons from his hands and fingertips to kill. The genius of this special effect is that it is used for storyline purposes as opposed to visual pyrotechnics. In a brilliant sequence, the T-1000 jumps off a motorcycle from the top of the building onto a helicopter. After he headbutts the glass, the villain slithers into the cockpit like a silver snake before turning into his human form. The T-1000 then decides to use the helicopter to track down our heroes and kill them off. It is a brilliantly edited sequence that not only presents the awe of special effects as we see it but also helps advance the story a bit.<br /><br />But to heavily praise the special effects is to overlook the human element, which separates James Cameron from his contemporaries that rely on showing off with computers. The relationship between T-800 and John Connor is simultaneously funny and moving; one funny bit involves John teaching the robot how to smile while in an amusing scene, John teaches T-800 how to not speak \\"like a dork\\" and say phrases like \\"no problemo\\", \\"chill out dickwad\\" and the now famous \\"Hasta la vista, baby\\". The genius of Schwarzenegger is that he can accept roles that are proper for him and make them transcendent and memorable. Unlike the stoic Sylvester Stallone, Schwarzenegger is an actor that is eager to open himself in ridicule, as shown in scenes mentioned above, thus creating a more believable character for anyone to like. He becomes a father figure to John and his impending demise at the end strikes an emotional chord given the relationship between the two.<br /><br />Besides Furlong and Schwarzenegger, there are equally good performances from other actors, including Linda Hamilton as John's nihilistic mother with a grim outlook on humanity and Joe Morton as the troubled Myles Dyson, who is working on a new microprocessor that will unwittingly set the events for Judgment Day, the destruction of humanity. Cameron's skills with actors are often taken for granted and once again, he shows his skills at getting solid performances from a cast like he did in Aliens (1986).<br /><br />As usual in a James Cameron movie, there are loads of exhilarating action scenes that will get audiences pumping. The opening car chase as the T-1000 chases after John Connor in a truck is a mind-blowing experience that is also visually playful: The T-1000's menacingly imposing truck chasing down John and his comparably tiny motorcycle is an amusing metaphor of how powerful this machine is compared to the puny, vastly vulnerable Connor. The third car chase, this time with the T-1000 flying a helicopter after the heroes in a S.W.A.T. van, is also an eye-opener as we see an amazing camera shot of an actual helicopter flying over and under the overpasses with ease. Sequences like this would have been via computer; here, it was all done in real life. And the final showdown between Arnold and the T-1000 is exciting as they fight in a steel mill, a symbol of two machines fighting it out in a domain or a setting that created them in the first place.<br /><br />T2 is the apotheosis of what you call a \\"labor of love\\". Here is an action epic that is intelligently crafted, tremendously exciting and very witty. James Cameron often takes flake for his treatment of cast and crew members in pursuing a vision but watching T2 and all his other movies that have box-office successes, it is clear that not only do the ends justify the groans but such principles should actually be considered a good thing for a director.ittingly set the events for Judgment Day, the destruction of humanity.

She received this for her birthday, and has been writing in it ever since!  It's filled with plenty of parts that kids can fill in themselves, in addition to the usual comics-type pictures and such.  Overall, very pleased with this book, and my daughter is as well!  Would make a great gift for any Diary of a Wimpy Kid fan. :)
1400079179|2.0|You don't need another review, do you? You just want to find out how I could give this fabulous book 2 stars. It has nothing to do with religion. I don't care about that. This book is stodgy and formulaic: every big, crashing, \\"surprise\\" is as predictable as the sunrise. I really did not look at the 5-star reviews: I wish I could get past lack of writing talent and let my imagination flower as do those of the people who loved this book. More power to 'em.
0525951652|1.0|I bought my Kindle when it was still ridiculously expensive.  Two months later the price dropped, and then it dropped again some time later.  I couldn't help feeling as though I'd been had.  I had some internal conflict about buying it to begin with, since I love bookstores, turning pages, the smell of the ink...I was concerned that the printed word would be dying. BUT it appears that I will no longer have to worry about that, because now I will be purchasing the hardcover edition of Fall of Giants, as well as any other book that costs over $12 for the Kindle version.  Great job, Amazon.  I'll now reluctantly be spending $20 at Barnes and Noble, rather than gladly paying you $10. And I'm going to loan the book to everyone I know.  If this is the start of a trend, I'll stop using my Kindle altogether.

0470477237|2.0|This book was more of a history lesson... there were a number of technical errors and the book was written with more opinion then fact. Got a few tid bits of worth while information but, overall this book was pretty worthless. The book is also already out of date in terms of content.
0399536108|4.0|I have read enough postings on Chris Guillebeau's webpage to know that when my free copy of his book The Art of Non-Conformity arrived, I'd want to isolate myself somewhere where I could curl up and read it cover to cover, uninterrupted. Unfortunately my J-O-B, and family obligations were not going to allow that to happen.  I decided to wait until the next day to start the book, when I could choose to take transit to work, and allow myself a large chunk of time to read.  A week later, I have finished.    When I first started reading Chris' website I was skeptical.  Free e-books always seem to come with catches that I had no interested in signing myself up for.  And \\"World Domination\\" sounded a little gimmicky.    So, I started with reading articles on his webpage, finally intrigued enough (and my skepticism satisfied enough) to download his guide.      While I was going through this and becoming more and more excited about what Chris had to say, he offered an opportunity for 100 readers to receive an advance copy of his book, and I was thrilled to learn I'd been one of the many many entries chosen. With no obligation to promote Chris' book, I had a chance to better get to know his ideas, and am considering whether I should sign on for his Build An Empire - unconventional guide.  I'm still undecided, mainly because I need to prioritize my time first.    I feel like I've found a kindred spirit in Chris.  His book repeated much of what I've read on his website, but elaborated on many ideas. It left me feeling inspired to make up my mind and take action.  I feel as though I've been fence sitting for many years, constantly exploring options, but making few leaps (but for a few conventional ones).    I have food for thought, and a place to begin the next stage of my explorations, putting something ANYTHING that I feel passionate about into action.

B000957O82|5.0|Awesome romantic comedy. Will Smith is the best, and this movie has all the right stuff - comedy, romance, drama, a mix of happy and sad moments. I thinks it's a great date, or family movie. Not just a \\"chick flick\\". There are no explosions, or car crashes, but most guys I know really enjoyed this movie. Good movie for anyone, and something we can all pretty much relate to.

B0035G9ABQ|5.0|I had long since given up on Gorillaz until I heard Plastic Beach playing in a local Seattle Coffee shop.  I was waiting in line when \\"Welcome to the World of the Plastic Beach\\" started playing in a weird jolt of synthetic curiosity.  What was this, I wondered - spoken word?  A DJ with a poet at his side (it helps that the lyrics generously nudge \\"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised\\")?  Wait, was that - Snoop Dogg??  Before I knew it too, I was so drawn in by the beats, I had to know more anyway.  What comes afterwards, \\"White Flag,\\" a rap-meets-middle-east-rave mashup, is joyously off-kilter. It wasn't until the single \\"Rhinestone Eyes\\" that it even occurred to me that I could be hearing a Gorillaz record.  I was hooked.  I immediately got a copy and found almost endless things to love - \\"Stylo,\\" a deep-techno explosion, \\"Empire Ants\\" with its stoned-chill groove, \\"Sweepstakes,\\" which explodes from beatless meandering into an invigorating anthem, and \\"Superfast Jellyfish,\\" about as infectiously stupid and wonderful as any indie-rap song ever has been.  I listened to the record full of moments where I thought, \\"Jesus, is that Lou Reed?\\"  Or, \\"Wow, did they get Mos Def on this track?\\"  All I can say is that a record providing this much discovery in its hearing is a gift.  Reviews seized on the deflation of several of the songs towards the album's end.  Yet actually, I find \\"Cloud of Unknowing\\" a sort of edifying, sweet bow to a record that releases you from a peak of joyous highs.  Even if I don't come back to the tracks on the second half of the record, they undeniably complete the astonishing creation that comes before it.  Plastic Beach is a joy to dance to and think about, and remains an ongoing thrill every time I put it on.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|Hardback edition is cheaper -- and they have to print it on paper.  The publishers should be ashamed.
B002ZG994U|2.0|I am  not sure that \\"campiness\\" is a word but it fits. The TV show was done with tongue in cheek and a broad sense of humor.  I loved watching the crazy things they welded together to defeat the bad guys.   They were Team MacGyver.  There were fist fights and gun play but no one ever got hurt.  I never saw a TV bad guy killed.  It was just a big cartoon for adults.  But then Hollywood got involved and things went to hell.    I was really looking forward to seeing the movie.  I couldn't wait to see my old friends on the big screen.  The trailers began to show up and I watch everyone several times.  Something about them didn't seem right, but I was still going to see the movie.   Well it came out and I was first in line and I saw it on the big screen and in stadium seats with the speakers blaring.  I sat there thorough out the movie with my mouth open and ear drums shaking.    There were bombs, planes, helicopters, flying tanks,  Kissing!,  blood,  bodies??  And I was sad.  The old time A-Team was not there.  I agree that these actors were better, but they weren't right for this movie.  The child like fun was gone.  The laid backed sly jokes were gone.  Mr. T was a larger than life stero typed character but he had personality, the B.A on the screen was flat and ...... well I didn't care about him as person.  Face in the movie and Mad Dog came close to the charm of the old group but they too lack that personal warmth that made you like them as people.  Hannibal is the one character  that has to set the tone of the show or movie.  Peppard's smile was what set the tone in the TV A-Team and Neeson never got it right.    The whole movie seemed over blown, over the top, trying too hard to go somewhere.  For the first time I felt I was beaten over the head by a movie.  I felt that the movie ws hitting me in the facd and saying,\\"Like me! Like me!\\"      I think Hollywood did it to themselves with this movie because a few weeks before the LOSERS came out and it was the same basic idea with one tenth of the budget.  And do you know what[see my review of the LOSERS] it is a better movie by a landslide.    The LOSERS didn't make money and the A-TEAM made money, but in my mind and heart the A-TEAM is the real LOSER!

B0011Z78R6|3.0|The Eagles were never a country band but they had just enough of that flavor to make them distinctive. Lineup changes stripped the band of their unique sound and from this point on they became just another FM rock band. That's not to say that this album didn't turn out some good singles. \\"New Kid In Town\\" gets less airplay than some of the Eagles' tracks, making it the one tune from this collection that I still welcome.<br /><br />The title track is one of their most popular classics but Don Felder, who wrote the exquisite introduction which defines this song, was shown the door after this album. The Eagles have since turned that intro into a wine and cheese number as their audience has aged. Also departing sometime between '76 and '78 were original members Bernie Leadon and Randy Meisner. They were subsequently replaced by purveyor of soft rock Timothy B. Schmidt just in time for his \\"I Can't Tell You Why\\" to rub elbows on adult contemporary radio formats with \\"The Pina Colada Song\\".<br /><br />Everything you need from this album - and this second phase of their career (1977-80) - is on [[ASIN:B0011Z8SJS Greatest Hits Volume 2]]. The rest of this album's tracks range from filler to pleasant to overlong; I couldn't imagine enduring them on an mp3 player even out of curiosity. \\"Hotel California\\" just doesn't hold a candle to their albums [[ASIN:B0011Z7JO8 Desperado]] or [[ASIN:B001200H2I On The Border]]. Nice cover though.
0312600844|1.0|Throughout the days that followed this lengthy read, I felt battered...whipped, if you will, by the coarsely contrived tale that conveyed little more, in my opinion, than the author's righteously-indignant, malignantly intolerant contempt for the rights of those who might dare to embrace a dissimilar viewpoint.  Instead of debating the soundness of the writer's perspective, I would more succinctly state that I grew disturbingly fatigued by the fictionalized, thinly-veiled, ideological sermon proffered by its, seemingly, all-knowing, duty bound creator, and would have much preferred that he bestow his rightfully owned opinions by way of a more fitting--nonfictional--format.    From a technical perspective, I can say, only, that the tale--a peculiarly voyeuristic and amateurish pilgrimage to an unlikely shrine erected to the common, the co-dependent, the lackluster...mired in the consistently shrill, eccentric, entitled, worn-out, narcissistic diatribe that we're all exposed to every day of the week--was comprised of five hundred and seventy-six interminable pages of oddly disconnected back story that the author seemed to have difficulty concluding.     THE LONE BINDING AGENT?    The sort of sex scenes that leave you feeling thankful to be a grown up.      THE SHOCKER?    The attention and notoriety that the story was granted.
B0040JHNZ2|5.0|Of all the books I have read this year, this is the one I have been awaiting with the greatest anticipation, particularly since I enjoyed the author's previous novels, in particular \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and \\"World Without End\\", both of which I have read many times, and count amongst my favourite novels.  On Tuesday, 28th September, I was checking the internet hourly to see if it had finally downloaded, and when it finally started to download, it took far too long, with too many stops.    I have read it in 2 days and I wasn't disappointed.  I found almost all of the characters interesting and mostly sympathetic, and I can't wait to see how the story continues.    I notice that the 1 star reviews seem mostly (from the ones I've read) complaining about the American price for the Kindle edition being higher than the hardcover price.  I agree that it's an anomaly.  In Australia, the Kindle price (for some reason I can't quite fathom) was $11.99, a price I was more than happy to pay.  If it had been $20 or $30, I still would have been happy to have paid it.  Actually, I also have the German translation on order from Amazon.de (German publishers are reluctant to publish eBooks) and I'll probably buy a further copy in case Ken Follett when he visits Australia towards the end of the year comes to a city close to where I live (it's so difficult to get an author to sign a Kindle ...)    I think Amazon should remove the misleading 1 star reviews.  Actually, the way I approach writing a review is to immediately write the cost of the book down to zero, and then I ask; was the book worth reading?  I regard the true cost of a book is the time required to read it, not the price in dollar terms, which is ephemeral.
0316098337|5.0|I began reading \\"Room\\" at eight thirty in the evening and blinked for the first time, I think, at four  a.m. when I completed the final page.  \\"Room\\" was not only a well told tale,  but a brilliant reading experience that reminds us that life is always about perspective.  Well done!
0312600844|5.0|Here's the deal. . .  Anyone who has read \\"The Corrections\\" understands that Franzen excels at portraying people's inner lives.  And this is the beauty and the strength of \\"Freedom.\\"  This is not the book of the century nor the most significant piece of American fiction ever.  But it is very, very good.  Franzen is a patient story teller who allows his characters to develop in a believable manner over decades.  And as his characters grow, Franzen allows us access to their complexities.  He just understands and writes about people so extraordinarily well.  How good and well-intentioned people wind up in difficult marriages, how people engage in self-destructive activities, how parents influence and are influences by their children, how we come to hate then forgive people close to us, how our politics shift as we age. . .Brilliant nuances.  So please spend time with this book and appreciate it for what it is.

B0036EH3XE|5.0|I intentionally did not watch any of Season 6 when it was on TV so that I could watch the entire 6th season at once.  First time I have ever purchased a set of TV show DVDs and I was not disappointed!
B002UZXJA6|5.0|Superb presentation and song mix from this increasingly popular group. Arguably the best yet.  Would reccommend anyone to add this to thier collection
B001GKYBXA|4.0|I recently saw Paul McCartney live 3 times in a row.  A few of the songs he did came from the Fireman CD called Electric Arguments.  There are 3 really great songs on the cd.  It has a lot of unnecessary electronic noises going on, but it is one of the best Paul McCartney cds that he has released since Wings.  And, it is even better when done live, just like the Wings songs are.  I would recommend buying this cd.  It really rocks on some songs and is very mellow on others.  It would cover all moods for listening.  The band on the cd is the same band he tours with.  The concerts were great.  The cd reminds me of the concert.
0061537969|5.0|There are so many reviews already, mostly positive, that I have little to add except that I LOVED the book.  The story is a bit schmaltzy but the narration by the dog and his observations about dogs and people, and his humor, were great.  The author did a wonderful job also of tying the running theme of racing in the rain into the story, which added a bit of depth to the story.  Great book.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|Some DVDs will not play episodes.  I checked the DVD for scratches and/or damage, there was none.  If I use the \\"play all\\" option it skips over episodes.  If I pick the individual option it boots me back to the main menu.  I only made it to the second disk in the series, but will check the rest.  I noticed this was an issue for other people, but I thought they resolved the problem.  Guess I was wrong!    Update:  I only made it through the first season.  Disk #2 won't play the forth episode.  Disk #3 skips during episodes.  Disk #4 skips and will not play the last two episodes.  The final DVD in the first season will not play at all.  I gave up after so many issues with just the first season and send the box set back to Amazon.  I'm going to wait until they re-release to purchase again.
B003YLK2RI|5.0|Yeah it's not on Blu-ray, which I have to say I would have preferred. But let's face it: This is one amazing concert. That's what it's all about. The Nine and 80,000 people in one of the greatest concerts ever. The DVD's audio far exceeded my expectations and the show is phenomenal. This is by far the best live release from Slipknot. Well worth the money. If you are a fan, GET THIS NOW.
B001GCUO4S|3.0|I've seen all 4 final destinations now, and this one was the worst. I liked the 3 before but, I dunno about this one. The acting wasn't all that great or convincing and, after awhile, the same storyline just gets old. How many times can a group of people cheat death just to have it come back and hunt them down? Back to the acting.. The main characters in this one, as I stated, weren't very convincing at all. Normally, in real life, when you lose a friend or see a gruesome death happen up close you're traumatized, shocked. (Yes, I know this is a movie but it's supposed to be convincing right?) Not these people. They didn't even act like the deaths bothered them. They acted like they were going out for ice cream instead, you'd get about the same reaction that you got from these actors. It was just the same ole same ole and the storyline just felt routine. Nothing shocking happened, nothing. No surprises but, then again, how can there be a surprise when you've seen the same movie with the same plot 3 times before? I was excited to see it because the first 3 rocked but this one was a disappointment. Felt like it was thrown together too fast and the 3D didn't help. I'm not a fan of 3D and it just seemed dumb to have this one in that form. If you are looking to buy this movie to add to the rest of your Final Destination collection then, by all means, go ahead. Buuuttt, if you're looking for a good movie that's entertaining then you might wanna pass this one up. It's just not as good as the first 3. The blood and gore couldn't even save this one and I do think it's about time to wrap up the Final destination series. P.S I heard they were coming out with a 5th one next year. Will it ever end? :)
0312600844|5.0|And it left me emotionally drained.    I have never been touched by any form of media the way this book touched me. I think everyone can see a part of themselves in at least one of the characters in the book; it's so relatable it's almost haunting. This book made me cry, many times, for many different reasons. And I dont' cry. I'm Kenny F'n Powers.
B0025KVLV0|4.0|This is the final Beatles album to be released (although it was mostly recorded before Abbey Road), and also the least of the ones I've heard. That doesn't make it bad, in fact I like most of it. It just has less going for it, fewer all time great songs and just not as much of the pure inspiration they showed in the few years previous. The thing is, it's at least somewhat intentional, because it was recorded to sound more or less like a live performance, although they lost some of that when they brought on Phil Spector to produce new versions of the tracks. It's still there though, the songs are less meticulously crafted, relying more on pure folksy charm, which they just don't do quite as well. They still play a pretty good tune, especially accompanied by Billy Preston on keyboards to fill out what otherwise could have been a fairly sparse sound.    Now here's the part where I talk about some individual songs. \\"Across the Universe\\" might actually be the only one I'd heard before getting the album, and I don't think it was part of the same recording sessions. There's something haunting and alien about it, a nice break from the rest of the album. There's a pretty good chance I had heard the title track too, and it's a nice one, the kind of Paul McCartney song that doesn't light your hair on fire but you never mind hearing. There are quite a few songs that feature both Paul and John sharing the lead, which is a nice way to send the band off, my favorite being the opener \\"Two of Us\\". George's contributions are relatively slight this time, though there is something likable about the simplicity of \\"I Me Mine\\". It's too bad there wasn't a place for Ringo to sing, he being the only one to sound significantly different from the others usually. There's not really a lot to say, many of the songs featured are listenable and fun but not particularly memorable. That's a good way to sum up the album, I guess. Not the best possible way for the band to end, but not the worst either.
0439023483|5.0|You know when you get ready to ride a roller coaster and you can see where all the twists, turns, and loops are before you hop on, but you still have a blast when you experience them?  That's kind of how I felt reading this first installment to the trilogy.  I could see many of the twists and turns coming, but that definitely didn't take away from the great ride.  Collins does a great job of moving the story along while getting you to care about her characters.  If you're looking for an addicting read, I'd recommend picking this up.
B000005RMY|5.0|This album got me through the toughest time of my life - when I was about 16, thank you - I love you guys forever and always!  Music Saves!
0553378384|5.0|I first came across this book when a new friend started to read it to me while I was driving. She was not very familiar with astrology, so since I had told her I was a Gemini, she began reading the Gemini chapter. Then I later looked at the book and realized it was not about Sun signs at all, but instead it's about the North Node. This realization made me very happy. I have already absorbed much of the generalized, rehashed information about the Sun signs. I hunger for deeper knowledge that the Moon's Nodes contain. Knowledge about why I am here on crazy planet Earth, in situations I often strongly dislike, and what my life purpose really is on a soul level.    Jan is very thorough in each of her chapters, and that is something I need, especially about something as profound as the Nodes. When I read the chapter on my Taurus North Node, especially seeing the brief bulleted sections \\"Attributes to Develop\\", \\"Attributes to Let Go Of\\" (or some similar titles, don't have the book here), I could strongly relate to all of it. It felt like, \\"Finally! Someone understands exactly what I've been going through, and *wow*, there IS a way out of this mess...there is a better life out there and I can start living it now.\\" Luckily the chapter doesn't end after a frew brief paragraphs but goes on in detail about many areas of life and how my Taurus North Node can and should be harnessed for maximum happiness and success in my life.    I also read the Pisces chapter (because my Node is in my 12th) and that hits home strongly as well. I read the positions for people I know...my sister, Mom, Dad, coworker, friend, etc., and it's amazing how, when viewed through the lense of the Nodes, a person's life lessons become very clear. My Dad has always been about work, work, work, don't play, don't relax, work. When I was a child, this caused a lot of tension at home. Look up his birthday and find out--surprise!--he has a Cancer North Node, with hard-working Capricorn as his over-developed South Node to start leaving behind. This is just one example, but Jan's insight into each of the 12 positions of the Node is very eye-opening and helpful/healing for me.
0385342047|3.0|*Mini Spoiler Alert*    I love the Shopaholic series, but I have to say that I was quite disappointed with this book. In all these years, Becky doesn't seem to have grown up or learned her lesson when it comes lying. It also annoyed me that she keeps lying to her husband, friends, and family. I expected more plot development in regards to her being a mother but most of the book focused on the big party that she was planning for Luke. On the bright side, there were some funny, touching moments but for the most part I was kind of bored.
1439102813|5.0|Great book.  We all forget things, but not in the way alzheimer's victims do.  Very interesting to follow her progression in the disease.  Made me realize I'm not there yet!
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Of Course, Amazon didn't have it for $21.99 when Best Buy was beating their price by $3 on Tuesday, but now Amazon drops it to $19.99. No way are pre-orders ever worth it. Last time I ever buy any DVD on drop date or earlier. I'm waiting another 3 months when they bottom out at half off, like last summer's flip-flops at Target. Hear that moviemakers?

0007202288|5.0|The book starts off with the bombing of the city of London and the Pevenise children flee to the countryside from the city with their uncle, The Professor.  Lucy, the youngest of the four, stumbles across the wardrobe during a game of hide and seek.  She goes on an adventure and comes out at the same exact time as when she went in.  The Professor tells Peter and Susan that they should believe her about her adventure.  All four go into the wardrobe to hide from Ms. Macready, the nasty housekeeper and Susan stumbles into the snow and they all go and meet Aslan, the lion, which together, they defeat the White Witch for good which takes them about 2 years Narnia time.  They then go on a hunt after a little, magic dwarf, which they find but never catch, and they stumble across the lamppost and go back through the wardrobe the same exact time and date as when they went into Narnia.  They explained to the Professor everything that happened and decide to find another way into Narnia.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|I can't say enuff about this Blue Ray of Celine show in Vegas A+ Excellent!
B00402FGEE|5.0|This show is fantastic.  I was sorry to Stargate Atlantis end, but SGU comes close to making up for it.  It has a different tone than the previous Stargate shows.  It is darker and more suspenseful.  The dynamic between Col. Young and Dr. Rush is like nothing elese on TV.  This is the best show on TV right now.  The only thing that comes close is Fringe.  Also, contrary to what another reviewer wrote, Season 2 just started.  It airs on Syfy on Tuesday nights.
0811876373|5.0|Just got the book and tried making a cake pop. Turned out pretty good, just need to get the technique down. If you like something really really sweet (as in sugar), cute and different, this is a great book!
B003O86MY8|5.0|If you enjoy rock and roll and classical music, you will enjoy this CD.  It really makes classical music enjoyable and younger.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys both types of music.  It's a great blend, and the guy's a fox!
1591843162|4.0|I've been a fan of Seth for a while through his blog and then reading Tribes, which makes me a new comer to the \\"tribe\\" of Seth.  This book exemplifies a lot of the reason that I'm a fan of what Seth has to say.  His iconoclastic way of looking at the world makes you stop and consider if what you've always believed is really the way that it is.<br /><br />In \\"Linchpin\\" Seth takes on the topic of economy and asks if we're still living in an industrial age.  Seth's approach is that we are in a new age - which still has yet to be defined, a sort of postmodernism of economic systems.  Just as postmodernism sought to define itself away from modernism, Seth defines the worker today away from the industry or factory of the industrial age.<br /><br />The writing has the hallmark of Seth's other books - chapters are subdivided into things that are probably best termed \\"blog posts\\", which makes for an easy and fast-paced read.  I enjoyed this book a lot, and it got me out of a few slumps I've been feeling with its ability to make myself ask new questions.  I recommend you pick it up.
0553805371|5.0|Because Stephen Hawkings clears up the \\"god\\" language that he has used in \\"Brief History of Time\\" and \\"The Universe in a Nutshell\\", and his other books. He makes it very clear that science doesn't require a prime mover. His language is more clear in this book then his previous books. There is no ambiguity. In his others books, he gave the impression that he was a Deist of some sort to the uninformed Christian. Most educated in science knew that his God was the God of Einstein not the God of Christianity.<br /><br />This book describes in greater detail physics on the macro level and on the quantum level showing how these conflicting laws could have produced the universe. Not only that, but the idea that our Universe is the only one seems to be negated by string theory. Our universe may be just one of many in a infinite number. The universes that produce life may be \\"fewer\\", but really there is no sure way of knowing. The singularity of our universe doesn't seem like it was something extraordinary in the sense of what we previously thought since there may exist multiverses.<br /><br />Certainly this book clears up Hawkings use of \\"God\\" in his previous books and now he is more clear and more succinct. This is why he is getting low ratings. They are mostly from agitated Christians or other believers who loved his flowery way and loose talk of God in his previous books which now is cleared up so there is no confusion. The final result is that there is no more need for a prime mover in science.<br /><br />Also it seems many are misrepresenting Stephen Hawking with regard to his \\"Philosophy is dead\\" remark. He said that in a particular context that cannot be dismissed. He did not say that Philosophy as a discipline is useless or dead. He did not say the scientific method does not include philosophy. He said that philosophy in answering the big questions such as 'Why is there something rather then nothing' is basically impotent and science can now offer more evidence basedanswers. Surely answers with evidence is better than merely syllogism and logic with no facts.
1592332803|4.0|I love this book, I got it after I received the other cookbook by the same author. So far I've only had an issue with one of the recipes (the whole wheat bread however that could be a result of my sub par bread pan) but everything else has been fantastic. I never thought I would make such AMAZING vegan cinnamon rolls, lemon bars, pralines and the list could go on. This book is a MUST for any vegan with a sweet tooth! I suggest this to anyone who likes baking!
B0034G4OVS|4.0|Remember a few years ago a flick called \\"Open Water\\" came out about a married couple left behind during a scuba trip, they find themselves left adrift, miles from land and surrounded by hungry sharks?<br /><br />Well \\"Frozen\\" is kind of like the winter version of that tale.<br /><br />The basic man vs. nature story is that 3 college friends get stuck on a ski lift after a series of mis-communications by resort staff. To make matters worse, the resort is set to close down for the week, and on top of that \\"some weather\\" is moving in.<br /><br />For a film like this to work the viewer has to like the characters and the actors have to really do a good job, because let's face it, we are basically watching 3 people sit on a ski-lift for 90 minutes.<br /><br />The good news is that \\"Frozen\\" actually pulls this off. Genre favorite Kevin Zegers (Wrong Turn, Dawn of the Dead & The Hollow) and Shawn Ashmore (The Ruins) do a really good job, but it's Emma Bell who steals the show playing Zegers' girlfriend. All three actors do a great job of pulling the viewer into their plight and because you care for the characters, as the situation grows worse, the scenes get more and more tense as the film plays out.<br /><br />I'm not sure if \\"Frozen\\" is a movie you would re-visit often as once it's seen and the fate of the main characters is known, I'm not sure what the draw would be to go back for a second viewing. Still this is a definate horror must see - a new film that isn't a remake or reimagining or a sequel...that alone makes it worth supporting if you are a horror fan.
B000MNP2K8|3.0|Not much to say, I've always had good luck with Amazon purchses, but this was in a way an exception.  When I played the DVD it skipped in four places.  I would like one that doesn't skip but am unwilling to go through the red tape and expense of postage to facilitate it.    ~Bill M.
B000SEVVLK|1.0|Wow this book is awful.  I suspect it was actually written by a boy crazed teenager.
B0034JKZ86|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />\\"The Princess and the Frog\\" has almost as much fun lampooning the conventions of the someday-my-prince-will-come genre as it does endorsing them.  It inverts the formula right off the bat by having its heroine turn INTO a frog when she kisses one rather than the other way around.  Tiana (Anika Nani Rose) also defies convention by being an African American heroine whose main ambition in life is to open up her own restaurant in the bustling metropolis of 1920s New Orleans.  The last thing she's waiting around for is some old Prince Charming to come riding to the rescue, bringing meaning and purpose to her life.<br /><br />One would think that, with all this iconoclasm floating off the screen, \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" would be a more interesting and intriguing movie than it ultimately turns out to be.  Yet, as though through some kind of reverse magical spell of its own, the more \\"different\\" the movie becomes, the more familiar it feels.  Perhaps, the reason lies in the simple, old-school style of animation (cell as opposed to computer-generated) that the filmmakers have chosen to employ in this instance - or perhaps in the fact that this inverted fairy tale shtick has already been done so many times before, especially in the more imaginative and biting \\"Shrek\\" films, that it's bound to seem less than fresh here.<br /><br />Whatever the cause, \\"The Princess and the Frog\\" never quite lives up to its potential, ultimately becoming weighted down by a rambling storyline, a surfeit of less-than-fascinating subsidiary characters, an undistinguished Randy Newman score, and a stock villain - a shadowy practitioner of the Black Arts - who fails to generate any real quality of menace or threat (certainly not in a manner comparable to the great Disney bad guys of yore).
0201721481|3.0|This book looks good. But some examples can't run under visual studio. Like chapter 10 word_transform.cpp, I tried it, can't run. Looks like they want to waste my time. So I returned this book right away.
B0014DBZY2|5.0|This album is amazing from beginning to end. If you aren't that much into the 80s revived dance music I still recommend this band. This band can deliver great music. Some songs are more electronic than others, but that wasn't an issue for me. I do have a friend that jokes that he feels he is in a gay club when Cassius is playing, but that is the song that I first heard. From that one song I could tell this is a band that knows music and is dedicated to doing it right all the time.    I do feel that if you don't like the above mentioned type of music you should still give this album a chance, if only because of dreamy, catchy songs like Olympic Airways or Red Socks Pugie (which is absolutely amazing in all versions I have heard).    Their lyrics let me know that the whoever is doing the writing of lyrics is a poet and great with words (Who uses warrens in their daily speech?). I do appreciate the fact that the guys can sing to. The lead singer, Yannis, has a great voice and range. It is perfect to give the 80s dance music vibe or when he sings falsetto.     So a perfect debut by five guys who make great music set to beautiful lyrics. I can not wait to see what Foals will become as they make more music.     But my favorite Foals song is not on this album, but a B-side on the Olympic Airways single, called Gold Gold Gold. You will find other treats on their as well. Get that one too!

B003D7F33Q|5.0|This band is brilliant. You can tell by their music that they are quite conscientious of what they are doing every step of the way in the song making process. With that said this isn't Antidotes part II, this is better than that. This is less dance and more music. (Sorry I am not down with the names of different music types. ie post-punk, modern-what ever).     If you loved Antidotes because it is great music you should like this one as well. If you loved the dance music you may be disappointed, but I do recommend it to all of those who truly embrace great music done well. If you like Antidotes because of the 80s feel, you may like some songs on Total Life Forever, like Miami.     I honestly can not stop listening to this album, just as the case with Antidotes. The music is done perfectly and the lyrics are more open on this album. Some say on Antidotes they were hiding the meanings of their songs behind poetry. I say all poetry is up to interpretation so who cares about that. I do love this band and think we are only witnessing the beginning of what these guys will do. Finally for me a band worth being in the league of Radiohead. Of course time will only tell if they will give us music worthy of being in that league, but I dare say they are on their way.

B00402FGEE|5.0|The studio actually listened to the people and released full-seasoned episodes.    Is this a modern miracle? Probably just another marketing maneuver to get the rest of our money, but who cares.    Thanks for listening! You are forgiven (for now) and will be rewarded.    I will purchase the entire first season on October 5th.    BTW, have you looked at Caprica Season 1.0, which is actually half a season in disguise. Oh well, Halloween is coming!    Others continue this disreputable advertising deception, so be careful and take care.    And don't forget to boycott deceptive marketing practices, like Caprica, etc.    UPDATE--------------------------    True to my word, I purchased SGU Season 1.    I was skeptical after reading some of the 1-star reviews, but I was happily surprised.    I've only watched about 5 or 6 episodes and they were all great!    As good as SG1 and Atlantis, but different, which is good!    For those of you who gave SGU a bad review, shame on you.    You are all a bunch of whining weenies that don't know good sci-fi from your butt!    I hope SGU can become another \\"10-bagger?\\"

B003XMUFGQ|3.0|I saw Clapton live, for the second time, a couple of years back. He was really on fire, and his band was great. The show gave much promise for the next studio album. And here it is.    Generally, it's a much more pleasurable and interesting album than any of the studio LPs he's released this century. It's rough and ready in places, but still too smooth. Derek Trucks is underused.    Maybe it was too much to expect too much. Clapton's best studio albums (Out Of The Cradle, Money & Cigarettes) have never been met with the blockbuster sales of, say, August or Unplugged.     Long term fans (who loved Cream and Derek & The Dominoes, but have since eased into their lives) will probably really like this.     Those of us who want grit and determination will just have to dust off our copies of Bluesbreakers.
0767817729|4.0|to begin with the movie has some great characters in it,kinda like maltese falcon.The story had a minor flaw but just the same it was not  just another rewrite. i believe Costner  gets a bad rep. from critics and this movie shows just how wrong they are, this isnt what id call a date movie or a action movie but it was a good story, a throwback to movies 60 years ago robert mithum could have easily played this back then and everyone  would no the movie today.
0634060384|4.0|I bought all three volumes of this series. I like the hefty comb binding that lies flat on the music stand. The printing is large enough and simple enough to be read easily, even in slightly dimmed light. There is plenty of room to add one's own notes. There are some streamlined performance notes. I appreciate the index in the front. It has a variety of songs from the most revered jazz classics to some popular numbers. Still, the series does not have ALL the songs ever written during the jazz and swing era. That doesn't seem humanly possible, so I didn't expect it.<br /><br />BUT somehow I got it in my head that it had the words. Guess I was wrong. No words. This is not a huge deal because the words are pretty easy to get on the Internet whereas the tunes are not. Still, I wish the words were included. There is enough room on most of the pages, as they stand, that the words could have been included. As I collect the words I will hand print them under the staffs. Lack of words is the only reason I did not give all 5 stars.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|I'd like to echo many of the other reviews about the quality of the discs. Every disc had scratches or defects making some of the episodes completely unplayable and other episodes full of hangs/skips. This was in all of our DVD players even after cleaning the discs. This great series deserves a better quality product.
0307454541|5.0|There are plenty synopses out there so I won't bother.  None of them can do this series justice.  Suffice to say I can not remember enjoying a trilogy so much.  To me, one deliciously long book that I could not put down.  A completely fresh main character who is equal parts vulnerability, quirkiness, and superhero.  It is the only time I can recall \\"needing\\" to order the third book before I was finished with the second...
B0044CBMXE|3.0|I hope for better plot development, smoother dialogue, and deeper character insight.  The \\"reunion\\" and the mastadon in the lab give me hope that the wit and verve are back.  I'm pleased that Caroline has a larger role this season.  Every workplace needs a no-nonsense conscience to cut to the chase and keep things focused.  Wendell, representing the working class hero, brings \\"Bones\\" back to earth and in touch with the rest of us.  Baby Hodgins, a mere glimmer in the writer's eye \\"7 months ago\\" is this season's clock.    Let's hope the writers regain the confidence and balance they displayed during the first two seasons.  C'mon, people. Let's wrap this series up and send it into syndication with a flourish.  Okay? No more two-dimensional Bones.  Try to remember all the progress she made during earlier seasons and credit her with more emotional maturity and cultural literacy.  Otherwise, how are you gonna explain the eventual . . .  okay, I don't want to spoil the surprise.
B001DJ7PR8|4.0|Woody Allen takes us to a beautiful place and introduces us to beautiful people, all of whom are contending in one way or another with love, lust, longing or some combination of the three. Allen has some sharp things to say, I think, about our confounding refusal to be happy with what we have, about our futile and often-destructive tendency to be on constant lookout for something or (more to the point) someone who will bring us a lifetime of unbroken joy and fulfillment. It's fun to watch actors as skilled as Javier Bardem, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Penelope Cruz and Patricia Clarkson sparring, romancing and searching for happiness while trying to maintain a semblance of personal dignity. And I've added Barcelona to my list of cities to visit. But I eventually found myself wondering if, in the end, this movie didn't just amount to a ridiculous male fantasy: Bardem manages to effortlessly bed some of the world's most beautiful women, sometimes two at a time, while remaining a basically decent, grounded guy. The two main characters here are essentially living a fantasy themselves, despite the tumult in their personal lives. Fresh out of college, Vicky (Hall) and Cristina (Johansson) spend a summer in Spain, dining in fashionable restaurants, visiting museums and hanging out with artists. This lifestyle would cost a fortune. No doubt, some families can afford these indulgences. But are their troubles really worth the attention of such a talented writer and filmmaker? Wouldn't the vast majority of people on this planet gladly trade places with characters simply exempt from the some of the biggest challenges of ordinary life - financial pressure, bad bosses, compromised career dreams? But that, I finally decided, may be Allen's point precisely: These characters have everything - beauty, brains, money, youth, freedom, artistic passion. If even they struggle to find love and happiness, what chance do mere mortals have?
B000BF0D9M|5.0|Jesse Cook takes me to another time and place.  How do I paint in words the lush imagery, the sweet romance, and the driving energy of his music?  The only thing better than this CD would be hearing him live in concert--and I will one day.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Joe Bonamassa is a 70's style rock guitar god in the 21st century.  What more can I say.  Nice vid. great sound and camera work.  It also helps that a true 60's and 70's rock guitar god stops in to jam.

B0043RSIUK|4.0|I have been reading the reviews. I can't believe the 1 star reviews are because of the prize en kindle. And from people who has no idea about the book. This can't be permited. You don't like the prize. Don't buy. But the only reason we can read almost all kind of books on kindle is because there is a benefit for a lot different people. In a perfect world all this would be free, but we are not in that world yet. That is Ok with me and should be for everyone who love to read. The book is Ok, easy to read and very entreteined. I am only trough the middle, but without doubt I am going to complete this review when I finish.<br />Putting all this 1 star review is a pity punishment, and way bellow what this book deserve.<br /><br />OK, I finished the book and overall I liked it. I didn,t think it was slow, but I really like history, and if it is all wrapped up in an interesting setting and the story within the history is good, then I am happy. If you don't like a lot of dates and secondary caracters, this book is not for you.
B002ELM5HY|4.0|I bought Get Lucky recently and I love it, especially Border Reiver and secondly, Get lucky.  I´m not english myself but I love the way Mark sings but I´d like him to write more   songs similir to Speedway to Nazareth and sultans of swing ( where you enjoy hearing the guitar , that his music should not be so slow and that we could hear his guitar playing much more as in his songs of today.  Of course I like the lyrics of Get Lucky and I love Mark´s voice but I would love to hear his guitar much more.  Anyway, Mark is the best and you´ve got to buy this CD.  I hope to be able to go to a concert of his next year, it must be something you remember all your life
B00026WU7I|5.0|Over 10 years after the release of such acclaimed works such as 'Highway 61 Revisited\\" and \\"Blonde on Blonde,\\" Bob Dylan once again reclaimed his throne as the poet laureate of rock and roll with \\"Blood on the Tracks.\\" It was the crowning jewel of a major commercial and artistic comeback hinted by the hugely successful (though somewhat uneven)<br />\\"Planet Waves.\\"<br /><br />Inspired by his disintegrating marriage to Sara Lowndes, \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" is Dylan at his most honest and vulnerable. The gripping characters and vivid imagery that painted his most beloved works of the 1960s', but in a much more mature and accessible manner that makes \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" Dylan's most beloved and indispensable work to date.<br /><br />Very rarely has there been a record where ever song is as perfect as the last. There is not a single bad line or gratuitous instrumental break that detracts from the quality. Even the lengthy \\"Lily, Rosemary and the Jack of Hearts\\" is a precise, cohesive tale despite its obtuse lyrical premise. Even a standard blues number like \\"Meet Me in the Morning\\" becomes far more special with the amount of soul Bob puts into it. \\"You're a Big Girl Now\\" and \\"If You See Her. Say Hello\\" have the best vocals Bob has ever layed down on record. While never a traditionally great singer, Dylan was certainly at his peak here, and the phrasing and emotion he pours into these song shatter notions he can't sing properly.<br /><br />\\"Tangled Up in Blue,\\" Shelter from the Storm,\\" and \\"Simple Twist of Fate\\" remain the album's best known, \\"Tangled\\" in particular reaching the same fabled heights of \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" and \\"Blowin' in the Wind.\\" It houses one of his best vocals and most intriguing stories, a tangled, cryptic web of a couple whose paths intercross when they least expect it. \\"Simple Twist\\" is a heartbreakingly beautiful tale of missed opportunity, and \\"Shelter\\" is a bittersweet reflection. The closing \\"Buckets of Rain\\" tugs at the heartstrings\\" like no other song Dylan has ever written. The only song that stands out in a negative way is \\"Idiot Wind,\\" which is lyrically as good any track on the album (or any Dylan song for that matter) but the album arrangement suffers from a flat arrangement that lacks the bite to make such an angry song come alive. Both the quiet, eerie acoustic version from the Bootleg Series and the raging live performance of \\"Hard Rain\\" blow it out of the water.<br /><br />The sound quality on the remastered edition is absolutely terrific. \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" is an essential record from one of rock's most important voices.ritten.

0345505387|3.0|OK.  The \\"Outlander\\" series is my all-time favorite series.  So I was quite interested to see how a graphic novel would play out.  I knew it wouldn't cover new material, but merely show a different view point of already written material.<br /><br />I was apprehensive for one reason -- the drawing and depiction of Jamie.  All fans have a very strong image in their mind of what Jamie looks like.  This, I think, is why we both anticipate and dread a movie of \\"Outlander\\".  That being said, the drawing of Jamie wasn't a thing like I envision, and all of the characters didn't hold their features evenly throughout the novel... I kept having to go back and figure out who was supposed to be whom.<br /><br />Claire -- her expressions were generally drawn spot-on.  But good LORD.  WHAT is with the heaving breasts?????  I never in a million years envisioned Claire so.... buxom.  Yes, an ample behind, as Jamie has often lovingly and wickedly had a few words on that subject.  But I was so distracted by how Claire's upper region was drawn that I felt practically assaulted by them -- and I'm by no means a prude. I just felt the artist took the Manga style too far.  On Geilis, it worked.  On Claire, not so much.<br /><br />Murtagh -- not at all how I'd envisioned him.  But I liked his side of the story.<br /><br />Black Jack Randall -- interestingly, his image was a pretty good fit for me.<br /><br />This GN will only appeal (and then only probably half the time) to Gabaldon fans.  Anyone buying this as a stand-alone book will be lost.<br /><br />I couldn't help but read it, but I hope this is the last time a GN is attempted for this series.
B003O85W3A|5.0|I love this album from start to finish.  I love the mix of more upbeat songs like Month Of May, to the more mellow tune, The Sprawl I.  Every message in every song is worth listening and paying attention to.  If you check out this album, you will not be disappointment.

B003XQRZ7E|5.0|I was extremely happy to hear Joe let go and burn the neck of those Les Pauls.  I own every record and DVD that he's put out (except for Bloodline b/c I'm too cheap).  Based on his earlier records, which contained a mix of rock and blues, there's always been a tug of war inside Joe between Rock and Blues. Being that he could be a top 5 guitarist in any genre, I think it's great he's part of this effort.  On first listen, I winced at some of the high notes, but I've gotten to where I really like Hughe's voice now and the record overall.  Bonham and Sherinian are both excellent. I can't wait for the tour!!

B0039TD7PY|3.0|I'm a lifelong JT fan and own practically all of JT's albums in cd, dvd and sacd formats, including JT's 2-cd live album in the late 1990's which IMO sounds great. I had the opportunity of hearing JT live in Manila in 1995. However, I found the SQ of this album to be less than desirable. The track selections were great and include songs JT seldom sings in concerts but are quite lovely. IMO, the percussion sounds were just too loud. On several tracks JT's voice sounds thin (could it be because of the mic used?). I'm not an expert but felt this cd has a \\"boxed-in\\" sound. My old live cds were better recorded than this. I hate to be critical but I expect a lot since this was only recorded in 2007.I have a fairly large collection of maybe close to 2,000 music discs, including dvda and dvd-video and BD formats. I also own a separate good music system that include tube and ss equipment and HT in another room. I tried different players, preamps and speakers when playing this cd but sad to say the SQ left much to be desired.
0439023513|4.0|Before you read this book i strongly urge you to reread the first two books before reading Mockingjay.  It had been awhile since i read the second book Catching Fire.  I found myself not remembering characters or previous emotions toward each other.  After rereading the other two books, the characters and the plot made more sense to me.  This book has many troubling emotions with plot twists and even character mood twists.  Highly addictive with a great ending that made you sad, happy, and touched all at the same time.  It's just a fabulous series that anyone can enjoy

B003RNXIBK|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Eminem since he first burst on the music scene. THIS album is genius and more than that it is REAL! It isn't very often that the music of today has depth and emotion enough (regardless of the emotion) to slap a listener in the face with it and then reach in and speak to the heart. Eminem has done it with Recovery. He is RAW and holds nothing back...A risk for him personally to lay it all out there...A risk that paid off. LOVE LOVE this album and can't get enough Eminem.

0439023513|3.0|Couldn't wait to wrap up this trilogy.  I started reading the books because my daughter was interested in them.

B00000F169|5.0|I think some people are missing the point of Dark Star -- the plot point most often repeated is that these guys are in search of \\"unstable planets\\" to destroy in order to preclude colonization. But the unspoken truth is that their criteria for selecting the supposedly \\"unstable\\" planets set for destruction is incredibly thin. The result is that these four extremely bored, long-suffering (twenty years in space) bureacratic-type hippies are actually selecting perfectly fine planets, each one probably supporting life, and marking them for destruction -- mainly because they were sent on the mission with a total of twenty interstellar bombs, and they will be allowed to return home after all twenty bombs have been used to destroy planets. So basically, they're just in a hurry to get it done and go home. The movie picks up around bomb number 19, and the final bomb #20 is the one that decides to blow itself up in the bomb bay, due to the alien's tampering with the computer system.    This whole concept of four spaced out dudes travelling around the galaxy looking for perfectly good planets to destroy, for virtually no purpose besides destruction for destruction's sake, is, I think, the main driver of the absurdity of the movie, and is the main point of the underlying commentary being made by the filmmakers. Compare this to the corporate greed in Cameron's Avatar resulting in the destruction of the Navee, or the corporate bloodthirstiness later displayed in the Weyland-Utani corporation's search for the highly destructive life forms in the Alien series.    Also not being noticed by many on this forum: while it has been said that Dark Star is a 2001 parody, there is one scenario where the beachball (alien) traps Pinback in the elevator, which is resolved with a direct parody of the sequence in 2001 where commander Bowman lets himself into the Discovery using the explosive bolts. In the case of Dark Star, it's Pinback, fat stomach stuck in the tiny elevator hatch, who uses theexplosive bolts to eject himself from the non-functional elevator, his anger towards the alien imitating Bowmans determination to shut down Hal 9000 after releasing himself from being imprisoned in the pod with no space helmet. The elevator sequence in Dark Star has to be one of the most technically advanced and effective scenes ever designed. It's also funnier than sh&t!    For me one of the other funnier sections of this movie is Pinback's video diary in which he claims -- whether as a schizophrenic delusion, deliberate falsification, or perhaps even personal truth, we never really find out which -- to not actually be Pinback, but a lab technician who was mistaken for Pinback and accidentally launched into space on the mission. Dan O'Bannon's Pinback characterization is almost Firesign Theatre material (for those of you that are familiar with that popular 60s/70s progressive comedy troupe!)    Another hilarious scene worth mentioning is when Boiler, arguably the most macho of the bunch, reaches his limit of sanity, and decides to use the ship's laser for target practice on some metal plates, right inside the ship! Pinback realises this could kill everyone if the laster pierces the hull and the two of them get into a wrestling match over the laser. Pricelessly absurd and over-the-top!    At any rate, this is a fine, fine funny movie. Definitely check it out if you like Science Fiction, comedy, 2001, and absurd humour.

This is not the Great American Novel. What a disappointment.
B001MS7IBS|4.0|Let me start off by saying that FRINGE IS ONE OF THE MOST BEST SHOWS, PERIOD! [I think it goes without saying that it's one of my favorites]    Anywho, the bluray release of the 1st season has everything you'd expect out of such a great show. Packaged in a slim case with a cardboard sleeve with a holographic showing Walter, Olivia, and Peter. Then, turn it a couple of degrees to see the of the famous symbols/glyphs [for those of you that are curious, they do spell out something by the end of the show. Yup, it's an alphabet].    The picture and sound are top notch. The special features deliver quite a good amount of deleted scenes and featurettes that delve into everything behind the show. All in all, a great package.    My only gripe is trying to navigate through the menus. The discs are autoplay and it seems the menus were made more for the blu-ray pop up feature than a direct to menu type of thing. Not so user friendly. I'm hoping the second season will be a little more easier to get around. Nothing discouraging or too inconvenient.    Besides, the show is filmed and airs in HD [where applicable]. So, to see it at its full potential, the blu-ray release is the way to go. And, trust me, you can't find a better deal on a copy of Fringe: The complete 1st Season anywhere [save for a personal transaction from someone who couldn't get into the show...trust me, I've looked] other than Amazon.
0312600844|1.0|I was going to wait until I completely finished the book before I wrote this review, but as I am 3/4 of the way through it, I thought I would write one now. This truly is the most boring book I have ever read in my life. What is wrong with Oprah picking a book like this? Or don't I get it? Am I missing something? I read ALOT. I have over 100 books on my kindle since last November and to date, this is the first book I don't even know if I can finish. How the author goes ON AND ON about Walter and his environmental views trying to save a certain species (bird) seriously made me want to puke. If the story makes a major turn in the last quarter of the book I will write another review but will be extremely surprised.

B0034G4P7G|3.0|If your main interests in films are the three things in my title line, you're definitely going to love this movie.  They aren't mine, and so I never really got into The Social Network.  I was surprised that it never came together for me, as I have appreciated director Fincher's past work, even his interesting failures such as Zodiac.  This movie had the historical element of seeing the origins of Facebook, but it was much more about the relationship between two friends & business partners, Zuckerberg and Saverin.  In portraying how their relationship fell apart, it was apparently deemed necessary to center the film around scenes set in a conference room, with the two partners (and one other group of aggrieved parties) talking with lawyers.  Actors Eisenberg and Garfield, as Zuckerberg and Saverin, do their best to enliven the lawyer scenes with a lot of sulking, whining and sarcastic asides, but I still felt there were way too many lawyer scenes.  As for the other scenes (partying and programming), that's where Aaron Sorkin's gift/curse hurt the movie.  As screenwriter, he relied almost entirely on his trademark brainy, rapidfire dialog.  It's something that has worked well for Sorkin in the past, on the West Wing and elsewhere, but it can also get pretty annoying sometimes.  That happened right away for me, in the film's opening scene between Zuck and his then-girlfriend Erica.  Their discussion was occasionally funny, but too often just frustrating to listen to.  At one point later in the movie, Saverin is talking to his girlfriend in a cab just after a dinner meeting with Napster's Sean Parker.  He makes a comment about how Sean's self-absorbed monologue \\"set a new land-speed record for fast talking.\\"  At that moment, I was thinking that could be used to describe the entire Social Network movie.<br /><br />It wasn't entirely without redeeming elements, however.  The acting is often above par, especially Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg.  Even Justin Timberlake was good as the Mr. Napster.  And the film's score, by Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross, perfectly supports the action on the screen.  Overall, though, I didn't enjoy The Social Network nearly as much as I had expected to.the Mr. Napster.

B003XMUFGQ|2.0|As a huge Clapton fan, I was terribly disappointed in this new CD.  Describing the music as \\"Bland\\" is an understatement because these tunes could pass for elevator music.

B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited Away is an excellent animated Japanese film released in the United States by Walt Disney Studios. I believe it was awarded the Golden Bear for \\"Best Picture\\" at the Berlin Film Festival. If you are a parent with a young child or two I recomend you have them watch this movie. The imagination, animation and attention to detail are stunning. It's cute, it's fun and it will captivate the whole family.    The movie starts with a young girl, Chihiro, who moves to a new town with her parents. When the father takes a wrong turn they end up stumbling on an abandoned amusement park. The entire place is deserted except for one booth that is open, but no employees are to be found. As the sun goes down and the veil between the mortal world and the spirit world begins to thin, Chihiro finds that the park is not abandoned, but full of life! From when she was dragged into the Bath House to the moment she was able to return to the mortal world I was glued to the screen, watching as each scene unfolded, waiting to see what creature from Miyazaki's imagination would show up next.    Not only is it cute enough to entertain your children, it's strong enough to hold your attention to the screen as well. The struggle of one girls work to keep out of trouble in the spirit world and the team work the spirits show her to try to rescue her parents will also inspire a \\"fire\\" in your child's heart to fight for what they care about. This is definately a film EVERYONE should see before they turn 12. Watching this movie made me feel like I was \\"spirited away\\" (pun intended).
B003ITZBVS|5.0|I've been a big fan of DC animated cartoons, eventhough comicbook wise, I'm more of a marval man. These cartoons are usually well written and is not to kiddie for the content. I like all of the Justice League stuff (it's what got me hooked to DC animation). When that ended, DC started releasing animated movies, maybe once a month. Up until now, Doomsday (Superman) was my favorite animated movie. This surpasses it. The story line is great and it's full of action. You will really like this if you like some what dark and serious stories.

B0025UHKNS|3.0|Consider twice before buying this this if you have a Mac. I use a Macintosh with Snow Leopard and am unable to get my Garmin to pair with my computer using the ANT Stick. Furthermore, whenever I plug the ANT Stick into my computer, my Drobo file share disconnects and shuts off. Mac users may have to use a virtual machine or some other computer for synchronizing. On the plus side, the watch is small and comfortable and the GPS information is very accurate.    Update 02/27/2011: The battery life indicator is horrible. This watch needs to be fully charged between each use. Even if the battery indicator claims to have over 70% remaining, the watch will die in under five minutes.
0345505387|1.0|I have loved the Outlander Books for many years, and own multiple copies so I can loan them to others and encourage them to enjoy them as I have.  If the house caught on fire, I'd grab my collection of original Outlander books.    But this---disappointed doesn't even begin to cover it.  Diana Gabaldon is such a gifted writer, and her use of language and her ability to convey emotion and detail is amazing.      To have the beloved Outlander book reduced to this... a comic book....where the beautiful prose is chopped into small bits that will fit in a \\"balloon\\"...what was she thinking? As for the artistic depictions of much loved characters, while I can appreciate the artists talent, I found them to weak and pallid depictions of strong and admirable characters.     Who was she writing this book for?  I can't believe it was for those who have already  read and love the book. If this book attracts any new readers, it won't be for their appreciation of her writing skills.     I'm not sure what disturbs me more--actually reading this book, or writing something NEGATIVE about one of my most favorite authors. I just wish I could get this book out of my head now.

B003ZSI9YI|3.0|When Phil Collins became the frontman for Genesis after the departure of Peter Gabriel, he was harboring a dirty little secret. He was in a progressive rock band waiting for the chance to let out his inner soul child. When he embarked on a solo career in 1981, that's when he decided to let his blue eyed soul flag fly- loud and proud. He released his debut \\"Face Value\\" which featured \\"In The Air Tonight\\", a song in which the hit single was as huge as the myth surrounding it (The myth went as far as being mentioned on Eminem's song \\"Stan\\"). The album had appearances from Arif Mardin and the horn section of Earth, Wind & Fire. Then, on his sophomore album \\"Hello, I Must Be Going\\", he did a cover of The Supremes classic \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\". In 1984, he produced \\"Chinese Wall\\", the solo album from Earth, Wind & Fire's Philip Bailey, which yielded the hit duet \\"Easy Lover\\". He released his third solo album \\"No Jacket Required\\" featuring the hits \\"Sussudio\\" and \\"One More Night\\", which became staples on the music video channel BET. A few years later, he collaborated with Motown songwriter Lamont Dozier of Holland-Dozier-Holland for the song \\"Two Hearts\\" from the soundtrack to the 1988 film \\"Buster\\". So when Phil had announced in 2010 that he was doing an album comprised of entirely 60's Motown covers, hardly anyone was surprised- as they had seen this one coming.<br /><br />Though, the album was supposed to have Motown songs from the 1960's, he does sneak a few in from the early 1970's- notably two Stevie Wonder songs \\"Never Dreamed You'd Leave In Summer\\" and \\"Blame It On The Sun\\" as well as The Temptations' \\"Papa Was A Rolling Stone\\". He takes on The Four Tops' \\"Standing In The Shadows Of Love\\" as well as Smokey Robinson & The Miracles' \\"Going To A Go-Go\\". Surprisingly, he covers two well-known songs made famous by female singers, by giving the songs a male perspective which sounds a little strange (The songs in question being two songs by Martha And The Vandellas- \\"Jimmy Mack\\" and \\"(Love Is Like A) Heat Wave\\"). This album suffers from three things: First, the track sequencing is a little off in some instances. Secondly, there's way too many songs for a tribute album- twenty-five songs, to be exact. Lastly, many of the songs require a strong and powerful voice to carry the songs- something that Phil doesn't really have. While it's not a bad record, it's not a good one either. At least it's a step up from his rather dull 2002 album, the Rob Cavallo produced \\"Testify\\".and \\"(Love Is Like A) Heat Wave\\").

B003Y5H4SO|2.0|There really wasn't much psychological torture at all in this movie. There was even lesser physical torture in this movie.  So what are we left with? - -Not much really.  The characters trapped in the elevator are unlikeable; each are irritating and annoying, so why do I care if they die or not.  I really needed something more to sink my teeth into; a better, deeper plot, more in-depth characters, and better story telling.  This just seems like a cheap, crappy, movie night rental.

B003XMUFGQ|4.0|I like this album, a good choice of songs and a very good production around in all; so is very enjoyable hear it, a relaxing work make by a true musician and.. singer but not guitarist; yes singer, because is a more interessants work for this aspect (vocal, songs, production, selections of songs) respect to the guitar work inside, so if You find some guitar gems here i think is not your product, find iit in previous long life albums by clapton or in other great guitarists discography like Jose Feliciano or BBKing

B00337KM2S|3.0|George Clooney is one of People magazine's most photographed \\"older\\" men, meaning \\"older\\" women want to see him which is among the reasons he is sought out for films like this one: a dramedy with a handsome leading actor who thinks he knows himself, finds out life is about more than he thinks it is, tries to reconcile this new knowledge to his new goals, and finds out he's trapped in the life he's made for himself. This is all very nice, of course, and it fooled a lot of critics that haven't seen many movies into believing it was unique to this film even though Frederick March played the role more wisely and with greater commitment in [[ASIN:B0009NZ2OW The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit]] more than a half-century ago.<br /><br />Still, there is plenty to like about \\"Up In the Air,\\" not least of which is Clooney's characterization of a corporate head chopper -- the opposite of what used to be called a headhunter (someone that recruits candidates for open jobs.) In this role, Clooney plays the head chopper -- someone that goes around and tells people they are fired. The script says Clooney does this, \\"because companies are too chicken s--t to do it themselves.\\"<br /><br />That's disingenuous, of course. My wife was canned by a Fortune 500 corporation directly, not through a head chopper. She was called to personnel at 3 p.m. one day, told her job was eliminated and she was not being offered another in the company, that someone would get her coat, she should leave the building accompanied by company guards, and her personal belongings would be mailed to her.<br /><br />In \\"Up In the Air,\\" once Clooney delivers the bad news, people were allowed to hang around their office the rest of the day. In real life, people would tear up the place, spew virtriol to their soon-to-be ex-coworkers, and use their computers to download viruses to wreck their company's operating system under such circumstances. But, I recall saying there were things to like about this movie...<br /><br />Those include the film's second subject, Clooney's romance with another head chopper played by  Vera Farmiga ([[ASIN:B000M341QE The Departed]], [[ASIN:B000OU5NLW Quid Pro Quo]] and [[ASIN:B0000D9PNS Love in the Time of Money]]), who plays his female alter ego. In one scene they compare their travel and hospitality cards, a sad view into their lonely and empty lives spent on the road, in hotels, and in coporate backrooms telling people their careers are either dead, dying, or on life support, but a scene that seems on the surface to be one of happiness and fulfillment.<br /><br />The pair have an affair, of course, and, in a later incomprehensibly dumb sequence at Clooney's sister's wedding -- where he takes the object of his affair as a date -- Clooney's life objective suddenly turns 180 degrees. He then bolts, revolts, tries to relent, and calls on Farmiga to be his soulmate. This episode is full of heartbreak and predictability, but so is much of the movie.<br /><br />The main attraction of \\"Up In the Air\\" is the starry and beautiful leads, the breezy script that moves quickly from scene to scene, and the scenes where Clooney and Farmiga interact. Take away these elements and you have a fairly bland film about some aspects of corporate life in the post-2008 stock, auto, financial and employment markets' meltdown and its affect on the employees of those industries.<br /><br />Just as Michael Douglas played the angry American who lost his job in the 1991-92 recession in [[ASIN:0790742780 Falling Down]], George Clooney here represents the decaying infrastructure of America's coporations in the post-meltdown era. The fact that there's a love story and some beautiful people in this flick, and a fast script, is what keeps you from thinking about the reality of the situation. If you want to do that, watch Michael Moore's comedy [[ASIN:B0030Y11XS Capitalism: A Love Story]].subject, Clooney's romance with another head chopper played by  Vera Farmiga ([[ASIN:B000M341QE The Departed]], [[ASIN:B000OU5NLW Quid Pro Quo]] and [[ASIN:B0000D9PNS Love in the Time of Money]]), who plays his female alter ego.

B003JTHESA|4.0|I've been an Iron Maiden fan for 20+ years now.  With the notable exception of the two albums they produced without either Bruce Dickinson or Paul D'Anno (like Highlander 2, I prefer to deny these albums' existence), every album Iron Maiden has put out has been good to great to legendary (Number of the Beast and Seventh Son of a Seventh Son).  The Final Frontier is no exception.  The reason Iron Maiden is so great is because of their three-guitar sensory attack, Bruce Dickinson's vocals, Steve Harris' astounding writing and bass guitar work (best bassist in rock IMHO), and Nicko on the drums.  But far more than that, they have intelligent, thoughtful and thought-provoking material often based on works of literature, such as The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Out of the Silent Planet, Stranger in a Strange Land, Brave New World, etc., and historical and mythological figures, like Alexander the Great and Icarus.  The Final Frontier isn't a concept album per se, but contain themes ranging from science fiction to actual history.  I like that many of the songs alternate from slow to fast and back again, and I LOVE El Dorado (for some reason this song sticks in my head all the time).  A far better entry into their portfolio than Brave New World, in my opinion, which was their \\"Comeback Album\\", but not nearly as good as Flight 666, their double-live album of their world tour in which they only played the \\"old stuff\\".  I had the privilege of attending a Somewhere Back in Time show, and it was absolutely electric.  Even though this band is going on more than 30 years now, they rock as much as ever.  Bruce on stage is bouncing about and firing up the crowd like he never aged a day since Live After Death.  Iron Maiden hasn't become stale or repetitive despite their age, and continue to produce quality work that I will buy time and again.  UP THE IRONS!
B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|Just have to give my say on these reviews of the so-called horrible blu ray transfers. Just to remind people this movie IS about to be eighty years old! Grain is obvious and the detail is lacking, but it is still a beautiful transfer of this masterpiece. DNR would destroy what detail there is. You want to enhance the image and not take away from it. Just can't understand why some films transfer better than others from the same time period. Grain on this release actually gives the film 'atmosphere'. Remember you want it to look like film, not video which is what most blu rays look like: video. We need more transfers like this one that retains the film-like quality over the 'video' look that we get from studios these days.<br />Anyway, had to give my opinion over this 'controversial' transfer that most people will not like...once again, remember it's film, not video. Enjoy this quality transfer, because it's the best it has ever looked!!
B0043SGAPO|2.0|I thought this was a new disk from a legendary band that's back together. It looks more like one new song and whatever else was in the closet. I guess that's why they pushed the pre-order, so you would know it wasn't new material. Anyway, if I didn't have my Soundgarden collection, this would be a very good getting to know you CD. Best of if you will.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|As soon as I heard about this movie coming out, I knew I had to see. I was pleasantly surprised by Miley's acting. I think she did a great job. It was an amazing story. Having watched a few of Nicholas Sparks movies, I know to expect something amazing...except when I read the book first.<br /><br />After seeing A WALK TO REMEMBER several times, I finally made the decision to read the book. The first of the Nicholas Sparks books I've read. Though it was well written and a good story I could not believe how different it was. I guess I should have known then when I decided to see DEAR JOHN how different the movie would be after reading the book. What a letdown that was, though I'm sure it would have been good if I hadn't had the book to base if off of. Why, oh why do authors let that happen! And movie directors. If a book is a hit, why in God's name would they change it? And I mean major changes. It makes me wonder which I should do...read Nicholas Sparks books or see his movies? It's not really working, doing both.
B000063DIH|2.0|FOTD is by far the weakest Maiden album with Bruce Dickinson on vocals, and out of Maiden's 15 studio albums, I would rank this piece o' work number 13 (just above the Blaze albums sitting at the bottom of the pile). Don't get me wrong, I think \\"Be Quick or Be Dead\\", \\"From Here To Eternity\\", and the title track are all decent Maiden cuts, but the other nine songs are completely disposable in my opinion. Most of the music here is more straight-forward hard rock and the lyrics are very lackluster compared to previous Maiden efforts. I know the general population of Maiden fans consider \\"No Prayer for the Dying\\" to be the weakest offering with Bruce on vocals, but I'll take that record over FOTD any day. Thank the beast that these guys brought Bruce and Adrian back into the fold in the 21st century and redeemed themselves after a rather rough decade. Oh, and who the hell thought turning Eddie into a tree was a good idea? Download the three tracks listed above and forget the rest of this boring album.
B002ZG9968|4.0|I had wanted to see THE BACK UP PLAN when it came out in the theaters but never made it. When I discovered my library had it, I quickly put it on reserve. The movie wasn't quite what I was expecting, though it was a cute. Great idea, I just wished they would have played out the initial meeting/romance more before jumping into being a couple faced with becoming parents. A little too unbelievable for me. They had some great ideas they could of expounded on but didn't. It all seemed a little too rushed to me. But regardless, it was a cute movie with great acting.
0439023513|1.0|Wow, I have never before written a review about a book but I felt I just had to express my frustrations with this book.  I loved the first two books in the series and couldn't put them down until I had finished reading, and then \\"hungrily\\" awaited the third and final book in the series.  However, I can't fully express how disappointing this book was.  I seriously felt like I had totally wasted my time even reading the other two books since the author had to kill the series so horribly in the final book.  There is no character growth, in fact they seem to digress back to a worse state.  Main characters are being killed left and right with no thought or reason even really given to their deaths.  I felt like this book dragged me into a deep, dark, depressing depth that I had a hard time getting out of once I had finished the book.  Overall, the book failed to tie up the great story that was being created in the first two books.  I was thoroughly confused at several points near the end and the ending was such a deep disappointment. I had so much higher expectations for this book, and was so sad to be let down.
B000001DQI|5.0|This album was a true sensation by the time it was released. Somehow, Elton John (and Billy Joel in USA) knew renovate and redefine a new horizon into the Rock & Roll, paving the way to future legends to come (Eric Carmen, Barry Manillow,  George Michaels, David Bowie, Gino Vanelli and Robin Williams just to cite a few) and conveying us toward new perspectives, specially respect the ballad, enriching it with surprising tunes, thrills and innovative approach.<br /><br />You hardly will find such introduction: Funeral for a friend (to my mind his unsurpassed masterwork); the mythical song Candle in the wind, the dazzling Bennie and the Jets and finally Goodbye yellow brick road (his personal tribute for Wizard of Oz).<br /><br />The very fact this album was two months at the top position and two years among the top one hundred albums according to Billboard can give us an idea about the transcendence of it.<br /><br />One of the most pyramidal albums in the history of the pop music.<br /><br />A classic.

1439190275|5.0|I like the format of the new book, the studies are later in the book and only refereed to early on, which makes it more readable. The early atkins books had to defend the diet so much that all the studies were up front. Now with 60 per reviewed studies backing up the program its much so much necessary to defend the eating program. This is the perfect eating plan for those of us who have carb addiction, meaning our bodies store carbs as fat. Which is over 30% of people. The book is laid out in a simple format. fist the scientific facts of the plan in an easy way, then the four phases of the plan (Induction, Ongoing weight Loss, re Maintenance and Maintenance), as with any program for long term success you must learn how to eat for life and and make a lifetime commitment. I did Atkins back in the 90s with great success but I made some mistakes let my carb count creep up to much and my weight loss stopped and I quit and went back to my own ways. This book talks about that and what to do and I am pretty convinced I won't make the same mistakes again. So far so good, I am down 13 in a 4 weeks and feeling energized. Wish me luck.
1595141979|5.0|This whole series is one of the best reads I have found!!! I has everything I look for in a great book. It has love, romance, friendships, lies, secrets, betrayl, death, fights, ins and outs ups and downs, loss, redemption, passion, paranormal situations, good and bad guys, mystery and suspence! I would most definetly read it again and recomend it to anyone who asked!!!!!!!!!
B0034G4P7G|4.0|\\"The Social Network,\\" while it is a realistic look at the creation of Facebook, it is also a look at the culture of cool that pervades our society, ostracizes some, and a few are able to overcome the odds and become successful. At the end of the movie we're told that Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg is worth 25 billion dollars, but the unanswered question is, at what cost to the person?<br /><br />Losing a girlfriend has long been the reason for writers to create their first seminal works. Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Kerouac and probably any other writer would be a good example. This is how we first see Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) in the fall of 2003, an undergrad at Harvard getting dumped by his girlfriend. After a flip-flopping run home he proceeds to get drunk and start hacking the college's \\"face books,\\" pictures of the dorms inhabitants, putting online the pictures of the female students and asking them to be rated on beauty. This crashes Harvard's servers and brings attention to Zuckerberg. At first further ostracizing him from the female students, but also putting him in contact with Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (Armie Hammer and Josh Pence respectively), who have an idea for an exclusive student dating service that lists likes and dislikes, interests etc. but they need somebody to write the code for them. Zuckerberg quickly takes their idea and runs with it, runs away with it. He incorporates their idea with his and enlists his one friend, Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield), to provide money for operating expenses and act as CFO. Soon \\"The Facebook\\" is becoming wildly popular. Eduardo is trying to get Zuckerberg to get advertisers but Zuckerberg resists because \\"Facebook is cool.\\" Along comes Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), as a nerds idea of a rock star, fresh from the demise of Napster and looking to hitch his wagon to a paying concern. He mentors Zuckerberg through the minefields of a business, he maintains, only they can understand. All Zuckerberg really wants is to find a girlfriend. At each point where he's rejected it pushes him to expand Facebook and at each of those points he willingly screws the partners that helped him get to where he was. I think there's more back stabbing going on in \\"The Social Network\\" than in Wall Street.<br /><br />Zuckerberg is shown to be an inherently unlikable character. Even when he's trying to attract investors he acts anti-socially and contrary to his own goals. Eisenberg's Zuckerberg will probably piss you off, or maybe you'll be sympathetic to his point of view, but \\"The Social Network\\" is doing its job you don't see the actors as characters but as the people they're meant to represent.<br /><br />While Mark Zuckerberg may act anti-socially in his private life, the ultimate point may be that social networking is inherently anti-social in that it's not true interaction with people.

B001UJSW7S|5.0|Hearing this recording leads me to ask why this opera is performed so infrequently. I saw a production years ago in Los Angeles, but had really forgotten how incredibly beautiful the score is. In that performance, the leads were James King and Anna Silja (as I remember), both sounding, to be kind, a little \\"strained\\".  The production was from Deutsche Opera of Berlin, and the stage effect of the appearance of real water in the canals was spectacular. Of course everyone knows the \\"big\\" aria (which is really a duet - done as a solo, the soprano just sings both her and the tenor's lines), but the rest of the score is equally breathtaking. And the performances on this recording are truly wonderful. Carol Neblett never sounded better than on this recording - her voice is full and rich, seemingly without any expressive limit. Rene Kollo gives a truly moving performance, and his voice sounds fresh and vibrant (in some recordings he can be a little \\"blatty\\", but that is not at all the case here). Hermann Prey is, of course, his usual perfection, and Leinsdorf's conducting is both powerful and sensitive, drawing out the full beauty and emotional richness of the score. This has quickly become one of my favorite recordings.
B003XMUFGQ|3.0|I've been a fan of Eric Clapton for almost 30 years and I believe that I can say with all certainty that Eric was born to play the electric guitar.  I just wish he would get back to it.    Clapton has long been known for stylistic changes - and this album definitely qualifies.  It's mature, soft-spoken and at times profound.  The covers of the blues traditionals are good but I was hoping for something more harder-edged like the covers from the great \\"From the Cradle\\" album.    This one paints an older, sepia-toned, music-on-the-front-porch kind of picture.  If that's what you're looking forward to, you'll love it.    I know that Eric is maturing as a human being as well as an artist.  He's gotten older.  I guess I just don't want him to...
B0000025CP|4.0|Yes, Rob is [...], and people aren't always treated the same, and we need to do more, but I just think Rob sings too high on this one. . . Rob Halford may be trying to sound youthful on Stained Class.<br /><br />Not sure if this is the first speed metal or progressive or power metal album. If the music became more extreme at least the songs themselves became more enlightening. Up till then Metal music had at least the taint of reaction associated with it. If the musicians weren't out to get themselves on the cover of GQ magazine, or even able to improve themselves much, depending on who's asking, at least they became culturally sensitive. Perhaps, looking back, this album marks the beginning of a new era for Metal music. Metal is slow to change.<br /><br />Stained Class gets 4 stars from me because it's different and it's a polished and well-produced album. I'm not sure the sound here goes well with the shorter kind of songs Judas Priest are playing. The progressive metal sound goes better, I think, with the longer songs and the classical-like music a lot of bands play.<br /><br />The drums are amazing here. I remember the bands Heart and Kansas both doing comeback albums during the 1990's and the drum work sounded a bit like Stained Class. The cymbal work is what is really noteworthy here. At times the cymbals sound very good and at times God himself seems playing them. Not sure the cymbal work has ever been replicated.<br /><br />Other reviewers have noted this albums obsession with darkness and death. The whole album is not death-obsessed. Only the songs on 'side-two' form a single theme, in my opinion. A concept half-album. Interesting, on most of the remasters the song order's been changed. Not on Stained Class. The songs are in the original order with two bonus songs added onto the end.<br /><br />A lot of Priest songs, that weren't that good but were kind of fast or heavy ended up getting the album name. Sinner, Hell Bent for Leather, Screaming for Vengeance and Painkiller ended up being the album name (yeah, I know Painkiller is a favorite). Fortunately, the band picks Stained Class as the album name. The whole album has a bit of a Sci Fi feel to it. There are cool sound effects at the beginning or ending of songs. White Heat, Red Hot might be the best song on the record. A couple of the verses on Heroes End, &#34;Why do you have to die if you're a hero&#34;, are about Janis Joplin and Jimmy Hendrix, something I wouldn't have figured out on my own.<br /><br />'Savage' &#34;who's the savage? modern man&#34; - I always thought was an interesting way of looking at things. Just a heavy metal head, little did I realize this viewpoint wasn't limited to a Judas Priest song. It's been a good part of what 'anthropology' and 'sociology' have been about. I believe the hit film Avatar held a similar theme. This 'noble savage' idea suggests that people are born in life as a blank slate and that people are by nature good. It's a sort of a humanistic and benevolent view of human nature. It is not a universal idea, however. While some of us are indeed held out to be, undisturbed, naturally noble or pristine, others among us are constrained by the idea of original sin. Some of us must be watched, educated about, constrained and legislated against.<br /><br />Saints in Hell is probably what got me to review this album. Was looking at the lyrics to it while watching a video on Youtube, and for just a moment, just a tiny moment, looking at the lyrics I thought this song may have been examining something that was going on in the real world. A 'metaphorical' type of song I guess. Looking over the lyrics again, I'm probably wrong. The idea doesn't have much merit. No. It couldn't be. No (thought if I kept repeating the denial it might sound humorous). Don't think it does.<br /><br />Some of the music for Saints in Hell seems adapted from the song Cheater on their first album. Another reviewer notes it has no guitar solo. You know. . . what is going on with side two? Is the theme limited to just the 2nd half of the CD? That's a lot of support for one song, Beyond the Realms of Death. lol - the song the band actually wrote themselves was probably Savage. Who the heck knows?hat's a lot of support for one song, Beyond the Realms of Death. lol - the song the band actually wrote themselves was probably Savage. Who the heck knows?
B00005B1W7|5.0|This is an excellent Mimi Series.  I loaned my old copy out and never got it back so I am so glad that I could order another one.  A very, very good movie and I recommend it to anyone that enjoys Jewish history.
B00005K9LN|3.0|I remember the local news or 'Inside Edition' show playing a Judas Priest video on TV after school. I remember calling up my friend, Todd, who had the cool older brother who turned us on to the world of hard rock. . . \\"Todd dude\\", \\"the guy on TV said the band 'Judas Priest' would be on\\". Heavy metal thunder was back, they said. Sure enough, after commercial the station played Breaking the Law. Judas Priest might be remembered for this one song. As a joke, I should note that British Steel is being billed as 'the first heavy metal album to have absolutely no blues influence' for this 30th anniversary reprint. Even heavy metal can be 'authentic'. How times change.<br /><br />In case my joke needs better explanation. . . uhm, I think very slowly. . . so it took Me 20 years before I Wondered if maybe Breaking the Law was meant to be a bit 'ironic'. Sort of a, uhm, 'Sopranos' of the music business. With this 30th anniversary edition, I think the label of 'the first heavy metal record to be completely free of blues influence' - a statement that makes no sense by itself - I think it's meant to reassure us that, no, Breaking the Law is in no way ironic. So metal-heads. We can all feel good about ourselves. Cool. So buy this CD?<br /><br />Sometimes when you get a new record, after a couple listens you pick out the songs you think are going to be big or 'last' or whatever. I picked Metal Gods as a second favorite to Breaking the Law, maybe. It's not one of their big hits but it got a fair amount of live play and became Rob Halford's namesake. Kudos to me. Actually listening again. . . I don't have the best taste in the world. . . I even like Rapid Fire. Perhaps because it's one of the few on the record I think the band doesn't take too seriously. This is a punishing record, tho, especially songs like Grinder. There's a very 'American' sound to it. You'd never guess the band was from England if the album wasn't named British Steel.<br /><br />On the negative side, it's 'heavy metal noise' and proud of it. Even plodding at times.  Rob Halford, a very good singer, gives out a barking, growling performance. No one out-man's Judas Priest! This could almost be a tribute album to Bon Scott, AC/DC's singer who had 'died'. I note 'died' because after all this is the realm of Spinal Tap. . . If singing the high notes on Sad Wings of Destiny didn't kill Rob Halford's voice, surely recording British Steel did. Not only is the singer singing unnaturally, the songs are all one-way and one-speed. I'm sure playing heavy metal is fun, but the band is trying to please a testosterone possessed audience with this one, and that's about it? I'm even sick of hearing 'Livin After Midnight'. Can't think of a band I like that I'm sick of hearing one of their songs on the radio. I'm not sure I ever liked the song, actually.<br /><br />10 stars for Breaking the Law, 5 stars for everything else.metal noise' and proud of it. Even plodding at times.

B003P2WO5E|4.0|Personally I think this book is awesome. The hardback version deserves a full 5 stars in my opinion. However I bought the Kindle edition so that I could reread the book again without having to carry around a massive 1003 page book. The illustrations in the hardback edition were fantastice. They helped to further develop the mental image I was creating while reading this book and I loved them. The Kindle version just doesn't do them justice. It's too hard to read what is written on the images and maps. So for anyone reading this, don't get the Kindle version if at all possible. Instead go for the hardback copy in all its awesomeness.
B0011V9XT6|5.0|This is one of the best concert DVDs I've ever seen.  The production quality is outstanding, with the hard work that's gone into the variety of different numbers, and Beyonce over-delivers as always in a world-class performance.  Seeing stunning clarity and energy captured on blu-ray from one of the world's top performers is a memorable experience; I've re-watched this dvd many times - it's great.<br /><br />On this dvd, my favorite tracks are deja vu, get me bodied, check on it, naughty girl, baby boy, beautiful liar, and crazy in love.  Sensational work ethic and performance from everyone, B and the dancers and band did a great job delivering a high energy concert - worth watching many times.  The showmanship on this is outstanding, the energy and excitement are fun to watch, and this is a great dvd.  Thx to Beyonce and team for doing it right... nice job!<br /><br />- ken

Compared to \\"Talk to Her\\" or \\"All About My Mother,\\" or \\"Bad Education,\\" or others, this is really a kind of slow, second-rate film.  If you love to luxuriate in Penelope Cruz's allures--her impossibly huge eyes, luscious hair, bouncy, ivory skin--then by all means, watch it.  But go to Almodovar's other films for a complete cinematic package.
0553805371|5.0|This book is surprisingly short. Most books on the subject of physics and cosmology pack quite a bit of physical heft, such is not the case with this mini-tome. But do not be fooled, the book is jammed with tons of information, laid out very clearly, simply and convincingly.<br /><br />This book is easily one of the most thought provoking books of the year. Stephen Hawking does an amazing job of explaining the principle notion that at the most basic level of the universe, there is likely a very simple set of rules, which is quantifiable, once we find a way to gain a finer view of the universe, as opposed to our naturally macroscopic view.<br /><br />The thoughts presented in this book simply floored me, and have left my mind reeling with the infinite possibilities present in our universe.<br /><br />This is a MUST read.

0307592839|4.0|\\"A Visit From The Goon Squad\\"<br />By Jennifer Egan<br />---------------------------------------------<br />This is a very clever -- perhaps too clever -- contemporary satire which explores the breakdowns and transitions of social norms in the texting/bloggy culture of today, and of the near future.  The structure of the book is purposefully disjointed, skipping around in time and place, with the lives of various characters intersecting in an interwoven, Altmanesque way.  Ms. Egan is a very clever and cutting writer, able to cram a lot of incisive observations and witticisms into a very compact space.  But while her wry asides are captivating, the story itself is not compelling. One problem is the underlying sadism she shows towards her characters: until the very final chapter none of them are really likable (although they are easily understood and somewhat sympathetic) and none show any joy at all until the somewhat rushed, implausible grand ending.<br /><br />There is an underlying bleakness and nihilism at work here that I found distasteful -- characters were neatly sketched out only to be eviscerated by various prefabricated tragedies, demolished, one after another, like a wobbly row of grinning, hapless strawmen.  Watching them get mowed down like extras in a war film made it hard to care what happened in the book, other than on a superficial, entertaining level.  And to be sure, there are some very entertaining passages and some clever storytelling, such as the innovative/gimmicky chapter told all in a futuristic power-point presentation (but filled with some of the book's most acute emotional content.) Nonetheless, I'm not interested in a book populated with objects of pity and dysfunction; although I suppose that's the norm in today's literature. It isn't terribly appealing and has the added effect of making Egan's cleverness feel glib, even though some of her ideas are quite acute: her vision of the utter amorality and vapidity of Generation Text was pretty sobering.<br /><br />This was an okay read, with a few characters I was drawn to, but unable to care about. I'd give it a 3.5 if I could. (DJ Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain book reviews)is was an okay read, with a few characters I was drawn to, but unable to care about. I'd give it a 3.5 if I could.

B002VECMAE|1.0|George Clooney, who can be a good actor, has made a number of films that are not good at all. The seeming object of such films is simply to have fun. Clooney frequently joins up with several good actors in such films, all of them acting in a ridiculous/funny manner. This is one such film. Both the manner in which the story is told and more significantly the way the actors act silly made the film so bad that I quite watching it after seeing a third of it.

B0000844M8|4.0|Words can't describe how much this movie meant to me as a kid...and now as an adult.  It shows a young person's movie can be a glorious experience without sexual inuendos, sarcastic characters, and sexy clothes.    This movie is so good, it cries out for a better film to video transfer.   This verion has poor sound quality, lacks BluRay resolution, is full of dust specks, and has frequent splice bumps (shaking when going from one scene to the next).  What a pity.   It deserves better.   A few \\"DVD Extras\\" would also be great.    This movie has some of the best music and photography ever (with the exception of the \\"day for night scenes\\", when the sky just happens to be bight blue in the middle of the night).    Here's hoping that the studio re-releases this film in BluRay with the high quality picture and sound transfer that it deserves!   I'll be the first in line to buy it!

Wireless microphones were way too expensive and required the referee to wear equipment.  I tried using a baby monitor, but it was too large and heavy, difficult to mount, picked up all ambient noise, and did not have a provision for headphones.<br /><br />I came across the Sonic Super Ear Personal Sound Amplifier and, combined with an audio extender cable, it does the job!<br /><br />PROs:<br /><br />1.

0316098337|5.0|One of the best books I've read in years, \\"Room\\" is destined to become a classic which will be talked about in book clubs and mandated for older high school and college students. And it is true that you can't put this book down until it is finished.  The time spent on this book comes afterward--you will think about it for days to come.  The issues that it raises about the reactions of captives to their surroundings, to their captors; their ability to maintain more than a modicum of sanity: their relationship with each other and the differences in the attitudes of mother and child are both thought provoking and mind boggling.  Jack and his \\"Ma\\" are both endearing characters who are intelligent, resourceful and brave. The surprising part is that they will need these qualities as much in the outside world as in \\"Room.\\" We think we understand at least in part, the horror of their circumstances but we cannot.  We think we understand the challenges that newfound freedom brings, but we do not.  What we discover is that there are no set formulas, no magic pills to \\"fix\\" them.  In the long run it will be the qualities that enabled them to survive \\"Room\\" that will allow them to be free.

B0042J6VUS|5.0|I have taken a look at most iPhone stands listed in Amazon. Most of them are very fragile (made by thin plastic) and do not provide enough stability (usually have very small base). The good part of those stands is that they are very portable for travel use. However, they are often overpriced and range from $8 to $25.     This stand is the opposite of all the above. For $11 (including shipping), it actually contains an iPhone-to-tripod adapter and a mini tripod. It is very sturdy and 100% adjustable. You can place your iPhone and iPod in any angle you like and it always remain stable (especially in the portrait mode). This is especially critical when you are doing face time with your friends and family since you want to properly face the camera.    The adapter is made of plastic, and the middle part works like a clamp that securely fastens your iPhone. The side bracket is just to protect the phone from falling off the bracket by accident. So far I only use it for 1 day, and cannot comment on the durability.     The tripod is very basic. But you can always use your own tripod with the included adapter.     The only drawback is that it is not as small as the other tiny stands. However, it can easily fit any hand bag or carry-on luggage without any problem. However, I will trade off some portability for the build quality and its full adjustability.
0547258305|4.0|I just loved this book, for the first half or so. I can't remember enjoying a book so much in a long time. But then the author sends the main character off on a rather solitary quest, and it's all ice and snow and making hats out of animal skins, and all the interesting characters and relationships disappear. When the character emerges from this trek, the author takes a very dark turn and has some terrible things happen. By the time the book ended, I was a bit stunned and not a little disappointed. This could have been one of my top 10 favorites of all time, and instead it's just a good book that I enjoyed. The first half was so strong that I'm quite willing to read her next book, as well as the sequel to this story, due out next year. But I can't wholeheartedly recommend it, like I was planning to do while I was reading the first half.

985357456X|1.0|Please beware that the UPC on this listing is not the standard Warner Home Video code, but the UPC code which is widely reviled as the Chinese knock-off version:  UPC 9789853574562.  Problems include scratches and deformities, poor copy quality and DVD cancer (early read failures).  Most knock-off versions do not include the published materials (series booklet and such) included with the genuine Warner Home Video product.  That's because duplicating DVD's is cheap to the Chinese, but printing a glossy multicolor booklet is too expensive.    I've seen one package with UPC 012569832688 which appeared proper and complete, with DVD's which worked.  I assume that is the real Warner Home Video UPC code.    Amazon should require that the UPC be disclosed on every listing and it should work to eradicate the knock-off problem by requiring a warning to people looking at such products.  It should also impose on sellers of such stuff an obligation to provide liberal return policies better than the rudimentary A-to-Z guarantee.
0439023483|5.0|Hunger Games and it's second part ( Catching Fire) were Christmas gifts from my boyfriend but I must admit that I haven't really heard much about them prior to last year's holiday. Once I had them all sorts of wonderful reviews started to come to my attention and I wondered: what is this book, why is it so special? All I had to do was read it to find out for myself but I read it without knowing too much of the plot and I have to say it was a wonderful way to go about it. The book was a pleasant surprise, but be warned, once you start reading it you won't want to put it down, I realized that Suzanne Collins  was a writer for one of my favorite tv shows when I was growing up, Nickelodeon's quirky  Clarissa Explains It All which I love to this day, so I was ecstatic to see that this was her creation, it certainly had a richness and spunk that most YA books lack even if they are entertaining, it had a layer of depth that gave me chills, it's a book that you want to be rude with, meaning you want to whip it out while you're out socializing and read it at the dinner table or when people are trying to chat with you, it's impossible not to think about it once the first few pages are turned.      Not knowing anything about this story can be great so those who want to go in blind please do so, it's a great way to enjoy this story but to summon it up I will say that it has courage, hope, gruesome deaths ( somehow it works, don't ask me how) and plenty of tension, not to mention layers of themes that make it feel like dinner and desert all in one. If I had to categorize these genera I'd call is science fiction but with an organic feel, there is blood and sweat, not just metal and batteries. Post apocalyptic America is transformed into Panem and there are twelve districts who specialize in different things ( some are about agriculture, others about minerals or different types of labor) and each year a boy and a girl is chose form each district to be taken to an arena, well a landscape, to battle to the death and only one wins, if they refuse gruesome end will come to the whole district and all of the inhabitants. Even though they are just kids many are ready to battle, fame and glory is showered upon the contestants and of course especially on the winner, some harbor a hunger to kill while others cringe at the thought of hurting anyone, there can only be one winner and the contestants are chosen at random. Our heroine is Katniss Everdeen from district twelve, her problem is that her battle partner is her neighbor who starts to grow on her, how on Earth do you battle twenty three teens, one of them being your friend or even something more and survive with a clear conscience and still come out being the same person is beyond me, but that is the task. Hunger Games reminded me of a movie that I loved, Battle Royale, it's a wild read but somehow it works, the glitz and glam of winning makes some of the kids stand out from the crowd, some grow more vicious while others develop guts, but it's too late for all of them except for one...the adventure begins and let me tell you, it's a wild and exciting ride, as gruesome as it sounds.    This is easily one of the best books of 2010 and I think I will remember it for a very long time. The second I was done reading it ( I actually woke up early on a Saturday morning to read the last hundred pages) I pulled Catching Fire off my shelf and read the next chapter, it's good.. I had to stop myself from reading it all in one sitting, I got the third book last week but I plan to stretch them over a few weeks,a pleasurable torment! This is going to be made into a film trilogy and I'm very curious to see if the pictures all those words created will match those in my head, books are always nicer but the more Hunger Games I get the better, enjoy!    - Kasia S.

B0043JEA14|5.0|In 1973, I watched the Doobie Brothers in concert at the Coliseum in Indianapolis, as a warm-up band for Rod Stewart & Faces. I had become familiar with their music through the \\"Toulouse Street\\" & \\"The Captain And Me\\" 8-tracks prior to that concert, and couldn't wait for them to take the stage.  They kicked a** that night, and I was hooked as a true fan of their signature sound.  \\"What Were Once Habits...\\" and \\"Stampede\\" continued to perfect this sound and bring us many hours of listening pleasure.  Then, Tom Johnston became ill and Mike McDonald stepped in.  Suddenly, the core was no longer the Doobie Brothers, but had become a back-up band for Mike McDonald (Jazz and R&B)and Skunk Baxter (Steely Danish) stylings.  It was good for the masses, but true Doobieites wished for the originals to return to the rock & roll roots and signature sound they were known for.    Since \\"Cycles\\", they have been trying to accomplish this.  Finally, \\"World Gone Crazy\\" is an example of what years of effort can achieve.  After you get by the Jimmy Buffett toned \\"A Brighter Day\\" (nice, but not traditional Doobies), kickin' tail rock & roll makes it appearance in full return.  When I saw that Mr. McDonald joined in on \\"Don't Say Goodbye\\", I was fearful.  Yet the song still carries traditional Doobieistic sound.  Even Willie Nelson (on \\"I Know We Won\\") can't detract from the fact that this is the Doobies at their best.      If you've ever like the true Doobie Brothers of old, don't miss out on this addition to their discography.  Instead, add it to your rotation and indulge yourself to the fact that history can and does repeat itself ... sometimes (as in this case) for the best!
6303022901|5.0|I love the dynamics in each mother-daughter relationship and the history from each one. This movie always makes me cry and reflect on the relationship with my own mother and heritage.
B003F3NDWG|1.0|Probably the worst show I've ever watched.  Is Castle a trans-sexual?  Is he happy in the midst of 15 women who continually deprecate his manhood?  Berate his intelligence?  Snide his maturity?      Yep, he's a camper.  And a fine liberal fellow, indeed.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I love this entire film, which shows the long struggle of this weak man (physically), with a strong conviction and determined will to abolish slavery in England, whose minister and mentor was the man who wrote the hymn Amazing Grace.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|A must have for a Rush fan, and an a must see for any music fan. If you love Rush you must get this. Not only is it the documentary fans have been waiting for, it is one of the best done on any group. And the footage looks amazing, as usual with anything that has the Rush name on it. And if you are a casual fan or just like music docs it is a must see.

B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised that I can listen to the entire CD and not feel annoyed at some songs.  None of the other songs are as good as Little Lion Man in sound but the words and feel of the music overall is great.
6303168507|5.0|This movie takes you back to WWII and the awful atrocities that took place. I love Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes' performances. All the characters are brought to life as a memorial and in the end you see some of the true life survivors. A very significant and touching film!
B003L1ZWG2|5.0|The premise couldn't be more simple: Three people stuck on a chairlift at a ski resort. From this very simple premise director Adam Green concocts a gut-wrenching survival thriller. It's a very primal man versus nature tale. Now, there a handful of contrivances that are required for the central conflict to emerge, however, Frozen is so thoroughly successful overall that I am more than willing to overlook these contrivances. Some people are apparently not willing to overlook them. My feeling is, if you can't suspend disbelief, why even bother watching movies at all? Nearly all movies strain credibility at some point. It's very often a necessity in order to tell a good, thrilling story. Having said that, I feel that Frozen is an unabashed homerun. It's a film that sets out to do one thing: unnerve you and keep you on the edge or your seat, and does it extremely well. It gives us three characters who are tolerable if not likable and who I found it quite easy to sympathize with. They are well-written characters who seem like real people, not stereotypes. I was truly emotionally invested in their survival. The three actors play their parts very well indeed. The success of a film like this pretty much rides on the actors, and they do a great job carrying the film. There are moments in Frozen that I found to be unbearably intense. Particulary the scenes involving the Dan character and his leap from the chair. So intense were they that I had to stop the movie and catch my breath. It has been a long time since I've been this affected by a horror movie.     I disagree that Frozen is not a horror movie. It is very much a horror movie. It is truly horrifying. It is more terrifying than any movie I have seen in recent memory. I was also more emotionally engaged by Frozen than any horror movie I can think of in years. That says a whole lot right there. What was the last horror movie you saw where you actually felt sorry for the characters? Where you desperately wanted them to survive? Where you were almost angry at the filmmakers for putting them through such hell? Frozen provoked just those kind of reactions from me which are very rare.     Now of course there will those audience members who say that the film is \\"too far-fetched\\", \\"too unbelievable\\", etc. I have never skied in my life (and after seeing Frozen, very likely never will). I don't know how plausible this scenario is. In fact, I'm quite sure that it's not possible for people to be stuck on a chairlift as depicted in this movie. I'm quite sure that the things that happen in this movie are very very unlikely to ever happen in real life. But I don't care. It doesn't matter. Frozen is a fictional horror movie. A movie that seeks to entertain, frighten, excite, make you gasp and keep you on the edge of your seat. And it does that extremely well. I must also give director Adam Green props for shooting on location and completely avoiding CGI. How refreshing to see a film in 2010 that doesn't resort to godawful CG effects. The wolves are real wolves. The gore effects are actual physical makeup effects. Just another reason why the movie rules. Frozen is one of the best horror movies of the past decade.

B003UERZ88|4.0|People...this is for the negative reviews.   First off, this is new metal from the Metal God...which is awesome just for that reason.  It is impossible to compare this to all the great Priest/Halford/Fight songs and albums.  This isn't as hard as some of those.  But it is good stuff...just enjoy it!
B0031ZWZR2|5.0|I really enjoyed this series - disappointed that you are able to purchase Part 1 and Part 2 seperately - bit of a ripoff if you get Part 1 first. Apart from that - was rivited by the concept. I really enjoyed the book and as pleasantly surprised by the series - most enjoyable, highly recommended.
092389165X|2.0|The book is great.  Gives a unique view into Japanese survivors of the A-Bomb.  However, this edition for what ever reason, does not include the Aftermath epilogue. I needed that chapter for my class and was very upset this book did not have it.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|I think Mr. Follet and his newest book \\"Fall of Giants\\" deserve to be treated fairly. I understand that the Kindle price is high; but it is not the author's fault. If anyone does not agree with the price, don't buy it rather than rating the book as one-star. In my humble opinion, in future, Amazon should allow customers to rate the book in two categories: one for price and one for content.
B000062Y98|5.0|While \\"Imaginations From the Other Side\\" may be Blind Guardian's defining moment, their 2002 album \\"A Night At the Opera\\" could well be the band's most adventurous output.  Yes, \\"Nightfall In Middle Earth\\" took a risk by so flagrantly flying the band's geek-fandom flag in the form of a full-on concept album based on the least known of Tolkien's major works, but with a target audience of metalheads, the subject matter, combined with songs that fall more or less within a set of well-defined metal parameters and sounds, took some of the danger of failure away.  \\"A Night At the Opera\\", on the other hand, took the glorious excess of \\"Nightfall\\", ramped it up further, and threw in some oddball influences that risked alienating the generally musically-conservative power metal fanbase.    Perhaps it's almost fitting that this was to be Thomen Stauch's last studio album with Blind Guardian, as despite his alleged desire to return to the more straightforward music of the band's past, it's his drumming that leads the charge into new territory here.  The staccato timing on the opener, \\"Precious Jerusalem\\", sets the tone for the proceedings, while his wild flourishes on the utterly epic \\"Battlefield\\" add a sweeping element of chaotic grandeur to the proceedings, followed by industrial-sounding percussion on the intro to \\"Under the Ice\\".  Of course, he's not alone, as it seems the band as a whole was committed to elude expectations.  Unless you count the bonus Spanish version of \\"Harvest of Sorrow\\", there's really no acoustic-based ballad; instead, you get the lush pseudo-ballad \\"The Maiden and the Minstrel Knight\\" (complete with an oddly laid-back waltz time beat during the chorus).      Meanwhile, \\"Sadly Sings Destiny\\" is perhaps one the most modern-sounding songs Blind Guardian has ever written, starting with an almost looped-sounding, wah-drenched guitar line, and ending with a sequencer-laden, bass-driven jam bit.......but all without losing the trademark Blind Guardian overdubbed vocals and guitar lines.  It's all just a bit more edgy and unpredictable than one would expect.  \\"Wait For An Answer\\" seems to filter U2 and Big Country sensibilities through the Blind Guardian strainer, coupling echoing, open sounding guitar lines over huge vocal choirs.  And in case fans of \\"Nightfall\\" were concerned, there's still \\"The Soulforged\\", a piece of hypermelodic power metal, with a singalong chorus straight out of the \\"Mirror, Mirror\\" school of songwriting.  Perhaps most importantly, however, is \\"And Then There Was Silence\\", the most unlikely, 14 minute single I've heard.  This thing is an absolute monster, and has to be the band's most elaborate, overdubbed song to date.  Clearly modeled after songs such as Queen's \\"March of the Black Queen\\", it ebbs and flows, waxes and wanes, and sweeps across entire musical continents.  Misty tales and poems lost, indeed.    Granted, \\"A Night At The Opera\\" isn't necessarily an easy listen.  Aside from \\"Age of False Innocence\\" being not quite gripping, you'll occasionally come across oddities such as an out of tune vocal or accidentally recorded bit of feedback popping up during \\"Under The Ice\\".  Also, due to the insane number of tracks used, the production is ever so slightly muddy, and things tend to get a bit.....well, confusing.  The songs aren't as instantly appealing, and chances are that at least a couple of the tunes won't really click with you.  But overall, you really need to check out the sheer chutzpah this album exudes.
B0034G4OVS|2.0|Sometimes there are movies that are good. Sometimes there are movies that are bad. Sometimes however there are movies that are so bad, they become good. Frozen is one of those films. It went from horribly dull and slow moving to hilarious in very unintentional ways. This movie is definitely one of those you \\"MST3K\\" through in order because even though it is meant to be a thriller, the would-be scary or shocking parts are done in such a way you can't help but laugh at the awfulness.    The first thirty minutes of the film is just standing around talking. It's meant to give the main triad of characters personality and back story so you care about them when they are trapped on the ski lift of doom. It fails and because you know the characters are going to be trapped on the skilift for most of the movie, it's hard to care about anyone else that comes up in the film. The writer and director seem to know this and so these characters are given such little personality than it really just feels like walk-on actors reading lines rather than characters in a film.    Once on the ski-lift things get better and then they plummet drastically down into campy b-movie awfulness. I did have a single \\"Oh ^&%^&*!\\" moment in the film as it did a great job of showing what happens when a person plummets from rather high up. This however is the work of some nice special effects and camera work than any acting talent or emotive reponse to the characters.    From there it all goes downhill thanks to the Wolf pack. Yes my friends, a pack of wolves are the would-be force of nature here. By the end of the film though, you're outwardly routing for the wolves since none of the main characters are likeable and it's hilarious that these wolves are not only acting completely outside everything that is known about the species but also because the film shows them to be smarter than the three kids trapped on the lift, right up to the point where you expect them to stand on their hind legs and get in a huddle in an attempt to figure out how to climb up to the lift. It's that bad.    The two worst/best scenes in the movie are when the wolves eat their first human and he's screaming \\"Don't let her watch! Don't let her watch!\\" Now, not only is the acting here so poorly that you have to laugh at the reactions and intonations of all three characters, but since any predatory species goes for the neck as soon as the prey is downed, what little suspension of disbelief this film has is utterly lost here. The other awesome scene is where another main character fends off a wolf with a ski pole and then snowboards down the mountain with the pack of wolves in hot pursuit. Now this is hilariously bad on so many levels, I don't know where to begin. Whether it's the wolves waiting for him to climb down the lift (which is not something they do. These are wolves, not buzzards, and it just adds to the \\"smartest wolves ever\\" motif that runs through the film, but even after one of the wolves is stabbed and they can tell this human will put up a fight, they chase after him on his snowboard. All I could think about was, \\"Can your heart withstand the bone-chilling terror of the SNOWBOARD CHASE SCENE?\\" Of course later on you get to see who wins between the wolves and the other main male character and well...the end result is hilarious and impossible there as well.    Finally the movie has the wolves totally not interested in the female character. Sexist wolves? They only like male meat? It's so hilariously bad to see their reaction to her that once again, it's hard not to laugh. Frozen is just such a bad film on so many levels, but at least it's bad in a campy, corny, cheesy sort of way that lets you laugh at it from beginning to end. The comedy is unintentional, but oh my, is it there.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I've never written a review on a book before but I just finished reading \\"ROOM\\" and it was great! Highly recommend! Couldn't put it down!

B0009N11MY|1.0|Norma Bellini's opera is one of my favorites, but this version is to chill any Roman centurion.        The soloists are average to poor and still suffering from the horrible sound pickup. When the scene is transported to the top or bottom of the stage no one hears anything.        The voices are metal, not that soloists sing well, but the adjustment of the microphones becomes.        The Adalgisa is interpreted by Raffaela Angeletti, thinks the girl is a doll, always makes static movements. Does she entered the wrong opera, Les Contes thought it was D'Hoffmann?        Maria Dragoni has no concept of scenic interpretation. His standard is pure boredom.        Scenarios are a cliche, and beats the old Roman columns and staircases.        The orchestra seems a school band.        The chorus has a sound horroroza.          Two and a half hours of pure torture.        Friends, her shelf. This deserves the gallows in perpetuity.       Portuguese:    Norma de Bellini é uma das minhas óperas preferidas, mas essa versão é de arrepiar qualquer centurião romano.       Os solistas são medianos para ruins e ainda sofrem com a horrível captação de som. Quando a cena se transporta para o alto ou o fundo do palco ninguém escuta nada.       As vozes são metálicas, não que os solistas cantem assim, mas a regulagem dos microfones as transforma.       A Adalgisa é interpretada por Raffaela Angeletti, a moça pensa que é uma boneca, faz sempre movimentos estáticos. Será que ela entrou na ópera errada, pensou que era Les Contes D'Hoffmann?       Maria Dragoni não tem a menor noção de interpretação cênica. Sua Norma é pura monotonia.       Os cenários são um clichê, as velhas e batidas colunas e escadarias romanas.        A Orquestra parece uma banda escolar.       O coro tem uma sonoridade horroroza.         Duas horas e meia de pura tortura.       Amigos, prateleira nela. Essa merece as galés perpétuas.
0439023513|5.0|In Collins's grand tradition, she again delivers in this third book of the Hunger Games.  By book three I was so attached to the characters and their fates.  Great story, but I found myself saying, \\"Oh, no, she (author) didn't go there!!\\"  Twists and turns and lots of action.  Does not disappoint.
B001CRRAE4|5.0|What we have here is a difficult to accept premise, some nasty plot holes, aggressive fast cut editing (seriously, I would like to see an action scene go UNCUT for at least 30 seconds), a couple of effects that seem to have suffered heavily from the budget chopping block (namely where John Preston does a back flip off a motorcycle)...    ...and loads and loads of AWESOME. Awesome acting, awesome short drama/character sketches, awesome action... just awesome.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|Not a vampire movie so much as a meditation on the sexual & emotional confusions & frustrations of early adolescence. The development of the relationship between Oscar & Eli is subtle yet richly detailed & complex, the depiction of the gulf between children & adults (parents, teachers, guardians, strangers) in the story feels true in every aspect, & Eli's character is much more ambiguous than Amazon's thumbnail review would lead you to think. Simply one of the finest movies about children I have ever seen.
B001CDZZI6|2.0|I bought this book after reading excellent Now Discover your strengths in order to take the test at [...]  I didn't received the access code when I bought this hm \\"book\\" but after contacting Amazon help service they provided me with one.  So I took the test and since I'm not a native English speaker I've encountered words that I don't know in several questions.   Because each question is time limited to 20 seconds those questions remained unanswered or I was guessing what they really mean.   The end result is 5 strengths (Competition,Focus, Futuristic,Strategic,Significance) that doesn't fit me very well being.  I would probably call theme minor themes. On the other hand some strengths that I'm sure that I have like Activator and Adaptability didn't even appear.  I could understand that author would want to make some more money by offering to people to see all their strengths but   limiting the test to only one taking  is a pure ripoff. The only value of this hm \\"book\\" is that all 34 strengths are described so you could read  them yourself and try to honestly see which one really fit your talents.
B0038QGXHW|4.0|... it is unfortunate that this album, as several of his recordings, include his humming along with the music. From an artistic perspective, I understand quite well why he might do so, but as a (paying) member of his audience, I'd prefer to do without. I wonder if he is aware of the number of fans who find this behavior takes away from the enjoyment and quality of the music.
B003MZ0I84|3.0|I enjoyed listening to this disk, but was somehow expecting more from these guys.    It's not as memorable as the previous release.    Melodies are weaker, arrangements are very straightforward pop - no Maroon sizzle here.    I think they need to go back to their previous producer.
B0044KI7B6|5.0|I absolutely loved the season 6 premiere, and can't wait for the next episode which airs tonight. I love how Dean and Sam almost \\"swapped roles\\" in a way. They did fantastic, and I adore this show.
B000P2A256|5.0|I very much enjoyed listening to this CD - unique take on modern pop music - strong melodies, tongue-in-cheek lyrics, lots of power and good performance overall.  It was on my playlist for few weeks.
0061478784|4.0|First, let me my inform you, you being whomever is reading this, that I originally watched the movie before reading the book. I watched Howl's Moving Castle film a countless number of times so I finally picked up the book. I realize now that my confusion about the different portals in the castle was cut drastically because the movie visually explained it so well. When I recommended it to my mother she said she was completely confused about the different portals. I tried to explain and didn't explain it well. I decided it was time for her to the watch the movie. While we were watching the movie I saw a light bulb go on above her head. Therefore, I recommend watching the movie first.     I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book and read it through in under 24 hours although, I kind of had to push thorough the first pages, which was mostly expository writing.     These two different medias in which the story is published can both stand alone because both have individual merit. I recommend both, but you don't have to and I can guarantee you will enjoy both either individually or together.
B003TXKSWK|2.0|I was not impressed with this collection of songs.  If this was intended to be more of some political statement then there are better means of getting the message out.    Music-wise, I felt these songs were uninspired, arrangements monotonous, bridges not powerful enough.  This is not John Legend I was hoping to hear.    Music skills, per se, are indeed exemplary - the band is tight and well put together.
B0010EV45K|4.0|I downloaded this album yesterday and right off the bat was blown away with a Brian Eno connection. In 1992 Eno came out with the album NerveNet and a maxi single Ali Click. There are a number of remixes of Ali Click on this single Beirut Hilton Mix in particular. The first song on Voyager 34 and  Beirut Hilton Mix share the same vocal, The narrator who speaks \\"Brian has been amusing his friends by chewing on some plastic light bulbs. I am very new (mere weeks) to Porcupine tree but a huge Eno fan and was not expecting to find this kind of connection but it is a fun one. Very trippy album and totally different from my first PT listen Live in Athens. Enjoying them both.[[ASIN:B000002M36 Ali Click]]
0345505387|2.0|Sorry, but someone didn't have a clue, or just didn't care.    It's so sad.. so many of the things we associated with the characters are missing!   Here's my list:  1. Jaime is not tall enough in many scenes  2. Claire's curls.... how sad!    3. Where is Claire's light brown hair?  4.  Gellis looks brunette in several pictures and  5.  her striking green eyes are hardly noticeable   6.  Lagohaire - why is her dress short?  Was it ok to see a women's ankles in that time period?  I doubt it!         It was really funny to see Jaime's face in the first pages - it looked like they actually cut and paste it for another scene.    I bet there are hundreds of fans out there who could have done a better job on this artwork.     Ok, but I still love DG and can't wait for the next book!
B003ZK58WM|5.0|I am halfway through this book and am thoroughly enjoying it. It is a good book.  I agree with others - it is not fair to rate the book itself based on the price of the e-book.
0060899220|3.0|While there were fascinating tales of the 'inside' of the restaurant business, the endless references to Bourdain's drinking, carousing, and drugging were overdone.  The book would have read much better if it was about 1/3 shorter with the repeats of his escapades eliminated.  Didn't add much to the kitchen stories.    I found myself ready to quit reading about 2/3 of the way through, but slogged on just to see if it got any better.  It didn't!
B002P5XXR0|5.0|Now that I've got the Avatar soundtrack CD, the magic of the movie goes with me everywhere. Jack Horner's thrilling, haunting, melodic score has become part of my soul. Of course, the music varies from the lovely \\"Bioluminescence of the Night\\" to the loud and percussive \\"War\\" so not all the tracks hit my mood every time. That's just a fact of life with soundtracks. But it always evokes the memory of the story and sets it to replaying in my head. And always the unforgettable main theme, \\"I See You,\\" threads through nearly every track. That's why I rarely skip a selection. If you've seen the movie, you need the music CD!
B00000F14B|5.0|This heart-warming, endearing comedy-romance with all of its classical, familiar songs, beautiful costumes, entertaining instrumental pieces, is an unforgettable production. The acting is also above-average, not only by Robert Preston and Shirley Jones, but also by Paul Ford, Hermione Gingold, Susan Luckey, Buddy Hackett, and Ron Howard. (No one in 1962 would have thought that Howard would one day become an outstanding movie producer.)Although almost all the naive, stubborn people of River City, Iowa, believe that Professor Harold Hill (and this is a pseudonym)(Preston) once did play in a band with \\"76 Trombones\\", Marian, \\"Madame Librarian\\" does justly believe that he is bogus; she, unlike the other people of River City, does not believe that he wants to start a boys' band. But because of all his shenanigans, which normally do not make for happy consequences, after he is exposed the people of River City are gradually drawn together and the community is now a happy one; and yes, Marian does become strongly taken with \\"Professor Harold Hill\\". This is, again, such a wonderfully entertaining movie that it would make anyone choke up and/or cry.
B003UERZ88|2.0|Don't get me wrong, I like sports but I dont want my metal mixed with it.  It comes off weird.  This cd just isnt that great.  I have been listening to metal for a long, long time and I was expecting more here.  His first Halford cd was by far the best.  Crucible was good, but the production sucked.  I didn't buy Winter Songs because that music doesnt float my boat.  This one is more melodic than heavy thats for sure.  There are no songs that have a heavy guitar riff really.  I was waiting for a fast one, or a heavy mid-paced rocker but there really arent any.  I bought Nostradamus from Priest but I could not get into it at all.  There are some good songs on it but for the most part, I just wasn't interested in it.  This cd is fair.  Its not horrible by any means, its just ok.
B002ZG98VE|1.0|I love Ridley Scott.  He sold out.  When Maid Marion is required to don armor and fight in a huge battle, we have gone off the  politically correct waterfall.  Do not waste your time or money.  Buy the original with Erroyl Flynn and be done with it.  Shame on Scott.
B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|Have watched it many times over the years, and it gets better each time. Like all great movies, there are subtleties that you miss the first, second, or fifth time, subtleties of imagery, intonation, and meaning.  Dracula starts out as a pure man, filled with love and loyalty. He dutifully goes off to war, wading in blood and death, only to find that his loss of innocence is rewarded by the Church's betrayal.  After giving so much, he comes home wanting love and happiness, but this is now denied him. Of course his grief turns to bitter rage. Wouldn't yours? He then wreaks havoc on the world for centuries, and perhaps it deserves it. The Victorian England he encounters is itself corrupt and banal. But, he has caught a glimpse of something he thought lost forever, and he wants so desperately for it to be real, to be true. He wants to be what he once was--happy, in love, and a good man. He wants that, not power, and the dreams he shares with Mina are of a beautiful land. \\"I have crossed oceans of time for you\\" is, for me, the most poignant line in the whole movie. (Think about how you would feel in his position, after centuries of incalculable grief and loneliness.)  But, he is betrayed by \\"civilization\\" once again, by the petty phobias and prejudices of small, unworthy men.     An element I haven't seen mentioned in other reviews (I may simply have missed it) is the role of his human followers--his rough mountain peasants, who transport him and look after him as needed. I believe they're doing it now out of fear, but out of loyalty.     It's not a movie about a monster, but a movie about the hypocrisy of trivial men, the Church, and of God.
B00005V9QJ|1.0|I listened to most of this once. It's awful.  There are two minutes of audience cheering for most songs, then the drummer starts the beat for 90 seconds.  Then they play the song, and it's recorded in an acoustically-poor arena. I bought this because all the great Sade songs are on it. But these versions aren't good. Get 'Best of Sade'. It's much better.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|First off, all the people complaining that it was boring or had too much dialog and not enough action are true examples of the what the mainstream consumer has become, boring with no imagination. There's nothing wrong with saying \\"I wanted more Iron Man suit action\\", but making it a reason to dis character development and enjoying actor's performances over countless CGI battles shows a less than dedicated comic era group of people. These naysayers also seem to be the ones who's hormones got into a cluster over Scarlett Johansson, who was the biggest letdown in the movie. Yes, she's got nice boobs and she looks good in the outfit, but she is in no way The Black Widow, not even close. They took years of a strong female Marvel character with a rich history and background and reduced her to a SHIELD 'chick'. Don did a solid job of taking Howard's place as Rhodey, pretty much with the exception of Johansson all the actors did a great job and Johansson's failure was not her fault, she was poorly cast. There are plenty of comic book roles for a good looking blond with an American accent. Rockwell made a great Hammer and it was nice to see the sequel not fall into the trap other superhero movie sequels have by sticking in way too many villains. There were solid characters and Tony dealing with the fallout of being Iron Man. For those that actually read or have read comics, they will understand that Marvel heroes generally have a weakness, drawback, or some very hard personal history to deal with that takes its tole. I hope there is a 3rd Iron Man in the works and if not this will still make a nice lead into Iron Man becoming an Avenger.    I have been guilty in the past of just tanking a movie after watching it once because I went into it expecting something else. The only thing I can recommend is if you didn't like this movie, watch it again. Watch the bonus disk so you can get a sense of what the director and actors were trying to do with the movie and it might make moresense to you or at least make you respect how much effort went into it enough to give it another shot.
B0041T4ML4|5.0|What a vision the author has. This is his second book, and at least as good as the first.
006085880X|4.0|At times this book was very troubling to read.  It was very thought provoking and insightful and gave you a better understanding about teen suicide.  I believe every parent and teenager should read this book and discuss it.  Hopefully, it would bring about a dialogue between parent and child and possibly prevent future teen suicides. Jodi Picoult delved right into the family dynamics of the main characters and you could sympathize with both families and the trials and tribulations that they had to deal with and would continue to deal with their whole lifes.  I would highly recommend this book.
B001ED7C58|5.0|It's is the best cd I have ever had. Everyone of the songs I love. Couldn't have gotten better.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|I set this watch by the atomic clock (time.gov) when I received it on Monday. Today is Friday and the watch is accurate to the second. The funny thing is that I've been checking it's accuracy every day and one day it was four or five seconds fast and the next day it was four or five seconds slow. Today it's all evened out. I consider this fine....we are talking just a couple of SECONDS variation each day after all, and over several days perfect accuracy (at least so far). I consider this excellent for a mechanical watch.     I am very happy with this watch. I'm not crazy about the band but it's okay. The watch itself looks nice. I am thinking about buying a leather band for it now that I know it keeps such good time.
B000001EUP|4.0|This album is straight out the top drawer. German metal doesn't get better than this.
B002LMOCJ0|5.0|Kevin Smith racked up a huge amount of debt when he endeavored to make this film at the convenience store he worked at. However, the movie ended up becoming a hit at all of the film festivals, and for good reason.
0802130208|4.0|Book was priced right and came in good reading shape.  Hard to believe it was up for pulitzer.   Sarcasm hard to take for extended periods. not my style. However good character developments and descriptions. Well written if you can see over the depressing characters and lives.
B0025KW29U|5.0|Where to start...Fun, Smart, Clever, Sad. I have always loved Joss' work, but when I ran across Dr. Horrible I knew I had found a true gem!.  The actors from Neil to Felicia to Nathan, they all bring so much to this musical.  Speaking of which I am not a big fan of musicals but this is hands down one of the best I have seen.  They may not have the stage voices of Phantom of the Opera, but they make up for it in style and content.  If you haven't seen or picked this up yet. Don't wait. You will not be disappointed. $10 for a 40 minute Blu_Ray you say? It's worth it. Trust me and all the other reviewers.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|What fun this show is!  I did not start watching until Season 2, and boy was I hooked!  I had to buy Season 1 to see what I missed and it did not disappoint!  I watched the whole set (only 3 dics) in one afternoon!  Love it, Love it, Love it!!!  It was great from the first episode.  Can't wait to buy Season2 so I can watch it over and over.....
B00005ASHM|3.0|Pet Sounds is way over hyped.  #1 album of all time?  I don't think so.  Yes, Brian Wilson is a genius, but this album only has three really high quality songs on it: \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\", \\"Sloop John B\\", and \\"God Only Knows.\\"   The rest of the songs (besides the two instrumentals) are rather bland and un-melodic.  Its parts are greater than the sum.       I came to this conclusion after listening to the Pet Sounds Box Set where each song is broken down to acappella vocal tracks and instrumental tracks.  This is where Brian Wilson's genius can be really appreciated.  This would have been an excellent instrumental album with the exquisite musicianship and execution of each song.  It also allows the listener to spot glaringly to the repetitiousness of many of the songs melodies and  lyrical phrasings.  The vocal harmonies, as always, are outstanding.  Put it all together however, and the songs are just somewhat average and bland with the exception of the three listed above.    Greatest album of all time?  I don't think so.  Same can be said for the Beatles Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.  With the exception of a few songs, they are both rather bland albums.  In the case of Pet Sounds, you can get the best songs on a greatest hits album.
B0044XRIMW|5.0|I first saw the Sound of Music as a child, and fell in love with the music, the photography, and Charmain Carr.  Over the last 45 years, I have watched this beloved film again and again, never ceasing to be moved by Wise's cinematic masterpiece.  On thinking about the \\"composition\\" of this movie, I realize it has everything; beautiful settings, heart-stirring music, lovable characters, danger, and romance.  And, ultimately, the triumph of the human spirit.  I am sure that many would argue with my title of this review, but in my humble opinion, there is no way to spend a more entertaining, uplifting three hours than The Sound of Music.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Beautifully animated and wonderful story. Enjoyed watching this with my daughter very much and was plesantly surprised at how great it was.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|I realize Ken Follett has put many hours of research into his latest, \\"Fall of Giant\\" but why such a high price for the Kindle version?  I can buy the hard cover book at Costco for less. In the Kindle version, we are not getting paper nor a hard back so the cost should be more reasonable.  I call the $19 price, \\"sucking the ebook readers!\\"
0312600844|5.0|Simply worth reading.  A very impressive synthesis and exploration of our anxieties, triumphs, sympathies, conflicts, and redemptions.     It achieves a tone of rightful pathos of what it is to have been alive in the latter part of this century and to continue to be alive today.       In addition to an engaging study of characters, the book's plot twists also occasion one to consider how we are soaked in sensationalism and whether we still believe in our humanity and in forgiveness.
0375826742|1.0|I've never posted a review before but I felt so strongly about how bad this book was, that I had just had to do it. I am an avid reader, I read all kinds of genre's and styles. I enjoyed the first two books well enough, they were a fun read with a compelling curiosity of how he would dethrone the king. They were creative and kept you going.     Brisingr is none of these things. It's boring, pointless and stupid. It's obvious that the author has not planned the plot of these novels out at all, he just makes it up as he goes. Instead of a big show down with an evil dragon riding king and a consummation of a budding relationship with a hot female elf, we get page after page of dwarf politics and boring filler.     Mr. Paolini, if you are reading this, I will NOT be reading your final book and you owe me $18.95.
B000OCZD5G|5.0|The Road Warrior is a Mel Gibson cult classic.  Now I'm hearing that the first film \\"Mad Max\\" will be soon to be released on Blu-Ray.  I'm not too particularly fond of \\"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome\\" but if they ever released a Mad Max three disc Box Set, I'd probably buy it.<br /><br />I could watch \\"The Road Warrior\\" with my buddies while enjoying a few beers, or I can just have it on in the background because there are many scenes that a just stand alone awesome as just eye-candy on film.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray High Definition release is mastered very well.  On a huge screen, it's just like being there.  This movie is one film that should be used as a demonstration disc for selling big screen TV's, because it WILL sell big screen TV's.  Movies like this is what High Definition is all about.
B003MZ0I84|5.0|This albumn is pretty much all true to form. From start to finish, it's very listenable, there is probably only one song that I don't care for too much and even then, I can listen to it. Like the previous albumn It Won't Be Soon Before Long evoked Funk and 70's soul themes, this one evokes 80's and rock power ballad themes, to me anyway. If you're a Maroon 5 fan, you'll love this albumn, if not, then.... The songs are pretty emotionally charged and some like How (especially), Give A Little More, Runaway, Don't Know Nothing and Get Back In My Life while great great listens, were somewhat painful for me at first even though at least 2 are upbeat, what with just recently coming off of a breakup, but at the same time they were very enjoyable and with the added benefit of being able to wallow in misery (no pun intended) through music and then move on, I have them on heavy rotation on my Zune, home stereo and in my car. All in all a pretty good listen.
B0000060NH|4.0|It is hard to believe now that Marvin Gaye was only four years ahead of hits like \\"Heard It Through The Grapevine,\\" when he came out with Trouble Man in 1973.<br /><br />Maybe I should not be. In 2010 four years is an album waiting period. But in 1973, it was a musical life time. Almost enough said: I won't bore you with the hackneyed rock history lesson of how social change in America impacted Motown. By now those stories are as standard as the blues.<br /><br />What is not standard is this score. Gaye creates a whole new sound for himself: most of the work here is instrumental: a echoing jazz, talk as sky scrapers--even when Gaye does sing, which he does on the title track in falseto, his voice is mixed back to the point of being ghostly.<br /><br />Gayes' use of the studio is amazing here: he has the same sense of chords and melody, but contextually, you would hardly know it was Marvin. That spooky, ethereal hue he puts on this album is indelible, almost the opposite of the up front production he put on his 1960s singles.<br /><br />Whatever. Get this genius ghost soul jazz
630471193X|4.0|I listed a review, why it is not shown I don't how.  However, I stated that I love the movie, yes it was delivered in a reasonable amount of time.  However, I wasn't impressed with the yellow sticker stating Eric Clapton's video \\"Change the World\\" was included, WHICH WAS NOT! Which makes me this, this was a dubbed copy.
B003UERZ88|5.0|I love Halford, love J.P. more, but this was classic Halford vocals, lyrics.  Not as strong as Crucible or Resurrection but still better then anybody else.  Truly the one and only Metal God and the reason why PRIEST RULES. Only complaint is he needs to put them out faster.

0786852550|4.0|I found this to be a very enjoyable book. Of course any young adult book about magic published in the last decade or so is going to get compared to Harry Potter. As much as I love the Harry Potter series, in a way I felt 'The Amulet of Samarkand' was a more realistic description of a magical society. In Harry Potter the magicians are hidden away from the vast bulk of society, and in fact much of the difference between the good guys and the bad guys in JK Rowling's series is their attitude towards 'muggles'. The good guys view them with affection and by and large keep themselves separate, while the bad guys view muggles with contempt and seek to dominate. Well in 'The Amulet of Samarkand' there are no good guys and magicians rule the commoners and view them with contempt. Our heroes, 12 year old magician Nathaniel and the 5,000 year old djinn Bartimaeus are both not entirely sympathetic. Nathaniel is arrogant and petulant as well as intelligent and brave, while Bartimaeus is ruthless and amoral as well as resourceful and hilarious. It all makes for a very enjoyable story. Looking forward to the sequels.
B000002B2T|5.0|Thisi is one of favourite album of all the time. I suggest everybody to listen to it.
B000F7CMRM|2.0|\\"Syriana\\" overwhelms the viewer with corrupt plots in all sectors.  It frames how oil dictates America's cow-towing to the Middle East.  Oil companies, Saudi field workers from Pakistan, Sheiks and Princes, CIA Operatives all entwine and play a high stakes game of oil contracts.  There are political games, terrorist plots and greedy corrupt people at all intersections of this complex epic.  I suspect to understand it all you need to watch it about three or four times.<br /><br />George Clooney plays a CIA operative who delivers two missiles to his his contact in Iran - but one disappears.  The CIA has many problems and does not focus on this at first.  The heir to an Emirate gives an oil contract to China that cuts out a US company.  This leads to the immediate firing of their immigrant field workers.  A merger with a small firm that landed a Kazakhstani oil contract causes the US Department of Justice to suspect a bribe was involved.  The oil company's law firm finds a scapegoat.  Then when a plot to kill the Emir-apparent fails, they send in Agent Bob Barnes (George Clooney) who figures out he has been used as a pawn in their game.  Matt Damon plays an American economist/trader, Bryan Woodman, who uses the death of his young son to get lucrative contracts and advise the Saudi heir that the CIA wants to kill.  All corruption (and everybody is corrupt) leads to oil.<br /><br />The movie is too overwhelming and complex to enjoy and you end up tuning out parts that don't make any sense until late in the story.  The movie is full of great stars, George Clooney, Matt Damon, Chris Cooper, Christopher Plummer, Jeffrey Wright, William Hurt and Akbar Kurtha (plays the young Saudi Prince).
0316067938|1.0|I can not rate this item because I never received it. I have been an Amazon customer for many years and have bought several items and this is the first one that I have not received. I am not impressed with this seller, stay far away from them!!!
0618918248|4.0|The cover of my book had a tear in it. But otherwise it was fine.
0525951652|5.0|I'm aghast that this is being overrun with people complaining about the price. I do not think this is the venue for that. It brought the rating of the work of a great writer down to two stars, making me wonder what was wrong with his novel. And while there were some actual reviews, it was mostly complaints about the price that brought the rating down.     It's just ridiculous to see price complaints in an area where the reviews should be about the content of the novel and not the price. Especially since the rating affects all versions of the book, print included.    Guess I will have to go elsewhere for accurate reviews about the book's content.
B002GU45YO|4.0|This is a great album for anyone who is looking for a smooth voice, and great instrumentation.  I am not normally a fan of R&B, however upon hearing the catchy, \\"Just ain't gonna work out\\"  I was hooked and thought I would give it a try.  I love it, you will too!
0375826742|4.0|A fantastic world created by this young writer, inspired for sure in master Tolkien, but, never the less for those who loves a good and a imaginative adventure/fantastic tale, this novel gives us something to dream on.
0312600844|3.0|Throughout much of Franzen's FREEDOM, I questioned whether Oprah and the others who gave the book rave reviews had actually read the book.<br /><br />There is one especially scatological episode that made me want to stop reading and never hear the name Jonathan Franzen again. What is it about bathroom anecdotes, especially the number two variety, that fascinates popular writers such as Stephen King, Garrison Keillor and now Franzen?<br /><br />I also had problems figuring out what Franzen was trying to say. Was it something about suburban liberals being spoiled? Did it have something to do with the idealized mate not being all that great in reality? There's also some political stuff going on. One of the main characters, Walter Berglund, works for a Texas oil man who wants him to create a West Virginia reserve for the Cerulean Warbler, but he must agree to let the man's company take all the oil, coal, and gas out before the land is restored, ruining the pristine wilderness in the process. Walter himself is not sure that's such a great idea. Walter's wife, Patty, is an ex-basketball University of Minnesota basketball star, who is depressed because she thinks she may have married the wrong man. Richard Katz is an avant-garde musician who was Walter's roommate in college. Walter also has an East Indian assistant who makes it difficult for him to remain true to Patty.<br /><br />Walter and Patty also have two kids, one of whom, Joey, goes to work for a conservative think tank. He has a chance to make a bundle if he's willing to spend his girlfriend Connie's inheritance on obsolete truck parts to be used in Iraq. Patty thinks Connie is trailer park all the way, and Joey seems to be using Connie.<br /><br />What saved the day for me was the absolutely perfect ending. It has to do with a cat named Bobby who is a killing machine (According to Walter, 350 million songbirds are murdered by domestic cats every year in the United State) and an evangelical woman who will remind you of Michelle Bachmann, until she meets Patty.she meets Patty.
B002P7UCMC|5.0|I don't know why this band isn't as well known here as they are in other parts of the world. I was a little worried when the first single came out not that it was bad song, it just wasn't what I expected. This album is great, it seems to be less electronic than there other albums. The guitar is heavy and Till the singer goes all out with the vocals. This album will take you by the balls and not never let go. The songs all differ so it doesn't get old fast. They even have a song that could have been a Depeche mode song. They also have two softer songs (soft for rammstein) the album also have songs that will force you to violently bang your head. This album has something for everyone. if your a fan of any Rammstein song in the past I highly recommend this album. I've been listening to this album since I bought it almost a year ago. Where does it stand with their other albums? its not as much eletronica as their first two albums. It is just about as heavy as their mutter album, and its just about as epic as reise reise. What are you waiting for buy this album!
B001AU8ZLK|2.0|Coldplay!  Ah, good memories. When I was younger, I remember listening to the fantastic Parachutes non stop. I still love that album.   A Rush Of Blood To The Head was good, and it was more of the same, but I never really had that same attachment to it.  X&Y just bored me.  So, when we reach the highly lauded Viva La Vida, where do I stand with it?  Holy crap, I think it sucks so bad.  As a huge Radiohead and Muse fan (those are my 2 favorite bands),I'm disappointed where Coldplay has gone. Coldplay is one of those 3 highly lauded melancholy bands, if y'know what I mean. But this album just made me want to rip my ears out. The first thing that stood out like a sore thumb were the awful, annoying lyrics. \\"Those who are dead, there not dead, there just livin' in my head\\"?! What?!   I understand they were trying to go for imagery, but god, it sucks really bad. One of the other annoying parts is the synthesized Church Organ used in practically EVERY song.   Granted, the whole album isn't awful, but I hate it. Lost! is really the only track that stands out for me. The rest is mopey crap.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|Saw this book in a store for well below the $19.99 Kindle price...Called the Library and I am on the wait list...I won't pay one cent to read this book!  Greed is not an option!  How disappointing...
0312570740|5.0|I read Metal Men and was left with a lot of unknowns.  I have always been a big fan of Marc Rich and admired his work ethic.  What an amazing story!
B002ZMZBD2|5.0|If you like this album then try the band \\"3 daft monkeys\\". A band from the south coast of England. Same sort of sound but BETTER!!!
0345505387|2.0|As a longtime fan of both Diana Gabaldon and graphic novels, I have to say I'm very disappointed with this fusion of both. As many other reviewers have pointed out, the transitions are choppy (Murtagh and Jamie are pursued by redcoats; suddenly they are above said redcoats on a cliff. How did they get away? I felt like my book was missing a page or two).<br /><br />While graphic novels tend to exaggerate womens' breast size, I found Claire's bosom to be beyond the point of ridiculousness, even for a graphic novel. It was extremely distracting throughout.<br /><br />I could expound on these, but others have done it better and more thoroughly. I just wanted to express my disappointment.
0385342047|3.0|I didn't mind this book. If you are familiar with the Shopholic books then you know what to suspect. Yes, the series has gotten worse and more ridiulous as each new book pops up, but I still enjoy them. I liked that Minnie was a part of the book, but she was not the main part of the plot because then I don't think I would have been able to handle it. She is a terror, but at times endearing. Anyways, this was pretty good HOWEVER the Author has KILLED lukes character. He was always my favorite part about this series. He was so hard working but also so sweet. He wasn't perfect, but that is what I loved about him. I admit I have a crush on him. AND NOW HE IS RUINED. He went from an actual developed character to a two dimensional piece of nothing. I don't even know how to explain it, but he just wasn't the Luke that I love. He was just stiff (not he himself, but the way his dialouge was written and his action). I don't know. I still recomend that you read this book, but if you skip it...ehhhh not missing much.
B003A03RRU|5.0|At Borders you can buy Vol. 1 & 2 of this collection in paperback for about 6 bucks a piece. They're fun, fast reads for when I don't feel like getting into a longer novel. Now that I have a Kindle I wanted the e-book version of them and this collection doesn't disappoint.     This version has all the books and I've noticed none of the formatting/grammar errors in this collection that some of the other Sherlock Holmes collections seem to have. And the price is great! You can't beat $0.99!    Great purchase!
B001F0VHEM|5.0|After seeing Pink perform the song on the awards, I fell in love with her!  This is one of the best cd's I've heard in a long time....If you like the song Glitter in the Air, you will enjoy this CD. Way to go Pink!!! Another awesome buy from Amazon.
0767802470|5.0|I had heard about this movie my whole life never really paying attention to it until just randomly deciding to pick it up at Amazon since I always had a soft spot for Naval pictures going back to childhood (perhaps that is why I later joined the Navy and did four years active on an amphibious assault troop carrier). I bought the 209 minute version of the film and did not regret it or get bored watching it. It keeps you drawn in the entire time and very importantly it presents a different angle that you typically do not see in war movies anymore and that is it is presented from the side of the enemy (our enemy) which may set  the audience up for a dilemma. How do you empathize with the Nazi sailors? There is actually very little politics in the movie. Most of the focus is on their human survival and how war takes it's toll. You forget who these guys represent.      Though I served on a ship, I still felt like I was seeing a near mirror image of these submariners experiences in my own. Well heck, when you translate Das Boot it comes out \\"The Boat\\". Up until this, I would have said Run Silent, Run Deep was number one over The Hunt for Red October, Crimson Tide, and Ice Station Zebra but if you have to have only one of these, get this one.     Oh yeah, if you don't dig reading subtitles or don't know German, the same actors went back and dubbed their own lines in English which is pretty rare.
B000T05R8Q|4.0|On the surface, this three-disc release of the Pink Floyd's first album and early singles is worth it for the mono mix of \\"Piper,\\" Syd Barrett's notebook, the relatively rare \\"Apples and Oranges\\" single, and selected variant versions of certain classic tracks.  For those of us who have long-since \\"tattooed our brains\\" with the stereo mix of the album in question, the mono mix (overseen by the band themselves, as opposed to an EMI functionary) offers some neat surprises: Rick Wright's organ is a more of a towering presence on tracks like \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" and \\"The Scarecrow,\\" and the sound effects on tracks like \\"Lucifer Sam,\\" \\"Flaming,\\" \\"Pow R. Toc H.,\\" and \\"Bike\\" are more heightened. Syd Barrett's notebook, consisting of collages, designs, and texts from 1965, reveals a precocious visual talent, in addition to a lyrical and musical one: more or less a talented art student's notebook from the period, which is nice to pore over while listening to the music in question.  It's just too bad that the last page of the notebook had to be censored, allegedly for being obscene (i.e., a collage featuring a woman's naked breast).    Ultimately, the inclusion of Syd Barrett's notebook begs the question as to why more unreleased recordings prior to \\"Piper\\" could not have been included as bonus tracks, since they repeatedly turn up as bootleg fodder and since it would have been beneficial to have the official take on things here.  Still, the inclusion of variant versions of \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" and \\"Matilda Mother\\" with different lyrics is appreciated.  As for \\"Apples and Oranges\\" (sort of a poor-man's response to the Beatles' \\"Drive My Car\\"), it is nice to have both the mono and stereo mixes of this song--my preference here being the stereo mix, since the duck quacks towards the end are more noticeable.  And given that the \\"Apples and Oranges\\" c/w \\"Paint Box\\" single post-dates \\"Piper,\\" and is arguably more concurrent with the \\"Saucerful of Secrets\\" album, perhaps it would have been better to include these tracks with a deluxe \\"40th Anniversary\\" mono/stereo version of \\"Saucer\\" instead (sadly, this opportunity has been missed), along with the unreleased \\"Vegetable Man\\" c/w \\"Scream Thy Last Scream\\" single.  This would have left room for the inclusion of earlier tracks (e.g., \\"Lucy Leave,\\" the Pink Floyd Sound's documented freak-outs from 1966-early 1967, \\"Emily\\" with Syd's extra bar at the end, etc.) for the edition under consideration here--earlier tracks that would have built a more effective bridge between Syd's 1965 notebook, the \\"Arnold Layne\\" and \\"See Emily Play\\" singles, and the \\"Piper\\" album proper.    Finally, another thing that brings this edition down a peg is that it claims to be a limited release.  I bought it within a week or two of its first availability, in late 2007; and now, three years later, it is still in print and readily available.  In short, this does not strike me as being much of a \\"limited edition.\\"
030726999X|5.0|What a satisfying way to end the trilogy!  I really don't have a lot to say about this one, other than the fact that if you haven't read this series, you should really get to it!  The only difficulty I really had was keeping the names of places and some of the characters straight (a lot of words begin with S for some reason...)<br /><br />At the end of The Girl Who Played with Fire Lisbeth is in a seriously bad condition.  Obviously she was going to come through it in some way, or this book wouldn't have been written.  There is some tension still between Zalachenko and Lisbeth in the book, we learn more about the mysterious group that \\"took care\\" of Zalachenko, and a few people that need to be punished definitely get their just desserts.<br /><br />As to whether or not Lisbeth is released from her guardianship, if she goes to jail for assault or murder, and if she and Mikael Blomkvist get together, you're just going to have to read it!  And yes, this was another one of those books where I should have been sleeping, but didn't!<br /><br />Notes on the Cover:<br /><br />I love that they have the same type of lettering on the cover, and that each cover had a distinct color.  This one is silver with a couple of wasps (hornets? Bees? Not my area of expertise...) on it, and little gray, white and red hexagons.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Much more exciting and detailed than the first year --- this second year came together beautifully, and, once in a while, it did stick to Terry Goodkind's twists and turns --- but basically these 2 seasons are their own great story.  Goodkind's epic fantasy is a whole other adventure!!!  I sincerely hope there will be a third season...
0470601787|5.0|This book is going to transform my seminars on project management, which I've been teaching for 30 years. I've asked all of my instructors to read it and use it in their classes. Yesterday I asked the people in my class to draw on a single flipchart page what they had learned in the past two days and to then explain their drawing to the rest of us. It was beautiful! The drawings ranged from crude/clumsy cartoon figures to fairly sophisticated, yet all of them captured the essence of the class. I used to do this years ago, and drifted away from it. Now it will be a part of every class. In fact, I am now calling my seminars Visual Seminars(TM) to stress that this approach makes use of the visual methods taught in David's book.
B00316DDWW|5.0|Karnivool are a relatively new band out of Perth, Australia, and anyone interested in the cutting edge of rock and heavy music should pay attention to them. These guys blend elements of rock, metal, progressive, alternative, and psychedelic rock in ways I've never heard before. They employ ambitious musicianship to create such moods and ambiance that you can't help being sucked into their new album Sound Awake like it was a black hole.    A brief sampling of a song or two is not enough to truly experience Karnivool's Sound Awake. This is more than a simple collection of 11 songs, it is a genuine listening experience, a journey into sound. The first track, 'Simple Boy', fools you with a few quiet notes of a synthesizer before giving way to a drum roll and heavy bass guitar riff. Just when you think the bass overtones are about to cause your speakers to implode, contrast is brought in with melodic lead guitar and vocals. Karnivool's vocalist, Ian Kenny, brings the final, perfect ingredient to the musical formula, tugging your mind along the path of their progressive rock music.    'Sound Awake' is an appropriate title. Open to interpretation, but accurately capturing the crux of this album however you read it. This band takes full advantage of a huge spectrum of sound through their music. Progressive rock is the backbone, the primary element consistent in each track. The sound of the the music can range from heavy riffs, to smooth melodies, but always building layer upon layer of sound. The result is an epic masterpiece of heavy, progressive rock.    Each successive track continues to introduce new combinations of their ambitiously conceived sound. I'm alternately reminded of Tool or Pink Floyd or Dream Theater throughout the course of hearing this album. Ultimately, in the end, it is all Karnivool. By the time the last track, 'Change', finally draws to a close with a cacophony of drums lingering after the other instruments have silenced, I conclude that Karnivool arein a class of their own. Young, new masters of this genre they could redefine in the years to come.    Here are some highlights from Sound Awake:  -Simple Boy (The opening track. Keeps growing on me each time I hear it. Heavy, melodic, mind-blowing!)  -New Day (My personal favorite. Easy to see why they named their recent US tour after this song. Simply epic!)  -Set Fire to the Hive (A harder-edged number. Rough-edged tones, with some aggressive emotion in the vocal delivery)  -Umbra  -All I Know (Another favorite of mine. Like so many other songs on this album, I like it more every time I hear it!)  -Deadman (Another perfect example of their progressive, thematic song-craft. An epic piece of music that clocks in at 12 minutes.)
0553805371|2.0|This is an interesting book as far as the history of physics goes but it is lacking in what the actual title, The Grand Design, advertises.  The authors try very hard to make a case for no god but stop short when it comes to what or who designed the universe.  They speak as though it's the \\"laws of nuclear physics\\" that are responsible for the origin of the universe and evertying that evolved thereafter.  They speak as though these laws are absolute facts not invented by humans.<br /><br />In the beginning of the book they do admit that science develops models from observations, concepts, theories and research which may lead to laws and that the laws may change when \\"better\\" ones come around. In some places they even suggest that science doesn't have all the answers. But later on in the book they try to convince the reader that physics has come up with \\"facts\\" to support their theory of the orgin of the universe.  They have hubris assumptons as to what is known today as facts.  The authors, like many people, have forgotten about the Myth of Progress - the assumption that we know better than those who came before us.<br /><br />Chapter 4 is rather boring after going over and over again why small particles don't behave like larger ones.  After ten times explaining why quantum particles don't go through slits the same way larger particles do I almost threw in the towel as well as the book. However, I did like the illustrations of the spiral shell of the chambered nautilus that preceded each chapter.  Therefore, I gave the book two stars.<br /><br />The authors say, \\"--in the Game of Life your reality depends on the model you employ.\\"  Evidently the authors have chosen the physics model.

B003XMUFGQ|5.0|I'm going to spare you the in depth review of Clapton by Eric Clapton.  Others have done an admirable job on that front and I don't think I can add anything at this point.  Suffice it to say that if you're a fan of Eric Clapton and if you like the jazzy, bluesy sound that he is famous for, then you'll like this set of songs.  Comprising new material as well as a few covers, this is perfect Sunday morning coffee and newspaper music.  Clapton's guitar playing skills haven't grown dim with his advancing age.  In fact, he may be at the all- time top of his game.<br /><br />My favorite three tracks, River Runs Deep; Can't Hold Out Much Longer; Hard Times Blues.<br /><br />My only complaint is the long intervals in between Clapton's issuing a new CD and that is a weak complaint at that.<br /><br />Get this one!  You'll be glad you did.<br /><br />I highly recommend.
0312370830|4.0|This a well written, and engrossing story of little known historical atrocities endured by the french.  The narrator is adept with her characters and emotional threads.  I have spent the better part of a whole day in this book and the backstory it springs from.  I will pass this story on to friends with my highest reccomendations!  -Cindy-
1405853115|5.0|Amazon has a great service (through its sellers). I got my book less than a week before ordered. The books is new and does not have any mark. Comparing amazon and other websites, this is cheaper and faster. The only thing I did not like was that I was subscribed to get my orders for free (no shipping) for a year, however when I order this book, I had to pay for shipment. It only comes to my mind that the seller is a nonparticipating company for this promotion.
B00169XU8I|5.0|This is a great CD, I love all of the stuff she puts out but in a long time this is one of the CD's that I actually like the majority of the songs. Great album!!
006097625X|5.0|Scott McCloud is to images what Umberto Eco is to words and Bertrand Russell to mathematics. It's ultimate pundit, theorist, and philosopher.<br /><br />No graphic artist should ignore his books.
0131988425|5.0|The book was shipped and delivered very fast. It was in great condition, brand new. It was out of all my expectations. Thank you, AMAZON.com! I absolutely love this book!
B0044430H8|5.0|What an enjoyable soundtrack!  It features quite a lot of piano and richly layered electronic and organic noise.  There is a lot of great, upbeat, toe-tapping music here as well as ambient music for relaxing to.  A few tracks are even chiptune inspired (8-bit video game sounds).  As of this writing, I have not seen the movie but the soundtrack is wonderful on its own.    Those of you familiar with Nine Inch Nails will recognize two tracks as remixes or new versions of songs from Ghosts - they are NOT duplicate tracks.  Also, the inclusion of \\"Hall of the Mountain King\\" was funny - I didn't expect to hear this one!
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|It is really good, small and compact. Feels like it is made of quality. It protects my Plantronics bluetooth very well
B001FB5634|4.0|A bleak setting with a depressing tale which is exactly how it was supposed to be if you read the novel.  Small roles by Charlize Theron and Robert Duvall.  As the father struggles to get his son to the southern coast (where it will be safer) they come across a number of conflicts and we see that the father has lost a great deal of his humanity which is balanced (at times) by his son.  I was going to give this picture a lower rating until I realized that it's supposed to be a downer.  It kept me engaged enough for a couple of hours and I had originally planned to watch this one over three of four days.  Fairly true to the novel which I read last year.  After seeing this movie you might be grateful for the life that you have even if there are problems in it.  WHEN WATCHED: 10/01/2010; MY GRADE: B plus (C plus to B minus if you don't get this is supposed to be a downer tale).
1587613379|5.0|I found this book to provide many many wonderful insights into the nature of free relationships. I have always felt constrained by the rigid definitions placed on relationships (\\"Lover\\" \\"Girlfriend\\" \\"Best friend\\" \\"Mom\\") and the inherent tension and jealousy they cause when we don't have the tools or the courage to stand up for our need to share affection in many ways with many people. We are a rainbow people being shoved into a black and white world and sometimes we need tools and affirmation to be our rainbow selves. This book is helping my friends and I chill out, relax, learn about ourselves and love more.   Another beautiful resource in the quest for a more loving and authentic world!
B001NFNFIK|4.0|Based on the crime novels of James Lee Burke.  Tale follows a P.I. in the bayous of Louisiana shortly after Katrina laid waste to the area.  The rich atmosphere is truly evoked.  I particularly enjoyed the sparring and history between the characters played by Tommy Lee Jones and John Goodman.  The tale was overly introspective and may turn some people off according to those who read the books.  Personally, I found it to be a nice change from the typical movies tossed out by Hollywood.  Interesting visit from Confederate General Hood.  Ned Beatty has a supporting role in this film.  I haven't read the novels but I plan to look them up really soon. WHEN WATCHED: MAY 2010; MY GRADE: B (B minus if you aren't partial to the style or setting).
B003VANOFY|1.0|I have had the G930 for a number of weeks and for the price i can not say i am satisfied.    The unit is well built and the sound quality is acceptable. However, the unit constantly turns itself off when idle.    That means if you are using the microphone and stop talking the unit will after a minute or two, turn off.    I have been in contact with logitech about this and apparently they don't really care as    \\"Thank you for contacting the Logitech Customer Care Team.    We are glad to assist you with your concern.    It is not actually a designed fault. This is a special feature of the product to conserve battery.

B002GHHHKQ|5.0|\\"Contact\\" is probably my husband's favorite movie.  He started watching it immediately when it arrived and has watched it since then.     It's a classic.  As an amateur astronomer, my husband can find a few errors in it, but I think he just doesn't care.  The movie is that good.
B003XMUFGQ|3.0|Typical Eric Clapton recording. Great song choices, wonderful ensemble playing by five-star guests, and his lovely voice all to the fore. But his greatest gift - an astonishing, earthmoving voice on the electric guitar when the mood strikes him - is used like a tease. And for the most part the guitar playing here is, frankly, not particularly special. Glad I heard it elsewhere (and didn't buy it).
B0036EH3WU|5.0|awesome box set! i decided to order through amazon when my ABC.com order was cancelled due to a lack of inventory (even though I ordered it the first day it became available back in May 2010).  I ordered from Amazon two days after the set came out and received it within 3 days.  Amazing!!
0764169742|5.0|Botanical Portraits with Colored Pencils is a very generous volume of information . The practical information detailing the kinds of pencils, colors and paper is excellent and the number of color plates with excellent detail inform visually. Ann Swan breaks down the elements of botanical illustration with valuable tutorials on such things as tendril drawing and the rendering of spines and prickles. There is a chapter on techniques and various ways to employ them. Ann Swan seems to really want to foster her fellow botanical enthusiasts and I am grateful.I recommend this book without reservation.
B000K7VHQ4|1.0|One minute I had some hard-earned dosh in my hands, the next: poof...!<br />Things I remember about this piece of codswallop: Jessica Biel, beards, sleep, Jessica Biel, ear aches, nausea, disbelief, Jessica Biel.<br />I intend to get my money back from Norton if its the last thing I do!<br />Maybe I should call Jessica Biel instead.
B00000ILBK|5.0|Why is Insurrection good Star Trek? Because it comes off like an expanded episode from the TV show. Let us not forget that Star Trek at its base is a group of TV series, begun in 1966 and continued capably by NextGen. If a Star Trek movie doesn't fulfill the feeling you got from enjoying the TV series, in my mind it isn't doing its job. Are there some flaws in logic or plotting in this movie? Yes. Even good writers are not perfect. \\"Wrath of Khan\\" is regarded by many as the best of all Star Trek films, yet the list of logic errors, factual errors, and silly mistakes in TWOK will go on far longer than a similar list from Insurrection.<br /><br />So what makes it good? First, the cinematography and effects are eye-popping. Second, the characters do the right things. They don't diverge from the characters we know from the TV shows. Third, you get to know and like the Baku culture, and care what happens to them. Fourth, you even feel sorry for the surviving bad guys at the end ... not easy to do. Fifth, the Enterprise crew doesn't make rookie mistakes that belied their competence in the TV series (as happens in both TWOK and Generations, for example).<br /><br />Now I'll admit that I'm (mostly) easy to please when it comes to Star Trek. I was 9 years old in 1966 when it premiered on NBC, and watched the very first show broadcast. Like all the original fans, I lived through a 12 year stretch when there was not only no live action Star Trek, but no certain indication there ever would be again! Those of us with that perspective are more likely to be grateful for all the Star Trek we can get, and approach new shows and movies without preconceptions. So when I see a Star Trek movie that seems like an entertaining extended TV episode, I'm quite happy with it. I've watched Insurrection many times, and enjoyed it every time, for the reasons above. This cast was outstanding in their roles, and there are a finite number of those performances. I certainly won't criticize this one.
B000QQFKYE|1.0|There are some people in a large room who are talking about something. Then I pressed 'stop.'   I do love Lynch - but not this much!
B000A7DVR2|5.0|There have been a few movies over time which have portrayed private eye characters that are quirky, or losers, or both ... but this one takes that concept out into left field and then keeps going into some completely unexplored area way beyond left field.<br /><br />Jeff Bridges (\\"the Dude\\") and John Goodman are particularly brilliant in their roles of bowling buddies setting out to unsnarl a kidnapping fiasco. Goodman is well known for his comic talents, but everyone in this movie puts forth a full effort in displaying their craft exercised to the fullest. I laughed out loud at more lines and circumstances in \\"The Big Lebowski\\" than I have in a long time during a movie.<br /><br />There are bizarre circumstances, absurd conversations, acid flashbacks, and entire characters that you may decide aren't really there. I anticipated the \\"punch line\\" in the strange little funeral that Jeff and John held for their friend, and still had a tummy holding laughing jag when it arrived. I had somehow missed this movie for quite some time, so I am certainly glad I finally watched it. If you are a fan of offbeat, irreverent comedies and haven't caught this yet, this time is nigh!<br /><br />Warning, after this movie you may experience strange sub-conscious desires to drink white russians and go bowling.
B000LC55F2|1.0|One minute I was sitting uncomfortably in a cinema throwing up at the thought of having to sit all the way through 'The Illusionist' and suddenly, poof! What seemed like an eternity, but was probably a few months, I had been magically transported in time and found myself watching the same movie but with different actors.   Then I threw up all over again.   Tripe!
0316098337|5.0|I'll remember this for a very long time. As a father of two young boys, it rings true, and makes me value my family even more.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|A sad documentary on so many levels; presumably it will appeal mostly to those who want to know about the why's of Vietnam, but the lessons in here are for all generations at war.   The key to docos such as these is to allow the subject to talk - there, they reveal.   Much maligned but mostly forgotten - McNamara repents at an age.   Disquieting.
B0001XAPX8|5.0|This is not a small little tiny film to spend a Saturday evening in peace and quite with no mental work at all. This film deserves a lot of attention. It speaks of crucial existential questions.<br /><br />First of all, the racial identity of a person. A man who is lily white in a black family, of course mother, father, brother and sister are all mixed-bloods, all with different shades of grey, but he is white and he does not want to be the victim of any racial prejudice. So he pretends he is white and to more or less cover all fields, terrains and domains he decides to make himself Jewish. As a Jew he can go through society being slightly special, different, awkward about the racial divide without being accused of being black.<br /><br />Till one day when he is accused of being a racist because he wondered in his class if a couple of students who had never attended one single session were \\"spooks.\\" Unluckily, though unknown of him, the said students were black and they signed a complaint against the professor accusing him of being a racist, and he was fired because of course he kept it perfectly secret that he himself was black. In fact if he had told these narrow-minded bureaucrats in his college he was black and had been hiding that fact for more than fifty years, he would have been accused of being a racist at the higher second level, at the level where you try to evade your own racial origin.<br /><br />But this crisis late in his life brings his wife down, who had never known he was black. She just dies because the stress of this situation gets to her heart. Then he is alone and that's how he gets in touch with a writer he had taught and who was not too far away, living like a recluse in some cabin in the mountains. He wants that writer to write the story of his life. The point is that the writer does not really want to do it but the younger recluse writer and the older fired professor fall in friendship, in fact they fall in love, the strange love between an older man and a younger man, a mental and spiritual love that gives some energy back to the older man who starts a new life late in his existence, and that gives some new motivation to the younger writer who finds a new inspiration for a further volume in his creative writing experience. Just exploring this friendship would be a great dimension for this film. And it sure is.<br /><br />But this film goes one step further and the older man meets a younger woman who is attracted by older men because at the age of fourteen she got into some \\"accident\\" with some step father or who cares whom, and she hit the road. The older man, thanks to Viagra, and we are told about the blue pill quite a few times, though it is absolutely not important, falls in love with this woman and this time heftily at the sexual level of love, if sex is part of love. There is nothing that can in anyway fit in on one hand that older intellectual who has run away from his racial origin and his ethnic identity, and on the other hand this younger woman who is running away from an older husband who is absolutely dangerous because he is psychologically at least unstable if not frankly berserk, delirious, insane and murderous. And yet love there is though both, the older intellectual man and the younger hardly educated woman, will be caused to die in a road accident by the ex-husband one night on a frozen road in the mountains. A perfect crime because no one found anything linking his truck to the car that jumped into a frozen lake and went through the ice.<br /><br />This should lead many people to wondering what love, sexual or not, between an older person and a younger person, I mean with at least a thirty year difference, can mean, can be. No one but the concerned people can answer that question: it is an exhilarating and unique experience that only concerns a few people. Most of the time grandfathers/mothers and mothers/fathers experience that kind of love with their grandchildren or their own children. But some come cross this experience in life. Most of the time, around such couples (sexual or not, that is not the point), people will say that the older person is just living in phantasms and fantasies while the younger person is taking advantage of the older man. It may be so now and then, but it is not always so.<br /><br />The film shows one element that is crucial. Such an encounter will bring the older person to opening the drawers of his/her long ago life and bring into light traumas that had been kept secret, hidden away, and unluckily must I say, this older person will be accused of imagining things and being delusional, except by his/her partner in this relation. I personally think that an older person who has kept some \\"secret\\" deep in his/her memory hidden away from the world around is actually looking for another person who could help him/her open the box, recapture the past, bring it out of the shadow in which it had been locked and imprisoned for at times forty or fifty years. The younger person is the intercessor, the go-between and enables the older person to cope with the suffering that has to come along with this re-discovery. That film is a marvelous exploration of that cruel and painful past of the older lily-white black person who has covered his track by declaring himself Jewish.<br /><br />Just enjoy this film and take a walk on memory lane and check if deep in your unconscious mind and memory there is not something that should be brought back up. If you can't do it by yourself look for the one who is going to be your catalyzer and share what you find with that other person. It will produce some unimaginable friendship or love and sharing that past will be one thousand times more pleasurable than plain sex that is so often mixed up with love, although it is nothing but the cherry on top of the pastry, the star at the top of the Christmas tree, the wrapping of some birthday present, the frosting of any homemade cake.<br /><br />What can we do if some people are obsessed by taking the cherry, caressing the star, disrobing the present or licking their fingers clean after dipping them in the frosting? Don't forget you can always know an elephant has been in your fridge when you see the footprints it left in the butter.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUience in life.

B003ELMR9E|2.0|Nolan's movies divide this reviewer! On the one hand there's the   brilliance of 'Memento,' the magnificence of 'Inception' and on the other the super-silliness of 'The Prestige.' He treads the fine line between rubbish and greatness.   This inferior re-working of a 'foreign' film (too hard for us poor english speaking countries to watch with subtitles I guess)falls into the category of the former.   Williams over plays as if his life depends on his next pay cheque.   I'm only pleased none of my pay went to purchasing the dvd.   Boring and predictable.
0553805371|3.0|Frankly I was not impressed with this book. I suppose I expected it to be a continuation or \\"advance\\" over Hawking's wonderful BRIEF HISTORY, yet it seems mostly to be the same book over again.     The quest for answers to ultimate questions remains as valid an issue as ever. And the authors are clearly competent to handle the questions. Yet the book lacks the nuts-and-bolts style of Brian Greene or David Lindley. Without suggesting that M Theory math be included, I suggest that the complexity of everything from the anthropic principle to life in the galaxy to TOE cannot be effectively conveyed without ANY basic math at all.    Thus, as a beginning point for those who have never considered such things (and dislike math), I DO recommend it as a fine introduction. For anyone else, it is likely to feel empty--in the sense of being a dumbing down.    Steve Angelique

0307454541|5.0|Stieg Larsson has managed to do something that I feel has been missing from a good book for some time, he's put together a complex story with well-defined characters that revolves around... an original plot! It's refreshing and exciting. The story really works well as layer after intriguing layer is peeled away to reveal truths, red-herrings, suspense and satisfaction.<br /><br />Even more refreshing is the blatant disregard for a current trend in literature: the flowery prose. You won't find any of that in this book, just eye-on-the-ball storytelling of a fantastic tale that lets the characters and their actions speak for themselves.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Vies for the most original and thrilling TV series   ever made.   Has there ever been such a likeable serial killer?   Jennifer Carpenter makes swearing so incredibly sexy!   Watch this above all else. 10 Stars.
030745455X|5.0|Stieg Larsson follows up to his bestseller with a sequel worthy of its praise. Continuing in his writing style of direct prose, this story holds its own as a new original plot emerges that is equal in quality to his first book, but a fantastic contrast to the smaller first story as many new characters are introduced.<br /><br />The complexity of the tale teeters on the brink of confusion, but always managers to stay focused on Lisbeth Salander. This is her story, and it's a very satisfying one to read.
B002ZG980U|4.0|Loved this film!   A careful balance between rubbish and sheer wonderment,   this film delivers on almost every level (pun intended).   Film of the year, almost.
0547366205|5.0|The 1st 10 times or so I read this book, I cried. It is so sweet. The illustrations are adorable. The story is simple yet, but combined with the illustrations, intelligent and rich. I got this book as a present and now it is one I will buy for other families.

B00337KM2S|2.0|Nothing offensive here; a charming little number, well acted and nice to look at.   But at some point I was sort of wondering why I was watching this film.   Directing by numbers.
B003L77TZI|1.0|Just more manufactured, no talent garbage.  Anyone who actually likes the two singles off this turd will be very shocked that the rest of the album DOES NOT sound like those two singles....it's a lot worse.  Just auto tuned, prissy, poorly written, tasteless, garbage that stands as another prime example of whats wrong with music.

I also bought 'the Geni within' which I liked so much that I purchased the cd's too. If you are considering buying the power, save your money and get the geni within instead.

B002JVWR9U|5.0|I love this show! I am very into Twilight and now vampires, but this show is much more than I expected. I missed the first season on TV but decided to give it a try when it came out n DVD. The show has great dialogue, good story lines and very likable (or hate worthy) characters. I enjoy the love triangle, but the show has a lot more stories going on that keep it very entertaining. The season starts out a little slow but picks up by the 3rd episode.  A great show to watch and continue watching on the CW. If you like vampires, Twilight or just a unique drama with some nice eye candy than this is a great show to check out!

Betty wakes up and discovers she has stolen the name off the left breast of a waitress and falls in love with a mysterious woman who has just fallen down a mountain after a car crash. After comparing breast sizes, both woman fall into a deep sleep. Betty is woken by her lover muttering the words \\"Sinatra\\" over and over. Most male members in the audience eagerly expect this to be a precursor to further breast comparisons and maybe some decent girl on girl action but instead we are transported, with the girls, to a night club wherein a magician magically disappears and a spanish singer sings a Roy Orbison song in spanish which makes the girls very upset.   Meanwhile, a movie director visits a ranch where he meets a cowboy with a small head wearing a 10 gallon hat - or maybe he has a large head and he wears a 20 gallon hat. The cowboy can turn a light on and off at will. He tells the director that if he sees him three more times it means he is to see him four more times but not including this time.   Meanwhile, Betty is visited by her Aunt's neighbour and most film buffs in the audience spend 2 uncomfortable hours trying to work out who she used to be in real life, thereby missing the intricate sub-plots.   Meanwhile, Betty and her friend break into a house and discover a very smelly corpse who, it turns out, is actually Betty. Or maybe it isnt.   There is no white horse.
B003FSTN5C|4.0|Very good TV serie. If not, I wouldn't have bought it.    I give only here some precisions for languages useful for foreign customers like me.    Audio : English and French for all episodes.    Subtitles : English, Spanish and Portuguese.    French subtitles for episodes 1 and 2 (spin offs from NCIS East coast), and for all the extras (discs 1 and 6).    Remaining of episodes are not French subtitled, but you can listen them in French like mentionned above.
0525951652|5.0|I was waiting for this book to come out and saw that it got only 2 stars.  I was so disappointed because I usually love all of Follett's books.  Then I read the reviews and they are all about the Kindle pricing!  This is supposed to be ratings for the story NOT the pricing.  Find another way to stress your unhappiness with pricing.  This is very unfair for the book rating.
B003LFLOOW|1.0|Amazon Video on Demand is a Total Rip Off !    After purchasing a Wi Fi enabled Blu Ray Player, at the end of the purchase, I was told I was entitled to a few free movies.

B000BQ7BX2|5.0|I bought this set on the strength of several glowing reviews on Amazon (British and American). ClassicsToday and Gramophone, although I already have the complete cycle several times over: by various conductors and orchestras (Haitink, Boulez, Chailly, Solti, Sieghart, Zander, Barshai, Kubelik, Levi, Levine, Rattle, Haenchen & Neumann) and the box sets by Edo de Waart on RCA/Cobra (good, but now out of print; if it's available it's rediculously over priced), Bernstein on DGG (no further blurb needed), Emil Tabakov on Cappricio (steer well clear of this one, it's dreadful really), Inbal on Brilliant (very good in some symphonies, listless in others) and Michael Gielen on H&auml;nssler (outstanding modernist view, a bit like Boulez, but less deliberate).<br />I relish this particular set because of the wonderfully warm sound quality (listen to those very deep basses in the \\"Alles Verg&auml;ngliche\\" chorus at the end of the 8th symphony), the non-prima donna singing of most vocal soloists, the generally faster pacing (as opposed to some of Haitink's snail like tempos; except in the ninth, where Bertini's finale is very much slower than most, but to great effect), the careful attention to detail and the generally unsentimental interpretation. The booklet comes with complete texts and full details about recording dates and locations.<br />One (very) minor point of criticism is that in order to cram all the music onto just eleven CDs, the various symphonies are sometimes strangely distributed over two discs and the chronology is interrupted. But musically a very worth while asset.<br />If you're looking for a complete Mahler set, this one should certainly deserve your consideration (with Gielen's a serious competitor; better: get them both).

B00127RAJY|5.0|I feel great! This DVD really made me WANT to workout everyday (well at-least 5 days a week)...and after 30 days I do look MUCH better. I've noticed it most in my arms and chest. My abs are stronger -no 6-pack though...Oh, and my rear-view did experience a nice little lift :)     I'll probably keep doing these workouts (especially level 3) because they are short, sweet, and effective.    I'm pretty sure I need to move on to something a bit more challenging...any suggestions??
B000XTLUW0|5.0|I couldn't ask for more in a Muse DVD/CD combo.  The dvd has great filming, camera angles, and sound mixing.  It is vibrant and epic.  Wish I could have been there.

B003ITZBW2|5.0|This was pretty good, I get nervous around Batman Animated Films. Batman alone is a little... well...Boring. I need Superman and the Justice League to add some spice.  This was spicy, I loved it. The Red Hood was kick'N ass and take'N names. And WOW talk about a twist. I adore the Joker, he cracks me up. Of all the villains in both the DC and Marvel Universe he is my favorite. He always has the best lines.  So anyway, this movie is about Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder (Jason). N-E Way, Joker got his hands on the boy (well by now he is a young man) and is going to town on him with a crowbar. Batmans comes to save the day (the question is: does he?) 5 years later this dude in a red motorcycle helmet (not really but kind of) shows up and bitch-slaps all the crime lords of Gotham. But he is not cleaning up crime, he is making them work for him. This is all part of an elaborate plot.  This movie really shows a softer side to Batman -I know I know, do we really want to see a \\"soft side\\" to the caped crusader? Yesterday I would have said HELL NO, but this soft side I liked.  He really loved Robin and in this movie it really shows.  Dont worry all you too-macho for sentiment guys out there, He is still KAPOW!! WHAM!! BAM!! BOPP'N!! BATMAN.  You get to see the Joker, Amazo, Ray Ja Ghoul (I know I spelled it wrong MY BAD) and Knight Wing. Great movie, I totally recommend it.
B003YBNRHU|5.0|This album is mature and excellent. The combination of Simmons and Johnston is undeniably great. To even think these guys could come close to \\"Stampede\\", or even - dare I say it - \\"The Captain and Me\\", is really incredible.  Hats off to all involved. Surprise comeback album of the year so far. Heart, Peter Frampton and Steve Miller have delivered the goods as well this year with fresh releases. Rock on dudes!
B003L20IHE|5.0|What a great movie, a little predictable, but not too much.  It had a happy ending, and in this case predictability was a good thing, I was hoping it would end the way it did. Charlie St cloud is a kid who seemed to have it all going for him. He loved sailing and practised it religiously. He got so good at it that he recieved a scholarship to Stanford University.  But when a car accident takes his little brothers life, Charlie's guilt and loss cripples him mentally. He now has the ability to communicate with dead, specifically is little brother who he meets everyday before sundown to play catch. This movie is a tear jerker, the love between the brothers was too much to bear. I guess it helps that Zac Efron is just so damn gorgeous you simple can't not love him. Great movie, Fabulous performance by Zac Efron as Charlie St Cloud, this is the beginning for Zac, I hope he stays away from silly movie roles and moves forward and up with dramatic parts, he is VERY good at it.
B003TML0VO|4.0|Let's all take a deep breath and cut Carlos a little slack here.  To dismiss this project with so much vitriol is a little over-the-top.  As cover albums go...Carlos walked a fine line here and succeeded.  Taking classic rock songs and making them fresh and new, while keeping them familiar, is not easy folks.  And, many of the vocalists turn in really solid performances as well.  Scott Weiland slays it on \\"Can't You Hear Me Knockin'\\" and Joe Cocker's take on \\"Little Wing\\" is nothing short of stunning. So, relax - pour yourself a little something over ice, kick back and listen to the 63 year old classic rocker himself really bring it. Or maybe, you prefer Rod Stewart's current career path instead.  I'll take the rockin' road any day...and Carlos does plenty of rocking on \\"Guitar Heaven\\".

B0043GAZYS|5.0|The weekend of August 13, 2010, saw three major studio releases for each target audience: [[ASIN:B002ZG99A4 The Expendables [Blu-ray]]] for males, [[ASIN:B00427X9WI Eat Pray Love [Blu-ray]]] for females, and \\"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\\" for kids, teens and young adults. Being a recent fan of the [[ASIN:1934964573 Scott Pilgrim's Precious Little Boxset]] series of graphic novels by Bryan Lee O'Malley, I was looking forward to the film adaptation - especially after hearing of the casting (most notably, Michael Cera) and the director Edgar Wright ([[ASIN:B0025VLEM0 Shaun of the Dead [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B002HR1W1K Hot Fuzz (Ultimate Edition) [Blu-ray]]]). I'm not the biggest fan of Wright's work; while I thought they were slightly funny films, I don't fall into the large masses who say they're the most hilarious contemporary films. Still, I like Wright's filmmaking style and I knew he'd do a great job with the material.<br /><br />There are quite a few people who believe Michael Cera acts the same in every movie and TV show he is in. And, depending on the actor, that can either be OK or extremely annoying. Cera does generally have the same acting methods, but, to me, it works for him. He has mastered the act of shy-but-hilarious, slightly neurotic geek, and I never tire of - or fail to laugh at - any role he portrays. And I'm a firm believer in that saying: if it ain't broke, don't fix it! The bottom line is: if you despise Cera then don't see this film as you'll probably only be rolling your eyes through most of it since it's his movie, and this film deserves more than that.<br /><br />I know people may laugh at the thought of a bestselling memoir geared towards women (\\"Eat Pray Love\\") being compared to a bestselling graphic novel geared towards male adolescents. But, trust me, their meanings are similar. As I stated in my review for \\"Eat Pray Love,\\" it's a story about a writer taking a quest in Italy, India and Bali to forget her problems, start anew, and experience flavor and deep contemplation only to realize that you can't run from who you are; you have to be comfortable with who you are and make peace with what's happened in your life ... the good and the bad ... whether it was your doing or someone else's. It's no big surprise spoiler that Julia Roberts' Gilbert finds love and self-respect for herself and, at the same time, makes peace with the hurtful choices she's made. Now onto Cera's Scott Pilgrim. Although it's more prevalent in the books, the viewer can also tell in the film that Pilgrim is not only a slacker financially, but also in self-respect and accountability. He's made bad, selfish choices in love and he takes the universal young generation response whenever it comes to any sort of confrontation: \\"whatever.\\" Nevertheless, I found his character much more likeable than Roberts' Gilbert.<br /><br />The film, \\"Scott Pilgrim\\" is told in a visual way that has the style format of a video game and comic book with the main character - finding himself having to fight - oops! - I mean, defeat the seven evil ex-boyfriends of his newest love interest, Ramona Flowers (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). It's all metaphor for the baggage we carry when dating someone. Not only does one deal with the issues of our significant other's romantic past (how it affects them emotionally), but you also deal with your own insecurities and vulnerability when entering into a relationship and - unless your beloved has lived in a cave and had no prior romantic relationships - how your spouse's past suitors measure up to you. It's a silly, self-destructive game we play in our love lives, but everyone does it ... especially more frequently when we're younger.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!<br />It's only when Pilgrim confronts his unresolved issues and finds self-respect that he truly wins \\"the game.\\" And the girl. We see the transformation of a somewhat judgmental guy turn into a man who can love someone for who they truly are, including their flaws.<br />SPOILER ENDS!<br /><br />As I said, the film, like its literary original, utilizes the comic panel sound effects of BAM, WHOOSH, etc., and cool, quirky characters, as well as the video game staples of coin dispersal after defeating an opponent, earning an extra life and special weapons, the countdown to continue a game, and the versus fight mode including fight combos and booming voice-over narration of \\"K.O.!\\" It's a unique, fresh style that I'm surprised hasn't been attempted before. Don't mistake me for some diehard gamer; even though I owned an original Xbox, I haven't been heavily involved with video games since the original Nintendo. Regardless, I loved the style Wright brought to the screen thanks to creator O'Malley. Second to Robert Rodriguez's film adaptation of Frank Miller's [[ASIN:1593963149 Frank Miller's Complete Sin City Library]] ([[ASIN:B001R4KQDE Sin City (Two-Disc Theatrical & Recut, Extended, and Unrated Versions) [Blu-ray]]]), this is the closest the viewer will get to a comic book come to life! And while that sounds spectacular to some; there will be others that find the movie just plain weird. It is weird. But it's a weird that's kind of great. It has wonderful meaning and great depth underneath the generation-X trappings of vegans, garage bands, cheat codes, straight edge, and \\"whatever.\\"<br /><br />I was surprised to love the book as much I do because it's made up of what I mostly dislike with comics: it resembles a manga (I despise those!), it's black-and-white, and the art is more cartoonish rather than realistic (although, it does grow on you). Since I do love it, though, it's no surprise I enjoyed the film. It was wonderful seeing all the dialogue and one-liners from the books actually being said out loud, facial expressions and all. Cera, Winstead, and Kieran Culkin stand out in the film, while the evil exes each do good at providing humor while simultaneously presenting to Scott with a different issue or concern regarding his blossoming relationship with Ramona; but Scott's not the only one who has to confront issues, Ramona also finds herself having to face Scott's baggage. The [[ASIN:B003SG810Y soundtrack]] and score are impressive and I like them but I can see how it's not as appealable to a wide audience as the [[ASIN:B002BAODSC (500) Days Of Summer-Music From The Motion Picture]] (the best track on Pilgrim's soundtrack is Metric's \\"Black Sheep,\\" which is used as a song sung by The Clash at Demonhead). The songs all work splendidly in the film - i.e., when Ramona drives off with evil ex Gideon, the Rolling Stones' \\"Under My Thumb\\" is appropriately being played on the car stereo (check out the lyrics to know just how appropriate it is). Lastly, for a story that took six books to tell, it's expected that not everything from those books will be included in the film. In most films adapted from books, it seems most screenwriters leave out the best parts and add in the most lame. Don't fret, though. Screenwriters Wright and Michael Bacall kept in all of the cool lines and important scenes central to the story of Scott and Ramona; some lines are mixed with different scenes compared to the books, but it all still works out really well and, overall, stays true to the books (i.e., in the books, Ramona fights Scott's ex, Envy, but in the film, Ramona fights one of her evil exes, Roxy). Some funny parts fall flat but it's few and far between.<br /><br />\\"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\\" is a fun, weird, fresh, innovative movie that's destined for cult status. Take that as you want, but, to this critic, I thoroughly enjoyed it!ike its literary original, utilizes the comic panel sound effects of BAM, WHOOSH, etc., and cool, quirky characters, as well as the video game staples of coin dispersal after defeating an opponent, earning an extra life and special weapons, the countdown to continue a game, and the versus fight mode including fight combos and booming voice-over narration of \\"K.O.!\\" It's a unique, fresh style that I'm surprised hasn't been attempted before.

B000002L9J|5.0|I have listened to The Smiths since the beginning and have all they released in original format...and many compilations as well.  'The Queen is Dead' is a solid choice for the novice or curious as you will not be disappointed and will desire the next album.  Radio play songs, ala KROQ and 91X, include 'Big Mouth Strikes Again' and 'There is a Light'.  My personal favorites are the title track...The Queen is Dead, Cemetery Gates,I Know It's Over, and Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others.  If you already are familiar with The Smiths...then you already know.  Little known factoid...this is Al Pacino's favorite Smiths album.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|This is the fourth \\"new\\" Doctor Who series. The \\"side kick\\" for the Doctor in this series is Donna Noble - she was the runaway bride in an earlier episode. Martha and Rose show up as well here and there too.<br /><br />I really liked this series and will miss the characters. There is a new Doctor and \\"side kick\\" in the next series. Maybe the new ones will be good as well. Of course, there are some specials/movies before we get to the new/fifth series. I am looking forward to watching those.<br /><br />Anyway, there were several excellent episodes in this series: Voyage of the Damned (a new Titanic), Fires of Pompeii (pay attention to the House God's altar), Planet of the Ood (makes you think), the Silence in the Library and Forest of the Dead (kind of scary and really well done), Midnight (well done drama), Turn Left (what if?)and the season finale, Journey's End (the last part anyway). Midnight was a very serious/strong episode and maybe my favorite in this series, but the Library and Forest episodes were very good too. The last part (at least) of the season finale was well done and tied up a lot of loose ends.<br /><br />I am glad that there are some specials before the new Doctor appears - David Tennant is a great Doctor, and I hate to see him go.<br /><br />Highly recommended!!
0307577589|4.0|As far as these books go, this is very, very good, properly twisty plot, good characters, doesn't keep you waiting too long between threads.<br /><br />Some caveats: always dangerous to keep the book going after solving the crime, which happens here re: the revenge plot against Wennerstrom. It works, but barely. (If you read Shogun, you might remember how the book pretty much ends after Mariko's death -- and there are 300 pages more to go!) And as for the original case with the same guy, that landed Blomkvist in prison, Blomqvist should have/would have seen that trap coming a mile away.<br /><br />The anti-Nazi stuff, the anti-semitic brother, is over-the-top cartoonish, impeding the narrative flow.<br /><br />And maybe having a photographic memory has more negative connotations in Sweden than it does here, but I felt that plot element odd to say the least.<br /><br />And why didn't they fire Janne Dahlman sooner? Again, I suppose things are different in Sweden.

0385751060|5.0|Its a good book. I believe it comes off as poorly written initially, but that's only because its written from an 8 year old child's perspective. I won't give anything away, but its a good picture of war.
0767827791|5.0|Hal Carter (William Holden) comes from nothing and seems to be headed towards nothing. He flunked out of college where he had a football scholarship and since then he has been drifting, hoping for somewhere to settle and make something of himself. Hal jumps off of the train in a small Midwestern town where his old college buddy Alan Benson's father owns the local grain elevator.<br /><br />Things are looking up for Hal until he catches the eye of not only Alan's girlfriend Madge Owens, but Madge's younger sister Millie and unmarried schoolteacher Rosemary. All comes to a head at the town's end of summer Labor Day Picnic. Holden, Kim Novak, Cliff Robertson, Rosalind Russell, and Susan Strasberg provide wonderful acting in this drama from a play by William Inge.
0765350386|3.0|If nothing else, Sanderson's Mistborn is fun. The action is interesting, the world is detailed, and magic system is unique and intriguing. Its main character is a teenage girl named Vin who is magically gifted, being able to not only control the emotions of others, but also able to fight with superhuman powers. She learns of her magic powers through the aid of Kelsier, another magically gifted individual, who needs Vin to overthrow the oppressive government. It's a neat, though not original, premise. The action is fast, thankfully, and there are only a few dull moments.     Mistborn, however fun it is, is not a deep read and did not hold my interest after I finished reading (that is, I did not go out and buy the next volume in the series). The characters are shallow and wherever Sanderson tries to impart depth, it comes out as melodramatic. This is partly due to my having read so much fantasy that nothing comes across as new. It is also due to Sanderson's writing: it lacks subtlety. Sanderson tells the reader exactly how each character is feeling and thinking in fine detail, so the reader does not have an opportunity to think for himself. Instead of using dialogue to clue the reader of emotions, the dialogue itself is injected with narrative that lays everything bare.     Still, Mistborn is a fun read and the best thing I can say is that it was not a waste of time.
B00006DEF9|5.0|This classic musical comedy is pure entertainment. Set in the 1920s, Singin' in the Rain shows the awkward transition from silent films to talkies.

Both my husband and I thought it was great!
B0043CO7WI|5.0|Maroon 5 has been an amazing musical group since their beginning. This is their most polished and shined album yet. Yes, some people speak of them selling out and yes I can see where some people would worry about that. They used a producer who is well known for country, pop, and 80's hair metal bands. However Mutt Lange KNOWS his way around a studio and is very successful at what he does. You can't \\"hire\\" him because he's that good. He has to seek you out. If you are a Maroon 5 fan you will love this album. It is absolutely amazing. The sound quality is perfect. The writing is brilliant. EVERY track on this album, even the \\"bonus\\" tracks are great! EVERY SINGLE ONE!!!! That is rare, very rare. If you're not a \\"music snob\\" who's not afraid to listen to anything that isn't released on a major label, you will love this record. I'm predicting that this album is going to shoot Maroon 5 to even more of a superstar status then they've ever been at. I absolutely love this band, this album, and every single track on it. To everyone who is putting it down on here or anywhere else, what are you doing even listening to this album? Obviously you are way too gifted at your understanding of the music industry and/or your ability to judge good music even. Go back to listening to crappy unsigned \\"garage bands\\" and horribly produced music that sounds terrible since you obviously know so much more than the professionals.

B000MZHW4A|5.0|Starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Connelly and Djimon Hounsou, Blood Diamond is set in Sierra Leone in 1999 amid the chaos of Africa in armed conflict. It is an action drama played against the backdrop of political turmoil. The movie is about the illegal trafficking of diamonds in Africa. Although it is tricky to make a movie on a controversial issue that is neither do-gooder nor exploitative, in this case the effort is surprisingly successful.<br /><br />Blood diamonds were so named in the 1990s to call attention to the fact that African diamonds were being smuggled out of countries at war specifically to buy more arms and kill more people.<br /><br />Weaker moments in the story are overshadowed by the film's willingness to risk disturbing an audience's sense of the world and how it is run. Blood Diamond is very much aware that these are problems beyond an easy resolution, and making a film that understands that is quite an accomplishment.<br /><br />It really is a good movie, well acted, with Africa playing a wonderful supporting role!
0307473465|4.0|I enjoyed this book and I'm glad I picked it up. It was entertaining and thought-provoking, but it did have a bit too much \\"telling\\" for my particular taste. Still, it was a very good read.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|Doubt is an excellent, engaging film with a great cast led by Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman. The film is set in 1964, in a Catholic elementary school in New York City. Streep plays the principal of the school, a very traditional and rigid nun. Hoffman plays a priest in the parish, with more progressive views. The story focuses on a conflict between these two characters. It is one of those thought-provoking films that compels you to talk about it afterward, since it allows the viewer to absorb the story based on one's own background and perspective.

Also anticipating the dvd release next month! I would recommend this to anyone.
B001CD6FKI|4.0|Based on the animated TV series, Speed Racer may start out slow, but it soon becomes engrossing. Race car driver Speed Racer (Emilie Hirsch) loves driving - it's in his blood (and it's the family business). When he makes it to the big leagues, Speed learns about the dark side of the sport that took the life of his older brother.<br /><br />Costarring Christina Ricci, John Goodman, Susan Sarandon, and Matthew Fox, Speed Racer is psychedelic fun for the whole family.
B000F8O35U|4.0|The DVD was delivered in wonderful time and looked brand new. There is one glitch during the video in which the picture freezes but for the most part the video is in great condition.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|I like to spend New Year's Eve watching my favorite movie: Casablanca. The film has all the ingredients for a terrific story - romance, intrigue, and heroism. Ingrid Bergman's luminous presence along with a top notch cast including Bogie, Claude Rains, Peter Lorrie and Paul Henreid make this movie a classic. And don't forget the song \\"As Time Goes By\\" which Arthur \\"Dooley\\" Wilson immortalized as Sam, the popular piano player of Rick's American Caf&eacute;. Casablanca, as escape for refugees and a haven for spies, exudes its own corrupt and exotic ambiance. Even if you're not a fan of classic movies, Casablanca is worth watching just to understand the cultural references that it inspired including a great Bugs Bunny parody Carrotblanca that I remember watching as a kid!
B00003CX8Y|3.0|The video got to my home in wonderful time. There were a few \\"glitches\\" with the DVD but once you get past the first 30 minutes it gets better. The movie was purchased for a three year old-she does not see the Camcorder flashing at the top of the video during the beginning thirty minutes but she does get upset when the movie freezes during one scene and must be fast forward to get past it. Time delivery was awesome but the video was not \\"like new\\".
B00003CXRM|5.0|George Clooney is a fast talking con man who cons two other chain gang convicts to escape with him in Depression-era Mississippi. The three convicts go on an episodic odyssey involving blind soothsayers, one-eyed con men, and sexy women who lure the men with their siren song. To top it off, the movie is filled with wonderful \\"old timey\\" music. Watch for homages to other movies including Cool Hand Luke, Sullivan's Travels, and even The Wizard of Oz.
B002E5N6CI|5.0|If someone were to ask me what is the greatest soul album ever made this would be my choice. As evidence I would play the second song, Hyperbolicsyllablecsesquedalymistic. If that long soulful outro on that song doesnt get you I am not certain what will. The piano playing at the end is out of this world. Then, you have the classic song Walk On By and the last track seems to go on forever and when you are listening to it you kind of hope it will. If you listen to just the samples you might think it sounds too much like Barry White, and it probably was an influence on Barry, but don't let the snippets fool you. The magic in this album is the long grooves of the songs. I think it is great music for road trips especially on a lonely highway. But, however you are going to play it I think you will enjoy it.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|Loosely based on F. Scott Fitzgerald's short story, the film tells the story of Benjamin, who lives his life in reverse. Born physically old but with the mind of a child, Benjamin continues to grow physically younger as he matures. Although not fast paced, this character driven story captured my attention and raised interesting questions about the importance of the people we meet in our life. Visually it is a beautiful film which begins in 1918 in New Orleans and moves forward to the fateful Hurricane Katrina. Brad Pitt (Benjamin) and Cate Blanchett (Daisy) bring star power to the story.
B001H9JBW6|4.0|Good movie, BBC style all over it, a little freaky, considering this could very much be possible, a little depressing too ...  Very scary and shocking ending ...  I recomend it.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|Directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Angelina Jolie, this film is based on a true, horrifying situation that took place in 1928 Los Angeles. A mother (played by Jolie), discovers that her 8-year-old son is missing. The film depicts her unrelenting drive to find her son, while battling the corruption within the Los Angeles Police Department during that period.
0689865384|3.0|This book has a lot of the framework for a good post-apocalyptic/dystopian tale.  Unfortunately, it gets too preachy in places, like the author is beating his readers over the head with his message.  Even with the repeating lessons in self-esteem/self-reliance, the characters are fleshed out just enough to keep you involved.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|In this hip dramedy (an official pick of the 2009 Sundance Film Festival), a young greeting card writer (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) falls head over heels for his new coworker, Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel). She just may be \\"The One.\\" Through the 500 days of their relationship, the viewer watches these two characters grow with each other as they learn about life, love and hope. In a series of flashbacks the story unfolds hopping from sweet, romantic and funny moments to devastatingly, desperate and sad ones - all leading to the ultimate lesson that finding one's soul mate is no easy task. An entertaining musical scene is sure to leave you smiling.
B0014VPFTA|5.0|This is one John Mayer's best albums ,I introduced my 15 year old Granddaughter to John Mayer through this album, she loved it and said I was cool  thats as good as it gets.
B00004XMV6|1.0|This is not the original uncut version that was shown in the theater and was available on tape.   It has been totally remade.  Many scenes from the original are totally omitted.  If you read the book and try to follow it in the movie you will see
0345505387|4.0|I am a crazy Gabaldon fan and got the book signed in one of her author signings. She did talk about the graphic novel and her books.   I think the capacity of a graphic novel to express the type of things her regular novels do is just plain unreasonable expectations. Graphic novels are shorter with not too much of a dialog and they don't portray as much feeling. That being said, I surely expected \\"more\\".   I knew from her blogs that the graphic novel was to be from the perspective of Murtagh and Jamie. However, I did expect that 'window' to their side of the story to be more than what was on the novel.   The graphic novel ends almost in the middle of the actual/regular book. So, 'to be continued' just didn't cut it for me. While the beautiful graphics were engaging, I didn't like the way Claire was portrayed in some of them like a bimbo on a manga book. The facial expression just didn't match the Claire we all grow to love and know.   I am sorry Diana but this Jamie looks a bit feminine! His facial expressions when drawn in different pages looked like a completely different face. It was weird. I sometimes couldn't carry the scenes over without being confused. That's saying something since the graphic novel is not that \\"complicated\\".   Overall, it was enjoyable and you can bet I'll get the next one too but I sure wish there was a bit MORE.
0393327655|3.0|It isn't surprising that many of the reviews for The End of Faith do not provide potential readers with much insight into the merits (or lack thereof) of the book in question.  Based on the reviews posted it would appear that the book is more of a catalyst for discussion about the issue of faith.  This isn't a bad thing; in fact the author's intention is clearly to spark public discourse on the issue of faith.  I will inevitably jump into the fray in this regard as well.  What I will try to do first though is offer an opinion on the book and try to help potential readers decide if this is something they might want to read.<br /><br />I've read a fair number of books on early Christianity and religion written by atheist or agnostic authors.  The books that focus on the history of our monotheistic religions tend to be the most objective and the most interesting in terms of learning about the early days of these religions.  Books like The End of Faith are a different breed.  The authors are generally making social commentary.  These types of books tend to attract people who already share the view of the author (to use an ironic comparison: these authors inevitably preach to the choir) or those who are already diametrically opposed to the author's view who read the book (or not) for the sole purpose of writing a scathing review.  Interestingly, most of these books are written as if specifically addressing the people in the middle (that is, religious moderates).<br /><br />In reality, I don't think many religious moderates are likely to read or enjoy a book like this.  Most religious moderates are only occasional readers of their own religious texts and, in my opinion, unlikely to seek out books debating the merits of religion.  Generally speaking, I think most religious moderates are content in their own vague beliefs and are disinclined to apply a great deal of thought as to whether or not their religious convictions are valid.  So while the book is written, in a sense, for them - I don't think it's likely to appeal.  Harris is just too aggressive in presenting his point of view and uses turns of phrase that are likely to turn off any moderate.  Obviously, deeply religious people are not going to be convinced to abandon their faith by any of the arguments presented and should they choose to read the book is likely only so that they can express their outrage in a review.<br /><br />So, I think this is a book that will pretty much only appeal to atheists.  Even then, not all atheists are going to be enamored by it.  I think Harris has two valid points that he raises in this book.  Are these points sufficient to support a whole book though?  I'm inclined to think - no.  Not really.  There's just not enough here to sustain the page count in The End of Faith.  As a result Harris rambles on, gets much too heavy handed in places and even comes across as hypocritical at times.  I found Harris' \\"Letter to a Christian Nation\\" much more focused and effective.  I'm the choir, but I can only give this book 3 stars.<br /><br />Now, like everyone else, I do want to expound on two key messages in the book.  The first is that the taboos around criticizing religion need to be removed.  Religion does not belong in the same category as race, sex, and sexual orientation.  Religion is a belief system - it's an opinion.  That's all.  People's religion should be treated the same as their political affiliation. You have a right to an opinion as to the existence of God in the same manner that you have a right to an opinion about health care spending.  And I should have the right to be critical of it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, to criticize someone's religion is viewed as intolerant, as if one were criticizing someone's race or sex.  This is a problem.  We need to protect a person's right to their religion, we shouldn't discriminate - but we should have every right to say that we disagree with it and frankly that we oppose it, without being viewed as intolerant.<br /><br />The second point that I think Harris makes in his book that is worth emphasizing is that those who use the words in these religious texts to harm others, be it through warfare, terrorism, persecution, or the stripping away of civil rights, are not misinterpreting their ancient books.  These books may contain the golden rule and periodic references to respecting `the people of the book' but they also contain frequent, unambiguous references to killing those who commit minor offenses and in particular for those attempting to lead believers astray from their god.  The Quran in particular contains repeated references to conquering, subjugating, and exterminating infidels and promises rewards after death to those who die fighting for their god.  The single passage that instructs believers not to destroy themselves is countered by repeated references to the glory of dying while fighting for god.  It is a common misconception that these religions are not violent or intolerant and that those who use these texts to promote violence and intolerance are `extremists' distorting the true nature of their religion.  The reality is that these are ancient religions established in a far less enlightened time that promote murder, homophobia, subjugation of women, and genocide.  These texts are not being misinterpreted by extremists - it is that religious moderates are choosing to ignore the parts of their religious texts that are not palatable to modern living.<br /><br />In closing I would like to say that I think of religion in much the same way I regard fairies and smoking.  I don't believe fairies exist but I remain open-minded.  If provided with evidence to suggest that fairies actually do exist, I would change my position depending on how persuasive the new information is.  In the absence of evidence, particularly in light of the extraordinary nature of the claim, I am not a believer in fairies.  I don't smoke and I'm opposed to smoking but I support your right to smoke as much and as often as you want, so long it doesn't interfere with a non-smokers right not to breathe your smoke.I think Harris makes in his book that is worth emphasizing is that those who use the words in these religious texts to harm others, be it through warfare, terrorism, persecution, or the stripping away of civil rights, are not misinterpreting their ancient books.

0525951652|5.0|Does anyone stop to think how long it takes for a brillant author to write such a novel?  Come on you guys, if at this point in society we are not willing to give credit to a creator where it is due, what have we got to look forward to in the future of literary brillance?
B003ZK58WM|1.0|I will not pay more for the Kindle version of a book than its hardcover counterpart. I love Ken Follett's books and I very much look forward to reading this one once its price falls below $12.

0525951652|5.0|I understand that there is frustration over the Kindle price versus the actual hardcover price, but people have got to stop basing their reviews solely on that.

B00362FO0K|5.0|I never liked MJ,never bought his records,CD's, thought he was 100% guilty of all charges.    But for some reason I went to see this movie. I was blown away!! From the dancer auditions at the beginning, the overwhelmed and crying winners of a world-wide search, to seeing them mastering the difficult performances and the joyous looks on their faces. From very talented Kenny Ortega's stage direction and visions to the extremely classy and grown-up renditions of those visions. What I thought would be a modern thuggy, rappish, gangster-like show, was clean, classy and happy. I'm 65, I'd have PAID to see this show!    Then there was Michael himself. Instead of the self-mutilated, adrogynous, over-drugged bi-racial\\"creature\\" that he had become, I saw an extraordinarily talented artist with more vision than even Ortega. If the day had ever come when Michael could not perform, he'd have had a super back-up career as a stage director. It was fascinating to witness the artist doing it again and again until he had it perfect. Also with the constant gum chewing I will speculate that MJ was indeed on amphetamine during the day to the extent the only way \\"down\\" at night was a needle and anesthesia in the jugular. He basically went down the Judy Garland road which only dead ends.     Therefore I was forced to break MJ into 2 people: the good one and the other one. I fell in love with the good one, the artist, the creator of some terrific stick-in-your-head songs, dancer and visioner. I have watched this movie at least 14 times and I tear up at the beauty of most of the songs and acts.    I saw a cartoon in the paper after his death: Heaven and Hell flipping for his soul,   \\"Your call.\\" Don't know where he ended up, but I'm sure the Good Michael went to where he can look down and be very pleased with this excellent movie that the multi-talented Ortega directed.    Sorry you didn't value your kids and life over your career, Michael, but I understand. You WERE your career. You had noother identity. I cried also for the young dancers who worked so hard and saw only part of their dream realized. A great and beautiful movie! Buy it!!
B002ZG97V0|4.0|I am an avid fan of the Guardians of Ga'Hoole book series and have read all 17 books about these owls. This movie is something I'd imagine for a long time and when I saw previews I immedietly beganing binge reading to complete the series in a little under two weeks.<br />The movie was amazing! I went in 3-D and feel that it was well worth it. It was one of the fullest 3-D films I'd ever seen with things not only popping out but sinking away. The lanscapes were totally gorgeous and the owls simply marvelous. (Even if I think Twilight looks silly that is pretty much what a Great Gray Owl looks like.)<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br />How does the movie compare the books? Well, for one thing it covers 'three' books. Mostly book 1 and an adapted version of book 3. Book 2, The Journey, is covered very quickly.<br />The villians of the novels were treated interestingly, combining groups of villians and splitting individual villians into two characters. However, this is handled so deftly as to be completely natural and it really works for this film.<br />The settings. Nailed it. That's really all that needs to be said.<br />The 'Band'. Awesome, I mentioned earlier Twilight looks silly, that is really the only thing working against the Band, you get a sense of the comraderie that builds in the books.<br />Other Ga'Hoolian Owls. This is where the movie falls short. Otulissa has no real part in the movie, this is sad because she really does have a wonderful personality once it gets fully developed. Ezylryb, one of my favorites in the book, I don't know what happened here. It should work, I think once again he suffers from too little screen time. You never gets to see the quirks of his personality. While Barran and Boron were handled well this can't be said for many of the other Ga'Hoolians. Pity.<br />Last but not least, the un-owly stuff. The owls are violent having large scale wars. Anyone who complains that the movie is violent probably would hate the books. The books have a heavy bit of fighting. Blacksmithing, who cares that owls can't really smith? It is important to realize that this is set in a post human world and owls can write too. While it is true that an owl isn't really built to forge steel one should never lose sight of the fact that this is fiction. Aand possibly my favorite part of the books, colliering. The idea of an owl flying through a forest fire is simply breathtaking and the movie delivered. Sequences where Soren was flying through fire were among some of the most beautiful I'd ever seen in a movie.ithing, who cares that owls can't really smith?

0553805371|5.0|This is a well written short book about the some of the current thoughts around the theory of everything.  This book is written with little, if any, mathmatical formula.  However, it did make me go back and look up some of the math and logic behind part of the information presented.  I found it to be one of the best written books, I have read, at this level in many a year.  Where many authors tend to get off on a tangent with a subject, they seem to have a very good balance in the presentation of the history and subject matter.  I personally would have liked a bit more on the current M theory discussion.  However, I highly recommend this book to people intersted in science of high school and above.  I have already given my copy to our local high school library as a gift.
B003YBNRHU|5.0|Fans of The Doobie Brothers will certainly want to grab a copy of their new album, \\"World Gone Crazy\\", as soon as they can.  The Brothers are at their eclectic best again with a variety of songs that offer something for every musical taste.  The album is produced by Ted Templeman, the man who was responsible for the great Doobie albums from the decade of the '70s. He hasn't lost his touch and his involvement in the production in the album is evident.  Templeman makes everyone sound great on the album and has produced a quality of sound that is light, clear, and stereophonically superior.  On this album, the emphasis is on singing and playing, with less from the horn section that has been part of the more recent Doobie live albums.  Another nod to their work from the '70s.  These guys are great musicians and are a joy to listen to.<br /><br />Lead singers, Tom Johnston and Pat Simmons, haven't lost a step and share the vocals throughout the album.  Both singers are in fine form and sound terrific.  The addition of Michael McDonald on harmony on the cut, \\"Don't Say Goodbye\\" and Willie Nelson, the co-writer and performer on \\"I Know We Won\\" are great touches.  Marc Russo on sax and Guy Allison on keyboards both have their moments to shine on the album.<br /><br />The album has 13 great cuts (if you get the version with the 2 bonus cuts), but in this reviewer's humble opinion, the strongest songs are the ones that sound the most like the Doobies from the days of \\"Stampede\\", \\"Toulouse Street\\" and \\"...Vices\\", which are \\"Chateau\\", \\"Nobody\\" (redone from the very first Doobie album), and the superior title cut.<br /><br />Thanks to HOR Records for bringing the \\"Brothers\\" back one more time!
B0017ANAZO|1.0|**REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS**<br /><br />Mary Haine (Meg Ryan) finds out her husband is cheating on her and her thoughtful, caring friends offer their support.  At least, that's what the descriptions says.  Actually, it's just one long guilt trip.<br /><br />First guilt tripper is her mother, who says if Mary divorces, it'll hurt her daughter.  To drive home that message, we see a sad-faced daughter moping around and blaming her mother for everything.  What's being ignored is Mary's right to protect her mental health as well as the father's role in hurting his daughter.  If he cared about his daughter's feelings, he wouldn't have put his marriage in jeopardy the way he did.<br /><br />The person who lays it on real thick, though, is her supposed friend Edie (Debra Messing).  After Edie confesses to her own affair, she angrily tells Mary that her husband forgave her because he's a good man.  The clear message is that if Mary doesn't also forgive, then she's a bad person.  So much for moral support!<br /><br />When her friends find out the husband is cheating, they withhold the truth from Mary, claiming to protect her.  But withholding the truth doesn't protect Mary.  It protects her husband who gets to avoid the negative consequences of his actions while continuing to have his cake and eat it, too.  Their silence also meant Mary found about the affair from a complete stranger instead of her own friends.<br /><br />Another supposed friend is Sylvie (Annette Benning) who throws Mary under the bus to protect her own career.  Even her housekeeper only tries to preserve Mary's marriage, not for Mary's sake, but to save her own career.  Normally, I'd feel sorry for someone in Mary's shoes, but I couldn't because Mary is so spineless.<br /><br />First, Mary blames her husband's mistress for the affair, believing the mistress came on so strong, the poor guy didn't stand a chance.  She then makes a fool of herself, demanding the mistress let her husband go, as if he's being held hostage.  She forgets her husband entered the affair freely and the only didn't leave because he's spineless, too.<br /><br />In the end, Mary concludes that the reason her husband cheated was because she wasn't a whole person.  Now that she's supposedly whole, they can be together again.  However, her husband didn't cheat because of what Mary lacked.  He cheated because of what he lacked - good character.<br /><br />These messages disturbed me because too often, the betrayed spouse gets unfairly blamed for adultery.  I also didn't like how glibly adultery is presented.  Although there's one scene where Mary cries over being cheated on, for the most part, she's not too affected by it.  Shortly after discovering her husband's adultery, she's even laughing and having a good time with her mom.<br /><br />Besides the unfair guilt trips and glib portrayal of adultery, this movie also suffers from bad acting (especially the miscast Jada Pinkett-Smith).  Overall, this movie went from bad to worse.it.  Shortly after she discovers his adultery, she's even laughing and having a good time with her mom.     The message this sends to female viewers is that they, too, should just shrug adultery off as a minor offense and just forgive as quickly as Mary does.       The acting in this movie  is  pretty bad, too.  Annette Benning overacts as usual.  Debra Messing, who's usually funny,  also overacts.   But  it was Jada Pinkett-Smith who is the most miscast here.   She seemed really self-conscious in this role and it was cringe-inducing to watch her.  Meg  Ryan's acting  came off okay only because everyone else performed so poorly.   Overall, this movie went from bad to worse.
B00000DHR0|3.0|Whether you think of Celine Dion as exquisite or just excessive, you still gotta admit that there's no singer alive who's more suited to doing a Christmas album--that is, if you consider the genre in more or less pop-conventional terms.  Holiday records are actually kind of problematic for most contemporary recording artists.  The thing that seems to bog down so many performers who attempt a \\"seasonal\\" record is that they try to have it both ways.  They want to be a little sentimental, but also feel the need to be knowing and ironic.  There's always that tension between the holy and the hip.    Whatever else you might want to say about Dion, you gotta admit--for ill or good--she doesn't have an IRONIC bone in her body, especially when she's singing in English.  She grew up listening to and absorbing all kinds of music from the lower 48, but like many non-US born singers who tackle American music, she can't quite get that attitude thing down.  Even the schmaltziest American artists are \\"aware\\" of the schmaltz.  They acknowledge their own cheesiness and make gentle fun of themselves in their stage banter, their phrasing and their demeanor.  When they drag out the holiday chestnuts, there's a tendency to sing 'em with a nod and a wink, even as they're roasting 'em over an open fire.    That's pretty much a non-issue as far as Mme Angelil is concerned.  The holiday numbers on this record are sung as \\"straight\\" and as SINCERELY as you're going to find a contemporary diva do them.  Whether you find her takes on such carols as \\"O Holy Night,\\" or \\"O Come All Ye Faithful,\\" or the aria \\"Ave Maria\\" tasteful over or under the top, you gotta admit she's right out there, with her heart on the sleeve of her holiday sweater.  My own take is that these tracks have some lovely moments AND some of sheer overkill.  I find it makes a big difference what system I play this record on.  On my car stereo--which usually sounds pretty good--the record, and some of Celine Dion's high notes, sound so distorted  and so nasal that I have to tune the volume down to next to nothing.  Or just turn the dang thing off.    But give Celine (or her producers) some credit.  Not every track is a tour-de-force, in fact.  Some like her take on \\"Blue Christmas\\" are relatively understated.  And since no Xmas album is complete without a few surprises, I give her her props for finding (and in one case co-writing) some pleasant, radio-friendly holiday tunes that are a bit off the beaten track (or should I say, \\"the well trodden snow covered lane\\"?).   Her \\"Don't Save It All For Christmas Day\\" is just such a pleasant surprise, a little soulful but relatively restrained. You can pretty much say the same for D. Snyder's \\"Magic of Christmas Day.\\"  Bryan Adams \\"Another Year Has Gone By\\" is not, strictly speaking, a straight holiday tune (it mentions the 4th of July, as well as Christmas) but it's an \\"end of year\\" song (although it COULD actually refer to a couple's anniversary date and not the end of the calendar year).  Thematically, it fits in fairly well nonetheless--which is probably the rationale behind the \\"sorta\\" title tune. The holidays are a \\"special time,\\" but they aren't specifically the \\"special times\\" cited in the song.  Nothing really glaringly out of place though.    Not quite as sure how you can readily justify the inclusion of \\"Brahm's Lullabye\\" in the mix here--well, babies and Christmas, yeah, I guess they all make for \\"special times,\\" but I can imagine that a few fans would have preferred a more standard holiday blend.  And too, her two duets are not really holiday fare, although the number she shares with Andrea Bocelli, \\"Prayer,\\" is at least thematically relgious.  \\"I'm Your Angel,\\" her duet with R. Kelly, could have been a track on any of her standard pop albums.  I won't even try to justify it with a \\"Christmas/Angel\\" connection.  Actually, it just seems reflective of a recent trend in holiday pop albums to throw in a few non-seasonal numbers, probably tokeep 'em listening well beyond the holidays.       When Celine Dion tackles an iconic rocker's song, she opens herself up for all kinds of criticism.  I don't know that she has a clue about the bitter undertone in John Lennon's \\"Happy Xmas (War Is Over).\\"  Lennon just about spat out the lines, \\"And so this is Christmas/And what have you done.\\"  The song is as bitter as it is hopeful, perhaps more of a wish to be able to BELIEVE in peace and love than an expression of same.  I don't think Celine quite gets that. But after a few listenings, I decided the world had room for her decidedly non-ironic take on the song.  I'll admit though, the first few times had me missing Yoko Ono.    I gather some die hard fans were disappointed with the albums closing tracks, in which Celine is joined by her famously musical family.  Things get all universal and multi-cultural on \\"Feliz Navidad,\\" with her French speaking family members joining in the chorus of alternating Spanish and English text.  Gotta love the universalism in that.  But, even though I know I'm a minority here, for me the highlight of the reocrd is the atypical closing number, \\"Les Cloches du Hameau,\\" in which Celine's is just one of many voices in the family choir.  No diva-nonsense among the old folks at home.  Kind of refreshing when you think of it.
B003L77GG0|5.0|10th Season, Show 2 (September 24,2010) Sadly Zod is gone and Lois has already taken off to join Perry White in Africa to search for clues concerning the Red Queen (Martha).  Come on girl you've got the strongest, kindest and best looking guy on the planet (and beyond) and you leave? Isn't it time to deal with committment?  :) Hell-o!  Wish everyone would smile just a little bit more.  Everything has gotten so \\"dark\\"...literally.  Sometimes can't even see what is happening on screen! Maybe a little more yellow sun?  :)
B003YLK2RI|5.0|First off i read a few reviews before the release of this dvd and I'm shocked that so many people bashed this release because its not offered on Blu-ray my first reaction from this is so what!!! I mean honestly folks Blu-ray is sweet dont get me wrong but the picture and quality on this disc is not far from it i have a Blu-ray disc player so its kinda near HD but it doesnt really matter to me.I love this dvd set it reminds me when i saw Slipknot for the first time back on the Mayhem fest 2 years ago at VA Beach and one word to describe that show: BADASS!!! They are without a doubt the best live band out there well I take that back I would put them 2nd behind the legendary Metallica nobody and i repeat nobody can top those guys ever they are true icons!! But with this awesome dvd you get the whole live performance in Donington Park, England which they rocked the arena big time!! You get 18 live songs including some personal favorites like Duality, Wait and Bleed, Before I Forget, Surfacing, Psychosocial etc. And if this wasn't good enough 4 music videos and the making of one of them Snuff and a full-length film that is dedicated to the late great bass player Paul Gray R.I.P.This dvd set is def worth it if your a maggot or a big metal fan go out and buy this dvd you wont regret it I can honestly say when i saw these guys in concert 2 years ago i feel lucky that i got the chance because bottom line Slipknot is a great band full of very talented musicans so do yourself a favor a pick this up!!
B002KDUDG6|2.0|This was the first time I was disappointed in Mr. Buble. His voice carries itself and yet he pulled a Harry Connick, Jr and tried to change the songs when all he needed was to sing, sing, sing. Yes, I admit I love singing along but he didn't let me do that with these songs, the beats and hesitations were too off for me to enjoy. I hope he goes back to just being himself and showcasing his wonderful voice and singing the classic and new songs like only he can, now that Frank and Dino and the rest are gone.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet, as others have already penned their track-by-track synopsis.<br /><br />Buy this album!<br /><br />It's not often that a band releases two records in a row where EVERY SINGLE SONG is a winner.  You get your moneys worth with the ZBB.  All talented musicians, and ZB is a superb songwriter.  This band is a breath of fresh air in a world of bubble gum pop music.<br /><br />If I had to compare the ZBB to anyone else, they remind me of a modern day verson of The Band.<br /><br />On a side note, many of these songs are on the live album released prior to this one.  This band's live sound is equal to their studio sound.  No fancy touch-ups, or processing.  They are the real deal.
0312600844|4.0|So many of the elements of this book -- character, dialogue, plot, descriptive details --  triggered the pleasure center of my brain.  I can't help but recommend it. Franzen took me on a voyeuristic safari through these characters' lives, and left me feeling as if I was a more complete person.
0312600844|1.0|My feelings regarding this book can best be summed up by the scene where one character is digging through his own excrement to find his wedding ring, only for me there was no redemptive gold nugget of wisdom or edification for my efforts.  Just a feeling of filth and the desire never to read anything by this author again.  Boiled down to its essence, this book consists of the following:    1.  Weak, boring, stereotypical, unrelateable characters whose lives even 600 pages of TMI couldn't persuade me to care about or sympathize with.    2.  Undisguised, self-indulgent political ranting against overpopulation, mining, conservatives, religion, and the presidency of Bush II; and contempt for those who disagree with these views.    3.  Graphic (to the point of trashy) sex scenes, and a major adolescent-like preoccupation with the male member, which at times is disturbingly treated like another character in the novel.    4.  Grating overuse of the F-word (and no, I don't mean Freedom or Franzen).  Not even limited to a certain character - everyone uses it profusely in every conversation - it's a literary insult that Mr. Franzen couldn't summon better than base, foul language to communicate the feelings of his characters in EVERY situation they faced.      Toss in a few disgusting scatalogical adventures involving the consumption of poo as part of a sexual fantasy, and later digging through it with bare hands and ... ta-dah!  You have Jonathan Franzen's Freedom.      That Oprah would lend her considerable influence to promoting such drivel is beyond disappointing, if unsurprising.    Laborious, unfulfilling, depressing, crude, and about 600 pages too long.
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Let me start off by saying: I AM CHEAP.  If a book has been out for a while and selling in paperback for $8, I want it on the kindle for $4.  Normally I shy away from paying full price for an e-book that's not a new release; again this is because I am cheap.  Therefore, when I say I paid $7.99 (FULL-PRICE!) for not 1 but all 3 of these books, that should serve as a testament to how good they are.    This entire series is great and one of the rare ones where the books just kept getting better finally culminating in \\"The Hero of Ages\\".  I'm not going to rehash the plot and I'm not going to rehash the series.  If you've read the first two there is no need to read a review, just buy it and enjoy.    That must mean you've just come across this book and you're wondering if you should invest both the Time and Money in this series.  My answer is an unequivocal YES.  While the first two books have some issues, they are more akin to a writer getting warmed up.  Sanderson's unique take on things throughout this entire series doesn't stop here, he steps it up another level.  This is a book that makes you turn back and look at the previous two in a whole new light which is something I've rarely found.    --- Bottom line ---  Books 1 & 2: 4-star each, Book 3: 5-star.  Entire series 5-star, this is one of my favorites and I don't give 5 stars often.
B003HN7BWW|2.0|This is the worst sounding remaster I have ever had the displeasure of listening to (even the Megadeth remasters aren't this bad!).    The cymbals/hi-hats are way too prominent in the mix, they sound like small blasts of white noise, and the bottom end is overly boomy (as on Domination) to the point of losing punch.    Stick with the original mix of Cowboys From Hell.  Remaster FAIL.
B001UREJWM|2.0|I really really really wanted to like this album.  The Dio version of Black Sabbath produced what is in my opinion one of the all time great heavy metal albums with \\"Heaven And Hell\\" back in the 80's.  The rest of the band's catalogue was not as strong, but \\"Mob Rules\\" was a good effort and to a lesser extent \\"Dehumanizer\\" in the 90's.  So, it was with great anticipation that I looked forward to this reunion album after all these years.  Even in his mid-60's Dio can still sing his ass off and Iommi, Butler and Appice remain top notch metal musicians.  Unfortunately the material here, for the most part, just does not cut the mustard.  The music is mostly slow and plodding, which is not necessarily a bad thing when talking about Sabbath, but here the lack of variety eventually tends to wear the listener down.  Dio's lyrics suffer from problems that have plagued him throughout his career.  He makes big grandiose statements, but in the end they don't really say anything relevant.  He also reverts to cliché's that he has used time and time again with songs like \\"Rock N Roll Angel\\" and \\"Follow The Tears\\".   I have always thought it would have been interesting to let Geezer Butler write some of the lyrics (he was the main lyricist back in the Ozzy era of Sabbath), but unfortunately he is not given a shot at it here.  There are a few good tracks on this disc, and I especially like the single \\"Bible Black\\", but overall the album just does not do that much for me.  One of my major disappointments in 2009 and unfortunately Ronnie James Dio's final statement.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Claire Danes is an amazing actor in this truly amazing story.  I have read two of Ms. Grandin's books and I highly recommend this movie to everyone.
0517548232|1.0|I wish I had read more of the reviews to learn that this book is less about economics and more about pushing a particular political point of view.  The point of view is hard right and the current recession disproves most of the economic patter.  After skimming a few pages I threw it away; I didn't even want it in the house.
B0041ZQHHA|5.0|This is a great album in my opinion. Brandon has a beautiful unique voice that compliments the beats of the songs. It is a wonderful fresh combination and I cannot stop listing to this album.
0312600844|4.0|As opposed to what someone else said, that no one talks this way, I find this to be a truthful and accurate snapshot of real life people. The good, the bad, the truly inappropriately secret parts.  It will force some people to take a good look at this place we live in, and they won't like it.  I didn't always love each and every character all the time, but I was always drawn back.  I can see how an awful lot of people ( considering Oprah has now recommended it ) will not like this book for the sexual content alone.  It's a story of life and the truth of this family.
0439023483|5.0|Sixteen-year-old Katniss is a survivor. Katniss struggles to provide for her mother and young sister by hunting and gathering after her father dies. In a future where the US has fallen, the result of brutal wars has left 12 districts governed by cruel dictators. Each year the government chooses a boy and girl from each district to participate in the Hunger Games - a fight to the death, televised for all to see. The Hunger Games are a punishment on the districts for a long-ago uprising against the Capitol. This year, Katniss is shocked when her young sister's name is chosen to participate from the lottery. So Katniss volunteers to take her place, along with Peeta - the son of the district's baker. The two have little fighting skills compared to other districts' participants who have been training their whole lives for this event.<br /><br />Katniss is a completely engaging character. I usually can't stand present tense narrative, but Collins' writing pulled me in nonetheless. I was pulled in from the start, and couldn't let go. It's a story of love, friendship, surviving, violence, and death. The reader experiences everything that Katniss does, and experiences a full range of emotions. Collins' characters are truly stunning.<br /><br />This is an immensely popular trilogy, and I now know why. With an abundance of drama and suspense, this futuristic science fiction novel for young adults will appeal to readers young and old. It's breathtaking and a fantastic adventure from beginning to end.
B0013IKUIK|5.0|Yep, most ridiculous music ever.  Infact maybe not even music.  Oh!  But then there's those other levels of human perception and emotion is one of them.  Whatever this guy did, whether he stayed in a cabin for a year or whatever, after you listen to it, you put it down and think, \\"never again.\\"  And then all of sudden, yeah, one more time. and then one more.  And then... yeah it's the saddess music there's ever been but it's never tired and you want to hear it just one more time... and just one more time... and for emma, forever ago...
B003UTUQ3E|5.0|Station to Station is one of the best albums of all time, in my opinion. It was the album that made me a huge David Bowie fan, and it's never lost an iota of its hold on me all these years later. The songs can be upbeat but emotional, open yet often sinister. There always seems to be something bubbling under the surface, giving the songs a power that was at times lacking on an album like Young Americans.<br /><br />I've never had any problem with the sound of the original CD release, so I probably would not have opted for this reissue if it weren't for the Nassau Coliseum concert. The album sounds great, and the concert is absolutely tremendous. He plays songs spanning almost his entire career thus far, but (as Bowie so often did) with his new 1976 style. Suffragette City, for instance, doesn't just rock here - it also glides along on an almost-disco beat.<br /><br />Sometimes, reissues come with a little padding to trick the consumer into shelling out for something they already have. This concert isn't just padding - it's the real reason to buy this set. The improved mix of the proper album is just the icing on the cake.
0887307280|5.0|I just finished reading the brazilian version of \\"E-Myth Revisited\\" by Michael E. Gerber. The book is great. As the author says \\"This book is not simply a prescription for success; it's a call to arms [in life]... It's a call to [continuous] learning.\\" Intriguing. It is a must for businessmen and business teachers. Professor Giba Canto.
B001ED7C58|1.0|This is more an opinion than review.     I was extremely surprised and utterly disappointed with this CD (from Atlantic Records) because it appears to be something other than a \\"sound track\\" as I define them. Perhaps it's my definition of the term which is the problem. I understand a sound track to be a faithful rendition of the music in   the movie. I did not find that to be the case here. Some music was repeated, and some apparently omitted. Repetitions were acceptable and seemed true to the originals, but the omission(s) were not.    Although I was enchanted with the music, one selection in the movie especially (when Bella was near death after the attack by James) was particularly haunting and it was this I especially wanted: after repeated listens, I didn't find it on the CD at all!  (Don't know the name of it, but track 10 on the CD comes closest.)
0440242401|2.0|I was expecting more from a 'best seller' as it says on the book cover. I also thought a story about a girl with amnesia would be lots of fun. But nothing interesting happened and the story was too predictible. I liked the boyfriend's character (John? can't remember), but Lexi got on my nerves.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|This is my first review in my 10 plus years of using Amazon. Amazon's customer service is excellent; the problems that I have had have always been rectified to my satisfaction. Case in point: Pre-ordered this set, had no idea that they had dropped the price, and I received a $5 credit today. Awesome! Also, I got the disc delivered to my home on Monday! Excellent service!! Don't know why so many feel the need to complain, but I have always been a 100% satisfied customer!    As for the movie itself, Iron Man was better, but this was definitely a worthy follow up. Looking forward to Thor this Summer.    -B
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Great way to carry my cameras and equipment.  Easily accessible and easy to carry.  Love it.
0439023513|4.0|I did enjoy this book, but I detested the ending. What on Earth took the author to this finale?     As the final book of the [[ASIN:0545265355 Hunger Games Trilogy Boxset]] it was by far the fattest and most read-y of them all. This is fine, obviously we have a lot to sort out after the shock ending of [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]]. And like all the books in this trilogy it started where the last book left off and ran with that, except in this case I think it ran a little far from the characters organic selves.     Mockingjay sees Katniss turn now to take down the Capital via a rebellion warfare. However the author couldn't decide if Katniss is going to be fully emerged in this plan with the same passion and strength she usually has, especially with the revenge she wishes to seek on Snow, or if she will be meek, act her part, and loll around contemplating not much, not visiting her mum & sister, or even being with Gale. Slight change of pace there for Katniss, the girl on fire who always did things with the peoples best intentions, for the people, her family, with integrity. I honestly don't think her honour values would have changed. That is after all, why she was so loved.    She can now be with Gale and her family. But wait, Gale is getting tech savvy. He has all this time to catch up and be with Katniss, time to go outside with her, hunt with her, but no he is busy planning bombs and such. The peacemaker Gale is doing this. Doesn't quite equate with his character, unless he's had enough of the Capital too and wants major revenge.     These subtle changes in character throughout the book are necessary for the author to have a \\"Happy Ever After\\" finale. But this is The Hunger Games. No one gets a happy ever after from those. Not from a war either. But in order for the book to end Hollywood style she needs to change Gale, Katniss, her family, even Haymich, so it's possible to live blissfully somehow. How Peeta could is verystretched indeed.    It didn't work. It ruined the book. Such a shame too because this was a brilliant series. While I enjoyed this book, it lacked the depth and heart the first two books were filled with. There was no humility here, no compassion, no family/friendship bonds, just loose ties bent to fit together. I skim read it in parts but again couldn't put it down, and compared to many books out there it's still very good, but in terms of the series finale, it was such a disappointment.     This is not, in my mind, how Katniss would have \\"chosen\\" to end up spending her life.
B00408AN5A|1.0|I enjoyed the little book.  A very easy read in less than 2 hours.  Nothing original.  However, it not \\"How To Win Friends & Influence People\\" or \\"Think and Grow Rich,\\" as promoted.  Dale Carnegie and Jim Rohn had a wisdom from their long life of experience that Darren Hardy doesn't exude quite yet simply because he is very young and writes with more of a shallowness.  For example, the 40 plus \\"qualities\\" he listed and wanted in his future wife - even down to the texture of her hair (is hair texture a QUALITY?) and he got it all...just sounds superficial to me.  It's a linear way of thinking that limits a persons relationship to a checklist.  I'm happy he got all 40 qualities that he wanted in his woman though!  Just remember, that women change, their bodies change, and I hope his \\"list\\" can become flexible.  Also, there is a lot of self promoting throughout the book that gets rather annoying.  \\"Buy at least five of these books for your friends if you really want to be successful,\\" etc.  I am already very successful and I didn't buy FIVE of his books.   I have a wonderful husband who has really thin hair - oh no!  That wasn't on my list!, 6 awesome children, a challenging job that I love, and am involved in many charitable organizations.  But FIVE books?  Who's success is he really wanting?  That's a very clever manipulation to \\"ensure MY success\\" and for more than quadrupling his book sales.  And the statement he made, \\"all the essentials to living a successful life condensed into one book.\\"  Really, Darren?  Is God mentioned in your book?  Or can we get EVERYTHING from YOU?  Wow!  Amazing!!!  Just something to think about.    Kim
0439023483|5.0|Firstly, if it were possible, this book would be a four and a half star review. It lost half a star due to the ending feeling rushed and I dislike that in a great book that you're immersed in, otherwise, it's deserving of a five star review and here's why.    The Hunger Games is the most unique concept thought up that I have ever read. Who would think that culling your children for sport would ever happen, yet when you think about it, look at the world - child soldiers anyone? However this is more big brother meets survival on your television screen. This concept could be gory, yet with death scenes the author shows compassion and grace, after all, it's not like anyone volunteers to be a tribute representing their district in the games, unless you're saving a member of your family.     Heartwarming probably isn't a word you'd use given the topic, however Katniss, our leading lady, shows such humility to her fellow tributes that she becomes a district wide hero, and that then makes her a governmental enemy. How dare she have everyone liking her. It's supposed to be entertainment, not a show of mercy and compassion. Yet it's these small gestures that make the book real. How can she kill someone that is just like her sister and not be affected? Assuming she does... And of course such actions bring repercussions. Breaking the rules brings consequence.    You cannot read this book without being part of it. Without wondering how their parents are thinking as they watch their children die. Without wondering what horrible theme is going to be set upon the tributes in the games. It's certainly not an honour to win, after all, that means you've survived where as 23 others haven't. Their mentor - a former tribute winner - is now a raging alcoholic. This is what the games do to you it seems.    There are political plans, romance, family, and a huge dose of do whatever you must to get you through, and there are gory moments yet they don't read as some horror gore, they read as survival, with respect. Props to the author for such genuine writing and for creating characters who are so real, with brains, hearts, individual talents, and filling the book with humanity - giving the world, our world, a taste of what we could become, and probably are, like.    The hunger games was well written, compelling, intelligent, unique, and I couldn't put it down. As I said, my only irk with it was that the ending was suddenly rushed and to me, didn't fit the pace with the rest of the novel. But don't let that stop you. This is one worth reading.
0312370849|5.0|Loved the book and the style written in. Found it reviewed in AARP magazine and had to have it.  Glad I did and now I am reading her next book.  pcm
0439023491|5.0|Often I wonder why people do trilogy's, thinking that the first book was such a ripper read that I cannot grasp why they would ruin the story by building a trilogy from it. However [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]] was the exception!  Catching Fire was without a doubt the best of the trilogy. I doubt many second books are the best read, but this one I could not put down and although I thought I knew where the plot would take me, I was so wrong I was overjoyed.<br /><br />It started with a bang, running from where life after the games had just begun right back into the arena of hell, celebrating the Tributes. You didn't think Katniss could get away with the ruckus she'd created the first time did you? This time though, she was up against all the other winners. Some old, some young. Many wanting to take revenge on the Capital just like she did. But was that really wise?<br /><br />Once more, the pretend affections were displayed and then her own thoughts took her back to her district, her family, Gale, but she was on a different mission this time around. it wasn't about survival for her own life this time. However the tributes had other plans.<br /><br />This book again showed compassion where there was actually bloody warfare, honesty intertwined with conspiracy, humility and grace where violent death occurred, and once more the people took a stand against the governing Capital that had total control of all the districts, with extremely dangerous consequences, echoing to us, the reader, how many live in this world of ours.<br /><br />Catching Fire was brilliantly written, quick paced, action packed, with such an alarming ending that you just don't see coming! If you're the type of person who reads the back page first you'll have ruined the experience for yourself, so please, with this one, read it front to back. I devoured this novel and rate this as probably the best follow up in a series ever. Can't rate it high enough.
B003XQM2YU|4.0|But for the poor lighting and poor sound for spoken word I could give this film a resounding 5 stars.  Visuals are great but what good does it do for actors to act and speak if the sound engineering does not capture the words they speak so that those who hope to be entertained can hear them?  The same goes for the lighting.  At times there were mere shadows on screen and much vivid detail was lost because someone didn't know how to light the scenes.  Wonderful adaptation of story and plot.  I could have used a bit more depth for supporting characters, but then I'm picky about such things.
0525951652|5.0|When it comes to dramatizing history, no one - and I mean no one - does it better than Ken Follett. With no less than a dozen main characters spread across the globe, Follett pulls off the amazing feat of making each character's storyline as compelling as the next. So much so that not once did I find myself bored or frustrated, wishing I could jump ahead. Whether it's the poor Russian peasant dreaming of life in America, the idealistic young American aid to a President on the brink of war, the beautiful English house servant in love with her master, or the good-hearted German Baron torn between conscience and country, the drama in their personal lives beautifully reflects the drama unfolding in the geo-political world around them. If you're looking for a dry, sober account of the events that lead to the first and second world wars with no humanistic take whatsoever... buy yourself a history book. But if you want an informative, romantic and engrossing epic that truly makes you feel what it was like to have lived through the events that would define the 20th century, than this is the book for you.    P.S. For those who take issue with the fictional side of historical fiction, think of it like this... Films like LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, BRAVEHEART, THE GODFATHER, or TV shows like \\"Deadwood,\\" \\"Mad Men,\\" \\"Boardwalk Empire,\\" and \\"The Tudors,\\" while far from accurate, have successfully introduced millions to important moments in history they otherwise would never have known about. And at the very least, inspiried them to look up and learn more about these people, places and times of the past that helped shape our present.

0786955554|5.0|As a long-time collector of Dungeon Tiles I can say without reservation that this is the best collection yet published.  True, most of the tiles are recycled from old sets (all of them as far as I can tell), but with such a low price, a full ten sheets of durable double-sided tiles, and the incredibly handsome and even useful box, the new Essentials line of Dungeon Tiles outshines every past edition.    What is this thing?:  Dungeon Tiles are handsomely detailed pre-printed heavy cardstock 'pieces' that you can use to cobble together a map for wargames.  In this case the tiles are sized for D&D miniatures (~25-30mm), with the grid spacing hovering around an inch.  The Dungeon Tiles sets include a whole pile of tiles representing rooms, corridors, furniture, traps, and the like.      The Tiles:  The Dungeon Tiles Master Set - The Dungeon contains a smörgåsbord (a lot!) of tiles collected from previous editions, enough to build a respectable multi-room dungeon out of.  With a full ten sheets of double-sided tiles this is the biggest single collection published.      The Box:  In addition, the oversized box the tiles ship in provides superior protection to the tiles within, in addition to being a giant tile itself (the box is printed like a dungeon plinth and made from the same materials as the tiles themselves).  The box is easily big enough to store any loose tiles you might have collected from previous sets too, at least twice as thick as necessary for the product within.    The Value:  There has never been a better value in dungeon tiles published by Wizards of the Coast, between the number of tiles for your money, as well as the very handy box, this is a fantastic way for new DMs to build their collection of handy tiles.    Altogether this is a wonderful product for new DMs, or for those who wish to expand their collections.  If you already own several copies of every other Wizards produced Dungeon Tile you will not find anything new here beyond the box.
0525951652|5.0|Having loved The Pillars of the Earth and World Without End, I have been looking forward to this book for a long time.  I was able to pick it up early and go through it quicker than I would have liked.  This book lived up to the expectations and then some.  The characters feel true to life, and the book is able to bounce from such things as the coal mines to aristocracy while making you intersted and invested in both.  European politics from the early 20th century are expolored from a wide variety of viewpoints, and although the story is fictional, you can't help but be moved by each character involved in such huge world events.  If you enjoyed Follett's other stories, do not miss this one.      Oh, and to all those boycotting the Kindle price, just man up and pay the whole extra 20 cents, you'll live.  Or just do it the way it's always been done and always should be done: BUY AND ENJOY THE ACTUAL BOOK!

0307454541|1.0|Absolutely awful. I won't repeat all the negative reviews, but I certainly agree with them. There was one theme that did amuse me, however............the GALLONS upon GALLONS of coffee that was consumed by two people. I wish I had kept a \\"coffe and sandwich\\" count as I went along.
1435101162|4.0|Jane Austen is a great author.  Getting into the story, the characters and the ensuing plot all make for a pleasure!  The book has time period illustrations but most of all it's the story itself that makes for a great book.  This particular novel is a bit on the large side though so a little lap pillow might come in handy : ).
B002RWKSII|5.0|I heard this playing in Border's, inquired about it, purchased it, and have been listening to it ever since.  I keep it in my car and listen to it on the way to and from work every day.  Great way to start the day!  I have never seen Porgy & Bess, but I will be looking for it to come to our local performing arts center!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I wanted a more efficient bag for my needs: I travel 3-4 times per year, where I carry my D90 SLR, 3 or so lenses, spare batteries and media, netbook PC with cables, GPS unit for the car, and a few snacks, and maybe a book for the plane. All of this needs to fit in a carry-on friendly package for ever more crowded airplanes. I've been using another bag that cost 3x this price, and has too many separate compartments to fit some of my larger items.    Browsing for a better bag I found this one, and figured for the price I couldn't go wrong to try it. The night it came home, I packed it for my next trip (even though it's a month away). Everything fits, seems well padded. Bag is comfortable fully loaded. The front cover is plenty big for my 9\\" eeePC, and easily could hold a 10\\" netbook probably even up to a 12\\" model. The depth of the bag is not great: any lens longer than about 3-1/2 inches is going to have to lay on it's side. No big deal, I had plenty of room for allow that.    Very glad I tried it.
B000YI7MRM|3.0|I do not wish to repeat all that has been previously said about Alatriste. I concur with the majority of reviewers; however I wish to add my own thoughts about one of the failures of the movie. In trying to compress 4 to 5 novels in the space of one movie it has a disjointed feel and only those viewers who are aficionados of Perez-Reverte know what is going on. As I recall the novels are the memoirs of Inigo, Alatriste's page/adopted son. Would it not have been advantageous to have his voice over to connect for viewers the plot as it developed over time? We only hear a voice over at the start and the conclusion. Perhaps it can still be done if this video is ever released in the English speaking world. Personally, I enjoyed the Spanish language edition; it adds much more authenticity to the movie.
030726999X|1.0|After thoroughly enjoying the first two books, I was eagerly waiting for this one.  However, from the beginning to the end I was sorely disappointed.  The book was boring, the story barely moved along and there were a ton of useless characters that all had similar names.  It's too bad that it didn't live up to the first two books.
B003V5PPZG|4.0|I have been a Linkin Park fan since around 2001. Their first album Hybrid Theory was very good. They followed it up with an even better release IMO in Meteora. Then after waiting 4 years we got Minutes to Midnight in 2007 and it was different but very good. Now we have A Thousand Suns and while it is far from the best album they have made it is still very good.<br /><br />People seem to dislike change and that is something that I will never understand. The rap / rock genre is dead. Linkin Park has decided to evolve and they have done that very well. Another band I love in AFI has done that as well and a lot of their older fans have turned on them as well. People need to stop living in the past and just enjoy Linkin Park for what they are now and see how talented they still are.<br /><br />My favorite songs on the album are Burning in the Skies, Waiting for the End and Blackout. Nothing on the album is bad though and I love how they mixed in famous quotes and other audio to go along with it.<br /><br />As I said above, this is not the best album they have made but still very good. Give it a fair chance and don't judge it based off of the fact that it's not a clone of Hybrid Theory or Meteora and I think you will enjoy it.
0142414999|5.0|The novel \\"Let it Snow\\" is a book written in collaboration by John Green, Maureen Johnson, and Lauren Myracle. Together, the three create a group of love stories that are all entangled in some way or another. The ways that the stories intertwine are cleverly done and extremely interesting, and they all come together to create one larger picture. The three separate love stories follow the lives of generally unnoticed Jubilee, witty and funny Tobin, and generally bubbly, but now a little gloomy, Addie. We find each of them on Christmas Eve when one of the biggest storms hits Gracetwon, Virginia.     We find Jubilee, who is currently dating the \\"perfect\\" guy, stuck in Gracetown on her way to Florida. She happens to meet a young man named Stuart, who is kind of mysterious, but sweet and kind at the same time. Next we meet Tobin for our second story, who is currently enrolled in a movie night with his two best friends. The trio embarks on an adventure through the snow storm, and on the way, you can probably guess, love emerges. Finally in our third story we meet Addie, recently broken up with her soul mate, she is trying to find her way again, but it may not be all that for her in the future.      John Green, Maureen Johnson, and Lauren Myracle create a book with and extremely unique style and sense of humor. There are so many different funny, witty, charming, intelligent, and heart filled plot points that it is impossible not to love. All of their characters are not fictitious Princes and Princess in some far away land, but they are like normal, real people which makes this story so relatable.     This book may not be for all people. Do I recommend that a seventeen year old boy cuddle up next to the fire to read these love stories? Do I recommend than an eighty year old man sit down one afternoon and read a story about three teenage love stories? No. But, I adored this book, and I think all women will feel the same. If you enjoy sweet heartfelt love stories, this book is definitely what you are looking for. This book is so well thought out and so well developed that it is amazing, and I completely recommend this book.
B003VB5D84|2.0|Once again EC has collected his friends and heroes to play the 12 bar blues a few more times.    The GOOD:Jeff Beck, nuff-said. Derek Trucks smokes. John Mayer surprises. To me they were clearly the standouts.  And ZZ Top at least were a little sloppy, rawk- attitude filled raucus good time.    The BAD: Everyone has an opinion. My admittedly harsh one is this. Jimmy Vaughan is a snooze fest. The poor guy cannot sing at all.  And the whole thing just comes to a screaching halt when hes onscreen. NO stage presence at all. ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.    Sonny Landreth and Robert Cray are gifted players, but to me its just, well....a bit boring. No personality. Buddy Guy shows everybody how it  should be done, but he barely solos...letting Johnny Lang grab the spotlight..which is OK...but why is Buddy not given the \\"hero\\" spot?  When Buddy Guy is onstage I want to HEAR Buddy Guy!    These types of events are always rife with too many guitarists on stage at once. I know its a \\"guitar fest\\" But when you have so many players on the stage at the same time evreybody gets short changed. And what the heck is Earl Klugh doing on a country jam of \\"Lay Down Sally?\\"Tele,Tele, Tele....nylon string solo. Just does not fit. I dont get it....    The UGLY: Clapton's set. Oh man, I love Eric, but...no one needs another lame 12 minute long version of \\"I shot the Sheirff.\\" No one!   And dont even get me started on Citizen Cope! I mean it was painful. Painful. Why oh WHY was he even there? Dreadful.     Clapton shows a brief glimpse of the power he still possesses with Steve Winwood and they do a pretty good version of Voodoo Chile. Then they get everybody, and I mean everybody on stage one more time, for Sweet Home Chicago. Look, Im a guitarist myself and many of the guys on the stage are heroes on mine , but for goddsake no one should be subjected to another version of Sweet Home Chicago ever again.    Ultimately I would prefer if you could buy a 10 disk set, (in 4 volumes) and get ALL of the FULL sets( or at least 20 minutes) of ALL of the big acts. At 2 disks you get a large quantity of artists but not enough quality performances.    Just my opinion, ya know.
B003TML0VO|1.0|Wow, 14 covers of rock classics, and each and every one is clearly inferior to the original. The 'Back in Black' cover is the worst abomination since Jimmy Page let P. Diddy defecate all over 'Kashmir'. What was Carlos thinking? I heard he first declined Clive Davis' idea to do this project, just goes to show first instincts are usually correct. If he really wanted to do a covers album he should have knocked out an EP with his band and gave it away on his website, instead of this travesty. Truly a low point in a career that has produced some brilliant, timeless music.
014241493X|5.0|This book is missing nothing.  It is the Freebird of YA novels.  I want to stand up and hold a lighter and whoop.  Read it.  I'm glad I did.
0811876373|5.0|These are the cutest things on earth!  I have attempted to make a few sets - mine of course didn't come out as nice. But, I tried!  My only disappointment is with the edible pens that you use with some of them.  I can't seem to find one that really works properly.  I was so frustrated after making 24 orange pumpkins and couldn't get one of these pens to do its job.  Nothing worked!  My suggestion is to not do those pops - pick something that uses sprinkles, etc.  They;ll turn out better.
0545123275|4.0|About 20 pages in, I was convinced this was Twilight for wolfaboos.  However, I can say that I was glad I stuck with it, because I hate romance (I picked it up because it was about wereolves) and even this managed to make me both squee and sigh once or twice.  Which is pretty hard to do once I've made up my mind about a book (just look at my other reviews.)<br />While I had a relatively minor problem with Grace being the typical Custom-Made Love Interest (she has no aspirations, goals, or hobbies beyond pining for \\"her wolf\\"), she is at least intelligent, proactive, and doesn't suffer from that unreasonable bitchiness most romance protagonists do.  (That \\"My man must be perfect and be all about ME!\\" aspect really gets on my nerves.)<br />The character of Sam really shines best, as a well-rounded guy who actually understands the value of poetry (I mean it; he gets it, he doesn't just quote it to look romantic) and has strong characterization through song lyrics.  The juxtaposition of his mindless beast state against his appreciation for  humanity's most unique trait (to write, to orate, to read) was a very nice touch.<br />Also, I have to point out that the author actually hearkens back to the idea of lycanthropy being a curse.  It sucks to be a werewolf.  These werewolves are not super hot badasses; they are humans reduced to a bestial and at times savage state, completely cut off from their human side.  I can't tell you how much a mythologist like me was glad to see that.<br />A couple of things were clumsily handled, such as the character Jack's offscreen villainy.  I personally found him to be a very pitiable character, and thought Grace's treatment of Isabel due to high school faux rules was downright cruel.  I also have to reiterate that Grace's paper-thin characterization is a shame in a book meant for female readers.  However, in a world of Evers (The Immortals Series) and Bellas, she's the least offensive I've come across.  I hate the sudden glut of paranormal/supernatural romances with bad messages as much as the next anti-Twihard, but this book surprised me with its prose and its story.romances with bad messages as much as the next anti-Twihard, but this book surprised me with its prose and its story.
B003WSFXKY|3.0|this is not original material or an earth shaking revelation type of cd.  it is a great guitarist playing classic rock and roll songs as advertised. if you like these songs and you like santana then you will probably enjoy this...otherwise  leave it alone...
0307341569|5.0|Flynn has an eye for atmospheric detail and an ear for perfect-pitch dialogue and alternative speech patterns that pulls in the reader from the first page. Each character is layered with distinct moods, motives and experiences that even when shared are misunderstood or unknown to the others. This approach propels this complicated story full throttle. But, Libby Day is the most interesting narrator, who stands out as the most realistic and engaging. Thus, she saves the story from being overshadowed by the too many desperate, and mostly despicable, people that populate the book. Reminiscent of Capote's \\"In Cold Blood,\\" the plot centers on the massacre of the Day family on a Kansas farm. In both stories, the murders are committed seemingly without reason or forethought. There the comparison ends: \\"In Cold Blood\\" tells the real murder of a prominent \\"normal\\" family; \\"Dark Places\\" describes a family, marginalized and dysfunctional, to whom nothing good has happened in a long time. Lest you think the difference in the stories is the product of fiction, at several points, Flynn reminds us of how society treats the not-pretty, not-rich. In \\"Dark Places,\\" true justice is not sought in behalf of the dead - or living - Days. Ben, the 15-year old son is accused and convicted of being the sole killer of his family. Getting to the night of the carnage is a rough, compelling read through grisly scenes. Even with the unexpected closing, this story of loss, punishment and atonement left me feeling that the situations were unavoidable.  From the beginning, there was no one to save the Day family.

B003UYV08E|2.0|This movie spent more time depicting Tony Stark's personal trouble than Ironman's achievements. That made it more like a drama. Yet, it's a half-baked drama because  it's not given enough time to move me. Just when the drama was building up, it moved to the action scenes. However, these were too brief to provide excitement. For example, the fighting at the race track looked good but it ended too quickly. The last action scenes with hundreds of Ironman clones looked like cartoon.<br /><br />There were less funny dialogues than the first film.<br />Overall, this picture is over-hyped.
B003YY7BTW|1.0|Maybe a great case for men who want to be fathers to find egg donors and surrogate mothers!    Seriously, though, this movie takes today's realities regarding dating and parenting and proposes a \\"solution\\" that potentially removes the father from families.  I understand that in this movie the woman actually finds a man, but in the \\"real world\\" not all women do find father figures for children.    The glorification of single motherhood and the removal of fathers from the \\"family\\" (due to irresponsibility of their own, the mother, and/or the current \\"family court\\" system) are huge problems in America today.  What we need is a society that values men's role in children's lives, and encourages preservation of families--to include the father/husband.    This movie isn't worth the money spent--plenty of better, traditional, romantic movies are available.
0316096199|5.0|This book was a riveting true story.  It was obvious that the author had not only experienced a tremendous trauma, but also did her research in law and psychology.
0345505387|3.0|I just received this graphic novel about 2 hours ago..and now writing a so so review, unfortunately.  I knew what to expect, from keeping up with her website.   Graphic novels are just that..comicbook-like stories.  A few things:  1 - The artwork at first and the renditions of the characters were amazing.  I said..Yes!!  That is exactly how I pictured Jamie, Murtagh, Claire, Mrs. Fitz...etc.   Then, the faces changed...and badly.  By the end of the novel, Jamie looked swollen-faced...where were the high cheek bones, the slanted BLUE eyes, the straight nose...did he gain weight?  And, Claire's hair was suddenly less frizzy in the wet Scottish weather...quite the opposite from what the book depicts over and over again - her unruly curls.  So, those facts took away from the story for me.  If their looks had been the slightest bit consistent throughout the novel, my interest would have been better kept.  Not being an expert in the least on graphic novels, I'd venture a guess that features are supersized and over emphasized.  Claire's figure got more volumptuous as the story went on it seemed.      2 - I know DG mentioned that the story was different somewhat - and deliberately..but who is that Kenneth character? I had to go back a few pages just to figure him out. Did Murtagh know him...how did Geillie know him?  And, if we didn't know that Claire time-travelled, couldn't she have explained it to Jamie a bit more...before he suddenly believed her and took her back to the stones?  Should we expect The Exile - part 2 soon?         I am a huge Outlander fan, and I think DG is a master writer.  This foray into graphic novels is great for her and her fans...the idea was a good one for us to have another \\"taste\\" of Outlander without having to wait umpteen years in-between.  However, the finished package...was disappointing.
