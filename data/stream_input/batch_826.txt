B000A2IPPK|5.0|Bought this movie for my granddaughter who has NEVER seen it!  Always loved it myself---an AAA+++++ movie!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|What can I say? Only two more episodes left to this first season and I'm so hooked.  I'll leave the synopsis-writing to others and tell you my impressions. First of all, before I knew it took place in Louisiana (didn't know that the first couple of shows) I could have told you that the humidity level was as high as my home state of Florida. I wondered (and still do) why everyone isn't getting attacked by swarms of mosquitos - I'm itchy just watching the show where everyone is walking around in shorts and sleeveless shirts. But from the opening music and steamy scenes, this show is hot and makes me the same....Even though there may not be anything sexual going on in the show at a certain moment, the atmosphere is enough (and it's usually at night) to make you loosen your collar and wonder when your honey is coming home. I'm reminded of the movie Body Heat - the scene where he goes up to her house to see the chimes - the misty night air, the slight, hot, humid breeze making the chimes sound....this is the feeling I get from the atmosphere of the show.  With all this, the acting is excellent. You have Sookie who finds herself being accepted for who she is (a clairavoyant) by all things a gorgeous vampire, Bill.  Both of these actors, in real life, are English (I believe) and if you see them in interviews have lovely English accents and yet do a wonderful lazy southern Louisiana drawl.  On a sociological level, I find it very interesting to think that a subculture like vampirism could be on the verge of acceptance by general society. Some humans, of course, want nothing to do with them.  You can form your own parallels in our own society, I know I have. (And now you have a shapeshifter - makes you wonder who we're sharing the planet with).They can't be all bad if they're willing to drink \\"true blood\\", a synthetic drink they can drink in public and be out to dinner with friends. There's a lot to like about this show and I'll be buying the DVD of the first season as soon as it's out. I don't usually buy TV shows.as it's out. I don't usually buy TV shows.
B001EN71CW|3.0|Although I love the show, the Blu-Ray release stinks. They didn't improve the picture quality much at all so you might as well stick with the DVD set if you have it. They did remix the sound to DTS but it's hardly worth $60.00. Another Fox Blu-Ray failure if you ask me.
B001GLYMK6|5.0|I read some of the reviews and almost chose not to watch this. I am glad that I did watch it. It was funny and very entertaining. The end was a little sappy but I would definitely watch it again and I recommend it to you. Both characters are likable and they have good chemistry together in the film.
B001BKG9SK|4.0|great concert, live version of Fat Old sun is amazing..., documentary is also interesting, one of the last Richards gigs...
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Wow...haven't seen movie this beautifully written in the longest time...very touching, amazing cinematography, amazing casts. Beautiful..just beautiful.
B001ED7C58|5.0|Rob's song \\"Never Think\\" is worth the price of the CD. I think  overall it had a good variety of songs and for the most part I loved it.
0230013880|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable -- this was given to us by friends and has become one of the favorites in our household.  The text has a fun cadence that makes reading it fun, and my one year old enjoys listening to it.  Eventually, I think she will enjoy the story, too.  The graphics are rich, and we find something new on each page each time we read it.
0385340990|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It took me a little while to get used to the format.  The entire story is told in the form of letters written by a dozen people post WWII.
B001IXSU8M|5.0|I was looking up Colby O'Donis and a Youtube box came up.  It was Just Dance by Lady Gaga!  I had never heard of this or her.  I pressed play and I fell in love with the song!  I immediately bought the song.  I anticipated her new CD greatly.  I bought the CD and I loved the<br />songs: Just Dance<br />  Paper Gangsta<br />  Starstruck<br />  Boys Boys Boys<br />BTW the rapper in Starstruck if you don't know is Flo Rida.
0765342294|5.0|[[ASIN:0765342294 Ender's Game]]<br /><br /> Orson Card Scott is an expert when it comes to science fiction. He knows how to attract young readers, like myself, to a good book. In Ender's game, he has a strong emphasis on children and in order for us to grasp the main idea, he shows things from their point of view.<br /> Card, now in his late 50's, has been fascinated by military strategies and crucial roles of leaders in an army ever since he was in high school. He has spent two years as a Mormon missionary in Brazil and attended Brigham Young University. The idea of the Battle Room came to him when he was 16, but he chose not to write about the story till years later.<br /> The book is all based upon the concept of games. All of the important concepts in the novel are interpreted on the idea of a game. The first way a game comes into the novel is \\"buggers and astronauts\\". This is a game played by Ender and his brother, Peter. All the kids in Ender's society, at the time, played the game. However, in Ender's case the game is more than it seems, because Peter hates Ender and beats on him upon the course of the game, so that Ender never wins. Later on, at Battle school, Ender faces two different types of games, the mind game he plays on the computer and the war games that he plays in the Battle Room. The final game is the greatest one Ender plays, where he is commander of the Third Invasion. He cannot sleep, his eating is scarce and he is forced to command the people he cares for (which causes the friendship bonds to break). The writer accomplishes a goal in this book by showing how sometimes, the playing of a game can have profound impact on life, and that the game can unexpectantly become reality.<br /> This book was very well-written and had much strength. One strength is the relationship between adults and children (respectively in this book). Although many times in the book the adults manipulate/control the children, sometimes the children take over. For example, Peter and Valentine, two kids, dominate the worldwide political systems through adults in their forums. This book has no weaknesses.
B000PFU7OO|4.0|Every song that was in the movie was here plus a few more.  I do wish they would have included the words to the songs as their Irish brogue is sometimes hard to make out. I found lyrics on the internet as interpreted by a person who must have also had trouble making out the brogue since there are many mistakes!
B00192KCQ0|4.0|Metallica's making a come back with their new album, some old school, some new school. About time.
B001F2W4Y2|3.0|This is certainly not any \\"breakthrough\\" or \\"different\\" sounding album  from AC/DC--it's more of the same, which is fine with me.    I thought it might be more blues-oriented like STIFF UPPER LIP, but it  sounds much like the tracks from BALLBREAKER.    Thanks to WalMart who heavily invested in promoting this CD and got it and the band a LOT of publicity--even the cover of Rolling Stone, their  first time!    I added 10 tracks to my iPod from BLACK ICE--the ones I left off don't matter because everyone's taste is different.    Again, this CD is nothing \\"special\\" and will be forgotten in a month, but it's nice to depend on the AC/DC sound!
B000001FKY|5.0|I think this was one of my first rock tapes, along with Aerosmith's \\"Permanent Vacation\\" and Great White's \\"Once Bitten Twice Shy\\". I loved this album top to bottom, for all the great songs it has, still today I have most of it on my IPOD and enjoy very much listening to them: Armageddon, Animal, Pour Some Sugar On Me are outstanding rock songs and the whole album is worthwile playing straight up. Catchy choruses, guitar riffs and great melodies for those few who haven't heard this album already, are in this great (for me their best) CD. Must have if you're born in the late 70's!!!

B000ZINGIK|5.0|Pretty much what all the positive reviews have said..I think this is the best effort put out by Tobias and one of the best albums of 2008 thus far. If you enjoy Rock,Metal, Power Metal, Prog Rock etc then you will have to get this album. It has all the elements of them. Production is superb all the contribution made are well worth the album alone.<br /><br />Musicians:<br />Tobias Sammet<br />Sascha Paeth<br />Eric Singer<br />Roy Khan<br />Jorn Lande<br />Michael Kiske<br />Bob Catley<br /> Henjo Richter<br />Kai Hansen<br />Amanda Somerville<br />Alice Cooper<br />Oliver Hartmann<br />Rudolf Schenker
B001ECQ75A|3.0|I would have liked a different actor as the mentor to the panda in this movie, but it was still a fair amount of fun and a good message. I was a bit disappointed in Dreamworks casting. Most families will enjoy it. The one voice that truly didn't seem to quite fit was Dustin Hoffman's. No offense to him but we needed someone who could have called Jack Black's panda, grasshopper. David Carradine would have been good in that role. Some may find Hoffman's high pitched complaints funny, it just didn't strike me that way. It is a fairly entertaining movie for the family. Good quality DVD with decent replayablity. If you enjoyed this catch \\"Mulan\\".<br /><br />CA Luster
0743290119|2.0|I truly looked forward to this, having thoroughly enjoyed The Devil Wears Prada.  This was incredibly weak.  I think that it had the makings of a decent story, but every single story line needed to be fleshed out, and all of the parts that were skipped from chapter to chapter should have been included.  She must have been under pressure to finish it, because this could not hold a candle to her previous work.
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|I am a very huge fan of the original \\"Journey of the Center of the Earth (1959)\\". In fact it is in my top five all time favorites so you can imagine from the ads I suspected this remake would be a real loser. Especially when I heard it was 3D. In all seriousness do you ever truly take the 3D movies serious? We did not watch it in 3D but I imagine we will at some point. After watching it with my wife we decided two things. We still like the original best, the second was this isn't a true remake. However, I mean that in the best terms. We actually found this version quite entertaining and not at all like the original and that we liked too. It doesn't try to be or beat the classic movie. Although you see some jewels, giant mushrooms, a dinosaur, et cetera, none of it feels or looks the same.<br /><br />Brendan Frasier (The Mummy), Josh Hutcherson (Jurassic Park III), and Anita Briem do a great job of acting in this movie and that really helps too. Look for a couple cute references in this movie to Josh's part in JP III. Good quality DVD with good replayability. I probably would have given it 3 and a half stars if I could but I don't feel bad about four. There aren't enough movies like this to suit me these days. As a kid I was spoiled by having lots of movies like this to watch. I kind of feel sorry for kids and families today because if they don't appreciate the classic versions, it's a wasteland out there for the most part. I recommend it for the whole family. If you enjoyed this catch \\"Stardust\\" and \\"The Forbidden Kingdom\\".<br /><br />CA Luster
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I was determined to resist HBO's True Blood, a Southern Gothicky romp through Bon Temps, Louisiana, where, thanks to the invention of synthetic blood, vampires have \\"come out of the coffin\\" to mainstream with humans. One such creature of the night is Bill Compton (Stephen Moyer), a 173 year-old reluctant vampire who has all the candor of a good heart but the physical attributes of the netherworld. Bill is enchanted by Sookie Stackhouse (Anna Pacquin), a waitress at Merlotte's, the town watering hole. Tormented all her life by the ability to read other people's thoughts, Sookie and Bill stare at one another across the crowded bar like Maria and Tony in their memorable scene from West Side Story, the world falling away before the two of them. Hopelessly attracted, yet fearful of Bill's bad boy side (after all, he is a blood-slurping vampire), Sookie vacillates, her heart telling her this is the one, her mind screaming, \\"Are you crazy? He's dead!\\" But- unexpected joy- she can't read his thoughts! Certainly, these two will never be able to gaze lovingly at one another across the breakfast table.<br /><br />As the opening credits suggest in Alan Ball's clever and ambitious series, the south harbors the gamut of human- and inhuman- behavior, superstition, faith, love, hate, folksiness and generosity, charm and the KKK, all God's children frolicking in a world both dark and light. While vampires lurk in the night, seductive in their dangerous otherness, humans range from good ol' boys to southern belles, a m&eacute;lange of the dramatic and the demure, the cast a surprising mix of eccentric and fascinating personalities: Sookie's brother, Jason (Ryan Kwanten), a relentless sex addict who loves a mirror almost as much as the willing ladies her pursues; the foul-mouthed, yet endlessly appealing Tara (Rutina Wesltey), as unable to govern her emotions as she is to cast out the \\"devil\\" who inhabits her soul; and Lafayette (Nelsan Ellis), a real scene-stealer, gay short-order-cum-\\"V\\"-dealer (the potent and coveted vampire blood) who owns his scenes, his talented barely contained by the small screen.<br /><br />Unfortunately for the incipient romance between virgin and vampire, a series of recent murders has focused the town on the vampires' tendency toward blood lust, although, as Bill informs local law enforcement, \\"Surely a vampire would have drained a body of every ounce of her blood.\\" Still, the residents of Bon Temps are reluctant to cast suspicion on one of their own. Bill's seduction of Sookie drives the series, but the town is filled with such a delightful mix of characters that, like \\"V\\", there is never enough. Highly addictive, like the one-step-behind law enforcement team who bicker from crime scene to crime scene, there is always another volatile contretemps to charm, amuse and shock the willing viewer. Pacquin is stellar in her portrayal of Sookie, Moyer barely one beat behind her performance and closing (fangs extended). I have been bitten. I willingly drank the vampire's patented Tru-Blood and freely admit: one taste of \\"V' isn't enough. I crave more.

B000VWYJ86|2.0|Not a bad thriller, but this film has two major problems:  First, it is filmed with a \\"modern\\" shaky effect that gets tiring after a while.  Second, there is (to my taste) a major scenario bug: without giving up the end, there is a moment when Bourne is on the phone with his worst CIA ennemy after Bourne managed to lure that guy and his minions out of their building on a false pretext. At that point, the super pro and efficient Bourne decides to tell his ennemy where he is, launching a 10 minutes chase episode. Why on earth would Bourne feel he has to give up his location ? There is \\"some\\" credibility (that is to say, if you agree to go along with the genre) in the rest of the movie, this kills it.
031606792X|1.0|The first three parts of the series was wonderful. I loved it. i couldn't want to find out what happened next...that is...until i read this one. If you love the series and haven't read this book yet, just stop there! This will just ruin the perfect picture in your mind of the twilight world. This was almost painful to read.
6305428042|5.0|My 5 year old grandson loved it as much as I did when it come out.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|This was a nice enough continuation of the series but seems to lack some of the polish one would equate with a film. Granted there is more time designated for plot evolution and a bigger budget for effects but it lacked the 'wow' factor.    That said, I enjoyed the plot, the effects, the fact there weren't commercials and that Jack O'Neill was back with the group (you can't ever have enough pithy humor or cake!). It was well worth the cost of admission for a dedicated SG1 fan.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Again, my wife and I enjoy yet the latest of Enya's music.  So, if you like Enya, you'll like this CD.  The music doesn't have a Christmas feel to it per se, however, the lyrics in some of the songs are obviously about Jesus.  The melody of the music is typical Enya and perfect for any season, not just Christmas.  The last song of the CD is obviously Silent Night, but that's the exception.  And oh, a bit of a surprise, the first time we've heard Enya use an electric guitar in one of her songs.<br /><br />Amazon once again came through and had this to us on the 11th of November 2008 as promised.  We're thrilled with the price and awesome as usual delivery of Amazon.  Thank you!
0618001905|5.0|There are few stories that shock you with horror and this is one of the stories that make you wonder about greed and inhumanity of men. The grounds one of Africa's largest region was granted continue to this day(we all remember democracy for Iraq)was to end the Islamization of the Congo but the reality was for Leopold to exploit as he want through summary executions, looting, deforestation, hanging, amputations of African women, men and children.     Leopold's personal rubber planations caused the lives of millions of Africans with granted immunity from western democracies and the Congolese paid with their land, lives and culture. The Congo has always been a place the west value due to its raw materials and the Author has written a book with an array of characters that are humanly flawed, yet honest about the basic universal laws toward others.     i was amazed that the coined term \\"crime against humanity\\" was first used/written by an African American, who is a generation removed from Amerian slavery. The silence of Christianity, the model of Kutz and task achieved by the author truly bring written history to life.      The author has written a book that illustrate to the world that silence is always ground for future horrors. In fact, the horrors' victims have mostly been people from the southern hemisphere but we must understand in an interdependent society that every soldier of terrorist regime or colony eventually will return home and to some extent practice their craft in their original community.
B000LF73ZE|4.0|\\"The Reader\\", like a fine play, evolves over three acts.    In Act I, 15-year old student Michael Berg falls for an anonymous older woman who he later learns is Frau Hanna Schmitz.  She helps him as he falls ill on the way home from school and he is so touched by her gentle and quiet deameanor that he continues to visit her.  This love affair is more than physical and they connect deepest when Michael reads to the illiterate Hanna.  He reads classic novels, philosophical essays and poetry.  The prose Bernard Schlink uses to describe the blossoming love affair is tender and deeply affective.    In Act II, the startling revalation that Frau Schmitz was guilty of several war crimes as a member of the Nazi party - specifically causing the death of many women and children at various concentration camps.  A startled Michael sits through every day of the trial in disbelief - right up to her conviction of life imprisonment.    Act III finds a broken Michael - divorced after 5 years and leaving a young daughter behind. He has never gotten over Hanna and she haunts him still. He begins to record full novels on cassettes and mails them to her jail.  Upon learning she may be released early - after 18 years imprisonment - he meets with her again.  She is now a quiet old woman and he no longer a boy.  The ending is both tragic and just as the questions of life & death and morale beliefs are strained.    I can only hope Stephen Daldry's film with Kate Winslet and Ralph Fiennes can carry even a little of the emotional energy brought forth in this moving novel.
1416562605|5.0|A wonderfully wry tale of the other India, the Darkness that envelops the poor beyond the lights of Bombay and New Delhi. Impossible to put down. Might well come to be regarded as a twenty-first century classic. I began with the audio version, and I recommend it highly. The reader is absolutely first-rate. But I decided I had to have the hard copy, too, so that I could savor favorite passages.
0452289963|5.0|This was a most worthwhile read.  As others more knowledgable on the subjects Tolle covers have pointed out, the book certainly is not perfect and to some is merely a rehash of principles that they are already well aware of.  However, for someone like me, who stumbles upon this book front and center aisle at Target while the kids are checking out the pc games, it is a breath of fresh air whose positives greatly outweigh its negatives.  I don't expect complete synthesis with any non-fiction work.  (If I want a perfect read, I'll read Emily Bronte).  With a book like this, I am looking for something, anything, to enlighten or illuminate or stir or enhance or give some kind of guidance in a positive direction to what goes on in my mind and in my interaction with others.  We all know that feeling; when something we see or read has a  profound effect.  If it is just one sentence or one page, it will have been worth the read.  This book achieves that effect many times over.    One thing of note; this book was definitely written by someone who does not speak English as their native language.  Doesn't matter how well one learns a language; if it's not your native tongue there will inevitably be subtle nuances that are lacking.  For a book like this, maybe that is a good thing because there is no clouding of the issue with elaborate or artful phrasing.  Some passages come across rather bluntly.  Perhaps this bluntness is misinterpreted by some as a lecturing style of pompousness or self-righteousness.  I saw neither of the two; to me the book was simply observation after observation.  And some of the observations were truly eye-opening, such as the idea that \\"man made God in his own image\\" - what a potent observation!  Also, Tolle's advice to avoid dealing with and looking at others in the context of roles, and more so as fellow human beings instead.  There is no denying the validity of advice like this.    I really don't know much, if anything, about Buddhism or Hinduism.This book made me want to learn more.  Tolle has great respect for the world's religions, and he successfully points out their interconnectedness to each other.  We truly are all members of the same species.  I really appreciated his insights into Jesus Christ's teachings, not just on a religious level for me as a Christian but on a much broader level for us as human beings.  I don't know what or any religion Tolle practices, but it didn't matter.  Much of the wisdoms of the world's religions transcend their own followers and are beneficial to all.    Again, some or all of this may have already been covered by others, but for me Tolle laid it out quite nicely and I am grateful for it.    The ideal way to read this book is once through, and then a second time with a highlighter, noting passages and insights that you find inspiring or thought-provoking.  That makes it easier to go back and experience the best the book has to offer whenever you \\"need\\" to, so to speak.
B000NA28I4|2.0|Somehow the producers made out of a great book just another Disney movie. They somehow intelligently integrated the long story into a short movie but it ended up to be very superficial with a lot of unnatural Schmalz. The acting feels often very unnatural, actually most of the time.
B0016Q2D5M|2.0|Journey to the Center of the Earth is directed by an Oscar winning visual effects artist, and it shows. The movie looks amazing. And that's about it. The writing is plodding, predictible and as stale as the air in an underground cave.     The actors do their best to bring charm and freshness to the film, but its like performing CPR on a day-old corpse. The characters say and do things that a baboon with two brain cells to rub together wouldn't do, just to further the abysmal screenwriting and set the movie up for director Eric Brevig's strong point; the visual effects.    And Brevig does a good job with the visuals, the underground terrarium is a sci-fi wonderland, although the dinosaurs look a little lame. But if there's one thing that's been proved over and over, its that gorgeous CGI makes a good video game, but not a good movie.     I couldn't help comparing this to Brendan Fraser's 10-year-old action adventure, The Mummy. The CGI in The Mummy was cutting edge for its time, and its still looks fine. But the writing is witty, the characters are engaging, the whole thing is livelier and more memorable because someone put some effort into the storytelling.  Ultimately, that's what adds more depth to a movie about a reanimated 3000-year-old corpse than in The Journey to the Center of the Earth.
1593080255|1.0|As was the case with quite a few other readers, I had been snookered into believing this was a near-universally lauded classic.  Hello?  The emperor has no clothes and this book has no redeeming qualities.  The writing style was absolutely maddening!<br /><br />The only reason I read the entire thing was because I purchased the book and felt compelled to get my money's worth (not entirely possible with such a low quality \\"classic\\")<br /><br />After reading it in its entirety, I felt the type of satisfaction one feels after completing a particularly odious chore.  Removing my copy from my home will be most satisfying.  Bottom line:  Boooooooooooooring!
0060531053|5.0|This is the first book I've bought on home brewing.  It's excellent!  Within about a week I bought my kit and brewed my first batch of beer.  I can't tell you how it tastes as it is still aging.  This book is very well put together and easy to read.  When I went to my local Home Brew Supply Store I was well prepared.  I would definatelty recommend it to another first-time brewer.  It's a great starter book.
B000255LNE|5.0|During my teen years, we didn't have the songs of Britney Spears and Fifty cent (I still can't tell who's who), but we listened to \\"one more night\\", and \\"groovy kind of love\\" by Phil Collins. We listened to real artists like Sade, Simply Red and others, who sang love songs, not self indulgent songs about their milk shakes and going to the candy shop.<br /><br />This album is a collection of love songs that were mostly written/co-written by Phil Collins and it is filled with lovely, touching words and moving music. Also, the album includes many great songs that never became hits such as: \\"Least you can do\\", \\"I've forgotten every thing\\", \\"tearing and breaking\\", \\"I can't stop loving you\\", and \\"if leaving me is easy\\".<br /><br />It's a must have album.
B001C3KCSY|1.0|In with the new fans and out with the old...    I don't care who likes change- this is definately not an album I can actually ENJOY cleaning my house to.    What a waste of an awesome voice... I loved the tennessee pervish twang of \\"the old Kings.\\"
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|This album has a collection of the blues' genius with other great talents; and lovely performances with Norah Jones, James Taylor, Willie Nelson, B.B. King, Van Morrison. My favorites are: \\"sorry seems to be the hardest word\\" with Elton John, and\\" Do I ever cross your mind\\" with Bonnie Raitt.<br /><br />A great album that can only be enhanced by listening to another wonderful collection: Ray Charles & friends
B00133KHCY|4.0|The title didn't attract me at first, but I read a few reviews of this movie and was intrigued.  After watching it, I found it to be a wonderful (if predictable at times) story, with elements of Oliver Twist and a moving story of love, betrayal, the search for love, love found, and a happy ending.  Those are all the elements I need to be completely satisfied with a movie! I actually rented this movie, then after seeing it, went and bought it on Blu-ray, so that was another sign that it's one of my favorites.  There's a lot of weaving of past events with present, with wonderful performances (especially a contained one by Robin Williams).  I highly recommend it.
B001EYGOEM|2.0|Very disappointed...Still the same teenage melodrama...we all get that he broke up with you and you hate but you still love him...I was hoping for a more mature cd. I would have to say that the first cd has way better song writing and vocals...

Heafy sounds like James from Buttallica on some songs, then trys to sing a different way on other tracks. Come on Heafy, be yourself and sing how you want! The whole album (yet again) Heafy sings like he's the frontman of \\"Hinder\\", come on! I thought this was Metal!<br /><br />2. After track six, you might as well turn off the CD cause nothing good comes after song six. It sounded like they were stretched thin on time and needed to pump out a few more songs. But, that has happened on every Trivium CD so far, so I sort of suspected that, but Shogun has more garbage songs.<br /><br />3. Bring back the sound of \\"Accendency\\"! That was by far their best album. Nowdays they are trying so hard to become the next big thing, or the next Metallica. \\"The Crusade\\" was complete garbage and I threw it out my window after the first few songs.<br /><br />So, I was really nervous when I heard that Shogun was coming out. When I got it, I closed my eyes and inserted it into the CD player, and here are the reasons it rocks.<br /><br />1. The screaming is back.<br /><br />2. The screaming is back.<br /><br />3. The screaming is back.<br /><br />If the screaming wouldn't have came back, this album would have been another abomination like the Crusade. Now, there are some good tracks that get you pumped up enough to punch babies in the face, but Trivium are still slowly spining out of control in a downward spiral. The guitar solos are not that impressive as they used to be, the drumming is still the exact same, you can finally hear the bass player though on this album, but the music is still not solid enough for me. In a few more years Trivium will either sound like \\"Nickelback\\" with their butt rock vocals that Heafy always bellows out, or they'll sound like a Guns and Roses tribute band. Sorry, but I speak the truth!
B000OCXFCO|1.0|I had written off Megadeth after hearing Risk and decided not to hear anymore new music from them. Then being inspired by the election of a new president that I'm unhappy with I was reminded of Dave's lyrics on some of their songs off CTE. And that got me wondering, what do they sound like now anyway? It seems that no one can put out anything even reasonably fresh or original anymore. Same here. And the less said about Cristiana's pop emo vocals on what was a fairly good song the better. Like the new pres, this one's an obamination.
B001F7MSFM|3.0|I'm a HUGE fan of Hellboy, and though there are lots of special effects, I sadly found the dialogue in HBII third rate.  Where did all the great one-liners go?  Red is reduced to a whiny, p-whipped, crybaby in this over-produced sequel.<br /><br />Remember in HBI: \\"Gonna be sore in the mornin'\\", \\"First date, no tongue..\\", \\"But, I didn't get you anything\\", \\"How big could it be?\\"...<br /><br />And in HBII, since Father is dead, and Agent John Meyers was not signed on for the movie, the beauty of their interactions and balance is gone.<br /><br />Tom Manning now is bounced back and forth; I like Hellboy and we are friends, to, I despise Hellboy but am scared of him.  Totally unconvincing!<br /><br />And a new character is introduced; Johann Krauss.  The most obnoxious character since Jar Jar Binks!

1416562605|4.0|When I got this book, a notation on the cover said \\"Short listed for the Man Booker Prize.\\"  I was not surprised at all to hear that this enjoyable novel won the prize.  I have to disagree with the reviewers who said the author was simply pandering to Western prejudice; frankly, I didn't think the portrayal of Western culture was all that flattering, either!  (And I honestly laughed out loud when he attributed part of the problem to Westerners' addiction to cell phones.)    I work for a company that uses India-based subcontractors for some of its work, and I often train these employees via the Internet, rising especially early in the morning to catch them at the end of their work day (just as described by the book's white tiger, Balram).  For better or for worse, I will assuredly never look at these training sessions quite the same way after reading \\"The White Tiger.\\"  A readable, entertaining, thought-provoking book.
0375826726|1.0|No, this book is perhaps the worst fantasy book that I have ever read. I actually thought the first book Eragon was a decent read, a nice story. Eldest was the beginning of the end. Paolini started making some terrible choices in writing style, vocabulary, and motive. The entire story got lost in the drivel.    Brisingr picks up where Eldest was clearly headed, into a complete writing disaster. It was too much too soon for this young Author.  He started with a good story then started trying way too hard. This book is everything that you don't want a novel to be. It has absolutely no voice, no flow to the story. It is explained and not told.      I love the story of Paolini, homeschooled and with his family throwing all of their love and finances into his writer's dream.   And they had a good story and a fairly decent world.  Brisingr is just a disaster. Is it wrong of me to hate this book?  I'm sorry to say I do. It's awful. Nice cover though.

B00002DE2L|2.0|I bought this recording because Anne-Sophie Mutter's Autumn on her Meditation CD is so lovely -- but that version, as it turns out, was conducted by Von Karajan. The playing on this version is brilliant, but it's just too brilliant for me: the attack is so loud and aggressive that I couldn't settle down and enjoy the music nor even listen to the whole thing. The big lesson for me is to buy versions of her recordings in which she herself is not the conductor. I plan to donate this one to the local library and get the complete Von Karajan version. But in no way is this bad playing. It's just a matter of taste. If you like loud, flashy music, you will love this recording.
B000W9DTG6|5.0|Although I had read reviews before buying stating that Ocean's 12 wasn't so hot, I enjoyed all three and am glad I bought the set. Great packaging and good movies.
B000GW8OAA|4.0|This movie is sweet.  Do not expect this movie to be a cinematic classic, it is fun, just because that is what it was made for.  Entertaining and the extra features on the HD disc are cool too.  It has nice rides and excellent racing scenes.  Aside from most movie crticism, it is fun to watch with friends.
B000Y9Q59W|4.0|The film is a cornerstone for the 80's decade, as it embodies the excessive greed that was typical of this time period. The film was watched on a 42\\" Panasonic Plasma and BD30K Blu-Ray player. The PQ was not excellent, especially in darker scenes-it contained significant grain and noise, but adequate to enjoy as a hi-def film-3.5/5. The AQ was not overwhelming, but sounds and music were correct for each seen, strong throughout-4/5. Overall quality of transfer for picture and sound 3.5/5.<br /><br />The ambitious Bud Fox rises to the top under the guidance of a ruthless business man who cuts corners and cuts throats to get ahead. The materialism often documented in the 80's appears full throttle, and all characters in the film, except the token reminder of morality-Bud's Dad, are all infected with the greed. The film is an interesting portrayal of the time period, but also how a person's character can become compromise. The average person could fall prey to glitz and glamor of this \\"no limits\\" life style.<br /><br />In Stone's typical stylistic manner, he executes the film and story arc of the rise and fall of Bud Fox in a well timed manner. In the end Gecko still prevails, despite of his tactics, but it is Bud who saves his father's company, albeit inadvertently being punished for the route the initially chose.<br /><br />I was in my teens in the 80's, and the decade holds a certain fascination for me. The film is one of my favorites of the era, and is definitely worth seeing. It is not crushed by the same over the top humor and kitch that is present in some of the more light-hearted 80's films, but instead is a more conscious-grabbing serious character examination of the era, and the effect on character that limitless \\"aquisition\\" of materialism can cause.<br /><br />The film is still relevant today, as it seems this greed is still present in our society, and has become an accepted norm and side effect of our capitalistic society. Performances are solid throughout and further/introduce careers of interesting actors, including James Spader.interesting actors, including James Spader.

B001EYGOEM|2.0|With the release of her first single, \\"Tim McGraw\\", Taylor Swift was a refreshing new young artist with a pure sound.  As her singles progressed, she never improved vocally, but her songs remained insanely catchy.  On \\"Fearless\\", Taylor Swift does nothing to establish herself as an artist that can be taken seriously.  The songs are all formulaic, cutesy, and have lyrics along the lines of teenage melodrama that is all too familiar for her.  Upon listening to these new songs, it is difficult to distinguish not only one from the other, but a few from tunes on her old album.  She just doesn't quite have the pipes to impress and her songwriting doesn't make up for the deficiency.  Don't get me wrong, Taylor Swift is a beautiful, great role model for young girls everywhere.  One just gets the feeling that her label is trying to sell out now.
B0013URJTG|5.0|Wilson can write some catchy stuff. Very stunning hi-rez recording in surround...atmospheric, then at once loud and in your face. This was way out of my musical tastes, but I am glad I checked them out. Many people were buzzing about them so I had to see what was up....glad I did! Challenging at first, but worth repeated listening sessions.
0684867621|4.0|I don't always like Stephen King (he's a superb storyteller, but many of his endings just kill me), but I LOVED this book. It's not a typical King novel.<br /><br />I found the story to be remarkable. It is about a journey into strength and survival of a young girl that gets lost in the woods. Through her struggles, she ponders her current family dynamics. Her parents have divorced. Her brother and mom can't get along.<br /><br />This young girl sees herself as the peacemaker for everyone. Indeed, she is one tough cookie! I adored her. As she ponders her problems, and fantasizes about her crush on Tom Gordon, it is clear that one great message of the story is about the truly important things in life. In the end, I just knew that the little girl's family understood what was important in life...as did I.
B001FEO6PK|5.0|It's been 12 years since Jason has released any material (for obvious reasons of ALS), but it was so worth the wait for these 3 new songs!! The Rivers of Longing are amazing songs which could have easily fit on Perspective. They are very melodic & deep, just like any Becker fan is used too. Electric Prayer for Peace is another amazing song which has ssoooo much going on. It's sort of like mixing Tribal with a movie score. As for the rest of the songs, they're all great picks; though honestly every song by Becker is amazing and deserves to be on here. My only quarrel is that there should be more than 13 tracks! That & Concerto is not on here.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|Let's get the bad out of the way here...as others have noted, this collection does not include any SACDs. Whomever is responsible for this should be sacked and shame on Warner or anyone else responsible. I would not have purchased this if I'd known this in advance. When I look at my account at the item shipped, it still shows that I was shipped SACDs. This is false advertising.<br /><br />Now the good...if you have a hybrid player and an amp that supports SACD, more than likely you can also play the DTS 96/24 5.1 mix. Again, when I bought this, it did not mention the 96/24 aspect.<br /><br />Trust me, once you've heard this mix, you'll forget all about the SACD. It might be better, it might not, but for most ears, it really would not make a difference, and with the DVD version, you get the extra live footage. You also get the Lamb live slide show while it plays, along with stills and some grainy live video from that tour. That is a wonderful treat.<br /><br />But beyond the extras, it is the sound of the original recordings. The Dolby Digital is fine, but for my ears, the DTS 96/24 is exceptional. I hear everything I'm used to hearing, though with far greater definition and I also hear things I never heard before. This is especially true of backing vocals, percussion, nylon guitar and subtleties that were either too far back or simply lost in the wash. There is also the added bonus of no distortion on the mellotron, which was always there on the vinyl, except, perhaps for the first listen.<br /><br />I would suggest not buying this box if you cannot take advantage of the DTS 96/24 5.1 sound. I won't even bother with the stereo mixes. If you've got the gear, this is a great thing to own. It blows every other version you've heard away.
B000ATQYT2|4.0|This is an amazing rendition of the classic &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; story, with an incredible performance from Michael Caine.  Every time I watch it, as an adult, I get something new out of it.  And the old version, with the sad song included, was enough to make a grown man cry (a true Grinch-like story that happened at my house!).<br /><br />I, too, am wistfully wishing that Disney would release a ***COMPLETE***, WIDESCREEN version of this incredible classic.  I bet they'd be shocked at how many copies they would sell!<br /><br />I am a grown woman, not a kid, and this is my very FAVORITE Christmas movie!  Maybe the sad song is a bit TOO sad for some children, at certain times, in certain situations, but that's what the fast forward button is for!  And if Disney were really smart, they would just add an option so that one could either play the movie WITH that chapter or WITHOUT that chapter.  Simple solution!<br /><br />I'm hoping that the people at Disney will read this review, and understand that the ADULTS are clamoring for this film -- it's not just for the kids!
B001F2W4Y2|3.0|How can we score this album?  Songwriting 3.  Guitars 4  Bass, Drums 4  Vocals 2  AC/DC's history is carved into 2 periods, Bon Scott, and Post Bon Scott (Brian Johnson).  I am of the older brigade, so I like Bon Scott. I know that many younger people grew up with Brian's voice and Back in Black. So right up front I have made my bias clear. I have always thought that AC/DC would have been a better band with another vocalist. A lot of people disagree with me, and that's ok.  I think that with this album the vocals have been reduced into the mix a little too much at times, when at times they could have been right up front pounding away with the guitars, bass and drums.  For me, there is a certain lack of vocal power, and little of the old strutting alpha male climax in the delivery.  Some of the songs are quite strong, and I particularly like, Rock n Roll Train, War Machine, Smash n Grab, Stormy May Day, and Rock n Roll Dream. These are the songs that evoke a sense of menace, of power and force. the best AC/DC songs give you an adrenaline rush. The Guitar riffs are clean and tough.  The irony of this album should not be lost on AC/DC, the guitar  playing is extremely well executed and powerful, the rhythm full  and true.  However, somewhere out there is a young rock/metal vocalist who could lift some of these songs into the stratosphere.  I still enjoy AC/DC, though in smaller doses these days.  I give this album 3 and a half stars (7/10).

B001GQ2TGA|3.0|I have always really liked Enya, and when I pre-ordered this, CD I anticipated something truly remarkable - her normal standard.  In all honesty, to my ears, this CD just does not make the grade.  The fact that I have always really liked Enya is why I didn't give a 2-star rating.    After I opened the package containing the CD an hour ago and gave it a listen, I was disappointed.  While none of the songs is just plain bad, none of them, with the exception of \\"My My Time Flies!\\" and \\"Oiche Chiuin\\" is particularly interesting or memorable.

B001G9LVGG|5.0|I have always disliked Christmas/Holiday music as such, as it always seemed soupy, commercial and pretentious, particularly the overtly Christian variety.  I was delighted to find a complete lack of such qualities in this recording.    From a critical standpoint, this is music that is well-chosen for the season even though it is good for other times as well. As well, an air of excellence and attention to detail in all aspects is readily obvious. It is expertly adapted, arranged, and performed by some outstanding musicians.    Excepting her first recording, I have every recording Loreena McKennitt has ever made, and I have never been disappointed; you will not be either.

B001EYGOEM|4.0|Good, honest pop is the kind of thing that only comes out once in a while, the kind of pop that isn't mass-produced by some anonymous Oz-like Swedish svengali or popped out by some sort of marketing beast. I was hesitant to declare Taylor Swift anything but just another commercialized teen trying to make a novelty buck when her country-ish debut came out in 2006 and songs like the get-back-at-your-ex anthem \\"Picture To Burn\\" and the sappy \\"Teardrops On My Guitar\\" became ubiquitous. Fearless, however, is just the kind of pop record that is about as real as pop can get: earnest, memorable, deliberate, and just as catchy as anything else you're likely to hear nowadays.<br /><br />Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the record is Swift herself; unlike many pop idols her age, she is not some big-hearted daddy's girl or a rebellious wannabe sex symbol; she's just your normal teenager with some serious boy problems and a penchant for writing unnaturally talented songs. Lyrics like \\"in your life you'll do things / greater than dating the boy on the football team / but I didn't know it at fifteen\\" from \\"Fifteen\\" and \\"but she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts / she's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers\\" from \\"You Belong To Me\\" are not only fantastic in the context of the song but also show Swift's unerring ability to describe the teenage experience (her experience, in other words), without sounding contrived and fake. And even on some of the clunkers, like the awfully sappy \\"Forever and Always,\\" Swift's vocal skills and obvious charisma hide some of her shallower sentiments.<br /><br />For what Nashville no doubt considers their newest and brightest star, there's a heck of a lot more pop than country here, and although some fans might miss the twangier side of Swift, she without doubt belongs in a more mainstream arena. There's the occasional backwoods violin and pedal-steel guitar, and Swift can mimic the best of Nashville, but for the most part the music is perfectly suited to Swift's subtle, careful pop style. The instrumentation is sharp and accompanies Swift well without overwhelming her, and the hooks are what you would expect from a person who's already sold over three million.<br /><br />Then again, don't come to Fearless looking for anything musically mind-blowing, as the slick radio production is engineered to produce hits and is about as deep as a puddle. The spotlight here is squarely on Swift, and so on the few parts where Fearless falters, such as the pedestrian duet with Colbie Caillat and the too-cheesy-for-its-own-good closer \\"Change,\\" it's usually because Swift isn't focusing on her strengths: namely, boys, breakups, teenage life, or all three.<br /><br />That's not to say Swift is a one-trick pony; what Fearless has definitely proved, if nothing else, is that she's the real deal when it comes to solid songwriting and an assured knowledge of her target audience.

0756404746|3.0|This book took me on quite a ride.        The prologue read like a high school creative writing assignment, with prose like, \\"and he moved with the subtle certainty that comes from knowing many things.\\"       The first chapter, thankfully, moved into the story itself without too much more flowery preamble, and away I went.       The story begins as typical fantasy, something is wrong in the world and we don't know what or why. We're given glimpses of the evil machinations, and as such provides adequate incentive to keep turning the pages.       As events unfold, we discover that the whole purpose of our second main character was to provide a reason for the first main character to tell the story of his life. At this point, I felt my skepticism struggling to break free again, but I calmed it and continued.       When parents are killed by dark forces and the sole surviving prodigy son vows revenge, well, we've certainly been here before but at this point I felt I had developed what I think was the proper approach to this book. That is, as one would approach one of those run of the mill action movies.       Once in this mindset, the book was actually quite enjoyable. Yeah, the main character was some kind of superhero with his unsurpassed intellect and aptitude for everything. Yeah, his love interest was this 'free spirit' that would make the most obnoxious decisions at every turn. And yeah, the rest of the supporting cast is reminiscent of Harry Potter.       Despite all that, by approaching the book the way I did, I was able to really enjoy it. It was entertainment and a 'fun' story. It takes no risks and brings nothing new to the table but still remained enjoyable.       I must make one formal complaint though, when you set the stage the way this author chose -- dumping us into a world with talk of looming danger -- there is a certain implied agreement made between the author and the reader. It is this: when the end comes, we will feel more informed about the world we were introduced to. Not completely informed, but enough to feel like we're a part of it and have some stake in its future.       In this, the book fails miserably. In fact, you learn nearly nothing about the little spider thing that is presented as the first conflict in the book by the end.       All in all, this book is a giant prologue to a greater story that we have yet to be made privy to, and I think that while the author will lose a lot of readers who were looking for greatness, he will still retain the readers that read for a simple escape from reality. By virtue of this, he will be likely be given a chance to bring the story into fruition, hopefully before readers lose patience with him.

B0013FNC38|4.0|I just climbed from under my rock....  I had no idea who Jason Mraz was...  It was on my Amazon recommended list.  I listen to the samples and decided to give it a try.  Talking about surprise....  WOW!!!!  Unlike most, I like \\"I'm Yours\\" but that's not the best cut.  I'm not sure that alone would have cause me to buy this CD.  But the wicked \\"The Dynamo of Volition\\", soulful \\"Only Human\\", the jazzy \\"Coyotes\\", and lets not forget \\"Make It Mine\\"...  are steaming HOT!!!  Honestly it's easier for me to list which songs I don't like, actually, there aren't any fillers on here.  If you're looking for a compilation of one particular genre, this may not be your cup of tea.  But if you like your music with some folk-funk-jazz-pop-chill, this is the sha-hizzle!!!
031606792X|1.0|Breaking Dawn was definitly not the best book the the Twilight series.  Jacobs part in the book was too long, drawn out, and overall boring.  THe only thing that I could think when I was reading that part was 'Go away Jacob, I want Edward!'  Stephine Meyer made the Twilight Series to seem as though you was there in the book with Bella and Edward. In Breaking Dawn, I think that she made it TOO detailed for my liking and I kind of had a joy when it was over.  While the other three books are about Edward protecting Bella, Breaking Dawn was about the baby that Bella conceives while she is still human with Edward, and her struggle with having the vicious half human vampire baby.  Edward isn't as sweet, and I didn't feel the same way during the reading as I did with Twilight. There is less romance between the two then any other book.  Some part are confusing, some are boring, there are a few exciting parts like their honey-moon and when Bella finally becomes a vampire.  Oh well, I hope that the movie will be better then Breaking Dawn..
B0013FXWU6|3.0|THERE WILL BE BLOOD is a perfect example of the disconnect of Hollywood and its version of a \\"good\\" movie and what the American public will pay to go see. This movie was nominated for several awards, including best picture, and Daniel Day Lewis picked up the Best Actor Oscar for his portrayal of Daniel Plainview. Daniel Plainview is an oil man. He's an independant oil man and very persuasive at getting land owners to let him drill on their land. Plainview gets word of a town that has tons of oil, and he heads there with his young son. Plainview convinces the town to let him drill on their land, and promises new roads and schools and much wealth for the people.<br /><br />This movie is all about Daniel Plainview, his son, and the person he truly is. As the movie progresses, Daniel Plainview doesn't change, he just reveals what kind of person he is. The movie is based on the novel OIL, by socialist Upton Sinclair, yet the movie contains no political message against big oil or big business. Plainview's primary adversary in the movie is Eli Sunday (Paul Dano), a pastor of a small church in the town. While the church's beliefs are anything but mainstream, the movie has really nothing to say about religion.<br /><br />This is a movie made in Hollywood for Hollywood. I'll admit I enjoyed Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of Daniel Plainview. In the film, Plainview looked exactly like a 1980s Tom Selleck. I also enjoyed the scenery and early 20th centurey setting. For the first twenty minutes of the movie, there is no dialogue. This is very unrealistic and shows that the filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson is trying to take the viewers out of the movie and notice the director.<br /><br />This is a well made movie with a good performance by Lewis. But it is also an overlong character study of a despicable man. I can see why this movie won awards, and I can also see why it was a box office failure. (According to Box Office Mojo, ranked 66th in 2007, just behind WATER HORSE: LEGEND OF THE DEEP.)

I'll give you some of my own. A doctor tried to talk me into a hernia operation. Coincidentally, I saw another doctor a week later. He checked me and said that I didn't have a hernia and that I should never go back to that doctor. Hello, in other words, I was going to pay for that doctor's swimming pool!<br /><br />In the US the incentive for doctors is to perform more and more operations, not to keep people well (as in other countries).<br /><br />My nephew went to see a find doctor at a major medical center, but the doctor refused to diagnose or treat my nephew. Actually, he was doing my nephew a favor because if he had tested him or treated him, he would not have been able to get long-term care insurance. He went out and got the insurance, and had to wait a year to go back to see the doctor! The waiting period!<br /><br />I had to wait 90 days to get coverage with a new job. In the meantime, I was coughing all over my students.<br /><br />Let us all agree to this American creed: No American should lose their home or life savings simply because they get sick. How can anyone disagree with that?<br /><br />The American middle class had better wake up. Regardless of whether you have health insurance or not, you are only one or two diseases away from loosing our life savings and homes. National health insurance is the only answer, taking the best from the other countries that have it (and have a longer life expectancies--we rank 42).<br /><br />Those who oppose national health insurance should do the honorable thing and turn down Medicare as a matter of principle. American cancer survival rates are higher, but note the following:<br /><br />In response to an email that I sent, the Nation Cancer Institute said that \\"55.8 percent of all cancer cases are diagnosed in people 65 years and older.\\" So Medicare has a big input in those survival rates. Probably even a greater impact in hip replacements. So the argument that government health insurance results in poor quality care is bogus.<br /><br />Now quick, would you want to go to the Mayo Clinic, John Hopkins Medical Center, or a major VA hospital? ANSWER: THE VA PERFORMS BETTING IN ALMOST ALL AREAS. My two cousins love it.<br /><br />Don't believe the lies told about Canada. Sara Robinson, who has duel Canadian-American citizenship, refuted common myths told about Canadian health care in \\"Ten Myths about the Canadian Health Care System\\" (see internet).<br /><br />One of those great myths is that Canada's health-care system is \\"socialized medicine.\\" False: In socialized medical systems, the doctors work directly for the state. In Canada (and many other countries with universal care), doctors run their own private practices, just like they do in the US. The only difference is that every doctor deals with one insurer, instead of 150.<br /><br />The percentage of Canadians who'd consider giving up their beloved system consistently languishes in the single digits. A few years ago, a TV show asked Canadians to name the Greatest Canadian in history; and in a broad national consensus, they gave the honor to Tommy Douglas, the Saskatchewan premier who is considered the father of the country's health care system.<br /><br />It is both true and false that there are longer waits. It all depends where you live. For the vast majority of Canadians, it is not true, but true for a few.<br /><br />It is false that Canadians don't get to choose theirs own doctor.<br />Somebody, somewhere, is getting paid a lot of money to make this kind of stuff up. A bogus falsehood.<br /><br />Canadian drugs are not the same. This is more preposterous bogosity.<br />They are exactly the same drugs, made by the same pharmaceutical companies, often in the same factories. The Canadian drug distribution system, however, has much tighter oversight; and pharmacies and pharmacists are more closely regulated. If there is a difference in Canadian drugs at all, they're actually likely to be safer.<br /><br />It is false that publicly-funded programs will inevitably lead to rationed health care, particularly for the elderly. Sara Robinson calls this myth \\"False and bogglingly so.\\" \\"The papers would have a field day if there was the barest hint that this might be true.\\"<br /><br />Basic morality 101: No person should loose their home or life savings because they are sick.<br /><br />One of my readers is from Germany, and she worked at a private clinic in England. Their customers were wealthy Arabs, who could have come to the USA, but chose England. Why would they choose a so-called \\"socialist country\\"? Because England does not have socialized medicine--there are private hospitals, private doctors, and private insurance.<br /><br />You cannot argue with life spans in countries with universal coverage. Here they are (overall, male and female--females live longer). I am looking only at major countries.

0439023483|3.0|Hunger Games    Katniss Everdeen is the teen protagonist of \\"The Hunger Games.\\" Now if a heroine is named Kate or Cat or any variations, it seems to be literary law that she be spunky, quirky, tough and independent (but with a secret heart of gold).  And so it is here.  In the dystopian world she lives in, two youth are chosen from each \\"District\\" to engage in a fight to the death televised battle (think reality shows that result in fatalities) to win the Games and bring riches and honor to her family.  When her younger sister is chosen, Katniss volunteers to take her place.  The odds are against her, as some richer districts have been training their contestants since birth.  But Katniss is a skilled hunter and may have a few other advantages as well, including the alliance of another contestant from her own district who has had a lifelong crush on her.      While the book is a definite page turner with an engaging heroine, the Games themselves begin well and slide into absurdity, but then I tried to make sense of everything which was probably a mistake. The world presented has state-of-the art technology.  During the Games, those in charge have ability to manipulate the climate, broadcast exactly what's going on with the participants - even so the participants know who's died - and also send them supplies at a moment's notice (though they're supposedly out in the wilderness).  They can also genetically alter birds and animals, and have impressive medical advances.  Yet, at the same time, a certain percent of the population aren't permitted to use wheeled vehicles (cars, trains), must hunt and gather for their food, and use herbal remedies for serious health problems.  How this discrepancy came about is never addressed in depth, nor if it extends to the rest of the world.  The reader is simply supposed to accept things as they are, whereas in books like Lois Lowry's \\"The Giver\\" you get the impression the writer wants you to question things and probe further. Maybe that's an unfair comparision, but this book has gotten so much praise that I expected more.
B001C08RHA|5.0|This is one of the best superhero movies ever made so far. It has 5-star action, a 5-star story, and 5-star actors.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|We bought this movie while on vacation to watch as a family and it was excellent. If you are Indiana Jones fan as a kid (as I was) this was  great movie.  Beware there is a BIG snake and violence but the good guy always wins.  A wonderful roller coaster movie ride -  It was loved from all ages 7-65+.
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|Enya does it again with her unique sound and feel.. I was literally humming along to my ipod at work.. I don't do that for just anyone.    She creates beautiful music that you can play at weddings and funerals.  How many artists can do that?
006085880X|4.0|This was the first of a growing line of books I have been reading by Jodi Picoult. Out of all of them, this one was the one that really got me thinking.     Chris and Emily, the two main characters in the book, seem to have everything going for them. Loving/supporting family, a relationship with your best friend, good grades leading into college. Your left wondering why they would want to kill themselves.     This book focuses into the personal thoughts and experiences of a young high school girl that has hit the end of her rope. You slowly begin to realize that Emily has been so emotionally eaten by the time she dies, there was nothing anyone could do.     Chris loves her as much as any high school aged boy is capable of, yet becomes frustrated with her depressive persona. He almost appears to be uncaring and cold towards her many times in the book, but it also illustrated how Emily was having severe difficulty with something as simple as sexual maturity. Chris simply didn't understand.    Her destructive behavior becomes apparent to Chris who is too late to fix it. He is left with no choice but to become the best friend he has always been and be with her to the end.     Personally, I found this book to be touching.
1878424505|1.0|I dont know how enlightening this \\"toltec\\" wisdom is supposed to be. But this 168pg book doesnt seem to be doing it justice. It doesnt give enough reliable background on the Toltecs and just how much time the author studied it before becoming a \\"shaman\\". I did a little research on Mr.Ruiz and found out he does tours on Teotihuacan where the Toltec are said to have existed and it could be that he did this book inorder to attract more tourism or something. Or maybe not. But either way, this book just didnt convince me at all. I also read the Toltecs were around for about 2 or 3 centuries and to believe these four principles is what got them through alot, I just dont think so.
B000FA57N0|1.0|I waited for over 2 weeks to receive my order. Once in hand, the DVD would not play in my DVD player for HD, and it won't play on my computer, nor my husband's computer. It's a dud.

0446579939|4.0|I'm a huge Nicholas Sparks fan and the storyline was great...until the last chapter. It gets to a predictable turning point and abruptly ends, with a 3 page epilogue to fill you in. But be sure to reread the last few pages because you can miss details. Again, still a great story, just not to happy with the ending.

B001F290E4|2.0|I have always paid a lot of attention to Seal. After his debut album I consider him to be one of the most talented singers of the last couple years. I have to confess that his last CD - Soul is in my humble opinion a weak attempt at great songs. I didn't find the arrangements, cover treatment to be at the caliber of Seal himself. this guy can really sing, I  from his previous work, I know he has a musical soul. I have to agree with fellow reviewer, the CD was meant for elevator music... A shame... Hope he goes back to the roots...
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|After many years of loathing Coldplay to the uttermost, and letting it be known by quoting the \\"40 Year Old Virgin\\" line of \\"you know how I know you're gay...\\" to various fans, I now find myself in unison with those who adore this band. Viva La Vida is an awesome concept album. It is definitely a departure from their previous outings, but still just as sweet. The experimentation with new sounds and styles shows considerable growth and awareness of themselves and their abilities to make solid, meaningful music. At no time while listening to this album did I feel like they were employing their standard \\"Coldplay formula\\". This edition to their already stellar discography is fresh, imaginative, and considerably enjoyable to listen to. Whether just sitting around the house, or cruising down the highway one can't help but be pleased with what it is coming from the speakers. This one gets an A+ from me.

B001EYGOEM|5.0|Wow! This album is amazing. I dare say it's even better than the first. Taylor has really grown as an artist and a person and it shows in her songs.  It's hard to pick a favorite but I think mine would have to be \\"Hey Stephan\\".  But each song gives me goose bumps for a different reason and rings true in every aspect of life.  Its amazing that Taylor, having never met me or my friends, can reach us on so many levels. You have to go buy this album. The songs are inspirational, catchy, fun, tear-jerking, and real.  Everything a good song should be.

1594489505|3.0|I had no intention of reading this book because of the negative publicity surrounding Khaled Hosseini's previously published novel, The Kite Runner, and the movie based on it. I know some people who will not watch any movie with rape scenes. Unfortunately, I'm not that ideologically consistent, as my favorite director is Sergio Leone, and his films have a lot of rape scenes.<br /><br />In any event, a local Muslima was leading a book discussion group which was planning to talk about A Thousand Splendid Suns, so I decided to read it and participate.<br /><br />I should list reviews in major publications.<br /><br />  1. Christian Science Monitor, by Yvonne Zipp<br />  2. New York Times, by Michiko Kakutani<br />  3. London Times by Joan Smith<br />  4. Washington Post by Johnathan Yardley<br /><br />My first impression while reading this was its similarity to a film hindi, you know, where the twins are seperated at birth, one becomes an outlaw, the other a policeman, and both fall in love with the rich man's daughter, who is going to be married off to a politician, etc. Or an episode of Law and Order: Special Victims Unit, where the detectives' uncovering of one gruesome crime leads to the discovery of an even more gruesome crime.<br /><br />So the book is an unending tale of the woes of misogyny. And however cliche that may be, it does not change the fact that misogyny does cause a lot of damage in people's lives.<br /><br />In addition, the author actually tries to teach contemporary Afghani history through the characters' lives. In the author's retelling of events, the period of communist rule in the 1970s-1980s, comes out looking the best, at least from the vantage point of Kabul. And while the Taliban come out looking bad, the previous mujahideen factions also come out looking bad. While a lot of this is old news to most Muslims who have followed Afghanistan for the last 30 years, the discussion group participants in Augusta, GA remarked that, despite the fact that U.S. forces have been deployed in Afghanistan for nearly 7 years, they learned a lot from this aspect of Khaled Hosseini's book.<br /><br />One concern I have is whether Khaled Hosseini whitewashes the current government of Afghanistan. My understanding is that it relies so much on the anti-Taliban warlords that life for most Afghanis has improved marginally. Has misogyny decreased since the Taliban left Kabul? What about Malalai Joya, who has been suspended from the Afghani parliament for speaking against its warlords? In addition to her June 2007 interview on Democracy! Now, she was featured in a [wideangle] episode which aired in September 2007. Economic improvement has occurred through the increase of opium production.<br /><br />The novel has an obvious anti-Pushtun bias. And it seems as if this is how the ongoing conflict in Afghanistan is shaping up, with primarily Pushtun Taliban controlling areas of the south and primarily non-Pushtun militias ruling in various northern and western provinces and taking part in the weak central government. In this regard, the novel fails to achieve the uplifting ending it portrays through the individual character of Laila because there is no approaching of consensus towards a less misogynistic, more ethnically and religiously tolerant society.<br /><br />Having said all that, the novel is an easy read, and there is a plot twist that I did not expect. Most of the people who attended the discussion group said the novel was better than Kite Runner. So I'd say it's a good vacation read.

0143038419|1.0|In real life, I try to like everybody or find something likeable about everybody I spend any amount of time with.  If I met the author, I would run in the opposite direction.  If you're lonely, depressed, or going through a difficult time and cannot get a publisher's advance to travel the world for a year to come to terms with your problems (in other words, if you are anybody but the author), then this book won't be helpful.  A little practical advice on dealing with the same problems would have been welcome, but practicality seems to be one of the few words Gilbert is unfamiliar with.
B00127RAJY|2.0|I have six kids and have, in total, lost about 325 pounds. I wouldn't say I'm an expert, but I'm practical. I don't want to waste my time and I want results fast. Jillian does work you hard, but the workout is so boring.  I am obviously very disciplined, but this item found a pretty spot on my shelf after about a week. On a whim I purchased Women's Health Magazine's \\"Workout in Ten\\" with Amy Dixon. This became the DVD by which I judged all other exercise DVD's. My second favorite: the weight portion of Amy's \\"Perfect Body Workout.\\" I love the compound movements and her powerful positive talk in all three of her DVDs. \\"You're pretty and powerful, you know it\\" and \\"We're all short of time so let's get it done,\\" and my favorite \\"Add a little sas when you're ready.\\" There are no cheaters on her DVD. They are all real women with real bodies. Now I have rented exercise DVD's from about 15 instructors and the only other instructor who comes close to Amy Dixon is Amy Bento. Jillian is obviously good for some, but I don't see why she has a top selling video.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|Our story centers around Po the Panda (voiced by Jack Black).  He is a Kung Fu legend.  Evildoers fear him and the people adore him.  The Fearsome Five long to fight with him.  And everything...hold on, maybe that isn't the way it really is.<br /><br />In reality, Po works in his father's noodle restaurant waiting tables.  He's way overweight and out of shape.  But he dreams about Kung Fu and idolizes the Fearsome Five, Monkey (Jackie Chan), Crane (David Cross), Tigress (Angelina Jolie) Viper (Lucy Liu), and Mantis (Seth Rogen).  That's why, when it is announced that the legendary Dragon Warrior will soon be chosen, Po leaves everything behind and joins the rest of the village high up the mountain.<br /><br />Through a series of events, Po winds up being named the Dragon Warrior, much to the dismay of the Fearsome Five and Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) who must train the rookie.  Po doesn't think he can do it, but he doesn't want to quit.  Shifu and the Five want to make him quit.  But they'd better figure things out soon because an old foe is about to return to the village intent on destroying it.  Can Po save the day?<br /><br />Since I'm not a fan of Jack Black or Dreamworks Animation, I almost skip this flick.  And that would have been a huge mistake.  This is a fun movie for all ages.<br /><br />So let's get the obvious and the only negative out of the way right now, shall we?  We've seen this plot many, many times before.  But the movie does a great job of making the familiar ride enjoyable.<br /><br />Part of that is through the humor.  There are lots of great one liners and slap stick scenes.  It's not side splitting funny, but I laughed plenty of times.  And some of the gags were completely unexpected.  Yet the more serious and tender moments don't feel forced in the slightest.  And the story is fast paced with an ending that made me smile.<br /><br />The first few minutes are hand drawn animation, but the rest of the movie is computer animated.  It looked amazing with plenty of beautiful settings and small details.  They even managed to do a good job with the Kung Fu fight scenes.

B0017YDPI2|5.0|Supernatural is, frankly, one of the more surprising pleasures available on television at this time.  When I first heard about it, it was billed as Route 66 meets the X-files.  Two guys, on the road together, fighting monsters and investigating paranormal mysteries.  A buddy show.  Maybe a little horror thrown in.    Well, this show has turned out to be so much more than that.  This show is a family show at its core, but I don't mean one that you can watch with your whole family--this is only for teenagers and older.  The scary monsters that we were promised from the first?  Yes, they are here, and they are at times scream out loud scary.  I don't really love horror films, but I enjoy a good scare now and again, and this really fits the bill for me.  But about the \\"Family\\" show tag I used--the two guys are brothers, and their relationship makes the show.  The two are intensely protective of each other, often to their own detriment.  Other members of the family are also involved, and there is an extended family of people with whom they work.  Monster of the week stories pepper the series, but the show shines best when the backstory, the mythology arc is explored.  The mythology is as deep as the X-files ever was, but less confusing and more goal directed.  It feels like Eric Kripke (the Executive Producer) has a firm grip on where the overall story is going.  Where Heroes (a show which I really do enjoy) often meanders, wandering off in confusing ways, Supernatural keeps serious focus on plot, plot, plot.    The blu-ray production of season three is a real joy to watch.  Blacks are deep but well distinguished one from another, and the picture is very crisp.  Sound is good.  The special features on this one range from the silly to the funny to the very informative, much like on previous editions.      If you've heard about this show, and wondered if you should give it a chance, yes you should.  Start with season 1--it is well worth your time.  But season three completely blows previous seasons out of the water with its intense narrative, and performances from the lead actors that are harrowing.  The final scene of the final episode of season 3...well, chills up and down my spine is an understatement.
B001ED7C5I|4.0|There is so much to love about this album--but it doesn't quite reach Tracy's highest standards of excellence.  Tracy Chapman has one of the most distinctive and warm voices in music, and from a straight vocal standpoint, everything is as beautiful as it has ever been.  Her vibrato is as strong as ever, no hint of effort on her part.  Every note seems channeled from some inner well of grace.  Her intonations are perfect--floating over her guitar at moments of emotional delicacy, punching on the beat when she decries injustice.  Her lyrics are poignant, insightful, but not searing.  She no longer sounds as angry as she once was, but just sadder.  This is perhaps understandable--she is more than 20 years on from where we first her Talkin' 'bout a Revolution, but I know that the fire that she has showed in the past is still there, and I was hoping for a little more to rise to the surface.    This is not an album that you can get on the first listen, and indeed, the melodies improve and stick in the memory more with repeated spins, but there is nothing here that will even rise as high as \\"Bang Bang Bang\\" in terms of memorable tunes.      Ultimately, if you are a fan of this amazing lady, then you are going to enjoy this disc a lot.  If you find that the last several of her discs have started sounding similar one to another, then this disc will hold no surprises for you.  I don't think that is a bad thing, but it is a true thing.  Tracy has been our travelling companion for two decades, reminding us of how love hurts but is still worth it (mostly), of how  America has some real wonders, but how we have a great responsibility incurred by simply living here, and how sometimes people are not what they seem.  She was right then, she is right now.  This is a good disc, a warm disc, but a sad disc.  On Conditional, Tracy sums up exactly what is required to love this album well:  \\"There are strings attatched/tied to me/I want something back/if you agree/to be in love with me\\".If you agree to give back the effort it takes to love these songs, they will deepen for you and make this disc something to keep warm by this winter; if you give it a cursory listen, you might miss the point entirely.  I know that Tracy can do better than this, but for now, this is a beautiful interlude, and I look forward to seeing more from her in the future.

B001F290E4|3.0|Soul is a disc that you really want to like - stellar production - amazing talent - legendary material - almost guaranteeing that Seal's tribute to the golden era of Soul and R&B would easily score five stars on technical merit alone.     So where's my enthusiasm? Upon further review, I suspect it was left at the door with the headliner who, while making an airtight composite of a great album, fell prey to the fatal flaw of most artists who take on an entire recording of cover material - holding the songs so tight that they forget to forego the Kareoke and leave little of themselves on the final take.    To be fair, there's not one truly bad cut on the entire disc (I Can't Stand The Rain and If You Don't Know Me By Now are standouts) however, Soul projects an overwhelming \\"in the moment\\" feel - a coolly professional encounter that leaves no lasting impression.     Instead of simply pulling all the levers in his quest to \\"manufacture\\" a great record, Seal would have been better served bringing his heart as well as his body to the sessions. There's actually much here to like - just not much to remember.
B001KVZ69I|3.0|I have real mixed feelings about \\"The Boy In The Striped Pajamas\\", a new British film about a German boy and his family during World War II.<br /><br />As I watched the film, directed by David Herman (\\"Brassed Off\\", \\"Little Voice\\") and co-produced by the BBC, I was carried along by the story, which is impossibly idealized. But the filmmakers do a clever thing and mask the idealization through the eyes of an 8-year-old boy, who doesn't, and probably couldn't, know the truth. But the more I think about it, is this a good thing? And who is the audience for this film?<br /><br />Bruno (Asa Butterfield) is a pretty typical 8-year-old boy. He enjoys playing with his friends and finds the family's huge Berlin house to be fertile for his imagination; Bruno and his friends run through the hallways and up and down the staircase with abandon. Bruno's mom (Vera Farmiga, \\"The Departed\\", \\"Breaking and Entering\\") and dad (David Thewlis, the \\"Harry Potter\\" films) sit their children down and tell them about Father's new promotion, a promotion which means they must move to a new house in the country. Father is a German officer and his promotion has been to run a Concentration Camp. But Bruno and his older sister don't know this and they cautiously roam through the new house. Bruno spots a \\"farm\\" from his bedroom window and inquires about the \\"funny people\\" wearing striped pajamas. Mama is confused, but soon realizes what he has seen and quickly boards up his bedroom window. Desperate for some adventure, Bruno eventually sneaks into the back garden and further, moving through the lush plants and overgrown grass until he comes to the electrified fence surrounding the \\"farm\\". There, he spots a boy, Shmuel (Jack Scanlon) sitting on the other side of the fence, staring into his hands, and they talk. A friendship quickly blooms leading Bruno to try to get away everyday and sneak food to his new friend.<br /><br />As Bruno runs through the fields, the director seems to have placed a filter on the lens to capture as much dappled sunlight as possible. This stretches the believability of the story quite a bit. But just as I felt myself about to switch off, I realized, or remembered that Bruno is only eight. His parents have kept him sheltered from the truth and he doesn't have any idea of what is going on.<br /><br />But does this make it OK to watch such an idealized view of such a horrific event? Even such a small part of such a horrific event?<br /><br />Obviously, this story isn't going to have a happy ending. But the extent of this ending shocked me and made the film more powerful erasing many doubts.<br /><br />On the one hand, \\"Striped Pajamas\\" almost wants to be a bedtime story. On the other hand, it tries to tell a moving story that will tug at your heart, trying to get you to cry. But both efforts are just slightly off. When I researched the director, David Herman, and found that he had directed both \\"Brassed Off\\", starring Ewan McGregor and Pete Posthelwaite and \\"Little Voice\\" starring Brenda Blethyn and Michael Caine, some things clicked into place. Each of these films has various elements that work, but they are all slightly off. Like something isn't clicking into place. Like the director doesn't have enough skill to recognize there is a problem, or the skill to correct the problem and connect all of the dots. Each film is missing something to connect the dots.<br /><br />There is an attempt to bring home the horrors of the situation. Mama (Farmiga) knows they are moving to a house on the outskirts of a concentration camp, she knows what her husband is about to undertake, but she doesn't realize the extent of the job. The moment of realization is powerful, but it comes early and is followed by a lot of erratic behavior. Mama also spends a lot of time frowning or looking worried as she realizes Bruno might eventually learn the truth or as she watches her daughter begin to embrace the Third Reich, joining the youth movement.<br /><br />The behavior seems to have no effect on Bruno, because he doesn't know or understand what is going on.<br /><br />Because the children are living in the country, Papa hires a tutor for them. We watch as the tutor attempts to teach the two kids the party line, instilling in them the propaganda leading to the horrors perpetrated by the Third Reich. At one point, Bruno spies on a secret meeting and watches a propaganda film about how great life in the camps is. These are very interesting moments, but they don't really seem to open up little Bruno's eyes. Since we are following Bruno through this journey, it is difficult for us to watch, as he doesn't seem to come to any realizations.<br /><br />The main problem seems to be the choice of an 8 year old as our guide through this story. \\"The Boy In The Striped Pajamas\\" is aimed at adults who go to foreign films, adults who like Merchant Ivory films, adults who like historical period pieces. So why an 8 year old? Are the filmmakers trying to attract children? To make the film seem more like a bedtime story? I really don't think so, but you have to wonder. If any children of this age actually watch this film, I think they might have nightmares. When the story finally shifts and the events begin to become more horrific, the children will have questions. Questions that you will have to answer and the answers will most likely scare the children.<br /><br />But the film doesn't exactly work as a story strictly for adults. Because Bruno never sees any of the consequences of what his father is doing, what his country is doing, he remains oblivious. It is almost as though the filmmakers want us to fill in the blanks, leaving the horror to our imagination. And this works to a certain extent, but because Bruno is our guide into this world, he needs to see some of this as well. When a friendly old Jew, a former doctor, who works in the house suddenly disappears, Bruno asks about him and his sister responds \\"He's not coming back\\" with an attitude indicating he should know better. We know better. But Bruno wouldn't.<br /><br />But the filmmakers temper this lack of awareness in two ways. Bruno is very young. And his lack of realization leads him to a very problematic end.<br /><br />Vera Farmiga is good as Mama. As soon as she realizes what is going on in the camp, she becomes emotionally troubled and can't accept what her husband is doing. Unfortunately, this leads her to sit around with red eyes, swing on a tire swing for hours, and to act like a crazy person, causing her husband a lot of problems. The role is a bit over the top and theatrical, but as she is the only person who seems to realize the horror, it works.<br /><br />David Thewlis is also good as Papa, an officer in the German army who accepts his new promotion with pride. He shows a believable lack of emotion and a credible amount of stern authority. Thankfully, he plays the character pretty even keel, staying away from histrionics.<br /><br />Even though the performances are good, this is yet another film set during World War II in which the majority of the characters speak with British accents. Yes, the film is directed by a Brit, and co-produced by the BBC. But try to go for some authenticity and make the characters at least sound like they are German. In the upcoming \\"Valkyrie\\", it appears that Tom Cruise doesn't attempt any accent along with all of his British co-stars.<br /><br />\\"The Boy in The Striped Pajamas\\" suffers from an inconsistent, mixed message.or understand what is going on.

B000HBK3MM|3.0|A nice album to kick off a girl night's out, or a lazy sunday morning with a cup of joe; it's a Starbucks type of song collection targeted toward the uber liberal hoity toity crowd.  I don't agree with the grammy nomination for this actress as I believe there are more far superior than her.  I guess when you sing several nicely written songs and have a good pr campaigning for you, everything is possible.
B001GJ1QQG|5.0|Anastacia's fourth full-length endeavour finds her delving into the mainstream sounds that have worked so well for Madonna, Kylie, Girls Aloud and the Sugababes. However, the sound is still pure Anastacia.    \\"I Can Feel You\\", the first single from the album, resonates with a 70's funk sound, and (of course) her soaring \\"I'm Outta Love\\" style vocals. A great song with great dancefloor potential.    \\"The Way I See It\\" pays homage to both Amy Winehouse and 60's Motown. Definitely has \\"single\\" written all over it.    \\"Absolutely Positively\\" is a nice little pop song with a definite 70's Stevie Wonder feel.    \\"Defeated\\" is an anthem of survival that resonates with a Mary J. Blige sound.    \\"In Summer\\" is just a happy little pop song about the joys of being in love. See if you don't smile listening to this one. Go on -- you know you want to.    \\"Heavy Rotation\\" is a great dance song. Very Justin Timberlake.    \\"Same Song\\" again, sounds very much like any great Amy Winehouse song.    \\"I Call It Love\\" is another pop gem, and one of the only songs on the album that sounds like the \\"old\\" Anastacia.    \\"All Fall Down\\" is another light, fluffy pop toe-tapper.    \\"Never Gonna Love Again\\" is a powerful ballad that reminds me of Celine Dion.    \\"You'll Be Fine\\" is in my opinion, the most beautiful song Anastacia has ever done. Though many probably won't agree with me, I think it's the best song on the album, and a perfect closer (unless you buy the 12-track version).    Because this album is a venture into new territory for her, and because it's not a territory that hasn't already been covered by countless other artists, I doubt this album will catapult her back into super-stardom. However, it has several tracks that will almost certainly become successful singles; while no song here resounds with the power of \\"I'm Outta Love\\" or \\"One Day In Your Life\\", the album is definitely her most consistent, and probably the only one without a bad track.    Definitely a five-star effort.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|Great fun! This film has such a lot of enjoyment to it that I really did find myself feeling like I was 8 years old again. Terrific stuff. The supporting cast are great, especially Ray Winstone. It's a shame he wasn't in it more.<br /><br />Overall I hugely enjoyed this. I knocked one star off because it does get a bit lost in the middle, but otherwise a fantastic action movie with the feelgood factor too.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1906669023 Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys]]

I was very pleasantly surprised.  If you like AC/DC, you will not be disappointed in this release.

B0017M8XS6|1.0|5 Stars for Brain Salad Surgery, of course. 1 Star for this remastering on the Deluxe Edition (SACD).    The midrange on this Deluxe Edition has been jacked up with EQ and it is compressed enough so that Lake's vocals now grate a bit, but most difficult to understand is how this sound was considered appropriate for Palmer's drums. When his first beat kicks in with hi-hat in tow around 1:30 into \\"Jerusalem,\\" I think some folks will probably say to themselves: \\"You've got to be kidding.\\" The hi-hat was already a rough listen on the Victory but here it has been turned into a metallic pinch. I don't personally think that these EQ moves were a success. The added compression is also really annoying. The whole signal sort of \\"pumps\\" as a result. Surely some will rave about more \\"detail\\" and \\"clarity,\\" but in actual A/B comparisons with the old Victory CD, I found this to be utterly \\"tinny\\" with way too much added midrange EQ. And I already found the Victory a bit too bright. I still think that despite what I suspect were less than perfect source tapes, the original Atlantic CD mastered by Barry Diament is the best digital version of this album. Some might find it a bit \\"dull,\\" but in comparison to what? I don't know, I find my ears tolerate 40 minutes of that sound just fine. Adding treble to recordings during remastering seems common in the digital realm, but sometimes over the course of an entire album this added treble can really become annoying. I wonder if people would find the original Atlantic CD \\"dull\\" if they cleaned their ears out with some warm sounding vinyl for a few days?     Let us keep in mind that the Victory remastering in 1993 by Joseph Palmaccio was apparently the first time this entire album had been remastered from master tapes. This same mastering was then used by Rhino (ignore the new mastering credit inside, it's just a mistake). Castle also used this mastering after first accidentally issuing a downmix from the Rhino DVD-A. Hence, you have the Victory CD, the Rhino and \\"corrected\\" Castle editions all featuring the same mastering by Mr. Palmaccio. The Japanese releases on JVC are not worth discussion (too compressed) other than the fact that they had snazzy packaging. The album was released on CD in Germany on Ariola/Manticore, but while some of the Manticore CDs are hunted by audiophiles (especially the first album as well as Tarkus, and to a certain extent Trilogy -- all of which I agree sound excellent), I didn't find the Manticore CD of BSS to be all that great. Too much treble. Incidentally, I suspect that all of the Japanese mini lp CDs by JVC originate from the Manticore/Ariola sources anyway, if not just the CDs themselves. If you are curious about different digital versions of the ELP catalog, I recommend trying to find those for comparison. The Japanese minis were (sonically) a complete joke and offer nothing of value to the dynamics or tonality of these albums.    But back to this new SACD: The no-noise is thankfully subtle, and will likely not be evident to any but the most obsessive audiophile, but some was surely applied. Consider that the hiss level between this and the Victory are very similar and yet this is compressed and had some added midrange (things that would increase hiss), so you figure it out. I can't stand the stuff and wish there was more reverence for the breath inherent in analog tape amongst many modern mastering engineers, because the sound that occurs when perfectly natural tape hiss is removed via computer is not an improvement to my ears, in fact, it is a major downgrade ... but that's another story.     The much bigger issue at hand will simply be if one thinks the Victory mastering needed to be even brighter and have compression added. If so, you'll like this sound. I found the new release vastly inferior to the Victory, and I still prefer Barry Diament's Atlantic CD mastering for the smoothest sound (particularly on Palmer's cymbals) of them all.

She cleverly adds a www symbol on some pages in the book. This sends a signal to check the book's companion site for extended content.<br /><br />This great approach works well because it's visual with the green www taking little space. Thus, you don't feel like the book wastes any space to point you away from the book's pages. Some people don't care to go online -- they want their entire book within the book's pages. So it won't bother this audience.<br /><br />A useful book companion site also helps market the book to those who don't have it. If they like what they see, they'll want the rest of it.

0399534601|5.0|Smith's newest book is the most recent installment in her passionate, ongoing process to distill life and the art process (indistinguishable to most artists) down to it's bare matter.  If you can embrace playfulness, open courageously to the idea of art as life, are willing to turn off the television and look around you, love to challenge yourself to learn to BE and create from essence as opposed to trend or fancy, Explorer is for you.      As an author, she seems to live her life exactly the way she writes (as one can easily pick up when visiting her blog The Wish Jar Journal).      As an artist, she is apparently very well read on the subjects of art and life and willing to push beyond art school rules to find her own voice among so many artsy voices that seem to blend together these days.  For an insightful, modern perspective on gathering the fodder to create amazing experiences, I was not disappointed with this book.   I completely disagree with other reviews which state that this book is not for deep thinkers.  I find her simple, freshened concepts to be timely and revolutionary, just what artists have been missing from our creative processes.    I also recommend Wreck This Journal and Guerilla Art, also by Keri Smith.

0446579939|5.0|Sparks fly in this wonderfully romantic novel that makes a reader think that anything is possible, that fate or destiny may have other plans for each of us, and that if we follow our hearts we may just end up being The Lucky One.<br /><br />Nicholas Sparks creates a deeply emotional story of a battle-worn marine who holds most dear a photograph of an unknown woman. Throughout tours of duty, he clings to the belief that the photo is responsible for keeping him safe, and he later sets out to find the woman in the photograph.<br /><br />The Lucky One makes you believe in true love and fate. In some ways, I am reminded of how I felt in my early 20s when I read dozens of Danielle Steele novels. For me, she was the queen of romance. In this case, I'd say Sparks is the king of romance.

0132350882|5.0|[[ASIN:0132350882 Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship (Robert C. Martin Series)]]    First Impressions    I began reading this book with a couple of concerns. First, all the code examples were written in Java, and I haven't written much Java in the last couple of years. Secondly, the books seventeen chapters were written by seven different authors. In my experience, most books with this many authors are at best a collection of uneven chapters, or even worse a morass of redundancy and contradictions. In the end, neither of these concerns proved to be a problem. Instead they demonstrated the authors' point - that clean code is readable code.     The book's main premise is that clean code results from paying attention to the small details (details that are often overlooked in an effort to meet a deadline, or simply get the code working). This overriding theme allows for a seamless blending of each author's contribution into a cohesive readable whole. Where contradictions did occur, the authors not only acknowledged them, but successfully argued that they resulted not from conflicting ideas or approaches, but from differences in priority. Even the high quality of the editing, and typesetting silently reinforce this attention to detail and professionalism. Most computer books have several technical, typographical and grammatical errors in every chapter. I found only a single one in this book (several hundred pages in). This attention to detail silent reinforces the lessons presented in this book.     What's Inside    The book is divided into three parts. Part I (chapters 1-13) demonstrate what makes up clean code, what it looks like, and how to begin creating it (by picking better names, properly using comments, properly structuring your code etc.). By organizing this section into a series of small chapters the reader is able to begin applying these lessons from day one.    Part II (chapters 14-16) contains a series of case studies demonstrating how toapply the rules and guidelines from part I. These case studies show that like refactoring, cleaning code is an iterative process.  One that should be undertaken at every opportunity, because all code no matter how good can be improved.     Part III (chapter 17) is a knowledge base. This section documents the rationale behind every change made to the code in the case studies. This final chapter shows that clean code requires both the ability to make the changes, and to know why they were needed.    Final Impression    No book alone can make you a better programmer, anymore than a screwdriver can make you a better carpenter. However, if you have the discipline to go beyond simply getting your code to work, and begin writing clean code, then this book can help you to become a better more professional programmer. If correctly applied over time, it can even serve as a bulwark against an increasingly fragile code base comprised of hacks, kludges and quick fixes. This book not only taught me how to improve my code, but demonstrated that its principals are both timeless, and language agnostic. I would recommend this book to anyone who writes code.

B001GKJ2FC|1.0|I was SO disappointed in this movie when I saw it in the theater.  The initial reviews were good, but the movie wasn't original at all.  It was like watching \\"the League of Extraordinary gentlement\\" meets \\"the Matrix\\" and directed by Quentin Tarantino.  Do we actually have to watch EVERY SINGLE BULLET in super slow motion?!!!  Do we have to listen to the \\"F\\" word in every third sentence?  James Mcavoy's character was a lot like Neo in being the opressed cubicle worker who's destiny is greater than the humdrum existence he currently dwells in.  While the action sequences were cool, the same special effects got tiring after the 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc.  time.  You get the picture.      With some creative editing, this movie could have easily become a PG-13 movie.  Instead it minimized the teen age boy demographic who would have gone to see it for the action/ violence sequences and of course to gawk at Angelina Jolie. And if you want to see Angelina Jolie in all her glory, the two \\"Tomb Raider\\" movies are FAR better than this one.  Don't waste your money in buying this.  If you still want to see it, I would suggest renting it or waiting until it comes on Pay per view.
0345495004|5.0|I read this book based on a recommendation from a friend. Even though I am not usually a fan of historical fiction, I was interested, as I have been to Falling Water and knew a few things- or so I thought- about Frank Lloyd Wright.<br />I was truly captivated by this book. Loving Frank tells of the clandestine love affair between the Frank Lloyd Wright and Mamah Borthwick Cheney. This book was so amazing from a feminist stand point...Mamah was a very well-educated, strong woman who was trying to fight her way in a man's world. She did not get a fair shake in the world, but was very courageous.<br />The end was quite a shock and inspired me to find out more about the lives of Frank Lloyd Wright and Mamah Borthwick Cheney. (Ahhhh, now I understand the draw to historical fiction!) I spent a few hours on the internet researching after I finished reading this wonderful book. It is a story that will stay with you, and leave you wanting more.
B001GAOY5U|4.0|Lets face it.  This movie is a fun popcorn flick for the whole family. The special effects are cool, but some of them are very obvious and a bit fake at times.  The story is pretty basic, but has a lot of action.  If you watch the regluar non 3D version I would give it a 3 out of 5, not great, but not bad either.  HOWEVER, The 3D is what makes this movie extra fun and it was specifically designed to be a 3D movie as is evident by the cinematography.  This movie is a great one to show off your blu-ray player to guests or when your kids have a sleep over.    Yes, the colors are obviously going to be distorted AFTER you put the glasses on, but its still in 3D.  It takes about 5 minutes for your eyes to adjust to looking through the glasses.  Then your eyes will start to color correct some of the distortion.  Also, the start up screen tells you to brighten your flat screen as the glasses make the picture appear darker.  I'll still take this version over the regular version any day, even IF the colors are distorted by the glasses.      You get 4 pairs of glasses with the movie.  If you plan to show this to more than 4 people at a time in the future, do what I did and buy an extra few pairs on Amazon.com while they are still available.  I searched Amazon.com using the words \\" journey center 3D glasses \\" .  The extra pairs I bought from \\"3D Stereo\\" are the same exact glasses as the ones that come with the DVD (Magenta & Green lenses) and have the \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth artwork on them also.
B000002540|4.0|Blue Oyster Cult, in their very early years together was a performance band of guitar slingers, very cocky and very sure they would take on the world and conquer it. Slaves, were being reeled in from every show that The Cult played all over America. The submission was controled by layer upon layer of guitars, that would not stop, this attack was relentless.<br /><br />This live double record from early 1975, is exactly what BOC was for the fans, a driving force of frantic forceful rock. With the already legendary songs: \\"Cities On Flame\\", \\"Seven Screaming Dizbusters\\", \\"Hot Rails To Hell\\", \\"Harvester Of Eyes\\" and \\"The Subhuman\\", you kinda knew what you were in for, by those titles alone. This is music for parts of a teenagers body, that we cannot discuss in print. This is music to torture your parents.  The message of The Blue Oyster Cult was screaming from your stereo speakers: \\"Submit & Worship!\\" and it was a FUN message.<br /><br />To be young in the early 1970's was a joy. To release a world of teenaged crap, trying to suck the youth right out of your mind and body, great records such as this one were tailor-made to order as the medicine to take all that garbage away. Blue Oyster Cult, will never be thought of {by the music scribes} as a great band, they will never be tossed into the Rock 'N' Roll Hall of Fame...So what??? That ain't the point, and I don't need Cleveland when I got T-Rex!!!<br /><br />For every kid who got the message in 1975, this record will for ever induce a big wide grin still today. I don't need another thousand plays of: \\"Don't Fear The Reaper\\" on some classic rock station, to sell me the importance of BOC. This group was already important years before \\"Reaper\\" brought in the lesser-mortals into the fold. Shove those poseurs into the back of the arena! I'll be right down front with the old crew, sweatin', jumpin', bangin' and  screamin' to: \\"Cities On Flame\\".<br /><br />Sometimes, being a slave and being allowed to worship at the feet of your Gods, can be heaps of fun!<br />4.5 Stars for this record.<br />20 Stars for the memories!.5 Stars for this record.  20 Stars for the memories!
B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie features a bleak, emotionless future to resolve human conflicts such as war, interesting as it is, instead of just putting the 'sense offenders' back on medication, they choose to kill them.  I did not understand the meaning behind that, and how any society would ever find that to be a solution, however for the sake of moviemaker plot line, it was a pretty surrealist look into a world ironically not too different from ours... in some parts of the world anyway.<br /><br />Christian Bale did an amazing job, as he normally does, playing a top level agent that seeks out the 'sense offenders' and destroys them.  When he finds he has missed a dose of Prozaim, the 'it' drug of the times.... He starts to feel, as he begins to process emotions for the first time, he discovers there are 'feelers' all around him,  he joins the resistance and now has to fight 'Father' the leader of this non-feeling movement.<br /><br />It is a great story to remind us all why being human is important and special... though I cannot understand how Taye Diggs was supposed to be considered on those drugs.... he may have needed a stronger dose, since all I got out of him was emotion... more so even when Bale's character is supposed to be off the drugs...<br /><br />Anyway it is definitely a great movie, I gave it 5 stars, merely because anything that allows me to watch Christian Bale for an hour and a half has to be good :)
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|This album is way beyond expectation. Summer is back to her peak form. It is a modern dance oriented album. It is not just for Summer fans. In fact it has very little like her disco era materials.    Give this modern Summer a try.

This book, written with humor and wisdom, addresses our most common questions about \\"Why would he act like that?\\" In spite of the title, you will feel MUCH better about what you have to offer in a dating situation after reading this fun (yet very serious) book.

0307383415|4.0|Memoirs by politicians tend to be tactical. They want to show you their blue collar roots, their ability to overcome social and personal obstacles, their perseverence. Barack Obama's memoir is so unusual that the normal rules need not apply. In contrast to the carefully chosen moments that define one's life, Barack gives a story somewhat typical of the average member of Generation X. He came from a split home, raised by his grandparents and traveled to various cities while developing his sense of self. The commonalities are simple but the specifics are fascinating. How he grew up in Hawaii, his ambitious Kenyan father, his trip to his father's homeland and eventual ascendency into the Illinois legislature. This is not the path most would have imagined for a future president.

0143039482|3.0|Steinbeck? Oh, right. Steinbeck. THE Steinbeck. I can imagine the man sitting in his study on the eve on his sixth birthday. He opens that letter from his publisher, or maybe James Dean. Whoever. It's the letter same letter he's receiving for the millionth time:<br /><br />::John, East of Eden was... It was... Gosh! I've just got no words, man. But then again, that's you're job. Really though, you've really done it this time, the pinnacle of your literary carrier. You're golden, now just kick back and have a martini, maybe give the kids a call. Anyway you can take it easy and die in peace `cause I happen to know that Governor Schwarzenegger is going to make an awesome speech about you in like, 50 years when he adds you to the California Hall of Fame... ::<br /><br />Yeah maybe he's getting pretty old at this point, but he's a writer. He doesn't like playing bingo. He doesn't want to move to Florida and sit on his ass day, he wants to write, even if he's loosing steam.<br /><br />I think Steinbeck's biggest mistake with this book was simply writing some of the world's most brilliant literary fiction, beforehand and not afterward. He kindof sets himself up for some pretty rigorous criticism.<br /><br />Ethan Hawley, admittedly, is a pretty interesting guy. His wit matched with an offhanded and loving sense of humor keeps his interactions with anyone, and sometimes even anything (the cans of produce at the Marullo grocery store, the surreptitious jury of his own subconscious) upbeat with a jolly sort of humor that adds flavor to his constant moral introspections.<br /><br />The rest of New Barrytown though, I couldn't seem to shake the eerie feeling that I'd landed inside a really well written 1960's sitcom. Even Margie, the town floozy, seemed antiquated, repressed, compelled or bound by the book's own courteous tone. The whole reason I love Steinbeck so much is that he usually gives narrative priority to the modalities of commonplace human life before a book's higher social or political motivation. (in Cannery Row he spends nearly an entire chapter delineating mankind's prehistoric relationship with frog hunting) I felt that here, too often, I was getting `American capitalism breeds immorality' smeared around it my face so much, I couldn't see though to what was actually going on, i.e. a portrait of life and money in a very interesting town.<br /><br />Long story short, it's a good read, but nowhere as good as some of his others. Unless you just have to have it all, I'd recommend first sampling the Grapes or the Mice or the Cans.Cannery Row he spends nearly an entire chapter delineating mankind's prehistoric relationship with frog hunting) I felt that here, too often, I was getting `American capitalism breeds immorality' smeared around it my face so much, I couldn't see though to what was actually going on, i.e. a portrait of life and money in a very interesting town.

Senseless violence, on and on...
B00004WG2F|1.0|It is hard to finish this film since it is so predictable, overly dramatic, and devoid of a sensible message. The four leading actors are good as their other films will bear witness to, however Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins, Aidan Quinn, and Julia Ormond can't escape from a idiotic plot and overly dramatic unrealistic script.      Repeatedly in the film we see people going away while those left behind huddle together with tears in their eyes while overly dramatic music tells the viewer that something emotional is happening, even if it is not. The number of these scene where someone goes away or comes back again reach the point where the viewer just doesn't care anymore and the music used for each of these extended good-bye scenes eventually becomes so repetitive that you can't bear to finish the film.     Pitt is indeed handsome and he gives the film a real acting effort. However, the film appears to be a vehicle to display Pitt in a range of activities and costumes, as a cowboy, a World War I soldier, a ship captain, a big game hunter, a whiskey bootlegger, a native man of multiple cultures, etc. We see Brad Pitt barely clothed or nude in love making scenes that seem highly orchestrated to titalate the viewer. How tiresome this all becomes.     Anthony Hopkins is a superb actor as his performance in Remains of the Day should attest. However, in this film he is a two dimensional cardboard version of a strict father who becomes a stroke victim with a shotgun. This is one of those films where we are told about people's feelings rather than experience it through their acting skills. We are told that Colonel Ludlow loved a women more than she loved him but we never really understand this odd relationship between Colonol and Elizabeth Ludlow.     Aiden Quinn tries his best, but his character lacks insights necessary to become more than a poorly articulated spurned man. Aiden Quinn has the third most lines in the whole film and yet lacks some sense of reality and coherence as a character.     Julia Ormond plays a young woman who must be totally crazy to put up with the Ludlow family which only brings her misery. At least ten times in the film, any common-sense would have compelled her to leave the wilderness home of the Ludlows and go get a real life.     The outdoor photography was excellent, of the quality of a good National Geographic nature film, but this alone does not save a film that is based on a screenplay that was pitiful. The film is 2 hours and 15 minutes long. It literally could have been cut in half and still would have seemed tedious.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I loved this book almost as much as the first.  I care so much about the main characters that I needed a powerful and happy conclusion.

B0014Z4OQG|3.0|all in all not a bad film of its kind , i always find this kind of film (blair witch ,rec, etc) a little off putting but have to admit i enjoyed this.
B0019X3ZZY|4.0|This surely is the masterpiece in a sense that I have not seen any work of art in the past like this one.  It does not mean that it is pretty, or socially acceptable, or humane - on the contrary, film shows the sides of humanity one would rather choose to ignore or not know about altogether.  We see four middle aged men along with the four middle aged women arrange for the time and place to exlore limits of human sexuality in the secluded italian castle.  Considering troubling context of the movie, director places these events and its unfortunate protagonists in 1944-1945 period.  It is end of the World War II, fascism is falling apart.  Like most deaths, this sort of death raises strange reactions in people affected by it.  Women I mentioned are engaged to be a storytellers (One of them is a musician), while men choose to engage in their desires that have no limits.  I would say that film is divided into three parts: obsession, that leads to degradation and submission of the other human beings and finally masochism that ends in mass murder.  There were moments when film was very difficult to watch.  But like most totalitarian societies, this one finds its way to justify actions incomprehensible to most ordinary people.
B001F7MSFW|5.0|I bought Hellboy 2 and I was amazed on how well this film was made. It is equally as entertaining as the first film and just as action packed. Along with Kung Fu Panda, Hellboy 2 is a extremely fun and awesome movie.    I went to see some films but I sadly missed Hellboy 2. But it was worth the wait when I first watched this great action film. The characters played by Ron Perlman and Selma Blair are very fun.    I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves Hellboy or for someone who is just looking for a great action-adventure film. Buy this movie. Trust me, you'll be entertained.
B0012Q732O|3.0|*10,000 B.C.* just couldn't quite be THE movie, although there were quite some interesting elements in it.<br /><br />This movie focuses on a clan during a time when mammoths and sabertooths roam the earth.  D'leh is isolated from his peers because his father, the clan's leader, had forsaken them.  Also in the clan is the adopted blue-eyed girl.<br /><br />When the girl is taken hostage in a land faraway, which you assume to be Egypt, D'leh and a few men go after them.  And, along the way, they encounter little adventures.<br /><br />Simple story with minimal dialogues.  It's a simple damsel-in-distress plot that works just about every time.  While there were cool special effects, there were misses here and there.  I think what really hurt this film was that the story moved at a slow pace.  Slow pace + minimal dialoge = not good.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|I was pretty dissapointed with this movie. So many things just did not add up or seemed slapped together. Like after umpteen yrs later Marion shows up and in like 1 day falls in love with Indie? What the heck? And to heck with Shia Laboufe (don't care about spelling his name). His acting just plain sucks. I don't understand why he shows up in big movies like this and Transformers? For some reason he just ruins movies for me. I understand that you have to accept some unbeleivable stuff to enjoy a movie like this but for some reason this just seemed one far fetched scene after another. Mutt swinging from vine to vine and heading off the cars...come on. I'm glad to see Indie again but really saddened that this is how I have to remember him. I was happier before.
1416562605|5.0|What a fascinating, page-turning, train wreck watching gem of a book!  It's Dickensian in its almost casual description of the most horrendous physical and social conditions and is a stunner from the first page.  The White Tiger of the title is Balram, so called because of the rareness of the promise he showed in primary school.  Because of corruption in the system (which Balram attributes to Ghandi's abolition of castes)and his family's poverty, he must leave school to work in a tea shop, horrible work.  He soon loses his innocence and faith in justice and learns to watch for opportunities to better his circumstances. Rather than victim, Balram sees himself as merely disadvantaged, and realizes that the only chance for him is to beat his tormentors at their own game.  He is endearingly optimistic that there are better days ahead, and he takes us with him on his amoral way.<br /><br />Aravind Adiga's depiction of the soul numbing grubbing for survival of India's lower class as well as the sniggering snobbery of the comparatively wealthy, themselves fearful and desperate, is amazing.  He packs volumes of information into Balram's drily humorous observations, written as letters to the Chinese premier. This is not a novel of good vs. evil--there is no good, the hero is anything but, and the very fabric of the society is evil--but we root for Balram every step of the way.  We exult at his triumphs achieved at the expense of some very dispicable characters and revel when the victimizer becomes victim because we know Balram's actions come out of a desire to achieve what we Westerners take for granted.  Had Balram been born in the West he would have become a doctor, lawyer or university professor, but because of an accident of geography he becomes a murderer.<br /><br />The White Tiger is a compelling story of the human cost of injustice and I highly recomend it.

B001G9LVGG|5.0|Loreena McKennitt is not just a talented musician, she's given us quite a generous Christmas gift.  In these days of iTunes and your standard 10-song CD with 40 minutes' worth of music, she's brought out a Bakers' Dozen songs for a Christmas feast for both your ears and eyes.    This 54-minute CD is comprised of a lot of the traditionals you'd expect with McKennitt's signature world-infused flair.  Part Celtic-part Middle Eastern, these carols don't sound anything like the retreaded redux you hear so often on each year's crop of Christmas CDs.  You really never know whether you're going to hear pipes and accordion or sitar on the next tune and the listen is a very pleasant surprise.      If you like traditionals with a different flair, Celtic-Middle Eastern world music, or just plain beautiful orchestration, you're going to enjoy this CD.  It's so good, you'll want to dust it off when Christmas music is the last thing on your mind!     Rebecca Kyle, November 2008
0375836675|4.0|I Am the Messenger was an enjoyable read.  It was hard to put down and the stories were very interesting.  I do wish that the ending would have been a little different.  I feel like the book just dies at the end and it was really disappointing after a great story.      Ed was a great character and some of the people he helps were also fascinating charaters.  I felt that some of his friends could have been a little more developed.  Some of them did gain interesting stories towards the end, but I wanted more from characters like Audrey and Ritchie.
B001CD6FKS|4.0|If you're into color, this film is for you. It's hard to imagine a movie with more and bolder colors and wild action that is presented here on this Blu-Ray disc, whch looks spectacular.      The story is predictable and a bit juvenile but I'm an older guy. For kids and most of the family, this should be very enjoyable. For those who like auto racing, you'll love it.    For those, like me, who love special-effects and stylish visuals, it was definitely worth a look, particularly on high-definition.  Some of it is simply amazing.

B001DHXT1G|4.0|I found this very entertaining and better than anticipated. Some folks might find it a big slow going in the first half hour but I enjoyed the colors and South American scenery during that time. I also enjoyed the acting of Edward Norton, who usually excels in whatever roles he plays.     When the \\"Hulk\\" appears, it's pretty awesome even thought its also pretty obvious how computer-generated it looks....but who cares? The Green Monster might not have looked as realistic as the TV days when Lou Ferrigno was the big guy, but it looked very cool because of its size. If you enjoyed \\"The Sandman\\" in the last Spiderman movie, you'll enjoy this 2008 version of the Hulk, too.  By the way, if you can, watch both of those on Blu-Ray as they look incredible.      One thing filmmakers do these days that I think is very nice is to pay tribute to the old actors who were in these stories years ago, either in film or on television. Here, there is a nice cameo scene by Ferrigno, who still looks in great shape, by the way. The former bodybuilder who was the green monster in the TV series that starred Bill Bixby, has a few lines in here as a security guard that will make you smile. I'm sure they would have had Bixby in this movie, too, had the man been alive. In the recent Superman film, \\"Superman Returns,\\" we saw Jack Larsen and Noel Neill, who played Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane, respectively, on the 1950s \\"Adventures of Superman\\" TV series. This has been done in a few other movies, too.    The ending to this film also was clever and tied in with another recently-issued movie. That's all I'll say because I don't want to spoil the surprise. It makes me anticipate what's on the horizon. Overall, this film was fun to watch and I definitely would view it again, especially with this great Blu-Ray transfer.
B0017I1FNK|5.0|If you don't know Emmylou Harris at all, buy anything she's ever done. The worst that you'll get is really good. This album is lovely, if low-key and sad. There is a strain of American music - the only authentic strain aside from Afro-American - embodied in country, folk and some rock based on the former two that is heart-piercing, but absolutely lovely. And Emmylou Harris - who defies labels - does it best of all (though her version of \\"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend\\" - elsewhere - rocks with a kind of tough cynicism that the Broadway showtune never had.) I've seen her up close in a small concert and she is the very epitome of grace, modesty and beauty. I've been playing this disk for months in my waiting room, and client after client has been struck and asked me about it and her (and Juanes too, but that's another story.)
B001GAPC1K|4.0|Simply put, this was a very entertaining movie.    Despite the movie running a little long for an intense, action movie, overall it was still very interesting and fun to watch because the pacing was so good. Neither the action segments nor the lulls, the robot scenes or the soldier scenes nor the very low-key romance is overdone. It's all in good proportion. It's not an innocent based-on-a-comic character film but, frankly, what movie is nowadays? There's always some profanity and sexual innuendos that don't belong in a \\"kids\\" movie made today. Thankfully, that kind of stuff was a lot lower in content than the recent \\"Transformers\\" film I viewed.    The scenes with \\"Iron Man\\" a.k.a. \\"Tony Stark\\" (Robert Downey Jr.) in his suit and demonstrating his spectacular skills were - no surprise - the most fun to watch. (If you have a chance, catch this on Blu-Ray as the transfer is terrific). At the end of the film we get another robot, piloted by the corporate bad guy \\"Obadiah Stane\\" (Jeff Bridges) and that huge Iron Man-clone is fun to see, too.    Some complain the film is not really all that \\"smart\\" and it's a bit too predictable, but it's fun ride of escapism that offers a good two hours of diversion thanks to very good special-effects and mostly-likable characters.  And.....it looks fantastic on Blu-Ray.
B001GQ2TGA|3.0|To start with, I would like to state that I have every album Enya has done with the exception of the first one...The Celts.  This being a \\"Winter/Christmas\\" album I was hoping to get a bit more of a Chirstmas feeling from it.  There are only two songs on it that I would stand up to applause....O Come, O Come, Emmanuel, and the new chorale version of Oiche Chiuin.  One thing I would have liked to have heard on O Come, O Come, Emmanuel would have been a bit of male tenor and bass vocals added in with subtlety (as in Gregorian chant).  There are a couple of other very likeable and listenable tunes such as And Winter Came and Journey Of The Angels, but after that it all kind of falls apart.  I think that the up tempo thing as in Orinoco Flow from Watermark has been too far overdone and continues with this album.  I was really hoping for something a bit more deep in emotion towards winter and the Christmas feel.  It seems as though that the Christmas/Winter theme album is all the rage right now which is a nice contrast to the everyday/same song/same or slightly different arrangement Christmas album.  Wintersong by Sarah McLachlan acheived this in a much better way and is far more listneable during the Christmas season than this CD will be......  Nice try but I think it falls short.  Enya is better than this......
B000L212HC|4.0|I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then a few weeks ago on Blu-Ray (which looks super) - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.    It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.    Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.    This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!
0297848976|3.0|It read like a European film - with subtitles. Very entertaining, as a friend promised... but I just couldn't help wishing I could read Spanish so I could enjoy the book in all its original splendour.<br /><br />Given Lucia Graves (found out she was Robert Graves's daughter from wikipedia) did a fair job of capturing the film noir glory of Zafon's storytelling and layered narratives, I couldn't help but cringe at the awkward turn of phrase that probably originated from some beautiful Spanish idioms, especially when a character says something clever or insightfully humorous...<br /><br />Still a nice book to read for its cinematic leanings... (is a movie out already?). A cemetery of books, a young boy protecting the only copy of an elusive author's book, whose works are strangely sought after and burnt by one of the characters in the book... loss of innocence, childhood friendships turned awry, crush on a blind girl, incest, jealousy, etc, all the ingredients of a gripping story.

B001CVCB9O|4.0|Another great record from Calexico.  The compositions are wonderful and the recording quality is pure warm southwest tastyness.
B000002JOH|3.0|This is very good for a PanterA album, one of the better of the six released with Phil Anselmo (including \\"Power Metal\\"). The reason I give this album only 3 stars is because I feel that the album is already practically completely represented in \\"Far Beyond the Great Southern Cowboys' Vulgar Hits\\", PanterA's greatest hits album. Everything you need to own from this album is on there. All the \\"PanterA essentials\\" as one may call them. \\"Mouth for War\\", my personal favorite song from this album is already on \\"FBtGSCVH\\" as well as the signature hit single \\"Walk\\", and the thrashy semi-ballad \\"This Love\\". The only song on there not available is \\"F*cking Hostile\\" whihc I suggest you purchase and download right away as you ARE misssing outnot having that song.      If you're trying to have every PanterA album in a collection, then this album is for you. If you like loud as hell, balls to the wall, pure thrash metal in it's rawest, loudest, most extreme form, then buy this album, however I simply believe this is already summed up in \\"Far Beyond the Great Southern Cowboys' Vulgar Hits\\".      Overall: This is a kick-@$$ PanterA album andI'm nott saying it isn't, I'm simply typing what a CD review SHOULD be: \\"a fan's response to an album that includes heavy comparisons and contrasts with other albums of the same band's discography\\".      Thanks for reading and I encourage you to get out there immediately and purchase both \\"F*cking Hostile\\" as an mp3 and then out it on a blank CD as well as buy \\"Far Beyond the Great Southern Cowboys' VUlgar Hits\\" if you don;'t already have both of them. Also, the latter is great for any PanterA collector, Beginning Pantera fan, or DIehard PanterA fan as it includes a DVD that features a bunch of PanterA music videos and some live footage, as well as a brief biography of the band's career, AND, some of the baddest, most awesome, excellent, Kick-@$$ songs PanterA has ever written! Purchase both today!      Screw \\"Vulgar Display of Power\\", byuy them instead!

B001ECQ75A|5.0|Kung Fu Panda is awesome!!! Po is cute and funny and the story has a great message. I suggest that everyone buy this great movie! And be on the look out for a sequel in 2010 or 2011!    Kung Fu Panda is my pick to win the Oscar this year. Come on and vote for Po! This is one of the best movies of 2008! Buy it now!

B0013K1ALE|5.0|Been into Zep since I was a kid.I remember back in 73 when Zep did this show at MSG in NYC. For years I was not happy with this. Thank god Jimmy Page decided to remaster and add the additional songs and a new 5.1 mix the way Zep played on stage. This is a must for Zep heads and a great look back at the mighty Led Zeppelin
1595141979|5.0|I LOVED this book. I got it in the mail yesterday and finsished it last night. First, I was pleasantly surprised to find how big the book was. It's the size of Vampire Academy plus half of Frostbite. The more the better I say!! Second, the plot was just fantastic. It moved quickly and didn't drag on and the transition from Frostbite to this book flowed very nicely. Theres lots of drama with Rose and Liss and Christian and Dimitri and Adrian that just keeps going throughout the whole book. I don't want to give away the ending but I must say that although I was shocked by the outcome, I definitly saw it coming. We definitely see a resolution with the Rose-Dimitri relationship and we end the book with a huge cliffhanger that made me feel very sad that I have to wait probably another year to see what happens next. Overall, this is a really good book and a great addition to the Vampire Academy series.
B001E7OO2I|4.0|John Legend is so talented. Alot of people look at this album as a cop-out because he took a more contemparary R&B approach, as apposed to his previous two albums where he did more soul and light rock music. But honestly, i dont look at it like that at all. I feel like this album really shows how versatile of artist John really is. Evolver shows that he can do those beautiful piano tinged track like \\"Ordinary People\\" and the gorgeous \\"This Time\\" from Evolver, but he can also do the radio grooves like the super contagious and super catchy \\"Green Light\\", which has become his biggest hit to date. Alot of people ruled Evolver out right after they heard \\"Green Light\\", because without a doubt, John Legend has never done a song like that before. \\"Green Light\\" is the first John Legend song that belongs on the radio. It has some great and misty production from up and coming producer Maylay, of course it has the sultry classic John Legend vocals that everyone loves, and to top it all off, Andre 3000 just kills this song. Maylay also produced my favorite track from Evolver, and maybe my favorite John Legend track period, \\"Everybody Knows\\", which is a beautiful ballad about the pain you feel after losing that someone you love. See a lot of people just assumed that because \\"Green Light\\" was so radio friendly, that Evolver was gonna sound like an Ne-Yo album or a Chris Brown album, which it did take a different sound than his previous efforts, cuz there are a lot more up beat songs and a lot more songs that were produced with tracks instead of live instruments like his previous albums, which some fans im sure wont appreciate. But he still is John Legend, which pretty much means that your gonna get at least a few songs that are great because John Legend is one of the best R&B/Soul artists of our time. Evolver definetly has a more contemporary feel than his previous efforts, like on the scorching hot song produced by previous collaborator Will.I.Am, \\"Satisfaction\\". And then on \\"Take Me Away\\", he gets Ne-Yo to write him a beautiful song about just falling in love. John sounds SOOO good on \\"Take Me Away\\", which makes the song that much better. But we still get some of that classic John on tracks like the piano tinged \\"This Time\\" which pretty much could be called the \\"Ordinary People Pt. 2\\". And then on the super relaxing and soothing guitar laced \\"I Love, You Love\\", John really shows why people love him. People love John Legend because he makes people feel good with his gritty vocals. That song along with the sure to be hit song about how to heal a relationship thats falling apart \\"Everybody Knows\\", are both sure to be fan favorites. And another thing that has Mr. Legend running laps around the other R&B artists of today, is that he has mastered the art of live performances. I finally got to see him live in 09, and he sounds just as amazing, if not better live. It helps that i was fifth row in a already small auditorium at Mystic Lake Casino, but the man just knows how to give his fans a great show. I read in a article not to long ago that was ranking the top artists to see live in concert, and John was towards the top of the list, and now i know why. Overall like i said, Evolver isnt going to win any awards like Get Lifted did, but its still better than 90% of the other R&B albums coming out right now, and thats why i love John Legend, because no matter what, any music from him is guaranteed to be better than most of the junk that floods the air waves right now.            Grade:  B
B001IUBZAU|4.0|There is something comforting about having AC/DC out there. You can always fall back on them and they will be there, with plenty of songs about rocknroll and sexual innuendo. If you are looking for something new here, you came to the wrong place. This is your standard AC/DC stuff, which is what I as a hardcore fan want, no, change that, it is what I demand!
B0002EXH4A|5.0|I really love the songs on this album. Had heard them 100s of times before too, but couldn't afford to buy the original disc until now. Gotta say I am very proud to own this. It contains my favorite Megadeth track of all time, 'In My Darkest Hour'. The inspiration behind the song being written by Dave was Cliff Burton. Amazing lyrics, riffs and solo. Other songs like 'Set the world afire', 'Anarchy in the UK', 'Mary Jane' are also some great examples of the good ol' thrash that the 80s gave us.    Also, if you are looking for great musicianship in terms of song writing and lyrics, this CD is the way to go. In my opinion, Dave Mustaine is individually the most brilliant song writer. The line up of Megadeth keeps changing so often but I feel the line up for the early albums was certainly the best.     Ok here are the individual ratings for the songs :    Into the lungs of hell : 9/10   Set the world afire : 8/10  Anarchy in the UK : 7.5/10  Mary Jane : 9/10  502 : 7/10  In my darkest hour : 10+/10  Liar : 7.5/10  Hook in mouth : 8/10    Plus there are 4 bonus tracks which are like remixed versions. I don't really dig into those, would prefer the original work any time. But they offer an interesting variation anyway.     Highly recommended.

1407106171|5.0|Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler have done it again with this wonderful tale of the perils of Stick Man!  Both you and your child will love Stick Man's humorous adventure in the world and his eventual safe return to his wife and family. This is a great book as we head towards Christmas since it features Santa (aka Stuck Man) stuck in a chimney. If you enjoyed other books by Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler, such as The Gruffalo, The Gruffalo's Child, or Room On The Broom, then this one is for you.
B000F9RB8A|5.0|This wonderful comedy in Blu-ray features bad English dubing with poor voices, and they actually had the nerve to change many funny lines to dumb it down for us. It's best to watch it in Cantonese with English subtitles, it's then pure genius. I only wish Charlie were here to see it.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This album, in short, is a great conglomeration of different Irish music and instruments native to the land. The voices of these ladies can only be compared to angels and the sweet, soft vibrato of their harmonic sounds blend so well together!
B000068PQ0|5.0|I just got into the flaming lips about a year ago and thank God I did. I was looking for some new music that wasn't the same old same old and found it coming out of Oklohoma. I bought the Soft bulletin first because thats where I was told to start. It was a great album (4.5 stars) but Yoshimi is by far my favourite of their albums. It is more addicting then anything I have ever listened to and that includes Dark Side of the Moon and Meddle which I love dearly. So I have kept purchasing Flaming lips albums(I believe I am up to 7) and although they are all either really good or mostly solid they do not stack up to this one. This is pure 5 stars and I don't know many albums that are a perfect 5. Anyways, get it and give it a few listens. It will grow on you each time until you can't go a day without playing it. Although every SINGLE SONG is fantastic, highlights for me include: Yoshimi battles the pink robots pt. 1 and 2, In the morning of the magicians and Ego tripping at the gates of hell.
031606792X|5.0|What an amazing writer. I loved this book from cover to cover.  Thank you Stephanie for writing such amazing emotional books!!     I'm not a teenage girl either. I am a 30 year old Mother of three and I LOVED IT!  I loved all of them!
1595141979|5.0|Richelle Mead has a way of making her readers feel every emotion (happiness, anger, sadness) that her characters go through.  It is such a fulfilling journey reading one of her books.  Usually when some stories are told we as readers have a safety net. We feel certain things will not happen to the main character because they are the main characters.  Richelle is not afraid to make her stories compeling and take away our safety net to logically move the story along. We have no choice but to come back and see how it all unfolds.  I'm lucky that I discovered her and I hope other people will take a chance on her.    With that being said, Shadow Kiss was the best book in this series. This series just keeps getting better and better.  I do not want to ruin the book for anyone so I'll just say that this book is a game changer.  Nothing will be the same and it was heartbreaking to read.  I can't wait to see what happens in the next book.  I hope we don't have to wait too long :)    PS - if you haven't done this already look up what each of the Tarot cards meant for Rose and Dimitri....especially Rose....it was interesting...
031606792X|5.0|Stephanie Meyer certainly perfects her writing style in this novel. Some of the gaps that frustrated me with twilight no longer appear. Although no matter how much I love this book I do feel slightly jypped. The long awaited love scene between Bella and Edward is completely absent.

B00192KCQ0|2.0|Musically, this is probably the best album Metallica has released since \\"...And Justice for All\\"    But I have to give a low review for this product because the mix is unbelievably horrible.  Seriously this sounds like something a 14 year old would record in his garage.    Can you say \\"CLIPPING\\"?  Are Metallica completely deaf from years of touring?  Can't they hear how bad of a job Fidelman and Scheps did to their work on such a basic task?    I suppose if you listen on cheap enough equipment you probably won't notice the problem.    Metallica REALLY need to re-release this album with less compression and clipping.
B00168OINK|5.0|The reason to buy the Blu-Ray version is it is an absolute visual treat. The extras on the disc are rather weak, but this is more than made up for by the supremely excellent digital transfer to Blu-Ray. CGI movies like Kung Fu Panda are really where the PS3 and Blu-Ray shine. Watching this movie on my 40 inch TV showed up tiny details lost when I saw the film originally at the theater. Absolutely breathtaking and well worth the extra money for the Blu-Ray over DVD if you have an HD TV and a Blu-Ray player. Would have liked a digital copy with it but oh well. Thanks HellBoy 2.
0896762629|5.0|This book is a really wonderful present for all costumers and especially for those who is familiar with excellent quality of Janet Arnold's books. Not only \\"Patterns of Fashion 4\\" has all the values of previous Arnold's publications, it has more!<br /><br />As usual, the book is divided into 2 parts: theoretical and practical, latter including patterns and drawings of artefacts.<br /><br />Just to point out some definite values - for one, there are very many color(!) photographs in theoretical chapter. It's possible to see any details of textile, embroidery, lace or simple seam. Also, theoretical chapter is 50% of book (which is more than in \\"PF 3\\") and material is well structured by clothing types - Shirts & smock (men's, women's), Neckswear (ruffs, bands, rebatos, pickadils, supporters), Headwear (coifs, hoods, nightcaps), Gloves, Hose.<br /><br />Special attention is payed to embroidery, laces, cleaning, etc. Yet another value is traditionally good practical chapter with detailed instructions for sewing that are clearer and better than ever. For a bonus \\"Patterns of Fashion 4\\" has step-by-step instructions on \\"How to starch and set linen ruffs\\" completed with many photographs.<br /><br />I'm very grateful to editors and co-authors of this book - Jenny Tiramani and Santina Levey - who continue work of Janet Arnold and have prepared this publication. I highly recommend \\"Patterns of Fashion 4\\". This book is worth every penny!
B00005AQF7|5.0|This is one of the best Gangsta rated albums of all time. In a time where the west coast was running everything Snoop con. to help the west stay on top. If you think this is just about B****s and H**s then you should think again. IF you are going to get on the internet and promote you feministic bs then do it where ppl care like montana or some place not in cali. This is a G-rated album and if all you can do is hate then take your dumb A** review some place else lady.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|The album is full of depth and melody, and offers a more available and complete set of songs than Coldplay's last album.  Worth every penny.
B000002PCS|5.0|Both the DVD Movie and the Soundtrack are excellent in every way and I highly recommend everyone to see and hear these wonderful works.
1416524800|3.0|This is probably not the first Dan Brown novel you would pick to read since The Da Vinci  Code and Angels & Demons are the more famous work, therefore it is hard not to compare Deception Point with Brown's other novels.  Deception Point gives the same Dan Brown's thriller factor, but it lacks in believability and relies too much on perfect coincidences.<br /><br />The plot was very predictable (the title is a very big hint) and the characters are very one-dimensional.  You would expect the characters to be very enlightened after the outrageous things they went through in the book, but they were left unchanged.  Also, the final revelation didn't have a big impact on the story (unlike Brown's other novels).  The climax was very unconvincing (SPOILER: I don't see how three professional assassins failed again and again to kill the three protagonists)... I guess readers have to really use their imagination and go along with Brown's plot to fully enjoy the absurdness towards the end.<br /><br />This is not a bad political-thriller by all means, but too much events in this novel are coincidental  and unconvincing.  I did enjoy the separate plots connecting together in the end, but the shallow characters were too predictable and boring to read.
0739368044|2.0|I had trouble with the first book (Eragon) getting into it.  However, after much time I finally got the good parts of the book.  And the movie was disappointing.  Eldest was much better I thought, I didn't have too much trouble getting enthralled in it.<br /><br />With Brisingr I choose the Audiobook version.  So far, I've been listening at work for 3 days now and I'm bored to tears.  The reader makes Saphira sound, to me, like Yoda on a bad day.  This isn't a bad thing since the story is sooo slow, it gives the listener a touch of interest.<br /><br />I too feel that this book has alot more gore in it.  I don't think it's a bad thing as those are really the only parts I can remember from the audiobook.  It doesn't feel like anything really happened.  And where's the evil emperor.  He's mentioned over and over but no sign of him.  The other thing I took note of, it seems Eragon spends 90% of his time healing himself or someone else.<br /><br />This book feels like there is way too much filler, like there was a page quota to be met.  I don't recommend the audiobook unless you are having trouble sleeping.  And this is really a shame as I was really looking forward to this book.  I'm not sure I can finish the Inheritance cycle if this is any indication of the final book.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|This movie is a classic that is a must see for all.  My brother and I grew up watching this movie, and it just so happened that it is a favorite of my husband's as well.  It is family friendly and entertaining.  There are good messages throughout the movie.  I would highly recommend it to everyone.
B001F0VHEM|2.0|I have been a sucker every time trying to listen to Pink.  I know a 15 year old girl that can write her own songs, and play deeper more cohesive groovier music than Pink.  Just goes to show that most Americans don't \\"really\\" listen to music or they just \\"really\\" don't get what good music is.  Besides shouldn't you be able to write some of your songs..at least?
B000002GQE|5.0|I love this band and this album proves that they are one of the best bands of our time.  My favorite song, \\"Question\\", is one of the massive hits on this album.  What I thought was great was there was music from the original singer of the Moody Blues - my husband was disappointed that there wasn't more of his songs, but he really likes the album.  This is the Moody Blues album to buy if you're a real fan.
0805047905|5.0|Brown Bear, Brown Bear is a classic for babies and toddlers. They may go through more than one copy. It's the first book that they memorize and that's the first step in beginning to read.<br />I buy it often for young children.
0307269752|2.0|As I read this book I found that I couldn't connect with the characters, nor the Swedish culture, in which they live. I don't think that American readers will be intrigued by the characters, nor the plot. I wanted to say, \\"OK... and?\\" It read like the outline of a great novel that could've been, but was never fleshed out to be one. I'd like to take the \\"outline\\" and give it to someone the likes of James Patterson.
B0013ND30M|5.0|Arrived promptly, and in new condition. Was nice to have the oppurtunity to order early.
B001DHXT2A|4.0|In an effort to redo the start of a potentially good franchise, Marvel Studios offers up a great story about the one character who doesn't want the power he has.    The Incredible Hulk starts the origins over with a bit of everything thrown into the mix.  This movie is part comic book origin, part TV series origin and assumes most of the events that took place in the first movie still happened.  Bruce Banner is the brilliant scientist who experimented on himself due to the confidence in his work and converted himself into the raging green giant that becomes The Hulk.  His work was preliminary weapons research but he was not aware of it.  He was lured into thinking it was research for making soldiers more resistant to toxins and radiation, but really it was for creating a new breed of soldier.      Ang Lee's Hulk that was released back in 2003 took a very deterred look at the Hulk and added elements of repressed anger and paternal gene splicing.  In other words, the father messed with his own DNA and passed it on to his son, who then witnessed his mother's death at the hands of his father.  Way too much existentialism added to what should have just been a man who had been given a power that came at a price.  There is enough drama and character development in the basics of Bruce Banner/Hulk that you don't need to pull in sins of the father elements to make it more complicated.    This movie throws most of that into the trash and works with the premise that Banner (Edward Norton), now on the run, is hiding out and working to cure himself from a small town in Brazil.  He is a fugitive, which draws on the serial plot of the original TV series.  Bill Bixby's cameo is brilliant, BTW.  Once he finds out that he must travel back to the US for a potential cure, the chase is on.  Before he can pack up and start heading north, he is tracked down by General Thunderbolt Ross (William Hurt) and his squad of special forces led by Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth).  They fail to capture him,but are successful at meeting The Hulk.    Blonsky finds himself curious as to the origins of the Green monster.  When The General reveals to him that it was the result of experiments gone wrong (or right) he wants a piece of that power, which the General obliges.  As Bruce makes his way to New York, he reveals himself to Betsy Ross, the Generals daughter, whom he was in love with before the accident.  They find their way to Dr. Samual Sterns in New York for the ultimate cure and eventually the high end climax occurs.    The best thing Marvel did here was to just make a good movie.  Too many times in Hollywood they make every movie the be-all-end-all...so how do your follow that up.  Just make a good story.  And this move does that.  It's entertaining, it's got great action and a good script.  Thank God Marvel has it's own studio to do their movies they way they should be done.  All the actors perform well; Roth is a great villian (again), while Hurt shows a deep level of deceptive character that I've never seen before.  Norton is well balanced as the brilliant scientist who wants no self pity and shows great determination to get rid of this rage driven curse.  He and Tyler have good chemistry as well.  And of course Stan Lee and Lou Ferrigno make cameos along with Bill Bixby.
B00140PK6O|5.0|I just finished watching Cranford and was moved in all my emotions.  It is a beautiful piece about friendship, sacrifice, loyalty, mercy, regrets, new hope, and romantic love at ALL stages of life.  I can truly say this is a film that WILL stay with me for months and years.  While I found it dark at times (a couple grim surgeries and the oppressive poverty of a major character) the film was a mix of sun and shade, just as life.  Do not expect the lightness of Austen throughout, but the depth of story is tremendous.  The acting was perfect, the production values were wonderful, and I consider this film a gem.
076790592X|5.0|I enjoyed this so much the first time that I am rereading it. A heart-warming story about a former student paying homage to his favorite professor at Brandeis University. The book will tug at the heart and feed your soul, making you return for daily servings. Through Morrie's physical struggles with Lou Gherig's disease, Albom gives us the meaning of life through gentle reminders of what really matters - living life, appreciating friendships, looking within for life's rewards, not outwardly through material possessions. Told simply but poignantly, this book will stay with you long after you put it down
B000P0J09C|1.0|[[ASIN:B000P0J09C Full Metal Jacket]]    I was very much unsatisfied with this product for one simple reason. It came in full screen format. I ordered it along with two other DVD titles.  Both of the other movies came in wide-screen versions. I only buy movies in wide-screen. Perhaps it was my own fault for not being more specific, but I don't recall having an option. I am aware that I could have returned it. I decided instead to give it away as a Christmas present rather than go through the headache and expense of getting a bubble pack envelope, paying postage, and driving to post office.    I have, in the past, made other purchases from Amazon.com that I was completely satisfied with. I don't know that I would ever order another DVD without knowing specifically which format I would receive.    As for film itself, I have enjoyed it every time that I have seen it in past. I look forward to picking up a wide-screen version and would recommend the movie to anyone that likes war films.                                                     \\"rude dog\\"

B001BWQVSG|5.0|The reissue market is bringing around some extraordinary bargains lately, and this is one. Here we have 8 recitals made for DG starting when the pianist wasn't yet twenty but already playing like a master. The older Argerich has released much more material on her second label, EMI, but DG can boast of riches enough. The new remastering is also welcome, since the earliest LPs were often hard and glassy.

B000PMLFRA|5.0|Since I'm already paying for this movie a 4th time (or more), I want THE ORIGINALS FIRST!!!  Either put out the original first or put both the original and enhanced versions in one package, and I'll buy that.  But if this gets released with the enhanced stuff first and no originals, FORGET IT.  I'll decide if I want to buy the enhanced versions later, and I probably will, but I DEFINITELY want the originals, and if Lucas tries to jerk us over AGAIN, forget it!  I'm not as desperate since I have the standard DVD version and I can live with that very nicely, thank you.  I originally saw this movie at a drive-in theater, then rented it on VHS, then bought the VHS tape, then after I wore that out, I bought the DVD.  Give me what I want this time or you can take your Blu-ray inventory and (fill in the blank here)
0345479092|4.0|I bought this book on the suggestion of a friend. I had read one of the books by Dr. Sears, (which had brought me to tears.) I liked this book much better. Tracy advocates that happy parents make better parents. I could not agree more. I know that attachment parenting works for some, but not for me. I will agree with some of the other posters that, her British-isms get a little old after a few chapters. And I also think she was a bit harsh on those parents who said her techniques didn't work for them.(that's why I only gave 4 stars instead of 5) No technique works for everyone. My son was a grumpy, colicy baby. But he really responded well to the EASY routine.
B000GG4KTU|5.0|I got this cd when it came out and instantly loved it.  For me, it's got the perfect balance of sweet songs and upbeat and it just flows.  There's nothing better than a cd that flows.  The songs are wonderful, but some of my favorites were \\"Isn't it a Lovely Day\\" and \\"I Was Doing Allright\\".  When I'm in a jazz mood, I'll put this on and it works every single time.  If you have loved any of her other work, you won't be dissappointed!
B000957O82|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised at this movie.  Will Smith stars as a modern day matchmaker type, who has a deep romantic streak himself.  There were some very funny moments in the movie, some very touching moments, and some scenes very unpredictable.  I liked that this movie didn't have a lot of crude humor/nudity and was a cleaner cut movie.<br /><br />Kevin James did a great job as his role in this movie as an accountant in love with a celebrity and their courtship.  He is an actor that nearly always makes me laugh.<br /><br />Great, fun film to watch and have a laugh at.

B000001GAE|5.0|Here in 1990 Pollini concetrates on two contasting aspects of Liszt, in a program he still plays in concert. On one hand we get Liszt's flamboyantly ambitious capstone to a career of breakneck virtuosity, the B minor Sonata. Pollini's account is supernaturally good, an enthralling exhibition of absolute technique and rare musical instincts. The piano is also rcorded well, which isn't always true from DG, so the full sonority of Pollini's wide-ranging dynamics comes through.<br /><br />The other side of Liszt is his late, gloomy, spare pieces that do not so much paint pictures of a place (he did that masterfully in 'Annees de pelerinage') as paint elusive moods, most of them dark.  If the Sonata exercises Pollini's passion, these skeletal late works exercise his intellect, since it takes a probing intelligence to decipher them.<br /><br />In sum, I don't know if Pollini's Liszt is unarguably the best to be heard today, but I believed it while listening to this CD.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|I've been waiting here for so long.  Please understand before you read another word that this is a biased review.  On a beautiful summer day in mid-1974 I meandered in to the local record store in Mill Valley, California with around $8.00 in my pocket of hard earned paper route money.  I walked out with 2 albums for $1.00 that had never been played.  The store owner was selling his \\"promo\\" albums for fifty cents each and I scored Mahogany Rush- \\"Child of the Novelty\\" and Genesis- \\"Trespass\\".  I went home, smoked a very skunky reefer, and sat down to listen to my two new scores of which I'd never heard either band.  My life has never been the same since.  This week in November 2008 (34 years later) I've just obtained the new Genesis box set 3 (1970-1975) and \\"Child of the Novelty\\" 2006 remaster by Frank Marino.  Once again I've been taken to places I've never been.  Though the material is familiar the experience is BRAND NEW.  Trust me, \\"The Lamia\\" gave me goose bumps on top of goose bumps, \\"Fly on a Windshield-Broadway Melody\\" struck sonic chords that were probably only present the day of their conception.  God Bless these musicians and engineers and all the fans who pushed for and supported this kind of COSMIC ART that we don't see so much of these days. I've said my say, you can't get a better bang for your buck than Genesis- Box Set 3 and Mahogany Rush- \\"Child of the Novelty\\" remasters. Bless Yourself and buy them.
1592401791|5.0|I have been an avid Beatles fan for over forty years, and I know a few people who where part of the inner circle of the Beatles, and knew first hand of the dynamics of the band, and watched how they changed, particularly after Brian died.<br />  And this book is the only book that supports all of the information which has been misrepresented until now. So my feelings on this book, is that some fans might be a little disappointed to hear what really went on in the studio, picturing this genius as four lads having the time of their life, however, better to know the truth, than to listen to third parties writing what they thought the world wanted to hear. As disappointing as it may be to many fans, this is without question the most accurate portrayal of what really transpired in the studio, and in their minds of The Beatles, as they proceeded through this unprecedented time in musical history. A great deal of time was spent on the changes the group went through after Brian died, for this was where the Beatles really began the turmoil and emotional descent really took hold of the group. As discomforting to many as this might be, this is the most accurate, truthful and intimate look at the goings on inside the studio with The Beatles. This is the finest book about the real story of the Beatles, based on all eyewitness account, from the beginning of the pandemonium that embraced them, to the bitter rivalries which led to the Beatles demise. This book lays it all out for you, and gives you insight into their lives, their thoughts, and the tremendous pressure the group lived with, to the millions of people waiting desperately to hear their next genius effort, and the expectations were no less than that. It took many a masterpiece before they were ready to call it quits. This is the book, from Geoff Emerick, the assistant engineer on all of the Beatles studio recordings, aside from part of  \\"Let It Be\\",  through every session, watching it all transpire right in front of his eyes.<br />  Geoff Emerick tells it like no other could possibly could, and makes this the finest and most insightful book to be written about The Beatles of all time. An absolute must for any serious Beatle fan who really wants to know the truth about the band, the changes, resentments, and how and why they were left with no choice but to split. You wont find a more accurate book on the subject anywhere. This is the book for any and every Beatle fan who wants to know the real story behind The Beatles success, and what led to their calling it quits after only a total of 8 years recording.eyes.

It was amazing how nicely each character was developed considering most of them only say a few words!  Wall-E is a greatly lovable character who warmed my heart the entire movie.  I highly recommend this for anyone!  The message is great, the execution is lovely, and the whole thing is greatly entertaining.
1416575464|5.0|This is a book we all should buy to reference from time to time and ofcourse, for our remodeling projects. Even if you don't want to follow every word of it, it is very handy to just get ideas for decoraring some parts of your space. You can start by selecting a room and it's theme and then proceed with the help of pictures and examples. The photographs are very nice and the quality of the book is excellent. I would certainly recomend this wonderful reference guide!

I even e-mailed this person to ask if I could pay additional fees fro a faster mailing service. The e-mail was returned. I went to the store front for this individual and it was closed. Amazon stood beside thier policy and refunded my money. After that the DVD cam in 10 days late. I had already ordered another DVD. I have it now unopened If you want the DVD back say so. I do not need it.
B001G50SLE|5.0|I think this is one of the top 2 or 3 shows on television today. Humor,drama,classic rock and roll,and a few scares equals a fun hour of viewing. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles (Sam & Dean)  have great chemistry. They act like they really are brothers. Jim Beaver (Bobby Singer) is also excellent  as their friend and fellow hunter.

0307387178|4.0|It's ok to be a dreamer.  It's ok to want to 'find yourself.'  It's really ok to hike and backpack.  I've done it myself, but I would never, never enter a wilderness area without, at least, a topographical map.  Chris McCandless' story is nothing short of tragic.<br />  Jon Krakauer does a fine job of getting you into the mind of this doomed traveler while also taking you into the adventure and beauty of the wilderness.
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|If you want a classic version of the tale, check out the 50s version with James Mason (and, regrettably, Pat Boone). The latest remake is pure Velveeta - gloppy but tasty. I missed the 3D version in theaters and was surprised by how well the 3D works on this DVD. The glasses have magenta and blue lenses, unlike the typical red/blue lenses of most home 3D movies, the ghosting (double images) is minimal. Certainly the 3D looks far better than on Sony's \\"Polar Express.\\" You need the glasses (four pair) that come will the movie for maximum effect. This isn't going to duplicate the snazzy effects you saw in a 3D theater, but it's fun all the same.
0374531269|5.0|Ishmael Beah has written an amazing memoir called A Long Way Gone, which tells the story of his life as a child soldier in Sierra Leone. This is a book that everyone should take the time to read, because it will really teach you a lot about the current problem worldwide, with young kids being drugged, traumatized, and allowed to wield guns and fight in wars.     Ishmael experienced all the events in this book firsthand, and his story is utterly captivating. He moved to the United States in 1998 and finished high school in New York at the United Nations International School. In 2004 he graduated Oberlin College, and has spoken in front of many major world organizations that help fight for the estimated 300,000 children being used to fight in wars around the world today.    Ishmael accomplished exactly what he wanted by writing this book- he informed hundreds of thousands of people about the horrible lives that child soldiers lead all around the world. People need to look into this problem and become informed about it so that they can help organizations like UNICEF prevent it. There are thousands of young children whose lives are being taken away from them, and they are being exposed to violence. This is something no child should ever have to go through.    This book has many strengths, including things like its plot, which will make it very hard to put the book down, and all the information it gives you about wars fought in Sierra Leone. I think the only weakness was the writing style- Ishmael should have been a little bit more descriptive in his writing, and used more descriptive words to give you a better visual picture in your head of what was going on. Over all, A Long Way Gone is an outstanding true story that will teach you about the lives of child soldiers.

0767020308|5.0|I think, to a certain degree, comparison with Douglas McGrath's 1996 movie featuring Gwyneth Paltrow is inevitable. However, I must alert my reader to the fact that - when I praise this alternate version from Diarmuid Lawrence - I do so with the original novel in mind. This mini-series has not a movie's glamour, nor does Kate Beckinsale match Paltrow in beauty. However, with regards to Jane Austen's beloved work, this is undoubtedly the more faithful adaptation. Beckinsale's portrayal is less flighty and silly then Paltrow's... she carries the character's grace perfectly in every scene. The superb Samantha Morton, despite her slimness, is a perfect Harriet Smith; it is hard to make so stupid a girl endearing, but Morton does it with such apparent ease even her must enthusiastic fans must believe what they see. Lucy Robinson (better known by most as Mrs. Hurst from Simon Langton's 1995 \\"Pride and Prejudice\\") is so wonderfully obnoxious she almost undoes Mrs. Elton, who should be unbearable, but is instead wonderfully entertaining in both vanity and snobbery. Olivia Williams (The Jane Austen of Jeremy Lovering's \\"Miss Austen Regrets\\") is truly beautiful... more beautiful perhaps then the title character. What is more, she sings like a nightingale! Together with Raymond Coulthard as Frank Churchill (who is almost too charming to garner dislike as he should), the two make an astonishingly handsome couple. Mark Strong is not a very polished Mr. Knightley, but he plays the part admirably, with feeling, and with forethought which is apparent in his actions as well as his expressions. Even Prunella Scales, who must compete with Sophie Thompson for the title of \\"Best Miss Bates\\" withstands all independent criticism. Despite being somewhat rough, the production values grow better upon review... those subtleties in the use of music, camera-shot etc will become more evident and thereby easier to appreciate. Truly rewarding, for those who will properly attend to it.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold (A7x) have become the titans of metalcore along with acts like All That Remains, Trivium, and lastly Atreyu (as Killswitch Engaged could be considered the pioneers). \\"Avenged Sevenfold\\" is the bands 2007 self entitled album, that shifts the group into a more accessible hard rock angle. They even make way for much softer material.<br /><br />While still heavy they bridged more the melodic qualities of 2005's \\"City of Evil\\" to encompass the album, then say their 2001 debut \\"Sounding The Seventh Trumpet\\". With \\"City of Evil\\" we saw the band attempt a more orchestral layered sound. Sweeping away any thoughts this band was a novelty act cashing in on the hardcore scene. 'True' metalheads may still disagree. We also saw an ever more engrossing use of harmonizing guitar riffs and intricacy of solos. Even when progressing though, we can still tell it's the band we all got into. Atreyu's latest release 2007's \\"Lead Sails Paper Anchor\\" departed the band so heavily from past material it was hard to beleive it was the same band. Trivium gave up screaming for a majority of 2006's \\"Crusade\\", and rooted them selves into the thrash metal niche.<br /><br />We now find A7x shooting off a striking militant \\"Critical Acclaim\\". Starting off as triumphantly as the later vocals suggest, A7x is back. The dual vocals are just as interesting as the dual symphonic guitar intro. Next in line is the obvious single \\"Almost Easy\\". Quick to hit the  commercial cues, but relentlessly catchy. Most of the song maintains a hard hitting chug of triplets, while the other side is more built on the<br />easier going chorus. It finds enough room to fit in a few piano notes (in the intro and bridge), and a fair solo. \\"Scream\\" has just become another regularly circulated radio tune. Resonating a scream, and a hair raising guitar that climbs...the track feels much like filler afterwards. Not to say it's a bad track, but becomes a bit too repetitive. Not magnetic enough to hit replay and avoid the next few tracks, yet catchy enough to not skip though.<br /><br />\\"Afterlife\\" and \\"Lost\\" may not be side by side (track #4 & track #8 respectively ), but are an amazing combo. The first is a thick thick tune, progressive enough to avoid becoming stagnant catchy enough to be a  single. \\"Lost\\" sounds like an attempt to pick up the pieces after being beat down, a look back ribboned in regret. Confused, but clairvoyant.<br />Moving on \\"Gunslinger\\" could be considered A7x's swing at country. Similar to Atreyu's swing on well swing, with \\"Falling Down\\" (third single off Lead Sails, second for U.S. listeners). The soft intro last for over a minute and a half, and remains very mild there after. Still enough kick to not feel displaced. \\"Dear God\\" is very similar and could even be considered more so the country experimental track, as it dilutes much of the rock qualities (in favor of the country manorisms). Again these two tracks don't reach any level of brutality, but manage a mild flavorful variety.<br /><br />\\"Unbound (The Wild Ride)\\" and \\"Brompton Cocktail\\" in my opinion range as the filler tracks. Amazingly not bad, but not as potent as the other tracks. Unbound is as the name may prompt, pretty unbound and fast. Brompton features woozy violins, but struggles to maintain fluidity and serves as the midpace track of the album. \\"A Little Piece of Heaven\\" think of a corrupt fairytale tune. Now lets add in some vulgarity, splice in some obscenities and dose up the rage. What do you get? INSANITY! This is the longest track of the album docking in at eight minutes. Its epic length helps enable it to be the most intriguing track of the album. The most fun could be a coin toss between \\"Almost Easy\\" and \\"Critical Acclaim\\".<br /><br />So while not as powerful as \\"City of Evil\\", it's also not as one sided.  Not as raw as the bands 2003 milestone \\"Waking The Fallen\\", but more dynamic. While not as youthful as \\"Sounding the Seventh Trumpet\\", it's more thought out. Songs that only jam sessions can't craft. While many A7x fans are ready to gouge the bands eyes out with this release, many hard rockers will enjoy it. Anyone open to change will hopefully see this as a continuation of a band not ready to paraphrase itself (Though City has accomplished that, I'm referring to another distinct album knock off of previous work). Easily a recommendable album, much replay value can be obtained from this. Congrats A7x, hope to see you guys this December at 'The Next Big Thing'.ans are ready to gouge the bands eyes out with this release, many hard rockers will enjoy it.

B001KPK6Q2|5.0|Taylor Swift is indeed 'Fearless'. An excellent example of the new young generation of contemporary country, her sophomore album is very, very good indeed and was worth waiting for. I especially enjoyed 'White Horse' and 'Breathe' (no, this is not a cover of Faith Hill's but an original composition). I tend to like the ballads more than the uptempo numbers, but this is a great, varied collection with something for everyone. No throwaways on this one!     The Amazon MP3 album was only $3.99 today so it was well worth the visit.   Thanks to Amazon for your amazing service.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Easiest review I'll ever do in my life. Simply put: BUY THIS!<br />Why? Radiohead are an amazing group of talented song writers and musicians as a whole. Collectively \\"Ok Computer\\" pulls traces of their past soft alternative works together, and accompanies them with new progressive territory.<br /><br /> The tracks are masterful, deep, and distinctly unique. As a whole the production quality is outstanding, the song variety is awesome (remains on the lighter side of the spectrum). This is all before their large leap into a minimalist electronic style as featured on their next album<br />\\"Kid A\\".<br /><br />While many cite the second half as the downfall of the album, one could highly disagree. Example \\"Electioneering\\" has such a clinking jingle it's hard to resist. Radiohead have established an album thats as highly memorable as the first time you clicked with Pink Floyd. Twelve amazing tracks, and hits you may already know such as the shapeshifting \\"Paranoid Android\\" and softly moving \\"Karma Police\\". A must have 5/5, in disbelief? Read fellows reviewers opinions. May this album be remembered in the ranks of definitive art.
B000BPPPEU|1.0|This review is not for the movie, which i love, i grew up on this one. It's for the DVD. It is letterbox and looks like crap on a widescreen tv.

0679411585|5.0|Unlike some of my reviews, I plan to keep this one rather short.  With the number of reviews here, most of what I would say would be rather redundant.  Suffice to say that I have not read a book that touched me more in quite some time now.  While I was not there, as I was serving in another area at this time, I did have friends who were; some made it out, others did not.  I cannot imagine the horror they went through in the brief time this battle took place and I doubt very much if anyone who was not there could make that claim.<br /><br />This work is a very personal unit history of one battle during the Viet Nam War.  It is a document which covers the first real use of our Air Assault Forces; the first time they were used on this scale against a very well trained and dedicated opponent.  This battle took place during the month of November 1965 in the Ia Drang Valley.  Between October 23 and November 26, 1965 305 American soldiers were killed in what is know as the Pleiku campaign. There were many, many wounded, both physically and emotionally.  The total number of Vietnamese killed and wounded will never be known, but it is felt that it numbered in the thousands.<br /><br />The book itself is a rather personal book, and as one reviewer has pointed out, it is probably one of the best accounts of small unit combat since The Red Badge of Courage.  I not that there has been some criticism that the book spent too much time detailing and naming individuals who participated in this engagement, naming names, home towns, backgrounds and ultimate fate on the battle field.  Good grief people, many of these young men are either dead or quite old now.  I personally feel that Lt. Gen Moore would have been less than honorable to not have noted as many of these men as he possibly could have.  Their names need to be remembered.  Moore should be applauded for this and his efforts to tell their stories.<br /><br />I also note that there is criticism from some of the arm chair soldiers as to tactics, etc.  Again, good grief!  Under the circumstances I doubt seriously if another group of officers and men could have done any better nor made a better account of themselves.  As to those critical of Moore's and Galloway's writing style...again, get real!  To be quite frank and blunt, no one really cares about your literary pontifications; they simply are not relevant here, and are sort of pathetic. If you want smooth action, and a flowing story, go see a John Wayne movie or read one of those God Awful Mack Bolan books.<br /><br />The Viet Nam War was a war that almost split this nation apart.  I certainly am not going near that debate in this review.  I will say though, that no matter what side of the coin you were on, this is one that all should read.  We have young men and women in harms way at this time, and Americans need to know just what some of these young people are going though.  In a way, it does not matter who won this battle or who lost.  The fact is that many brave men, on both sides, gave their all and they should be remembered and honored.  This is by no means an endorsement of war or an attempt to glorify war as only a complete fool would do such, it is though an honorable attempt to honor those that deserve it.<br /><br />This was a wonderful work on so many levels and I do recommend it be read by all.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The OzarksAgain, good grief!

0446579939|3.0|I have read all of Nicholas Sparks books and this one was better than his last few (true believer and first sight) in my opinion. The pages kept turing but all in all the book was just okay. I never really got into the characters so it made it hard to care what really happened. I certainly didnt even come close to crying the way I used to with his books. The end was predictable and it seemed very familiar to a story I read as a child. I would say which one but that would give the end away as it is a popular book that was also recently made into a movie. If you are looking for something to read go ahead and read it but dont expect to be wowed, care about the characters or to feel any sort of emotion.

How does the Rooster Coop work?  How does it trap so many millions of men and women so effectively?  Can a man break out of the coop?  WHat if one day, a driver took his employer's money and ran?  What would his life be like?\\"<br /><br />These are the questions posed by Aravind Adiga in his savage and riveting book, a book that deservedly took the Booker Prize this year.  The book centers on the servant Balram Halwai, a man who comes from the Darkness where his fate is to work for corrupt masters who never truly \\"see\\" him or recognize him as anything other than \\"the driver\\" or \\"the servant.\\"<br /><br />But Balram is complicated.  He's had an early education.  He aspires to be a man with a \\"big belly\\", not a \\"small belly\\".  He has a resolve not to end up in a mound of indistinguishable bodies that rot in the black mud of Mother Ganga.  He wishes to live up to his early nomenclature of the White Tiger -- that rare beast that stands out among the pack.<br /><br />There is much animal imagery in The White Tiger;  the author wishes to show that in the end, we are all animals, struggling to survive in The Rooster Coop of life.  There is also an inside look at the most corrupt part of Delhi, where money speaks volumes, where decency is difficult to find, where any \\"problem\\" can be solved for a price, and where the value of a human life is cheap if that life is from a lower caste.<br /><br />The economies of Mr. Adiga's language -- the vividness of his prose -- kept me spellbound throughout this novel.  For those who enjoy it, I also recommend Mohsin Hamid's The Reluctant Fundamentalist or even better, Moth Smoke, as well as Paul Theroux's The Elephanta Suite.  I will eagerly await more work by this author.
1558908323|3.0|In 1997, Guillermo del Toro was not a rising legend in the movie business -- in fact, he was a relative newbie.<br /><br />So obviously the sci-horror flick \\"Mimic\\" was an attempt to forge roads in the rough world of Hollywood. It's a flawed gem among horror movies -- it builds up a sense of slow, shadowy horror based on what could happen if humans play God, loaded with symbolism and eerie clicking noises. But it also has an insane climax, and Del Toro's direction often gets buried under the scares.<br /><br />In the near future, children are ravaged by a cockroach-carried disease. Dr. Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) creates a solution -- a sterile mantis/termite crossbreed that will destroy the cockroaches, then die.<br /><br />A few years later, Susan buys bugs from some street kids -- and finds a Judas larva among them (which promptly vanishes). Then the kids go missing... as do the subway dwellers. When an enormous dead insect is found washed into the water treatment plant, Susan knows for sure that the Judas bug has not only survived and reproduced -- but it's evolving at a ghastly rate.<br /><br />Meanwhile, her hubby Peter Mann (Jeremy Northam), subway cop Leonard (Charles Dutton) and an immigrant (Giancarlo Giannini) looking for his autistic son all venture down into the deserted subways. But Susan has run afoul of the Judas insects -- and as all the humans huddle in an abandoned subway car, she finds that the insects have evolved even further than she thought.<br /><br />The filming of \\"Mimic\\" was apparently a pretty bad one -- Bob Weinstein and Del Toro apparently argued a lot, and Del Toro later compared the final film to a pretty girl with her arms chopped off. Sadly, a lot of Del Toro's unique style was stripped from it, since the creep factor (an autistic boy wanders through a ruined chapel) and religious symbolism get smothered in lots of \\"boo!\\" bug scares.<br /><br />But he does give \\"Mimic\\" a lot of atmosphere -- it's cloaked in a bleak, grimy, rainy atmosphere, full of decayed old subways and tangles of rusty pipes. While the science is sketchy at best, Del Toro manages to give the vaguely humanoid bugs a special quality of horror -- though the idea of insects mimicking a coated, hat-wearing man sounds silly, their crusty eyeless \\"faces\\" are pretty ghastly.<br /><br />The first half of the movie is something of a bio-mystery, slowly building the suspense about where these bugs are, and how much they've evolved. Then the story explodes into a \\"Night of the Living Dead\\"-style horror flick, with the fearful humans trapped in a small space with bugs about to smash inside, and picking them off if they venture out.<br /><br />The biggest problem? The ending. Both Susan and Peter face off against the bugs in a literally explosive finale -- the events of which stretch credibility until it snaps and zings you in the face. Really quite bad.<br /><br />Sorvino and Northam are a bit stiff at first, but both blossom when one of the bugs carries her off into the tunnels -- after that their performances are full of barely-restrained hysteria. Charles S. Dutton is the scene-stealer here as a blues-singing, sharp-tongued cop who finds himself in over his head, and ends up being the most heroic of them all.<br /><br />Buried under the surface of \\"Mimic\\" is a brilliant horror film, but the plot is dragged down by a hokey ending and mutilated direction. Maybe we'll get lucky and have a \\"director's cut.\\"s of rusty pipes.

0307277887|2.0|I'm a huge fan of Dexter the TV show, so when I found out that it was an adaptation of a novel, I really didn't think I could go wrong by checking it out.  Turns out that I could most definitely go wrong.<br /><br />The interior monologue in the show that makes Dexter come across as sweet, despite the fact that according to all societal standards he's a monster, just doesn't come through on the page.  Instead, it's more a battle for the reader to keep going as the words keep piling up and the same messages about Dexter's \\"hunger\\" seem to repeat over and over again.<br /><br />Now, please believe me when I tell you that it is RARE for me to ever advocate a video representation of any kind over a book.  99.9% of the time I believe that a book will be better than a movie or show.  Unfortunately, Darking Dreaming Dexter represents the other .1% -  The story should have gone straight to script.<br /><br />Honestly, the only reason I even gave this 2 stars is because of Showtime's success in transforming it into a very entertaining and provocative series.  So, as I said in my title (and may never say again in my life), forget the book and tune in on Sunday nights at 9!

0061150142|3.0|I really liked the formatting of this novel.  Ms. Picoult flipped back and forth between the past and the present, telling the stories of Emily Gold, Christopher Harte and their respective families in the years leading up to and the months directly following a failed dual suicide attempt between the two kids.  Since Chris was the survivor, speculations rose about whether or not Emily actually killed herself.  Evidence was gathered that suggested foul play and Chris was put on trial for her murder.<br /><br />The concept of this story was excellent.  And the literary styling of changing times, then seamlessly overlapping past and present towards the end of the novel, when the reader is learning what really happened that night, is brilliant.<br /><br />Sadly, what is not so brilliant is the final conclusion to the novel.  It felt to me that this whole emotionally-charged experience just petered out once the final verdict was read.  Unresolved conflicts between some of the minor characters were forgotten.  And the underlying thought in my mind was that of waste.<br /><br />I felt very gipped by the fact that I'd just invested so much time into reading this story - enjoying it for the majority of that time too - and then it just ENDED.<br /><br />Of course, as I'm sitting here writing this I'm also thinking back on the story as a whole and I'm actually wondering if that feeling I had might have been the point?

With Michael McDonald the music changed to more pop rock with jazz influence.  It was much more commercial, although overall I like Tom Johnston's vocals.  The harmonies enhance, not overwhelm the songs.  This collection has songs form several eras and the different types of music the band produced.  Not many bands can offer such a huge range of material.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Iron Man is witty, well-paced, superbly crafted, finely acted and packed with satisfying action sequences.<br /><br />I must admit, I was only dimly aware of the existence of Iron Man before this movie was released. Now I think he's the coolest super-hero ever, which is a testament to just how great this movie is.<br /><br />The supporting cast is solid, but the star of the show is undoubtedly Robert Downey Jr. His Tony Stark is simply perfect -  he's an affable, arrogant womanizer, confident to a fault. As heir to a fortune made from arms sales he has no difficulties performing the mental acrobatics necessary to rationalize his role in facilitating fatalities. Downey is simply fun to watch - he makes the so called 'slow' segments, where he is maturing into his superhero role while building the suit, snappy and exiting.<br /><br />The single disc edition include some extended scenes but you'll have to put down a few dollars more to get the full set of extras on the 2 disc ultimate edition. Either way, you might as well take your socks off before you press 'play'. Highly Recommended!
B0000041DF|5.0|Martha Argerich is a magnificent pianist. She is a force of nature. Her physicality is commanding and brilliant. Her unique interpretations are bold and compelling.

1416562605|4.0|\\"The White Tiger\\" describes the sordid and pathetic lives of the poor in India through a series of letters written by the main character in anticipation of a visit to India by a Chinese premier.  The epistolary premise is at times unapproachable, although it facilitates the author's amusing comparisons between China and India. The rags-to-riches tale has its funny, dark, smug, violent and disgusting moments.  It provides interesting insights into the workings of government and society in India, and how the rich, the powerful and the poor live with their preordained destinies and how a few daring individuals attempt to break out of them.  The main character's plan for escaping his fate as a servant for life seems somewhat unbelievable, given the consequences.  If it is believable, then it would be frightening on a wider scale.<br /><br />With all of that said, \\"The White Tiger\\" did not engage me from beginning to end.  Too often, I put it down without reflecting on what I had just read, and at times it was a struggle to finish.  Aravind Adiga's writing is not on the level of past winners of the Booker Prize in the same genre, such as Kiran Desai, Arundhati Roy and Salman Rushdie.  However, it is nevertheless a competent first novel, and I look forward to future works by this author.

Gregory Peck, won an Academy Award, for playing a sole parent, and he's never been better. The script for this movie was based upon Harper Lee's sensitive and intelligent novel set in racially-torn Alabama. Gregory Peck, plays Atticus Finch, a wise lawyer bravely raising his two kids Jem(Phillip Alford) and Scout(Mary Badham) in the hot-headed Southern town. The crux of the plot is Finch's defence of a colored man accused of rape. The film was put together by two excellent film-makers, producer Alan J. Pakula and director Robert Mulligan.

B001CD6FKI|5.0|From the opening frame until the very last scene.  Speed Racer kept me thrilled, excited and loving every minute of it.  From the car crashes and different racers to the characters that play their roles very well including Speed, Trixie, Pops, his mom and Racer X.  I loved the detail on the cars and the different weapons that each of them had.<br /><br />Speed was motivated because of his brothers death.  Whether or not that was his only focus.  I don't know but i do know that he used that all of that anger, hate and everything to make himself and his family that much better.  I loved the villians in the movie and a couple that you might not see as villians because of their ultimate aims.  But when i was done watching the movie.  I felt that everyone involved did a good job of faithfully recreating that same feel that I got.  The first time i watched a Speed Racer cartoon show and yes the effects in the movie can be a little bothersome sometimes and the camera occasionally as well.  The story is also quality as many things are explained and fleshed out and each character has a chance to shine throughout the whole movie.<br /><br />Overall though i am glad that i bought the DVD and give it all the respect due (5 stars).
0060558121|5.0|Wow! This book took me a long time to read. Although, we did move into a new house and my book was in some box for at least a week, maybe longer...<br /><br />I have been wracking my brain for the words to describe this book and to adequately describe its beauty and profundity (especially for those of you who have read the book); unfortunately I am just going to have to write my thoughts either way...<br /><br />This book was my introduction to Neil Gaiman. I have to say that the writing style was absolutely exquisite. This is probably the first book that I could describe what was happening without having to think about it when asked what part I was at. Gaiman has a way of drawing the reader into his world and not letting go until he is ready.<br /><br />The book begins with the main character, Shadow, in prison for a crime that is described, piece by piece, throughout the entire book. Shadow is up for parole and released a few days early due to a tragedy that I found to be quite predictable.<br /><br />On the way home, Shadow meets Mr. Wednesday, who presents Shadow with an offer of employment. At first, Shadow refuses, but ends up conceding to the proposal. The contract between employer and employee is sealed with three glasses of mead and a bar fight.<br /><br />Shadow, through his link with Mr. Wednesday, finds himself in a plethora of situations he could never have anticipated; some of which being dangerous. The myriad of people Shadow is introduced to are vibrant, wacky, familiar, and strange all at the same time. He also finds himself face to face with a person from his past whom he never thought he would see again.<br /><br />Gaiman's concept of the existence of Gods is both unique and thought provoking. Interspersed throughout the story of Shadow and his many adventures with Mr. Wednesday are the details of how each God came to exist in America. These stories are both ancient and beautiful in their magnificence.<br /><br />The book is a question of faith. An idea that beliefs can shape realities. Worship and obsession have the ability to immortalize. In the end, we all have to face our pasts, witness our beginnings, and welcome our endings. We have to decide where to draw our lines and when to take a stance, no matter how powerful the opposition. It is ourselves we answer to, the power of our beliefs give and take energy and ability from those some people hide from in fear of retribution. Our Gods and our lives are our own making.<br /><br />To describe the book too thoroughly would rob the reader of the pleasure that is reading Gaiman's work. So I must leave my review here, though I highly recommend this book be added to the top of the reading list of those of you who have not read it...d obsession have the ability to immortalize.

B00005R24K|4.0|\\"The Evil Dead\\" is an innovative, ground-breaking horror classic that has developed a cult following.  Director Sam Raimi (\\"Darkman\\" and \\"Spiderman\\") was highly influenced by other well established horror megahits such as \\"The Exorcist,\\" \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,\\" and \\"Night of the Living Dead.\\"  A young Bruce Campbell (\\"Maniac Cop,\\" \\"The Woods,\\" and \\"Bubba Ho-Tep\\") is college student Ash; him and his friends rent a secluded cabin in the mountains.  (\\"The Evil Dead\\" was filmed mostly in the backwoods of Morristown, near my home of Knoxville, Tennessee.)  Demonic forces inhabit these woods.  After discovering the Book of the Dead, the friends begin turning into demon possessed zombies.  There is levitation and green vomit spewing as in the \\"Exorcist.\\"  They have learned that only bodily dismemberment can destroy a demon.  Numerous sharp farm implements hang from the cabin's ceiling.  Ash uses a chainsaw to slice up one of his friends.  Hence, the similarity to \\"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\\"<br /><br />  Fans of Lucio Fulci (\\"Zombie,\\" \\"The House by the Cemetery, and \\"The Beyond\\") will enjoy \\"The Evil Dead.\\"  It has a tremendous amount of disgusting gore.  Some of it is too over the top for my taste.  It is this excessive gore that kept it from gaining the popularity that was achieved by \\"Halloween\\" - another low-budget horror classic.  Also, there is too much dark humor for me.  Some dialogue came across as silly.  However, it helped ease the tension created by some of the graphic scenes of demonic violence.  Furthermore, the acting and directing was amateurish, almost to the point that it lent the film a homemade feel.<br /><br />  \\"Evil Dead\\" is highly recommended for fans of zombie films, especially those which involve demons such as Lamberto Bava's \\"Demons\\" and \\"Demons 2.\\"  The DVD from Anchor Bay is excellent.  It has interesting features that include outtakes and deleted scenes and great commentary from star Bruce Campbell.  It is very educational to learn how this movie was finally released after five years of production and at a miniscule cost of $375,000.<br /><br />Note of Interest:  As stated earlier, Lamberto Bava's film \\"Demons\\" is similar to \\"The Evil Dead.\\"  His father, Mario Bava, was considered the Italian Maestro of the Macabre.

0307388840|5.0|Atonement is an extremely beautiful story about how differing perceptions of a single event can affect the lives of those involved, whether negatively or positively.     This book is told in three parts and each part is from three different perspectives.     The story begins in 1935 and is told from the viewpoint of the 13 year old Briony. Briony witnesses an event involving her older sister, Cecile, and the gardener, Robbie, that her young brain does not understand. Briony decides that Cecile would never commit such an indecent act of her own accord; therefore, Robbie must have forced Cecile into the situation.     Briony later witnesses an assault on her cousin and names the lewd Robbie as the perpetrator. Briony is unwaveringly believed in her account of the tale and Robbie is imprisoned.     Part two of the book is told from the viewpoint of Robbie. He was able to bargain an early release from prison by joining the military and being shipped off to France to fight. Robbie wants nothing more than to return to England and his beloved Cecile. His account of his struggle through the French countryside in an attempt at retreat is mesmerizing. His love for Cecile and absolute hatred for the person who tore him away from her and single handedly imprisoned him instills the same passion in the reader.    The third part of the book is told, again, from Briony's perspective. Years have passed and she is now a nurse for the wounded soldiers. She feels an immense sense of guilt for her childish take on the event so many years ago. She wants nothing more than to reconcile with Cecile and Robbie. Briony is finally able to confront the ghosts of her past and make her appeal to the parties involved. The outcome of this occurrence lies within the pages of the book itself. I will say, however, that the ending...affected me.    I found this book to be elegantly written. The language was absolutely exquisite and I identified with Briony. I could hardly put the book down...I had to force myself to stop reading each night when the hands of the clock approached 1 a.m. I was entranced with every page, every word. The tale of Briony, Cecile, and Robbie will be carried with me for the rest of my days and is now considered to be one of my most beloved experiences.
B001DU8T6S|4.0|Nothing against John Deacon and his enormous influence on the Queen sound but let's take him out of this equation for now and bring back Freddie Mercury. With these three members (May, Mercury and Taylor), instead of making a Queen album, they decide to all record some solo material but play on each others tracks. You've got 1/3 Freddie, 1/3 Brian and 1/3 Roger. If this really happened, I think most people would love it. After all, a lot of Queen music was like this anyway. Now, take out Freddie and put in Paul Rodgers. This is the album you have. Since Paul is a legend in his own right, the album is just as good.   Personally, I prefer Roger Taylor solo albums to a lot of other music anyway, so I knew I would like this. Why not 5 stars? Probably for the same reason I would not give 5 stars to most Queen releases....this is not a perfect album. Only 2-3 Queen releases warrant a 5 star release and I think most people can agree as to what those may be.  The big problem with this release is the name. Are Brian and Roger Queen? Well, I think in a manner of speaking, they are. Noone questioned Queen when they performed songs on their formal releases that were the work of 1 or 2 members (Roger Taylor being most known for this; I'm in love with my car, etc).  Important lead singers leave groups for various reasons and the group continues on with success. Why can't this one?

The First Five Pages, however, tries to tackle it all of the essentials to get published, and succeeds.  It's a boiled down overview of what you need to get published, with many helpful examples and suggestions for improving your writing.

Almost everything Noah said in the book, I agreed with, and have found many improvement to my writing style thanks to him.  If you are an aspiring novelist, this book is a must-have.

In others, it fails miserably.<br /><br />As a huge Loreena McKennitt and Enya fan from the 1980s, I've collected all of their work over the years and spent far too much money especially on Enya, beginning in 1988. That said, its fairly obvious that the last few years have not been the ones where shes excelled musically (\\"Amarantine\\" from a couple years ago was tepid, and \\"A Day without Rain\\" before that ran for less than half an hour!).<br /><br />Its also ironic that both Enya and Loreena have released Christmas albums at exactly the same time, and its even more ironic that after all this time, Loreena still sounds fresh and vital, while Enya sounds... dare I say it... bored. There is no other way to describe this virtually lifeless album. Christmas album or not, I believe albums should be worth their retail price, and more than that, they should have some sort of replay value. Like Sinead O'Connor's horrible \\"Theology\\" album some time ago, this album marks the rapid decline of Irelands' once most beloved songstress.<br /><br />Only two actual \\"Christmas\\" songs feature here, and in my book that is a good thing. The last thing we all need are the traditionals mauled by Enya, no less. \\"Trains and Winter Rains\\" is memorable here - like most of Enya's first singles, this has the same quality to it as \\"Only Time\\" (and also \\"Lazy Days\\", to a certain extent).<br /><br />Her countless versions of \\"Silent Night\\" aside, this new choral version actually works, and its a lovely end to an album that never really takes off. Tracks 6-9 especially seemed really same-sounding and boring, as if they were phoned in. Enya's usually dreamy vocals sound layered on this recording, lacking the lush orchestration that albums such as \\"Shepherd Moons\\" once displayed.<br /><br />However, in terms of uselessness, this album is easily the worst in her entire catalog (even worse than \\"A Day without Rain\\" which despite being short, at least had \\"Isobella\\" and some good tunes). If you're looking for a Christmas album with heart, this is not the one. The Loreena one is better but only marginally. I will never understand what happened to Enya and why her music is so abysmal these days.<br /><br />1. And Winter Came<br />2. Journey Of The Angels<br />3. White Is In The Winter Night<br />4. O Come, O Come, Emmanuel<br />5. Trains And Winter Rains<br />6. Dreams Are More Precious<br />7. Last Time By Moonlight<br />8. One Toy Soldier<br />9. Stars And Midnight Blue<br />10. The Spirit Of Christmas Past<br />11. My! My! Time Flies!<br />12.

B0019CSXAM|5.0|Season 3 was/is hilarious. You have Mandy Moore and Britney Spears both making an appearance at some point, you have a reference to Doogie Howser, and you have Robins Sparkles. Awesome.    Obviously, I had already seen season 3 so I knew I was buying something I wanted. MOST DEF recommend it to ALL HIMYM fans or fans of any of the actors in it. Or, if you are interested in buying a great comedy, go right ahead! You will love it!    true story.
0307455874|4.0|Obama's grand duo of books seem to have resurged themselves on bestseller lists, and of the two books, \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" is the less interesting. This is only because his other book \\"Dreams from my Father\\" was so much more compelling, and this book reads more simplistically when compared to the more 'serious' issues at hand in the other.<br /><br />\\"The Audacity of Hope\\" is Obama's commentary on all things America, its' place in the world, and where he sees the Nation. If you want to know what he as a President has to offer in terms of a) Domestic Policy and b) Foreign Policy, then this is the book for you (of course, whether or not most of these come true is another story entirely). What this is NOT, is a personal recollection of childhood days/growing up, etc. All of that is more explicitly covered in his other book. This one is definitely of a more 'political' nature.<br /><br />In Chapter 2, \\"Values\\", I found Obama to be more centrist than either Left or Right. He struck me as someone with values of the Democratic Party, but on a lot of issues he didn't sound very radically different than the Republican Party. One area I did agree was his take on Oil, and how America needs to become a self sustaining entity capable of providing oil and energy to itself without foreign dependence. What I am glad about is that he didnt quite 'hit you over the head' with pleas for a 'traditional family' with 'conservative value systems', though at heart he does seem to embody those values.<br /><br />What a great read. As someone entirely new to Obama, this was a great insight into a great mind. Its a short book, mind you, and if youre a pretty quick reader, then you'll be done with it within an evening of solid investment. Highly Recommended.<br /><br />Note - While Obama does not specifically tackle the issue of race in this book (in fact, he seems almost coy about it), try his other book for a fascinating look at how growing up as a biracial child moulded him into what he is today.
0765316897|5.0|I am a huge fantasy reader (Terry Brooks, Robert Jordan, George RR Martin, Terry Goodkind, Weis and Hickman, Paolini, etc.) and I think that this is one of the most satisfying conclusions to a trilogy that I have ever read. If you are a seasoned fantasy fan or someone looking for something different Brandon Sanderson is your man. A fully evolved and unique magic system, love-able but flawed characters, vivid battles, are all features of the three \\"Mistborn\\" books. Thank you Brandon.
B001ED7C58|2.0|Nice music, but nothing here sounds like Bella, an introspective character who reads Shakespear and the Brontes. Edward listens to classical music. If the movie is going to be a rock opera, I'll pass it by and stick with the books.
0439023483|5.0|The \\"unquestionable goodness of the Capitol\\" has organized the country of Panem into 12 districts to provide for the needs of all.<br /><br />The \\"Capitol\\" provides food and yet everyone is hungry.<br /><br />The \\"Capitol\\" provides doctors who just shrug when someone is injured and tell families to let their loved one die.<br /><br />The \\"Capitol\\" provides \\"peacekeepers\\" to keep people safe, but no one is safe.<br /><br />The \\"Capitol\\" genetically alters animals to eavesdrop and report on the populace so people school avoid \\"tricky topics\\" and keep their faces from showing any emotion.<br /><br />\\"Criminals\\" have their tongues cut out and are labeled Avox.<br /><br />To keep the general population of Panem in their place and distract them from their misery and isolation,  the \\"Capitol\\" drafts two young people, a girl and a boy, between the ages of 12 and 18, as \\"tributes\\" from each district to fight, to the death, in an Olympics style extravaganza called the Hunger Games.  Broadcast live on television, the whole country watches and hopes for the survival of their tributes.  Alas, the rules specify that there can only be one survivor.<br /><br />Gladiator meets Lord of the Flies meets American Idol meets Survivor.<br /><br />The young people are fashioned and styled and interviewed on TV to maximize their appeal and encourage sponsorships.  Then the 24 kids are released into a landscape where the climate can be manipulated by the Capitol. It is kill or be killed.<br /><br />Without a doubt this is one of the most frightening but compelling books I have ever read. Collins's writing conveys the horror of the games. We feel the characters' fear, exhaustion, and pain.  Even as they struggle to survive, the contestants are aware of the need to play to the camera.<br /><br />The narrator is a young girl named Katniss, age 16, who is used to the woods and hunting for her famiy's food but that alone cannot save her from the others.<br /><br />Like all good dystopian stories, there are elements of truth and echoes of reality that make readers shiver.<br /><br />Hurry, book 2, please.y, book 2, please.

B000E6UK5K|5.0|For all true Gilmour fans, this is just further proof of his genius.  He plays no less than four instruments on each song as well as writing the lyrics.  Many teamed up with his wife.  This is a true love story put to music.  From his ever intense lyrics to his soaring and sustaining guitar licks, this is true Gilmour at his finest.  This has become one of my favorite all time albums.  There is no one as brillant as Gilmour.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|The \\"silent Beatle\\" George was probably the best musician of the group and it shows by the friends that came to preform that night. All musicians of the highest caliber. This concert was a thing George would have enjoyed, so many friends all coming together to celebrate his life. Every song was perfect match for evening. Starting off with Ravi, Anoushka Shankar right through to Joe Brown singing one of my favorites that I keep on listening to over and over \\"I'll see you in my dreams\\". The Production beautiful, sound was great and content superb. My thanks to all for a lovely night  Denny

B000OV170W|5.0|I loved this story, including the heart breaking end, and I didn't find it cliche at all.  I thought that Anna was going to give the kidney to her sister and all would be well--typical American happy ending.  But that didn't happen, which seemed to anger some of you but I thought it was more true to life.  In real life, doesn't something usually happen to mar the perfect happy ending we usually see in movies?<br /><br />This book gets five stars from me.
B000063COX|5.0|In 1980, a new era had been formed in Heavy metal.  Metal had just exploded in a big way.    The influences of Priest an Sabbath,and the rebellion of the Punk movement helped form a movement in Great Britain called the \\"New Wave of British Heavy Metal\\".    Many classic bands will emerge from this era,to change the music world forever,and it's spearhead was this album.    Combining the twin guitar sound of Judas Priest,with the ferocity and vocal stylings of punk,and an addition of progressive rock,Iron Maiden emerges as that third great link in Heavy Metal.    The album is one of the classics of all time,a true landmark in the heavy metal genre.    There sound would become more progressive over the years,but never would they duplicate the brutality of this debut.    Prowler-Simple guitar riff underscores a classic metal track sung with insidious passion by thug child,Paul Dianno.    Sanctuary-Classic riff in song about a killer seeking redemption after the brutal murder of a woman.Still used in the live set occasionly.    Remember Tomorrow-Moody,emotional track with an eerie build from soft to heavy,which influenced the styles of several thrashers over the years.    Running Free-Obviously influenced by Priest's\\"Running Wild\\",this song of youthful rebellion,is one of the great rebellious antems metal has made.    Transylvania-Terrific instrumental,the best one they ever made.    Phantom of the Opera-The best song on the abum,and arguably,besides \\"Hallowed be thy Name\\",there best ever song.  The guitar work in here is brilliant(no words for that solo),with a combination of a THREE guitar(!) sound and one of the best riffs ever made.  Perfectly captures that aura of gothic horror,the song needs.  Dianno was NEVER better,than he is here.    Strange World-Another classic of mood and atmosphere,underscored by classic bass work of Steve Harris.    Charlotte the Harlot-The first of a series about a certain prostitute,has an odd mixture of humor and pathos,which comes together fully on the track,\\"22 Accacia Avenue\\" from The Number of the Beast(1982).    Iron Maiden-The band's greatest anthem,forever to be played a every live show.  Classic riff,and vocals by Dianno that made this his own.    Essential Heavy Metal that happens to be my personal favorite of there catalouge of music.  The band will make BETTER albums,but this is still a must.  It is one of the most defining of all metal albums.    Buy this album and love it.

B0006399FS|3.0|I did not like this CD very much. Honestly I just bought it for Vertigo and that's about it.
B001KPK6Q2|4.0|I just downloaded this album and I will say I didn't have the highest of expectations.  But now that I have listened to it, I am so very impressed with this young lady's talent!  The album genuinely makes me feel happy when I am listening to it, and it reminds me of young love, disappointment, hope, excitement; like I am going through high school again.  A bittersweet trip with emphasis on the sweet.  I definitely recommend this album!
B00000DHRX|5.0|The sound quality is remarkable, you can blast your sound system with this CD. \\"Careless Whisper\\" will take your breath away specially in a candle lit room with your special girl with you in a romantic date...
B0013FDM7E|3.0|I missed this in the theatres, although I really wanted to see it.  Lack of funds will do that.  All in all, I liked it well enough to watch it more than once, but it's one that I doubt will make it into my personal collection.  Will Smith does very well, and the directing is impressive too.  I can suspend disbelief pretty well, but there are one or two areas where I had to shake my head and look again.  I won't go into it because perhaps you'll be able to overlook what I could not.  It's worth seeing at least once, after that, it's up to you.
B000NJVWTQ|2.0|Gaudi was the Project's tenth studio album & would be the last album of Project officially. It pales in comparison to their other efforts. Parsons & Woolfson would go their separate ways after this album. Woolfson would go on to do Broadway productions, you can hear some of that in this effort. Gaudi would peak at #57 on the charts & was the last Project album to chart. There weren't any singles that cracked into any form of a Billboard chart.    The album opens with \\"La Sagrada Familia\\" which contains much of what direction that Woolfson would later take. Shortly into the song a narrator translates the title & tells us that it was the name of a temple Gaudi designed & began to have constructed. To this day it has yet to be completed. \\"Too Late\\" is somewhat more in the usual Project vein though it's not to be confused with their better efforts. There's a very tasteful sax solo within it. \\"Closer to Heaven\\" follows & slows the pace. This song is a harbinger of the songs on The Time Machine though not near as good as what's on that album. \\"Closer to Heaven\\" does have one of Bairnson's most melodic solos. The lead vocal on this song is Woolfson & probably the first time that I felt his voice wasn't appropriate for the song, it's just not strong enough. \\"Standing on Higher Ground\\" in it's opening is reminiscent of Pyramid until the vocals begin. It's a mid-tempo song that has Geoff Barradale doing his debut vocal on a Project effort. This is one of the better songs on the album but it's not great. It stands out only because so many of the other songs are sub-par. \\"Money Talks\\" is the first song on the album that has any power in it. It's also the first song on the album that allows Bairnson to do an exceptional solo proving why he's one of the most sought after session men in Great Britain. \\"Inside Looking Out\\" is NOT to be confused with the Grand Funk song of the same name. This is a slow song & doesn't feel like he has any similarity to much of the album. Lyrically itdoes a good job of stating how Gaudi had become so isolated in his life. The last third is very mellow & will remind you of Pink Floyd with the spoken word parts that aren't distinguishable. The last song on the original release is \\"Paseo de Gracia\\" & is the only instrumental. In my mind, this is the best song on the album. It's mellow also but Bairnson's acoustic lead really brings out the Spanish flavor of the song, somewhat flamenco. It's definitely closer to the Project's other & better efforts. Bairnson also does an electric solo more in the vein of classic Project instrumentals.    There are seven bonus tracks on this remastered version. The first is \\"Too Late\\" that has Woolfson doing a rough guide vocal. This was especially typical in the early stages of Project songs. There aren't any lyrics in this version, just Woolfson singing syllables. \\"Standing on Higher Ground/Losing Proposition\\" which is listed as a vocal experiment & is much shorter than the final version that appeared on the original release. Once again, it's mostly Woolfson scat singing though the refrain's lyrics are in place that features Chris Rainbow doing the background vocals. I don't really get where the \\"Losing Proposition\\" part comes in. \\"Money Talks\\" gives us a featured, but short (0:37), Chris Rainbow vocal overdub. Next is another version of \\"Money Talks\\" that's listed as a backing track rough mix. All this means is the track hadn't been finalizes & the vocals are near nonexistent. \\"Closer to Heaven\\" is listed as a sax/Chris Rainbow overdub section that clocks in at only 0:50. \\"Paseo de Gracia\\" is listed as a rough mix & almost the same length as the final version. Honestly, it's not that much different. The final bonus track is a rough mix of the opening song \\"La Sagrada Familia\\". This version is over a minute shorter than the final version. It lacks the opening narration.    Gaudi is almost certainly the Project's weakest effort. Alan Parsons IS the acknowledged master of the concept album but one would be hard pressed to believe that based on this album. Perhaps basing a concept album on the life of Antonio Gaudi is TOO conceptual, he's not a household name, at least, not around here. This was Woolfson's idea without a doubt. He would later do a Broadway production based on Gaudi.    The album sounds better than ever but you really have to be a die hard fan of the Project to like this one. There's not very many Project fans that I have met that claim Gaudi as their favorite Project album.
0441013597|5.0|A great novel is one that you can read multiple times and get something new from each new reading.  Dune certainly qualifies.    This is, I think, my third reading since I first read 'Dune' as a freshman in college.  My first reading had been a year before 9/11 and my second reading about a year after. In many ways, my second time through 'Dune' was like like reading an entirely different novel.  My awe at the vastness of Herbert's vision gave way to Herbert's ruminations on the intersection of government, religion, and violence.  The differences I found in my third reading were more subtle.  I came out of this reading thinking about the power of both fear and promises of redemption.    But subtle difference in my reaction aside, Dune is a novel I can return to again and again because Frank Herbert creates something close to the perfect science fiction novel. Herbert's universe is fantastic and intricately detailed. Societies, economies, and ecologies are all carefully crafted. Each one is entirely alien in some way but the way that Herbert's characters interact with these 'great forces' of civilization are instantly recognizable as human.    Dune, despite its purposeful depictions of human society, sweeps the reader through a story rife with betrayal, political intrigue, violence, and human struggle. Unlike other pieces of science-heavy SciFi, Dune never bogs down.    Herbert's masterpiece, almost half a century after its first publication, certainly still has something to show us about humanity, especially about the relationship between power and society and power and the individual. But there are bits of the novel that feel dated. While not as blatantly as other SciFi works at the time, Herbert's female characters lack some of the verve of the male characters.    Don't let that dissuade you. Dune is a giant in the world of SciFi for good reason. It's well worth the time of any reader with even the smallest disposition towards Science Fiction.    That said, Herbert, and later his son, followed Dune with a string of sequels. I read them all of the Frank Herbert sequels and one of Brian Herbert's after my first reading of Dune. They are all dreck. Don't even bother. But whatever you do, don't miss Dune.

B000BJS4SU|4.0|John Mayer is a \\" Very Good\\" guitarist..I've seen and been into so many guitarist that sometimes it's hard to be fair in a review, but I saw him last year in Virginia Beach when I was on vacation and he was \\"very\\" good. So if your just getting into him and don't want the \\"pop\\" records this would be a good start, it has a mix of both pop and some nice blues riffs with a great backup band.<br /><br />Highlights for me are:<br /><br />Gravity<br />Out of My Mind<br />I got a Woman
B001ED7C58|5.0|I, as well as many have read all four books in the Twilight series.  Great!! Great!!! Wonderful!!  I am a number one fan.  To me this CD fits the element of the books, kind of dark and gray.  The Paramore songs are good as well as the Rob Pattinson song!! Very talented man. Can't wait until the movie comes out!  I am sure that once we all get to see the movie, the songs will fit into place and sound even better.  Stephenie Meyer you have a hit on your hands!!
B001DU8T6S|5.0|Aaah, just when you thought Queen was finished, along comes one of Rock's greatest vocalists, one of Freddie's favorites, Paul Rodgers, and alas, Queen + Paul Rodgers is born, and a whole new sound for this rockin' band. Moments of Free, Bad Co. & of course Queen & even The Firm...What a contrast of sorts especially for those who said it would never work...Ha!    I haven't stopped listening to this album since I ordered it from the UK in September, AWESOME music, my favorite tracks, Still Burnin', a solid Bad Company sounding riff & vocals but with Queen's classic harmonies & guitar...Call Me, reminds me of Who Needs You, early Queen for those who don't remember...C-Lebrity, great rockin' baby, going to be a radio favorite surely...Voo Doo, another Bad Co. sounding song, with some great guitar work by Her Majestys Guitar, Brian May...    The title track Cosmos, reminds me of One Vision from Queen circa 1986...    The Whole Album ROCKS, Queen is Back, ooops, excuse me, Queen + Paul Rodgers are back, so welcomed too, we need some hard rock from men who know how to play it...and Paul Rodgers voice is unsurpassed, he truly is \\"the voice\\"...Roger Taylor's Drums, he still has it...and Brian May, well, he's been knighted by the Queen...    Long Live Queen & Freddie Mercury!  Long Live Queen + Paul Rodgers!
B001ED7C58|1.0|I can not believe this! Twilight gives off such a great vibe when you read it and now its being thrown away with oh so teen trendy techno. Excuse me I just threw up in my mouth. I do not blame Mrs. Meyer,its usually the soundtrack and executive producer making this decision. Wow guys great job you took a great book and turned it into THE COVEN part 2! These songs distract from the feeling instead of elevating it.
B001AHM2C6|4.0|I love both composers and to have them work together for this soundtrack is great.
B001DPHDCY|2.0|I was looking forward to this movie, and it got good reviews. But I found it worse than disappointing when I watched it. The adaptation misses the warmth of Seuss, the big hearted humanity, and the wonderful weirdness. Yes, Horton is right and the rest of the \\"Big\\" world is wrong, but in the original Seuss is kind to both sides. In this adaptation the bad guys are unrelentingly shrill and unpleasant, while Horton is annoyingly superior all the way through. Neither side is able to convincingly grow or learn. Among the \\"Who,\\" the characters are almost as thin, although there is a very slight story about a father and son learning to work together. I also found the animation unsatisfying. It is very good -- smooth and colorful -- but it is not Seussian. My recommendation -- if you don't already have it, get \\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas\\" -- the original, animated version, not the live action. If you already own \\"Grinch,\\" just get it out and watch it again.

1582701709|4.0|I read many of the reviews last night.  I am writing my review to give others food for thought.     I like the book.  The repetitive aspect is to bring the point home. This is how we learn things by doing or reading them over and over again.  The Secert for the person who asked what it was.    Ask-with gratitude  trust-with gratitude  believe-with gratitude    Be grateful for what you have, turn your attention, thoughts and feelings to what you have and that gratitude, live in that way and ask for what you want in the same way.     I would agree that the ignore overweight people could have been stated better.  Her point I think was more to not identify yourself with the overweight people if you want to have you perfect weight.     One the Holocaust comment.  She did not blame the Jews for that, nor did she blame the natural disasters on those in them. There are genocides happening at this very moment in other counties.  The Jews were not the only ones that suffered in the Holocaust.  She said something in their thoughts put them there at that time and that place.  A much simpler example.  You are buying a house.  You have narrowed it down to two houses.  One is in a flood zone, and 10,000 dollars cheaper than the one not in the flood zone.  The Realtor tells you this area has not flooded in 30 years. So you buy the house in the flood zone and two years from when you buy your house get flooded.  Your thought process put you in the house that flooded.      The science remark of no real scientists would believe the law of attraction is the same as the law of gravity.     Not too many years ago real scientists said it was a fact that the Sun revolved around the earth.  They said it was a fact that the Earth was flat. It was scientist that did not accept the \\"fact\\" that showed us differently. If those how invent things thought like the people who wrote all the negative review nothing would be invented and they would not have been able to read the book much less post a review from their computer.       On a final note.  If you purchase a book and you get one thing out of it that benefits you then the book was worth the money to purchase it.  At least that is how I feel about books. You don't have to agree with everything the author says either.      I hope that has provided those reading the reviews with food for thought.     I have learned a couple of things from the book to add to my work on progress which is myself. I do not think it was a waste of money.
0060574216|5.0|This book changed my life. It was the first relationship book that made sense of how men and women communicate with each other.     Some things never change and that goes for the way men and women think. That is why this book remains popular today. Men and women are wired differently. It's as simple as that.    John Grey gives us actual tools we can use to understand each other. These tools work.    Through the years, I have gone back again and again to reread this book. It's a must have in understanding the opposite sex. Nancy Marlowe
B00028HBKM|3.0|If one can accept the distortions of Herod and Pilate, and the depiction of the masses as bloodthirsty, sinister Jews willing to go against their own tradition of never supporting the execution a Rabbi then you have a compelling film, conveying the message that the ultimate Love is sacrifice and Jesus Of Nazareth willingly endured unimaginable pain so as to overcome it and cleanse and Save the Souls of all of those who believe in Him. Was his last days as, in today's lexicon, a \\"hybrid\\" Diety-Human more of an exhibition, even to the extent of asking his Father, \\"Why Hast Thou Forsaken Me?\\". As God's Son, would he have the Power to miraculously avoid the suffering? A big question for this Reviewer.<br />To the actual film: I think it would have worked better as a Play, even a Ballet. Has a very, staged, mechanical look to it. If Gibson really did reference Anne Emerich's writing (and possibly his own Father's insensitive comments about Jews today), then perhaps he was trying to teach or at least share with Christians *and* Jews, his personal take, albeit awkward, on the events of two thousand years ago.<br />\\"Tough Love\\" perhaps? The bludgeoning of the viewers senses with continuous corporeal beating of the man who represented Peace?<br />But good intentions cannot surmount biased historical perspective: I submit that there were enough Jewish-Christians in the supposed angry masses to suppress the desires of a small minority who didn't understand the situation as a whole and *and* their own Peaceful tradition.<br />Mel, \\"The Year Of Living Dangerously\\", \\"Lethal Weapon(s)\\", and \\"Braveheart\\" are your celluloid domain. Put this film on the same shelf as \\"Signs\\".
B001FBSMW6|5.0|This could be the best Keane album. Initially it really sounds different, especially the tracks Spiralling, Better Than This and You Haven't Told me Anything. But it has some typical \\"Keane songs\\", like Again And Again and Black Burning Heart.    All of this stuff sounds pretty good for me, as good as the previous album Under the Iron Sea (which has some great songs, like Leaving, Put it Behind and Frog Prince, but has some really boring stuff as well) but not at the Hopes and Fears level. I would highlight Black Burning Heart ... really great, reminds of Bend & Break.    But what really puts this album at another level is the title song, Perfect Symmetry. A masterpiece that seems too good even for them. One of the best I have ever listened to, you have to go back years (or decades) to really see someone doing things as good as this.
B0001I562I|5.0|I loved this film when I was a kid. And looking back on it, I can clearly see why. The concept of an ordinary kid being a navigator of a spaceship really became something unusual back then. And it's still a benchmark in children's sci-fi as of today. The scientific analysis of the connection between the kid and the spaceship didn't make sense to me back then, but now it's clear, and it's sort of creepy if you think about it. Paul Reubens as Max is a treat, and the supporting cast (especially Sarah Jessica Parker as McAdams) are attention-grabbing. The music is now corny compared to back then, but it's still quite catchy. All in all, it's an entertaining family film . . . that should get a better treatment on DVD!
0061474355|5.0|At first glance this book didn't seem that promising but after reading literally the first pages I was hooked! Pulls you from start to finish and thankfully there's the rest of the trilogy to read (The Abhorsen Trilogy). Characters that remain in your heart even after the story is done (gotta love that Mogget). Enjoyed the refreshing concept of the gates (rivers) into the world of the dead and how they are accessed by using bells. Love the idea of an Abhorsen (sorcerer who returns the dead) as opposite to a Necromancer (sorcerer who's brings back the dead) and adore the explanation of \\"Free Magic\\" and the dimensions of the two worlds. Very well written book resonates very much with my \\"woo woo\\" ways. This trilogy is part of my all time favorites!  Would make a thrilling Movie!

1423101464|5.0|My son who is 13 yrs old, couldn't put it down.  We ended up buying the whole series.  It was very nice to see him want to read!  He is really hoping for another one to come out soon :)
0446615625|3.0|Since the copy I am currently reading--at exactly the mid-point of the book--was found in a New York City subway car I can't complain about the price. This is the first David Baldacci book I've read, so I'll take other reveiwers' word that he has done better.     All in all, while I agree with many comments regarding the plethora of characters and seemingly implausible plot line(s), it is a pleasant enough book, certainly an engaging beach read. I AM glad, however, that I didn't have to buy it in hardcover.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I love this soundtrack!   Fell in love with Paramore because of it.  Not to mention in listening to it I feel like I already know exactly where each of the songs would appear in the movie.
B001GQ2TGA|1.0|Imagine the Beatles never progressed from their style on A Hard Days Night... would you want to listen to Sgt. Peppers album if it was all done in the same early sixties style?  No... the Beatles would have bombed.    Sadly that's what this album from Enya is, a continuation of her earlier work which might better be called variations of Watermark... There is nothing new on it and your left thinking she must be a one trick pony.  Some parts of the songs could easily be samples from earlier ones...     While I have been a fan of hers for quite some time... this album is simply horrible... one would have hoped for some musical growth, but there is none... entertaining for someone that has never listened to her earlier work... but for others just go relisten to any of her earlier work and you'll be just as happy and save the $20 for the CD.
B0000WN0ZK|1.0|This mod movie is a real \\"get over yourself\\" kinda film.  I felt like I needed a beret & an espresso just to watch it.  Sulky behavior, models in go-go boots and cigarettes does not a movie-make!
B001F290E4|4.0|I picked this up last night after a long day at work and something about Seals voice just cheered me up. It's not as upbeat as his last album and it's not experimental or anything, but it's the perfect album for this weather. Plus, my girlfriend started dancing around when she heard \\"I Can't Stand The Rain.\\" If that isn't a sign, I don't know what is. Thanks Seal!
B000YENUI6|5.0|It's such a simple, nearly cliched, mob story. But it's told here with a frankness and brutality that is something to behold. Not an uplifting tale, but a gritty tale that seems, as much as these things can to a random middle class American, realistic. The tattoos are remarkable as is the look at a very different (Russian) mafia.
0810993139|5.0|[[ASIN:0810993139 Diary of a Wimpy Kid]] is book is so funny! first of all I just wanna say, don't listen to any review under 4 stars. Some people find this book inappropriate, as if it sets bad examples for middle school children. For example they say it makes kids think they should lie to their parents, be mean to their friends, and think its fun to scare little kids.The people who write this reviews don't understand middle schoolers. I am one, and let me tell you that is pretty much what the average kind of middle school boy does. Also those are only the bad qualities of W.K. he also has many good qualities, but I don't really have to explain them because they are the kind of qualities anyone has.          I will admit W.K. isn't smarter than average(but that's kind of the  point) but that's how kids(who don't know this already)know not to do the bad things he sometimes does.                        This book is hilarious story of new sixth grader just entering middle school, who describes all the problems of a middle schooler that most kids can relate to, in diary form. It is enjoyable to read a book as if it is talking to you. Parents who didn't like this book are probably the kind of parents who should learn not act like the parents in the book. The mother is a sort of a mom who thinks she understands children but doesn't really. the dad isn't really bad or good,but kinda weird. Both parents pay much more attention to W.K.'s little brother Manny. his older brother Rodrick is your basic mean and occasionally helpful older brother. All together this is an amazingly funny journal of Greg Heffley over the course of a year, I recommend it to any social person.Also I recommend the sequels (:[[ASIN:0810994739 Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules (Diary of a Wimpy Kid)]]              [[ASIN:0810970686 Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw (Diary of a Wimpy Kid)]] [[ASIN:0810979772 Diary of a Wimpy Kid Do-It-Yourself Book]]
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Not a deep story, but a very pretty one on the screen. Not completely kid friendly as the violence is quite frightening. (Age nine.) Though the story is quite similar to the book of the same title, it has a very different feel to it. This is a whole lot lighter and feels that much less real. But it's more fun too.
0307455378|3.0|(NOTE - I read this book in Spanish, it's due out in English in June 2009)    The book is beautifully written, there were literally parts I read two or three times for the sheer beauty of the writing.  However, I just couldn't get into the story.    Unlike his prior book, \\"La Sombra del Viento\\" (\\"Shadow of the Wind\\"), which I consider one of the best books I've ever read, I was never engaged with the characters.  I found the story to be too long.    I thought it was too slow, had too many characters, had a confusing plot and had an unlikable (at least to me) protagonist.  And then, Ruiz Zafon went all magical realism on me.  He completely lost me.  By the end of the book I really didn't know what was going on, or why.    But again, the writing is just so beautiful that I pretty much finished the book just to keep reading the writing, not because of the story.
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|Saw this with my girlfriend. She cried at the end. This is a well made film. There is one breathtaking shot of Keira Knightley's character posed on the edge of a cliff, with a magnificent backdrop. I would love to have a poster sized print of it up on the wall. An excellent stay at home date movie. Very humorous too.
0765348276|5.0|The question you need to ask yourself about this book isn't whether you should read it, it's why haven't you read it yet? Old Man's War is very nearly a perfect Sci-Fi book. Everything is in place, and artfully done.<br /><br />The book starts out be clubbing you over the head with its incredibly compelling main character, in the best possible sense. John Perry is so relatable, so human, that you might wonder partway into the first chapter whether you've accidentally picked some sort of biography instead of a work of Science Fiction. John doesn't go out of his way to explain gadgetry or how his world is different from yours, he just lives his life, and lets the explanation come naturally.<br /><br />The universe that John Perry eventually involves himself in is very well thought out, and always intriguing. There are twists and turns, and conventions are constantly thrown out the airlock. I would rather spoil as little as possible, so the short of it is that this is fairly hard Sci-Fi on a galactic scale, with plenty of starships and war. Throughout that, however, there's always a healthy sense of character and the overall universe. The technology is in place to further the story, and not the other way around.<br /><br />There have been numerous comparisons to the Robert Heinlein, and in my opinion those comparisons are both completely on and completely off. They're on in that Scalzi is incredibly capable at adapting modern-day politics and drama into a more futuristic setting. This makes for not only compelling reading, but something that seems eerily possible. The comparisons are off in that Scalzi doesn't go off into pages and pages of thinly veiled political rants- much more of the book is direct experience, with a lot less space spent on treatises and exposition.<br /><br />Old Man's War is my favorite Sci-Fi book of the year, and I say that after having just finished works written by both Heinlein and Larry Niven. Scalzi easily equals either of these genre heavyweights. I immediately picked up the two sequels, The Ghost Brigades and The Last Colony after reading this book, and I can assure you that you might as well do that yourself, because you're going to want to finish the whole story arc. There are two spinoff works, The Sagan Diary and Zoe's Tale, that are not critical to the main arc, and that I can't recommend as strongly.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who's at all interested in Sci-Fi.p the two sequels, The Ghost Brigades and The Last Colony after reading this book, and I can assure you that you might as well do that yourself, because you're going to want to finish the whole story arc.

B001BNFR6W|5.0|I really liked this series on TV and wanted to keep it for  viewing some other time.  As usual, Amazon got my selection here in great condition and in the expected time.
9562911640|5.0|I found this book after watching the movie The Secret. It is absolutely wonderful and I highly recommend it to anyone who desires to grow in life. The 24 week course laid out in the book, will assist you in developing your inner abilities, such as the ability to visualize and since our mind thinks in pictures, it is a wonderful tool to develop.   This is a great book.
B000B8QEYC|3.0|I was curious about Enya when I first heard of her; due to my love to U2's music and knowing that Enya became Irland's second biggest musical export after U2 (she's from Irland, such a bad stereotype on my part).<br /><br />There's no way one's can deny her beautiful voice and remarkable style, but I came to think that all her music has the same redundant theme when it comes to lyrics or music.<br />This album reached the top 10 in both the UK and the US, peaked at number 3 in Germany, won the Grammy award for best new age album for 2007, and I'm in disbelief and trying to understand what is so special about this album.<br /><br />The reason I'm giving it three stars is that she is a hard working artist with glorious presence on the stage(at least she's not winking at the audience and acting cheesy like il Divo boys). With the inimitable style she has, maybe it is expected to have a theme in all her albums, but the lyrics of this album don't measure up to the standards she had in her other albums and they are either too repetitive and empty or just beyond my mental capacity. I'll go with the first choice; the lyrics are repetitive and empty.
B001ED7C58|1.0|I thought this was a big disappointment. I love the Twilight series, and this music just doesn't go. What's up with the remix? No. Even the Mr. Pattinson's song just didn't have \\"it\\". If you love Twilight no matter what, then buy this cd. If, like myself, want the soundtrack  to correlate to the movie/books at least a little then don't bother. :(
1593080255|5.0|Basil Hallward is an artist, who paints a portrait of Dorian Gray, a very good looking and naïve young man. The portrait is a masterpiece that in reality depicts Basil's feelings for Dorian, as well as, Dorian's youth and beauty.<br />Lord Henry Wotton, a seductive emotional predator and selfish pleasure seeker, is a friend of Basil who meets Dorian at Basil's house and gives him a philosophical speech about the fading nature of youth and beauty.  Dorian whose greatest qualities are his youth and beauty pledges his soul to stay young and beautiful.  As part of the deal Dorian Gray's portrait becomes the surrogate for the disgrace and aging of the real Dorian Gray.<br />Under the growing influence of Lord Henry over Dorian, the later embraces Hedonism and increasingly sinks into a sinful corrupt life and shows no regard for values or morals.  A tragic event caused by Dorian's behaviors starts the projection of Dorian's ugliness and self -centeredness on the portrait. Dorian creates excuses and excuses himself with lame explanations for the tragedy and hides his portrait so he can't see the hideous transformation of himself reflected in his picture.  As long as his beauty remains, he can ignore the changes in his portrait.  It's interesting how Dorian tries to avoid his inner feeling of ugliness by trying to surround him self by beauty, and other beautiful distractions such as roses and music.<br /><br />Basil's love for Dorian, which is likely a real life reflection of Wilde's love for Lord Alfred Douglas, causes Basil to defend and protect Dorian, even from his self destructive acts, until the last shocking event. I'm tempted to describe the ending event, but I won't deprive the reader from the pleasure of exploration and discovery.<br /><br /> Given the period when this novel was written, Wilde is artistically candid and courageous beyond belief. Wilde displays his usual wit, sarcastic playful ways and funny style, while he walks us through serious dilemmas like the supremacy of youth and beauty, homosexual feelings, repentance and murder. Wilde grabs the reader through the use of shocking events that not only criticize Victorian morality, but ironically displays a moral lesson about vanity and narcissism.<br /><br />\\"The picture of Dorian Gray\\" is a wonderful piece of literature in which the portrait asserts itself as Dorian's conscience in a superficial society that places values on looks and wealth while ignoring the real value of humans. Simply, a one of a kind work.nd beauty, homosexual feelings, repentance and murder.

B001F290E4|5.0|I have been a Seal fan since his first record, and this is without a doubt the record that Seal needed to record.  It is an opportunity to really hear the man sing.  I love the fact that he had the courage to record an album of only covers, because frankly these are incredibly hard songs to pull off, but he does with grace, power and emotion and makes them his own. This is an outstanding album on every level. Choice of songs, production, arrangement and most importantly, vocal performance! This man is one of the greatest vocalists alive and this album is testament to that and a JOY to listen to! Any fan of Seal will LOVE this album and any first time listeners will too. Once again, i am hooked!
0316776963|5.0|When I opened this book I had limited time so I decided to look for the shortest essay in the book so I could sneak in a quick read.  I selected \\"Big Boy\\" which started on page 97 and ended before the next essay that started on page 100.  By the end of the first paragraph I was already laughing and saying, aloud, \\"oh geeze\\".  I laughed through all three pages and found myself incredibly impressed with his writing, his insightful observations, and how he captures (through nothing but words) an experience worth sharing with the reader.<br /><br />When my husband came home from work, I placed the \\"Big Boy\\" essage in front of him and said, \\"you have to read this\\".  Same thing happened.  By the end of the first paragraph he had a huge smile and was snickering quietly.<br /><br />I will never look at a burrito the same way.<br /><br />This book is a keeper.
B0013FNC38|4.0|Okay, I love Jason Mraz. I have great respect for him and his songwriting abilities, and I love his fun, easy style. I did not, however, enjoy Jason's new album as much as I hoped. Some of the songs were undeniably Jason's... for example, I'm Yours, Live High, Love for a Child, Details In the Fabric, etc., and those are the ones I love. But then there were others... and that, I think, is where it goes downhill. I don't like the style exhibited in, for example, Coyotes. It just doesn't work for me. I miss the 'Waiting For My Rocket To Come' and 'Mr. A-Z'  Jason, who was unpredictable by chance, and didn't seem to be trying so hard to be so.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|This CD is AMAZING! After her first CD I didn't think it could get any better but it did! I have been listening to this CD nonstop since I got it. Her songs are relatable, if I had a daughter I would want her to listen to Taylor Swift because she is a great role model for everyone. Everyone should own a copy of her CD.     The best songs on here are \\"Change\\" \\"Love Story\\" and \\"The Best Day\\", Which is a beautifully written song about a mother/daughter relationship.
B001EYGOEM|4.0|This is a great album by Taylor Swift. Catchy melodies, beautiful lyrics, breathtaking vocals. My only issue with this album is that some of the songs sound strangely alike... for example, Love Story and The Way I Loved You. But it's not obvious, and both songs are great so why complain? Taylor is a great role model and seems like a wonderful person who deserves success. Of course, this album isn't for everyone, so I'd suggest a sample listen before you buy it just to make sure you don't mind the resemblance to pop and the recurring musical themes.
B0019CSXAM|5.0|I love this show and have been a fan since the first season.  The writing is great and the actors bring the characters to life flawlessly.  As far as half hour sitcoms go, this one is top notch.
B00004Z4WR|4.0|The case and disk looked fine when I got them but when I played the disk it skipped a couple times, I am almost certain the disk was just smudged because there was no visible damage to the disk. I would've liked to receive the item faster but other than that it was a good transaction.
0375424474|5.0|Reading this book reminded me of the new book by Frank John Ninivaggi, MD at Yale. Ayurveda: A Comprehensive Guide To Traditional Indian Medicine for the West says similar things. It broadens one's views on health, evolution, our biological selves, and ecological intimacy with nature. Two highly intelligent scientists give us a look into reality, with reference to its possible meaning for humankind. Wow! how great is the human mind!!
B00003CXXJ|5.0|The disks were both clean and scratch-free and the case was pristine. I would buy from this seller again in a heartbeat.
0740748475|5.0|I just received them today, I had to let you guys know that there was nothing wrong with product. No dents, scratch, etc... I didn't open the actually books, because it is a gift to someone else. I was so nervous that I would get them, and the package would be damage, but nothing!!!
0930289234|1.0|I recently reread this novel and was sorely disappointed. Props for the complex plot, for sure, but scratch the surface and all you'll find beneath is some Ayn Rand Lite, complete with a raging hatred of women. Given my previous admiration for the novel, I was truly shocked by its revanchist politics. I guess I was too young (or young enough?) last time I read it. Negative and aggressive comments from fans in 5, 4, 3, 2 . . .
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|And I thought I would be the only person to see this movie more than once. I took my 15-year old granddaughter with me the first time -- she has now seen it 5 times by taking all her friends. I have seen it 4 times and am eagerly awaiting the DVD release. This is such a feel-good, uplifting movie. Like other reviewers have said, Pierce Brosnan is not known for his singing, but his belting-out several songs really added to his resume. And I've become a huge fan of Stellan Skarsgaard (Harry). I can't say enough wonderful things about Meryl Streep. I would just love it if this movie and/or its actors were nominated for an Oscar. I've always been a big fan of ABBA, so almost along with most of the songs until my granddaughter poked me in the ribs and told me I was embarrassing her! Gotta get that DVD.  Follow-up: After getting that DVD, I'm disappointed in the quality of the sound; the music goes in \\"waves\\" of volume -- in and out. I purchased 2 DVDs; both of them have the same problem.
B001BNFR6W|1.0|1/3 of the discs are damaged and can't be watched. I am only through seasons 1-5 at this point. How do I get a replacement?
1590171993|2.0|If you define a hero as someone who doesn't shoot his wife, child and self when it's really what ought to be done -- because not a one of them takes any charge of his or her own life -- then ok, William Stoner is your hero.  But not mine.    Consider: perhaps the only time in his life that Stoner showed some gumption was when he was about 20.  He switched majors from Agriculture to Literature, thus changing the course of his life.  But after that, it's all down hill.      Nowadays, the woman he ended up marrying would be labelled clinically depressed.  In Shakespeare's time, she'd have been called a shrew in dire need of taming. But Stoner's time was neither now nor the Middle Ages.  And so he spends the remaining 45 years of his wretched life sleeping on the couch, banished from his wife's bed, unable to stand up to her even when she spends her days thinking up new ways to screw with the psyche of their one and only child.    And this is a hero?    And work doesn't go much better  -- he gets pushed around there, too.     In the real world, quietly suffering dolts like Stoner usually end up making back-page news in the Kansas City Star: they buy a .38 at WalMart one hot summer's night, then come home and calmly blow away their family before turning the gun on themselves.      But no, our Stoner is a hero, see, because he takes the cards life's dealt him.  But why, one really must ask, does he never ask the dealer for a hit?
B00012QM8G|5.0|This movie needs to be seen by everyone, and the special features are just as good and informative as the movie. The movie is probably the highly of Spielberg's career. It is about Oscar Schindler who was a Nazi and who saved many Jews during the Holocaust. This movie is shown in black and white, which really draws the audience into the movie and the feel of the 1940s. The only color is a red coat on a little girl, which Spielberg does intentionally so pay attention to that. This is emotionally charged and I usually cry a great deal during this movie. It is an absolute must see by everyone. It is long but is worth it. If you only get one movie this year it should be this one! Amazing from start to finish.
B0015FML06|5.0|Finally, this classic concert movie is on DVD, along with the mini album that captures U2's War tour wonderfully. The DVD includes the other songs from their famed Red Rocks concert in Denver Colorado in 1983 which were not on the original VHS tape, but that were on a widely circulated bootleg of the show. This concert,even though the crowd was cut in half due to the cold and rainy weather, was a landmark show that put U2 on the national map in much the same way that their Live Aid performance in 1985 catapulted them on their way to super stardom. This show captures them at that point when they were transitioning themselves into a major rock act, showcasing their talent of bringing the audience close together and to them on the stage. They were still honing their sound and their playing, and the sheer emotion of this performance is set against the eerie fog and cold of the evening. Highlights of this DVD are New Years Day, Sunday Bloody Sunday, I Threw a Brick Through a Window, and Electric Company. It had their trademark ending song of 40, which is base on the 40th Psalm. Great band, great DVD and CD. If you are just getting into U2's more recent stuff, you need to listen to this to get a feel of where they have come from.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|This is another amazing CD by the rock band Evanescence. If you have ever seen the show \\"The Tudors\\" on Showtime, their song Lacrymosa was used for previews and promos. There are many great songs on here such as \\"Snow White Queen\\" and \\"Call Me When Your Sober\\". These songs are a less dark than their previous album but still carry then same tone that I have come to love out of this band. And Amy Lee (the lead singer) still has an amazingly haunting voice. I highly recommend this CD.
0385340990|4.0|The title of this book caught my attention and the content caught my imagination.  It is a well written story that is easily read in short bursts or in one or two long sittings.
B000687M48|5.0|This is a great CD, just be aware that it is just a live version of the Fallen album. This is a live show they did in Paris and there are a couple new songs on this so if you are debating between the two CDs, I would get this one. It also comes with a bonus DVD of their live show so you can actually watch the concert as well which I liked. Personally, I have both this CD and the Fallen album (because this came out after Fallen) but I don't regret buying either. Like I said, if you are debating between Fallen or this, get this one. It is well worth it!!
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Robert Downey Jr. was awesome in this flix in every which way. I can't wait for the next one to come out in theaters!
B000P12LWY|5.0|I love this period of history, I studied it in master's school. This is a great series and I cannot wait till season 2 comes out on DVD. Do not expect this to be historically accurate because it is not. Although in season 2 they get a little bit better with following history. Nonetheless, this is entertaining and Jonathan Rys Myers is amazing as Henry VIII, even if he doesn't really look like him. This is a drama filled, sometimes raunchy series that will get you hooked from episode 1. If you want to learn about the Tudors and the whole era, I suggest you pick up a book by David Starkey or some other historical work.
1595822003|5.0|Mary Shelley's story comes to life thanks to Bernie Wrightson's drawings! A must have for any fan of classic horror.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is an amazing CD and my favorite band. Amy Lee (the lead singer) has a hauntingly beautiful voice. Her voice is like an angel but it fits witht the alternative rock style that this band is. The songs on this CD can be a little dark but I think most people will enjoy the songs and appreciate the lyrics. Every song on this CD is amazing, which is why I think the entire CD is worth the buy. You will not be disapointed. One similar artist is Flyleaf so if you have heard them and liked their music then you will definitely enjoy Evanescence.
B0002S94OS|5.0|I've been a metal fan since Kill 'em All first came out (Metallica - 1983), and more specifically primarily thrash metal. Some of my faves for reference sake:      Metallica - Kill 'em All, ...And Justice for All    Slayer - Reign in Blood, South of Heaven, Seasons in the Abyss    Sepultura - Chaos A.D., Schizophrenia    Pantera - Cowboys From Hell, Vulgar Display of Power    Biohazard - Urban Discipline    I realize they're all older generation (but then so am I). Then I heard LOG about a year ago (Sacrament had just come out) on satellite radio and was blown away. It had a unique modern American Metal sound with hints of Slayer and Pantera. So naturally I headed to the music store to get their latest CD. But all they had was Ashes of the Wake. Lucky for me. This CD is without question LOG's masterpiece. The album is enjoyable from start to finish...not a mediocre tune on it. And the production and how it was recorded are just top notch. I've since acquired Sacrament and As the Palaces Burn, which are good, but don't compare to Ashes. Palaces has a more unrefined and lower quality production sound and Sacrament just doesn't have that addictive quality Ashes has (maybe too much bass...sounds a little muffled). The more you listen to Ashes, the more you want to hear it again. You won't go a week without listening to it through and throught at least one time.
B000068TPN|5.0|This movie is action packed and emotionally charged. This is a great film from start to finish and Mel Gibson was absolutely amazing. You get drawn into this film from the beginning and you start to understand what our Vietnam veterans went through over there. This film is specifically focusing on the first battle between the US military and the North Vietnamese soldiers. It was a brutal battle. If you liked the movie, I would highly recommend buying the book... and vice versa. Again, I absolutely love this book. It is one of my favorites. I think I've seen it over a dozen times. A must buy.
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|Enya is back in this release, sooner than most of us expected after \\"Amarantine\\". This release will please most Enya fans, with its classic Enya instrumentation and layered vocals. But it does offer a couple surprises, showing that Enya continues to mature and innovate.<br /><br />About half of the songs on this CD are Christmas-related. This means that you can probably still listen to half of the CD throughout the year, if you plan on transferring the tracks to a portable media player. There are only two traditional Christmas carols -- \\"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel\\" and \\"Oiche Chiuin\\", leaving everything else as original compositions.<br /><br />The songs seem to celebrate past, present, and future, exhibiting both a young and old feel and appeal to them. Several of the songs evoke those child-like ideals everybody has around the holidays. For the most part, songs like \\"White is in the Winter Night\\", \\"Trains and Winter Rains\\", and \\"One Toy Soldier\\" are bright and up-beat. \\"Trains and Winter Rains\\" even sports a \\"locomotion\\" effect in its composition. The remaining tracks are mid-to-low tempo, and emote the general melancholy that has been present in many Enya compositions over the years.<br /><br />The biggest surprise on this release is \\"My! My! Time Flies!\\", which seems to be taken right out of the 70's. This isn't a bad thing. It features a very unique sliding vocal (something new from Enya), more percussion than usual, and even an electric guitar solo. It's very \\"poppy\\" and should appeal to a wide audience.<br /><br />As a winter and holiday-themed album, you'll hear tamburines, jingling bells, tubular bells, and joyous swells at the ends of some songs. \\"One Toy Soldier\\" tells an interesting story, and ends with a very heart-felt Christmas chorus. You'll hear many of these themes throughout the album.<br /><br />From an engineering perspective, the album shines. Everything, for the most part, is crystal clear -- from the vocals to the pizzicato strings.  The vocal engineering on \\"O Come, O Come, Emmanuel\\" and \\"Oiche Chiuin\\" will make you want to escape into an empty room and turn up the volume really loud.<br /><br />Enya fans will pick this up without a thought. I think this release will appeal to a larger audience because of its Christmas themes, so those who may not have purchased recent Enya albums could be drawn back. Undoubtedly it is an album you will pull out every holiday season.\\" and \\"Oiche Chiuin\\" will make you want to escape into an empty room and turn up the volume really loud.

B0012QE4Q2|4.0|I was so happy when this came out on film because I loved the book. The book this movie is based on is historical fiction so I knew it was not going to be historically accurate but this movie does take some facts and stretch them pretty far. So if your looking to learn something about Anne Boleyn don't go to this movie. But this movie is very entertaining and the costumes are perfect. You did get a sense of what it was like during that time period and what the two girls went through. There are some nice special features as well. Yes, this movie is historically inaccurate, but all movies are unless they are a documentary. So if you keep in mind this is a movie to ENTERTAIN you, then you will enjoy it. Natalie Portman does a great job as Anne Boleyn.

080701429X|5.0|[[ASIN:1414313047 The 4:8 Principle: The Secret to a Joy-Filled Life]]<br /><br />This is an excellent book that continues to impact and influence a new generation of readers. Frankl's account of his time in Nazi death camps where he experienced the death of his pregnant wife, parents, and brother as well as other horrors placed Frankl in a position of real authority to share wise counsel in this area. His experiences and observations, ultimately leading to an incredible understanding of human nature.<br /><br />Though he experienced unimaginable tragedy and adversity, he nontheless realized great truth. After reading and even re-reading his story, it is hard to imagine he authored these famous words, \\"The one thing you can't take away from me is the way I choose to respond to what you do to me. The last of one's freedoms is to choose ones attitude in any given circumstance.\\"<br /><br />This message is a profound reminder to all of us who, in our more routine lives, may, from time to time, forget that regardless of what is going on around us, we can maintain control of what is going on within us.<br /><br />This is a \\"TOP TEN\\" classic and should become a part of your self-growth library.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!
1595141979|5.0|The Vampire Academy series is addicting, & \\"Shadow Kiss\\" is the best yet. As usual, the plot movies quickly, so I read the book in 2 days. There are so many developments, one being that Adrian looks like he will be around to stay. I'm very glad about that; Adrian adds a lot of humor to these books, & he is a little shady. Who knows what could happen with him later?     I can't give away the biggest change because I don't want to ruin the the surprise for anyone. Rose & Dimitri's relationship is forever changed, but I enjoyed the way that it played out. I think it's a good thing to irrevocably shake things up in a book. Otherwise, the plot gets too predictable. \\"Shadow Kiss\\" is anything but predictable. In the last chapter, Rose makes a huge decision, which leads the series into a direction I would have never anticipated, but I know that Richelle Mead will make the next book even better than \\"Shadow Kiss.\\"

B001GQSY5U|5.0|I am surprised the original release of this movie had a bonus features disk. I expected LFL to release a 1 disc only and then stick it to us after Christmas with the 2 disc. DVD looks great, sounds great too. Just be careful for spoilers in the bonus features. Kinda gives some of the TV episodes away.     To all the people bashing the movie, get over yourselves. Star Wars is here to stay, and this movie is a great jumping on point for younger viewers, as well as those fans who embrace the series as a whole. Star Wars has always been for the kids. Maybe you have grown out of it.

1400032717|4.0|After having this book lying around, I finally got around to reading it.    It's a relatively short book, and it kept me going, so it only took a few days.    I have to write this review on two levels: as a piece of fiction compared to all the other fiction I have read, and as the portrayal of someone on the autism spectrum.    This was a good book. Once I got used to Christopher's way of writing and how he views the world, the book went by pretty quickly. His narrative teased out what we needed to know about his back story as it went along. I genuinely wanted to know who killed the dog. The drawings and math problems added to the quirkiness of the story, but didn't overwhelm it (hopefully Neal Stephenson reads this book). So it was a Good Read.    As for Christopher's narrative being an accurate portrayal of an autistic/Aspie: does it really matter if it was accurate? Any neurotypical person who reads this book might finally understand what made the \\"weird\\" kid everyone had in their class so weird. I think it was pretty accurate; I am mildly \\"Asperger-y\\" and could understand Christopher's frustrations.    Bottom line: this is a good book everyone should read.
B000O1799U|4.0|I finally watched \\"Dreamgirls\\" last weekend.  Mostly I wanted to see it because it had won an Oscar, or should I say Jennifer Hudson won the Oscar for Supporting Actress. What a performance!  To think she came from American Idol(and not the winner) and is such an amazing performer and actress.  The movie seemed like the perfect vehicle for her rev up her movie career.<br />\\"Dreamgirls\\" reminded me a bit of the story of The Supremes.  It is the 50's when it starts.  Three back up singers for Eddie Murphy's Jimmy \\"Thunder\\" Early, dance and sing their way up to the front of the stage.  Eventually they have their own girl group, The Dreams.  Curtis Taylor, Jr. played by Jamie Foxx, is the manager of the group.<br />Beyonce Knowles plays the main singer, Deena Jones, who gets all the attention that I felt Effie White, Jennifer Hudson's character, deserved.  I felt she got the shaft because she wasn't the imagine that they wanted for the group.  She was the most talented.  She knows it too, and eventually takes a bad turn away from the group.<br />\\"Dreamgirls\\" was a musical/play before it was a film and it transitioned well to onto the big screen.  It had some great songs and was set from the 50's to the 60's.  It's worth watching just to see Jennifer Hudson perform her Oscar winning performance.

0810995212|3.0|The Forgeries are just a bonus to the reader!  I am so disappointed with the inaccuracies found in this book!  Let's address the counterfeit issue for a moment. Lots of people are documenting specific paintings as copies, duplicates, forgeries, etc.  Judy Cutler is the self-proclaimed and acknowledged expert on J. C. Leyendecker so how could she not identify a phony painting?  Isn't she the country's biggest dealer of Leyendecker original paintings?  Maybe her real specialty is only Norman Rockwell.  After these faux pas, any claims of Leyendecker expertise should be instantly removed from her resume'.  I now understand that there are more than just the counterfeit painting identified on pages 98 & 99.  Another Leyendecker blogger, who obviously knows his way around a JCL painting or two, says the painting on page 75 is also fake.  The blogger urged readers to compare it with the one in Michael Schau's book and he is correct.  Yet another Leyendecker blog-member thinks the matador painting reeks of fraud. I don't know that painting so I reserve my comment.    It makes a person wonder why fakes would have been included.  One example could be a mistake, two counterfeit appearances would be unfortunate, but more than several inclusions indicate a trend that cannot be explained away by the authors. Also, there is no way that the picture on page 37 is Charles Beach.  Impossible.  How can they substantiate that male, although quite handsome, is Charles Beach. I have a copy of the Poster Design Magazine from the mid 1920's and there are two very clear photographs of Beach.  More research was surely needed on the part of the Cutlers. Many Leyendecker fans/groupies identify each handsome Leyendecker model as Charles Beach but they are usually mistaken.  Once a person can actually see Beach's face and absorb his characteristic features, his image is instantly identifiable!  But when an author doesn't have all of the proper facts they should not include an imposter image or asubstitute picture.  Do the Cutlers think no one will call them out on this?      It is my opinion that Judy and Laurence Cutler assembled and wrote the majority of the biographical nonsense that appears in this book.  Their comments regarding Leyendecker's sexual preferences are especially offputting and smack of biased homophobia and mis-statement of facts.      Mr. and Ms. Cutler often generalize and insert fantasy stories to entertain the readers.  I consider myself a scholar of the gay culture in America and my research has focused on the homosexual environments and lifestyles of 1910-1930.  My works have been published often and I always credit my sources of information.  Mr. and Ms. Cutler should try writing only the information that can be substantiated.  How many pages would be eliminated from this Leyendecker book if they had adopted that approach?  Subtract the fake pictures, subtract the superfluous writing by an Architect?, remove all of the sub-standard reproductions that display unbalanced color, what's left?   Not much at all.  This book retails for fifty dollars.  If you must buy it, understand what you are getting -  50% accurate content and 50% accurate pictures.

But it's my hope that everyone will also go back and read the book again - or for the first time.  It really is a classic.<br /><br />It's also the perfect way to introduce children to chapter books.  The easy language (and spattering of pictures in many editions) makes for unintimidating reading for kids just branching out into larger volumes.

B00005NWLO|5.0|When Lynyrd Skynyrd first appeared on the scene, I was working oil in Louisiana and Mississippi. At the time, I was almost strictly into jazz though most of my co-workers were almost strictly into rock and roll. Naturally, I heard Lynyrd Skynyrd, both on the radio and at social functions but I always thought they were no more than just OK until I chanced to hear One More From The Road at a party shortly after its release.<br />THAT is when I became a Lynyrd Skynyrd convert. On this album, every song came alive in a way I never heard on their studio records. I especially was entranced by their renditions of T For Texas and Call Me the Breeze and by the quality of the band's three-guitar assault on the senses.<br />Now more than thirty years later, I encountered this remastered special edition while trolling for new music and decided to see if I still liked it as much now as back then. Man, do I ever. Every song, including the overplayed Free Bird and Sweet Home Alabama is a winner. There is so much quality high-energy rock and roll on this album that it boggles the mind. There is no need to rehash what most other reviewers have said. This is truly a classic among live rock albums. There is zero filler.<br />Besides all the great music, this remastered set includes an informative booklet complete with song info, original liner notes, pictures, and an interesting overview of the band's trajectory to super-stardom. I'm not going to get into silly speculation about which Southern band best represents the soul of the region. There are many that vie for the title. But when it comes to a live show, One More From The Road proves that on the best of days, few of them have more grit and fire than did Lynyrd Skynyrd.
B000FFJYB6|3.0|I know better than to watch movies about dogs, or animals in general.  If it is a true story, or based on fact, the dog dies at the end.  I cry enough over my own dogs.  I don't need to subject myself to added pain.  I never could stand to watch \\"Lassie\\" TV shows even though they had  happy endings, just because the story line would stress me out too much.    I made the mistake of watching this movie not too long ago.  It is a wonderful story based on fact.  The first 45 minutes I would recommend to anyone for a pleasant, family movie.  The ending I would not recommend to anyone who is especially sensitive, whether they be child or adult.  I found the ending to be cruel compared to the rest of the story.    Yes, I know kids have been growing up for years and leaving childhood pets behind while they go off to school.  Do I have to be subjected to it in a movie?  I had a dog myself from age 10 to 27.  She was 17 when I lost her and the longest I ever left her was 2 months.  I think it is cruel to be tricked into the wrenching emotions of watching an aging dog be left behind by the boy who grew up.  And we are told Willie gets a transatlantic phone call to tell him Skip died.  Thanks.  What a nice ending.  Not.    This movie deserves 4-5 stars for being a well-made, quality movie.  But I give three stars for my own personal reasons.  I should have known better.  Once and for all I am sworn off all animal movies and books.
B001DTPZNY|2.0|Before beginning my home viewing of this film, I had a premonition that it would not meet my expectations.  Sorry to say that my intuition serves me well.  \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" is a film that is poorly constructed, a film that fed the mouth of hype and left a bitter taste on the palate of its viewers as well as excess calories of criticism.  I find it hard to concentrate on anything other than its flaws and I am deeply disappointed in a filmmaker whom I thought incapable of surrendering to the push of a mass-marketed film.<br /><br />This latest Indy installment gets off to a busy start with a trip to the warehouse where the infamous Arc of the Covenant ended up in the first film.  Among a small caravan of vehicles is Indiana Jones (Ford), a captive of a zealous band of Russian soldiers, his new nemesis in lieu of the Nazi regime.  The Cold War has Stalin's army looking for any possible advantage over their adversaries and it comes in the form of a strange skull made entirely of pure crystal.  Jones manages to escape from their clutches but crosses paths with them again when a rebellious high school dropout named Mutt (LaBeouf) beseeches him to help locate a missing professor (Hurt).  The rest of the movie has Jones and Mutt dodging fists, swords, poison arrows, bullets and creepy crawlies to retrieve and return this mysterious artifact.<br /><br />Production values on this particular venture are glaringly overblown; the end result is elaborate sets that look anything but ancient and fantastically awful action sequences that require strict suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />The script could've used a minor overhaul - the storyline/plot leaves much to be desired and there are one too many cheesy lines and maudlin moments.  The editing is a bit questionable as well; one particular chase sequence goes on for far too long.  In fact, most of the film falls prey to these painstakingly choreographed scenes replete with fisticuffs, swordplay, gunfire and cars/trucks crashing and/or blowing up while the meager plot creeps miserably into the background.  \\"Raiders\\", \\"Temple\\" and \\"Last Crusade\\" all had religious themes coupled with the turbulent backdrop of World War II.  \\"Crystal Skull\\" blazes ahead to the late 50's and has nothing to show for it except some lame theory about Roswell, the Mayans and alien artifacts.<br /><br />Spielberg has done better work than this - the previous Indiana Jones films are proof-positive.  This has no place with his beloved saga and instead reigns supreme as a super-charged popcorn action flick.<br /><br />On the upside, no one gives a bad performance despite the somewhat lackluster screenplay.  Ford is a bit toned down, seeming to relish his role as an older and wiser Henry Jones Jr.  John Hurt is under-utilized as is Ray Winstone.  LaBeouf is passable as Mutt, a leather-jacketed motorcycle enthusiast who flagrantly sports the James Dean guise that was so de rigeur of the time.  It's great to see Karen Allen again but her reprise as Marian Ravenwood is disappointing - she's missing much of the spark she touted in \\"Raiders\\".  As the film's villain, Blanchett probably treated this more as a pet project than serious acting work because an actress of her caliber just doesn't belong here (her Russian lilt doesn't hold strong either).  Broadbent is the most pleasing of the smaller roles, equal to that of Denholm Elliot as Marcus Brody.<br /><br />Bottom line: I give 2.5 stars for Ford, Broadbent and Allen and a story that would've been great had it not been in the hands of such mediocre screenwriters as David Koepp and (sigh) George Lucas.cks crashing and/or blowing up while the meager plot creeps miserably into the background.  \\"Raiders\\", \\"Temple\\" and \\"Last Crusade\\" all had religious themes coupled with the turbulent backdrop of World War II.  \\"Crystal Skull\\" blazes ahead to the late 50's and has nothing to show for it except some lame theory about Roswell, the Mayans and alien artifacts.

B0014DZ2VO|3.0|Unlike Casino Royale, the latest foray into the Bond franchise is more shoot-them-up than the plot-oriented, character-development fare its predecessor was. Daniel Craig is still surprisingly delicious as the MI-6 agent who goes rogue to save the world. This time around though, the opening sequence is the only state of events that holds undeniable attention and Bond's notorious sex life gets slim action. For the 007 purists, this movie holds nothing of interest; for those willing to be entertained at the movies there's a bit of charm and good, old-fashioned fun.
B001ED7C58|3.0|I agree with a previous review that its okay but not what I expected at all. Partially my fault for just blindly downloading it without really giving it a listen first. I like some of the songs quite a bit and some others are just kind of weird. I like music in most every genre so its not even that it wasn't what I'm into - its just that when I think of the story of Twilight there really is nothing on this soundtrack that sticks out as a good \\"fit\\". Now without thinking of it as a soundtrack for Twilight the music is still pretty cool on its own. I'll definitely still listen to it.  I just really hope this isn't a bad sign for movie to come...if they made poor choices for the soundtrack what will the other poor choices be?
B0002W4SWC|4.0|This European comedy/drama flick was a bit comical, but also very touching and tear jerking too, since the bloody Bridget(Renee Zellwegger) and Daniel Cleaver(Hugh Grant) started out seeming like the perfect married couple who was hot and heavy and then all of the sudden POOF! Daniel decides to dump Bridget and steals Mark Darcy's wife(Lara)while Bridget discovers that Daniel ended up being unfaithful to her all of the sudden when Bridget walks into their bathroom and finds Daniel's mistress/Mark Darcy's wife(Lara)hiding in there naked, just before Daniel drops the bomb on Bridget and tells Bridget that he and Lara were even engaged to be married on top of that.<br /><br />So then Bridget moves on by eventually dating the British handsmome Mark Darcy(Colin Firth) after getting over a tragic divorce with Daniel, but then one night Daniel decides to drop by Bridget's apartment one night while Mark and Bridgets friends are having dinner to try to get Bridget back, since Daniel's mistress/Mark's ex-wife(Lara)ended up dumping him and breaking off their engagement resulting in Mark and Daniel duking it out in the street trying to win over Bridget while Mark also avenges Daniel for stealing his former wife(Lara)by beating the crap out of Daniel in the process after a hasty altercation, which unfortunately kinda left Bridget caught between a rock & a hard place even though Daniel ended up getting what he deserved.<br /><br />The truth is, I kind of couldn't help feeling kind of sorry for Daniel at first right after the ugly clash he had with Mark, since Mark nearly beat Daniel to a pulp, which also resulted in Daniel getting a double whammy in the process on top of that, but at the same time, it was like Daniel got what he deserved, since he broke Bridgets heart, but Mark did nothing to hurt Bridget or Lara and was a much bigger and better more mature gentleman than Daniel was and seemed to be a more compatible boyfriend/lover for Bridget.<br /><br />The end was also very touching and heartfelt when Mark drops by Bridget's apartment all of the sudden on short notice on New Years and turning down a job in New York to inform Bridget that he wants to reconcile with her and then ends up reading Bridget's diary by accident while sorting through her stuff while he's trying to find something and reads a nasty little paragraph about himself(Mark Darcy) while Bridget is freshening up to look sexy for Mark to do hubba hubba, but then Mark walks out of Bridgets apartment making us and Bridget think that Mark was leaving Bridget again after reading the nasty stuff Bridget wrote about Mark, but then it turns out that Mark wasn't going to be dumping her and that Mark just wanted to surprise her with a new diary to make a fresh start together as an item again and for Bridget to make herself a new diary starting a brand new life with Mark.<br /><br />Therefore, it seemed like Bridget's bloody diary lead to nothing, but trouble, injustice, and grief, kind of like how one innocent love letter lead to 6 sticky situations in the movie \\"SECRET ADMIRER\\".<br /><br />So if you're looking for an interesting comedy drama, \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\" is a good movie to watch and consider.
B001GQ2TGA|3.0|If my friends knew I listened to and am reviewing an Enya album I would get so much abuse it is not even funny. I've been a closet Enya fan ever since I listen to her album \\"In Memory Of Trees\\" (which is still my favorite album to this day). She's intrigued me with her musical style and lyrics. I picked up all of her previous albums & tried to collect every single I could get off Amazon & Ebay. If I'm in the right mood I could listen to Enya CDs all day.<br /><br />I was excited when I heard Enya was putting out another album this year but was a bit disappointed to hear it was a Christmas album. I love Christmas & the Christmas themed music but it severely limits the time I can listen to this album. I can't see listening to songs about winter while I'm baking in these awful humid 90 degree Ohio summers... bleah.<br /><br />At first I was a little put off by some of the lyrics in the songs on this CD. It seems the lyrics are missing something and I just can't put my finger on it. When I listen to a song like \\"China Roses\\", \\"Hope Has A Place\\"  or  \\"Isobella\\" and there is a poetic feeling to the lyrics & style of the song. On this CD it feels like the songwriting was a second thought. All of the song styling & rhyming seems very plain without much heart. That being said after repeated listening I'm liking a few of the songs on here. \\"Trains & Winter Rains\\" was weird to me at first but I really like the song now. \\"Dreams Are More Precious\\" is a nice song. \\"The Spirit Of Christmas Past\\" is also pretty good.<br /><br />But now we come to my one big complaint with this album. *sigh*... The first song \\"And Winter Came..\\" a very nice piano piece. I like it.. I liked it back in 2000 when it was called \\"Midnight Blue\\"... I find it hard to believe an artist would repackage an 8 year old song with a new title (The piano piece \\"Midnight Blue\\" was on the \\"Wild Child\\" single from the \\"A Day Without Rain\\" album). Grant it, most people wouldn't know this but as a collector of Enya's music I can't just ignore it! Would it have been hard for them to sit at a piano and come up with a new 3 minute piano piece to set the mood of the album? Now I have two copies of the same song with different titles! As a fan it pains me to say this but this feels lazy. I love Enya's music but it feels like she is missing that magic spark she used to have.can't just ignore it!

And for the people who speak negative about Enya, keep your thoughts to yourself.     And Winter Came...  This is a wonderful version of Midnight Blue, I do wish she came up with a new composition. Nonetheless this is a great starter song. 5/5      Journey Of The Angels  This song I did not like that much, it didn't catch me. I feel the song itself is boring. 3/5    White Is In The Winter Night  This is very catchy and I love it. But it is repetitive!! 4/5     O Come O Come Emmanuel  Very Slow song and its Hauntingly Beautiful, but not my favorite hoilday song. 4/5     Trains and Winter Rains  Love this song so much, I love the darkness of it and the lyrics. 5/5      Dreams Are More Precious  This is a very nice song and I love the flow of it. I like the way she sings Come!! 5/5    Last Time By Moonlight  This song is great, love the chorus the most. 5/5      One Toy Soldier  This song is just pure brilliance. 5/5      Stars And Midnight Blue  Another really nice song. 5/5    The Spirit Of Christmas Past  This is awesome , she sings the best on this one, I love the amens. Enya sounds wonderful on this song. 5/5      My My Time Flies  My Favorite Song, the song is so different and the lyrics are historical, which Enya has never made. Enya you are awesome. Love the Guitar!!! 5/5      Oiche Chiuin  Just Another Version Of The Original 2/5    All in All I think this is the best album Enya has made since The Memory Of Trees!!!
B001ED7C58|2.0|Okay so like many fans of Twilight I bought this cd in hopes to get an idea of what kind of music they will be putting into the movie as well as to hear Bella's Lullabye, Robert's song, and even hoped they'd have the musical score they'd be using in the ads.  1st disappointment was no score from the ads.  2nd was the lullaby was a waste.  As soon as I heard all the other instruments, I was shocked.  \\"In the book, he doesn't play anything at that moment but a piano.\\" was my first thought.  How could they?  And last the 3rd problem was Robert's individual song.  I think I'm going to have to listen to it again and listen to it deeper to make out the lyrics cause I couldn't understand it much.  Seems under-produced.  I had such HIGH hopes for this CD.  :-(  The only interesting part about it is the other collected works from the other groups.  Never heard of them before and will definately be looking to hear more of their music in the future.
B001F290E4|4.0|While this is a departure from Seal's other cd's, the combination of songs, David Foster's production, a fabulous background orchestra, brings  anyone from my age group (50 plus) back to a time where these original  versions were either relevant or one had the good fortune to hear them sung in person.  Perhaps I am on a walk with memories, but I do feel Al Green wouldn't sneer at his song, or would Eddie Floyd nor Harold Melvin.  \\"A Long Time Coming\\", originally by Sam Cooke, should be heard, being more relevant to today's climate of change.
B000HBKCDC|5.0|This is a wonderful album, unlike any Christmas album you have heard before. I've bought one for every friend and family member. You will too.
0525478183|4.0|Following up on the success of his award-winning Young Adult novels, [[ASIN:014241221X Looking for Alaska]] and [[ASIN:0142412023 An Abundance of Katherines]], John Green next provides us with \\"Paper Towns.\\" I can most concisely describe Towns as a story about two people: high school \\"nerd,\\" Quentin Jacobsen, and the object of his infatuation - the popular Margo Roth Spiegelman, a quirky and attractive senior who Quentin has lived next door to his whole life, but does not interact with, until one day when Margo decides to finally make Quentin the object of her attention by leading him on a series of adventures throughout the town of Orlando, Florida.<br /><br />I have not read \\"Katherines\\" yet, but I have read \\"Alaska,\\" and even though it is labeled a \\"Young Adult\\" novel and I am far beyond that classification, it is still one of my favorite books (but not in a creepy \\"why is that guy in the YA section of the bookstore\\" kind of way). It is one of my favorites because Green has a very descriptive writing style and a way of creating very well developed characters that elicit an emotional reaction from his readers. If you're familiar with \\"Alaska,\\" you'll recognize this again, and that is because I almost felt like I was reading the same book.  The protagonists are incredibly similar.  I didn't necessarily feel like I was reading the same book, but I did have a very strong sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu.  Almost as if \\"Paper Towns\\" was written by a John Green in an alternate dimension.  This John Green is exactly the same as our John Green in every single way, with the exception that he has a goatee (which of course makes him evil).  That is because, in the real world, you don't often encounter girls like Alaska and Margo. In the six years I spent in high school I can't recall ever noticing a teenage girl who is strong, attractive, popular, self-reliant, emotional, adventurous, and also crazy.  Oh sure, I knew plenty of \\"crazy\\" girls.  But I'm talking about \\"let's pretend I'm pregnant to see if he really loves me\\" crazy, while Green's women are \\"I'm going to climb to the top of the Eiffel tower in the middle of the night and bungee jump while eating a triple cheeseburger\\" crazy.  Those kind of women just don't exist in the real world, and I had a lot of trouble suspending my disbelief in a character like Margo Roth Spiegelman.  She is just too out there.  If she was a \\"band geek\\" like Quentin, I might be ale to buy it, but the fact that she is apparently one of the most beautiful and popular girls in school is just too much for me.  A girl like Margo would have extreme difficulty in high school because she wouldn't fit into one of the typical molds that unfortunately, most people are stereotyped into.  Also, I have a big problem with whoever signed off on the book cover.  The girl on the cover does NOT fit my image of Margo.  She is just not attractive enough, and was a source of so much distraction I had to remove it while reading.  Why force an image of her onto the reader at all?  I think it would have been a much better idea to let the reader use their own imagination in this instance and I feel as if this was a big flaw that the editor let get by them.<br /><br />The above issues aside, I found \\"Paper Towns\\" a very enjoyable and extremely easy read.  Green's nerd power definitely comes through in his characters, and those familiar with his Brotherhood 2.0 project will feel a strong sense of familiarity between this novel and his YouTube videos. I can't compare Towns to Alaska at all, simply because I felt that the ending was a little underwhelming, and focused too much on introspection for a novel aimed at young adults.  At times Quentin and Margo talk way too much like 50-year old erudites than high school kids, and the book and plot is a little too \\"lofty\\" to believe in, but maybe that is part of the appeal Green's books have with older readers and why I don't think they should be limited to the young adult section of bookstores.<br /><br />If I had to rank this book among Green's other works, I would put it above An Abundance of Katherines, but below Looking for Alaska and [[ASIN:0525478817 The Fault in Our Stars]].ook among Green's other works, I would put it above An Abundance of Katherines, but below Looking for Alaska and [[ASIN:0525478817 The Fault in Our Stars]].
0575081406|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss is a masterful spinner of fantasy stories.  Rothfuss, who was an undeclared collegian for the first 3 years of college, is an up and coming master of the swords and magic book genre.  I think that the character Kvothe is written very really.  I like how there is a supernatural element in the story of the Chandrians and as the character Bast who is one of the Chandrian.  I also like how magic is described with tie-ins to modern science like saying that steel has more carbon in it than iron, but then Kvothe would agree with the blacksmith's apprentice saying that it had more lime in it to appear less educated and blend in more.  I also liked the vivid description of the Arcanium and how there was a master of different arts like naming and sympathy bonds and Fishery where people fabricated items.  The addition of sympathy bonds to the fantasy world will be great.  I appreciated how in books like this one and the ones in the Eragon Cycle, the person's ability is derived from their own strength.  This doesn't leave too many what if scenarios.  In the Harry Potter series, magic is formed by thought, so what if some had muttered a word that would of just destroyed the world in a second?  Another thumbs up, to how Patrick Rothfuss pays homage to basic fantasy, dragons or Draccus as the Chronicler would of said, who is like the scribe like character of the story.  My personal favorite part of the book is when the villagers are recalling the legendary adventures of Kvothe with his many names, and he is sitting among them unknown to them.  The most memorable part of the story is how the Chronicler met Kvothe, while getting attacked by the Scrael at the same time. The funniest part of the book is when a young Kvothe sees Abernathy's cart with the word Alements on a sign, not Aliments because Abernathy brews alcohol, which is a joke.  Name of the Wind doesn't have these plot holes except from the part where he is a street urchin and the question is asked, why doesn't he help lift himself out of poverty with his magical abilities, the ones that he learned on the road from Abernathy?esn't he help lift himself out of poverty with his magical abilities, the ones that he learned on the road from Abernathy?
B0017I1FP8|5.0|This is hands down, the best soundtrack since the lord of the rings. Hans Zimmer and James Howard deliver the perfect score to one of the greatest action movies of all time. The soundtrack brings back images from the movie, everytime I listen to it. Great sequel to the batman begins score but this is a notch even better. Go grab this one to feel inspired!

1595141979|5.0|I absolutely love this book series. I went out yesterday, and the local B&N didn't have it in stock! I was so upset, so I went to the closest Borders, and they had ONE COPY. I bought it at 12:30, and by 4:30, I was closing the book. This so far is my favorite, because Rose starts questioning her role as a Dhampir guardian, and there's more of Andre, who is one of my favorite characters. I have an immense dislike for the queen, but the character for Christian is becoming more defined. I wish more had happened with regard to Mana and the tard kids who caused so much trouble, but I suppose that will be in the next book! I can't wait! I was also happy that this book was a bit larger than the others ;) As a fast reader, it's always a happy sight to see the book you want is bigger than expected!
B0014DZ2VO|4.0|You can tell by my title that I feel that the 007 in Quantum of Solace is more like Jason Bourne than ever before. We are missing the classic lines, memorable villians, funny Bond girl names, cool gadgets, the main theme music (until the end credits) and a James Bond with charm. I like Daniel Craig and I thought Casino Royale balanced the fun with the seriousness, but here it is all about revenge. I'm not saying that they should go back to the cheese of some of the Roger Moore era films, but they shouldn't turn the character of Bond into a mindless killing machine.<br /><br />Judi Dench gets more screen time than ever before as M, and does well with what she has to work with. The main Bond girl, played by Olga Kurylenko is easy on the eyes for sure, but the character holds little interest.<br /><br />With all that said, I actually thought Quantum of Solace was better than the average entry in the series. Being the shortest of all 22 movies, it moves at a brisk pace and has a couple of good action sequences. I'm still not sure I understand the whole plot, so I guess a DVD rental will be in my future. The story picks up minutes after the end of Casino Royale (this is the first Bond film to do this) and it does close everything out nicely. I was tempted to give it 3 stars, but my love for the franchise forced me to boost it up a notch.<br /><br />Now that the whole Vesper revenge thing is over with,  maybe this legendary character can win us over with his charm and not just his fist in the next installment.
1416595546|5.0|This is a chilling and heartrending story of a woman who was a dedicated Bolshevik in 1917 and an even more dedicated Stalinist in 1939.  But for even the most loyal party-liners the cellars and the labor camps were always a hairsbreadth away:  \\"the seven grams\\" referred to the executioner's bullet in the cellars of the Lubyanka or the other prisons where most of the ranking party faithful met their ends.      The novel has three sections--the first is St. Petersburg in 1916 at the eve of the Revolution.  Sashenka is a schoolgirl from a well-to-do family who is brought into the Bolshevik ranks by her uncle Mendel.  This is the slowest and in ways least interesting part of the book.  You see the Tsarist secret police apparatus, the informers, and you get to meet some of the men who would later become famous or infamous--Molotov, Lenin, Stalin, and others.  The second part is set in Moscow in 1939.  Sashenka is married to an NKVD official, has two young children, and epitomizes blind loyalty to Stalin.  She dismisses those who are executed or sent to the labor camps as Trotskyites and traitors.  But paranoid suspicion is part of the Stalinist state, and a love affair triggers terrible consequences.  This part of the novel is the best section--you get a good feeling for the paranoia, the Terror (an aptly named period in the Stalin era), and the leaders Stalin and Beria.  This is a time where an unwise jest, misspelling Stalin's name in print, etc, can result in your being given the seven grams.  The third section of the book takes place in 1994 after the fall of Communism.  A young graduate student in history is hired by an Englishwoman who was born in the USSR to find out information about her parents, to search through archives.  So you find out what happened to Sashenka.    During the Terror (and after, as it continued long after the Terror was \\"over\\"), there was the fear of car doors slamming open at 3am and a loud banging on your apartment door shortly afterward.The smarter ones would have a small suitcase ready, just in case, and might be allowed to put on extra layers of clothing before they were led away:  Kolyma and the camps above the Arctic Circle made such actions necessary.  What is perhaps most interesting, which you'll see here and in Robert Conquest's superb history The Great Terror, is that the most dedicated party-liners understood that the party needed them to confess to being spies and traitors, to plotting to kill Stalin by sprinkling arsenic on gramophone records, and other absurdities:  they confessed as a last service to the party.  You need to remember that being a spouse or child of a traitor was also a serious crime worthy of death or 10 years in the labor camps: this plays a part in the novel.  You get a view here of life under Stalin that you won't forget--this is a very moving and impressive novel.

0553124986|4.0|I started out reading this out loud to my five year old. That ended about a third of the way through as some adult situations. I remember reading this as a kid, albeit a little older than my girl is now, probably 8 or 9. I remembered this book with fondness, but almost all the details of the book escaped.<br /><br />This story is about a retarded adult named Charlie and a mouse named Algernon. Algernon and Charlie are involved with a scientific experiment to increase their intelligence. We see Charlie progress from a lovable nitwit, to a self absorbed super-genius. As he gets more intelligent, he comes to realize the way people viewed him before he gained his intelligence.<br /><br />I really liked how Keyes put this together. The best part was how Keyes exposes the issue of person-hood. By the super-intelligent Charlie being treated like an object rather than a person, the author also exposes that developmentally disabled persons are often treated like objects. This theme is later revisited when Charlie goes and visits his family, and finds his mother in the grips of senility.
1438242816|5.0|As much as this book revolves around three of the four daughters of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, all of those characters revolve around Mr. Darcy - whose personality and character matures and unfolds before you.<br /><br />Neither poor nor rich, the Bennets cannot establish great wealth and comforts for their children - and Mrs. Bennet's hard opinionated character further deprives the lovely lasses of possibilities for advancement.  But, through the character weakness(es) will come happiness in all levels - where some smile and others are more joyous and laugh.  And, thee events happen quickly, all within one year's time.<br /><br />Darcy, who adores his 10-years-younger sister Georgiana, is the proper gentleman who has never raised his voice during his 28 years.  Elizabeth, her father's favorite and mother's least, befriends Mr. Darcy and soon aggravates his senses and challenges him to make it to 29 without harsh verbal exchange or raised voice.<br /><br />After some embarrassingly wrong misconceptions of his character, and equally wrong characterizations about a person whose life has plagued Darcy's, Elizabeth watches the young man blossom as he singlehandedly controls her family's pitfalls, confronts those who attempt to deliver her family to near disasters and financially saves the family from other possible misfortunes.  In such actions, Darcy has to befriend an enemy, deliver embezzled money, negotiate with creditors of his enemy, and more.  And, all for love - and who ever said love would be easy?<br /><br />Pride is swallowed not only by Darcy, but by so many others in this novel. \\"Pride. . . is a very common failing. . . Human nature is quite proud of some quality or other, real or imaginary.\\"  We learn, \\"Vanity and pride are different things.\\"  \\"Pride rises from a good opinion of ourselves; vanity from what we would have others think of us.\\"<br /><br />We are wrongly  told \\". . . almost all his [Darcy's] actions may be traced to pride, and pride has often been his best friend.\\" In the end, we learn Darcy \\". . . has no improper pride.\\"<br /><br />Interestingly, prejudice is not a word defined, used or explained like its title counterpart.  But, prejudice is a concept belying each page, each acquaintance, each personal affront, and somehow is easily overcome by youthful passion.  Prejudice helplessly loses amidst the betrothing of the three daughters full of young passion.<br /><br />In the end, a Cinderella-like conclusion befits the young hearts' defiance to prejudice through passion. And, in the persuasive methods of young Elizabeth, the originally perceived overbearing pride of Darcy evolves into what she describes to be proper pride.<br /><br />If there is one thing this reader enjoys in this Austen book it is the dialogue.  Whether it be the hindered ire of Darcy in civilly responding to Elizabeth's overzealous impertinence, or Elizabeth's steadfast refusal to succumb to Lady Catherine's requests that she never wed her nobleman nephew, the  calm and polite retorts are deliciously phrased and eloquently  presented. Few plays can match such work.s best friend.\\" In the end, we learn Darcy \\". . . has no improper pride.\\"<br /><br />Interestingly, prejudice is not a word defined, used or explained like its title counterpart.

B0013HA838|5.0|This production is absolutely delightful one of the best ones ever staged, IMHO. (Folks, note that the 1 star review is based on an Amazon description mix up and has no relevance to the actual performance!). I saw it shown on the HDTV and had to own it of course. This is a splurge to be enjoyed time and again - supreb singing and engaging acting bring this beloved opera to a new level. No wonder La Netrebko found Schrott so irresistable. :)

Crime, suspense and justice.  A Time to Kill delivers.  The uncomfortable subject of race in the south is at the center of this story and Grisham doesn't shy away from it.  His characters have to explore tough questions and pass judgment on themselves and others.

B000002N3N|5.0|This CD by Enya, the first one I ever discovered years ago, is still my personal favorite, with the title song being my personal favorite song of Enya's. But just that does not do her justice. She is many times classified as New Age/New Age Celtic, but that title does not do her justice to the music which she produces. She is able to sing not only in English, but in Gaelic, Latin, Welsh, Spanish, French, and even a made up Elvish (LotR). She has the amazing ability to be so universally adored even winning the 1997 Grammy for Best New Age Album; and one can clearly see why she was graced with this honor. Between Enya herself and the two Ryan's, there could be no better album made, although one can say this about each and every CD of Enya's (which I do own, with her new CD \\"And Winter Came\\" soon to be added to the collection!)
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I was nervous for Taylor, she had an amazing debut CD.  I was worried that this CD wouldn't live up to the last one but now I have let go of that fear.  This CD is just as good as the first one, it captivates me from the first song!<br />The songs are really good, the lyrics are awesome and like always her voice is great.  Just like her other CD I can't pick any favorite, but I do really like Change, Love Story, Hey Stephen, and Tell Me Why.  This CD has alot of faster tempo songs, and then alot of slower ones.  It's a good mix, so you don't get bored.  Some of them seem the same the first few times you listen to them, but then you listen to them the 3rd time and you start to tell they all are really different, lyrics, sound and everything.<br />Another great thing is how true the lyrics are, and Taylor is truly FEARLESS!<br />SO GO TAYLOR ON ANOTHER AWESOME CD!
B0014DZ2VO|5.0|Bond (Daniel Craig) is back and bent on vengeance.  He is seeking to find the one who killed his beloved Vesper (Eva Green from `Casino Royale').  His path of revenge leads him to some familiar faces, a new femme fatale named Camille (Olga Kurylenko) and above all, a new villain, Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), an environmentalist with a not so environmentally friendly hidden agenda.    If you thought 2006's \\"Casino Royale\\" gave us a tougher Bond that packed one hell of a punch, \\"Quantum of Solace\\" will deliver a haymaker that will knock you out of your seat.  Within the first five minutes of the film you know that the action will be virtually non stop.  Almost any conceivable vehicle was used to film a chase scene.  Car, boat, plane, segway...well maybe not segway, but you get the point.  \\"Quantum of Solace\\" aims to entertain with adrenaline fueled action scenes, which it succeeds in doing.      It seems as though the new generation of Bond is all about toughness, and shoot first and gather information later.  The high tech gadgetry of previous Bond films is ancient history.  So is the \\"Bond, James Bond\\" line that fans of 007 have come to expect in every film.  However, it is a refreshing change to get away from the gadgets.  It makes it seem more realistic, although some of the action scenes weren't.  The formula for a classic Bond film has been given new ingredients and has been shaken and stirred to give us the newer action packed 007 we get today.     \\"Quantum of Solace\\" is a sequel (the first film in the franchise to be titled so) and it will be a successful one.  Action fans will thoroughly enjoy this one.  Bond fans may nitpick at the missing ingredients, but nonetheless should see it because if you're a diehard fan then it's a must to see the latest installment of 007.
B001ED7C58|3.0|When I saw that the soundtrack had come out, I thought \\"mmm...why not!\\"  BUT I was wary. As I put the disc in the car, I expected the tracks to be   very girlie...  I was pleasantly surprised! A little giddy actually.  Muse, The Black Ghosts, Mutemath, Blue Foundation and Iron & Wine are all good songs. And not something that you are going to hear on the radio in my area.  Unlike some vampire movie soundtracks, this one does not use TOO much   techno or death metal.  Thank goodness no one felt the need to do so.  It's a good mix of songs.    Some girlie, some rock (as in watch me walk in slow motion, rock)  and I dare say a little moody.    Even if you are not a fan, you need to pick up this CD.  The bands on it are worth it. You will, hopefully, be pleasantly surprised and maybe even a little giddy.
1591396190|5.0|I have been paying attention to the work of Kim and Mauborgne, since they published their first articles in the Harvard Business Review.  The thinking they have developed since those days, i.e. building a strategy canvas, accessing non-users of your company's products, and then devising a process to create a blue ocean strategy  expand one's ability to apply their ideas.      Building a strategy canvas, however, is a lot harder than it looks. I've tried, with varying levels of success.  Discovering the elements of your differentiation is more than half the battle.  It's not so difficult to look at an already innovative product or service and abstract back to the strategy canvas.  But, starting from scratch and developing your own, means paying attention to the blocking and tackling of Blue Ocean Strategies: Reconstructing Market Boundaries, fund in Chapter 3.  In it, the authors identify the six paths to Blue Ocean Strategies.  They are to look across Industry, Strategic Group, Buyer Group, Scope of Product, Functional/Emotional Orientation and Time.  But one they left one out, which was in their original thinking.  It is simply to look across Borders.  Ask how do they do it in Spain or China?  Just understanding how the healthcare system works in France, for example, can provide huge insights into anyone who sells products or services to in that industry anywhere in the world.  I also find 'Crossing Borders' to be the easiest way to find the assumptions you have about your business model.  This is the key starting point in how to create Blue Oceans.    (see    [.....]  for more information).     Understanding the 'how's' of Blue Ocean Strategy, like most things, let's you apply it rather than just to understand what the authors mean.
0061122416|3.0|'The Alchemist' is essentially a fable that crystallises an age-old theme - that of stepping beyond one's comfort zone in the pursuit of one's dreams. The moral of the story is illustrated by Coelho with an unwavering single-mindedness. This is clear right from the onset when our protagonist, the shepherd boy Santiago, receives the 'calling' to pursue his dream, till when he finally attains it after many a trial and tribulation. Along the way, he is aided by the Alchemist, who is really a personification of the boy's conscience and an expression of the ideals he works towards. Neither the story nor the message is new. Nonetheless, what the book offers is a clear and uncluttered narrative, written in an accessible style, that serves to accentuate the author's key message.     The fable-like style of Coelho's storytelling, however, makes for a rather colourless read. The plot and the characters are forgettable. Even the stark settings conjured by the author - the chaos and commotion of the bustling port-side towns and the loneliness of the vast North African desert - become increasing pointless when set against the thin narrative and unremarkable cast of characters. Furthermore, the brand of spirituality proffered by the author, in all his ecumenical eagerness, ends up confusing the key message by failing to offer any concrete religious philosophy from any of the spiritual traditions that he draws upon.      This book is a clear and `feel-good' reminder about pursuing one's dreams, but otherwise an unremarkable piece of fiction.
0439023483|5.0|The book The Hunger Games was by far the greatest book i have ever read! I started out only looking for a book to read for a fantasy book report and well not being much of a reader didn't mind much what I read. After reading th first 14 pages the first night, I was amazed at how the book kept me going! This book shows how Katniss, a girl from district twelve, which is the coaling district is sent to the Hunger Games in the city called the Capital. There were once 13 districts seprated by forests with beasts and monsters in them. But after the attempted rebellion failed. District 13 was obliterated and the Hunger Games were a way to show the districts that they had complete power. Katniss's fater was a coal miner who tought her to use a bow and arrow for hunting which helped tremedisly in the arena. Her father died in a mine explotion and then Katniss is forced to take care of the family by hunting illigally outside of the fence and one day she meets gale when she saw a rabit in a snare who was a great big help to Katniss. But befor the hunting started Katniss was starving a boy from school named Peete through her some bread and se soon finds out that they will both be going to the Hunger Games knowing that only one can servive in this book of suspence, fights and sadness. This book is highly recomended!

1416562605|4.0|Aravind Adiga creates a character in Balram Halwai who rivals Chichikov in Dead Souls by Gogol.  Like the Russian classic, this is a book that sets out to expose current events through social criticism.  Like Dead Souls, it relies upon humor and absurdity.<br /><br />There is a sense of futility in the characters here.  The author paints a picture of a country where honesty and integrity are foolish, where popular democracy flourishes but no one has representation, and where many people labor without true opportunity.<br /><br />The formal structure of the book is as a letter to a fiction Chinese leader who is interested in entrepreneurship. Balram is reviewing his own ascent in life.  He believes that he has attained a kind of entrepreneurialism that is uniquely Indian.  The reader realizes that his version is largely based upon corruption and malfeasance, and through that lens, I suppose we are to assume that the model Indian economy is actually not as wonderful as it might appear from a distance.<br /><br />At the start, Balram is a bright young boy from rural India whose nickname, \\"White Tiger\\" is given to him because he appears to be so different from his surroundings in \\"The Darkness.\\"  His break comes when he gets a job as a driver for one of the local tycoons.  He moves to Delhi and learns to drive.  He competes for position among the servants. Balram is content to drive the Honda City Motor Car for a while, but an auspicious event changes his patience for a life as a servant.  I will stop there, except to say that he takes things into his own hands.<br /><br />This is a book that gives some interesting context to a quickly changing society.  So much of the literature that comes out of India deals with either expatriates or the upper classes.  I guess that Rohinton Mistry is an exception.  This book shows how family, caste, and globalization are clashing in the new India.<br /><br />I liked this book.  I have heard people compare it to work by Gary Shteyngart or Augusten Burrounghs.  I think that is misplaced.  While those authors have their value, this is more rooted in reality.  Even if the approach is somewhat fantastic, there is an underlying message that is very serious.that is misplaced.  While those authors have their value, this is more rooted in reality.

0061537934|5.0|OK, I NEVER write reviews. However, I (like another reviewer) picked up the book just because of the yellow lab (I have one) photo on the cover. Forget that the book isn't about a lab - the cover will hook you, and the story will finish you! The end is foreshadowed on page one, and I was already weepy - you know the dog is talking about his end. In between the first and last pages, however, is quite an adventure. If you've ever wondered what your dog might observe in between unconditional wagging of tails and covering your black clothes with yellow hair (or white clothes with black or brown, for that matter), this novel has great suggestions.  Quick read, but worth it. HINT FOR MOMS (or maybe dads too): don't wait to read the final chapter while waiting for one of your kids to finish up a sports practice where you are in public. I had to pretend I had a bad cold, needing to blow my nose a lot . . . . But still a positive, good cry!
B000JSI7C6|1.0|I like Cage & Slater, and I'm ok with war movies, but this was such a let down.  First of all, it ISN'T even about the Navaho Windtalkers, it's about Cage's character and his flashbacks to the brutality he experienced in combat, and these combat scenes went on for so long that I forgot what I was watching. The story-line for the Native American windtalkers was barely noticed because there was no real plot for either Navaho character.  The script for these characters was probably two pages.  The only big deal was in Hollywood because of the director.  I gave the movie one star, and that is for the \\"feeble attempt\\" to show the heroic involvement of our Native Americans in WWII - but what a huge disappointment.

B001B71NOI|3.0|Everyone should be aware that The Slip gets better and better with each and every listen but I can't help but feel that my admiration for NIN is fading as quickly as they're churning out albums. I like this album but I don't know how people can rate it four and five stars. Think of it in these terms, whoever gave this 5 stars is saying that it is on par with NIN's \\"best stuff\\" which is a blatant fabrication or just the same whoever gave this 4 stars was stretching the truth by saying it is only one freakin' star beneath genius albums like THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL or THE FRAGILE! There wasn't much of this album that was impressive or memorable, and that's easy to prove, it's right here in front of you -read the reviews, you'll notice that there isn't hardly anyone that mention anything SPECIFIC that they liked about it... and they're right there isn't much to say! I will however admit that the song Demon Seed immediately and constantly catches my attention and I would highly recommend the option of downloading it for free on [...]. But in all honesty, to me, Reznor's reputation is getting 'closer' and 'closer' to ruin because it can't be good when a friend tells you, \\"hey nine inch nails has another new album out!\\" and then you almost reply, \\"yeah, but who gives a[...]\\". I'll give Trent credit though, he's a brilliant musician and producer, however he's almost cursed from having been capable of such incredible works so early in his career that he may never live up to them again. But so far, in my opinion, he's doing an outstanding job of giving it his best efforts.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Geez, that's one hell of a director's cut!!      Seriously, I absolutely love this film.  Watching the film actually intrigued me enough so I ended up purchasing the series.  I know I watched it backwards, but I still loved it all together.     I've been patient in waiting for this on Blu Ray and that day has finally arrived.  I cannot wait until I get this!!!
B001ED7C58|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this soundtrack.  Normally soundtracks do not have a \\"central\\" type of music on them, and most of the time, most of the tracks are not that great.  Not so with this soundtrack.  I didn't know most of the bands on here (I guess I am out of the alternative music loop), but I happen to like Lincoln Park, and had a strong desire to hear Robert Pattinson's song so I purchased the CD.  It was so worth it.  The music is interesting, and catching.  I find myself singing along, and moving to songs I never even thought I would like.  The only downturn for me was Bella's Lullabye.  There was so much going on in the song that I had a hard time trying to figure out a melody, or the point of the song.  Let alone, it didn't sound like a lullabye at all...I honestly don't think it would help me to fall asleep.  Good buy, worth the money.
0525478183|4.0|Though a poor stepsister to his Printz Award-winning LOOKING FOR ALASKA, John Green's PAPER TOWNS follows a similar formula and will no doubt captivate both established fans and many new ones.  Again we have a femme-almost-fatale, this time by the name of Margo Roth Spiegelman.  As the book's irresistible hook, Green writes a long scene where Margo and her starry-eyed wing man, Quentin Jacobsen, wreak havoc on Spielgelman's high school senior enemies in suburban Orlando.  Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, and all that.<br /><br />Also Alaska-like, Margo no sooner makes her mark when she up and disappears.  The difference, however, is that readers don't get to know Margo as well or as deeply as they do Alaska in Green's debut novel.  From here, we are left to follow the clues with Q, a boy on a mission to track his love (or \\"crush\\" might better describe it).  Among his most important clues is Walt Whitman's poem, \\"Leaves of Grass\\" (English majors take note).<br /><br />Although this search is protracted and perhaps not all that intriguing, the novel is in good hands.  Why?  With Margo out of sight, Green treats us to a \\"buddy bonding\\" book of sorts.  Q's best friend, Ben Starling, and his other best friend, Radar, take what looks like a plot novel in the offing and turn it into a characterization novel that's not only funny but spot-on to the way guys talk (to each other, to girls, and to their computers).  By the time the Margo plot resurfaces, the sub-plot revolving around the guys has practically trumped it.  Overall, this is an enjoyable outing -- part light mystery, part road book, part novel of (ill) manners.  It all adds up to a worthwhile read.
0375826726|5.0|I am a huge fan of Christopher Paolini's writing and I had been waiting for his third installment for quite some time.  Other people have been reviewing the book, but I don't think that's what Amazon.com is for.  Amazon.com was extremely quick with the shipment and the books were in perfect condition.  I was able to surprise my boyfriend with it the day after I ordered it!  Amazon is extremely efficient and I always go to their site to find anything and everything.  Thanks again, Amazon!

B0014G5LG2|5.0|OK, other reviewers have gone on and on about the Vienna factor. What I think is remarkable, is how UNLIKE this sounds like the day-to-day VPO in Mahler. Their response is far sharper; more rhythmic; more fleet than usual - particularly in the middle three movements. Compare this to the marmoreal sounding Maazel performances - not to mention the Abbado/VPO M9/M10 Adagio - and you'll hear a world of difference! Another big difference is in the sound quality.    Most recordings made in Vienna's shoe-box shaped Musikverein, have come from live sources. This must be a studio recording. This is the first recording of a major work played by the VPO that can begin to approach the sonic results that they regularly used to get, \\"back in the day\\", at the old Sofiensaal (eventually burnt down). Sonically speaking, this is far better than what you hear on either the Kaplan or Boulez Mahler \\"Resurrection\\" recordings, for example. Point is, the sound is excellent.     Here's another \\"Vienna factor\\": the 10th - especially in the Cooke edition - has always sounded a bit too thin, or too \\"nude\\" in the bass. The Musikverein, on the other hand, has always been generous to the lower end of the audio spectrum, and the Viennese double basses and celli are among the best anywhere. As a result, and as mentioned previously, the Vienna Phil. make the Cooke version (Goldschmidt, really) sound more filled out; more natural; more complete.     All this said, there are performances I like better for tempo relationships. The two outer movements aren't nearly so slack sounding on the recent Noseda/BBC Phil. M10 (Chandos), while their \\"Purgatorio\\" (middle movement) doesn't sound quite so rushed either. Still, the Viennese strings can sustain excess slack in the outer movements better than most. Personally, I prefer that the first movement go much quicker when doing the entire 10th (as opposed to playing the Adagio by itself). Harding stretches the first movement well beyond 25 minutes, while Ormandy is 15 seconds shy of 22 minutes. But it's hard to argue with the results the Vienna strings get in the last movement, even if I prefer a less gossamer approach to Mahler's final reach back towards young, idealistic love (let's call it a \\"reach\\", and not just a glance).     Kudos on three other important points as well:    First, like Rattle, Harding links the last movements with just a single drum stroke, not two.    Second, also like Rattle, Harding takes everything from the second scherzo's (4th movement) final expressionistic outburst, to the beginning of the fifth movement, quite slowly. This lends a very Shostakovich like atmosphere to the final two minutes of the fourth movement.     Third, and not least, Harding doesn't blow you out of the room with his solo bass drum shots; the \\"muted\\" drum sensibly played on a bass drum (pleeeeaze, no more tenor drums, tom-toms, bongos, etc.). Combined with an excellent solo tuba, as well as sound quality that can pick up all the soft tam-tam strokes, you'd be very hard pressed to find a more effective or atmospheric sounding start to the finale. That alone counts for plenty.

I loved 'New Moon' also and 'Eclipse' even more. I could not wait to get my hands on this book but I have to admit I was kinda let down... I think the twists and turns were just a little too much.  They changed who Bella was. All her endearing qualitys were taken away. Another thing was the big, hyped confrontation is a letdown. Is it as good as all the rest in the series? No. But is it a good book? Yes. They can't all be as good as 'Twilight' right?

1416594884|4.0|John le Carr&eacute; beats many authors of espionage novels for a number of reasons. He's a true first-person Cold War Era authority as he was working for the British Foreign Service in the early '60s, even before the Berlin Wall went up, then eventually for MI6 (the UK's external intelligence agency). Born as David John Moore Cornwell, he wrote his first novel, [[ASIN:0743431677 Call for the Dead]] in 1961 while still a member of his government's service, thus requiring his use of the pen name we know as John le Carr&eacute;. It was in that first novel that he introduced George Smiley, his most famous recurring characters, and its sequel, [[ASIN:0802714544 The Spy Who Came in From the Cold]] is one of the most celebrated novels in the espionage genre.<br /><br />But the Cold War as we knew it is over, and the Wall that separated Germany has mostly been sold to souvenir seekers. George Smiley, who would have been over 100 by now, was retired a number of books back, gone but not forgotten. Le Carr&eacute;'s latest book, [[ASIN:1416594884 A Most Wanted Man]], introduces us to Issa Karpov, a half-Russian, half-Chechen Muslim refugee in a long black overcoat who has turned up in Hamburg to reclaim a mysterious inheritance and devote himself to Islam. He is also being pursued by competing security services that fear that he just might be there to unleash some fundamentalist havoc upon the country. We meet Annabel, an idealistic young German civil rights lawyer who is determined to save Issa from deportation, and soon Issa's survival becomes more important to her than her own safety.<br /><br />Making this into a seemingly improbable trio is one Tommy Brue, a sixty-year-old private banker with a failing British bank based in Hamburg who has a number of secrets, business and personal, that he'd rather not remember. Add to this mix the rival spies of Germany, the US and the UK, all set to converge upon the unlikely trio, as they've identified Issa as the perfect live bait for an altogether bigger fish.<br /><br />This is a tale about corruption, both political and private. The plot revolves around the most highly-debated debated policies in a contemporary terror-freighted Europe, and Le Carr&eacute; creates credible, lifelike characters whose conflict with the agents of the powers that be add to the dark realism of the novel. Keep in mind that it's set in Hamburg, the former home of the 9/11 hijackers, which in some ways explains the concerns of the German security services at the arrival of Issa, whose name indecently, is said to mean Jesus. The symbolism has a somewhat subtle point.<br /><br />But since the end of the Cold War, the US seems to have replaced the USSR as the antagonist of choice in Le Carr&eacute;'s writings. He has never disguised his sometimes contemptuous attitude for much that is American, but it seems to have increased over the last decade.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0316159395 Absolute Friends]] was disappointing to this reader because it seemed that Le Carr&eacute; couldn't choose between writing a solid book or an anti-American lecture, and it didn't function effectively as either. It reflected the author's anger against justification by both the US and the UK for their current involvement in Iraq as the front line in the war against Muslim terrorism.<br /><br />This attitude hasn't stopped me from buying and reading everything he has written, but I do wish that he would treat the Americans and his own British countrymen with the appreciation and compassion that he shows to Muslim fundamentalists. There is, however, something to be said for such a usually unemotional and dispassionate writer as Le Carr&eacute; letting his passion to get the better of him once in awhile, as he has done in his latest offering. Few writers of spy thrillers deal with contemporary political events with such keen perception as does John Le Carr&eacute;.<br /><br />If you're looking for a recent release with white-knuckle car chases, wild exchanges of bullets and sultry women, then Le Carr&eacute;'s stories are not for you. Most of Le Carr&eacute;'s books are all about character development and plot, and [[ASIN:1416594884 A Most Wanted Man]] reflects the slow, meticulous process of putting together the intricate espionage enigma.<br /><br />This is not his best work, in this reader's opinion. George Smiley would be over 100 by now, the Berlin Wall is gone and the Cold War is past us, as noted before. That being said, John Le Carr&eacute; is still in a league of his own.é's stories are not for you.

B001ED7C58|2.0|I was way disappointed with the album. There needed to be less techo and more rock. Isn't that what Stephenie Meyer listened to when writing the book? The Muse song she chose was better as was the Linkin park. Where is \\"In my place\\" or \\"Creep\\" Both better than the songs on here. I love Collective soul. Pattinsons song was very hard to understand.....he mumbles too much to understand the song. And lastly? Bella's Lullabye is more like Bella's Symphony and I didn't like that. We all know Edward can afford a 100 piece orchestra but he only used his home piano to create a song for Bella. Overall this album was a huge disappointment and I am hoping the movie isnt as bad as the Soundtrack

B0006PV5VC|4.0|Hear a new revelation in sound with this SACD.<br /><br />RCA originally recorded this in 1960 using 3 channels. That makes this recording nearly 50 years old. Don't let that fool you.  This is an EXCEPTIONAL recording.  The fidelity is remarkable.  It is not flawless and the highs can have a bit of an edge.  Also, crashes on the cymbal occasionally overload the left channel. But the spatial aspects of this recording defy its half century age.  In the 3 channel presentation there is a presence and dimensionality too often missing in more recent recordings.  There exists a soundstage that extends beyond the left and right speakers and there is a depth of sound where the instruments have height combined with front to back spatial integration creating a convincing 3D image.<br /><br />The performance itself is stellar.  I have the SACD of the Kirov Orchestra recorded in 2002.  The great Russian (actually Ossetian) conductor Valery Gergiev gives an invigorating reading of this score, but for me the orchestra lacks the finish of the CSO under Reiner. Reiner's performance has a mystery, that Gergiev lacks.  And Reiner has fire and passion that explodes across the stage.  For me, Reiner gives the definitive reading of this magnificent score.<br /><br />The following FOR SACD AUDIOPHILES ONLY--<br />BUT--if you really want to launch your rocket, try putting your SACD player in 2 CHANNEL mode and switching your receiver into Dolby PLIIx music mode.  With this setup (this ONLY works if your player AND receiver are connected via HDMI cable) you will get the full SACD dynamic range expertly and convincingly distributed into your 5.1, 6.1, or 7.1 surround system.  Suddenly you are not just listening from the audience, but you are quite literally in the middle of the orchestra.  Now if you are a purist you will never go there, but if you want a really involving experience (and you have the system to pull it off) give this a spin.  WARNING:  If you try listening this way, going back will somehow sound a little FLAT.  And MORE, you might even dare try this with regular CDs or other 2/3 channel SACDs.

B00005JPKE|5.0|Letters from Iwo Jima is an exceptional film. It covers a 40 day period prior to the invasion of US troops on Iwa Jima and the events that occur immediately after. Filmed in sepia tones that are highlighted for fiery explosions, the limited color range made the action more terrible and the drama more heightened.    Two officers lead the Japanese men on Iwo Jima, General Kuribayashi and Baron Nishi. The General is played to perfection by Ken Watanabe and the Baron is played with great zeal by Tshuyoshi Ihara. These two men are very worldly and sophisticated, both having lived in the USA. Whereas they are totally loyal to the Emperor and the cult of militarism that dominated Japan during World War II, they also are keenly aware that the Americans are not cowards and fools and that the fight for Iwa Jima will be a living hell. General Kuribayashi takes over command from Admiral Ohsugi, a conservative by-the-book mediocre military man. When General Kuribayashi's assessments are contrary to Admiral Ohsugi's we begin to see professional jealousies arise, ending with the Admiral leaving the island. General Kuribayashi found a situation where he was originally thought he had bombers and ships only to find he really had none. The island had very little fresh water, an insignificant amount in regard to the needs of a military campaign.    The middle ranking officers were certainly interesting in the film. Many of them regarded General Kuribayashi and Baron Nishi as American sympathizers and in some cases disobeyed orders.  However these same fellows were also inclined to shot or behead the front line soldiers under their command when they thought that their orders were ignored or undermined or when they suspected retreat. There were repeated examples of how devotion to military authoritarianism combined with draconian rule enforcement is a dangerous combination for small minds.     The front line soldiers were certainly sympathetic and were the heart of the movie. Kazunari Ninomiya played the baker Saigo perfectly.  He is the everyman figure, the lone survivor, the common man that survives despite all the odds against him. The film follows his 40 days as he sees a close friend die of bloody dysentery, as he runs from pillar to post avoiding death as the American's gradually overtake the entire island. He is joined by a young man that he first thinks is a spy for the secret police only to find later that this man has been disgraced for failure to follow an idiotic order from a superior officer.     The Japanese faced amazing odds. Over a 40 day period they suffered over 22,000 casualties until only 216 remained. The empire was crumbling and reinforcements and supplies never came. Hiroshi Wantanabe played the loyal Lieutenant Fujita, aide to the General, who had to repeatedly bear bad news to the General who was plotting how to make the best of an impossible situation.     Clint Eastwood produced a highly entertaining film here. The film is thoughtful and intellectual as it opens our eyes to Japanese culture of the time and the influence on the soldiers and officers. The film also explored empathy as we see several scenes where a top officer, Baron Nishi, converse with a wounded American solder. The Japanese were humanized in the film. They were never made to appear innocent of wartime crimes committed in China and elsewhere. Rather, we were given a balanced vision and insight into the Japanese military culture that fanned the war and the broad range of men and ethics and intelligence levels that interacted in this military-social system. We may not understand fully the authoritarian dictatorial leadership social structure that was the Japanese military norm, but we can see its negative effects on common men with common sense who could not question authority due to rigid social norms.     Overall this is a thoughtful and moving and artistic entertainment experience of a high order.

B000FVBLEI|4.0|Formulas exist for a reason; when they work, they are extremely effective. And when it comes to the much-maligned genre known as \\"metalcore,\\" ATR has the formula down. Take the thundering melodies and crunching riffs of heavy metal, mix them with the throat-ripping screams and crushing breakdowns of hardcore, add in plenty of double-bass drumming and a few guitar solos, blend it all at mosh-inducing speed, and the result is music that will take up space in your brain for awhile. It also helps to have the right musicians, and ATR has that covered as well. Former guitar teacher Oli Hebert and his onetime student Mike Martin are a solid guitar tandem, and Hebert is capable of some blazing lead work. Bassist Jeanne Sagan is serviceable enough to at least avoid the \\"girl bass player\\" stereotype; drummer Shannon Larkin is all about speed and precision. But the real star of this show is ATR's talented frontman, Phil Labonte, an incredibly versatile vocalist who screams, shouts, growls and shrieks his way through all ten songs...oh yeah, he can actually sing, too. As a lyricist, Labonte does best when he sticks to optimistic themes of motivation and determination on songs like \\"Not Alone,\\" \\"The Air That I Breathe\\" and \\"This Calling;\\" his tales of broken romance (\\"Six,\\" \\"Whispers,\\" \\"Empty Inside\\") veer into Bullet For My Valentine territory. If there's such a thing as a \\"prototype\\" for a metalcore band, All That Remains might be it. But that's not really a bad thing if the music gives the genre a good name.

B001E7X4M4|4.0|After working with producer Terry Date to create the industrial-strength thrash of their last effort \\"III: In The Eyes Of Fire,\\" Unearth returns to their comfort zone on \\"The March,\\" by putting Adam Dutkiewicz back in the producer's chair. Dutkiewicz helmed Unearth's 2004 CD, \\"The Oncoming Storm,\\" and just like that effort and other Adam D recordings, \\"The March\\" is tight, polished (perhaps a bit too polished at times), and heavy as a ten-ton brick.     Much as they did on \\"Storm,\\" Unearth combines surging, melodic riffs with crushing breakdowns and the righteous rage of Trevor Phipps' lyrics and vocals; Phipps gives his best performance yet on this effort. At the same time the band maintains the raw, desperate energy and unrelenting intensity that marked \\"III,\\" and adds new dimensions. Guitarists Buzz McGrath and Ken Susi are clearly in touch with their inner guitar heroes; solos abound on \\"The March.\\" New drummer Derek Kerswill's steady and powerful playing contrasts with the manic style of his predecessor, Mike Justian. He's a welcome and well-suited addition to the band. Anthemic songs like \\"My Will Be Done,\\" \\"We Are Not Anonymous\\" and \\"The Chosen\\" practically cry out for mosh pits and shout-alongs; they should be highlights of the band's live set. Unearth even gets downright experimental--for them anyhow--with the slower, seething groove of \\"Letting Go\\" (bassist John Maggard stands out here, as well as on the title song) and the album's epic final track...which isn't \\"Truth Or Consequence\\" by the way.    We live in dark and frightening times. People are angry, and seek angry music as a cathartic antidote to the chaos. Metal thrives in such circumstances, so it's really no surprise that Metallica's new album shot to number one in its first week of release, and Slipknot topped the charts just a few weeks before. Many of metal's newer bands such as Unearth, Underoath, Trivium and All That Remains are releasing new material, and the time is ripe for this new generation to move metal to the forefront again. On \\"The March,\\" Unearth hits their stride and makes the case for taking it to the next level.
B001GQ2TGA|3.0|Hard to start a review that many will hate, but I'll try.  I have to firstly admit openly that I love Enya's music, I would not say everything she has done is brilliant, but the largest bulk of her production is superb and groundbreaking in many ways.  I began getting disillusioned with Enya's musical direction with 'A day without rain', Although I like the songs and find moments of true genius in all of them, I felt betrayed by the sparse instrumentation and the fixed formula (verse-chorus-bridge-verse-chorus) It became so marked that I could tell you where the bridge  was in any of the songs by just sliding the progress bar past the middle of the song.  In one word, I missed the complexity/simplicity she achieved before.  Amaranthine was no better, besides Water Shows the Hidden Heart, sumiregusa and It's in the Rain, the rest was repetitious and the same, thin instrumental arrangements, in a way the anathema of what her musical style stood for.  Well, And winter came is no solution to this.  Firstly, a 'xmas' album is not one high on my list, as much as I love xmas, if I want the sound of xmas I'll get the Cambridge singers doing traditional carols, besides she already released the sound of the seasons not too long ago, that should have been enough.  Here we have the same repetitive structures with the sparse musical accompaniment, so thin that sometimes I want to yell 'for the love of God Enya, get some new instruments!'.  Mind you, the album is good, some of these songs are lovely songs, well made, with great vocal mastery and all that, but for someone breaking musical ground for the last 20 years, this shows no growth, it actually shows a certain boredom, as if the most she can muster is the melodies and a bit of work on the layering of the harmonies, no musical exploration, nada.  For all the niceness of the melodies, musically, the album offers very little and says very little of where Enya's talent is.  To the risk of crucifixion by fans, I would say that if this is the best you have to offer now, you should have stopped with the memory of trees and leave it at that. Now, don't hate me, it is my opinion after all, just that.<br /><br />PS- Enya, if you read this, please DO buy new instruments, hire a little string quartet, get a couple of gypsy players, anything but the pizzicato and the Yamaha sound piano, please! and find another rhythm to write in, you have already worn this one out, everything now sounds like only time.f this is the best you have to offer now, you should have stopped with the memory of trees and leave it at that.

The video and audio quality are excellent and the story is magical. There's really nothing more to say.

B001ED7C58|3.0|I was conjuring visions of romantic music and sort of a 'rainwashed' forest theme along with the playlist that Stephenie Meyers listened to while she was writing the books.      We did get a Linkin Park (\\"By Myself\\") and the lovely \\"Tremble for my Beloved\\" by Collective Soul, but I was hoping for closer to the Billy Joel's \\"Lullaby\\" than the instrumental we got.

B000UJ48WC|5.0|When this came out on DVD, I gave it another shot, after not being too impressed with the VHS the first time. Wow, what a difference!,  Now, the Blu-Ray is out and now the film has taken another giant leap.  It makes the other versions look primitive.     On its own - and I'm not a horror movie buff - I found it to be very entertaining and very suspenseful film. Those visuals are so good that I didn't mind the slow pace. Jack Nicholson was perfect for the role. Shelley Duvall was fascinating with her \\"Olive Oyl\\" face, smile and soft voice. She got panned by a lot of people, and that was unfair. She's fine. The kid (Danny Lloyd) was good, too, as were the supporting players.    If you are any kind of a fan of this film, or director Stanley Kubrick's unique style of filmmaking, you owe it to yourself to look at it on this high-definition transfer.  You'll be amazed how great it looks.

B000WOWWXC|1.0|This is how I knew that Cedric and Omar were done with being great. At the Drive-in was special. And Deloused in the Comatorium showed some promise as a follow-up after that band broke up. But this CD literally put me to sleep the first two times I tried to listen to it. The songs are too long and completely forgettable. And you get the sense that the band is just jamming in the studio, improvising like they didn't show up with real material and just faked their way through the album. But hey, if that's your thing, waste your money.

I have loved all the popular movie characters just like every other big fan and had no interest in seeing the cartoon (really!). I went to see the movie only because my kids wanted to see it (and they are too young to go by themselves!).  Despite myself, I was really impressed. It was pretty awesome which is saying something when you consider how many movies one sees by the time one is \\"middle-aged\\"! I think this is just the style of medium George Lukas needs to convey the rest of the story.  Animation is just so versatile!  Good show George and Thanks!

0671799320|5.0|The recent and tumultuous situation with petroleum pricing, coupled with the obviously baleful effects on the environment of hydrocarbon fuels, combined with rising demands, diminishing supplies, economic turmoil in the world economy and sourcing from the ever-unstable Middle East prompted me to re-read Daniel Yergin's masterpiece, \\"The Prize\\".<br /><br />While everyone has an opinion on petroleum pricing and usage, ranging from simple-minded conspiracy theories to empirical invocations of \\"market economies\\", no one outside \\"the business\\" can legitimately lay claim to having an informed opinion on the topic without having carefully read this book.<br /><br />As is often the case in history, there is an annoyingly repetitious flavor to the story.  Fluctuations in petroleum supply/demand ratios, wildly variable pricing, toxic waste accumulation, political machinations, corporate manipulation, Cassandra-like warnings of the dire implications of reliance on hydrocarbon-based energy, attempts to formulate national and international strategies...its all been stated, argued and ignored since the 1930s.  As US Interior Secretary Harold Ickes caustically remarked during the War, \\"It is impossible to carry the American people along with you on a program of caution to forestall a threatening position.\\"  Yergin noted that, \\"Prevention, whether it be an ounce or a pound was bad politics...\\"  Of course, the same holds true now, as then.<br /><br />The insights into the \\"culture\\" of the oil magnates as well as those of the governments who sometimes worked with them (whilst simultaneously indicting them for \\"collusion\\", as did the US Justice Department);  the motives of the Middle Eastern oil producers;  the founding of OPEC (largely instigated by a Venezualan with Spartan tastes combined with ecological sympathies) and the re-appearance of the same confusion and mixed motives by virtually the same cast of players who currently occupy the stage are all brilliantly detailed in this book.<br /><br />As for the writing, Yergin writes in an engaging and interesting style.  Of course, there are some tedious sections in this very long book, but it certainly holds the interest of the motivated, non-technical reader.<br /><br />In summary, this book, while written almost twenty years ago, remains important and timely at the close of the second decade of the 21st century.

B0014DZ2VO|3.0|Okay, the actors are great. The locations are cool. BUT the action scenes are overabundant, cartoonish and detract from what could have been a good story.  If any mortal man went through the first two minutes of a Bond action scene without being dead or in permanent traction...he'd be something more than mortal.  Physically possible action scenes can be exciting, action scenes that don't break the laws of physics can make for good film.  But when it's hi tech Tom and Jerry and Superman thrown in for good measure, the viewer gets quickly tired of all the bang and boom, and looks foward to some vintage Bond.  He doesn't get too much of it in this film. As for Bond Girls, Olga ain't ugly, but she's predictable model turned actress stuff. Daniel Craig is the Man with the Golden Glum outlook, who just gets scratched no matter how many leaps and bounds and thousands of rounds are thrown at him.  Okay, we know the movie market as perceived by commercial studios is teen aged with short attention spans.  We know that this movie made tons of pounds for the producers.  But we don't have to bend and scrape before directors that are more interested in demolition than dialogue, and scripts that have turned a charismatic character into a continuity device for professional stuntmen.  See it, but don't think you're getting the Bond that bears the most interest.
B000ZLFALI|1.0|This pretentious nonsense preaches socially conscious lessons straight from the hippy manifesto as an excuse to stitch together hallucinogenic music videos featuring a variety of performers singing Beatles songs. The songs vary in quality dramatically, with the very worst being \\"Let It Be\\", \\"Come Together\\", and \\"I Want You\\" (as an Army recruiting musical), although given the breadth of material it's hard to single out a true low point.<br /><br />There is lots of very plastic dialogue about revolution, etc. (e.g. \\"We need to radicalize!\\"), which would be easier to take seriously if the characters weren't named Jude, Prudence, Lucy, Jojo, and other obvious starting points for musical numbers. While the film is ostensibly a love story, it it's really more an excuse to revisit the radicalism of the 1960's, with spoiled self-important whiny brats providing self-indulgent and brainless commentary on world events, with Vietnam at the obvious forefront.<br /><br />Several things should be obvious takeaways from this cinematic Hindenburg: Bono shouldn't act, Joe Cocker should never be backed by a choir, and Julie Taymor should never, ever be allowed to make another movie. Ever.<br /><br />This would be the last movie I would recommend to my worst enemy.

0375826726|2.0|Yes, it's a brilliant dust jacket - well done!  However, the book leaves me sorely wanting - it's like it got past an editor somehow; a proper editor would have slashed this book in half at least.  Could have been written better in say 150-200 pages tops!<br /><br />First, let me say, I thought Eragon was great (not the movie), Eldest less so, but still a fine achievement, and kept me satisfyingly on edge for the next one.  Brisingr is verbose, long-winded and kind of sappy.  You simply start to not care about these characters, which is a deathblow.  Pages and pages and pages and pages go by that could have been compressed into far fewer - the Varden's still encamped and STILL getting ready.  Sure, that's war, but I don't want such the granular feel of it.  I want a story that draws one in - things need to happen for a purpose or get rid of them.<br /><br />This has a lot of Eragon and Saphira pining for each other and Eragon regretting the life he's taken from bugs and shrubs: yes, the concept's nice, but it seems like a self-indulgent melancholy rather than a moral struggle.  This book feels rushed perhaps with contract deadlines, or that the writer, such a young brilliant writer, was perhaps pushing his art - Paolini's presence is felt in this one, and decidedly wooden. I respect the effort, but, simply put, this feels like an unfinished manuscript - a river without banks!<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />A few weeks have passed since I wrote this and I want to add something.  Yes, I thoroughly still agree that this is the weakest book in the series thus far; perhaps the best review I've read so far is this one: \\"...events have been dark and bloody of late.\\", September 27, 2008 By racapowski.  Check it out -<br /><br />But the best story of our time is most likely Lord of the Rings (with a possible more recent argument in there for Harry Potter - because it's reached so, so many people).  So many have come along to try and emulate that Tolkein style and give us a satisfying reading experience, and none have succeeded so well as the young Paolini - his books accomplish what no others have.  I am writing again today, because I think we need to acknowledge this aspect to be fair.<br /><br />I also imagine the stress of notoriety, a film, publishers looking for a release date, etc. - may have happened here, and caused a book to be released prematurely; an editor did not do the necessary slashing to make this a tight read and, as I say above, it becomes a river without banks.<br /><br />Ultimately, I think the volume needs to stand on its own and so this is really no excuse, and this one sadly doesn't - but I wanted to acknowledge how much he has grabbed our attention with his work and to wish him well.

I've heard some of the complaints about Breaking Dawn, and I understand where they're coming from, however I just adored it!

A definite must have for anyone who enjoyed the series from the beginning!!
B000UR9QHQ|5.0|I think HALLOWEEN has been around so long that nothing new can be said about it. It is a classic and shall forever be. I was a senior in high school when it came out. It has forever changed the Halloween season for me. I cannot imagine Halloween without HALLOWEEN. I think it has a lot more meaning for us \\"older\\" kids. Just like DAWN OF THE DEAD, FRIDAY THE 13th, CARRIE, and my personal favorite, THE SHINING. they were all pioneer movies. The music and the mood of these films will never be matched, copied, yes. I highly recommend all five of these movies. There are alot of other decent horror movies out also, but if I want to \\"go back in time\\", I just pop in one of these and let the memories & goosebumps start.
B000BKVQTS|2.0|Terry Gilliam just can't get past the visual, much like Tim Burton. Sometimes the visuals don't thwart the rest of the film, sometimes they do.<br /><br />In Brothers Grimm, the visuals overwhelm a film that would have very little going for it anyway. Terrible dialogue, confused plot, poor acting (by excellent actors) -- all under really poor direction.<br /><br />Why are so many characters -- Heath Ledger, Jonathan Pryce, Peter Stormare, among others -- given pointless, thick, accents which, when coupled with painfully confused dialogue, make them all but incomprehensible? Why in the remote village setting, are so many different accents piled on top of one another? Just an example of revoltingly bad scripting.<br /><br />To his credit, Gilliam manages to hold the film together through to its conclusion, but that's about all. It amounts to getting most of the passengers off the ship before it sinks.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|I thought that \\"Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade\\" was pretty bad, but this is the ultimate stinker!  Why did they do this?  Harrison Ford is old and decrepit these days.  The sound man probably had to edit out all his wheezing when he just bent down to pick up his hat.  So I can imagine he was struggling a lot with some of the scenes where a stuntman wouldn't work.  And that energetic \\"Indiana Jones\\" theme music was ridiculous to hear knowing that Harrison Ford was probably ready to pass out from running so much on the screen.<br /><br />No, I won't be buying this DVD.  God, I hope they don't do another \\"Indiana Jones\\", at least not with Harrison Ford.  It's OK to get another younger actor.  They do for James Bond and it seems to work.<br /><br />\\"Indiana Jones\\" is a great saga to continue (perhaps with a better story writer), but Harrison Ford should move on to something else.  How about \\"Grumpy Old Men III\\".<br /><br />I hope I can convince my kids to watch \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" and \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\" now that I've seen them put their fingers to their noses to this one.  I can't blame them that they were disappointed watching this with me.<br /><br />And one more thing; CGI is really killing the appeal of movie these days.  It's like watching cartoons being put in the movie and we're suppose to take it seriously? The old-fashion visual effects and the lack of CGI is probably the reason why the original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy was more visually believable and entertaining than the over-saturated CGI effects of the \\"Star Wars\\" prequel.<br /><br />Does anyone else agree?

0743243153|2.0|Dr. Peck should have cut this book in half and sold it as two separate books. I liked the first half, but disliked the second. It's divided in 4 sections. Here's my 1/10 grade on each section:<br /><br />DISCIPLINE: 7<br />LOVE: 8<br />GROWTH AND RELIGION: 4<br />GRACE: 2<br /><br />As you can see, I believe the first two sections were much better than the last two sections. The book was getting interesting and then suddenly it took a sharp turn and went downhill after that.<br /><br />PROS:<br />- Conversational writing style, although a bit long-winded at times.<br /><br />- Several engrossing ancedotes about his patients, especially in the section called love.<br /><br />- Each section is just a few pages, helping to make things flow.<br /><br />CONS:<br />- Paragraphs are hard to digest: he often has enormous paragraphs that take up nearly the whole page.<br /><br />- Peck's tough love is a bit much. The book begins: \\"Life is difficult.\\" He goes on to describe how tough everything is, the importance of discipline, and not to be lazy, etc.... Personally, I don't see life as being such a monumental struggle. Maybe I'm lucky, but I felt that too often Peck looks at situations as the glass being half full. I suspect his world view came from working with patients who had problems. He listened to people complain all day. If I had that job, I might also conclude that life is difficult. However, I felt like Peck was a military man ordering me around.<br /><br />- Too preachy. I have a degree in Religion, and perhaps because of that, I have a wider view of world religions than Peck. Although he occassionally mentions the Buddha, he is a strong Christian. There's nothing wrong with that, but I was expecting that this book would be less preachy. Some readers (like me) who expect this to be a secular book will be surprised by the religious turn it takes in Part 3.<br /><br />- It's shocking at the bottom of page 175 (in my early edition) where he says he would have sex with his patient if he thought it would help her! It's not surprising that later Peck would admit to having had several extra-marital affairs. His wife of 40+ years divorced him a few years before his death. My point is that such statements in this book make me lose confidence in his judgment and make me question everything he writes.<br /><br />- In the \\"Miracle of Evolution\\" section, he states that humanity is the top of evolution. This 19th century belief has been updated by most scientists in the 21st century. Humans are just on branch on the evolutionary tree, and not necessarily the highest branch. In a global nuclear war, mosquitoes may feel genetically superior to us because they will have survived.<br /><br />- He argues we are the center of the universe. I don't buy it. He writes, \\"We live our lives in the eye of God, and not at the periphery but at the center of His vision, His concern.\\" God didn't even put us in the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, but on its periphery. Maybe Peck's right, but he didn't convince me.<br /><br />WHO MIGHT LIKE IT: Traditional Christians will probably disagree with my review. Some Christians might love how Peck merges psychology and religion. I didn't.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: I had high expectations for this book, having heard much about it. It was more disjointed than I expected. The turn it takes halfway through the book is particularly unexpected. I prefer books like \\"Your Best Life Now!\\" where the author is up front with the reader about his intentions to preach his religious beliefs to him. Peck sneaks it in there and it's a turnoff.his patient if he thought it would help her! It's not surprising that later Peck would admit to having had several extra-marital affairs.

He writes, \\"We live our lives in the eye of God, and not at the periphery but at the center of His vision, His concern.\\" God didn't even put us in the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, but on its periphery. Maybe Peck's right, but he didn't convince me.<br /><br />WHO MIGHT LIKE IT: Traditional Christians will probably disagree with my review. Some Christians might love how Peck merges psychology and religion. I didn't.<br /><br />CONCLUSION: I had high expectations for this book, having heard much about it. It was more disjointed than I expected. The turn it takes halfway through the book is particularly unexpected. I prefer books like \\"Your Best Life Now!\\" where the author is up front with the reader about his intentions to preach his religious beliefs to him. Peck sneaks it in there and it's a turnoff.
B000065U1N|5.0|It's one of the best war movies of all times, so far (2009). It's so real, bloody, brutal and intense that I felt as if the battle was happenning right in front of me. If you want to see a movie that faithfully depicts courage and the horror of war, this is definitely the film to watch.    I've watched it 3 times. Each time, I shuddered at the graphic and realistic scenes. I own it.
B000G75994|5.0|The sound quality is excellent. I've never thought DDD added much to piano sonatas, since the waveform of a single instrument is less complicated than that of, say, a full orchestra with a large choir. But the clarity is superb and feels like the piano is right there in the room with you. As far as the artistry is concerned, it's a matter of taste, but I consider this one of the best interpretations of the Mozart sonatas I've heard, including those of Horowitz. I don't think you can go wrong with this one.
0374531269|2.0|I found this book to be quite harrowing:  I frequently had to put it down and cool off, so troubling was the stuff I was reading.<br /><br />But that was only up to about page 50 or so.  After that it became a lot easier to stomach.<br /><br />Why page 50?  Because that's when I went to the internet and learned a little bit about the book's author, Ishmael Beah.<br /><br />In short, Beah, while he apparently did undergo some rather unpleasant experiences in his native Sierra Leone, evidently did not undergo all the experiences related in \\"A Long Way Gone,\\" or at least not directly.  Many journalists have labeled this book a fraud.<br /><br />If you'd like to find out about the controversy yourself, start with his Wikipedia page.  Follow the links at the bottom.<br /><br />Anyhow, some observations:<br /><br />1.  Beah has to be a world-class moron for not grasping that playing fast and loose with the truth in the age of the Internet is something that would later come back to haunt him.  And don't tell me he was an untutored villager who had no way of understanding the implications of this:  he was a student at Oberlin.<br /><br />2.  If Beah had simply pulled a Frederick Exley and said, \\"Hey, folks, this is a fictionalized autobiography.  I'm not so much interested in the precise truth of events so much as the effect they had on my spirit and development.\\"  He would be untouchable.<br /><br />3.  This irony is certainly not deliberate, but you know how the central thrust of the book is that after an endless parade of horrors, you get inured?  After pages and pages of blood, several limbs, and mutilated bodies, you pretty much stop caring.  It's like you're an armchair boy soldier!<br /><br />4.  Beah should be despised, not \\"addressing the U.N.\\"  True, he may have \\"forgiven himself\\" in some feel-good workshop, but I for one haven't forgiven him.  Look, if they gave him a Kalashnikov when he was 7 or 8 and bullied him into shooting up the town, that'd be one thing.  But 15?  That's old enough to know the difference between right and wrong in any culture.  Murderer.ong in any culture.  Murderer.
0374530718|1.0|&#34;Sophie's World&#34; is a trite and ploddingly written textbook trying to masquerade as a novel of meta fiction. Mr. Gaarder writes with a pedantic style when he presents the philosophy lectures/letters in the novel. The dialogue of the characters is trite and unrealistic at best. Usually I am little more kind in book reviews, but I do not understand all the fuss about this one.<br />I think many people praise it because of its cutesy story arc of fictional characters living in perpetuity outside of the world of their texts. Sorry folks, but this is not a very original idea. For a far superior take on the same themes look to Pirandello's masterful play &#34;Six Characters in Search of an Author&#34;.<br />Mr. Gaarder barely connects his two storylines about a philosophy course, and a man writing a book about a philosophy course, and when they do intersect one is hard pressed to find the thematic relevance. It is almost like he expects the reader to be impressed by the intertwining story lines and their subject matter, and to forget that he does a terrible job of bridging the two.<br />Take a philosophy course, or read some meta fiction. This text is a poor example of both!

0439813786|3.0|Hey, everybody!  I just finished a 530-page novel in about 2 hours!  Er, well, I should fess up to the fact that I was helped along by the fact that 2/3rd of it is illustrations.  As for the remaining third, many pages just have a sentence or two.  I don't think I'll repeating this feat anytime soon.<br /><br />I see from the other reviews that there was a great deal of hoopla surrounding the publication of this book.  I know nothing about that.  I had never heard of it or its author when I found it in the local library and took it home -- without even flipping through it.<br /><br />I was surprised by all the pictures, but I liked it.  I thought the whole thing with twice as many illustrations as text wasn't working as well as the author presumed it was, but it was an enjoyable read.  Its strongest point was a tight and suspenseful story.<br /><br />There are problems, however:  Selznick is apparently unaware of the effect of his passing innuendos:  I was given the distinct impression that Melies had amnesia.<br /><br />And certain loose ends are left loose even at the end of the story:  we never learn, for example, what caused the fire that did Hugo's father in.
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|I'm another one who doesn't typically buy Christmas releases. Just thinking of horrid holiday fare like \\"Last Christmas, I Gave You My Heart\\", \\"Baby Please Come Home for Christmas\\" and \\"Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer\\" is nearly enough to make me go into self imposed audio exile until after New Year's. When I got the email from Amazon to pre-order the New Enya release I didn't think for a moment. I love Enya's music so I ordered first and checked it out afterward. Oh no, a Christmas CD... Ah well, too late. I decided to give her a chance. I'm glad I did. This isn't your typical remake of a dozen hackneyed holiday hits. While there are a couple of well known Christmas tunes here (a gorgeous Gaelic rendition of Silent Night and a haunting rendition of O Come O come Emmanuel) the rest are more subtle in sticking to the theme, so I'll be able to enjoy them in August as well as December. I was a little disappointed in Amarantine - the arrangements didn't vary much from song to song and seemed a little predictable. I'm happy to say that \\"And Winter Came\\" is a step in the right direction. The arrangements are more varied (though there's nothing startling here if you're familiar with Enya's catalog - that's a good thing to my ears.) and there's even a tasty electric guitar solo in the playful \\"My! My! Time Flies!\\". Well done Enya, Nicky and Roma.
B0013FNC38|5.0|For his third album, We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things, singer-songwriter Jason Mraz has delivered a breezy collection of pop songs that take their cues from the '70s.  The result is an engaging, easygoing listen that never quite gets out of first gear. The songs wash over you, often like a cool breeze on a hot summer's day, but unlike previous Mraz LPs there's a sense that he's a little too chilled musically and there's not enough diversity.  That said, some of the songwriting displays real honesty, while two collaborations - with James Morrison and Colbie Caillat.  The reggae-infused \\"I'm Yours\\", which really ought to become one of the summer's great love anthems - a song so sweet and happy.   Lucky continues the acoustic vibe and benefits from a lovely boy-girl vocal trade-off between Mraz and Caillat. It's unashamedly optimistic, boasting lines such as \\"lucky I'm in love with my best friend, lucky to have been where I've been, lucky to be coming home again\\".  Mraz's cheeky side is exemplified in the sexy Butterfly, an ode to a woman's \\"secret smile\\", that boasts such suggestive lyrics as \\"let me feel feel you upside down, slide in, slide out...\\" and \\"I want to flower you\\". It's snappy and once again propelled by a horn section that adds extra charm.  In stark contrast, however, comes Love For A Child, a tender, heartfelt lament from a child who wishes his parents had been better. It's a sobering reminder of Mraz's diverse ability to mix fun and melodrama, frivolty with seriousness. And it's a real grower.  Details In The Fabric, meanwhile, is a pick-me-up for anyone who's feeling down, a beautifully constructed slow-burner that's all about reassurance and friendship. It's built around some tender acoustic guitar licks and a nice vocal collaboration from James Morrison.

He suggested TNotW, I could hardly put it down.  Then I find out that its the Author's FIRST book!  I am now in total awe of this guy!  Looking for something new?

I almost just wish she would write a whole other story to talk about Edward and Bella's new life together.  If you are a fan of the twilight books then you must read this wonderful ending!! I really didn't want these books to end. I enjoyed reading them so much that I could not put them down. I read all of the books in a 2 week time span.  They totally made me neglect everything else in my life.  So be prepared to devote your time.
0060512806|5.0|I started reading this book thinking I had bitten off more than I could chew. By the time I finished on the 1153rd page, I wanted another 1153 pages. Between the development of exciting/intelligent/dynamic/fun characters, the storylines, the overall plot, the twists, the action, the humor, Cryptonomicon is one of my top 3 favorite novels. Though it seems long, it's difficult book to put down once you get started.    Cryptonomicon has everything: WWII action from both sides, spying, code breaking, adventure, action, humor, treasure hunting, computer engineering, hacking, sex, intrigue, covert operations, espionage, and to top it all off a love story that spans two generations. When I pictured the characters in this novel, for some reason, I imagined the characters from Ocean's 11 for some reason.     The dual storylines between WWII and current day took some getting used to, but when all said and done, was the best way to tell this story.     My only gripe is that it concluded too quickly; I could have used another 20 pages or an epilogue, but suffice to say, I love this book, have read it twice, and have reccommended it to all my friends.    Now I am reccommending it to you.

Of course it's all pipedreams for him as he works with his unsusual dad (Voiced by James Hong) who serves noodles, but one day as the great masters ChiFu (Voiced by Dustin Hoffman) and Oogway (Voiced by Randull Duk Kim) wants to choose who the Dragon Warrior is but when he accidently gets chosen by Oogway he is believed to be the chosen one to fight against an escaped criminal named TaiLung (Ian Mcshane) who's very powerful and strong. Shifu with the furious five known as Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Viper (Lucy Liu), Monkey (Jackie Chan), Crane (David Cross), and Mantis (Seth Rogen) seem to dislike Po as they don't think he's the true Dragon Warrior but according to Oogway they must train him from clumsy fat-oaf to savior to the village.<br /><br />Very entertaining, hilarious and heartwarming animated martial arts comedy from Dreamworks that is their greatest animated movie since \\"Shrek 1 & 2\\" or \\"Over The Hedge\\". This is the first time for Dreamworks not to use pop culture references or modern music (except at the end credits) but focuses on straight storytelling with good timed humor and great animation to go with it. I love how the CGI is realistic to go with some imaginative traditional animated dream sequences and ending credits that would remind viewers of \\"Ninja Scroll\\" and \\"Samurai Jack\\". Han Zimmer's music score is outstanding yet very Asian and the film also uses heart to go along with it including a nice hidden message about what a secret can be.<br /><br />This blu-Ray is mindblowingly awesome with it's brilliant picture and sound quality that will knock your socks off.

0142002038|5.0|Doctor No starts off weakly but finishes strong. Picking up a few weeks after the conclusion of From Russia with Love, Doctor No finds Bond just returning from a long stay in hospital after being poisoned. M is determined to keep Bond out of strenuous duty, so he sends him on a presumably easy mission to investigate the disappearance of British Intelligence's Jamaican operator. And by the way, M seems to add as an afterthought, some people have been dying mysteriously on nearby Crab Key.<br /><br />Bond resents the easy assignment but has a hunch that the deaths on Doctor No's private island may have something to do with the missing intelligence man and his secretary. He pokes around Jamaica, is sharp enough to detect a poisoned fruitbasket and narrowly avoids being bitten by a giant centipede. He meets up with Quarrel, the Cayman Islander boatman from Live and Let Die, and sneaks onto Crab Key one night. On Crab Key he meets Honeychile \\"Honey\\" Rider, who collects rare shells--in the nude, of course--on the island in hopes of earning enough money to correct a broken nose.<br /><br />Of course, things on Crab Key are not what they seem--or perhaps they are, since there's never much question whether Dr. No is the villain or not. Bond and Honey are captured, tortured, and, in the end, manage to foil Dr. No's plot--and spend some \\"slave-time\\" together.<br /><br />I was disappointed with Doctor No at first. It follows on the heels of From Russia with Love, one of the best Bond novels and one that ends in a major cliffhanger: at the end, Bond collapses to the floor after being poisoned. The end. Doctor No quickly tidies up the loose ends from the last novel and sends Bond on his way to Jamaica. There Bond pokes around, searching for information the reader already knows. But perhaps the biggest disappointment was Honey Rider, who may be the quintessential movie Bond girl, but here is a bit of a cipher.<br /><br />But while the first third or so of the novel is mediocre, the story dramatically improves once Bond has reached Crab Key and the party beings its trek inland. While there had been only moments of suspense before--the centipede in Bond's bed was a good scene, but only one among a lot of mediocre ones--the suspense steadily builds as Bond and Honey are captured, led before the Doctor himself, and then separated for equally miserable fates.<br /><br />Bond's dilemma at the climax of the novel reminded me quite a lot of \\"The Most Dangerous Game,\\" a short story you must Google if you haven't read it. Bond is placed in an obstacle course of Dr. No's design, where he is subjected to claustrophobic spaces, 50-foot drops, cold, heat, spiders, and finally, the sea and its monsters. This section was among the best writing of the Bond series--by this point, I couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />Doctor No would have been a forgettable entry in the Bond series had it not been for the final half. If you read this novel, be prepared for sometimes boring sections in the first half, but keep reading--the finale is worth it.<br /><br />Recommended.e story dramatically improves once Bond has reached Crab Key and the party beings its trek inland.

B001KVZ6BG|4.0|Slumdog Millionaire offers an enticingly original presentation of familiar tales by utilizing a flashback system of storytelling that fuses exhilarating adventure with suspenseful drama.  Many of the scenarios created are nothing new, but the fantastical delivery and extraordinary setting undoubtedly provide a refreshing take on more traditional themes.<br /><br />In a series of flashbacks, Slumdog Millionaire retraces young Jamal Malik's (Dev Patel) life up to his current predicament.  He is a contestant on the Hindi version of \\"Who Wants to be a Millionaire\\" and, much to the chagrin of the show's producers and arrogant host Prem Kumar (Anil Kapoor), Jamal manages to reach the million dollar question.  But before he can answer, time runs out and he is brought backstage to be violently interrogated by Mumbai's thuggish police.  As Jamal explains how he knew the answer to each of the questions presented, we learn the amazing tale of the youth's turbulent childhood and his undying search for a long lost love.<br /><br />Slumdog's finest accomplishment lies within a unique method of flashback storytelling that perfectly complements the line of questioning presented during the game show.  As Jamal recounts his adventurous and often dangerous childhood growing up in the slums of Mumbai, we slowly learn the trials and triumphs he has faced and his ultimate reason for competing on the show.  This steady build of characters and settings creates a mesmerizing vehicle that allows the audience to easily ride along with Jamal on his tempestuous journey to face his destiny.<br /><br />For a cast consisting primarily of child actors and debut performances, the acting is surprisingly strong.  The three main characters are shown at several different stages in their lives and each perfectly complements their previous incarnations.  The children truly steal the show as they face the hardships of growing up in such despondent situations, yet while their innocence is lost their spirits remain unbroken, and Patel, Mittal, and Pinto admirably carry on their legacies to a fateful conclusion.<br /><br />Slumdog Millionaire presents a recognizably surefire love story that has been seen before. But the process in which it is used - the method of storytelling - is wholly original and genuinely entertaining. A rare setting, a coming of age flashback setup, and wonderfully developed characters make Slumdog Millionaire a winning fantasy of unyielding love. It knows when to provoke emotions through heartache, musically driven segments and ardent drama, and knows how to keep the viewer captured by the beauty of love's destiny.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinsand Patel, Mittal, and Pinto admirably carry on their legacies to a fateful conclusion.

B0014DZ2VO|3.0|Quantum of Solace is a first in numerous ways for the legendary James Bond. It is the first Bond film to be a direct sequel; it is the first time a duet is sung as the opening theme song (Another Way to Die, by Jack White and Alicia Keys); it's the first time Felix Leiter has been played by the same actor in two consecutive movies; it's also the shortest James Bond movie to date (irony, since it's predecessor Casino Royale is the longest). It is not, however, the first Bond film to fall back into a rut that will require the changing of the lead actor to get out of.<br /><br />Picking up almost immediately where Casino Royale left off, Quantum of Solace finds a somber James Bond (Daniel Craig) investigating the existence of a mysterious organization with ties to his former love's tragic demise. His quest will take him across the globe, team him with a beautiful spy (Olga Kurylenko) seeking her own form of revenge, and pit him against a ruthless environmentalist and a military dictator attempting to control a country's water supply.<br /><br />Quantum of Solace is essentially one action sequence after another, loosely tied together with the usual nonsense of world takeover and high-tech criminal organizations. It's no wonder that the film is short - the intense action scenes are certainly jam-packed with enough explosions, stunts, and bravado that oodles of money were thrown at their setup. Apparently so much so that funds couldn't be expended to make the story sensible. Although Bond films have never been known for their logical or even meaningful plots, Quantum of Solace never even tries. The storyline itself is only a means to get from one exotic stunt locale to the next. And great lengths are taken to make sure Bond utilizes sea, land and air combat skills and weaponry, spread across several countries including Austria, Chile, Italy and Mexico.<br /><br />Every five minutes there's another high-speed pursuit or violent melee. And that's definitely not a drawback in the action film department, although the use of The Bourne Ultimatum's stunt coordinator Dan Bradley paired with similar frenzied editing makes this new Bond grittier and visually hard to follow. Interesting juxtaposition, such as alternating shots of an opera and a gunfight, or the rotating of a berserk chase with matador footage are the bright points in editing.<br /><br />Perhaps what's most disappointing is the absence of the original James Bond theme (often credited to Monty Norman, but arranged by John Barry) which is as recognizable and powerful as John Williams tunes for Star Wars or Indiana Jones. How could the creators of Quantum of Solace possibly assume that its nonuse would be beneficial? Every single action scene could have been intensified tenfold if only a hint of that rousing riff were mixed in.<br /><br />With all of the significant modernizations the Bond franchise has undergone it feels like the creators are trying so hard to forget the previous installments. And yet a few trademark Bond-isms remain, though not the most important ones. A sulky siren sent to keep tabs on the secret agent sports the name \\"Strawberry Fields,\\" a classic throwback to the vixens of old, a certainly intentional homage. Bond also quickly seduces the fiery red head, an act that wouldn't seem odd from any other incarnation of the British agent, and perhaps not from this one save for the fact that Solace takes place immediately after Royale, and Vespa surely wouldn't have been forgotten that easily. To top it off there's even a scene recalling the famous gold-painted beauty from Goldfinger, forced to linger on screen only serving to remind us of this Bond's shortcomings.<br /><br />Quantum of Solace is action for the sake of action - which should please audiences looking for nonstop violent adventure. But the conversion to extreme seriousness that worked to reinvigorate the Batman series doesn't have the same results here, as a Bond so gravely solemn just isn't as much fun. No more clever catch phrases, silly puns, shaken martinis, over-the-top villains, or wildly awe-inspiring action sequences - this Bond feel more like a Bourne. At least the ludicrous plot to take over the world still exists. Quantum of Solace is the first Bond film not to use the famous spy's drink of choice, his gambling, or even his celebrated introduction. But aren't these things what make him Bond?<br /><br />- The Massie Twins, shaken martinis, over-the-top villains, or wildly awe-inspiring action sequences - this Bond feel more like a Bourne.

The scholarship and research in the notes and articles is top notch, yet it is concise enough to be highly accessible and usable.  While the Bible itself is enormous (because of all that is included), there isn't much I would take out!  If you're looking for more specifics and a very well-written review, be sure to read Tim Challies review at the top.
B001CZVVXW|5.0|Amazon's current listing of the aspect ratio as 1.33:1 is INCORRECT. Like all Blu-Ray productions (that aren't of classic films) Decca's new opera productions on Blu-Ray are 16:9 (or 1.85:1) and anamorphic (according to Ken of the Decca Music Group.

0312427999|1.0|Klein caters to her socialist audience with this work of astonishingly blatant distortions and falsehoods, knowing that it will sell to the true believers and that she'll get away with it.  But don't look here for real scholarship.  Her straw-man case against Friedman and free-markets it so blatantly distorted and fabricated that any gems of truth are lost in the mire.    Read the other one-star reviews for some details, and for a more thorough analysis read Johan Norberg's review in the October 2008 issue of Reason magazine, which shows how thoroughly Klein actually gets Friedman's position, and many facts about economics, exactly backward across the board.  To accomplish that requires more than error, it indicates a deliberate attempt to deceive.
B00000K31Q|5.0|This movie fits well within the genre of teen comedy, along with Clueless (which I also love). This movie is hilarious, and it is a romantic comedy. It's probably better enjoyed by the younger generations as this movie is set in high school but still, it's one of the movies you can just pop in and enjoy. If you've ever seen (and liked) Clueless, then this is a perfect movie for you.
B001AIRUP4|5.0|A problem with the review section is that is does not differentiate among the many releases and formats of this movie.  I have a VHS copy that I must have had for over a decade.  Many of the reviews are for various DVD transfers.  But the one I am reviewing is the Blu-ray version.<br /><br />The quality and clarity of this presentation is stunning.  I could not have imagined I'd be seeing the level of detail that is presented here.  If I had to name a fault, it was so clear that it made me aware of just how much the models have improved since this movie was made. In newer movies such as Corpse Bride, there's an improved feeling of flow to the animation. In this one, characters such as Sally appear as cruder toys when seen with all the detail. But those details are all consistent with the intent of the production.<br /><br />Once I got beyond the initial surprise of the Blu-ray transfer, I was able to enjoy the movie more than ever before.  The contrasts between the sets for Christmastown and Halloweentown reveal the true artistry in a way that the limitations of DVD did not allow. The transfer shows off the true differences between stop motion and the best of computer animation in a way that leaves one with a feeling of awe.<br /><br />I won't go into the details of the movie itself, since it's been around long enough that others have done so exhaustively. I don't know what criteria critics are supposed to apply to decide when something is one of the greatest movies ever made.  But in my subjective opinion, this one ranks among the best.<br /><br />If you share my view of the film itself, getting the Blu-ray version is well worth it, even if you think the DVD version is already impressive.
B000065U1N|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and the special features. It is action packed so there is never a lull, and it pulls on your heart-strings. It is a true story and for once, a movie actually got close to the truth. For some who were actually in Somalia serving our country, this movie may be a little hard to watch, my ex boyfriend could never watch this film because it was too realistic and brought back too many memories. But because it is realistic it is a great movie. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes true stories, drama, and war movies.
1595141979|5.0|I LOVED it!  This book is a great addition to the series and left me wanting MORE, MORE, MORE!! I can't wait for the next one--hopefully it will come out sooner than projected...

B001DHXT20|4.0|When I was younger, I used to watch re-runs of the 1970's INCREDIBLE HULK television show.  The show's executive producer, Kenneth Johnson, is a master storyteller and realized that if you tell a story that's nothing but action with no characterization, you don't have much of a story.  I was excited to see Ang Lee's 2003 HULK movie when it was released in theatres, but like many viewers was disappointed.  The film was a huge box office bomb and was stoned by most critics.  After that, I thought that would be the last we would see of the Mean Green Machine on the big screen for awhile.  But, Marvel wasn't ready to give up on one of their most famous characters soon announced plans for another Hulk film.  They promised that the movie would be a better film and would relaunch the character into cinema stardom.  The big wigs at Marvel believed in the project so much that they bet their future as an independent film company on it (IRON MAN was the other film that the studio hoped would turn them into a film studio of reckoning).  At first I was skeptical about the project, but then I learned Ed Norton had signed on to star as Bruce Banner and I felt better about the whole thing. The result is THE INCREDIBLE HULK: an action comic-book movie full of character development that stays true not only to the spirit of the original comic book, but the beloved 1970s television show as well as loosely connecting with 2003's HULK.<br /><br />The movie opens five years after HULK ended.  If viewers will remember, the movie ended with Bruce Banner (Eric Bana) living in South America.  He's (Edward Norton, now) still there and has been able to stay completely off the grid and below the radar, even though he has secretly been looking for a cure for his \\"disease\\".  Correspondence with a Mr. Blue in the United States have made him very hopeful and he plans to visit Mr. Blue in the near future.  However, those plans are thrown out of balance when the military, led by top soldier Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) and under the official command of Gen. Thaddeus Ross (William Hurt), discover Banner's location and seek to bring him in.  The confrontation is a disaster, Blonsky's troops are wiped out and Blonsky is critically injured.  Meanwhile, Banner escapes and finds his way to the U.S. to meet with the love of his life, Betty Ross, and attempts to locate Mr. Blue in hopes of eradicating the monster within.<br /><br />I really enjoyed THE INCREDIBLE HULK. It's not the best comic book/super hero movie ever made, but it is a good one and is just a very entertaining and exciting overall film.  The acting is superb, the special effects are great, there's just the right temperance of character development and action, etc.  The film does a superb job of synthesizing the previous incarnations of Hulk and uniting them together in a coherent whole that both geeks and casual film-goers alike can enjoy.Roth) and under the official command of Gen.

B001ED7C58|5.0|I am a huge fan of Stephenie Meyer.  I loved the Twilight Saga and, though I'm somewhat afraid of how the movie will turn out, I had to have the soundtrack.  I didn't know many of the artists so I didn't know if I would like all of the songs on here but I haven't been able to stop listening to it since I got it.  I love every song, especially Rob's 'Never Think'.  It's an amazing CD that I would definately recommend to any and every Twilight fan.
031606792X|3.0|I read all 4 books within a week. I was hooked with Twilight, just loved it and read it in one day. The next two where also quite good. Breaking dawn is not really bad, but it's a little long. Edward is agony most of the book, and there are hardly any itimate scenes between Edward and Bella. I liked when Stephenie described how they felt when they touched each other. And another part I really didn't like was this huge amount of words about the pregnancy. That part is really, really long and kind of boring. From the first moment I read about her pregancy, I already knew she would give birth to the child, so no need for all that speculations in the middle.   I read a few reviews who don't like the book because of the \\"teenage pregnancy\\". Hey, she is 19 and married, what's the problem???? Bella is very mature for her age, and Edward is 100 years old, no man needs more preperation time to be able to take care for a family.   I like the happy ending, and also the idea that there are still some open ends where new books could follow.
B001GAOY5U|5.0|I know a little bit about 3-D and 'Journey' is the the best I've seen for current home systems. Using colored lenses that use tints that are more 'opposite on the color wheel; the picture seperates better. Not perfect, but better than most and of course the picture neutralizes; but you got a 3-D movie in the house!<br />The Dolby track needs to be turned up to compensate for the lack of HD track as there are a lot of 3-D sound effects that whooosh, click or boom with the film. The story is perfect for a light adventure; but it is best enjoyed in 3-D. It's like a rollercoaster ride on your couch.
0930289234|5.0|I am very impressed with this book.  I was a little skeptical, but thought I'd give it a chance on the recommendation of some friends.  It has ended up being one of my favorite books of all time.  I thought it would be shallow, transparent, cliche characters...  I could not have been more wrong.  This is a wonderful story, expertly told, through a medium I had never experienced before.  Bought it on Sunday, finished it on Thursday.  I can't say how impressed I am with it.  If you think you have to be a comic-book reader to buy this, you're definately wrong.  Now I just need to know another book like this to read!
B00129H7VS|5.0|Absolutely stunning, it is one of the best movies ever done! The sound and picture from the Blu-ray edition is incredible. Packaging is first rate. Thank you for the DTS-HD MA!!!!
B001DU8T6S|4.0|I have to admit that I'm more of a Paul Rodgers fan than a Queen fan, but I've always loved Queen's music, too. Queen die-hards may not like this, but to me it's almost like a Paul Rodgers solo album with a killer backing band. The songs are great, and Paul's voice is still incredible after all these years!
B001GQSY64|5.0|While the story line may or may not suit your taste, you have to admit that the picture quality and sound quality are reference quality! I was blown away by the picture and sound. I liked this much better than the cartoon version!
0446579939|1.0|I am a huge Nicholas Sparks fan. I have all of his books and normally find him to be a wonderful writer. I was very excited to get my new copy of The Lucky One. I have to say once I started reading the book, I really couldn't get into it. The Lucky One was based on a good plot however seemed to be poorly written and predictable. It did not keep me interested at all. Through most of the book I was very bored and thought about not finishing it but I kept trudging and finally finished the book. It was not worth the time and effort I put into reading it.
B000A88EVE|5.0|The Man Who Fell to Earth from 1976 is a very original movie. The basic story is about an alien (David Bowie) stranded on Earth who is longing for his home planet. I don't think more should be said about the plot and so on, it's best to view this remarkable and unpredictable film not knowing too much in advance. Let it be said that there are several possible interpretations and some ambiguities, and that alienation is a central theme.  Personally I find this almost two and a half hour long movie totally captivating. The transfer of the Criterion edition is fantastic, and it is good to see a movie not about the 70s but actually made in the 70s with picture quality as good as new. There's a commentary track, several intreviews and a booklet. And Criterion even puts in  Walter Tevis novel which the film is based on! After seeing the movie I will get on with the novel right away.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|A friend recommended this.  We watched and didn't even know it was a series until our friend told us.  After that, we had to watch the series.  The series is good, but the movie is even better.  It's full of action, adventure and a few twists.  You'll find the characters likeable and you'll find yourself rooting for them.  Watch it, you will not be disappointed, even if you are not a sci-fi fan.
B000F0UV0E|5.0|This album has staying power, is a thinking-person's album, sounds great, has terrific lyrics, is well thought out, and basically makes everything else I listen to sound downright crappy.  Buy it and listen the heck outta it.  I listen to all genres of rock.  There is simply nothing better than this album.  BTW if you don't like country music, which I don't, you will still like this album.
B001ED7C58|2.0|I like it if they had THE MUSE songs used to make the first book; that would have been better... darker.  Stephenie Meyers playlist was a tad better.  I didn't like \\"decode.\\" It's like one of the those things that people just put together in the last minute, took one look at  and said \\"i think that's good enough,\\"  but they didn't really put much thought into it.  Where's the passion, man?  Come on.  I heard the person who chose the songs, did the sountracks for Grey's Anatomy also.  Ummm... just because both are set in Washington, doesn't mean they're the same.  I've lost faith this year on this franchise, really.
B001EN71DG|5.0|The original versions which are the bonus disk in every single one of the in this box set when watched Episodes 1-6 in the correct order, your better off watching the 2004 special editions that are the main feature because parts of the back story changed when seen in the Episode 3 during Patmie's funeral, they have done something to her body to make it look as if the \\"baby\\" died with her. Giving off the apperance that Anikan's son was dead along with wife, the Sith never look for them. They don't even know that Luke Skywalker is the son of Anikan Skywalker aka Darth Vader until that scene in Episode 5 when the emporor contacts Vader and if you have seen the unaltered versions and compare it to the new 2004 Speical Edition, the emporor is dum-founded that Anikan's son survived and that they where both decived by the Rebelian.    If your going to just watch episodes 4-6 then just watch the unaltered versions, but if you want to watch all 1-6, aside from Gretto shooting first and Jabba the Hutt, you'll be missing alot if you watch the Prequels then the original versions.    I can't wait until all 6 episodes are on Blu-Ray because when that time comes, maybe the original releases will be given the right level of attention that they haven't had since 1995.

B001JRYH2K|5.0|Amazon, are you demented?  Why in the name of Show Business do you list the cast alphabetically for films?  Streisand co-wrote, directed and produced this picture and she already got snubbed by Hollywood for her troubles -- do you have to add insult to injury?  It's OK in the long run, I guess, since she gets the credit for this delicate, poetic triumph.      Apologies, Mr. Barnett, but I doubt you even thought you were the star of this picture.
0375836675|4.0|I suppose I was looking to be blown away I as I was with the Book Thief.<br />Although this was a fine novel with a great mystery to keep me turning the pages, I found some of the writing sytle and language hard to get through. The main character grew on me and I really came to love him for his strengths and weaknesses.
B001HC8516|5.0|If you have ever dated anyone, or ever plan to date anyone, this is a must read!! This book completely changed how I look at men and relationships. It made me realize that when I allowed men to be in my life who were clearly sending me the signals that I was not important to them I was really telling myself \\"You don't deserve to be treated well\\". This is a book you will want to share with all you friends because once you have read it, YOU will never look at men and relationships the same way again.
0312370849|4.0|Not only was this a moving novel with great imagery and a satisfying twist, but the history learned about the Jews in France was quite interesting.<br />This book touched on the Holocaust in a round about way that made you feel the pain with out the horrific graphics that accompany so many books of this sort.<br />I'll definitely look for this author in the future.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I consider myself somewhat of a movie buff; from Weimar Germany to Eastern European to Bollywood cinema, I've seen my share of emotional, intellectual and esoteric tributes to that blessed, cursed, ever-scrutinized human emotion we call love.  This is one of the few films that I feel truly captures the feeling of regret and desperation contemplating what could have been.  The chemistry between Winslet and Carrey is not particularly organic, but then again their rocky relationship is what's driving the plot, and it more than works in this instance.  I feel some viewers might have lost something being stuck on Carrey's more comedic roles, but here he fit the bill perfectly for an awkward, emotionally closed man struggling first to react to Clementine's forwardness, then fighting to retain his memories of their relationship (not in chronological order, but in the order in which they were presented in the film).  A truly first-rate and beautiful movie.

B001C4AFP8|3.0|These days, Ridley Scott's brand as a director is such that when you go to see a film of his, there tend to be certain expectations ranging from story to action to screenplay. When the trailer came out, i had very high expectations for this movie. I wouldn't say i was sorely disappointed but it was a bit of letdown.<br /><br />'Body of Lies' stars Leo dicap as Roger Ferris, a CIA counter-terrorist agent based in Jordan. Russell Crowe as a manipulative and sometimes not entirely well meaning senior head at CIA who is Dicaprio's supervisor.<br /><br />The movie has the trademark Ridley Scott touch to it, in terms of action, cinematography etc. But there are a lot of holes in the script that come of as a letdown. The sudden need of a love interest for Dicap's character is pretty out of place in the story and if you ask me, is not warranted in the least.<br /><br />My highlights in the film would be Russel Crowe's character which is a complete diff from his usual persona and he seems to have added a few pounds for this role (similar to Stallone in Copland) , the other would be a solid performance by Mark Strong, who plays Hanni Salaam (pasha) head of Jordan's secret service and who plays a key role in Leo Dicap's character being based in Jordan and his work there.<br /><br />The movie reinvents the same whole concept and dangerously gets into the stereotype of Arabs and the subsequent influence of terrorism from the middle east.<br /><br />3 Stars. This movie would have been a classic had it a more cohesive and tight script.

B001FBSMW6|4.0|My journey with Keane started when I heard Everybody's Changing on the radio and I immediately demanded to know what sort of band could make such a beautiful song. I quickly found out it was Keane and I promptly went out and purchased Hopes and Fears. After playing that album from start to finish over and over again, I began to develop an appetite for some new music from them. After a long wait (in my mind), Keane finally released their follow up effort Under The Iron Sea. I purchased it on the release date, went home and popped it into the player. I was greeted by Atlantic, one of the most haunting, beautiful songs I've ever heard. I actually replayed the lead track about 5 times before I went on to the rest of the album (which was utterly fantastic, start to finish).    In my opinion, Keane took far too much time between discs. I was wondering when they would release another album. I read about the trials and tribulations online regarding the band members and hoped and prayed that Tim and the guys would pull it together to release another disc.    Well, they did. And here we are with Perfect Symmetry. This album clearly demonstrates the natural progression a talented group makes while developing through their existence. It holds true to their roots while they experiment with new methods and techinques in writing new material. This is clearly evident within several tracks on the record, especially on Better Than This. It represents elements of the Keane we have all grown to know and love, but it also contains a sounds that is unfamiliar to what we have been exposed to. Tracks like this are very necessary in the natural development of the group, but ultimately keeps the disc from receiving 5 stars from me. In other words, they're breaking eggs to make omelets.    Don't get me wrong, this album contains numerous options for the fan who wants to hear the classic sound. They deliver that, plus an added new bonus to demonstrate their progression, in the title track. Allof the melodious harmonies, crafty lyrics and piano power chords (if such a beast exists) are all front and center here. No fan could turn this song away as the needle slips into the run-out groove.    I read another review here that compared You Don't See Me to U2. I actually got chills as I read that because that's EXACTLY what I thought when I heard the first piano notes in the song. I thought to myself, \\"Damn, this is not far off of what U2 has done.\\"     It's not U2, though. I've played it for many other people, most with somewhat of a music ear, and none were able to draw that connection at all. But it's there. That's not to say they're ripping off U2. It's to say that this band is approaching that level. Not by popularity, but by  musical abilities.    In a nutshell, this is fine release by a fine band. It's not a slam dunk from start to finish like their two previous efforts, but the songs are very strong as the band continues to trek towards legendary status. In my opinion, they have not recorded a bad song yet. However, due to the explorative aspect of this disc, I rate this album at 4 stars with my guarantee that they have taken a mandatory step back in order to make a ridiculously giant leap forward.    Buy this album. Enjoy this album. But please don't make this album your initial exposure to this wonderful, talented trio.
B001HTSCZI|4.0|I just finished watching `The Clone Wars' & to be honest it was pretty good. No it's not as good as the movies & it's not as intense as the Samurai Jack-esk `Clone Wars' shorts from 2003 but then again it's not supposed to be like ANY of those. It's like comparing apples to oranges.    ALSO keep in mind that Lucas is trying to broaden his appeal to kids with this movie's style & story telling as well as with the series on CTN so it's going to be, over all, a bit more simple in its execution but no less entertaining. Don't watch this expecting an Oscar performance. It is a CGI cartoon after all, how serious/critical are you supposed to take it? It has more of an Episode 2 feel to it, for me at least, but the action sequences are just as long, intense & still 'edgy' for a CGI cartoon. They flowed well & were non-stop action. Clone troopers got it pretty bad in this movie & the lightsaber duels left me wanting for more(longer duels, that is) but were pretty good for a CGI cartoon. It held my interest the whole time though the plot of helping the huts was a bit odd. The dialogue could have used a little help but what star wars movie couldn't? I wouldn't recommend buying this movie until you see it first but if you keep in mind what this movie is supposed to be/do & you don't take it as seriously as some, then you should have fun & you'll be just fine. Anakin's apprentice is there for the young girls as well as to be the little miss know-it-all pain in the butt for Anakin the way he was to Ben (it's called irony) so she may be a bit annoying for some out there (she's better in the TV series)...and who in this world isn't about money? There is a lot of story that can be told between episodes and he wants to tell it (whether is executed well or not). We all would do it too & you all know it.   `TCW' story line isn't a major one in the Star Wars universe. It feels more like a made for TV movie but it ultimately starts up the TV series so there is a longer broader story to set up here as well.     Simple, aims at a broader audience & still a fun watch, if only once, in my opinion.    I say rent it first, watch it for what it is & go from there.

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Many people find Michael Moore annoying and dislike his political point of view but this documentary is more about the people than anything else. Fact, millions don't have health coverage in one of the most riches countries in the world. Fact, people are dying while few get richer and richer and FACT, the goverment so far has done nothing to improve the situation thousands have to face every day with a lack of health insurance. Choosing between keeping your house or getting that urgent medical treatment is something that should never happen. This documentary is really touching because of the human stories. Although I honestly doubt prisoners in Guantanamo get the first class treatment depicted here. Good health and the best medical treatments are not a luxury only for the rich but a need and a right all americans should have. Well done Mr. Moore.
1594201927|3.0|Historian Niall Ferguson teaches economic history at Harvard so he certainly has credentials for a book like this.  While his historical knowledge is impressive his financial claims can seem a bit cavalier and broad-sweeping.<br /><br />Ferguson celebrates financiers as the source of modern wealth and prosperity.  He backs up his claim by a historical examination of the last 500 years.  This includes the Italians in the late Middle Ages, as well as the Dutch in the 17th century and Britain's empire success which he partially attributes to the establishment of the Bank of England in 1694.<br /><br />After setting the historical context Ferguson becomes a pundit on the current global situation.  Commenting on those who speculate in the financial markets today Ferguson writes, \\"When people have a run of luck, they very quickly impute this to their own brilliance. Once you start interpreting your good fortune as your skill, you're very quickly a master of the universe who can never fall. That, of course, is precisely when you fall.\\"  He likens financiers to gamblers, which may not be a completely fair connection.  Of course there is risk involved in investing, but the primary concern in the financial world is how to limit that risk, react wisely, and be patient.<br /><br />As Ferguson considers the financial crises his assessment is neither overly positive nor calamitous. \\"Before this crisis,\\" Ferguson says, \\"there were people who thought there would never be another recession--that kind of crazy, myopic, unhistorical belief. That was followed in the last month or so by wild panic, as if it's the end of the world.\\"<br /><br />Ferguson states the obvious when he declares we will all be affected by the current financial mess, and that it will take a while for the market to correct itself.<br /><br />In short, if you like history more than finance, this is going to be an enjoyable book for you.  However, if it's the other way around the details might be suffocating.
B000056Q81|5.0|Fantastic songs (especially disc 2) by the amazing Francoise Hardy.  Her writing and voice are pure like snow and America only had the Kapp  records subsidiary \\"4 Corners\\" to market her music.   They failed miserably at getting her to our attention. They fared a bit better with Raymond LaFevre and his great cover version of Soul Coaxing (Ame Caline).  This CD is a must buy as a start to introduce this interesting facet of 60's pop music that possibly influenced Marc Bolin and other Radio Caroline listeners. Get it!!!    Audio quality is compressed but bearable.

B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Firstly, I will state that I am quite biased when it comes to Enya.  I absolutely fell in love with her soothing melodies when I heard \\"Only Time\\" years ago, since then I have purchased virtually every album she has.  That said - this album is WONDERFUL.  I was a bit disappointed when I discovered her new album was Christmas, but as soon as I popped it into my CD player all was forgotten.  Each song is beautifully written and orcistrated, there are only two traditional Christmas songs, so the album does not have a purely Christmas feel to it.  I was extremely pleased to hear both some new sounds (she plays an electric guitar in My! My! How Time Flies, at least I think it's this track) and a return to her pre-Amarantine style.  I think some of the music on this cd is her best ever, if you like Enya you will LOVE \\"And Winter Came.\\"
B001JOIEZ4|1.0|I am extremely disappointed with the music for the movie. Not that i expected too much anyway. Once Hollywood gets ahold of something good, they always ruin it. The only songs that stood out for me were Decode by Paramore and the Linkin Park song. I feel that they are good for Bella's feelings during the story. All of the other songs are too cheerful or upbeat for a movie like this. I am not gonna waste my money on this album. I am only going to download the paramore song. Bella's lullaby was horrible. Hopefully next time it will be better.
1416575464|5.0|domino: The Book of Decorating is subtitled \\"a room-by-room guide to creating a home that makes you happy\\".<br />If you have never set up a home space before, you can use this book as an all encompassing workbook. Simply proceed chapter by chapter and you will be supplied with options from which to choose, and tips for choosing among them.<br />Collecting, mixing and matching, how to get premium function from minimal space, furniture, practical decor and tricks for renters, when I say all encompassing, I'm not falling victim to hyperbole.<br />It's a plus that the book is basically organized room by room, rather than into overall style sections. That makes it super easy if you only want to look at ideas for bedrooms, a home office, etc.<br />If you are experienced at creating a home from a house (or apt.) you will still love checking out the abundant detail found in the multitude of photographs, each with its own tip, technique, or revelation box. Even avid readers of Domino will appreciate the further consideration of<br />set-ups they may have seen in issues of the magazine, and there are definitely legions of us who never saw all the issues. This book would make an excellent gift for anyone moving into a new house or redecorating their old.
B001EN71CW|4.0|Only caught the series AFTER it was canceled, and have become a browncoat, to the point that, yes, I actually do wear a brown coat I bought when Serenity came out. It's a series worth checking out. The chances you'll become that much of a nerd are very low, so don't be afraid. :)    Picture quality is high compared to the original DVDs, detailed and clearer, though since the series is fairly dark at points, there's some definite noise (looks like film grain, actually) in the black backgrounds (at least on my set, a Mitsubishi). Despite initial rumors, special effects sequences remain at 480i (upconverted) instead of being re-rendered to 1080p. That's occasionally annoying if you're looking for it, but otherwise not. Sound is greatly improved.    As others have pointed out, the set is shy on new extras, which is too bad. Enjoyed the extra commentary and the partial reunion, would have appreciated more.    Packaging seems decent for a blu-ray multipack. One review complains about the packaging, but I found it efficient and not problematic (case opens with one middle piece. Middle piece has a disc on each side, third disc is on the back of the open case.  I've seen worse: some mass-DVD multipacks with two dvds overlapping each other so you have to remove one to get at the other...)    Worth the money if you have a good HD set. If you're not sure, rent the first episodes from Netflix or Blockbuster.
0440238153|1.0|Okay, I have to admit that I'm not the greatest fan of the series; Pullman has an axe to grind, and hearing someone grind an axe in narrative is painful (see Atlas Shrugged).  However, I really have to say that especially the second book was well written.  There was a focus and narrative drive that made it probably the most coherent of the books.  Along with this, the characters are most developed in the second volume.<br /><br />And then we get to The Amber Spyglass.  First off, the name of the book comes from an item that barely factors into the story, and if then, only near the end and tangentally.  Certainly not items like the Alethiometer and the Subtle Knife that actually have a plot centered around them (Yes, I know that The Golden Compass was Northern Lights in the UK).  It was as if Pullman decided that he needed to continue the pattern of an object being central to the story, but just couldn't figure out how, so he just shoved something in there.<br /><br />And shoved something in there is something that you'll hear a lot of in this book, especially as far as theology goes.  So many times you have Pullman take snipes at religion in the weirdest places.  When Mary is having this amazing experience that she's only had before, Pullman has to add that the experience was not of her taking her vows as a nun.  When Father Gomez thinks of evangelizing to the mulefa, he thinks he has to first abolish the \\"Satanic\\" seed-wheels, ignoring that the Catholic Church has been one of the greatest co-opters of \\"satanic\\" rituals, holidays, and lifestyles that the world has known (Jesuits taught that Confucious was a proto-Christian like Aristotle when evangelizing in China).  There are dozens of places like this when it just became too much to not take a swipe at religion and Pullman just shoves a odd remark like that in there that makes the reader go \\"WTF?\\"  In fact, pretty much any religous person is portrayed as a crazed zealot, certainly not the characterization that he imbues most of his other characters with.  Even if he wants to write a novel about \\"killing God\\", you can't make the antagonists and the side characters so simplisticly bad that you wouldn't believe most of these people exist.<br /><br />And then comes Mary.  Mary is usually portrayed as an interesting character: her work, her observations, her life.  Every so often however, you just get her turning into the mouth of Pullman about how evil the Church is.  Her speech near the end about how God doesn't exist because she felt love was mind-boggling bad-- and worse, it didn't sound like something the Mary that we had started to get to know.  She basically says that God doesn't exist because no God would want her to not indulge her senses in love, ignoring for the fact that monastic (and celebate) life is a vocation that isn't for most!  In addition, Pullman's view of love is mere sensuality (not bad, but certainly not the high love that it's protrayed to be) so it becomes pitted against the life of contemplation.  This takes another swipe when the harpies are allowed to torment those that haven't lived lives with enough stories.<br /><br />Tacked on to all of that is a plot that comes crashing down with multiple characters doing things that and saying things that make no sense: Lyra never makes reference to Asriel killing Roger (and she always uses the passive tense with his death), Will Parry breaking his promise without much fanfare, multiple characters just showing up and then leaving, the love of two people healing the cosmos (uh, what?), Lord Asriel lying about destroying dust, Coulter shifting in such a way to be unbeleivable (remember her first reaction when she found out Lyra was to be the new Eve), and generally everything as it collapses into a gigantic mess.<br /><br />Oddly enough, Pullman falls into the same trap as C.S. Lewis (who's work he hates) when trying to tie everything up.  However, let it be said that at least Lewis respect his opposition more ashe was an atheist for quite awhile.  Hell, I'm not even a theist here, but I find Pullman's hashing plot about killing God as clumsy.<br /><br />And in the end, that's what this book ends up being: clumsy.l, I'm not even a theist here, but I find Pullman's hashing plot about killing God as clumsy.    And in the end, that's what this book ends up being: clumsy.

1595141979|5.0|The third book in the Vampire Academy series has everything and more that a reader expects in a Paranormal Young Adult series. In Shadow Kiss, characters develop, relationships are tested, and the plot is fleshed-out and brings out the brilliancy of Mead's careful planning from the previous two novels, and we also see clues and foreshadowing for whatever's next in the series. I can truthfully say that this is perhaps the most developed and well-structured book of the series.<br /><br />To begin, the protagonist Rose is dealing with the events that happened only a few weeks back with the Strigoi. Though time has helped heal some of the wounds, she is clearly still affected by events of the past, which leads to a darker change in her personality that we have never seen before, along with new features that seem to come with her being \\"shadow-kissed\\". As usual, she is snarky and portrays some immature qualities of a teen, but has already grasped some important aspects of adulthood.<br /><br />Her relationship with Lissa begins to change slightly as well, and we see less of her in this book as Rose is not guarding her for her field training. We get to see more development and rise of Christian and Adrian as main characters, as well as Eddie and the queen as secondary ones. Lissa's bond with Rose is beginning to show more negative aspects, and Rose carries an even larger weight with being Lissa's guardian, something that she is beginning to resent.  And of course, there is Rose's relationship with Dimitri, which expands even further in this novel after steadily increasing in the first two books. Whether they can resist each other and stay on the `right' path will be determined in this book.<br /><br />The plot builds up quietly, steadily gaining speed until the climax, which will leave readers clutching their books with tension and speed through the pages with eagerness to see what happens next. The ending is heart wrenching and emotionally draining, yet the emotions of the scene are so powerful that it will leave everyone feeling Rose's loss and impatient to get their hands on the next book.ful that it will leave everyone feeling Rose's loss and impatient to get their hands on the next book.
1594201749|5.0|John Carlin's work is a thrilling, spine-tingling effort.  Most of the book's protagonists can't recall their meetings with Nelson Mandela in regards to 1995's Rugby World Cup without breaking into tears.  Carlin's genius is to make you see why this is the natural reaction.  Here's a man who, as one player aptly puts it \\"spent 27 years in prison and came out with love and friendship.  All that washed over me, that huge realization, and the tears just rolled down my face.\\"<br /><br />Though Mandela is as close as there is to a god walking this earth, it's his one-on-one people skills that take the day.  His will is to win them over, one person at a time.  That's why Clint Eastwood has named his upcoming film of this book \\"The Human Factor\\" (Morgan Freeman as Mandela, Matt Damon as Springbok captain Francois Pienaar).
1416562605|2.0|the topic the book takes is an interesting one. in the initial portions are very well written and interesting. however, the book loses its way in the later parts and it becomes totally pointless. thre is no rationale for the protagonist to murder his employer and then run away. He even ends up becoming a successful businessman and totally gives a slip to the police!!    The book instead is confused and ends up being a good plot and idea with a very poor ending
0765316897|5.0|Fantasy lovers looking for something a little different, but still solid, cannot go wrong with this series. All three books were masterfully done, and Sanderson is a genius world builder.  The thought and science behind the magic of \\"Allomancy\\" is as well-crafted as the intricate languages that Tolkien brought to the Lord of the Rings.<br /><br />One of my problems with the second book, the mildly annoying romance between Elend and Vin, vanished in this book. For one, there was just no time for miscommunication and young love (what with the world ending and all). For two, the couple had grown beyond that point into something much better.<br /><br />I was worried that the \\"twists\\" promised to me and \\"seemingly insignificant details from the first books coming into play\\" would be lame or letdowns, but they were not...not at all. You will never guess  what any of the little signs or seeming inconsistencies will lead to. This book really did have me guessing until the end, something so often promised and so rarely delivered.<br /><br />I'm crossing my fingers this gets picked up by a production company. With ash-spewing volcanoes, sentient mists and a barren, dying landscape, it will be a visual director's dream.  And I don't want to give away any spoilers, but oh-my-god the ending! Squee!<br /><br />Sometimes I felt the story buckled a bit under the weight of its own intricacies and complications. Metal spikes, mind control, who controls who through what power based on who is insane and who has strong sense of will but is impaled by too many spikes but not enough Bronze to the power of pi.  I mean, it all makes /sense/ in the end, but it's arguably a bit much at times.<br /><br />The themes of the book: faith, trust, and the power of love and humanity vs. the power of hate and destruction, are not new, but I appreciated Sanderson's take on faith especially. I am not, whatsoever, a religious person, so I'm a hard sell on books that rely on faith as a plot device, but it works here because Sanderson has the intelligence to use it subtly.  This might seem an odd thing to say since, as I pointed out, it is a theme of the books and is discussed extensively in this one, but it's the questioning of faith and the debate of different faiths versus the absolute \\"truth\\" that fuels the voyage to the end, not a character's 500-page fanatical, fundamentalist insistence that \\"something\\" would take care of him, and that /his/ version of that something is the only something.<br /><br />There was very little left up in the air at the end, save for one specific detail. I wonder if that was just an eternal question left for readers, or if it means Sanderson plans to return to this world again. Whatever his plans for the future, I look forward to his next novel.the intelligence to use it subtly.

0312427573|4.0|I picked this book up on the recommendation of strangers who said that it was one of those must read American novels.  I'm always leery of these recommendations as they Ayn Rand usually appears on them and as a someone once told me \\"Friends don't let friends read Ayn Rand\\".  This was a surprisingly good book, I can't say how accurately it portrays New York City in the late 80's early 90's but it feels real, and the tensions and issues it deals with (race/class inequalities, the purpose of wealth) are ones we've yet to overcome or even recognize they need to be dealt with... Highly recommended.
B0019X3YXM|2.0|I guess seeing a cute blonde who passes out from too much alchohol and getting rides home from various strange men with various intentions might be someone's idea of a good idea for a film.  I suppose that having a cute blonde go after a guy because he reminds her so much of her fiance could be exciting.  I't even possible that a fairly intelligent college student could throw away his dreams as this cute little blonde draws him in to all her bizarre behavior.  A group of us watched this movie together and the concensus was unanimous:  This is one bad movie.  At 95 minutes, it was about 65 minutes too long.  The set up was horrible, the plot was tedious and absolutely impossible and the characters weren't even that likable.  As much as I like Elisha Cuthbert, I cannot recommend this film at any level.  Cute though she might be, this film is one to pass on.  Several of us regret the hour and a half we spent suffering thorugh 'MY SASSY GIRL'.

1595141979|5.0|I love this series! I love the fact that this book was longer, and allowed me to be immersed in Rose's thoughts and world for more pages. I enjoy the fact it is told from her POV. Her tone is totally honest yet sometimes snarky and sarcastic.<br /><br />There is a lot going on in this book. The nature of Rose and Lissa's shadowkissed relationship is explored. Also Rose and Dmitri's relationship progesses. IMHO there is less smoldering tension, and more openess towards the fact they love each other. Dmitri was tender, emotional and loving in his behaviour to Rose. I love him!<br /><br />The other characters- Eddie, Christian, and Adrian are fleshed out and provide a nice supporting cast.<br /><br />As other readers mentioned the cliff hanger ending leaves me panting for more. Richelle is such a prolific writer hopefully we will get another installment of this wonderful series soon!

B00005JN8Z|3.0|It bares repeating that this film was made before the invention of Cinemascope or any widescreen process.   So,  I don't want to hear anyone complaining about this being a \\"Full Screen Version\\".   That is the only way it can be viewed.   Also, even though Miklos Rozza's score is not as dramatic as Ben Hur, or any others he composed during this time period,  there is obvious similarities to Ben Hur.  Close to the end of the film, the march he used at the end of the Chariot Race of Ben Hur is exactly duplicated note for note.  Also, throughout the film, those with a good ear will notice other similarities to Ben Hur.

I think Mike adds a better element of intensity but overall it's a good follow up to The Oncoming Storm. Not sure where III fits in. Also, I think Buzz should do all of the soloing.

B001EYGOEM|5.0|Taylor Swift is back again with a new album with more great songs....  'Fearless' is about loving someone, and the best date ever  'Fifteen' is about well, being fifteen! and going through freshman year and being a teenager  'Love Story' is one of the greatest love songs ever written!! (if you haven't heard it... then... well, YOU SHOULD!) =)  'Hey Stephen' is about how a girl loves a boy and she's telling him why he should pick her over other girls...  'White Horse' is about a girl telling her boyfriend that they aren't living in a fairytale world  'You belong with me' is about a girl who wants to be with a guy but he's taken.... and how the girl is overshadowed by the popular girl  'Breathe' is about losing someone, but you have to go on without them  'Tell Me why' is about an abusive relationship  'You're not sorry' is about a guy telling the girl that he's sorry for the millionth time and the girl is finally saying \\"no, you're not sorry.\\" and walking away  'The way I loved you' is about missing your ex-boyfriend, even though your current boyfriend is perfect  'Forever and Always' is the song that Taylor Swift wrote to her ex-boyfriend, Joe Jonas.  it's about how a boy said he'd love his girlfriend forever, but now it's all gone down the drain  'Best Day' is about how great you feel when you're with the people you love  'Change' is about a team or group that has been unsuccessful but keeps trying and eventually rises and dominates..... it was one of the songs in the AT&T olympics playlist      p.s. just like the first album, in the lyrics-cover, if you write out all the capitalized letters...... you'll decode a message    you should buy it!! teens like me will be able to relate to some of the songs and even if you're not a teenager you'll love Taylor Swift's wonderfully, beautifully written songs =)    and if you're not conviced by my pursuasive essay...... watch the video on the upper part of this page.... it really shows Taylor's passion about music and songwriting....... or just get the first album if you don't have it!!! or her EP Beautiful Eyes :)
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|\\"Mamma Mia,\\"a new romantic musical comedy of a film, arrives, bringing joy to many.  It is based on the stage play of the same name that was a major international hit, and, ultimately, on the internationally popular music, largely disco-style, of the 1970's Swedish group ABBA.  The film, which I'd have to guess mainly appeals to women, older women at that, is a product of women to some degree: written by Catherine Johnson, directed by Phyllida Lloyd.  And, as you might expect, it generally has not been popular with mainstream critics, particularly the male ones.<br /><br />The film is lovely to look at: it's set, as was the stage play, on one of those picturesque Greek islands; and the breathtaking exteriors were filmed on one of them.  Interiors, however, and the major setting, Villa Donna, the small resort owned by the major character, Donna Sheridan (Meryl Streep), supposedly on that Greek island, were filmed at Pinewood Studios, England.  Some critics have complained about the cinematography, but really, who can carp when it's showing such lovely views?  I also found it slightly too long; there was a hard-to-believe moment when I was a little tired of big, pull out all the stops, production numbers.<br /><br />The plot's simple enough, even silly, and downright illogical and unscientific.  Donna, who was a tribute performer back in her day - and ABBA's --largely doing their material, it appears, would be the first to tell you, as she labors in her only moderately successful little resort, that she's a reformed slut.  Her daughter, Sophie Sheridan (Amanda Seyfried), has, accordingly, never known her father.  And Sophie's getting married now to Sky (Dominic Cooper); she wants her father to give her away.  So she finds Mom's old diary, identifies the three most likely candidates, and sends them invites: apparently Donna was prescient enough to identify them in her diary not only by their full names, but by what would be their addresses twenty years later.  (Pity she didn't identify them by their DNA at the same time; her daughter would have been spared so much uncertainty.)  The three men show up: Sam Carmichael (Pierce Brosnan, former James Bond); Harry Bright (the dishy Colin Firth), and Bill Anderson (Stellan Skarsgard, generally considered to be a serious actor, and a good one.) Just to add to the fun, Donna's former singing partners show up too: Tanya (Christine Baranski, an American musical comedy and television performer) and Rosie (Julie Walters, a respected serious British actress).  Two of daughter Sophie's friends show up too, the movie's crazy for triads.<br /><br />Well, these performers have to sing, of course, those ABBA songs.  It was obviously no problem for Streep; she appears to be having a great time of it.  But then, she's that phenomenon that famed Broadway guru Hal Prince once highly praised, an actress that can sing: and I've seen her sing previously in [[ASIN:B000059XTI Postcards from the Edge]], and  [[ASIN:B000H6SXYM A Prairie Home Companion]], among other films.  Critics have complained that her \\"Winner Takes It All\\" is over baked; if they'd seen the stage show, as I have, they'd know that song functions as what Broadway calls \\"the 11 o'clock number.\\" That is, the song, near the end of the show that producers rely on to send the audience out humming, and recommending the entertainment to their friends.  It's supposed to be powerfully presented, guys.  Major complaints about Brosnan's voice, too: we can all agree he'll never be invited to the Metropolitan Opera, but, still, his voice is perfectly adequate to the task.  However, the critics have praised Walters' closing number, delivered as the mythical ancient \\"Fountain of Aphrodite,\\" which Donna's inn is supposedly built over, explodes during a minor earthquake.  Walters has a get up on the table, knock `em dead, shake your money maker classic here; and she deserves every syllable of praise she gets.<br /><br />Basically, despite the attractive andtalented young leads, the show functions as an evocative middle-aged romance, of which the media give us too few.  This one is really meant for people who were around at the time, dancing to ABBA; something for the girls, in particular: that would be the older girls now.  I've seen a TV documentary on ABBA, and all four of the quartet agreed: even while they were recording \\"Dancing Queen,\\" they knew it would be a monster hit.  And it was, and it is still.  My favorite scene: as the entire island apparently breaks into that song, a Greek farm woman, no longer young, carrying a heavy load of kindling on her head, thinks about it, decides there's time enough to carry kindling, sets it down and joins the dance.  Fellas: throughout life, most women are carrying heavy loads of kindling: and we enjoy the chance to set them down and dance.  As various people have said, life is short and death is long: and you'd better dance while you can, little man.  Little woman, too.  In fact, I've said it before and I'll say it again, Gloria Gaynor's monster, international disco hit, \\"I Will Survive,\\" functions as an anthem to current day women, well beyond the English-speaking world.  And any English-speaking woman who claims not to know it is a liar.<br /><br />To be sure, rock critics of the day always hated disco, and you still see the odd bumper sticker, \\"Disco Sucks.\\"  Why ever?  Well, having the biggest \\"cojones\\" was important to those largely male critics, and disco was loved, heavens, by gays.  And women, and quite ordinary people, who liked to dance.  And the songs said nothing whatever about the state of the world, or Euclidean geometry.  Seems to me many of today's movie critics hearken back to these guys.  However, very recently, I saw a newspaper article that said medical men had found that people delivering CPR (Cardio pulmonary resuscitation) to people with failing hearts were most successful doing it to the Bee Gees' seminal disco tune \\"Staying Alive.\\" It helped the rescuers even to be thinking the tune, or singing it to themselves, because, you see, the song has slightly more than 100 beats a minute, and so has the heart.  The medical men didn't know the reason, but I do. Because I once saw a documentary about the Australian group, the Bee Gees, generally considered the fathers of disco, who said that they took that beat from the Australian aborigines.

B0013ND30W|5.0|The bonus features are very interesting.  The addition of the standard DVD for van trips is a real bonus you should consider if you like BD and have the need for a copy for the road.

B0014DZ2VO|4.0|Quantam of Solace is an very good movie with a few major faults:    1) The action comes hot and heavy throughout the movie, but is sometimes so spectacular you lose what's going on, meaning you lose the actual action your supposedly enjoying.    2) It's a direct tie in with \\"Casino Royale\\", so do yourself a favor and watch that movie just before you go to the theater because they reference it a lot, and if your like me, and haven't seen that movie in years, this plot may lose you at times.
B0019KC4UE|5.0|In case anyone wants to buy this--as I did--for the Shepperton footage from 1973 (thus bypassing the $100 box set), be forwarned that the DVD is in PAL format only. Which means it should play fine on your computer or laptop, but not on a regular U.S. DVD player. The picture quality is so much better than any of the bootlegs I have seen, but the print they chose (from Italian TV) has lots of scratches on it. Still it's nice to actually SEE what the camera is pointed at. A definitive version of this classic performance is still yet to come, but this will work fine until then.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Come on people, get over it! This is Enya, not Madonna, who keeps reinventing herself and experimenting with new sounds. Why look and produce radically different music when you risk losing the very fan base that has made you such a beloved international music artist? The track \\"AND WINTER CAME\\" may be a \\"MIDNIGHT BLUE\\" rehash, but a nice-sounding one. \\"WHITE IS IN THE WINTER NIGHT\\" cannot be a more upbeat tune. The same can be said about \\"MY! MY! TIME FLIES,\\" with a surprising electric guitar solo uncharacteristic of Enya, still welcome. You see, she appears to be experimenting, but don't expect to throw an entire CD with a totally different feel and appeal to it. Why expect a \\"Shepherd Moons 2\\" or \\"The Memory of Trees 2\\" off of every album? Chill: pour a cup of tea (I don't drink coffee...hehe!), sit back, relax, and let Enya's beautiful voice take you through yet another journey of enchanting tunes.

B001KVZ6BG|5.0|There has already been some talk coming from Telluride that this film is set to be this year's 'Juno.' It does have the same distributor and it is set for the same release period, and for anyone who hears this buzz, they will definitely not be disappointed.    During the premiere of the final cut (in the words of director Danny Boyle) at the Toronto International Film Festival, the audience gave the film an incredibly enthusiastic response, and it went on to win the People's Choice Award. Boyle, who is sometimes called a British Richard Linklater for yet again surprising the audience with such diverse subject matter, worked his magic. He transcended genres and created a truly unique and energetic picture.    Just about every aspect of this film deserves merit, and above all it belongs to Boyle, who managed to assemble such a massive achievement. The score by A.R. Rahman, with contributions from M.I.A., perfectly accompanies the action on screen. Still, it is great enough to be listened to on its own. With India as a backdrop, Boyle and his cinematographer have composed some remarkable images. The acting is roundly impressive, especially coming from the younger cast, almost all of which has never acted before.    The film begins as Jamal (Skins' Dev Patel) is under interrogation by Mumbai police for cheating on India's version of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire, being only one question away from winning it all. As the inspector says, even doctors and lawyers cannot come close to the 20m rupee prize, and so Jamal, having grown up on the streets of Mumbai, cannot possibly know these things. As Jamal tries to avoid further torture, he begins to explain to the police how he knew each of the answers. Flashbacks present Jamal's boyhood and explain how he got to the show.    At the centre of his journey is his brother, Salim, and a girl, Latika, who is left a homeless orphan after an attack that took Jamal's mother as well. After running from a man who exploits the trio for labour, Jamal replays the incident when Latika left his life when she was unable to catch a moving train. His uncertainty of her fate on the streets of Mumbai and his intense desire to see his first and only love again lead him to the interrogation room where the film began.    Like 'Juno,' Slumdog Millionaire is by genre a comedy, but it becomes much more. The film asks questions about fate, righteousness, greed, and even urban sprawl. Above all, however, it asks about love in the face of the most dire obstacles, and if it can truly prosper. Jamal's story is a tragic and unfortunate one, but as seen through his eyes, it is still beautiful. The vast colour palate of India overwhelm any negative feelings, and Jamal's hope of finding and being with Latika overwhelm despair. For Jamal, 20m rupees isn't his prize. It would be nearly impossible for there to be five better pictures this year.

B001F2W4Y2|3.0|this cd is ok. the first 3 songs are pretty good. there is nothing stellar about the songs. they are what you would expect from this group---lots of great guitar and the same tired lyrics about genitalia and loose, hot women. none of the songs rise to the level of hits like thunderstruck or heatseeker except the opening track of rock and roll train. this was obviously a cash-in album for these guys, what with the wal-mart sponsorship and the formula music. it is really a shame. they obviously have unique talent. they could do something great in terms of a concept album or a rock opera but they probably won't with all the pressure to bring home the bacon and the pig and the whole farm. perhaps solo projects would be the way to go. acdc is playing it safe but who knows where the road will lead?
0547133510|3.0|A Bear Called Paddington, written by Michael Bond and illustrated by Peggy Fortnum, is a children's book, and the first in a series of books featuring the Paddington Bear character. This book is a collection of stories about Paddington, an anthropomorphized bear from Darkest Peru, who is well-mannered and well-intentioned, but bumbling and destructive. Indeed, Paddington is one of the archetypes of well-meaning-but-destructive humor characters, along with Amelia Bedelia, Inspector Clouseau, and so forth, and this type of character is one of the cornerstones of children's stories.<br /><br />Most of the plots and humor going on here arise because none of the characters, least of all the bear, is particularly quick on the uptake. This is the kind of thing that small children will no doubt find delightful, but adults may well be bored or irritated.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED to small children.

962634427X|4.0|It is believed that Jane Austen wrote many of her first works for the entertainment of her family and would read them aloud for their opinions and enjoyment. It is not hard to imagine that Northanger Abbey was presented to her family in this manner. The language and phrasing lends itself so freely to the spoken word almost like a stage play, that I was quite certain that an audio book would be a great enhancement to the text. Add to that the talent of a creative narrator and you have a great combination for several hours of entertainment ahead of you.<br /><br />I adore audio books and listen to them in the car during my commute to work.  It is a great time to tune out the traffic, clear my head, and get lost in a good story. When I decided that I wanted to listen to an audio version of Northanger Abbey I discovered that there were three new unabridged audio editions that had been produced in the last two years to choose from. The first Blackstone Audiobooks (2007) was read by Nadia May, the second by Tantor Media (2006) and read by Donada Peters, and the third by Naxos AudioBooks (2006) and read Juliet Stevenson. The first two readers appeared to be professional narrators specializing in the classics with a diverse range of authors, and the third Juliet Stevenson is a well known British stage and screen actress, whose performance as the acerbic Mrs. Elton in the 1996 movie adaptation of Jane Austen's novel Emma was so hilarious, that I knew she would be an excellent choice to read the novel with the extra bit of animation that I desired.<br /><br />Ms. Stevenson did not disappoint and far exceeded my expectations. She added just the right amount of irony and humor to the reading of Northanger Abbey that no one would be in doubt that it is a burlesque on the sensational Gothic fiction or other overly sentimental novels popular in Jane Austen's day. Her choice of characterizations was imaginative and captivating. Hearing her interpretation of the emptiness of Mrs. Allen and her frivolous distinction for fashion, Isabella Thorpe and her shallow endearments, and Henry Tilney with his knack for reading and adapting to different personalities with wit and charm, I have a deeper appreciation and understanding of the novel.ivolous distinction for fashion, Isabella Thorpe and her shallow endearments, and Henry Tilney with his knack for reading and adapting to different personalities with wit and charm, I have a deeper appreciation and understanding of the novel.
B0000009SI|5.0|Frank Zappa.  No one can come close to paralleling this man's boundless genius as one listens to 'Apostrophe.'  Frank was not only a skilled musician, but an amazing lyricist who wound his lyrics into his songs; all of which make infinite sense to the listener.  From \\"Don't Eat the Yellow Snow\\" all the way down to \\"Stink-Foot\\", Frank uses his mental prowess of 'up north to down south' to make his work seem like a body of work, all of which makes the listener think, laugh, and appreciate how Frank goes out of his way to entertain you.<br /><br />Frank never tired of showing us new and delightful ways of entertaining the public listener.  If there was one other CD I would suggest that you buy of Frank's that is a must-listen, is 'One Size Fits All.'  There are many other works of Frank's that are very listener-friendly, but these two stand out above the rest, in my humble opinion.

0316143472|4.0|David Sedaris is without a doubt the most talented essayist in the country and the fact that he's also the most famous is not so much a validation of American taste as it is a validation of the Gevalia Kaffe/Sunday New York Times/All Things Considered/This American Life Podcast crowd. Good job!  They're good at picking humorists and squeezing African-Americans out of Harlem.<br /><br />Personally I prefer to read Sedaris than listen to audio tapes.  His voice, I think, actual detracts from the situations.  As in previous books When You Are Engulfed in Flames creates unbelievable, and in some instances unsympathetic, situations but Sedaris performs the literary magic trick of bringing you along for the ride.  His voice, however, is so specific that it detaches me from the opiatic experience of walking in this talented man's shoes.<br /><br />Also, as with previous essays, I believe he's at least 70% full of crap.  But who cares?  It's amusing crap.

You will fall completely in love with the characters, especially if you are somewhat afraid of being control by someone else! I could completely relate with the main character on how she did not want to be told what to do and how to live.  She was amazingly strong physically and just needed someone to show her how amazing she is mentally as well! Although the writing itself is not the best, the story and characters are! I defintely recommend reading this book!
B00197POXG|5.0|What a wonderful show!  I was not able to follow this show during it's regularly scheduled timeslot.  This complete series megaset has allowed me to enjoy all the shows. (Haven't finished watching them all yet). The value is great!  The presentation value is great.  I will enjoy these for as long as DVDs last.  My only concern is ... how difficult it is for me to get the DVDs out of the pockets.  Younger fingers won't have a problem.  That's why I'd like to give it 4 3/4 stars, but the system only allows whole stars.

0375826726|4.0|This book starts off almost exactly where Eldest left off.  Eragon has oaths to fufill and starts off by helping Roran StrongHammer.  The majority of this book is filled with going to the dwarves and intermissions inbetween.  Towards the end the storyline picks up while leaving you wanting more.  This book felt like a placeholder- I can see why this book was split up in two books.  One,  to make more money,  and to leave a dramatic ending book with a marvelous conclusion.  If this is the case I am most pleased with Brisingr because it fit that role.  If this were to be a stand alone novel of the series,  400 pages of random adventures struggling to keep in line with overthrowing Galbatorix wouldn't reach the line of my expectations.    This book had more action scenes than eldest and that helped spice up the storyline a bit.  Roran was more deep and you actually didn't mind reading about him unlike in book one.      The one stand alone thing in Brisingr is further character development.  At one point,  I felt like I could see the characters.  They were so real to me.  They have flaws like humans but qualities that make you truely admire the character.      Paloni leaves some strings untied that will undoubtedly be resolved in the last book. [Interesting additions were added to the story line juicing it up even more.] Depending on how long those strings go and the quality of those strings turn out to be, will be an exicting adventure for all Eragon lovers.  Brisingr succesfully left me wanting to know the end,  and feeling a bit nostaligic thinking about everything Eragon has gone through and what he still has to accomplish.  (No spoilers but at some point in this book I think you will feel the same.)

B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I do not know what album many people who say that this album is just more of the same are listening to.  Of course, it is Enya, and it should sound like her, which it does, but the variation and breadth that the tracks on this CD cover is astounding.  I mean, electric guitar???  Since when does Enya use electric guitar?  Yet, it clearly works and it is still Enya.  From somber and liturgical, to lively and celebratory, this album captures the reflective feel of Christmas without being heavy.     As an Enya album it is excellent.  As a Christmas album it is outstanding.  I could say that all the tracks offer something to the listener and it would be true.  My My Time Flies has the feeling that it belongs in a musical, just VERY upbeat and distinctive.  Dreams are More Precious and Last Time by Moonlight are very typical yet beautiful Enya tracks.    If you are a fan, you already have it.  If you are looking for some new Christmas tunes because you are tired of the radio playing the same five songs in a loop over and over again, this is outstanding and you might find that you too love Enya.  But be warned that once you have crossed over, there is no going back.
B00005JPS8|5.0|I'd never seen Iron Man in Comic Book form, so his character was new to me.  Everyone plays their parts perfectly to such an extent that I can't picture anyone else playing them.  Story is totally cohesive and editing is fantastic.  Main sound effects seem to be either the booms of explosions, fights or Iron Man flying around.  Either way the bass effects are truly outstanding.  We just watched it for our first time and we both are looking forward to another viewing soon.    Mark Zimmerman, Chicago  -  Bipolar Bear

B00004XPPK|2.0|'Johnny' Farrell is a small-time gambler/card cheat who finds himself being robbed at gunpoint just after leaving a game of dice with some soldiers in Buenos Aires. A weird guy with a German accent, Ballin Mundson, just happens to be strolling along down by the docks and saves Johnny by whipping out a sharp knife hidden inside his cane. Thus begins the very strange and not all that entertaining pseudo-noir, 'Gilda'. Mundson hands Johnny his card and invites him to play at his casino. Before you know it, Mundson hires Johnny as the manager after Johnny convinces him that he can use his skills as a crooked gambler to ferret out customers bent on cheating the house. Mundson introduces Johnny to his wife, Gilda, played by Rita Hayworth. Gilda can't stand Mundson but obviously married him for his money.<br /><br />The only thing that is truly understandable in this movie is Gilda's disdain for Mundson who is continually trying to suck up to her acting like a besotted 16 year old wuss. Mundson's jealousy knows no bounds and it's this jealousy that defines his character--so much so that the character becomes totally one-note. There is so much of Mundson's jealousy we can take before saying, 'enough already'. Fortunately for the film-goer, Mundson disappears halfway through the movie, only to return at the end.<br /><br />Meanwhile, without providing any back story, Johnny and Gilda knew each other before. When they meet again they have a thorough disdain for one another. Johnny tells Gilda, \\"I hate you\\", Gilda tells Johnny, \\"I hate you\\" and one of them (or maybe both, I can't remember) slaps the other in the face. Like Mundson's jealousy, the disdain is unrelenting but at a certain point they declare their love for one another, end up in a passionate embrace and before you know it, get married. Finally, closet nice-guy Johnny starts morphing into Mundson (after Johnny takes over the casino following Mundson's apparent suicide, nose-diving his single pilot aircraft into the ocean)and becomes jealous of Gilda's new singles life. Gilda tells Johnny that dating other men is just an act for Johnny to pay more attention to her but Johnny won't buy it. He becomes so jealous that he has one of his henchmen at the casino physically remove every new date from Gilda's proximity causing her to flee to Montevideo where she meets a new man, a lawyer who convinces her to return home and get an annulment. When she returns, she finds out that her new boyfriend, the lawyer, was paid by Johnny to get her to return. Gilda is shattered when Johnny tells her that annulments are not legally valid in Buenos Aires (unfortunately Gilda is not a law school graduate!).<br /><br />Just like Mundson, Johnny's jealousy toward Gilda becomes tiresome. But unlike Mundson, Johnny's 'true feelings' toward Gilda cannot be kept down. He somehow realizes that he's been the biggest heel all along and once again falls for Gilda (please don't ask me what motivates these sudden reversals in the characters' behavior). Just as Johnny changes his mind about Gilda (again) Mundson returns and in a jealous rage attempts to murder both Johnny and Gilda. Mundson is struck down by the kindly bathroom attendant who presciently has referred to Johnny as a 'peasant' from the beginning of the film. The police inspector does his Captain Renault imitation from Casablanca by stepping in and hinting that Johnny and Gilda will not be charged for Mundson's death, that the official cause of death is still a suicide and not to matter anyway, it was a justifiable homicide.<br /><br />There is also a subplot in 'Gilda' that is just as confusing as the love triangle. Mundson has cornered the Tungsten market and double-crossed two Germans he knew during the War who show up at the Casino claiming they are the rightful leaders of a cartel. We never find out anything about the Germans except that Mundson ends up killing one of them and that's why he has to flee (oh there's another weird guy, a businessman who attempts to shoot Mundson at the casino after Mundson won't let him do business with a member of his cartel. The weird guy is unable to kill Mundson so he ends up shooting himself). As one poster aptly put it here, Gilda is a 'poor man's Casablanca'. In some ways, Gilda is so bad that it's actually somewhat entertaining. One can actually sit back and enjoy all the full blown histrionics. But ultimately none of the jealous machinations of the characters are ever sufficiently explained nor are the reversals--the odd changes of heart where the lovers are reconciled. Gilda is a story where the characters don't earn our respect--they're locked in a pointless battle simply designed to titillate the masses of people soon to become addicted to daytime soap operas on television in the 1950s.an who attempts to shoot Mundson at the casino after Mundson won't let him do business with a member of his cartel.

In some ways, Gilda is so bad that it's actually somewhat entertaining. One can actually sit back and enjoy all the full blown histrionics. But ultimately none of the jealous machinations of the characters are ever sufficiently explained nor are the reversals--the odd changes of heart where the lovers are reconciled.

1595141979|5.0|Shadow Kiss is a great addition to the Vampire Academy series, after the lackluster previous one in the series, Frostbite.  It is a fun, new and interesting take on vampires in general, and the writing and environment really work well together.  It could be said that this series (along with the Casts' House of Night series) are essentially 'Harry Potter/Hogwarts for Vampires', which is true to a certain degree, but both of these series have a decidedly more mature and horror-based (lots of blood) underpinnings, though they still have their humorous moments.    Anyway, you can't go wrong with this one!

B000BJS4SU|5.0|This should be called \\"Promise Kept\\"! At times it evokes BBK, the ABB, SRV, Bonnie Raitt, Johnny Lang, and more. But it's all John Mayer. I downloaded this last night and then bought the CD this morning. This grabbed me from the first song, and gave me shivers. First new CD to get me excited in a long time. If you like good blues rock guitar, don't hesitate. If you like his pop songs, I can't help you. If you ever wondered why EC invited John Mayer to the Crossroads Guitar Festival, this should put that to rest. In case you could not tell, I really liked this. This one is destined to get worn out in all my players. Nice....
0743270754|5.0|I have yet to read Doris Kearns Goodwins Book Titled, \\" The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln \\".  As one who has read the three volume tome of Shelby Foote on the Civil War from end to end, I need not find that subject covered in this book, and with the title, certainly would not expect to find such information.  I expect this book to supply details about the well documented, and often written about life of Our Greatest President, that others have overlooked.  I seek to learn from this book whether Lincoln's political genius offers us any lessons we can apply to the national politics of 2008. I offer this before I read, and return to write an actual review because I look forward to the experience, and wondered at the somewhat clueless reviews with one star on them that all missed the point of a book with this title, from such a talented author as Doris Kearns Goodwin has already proven herself to be.
B00006AW2M|5.0|An Imitation of Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band?  I don't think so at all.  It's obviously a departure from the normally bluesy flavor of the Stones, though the little bluesy guitar riffs melding so FREAKING perfectly with the keyboards is amazing.  I bought this album when it came out on vinyl, and to this day if I queue it up to listen to just one track I wind up restarting the album from the beginning and listening to it straight through.  Sure the intro and outro are a tad bit silly.  They're still attention grabbing and are part of the 10 course meal that assembles your pure and total enjoyment of this album.  The reprise of \\"On With The Show\\" is not redundant.  The way they can seamlessly swap the focus of the song around between guitars, keyboards and vocals in this song is astonishing. Eh ... I guess that is the case on just about almost every track on the album. Whereas I am a huge fan of the Stones (I still can't believe how incredible they are in the Scorcese documentary of their recent concert in 2006), this albun is truly a standout.  I suspect it will sound as new 20 years from now as it did back in 1967.  I *think* my favorite song as this album might be \\"The Lantern\\", but it's really hard to pick just one.

B001DSNELA|5.0|Casino Royale is the 21st official James Bond movie and the first in the series to star Daniel Craig as James Bond. It's based off the Ian Fleming novel and essentially reboots the franchise with 007's first major case, to bring down the terrorist banker Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen).<br /><br />Similar to what Batman Begins did for its franchise in 2005, Casino Royale takes a formulaic pop culture icon and makes him relevant and exciting again by bringing back the basics. I'm a huge Bond fan and I would've been happy with more Bond films in the vein of the Brosnan era, but this installment is like the breath of fresh air I didn't know I needed. Suddenly we have a James Bond that gets to develop as a real character, a beautiful love interest that really matters (Eva Green will go down among the best of the Bond girls), and action sequences that are intense and edgy without looking like they've been coated in the usual Hollywood gloss. This may be the 21st film in the franchise, but it stands on its own as a great movie and that's what makes Casino Royale work.<br /><br />The original 2-disc release was barren of any really relevant features, so while I usually avoid the double-dips, this was one Collector's Edition that was worth it. You get everything that was in the 2-disc set, plus a third disc loaded with deleted scenes and documentaries. Most interesting are a segment discussing the legal entanglements that kept EON Productions from making Casino Royale until now, and a documentary on the effects-heavy Venice finale.  Note the box lists a visual commentary by the producer/director, but the visual are only for the Blu-Ray edition.<br /><br />Blu-Ray or standard def, this edition of Casino Royale is worth owning.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|Strange title for a rock music review, but hear me out. Remember, most of my reviews are [a] albums by pretty blondes, and, [b] some really complicated books on side-issues in history. Any professional historian knows the truth of my title. I heard this record a couple of days ago, and was pleasantly surprised...the \\"rock\\" is not hard, except in spots. Plus, you can understand Pink's words; that's important to me, and rare in a rocker. I really like it. I find the girl pretty, in a tough sort of way, though I don't care for the nasal piercing, but to each her own. I've been thinking about it [easy with the cover], and I think I've got an idea, wrong though it may be....<br /><br />This is Carly Simon for the 21st. century. Hard-edged, with tattoos, and likes girls as well as guys. Still. Think about it...what do we know Carly for? [1] Sexy/sexual album covers, and [2] Wearing her heart on her sleeve about broken relationships and substance abuse. Well... OK, Carly never showed us THIS much flesh, but if \\"Boys in the Trees\\" and \\"Hotcakes\\" don't have sexual jacket covers, I don't know what does. Her best work came out of her break-up with James Taylor [and Sinatra's after Ava Gardner]. I understand that the present offering results from Pink's divorce. Shared pain. Confusion. Fabulous music.<br /><br />Let's talk specifics...\\"So What\\"...hard rock, but clear lyrics. Her man's gone, right from the opening line. Heck with him; she's still a rock star. \\"Sober\\". Good idea. The answer is not in drugs/alcohol, 'cause one day you find that you've lost you. \\"I Don't Believe You\\". FABULOUS song..softest rock you'll ever want. Her man was gone, and so what. Well...not so fast. \\"One Foot Wrong\\" Abuse. Carly never gave us that. Lot's of girls wrongly think the abuse they suffer is their own fault, but, sometimes, girls give out as well as take. \\"Please Don't Leave Me\\" even though I'm verbally abusive. \\"Bad Influence\\" Using alcohol to make another girl get flirty? Yeah, I'd say so. \\"Funhouse\\" The title cut, and I think, the source of the Parental Advisory. It's a great song and rocks hard...back to her busted marriage. They had a fun house, now she's gonna burn it down. \\"Crystal Ball\\"....\\"Mean\\"....\\"It's All Your Fault\\"....More pain, more alcohol, more mutually shared abuse, more get out/don't go.

031606792X|1.0|[*SPOILERS*]<br /><br />A couple of weeks ago, we hit the three month anniversary mark for the release of the much anticipated Breaking Dawn.<br /><br />Having read and loved the Twilight series early this year, I could not wait to read this book. Having finished the Harry Potter series the year before, I was no stranger to the life of a fandom that had to wait long months (and sometimes even years) for the release of a beloved book; the anticipation was enjoyable, even.<br /><br />But who would have thought that the anticipation would have been that much better than the book itself?<br /><br />While waiting for the book, I had come up with theories to pass the time; none of which included what actually happened. When a person would come to an Amazon thread posing the idea that Jacob might have imprinted on Bella, I immediately set them straight. And when another person might pose the possibility that Bella would get pregnant, I would laugh it off, because I knew that such a scenario was impossible.<br /><br />Sadly, I was wrong.<br /><br />I attended the Breaking Dawn Concert Series the night before Breaking Dawn was released. I was so thrilled to be meeting Stephenie Meyer - and to get her autograph. Yearning to be a future writer myself, I looked up to her, and was inspired by her words.<br /><br />On Saturday, August 2nd, I woke up early, unable to contain my excitment. I waited eagerly for Breaking Dawn to arrive at my doorstep, having been too tired to attend a midnight release party the night before.<br /><br />When the book finally arrived, I sped through it happily. The wedding between Bella and Edward was well composed; I even allowed myself to overlook the fact that there were already 2 instances of extreme OOC: Bella's mother and father reacting calmly to Bella's engagement.<br /><br />That should have been my first clue.<br /><br />It didn't take me long to read through the wedding, and then through the honeymoon night; scenes that had both been anticipated for 3 long books.<br /><br />And then I arrived at Chapter 7, and Bella was pregnant.<br /><br />I cannot begin to describe to you what was going through my mind at the time. I will say that I had to put the book down and walk away from it for a decent amount of time.<br /><br />The book got progressively worse from there, with half the book consisting of a dying Bella lying on the couch, oblivious to the fact that the moster inside of her would eventually kill her. Bella, the one who never cared about having kids. Bella, the one that was reluctant to even get married, because people would THINK she was pregnant, and that would mortify her.<br /><br />Edward was not much better; all we saw of him was the \\"burning man\\" that Jacob describes to us. Because of Bella's condition (and because we are in Jacob's POV), we do not get any of the beloved, romantic interaction between Bella and Edward that I had so desperately wanted...and I think it's safe to say that I wasn't the only one expecting so.<br /><br />The birth scene, for me, was digusting. I'm not sure what Meyer was thinking when she wrote this scene - especially considering she was told by her publishers to chop off an additional 50 pages. Hadn't this been the woman who did not want to write a sex scene, out of the fear of being too graphic? One would think that such a writer would not go along and write a scene with her main character throwing up a \\"fountain of blood\\", with her spine being snapped in half by her unborn baby, and the \\"special c-section\\" that her new husband must preform on her with his TEETH...<br /><br />Bella's transformation into a vampire did not make much sense as well; she was able to hold back her screaming, even though the pain from a bite on only her hand three books earlier was enough to have her going mad. Other than that, though, I was initally okay with the vampire Bella - mostly because I was hoping to salvage something from this book. I was even okay with Bella's controllableblood-lust.<br /><br />I was NOT okay with Charlie's reaction to her change. But then again, we had already had a taste of this new drugged-ultracalm-Charlie at the beginning of the book, hadn't we?<br /><br />And then we have Renesmee...or as Jacob so affectionately calls her, Nessie.<br /><br />Renesmee is, completely and utterly, a doll. Perfect in every sense of the word. Perfect enough to make you vomit. She is beautiful, she grows quickly, she doesn't cry at night (though her parents don't sleep, so that's just wondeful!)...<br /><br />Oh, wait. She has a craving for cups of human blood. How charming!<br /><br />Even worse was the fact that Jacob had imprinted on Renesmee. I had grown to respect his character in this book, and had desperately wanted him to find a girl on his own, without imprinting - merely because he hated the idea of not having any say in the matter. But Renesmee is born, and ZAP goes Jacob's free will...he's now doomed to love a Barbie for all of eternity, even though vampires are supposed to be a werewolf - sorry, a SHAPESHIFTER - 's worst enemy.<br /><br />The icing on the cake was the super exciting, thrilling, eventful battle between the Cullens and Co., and our newly dubbed shape-shifters. I mean, you can't possibly say that that was not a battle of epic proportions...the suspense, the action, the blood spill!<br /><br />Pysche. Instead we got a battle that was about as exciting as an infomercial for a cheese wheel.<br /><br />No, scratch that, I'd rather watch the infomercial.<br /><br />We get around 300 pages of garbage - garbage, because SM attempted to create a suspenseful build up to the supposed epic battle. We get a fistfuls of new characters thrown at us, only to have them turn out meaningless in the end. Really, what was the point? To teach Bella how to use her bubble shield? Yeah, no. Because of Bella's supergirl abilites, she probably could have mastered her powers simply by sitting on the ground and picking her nose.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on J.Jenks. I'm just not going to bother; his irrelevance to the entire plot speaks for itself.<br /><br />The Volturi's epic involvement was lame. In fact, I even fell asleep while reading it - granted, it was four in the morning, but still. I have never fallen asleep while reading a book...the only other time that that happened was when I was reading this book called the Host...but oh, that's for another time.<br /><br />So there you have it. I could really rant about how utterly disgraceful this book is for hours and hours and hours...but I suppose I've written enough to express the main problems that I have with it.<br /><br />OVERALL: Breaking Dawn fails.

B001PPLIFU|4.0|After witnessing the complete rebirth of the James Bond franchise at the hands of Martin Campbell's superbly crafted thrill-ride, \\"Casino Royale\\"; I looked forward with great anticipation for this year's follow-up \\"Quantum of Solace\\". Just like its predecessor, Daniel Craig once again portrays the famed Agent 007, alongside the always reliable Judi Dench as M; and continuing the basis of a more realistic James Bond there are still no gadgets to speak of, and James survives purely on his quick wit and fast-flying fists. So, does \\"Quantum of Solace\\" have what it takes to rival the film that came before it, or has this reinvigorated franchise already lost its momentum?    Beginning shortly after the events of \\"Casino Royale\\", James Bond (Daniel Craig) finds himself trying to quell the thirst for vengeance that is raging deep inside. With his one-time love, Vesper, now dead, James is using his resources within MI-6 to track down those responsible for her betrayal and ultimate death. As James searches desperately for answers, he stumbles upon a powerful threat that has been spreading right underneath MI-6's very nose; that of a mysterious group known as Quantum, led by a power hungry man named Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric). With M's trust in him waning, James must work alongside a mysterious young woman (Olga Kurylenko) to uncover what Quantum is all about and how significant of a threat they truly are before it is too late.    As the 22nd official James Bond movie in the franchises long lasting history, some could pose the question, \\"Is there any possible new ground to cover with this enduring character?\\" My answer would be... apparently so, because after watching \\"Quantum of Solace\\", there is more to this newest incarnation of James Bond than what we've been accustomed to over the last 40 some years.    The story for \\"Quantum of Solace\\", as written by Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis, and Robert Wade (the same team of writers that collaborated on the previous film \\"Casino Royale\\"), delivers to audiences a side of James Bond we have never truly seen unleashed before. What I am referring to is James' unbridled thirst for revenge. This facet of James' character pushed an already tougher, more brutal James Bond into even more violent territory, and even introduced the notion that perhaps 007 was going too far in performing his sworn duties. A truly interesting, and fresh approach to the character that perfectly coincides with the new direction this series is taking.    Along with a more violent James Bond, the introduction of a criminal organization such as Quantum was a very welcome surprise for me, as this may allow for the Bond franchise to begin linking its films together again to some degree, rather than having them be merely episodic in nature. Now, this is not to say that I want them to begin leaving massive cliffhangers at the ends of their movies (such as, \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\\" or \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\"), so that another film can come along and tie up all the loose ends. Not by any means. I just like the fact that we have this organization that could perhaps be used as a means of linking the villains Bond must face together; similar to the way the classic Bond movies used Blofeld (leader of the group known as SPECTRE) as the villain or at least backing the villain in many of the films. This wouldn't necessarily require audiences to see every James Bond movie that gets made in order to understand what's going on, in fact that would be detrimental to this franchises continued success (in my opinion); but this addition could be seen as a reward of sorts for those that have stuck with the franchise by providing a sense of continuity and a richer universe in which the character they love resides.    Some critics have panned this film for being too focused on Bond's need for revenge and that this incarnation of Bond is nowhere near as fun as his predecessors. They wonder where are all the gadgets, the quick quips,the double entendres, and so on and so forth. Personally, I think all of their complaints are ridiculous, and contradict the very reasons they cited for loving \\"Casino Royale\\" because it was more realistic in nature. I think the idea of having a more realistic James Bond than those that came before is exactly what this franchise needs to stay relevant in today's popular culture. When franchises such as the \\"Jason Bourne\\" series focuses on a seemingly real-life spy, the more outlandish that James Bond films become, the less audiences would relate to him; therefore the less appealing he would be as a character to the point that eventually he would just fade away in the shadow of a man with his same initials (Jason Bourne, for those not paying attention). If you are one of the people that enjoyed all the quick quips, gadgets, and sexual innuendos of the past, then you have 20 movies with which to fill your quota; and I admit I enjoy those kinds of James Bond films as well, but you have to face facts, that kind of 007 movie appears to be a thing of the past, and the realism of \\"Casino Royale\\" and \\"Quantum of Solace\\" is the future for this franchise.    The actors in \\"Quantum of Solace\\" all deliver terrific performances, a standard that has existed in every James Bond film that I have ever seen, and I'm sure was present even in the ones I haven't. Daniel Craig continues to prove himself to be the best Agent 007 in my opinion, no disrespect to Sean Connery, but Craig's version of Bond is how the character was meant to be. I thought Daniel did an excellent job of handling this even more aggressive Bond, as he accurately portrayed a man broken by his deep loss and guilt, and driven to payback those responsible. Judi Dench gives another perfect performance as the always proper, yet in your face M. Her loyalty to James, although it appears somewhat shaky at times in this film, and in all her other appearances even before this reboot, ultimately remains unwavering in the end.She tends to provide the calm sanity amidst the storm of Bond's typically chaotic methods of achieving his goals.    Also returning to the series are Giancarlo Giannini and Jeffrey Wright (both appeared in \\"Casino Royale\\"). I appreciated that both of these actors returned to reprise their roles from the previous film, even if they weren't featured all that heavily in this one; it is this sort of continuity that I enjoy in a film series. Joining the cast are foreign actors, Mathieu Amalric (\\"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\\") as the apparent leader of Quantum, Dominic Greene, and Olga Kurylenko (\\"Hitman\\"), as the newest Bond girl, Camille. I for one have not seen anything Mathieu has done, but from what I can tell he appears to be a very good actor and his performance here was nothing short of menacing much of the time. His villain fit in perfectly with the new direction this franchise has taken, as he was a very believable villain given the means he has at his disposal to accomplish his goals, and the methods he employs in doing so are realistic, and at times shocking. Olga Kurylenko surprised me with her performance, because based on her previous film, the video game adaptation \\"Hitman\\", I wasn't all that impressed by her acting prowess. However, any doubts I had about her talents, have been laid to rest, and like Vesper before her; Olga's character of Camille is from a very different mold than those other Bond girls in the previous 20 films.    After \\"Casino Royale\\" I didn't know if another James Bond movie could do any better. While I don't believe director Marc Forster's (\\"Monster's Ball\\") \\"Quantum of Solace\\" achieved the goal of toppling \\"Casino Royale\\" as the best Bond movie ever; regardless of what some of the critics may say, Marc did manage to provide a thoroughly engrossing follow-up film that does live up to its predecessor, and left me once again, anxiously awaiting the next installment.    In case you are curious, I mentioned earlier that there are 22official James Bond movies; although to be truthful, this is not entirely accurate. There are technically 23 James Bond movies; however, Sean Connery's last portrayal of the character in 1983's \\"Never Say Never Again\\" is not recognized in the official Bond canon, as it is essentially a remake of \\"Thunderball\\".    \\"Quantum of Solace\\" is rated PG-13 for violence, brief language, and sensuality.
B001EJIMUG|1.0|this is the second worst movie that I have ever watched. I never saw anything as boring as this is. What a waste of money
B001DHXT20|4.0|No longer weighed down by the angst and downright boring emotional drivel of the Ang Lee vision, \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" allows the big green angry guy to flex his muscles a bit more.  I'm sure there are some fans out there who enjoy their Hulk with tears and a blanket, but I believe that most fans really just want to see him smash and crash his way through everything.<br /><br />Edward Norton takes the purple pants from Eric Bana and gives us a more convincing portrayal, albeit in limited screentime, of Dr. Banner. Also in a limited role is William Hurt as General Thunderbolt Ross.  While he does a sufficient job, a part of me longed to see Sam Elliott back in the role.  Tim Roth provides the film with a villain in the form of Blonksy.  Liv Tyler takes on Betty Ross, but, as with the rest of the actors in this film, has limited screentime compared to the big green one.<br /><br />The story finds our hero (Norton) hiding out in South America and trying to learn how to control and/or cure his emerald alter-ego.  When the military finally catches up to him, though, the story's pace quickens and features a chase that takes us from a college campus to the city streets.  Hulk fights through sonic weapons, helicopters and automobiles and uses a few jeeps, chains and whatever else happens to be nearby as a weapon.  In short, the meat of this film is action, and fans of action will go to bed after watching \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" with a full stomach.<br /><br />Light on story, heavy on action and plenty of nods to the classic Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno television series make \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" a big improvement over its big screen predecessor.  There are also a few blinks of what is to come in the future \\"Avengers\\" film.<br /><br />Is \\"The Incredible Hulk\\" perfect?  No, but it's still an excellent film.  Recommended.
0375826726|2.0|I've read through some other reviews and they pretty much cover the flaws in this book.  I just wish I had done that BEFORE I bought this 'final installment' in the series. I kept reading and looking at the pages left in the book thinking, 'how are we going to get to the end of the series in this book?' Well, guess what? You don't! You spend hours reading and nothing really happens, and then you find out that nothing IS going to happen until the next book. Did the author have a deadline and couldn't figure out his own ending in time, so they published this 'holder' book instead? Sure seems like it. I think Paolini is over praised as a writer. His series is readable. I would like to have finished it. I get the feeling the author would like to have finished it too, he just wasn't sure how to. I don't think he has any idea who Galbatorix is, or how to defeat him, so he is metaphorically wandering around his pretend country hoping something will come to him. Had I know this wasn't the final book, just the third book, I doubt I would have purchased it. Very clever, of the publishers, really, to squeeze a little more out of their little baby cash cow. I thought the 'plot review' at the beginning was horrible and read just like a freshman's book report of the series. And I thought the writing in general was over blown with verbiage and so empty of plot or substance it was surprising the book didn't just float away. Don't waste your time on this book, wait for the fourth one
B001DU8T6S|3.0|To begin I am a huge Paul Rodgers fan and probably best described a fair-weathered fan of Queen. Now this album has some great music on it such as \\"Voodoo\\" a slow bluesy number which is a superb vehicle for Rodgers crooning style with each word seemingly dripping from a pool of blues guitar. \\"We Believe\\" is a good toe tapping anthem crying out for leadership. \\"Still Burnin\\" reminds me of the rocking rolling songs from the Bad Company - Yes sir, nice! \\"Warboys\\" is a fine rocker with Queen's homage to the fighting \\"boys\\" of the war complete with guns and tanks. \\"Some Things That Glitter\\" is another gem which is slower and reminds me of BC days. \\"C-lebrity\\" has great rock bones to it but the lyrics suck. \\"Through the Night\\" should be on the radio. \\"Say It's Not True\\" is awful. \\"Surf's Up...Schools\\"s Out\\" - are you kidding me? Horrible! This album starts out with some boring swirling sounds and then breaks into some old fashioned 50's rock and roll complete with hand clapping - shoot me. This is not the way to start an album which does not feature a 50's band throughout. I wish that Queen and Mr. Rodgers had left some stinkers off of this disc because there are some really good tunes on this album. I mean come on, do you really need all 14 tracks which include less than stellar material or wouldn't it make more sense to just offer the cream and start working on the next great Queen recording? Oh yes, the album cover is just lame. Overall, I can delete the poopers before I transfer this to my portable listening device and pretend that Queen + Paul Rodgers rocks! - Ciao
0312382464|5.0|As a huge fan of historical fiction I had heard of Sharon Penman as a writer, a story teller worthy of praise but had never read any of her works till the Welsh Triology.<br /><br />Falls the Shadow is the story of Simon de Montfort and his fight for the rights of the common people of England against a weak, and changeable King Henry III. Wales and the happenings of Llewelyn ap Gruffydd are also key to the story as loyalties are tried, tested and ran through and the hope of a better tomorrow are dreamed today.<br /><br />Sharon Penman has the ability to transport the reader to the place and time of the events in her books. The reader experiences the emotions and daily struggle of life and death of the middle ages when everything hung in the balance and anybody could be friend or foe.
B001DJLD1M|5.0|There's really no reason to go into describing The Matrix Trilogy. Unless you lived under a rock for the past ten years, The Matrix is one of the most original and influential Science Fiction films of recent memory. Starring Keanu Reeves and directed by The Wachowski Brothers (who recently gave us the live-action Speed Racer film), this tale of computers taking over the reality of the human race and a small group of survivors in constant battle to win back their independence, successfully blasted it's way through theatres between the years of 1999 thru 2003. Complete with two theatrical sequels and one direct-to-video animated film called \\"The Animatrix\\", it was THE complete tale to own on DVD. Each film was released separately on the format as two-disc sets complete with somewhat bloated extras (The first and animated releases keep the extras on the film disc). But back in 2004, Warner Bros. released the \\"Ultimate Matrix Collection\\", a whopping ten disc collection featuring a brand new transfer of the first film and even more behind-the-scenes footage. But at a steep price of $52.00, for someone that really just wanted the movies, it wasn't all that practical. Now Warner Bros has introduced The Matrix to it's \\"4 Film Favorites\\" line, and the result is a great buy for the fan that just wants the films but at a more reasonable price.<br /><br />Let me explain what you exactly get here. Housed in one original sized keepcase with a leaf in the middle to separate the two discs inside, each disc is a DVD-18, otherwise known as \\"dual-sided/dual-layed\\". Imagine if you took say The Matrix DVD and glued/attached it's label side to the label side of the first movie disc of The Matrix Reloaded. Then did the same thing to Disc One of Matrix Revolutions and the single disc of The Animatrix. That's pretty much what this set is. Each side is an EXACT, down to the bitrate quality, copy of the original release as it was when first released. Same menus, video/audio, Disc One extras, and all. Nothing has been changed except there's no picture label side now. Sure, the Disc Two's of Reloaded/Revolutions are absent now, but for under $12, and if you only want the movies that still are presented in their original Anamorphic Widescreen video, this for the tight-walleted film fans out there that never bothered to buy these films in the first place is truly the best way to go.<br /><br />If the set has any cons, the first film is from 1999 DVD master, and while it's okay, it's still nowhere near the quality of the 2004 remaster that for Standard Definition discs is still exclusive to the Ultimate boxset. The transfers on the other three films here DO match in quality since they all were shot digitally to begin with, so one out of three isn't all that bad. Also, in order to give two full dual-layered presentations on just one disc, they HAVE to be dual-sided, otherwise known as \\"flippers\\". With flippers, each side is untouchable so to not get unwanted scratches on either side, you have to be more careful with them than a single-sided disc with it's label side that can be handled much easier.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you never bothered in buying either the individual releases or the high-priced boxset, this 4 Film Favorites set for the cost and space-saving is an excellent deal. Other than losing a bonus disc of features that you probably would watch just once anyway, you get the whole Matrix for the cost of just one tiny little red pill.<br />(RedSabbath Rating:8.5/10)Nothing has been changed except there's no picture label side now.

B0014DZ2VO|4.0|QUANTUM OF SOLACE (Q of S) will provide Bond devotees plenty of solace, since to paraphrase Charles Dickens in a single movie Director Marc Forster and writers Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis, and Robert Wade have managed to capture a lot of the best of Bond while unfortunately mixing in a little of the worst of Bond. It is the season of the most prolonged and action filled chase scenes of any Bond movie, take your choice of car, boat or plane. But at the same time it is the seaon of a villain (Mathieu Amalric cast as Dominic Greene) whose character is more that of an unlikeable sleazeball with a goal that seems terribly underwhelming for an organization as powerful as Quantum, rather than the true evil genius who Bond has so often been arrayed against. (Yes, the title does at least double duty in this film. Quantum is not an acronym, but is the same unnamed criminal organization that was behind events in CASINO ROYALE.) As the first Bond movie to represent a true sequel, while Q of S can be enjoyed as a standalone film it will lose some its impact for moviegoers who have not watched that film and are not aware of the circumstances of Vesper's death and Bond's reaction to it.     The original Ian Fleming source short story \\"Quantum of Solace\\" was first published in Modern Woman / Cosmopolitan magazine in May 1959. It was later included in the book \\"For Your Eyes Only\\". This was the first collection of Fleming James Bond short stories and was first published on 11 April 1960. The collection was subtitled \\"Five Secret Occasions in the life of James Bond\\" and also included the short stories \\"From A View To A Kill\\" and \\"For Your Eyes Only\\". Q of S was inspired by a true story in an anecdote told to him by friend, neighbor and one-time lover Blanche Blackwell who received a Cartier wrist watch as gift from him when it was published. According to the short story, the Quantum of Solace is defined as \\"a precise figure defining the comfort/humanity/fellow feeling required between any pair of people for love to survive. If the Quantum of Solace is 0, then love is dead.\\"    During the film, M, once again played to perfection by Judi Dench says to Bond \\"It'd be a pretty cold bastard who didn't want revenge for the death of someone he loved, to which Bond replies \\"I don't think the dead care about vengeance\\", and thus viewers are left to decide for themselves whether or not Bond is looking for a \\"quantum of solace\\" after his experiences in Casino Royale. Another layer of complication is added that relatively early in the story we learn that Camille (Olga Kurylenko) who joins him to in his quest to thwart Greene, is out to exact her own revenge. (The exclusion of spoilers keeps me from revealing more details.) However, before the film ends Bond reassures M that he was always in control. His revenge, however, was clearly achieved even as he thwarted the villains and maintained the integrity of MI6, so you can order his priorities for yourself.    Daniel Craig is superb in this incarnation of James Bond, and the rest of the cast does an excellent job a well. However, while the evolution of Bond's character was inevitable, I regret somewhat that he has become much more the standard action film hero - with little of his original charming British exterior and suave and debonair style. And while the action scenes are exciting and well done, they resemble similar roof top, car and subterranean chase scenes in countless recent films, rather than utilizing the gadgetry which used to distinguish Bond's struggles with his adversaries but has now become standard with the proliferation of computer generated special effects in most films. So, perhaps wisely although still a disappointing break with tradition, the newest high tech aids to Bond are now in the MI6 war room that serves as control HQ for M as she interacts with Bond through satellite communications. (This stuff is very neat indeed.)    My biggest disappointment was the storyline (calling it a plotwould give it more seriousness than it deserves), which served as the vehicle to showcase all this talent and action. While I cannot go into detailed criticism since the details are only gradually revealed during the movie, an organization as powerful as Quantum would certainly have something more complex and rewarding to do than the goal which Bond and Camille manage to thwart in what is literally an incredible blaze of glory. However, if you can just ignore the plot and go along for the ride, it is a thrill a minute that even manages to include a few of the traditional linguistic touches. Mr. GREENE's cover is that of an environmental activist, which is a nice touch, and the credits reveal that the redheaded agent FIELDS who is only referred to as Fields during the film and whose fate reprises a scene in GOLDFINGER is actually STRAWBERRY FIELDS. The opening credits interspersed with and animated by the shifting desert sands were certainly as memorable of other Bond films as well. Finally, much to my delight the film managed to include implicit criticism of the idiocy and misdirection that sometimes masquerades as real politik among government bureaucrats, as both the British and US governments ally themselves with Greene and Quantum in a marriage of convenience in the name of the greater good of their supposed national interests. Of course, M keeps the faith in her agent and Bond plunges ahead, the plot is foiled and revenge is achieved, although with so many dead bodies left in Bond's wake that even M is appalled.    I enjoyed QUANTUM OF SOLACE, and I plan to see it again. However, the inane plot and the lack of the joie de vivre in Bond's actions coupled with the fact that I am not sure I will purchase the DVD, one of my usual criteria for a five star rating, led me to decide to round down my rating to four stars. It is certainly in the upper echelon of all of the Bond films, and I recommend it for all Bond fans and action film aficionados.    Tucker Andersen

1933492279|5.0|Very impressive!  I haven't seen future concepts as good as this since I bought a copy of Syd Mead's 'Sentinel' in the late seventies.  Interestingly, on page 126, Daniel Simon credits Mead as the inspiration for the staging and vehicle concepts of his work and on page 127 there is a concept car with romantic princess and a tiger on a leash: pure Mead.    Any future fan will love this book.  Based around the mythical Cosmic Motors Company located in the middle of the Galaxion Galaxy.  The companies nine vehicles are presented in stunning color digital reality and you really have to see this work to appreciate the love and control Simon has put into each image.  He says all his work is produced using Autodesk AliasStudio software.  As well as the color imagery each unit has plenty of concept art in sepia and black.    The thing that really grabbed me about the images is the used look.  This is tech that has been used out there in the galaxies, dirt, scratches, wisps of smoke or dirty exhausts suggests hard working units.  Another thing that gives everything a cool look is all the bits of lettering and graphics that seem to pepper racing cars, jets and other bits of high technology.  Syd Mead's art used some of this material but had to hand-letter the stuff, now software makes it much easier, precise and credible.    The book is a handsome design job with 175 screen on art paper.  All the art has captions and a sort of running story involving the vehicles and their use in the future.  Fans of virtual reality art will love it and this raises the obvious question: when will the second edition be out!     ***SEE SOME INSIDE PAGES by clicking 'customer images' under the cover.
B0014BDP88|3.0|This dreamy movie about lonely people seeking connections provided an hour and a half of decent entertainment without ever truly engaging my emotions.<br />  Elizabeth, played by the attractive Norah Jones, who is a great musician and a so-so actress, is trying to recover from a broken heart. She hangs out in a New York coffee bar where she gets chatting to owner Jude Law, who himself is emerging from an unhappy love affair. They can't quite connect.<br />  Click: suddenly, without much explanation, we're in Memphis where Elizabeth is waitressing. She meets an alcoholic cop, obsessed with his estranged wife who no longer loves him. Rachel Weisz appears as the wife and indulges in a bout of severe overacting.<br />  Click: now we're in Nevada where Elizabeth falls in with a young gambler played by Natalie Portman (more overacting).<br />  Click: back to New York, back to the coffee bar. Kiss kiss, fade to black.<br />  Note to director: only 6 percent of college-educated Americans smoke according to the latest CDC statistics. On the other hand, it often seems to me that 90 percent of college educated movie characters, like the ones in this movie, smoke. Is this product placement or just sheer stupidity. When I see characters smoking, I find that I don't care that much if they find the love and happiness they seek. They're not going to live happily ever after -- they're going to die of lung cancer and heart disease. Give us realistic intelligent characters who don't smoke.<br />  Bottom line to potential viewers: I found this movie pleasant enough, the music is good, Jones is easy on the eyes, Law has a nice British accent. There are worse ways to waste an evening.
1433502410|3.0|I have not purchased this Bible, but looked at it a couple of times to see if I would not want to buy it.  Each time my examination has reinforced my disappointments.    I looked at Luke 2 to see what is said about \\"Augustus.\\"  Nothing much is said.  The word is not a personal name, but a nickname implying he was the son of god and savior of the world.  A very preachable thing is to realize that about eight verses later the real Son of God and savior of the world is born in very humble circumstances.      I looked at the Tower of Babel story and at the first Pentecost.  Each is the antithesis of the other.  One is about human arrogance resulting in God's confusing the language.  The other is about God bridging the language gap for the purpose of the message of salvation.  There is no mention or connection between these.    There are other passages I compared that are similarly connected, but the ESV Study Bible makes no mention of a connection.  It seems to give a lot of text details, although not always complete details; but, does not make connections that are helpful for preaching.  I have some other study Bibles that do make such connections, but they are mostly in the German language.  All of my disappointments do not even begin to address the continual neglect of any sacramental emphasis in passages which I believe ascribe the forgiveness of sins to baptism and covenant renewal powers to the Lord's Supper.    Update:  I am a pastor responsible for producing a Sunday sermon each week.  Since the ESV Study Bible appeared, I stop at a bookstore and check the ESV Study Bible notes on texts I have recently researched and preached.  Repeatedly, the ESV Study Bible gives a very weak and disappointing commentary that overlooks important details in the texts.  For example, On Matthew 25:31-46 the ESV Study Bible never mentions that Matthew's constant use of terms like \\"the least\\" and \\"my brothers\\" refers to disciples of Jesus and to missionaries sent in His name.  The point is not social ministry, but how people treat Jesus' messengers as an indication of whether faith in Christ really resides in their hearts. (See Sherman W. Gray in \\"The Least of These\\" at Amazon.com.)  But, my favorite German study Bible points this out very clearly within just a few lines of commentary.  And, this German study Bible is a smaller volume with less print than the ESV Study Bible.
B000Q6ZG5C|5.0|I thought this was excellent....better than the first two Harry Potter movies combined and better than what has followed.. That's my feeling, and I'm still sticking to it.....especially now that it's available with a great Blu-Ray transfer.    This was just great fun, right from the opening. In fact, the early bus scene is the best in the film. Overall, the movie didn't have as mean an edge to it as the others, although it has a number of scary moments (which might have warranted a PG-13 rating). That was fine with me. I got tired of the dark and annoying characters of the first two films, and especially the irritating blonde wise-guy kid. I give this major points for cutting his role down. Even Alan Rickman's character softens.    In other words, there is no despicable villain to hate throughout the film, which I thought was refreshing. Instead, we just go through one adventure after another until the final surprise ending.    Along the way are a lot of fun special effects and scenery, some humor (Emma Thompson is a hoot as an eccentric tea-leaf reader) and some fantastic 5.1 surround sound to go along with this new high-definitiion disc.  I wish all the Harry Potter films were like this one.
1881273989|5.0|I have read several of Gary Chapman's books, and I think I like this one the best. Communication is the key for any good and successful relationship and The Five Love Languages For Singles really addresses this key area in great detail. This book isn't all about romantic relationships. It also addresses friendships, work relationships, parent-child relationships as well. Learning how to express oneself and even more importantly, understanding what others are trying to express is so vital in every part of everyday life. This is an excellent book.
1400049628|4.0|I have a boat load of survival manual/guides. cause y'know i like being crazy prepared no matter how absurd the threat, or situation. so people would laugh when they see this and other similar books in my collection. the book is definitely a straight forward text. so it probably isn't very  accurate to call this a humorous book. i will admit that the book's strongest suit is the historical accounts of past zombie outbreaks (or presumed outbreaks). which is brooks strong point being that he was a history major. and it's also the reason why there's a whole book coming out based on past accounts.<br /><br />the book is very short but very straight forward. there's no spectacle, no style,just matter of fact tone on how to survive different levels of zombie out breaks. if your a zombie buff like me, then its made specifically for you. everyone else probably won't dig it as much.
B001CB2A1I|5.0|I have read almost all of King's books, and Lisey's story is one of my favorites. I think he really crosses into some great literature here. It starts out a bit slow, but gains serious momentum. I thought the backstory was the most engaging part of the story. King always does seem to have alot of backstory. In a way, I think its the \\"real story\\" in his books, with a more simple sort of \\"boogie man\\" story happening in the present. In this book, the two flow together perfectly. If you enjoy most of his books, you will probably love this one.
B001ED7C58|3.0|My feelings on the soundtrack are mixed. While I'm definitely pleased with the Collective Soul and Muse additions (they were both, after all, on the playlist Stephenie Meyers made for the book herself, before a movie was even thought of), I find a few of the songs - ahem, \\"Go All The Way\\" - to be totally unfitting and strange. That song in particular sounds more like it belongs on an Abercrombie & Fitch soundtrack than a Twilight soundtrack. I'm also not a big fan of the Linkin Park addition, though I suppose it fits the angsty mood of the film (and furthermore is fitting due to the fact that Meyers has stated that the band Bella and Edward both profess to love in the book is Linkin Park, though they were not explicitly named, for obvious reasons).    Like so many others, I also must say that I was pretty disappointed by \\"Bella's Lullaby\\". I'm sure that when it shows up in the movie (assuming there is a scene of Edward playing it for her, like there was in the book) that it will not have a full orchestra accompaniment, but the melody of it just isn't right. I know the composers didn't want to 'pander' to us fans, but they could have had Yiruma himself write them something much better, if they didn't want to use one of the already widespread songs, \\"Kiss the Rain\\" and \\"River Flows in You\\". I also would be interested in hearing the version of the lullaby that Pattinson supposedly came up with, as he's exceptionally talented and seems to understand Edward's character very well. But the lullaby as it is stands lackluster and meandering, and never quite seems to reach a high or emotional point, or capture the joy, longing, romance, etc. that it should. It's also a somewhat simple tune, hardly what Edward, who is supposed to be extremely good at the piano, would be capable of...    As for Paramore's additions, I'm a big fan of \\"Decode\\", though there are a few lines in it that don't quite seem to fit, considering the fact that it was written with Twilight in mind (\\"When Iused to know you so well\\"?). \\"I Caught Myself\\" is not as good as \\"Decode\\", but takes up space well enough.    \\"Spotlight\\" and \\"Eyes on Fire\\" are great songs, and I think I know exactly where they'll likely fit into the plot. I love the mood they set; very Twilight-esque (in the right places).    As for Iron and Wine and Robert Pattinson's songs... They were truly the high points of the CD. \\"Flightless Bird, American Mouth\\" is a beautiful song, and I was happily surprised to see such an unexpected inclusion. Pattinson's songs add a welcome softer, more soulful side to the CD that was very necessary after the additions of Paramore, Linkin Park, and that awful techno piece. He really is an extremely talented guy, and I have the feeling that without him this whole film and soundtrack might have been very disappointing.    And finally, \\"Clair de Lune\\" and \\"La Traviata\\" were considerate additions, but I could've done without \\"La Traviata\\". \\"Clair de Lune\\" by itself as the only classical song on the CD would have been more poignant; \\"La Traviata\\" only serves to dull \\"Clair de Lune\\"s importance.    Overall, I'd be happier sans \\"Go All the Way\\", \\"I Caught Myself\\", and \\"La Traviata\\", perhaps as well as \\"Leave Out All The Rest\\". Perhaps the addition of a second Muse song (\\"Time is Running Out\\", anyone?) and some more Pattinson/Iron and Wine would have been better, or more interesting picks along the lines of MuteMath and The Black Ghosts.    But... C'est la vie. It could've been much worse.
B00005JKC3|3.0|I thought the cast for this film was really good.  I also liked how the director shot certain parts of the movie as if you were reading a comic book.  Despite the positive elements, there were two main things that dragged it down.  They were the wierd-looking super dogs, and the disappointing water creature that the father becomes at the end.  The special effects were also lacking throughout.  This one is decent, but the newer Hulk movie is far superior.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Director Michael Mann ([[ASIN:B000UGBOT0 Manhunter]] and [[ASIN:B0006J28KU Heat]]) is well known for being a precise and methodical filmmaker. He often focuses on minute but important aspects of both the story and the characters therein, which has earned him the reputation of being an \\"actor's director\\". This unique interaction between Mann and his cast is exemplified in the suspense film, Collateral, which features an impressive cast of actors, all of whom give naturalistic and psychologically complex performances. The story, about a cab driver who is forced to drive a hitman around the city of Los Angeles while he assassinates his targets, is quite literally driven by its vividly realized characters. These characters, who are three-dimensional and feel almost familiar, are brought to life by an all-star cast. The cast includes Tom Cruise as Vincent, Jamie Foxx as Max, Jada Pinkett Smith as Annie, and Mark Ruffalo as Detective Fanning. Each member of the cast gives a great performance, especially Jada Pinkett Smith and Mark Ruffalo, who aren't what would be considered the main characters and yet they create memorable personas. But the real scene-stealers are the performances of Foxx and Cruise, whose characters are dynamic despite being polar opposites.    Vincent is a slickly dressed, cold and calculating hitman, who has buried his emotions for years in order to make himself a more efficient killer. Max is an obsessive-compulsive, perfectionist of a cabdriver, who has allowed his lifelong dreams to slip by because he lacks the confidence and the initiative to make them a reality. But on one fateful night, these two strangers' lives will collide and neither will be the same.  When Vincent asks Max if he will drive him around the city while he makes five stops, Max is at first hesitant and unsure... until Vincent offers him $700. But during their first stop, while Vincent is inside of an apartment complex, a body falls from the balcony and comes crashing down onto the roof of Max's cab. It immediately becomes clear that Vincent has killed the man and Max knows that he has now essentially become a hostage. As Max is forced to drive Vincent to his remaining stops while Vincent assassinates his targets, the two share conversations and begin to see each other for who and what they truly are. This has an effect on the both of them, though a different effect. As Max becomes more assertive and confident, Vincent is reintroduced to his more human side. Meanwhile a narcotics detective named Fanning is tracking down Vincent because he knows that someone's responsible for the deaths of certain witnesses for the prosecution of a major drug trafficker named Felix. And it is Felix that has hired Vincent to eliminate these witnesses. It's not long before the FBI becomes involved and they believe that Max is the killer, not Vincent who they don't even know exists.  Soon Max is angered by Vincent's general disregard for life and he is empowered by the realization that he does have some control over what happens to him. When Max discovers that Vincent's final target is a beautiful criminal prosecutor named Annie, who Max had befriended earlier in the evening, Max is forced to race Vincent to save her. Max, the passive cabbie is pitted against Vincent, the sociopathic contract killer. Yet on this night anything can happen.    Collateral gave Michael Mann the unique opportunity of shooting a film in Los Angeles after dark and he delighted in showing audiences a side to the city that they may not have known existed before. Using, predominantly, a Hi Def digital camera, he creates a vision of Los Angeles that is simultaneously stark, oppressive, beautiful, and colorful. Mann also exposes the economic differences and the cultural diversity of L.A., which gives the film a different flavor from other films that have shot there.  Though highly stylized and at times a little predictable, Collateral is one of the best suspense films of the past decade. The reason being that it's rare to have such naturalistic actors playing such believable characters while they are trapped in the most extraordinary of circumstances. This is where Mann excels as a filmmaker, telling stories that are somewhat far-fetched and yet it doesn't matter because as an audience we have a sincere emotional investment in the characters. As we watch Max and Vincent confide in each other, and as we see them both become torn by internal conflict, we can't help but empathize with their plights and wonder, \\"What would I do in that situation?\\"      Also recommended:  [[ASIN:B0006GVJEE Léon: The Professional]]  [[ASIN:B00000IRE6 Nick of Time]]  [[ASIN:B000EDWKWY Enemy of the State]]  [[ASIN:B0001AVZCQ Panic Room]]  [[ASIN:B00005JL5F Changing Lanes]]  [[ASIN:B00005JLQN Phone Booth]]  [[ASIN:B0007PALT8 Man on Fire]]  [[ASIN:B000EHQUOE Crash]]
B00005JLXE|3.0|There are some good things about this show, and some bad things.  It is a dark movie as it should be, being that Daredevil is a dark character.  Collin Farrel was absolutely perfect as Bullseye.  His preformance was the best part for me.  I have some reservations regarding the decision to cast Ben Affleck as the lead.      The main thing lacking is back story.  They needed to show some more of Daredevil's training and explain about how he got his powers.  What they did show was just insufficient.  I don't buy that a 12-year old boy could train himself like that, even in a comic book.        I also did not like the obvious CGI effects, and there were too many gymnastics in a lot of the fighting scenes.         There is nothing special about the DVD.  Over all the film is entertaining and worth seeing and/or owning.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|This season of Gilmore Girls tied up a lot of loose ends, which definitely makes sense considering that it was the last season.

The logistics of the movie must have been a nightmare what with the sets, costumes, wigs, makeup, cinematography,production design,etc.     I like this director's work. He uses the \\"God view\\" camera-work, we see the characters by hovering over their heads in many shots. I didn't find this distracting, quite the contrary, it was hypnotic, as was the \\"artsy\\" lighting and camera of whizzing around a holy looking Elizabeth.    I don't know if anyone noticed the possibility that Elizabeth was a lesbian or bi-sexual. She seemed to have a very close relationship with the stunningly gorgeous Bess played by Abbie Cornish whom I'd never seen before. I'm straight, but, omigod, if a pale yellow perfect rosebud could be transformed into a human face, it would be hers! Her face is so beautiful pure and innocent, she'll make you weep. Elizabeth seemed sexually torn between Beth and Raleigh which made it pretty interesting.    The costumes, wigs, makeup, sets, cinematography, and especially the bold music score was a feast! It makes me sick that No Country For Old Men beat this one out at the Oscars! I have a feeling that there's a trilogy here, but if this one did not make a profit, I doubt if we'll get to see how it all turned out. Cate Blanchett OWNS this character!!! That gal just couldn't do any bad acting if she tried.
B000002OX7|5.0|Even though Tommy is their 'moment' for many for being a great concept album, and undoubtedly the greatest rock opera there ever was. This was The Who at their hard rocking best. These are the tracks that to me defined them as a power rock band (one of the best live bands in rock).    Never before had Townsend's songwriting hit home so hard and so consistently. This record was hugely influential in getting me into rock music (I wore out the vinyl version of this album). The expanded CD version has some interesting outtakes and oddities, but the original album still has the magic to make your hair stand. Superb.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|I am a huge Star Trek fan and already own all 3 seasons of TOS on dvd so I was a unsure if I would pick this up. I was concerned that the new special effects would be a distraction away from the content of the epesodes. I did alot of internet reasearch reading reviews of both professional critics and everyday consumers to get the best idea of if it would be worth owning or not. I waited long enough that the price on amazon.ca went down to about 55 bucks! At that price I had to go for it! I have watched about half of the epesodes now on my hd dvd player and they look incredable. The show looks like it could have been filmed last week. It is almost impossible to believe that what you are watching is 40 plus year old content. I noticed the new special effects for the first few epesodes or so but after that they seem to flow effortlessly with the rest of the show. The only problem with this release is the packageing, there is no other way to describe it other than it sucks! Packageing aside if you are a true star trek fan and have been waiting and wondering if you want to make this purchase, wait no more! Even If you are concerned about HD DVD being a dead format the discs are combo format so the same content is on the flipside of the disc and will play in any standard dvd player in standard def. How can you lose? Go for it and you likley will not be dissopointed! I was most definatly not!
B000TGQDZQ|5.0|First of all, I must say that this album is not for anyone who doesn't have an appreciation for metal. Epica certainly has a devotion to the metal scene.Look up interviews on youtube and you will find that the band doesn't consider themselves to be similar to rock bands like Evanescence, which some have compared them to. Lead singer Simone Simons with her clear angelic voice is certainly the star of this group, however the album would not be what it is without the contrast between sweet melody and the depths showcased by group leader, Mark Jansen and the comparatively strong dark quality of the growls and grunts featured in these songs. A true fan of Epica will find this album is even better than their last albums, as there is a noticeable increase of input from Ms. Simons in terms of writing and vocal strength. Anyone who prefers a more classical symphonic sound or who isn't interested in the contrast offered by what the entire band brings to the table should probably stick to purchasing the singles which offer growl and gruntless versions of the songs.      Anyone who appreciates this contrast will not be disappointed when purchasing this album.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|this is a cd for you to buy if you liked the first or never heard it before
B0013N3DSE|3.0|Far from the earth-shattering restoration we were promised in this BluRay edition, this is just another direct port to BluRay from DVD.      The audio is still mono, a major disappointment. Still a great movie, but Warner Brothers didn't deliver the BluRay product they promised.     Those of us with upconverting players will get quality every bit as good from the plain old DVD version.
B00068ULLY|4.0|Usually I am not a huge fan of Tarantino, but when he is great, like with Reservior Dogs or this fantastic duo, he is truly a unique filmmaker.  Uma Thurman is great is this, she is perfect as the bada** heroine and Caradine rocks as her nemisis the eponymous Bill.  This is just a fun movie to watch, it's full of over the top violence of course, this is Tarantino afterall, and the the action sequences are sort of tougue in cheek, in a omage to Bruce Lee.  In addition to Thurman and Caradine, Daryl Hanna rocks in this, the fight scene between she and Thurman is one of the great cinematic Cat Fights of all time.  This film is really Uma Thurmans and she throws herself into it head first.  Really the best part of the film is the ending, it ties everything together is and is poinient and funny in way..the look on Caradines face is priceless.  Since this is actually one film broken into two parts and this is a box set I really saw no reason to compare the two, I reviews it as as whole, and you should look at it as such, I mean who is going to watch Vol. 1 and not Vol. II..get realz.  Nice work, by Tarantino, highly recommended, really a classic of this genre..uh whatever this genre is~
0786939532|5.0|From reading Homeland since I was a high school teenager, it had inspired me to publish my own fantasy/adventure novel entitled The Final Crusade at age 21. Drizzt was my favorite character of all time, a maverick hero who defies the evil ways of his race and follows his own moral conscience and honor. His background delivers a strong message to everyone living in the real world that nobody should be subjugated by laws and regulations that denies their rights. Reading it made me imagine how it was to be trapped alone in a dictatorship society that rejects integrity, become a prisoner of my own home, and that I (as Drizzt) had no freedom to voice out my own beliefs.<br /><br />Drizzt had taught me to become a leader instead of a follower and that being different from the rest was never a crime, especially if I knew that what I did was good. Zaknafein, the supporting character, was a mentor figure because he was the one who shaped Drizzt's personality. However, he lacked the courage to escape Menzoberranzan, something he failed but Drizzt succeeded. Again, I want to emphasize that this novel will have an impact in changing someone because they will always have a role model to emulate. Salvatore, in my opinion, was the most interesting novelist out of all fantasy authors because his stories really paint a picture on how it will feel like to be inside his dreamscape. His combat scenes and detailed characters surely hook the audience.<br /><br />Once I finished reading Homeland, I was compelled to order Exile. I was never aware on how a normal Sunday visit to the local library that sold used books for less than a dollar could have made me a fortune in knowing one of the best writers in the fantasy genre.
B001E75QH0|5.0|I loved Harrison Ford when I was a teenager and I still do! Now I get to share these movies with my daughter. I am giving this to her as a Christmas present and I know that she will be pleased. She enjoys the Indy movies and all the action! Great movies to watch with your kids.

B00008PX8P|5.0|I was one of the priviledged few to have seen Led Zeppelin live in New York City at the young age of 14. (I had the coolest dad). When everyone else was listening to the Bay City Rollers my room was literally wallpapered with Led Zeppelin posters, so much so that when I finally took them down (somehwere around age 26) the walls around the posters were yellow. I held a candlelight vigil for John Henry \\"Bonzo\\" Bonham for months after his death. I wrote letters to Swan Song begging them to convince them to go on. (I still have the replies from a lovely woman named Diane who worked there.) Anyway, you get the point. This DVD set (sans the Immigrant song in the beginning of the second DVD which is a little fuzzy) is perfect. If you are young and want to see what all the fuss was about buy this and you will know why they are truly the greatest. One of my favorite tracks from this set is Since I've Been Loving You. The bluesy sounds of the band paired with Robert Plant's orgasmic singing will blow you away. I saw snippets of their O2 London tribute concert from December of 2007 (God Bless You Tube) and I must say, even in their 60s they've still got it! I truly wish the band would release their choke hold of the NYC concerts and release them on DVD in their entirety (You can see snippets of them from the movie The Song Remains The Same.) That would be awesome. Buy this, you will not be disappointed.
B001DTPZNY|2.0|This is so boring!  The acting is cheesy as can be and I dont mean in a classic, Indiana Jones waay either. This is just bad bad bad.  There are scenes in it where it is so obviously a Hollywood studio its laughable.  I fell asleep 5 times trying to get through this awful movie.  Harrison should have stopped at the last one. No chemistry between actors at all and the story is just forgettable due to how bad this movie is.
B001C08RHA|1.0|You people these days consider this a good movie? Haha. Who in their right mind believes that a bat character that drives a Pontiac Firebird clone can save the world from evil?<br /><br />For good and REAL action check out WWE, ECW, or TNA.<br />For good classic Wrestling.. check out WCW and WWF.
B000063V8S|4.0|Most fans agree that season 4 was TNG's best - not because it had the most classic episodes, but because the show was consistently good, with relatively few duds.  Even the duds were generally mediocre rather than terrible - something you couldn't say for the 3 seasons that followed.    There are some classic episodes on this set, a few of which don't end up on most fan favorite lists - \\"The Drumhead\\" (in my personal top 5), \\"The Wounded\\", \\"Family\\", \\"The Mind's Eye\\" and \\"Data's Day\\".  The conclusion to season 3's cliffhanger \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\" is great, if not at the level of part 1; \\"Redemption Part 1\\" closes the season on a very strong note.    While later seasons had their share of great and even classic episodes, some of the focus dissipated and each was peppered with some clunkers.  Here, that's not a problem.  Even casual fans are likely to want this 7 DVD collection.
B000PKG7TI|5.0|End Of An Era is a great show. I also own From Wishes To Eternity which is also great..Unfortunately, both are fullscreen dvds! This version of End Of An Era is quite new yet it is fake widescreen. It appears widescreen if you watch it on a normal tv but on a widescreen it is 4:3 aspect. Very disappointing in that manner, and I do feel the video quality is a bit lacking but other than those two things it is a good dvd/performance. If only they put some music videos on it! Now it is time to wait for the Dark Passion Play dvd, assuming Nightwish makes one.  For a truly epic performance, check out the Within Temptation & Metropole Orchestra dvd: Black Symphony. It truly is the best I've seen.
1559408855|4.0|\\"Salo or 120 Days of Sodom\\" (1975) by Pier Paolo Pasolini is the film the completely lives up to its reputation of one of or even THE most disturbing, depressing, cruel, and unwatchable ever made. I had to fast forward some of the scenes and turned from the screen during the others. It is not surprising because Pasolini had adapted to the screen the most notorious and IMO unreadable novel by Marquise De Sade and updated it from 18th Century France to 1944 Fascist's Italy to so called Republic of Salo where Mussolini had his last residence. I could not finish the novel. I stopped after 40 pages or so because it is not the novel really rather a catalog of disgusting. The main four characters have been introduced in the beginning as the fully developed monsters. Their victims just stayed that - the victims. There is no plot, no intrigue, and no development, just the endless loop of rapes, tortures, and murders. Yes, I understand that it is a satire and the absolute power corrupts absolutely but reading the book was a torture of boredom. As for Pasolini's work, I've loved and admired every one of his films I've seen before I decided to see Salo. Controversial, unpredictable, a true poet of cinema, his films are among my favorites, they talk to me like not many do. I finished watching \\"Salo or 120 Days of Sodom\\", all of it, including the tragic devastating final part, and I have not formed the final opinion on it. It is not the film to enjoy, it is a beautifully photographed by great Tonino Delli Colli, dressed by Danilo Donati, with Production design by Dante Ferretti, set on piano music by Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Chopin, \\"Carmina Burana\\" by Carl Orf, and original score by Ennio Morricone, journey to hell, to its most horrifying circles, and there is no Virgil to guide us there. Is it a masterpiece as some of the critics and viewers suggest or the failure that forgot what it wanted to say by showing the scene after scene of unthinkable tortures, humiliations and degradations that so called humans (or the creatures that look like humans but are worse than animals because animals don't torture for pleasure) inflict on the helpless and innocent victims? I don't know but it is unforgettable whether you like it or not and it was made by a brilliant master of cinema.<br /><br />It is truly one of its kind films, and sometimes I think it is great, but more often - why Pasolini made it? As far as violence and disgusting content go, there are hundreds of films that have outdone Salo by the mile but nothing can beat it by its emotional impact, nothing can compare in the exploration of depths of inhumanity so called humans who are in reality the monsters in human shape are capable of. Pasolini said he wanted to make a movie with no hope - Salo it is. There is no hope, no single ray of light, no hint of optimism, only absolute darkness, and that perhaps disturbs and depresses the viewers so much. I still hear the cry of one of the girls-victims in the end of the film, \\"Why did God abandon us?!!\\" In the world where God turned his face away from His creatures, horror and degradation of these proportions are possible, and they may and do repeat over and over again in different periods of time, in different countries and continents.<br /><br />Pasolini's last film is not the one I will ever want to see again but I believe it should be seen at least once by any thinking viewer.called humans (or the creatures that look like humans but are worse than animals because animals don't torture for pleasure) inflict on the helpless and innocent victims?

B001GKJ2FC|5.0|I haven't seen the dvd yet but I enjoyed this movie more than any other this year.  I have a nasty habbitt of only reviewing things I hate but I had to say something about this movie.  Lots of cool action, good acting and a half way decent plot.  Thats it!  None of that psycological garbage you get from Dark Knight, that you need a PHD to follow, just pure simple movie enjoying.  The last 15 minutes of this movie is action packed at it's finest, but the rest of the movie builds up nicely to it..  I love this movie and whish that hollywood would make more like this.
B001GZ6QBU|4.0|Heath Ledger may have made a fantastic Joker, but the movie Joker's personality & background have no foundation in the comic's history, even though the Joker has no solid background. I would say that the Ledger Joker got the personality right & made up it's own history, while the Nicholson Joker went of one of the accepted stories of the Joker's creation. Reguardless of my cons outweighing my pros, it's the best Batman movie I've seen & I do recommend it.    PROS: Unlike the Nicholson Joker, Ledger's Joker personality is more canon; the devotion to messing with Batman, the lust for elaborately planned carnage, the amboguous sexuality, the lack of fear in dying, the suggestiveness that he knows but doesn't care that Bruce Wane is Batman & the way he sees Wayn as Batman's mask & the Bat as the real thing, the way he enjoys twisting people's minds into insanity, his expencive taste in clothing, his nonchalantness in offing his own henchmen, the way he conciders killing hostages a game. The Joker of today is said to be supersane, pretending to be a nutcase to avoid the death penalty, & Ledger seemed to be going with that.    CONS: This Joker has a slit-mouthed smile. Where did that come from? He also wears make-up instead of his face being chemically transformed. That probably came from The Dark Knight Returns book. The Joker's fashion sence is characteristicly expencive, but the Joker's fashion sence is supposed to be stuck in the past. The suit he wears in today's comics is a Ringmaster inspired Zoot Suit. Also, the Joker is not supposed to be responsible for Harvey becoming Two Face. Ledger's Joker barely fakes being nutty by talking to himself, cracking lame jokes, or rambling on about nothing to hostages. Commissioner Gordon DID have a wife named Barbara, but the wife that gets shot was Sarah. The Barbara the Joker nearly killed was Gordon's daughter.
B000OV170W|2.0|I initially enjoyed the book but the end fell so flat that I really cannot recommend it.  What a disappointment.  The book raises interesting ethical issues.
B001DTPZNY|3.0|Looking forward to a bit of Indiana Jones nostalgia, we rented this DVD with high hopes.  High expectations may be what thwarted us, but this one just didn't hold up to the original Indiana Jones trilogy.  There were dangerous insects, collapsing temples, car chases--all the requisite stuff for an Indy movie, but somehow the cleverness, the humor, and the heart were missing.  Interactions between Indy and his old girlfriend and her son were wooden and forced and didn't really get the viewer on board.  My favorite part was a sword fight between two men on fast-traveling, side-by-side jeeps, but much of the movie seemed like old stuff rehashed.  Harrison Ford is still Harrison Ford, though a bit older and grayer, and that was worth about 2 of the 3 stars.  Watch it if you must, but be forewarned that it is only a shadow of the first 3 movies in the series.
B001DPC52C|5.0|I am very much in love with this dvd. This is much better than The Silent Force tour dvd, which was still great of course. While there are 3 extras, I still feel the need for more bonus features, like music videos perhaps. Also, I noticed the video quality somewhat lacked in the quick flash moments but I sat very close to the screen so normally I doubt it is noticeable. Overall, Black Symphony is not to be missed!
B001F0VHEM|5.0|This is truly Pink at her best.  I couldn't wait to get it and now I'm very pleased with EVERY song on it.  It's definitely a must if you are a Pink fan.
B0017ANAZO|3.0|This was an OK movie.  Well acted, but not as good as the original.  It seemed a lot more bland, with a lot of the \\"teeth\\" of the biting humor of the original  missing.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0008ENICU The Women (Keepcase)]]
B001DHXT6G|5.0|When I first heard about the 40th anniversary remastered episodes, I was skeptical.  Having seen the original Star Trek series on prime time TV in 1966, 67, & 68, and always liking it better than any of the other Star Trek series that came afterwards, I thought that it would be a huge mistake.  I was wrong.  These new effects are what Roddenbery would have done had he the budget and technology.  They are not out of place; they very much have the feel and flavor of the live-action scenes and mesh perfectly.  The live-action scenes themselves are now much sharper, colors more saturated, better contrast.  Of course I have the complete series as it was originally broadcast- that is a must and I can't part with them.  But the remastered episodes are just as essential.  They are the original series episodes with the fine details that they have always  deserved- even if it took 40 years to finally finish them.  I can't imagine any of the original writers or directors having complaints about these remastered episodes- especially since they are in addition to, and not replacing- the series as it was first produced and broadcast.
B00168OINK|3.0|I like almost all the good movies that come out, and bought this blu ray just because of the Amazon reviews. Needless to say, I wasn't all that impressed. There were some partially funny moments and the animation looked amazing, especially towards the end, but overall it was just kinda not that entertaining in my opinion. That's all.
B001IT2H2G|5.0|This song is Bond worthy. Not since Live and Let Die, has there been such a well orchestrated, rock theme for Bond.
0765316897|4.0|A year after the events in The Well of Ascension, the world is ending.  Vin has accidentally released a hidden evil into the world, one that seems impossible to fight.  Their only hope is to follow the Lord Ruler's instructions and trust that he has the answer, but as things get increasingly worse, Vin and Elend get desperate in their attempts to thwart this new evil as this trilogy ends in an unexpected crescendo.    I've been waiting months for this book.  I read and loved The Well of Ascension way back in January; I bought it in hardcover because I didn't want to wait.  Without question, Brandon Sanderson is the best new fantasy writer that I have read.  He creates endearing, believable characters (I adore Vin), places them in a complex and unusual fantasy world, and has one of the most logical but still really awesome magical systems that I've ever come across.  And he can certainly write.  The story here is good and unpredictable.  It feels like they must have the answers, and sometimes I could see them coming, but I could never work out what was going to happen next.  The ending was similarly unexpected.  I love how he picks up many threads from the beginning of the trilogy and weaves them in here.  I can't wait to read all three in sequence to see what I've missed.  I really enjoyed reading this book, as it's over 550 pages and I read it in about two days.  I had to know what happened.  At the same time, I'm a bit sad that it's over, but certainly looking forward to more from Sanderson.    That said, I cannot deny that I did have one problem with it.  A portion of the book is taken up with religious questions, mainly Sazed's sections, and Sanderson draws conclusions in the book that I just can't agree with.  I'm not a person of faith and I don't think faith is necessary to be happy; it does bother me that it's implied here.  Not only that, but these parts of the book move more slowly than the rest.  I did not want to get back to Sazed and his musings.  I think this is a personal preference issue; perhaps if I was still religious it wouldn't bother me.    Obviously, I still loved the rest of the book.  I thought about Vin and Elend while I was away from it and read it instead of doing my assignments.  I'm waiting to get in the same country as the first two so I can reread them.  As I said, there's no denying that Sanderson has ridiculous amounts of potential and I can't wait to see what he writes next.  I just hope he keeps the slow religious musings out of it next time.  This is definitely a series you shouldn't miss if you enjoy fantasy.
0525478183|3.0|This is a hard review to write because I am such a fan of John Green. I loved Looking for Alaska and Abundance of Katherines is one of my favorite all time books--so of course I was excited to be able to review this book.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say, I just never got hooked into this story. Most of all because I never could get into the main character--I just didn't feel a strong voice from him, he had no unique personality, and I never felt a reason to care about him. The other problem was his mission--he suddenly turns his whole life upside down to chase after a girl he has barely spoken to in almost 10 years. I just didn't get it. I also didn't get what was so great about her that he would need to chase her--I never felt the bond that he supposedly had for her.<br /><br />As for the other characters in the book, the only one I really liked--the only one that felt real--was Radar. He was interesting and well drawn. The rest were just stereotypes or unreal. Ben, his other best friend, was completely ridiculous with his honeybunnies and ginormous balls. Give me a break. Why mega-popular Lacey would even fall for him was completely unbelievable. Q's parents were also one-dimensional. Every scene with the parents was just something like 'we love you' or 'we think you're great'. I never saw him do anything great--do they never not get along?<br /><br />I hate to be so negative because Green is such a wonderful writer. There were many great lines in this book like when they blast their car stereo and open the windows so everyone will know what great taste in music they have--that is so perfectly teen. I also loved learning about \\"paper towns\\" a term I've never heard of.<br /><br />Anyway, judging by the other reviews I am obviously in the minority in my opinion but there it is.
0312360266|3.0|I must admit that it took me awhile to get into \\"Marked.\\" This book sat on my nighstand for over a year, while I slowly read through the first third of the book. Around page 50, things start to pick up when Zooey actually arrives at the House of Night, which is likened to a vampire finishing school. The idea of a vampire finishing school is a good one & has been used in more than one YA vampire series. I personally feel that Richelle Mead's Vampire Academy series is much better & would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed this book.    But \\"Marked\\" was just a little too predictable & the characters a little too cliche. We have the token male, gay friend, the country bumpkin roommate, the blonde mean girl, & the popular, gorgeous guy that all the girls have a crush on. The heroine is the typical unpopular, new girl who ends up going against the most popular girl in school. The results are predictable.     Despite all of this, \\"Marked\\" was a guilty pleasure, & the end left some threads hanging that could be promising in the future. I'm going to chalk this book up to a rough start & read \\"Betrayed.\\" The storyline of the second books seems much more promising.

B000KJU1MS|5.0|I disagree that in the 1980's kiss was washed out. they had a rough patch in 1980-82 then after 'lick it up' in 1983 they  were very,  very popular.  right through the 1980's they had sellout tours and sold millions of new discs. they weren't as huge as the 70's but they were still a top rock  band. Of course their heyday was the 1970's when they were the top selling band in the world.  And this boxset does showcase this very nicely.  With excellent footage and great concerts to see.  Kiss is one of the best rock bands that there ever was or will ever be.  And in the 1990's they were close to what they were in the 70's. I remember going by a college in 1998 and seeing a bunch of college kids dressed up as them and even a college music store with full model outfits in the big glass window display. Then unwisely the band never released another cd of truly songs or new material.  This was a huge mistake. However I work in school districts and to this day they seem to be attracting new fans, but many other kids think they are gone because the band foolishly won't release any new songs or a new disc. this is Very foolish indeed.<br />However I would recommend this dvd set or any of the other kissology sets to anyone who loves great hard rock or just wants to watch a  great rock show.

B001JIDE3M|4.0|This movie was good. It's fun and exciting. The visual effect was great.  Also the scenes were nice. You need to wear 3-D glasses so you can realize the movie perfectly. I like the movie character because he was known the mummy series movie star, you know that, right? This movie was making good. I never bored this movie. I had a great time to see this movie.
1595141979|5.0|Shadow Kiss by Richelle Mead is a GREAT book. Rose is a fiery, spunky girl who is in love with a man she may not be able to have. Shadow Kiss is the 3rd book in the Vampire Academy series and I am in love with it. I could not put the book down. It made me laugh and cry. I was def. reccomend this book to everyone who loves vampires!
B00000IFP6|5.0|David Zinman's approach to these 9 masterpieces, largely influenced by period performance, is electrifying and completely revelatory. The textures are immensely transparent and let the brilliant orchestration and composition material shine through. With speeds almost always on the fast side, this kind of transparency is even more impressive. The Tonhalle players are put to great challenge here and they come out totally unruffled.    Throughout, Zinman keeps rubato and romantic self-indulgence to a minimum, relying on the clear formal and rhythmic structures already present in the music to drive his performances. The result is fascinating. One senses a coherent and overall comprehensive reading instead of being entertained by minute romantic outbursts, gut-wrenching as they may be. This made me fully appreciate what is lost when Beethoven is performed like later symphonic masters; Tchaikovsky, Dvorak, Mahler, etc. More than half a century separates Beethoven's symphonies from Tchaikovsky's (Beethoven's are actually closer in date to Mozart's!). It is therefore no surprise that a more \\"classical\\" performance is so successful.    My only reluctance concerns the 2-3 later symphonies of the set. These are more mature symphonies and, having been composed well into the 19th century, could have afforded a touch more \\"romanticism\\". This is especially obvious for the 9th, particularly in the 3rd movement which will shock most listeners whit its extreme speed. Still, even at break-neck speeds, Zinman is capable of remarkable tenderness and finesse in the slow movements.     The acoustics are optimal with vivid and well-balanced orchestral sections. The Tonhalle is on top form with dashing strings and phenomenal woodwind interjections (especially on the oboe). Among the myriads of other fine sets of these symphonies (Karajan, Szell, etc.), this is certainly the one that I would recommend getting, at any price! I would certainly not want to be without it!

0307120007|2.0|We received this book as a gift. It has adorable illustrations with a great vintage feel, and my toddler twins loved the activities ... but I neglected to take it away from them after we finished reading it (because you know how it is with toddlers -- take something away that they like? and listen to tears for ten minutes? not likely!) and in about fifteen minutes, they had torn it completely apart. The comb spine style of book is NOT durable in the hands of toddlers!
B00004SA8A|4.0|As the breathless Amazon review indicates, there's a worshipful aura surrounding Wilhelm Kempff. Consider the Gramophone's comment about his Schubert: \\"No other pianist has communicated Schubert with a greater sense of his final transcendence of earthly pain and travail.\\"  Kempff has been dead long enough that a host of younger listeners might not hear magic in these famous recordings. Kempff wasn't around to see Schubert redefined as a dark, conflicted, and in the end tragic composer. No, to Kempff all of this music is sunny, lyrical, and in the end optimistic.<br /><br />There are some contemporary pianists who adhere to the same view -- Brendel, Andras Schiff, Radu Lupu, Richard Goode --  all of whom display more nuanced shading than Kempff did. For an earlier era Kempff's touch may have seemed sophisticated, even magical, but frankly, he's a bit flat-footed in the Minuets and slow movements of many sonatas, and there's a general tendency toward the prosaic. Phrasing is apt to be foursquare a lot of the time, too. Where tragedy and intensity count the most (e.g., in the \\"Relique\\" and A major Op. Post. sonatas), Kempff feels too one-dimensional. On the other hand, in the sunny sonata in A D. 664 he's quite delightful. One thing Kempff never indulges in is fussiness or archness; his successors are too often guilty of both.<br /><br />If you can pick and choose at one of the download sites online, there are things to treasure in Kempff's Schubert, but I think only fans and completists are likely to want the whole box.  As for me, my tastes run toward Schnabel, Pollini, and Richter (with respectful nods to Serkin and Perahia) as pianists who have the most to say in Schubert's haunting, elusive piano music.<br /><br />P.S. - a closer listen reminded me that DG gave Kempff rather distant, brittle recording, so don't expect the piano to sound plush or deep.
B001HTSCZI|2.0|I am at least partially to blame for being brutally disappointed by THE CLONE WARS. After watching REVENGE OF THE SITH, I believed George Lucas had finally \\"gotten it\\" -- finally remembered most of why the original trilogy was so good and done everything in his power to recapture its energy. With TCW I was hoping that momentum would continue, and he would mine the rich storytelling possibilities offered by the wars, whose surface was barely scratched by the prequel trilogy. Wrong!<br /><br />This movie is a clunker. A lead duck. A turkey. A lemon. An edsel. A dud. It has all the problems of the worst movies of the STAR WARS series -- horrible dialogue, wooden delivery, sluggish pacing, unfunny jokes, stupid characters and a dull, unimaginative plot -- but almost none of its strengths. It's so inert and lifeless it lacks the power even to be truly bad. And no, I didn't much care for the animation, either. If I wanted to see badly-written puppet theatre, I'd put socks on my hands and tell knock-knock jokes.<br /><br />The plot of CLONES is so ordinary it hardly bears recounting. Something about a plot by the Sith to drive Jabba the Hutt's criminal empire into the Separatist camp, and the Jedi's efforts to prevent this, insomuch as they understand what is going on. Unfortunately, while the movie abounds with action, spaceships, clones, droids, explosions, lightsaber fights, etc., it's not very entertaining, and the \\"new\\" characters, Ashoka (Anakin's apprentice) and Ziro the Hutt, are among the worst ever introduced in the STAR WARS universe. Of course, it's hard to say which is more unpleasant to watch; the painfully stupid sitcom banter between Anakin and Ashoka, or the horribly executed character of Ziro (I'd say whoever came up with this loser should be fired, but I know it was Lucas himself). Furthermore, the sub-plot seems to exist primarily to shove Padme Amidala and C-3PO into a story which has absolutely no place for them.<br /><br />I suppose it isn't all bad. The 50s style newsreel intro was interesting;<br />I enjoyed hearing the great Christopher Lee's basso profundo voice as he reprised Count Dooku; and there were occasional moments when something reasonably interesting or fun happened on screen, but for the most part the film is dull, unimaginative, unexciting, and the sub-plot is even more boring and unneccessary than the main story. It's really a marvel that dialogue as stupid and unfunny as that which appears in CLONES can actually get written, or that a storyline so rich in potential could not move the writers to do anything more than a story about Jabba the Hutt. It comes off as a lame attempt to bridge the two trilogies, and it fails miserably.<br /><br />Bottom line: You know those WWJD? bumper stickers? This movie should have one that reads, \\"What Was George Thinking?\\" But I already know the answer: MONEY!intro was interesting;  I enjoyed hearing the great Christopher Lee's basso profundo voice as he reprised Count Dooku; and there were occasional moments when something reasonably interesting or fun happened on screen, but for the most part the film is dull, unimaginative, unexciting, and the sub-plot is even more boring and unneccessary than the main story.

B000R7HY0K|4.0|I think because It's got that grain In the film like It's an old film IS FOR A REASON these reviewers forget. They are looking for a slickly produced fast paced money making thrill ride. NOT THE MOVIE HE'S MAKING!  Notice the black & white scenes.  This was done great for what Quenton was trying to do.  I do agree about the \\"Why Does He Have To Have A Sensless Part In Every Movie.\\"  It's not a 5 star movie No but It's not trying to be.  And people are right the counterpart to this movie Rodrigous \\"Planet Terror\\" film was better! 5 star. Rose McGowan Is hot In both!! But has a much bigger part with the machine gun leg In Planet Terror. Good Luck   If your a fan you have nothing to worry about.

B001DJ7PN2|4.0|For most of his career as writer/director, Oliver Stone has associated himself with controversial movies.  None provoked discussion more than \\"JFK,\\" now available in an Ultimate Collector's Edition from Warner Home Video.  This powerful film about the mysteries surrounding the Kennedy assassination was nominated for eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Supporting Actor (Tommy Lee Jones).  The all-star cast includes Kevin Costner, Kevin Bacon, Gary Oldman, Jack Lemmon, Sissy Spacek, Joe Pesci, John Candy, Walter Matthau, Donald Sutherland, and Ed Asner.  The three-disc set includes 17 minutes not seen in theatres, the documentary \\"Beyond JFK: The Question of Conspiracy,\\" deleted scenes, five reproduction letters written by or to John F. Kennedy, a set of six character photo cards with the stars and bios of the real people they portray, and a 44-page book of rare behind-the-scenes production photos.

If you are a fan of \\"The Outer Limits\\" or \\"The Twighlight Zone\\" you might really like this book since it was like reading an episode of a story from one of those shows. The only reason I give it only four stars is that it felt as if the author could have done more with it in the end. It was like he got bored writing the story and punctuated with an ending.

B001ER4CNY|4.0|\\"I Dream of Jeannie: The Complete Series\\"  collects all five seasons of the comedy sitcom, which premiered in September, 1965.  Astronaut Tony Nelson (Larry Hagman) is on a space mission that aborts, forcing him to parachute onto a desert island.  While waiting for a rescue team, he finds an old bottle that has washed ashore.  When he opens the bottle, out pops a 2000-year-old, though quite well preserved, genie (Barbara Eden), who promptly regards Tony as her master, since he has set her free.     Returning to Florida with the rescue team, Tony soon discovers that no one will believe he has found a voluptuous genie, chalking his claim up to delusions caused by exposure to the elements.  To further complicate matters, the genie, named Jeannie, refuses to perform magic or ever appear for anyone except Tony.  During the last three seasons, Ms. Eden also played Jeannie's wicked twin sister.   The 20-disc set includes 139 episodes packaged in a limited- edition genie bottle, audio commentary with the show's stars, interviews with Barbara Eden and Larry Hagman, and collector's cards with photos, episode synopses, trivia, and cast profiles.
B000NVI1IO|1.0|This album sucks bad. I love AC/DC but this is lame. The songs are dull, uninspired and VERY forgettable. Satellite Blues and Safe In NYC are ok, but the rest of them are just plain bad. I think the biggest problem is more than likely that Brian Johnson doesn't take any part in the songwriting and it shows. Angus and Malcom are good songwriters, but the best post-Bon Scott era AC/DC songs have always been written by Angus, Malcom AND Brian.

Maybe next time George and Steve and Harrison will have a movie that doesn't just include aliens, refrigerators and Russians, maybe next time they will have Indy time warping, riding a camel while playing croquet, then battling Captain Kirk and Spock with lemons and finally retiring to Coral Gables Florida.<br /><br />Incidentally I gave this movie 5 stars because I feel sorry for the people who made this movie (not good to end the Indy series with this stinkburger), the people who paid good money to see it, and I also feel sorry for those who actually want to see this movie. It was misclassified as an action adventure..they should have billed it as sci fi comedy instead.
B001H5X7JS|4.0|\\"Tropic Thunder\\"  is a very funny spoof of Hollywood movie making starring Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey, Jr., Nick Nolte, Steve Coogan, and Matthew McConaughey.  A film crew is on location in Southeast Asia to make a film about the Vietnam War.  The filming is way over budget,  director Damien Cockburn (Coogan) incorporates dangerous methods to elicit believable performances from his pampered cast, and the actor/soldiers come into conflict with decidedly humorless drug runners.  Downey is a standout as Australian actor Kirk Lazarus, who's undergone a series of skin pigmentation treatments in order to play a black American soldier.  Aside from a slew of tepid jokes that never land, the basic premise is funny and the first five minutes of the film are particularly inspired, hysterical satire.  The two-disc Director's Cut contains several featurettes, deleted and extended scenes, an alternate ending, and video rehearsals.

0786948523|5.0|I believe this title to be a sold buy. Most people are distressing over the fluff that was left out of the book; I rather like this approach. It gives me as a DM the ability to customize most of my monster selection to what I need.     This title gives you everything to run monsters. Thats what it is a monster manual. The stats are streamlined into easy to read and run stat blocks, and the encounter experience is labeled right with each monster. Over-all this is a easy to use and master Monster Manual.     It is nothing more or less; if you are looking for a fluff filled book with more about the back story then tactics and stats find one of the upcoming specialized monster handbooks (for instance Open Grave).
1594201927|4.0|Niall Ferguson has written an easily accessible and very entertaining history of finance, ranging from the clay tokens of Mesopotamia 5,000 years ago to the hedge funds of today.  The title of this book has apparently been modelled on Jacob Bronowski's \\"The Ascent of Man,\\"  and like that book it will be made into a television series.  Being a television celebrity is not something that wins the admiration of one's peers in the history profession, to say the least.  But those little rebukes are relatively mild compared to the scorn he received for his political views in [[ASIN:0465023290 Empire: The Rise and Demise of the British World Order and the Lessons for Global Power]] and [[ASIN:0143034790 Colossus: The Rise and Fall of the American Empire]].  In those works he argued that empire was beneficial not only to the mother country but the dominated countries as well.  In this work he chronicles not only the history of money but also makes a case for liberalized finance.<br /><br />Ferguson examines the financial subplot behind some of the major historical powers such as the role of money in ancient Mesopotamia, the denarius in Roman society, and gold and silver in the civilization of the Incas.  He is very good in his descriptions of financial families like the Medicis and the Rothchilds, and how they became banking dynasties.  Another memorable episode was the rise of Amsterdam as the world's financial center and the center's subsequent shift to London.<br /><br />History is also filled with financial disasters of which we are well aware today.  Ferguson tells the story of John Law and how he became France's head of finance.  He engineered a financial bubble that took them several generations to overcome.  Making matters worse, it occurred at the same time as the British South Sea Bubble.<br /><br />Also instructive is the history of the first great globalization (1870-1914).  (For this period also read Jeffrey Frieden's [[ASIN:039332981X Global Capitalism: Its Fall and Rise in the Twentieth Century]].)  The world had become so economically interdependent that the pundits believed the possibility of war between great powers had been eliminated.  This sentiment was famously expressed in \\"The Great Illusion\\" by Norman Angell.<br /><br />Although this book was written before the current economic crisis, the last chapter is very prescient.  \\"From Empire to Chimerica\\" tells of the symbiotic relationship between China and America.  The combined country \\"accounts for just over a 10th of the world's land surface, a quarter of its population, and a third of its economic output, and more than half of the global economic growth of the last eight years\\".  This relationship, in which China saves and America spends, and in which China's savings is used to enable America to spend even more, is clearly unsustainable.  Ferguson sees this savings glut as the cause of the current subprime crisis.  That, in my humble opinion, was one of the causes; there were many bad actors involved in this catastrophe, citizen-borrowers included.<br /><br />Although it is not obvious to everyone in the midst of a crisis,  Ferguson correctly points out that financial engineering is one of the great forces behind human progress.  The history of finance is a process of creative destruction.  Financial risk-taking is necessary for economic expansion and human development, and Ferguson does a good job in making the case.

B00138H7YK|5.0|This album was suffering the fate of many of the things I have on vinyl, which means it's been sitting unplayed on the shelf.  I don't listen to the radio any longer (does anyone?) so I've not had the occasion to listen to much queen.<br /><br />Amazon had this release on special, so I purchased and downloaded it.  It was refreshing to listen to again, almost as if for the first time, though it did bring back a lot of good memories.<br /><br />This is a very strong album with a sold mix of music showcasing just how talented and versatile the band was.<br /><br />I guess I'm going to have to download the rest of the queen catalog now.
B001G5IJVK|2.0|Dont be fooled by the pretty picture and the hype about silver foiled logos etc etc. While the track listing is perhaps the best of any Kiss compilation so far, this release is cheap beyond belief. Nothing more than a flimsy  cardboard slipcase over a basic foldout digipak. While others are releasing quality boxsets (Sabbath's 'Rules of Hell', Scorpions 'Box Of Scorpions' to name but two), this set is woefully inadequate. Shame.
B0015GDVTU|5.0|It is very rare that after viewing a movie I want to watch it again, this movie was so good, I re-watched it immediately.  Yes it is that good.<br /><br />I will state that I'm a guy, and yes by the end of the film the flood gates were open.  You will definitely want to keep the tissues handy while viewing.<br /><br />The movie takes you through a whole range of emotions, from crying tears of sadness, to tears of joy, and back again.<br /><br />The characters are wonderful, the story is great, the soundtrack is awesome.  A+++ all the way.<br /><br />What are you waiting for, watch the movie already.<br /><br />Happy Watching!

B0010DRYRI|2.0|the movie is stellar, the people who mastered this dvd should be ashamed.  This is for the 1997 & Jan 08 re-release of this movie.  I owned the 1997 release and they split the movie half on side 1, the other on side 2.  I thought the re-release, which I repurchased,  would have the movie on 1 side, as technology has improved immensely, it was just the same horrible sub VHS copy as my original dvd.  Having the movie as a \\"flipper\\" is impractical.  I hope the blue-ray release will be remastered and for those who purchase won't be subjected to a grainy pixelated version.<br />Very sad to see this movie put out this way.  Again brilliant movie!  Horrible DVD.
B001FB55TO|4.0|'Poppy' Cross has one of those unfortunate names. This cheery grade school teacher has never had a cross moment in her life. Instead, she sails on through in bright colors, chunky heels, and an unsinkably happy outlook. Even her response to a painful chiropractic crunch is to laugh at it. If you can imagine Annie Hall in short skirts and brilliant hues, you've got Poppy's attire nailed - always wrestling at least one oversized bag, lots of bits and pieces flapping in the breeze.<br /><br />A few things save this from silly pointlessness. Rather than simple mania, Poppy's bright view of the world is a choice, one that she maintains with effort that rarely shows. The effort does come out, once in a while, though, like when she deals with that troubled child in her class, wound-too-tight sister, homeless man, or stalker. They cut to her serious core - but, if wounds healed the way blows to Poppy's optimism do, most emergency rooms would shut down for lack of business.<br /><br />I could have wished for a little more closure regarding that troubled child. And, more than once, Poppy crossed the line into genuinely annoying - but only occasionally, and she's pathologically forgivable. On the whole, it's a fun if forgettable bit of fluff.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
0930289234|5.0|I will be honest and say here that I read this graphic novel because of the upcoming movie and sudden hype. I can almost hear the old-school fans cursing me right now.<br />So I read this, and I truly, absolutely enjoyed. I remembered reading something about the ending and the general, uh, emotion it brings, but it still wasn't what I expected at all. The ending was a total shock, and I'm amazed at how genius it was.<br />The characters had great depth, it was interesting to read about people that lived in the type of world they did. As with other graphic novels, I love it when the idea of a downside to having heroes, or superheroes around is explored.<br />I enjoyed the character, I enjoyed the plot, I enjoyed the entire thing and I hope very much that the film won't be a let down.
B000GPIPT2|4.0|Given that I already own [[ASIN:B0001CNRNO The Monster Legacy Collection (Frankenstein / Dracula / The Wolf Man)]] (busts and all), I hemmed, hawed, and read other reviews prior to purchasing the 75th Anniversary Edition. However, an Amazon seller listed an offer I couldn't refuse, so I bit and, all things considered, have no cause for regrets.<br />The Good: First, the print looks and sounds better than the previous releases. Nice and clean with deep blacks, good contrast, and very little damage, the video is solid and a pleasure to watch. However, I'm especially appreciative of the audio remastering--it sounds terrific for the first time (at least in my opinion).<br />A treasure trove of juicy extras are included, the jewel in the crown being Kevin Brownlow's Universal Horror, which I've caught on TCM. Also to be found are Karloff: The Gentle Monster, Monster Tracks (informative pop-ups that appear throughout the feature; I especially enjoyed this one), The Frankenstein Files, a corny-but-cute short (that presages Fractured Flickers) called Boo!, archives including still photos and posters, a theatrical trailer, and two commentary tracks--the only extras I haven't explored. I think the goodies alone are worth investing in the upgrade (despite getting a bit repetitive at times). The various subtitles include English, and the disks are dual-layer--a welcome upgrade from the cheapo \\"flippers\\" used in [[ASIN:B0001CNRLQ Frankenstein - The Legacy Collection (Frankenstein / Bride of / Son of / Ghost of / House of)]].<br />The Bad: Enough for a one-star demerit. Let's not lose sight of the fact that this is Universal, and not the B-studio described by Gloria Stuart in one of the documentaries as being \\"like a family,\\" but the gouging, skinflint mega-conglomerate of today. So rather than assemble a perfect package, Universal presents a cheesy one instead. I opened the case and discovered that neither of the trays was affixed to the backing; the glue had come loose...but not before it had torn some of the art behind it in the process. I was pretty much able to align them up for re-gluing so that the damage didn't show, but that didn't repair the breaks that had occurred in the trays themselves. In addition, I detected a tumor-like lump on the back of the case. \\"Biopsy\\" revealed a blob of silicone adhesive. I carefully removed the product information sheet that had been so sloppily applied (clearly, Universal has found a  way around child labor restrictions) and saw that it concealed a beautiful rendering of Karloff as The Monster. Predictably, the fact that the other side of this sheet could have been put to better use as a chapter index, didn't occur to whoever designed the packaging. A pity--touches such as this mark the distinction between a good marketing effort and a great one. Also, the aforementioned Monster Tracks can be difficult to read if they appear over credits; more attention should have been paid to this. And finally, Universal Horror?

A pity--touches such as this mark the distinction between a good marketing effort and a great one.

031606792X|1.0|I cannot imagine what might have gone through the author's mind to cause her to write a book like this one. I read up until somewhere in Jacob's Book, and I could not go on.<br />It made no sense whatsoever. Somehow Edward and Bella have a child, even though in all their years, none of the local vampires have ever heard of a hybrid baby. The baby in itself should not exist, because it's not possible for Edward to have a child. Yes, I know Meyer has explained this already, but her explanation failed at logic.<br />Worse than that, Jacob imprints on the baby. Renesmee, I mean. Are you kidding me? How can people not see how totally weird that is? Why do people think this is romantic, when it's actually totally sick?<br />I'm glad this is the end of it, I don't want Meyer to continue her career as an author. She shouldn't have written Twilight to begin with, but she really dropped the bomb with Breaking Dawn. Terrible, absolutely terrible.
1595141979|5.0|I love the Vampire Academy series and Shadow Kiss is by far my least favorite and my favorite. I liked it all the way up to the ending. I don't want to spoil it for anyone but I just want to say REALLY? Seriously? It was a complete let down and I think that it was the wrong place/path to go with Dimitri. Seriously after everything she has been through you do this?     Now getting that out. It was good, but I doubt I will read the next because of this book. It just sucks to much.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Taylor Swift is simply amazing.  Sophomore slump?  I think not.  Thirteen more self-written songs, one more Billboard #1 album.  Guaranteed.  Those that say they were expecting a more \\"mature\\" album from Swift's second album...are you kidding me?  She's EIGHTEEN.  Get over it.  This girl has written more hits in three years than most solid country performers write in an entire career.  With all due respect to Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood, this girl IS country music right now.  Buy this album.  Better yet, don't.  You'll be hearing nearly all of Swift's newest releases blared through the airwaves of America's country AND pop radio stations soon enough.
B001AKJ97O|5.0|Possessing perhaps one of the most gorgeous voices to come out of popular music in recent times, Adele is full of soul and (perhaps most importantly) heart. If you want a change from the Britneys, Kellys, even Beyonces and Rhiannas, do yourself a favor and give this profoundly talented songstress a good long listening to. Her music may lack the synthetic pop polish of most female artists these days but I do not find that to be a flaw in even the smallest way.<br /><br />Personal Favorites:<br />* Track 12: Hometown Glory<br />* Track 1: Daydreamer<br />* Track 3: Chasing Pavements<br />* Track 9: Make You Feel My Love<br />* Track 8: Right as Rain<br /><br />Least Favorite:<br />* Track 6: Melt My Heart to Stone - put here simply because it is my least favorite, but I do not dislike it by any means.
B000YAA68C|5.0|P.S. I love you is a very good movie.  Though the movie starts out in a 10 minute argument followed by complete confusion if you haven't read a review it tackles and tugs on every emotion a movie goer should have for this type of film.  From a males perspective, it was a little tough to get into at first but the movie grows on you as it continues.  Though my wife was multiple times from the first 10 minutes on the emotions gradually grew on me as well.    The story is really about true love and how it can continue on after death.  It is also a story of a husband who over time gives his surviving wife the ability to move on with her life as she knows it.  There are times when you want to cry, laugh, smile and just think about the story of this movie and imagine that something like this really could happen.      The movie at times can frustrate you all the way until the end but aren't unexpected movie endings something all viewers crave?  You will get that and more in P.S. I love you.  After I watched I thought this is a 4 star movie but thinking about it a day later I realized there are not many films out there that can grab every sense of emotion you have and pull you along for the ride.  So it is a post movie 5 star rating.  Enjoy
0930289234|5.0|There's not much more one can say about this comic that hasn't already been said. Let me give a warning about this series, at least. It's not for everybody. Some people may think comics are just about mindless action and silly plot. This comic is very captivating. Alan Moore attempts to deconstruct the superhero, laying its soul bare for the reader. Alan himself said the comic was meant to be read very slowly, with the reader constantly referencing previous pages in order to fully understand how the plot will unfold. Readint this requires a lot of effort on the part of the reader.<br /><br />But if you do put in the effort, you will experience the single greatest comic story ever. Ethics and morality within the superhero universe is put in a new light when the greatest single evil act in comic book history becomes, quite possibly, the greatest good act ever. Only someone with the genius of Alan Moore can do that.<br /><br />It is easy to go on and on about this comic, but many others have already put it far better than I. Please, give this comic a chance. You will not regret it.

B000GRUS22|5.0|El mejor disco del \\"segundo capítulo de Enigma\\", como llamó Michael Cretu al cambio que hizo empezando por \\"Voyageur\\" y que ha seguido hasta el más reciente \\"Seven lives, many faces\\". Esto sí es evolución. Ni trata de imitar viejos estilos como en E7, ni trata de volver el proyecto a su lado más pop como en E4, y tiene una línea como en sus primeros cuatro discos, o sea, que tiene una temática que se \\"discute\\", por así decirlo, a lo largo del disco, y son los descubrimientos y confesiones de la ciencia, además de metáforas con el cosmos y la vía láctea.

It won FIVE ACADEMY AWARDS and has taken hundreds of millions dollars. It's the surprisingly simple story of Maria(JULIE ANDREWS), a nun who's Governess to the rigidly disciplined children of an Austrian Military Captain(CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER). She so enchants him that he breaks off his engagement to a socialite baroness. In the meantime, Maria, teaches the children to sing and the whole family is soon giving a concert in Salzburg, after which they flee the country to escape the Nazis.

B001GQSY5K|4.0|I just finished watching `The Clone Wars' & to be honest it was pretty good. No it's not as good as the movies & it's not as intense as the Samurai Jack-esk `Clone Wars' shorts from 2003 but then again it's NOT supposed to be like ANY of those. It's like comparing apples to oranges.   ALSO keep in mind that Lucas is trying to broaden his appeal to kids with this movie's style & story telling as well as with the series on CTN so it's going to be, over all, a bit more simple in its execution but no less entertaining. Don't watch this expecting an Oscar performance. It is a CGI CARTOON! how frick'n serious/ critical are you supposed to take it? The action has more of an Episode 2 feel to it, for me at least, but the action sequences are just as long, fun & still `edgy' for a kid's CGI cartoon. They flowed well & were non-stop action. Clone troopers got it pretty bad in this movie and the lightsaber fights left me wanting more. They were pretty good for CGI though. It held my interest. The dialogue could have used a little help but what star wars movie couldn't? I wouldn't recommend buying this movie until you see it first but if you keep in mind the target audience is more kid than adult & remember what this movie is supposed to be/ do & you don't take it as seriously as some, then you should have fun & you'll be just fine.  Anakin's apprentice is there for the young girls as well as to be the little miss know it all pain in the butt for Anakin the way he was to Ben (it's called irony). She does shoot her mouth off a bit much so she may be a bit annoying for some out there (I didn't find her that annoying but she could use some work) but comparable to jar jar? Not even close.  `TCW' story line isn't a major one in the Star Wars universe; it feels more like a made for TV movie, but it does initiate the TV series so there is a broader story to set up here as well.   Simple, aims at a broader audience (hint.... kids) & still a fun watch, if only once, in my opinion.  I say rent it first, watch it for what it is & go from there.
045122499X|5.0|I just finished World Without End and I'm now mourning it.  I'm so sad that it's over.  I savored every page of that book...couldn't wait to crawl in bed at night and devour every page.  I think I liked it even better than Pillars of the Earth and I loved that book.  I crave a sequel desperately.
0345451325|5.0|My rating is 1 being the worst 10 being the best, 112. That's not a typo. This story is a grabber and could cause you to read it in one night! Yes, it's that amazing.  That has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that I like the games.  This story is way better than the story of halo 1,2, and 3.
B0019HQIFE|5.0|I have a very cheap surround sound connected to my Blu-Ray (Wal-Mart Durabrand) and let me just say, \\"the sound was incredible\\". I have seen a lot of DVD concerts but I have yet to see one that had the ability to engulf you into the concert. At one point of the show I had to remind myself that I was at home. I really did forget, and I think that has a lot to do with the way the sound was mastered. I highly recommend this Blu-Ray disc and any Concert that has the DTS sound available. I am now searching for a really nice surround sound system without the included DVD player that it seems all of them come with now. I will never abandon my Blu-ray Player again.
0446402389|5.0|Child 44 was published with great critical acclaim, so much that I, someone who normally doesn't read suspense novels, was intrigued. The novel, written by a young recent graduate of Cambridge, deals with a MGB agent Leo and his wife Raisa during Stalinist Russia.<br /><br />The fascist regime tests Leo's loyalty by giving him a choice that has the cruel magnitude of the story of Abraham: Denounce his innocent wife as a traitor, which will result in her execution, or he and his wife can live, but they will be stripped of their middle-class jobs and be exiled as peasants in the Russian rural countryside. Leo cannot denounce his wife, so she and he must languish in squalid conditions.<br /><br />It is while living in the countryside that they become aware that there is a sociopathic serial killer on the loose. But what offends the State is not the serial killer; rather, the idea that crime could exist in their \\"utopia.\\" The government covers up the crime and would rather live in denial as innocent children are killed, but Leo and his wife, the novel's heroes, have other plans.<br /><br />The novel's tone, happily, avoids the clich&eacute; of most suspense novels. The Stalinist world is concretely rendered as are its cruel machinations, which some would call \\"Kafkaesque.\\" Somehow this young author has written a masterpiece. Aspiring crime and suspense novelists, and even published ones, have good reason to be jealous. Highly recommended.
031606792X|2.0|I waited for \\" Breaking Dawn\\" and I was so excited to buy it. I stayed up until midnight to buy it which I havent done since the 7th Harry Potter. I had my own theories about how the  book would end. I would have liked to see this final book be about Bella and Edward adjusting to marriage and maybe holding off her transformation. Instead it was frankly, dissappointing. First of all I think Renneesme was completely unneccessary. Instead of seeing interactions between Edward and Bella we are forced to endure page after page of Bella and Reneesme. The only time we hear of Edward is when Bella is transformed and wants to have sex! There was even a part of the book that I skipped, there is a scence where Jacob is talking with the pack and it goes on and on and on I had to skip ahead. Then there was the lackluster ending with the \\" fight\\" between the Cullens and the Volturi. That was page after page of standing in the meadow. I did like \\" Twilight\\" but after that I feel the series because of being dragged out for so long lost some of it's magic. I liked it but I definetely had some big problems with it.

B00005RTSN|4.0|The 2001 album Ten New Songs is quite subdued and at first listen all the songs have the same slow gentle sound. But the old magic' emerges on classics like In My Secret Life, Love Itself, The Land of Plenty and the elegant Alexandra Leaving. Cohen covers familiar themes and one even recognizes lines from earlier songs, e.g. \\"I do what I am told,\\" (That Don't Make It Junk), while the mood of The Land Of Plenty reminds me of Heart With No Companion from the [[ASIN:B0012GMW7A Various Positions]] album, a devotional filled with resignation and acceptance.<br /><br />By The Rivers Dark refers to Psalm 137 about remembering Zion and singing a song to the Lord by the rivers of Babylon. The most explicitly spiritual song, The Land of Plenty, is the highlight of the album and stirring in its melancholy and honesty: \\"For what's left of our religion/I lift my voice and pray/May the lights in the land of plenty/Shine on the truth some day\\". I enjoy Cohen's unusual excursions like [[ASIN:B0012GMVY4 Death of a Ladies' Man]] and the esoteric [[ASIN:B0012GMX3S Recent Songs]] as much as his 1960s acoustic style so I have no problem with the synth-pop production. I love Sharon Robinson's vocals as backing and where she duets with him on tracks like Boogie Street and the exquisite Alexandra Leaving.<br /><br />For about five decades Cohen has been constructing a magnificent body of work that stands up to serious scrutiny and the passage of time. What a pleasure then, to have these ten additional songs of sublime artistry as his first offering of the new millennium. Not everybody will consider these tracks on a par with his most memorable songs and lots of fans will probably not care very much for the production. The follow-up, 2004's [[ASIN:B0002MPTDO Dear Heather]] is even better and more varied.
B0014DZ2VO|5.0|For the first time, James Bond appears to have a past.  This film follows right on the final scene of [[ASIN:B000MNP2KI Casino Royale]], building the idea that in the previous movie we got only a glimpse of something larger.  Bond is torn between grief and duty--the first time I recall that we've seen him aware of the consequences of his own actions--and we get to glory in the action-drenched halo of that grand internal conflict.<br /><br />But that doesn't mean the Bond formula is squandered.  He still has a flair for camera-friendly action, a keen awareness of who is the good guy and who is the enemy, and an unerring ability to charm the clothes off beautiful women like Gemma Atherton.  And, just as in the last film, he has eschewed his former high-tech mode of espionage in favor of a more visceral physicality in his confrontations.<br /><br />This is not to say that he has no tech.  His home base at MI6 has state-of-the-art surveillance and recon equipment.  But Bond himself identifies enemies by taking their picture with his camera phone, and his weapons are off-the-shelf models.  This makes Bond a much more powerful figure when he overcomes his own low-tech limitations and proves himself better equipped than hoi-polloi like you and me.  Well, like me anyway.<br /><br />The story turns around the environmental damage humanity has wreaked on the world, and the fear that when rich and powerful people get behind environmentalism, they may not be doing it for good reasons.  It is also highly critical of American and EU involvement in the domestic affairs of other nations.  It implies that First-World forces may well be nefarious operators in the larger world.  If you believe that the rich are good people, or that US foreign affairs are always noble, you may walk out of this film with a chip on your shoulder.<br /><br />Some trademark action scenes run a little long, and are awfully close together in such a short film (only 106 minutes).  Some of the early chase scenes in particular run about a third longer than they require to drive their point home.  In saying that, I have to stress that they don't hurt the movie that much.  I remember watching [[ASIN:B0000AXE8I The Matrix Reloaded]], where some of the action scenes lasted over fifteen minutes and felt like they were stealing from the story.  No such problem here: the story feels tight and direct.  I just wish the action would be more concise so we could get to the next step.<br /><br />I know some people dislike Daniel Craig's Bond: too young, too blond, too rough-cut and jagged.  But if you liked Craig's last entry in the fold, this movie will carry your enjoyment forward.  A brutal, in-yer-face James Bond, the gritty realism of this version of the character is an insight into the world of black ops in this post-Cold War world.  Breathless and mighty.rd longer than they require to drive their point home.  In saying that, I have to stress that they don't hurt the movie that much.

B0000931OG|5.0|Blur is a band that instead of starting off great and slowly becoming dull, it is the exact opposite. They started off somewhat bland and just got better and more strange. However, instead of taking their music to a more psychedelic level higher than 13, they actually pretty much dropped their odd music compositions altogether. What they came up with instead was an album full of rhythm and beautiful melodies they have rarely tackled before. The hidden track, \\"Me, White Noise\\" while not, let's say, spectacular, it is a satisfying dance techno song that will stay in your head for a few days. Once \\"Ambulance\\" starts, however, you will really get a good taste of the what the album has to offer: pretty harmonies with interesting instrumentation and vocals that will instantly change your mood between sad and happy contentment with just a change of syllable. The next song \\"Out of Time\\" is even better than the previous. I usually don't prefer Blur singles over the other tracks, but I find myself thinking about this song so many times because it's just that beautiful of a song. Then we get to songs like \\"Crazy Beat\\" and \\"We've Got a File on You\\" that completely kills your original mood and instead makes room for loud fast rock songs. I'm not saying this is a bad thing. In fact, I love it. Both songs have such interesting instrumentation and other sounds that it hard to be bored with them. \\"Jets\\" is something everyone has to hear. It reminds me of 13's Caramel and Trimm Trabb in that it uses a simple melody and builds into six minutes of masterpiece. The album closes with one of the most beautiful final tracks (or tracks in general) I have ever heard, \\"Battery In Your Leg.\\" If you are worried about listening to this album because of the absence of Graham Coxon, do yourself a favor and listen to it. Their is neither a \\"dud\\" nor a \\"filler\\" on here. Every song has something great to offer. This isn't a diverse pop album like Parklife. This isn't an intense psychedelic journey like 13. This is an album that delivers gorgeous music and shows that Blur is still not afraid of change.
B00000K0DQ|3.0|It's super easy to tell the Robbins/Sarandon mindset on the issue of capital punishment by watching this movie. While it is well made and engaging, they chose to tell the story in a way which leaves little doubt about their feelings on the issue. That's not a bad thing, but it took some of the impact out of it for me, by overtly dramaticizing certain scenes, particularly the drawn out climax. It just took it to a politicized ending for me , rather than a singularly compelling one. That aside, Sarandon and Penn both performed well, although the characters situations lend themselves to heavy drama, presumeably any good actors forte.
B001F0RAL6|5.0|Like all Michael Connelly books this is great reading. I enjoyed it from the very beginning to the very end.  I highly recommend it.
B0014DZ2VO|4.0|My love affair with James Bond extends back to at least 1995.<br /><br />That was the Thanksgiving season that brought us Goldeneye and the Pierce Brosnan era of Bond.<br /><br />To be sure, I'd seen the Connery Bond films. I'd chuckled at the Roger Moore films. I'd skipped the Timothy Dalton entries.<br /><br />I actually think Pierce Brosnan was a great Bond...who was saddled with some less than stellar scripts. It wasn't his fault that Tomorrow Never Dies featured an evil newspaper owner as a villain.<br /><br />I was surprised when Brosnan was replaced after Die Another Day, the highest grossing Bond film up until that point.<br /><br />That said, I enjoyed Casino Royale a lot.<br /><br />Quantum of Solace is that rare breed of Bond film that serves as a direct sequel to Casino Royale.<br /><br />Part of what makes Bond films work so well is that you come into the film with the basic knowledge of Bond, M, and Moneypenny are. (Speaking of poor Moneypenny...where the hell was she in Quantum?)<br /><br />Quantum requires, to a certain extent, that you have watched Casino Royale on DVD recently.<br /><br />I haven't seen Royale since it was originally in theaters...and found myself expected to know quite a bit about who and what had transpired in the previous film.<br /><br />I pretty much remembered that the love of Bond's life, Vespa, who had betrayed him had been killed at the end of Royale and that we'd learned of a sinister organization that was bigger than anyone at MI6 had assumed.<br /><br />That was about it.<br /><br />I was unable to recall which actors played any of the surrounding characters that survived from Royale, and the director of Solace sees little reason to use any sort of flashbacks to ignite sparks of recognition in the audience.<br /><br />Still, I enjoyed the film...<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />  * Daniel Craig is Bond. As much as I loved Pierce Brosnan...it's hard for me to imagine anyone else drinking those shaken martinis.<br />  * Some great action sequences...and an especially thrilling sequence that demostrates why you probably shouldn't build a home, hotel, or fortress that is powered by hydrogen fuel cells.<br />  * Judy Dench is top notch at M. I think this is my favorite of her appearances.<br />  * Awesome musical score by David Arnold. Arnold has scored every Bond film since Tomorrow Never Dies, and he gets it. 90% of the feel of a Bond film is accomplished via the music...and he makes it feel like a Bond film...even if we don't see too many of the cheesy gadgets or hear a ton of groan inducing puns/one liners from Bond.<br />  * A relatively easy to follow plotline. Despite the fact that you should revisit Casino Royale prior to seeing this film...you'll still be able to follow the plot. Revenge translates well...and the main scheme that the villain has hatched is actually rather pedestrian when taken in context of the bizarre and overwrought schemes of previous Bond villains. (No high powered solar ice lasers here.)<br />  * Bond continues to demonstrate that functioning alcoholics are prime material for secret agent status.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />  * As I mentioned..the film expects you to remember bit actors from the previous film...and the impact of some scenes is negated by the fact that you feel like you're supposed to know who the hell they are.<br />  * Some annoying hand held camera work...especially during the opening chase/car sequence.<br />  * Improbable product placement for Ford Motor Company. Yes...the American auto industry is in trouble...but I was still rather shocked to see so many characters driving Ford vehicles.<br />  * A few less than glamourous locations. One of the thrills of a Bond film is the vicarious travel. And I've never had much desire to travel vicariously to Hiati.<br />  * A lackluster villain. He was serviceable. But I found him nowhere near as sinister as Mr. White, who you see telling M that \\"...we have people everywhere...\\" in the trailer forthe film.<br />  * Once again this film continues the tradition started in Royale of having ridiculously ugly or oddly styled supporting characters. I don't know what the hell was up with the hair of the main henchman for the villain. I think I saw it flip up like a hair piece during one scene...but there is never really any explanation for why he looks so ridiculous. I suspect the main villain, who is rather homely himself, doesn't want to keep better looking henchman around.<br /><br />Final analysis: if you're a Bond film...you'll want to see this. It hits all the right notes. I lauged, I almost cried, and I found myself craving a martini.<br /><br />Score: B+on't know what the hell was up with the hair of the main henchman for the villain.

Peter Baumann keeps the focus on the \\"classic\\" sounds through piano, VCS3 and organ. Froese (guitar) and Franke (VCS3) also share duties on the organ.<br /><br />The centerpiece is the 20:27 of the title track, with Fauni Gena (10:47), Circulation of Events (5:52) and Wahn (4:29) providing a proper goodbye to what became known as  \\"The Pink Years\\" of the band's illustrious career.

1933492279|5.0|This book was first introduced to me by my best friend Score, Who is an Art Director at a huge corp..  I was blown away by the beauty of the Digital Art and the Very Imaginative Compositions. Some of the renderings are Just gorgeous.  I've read some of the criticism about this book, Which I must say has a lot to do with envy than the quality of the work in this book, \\"I'd like to see them do better\\". Being a Traditional artist myself,  I understand that compared to The Masters of Paint, Brush and Canvass, That create realisim and beauty manually, The Digital art can appear \\"fake\\" to some, But to consider the fact that one must instill into the computer all the physics needed to create an image the way the masters do manually can justify Digital as its own beautiful style of Art. Whether Paintbrush, Airbrush or Computer, The fact remains that the Artist's ability to compose a beautiful image from his or her minds eye regardless of the tools he or she uses, is what matters. This book verifies that. I just had to purchase this book to add to my collection.  It is now next to my collection of Boris Vallejo and Frank Frazetta, to name a few.  This Is One Beautiful Book!
B000CNESU8|5.0|For any of you who have never seen this movie, and you want to see a movie with an unusual story, this is a good one. It is timeless in expressing how fed up people can get with things around them, and whether they can make a splash in this world as they travel through...    I saw this movie 30 years ago but never forgot it. It was definitely worth rewatching. It amazes me how movies like this get overlooked in the television channel reruns....
B001EC9V58|4.0|\\"REC\\" is a Spanish horror film that follows the trend of films like [[ASIN:B0014Z4OQG Cloverfield]] and [[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]] by having the entire story told through the lens of a constantly-filming camera and throws in some of [[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later]]'s mad intensity to create a film that is annoyingly familiar in execution, but still a must-see.  In less than a year, Hollywood has managed to bang out a remake titled [[ASIN:B001E95ZRO Quarantine]].  What a disgrace. A copy of a copy of a copy.  As usual, the reasons the film had to be remade for American audiences are twofold: most Americans are believed to be functionally illiterate and will therefore flee from the sight or even thought of subtitles, or they are bigots who will not pay to see a movie that isn't packed with pasty skin, blonde hair, and familiar overpaid faces.  Do me a favor, America: PROVE THEM WRONG!  Do not pay your hard-earned cash to see these useless, unimaginative, and inferior remakes; buy the real deal even if it means getting a region-free DVD player.  Support true original horror regardless of nationality and quarantine crummy remakes.<br /><br />Oh, right; I had a movie review going on here.  Sorry about that.  In \\"REC\\", a young, beautiful reporter hosting a late night show is doing a story about firefighters working the graveyard shift entitled \\"While You're Asleep\\".  After a meet-and-greet and a few fluff segments our heroine  Angela and her cameraman, Pablo, follow the firefighters on a routine call.  They end up inside of an apartment building where a call was placed about a disturbance.  They head upstairs to check it out and see an old woman standing motionless in the dark, her clothes bloodied.  This sort of thing seldom ends well.  After some doings transpire, the residents, firefighters, policemen, and reporter duo find that the building has been sealed off and is surrounded by police threatening deadly force.  BNC (Biological, Nuclear, and Chemical) protocol is in effect on the entire building and nobody is getting out.  Nobody seems to know what's going on.  Then the killing starts.<br /><br />\\"REC\\" is unoriginal on several levels; essentially a hodgepodge of concepts and techniques that have come before, but it is damned effective because it only steals the best.  If you didn't like the style of \\"Cloverfield\\" or [[ASIN:B0013D8LA4 Diary of the Dead]] then you are unlikely to enjoy this either.  In fact, the camera might be even shakier on this one.  You'd think with a pro handling the camera, the picture would be more stable.  While there is nothing approaching the deep, dark, cutting social statements of Romero's work, there is a little bit to chew on.  While interviewing residents, Angela finds one man matter-of-factly rambling about his \\"Chinese\\" neighbors (they're Japanese) and their disgusting eating habits while essentially implying that they must be the root cause of the rumored infection.  This is so very true to life it almost hurts.  Blaming the foreigners never gets old no matter what country you live in.  A very nice touch.  As the story unfolds and the characters start to unravel, the pace of the film picks up substantially.  The result is several minutes of pure chaos.  The mystery infection can take minutes, hours, or days to manifest symptoms, making everybody in the building a liability.  Talk about tension.<br /><br />While the pacing is a bit slow at times, there are some amazing scenes.  Before I saw \\"REC\\", there had been only three children in cinema history that truly frightened me; [[ASIN:B0000524CY The Exorcist]], [[ASIN:B001AGNMI0 Pet Sematary]] and [[ASIN:B00000K3TO Night of the Living Dead]].  Add another to that list.  Jaw-dropping performance.  The final act is a masterpiece of suspense and intensity.  With the power cut and the police outside practically waiting for everyone inside to die, Pablo and Angela -with their camera as the only available light in the building (genius)- attempt to escape upstairs, hoping to find an attic leading outside.  What they find is a supposedly abandoned room that contains the answers to the story's mysteries and one of the most terrifying apparitions ever seen in a horror film.  There are some amazing shots, genuine scares, violence with a little gore, and plenty of screams along the way.  My God, are there screams.  I have to say that in spite of the fact that much of this had been done in previous films, I wanted more of \\"REC\\".  The film is a short hour and fifteen minutes and the ending was annoyingly abrupt and ended with lame music.<br /><br />Either you enjoy these kinds of films or you do not.  For fans of the emerging shaky-cam horror genre, this is for you.  If you're not a fan, either skip it or take some dramamine beforehand; this one's not for the faint-hearted.  A lesson in low-budget intensity in this movie.  It is unexceptional considering what has come before, but it is executed well enough to make it well worth a watch.  Consider \\"REC\\" a rec.<br /><br />Message from the soapbox, incoming...<br /><br />Let's face it, people: foreign horror is kicking our tails.  It has been for a decade at least. If we want America's sleeping horror giant to wake up again, we've got to stop supporting the sub-par recycled garbage that is piling on top of it.  That means saving your cash for the films that deserve it -independent, controversial, hardcore, R-rated, uncompromising HORROR- and forsaking all others.  No Tara Reids or Paris Hiltons, no PG-13s, no Paul Andersons or Michael Bays, and no more God-cursed remakes.  Take the money for that ticket and go buy a DVD of the original works instead.  It'll make you a real American hero.tairs, hoping to find an attic leading outside.

B001DTPZNY|3.0|Whoever wrote the script is largely responsible for this not being a great movie. Harrison Ford could have pulled off a convincingly \\"older but better\\" kind of guy given the right lines to say. My guess is that someone under 35 wrote the script.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|This is why I have a 5.1 setup at home.  I can't believe how good this sounds, it is absolutely incredible.  These are some of the greatest albums ever and it is so much fun to hear them like this.  Buy it!!!!!!!!
0805211063|5.0|i'm sitting in a cold, lonely room, headphones on, a lamp dimly gleaming on the nightstand next to me. i've just finished harman's translation of the castle, which i picked up from the library after finishing a muir translation i bought for 50 cents.<br /><br />the novel tells of the struggle of K., who believes that he's been invited to a town to do some land surveying, only to realize upon his arrival that his invitation was the result of a bureaucratic mishap. he wants answers from the officials at the castle that overlooks the town, but that can never happen - how K. deals with this stark reality constitutes the subsequent \\"action\\" of the novel.<br /><br />reading and thinking about this novel, i feel like K himself gazing upon the castle, doomed to forever struggle against forces beyond his control. i've now read this book twice in a month, and i still don't know what it means, and i don't think i ever will, and i still can't understand K's motivations, and i can't comprehend the workings of the castle or the village or the other characters K encounters. i'll let scholars try to pin down these things, because achieving any kind of certainty is not what this novel is about - if you're someone who'd be frustrated by something like this, don't bother reading. (besides - and i'm no philosopher - i think someone like kafka would resist attempts to assign concrete meanings to events, places, and people.)<br /><br />why does't K just go back to where he came from? why does he try to marry a village girl only a few days after his arrival even though he has a wife and child back at home? who are his new assistants, and what happened to his old assistants? is this village on earth? are the castle officials human? what is happening here?<br /><br />there are no answers to these questions. and yet - even though the world of the castle is but a blurred reflection of ours - the ways in which they are asked reveals an absolute truth about how our universe works.<br />i thinkin many respects, K's unending, doomed struggles to understand his situation and assign meaning to his unfamiliar surroundings mirror our own struggles to not only understand his predicament, but to understand our own lives and perhaps discover the purpose they hold. maybe there's nothing there at the end of our struggles, or maybe there's everything, or maybe we'll be cut off in mid-sentence on the most mundane of days, just like K., simply hoping for one more chance.<br /><br />in 2001: a space odyssey, arthur c. clarke imagines a world in which the transformation from ape to man was caused by utterly opaque, alien monoliths. despite their central importance to the ascension of humankind, their inner workings and their purpose and their function were mostly hidden, their mystery and necessary knowledge forever obscured. i think the castle is much like one of these monoliths - utterly inscrutable, and yet in the end, absolutely necessary.
B0015DWLAS|5.0|I just finished this trilogy last night and boy am I exhausted! The way I see it Sanderson owes me some extra sleep time as his story kept me awake longer than I should have and later than I'd like.<br />A greatly written plot, well planned and thought out from start to finish. The characters were superb and diverse, though at the very beginning I did find them slightly cookie cutter. But I give Sanderson immense credit, he changed that very quickly and as he became more comfortable writing them they gained more depth and diversity and by halfway through the first installment any doubts about this author had completely vanished.<br />Which left me with a wonderful story that still has me thinking about it. I'm an old veteran of the fantasy/sci-fi genre. I've read a lot over the (gasp) decades. This particular trilogy will have an honored place in my reccomendations. Congratulations Sanderson, you've impressed the hell out of this librarian!
B000065BPB|2.0|These headphones sound really good, provide excellent isolation for my daily train/bus trips back and forth from work.  Too bad though, that, after barely two months the right channel has shorted out and is completely dead. The retailer I purchased these from offer only a 15 day warranty, so I have to contact the manufacturer, and will [probably] have to spend more money to have them repaired or replaced.
B001GQSY64|5.0|Its not that this is a bad movie but as a 26 year old man with a love for Star Wars I really didn't enjoy this movie that much.  In fact, I dont see why there was a theater release b/c it looks more like direct to video.  I got the blu ray and was hoping for good bells and whistles but I wasn't impressed.  The audio quality I found was kind of a let down even though lightsabers usually sound about the same but on blu ray you kind of expect more.<br /><br />I don't know anything about the series coming out and perhaps if I did I would have enjoyed it more.  I did notice Obi Wans beard looked like he took square blocks and glued them around his face.  I did like seeing the clone troopers since the new movies didn't go too deeply into their squad tactics.  I was hoping for more clone fights and battles though.  Seeing them in action, even though it was cartoon like was nice.  I did think the story was relatively pointless and didn't make me get to the end and say \\"man that was pretty good\\".  Weird seeing the WB logo and no Star Wars intro at the beginning just the name of the movie.  I found a lot of the Star Wars music was missing in fact all of it was but you could tell it was Star Wars for the most part.  The humor of the droid army and pretty much the whole movie was more directed toward a younger audience which was o.k.<br /><br />My three year old daughter has autism and she gets a kick out of watching movies with flare and vivid colors.  This movie had that in the battle scenes and I could tell that though she can't talk her excitement showed clearly.  She doesn't know whats going on but she has a rare taste in these movies and even though she doesn't watch it like me I know she liked it.  At 1st I couldn't get her to watch the movie all she would do is lay in her bed and look at the movie case.  After that I think she got curious about what the case was and that was my five star rating, seeing her enjoyment.<br /><br />I watched Star Wars a lot when I was little and its great to see a new generation enjoying it hence my five star rating.  Since as far as I know the Star Wars saga is over I hoped this movie had been better.  It didn't really hurt the series but it didn't really add much to it.  Not the worst movie but not the best so I guess I would say it was o.k.a new generation enjoying it hence my five star rating.  Since as far as I know the Star Wars saga is over I hoped this movie had been better.  It didn't really hurt the series but it didn't really add much to it.  Not the worst movie but not the best so I guess I would say it was o.k.
1400082773|5.0|I am impressed by Obama's ability to analyze himself. In \\"Dreams from my Father,\\" he readily points out his adolescent flaws, frustrations, and misunderstandings in a way no sitting politician ever could. Historians should be very grateful that he wrote this before he ran for elected office. I cannot think of another memoir by a politician that seemed so unfiltered and human.    By the way, Obama is a beautiful writer. His sentences are smooth and at times lyrical. I look forward to having a president so well versed in the English language.
B00005JLD4|5.0|Director Philip Noyce has a solid reputation for his first-class film achievements, and adds another big feather in his cap with \\"Rabbit-Proof Fence\\". Many films have been made about intrusions from outsiders to change a native culture, whether our own Native Americans, Hawaiians, Amazonians, tribal Africans, etc. It's Australia's turn, and the horrible subject is handled with sensitivity and care. Plucked from their homes and families, 3 young girls are determined to find their way home. It's all the more remarkable that this is a true story, set in 1931. Production values are top-notch, from music (Peter Gabriel), photography (Christopher Doyle), Noyce's profound vision, and everyone else involved. The 3 incredible young stars (Everlyn Sampi, Laura Monaghan, Tianna Sansbury), all native Aborigines and all non-professionals, are totally natural in their handling of the material. Veterans Kenneth Branagh & David Gulpilil are on hand to provide necessary angst. The DVD has an excellent documentary, Following the Rabbit-Proof Fence, about the making of the film. Also a fine commentary track. Highly recommended; a fine history lesson and an achievement that belies it's Indie status.
0385340990|3.0|Not bad, but nothing really memorable either.  Very predictable plot points -- most seen coming from a mile away.  Interesting more for the factual information learned about the history of the occupation of Guernsey in WWII.
B001KPYNR0|5.0|Wow!  I had no idea that Enya was releasing another album.  When I learned about it I was excited all over again!  All is very beautiful, especially \\"The Spirit Of Christmas Past\\" which is sung so beautifully and elegant!  You are going to be in for a surprise, especially if your a dedicated fan, with \\"My! My! Time Flies!\\" but I will leave the surprise for you to listen!    Enjoy!
B00005JPO1|4.0|very interesting movie.  I liked the adventure and the action.  It was also interesting to see the references to events and previous movies.  I would say this is mostly a movie for fans of Indiana Jones.  A lot of the things that are mentioned here would be lost on someone that hadnt seen the earlier movies.  That being said, I liked it and will watch it more than just once or twice..
B000LAZDQA|5.0|Being a fan of Hedwig and the Angry Inch, I had some idea of what to expect from the genius mind of John Cameron Mitchell, but this film blew me away - so thought provoking, touching and at times laugh-out-loud funny. The cast is great, and it was good to see Miriam Shor (Hedwig and teh Angry Inch) making a cameo. All the perfomances were wonderful, but the thing that made this movie for me was the absolutely beautiful soundtrack which opened up a whole new world of music for me - as well as bringing in a few golden oldies like Anita O'Day in to round it out. Don't be put off by the sex - it's not gratuitous in its nature and really invites the viewer to examine and challenge their own views and ideas - and it is handled so truthfully that even the most uptight prude could not help but see something of themself in each of the characters and laugh. You'll definitely want to buy the soundtrack!
B000YABYLA|5.0|Genius, pure genius.  Janeane Garofalo's performance as Juno Maguffandorfer will resonate with fans for many a year.  \\"No, it's MORGAN FREEMAN got any bones that need collecting\\" brilliant, even oscar worhthy...........it did win for best screenplay come to think of it.  Diablo Cody's screenplay snap, crackles and pops with vibrant colorful euporhic uba-slang such as WIZARD, WHAT THE BLOG?, and HOMEOSKILLET MY DARLIN JIM DIDIT WODUNNIT POPASQUASH SUMMIT?  My fave scene's when our prego hero is somehow eating lunch in an opened trophy case with her friend and there's a big, fat RAMONES sticker behind her.  Howed they get in there, and more importantly, howed the sticker get in there.  Director right before Juno scene is to be shot:  \\"OK OK, make sure we got's plenty of random punk stikas in da backround.  Crew suggestion: \\"uhh how bout green day, or blink 182\\".  Director: \\"No no, REAL PUNK, not that MTV crap\\".  Rock on Juno
031606792X|1.0|{1st, all mine were in the form of \\"Audio Books\\"   Not Hard Cover. Guess I clicked on the wrong Link}    I loved the 1st book so much I went online and ordered all the rest and they arrived JUST as I finished my 1st book. In a matter of 3 days time, I was done with the 1st 3 audio books and so excited to hear the last and finale chapter so I could envision all of Bella and Edwards stunning Wedding Details.    (What a Waste) not much said about the wedding really or the dress but there are much better parts to come anyway.     The rest of the Book was Pretty darn good and although Most People here (giving reviews) say the \\"fight sceen\\" towards the end of the book wasnt worth \\"listening\\" to or \\"reading\\" (which ever you did) it was and I found it VERY NECESSARY to the Stories Plot Line.  You get to learn about a WHOLE Lot More about other Vampires Lives (well not \\"lives\\" really) but what they do and such. and their \\"Families\\" and \\"Powers\\"    I don't know about the plot line in the Hard or Soft Cover Books, but I can say that without a doubt the AUDIO Books (all 4 of them) are Fantastic and held my interest the entire time {with exception to Bella getting Pregnate}  A VAMPIRE IS DEAD. He Cannot MAKE BABIES! Not in his Dead Lifetime not in any Other WRITER of Vampires LIFETIME has a Vampire made an Actually Baby with a Human, yet there it was, Bella telling Edward: I THINK IM PREGNANT!\\"  In my opinion that is Just DUMB, but a Big part of the 4th story so it IS necessary. In addition, it's fully explained!    And if I recall from someone else's review they said they hated it when Jacob had to DIE and been torn to shreds in the end! Well all I can say about that is: WHAT BOOK WE'RE YOU READING??? It didn't happen in the audio book at all  it was a GREAT ENDING ~ or as they say In STORY BOOK LAND: They All Lived Happily EVER AFTER     Tomorrow I'm going to see the Movie with my Son and his Girlfriend...the reviews say it Blows.. I don't GO BY REVIEWS. I will judge for myself...as should everyone else HERE    All I can say is EVERYONE of  the Audio books in this Series were GREAT and staying in my Collection  And  I'm sure if the Movie(s) hold true to the Books story line.. they will be just as good as the Audio Book (Books)    P.S.    I don't know how a \\"ONE STAR Rating\\" showed up ON THE TOP of my Review  but I give ALL 4 AUDIO BOOKS 5+ STARS and I hope she writes more in the future about Bella & Edwards baby as she grows up.. In addition, her \\"possible\\" new FRIEND / Lover / Rival ~ and about Charlie and Sue Hooking up.... THAT would make for other Great Plot Lines      P.S.S I did HATE Jacobs Narration, Just hated it in this book. It should have been Bella, alone speaking in all 4 books for each person.
B0012GMZ4U|5.0|Out of the 60+ albums of an artist whose career has spanned over 45 years, I would have to choose this one as my favorite.  Barbra's voice, in 1966, was at its youthful peak.  Her presentation and phrasing are unique and excellent, and the fact that the album is half in French gives it a touch of sophistication and culture, so much so that I don't believe it can ever be equalled by any other American artist.  The CD begins powerfully as \\"Free Again\\" and Barbra's interpretation of the very popular and oft-covered \\"What Now My Love\\" elevate popular music to nearly an operatic level, with the latter in particular being a tour de force all by itself.  \\"Autumn Leaves\\" is supremely tasteful in its elegant spareness of production - just Barbra and strings.  \\"Ma Premiere Chanson\\", \\"Speak to Me of Love\\" and \\"Once Upon a Summertime\\" are as drenched in French atmosphere as a stroll down the Champs-Elysees at sunset.  In \\"I Wish You Love\\", as with \\"What Now My Love\\", Barbra shows her artistry with both ballads and up-tempos in one song.  (This song, by the way, was used to haunting effect in the film \\"Eye of the Beholder\\", but it wasn't Barbra's version.)  And \\"I've Been Here\\" sounds fiercely triumphant in both the English version and the French (\\"Le Mur\\").  Alors, Mesdames et Messieurs, popular adult contemporary music just doesn't get any better than this, the creme de la creme from a timeless artist who strives for excellence and perfection in each and every endeavor.  There's help from modern technology, too;  the digital remastering makes something that sounded wondrous in 1966 sound even better.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|After 3 highly successful albums, Coldplay have reached the stage where they can let go a bit in their music. `Viva la Vida or Death and all his friends' does exactly that, it is like their equivalent of Radiohead's `Kid A'. Despite the annoyingly long title, it seems now that it is widely accepted that the `Viva la Vida' is the much preferred shortening of the title.  This is shown through the front cover of the album which doesn't even mention the latter part of the album title.    `Parachutes', `Rush of Blood to the Head' and `X &Y', for me was a progression as each album was better than the previous.  Although the sound varied slightly from album to album, the song choice was always the same.  For instance, the slow ballad which looks at the positives in a extremely negative situation; From `Parachutes', this was `Everything's not Lost', from `Rush of Blood to the Head', this was `Amsterdam' and then arguably one of the best songs they have ever done, `Fix You' from `X & Y'.  When looking for this kind of track on `Viva la Vida'; none can be found.  This is just one example of how this album has got a completely different feel to it than the previous 3. It feels more structured and there is a natural order to the songs which come together to tell a story.  Whereas the other albums are more like albums created to make the best singles; this is more like an album created to make the best album and if any singles came out of it, it would be a bonus.    Coldplay's change in approach to this album can be heard instantly through the first track, `Life in Technicolor'.  You expect the headlines in the music press to be `Coldplay in instrumental shocker'.  As you don't expect Coldplay to do an instrumental, but that is just the start of how this album is a huge leap forward in the bands creativity.  I cannot think of a more appropriate name for this track as it makes the album come to life right from the get go and it is so uplifting and refreshing. The track blends into the second track; `Cemeteries of London' nicely as Martin's soft vocals comes in with, `At night they would go walking till the breaking of the day'.    All of the tracks on this album are great.  My personal favourites include `42', `Lovers in Japan' and `Strawberry Swing'. `42' starts off with just slow piano and Martin's vocals before Buckland, Berryman and Champion come in and set the song alight.  As Martin explodes into the chorus `You thought you might be a ghost, you didn't get to heaven but you made it close' where he also gives up the piano to add to the vibe with the electric guitar.  It feels like he is talking about someone who feels like he is invisible to everyone else even though he does all the right things, he is not fully appreciated.   `Lovers in Japan' on the other hand starts off with an upbeat piano along with the rest of the crew and is just a joyous, energising song.  `Strawberry Swing' is more of a kick back song as it is nice and relaxing. The melody is magical and Martin's vocals are of the same high standard as displayed on the rest of the album.  The imagery which this song portrays is one of beauty and happiness, `It's such a perfect day'.    One of the only criticisms I have about this album which slightly annoy me is the dual tracks - `Lovers in Japan/Reign of Love' and `Yes/Chinese Sleep Chant'.  The latter songs in both of I feel are better served as intermittent tracks in their own right.  `Chinese sleep chant' especially is great as you feel like you are soaring through the air.  The songs are all connected anyway so I don't really see the need to connect the tracks into the one.  But although I disagree with it, I don't let it affect my enjoyment of listening to this class album.    Another gripe on paper I would usually have with this album is that elusive hidden track.  Now normally it would irritate me but in this case the gap between last track `Death and all his friends' and the hidden track is minimal.   Not only this but this time the hidden track makes sense in the context of the album and is definitely not just an afterthought.  The track represents a chance for the couple to forget about all the problems they have experienced in their past and live a happy life as Martin sings `In the end, we lie awake, and we dream of making our escape'.    Overall `Viva la Vida' is an absolutely cracking album and for me it is their best to date. Martin and the boys have stepped slightly outside their comfort zone on more than one occasion on the album.  Showing a band that is not afraid to progress their creativity and put passion into their music.  If this is a sign of things to come, I'm already eagerly anticipating the fifth album which is expected to be out in December 2009.
B001GQSY5U|2.0|Call me a purist, call me unwilling to accept change.  I still feel this (and the subsequent tv series) are boring and actually quite...well juvenile.  WHile it is exciting to see the stories we never knew, the fact that we know the outcome makes them hard to be engaged in.  Everytime the republic enters a battle, while they may win the battle, we know that eventually the war will be 'lost'.  To also add elements of the original trilogy into this prequel story line lessens the impact.  'your father was a great jedi knight'... but no where does it mention him having a padwan.  That totally useless side story adds absolutely nothing to the movie arc...in fact, it lessens anankin's ferocity.  to leave him without a padwan and constantly have him be encouraged to take one would have been a better subplot.  And PLEASE... the whole JABBA's SON story line is beyond ridiculous.  Lucas should have left the stories to the books.  This movie and the series detract from the movie series.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I bought this DVD because i needed something new, I workout 5-6 days a week at high intensity and am seeing little results. I did my first workout today using this DVD on LEVEL ONE, now, i thought because I am fairly fit I could handle level one no problems, I WAS WRONG! The first level almost killed me! (in a good way) and by the end you can feel youve had a great workout and it only takes 25mins! Jillian really knows her stuff and explains why she has chosen each exercise and what muscles it works.  Someone wrote on here that it is only for people who want to tone and not lose weight, well I disagree, Jillian actually says you WILL burn fat doing her routines and of course tone.  I do weight training and nothing prepared me for my muscles yelling PLEASE STOP NO MORE! it was great!  I recommend this for people who dont really have the time to workout full on and want exercises that tone and burn fat at the same time, I gave this 4 stars because she uses small dumbell weights but doesnt specify how heavy they are. I went out and bought 1kg,1,5kg and 2.5kg weights to use while doing this DVD, and trust me you dont want any heavier than that! dumbells are fairly cheap I bought all mine for $30, and they are totally worth the buy.
B0015XHQTE|3.0|Comparing it to the last DIRTY HARRY boxset you do get more extras like badges and booklets. And the transfer of the 1st DIRTY HARRY movie is better, but MAGNUM FORCE looked too pumped up with color in some scenes and grainy. On AMC they had a DIRTY HARRY marathon and they were showing these new dvd transfers. Except for the 1st movie the old transfers are better from the old set.
B000000OTU|5.0|First off I must begin this review that this is a good collection to start off with if you do not yet own any previous Aerosmith albums.  Admittedly there are other good songs that Aerosmith made that were recorded after this album (such as \\"don't want to miss a thing\\").  However as an earlier review posted stated this is a good place to start if you would like to hear some of their 80's and early 90's stuff at a budget price.  Some of the songs that I really liked on this cd are \\"love in an elevator\\" (9 out of 10),\\"rag doll\\" (10 out of 10),\\"Janie's Got a Gun\\" (8 out of 10), \\"Crazy\\" (9 out of 10), and \\"Living on the Edge\\" (10 out of 10).  There are various good songs on this cd but for me the songs I just listed are some of the reasons why I still have this cd after first buying this cd when I was stationed in Japan (and the last time I was in Japan was October 2003).  There are other collections that now carry a wide variety of the classic Aerosmith hits but this is one of the cd's to get if you are ok with collecting more than one greatest hits collection.  In my opinion this cd would be a good primer.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|The Fall is one of those rare movies that sucks you in and wrenches you around like a roller coaster- in the best of ways.  When its over, it leaves you stunned, amazed and enchanted.  I kept asking myself- how had I never heard of this movie, HOW COULD I NEVER HAVE HEARD OF THIS MOVIE??  As a profound lover of fantasy of all kinds, only 2 fantasy films have ever had such a real, lasting, devastating effect on me; Pan's Labyrinth and The Fall.    Its the story of a young girl recovering from a broken arm in a rural hospital.  There she meets Roy, a studio stuntman (the film is set in the early days of Hollywood).  Roy has just lost his girlfriend to a leading man, and the use of his legs in a stunt gone wrong.  His only desire is to end his life.  Roy begins entertaining young Alexandria with stories in an effort to gain her trust, so he can manipulate her into unknowingly bringing him enough morphine to commit suicide.  But the story he tells her begins to take on a life of its own, and through Alexandria's innocent courage and love, the story will change both their lives.    Its the story of 5 heroes seeking revenge on a common enemy, Governor Odious.  The five heroes and their quest come to life in gorgeous color and detail as Alexandria imagines them, compete with her childish mistakes (Roy describes one as an Indian meaning Native American, Alexandria pictures an Indian from India).  Perhaps what makes the film's visual beauty so astounding is that none of it is computer generated.  Every fantastic landscape is real.      Even as Roy's fantasy world becomes more beautiful and enchanting, it begins encroaching on the real world, and comes perilously close to the pain of reality.      Actress Catinca Untaru gives, hands down, the best performance by a child actor I've ever seen.  I've read that she was largely unscripted, so that her responses are genuine.  She looks, talks and acts like a real child, making the fairy-tale world so much more believable.  The restof the cast is superb, the story is original and captivating, and the visuals are unforgettable.  This is a fairy tale for the mind and heart, a fairy tale about real people as cowards and heroes, a gorgeous heart-wrenching fantasy.
B001ED7C58|2.0|After listening to the entire soundtrack a couple times, I am incredibly disappointed. Almost the entire CD is full of techno/rock/other music that cannot be understood. Not at all what I would have pictured to go along with the story. There should have been a few more mellow songs with a melancholic undertone to them. There was maybe a song or two that I would have liked to purchase singly, but cannot due so. Shame on whomever decided to release only one song for single purchase.
0307346617|4.0|Max Brooks' World War Z turns zombie-lore on its bloody, severed head and presents it in a brand new way.  Humanity has already won the war on Zombie when the book begins, the struggle for survival has been triumphant. But Brooks is out to tally the physical and spiritual losses humanity endured by interviewing survivors from every continent.      The voices of these survivors, from Cuba, China, America, South Africa, Britian, Canada are real, believable and unique.  They are civilians, soldiers, politicians, and doctors. With amazing detail, the humanity of the stories shines through even the bleakest experiences.      Ultimately, Brooks succeeds in more than writing a good story; he creates a world, a world of his own vision that mirrors our own in all its horror and glory.
1416575464|4.0|This book is a great place to start for anyone who wants to decorate a room or rooms from scratch or who wants to add to a room that needs something extra. It has great ideas, especially for the beginner, for gathering information, being creative, buying with confidence, and visualizing the end result. Rather than being overwhelming, the colorful and easy-to-follow steps make the process much more delightful for those with little training and less natural ability.<br /><br />While the book has great resources, including examples of window treatments and upholstery and a detailed resource section, the one missing piece that would be invaluable to the true novice is a glossary. Point number 2 in Getting Started in the book tells you to determine your style and uses terms such as bohemian, traditional, sentimental, and theatrical. For those with NO introduction to style and decorating, these words are meaningless without some background or specifics, making self-definition difficult. Running into this wall at the beginning of the book might discourage some readers. A simple glossary of such terms would help.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Who in their right mind would give this movie 1 star?  Have you been living in a cave?  This movie is every bit of the hype it has received and more.  Heath Ledger made this movie.  I absolutely loved, loved, loved his interpretation of The Joker.  What a way to go out with a bang.  I only wish he was able to show the world more of his talent.  Aaron Eckhart did an exceptional job as Two Face also. The movie was phenomenal!!!
B000002H97|2.0|I was 11 when this came out and I bought this and Justice at the same time. I was new to metal and I was a kid but I knew I was listening to Justice constantly while I struggled to get beyond the third track here (it was cassette.) If you liked well played thrash or any kind of music, it boggles the mind why you would want this stuff that gets boring after a few listens. Roam, Struggle, God that failed, Through the never are just filler. I loved Sandman back then, but I liked Smells like teen spirit too.
B001CVCB9O|5.0|Another great Calexico CD.....get it! I simply can't get enough of them, and if you like their recorded music, you should see them in person.....awesome!!!!
B001F2W4Y2|1.0|Can I send it to you to get them recycled?    Angus: Sure!    And it took them eight years to bring more unoriginality and childish cliches. These guys suck in their music and attitude. If you had more people like Angus, their kind of music would never have been invented. Angus would be going, 'rock? Who needs that? Check out this cool banjo solo!' *duck walks*    In terms of sheer mindlessness ACDC and Miley Cyrus are in the same boat.    This recieved an exclusive promotion at Walmart. Whoa!! How rock n' roll can you get?
B0014Z4OQG|1.0|Should be negative stars.  Can't believe I actually watched this whole movie.  The characters were stupid, annoying and unbelievable.  I found myself rooting for the monster.  Not worth the time and definitely not worth the money.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|We have fun playing this game. However, with 3 of us, we need an expansion as I always stop my son from having the longest road and steal the reward and he's in his 20's!
B000BT97AO|1.0|Oh boy.  I just don't get the foreign angle to most stories.  They just keep going and going and going.  Just when you think it's over, bam! something else comes up.  At the end I always feel like saying \\"What just happend?\\"    Also, the boy/girl love connection is a bit off.  The girl seems way too young for the male love interest.  I guess we're supposed to believe 10 years passed by without the girl maturing AT ALL.  I guess it could happen like it did in Star Wars except it still wasn't convincing.
B00009RDGA|5.0|My husband and I watched PAPER MOON with our 11 year old daughter the other night.  What a fun, sweet, thoroughly enjoyable family movie.  I can't think of a better way to spend an evening at home.<br /><br />Filmed in the early `70s in black and white, PAPER MOON tells the story of recently orphaned 9-year old, Addie, who falls in with con man Moses Pray.  As it turns out, Addie is perhaps a better con than Moses is, and the two of them set out to relieve some unsuspecting widows of their butter and egg money.  While swindling their way across the mid-west and surviving a series of hilarious misadventures, Addie and Moses develop a genuine affection for each other, and learn the true meaning of what it is to be a family.<br /><br />Ryan and Tatum O'Neal both give outstanding performances as the erstwhile father and daughter.  In fact, Tatum won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in PAPER MOON, the youngest actress to do so.  Other cast members, including Madeline Kahn and John Hillerman are equal to the task; all the performances complement each other perfectly.  The chemistry between all of the characters is genuine and very believable.<br /><br />The black and white print adds to authentic feel of the film.  You really believe that you are driving around the dust bowl during the Great Depression.  Costuming, sets, and locations are all dead-on Depression era, and lend to realism of this film.  Additonally, there is no sound track to this film.  You hear every chirp of a cricket, every creak of a stair, every rumble of a car motor.  This really puts the viewer there, in the movie, in the story.<br /><br />Full of a wonderfully effective combination of sentimentality, humor, and cynicism, PAPER MOON stands the test of time.  Watch this film with your family.  I guarantee, no matter what the age, everyone will enjoy the evening.  In fact, my oldest enjoyed this film so much that she \\"forgot it was in black and white.\\"
B0014DZ2VO|3.0|Daniel Craig and the action sequences are great but the plot is strained and difficult to follow.

B00005N6KG|5.0|I love these headphones!  They are light and good quality and a great price.  No bells and whistles, but they fit well, and unlike the Dynex pair I was using before they have a good shape - they stay in place while I'm running.   I have small ears and I can't wear just any in-ear headphones.  The buds on these are small enough that they are comfortable for hours.   I have had several pairs before.  Be prepared - they eventually will break, or the wires get loose and you lose sound in one ear, but at this price, who cares?  Mine typically last about a year, and I buy several pairs at a time so I know I have a back up pair around.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I was hesitant about watching this since it was several DVD's, and I was expecting just more of the same kind of documentaries that I've seen before. Well, I was WRONG. This is absolutely the best nature program I've ever seen. The panoramic overhead shots are breathtaking, and the commentary by David Attenbourgh is wonderful (as always). Highly recommended.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I bought Sex and the City-The Complete Series for my daughter because I loved watching it when it first was on HBO. She had been watching the toned-down version on cable and was enjoying it so much. So now when she finishes a DVD she gives it to me and I am loving it as much (if not more) as the first time I saw it!    It comes packaged so nicely, I received it promptly and I am 100% satisfied! This is a must-have for anyone who also enjoyed the movie as much as we did!
1932907009|5.0|in my long and continuing search to learn the craft of screenwriting, i've read many books and have gotten something out of just about all of them.  this is not something learned in one or two books and don't let anyone fool you into thinking otherwise.      sure, we've all heard stories of first-time, unschooled scribes selling their script or idea for millions, but that's tantamount to winning the lottery or a one-time stoke of genius lightning .  it can happen, but the odds are against all of us.  you've really gotta learn how to do it.    and true and practical screenwriting cannot be learned in most universities either.  you almost have to teach yourself.  STC is a condensed, practical tool all students of the craft need to read.  this is not to say you shouldn't read others as well.  and Snyder references and praises some of these. crucial reads in my opinion are Syd Fields, Christopher Vogler and Lajos Egri amongst others.    for me the best thing i got out of STC was that it helped demystify  the process. since my first interest in the subject, i always felt that patterning an \\"original\\" after an already existing, hopefully successful, film would be a kind of \\"short cut\\" without really \\"copying\\" any particular film.  to use other films simply as patterns.  like a dressmaker does.      only i couldn't put my brain around how to do it no matter how many movies i watched.  STC did this for me.  it defined and explained what i had sensed all along.  this helped me tremendously and i think it will you to.      it's the breakdown of genre types and beats that Snyder does so succinctly and originally that summed it up for me.  in this same vain, it's companion book, \\"STC Goes to the Movies\\" is also a must read.  both these books make for excellent reference material you'll find yourself reverting back to constantly.    i highly suggest anyone with an interest in the craft to include STC as an important addition to required reading in a fascinating and very challenging endeavor.  in the end, you'll probably even learn things about yourself as well.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Very artistic effort. It seemed that after this album, Madonna decided to embrace escapism, seeing that the bare reality displayed with this album didn't translate into her usual massive album sales. The public just couldn't face the honesty she was trying to convey, with the lead single in particular, and she was sort of...neutered. To remain relevant in pop culture, she was then forced to make two very commercial pop albums. Confessions and Hard Candy are both very good for what they are, but this is the quality Madonna is capable of. She knows better. You can say many things about her, but she wouldn't still be going without creating interesting music, and this is one of her most ambitious and successful. The themes in the album are not all blatantly political, but the overall tone is very dark. She collaborates yet again with producers, such as Mirwais, from the music and ray of light albums. Several tracks are primarily acoustic, with dribbles of electronica, which create a very rich sound. Can't beat the queen.
B00009V7PJ|4.0|Cher - The Farewell Tour is kinda funny to watch now since Cher has come out of retirement but this concert is still highly entertaining. Cher's costumes changes and wigs are just half of the hype, her classic songs keep you dancing for two hours straight. Cher is definitely a survivor, she makes great music that leaves a lasting impression. You go girl!
B000FAGGWQ|4.0|Having seen all 3 original Star Wars episodes the first time each hit the theaters, and numerous times over the years, it was nice to get a set of DVDs that included the original (and better) versions, as well as the new (changed) versions.  While I admit that technology has evolved to make so many things possible, I do think that, for Star Wars, the original versions remain the absolute best.  To \\"enhance\\" something that was so far ahead of its time originally is just reinventing the wheel - you can't perfect something that was already perfect.  But this set gives the viewer the opportunity to choose which they like best, and also allows the viewer to see some of the neat new things they can do.

1569242739|5.0|I've had this book for awhile, but I feel it's time to finally review it. This cookbook is truly the perfect way to show family and friends that being vegan isn't a big deal--no really. I'm the only vegan in my family, but I can't wait to knock everyone's socks off at Christmas with these delicious recipes (I'm thinking blueberry lemon creme cake for the adults, and 'decorate-it-yourself' banana split cupcakes for the younguns). Please buy this book. I love exotic vegan cooking as much as the next person, but I don't have to funds to acquire the really weird ingredients. This book has those exotic ingredients, but also simple recipes with common ingredients. I'm hoping this book will propel me to official baker of the extended family, making each gathering a little less cruel!

B00004W50T|5.0|If you do not know who The Band was or just how important they were, and you want to know just what they were all about, listen to their debut, Music From Big Pink.  This album brought everyone, including both musicians and music fans back to their musical roots.  In my opinion, it was the first album to be considered Americana and the finest example of that genre, ever.  Robbie Robertson was the ultimate storyteller who took you back to a simpler time where family was most important.  His guitar work is understated, yet, extraordinary at the same time.  Led by not one, but three singers, Richard, Rick and Levon, the songs were taken to the next level.  With Richard's at times raw, yet, brilliant  falsetto, Rick's country influenced harmonies, and Levon's roadhouse blues influenced vocals, each one of them brought something unique to the table, so to speak.  And last, but most definitely not least, Garth, who added a dash of musical genius to the each and every song on the album, with his beautiful organ solos.  If you are into music that will touch you in each and every way, this is your album.  Music From Big Pink IS music for the soul!

0452289963|5.0|This year has been a potporri of severe physical and emotional pain for myself- after reading A New Earth- I feel so much better knowing \\"suffering is OK\\" (burning off of the ego) and knowing that if other people (or yourself ) are very unusually quiet- it is one of two things- they are dwelling on the past or worried about the future.

Sir Mick, the Glimmer Twins, The Rolling Stones, whateveryouwanttocallthemtoday recorded Townes's song and made it famous.  Luckily, the Coen Bros know the original is the best.

B000ETQR3Q|1.0|This gun worked great for the first few shots.   Then it began tearing up the foam darts and jamming.  Within an hour, almost every dart was damaged and the gun jammed up on more than half of the shots.    This was very disappointing to my son, who had saved for months to buy it.  We were happy that we were able to easily return it to the store we purchased from.    We know of two other families that have this gun, and they have had okay performance from it.  I guess we're just unlucky -- but beware that you could be unlucky too!

The Big thing her words not mine! But being kept has it's down side you lose your voice, your creativity, you are kept and maybe you ain't the field hand but still you are the captive, the slave. And the mistress biddings you must attend to.  Not bad being a paid stud. But the down side is you lose your voice, your identity, the thing that makes you, YOU!  An album of cover songs from Seal! How dang lazy is that?  The only song that peaked my interest was Free.  It was nice to hear it from a male vocal.  But how free does he really want to be?  If I want Al Green I'll pop in my CD and listen to the master.  Sam Cooke? Can't go a day without him. The Blue notes got that! The originals all sound so much better.  If you are a kid and want to hear real soul go to the masters! Seal missed this by a millennium!

1400063515|1.0|Black Swan is without doubt the most disappointing book I have ever read in my life.<br /><br />That I actually feel compelled to submit a review (for the first time in a decade) is testimony in itself. I hope that it will help somebody else avoid the utter waste of time and money that this book represents..<br /><br />The key problems with this book are:<br /><br />1. The complete lack of structure and flow. Imagine listening to somebody who digresses ad infinitum. At each turn in their storyline, at each anecdote, you're wondering \\"ok,  where is this going? how is *this* related to the overall message you're trying to communicate?\\".  But no, they continue with the  next little incomplete anecdote ad nauseum.<br /><br />2. The intrusion of the author's personality into the book itself. And from what I've gathered, the author is a self-obsessed bore.  All the references to himself, the people he's met (often with no explanation of the pertinence to the storyline), name-checking obscure philosophers & economist ('obscure' to the layman anyway) for seemingly no reason other than to appear intellectual. The author spends so long pointing out others' mistakes and showing how others are so stupid and he's so smart, and it's simply not nice to listen to people like that.<br /><br />3. Poor writing style. As mentioned already, this really needed an editor.<br /><br />I laboured with it for hours but eventually had to put it down when 60% of the way through.<br /><br />I persevered that long because I thought there must be some pay-back further along the line; but no ... no amusing or insightful stories/anecdotes to make the medicine easier to swallow - this is simply a long, dry, dull read.<br /><br />If you are looking for an enjoyable and insightful read along the lines of Tipping Point, Blink, Freakonomics, Outliers etc then this is definitely NOT it.<br /><br />This book is a Black Swan. It certainly doesn't owe its success to the content.<br /><br />(I actually bought it on a whim based on its position in the bestseller list and Chris Anderson describing it as \\"mindblowing... a masterpiece\\" - shame on you, Chris).<br /><br />Actually, it's not a Black Swan... it was just well marketed.

0553208845|5.0|There are some books everyone talks about but nobody reads. And then, there are books everyone reads but nobody understands. \\"Siddhartha\\" by Hermann Hesse seems to be one of those. I didn't expect much from this book after reading about it on the web. I expected it to be a really bad hippie book about some libertine who callously abandons his wife and kid, and then expects to \\"learn from the river\\", or whatever. I definitely didn't expect it to be Buddhist. Actually reading the book was therefore a pleasant surprise. Apparently, force-feeding high school students with \\"Siddhartha\\" is a really bad idea, LOL.<br /><br />Hermann Hesse's novel, first published in 1922, is obviously based on a close study of different Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Perhaps the author also studied Tantrism. The book is very clever, and contains allusions to both the Bhagavad Gita and the legend of the Buddha. \\"Learning from the river\\" turns out to be another allusion. Note also the deliberate confusion in naming the main character Siddhartha, while referring to the real Buddha as Gotama. According to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha's full name was Siddhartha Gotama!<br /><br />Whether the book is \\"Buddhist\\" or not is mostly a matter of definition. While Siddhartha rejects the Buddha, he eventually becomes enlightened himself by a path that could be accepted by some Hindu and Buddhist traditions. In the last chapter, Siddhartha realizes that samsara is nirvana, and grasps the concept of shunyata, fundamental tenets of Mahayana and Vajrayana Buddhism. More controversial are Siddhartha's libertine escapades. I think it all hinges on how you interpret his words that the libertinism was \\"inevitable\\". Was it inevitable in the sense that the path to enlightenment goes through rank antinomianism? Outside \\"left-hand\\" Tantrism, that would be a very controversial statement. Or was it inevitable in the sense of being fated and karmic? If so, I think most Buddhists would agree with Hesse. Some people just don't get it in the present lifetime... What the correct interpretation is, I honestly don't know.<br /><br />Siddhartha seems to reject four purported paths to salvation. First, he rejects the empty ritualism of the Brahmins. Then, he rejects the extreme asceticism of the Samanas. His reaction to the Buddha is more complex. On the one hand, Siddhartha admires the Buddha, who is clearly an enlightened being. On the other hand, Siddhartha feels that one cannot become enlightened by a strictly logical philosophy, or by reliance on a teacher. He senses a dualism in the Buddha's teaching, a dualism between False and True he somehow suspects doesn't exist in reality. Also, he believes that the strict logic of Buddhist metaphysics cannot explain the existence of the Buddha himself! Enlightenment looks \\"illogical\\" in a self-contained, purely philosophical system. Interestingly, the Buddha seems to tacitly accept Siddhartha's criticism, as if a secret understanding existed between them. Exoteric versus esoteric teaching?<br /><br />More difficult to fathom is Siddhartha's entanglement with Kamala and Kamaswami. To some extent, it sounds Tantric. Siddhartha indulges himself in sex, gambling and money without being affected by it, like an antinomian sage. And yet, in the end he *does* become affected, sinking deeper and deeper. My personal take on this, is that our hero rejects the Tantric path as well. Eventually, Siddhartha becomes a ferryman and \\"learns from the river\\". He realizes the essential emptiness and non-duality of all things, and finally reaches salvation. His friend, the Buddhist monk Govinda, experiences a mystical vision in Siddhartha's presence, similar to Arjuna's theophany in the presence of Krishna as recorded in the Bhagavad Gita. (Note the weird fact that the monk's name is Govinda, another name for Krishna!) Govinda reaches the conclusion that although Siddhartha's words are incomprehensible and doesn't sound Buddhist, he has nevertheless attained the same state as the Buddha. Govinda throws himself at Siddhartha's feet, and there, the story ends.<br /><br />Perhaps I should point out that I'm not a Buddhist by any standard. Still, I found the book to be extremely cleverly written, and it's now one of my favourites. Five stars!<br /><br />PS. I read another edition than this one. It was marked \\"Penguin Modern Classics\\" and had a foreword by Paulo Coelho. This edition doesn't seem available from the American site of Amazon. I have therefore placed my review here, purely at random. I haven't read this particular translation. I think... ;-)as the Buddha.

031606792X|5.0|I think this book was awesome!  I could not put it down (like the previous twilight books). Bravo Stephanie Meyer!  I hesitated at first, because I am well beyond my teen years, but am glad I persevered. I believe that people are over analyzing this book.  For one thing, this series is a fantasy and vampires don't really exist, so the fact that Bella got pregnant by a vampire needs to be taken with a grain of salt.   I've been reading science fiction/fantasy books for 15 years and this series is one of the best!  I have never criticized a fantasy book by saying -hey, this isn't possible, because it is after all, make believe!     The book could not have ended better for me. Of course the characters would have to change a little due to the circumstances presented to them.  I loved the new Bella.  My only fault is that the book had to end.  Maybe someday, we will hear more about the Cullen family.  Please?!
B001E75QGG|4.0|Well \\"Indy\\" has sure covered lots of ground in his explorations. Guess it was only a matter of time till this topic was part of his travels. I liked it but guess I expected more, like the early movies seem to have had more to them.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Outstanding story, first rate acting. It won't leave you with indigestion the way the 'Dark Knight' Did. It's a watch 'more than once' movie for sure.
B000ECX0QU|5.0|Great Hitchcock film reminding me of how things have changed as well as not changed with governments and the world.
B001DU8T6S|5.0|Maybe this cd isn't good enough for Queen or Paul Rodgers purists but, as for me, I can't stop listening to it. I was never a Queen fan and didn't own one single song by them until I sampled and bought this. And I'm glad I did. It's just full of good rock and roll and some decent ballads. My favorites are C-lebrity, Surf's Up Schools Out and Voodoo. Just those songs alone are worth the price of admission!!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|My husband and I are great fans of the BBC literature classics. Many of their dramas have been remade over the years, none more than Jane Eyre. We have enjoyed compairing and contrasting the remakes. Many well known actors and actresses have played the roles, and each has done fine work and all are quite entertaining.  However, in our opinion, none come close to the quality and entertainment value of this latest remake.  The cinematography, sets, wardrobe, acting and directing are first class. I'm sure this movie would have done well as a major theatrical release. If you have not seen this version of Jane Eyre, by all means, do. If contemplating purchasing this DVD for your collection or as gifts, you will be making a wise decision. This version of Jane Eyre will be the one the others will be weighed against.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Whether you're a beginner or advanced, this work out will work for you.  Jillian doesn't blather, she works.  She makes you work and she makes sense.  3 levels, 3-6 minute segments w/a short warm up and cool down in each.  Also, she is backed by 2 other exercisers, one doing the exercises at an easier level (e.g. not as deep with lunges and squats) the other doing them at a higher intensity (e.g. literally kicking herself in the [...]).  The only drawback is that she doesn't do a modified jumping jack or the more modified 'run' so people with knee issues may have an issue at 1st.  The nice thing is it's 20 minutes...just when you think 'I am done, can't do another...' it's over and you're done.      This DVD is money well spent.
B0010HOZX0|5.0|No Reservations if one of those classic type movies that I can watch multiple times and never tire of it.  Great movie.  There should be more like it.
B00005JKGZ|5.0|The CD was as advertised.  The price was terrific and with free delivery it beats going shopping at a retail store.  Meet Me In St.Louis is a classic, great family film and should be shown in every grade school.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Life is indeed beautiful and this wonderful movie by Roberto Begnini makes us stop to think about it, to admire it, to enjoy it, to love it, to come to the conclusion that, no matter how hard it is sometimes, it's always worth it! From my point of view, the core message of this masterpiece is the selfless love. Whenever we feel this kind of love, we will see that nothing else matters. We will have accomplished the highest goal a human being can be assigned to. That's also GOD's message for us and, amidst laughter, smiles, humor and tenderness, Roberto Begnini leads our thoughts to same conclusion. Watch it because you won't regret!
B0000256KE|4.0|There's something very sexy about Roxy Music.  Maybe it's the way the lead singer has that special appeal towards the ladies when he sings, or maybe it's just the beautiful models on the album covers.  Whatever it is, I really think this band took glam rock to a new level of seriousness.      These songs are just, well, downright sexy to listen to.  Highly enjoyable vocal melodies, yeah, and instrumentally pleasing and technically a very talented band, but For Your Pleasure also contains very good songwriting to elevate most of these songs to greatness.  I don't think they're as good as David Bowie, but then again, Bowie and Roxy Music are very different beasts.    \\"In Every Dream Home a Heartache\\" kind of stinks though, because it's just one moody vocal melody with strange lyrics that repeat over and over, and nothing really memorable happens the entire 5 and a half minutes.  The title song RULES a lot!  It starts off fairly normally, with a typical Roxy Music-like vocal melody we've come to expect from the band, and then drifts into this very hazy and bizarre atmospheric jam with piano and cool drums, and it's just... very VERY strange.  I love it though.      I recommend this album.
0439023483|3.0|This is one of my least favorite trends in science fiction/fantasy literature.  The book is entirely compelling, then instead of an ending, it has \\"End of Book One.\\"  $%&#!  I wanted to read a whole story, not the first episode of another franchise.  It's dishonest and mercenary, and makes all the fun I had reading the thing curdle in my memory.  It's tainted.  It's Crystal-Skulled.  What a shame.
0321213351|5.0|Refactoring written by Martin Fowler is the foundamental book, and this Refactoring to Patterns is higher level talking about refactoring. This is an excellent book about the refactoring.
B001D84NKQ|4.0|More to do with the artist listing than the actual soundtrack. The version of 'Have Love Will Travel' that is used in the film is actually performed by The Sonics, not Richard Berry. I don't own the CD so I don't know if its an error or if they used a different version of the song for the soundtrack and for the film.    Regardless if anyone is trying to track down the artist heard in the film it was The Sonics.
B0000009XP|5.0|buddy awsome as ever i was surprised when i got it .it was like being thier myself.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Picking Robert Downney Jr to play Tony Stark simply guaranteed this movie wouldn't stink........... Downey steals the show without taking away the main character of Tony Stark & the Tin Man as being the center of the story. (ie. some actors are so good, you forget who theyre playing and just pay attention to \\"them\\" and not their \\"character\\".)    Marvel got it right this time - it's a shame that Incredible Hulk didnt get the same results, nor probably will Punisher WarZone which should have been a straight-to-DVD release. They can redeem themselves if they dont make the world wait 10 years for the Avengers.
0618918248|4.0|After reading the first couple of chapters, I thought to myself: \\"Wow, looks like this will be my first 5-star rating on Amazon!\\"  Incredibly funny, yet serious and compelling at the same time, organized, smart, well written, and, most of all, well reasoned. \\"God as the ultimate stinker\\" argument was just as brilliant as it was hilarious.  But then it got progressively worse. The constant humor was reduced to sparse jokes and, by the last third of the book, disappeared completely.  The arguments, at first so logical and substantiated, became less so. Gallup polls were replaced by anecdotal testimonies, scientific studies gave way to personal opinions as to what studies could show had they been conducted, which is not a valid argument at all. And the final chapter, describing some scientific principles, was outright boring, but that may be because as a science major I found nothing there I didn't know already.  One last complaint is the language. Every page contains at least a dozen words that you'd normally find only in a SAT or GRE, or something. Occasionally I had to read a paragraph twice to understand what was written there (and I actually scored high on GRE). And I could see no reason for using such a complicated language. Surely it serves no purpose to make an important book like this less comprehensible to the general public.  Despite all that, first impression is first impression, and the book did contain a lot of interesting facts and compelling arguments at first to warrant 4 stars.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|Quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made.  It may be worse than Phantom Menace, but I dont feel like wasting my time to go back and compare the two.  Seriously, could a movie have any more plot holes?  A magnetic skull that can attract iron powder from hundreds of feet away, but can be carried around in a messenger bag and not disturb anything at all. What about you belt buckle Indy?  Or maybe your luger?  Pure stupidity.  I've seen pornos with better storylines.  All I could think after seeing this movie was 'Well, theres 2 hours of my life I'll never get back'.
0143038419|4.0|This is a great book.  It is hard to put down.  Easy read.  I love traveling to Italy, Indonesia and India with Elizabeth.
B000002IJL|5.0|For those of you who have never seen Stand By Me...go and see it.  It's a phenomenal movie that captures the era and sentiments perfectly.  The soundtrack was perfectly matched to the movie, the characters, and the storyline.  You'll love the movie and you'll love the soundtrack...certainly one for all the ages!
0060574216|5.0|This is a 'must read' for every man and woman, even if you think you understand your partner very well.
B001AJVR5M|3.0|From there previous album, I was very disappointed of this one. There previous one was amazing and this one is like.. blaaahh! they have a few good songs like Burnin Up and Tonight isn't to bad but the other songs were just plain stupid!! like for example BB Good To Me: it had a good beat and all but come on BB-- so cheezy!! When they come out with another album- which they most probably will- i will deff. check it out more before buying it.
B001F290E4|2.0|Seal's voice is so amazing that you almost forgive this record.<br /><br />Almost.<br /><br />It's not that the record is irredeemable; it's that it's been done a hundred times before.  And while Seal's voice is compelling enough to revisit the well that was soul 30+ years ago, the arrangements are stock.  In the end the record ends up sounding like the best karaoke album you ever heard.  Boring.<br /><br />Seal is a master vocalist, and these were masterful, classic songs, but this Reese cup doesn't taste so hot.
B000TCEU4Q|5.0|I had no problem installing this on my machine running XP. I just plugged it in and assigned the axes to it under HOTAS and off I went. I did not download the software it came with and have had no problems. Throttle control is superb, flaps can be incremently selected, no more keyboard preset with only 2 or 3 choices, same for prop pitch. Unit seems to be well made with smooth lever movement and good rocker switch feel. I will be getting another one for elevator, rudder, and aileron trim. Wish I had bought this long ago.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|The picture quality in Blu-ray version is absolutely stunning!! This is how all transfers to high def should be. With a calibrated a TV you will be blown away with its inky blacks and spot on colors.<br />The finest BD I've to date. Buy this just to show off your rig and if you like the movie then just consider it a bonus.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|I am very pleased with this product, and will not hesitate to buy from this seller again. Thanks!
B000M4RG42|1.0|Definitely not styled after Tom Brokaw's book The Greatest Generation, which accounts why the generation of the WWII era was one of America's finest.  This movie was made with a sort of cynicism about our Greatest Generation that seems to only drain the audience's attention.  By focusing too much on the 'bad' side of America during the War in the Pacific, Clint Eastwood overlooks the good that America can stand for leaving the viewer with their own battle fatigue.  Jumping from the war to modern times and back again and again during the whole movie was like being drug through the mud having to endure another one of hollywood's cynical anti-American rantings.<br /><br />Poorly made and although it had potential, the movie will leave you wondering what message it is the viewer is supposed to swallow.  The general message, I think, is: 'dislike your country for standing up to Imperial Japan, because underneath it all we were all just a bunch of jerks and that we should have lost'.

B000FS9FCG|4.0|I saw this a few years ago, and it is really thought provoking, which is rare in movies nowdays.  It makes you wonder how easy it could be to create a dictatorship in which the few own the powerful, especially since nowdays the media will participate because they care more about ratings than reporting. my only complaint was the length, although that is due to my short attention span
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I am very pleased with this product, and will not hesitate to buy from this seller again. Thanks!
0930289528|4.0|having seen the movie when it first came out, I was curious about the book.  I am NOT dissapointed.  It is one of the most thought provoking things I have read, like 1984 but with more interesting and strong willed people.  What really scares me is how I can see some of the aspects of the book happening in this day and age, with  a complacent media who care more about ratings, and people who care more about celeb trash than fighting for what is right.  As the author says, \\"this book is for those who do not turn off the news\\"
B0014DZ2VO|1.0|I wish I had every dollar and every minute of time that I spent on this film refunded. I should have demanded my money back. It was obvious within the first 20 minutes that everyone who put this together had no idea why people used to enjoy James Bond movies, and had no intention of learning from experience. It was nonsensical, horribly written other than a few lines delivered by M, horribly directed, horribly photographed, horribly edited....  Its violence was thuggish rather than stylish. Bond's angst over the death of his lover in \\"Casino Royale\\" was barely touched on as a device but never made emotionally compelling. There weren't enough quiet scenes to even establish motive. Locations were dull and squalid, for the most part. Even Siena was used pointlessly, with no compensating fun of being allowed to watch a few minutes of color and spectacle before the violence ramped up again. Apparently the producers didn't realize that the point of all the exotic locations is for the audience to experience them vicariously.  We aren't there to see back alley rooms in squalid Haiti or La Paz or to watch car and boat chases as mere headache-inducing blurs. Bond is now completely indestructable, and his opponents nearly so - crashing through glass, falling several stories, bouncing up to fight some more, over and over. Yet innocent victims are shot, burnt (I assume that was the fate of the maid), presumed mangled in car crashes without a twinge. The action was so badly choreographed I never knew whose car was being hit, whose boat smashed or whose body pummeled. I remember the exhilaration of leaving \\"Goldfinger,\\" my first Bond film, and wanting to tell all my friends. There was no exhilaration here. The audience trailed out in stunned silence, probably glad they were finally released from their misery.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Come on Paramount...why put out a remastered Star Trek on HD-DVD/DVD (Season 1) and regular DVD (Season 2 and 3) and leave out Blu-Ray when it is so much more clear, crisp and superior.  Way back when...I bought ALL the individual high priced 2 episodes per DVDs which cluttered my shelf space.  Then I rebought the condensed season sets yellow, blue and red.  Then I found out there's a remastered versions (I do like the remastered special effects and visuals).  I would have even settled for HD-DVD of Season 2 or 3.      It would have been nice if the Blu-Ray version was available with the simultaneous release of this 3 Volume set.
B001E75QGG|3.0|Stephen S. and George L. tried too hard on this one. They tried to throw everything in the mix, including a cheesy setup for the next IJ release. The core theme was also trying too hard to be something so amazing that it ended up bordering on insulting.  Just tell a story guys. Keep nostalgia out of your movie making. We don't need in-your-face images and charaacters of past movies you've both made getting in the way of this one. It seemed like every scene was another look into the past of a memorable scene or icon from the first IJ movies. At least be subtle about it. As much as I was trying to enjoy this movie, it seemed I was being forced to remember the \\"good-ol-days\\" of the original IJ series.
B000P28RAI|5.0|Following on from their hugely promising February 1984 debut \\"Swoon\\", England's PREFAB SPROUT took many English and Irish hearts by storm in the summer and autumn of 1985 with their stunning 2nd album \\"Steve McQueen\\". Rated by many as being in the Top 50 albums of all time, this April 2007 2CD LEGACY EDITION is a long overdue remastered celebration of that bedsit staple.<br /><br />Here's the layout first - Disc 1 (45:13 minutes):<br />Tracks 1 to 11 are the album \\"Steve McQueen \\" issued in June 1985 on Kitchenware Records KW 3 in the UK (Vinyl, Cassette and CD). The US version was called \\"Two Wheels Good\\" for contractual reasons and was issued on Epic 40100.  The US CD version contained 3 bonus tracks - \\"Faron Young (Truckin' Mix)\\", \\"The Yearning Loins\\" and \\"He'll Have To Go\\" - they were not included on the UK version - nor unfortunately included here on this reissue either. This Legacy reissue is remastered by original producer THOMAS DOLBY at The Mastering Lab in Los Angeles  - he also contributes recollections to the liner notes.<br /><br />Disc 2 (35:00 minutes):<br />Tracks 1 to 8 are brand new acoustic re-interpretations by Paddy McAloon (band's principal songwriter) of 8 tracks from the original 11 - they were recorded across the summer of 2006.<br /><br />The 2CDs are housed in a card gatefold digipak (where's the Legacy Edition Protective Plastic outer wrap?), have motorbike logos on the CDs and a scant 12-page booklet with liner notes by PAUL LESTER. There are some new photos - outtakes from the album cover shoot, but bizarrely the original inner sleeve of the LP depicting the members of the band and giving recording details - is missing. But worse is the lack of musical extras. Between October 1984 and as late as February 1986, no less than 6 singles came off the album in the UK - When Love Breaks Down was put out 3 times  - Faron Young, Appetite and Johnny Johnny were issued also - between them and their multiple formats, they produced as many as 12 unreleased B-sides and mixes. As you can see from the playing time on both discs, there was plenty of room for remasters of these rarities. They will probably never see the light of day now - which is maddening - especially on a supposed collector's edition. However, the other way of looking at it is this - presented as is - this reissue forces you to focus 'only' on the album proper - and the new acoustic tracks - and as they stand - they make for a truly sensational listen. So I can see why McAloon would want the album presented in this way, it's just disappointing not to see those non-album tracks that are not on CD anywhere...<br /><br />Which brings us to the 1st part of the good news - THE SOUND. Like many who've loved this wonderful record, I've had the cramped vinyl LP and dull sounding original CD for over 20 years now - hoping for a good reissue of it at some point. Well this Thomas Dolby remaster is just BEAUTIFUL - clean, muscular and full of presence. Hearing the sublime \\"Bonny\\" in this sound quality is a treat no music lover should be without - and that synth solo - wow! And when you think of how awful a lot of Eighties music sounds now - so dated and over-produced - musically the whole album still holds it own. So many great tracks \\"Moving The River\\", \\"Desire As\\" and the Johnny Johnny song \\"Goodbye Lucille No.1\\" A really sweet remaster by Dolby. But the real fireworks and really great news starts on Disc 2...<br /><br />Few would have expected that Acoustic Reinterpretations would be this good - or even rival and better the originals - but here they do. It's hard to understate just how stunning these beautifully recorded remakes are - I've been playing them to buggery for over 18 months now and still don't tire of them. Their sound quality is also GORGEOUS - very Blue Nile production - sooo good! I made up a shop-play disc of 7 tracks from the 2007 Ryan Adams album \\"Easy Tiger\\" with 7 of these acoustic versions - and it so works - to a point that every time I play it, it never fails to bring customers to the counter with looks of 'discovery' on theirs faces wanting to know \\"...who is this!!!\\"<br /><br />To sum up - despite the ok-only packaging and lack of those b-sides - this is a 5-star reissue of a 6-star album - a must buy. I will go weak at the knees if the same treatment is planned for the equally magnificent \\"Jordon: The Comeback\\"...s to the counter with looks of 'discovery' on theirs faces wanting to know \\"...who is this!!!\\"    To sum up - despite the ok-only packaging and lack of those b-sides - this is a 5-star reissue of a 6-star album - a must buy. I will go weak at the knees if the same treatment is planned for the equally magnificent \\"Jordon: The Comeback\\"...
B001EIOOVS|5.0|I had rented this in plain DVD (best I could get from Netflix after waiting over a month).  My wife liked it so much bought it in Blu Ray.  Fairly gruesome but fantastic actors make it well worthwhile.. (And entertaining)
0739368044|4.0|I thought that this installment of this series was well written, it brings alot of the elements from the previous books together. I enjoyed listening to this book the best. Just thought it took too long for it to come out, hopefully the last doesn't take as long.
B001DHXT1G|5.0|Hi,  First with Amazon's prime would cost $8.98; $6.99 + $1.99 handling, but is free, and usually get a day or 2 early than the typical Tuesday release date. The $79 a year is pretty fair and even better on books $12.99 total. Blu Ray from Netflix is hit or miss.  So for hot titles I usually buy them.   This version of the Hulk was very entertaining and more compassionate then the orginal.  Pretty fair price and typically cheaper if it is preroder! The price is usually slightly better than say WalMart, if they have it at all,  especially on the release date.
B00007KWHO|5.0|I have been following the works of Jon Anderson of the group \\"YES\\" ever since he came into the public ear. \\"Time and a Word\\" was the first album I heard of YES. That's when there was something we used to call turn tables and records - they were round and flat plastic objects onto which recordings were made by physically scratching minute high and low groves into the plastic. Perhaps that's how the term \\"groovy\\" came about. YES's music aside, the following may give you an idea of the messages Jon Anderson delivers. From the track (another LP (Long Play) record term) \\"Time and a Word\\", \\"There's a time. and the time is now and it's right for me. And the time is now. There's a word. And the word is Love and it's right for me. And the word is Love\\". The CD \\"Time and a Word\\" is a classic to be enjoyed for generations to come. Ray Hogue.
0312330537|5.0|Roberts writes like a god; the story is autobiographical, philosophical.  Beginning with an escape from prison, the saga takes one into modern day India and from thence to Afghanistan.   Our hero describes the different lives he led with the delicacy of a surgeon and the spiritual evolvement of a highly-evolved soul.  Falling in love at first sight, the hero is led into a byzantine mist of cultural contradictions, crime and war.  The issue of moral proximity is examined from every angle. Roberts is candid about how he fell from grace and how, in the end he found release from the demons that possessed him.  I could not put it down and the story haunts me still.
B001E75QGG|4.0|While Crystal skull won't be remembered as the best Indiana Jones picture, it certainly isn'nt the worst. I enjoyed it anyway, but the scenes which were shot at Yale University in New Haven, CT was of special interest to me since both my father graduated from there, and I grew up near that area, and had seen Yale University many tiimes.
0060555661|5.0|After being a stockbroker, and starting to deal with the market when I was 18, this book makes the best sense of the thinking process for investing. I first read this when my father gave me a copy when I turned 18. It still makes a great deal of sense and is rewritten in areas with up to date examples that are pertinent for today. Get it and read it! But most of all try and practice this discipline.
B001CLG6RC|4.0|Five songs into Seven Lives Many Faces, I was convinced that I would never buy another Enigma CD again.  The CD started with the obligatory horns and breathy, spoken-word vocals followed by two of the most mediocre Enigma songs I had ever heard.  Track number 4, \\"The Same Parents\\" was interesting, but a little too cliche in its message.  As I listened, the death of Enigma was nearly sealed with \\"Fata Morgana\\", an absolutely forgettable composition.    But as \\"Fata Morgana\\" transitioned into track 6, \\"Hell's Heaven\\" my ears took notice.  \\"Hell's Heaven\\" opens with a heartbreaking chord progression that gives way to a sinister bass beat and then into rising string stabs.  The truth is that Enigma has never done anything this interesting or experimental on any of the previous six albums.  Another reviewer here has derrided one of the sound samples in \\"Hell's Heaven\\", describing it as \\"a telephone throwing up\\".  I think this is the perfect description for the sound, but I don't see it as a negative.  The \\"Hellish\\" sounding effect is brilliantly (and intentionally) balanced at the end of the song by a choir of angelic voices singing over a soul-wrenching string arrangement.    \\"Hell's Heaven\\" had peaked my interest and the song that followed, \\"La Puerta del Cielo\\" honestly blew me away.  It was like I was living in 1990 again, listening to MCMXC a.d.  \\"La Puerta del Cielo\\" is the closest Michale Cretu has ever gotten to revisiting his breakthrough genius.    Now I was hooked, and Seven Lives Many Faces did not disappoint.  Cretu has organized the tracks in a way that keeps the drama building all the way through to the end.  \\"Deja Vu\\" is an extremely clever concoction of sonic elements from some of Enigma's previous albums that only the most tuned-in fans will pick up on.  \\"Je T'Aime Till My Dying Day\\" features a crunching beat layered with warm, muted strings and Andru Donalds, who usually oversings his vocals, giving the best performance he's ever given on an Enigma album.  \\"Between Generations\\" and \\"The Language of Sound\\" round out the set, making it clear that Enigma is not part of the past, but still looking into the future.    As the CD started over at track 1, I had a new appreciation for the first five songs I had initially disliked, now that I had a context in which to put them.  \\"The Same Parents\\", which had initially peaked my interest on first listen, now seemed to fit into the overall story of the album and took it's place as the great song that it is.    Seven Lives Many Faces is probably the most musically risky Enigma album to date; yet somehow, it still feels comfortable.  From \\"Hell's Heaven\\" on through the end, the album is pure genius.  For those of you who wrote off Enigma several albums ago, this is the rebirth you've been waiting for.
0061537934|5.0|From the get-go this was clearly going to be my kind of book.  But I had little idea how totally enraptured I'd become as I started to read.  I generally cannot read books for too long a period of time anymore but I find myself gulping this novel down in huge bites.  I'll be finished with it shortly and I am actually dreading that moment.  I'm thoroughly enjoying every minute I am spending with this dog and his philosophical musings and his clear-eyed view of the actual simplicity of a very complex world.  Mr. Stein has done has accomplished a great thing here.  He has simplified the meaning of life and presented it in the guise of a wise but very \\"human\\" dog with the ability to communicate.  That which we manifest is before us.  He has clearly manifested a very fine read.  Bravo.
B0013ND30M|5.0|I'm one of the many who faithfully turn out every time Disney release a new DVD of one of their classic animated films. The Platinum series, bi-annual releases of the Disney films which sold best on VHS, has proved an exemplary program, and the impressive streak continues with this edition of Sleeping Beauty.    First, the movie; Sleeping Beauty was one of the last Disney movies I'd not managed to see in my childhood. It never came across my radar, so I was very excited to see it. The story is classic Disney, and well-executed classic Disney at that. The characters are all well-developed, and the voice acting is extremely good. But it's the visuals that sell it. This is the most beautiful piece of eye candy in the entire Disney library. I couldn't stop looking at the animation, with vibrant colours filling every inch of frame. This was the last Disney movie before they started using a photocopying process, and while I love the look of the next group of films (101 Dalmations and The Jungle Book, for example), there's nothing that can compare with the beauty of hand-painted cells. It's gorgeous from start to finish.    As for the bonus features, I've loved the Platinum Series as much for the documentaries as I have for the movies. Each one in the line has come with a tremendous thirty- to sixty-minute feature on the making of the film, and this one is an interesting and informative watch.    I didn't buy the previous release of Sleeping Beauty, so I can't say how the transfer or the bonus features compare to that, but if you haven't already added this movie to your collection, there's no reason to hesitate. It's a classic for a reason, and well worth your time.

B000000WA2|5.0|England was entering a new golden age in the mid-1990s. English patriotism was returning, and the English were proud to call themselves so. It was all summed up perfectly in Blur's third album, Parklife. Parklife was a celebration of the English way, even going so far as to make a moving, stadium-sized song about the shipping forecast (\\"This Is a Low\\"). That was on the upswing of Britpop. It was a document of the Glory Days.    The Great Escape is the comedown. For Blur, at least, the party was over before it even began. The overwhelming success of Parklife led to songwriter Damon Albarn having a nervous breakdown, and the album which came out of it is a stunner. The music is more angular, the songs are darker. While Parklife was England as it is, The Great Escape exists within Albarn's mind, in a world where darkness and depressions lay in every facet. The songs cover everything from voyeurism to separated lovers, and while it's a more challenging trip to get through, the album is definitely a classic. \\"Country House\\" and \\"Charmless Man\\" are two of the most enjoyable singles Blur ever released, and they serve to lighten the tone, though even they are about depressed men living empty lives.    There is a split within the Blur fan base; It's rare to find a Blur fan who finds The Great Escape average. They either love it, or think it to be the low point of the discography. I can understand where those who think little of it are coming from; The album is the only point in the Blur discography where they really seemed to stay still. All the other albums are tremendous leaps into new directions, but The Great Escape is Parklife with a hangover. The band settled in one spot, and let themselves sink deep into the ground. Some don't like that they were mining the same tract, and argue they buried themselves. Others, myself included, feel there was simply more to find in that vein, and it was well worth the stay.
0385333846|5.0|A work of perfection. Kurt Vonnegut said all there was needed to say in this harsh indictment of war of and humanity's failure to prevent it.      The main character, Billy Pilgrim, was written in a masterful way. A man who could find pleasure in the simplest of things, is thrust into a situation that would break almost anyone, let alone a simple man like Pilgrim.      Like all great works of literature, they are open to speculation by the reader, and I found enough in this book's 215 pages that I could sit here speculating on it for ages. This, to me, is the true mark of a great book. One that will be read forever and will never die.      My take on the whole alien abduction and time travel was Billy Pilgrim's mind dealing with the chaos of his life. The way a psychiatrist will explain that a person's mind can splinter in situations of dire stress and create other personalities, so in this manner did Pilgrim's mind allow him to believe that he was able to time travel and be kidnapped by aliens. Or, you can believe that it actually happened. God only knows what Vonnegut's intentions were.       The war depictions are sad and funny, heartfelt and well-told. You can take away all of the underlying meanings in this book and appreciate it as just a great piece of fiction, a great story.      If you are a person who looks around at the state of humanity and says, \\"Why don't people understand how to treat each other? They just don't get it.\\" Then you should start reading Vonnegut right now, and Slaughterhouse-Five is a magnificent place to start.      A timeless classic.

B000VR824S|5.0|If you're looking for a grassroots feel to a truely spontaneous concert, this collection of performances over a day-long concert in suburban Chicago is well worth the coin you'll spend.  The line-up is spactacular and the emotion created on-stage will spill out of your flat-screen and onto the livingroom floor.  The two-dvd set will feature some of the greatest guitarists of all time on stage from various genre' and comes to a turmultuous finale' when 7 guitarist hit the stage to play Clapton's favorites.  The shear force of this segment must have put-out a brilliant shockwave that must have been felt in far-away Des Moines.  If you've grown bored by a sucession of live shows that are overly-produced to the point of yawn-dom, this is a refreshing time-out from all of the hype.  You'll see the human side of these artists with backstage interviews and short edits of legends coming-on and off of their performances. One of the notable high-points was the 15 year-old bassist of Jeff Beck.  She is a genius and the facial expressions and body language that emanates from her as she leans-into the tunage will give you goose-bumps.  The fact that the entire 2007 concert was a fundraiser for Clapton's Crossroads Centre, a very successful detoxification facility, makes the performances just that much more compelling. PBS offered this set duirng one of their fundraising telecasts.  You can get it here for far less.  Enjoy!  And when it's done, you look at your axe and say, \\"I've got some new chops to learn!\\"  or  \\"It's hopeless...I'm selling my Strat on eBay.\\"
0792846443|5.0|If ever a movie has made me feel as trapped as its protagonist does, Misery stands right up there. I must admit that I have never read King's novel on which this film was based, but it didn't stop the movie from chilling my bones. It was an effort just to sit through it; it's that intense. James Caan and especially Kathy Bates deliver truly spectacular performances as popular (and, to his grudge, commercialised) writer Paul Sheldon and his psychotic \\"number one fan\\" Annie Wilkes. The movie has a justified reputation as a two-actor film, as the twisted relationship the characters share is what makes the movie so memorable.<br /><br />Bed-ridden after being saved from a car crash in the midst of a blizzard in the Rocky Mountains, Paul Sheldon finds himself under the care of Annie Wilkes, a seemingly-kind recluse who lives for his novels about female romance hero \\"Misery\\". Paul soon finds out that Annie's seemingly positive attitude is completely deceptive, as she is not at all intent on letting her hero escape her grasp, or kill off her favourite character of his. She forces him to revive Misery, with a novel written just for her. Paul has no choice to comply, but even so he soon learns that Annie is not at all what she seems, and that trying to escape might result in unthinkable consequences.<br /><br />Bates deservedly won an Oscar for her portrayal as the unhinged Annie, who appears on the surface to be the epitome of kindness but is really a ticking time bomb that'll go off, messily, at the least effort. James Caan's performance is wonderful as well as the trapped writer trying his utmost to escape. The movie is chock-full of suspense as Sheldon puts his cunning mind to use in how to escape from Annie. However, she proves to be equally cunning. As such, the film has a definite 'cat-mouse' atmosphere to it - and we do fear for Sheldon, as Annie is the sort of character whose boundaries of mercy are vague to say the least. Most of the terror found in the film is psychological, but it does reach out into direct physical pain on occasion - one scene in particular is bound to haunt the viewer for a long time after viewing; it has something to do with diamond mines.<br /><br />What's probably the most frightening of all is how the character of Annie Wilkes shifts from psychotically raged to sweet and giggling, from her loving mother attitude to the devil in a woman's guise. Make no mistake, Misery is a psychological drama of the best degree. It's excellently written and acted, and it'll keep your heart racing to the finish. An excellent adaptation - even from one who's never read the novel.it does reach out into direct physical pain on occasion - one scene in particular is bound to haunt the viewer for a long time after viewing; it has something to do with diamond mines.

0375826726|2.0|because I couldn't take it anymore.  I'm a quick reader and it's been 3 days getting that far.  I skipped ahead 500 pages to read the final 100. Paolini's first book was pretty good though long-winded.  The second I had to struggle to get through.  The third, I just plain won't read the whole thing, btw I haven't finished those last 100 pages yet either.  I'm just glad I got it at the library and didn't waste my money.<br /><br />I decided to check out the reviews only to find out there will be a fourth book, oh great.  Guess what?  I won't be reading it. Paolini may have come up with a great idea when he was a voice-cracking fifteen year old but he needs some control.  It seems publishers will put anything to print anymore no matter how bad it is if people are reading it, ie: they're making sales.<br /><br />I hope Paolini is going to college or learning somewhere how to write like an adult.  His writing style hasn't changed one iota and it needs to badly.

B001C08RHA|5.0|The best action movie ever! Robert Downey Jr. is perfect in this role. Great entertainment.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|TORA! TORA! TORA! is the Japanese signal to attack and this epic film co-produced by American & Japanese interests shows both sides of the story as it builds to the climatic attack on Pearl Harbor which ultimately brought America into WWII. The film does a terrific job of alternating back and forth between the Japanese and American stories so that the viewer gains a good understanding of the circumstances on each side as well as the sequence of events leading up to the attack. The story, by most accounts almost documentary like, is very accurate in depicting the mistakes made by the U.S. military in being caught off guard but it could have been much worse had any of the aircraft carriers been in port which were the real Japanese targets, knowing they had to try to defuse America's air superiority in the Pacific. In the end the Japanese realize they may have won the battle but 'they had awakened a sleeping giant' which they will now have to deal with. The battle scene is spectacular and even more so when you consider it is before computerized graphics and deservedly won the Oscar for visual effects. This is a history lesson that is both entertaining and family friendly. The commentary and additional documentaries with the special addition are excellent. Highly recommend. [...].

B0014DZ2VO|3.0|When Daniel Craig was first chosen to be the next James Bond, many were skeptical that his rugged looks and uncharacteristic blond hair would in a sense destroy a character that so many people knew and loved.  \\"Casino Royale\\" successfully managed to quash those uncertainties with an iron fist and cemented Craig's place in Hollywood history as the renowned secret agent.  \\"Quantum of Solace\\", however, loses confidence with its audience not from its star player but from its surprising inability to tell a good story.<br /><br />This 25th in a long line of Bond films is a first in that it is a continuation of the story from the previous film.  Bond (Craig) is still looking to avenge former lover Vesper Lynd's death and in his haste to catch the culprit, he stumbles upon a mysterious organization that bears the heavy hand of a man named Dominic Greene (Amalric), the head of an environmental organization called Green Planet.  Greene, a ruthless businessman with ties to the CIA and the British government, barters a deal with the exiled General Medrano to overthrow Bolivia's existing government in order for Medrano to regain control of his homeland.  Greene's fee is a piece of land that is considered useless to everyone else but is a really a source of great importance to South America.  While tracking Greene's moves, Bond has a run-in with a Spanish beauty named Camille (Kurylenko) who is looking to settle a score of her own.  With both of their missions extremely personal, 007 and Camille work together to take down Greene and Medrano at the cost of their own lives.<br /><br />The screenwriting team from \\"Casino Royale\\" have returned (Paul Haggis, Neal Purvis, Robert Wade) and while Haggis was offered an opportunity to direct, he turned it down, stating that writing and directing a film would take too long.  I'm a little disappointed he chose to go this route, as \\"Quantum of Solace\\" might've turned out for the better.  Who does take the director's chair this time `round is Marc Forster and a change of directors means a change of pace as well.  Whereas \\"Casino Royale\\" director Martin Campbell and his crew supplied superbly choreographed stunts and a suspenseful story coupled with effective editing, Forster has his action sequences switching frames so frequently that the viewer can hardly tell what is going on.  The overall pacing is so expeditious with so many plot points squeezed in that the story can get confusing rather quickly, making it hard to keep up with what's going on.  If you have poor attention to detail or a short attention span, you'll miss a lot of things and get lost very quickly.<br /><br />Daniel Craig is yet again impressive as the indefatigable James Bond, a man who agilely leaps and sprints from here to there, confiscates and crashes cars with panache and exerts deadly force on his enemies.  Amalric is a bit of an enigma as Dominic Greene - he's one of the least interesting onscreen Bond villains and has no distinguishing physical characteristics that Bond villains are so known for (no eye weeping blood, no steel jaw, no fluffy cat in his lap).  Ukrainian actress Olga Kurylenko sports an admirable Spanish accent as Camille and fairs well for an actress who is fairly new to the big screen.  Dench is eloquent as always as M - at this point, anyone else who took this role just wouldn't measure up.<br /><br />Though I am deeply dissatisfied with Forster's approach to this latest Bond installment, I do award a few points for his homage to previous Bond films (the beginning credits are smothered in sultry female silhouettes), most notably \\"Goldfinger\\".  Those who remember the infamous death scene in which actress Shirley Eaton's nude body was completely covered in gold paint will recognize Forster's mimicry instantly.<br /><br />Bottom line: Forster's attempt at his first Bond film is fair at best, and I do hope it will be his last attempt.  For a man who directed critically acclaimed films like \\"Finding Neverland\\" and \\"Monster's Ball\\", I expected better of him.  Here's to hoping that the next Bond film finds a director with better sensibilities as well as a more simplified story.better of him.

No way. It was.....Ramones.  Bad and nasty. Loud and awful but fun as it gets.. 3 minute cuts that tore like a bat out of hell through your speakers leaving you sweating, picking your nose, chugging bad liqueur and throwing up. Just the way they wanted it. This is one of those \\"can't go wrong\\" albums all these years later. You'll never play it just once for nostalgia sake. It will go into your regular stack to play and play again. There was never another Ramones. Listen to this album and a couple of their later ones and you'll remember why..Not just noise. Great noise.

0887307280|1.0|This is the worst book ever that I read on any subject. Why did this book sold over million copies was the biggest question I had after attempting to read this book. I did not find single page in the book that really useful to me.    I am sure this book sold 1 million copies only because of its title and not the content.    Reasons:  1. Authors language and narration is the worst ever.  2. It is written for those who don't understand business (example one who bakes pie is not necessarily educated or has business degree)  3. The book is very misleading for entrepreneurs and the most de-motivating book ever.   4. This book is written from negative standpoint, people generally need encouragement which is hard to find in this book unless you really want to believe this author and fail in your business.  5. I am okay with franchisee business model, however the the way author presented this case makes be do the opposite i.e to never ever own a franchisee.     Let me say this: Don't ever buy this book, I got this one free from person trying to sell me franchise business and now I hate them for giving me this stupid book.    Why would you trust this review: I have studied Masters in Business Administration and I understand right and wrong approach to small and large business. There are thousands of good books on business and this is the worst ever.

0765342294|4.0|I am not a fan of science fiction literature in general (though I love science fiction cinema), however I will be the first to suggest \\"Ender's Game\\" as a rather exceptional little novel. There's a lot to like in \\"Ender's Game\\", and while it's probably not the perfect novel many fans make it out to be, the characters are memorable, and the story moves along at a fair pace. Indeed, it becomes particularly engaging once you hit the middle, and anticipation builds as the story weaves towards a possibly cataclysmic end.

B0013FSL0C|5.0|I just want to add a few thoughts to the mostly glowing reviews here.  Brilliant conception, astoundingly smart and believable writing, and most of all, microscopically brilliant acting.  The reason this series is as great as the very best HBO shows - including Sopranos, the Wire, Deadwood,etc.-- the ones that have broad visual canvasses lacking on the mostly one-room IN TREATMENT--is that you see as much going on visually on the actors' faces as you did in the striking settings (New Jersey lanscapes, bada bing, dusty Western saloons, dark brothel rooms, etc.) of those other shows.      If Gabriel Byrne did not spend a decade in therapy it's hard to understand how he aced the mannerisms and expressions of psychotherapists. Byrne's face was as active just watching his patients talk as it was when he was talking and gesticulating. And oh, what gesticulating. Every single actor who played one of his patients was not just good but jaw-droppingly good. Layers and layers of thought and emotion, often ones contradicting each other at the same split second in time, can be gleaned off their faces. (All you have to do is watch them as closely as Byrne does.)  Embeth Davidtz's arching eyebrows had so much attitude, her body language betrayed so much ache and anger beneath the  words that were drenched in denial.  Josh Charles peeled open his character over the eight weeks like delicate layers of onion. Blair Underwood's physical and attitudinal bluster was so believable that it was genuinely shocking when his confusion and heartbreak came pouring out toward the end.  Michelle George as Laura was a revelation.  Why isn't this woman a big-time movie star? As right for her character, the actress created a slippery sexuality at once seductive and suspicious; yet still, she managed to reveal a vulnerability perched right at the corner of manipulation and authentic pain. You could never make up your mind about her, which is exactly what was required by the story of this unnerving and unnervingly beautiful character. Dianne Weist couldn't have been more credible as a psychoanalyst if she herself had spent a decade in analytic training.  But perhaps most astonishingly of all, Mia Wasikowska as Sophie, the teenage gymnast, created the most indelible of all the patient characters.  Apparently without much prior acting experience, Wasikowska managed to embody all the contradictions of the most complexly written character on the show, and she brought dimensions beyond what was written.  Her voice, her physicality, her minute facial expressions could not have been any more revealing even when her character was doing everything she could to hide her painful truths not only from Paul the therapist but from herself. How she pulled it off is a miracle of genius acting from a relative neophyte.  The fact that she wasn't even nominated for an Emmy is bizarre.  Who are these people doing the nominating?  The NY TIMES did an article some weeks before announcement of the Emmy nominations calling for her nomination.  You'd have to be blind, deaf, and certainly dumb not to have been dumbfounded by her performance.  I guess she gets something of a last laugh; I just read that she was cast by Tim Burton as the lead in his upcoming version of \\"Alice in Wonderland.\\"  HE was certainly paying attention watching her perform IN TREATMENT.      The direction and everything else was perfect, and the script, transmogrified somewhat from the Israeli version, was as layered and brilliant as the acting that fleshed it all out.  So I am thrilled to have also just read that the series has been renewed.  It is being filmed now, it seems, and will be aired sometime in 2009.  Maybe that's why they delayed the release of the DVD of season one - wanting it out just as the second season begins.      Don't miss this show; it's one for the ages, and I have a sense that it will become the humongous hit it deserves (I guess it was a moderate hit when first aired)when more people see thesecond season.
B000TSJU0E|4.0|This is a 25th anniversy re-issue of ZZ Top's seminal album, Eliminator. This came out originally my senior year of high school, and with it's combination of music and stylish videos, it was a MAJOR hit at the time. I owned this as a pre-recorded cassette when it was new, and held onto that for a long time. I likely dumped it when I dumped all my old tapes years ago.<br /><br />But the music has always carried on. It's been cleaned up for this issue, which is a two disc release. The first is the album. The remastering work is really quite good. It sounds great to my ears, and given that I never owned this on CD, it's nice to hear some of the songs that don't get the usual airplay again. Possibly the most well known track from the album \\"Legs\\" appears here in it's original form. What I didn't realize is that the version that most people know - the one on the album that most people had was not the original. Apparently the original album version (which is here) was replaced with the slightly different mix for the single/video. Both are here - and I have to say I prefer the single version, the \\"original\\" version feels like it is missing something.<br /><br />There are also some live tracks which don't sound terribly up to snuff recording wise. The second disc has the four videos (Gimme All Your Lovin, Sharp Dressed Man, Legs, & TV Dinners) from the classic days, as well as some live concert footage from November 1983.<br /><br />While this is a double disc, I can't imagine myself listening to the extras more than a couple of times. The album itself - yeah. But the extra live tracks are a snooze, and I've seen the videos more times than I care to remember. :) Still, having said that the actual Eliminator album is fantastic. This could have been a single disc release and been far more streamlined.

B001DU8T6S|4.0|First off, let me start off by saying I know this album isn't technically a \\"Queen\\" album. It's officially being billed as \\"Queen and Paul Rodgers\\". However, I'm filing it under Queen anyway. :)<br /><br />Freddie Mercury is dead, and I think most everyone assumed that after 1995's \\"Made in Heaven\\", that was it for Queen studio material. Mercury was so iconic of a voice, there really was no way you can replace a voice like that. And for the longest time, it stayed that way, until around 2004 when Queen was inducted into the UK Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Things moved, and Roger Taylor & Brian May started working with Paul Rodgers. Queen bassist John Deacon had retired from music completely, and from what I can gather gave the project his blessing. So they went forward with the intent of making a new album eventually. That is what this is. The first new studio album in bloody well forever that bears the name Queen. Yeah, yeah, yeah - it's not \\"technically\\" a Queen album, bit realistically, it is.<br /><br />I loved Queen, and kind of always wanted them to carry on, but had no idea who could pull it off. Rodgers sounds nothing like Mercury, and I suppose that's probably the way to go. You might be able to find someone who could (sort of) mimic Mercury, but I doubt they'd want to do that (although Journey has had success with some singers who mimic Steve Perry). I wasn't sure how this album would sound. I know there was a live album, but I never heard it. So I took a blind stab and bought this without hearing anything.<br /><br />I rather enjoy it! It's definitely not that true \\"Queen\\" sound. I think that's partially because one of the unheralded things that made Queen \\"Queen\\" was John Deacon. Oh sure, they all played their parts, but with Deacon not here, there's something missing. However, there is enough of the Queen sound (May's guitar, the harmonizing) to make it sound somewhat like Queen. Of course, with the vocalist being Rodgers, it's going to sound like his work with Bad Company, and his own material. The blending works for me. I see this album being trashed online, but I think it's an easy target, and people aren't giving it a fair shake. Now that's not to say it's the best album I've ever heard. It's not. But it's a good listen, and I enjoy the tracks. Cosmos Rockin, Time to Shine, Warboys, We Believe, Voodoo, and C-Lebrity all stick out as good tracks. We Believe in particular feels like \\"Queen\\" to me.<br /><br />If you were an old school Queen fan, I'm not sure if i can predict how you'll feel about this disc. There is good stuff here, and there is some filler. However, if you miss the guitar work of Brian May, check it out. You might enjoy it.is own material. The blending works for me.

But it's a good listen, and I enjoy the tracks. Cosmos Rockin, Time to Shine, Warboys, We Believe, Voodoo, and C-Lebrity all stick out as good tracks. We Believe in particular feels like \\"Queen\\" to me.    If you were an old school Queen fan, I'm not sure if i can predict how you'll feel about this disc. There is good stuff here, and there is some filler. However, if you miss the guitar work of Brian May, check it out. You might enjoy it.
B00168OINK|5.0|DreamWorks seems to have struck gold with this nice family friendly film.  Top-notch animation, a humorous performance that isn't too silly and a great story about finding the Dragon Master from within shine through on the disc-based version of this film (at least it shines very nicely on the Blu-ray disc).<br /><br />As some have noted the Blu-ray package unfortunately doesn't include all of the material of the DVD package, but it doesn't mean those with Blu-ray players shouldn't grab this excellent disc.  The animation comes through extremely well and the level of detail in this Blu-ray rivals that of a disc I would previously have called reference quality (the Disney movie about a rat named Remy ;-)).<br /><br />Don't fear investing in this disc as it's sure to be a treasured addition to your own collection.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|I've been a Metallica fan for quite some time. The first album of theirs I bought was Ride the Lightning back in the early 80's. I've continued to buy all their releases, even through the time when most of their early fans abandoned them. You either liked the early stuff, and hated the post Black Album material, or you only liked the newer stuff. Hardly did you ever find a Metallica fan that liked both. I'm one of the latter. I liked both. They had a different feel on the latter albums, but I still liked it. Having said that, since I grew up with albums like Puppets & Justice, I did long for an album like that again. We sort of got it with St Anger (rather underrated), but Death Magnetic was it.<br /><br />This is the album they should have made after And Justice For All. This feels like old school Metallica, yet with modern production values. Normally when I write one of these things, I say which tracks I like, and why. But I'm not doing that. This disc is totally solid (save for one song which I'll talk about in a bit) from front to back. The first track just starts off with that \\"WHAM\\", and it doesn't let you go. It's one of those discs that when I was listening to it in my truck and it finished, I just let it repeat. It's fantastic. Has the twin guitar sound, there's solos again, and we have some good Lars drums. By far and away, not even funny - the best thing since 1989.<br /><br />The one track I don't care for is \\"The Unforgiven III\\". Musically it doesn't fit with anything else on the album. Now that I can deal with - most albums have a track that doesn't sound like the rest of the album. That's not why. I don't like it for two reasons. First, I just don't care for the tune. Secondly is the title. If you're going to bother calling something a \\"three\\", then it would stand to reason that it would bear some resemblance to the two previous entries that bear it's namesake. This does not. I totally fail to see why it's called \\"Unforgiven 3\\", it might as well been called \\"Random Other Song\\", and it would have worked better, I think.<br /><br />However, that's just one track. All the others are bloody well fantastic. If you are a Metallica fan, and gave up on them awhile back - this is what you have wanted. It's a Metallica renaissance. Go get it.ther Song\\", and it would have worked better, I think.    However, that's just one track. All the others are bloody well fantastic.

B000063DHK|5.0|This cd is great!!Every good thing i've heard is true,this truly is the best live cd!!!
B001BKG9SA|4.0|I have been a David Gilmour fan for a long time. Got into Pink Floyd back in the late 70's not long after he put out his first solo album (which is now 30 years old as I write this). Followed him through all the years of Floyd, his solo albums, and all that. When I heard he was putting out a live album, I wasn't terribly sure I was going to get it. Live albums are a mixed bag with me. If you saw the tour a live album came from, then it's kind of a must purchase. But if you weren't, you're essentially buying the same songs again. So I kind of waffled.<br /><br />Then I saw the track listing, and it was quite varied. Went into the ancient days of Pink Floyd (60's era), and hit the usual Floyd hits. It also had quite a few songs from his third solo album. If there was any disappointment for me, it was that there were not any tracks from David's first two solo albums - there's a lot of good stuff there (mostly on the second), but that wasn't a major deal. The selling point for me was Rick Wright. As one of the founders of Pink Floyd (Gilmour was not), it kind of felt more like a Floyd album with two of the guys there, so I pre-ordered it. Then Rick Wright died before it was released. It kind of turned into a tribute because of that.<br /><br />The music itself was quite good. It was recorded on the final date of the tour for his On an Island album. It was in Gdansk Poland - in the shipyards made famous by Lech Walensa (sp?). The track selection was pretty good, had some stuff I was not expecting (Astronomy Domine, Echoes!), and I did enjoy hearing live version of his third solo album. So yeah, I enjoyed it. I'm not terribly sure it's for everyone though. This does have a unique feel in that there's an orchestra playing. Lots of bands do that now, but this seems to fit the music more than most bands who just go \\"Oh, here's an orchestra, too\\".<br /><br />A bit of a note here. There were MANY different versions of the thing. David Gilmour's site details all of them, but I bought the 2 CD / 1 DVD version myself.version myself.
0439023483|4.0|Book Came in great condition. The slip cover was impeccable. Delivery was normal for Amazon, and the book was great. It starts slow but it sure does build up and then its nearly impossible to put down. Apparently it is the first book of three I believe, so we have a while to wait to see what happens next! Stephenie Meyer is a big fan of this book and thats how I heard about it. She is a fan for a reason. Suzanne Collins is a great writer.
B00009XITQ|5.0|I love this movie and had a hard time finding it in our local stores.  I loved the fact that I ordered it and it came in a timely manner.  I enjoy the convenience of shopping with Amazon.
B001ED7C58|5.0|This CD has a very good variety of music on it. I would have to say that the biggest problem on it is \\"Bella's Lullaby\\". It is a beautiful song, no one can argue that but it is also very short and in my opinion has too much orchestra in it for what was supposed to be a piano only piece. The heaviest song on the album is probably the Linkin Park one, there are a few on there that have a little dance/techno feel to them and of course there is one by Robert Pattinson (Edward!) where he mumbles alot but still sounds like a sexy John Mayer. Over-all GREAT soundtrack. Love muse and Paramore, and some lesser known bands. ENJOY!
1433502429|5.0|This is an awesome Bible with informative notes, great book introductions, and colorful maps throughout the text.  I love it!
B0010X8NF0|3.0|it took me three days and many pauses to get through this. That said, I think it's a high quality film and a delightful look at India. I liked the soundtrack of Indian music. Much of the humor is so subtle as to be almost missed one time around. It's precious, but you'll enjoy this, if not savor it.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|This is my new favorite CD.  And not only mine, but people in my office have highjacked it as well.  People who's musical tastes are completely different to mine love this CD.  Can't wait for the next one.
B000001ZS4|5.0|I purchased this at the same time as Les Chants Magnetiques (Magnetic Fields) and Oxygene.  I know the album Magnetic Fields because I owned it back in the seventies.  This is every bit as good as the other two.  I like them all.
0887308589|5.0|This is one of the books that I reread from time to time to remind myself of its insights, because they are important. In fact, recent events have made this book more topical than I'd like. You can probably skip the articles by the usual financial pundits about why the US banking system has tanked. Scott Adams' model explains the incompetence that permeates so many corporations in simple and plausible terms. His conclusions appear quite applicable to what is currently going on.
B000001ZS3|5.0|I never knew that there were other albums recorded by Jarre until now.  I bought this CD because of reviews on Amazon about the CD Les Chants Magnetiques.  By the way, when I bought that album back in the seventies, it was called by the English name, Magnetic Fields.  Probably because no one at that time would have bought it with a French title.  This CD is just as good as Magnetic Fields, which is great.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Simply put, this is the best war epic in history! And now it's on Blu Ray!
B000001ZS5|5.0|Bought this album when it first came out in the seventies, liked it then, still like it now.
0062515675|5.0|I got 1/2 way through the book and loved it.  However, my puppy decided to take it from my nightstand and eat it as an appetizer.  So I never got to finish it.
B0018QQQK8|2.0|the first part is good   the middle boring and reduntant  the end is exciting and satisfying.would be a better short  story.
B000006SGT|5.0|The Animals were much more than a cover band, but Oh, they did covers so well. This is not a best of CD. So I would highly recomend this along with their Retrospect CD for a great sampling of just how talented The Animals were. Both are a must have for any British Rock fan.
0786860707|5.0|Must have for anyone interested in the process of creating Disney animation.  It covers the early years of Disney design up to about the 1980s.  It's hard bound with a great looking cover.  Kids love looking at the pictures of their favorite characters in all stages of development.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Exciting, captivating, and a little bit scary...that's Supernatural. The chemistry between the brothers is amazing and drives this thrilling show. Great writing, great acting, compelling storyline. I don't buy TV shows because they get old fast, but I will watch this over and over again. BUY IT!
0440238153|2.0|I couldn't get into this series. It took me forever to read the entire trilogy because I just couldn't engage myself with it. I read the three books a couple of pages at a time with large breaks in between. I finished it out of pure stubborness.<br /><br />Its not that the books were bad. Because the idea behind them was quite interesting.<br /><br />My problem was that I didn't like any of the characters. The only one I vaguely liked was Will and even then... after two books, I felt like I didn't know him any better than the moment he was first introduced.<br /><br />That's my problem with the trilogy. There is no 'personal' moments where you feel you can really understand and identify with the characters. They are just soldiers. Shadows. They couldn't possibly be anything else because Pullman never told us what they were thinking. Lyra for example was on this amazing journey, but we were never told what she thought about it. Will was given this huge responsibility to wield the knife, but once again, we never heard a word about how this made him feel.<br /><br />I'm a very character driven person.I like books where I feel I know the characters on a personal level and feel like I'm there in the story with them.<br /><br />This trilogy was just all events... no emotion.

B00068IOWC|5.0|We can´t deny that the tracks of this wonderful album are awesome can we?  The most relevant song is \\"Original of the Species\\" such an incredible anthem that you can create in your mind to understand and improve our human nature.  Beyond the lyrics U2 show us every time that they are forever in our hearts and soul, besides we have to remember that U2 make a promise wich consists in if they make 2 crap albums they´re out of the business and separate forever, so, go U2 forever!
0765316897|5.0|This is a very satisfying end to the Mistborn Trilogy. The book has all of the elements that made the first two novels so enjoyable and you can really see the growth in the authors writing as he finishes the story! If you are a fantasy fan then this series is highly reccomended. You won't be sorry you did! Epic battles, well written relationships both friends and romance and a fully realized world that will draw you in and keep you interested in all of the characters and invested in their lives and struggles or triumphs. Brandon Sanderson is one of the best I've ever read in Fantasy when dealing with the blurry line between good and evil.

B000068TPN|5.0|One of the best Vietnam war movies made, \\"We Were Soldiers\\" features some of the most realistic combat scenes conveying the \\"fog of battle\\" and horror of combat.  The story development may seem slow at first, but allows some appreciation of the characters involved and the context of the battle.  The action is fast paced, showing the battle from both the North Vietnamese and American points of view, but is broken by the juxtaposition of poignant events on the home front and political machinations in the rear areas.<br /><br />Mel Gibson is surprisingly exceptional as the gung-ho Colonel Hal Moore, Sam Elliot seems born to the role of the salty Sergeant Major Basil Plumley, and the entire supporting cast does a wonderful job.  The cinematography and special effects go a long way towards recreating the confusing swirl of a battle with ill-defined lines.<br /><br />The film is perhaps flawed only by its attempts to cover too many social and political issues in the one film; forgivable in the context of creating a story intended as a microcosm of the entire Vietnam War.  This does however, lead to short scenes seemingly out of step with the rest of the film.  Additionally, there are some unrealistic liberties (Killed in Action telegrams arriving home during the first night of battle), but it is simply artistic license required to make the story work.  If you're willing to remember a film has limited time to tell its tale, these flashes into the social, political and personal issues go a long way in back-filling the context of the story and the conflicting emotions and views of the characters.<br /><br />In the end, this is a movie of war and the people involved, and it is a very good one.

0743201140|1.0|I bought this book NEW at a bookstore that was going out of business.     I was really enjoying reading it until I got to Chapter 3, which directs you to go online and take their StrengthsFinder test using the \\"unique\\" code on the jacket of the book.     I was disgusted to learn that someone has already used the code (or so I am told by the FAQ on the site). Then I realized that this entire book, which reads remarkably fast and could probably be condensed down to 50 pages, is just a tool to get people to go to the site and \\"upgrade\\" to the latest version of the online test. How can you do that? Can you buy access separately? Nope. You HAVE to buy a book to get a code. And of course, when you get your book there's no way to ensure that someone hasn't already peeked inside the jacket and grabbed the code.     At least I paid a discount price for the book, but I'm not really interested in reading any further, nor in buying their latest \\"upgraded\\" book.     What a fantastic marketing tool to ensure that lending or selling the book is useless. When I say \\"marketing tool,\\" I'm referring to the person behind this debacle.

006016848X|1.0|The fact that millions of people believe the advice in this book is astonishing.      First and foremost, John Gray is NOT a phD from an accredited university.  It is a certificate from an online school that was closed down by the state of California for \\"running a degree mill.\\"  In fact, if you do your research, you will find only his high school diploma is accredited.  Do I think that only an accredited phD has valid advice?  No.  But anyway you slice it, slapping phD all over book covers when you aren't is extremely deceitful and misleading.    That being said, I found this book to be very degrading to women.  Statements along the lines of \\"When the Venusians (women) first saw the Martians (man) they said 'We need you for your strength and power!'\\" and \\"women find value in being cherished by a man\\" are infuriating.  Everything about this book insinuates that women need men to take care of them and only feel valuable in the long run if they have a man.       I did find some valid, insightful information in this book, but why John Gray has to pinpoint these insights to either the man or the woman and not on people as a whole is beyond me.  Also, the constant referral of men and women as beings from other planets is tiresome and completely unnecessary.  We get it.  The genders are different in more ways than our reproductive organs.  Speak to us as though we are adults, please.     In my opinion, this book is not a book I would give my daughter or son for relationship advice.  Instead I would suggest a book that offers advice that is directed to different personalities...not genders.
B00020HEL6|5.0|This young lady is the most exciting singer I have heard in many years.  I would describe her as a cross between Linda Ronstadt and Peggy Lee.  It is difficult to find 40's Standards music.  Let alone good music.  I hope she continues, not only with her singing, but with this style of music for which I believe she is very well suited.  Not to mention how beautiful she is.  It is so hard to believe she was 14 when making this recording.

B001E7OO2I|3.0|I LOVE John Legend. LOVE!!! But this album is mediocre at best. Favorite songs: Green Light, It's Over, Everybody Knows, I Love you love, Good Morning. You have classic John Legend with Good Morning (sidebar-It kills me when an artists album has no rhyme or reason to song order like why is Good Morning the intro? I digress) Overall, I understand the need to Evolve, but the album evolved into typical r&b. This sounds more like a first album when an artist is trying to discover their niche. May I add, just because an artist has a niche doesn't mean their cornered by their music. Green Light is a super hot dance song, and had the song writing and production throughout the album would have mirrored the freshness and creativity of Green Light and the relatable lyrics of Everybody Knows, then this would have been a hit album. This is just not a fan album.  I still LOVE John Legend, but I'm ready for next.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|The movie will leave you feeling good.  It's a heartwarming animated movie where the main characters are robots.  The catch is PIXAR has done an extraordinary job of portraying emotion through these robots.  While saying nothing, they effectively convey paragraphs, without the aid of human facial expression.    Everybody I know who has seen WALL-E has been taken in by the main characters and thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie.    The rest of my posting is a note of the social commentary and everybody's interpretation of it.  In a nut shell - Many people leaving posts seem to interpret the take-away message of the movie as \\"Overweight people are typically lazy and uninterested and attached to tv screens.\\"  I think the message is actually the reverse: \\"lazy and uninterested people who are attached to tv screens typically end up overweight.\\"  Details Below.....    There is a running theme in the movie, that I interpret as : If we all continue to increase our \\"plugged-in\\" time, we will not end up in a very favorable state.  By \\"plugged-in\\" time, I mean time spent surfing the internet, watching television, text-messaging, playing computer games, etc.      A prime example was when humans in the movie were next to each other, they still talked via video-conferencing using their personal screen/camera.  Thus they never actually had to interact with anything but their personal screen/camera.  I fear this may be an all-to-real commentary - I have seen a drastic increase in the amount of time people spend \\"plugged-in\\" over the last 10 years.    The next part of the commentary: the unfavorable state.  The humans in the movie are all overweight.  They move around in portable chairs, eat all their meals via milkshake, and appear to be quite unintelligent.  I take this to be the direct result of too much time spent sitting in front of a screen.  I acknowledge that not everybody who sits in front of a screen all day becomes fat, lazy or unintelligent, but nobody can argue that time spent in front of a screen (unless you are watching something educational/historical/fact-based) is going to improve health, energy levels or mental acuity.    It makes me sad to read the many posts where people cite WALL-E as a bad commentary with the message \\"fat people are lazy unintelligent blobs.\\"  I think it's a chicken and egg thing, and I do believe that people who are lazy and inactive tend to get overweight, while people who are intellectually uninterested in thinking and learning will normally not show very high mental abilities (since they do not exercise their minds!).    Some people have argued that children will take away the message that overweight people are lazy and stupid.  I'm not really qualified to determine that.  I would guess that it will depend on age and upbringing.
B001DDBCUA|1.0|I'm so glad I didn't stand in long lines waiting to see SATC when it premiered in movie theaters. This film was a gigantic let down, after too much hype to begin with. Basically the film was another vehicle for SJP to wear some hideous designer clothes. Other than that, the film lacked substance and I can't imagine them planning on yet ANOTHER SATC movie! I think I'll pass on that one.
0765316897|4.0|I was eagerly awaiting the final book in the Mistborn trilogy and I was not disappointed. I don't know if it's just me but I am generally disappointed in most fantasy series endings either because they are so far fetched or they are too generic. The ending to the Mistborn series was definately not a generic ending and while it was a little out there, it was acceptable. The rest of the book was just great. I really enjoyed the ride to the ending.   This book, just like the second book, rewrites history and how we should interpret the reign of the Lord Ruler and the actions of the original crew. I look forward to rereading the series with this new insight.   Overall, the book is very good and the series as a whole ranks very high on my fantasy series favorites.

0375826726|3.0|The book starts off clunky and that despite the good intentions of CP, it sets a bad tone for the rest of the novel. The narrative seems mostly forced, mechanical, severely lacking the magic that weaved its way through 'Eragon'. The dramatic scenes in the book were cheasy, hell even the death of you-know-who was melodramatic. It's as if CP said \\"Well how can I beat some life into this dying horse? mmm...I know lets do so and so, to you know who!\\"   Some good points of the book:  - Another part of the prophecy that herbalist Angela foretold comes to fruition.  -The complex interactions of Nasuada and Eragon leaves me to wonder if Angela's prophecy was referring to Arya or the new Varden Leader.  -We learn how Galbatorix has become so powerful.  -The writing style was good. However, at times I thought CP was taking lessons from A. Rice, with how convoluted some of the sentences got.    Thats my 2 cents.
B000W91RUG|5.0|A friend recommended this show to me that I had never heard of, and showed me the first episode.  I was immediately hooked.  The show is smart and hilarious - I can honestly say it made me laugh until I cried. The humor is intelligent (the physics jokes and references throughout the show are all completely accurate, too - they had a physicist on the board for the show.) The cast is unbelievable - Jim Parsons (Sheldon) and Johnny Galecki (Leonard) in particular. Poor Leonard is adorable in the way he is smitten with Penny and Sheldon just plain steals the show. Kaley Cuoco (Penny), Kunal Nayyar (Raj), Simon Helberg (Howard) and Sara Gilbert (Leslie) make up the rest of the cast, and are just as fantastic. There is not enough good I can possible say about the writing - just spectacular. Not many extras on the DVD -  some deleted scenes, and a couple featurettes. Rating: 6 stars our of 5.

B001G9LV9S|5.0|Along with \\"Teaser and the Firecat\\" this album represents  the first half of the greatest one/two punch a singer songwriter has ever released. Recorded in around 1970 ...the spare instrumentation and wonderfully timeless songs still hold up today!    The remastering was excellent on  the previous edition so that isn't the big deal here...its the bonus CD. While not as exciting as the Bonus disc for Teaser which featured many solo demo recordings by Cat Stevens...the bonus tracks  on this....mostly \\"live\\" versions of the album tracks are still a welcome addition  to the collection of any Cat Stevens  fan...and I'm not ashamed to say I am and have always been. The singular Demo...the classic \\"wild world\\" by Cat on acoustic guitar is worth the price alone for me....the booklet that comes with it features some nice pix and an intro written sept  '08 by Cat and  notes from his producer and guitarist..  a very nice presentation of one of the greatest albums of all time!    Enjoy....
B001GAPC1K|1.0|As everyone is already aware, this movie itself is AWESOME.  However, the production company is making a HUGE mistake in not offering the standard surround sound audio with this title in ENGLISH!  They provide it with other languages (French and Spanish) but not the universal language?  Instead, they include ONLY True-HD which is fine as long as you have a receiver capable of receiving it (i.e. less than a year old).  So, unless you plan to upgrade your receiver you will only get 2-channel audio and that is NOT what we are buying this title for...
B000AJJNPY|5.0|This record is one of the most amazing and extraordinary things that happened in music in the last years. There are no words to describe it. Just BUY it. From minute 1 until the end, it is perfect.
0385340567|1.0|I discovered Lee Child and Jack Reacher 2 years ago in the form of the Persuader and loved it. My wife and I continued to read the series and these are some of the best escapist novels I have come across in some time. With that said, I feel jilted.    I pre-ordered this one as a hardback expecting another adventure true to form and got a commercialized forced political statement that cost me $17. The politics were not even subtle, but way overdone 3 fold. I fear that Jack Reacher has jumped the shark. I will wait for the reviews in the future and likely not ever purchase another Reacher/Child book again.    I have never reviewed a novel on Amazon before, but this one was so bad I was obligated to do my first. We each have our political opinions and they are floated about free on a daily basis. I do not need or want them in escape artist novels! They do not work!
B000N2HCM4|5.0|a  truly amazing book. an in depth look at Obama's life from childhood to adulthood. i recommand this book to young scholars who are curious about our next president's life.
1573229725|3.0|the first half of this book was so good, i was in shock!<br />it starts in a slow but very engaging way... turns surprisingly great...<br />but the second part of the story was too much for me...<br />i lost interest, i wanted so bad to know what would happen with the main characters, but it just turned too complicated and unengaging...<br />it all makes sense and it's kind of fascinating, but the emotional grip dissapears and i was a little dissapointed to feel turned down after such a compelling first half.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|This set contains almost exactly what I wanted.  The most important releases by one of my favorite bands, remixed in 5.1 surround.  But there's quite a bit more than that.      It also contains nearly all of the existing video footage of the band from that time.  Let that soak in.  Most of it is in better quality than ever seen before.  I think my VHS copy of the Midnight Special performance might be in better shape than theirs, but that's a minor complaint.    The set also contains the recently rediscovered Jackson Tapes.  This was a 1970 recording session for a documentary about the painter Michael Jackson.  In this recording, you can hear the compositional beginnings of The Fountain of Salmacis, Anyway, and the Musical Box, but with Anthony Phillips playing guitar.  Makes me wonder if perhaps Anthony Phillips should have been getting royalties and songwriting credits on the Nursery Cryme album.  Anyway is almost certainly a Tony Banks piece.  But the Fountain and Musical Box were band compositions.  Fascinating recordings to hear, that perhaps add a new wrinkle to the Genesis story.    But lets get back to the primary content... the surround mixes.  Expletive exclamation!!!  I haven't owned the set long enough to have heard and watched all of it.  There's an awful lot to it, which is actually another of its features.  But what I have listened to is outstanding.  You hear individual musicians performances in much sharper definition.  You hear elements that were hidden if not entirely absent.  Back in NYC highlights the backing vocals in such a way that it is almost a new song.  Many will complain about things like that.  Let them.  The band themselves have never been satisfied with the original mixes that were released on LP.  There are moments in a handful of songs throughout the set where the new mix removes some of the impact you felt at a particular crescendo.  This is a shame.  But it is the only thing I can find fault with.  Nick Davis has done an admirablejob with the task he was given.  I can't give him an A+ but a solid A certainly.    This boxed set is an absolute treasure.  Even if you are not particularly familiar with early Genesis, but you like the progressive and classic rock of the 1970s, you could not go wrong in purchasing this set.  You are in for a treat.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I am a high school teacher, that being said, I decided on the last day of  school that as a treat we would watch a movie. I borrowed Napoleon Dynamite from my brothers vast DVD collection. I had no idea what the movie was about but my students told me it was funny. I looked it up on IMDB to see its rating. It is PG because of the word \\"piss\\" and a man selling breast enlargement pills. Pretty tame stuff in this day and age.    I watched it three times in one day. The first viewing I was confused...it did not seem that funny. The second and third time I watched it I just laughed and laughed through out the whole movie.    It grows on you, and you will find yourself laughing about lines from the movie at odd times through out your life.     I do recommend this movie. It is just SWEET, in every sense of the word.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|This is a great transfer.  And the 5 minute prologue gives you a sweet taste of how great The Dark Knight will look on Blu ray.
0307455874|5.0|The book was excellent, and helped me form my impression of how good a President I thought Sen. Obama would make.
B000BGR0OM|5.0|This was a well acted out music video; not just a stand up singer with a band. Absolute enjoyment.
B000001G8I|4.0|I purchased this CD at the recommendation of my choir director, as we are performing it in March 2009 and it is sung most similarly to how she will conduct it. As she had mentioned, there are some odd pronunciations which I would have noticed even had she not said. There are a few overly dramatic holds at the end of some of the pieces but overall it is well done and what I needed as I am rehearsing it mostly on my own (due to missing rehearsals from business travel). I will probably try another recording of this beautiful work at some point.
031606792X|3.0|I have loved all the books in this series, except this last one.  The others were fresh, with a new style of writing.  Breaking Dawn, seems more formula in its style and story content.  For most of the read, I thought \\"who wrote this?\\". It seems so unlike Meyers writings.  Too much is happening at a too fast pace.  This book has lost the strong romance of the other books. This book could have been written by any other author.  Its not different or special like the other book in this series.   I almost did not finish it. So much was boring.  It seems like Meyers after deciding this would be the last in the series, put everything she could think of crammed into one book. Aside from promoting that an 18yr. old rush into marriage, sex and then a baby. I sure hope young adults don't follow this path.   I wish this book had been as wonderful as the others.  Very disappointed.
B001ECQ6YW|5.0|I had an opportunity to watch Kung Fu Panda with the family last night.  The movie was very entertaining with several laugh out loud moments.  Po Panda, as voiced by Jack Black, was hilarious with many witty one-liners.  Other voice work actors included Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, Seth Rogan, and Dustin Hoffman, excellent as the voice for Kung Fu master Shifu.<br /><br />The film is rated PG as there are numerous scenes involving martial arts combat.  I did not find it too violent for young children over the age of 9 years old.  I am sure it would not be bad for younger as well, but that is each parent's call.<br /><br />The message in the movie was very positive and delivered in a way that was a lot of fun.  This is a movie that the entire family can enjoy, as mine sure did.<br /><br />I give this a strong 4.5 star rating.  Great fun, funny, and with a great message.  Enjoy!
1400082773|5.0|It's hard to see how anyone could validly ask \\"Do you really know Barack Obama?\\" when this little book is readily available and so readable.  In the Information Age we've got so many sources about most of our political candidates that ignorance is no longer an excuse in the voting booth (or elsewhere, if you opt for a mail-in ballot).      Barack's narrative is modest, self-disclosing and completely lacking in the hubris that has poisoned the administration in Washington for the last 8 years.  In short, I found this book completely genuine and honest.  It convinced me that \\"what you see is what you'll get\\" in President #44.      \\"No Drama Obama\\" is *so* cool under pressure, and sets such high standards for personal responsibility that I feel I know him.  Those traits come through in this book.  He raises the bar for all of us: Blacks, Whites, Democrats, Republicans, Men and Women, GLBTS's, and religious minorities.  Isn't that what our great experiment in Democracy is supposed to be all about?      I read most of \\"Audacity of Hope\\".  My interest waned when I realized Pres. Obama's policies were pretty much a carbon copy of my own.   Dreams from My Father convinced me that I share his ultimate objectiives, values and worries as a father, husband and human being as well.    I am an unrepentant Progressive, concerned more about our grandchildren's futures than those of my own generation.  If you are a hardcore social Darwinist who espouses economic \\"survival of the fittest\\" and \\"May the Devil take the Hindmost\\" this book is not for you.
B000VR824S|5.0|Fast shipping and item was in great condition.  I would buy from this seller again.
B001ED7C58|5.0|everything that I could want from a CD. The music by all the artist are great.  Good value for the price, would buy another for friends and family. If your a Twilight fan, you will enjoy.
B0000025T6|3.0|I am a huge Bruce Springsteen fan, and have nearly all of his CD's, and I am still a huge fan, but I don't think this CD is one of his best.  Don't get me wrong - Springsteen has a knack for telling stories about people who have been through hard times and who have been through the darkest parts of life, and he has a knack for making us feel these characters' pain, but, I think the tone of the music is too low keyed - it's almost as if the music on each track sounds the same.      But, still worth listening to.
0452289963|5.0|I loved this book. The information itself I have been hearing and experiencing for many years as I personally open and grow. It's about waking up people! Becoming conscious and remebering who you are. Thank you Eckhart Tolle for bringing this out in such a big way as we are all in a time of big change.
0553266306|5.0|The Day of the Jackal is set during the 1960s and tells the story of a professional hitman hired to assassinate the president of France, Charles de Gaulle.  The assassin is given the codename \\"Jackal\\" by his employers, hence the name of the book.  The bulk of this novel is given to a detailed description of the Jackal's preparation for the assassination as well as the French government's attempts to identify and stop him.<br /><br />Frederick Forsyth has an unusual style of writing that is very clean and sparse in his use of language, but also highly detailed and meticulous in terms of plotting.  It's obvious that he did a great deal of research before writing and every page of the novel reads as though it is describing real places and real events.  His style has often been described as similar to journalism, and that's not a bad comparison.<br /><br />The closest thing to a weakness that I would cite is that this is not a character driven novel.  While the characters are far from cardboard cutouts, neither are they lavished with a great number of moments that reveal emotional depth.  But this book is not meant to be a melodrama or character study, it's a plot driven novel that does an excellent job of laying out a fascinating story while slowly building suspense until the climax.  In reality, there was no notable weakness at all, this is a very well crafted novel that I highly recommend.
1595141979|5.0|I didn't want the book to end.  But by the time I got to the end I was so drained, emotionally and physically (pacing around reading) I collapsed in a heap.<br /><br />First of all is a change in Rose.  Not only does she view her relationship with Lissa differently, she starts to question her purpose in life and the choices that have been thrust upon her.  The life of a dhampir is one of duty and hardship.  She'd always thought the only other choice was to be be a blood whore, so of course, being a guardian for her best friend, the Dragomir Princess was a better life.<br /><br />But all that is turned on it's head when she discovers the true meaning of what it means to be Shadow Kissed.  That it wasn't just a name given to St. Vladimir's friend and help mate, Shadow Kissed Anna, there was a more relevant meaning behind it.<br /><br />With this knowledge and the disturbing presence of a lost friend, her life is in turmoil when it should have been smooth sailing with Victor Dashkov in prison and the trials going swimmingly for her.<br /><br />Then comes tragedy.  I can't write about it.  I don't want to spoil the book for anyone, I will say this though, I spent over half the book cringing at each page I turned, hoping that I was wrong, that Ms. Mead wouldn't do what I was terrified she would do in the end.  So by the time it happened I was a mess; weepy and depressed.<br /><br />I hate and love this book.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next one, so addicted.
B000BCE918|5.0|This a a great movie trio!  These movies were given to our son and he is such a dinosaur lover.  He has watched them over and over again!  We, in turn, gave them to our friends son who also loves them.  It is very action packed!  It can get a little scary if the kids are too young, but as the mother of my son, I have to admit I enjoyed them too!!!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I've long been of two minds about Disney animated films -- they're often overwritten, sappy, and don't come even close to the fairy tales on which they claim to be based -- but this one is indeed very enjoyable, as shown by the Academy Award it won as best of the year. The story line is original, too: Remy is a French country boy with the makings of a great chef, but there's one big problem. He's a rat. Having found himself in Paris at the restaurant of his late hero, Chef Gusteau, Remy meets up with Linguini, the restaurant's new scullery lad, who has zero cooking talent. But by combining the rat's genius in the kitchen with the young man's human-ness (and his ability to be puppet-controlled by having his hair judiciously yanked beneath his toque), they set Paris on its ear and attract the attention of the city's greatest food critic, Anton Ego (the voice of Peter O'Toole). The characterizations are terrific, the dialogue is fun (especially Lou Romano as Linguini), and the humor is generally subtle. And, like nearly all successful \\"kid's films,\\" it also has a lot for adults; my six-year-old granddaughter and I both enjoyed it.
1878424505|5.0|This book can be read over and over. I pick it up and read it again and again and always get something new. It is simple and practical and about taking personal responsiblity for self! Love this book and the information in it!
B001E75QGG|4.0|I like this movie. Not love, love but definitely like. Fast pacing, good action, if not somewhat farfetched in places, but fun overall. A few plot holes, but nothing major. It is a fantasy adventure after all. A good fourth film for the franchise. I rank it above Temple of Doom.   Excellent picture quality, and I especially like that fact that in the audio portion, the bass fx do NOT overpower all the other audio. It's well balanced. Don't get me wrong, I like lots of bass, but there is a trend now in film to put as much bass in as is possible. And it's not necessary. For example, in 10,000 BC, when the mammoths were just walking through tall grass, their footfalls were given bass that shook my house. Having been to zoos and heard elephants walking around, they just aren't that loud. In fact, they're quite quiet. So anyway, I appreciate the more correct levels in this film. Forgive the rant, just had to.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|I bought it for the song Mercy, after listening to it, all the songs on the CD are good. Well worth the purchase.
B000UAFDP2|5.0|I originally purchased this movie on laser disc, then DVD. There was little or no difference; however the Blu Ray provides clarity and sound that I feel was missed on the previous releases. Excellent movie.<br />Thanks<br />Mills
B0019EXZY4|5.0|Everybody enjoys a good heist flick, and this one is much better than most. Based on the true story of the 1971 robbery of a bank in London's Baker Street, it involves a group of small-time crooks who use ingenuity and imagination to make their big score by tunneling under the bank's vault. And this one turned out to be bigger even than the Great Train Robbery. Terry Leather, whose used car business is slightly bent, is recruited by a woman with whom he used to be involved -- who was strong-armed into it by MI-5, which actually wants to acquire the contents of one of the bank's safety deposit boxes, which includes some incriminating photos involving a Royal Person, which were taken by a Trinidadian hoodlum, whom the government is consequently powerless to arrest. Yes, stated like that, it's a somewhat complicated plot, but the characters explain everything very nicely along the way. Not all the characters survive the robbery's aftermath, but those who do pretty much get away with it -- and are mostly sympathetic, at that. One thing that makes this yarn especially enjoyable, at least to me, is that there are no big-name stars. In fact, Peter Bowles (whom I remember from _To the Manor Born,_ 25 years ago) is the only one I had even heard of. This means the actors are defined entirely by their roles here, and the result is almost like a documentary. The result is much preferable to the _Ocean's Eleven_ remake.
B000009HF2|1.0|All that was sent was Volume 2, which meant I did not get the first side of the album (Baby I Love Your Way, side one, was what my wife wanted). No follow up by seller at all and Amazon just said they were sorry. My first bad experience with Amazon, but it truly stunk -
0891349553|5.0|I have been working in polymer for 37 years as an amature and decided it was time to get some professional tips. This book is full of great ideas and easy to read. The illustrations are numerous and very helpful. Even if your polymer art is very different I would recommend this book.
B001AIRUP4|5.0|The clarity of the Blu Ray disc is unbelievable. Watching this on my Hitachi 57\\" HD TV along with my Sony Play Station 3, it was almost like I could reach out and touch the scenery. I am totally impressed with the sight and sound of this Blu Ray DVD. This disc should be the standard for the others.  Thanks  Mills
B000HIVOI2|5.0|I bought HD as the in coming standard, it wasn't. Bought a Blu-ray player to keep up. I have a standard DVD copy of \\"Stargate\\", so I knew a Blu-ray copy would have something to equal.  Blu-ray quality is noticeably better, volume is some what lower (on my system) than the up-converted standard DVD. Now we need some high quality movies on blu-ray. (I don't care for old comic book hero movies, out grew them 40 years ago.) Special effect are great and ad a lot to a movie, but if all the movie has is special effect.... Well, I'll pass.  \\"Stargate\\" in Blu-ray is well worth the purchase.
0061142026|2.0|*Mild spoilers alert*<br /><br />One of the things I always say about this book is that it is the most extraordinarily okay book I have ever read. It isn't bad, but it isn't particularly good, either. It is just completely and sincerely okay.<br /><br />The fact of the matter is, the only thing that keeps it out of the bad category is Gaiman's talent. The author does have a way with words, and develops some amazing imagery. That being said, the story itself is cliched and predictable. From the very moment I read \\"Tristran Thorn, Tristran Thorn, soon to meet his true love's scorn,\\" the story was over for me. And of course Tristran then met a girl who scorns him. The \\"obstacles\\" Tristran and Yvaine face are obstacles that they are obviously going to overcome and simply leave the reader bored rather than interested to read more.<br /><br />The truly frustrating part was that there were tantalizing glimpses of true talent and innovation, that I desperately wished Gaiman had developed (such as the sky pirates) but they were gone as quickly as they had come and the story was back to another \\"adult fairy tale\\" cliche.<br /><br />Gaiman is clearly a talented man, but Stardust does not leave me wanting to read anything more by him. If I could predict the end of this one almost from the beginning (this one, that everyone seems to love and that was made into a movie) why should I bother reading another?
B000WGWQG8|5.0|[[ASIN:B000WGWQG8 John Adams (HBO Miniseries)]]  If you enjoy American History and some good acting, I would recommend this DVD collection.  I was fortunate to visit the John Adams historic site in Massachusetts, and the series is quite accurate.  It's an inspiring and encouraging story that will lead you to think about the personal struggles and ideals of those who attended the birth of our country.  A well-done film.
0375826726|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I liked the whole series and will look forward to the conclusion in Book 4. The books end leaving you with so many unanswered questions that you can't wait for the next book. Makes it much more interesting and likeable.   Is it the best book I have ever read?  Probably not, but it is definitely worth reading.     I like that the author is writing in-depth about characters. I like big books. Keeps you from wondering \\"I wonder what happened to\\".  It is hard to sum up a story completely with a flash and bang.    I think some of the reviewers are being a bit hard on the author complaining about similarities to other books. Three stars to anyone who can even write a book and get it published.     So if you like flash and bang and want it over quickly, this is the not books for you.    Brisingr and the whole series are a good read!!
B000J6I0PM|5.0|this dvd has everything a crazy woman who has foo fever can ask for.  close ups of dave grohl!!   the music is slowed down and you can hear the lyrics!!  i love it
B000002KOG|5.0|Like some others, I prefer the original pressing. The lovely guitar work, some of Young's best, sounds somehow even better buried in the mix. It is an album of aching beauty. A young fragile voice singing visionary songs; the menace of 'The Loner', the interface between paradise and progress explored in 'Here We Are in the Years', different aspects of love expressed in 'I've Been Waiting For You'  'What Did You do to My Life' and 'I've Loved Her So Long', the lust of 'If I Could Have Her tonight' and the sheer trippiness of 'Last Trip to Tulsa'. And was there ever a more tender threnody to alcoholism than 'The Old Laughing Lady'? I guess Jack Nietzche is largely responsible for the dreamscape ambience which bathes the whole album in a psychedelic haze. This is one of my all-time top ten alongside Astral Weeks, Baxters, Forever Changes, Grace etc.
031606792X|3.0|I started reading the series before it hit fangirl status, and for people who read the books because of the story and not \\"cauze itz sew koolz!!11!!\\" this is basically for you.    In my opinion the story did not end, she simply stopped writing it. The 4th book, while it was a good book, seemed hurried and slapped together. I did fall in love with the books, and with this book the story did not end for me. There is still a lot of books that could be taken from this series if she chooses to write them.    Each section of the book, each stand point, could have been written as books themselves and delved deeper into detail. Instead it just seemed like she hurried to get the book out to appease the gaggle of fangirls that were waiting for it.     Even with the rewrite of the first book, the story won't be finish, just not continued. I still have all these questions that won't be answered. Such and such person got together.... then what? Shes not going to answer that question, She just left it up in the air for our own imaginations. For me, it's not my story to write, therefore I will never have that question answered.     Maybe one day she will listen to the outcry of her fans and continue with the story. I look forward to that day.
B00011F5DK|5.0|My son received this game as a gift when he was 6 years old, and it still is his favorite game 2 years later.  He will actually play against himself to figure out new strategies.  My son has played so much at this point that it is impossible to beat him.  The game has very clear instructions and it doesn't take long at all to learn how to play. you can play with 2 - 4 players, with more players making it more interesting.  The object of the game is to use up as many of your pieces as possible while at the same time blocking your opponents. The pieces are all different shapes which I learned quickly can become challenging. The great thing about this game is that because of the shapes of the pieces it really is different every time you play.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Very great disc for discover Pink Floyd, if you don't want to buy another expensive PF CDs.    I received it very crashed and I had to change the CD box. I don´t know how people can send CDs with no correct protecion boxes...
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I love this series! Its funny and scarry at the same time. I especially love the banter between the two brothers. One of my favorite episodes was episode 17 \\"Hell House\\". This is were the Winchesters where investigating an abandoned haunted house. They bump into a funny group of paranormal investigaters, who claim to be ghost busters. This group of people are also seen in another season episode. It was funny because the \\"Ghost Erasers\\" where scared themselves to check out the place. To Sam and Dean, this was an everyday accurance.

B000RW3VD4|4.0|Oliver Stone's \\"Wall Street\\" chronicles the rise of unbridled greed, of reckless gambling with the other people's money, of soulless financiers whose God is cash.  Some of the details are dated now -- the opening shots of the World Trade Towers, the IBM dumb terminals everywhere, Motorola \\"brick\\" wireless phones, the dollar amounts thrown about as astronomical in 1985 -- but the story behind the details and the motivations of the characters are as good a lesson as you're going to find.  As a matter of fact, in the extras it is revealed that the director and cast used Bear Stearns as the model for their portrayals.  How ironic then that the tagline for the film, \\"Greed is good,\\" should end up eulogizing the era of narcissistic excess that the movie portrays.
0739368044|5.0|I looked all over for the audio of Brisingr but was unsuccessful at locating it in any store, even the large book store chains.

We will be ordering that one too, when it becomes available.
B001CD6FKI|3.0|I have two sons, ages 6 and 4, who love to play Mario Kart on the Nintendo DS. They loved the racing scenese in this movie but the dramatic scenes between each race bored them silly.<br /><br />This is a movie aimed at young boys, but perhaps ages 8-10 is the right target. There's just too much soap opera drama stretching this story past the hour and a half mark for younger kids. However, the dazzling special effects are something you don't want to miss.
0765316897|5.0|the last book of the Mistborn trilogy was, in a word- epic. awesome battles, insane plot twists, gut wrenching emotions! i have never read another author with the ability to so completely blindside the reader at the end of the story. go read Warbreaker at brandonsanderson.com and you'll see what i mean.<br /><br />this book/series is rock-awesome. a must-read (especially since he is finishing the Wheel of Time)
B000088E7Y|1.0|I only got this Album because it was tossed in free with \\"Angels & Harps\\" and please read my review there, as I did not like that either. Now, I LOVE Randy Newman but only since he came out of his earlier suck awful Primitive Blues Period with \\"Little Criminals\\", \\"Born Again\\", \\"Trouble in Paradise\\", and \\"Land of Dreams\\".  These albums all had at least one good song, musically, that one could sit down and play with... I play piano too.  Cute clever lyrics aren't enough.  Even school boys can joke around with words. So what?  Music should be music.     Well, \\"Good Old Boys\\" ain't music.  What was Randy thinking?  Some Record Company Suit was probably ordered by his fat cat Boss to tell Randy that people only cared about those cute lyrics that were so easy to write... that the Music was only getting in the way anyway.  And Randy believed it.  The song \\"Luisiana\\" wasn't even really original that I could tell ... just sounded like \\"Sail Away\\" with new lyrics crowded and shoved into place.     Oh, and on the 2nd Disc there was this talking voice introducing all the songs.  A normal voice.  An ordinary voice.  A vanilla plain jane white bread voice.  Well, it was Randy Newman.  That Thick Oppressed Minority Bluesy Singing Voice, well, it was OBVIOUSLY just some White Bread Upper Class Slummer pulling all our legs, kidding all of us along, making idiots of us all.  The one thing Randy Newman should have NEVER done was to TALK... not with that I AM REALLY VERY NORMAL BUT JUST SING LIKE I AM POOR AND OPPRESSED.     It all became very pathetic.  I feel ashamed of my Randy Newman collection.  I won't show it to anybody for now on.  I will keep \\"Little Criminals\\", \\"Born Again\\", \\"Trouble in Paradise\\", and \\"Land of Dreams\\" because of the seven or eight really good musical songs in that collection, but all that new Primitive Stuff... well, I hope Randy can find a new audiance for it.
B0009I84UG|4.0|This CD is an acquired taste as not everyone will be able to get to grips with the flamenco style singing  of Cigala but the piano playing of Bebo is always great to listen to.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|I'm not writing this review from an adult's perspective. My two sons -- ages 6 and 4 -- really looked forward to Wall-E. This is their review.<br /><br />We downloaded each new movie trailer on my computer and watched them multiple times. (If you haven't seen \\"Vacuum Vignette\\" you should go online and watch it.) The anticpation was greater than any other movie released in the summer of 2008.<br /><br />Both of my sons gave this movie their \\"GG\\" rating -- Good! Good! They've never offered anything higher than \\"GGG\\" so I translated their rating into a four-star review here.<br /><br />The first 25 minutes of this movie worried me because there's no dialogue, but Pixar had my kids captivated. In summary, this is a touching family comedy and love story that never forgets to entertain its main audience -- kids.<br /><br />Good news: The DVD includes two animated shorts: \\"Presto Amazing\\" from the original theatrical release and the all-new \\"Burn-E.\\"<br /><br />I also recommend these Pixar films:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0009MAO46 Toy Story (1995)]]<br />[[ASIN:B000B8QG0O Toy Story 2 (1999)]]<br />[[ASIN:B00005JKDR Monsters, Inc.

B00125WAWS|5.0|Highly, recommended as a movie to be watched by students in the various  school systems. For encouragement, dedication and building of character .  Excellent production.
B000EGFVQS|5.0|I sell books here on amazon and on ebay.  I opened this book to see what sub category I should list it in.  The teaser caught my eye and I thought I would read the first chapter.  I ended up finishing the complete book in one night.  I loved it.  It was a new concept, not something overdone and very well written.
B0019M06JS|5.0|Any CD that Eliane Elias brings out is guaranteed to be a best seller. She is a terrific pianist, singer and performer and this CD doesnt disappoint in any way. Toots Thielman's rendition on one track is goose- bump making. This is a must for all Eliane Elias fans to have in their collection.
B001ECQ75A|4.0|MY sons, ages 6 and 4, haven't stopped practicing their Kung Fu moves in our living room, cutting the air with their hands and feet. More importantly, the story's message -- believing in yourself and reaching for your dreams -- is not lost on them.<br /><br />Po, the titular panda, is often silly but he's never mean-spirited in his pursuit of his destiny. My sons cheered him on as he and the Furious Five took on kung fu warrior Tai Lung.<br /><br />Most of the laughs occur during Po's training, as he befuddles master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman gets in some great lines here) and offends the Furious Five -- Tigress, Monkey, Mantis, Crane and Viper, only to later gain their respect.<br /><br />This is a fun movie for young kids. Parents can relax knowing it is age-appropriate entertainment that will be enjoyed for repeat viewings.
B00004WKII|5.0|I was actually at 4 of Hendrix performances in the San Francisco Bay Area. This CD captures the essence of Jimi live and in the studio as I would imagine him to be. Jimi, Noel, and Mitch who I just saw last week at a Tribute concert in SF are there to be heard as they were meant to be. I could imagine being there as I listened. I recommend this set of CD's for any true fan of Jimi and The Experience as an insightful journey into the past. Make sure you check out EMP in Seattle as well. Sleepy
B0014DZ2VO|2.0|I've never been much of a Bond fan.....I used to watch the films on TV when I was a kid, and I was entertained by them, but I could take them or leave them. In fact, CASINO ROYALE was the first Bond film I ever cared enough to see theatrically, and I was blown away. Here, finally, was a more realistic Bond, with nary a death-ray or invisibility watch in sight. The last reel of CASINO ROYALE left me on the edge of my seat, with a cliffhanger that promised 007 unleashing himself on the mysterious organization he uncovered at the end of the film.......     And now, finally, we have QUANTUM OF SOLACE, which, if CASINO ROYALE hooked me, has pretty much thrown me back in the water and made me feel like my love of Bond may be a one-time fluke. The film starts right where CASINO ROYALE left off, with 007 interrogating his prisoner about QUANTUM. The stakes of the game are instantly raised, as Bond and M (Judi Dench) realize that there is, almost literally, no one beyond suspicion.     So far, so good, right? Well, after a very promising beginning, QUANTUM OF SOLACE falls right back into the trap of Bond running around the world chasing the uber-villain (Mathieu Amalric, toadlike as a Roman Polanski-esque lunatic with a plan right out of old-school Roger Moore Bond films.), and getting into dangerous scrapes. The problem I had with all of this is, the film goes nowhere, plot-wise. By the end of the film, we know no more about QUANTUM and their plans and their goals than we did at the beginning of the film. I enjoyed seeing Judi Dench, Jeffrey Wright, and Giancarlo Giannini return, and Gemma Arterton was a bright spot as the aptly-named Strawberry Fields, but one of my main problems was the characterization of Bond himself: I really have almost no recollection of Daniel Craig speaking in this movie. Don't get me wrong, he does have dialogue, but the Writers of QUANTUM portray Bond as a silent, angry, murderous lunatic, and the film becomes such a morbid, joyless affair thatit was really tough to enjoy. The fight and chase scenes are filmed in \\"Shake-O-vision\\", making large portions of the action scenes totally incomprehensible, and the finale, in a massive hotel powered by highly explosive Hydrogen fuel cells (In every ROOM, no less!!!), was just ridiculous.      QUANTUM OF SOLACE wasn't a terrible movie, but it wasn't an especially good one, either. I hope the Bond franchise can get back up to the standard of CASINO ROYALE with Craig's third installment, and finally give the audience some answers.......
B000A3XYZA|5.0|King Bertarido is missing and believed to be dead--a fine monument has been erected in his memory.  Grimoaldo, a villain with scruples, has usurped the throne by promising to marry the king's sister Eduige and then dumping her to pursue the luscious royal widow Rodelinda.  The opera opens with Rodelinda bewailing her fate and spurning Grimoaldo, who is encouraged in his nefarious pursuit by the plotting Garibaldo--the real architect of the king's downfall. The next scene shift to the monument, where a weary Bertarido has returned and pauses to reflect that the loss of his throne is nothing beside the loss of his wife and son. There he encounters his loyal friend Unulfo who gives him the news. The plot proceeds in convolutions thereafter, but Rodelinda remains faithful to her spouse and ultimately he regains both his love and his throne.<br /><br />This production dating from the Glyndebourne Festival of June 1998 is blessed with the conducting services of William Christie.  The title role of the faithful Rodelinda is sung in stellar fashion by Anna Caterina Antonacci, a lovely singer who lights a dark stage with her radiant performance, particularly in the notable aria of Act II.  Although it is hard to top her performance, Andreas Scholl does so as the noble king Bertarido.  The sound of both singers and period orchestra is flawless.<br /><br />The staging is daringly set in the glamorous era of the silent movies and the color palate of the costumes is a mute monochrome of black, white, cream, beige and almost lavender. The sets are soot and sepia tones and the lighting can be downright murky at times.  There's no doubt in my mind that the elegant costumes for the royal ladies Rodelinda and Eduige are a smashing success.  They drip with pearls and ooze glamor and leave nothing to be desired.<br /><br />I hate to say this of this otherwise fabulous production, but the costumes and makeup for the men make for a very austere visual spectacle when only the guys are on stage. Their costumes are either white uniforms or dark coats, the pancake makeup makes everyone look dead and the only touch of color comes from the vivid red lipstick.  I suspect that this idea worked great on a live stage, and less well for the filmed production.  This DVD captures an actual performance.  We enjoy intermissions between acts with the audience as they savor Andreas Scholl's Glyndebourne debut.  His magnetic stage presence lends color to this memorable effort. Pure gold!

B000H6SXLU|5.0|As others have noted, the negative criticism of this excellent film is both uninformed and off-point.  Randolph Scott is \\"wooden\\" because he's playing a former football player, contrasting with the irrepressible vitality of Astaire & Rogers, and the awesome talents of Irene Dunne, which must have taken some effort for Scott, who could be quite unreserved off-camera.  It's also a film full of interesting historical perspectives, from emigre Russian aristocrats in Paris, to Astaire's aspersions against the outfits he's supposed to be selling in the fashion show, itself a staple of films of that time and after, e.g., \\"The Women\\" and \\"How To Marry A Millionaire.\\"  Yes, the dancing doesn't occupy quite as much time as it does in other Astaire-Rogers films, but with Dunne and Scott on the set, who cares?  And then there's Jerome Kern's music, which should make any discerning mind wonder exactly what happened to American theatrical composition and popular song between his era and the present.  But that's the stuff of a documentary, not the engagingly pure, multifaceted entertainment that \\"Roberta\\" offers.  More than two thumbs up:  this one gets a double high-five!
0385339100|5.0|This great plot starts with a bang in the first chapter and does not let it go until the last word of the last one. As you approach the ending chapters the thing gets better and loose ends dragged along get revealed. It has great twists and turns masterly crafted to fit with the beginning of the story. Entertaining, gripping, intelligent and featuring a deep sense of humor it qualifies as a superb thriller, worthy to be included among the best I have ever read. It features no boring chapter. Great Job Mr Grisham I liked it better than all of your other works
B000MVQIEO|5.0|If you loved the show... you will love the DVD's - I wish there were more extra's but I buy very few TV show DVD's and I am glad I have this collection.
0060512806|5.0|I am 54 years old and I am a nerd. (Sounds like an AA confession or something).      You may think Important People like George Bush or Bill Clinton or President-elect (at time of writing) Obama, or A. Lincoln, or Alexander or Ghengis Khan or Hitler or Nimitz or FDR or Churchill are the kind of guys who make the world go `round.  Or try to stop it, as the case may be.    You'd be dead wrong.    An interesting thing happened in the 19th century called the Industrial Revolution.  After 20,000-some-odd years of digging in the dirt the planet suddenly went high-tech. Or at least higher-tech.  The IPs were shocked, SHOCKED, to find they couldn't win a war (or do much else) without tech.  And where did they get their tech?    From us autistic, socially-inept, outta-the-box-thinking, harmless-appearing nerds. Stephenson gets this right, oh-so-dead-on-right, in \\"Cryptonomicon\\".      I almost never buy hardbacks any more except in extraordinary circumstances.  Fellow serious bookworms will know why immediately - space.  If the total volume in one's abode can be expressed as X, and the volume taken up in said abode by hardback books is .99999X, it becomes obvious that...well, you get the picture.  (Omigawd, an equation - means 10% fewer people will read this review).  Sooner or later paperbacks start looking like the way to go.    When I saw the big Avon hardback edition in 1999 and took a quick look, it seemed like a possibility.  But what iced the deal was the inside jacket picture of a young (maybe 10 y.o.?) NTS curled up on the couch reading Epstein's \\"First Book of Codes and Ciphers\\", a book I still have on my own shelf.  Now THIS was my kinda author!    Since then, I've read \\"Cryptonomicon\\" every few years and never failed to pull something new out of it.  This time it was an even better  appreciation of the very digressions many of the reviewers here have taken exception to. They are brilliant little jewels in their own right. To those who fizzed through the book the first time and missed them, or even skipped `em deliberately (arrrrgh!), I say, \\"Read it again and slow down.  Smell the coffee!\\"    The pages leading up to and including Lawrence Waterhouse's Big Insight at the organ keyboard are among the most hilarious I've ever read. Could only have come straight from a true nerd's heart.    About the ending.  Sometimes in real life, things don't get tied up with a then-everyone-lives-happily-ever-after ribbon, or a can-you-top-this bow.  Sometimes the villain wins or the hero loses, or they both win, or they both lose.  The codebreaker heroes of WWII got medals and citations they couldn't publicly acknowledge for over thirty years. Many of them worked their butts off on projects the results of which they didn't even see until such information began trickling out in the early 1970s.    Many of these ops would have seemed totally absurd from the point of view of the heavily-compartmented participants.  Stephenson's genius is his presentation of clandestine activities from the POVs of Bobby Shaftoe, who knows nothing, and Waterhouse, who knows everything.     After the 900-page tour-de-force NTS rolls out, about the only other ending I can envision is what I call the \\"up-yers ending\\", something like this:     \\"The Earth encounters a random black hole and falls into it. All life is squished into oblivion (including the characters you've read about for the past week) and the world ceases to exist.  Thank you for buying this book.\\"    THAT would've ticked off the reviewers even more.    My background includes writing ICBM flight software and service as a U.S. Navy Intelligence officer. I've read 1000s of books of all types, had three of my own published.  I've never given max stars to a book before in my life.  This one gets max stars. Six out of five, in fact. Stephenson wrote a book about us and he got it right.    Nerds rule.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|This movie is incredible! The story is so touching and the actors all did an amazing job. It was filmed in I believe it is 18 different locations which really makes the cinematography astounding; there are so many vivid colors and amazing architecture. Plus, the soundtrack is beautiful. You will not be disappointed in this movie.
B0014NDXGA|1.0|I just recieved my Tour V2 rangefinder and was extremely eager to use it.The product came just in time for a golf outing at a local resort that I had not played before. Out of the box the middle numbers of the display did not illuminate. Now I have to take the time to send it back to Bushnell - $20 dollars in postage, there and back - not to mention how long it will take to come back. Where is the quality control? I should have bought the Nikon...
B001DTPZNY|1.0|This was a bootleggedvideo made in China. I was very disappointed in this purchase. It did not come with a receipt from who sent it so I could not sent it back or I would have. I did not intend to buy and illegal copy of the movie.
0553801503|5.0|Maybe the best story I've ever read.  Epic in span.  The books look intimidating in size, but they read fast.  There are no good guys and bad guys, just characters with their own motivations.  At the end of the first book, I had my favorite character and my most hated characters(two brothers); at the end of the third book the brothers were my favorite characters.  The character development in this story is second to none.  This series of books would appeal to non science-fiction fans.  I can't recommend it enough.  The only thing that scares me is that there are at least 2, probably 3, more books to come, and the author is gray-haired and over weight.  I pray this series is completed.
B001F7MSFW|5.0|- A bystander on the street: \\"Hey, you're Hellboy!\\"<br />- Hellboy, strolling past: \\"I know! I'm ugly.\\"<br /><br />I really liked this sequel, even though it kind of strayed away from the much darker tone creator Mike Mignola had infused into his Hellboy comics (the first movie was more on par with Mignola's vision). But, if you're down with visually dazzling feasts and with Hellboy and Abe Sapien gettting their drink on and serenading each other with a Barry Manilow lament, then you won't find much to nag about in HELLBOY 2: THE GOLDEN ARMY. If you've seen and been entranced with [[ASIN:B00005JPA6 Pan's Labyrinth (New Line Two-Disc Platinum Series)]], then this is more of director Guillermo del Toro unleashing his vivid, vivid imagination.<br /><br />A set-up: Lost ages ago, mankind went to war against the supernatural kinds. In desperation, an army of golden mechanical warriors, numbering 70 by 70, was created for the elven king, and a magical crown to control this army. But such devastation was wrought by this invincible army that the king felt regret and enabled a cessation of hostilities between man and the faerie folk. In good faith, the crown was broken into three pieces, one piece given to man for safekeeping - and, so, the golden army fell dormant. But Prince Nuada, fierce son of the elven king, rebuked the peace and vanished in a self-imposed exile, vowing to return in his people' direst need.<br /><br />Well, dude's back. This time, he's bent on re-establishing the dominion of faerie kind. And he'll achieve this by wresting control of the indestructible golden army from the aged king, who now dwells in the sewers of New York. And, so, as Nuada begins to gather the pieces of the crown, all that stands between him and the cowing of man is his elegant twin sister, the Princess Nuala. And the Bureau for Paranormal Research & Defense. And, of course, the demonic hero Hellboy.<br /><br />What struck me the most is the ridiculous inventiveness of the movie. This is a beautiful and strange motion picture, and I found myself constantly rewinding the dvd for a second gander at some thing fleetingly shown on screen. From the swarm of nasty tooth fairies to the colossal forest elemental, from the busy Troll Market under the Brooklyn Bridge to the fearsome Angel of Death. The visuals are lush and lavish and bizarre stuff, classic fantasy tropes crossed with steampunk sensibilities and clashing with scenes in urban New York City. Tim Burton might've creamed his trousers.<br /><br />The cast has got game. Ron Perlman as Hellboy stabilizes the film with his solidity, as an actor and as a physical presence. Doug Jones returns as the immensely likable psychic fishman Abe Sapien, and how good is he that he even manages to be expressive solely thru the use of hand movements? This time, Doug himself, and not David Hyde Pierce, utters Abe's dialogue and does very well. Perlman and Jones chugging beer and singing that duet may well be my favorite moment in the film. Hellboy's love of the limelight lands him in hot waters with Washington, which promtply sends the by-the-book Prussian, Johann Krauss, to B.P.R.D. to be Hellboy's minder. Krauss happens to be an ectoplasmic entity housed in a robotic body. And he happens to be brilliantly voiced by Seth MacFarlane. We have a great villain in Prince Nuada, all credit to Luke Goss's performance. Goss lends his character a hefty measure of pathos and torn nobility. And, apparently, even the fey know wushu. You may root for Hellboy, but you end up kind of feeling for Nuada, who feels the inexorable passing of his race. And, so, he rages against it. But, I guess, wouldn't you?<br /><br />Mention's already been made, and aptly so, to how certain scenes in HELLBOY II evoke moods originally set in the classic Star Wars' canteen ([[ASIN:B000FQJAIW Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope (1977 & 2004 Versions, 2-Disc Widescreen Edition)]]) and in [[ASIN:B0000640SB Men in Black (Deluxe Edition)]]. I wasn't that bothered, because those quick-hitting sight gags are very cool. However, these similarities are so marked that I couldn't help but be lifted straight out of the story (thinking: \\"Hey, like in Tattoine!\\" or \\"Hey, that's kinda like M.I.B!). They also, tonally, take away from Hellboy's darker mythology. HELLBOY II does come with plenty of humor, and, thankfully, most of it fits well within the confines of the story.<br /><br />This is the 3-Disc Special Edition, and it's steeped in sweeeet special features goodness. Disc 1 offers the widescreen feature presentation and the following bonus material: 2 audio commentaries, one by Director Gillermo del Toro (informative), the other (which is more staid and flounders at times) by actors Selma Blair, Jeffrey Tambor, and Luke Goss; Set Visits: behind-the-scenes stuff on seven scenes (\\"The Chamberlain,\\" \\"Wink Vs. Abe,\\" \\"Hellboy Vs. Wink,\\" \\"The Elemental Egg,\\" \\"Big Baby,\\" \\"'H' Is For Hotel,\\" & \\"Disintegrating Loyalty\\"); Troll Market Tour with del Toro playing tour guide; the 5-minute \\"Zinco Epilogue\\" animated comic (in which the tale of a forgotten foe is told and man's allegiance to the dark arts is revealed); and 6 deleted scenes (with optional director's commentary).<br /><br />The highlight of Disc 2 is \\"Hellboy: In Service of the Demon,\\" a 19 chapter extravaganza which delves comprehensively into many aspects of the movie, from del Toro conducting pre-production meetings with his brain trust about his vision of the movie to the stunt work to behind-the-scenes looks at showcased creatures like the tooth fairies, Mr. Wink, Johann Krauss, etc. \\"Hellboy: In Service of the Demon\\" runs at over 2 and a half hours. There are several more technical segments which digs even deeper into the film-making process: the Production Workshop (3 minutes long) features the film's puppet animation segment near the start, but in three aspects shown simultaneously on screen: del Toro's thumbnail sketches, Mignola's storyboard, and the finished sequence (with optional director's commentary); the Pre-Production Vault includes the Director's Notebook (selected excerpts, hard to read with its tiny script and sometimes in Spanish, and with occasional video pods) and the movie gallery (which includes a slideshow with audio commentary by Mike Mignola). The Marketing Campaign segment features a busload of Hellboy II posters. And there's a DVD-ROM function which gives you access to a printable version of the film script.<br /><br />And Disc 3 is the digital copy.<br /><br />Hellboy is an irresistible character. Prophesy warns that Hellboy someday will usher in the end of the world. Yet Hellboy every day turns his back on his demonic destiny and struggles to do right and be accepted by humanity. It's why I follow Mike Mignola's stories and watch the movies. I really like that Hellboy here is settled enough that he's living out his own version of combative domestic bliss with his fire-wielding lady love, Liz. Of course, during a dust-up with the tooth fairies, Abe senses something unexpected about Liz which throws a spanner into her and Hellboy's relationship. But never mind. Either Hellboy and Liz will work it out (or they won't). This sequel runs on a larger scale. It boasts wicked action, spectacular special effects and set designs, memorable creatures, and solid acting. It offers bits of lightheartedness and moments of tragedy, arcane gizmos and knick-knacks, and two love stories. Once again, Guillermo del Toro shows his creativity and affinity for fantasy.

B0014I4KIK|5.0|Although many of you are already familiar with some of Duffy's songs (such as the brilliant Warwick Avenue and the already classic Mercy), listening to the record in full is a phenomenal musical experience. her distinguished bitter-sweet voice touches your soul in every song of this album, and after many hours of listening you rediscover some really fantastic yet unfamiliar (for now) songs such as Rockferry and Hanging On Too Long. highly recommended!
0064430227|5.0|A classic after many years, and deservedly so.  Harold creates an adventure--plot, setting, and characters--armed with nothing but the purple crayon with which he draws it, page after page.  Simple and enchanting, Harold and the Purple Crayon will be among the most requested in your child's library.    My three-year-old daughter is the third generation in our family to have enjoyed this imaginative book.
0670020745|5.0|A very valuable book, not only for those who have suffered a stroke, but for those whose loved ones have.  My husband suffered a massive stroke in 2002, several TAI's, and 2006 diagnosed with Alzheimer's.  The book shows how small steps are the so important and not overwhelming for the person.  Above all treating the patient and loved one with DIGNITY! Take charge of and be involved every step of the way.
B001GH63IE|3.0|Michael Cretu's seventh album is a smoother mix of sounds and less eclectic than previous albums. It retains a chilled euro-pop feel and I've had to listen to it several times to develop some favourite tunes because nothing struck me immediately.<br /><br />There's the familiar musical and vocal introductory track and some songs have non-english-singing vocalists, like many previous Enigma albums. The Same Parents, La Puerta Del Cielo, and We Are Nature have an earthy, emotive and 'typical' Enigma feel to them.<br /><br />Seven Lives Many Faces is more subdued, less punchy than Cretu's previous offerings, yet with repeated listening it'll grow on you. The additional tracks are well-worth downloading.
1400063515|2.0|Do not use your valuable time reading through this entire book.  Taleb provides some solid theories with good support.  However, this book could have been condensed into about 50 pages and he could have conveyed his entire message.  Much of the book is stream of consciousness and it is difficult to see how what he is currently discussing ties to what he just discussed, and where the discussion will go next.  Additionally, many of his theories, while applicable in the constrained set of circumstances he presents, are not widely applicable.<br />Presentation of the Black Swan was a useful backdrop for other discussion in the book, but the Black Swan was really not what the majority of the book was about.  Instead, it branched off into other theories, not directly supporting the Black Swan theory, and in many cases, unrelated to other parts of the book.<br />While Taleb (clearly qualified in this area of empiricist discussion), at times, wrote in engaging prose, too many times he engaged in name-dropping and abstract theoretical presentation that distracted the reader (without an extensive knowledge of mathematical theorists).  It was difficult to determine an appropriate audience for this book.  Sometimes it seemed anecdotal, targeting the lay mathematician, while at other times it dove so deep as to only interest a Ph.D. in related topics.<br />Overall, it was a struggle to get through this book and while there was some scattered, solid discussion, I was able to take very little away that will be applicable.  Not an enjoyable or informative read.

0316042994|5.0|This is not THE FIVE LITTLE PEPPERS AND HOW THEY GREW, but it is close.  An outsider, Charles Ryder, (a near orphan), is befriended by a family, Lord and Lady Marchmain and their children, Bridey, Julia, Sebastian, and Cordelia.  Of particular importance to the progression of the story are Sebastian and Julia.      Published in the United States in 1945, the novel has enduring interest as witnessed by the television mini-series and the movie.  A contemporary reviewer noted that Waugh was writing at the top of his form, that the book was mature Waugh.  The description of the art noveau style decoration of the chapel at Brideshead Castle is priceless.      Waugh uses a bundle of qualities to typify the major characters.  That is to say, they stand for this and that, and may be visualised in such and such a way.  And, as in so much of Waugh, the reader is shown the characters in action, they speak at great length, exhaustively.  There are embedded  first-person narratives, that of Charles Ryder in the outer ring, addressing the reader, and Anthony Blanche speaking to Charles at length, for example.      The reader need not be concerned that there is nothing funny in the volume under review, because there is.  The portrait of Charles Ryder's father endeavoring to diversify Charles's evenings at home during the vacation is one of many instances of merriment.  When Charles spends part of the same vacation with Sebastian Flyte, the author describes youth as langorous, generous.      Unfortunately the golden days of Charles and Sebastian don't last.  Sebastian is sent down from Oxford and Charles goes to seek preparation for his career in the visual arts.  When Charles is dismissed from Brideshead by Sebastian's mother he feels that he is entering reality.  Charles leaves with an understanding the banishment is to last forever.    When his mother, Lady Marchmain, is dying, Charles sets out for Morocco in search of Sebastian.  Sebastian is withered by drink. Charles arrangesfor Sebastian's brother Bridey to give him an allowance.  Charles receives a commission to paint the house at Brideshead, his first.      Both Sebastian and Julia return to the practice of religion, Catholicism.  The return has many consequences to their own lives and the life of Charles.      The book is both witty and good.
B000X1Z0BU|4.0|In our cynical age, it somehow seems especially creative, even courageous, to make a film that is not about corruption, ennui, ulterior motives, dysfunctional social structures, or tragic flaws.  Once is a film that is refreshing in its earnestness and in its respect for the things that add meaning and beauty to our lives.    I'm not a musician, but I once aspired to be one.  And if I have one pet peeve about film generally, it's how film often disrespects music.  It's often treated as a subordinate art, mixed in to add a little punch to the main event, the dramatic narrative.  So many films use music carelessly.    Not this film.  This is a film whose central focus is the way that music forges bonds between people; how music enables us to express our feelings, and not only to better understand but to care about others; and how music is sometimes the most beautiful thing available to grab hold of.    This film reminded me of a conversation I once had with a friend, in which we concluded that for almost every person's romantic moments, music is somehow involved. Maybe it's a song you've danced to together, or heard together during a special sharing moment.  Maybe it's simply music that you listened to privately to work through intense feelings.  All in all, I'd wager that few of us have ever fallen in love without music being a big part of the picture.    This film is essentially a musical - but it's not like any other musical I've seen.  It's not a film that asks you to shift back and forth between plausible dramatic action and wholly implausible musical production numbers.  Instead, in this film, the music is central to the action; the characters are making music together, and every piece of music performed in the film is in a context where you fully believe those characters might make music together in that way.  I can't think of another film where the music seemed to matter so much to the characters.    We are so conditioned in our culture to indulge our societalADD at the expense of respecting music and its uplifting power.  Thus, when I first watched this film, I was initially feeling like, \\"OK, enough of this song, time to cut to something else,\\" - as if sitting through an entire piece of music was more than a film could ask of me.  But unless a film does this, it can never fully convey the sense of the joy of making music, and how it brings you closer to other people.  The film shows people experiencing this in all its fullness, a special, deeply human experience worth celebrating.    In a lesser film, the film's studio scene would involve some kind of subplot during the performance - furtive glances, repressed conflicts, other dramatic elements - it's all too easy to imagine.  Here the only focus of the scene is the shared satisfaction of making the music itself.  Similarly, a dinner party depicted in the film is significant chiefly for the music that people share during it.    The film is shot in a very natural, unobtrusive style; you often feel as though you are just a fly on the wall, whether it's in a repair shop or an apartment.    OK, a small confession: the music in this film isn't really my cup of tea.  It's more repetitive than I would like, especially so in the lyrics.  And I have an issue with music that is too persistently emotive.  I can deal with a song building to a pitch of emotionalism, but the songs in this film tried to sustain that high pitch more than is my personal taste.  But I say this not to criticize the film; it's simply to say that you can enjoy and respect this film even if this isn't your favorite musical genre. And, I must say, there is no denying that the protagonists do produce some harmonies that are genuinely, hauntingly lovely.  Favorite genre or no, there is some truly beautiful music here.    Another thing I appreciated about this film is that it felt no need to create contrived situations, black hats, or exaggerated conflicts.  The characters are real people, dealing with plausible issues - heartbreak, loneliness, parental responsibility, regret, money problems, frustrated hopes - which the film doesn't overplay.  It just shows men and women using music to work out the feelings that arise in their lives.  And, it should be said, the music enables the viewer to feel some of the emotion, too.  I saw some moist eyes at film's end.    I'm uncertain how much to recommend this film to my friends; it's certainly not Citizen Kane.  I am afraid that one of them would put it in the DVD player, decide the music was too plaintive, and start rolling their eyes.  For me, though, it all pulsed with sincerity, and I appreciated that feeling.    Music is one of the most precious enrichments of the human experience. This film respects that, and honors it.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|Now, I'm not a huge fan of the original films, but I always found them enjoyable.  They're kind of comfort movies.  Great fun with some witty dialog and believable action.  So, when this newest installment hit the theaters, I didn't rush out to go see it. I knew I'd get around to it eventually.  And thank goodness I skipped the theaters because this film is a verifiable mess from beginning to end.<br /><br />From the laughable opening sequence I knew we were in trouble.  Things only got worse from there with the introduction of \\"Mutt\\" who was essentially put into a Brando costume (what were they thinking?) and is given the most annoying dialog ever. The we meet Cate Blanchett's  character. Now Blanchett is one of the best actresses around, but she obviously watched way too much Rocky & Bullwinkle as prep for this movie.  She is so very much Natasha that I expected John Astin to come around the corner any minute as Boris.  Over the top doesn't even describe her performance.<br /><br />But what killed this for me the most was the absolutely insipid action sequences.  While the other films always stretched the believability factor with the action, it always remained fun and somewhat rooted in reality.  Here, it is all so unbelievable (falling over three waterfalls and no one is hurt?) and done so badly it ruins not only the film but the series.  I wish someone would tell George Lucas that CGI is not he answer to everything and I certainly wished he hadn't convinced Spielberg that it was.  He made a mess of the Star Wars films and now he got his computer generated claws into Indy.  The CGI and green screen is shockingly bad in this film and ILM  (if they are the ones who committed this atrocity) should be shamed of themselves.<br /><br />It was nice to see Karen Allen again, but like everything else in this movie she is so far over the top it is laughable.<br /><br />It is said that Sean Connery refused to reprise his role in this film and I absolutely understand why.  And to show the height of laziness behind this picture, the writer and director weren't even smart enough to take out a line of dialog which clearly referenced Connery.  \\"You brought a knife to a gunfight.\\"  Yeah, they'll say it was an homage, but it was just plain sloppy, like tis whole movie.<br /><br />In the end, Indy should have hung up his fedora with movie #3 and left us with a good taste in our mouths rather than the bitter aftertaste of this horrible film.ss behind this picture, the writer and director weren't even smart enough to take out a line of dialog which clearly referenced Connery.  \\"You brought a knife to a gunfight.\\"  Yeah, they'll say it was an homage, but it was just plain sloppy, like tis whole movie.

B000FFJYCU|5.0|This is re-release of the Movie Grand Prix with remastered audio.  The movie is completely true to the original (including having an intermission and disk change) and the 5.1 audio is outstanding, you should really have your system hooked to a sound system to get the benefit  of the music, sound effects and ambience.  The movie places you in the drivers cockpit of a \\"Formula 1\\" grand prix racer. What you see on the screen is exactly what the driver is seeing and doing.  The actors  were  sent to Bob Boundrant High Performance driving school and they are really driving the race cars.  This is the movie that got me convinced  to get my SCCA regional license and start racing for real.  It shows it like it actually is.
B00011V8CW|5.0|This is one of my favorite Bowie efforts, a much more engaging effort than most of his 80s and 90s works. Each fan looks for something different from Bowie than he actually delivers. Fans are divided on his albums as much as Beck's fans. You can see the varying opinions in the wildly different reviews. If you liked Modern Love or Young Americans you will most likely enjoy this as well. There are other efforts from this time period that although typically well produced are not as memorable.

159102594X|5.0|I picked up this book and found it hard to put down.  It seems that Joe Abercrombie is good at making fight scenes in a book real in the mind.  Some of the characters are ruthless and some are kind-hearted, but all are fascinating.  Even the baddies don't seem so bad when we hear their thoughts and see what they've gone through, but we still want them to go down (but at least maybe take one or two people with them).  The book is fun and I would recommend it to anyone.  I didn't buy it, but rather have checked it out from my local library due to the fact that I'm too poor right now to buy books :).

031606792X|1.0|Over the summer, I was unfortunately afflicted with 'Twilight fever'. Wanting to check out the series, I bought the first three books as well as reserved Breaking Dawn on Amazon.  Huge mistake.  For all the hype it receives, Meyer's writing is substandard, probably due to her doing absolutely no research into vampire lore and mythology (besides fleeting descriptions of the Stregoni benefici, incubus and succubus), her characters are stereotypical and insanely selfish, and her attempt to portray Bella as a heroine is a fiasco. Breaking Dawn was one of the worst examples of this, which is why I give it no stars.  I have a huge problem with the portrayal of Bella in both BD and the series as a whole. To be frank, Meyer wants to make her like a butt-kicking heroine, but fails dismally-instead crafting an extremely selfish, whiny, and needy character who hides behind Edward and the vamps while they do all the work. She suffers from self esteem issues-what is this showing the impressionable chumps who absorb this series like Gospel, to hate themselves? Her character is never fully developed, so we never really connect with Bella, and trust me, she doesn't really endear herself to anyone. In BD, everything is handed to her without any conflicts or struggles-Renesmee, limitless sex with Edward, a new life as a vampire, which furthers the perception that Bella is very very SELFISH. All she wants is Edward, and she's willing to do anything and stomp on anyone to get a bit of him. Renesmee ends up factoring into this too. Jacob is an example of a victim of Bella.  Worse, I think Edward is highly romanticized. He is a abusive and dominant. Ok, so he doesn't hit Bella, but he takes apart her car and forces her to keep away from friends and family!  BD came across as too happy, too superficial, and forced, like a fake smile. Bella won everything with no struggle and no conflict, just a bit of talking. The battle was seriously LAME. After at least a hundred pages of suspense before the visit of the Volturi, NOTHING HAPPENED. And it leaves the reader wondering: \\"what's the point?\\"   So in this review I officially deem BD as unworthy of being the series finale. In fact, this series is unworthy of all the attention and praise it gets. So let's all just forget about it, ignore the crappy movie about it and go on with our lives. [ps: i'm not anthony it's meh dad]
B00006AUIG|5.0|Creepy, well written, wonderfully acted and intense. This is the one thing (book, music, film, etc.) that EVERYONE enjoys when I recommend it.

LOVE this movie.
B0014DZ2VO|4.0|Ian Fleming's original James Bond owed more to Hugh Hefner than to the civil servants that Bond supposedly represented. Sean Connery did a great job portraying that womanizing, witty, high-living secret agent. Times change, though, and Daniel Craig is the agent of that change, even if not quite the romanticized agent of Fleming's original stories. The new bond is tougher, grittier, and a lot more believable. And, like the hero of this movie, the stakes of the game get a twenty-first century makeover too. The wealth isn't isn't gold, diamonds or nuclear weaponry - but you'll see that for yourself. Even the cinematography has a more modern look, especially that jaggedness that amplifies the hard edge of the fight scenes.<br /><br />It's a Bond movie, though, and a good one. It has all the action of Craig's previous work in this role, for one thing. Then there are the gorgeous and sometimes lethal Bond Babes. That includes Camille Montes who (like Tilly Masterson in \\"Goldfinger\\") has a score of her own to settle. And, as we've come to expect, there's an explosive finale.<br /><br />If you hoped for the debonair, droll Bond of the 1960s and 70s, well, this isn't him. Instead, as with any good myth, the Bond story stays fresh by changing with new tellings. The old Bond was good, but the new one is good too.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

0316035904|3.0|David Sedaris is a witty author who writes essays that can be simultaneously humorous and disturbing.<br />This collection of stories confirms this impression, and they are loosely autobiographical, and sometimes veer into the purely fictitious. \\"Santaland Diaries\\" falls in the first category as the humble author writes \\"I am a thirty-three-year-old man applying for a job as an elf.\\" He writes about the dark side of a full time elf job, selecting his elf name of \\"Crumpet\\", donning a green velvet elf suit, and seeing things in Santaland that no living person would ever care to see.<br />An elf with a handle bar mustache hitting on the moms, a child peeing on fake snow. Dark, yes.<br />In \\"Let It Snow\\", he writes of being locked out of his house with his siblings on the fifth day of a snowstorm, as his mom suffered a \\"little nervous breakdown\\" and enjoyed drinking wine while the children desperately clammered to get in the house, eventually faking a death to get inside.<br />\\"Season's Greetings\\" is a family holiday season newsletter, which starts with desperate circumstances and goes on methodically listing a crescendo of catastrophes; the perfect antidote to those sweet bragging holiday letters we all have received, and maybe, even written.<br />Mr. Sedaris either works for you or not. You get to choose.
B000TEUSJK|2.0|I finally broke down and bought the movie. It does have some decent sex scenes, it's just very choppy. I am not sure if they were trying to show how crazy stuff was back then or the movie makers were just unexperience. If you heard of this movie and just wanted to see it for all it's hype and still don't know. Try to find someone who has it this way you can watch it and save your money.
B000URDE2Y|5.0|Robin Trower is a man who really understood music. Formally in Procol Harum which was known for its classical influences, and its helping hand in establishing what would be known as progressive rock. After joining a short lived super group (Jude), Trower finally released a solo album \\"Twice Removed From Yesterday\\" in 1973. Now we advance a year further and \\"Bridge of Sighs\\" is finally released.<br /><br />Bridge of Sighs opens with \\"Day of The Eagle\\", a track that's fiery and definitely Hendrix influenced. While similar guitar wise with the bluesy funky chords, one can notice strong vocal differences. The actual track \\"Bridge of Sighs\\" opens with a jingly sound leading to a warm euphoric guitar. So calming and memorable of a track. \\"In This Place\\" is just as dreamy, but with more complex guitar. Bits of the vocal melody remind me of Black Sabbath's \\"Planet Caravan\\" from their 1970 hit album \\"Paranoid\\".<br /><br />The album swings back into gear with the rocking \\"The Fool and Me\\". \\"Too Rolling Stoned\\" just grooves from the dry drum and tight single coil strat sounding intro, to the later wah licks. The song is long and fairly progressive. I swear I hear ambient voices in the last minute of the song, could never really decipher it. The guitar tone is just astounding, and how the bends and vibratos sound, this album really speaks.<br /><br />Robin Trower-Bridge of Sighs, a must buy. Bluesy and rocking, an album with strong variety. Slow progressing tunes and rocking gems, an album that can't be forgotten once herd.

I don't know what has changed - you used to actually be able to tell the specifics about DVDs before you buy them.    The movie itself is fun. I enjoyed it a lot.  I am not a fan of 3D and it gave me a headache watching it with the glasses (as I said, I only bought this version to get the digital copy too...).  It is escapist fare that is good family fun without being bland.

I just mailed it to her, so I have not heard her opinion about the album.     From the album cover photo to the music on the CD, Booker T & the MGs do a great job paying homage to the Beatles and their album \\"Abbey Road.\\" I would have loved hearing Booker T & the MGs do a similar project based on the Beatles \\"SGT Peppers' Lonely Heart Club Band\\".    This CD and all of their other releases are proof that there was (and is) more to Booker T & the MGs than just \\"Green Onions.\\"

0743298039|5.0|Wonderful book.  Definitely one of the best I've read in a while.    It's the story of two women.  Vida Winters - the most beloved living novelist in the British Isles, now 80 years old.  And Margaret Lea - a 30ish, introverted antiquarian bookseller and amateur biographer.    Vida Winters past has always been a mystery, fuelled by the hundreds of `fake' life histories that she has fed to various reporters and curiosity seekers.  But now she is dying and she wants Margaret to listen to her tale and write her biography.    At first Margaret wants nothing to do with the project as everything Mrs. Winters has told in the past has been a lie.  But slowly she is drawn in (as is the reader) to the story.  A tale of wealth & poverty, birth & decay, family & familial indifference, love & loss & twins all set around a dreary and moldering English mansion.  As Mrs. Winters story unfolds, so does Margaret's own.  The two women are not as dissimilar, as they first appear.    Although beautifully written, this isn't a fast paced novel.  It is dark in both setting and story.  Think of the cold moors & of Wuthering Heights, the cruelty in the early part of Jane Eyre.  It took me a while to get into the story, but by halfway through I was not only hooked, I couldn't put it down.    But what truly made it wonderful was the ending.  The stage was set perfectly for the big reveal on Vida Winters.  All the clues were in line.  I should have seen it coming and yet I didn't.  It is not the stereotypical ending to a book.  The author did a masterful job, and I love being surprised like that.      And then I spent the rest of the book crying as everything came into focus.  I'd highly recommend the experience.

B000QXDED6|1.0|I went to this movie with few expectations. From the previews, I expected no more than a random, brutal, and stylized action flick, but it still didn't impress. The movie replaced half of the would-be action and violence with a steriotypical story about a soldier giving his life for his family. The movie shoulv'e at least mellowed out the overly-dramatic and soap-opera like emotional dialogue, because it didn't work out very well with the overall presentation of the film. As far as the stylized action goes, the computer-generated blood looks cool as swords impact flesh, but every drop of blood dissapears before it reaches the edge of the screen .Noone wasnts to see an awesome blood spurt fly through the air, and then quickly fade into nothing. This was just downright lame. All of the soldiers would come out of battle clean and blood-spatter free. This is in no way nearly as good as Sin City. Lastly, the movie doesn't feel either visceral nor intense, just clean and full of disapearing blood effects. The movie comes off as lame and cheesy. Rent it first.

B000009RC2|5.0|I first heard of the Mahavishnu Orchestra through reading about leader John McLaughlin's role in Miles Davis' masterpieces [[ASIN:B000002696 Bitches Brew]] and [[ASIN:B00074CBFG A Tribute to Jack Johnson]]. Whilst Miles Davis' three fusion masterpieces becomes successively harder, heavier and more intense, they do not prepare a listener for what McLaughlin was to achieve upon leaving Miles to form his own band, named the Mahavishnu Orchestra after his association with a Hindu guru.<br /><br />Despite its title, \\"The Inner Mounting Flame\\" is anything but devotional music. This is, in its essence, jazz made completely electric, with Jan Hammer's keyboards, Rick Laird's bass and the violin of Jerry Goodman providing the \\"waves of melody\\" that give hints to where such bands as [[ASIN:B0000019LR the Dirty Three]] would travel in the 1990s. This is apparent from the intense, yet tuneful opening track \\"Meeting of the Spirits\\" that established the classic Mahavishnu sound of distorted guitar and bass over melodic violin and keyboards and Bill Cobham's remarkably precise drumming. Even though electric, the Mahavishnu Orchestra's music is so free-flowing that any alert listener will recognise it as jazz rather than as rock.<br /><br />The following two tracks, though much faster and less emotional, have similar sorts of quiet-to-loud dynamics that would be perfected by Brian McMahan and Dave Pajo on [[ASIN:B0000019HU Spiderland]] two decades later. This is most apparent on \\"Noonward Race\\", where McLaughlin and Laird play their instruments in squalls that are too melodic to be noise, but too intense to be a melody even in the sense of an album like [[ASIN:B000002LRJ Loveless]]. The fourth track, \\"A Lotus on Irish Streams\\" is a true anomaly here, sounding more like [[ASIN:B00042YJJ2 Popol Vuh]] than most of the other songs here. Hammer's piano, though, makes the piece far from ordinary.<br /><br />The classic Miles Davis groove of \\"Vital Transformation\\" puts things back in their familiar place after the detour of the fourth track, and with Goodman's violin taking the place of Davis' trumpet, \\"Vital Transformation\\" sounds more like Miles than anything else on \\"The Inner Mounting Flame\\" - and has every quality that made Davis' first electric works so unique. \\"The Dance of Maya\\" is creepy and slower than anything else here, but it really will haunt the aware listener with the amazing accuracy of every player over the first two minutes and forty seconds. The rest of \\"The Dance of Maya\\" is lighter and faster - true jazz that moves so freely the players sound as if they are playing just because they enjoy it.<br /><br />The first half of \\"You Know, You Know\\" features McLaughlin on acoustic guitar, which he plays in a tense, brooding manner that leaves one imagining the music will become louder long before the fierce squalls of Goodman's violin disturb the calm (if only momentarily) in a way never duplicated by anyone. The closer, \\"Awakening\\", in contrast, is ferocious right from the very first notes and never lets up through its relatively short three minute and thirty-two second running time. The fierce passion of this piece summarises a record in which McLaughlin manages to perfect completely free-form electric music.<br /><br />It is because all five members play with such freedom that they are able to achieve an emotional level that never lets up even on the quietest moments in a manner impossible in structured songs where players have to restrain themselves to play the structures correctly. \\"The Inner Mounting Flame\\" is thus a landmark: one that would in the 1990s be copied without acknowledgement by post-rock groups but whose tremendous power needs to be heard firsthand.he detour of the fourth track, and with Goodman's violin taking the place of Davis' trumpet, \\"Vital Transformation\\" sounds more like Miles than anything else on \\"The Inner Mounting Flame\\" - and has every quality that made Davis' first electric works so unique. \\"The Dance of Maya\\" is creepy and slower than anything else here, but it really will haunt the aware listener with the amazing accuracy of every player over the first two minutes and forty seconds.

B0018LMZOO|4.0|This is my final review of a 2008 remastered \\"core 7\\" Moody Blues cd.  Seventh Sojourn follows in the tradition and downcast mood of the previous album Every Good Boy Deserves Favour from 1971.  However, on Seventh Sojourn, there was a light at the end of the tunnel.  The much needed break for the band was in sight.  I don't think any of them knew how long a rest they would need.  But, the melancholy of EGBDF was followed by a spiritual awakening of sorts for the band on SS.  It would become clear on the individual songs of Seventh Sojourn.  There is an optimism present, even though the sadness over the shape of the world ran deep.  On EGBDF, they were just so fatigued and had no time to be pensive.  They had no opportunity to think clearly.  On Seventh Sojourn, there is a lot of introspection and soul-searching in the songs.  I love this album, even though I will oftentimes favor listening to the more peppy AQOB or the last cd of studio wizardry in TOCCC.  I will end my last review of a \\"core 7\\" 2008 remaster with a list of my favorites.  They are the following:<br /><br />1. A Question of Balance<br />2. To Our Children's Children's Children<br />3. Days of Future Passed<br />4. In Search of the Lost Chord<br />5. Seventh Sojourn<br />6. Every Good Boy Deserves Favour<br />7. On The Threshold of a Dream<br /><br />Don't get me wrong!  I love all seven of the core albums in each of their own unique ways!  I think the list is determined more by how often I will listen to a cd, more than the degree to which I like it.  They all seven deserve their own merits and are all worthy.  I can't wait until the next round of remasters from Octave to Keys of the Kingdom are released.  They all six need to be remastered, each to a varying degree, but I look forward to reviewing them when the time comes!<br /><br />Sincerely, Rick Whiteley
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I normally don't write reviews, but for these headphones I'll make an exception. They are the ultimate. I have been using them basically non-stop for 12 months with a variety of music at a variety of volume- Jazz mostly but also metal, classical, j-pop, prog rock, you get the idea.<br /><br />I thought I would buy these exclusively for studio monitoring, but they work so g*ddam well that I use them to engineer albums too.<br /><br />They worked great right out of the box, but the icing on the cake is that they actually work /better/ over time. That is, the bass settles and sounds more like that which you would hear out of actual stereo studio monitors.<br /><br />I recommend them to everybody regardless of musicianship. They're less than $100 for goodness sake, and the durability leads me to believe they'll last for decades. If my pair breaks for some freak reason, then I'll have no qualms replacing them with an identical pair.
B0018PJEYY|5.0|A Question of Balance has always been my favorite Moody Blues album.  I love the \\"new\\" more live-sounding instrumentation.  Of course, with the 2008 remastered version, the instruments are more clear and bright as well.  One reviewer talked about straining to hear the bass on the new remaster of AQOB, but I must disagree.  I think the bass is quite apparent, and I don't even have the rhythm ax of my stereo turned on, which would increase the bass.  Another reviewer discussed the notion of distortion.  Well, I don't hear it.  One thing about the new remasters is that you don't need to have the volume cranked up nearly as much to enjoy the music.  Anyway, as I've already mentioned in other reviews of the 2008 remasters, they are far superior to any previous release or remaster of the \\"core 7\\" Moody Blues!
B00005JPS8|5.0|This was a great movie and the box that I got it in was in great condition!
0805023461|2.0|This product is too big!  Be sure you know this before you order it!
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|Great movie fun, very imaginative, but the Spartans were heavy infantry soldiers and did not go into battle bare chested.
B001EN71CW|5.0|considering the source(if it's not shot in HD,it will only be as good as the source)this is the best picture you will get for this show,if you have a good set up for Blueray.you will also get better sound than the DVD.as for the show,if you have seen it and do not love it i cannot help you...now about a Buffy Blueray....
