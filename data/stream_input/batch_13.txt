0440131480|1.0|Anyone who thinks 'Breakfast of Champions' is &quot;outright hilarious&quot; has a strange sense of humor. Not once was I even mildly amused. Was it the crude humor for shock value? The blatant attempts at  teaching us lessons about our messed up society? If you are desperate  enough to read this book, I recommend just looking at the pictures, that's  about as good as it gets.
B000002C2E|5.0|After more than a year I can only say that Time out of mind is getting better and better. It definately is the darkest and also best  CD he ever made.It's not exactly for the faint-hearted though. Lonelyness, despair and  lovesickness are some of the major themes on this album. The music is  perfect. Dylan's voice is raw and will give you a chill. Together with  Leonard Cohen's Songs of Love and Hate this is probably one of the best  albums ever.
B000002UEB|5.0|Simply the best album of all times, no heavy metal band has achieved so much as Queensryche has with this masterpiece, even if you are not a Metalhead, you HAVE to listen to this masterpiece, it is rich in every way,  lyrics, guitars, bass, drums, and, of course ...the incredible and potent  vocals of Geoff Tate. A must.
0792151712|5.0|Titanic is the best movie I have ever seen. There are a few drawbacks, however:<br />Rose spends way too much time running around looking for a key for the handcuffs. Cal Hockley was a total jerk...did he know he was  getting married to Rose's mother for money?? Rose's mother was drawn very  cliche. (&quot;Of course, we're women. Our choices are never easy.&quot;)  Molly Brown was too hearty-hearty. Some of the best parts were chopped  before the movie was even released. However...<br />This movie was the most  emotional movie I have ever seen. It is the best just to look at. The  costumes are fantastic. The hair is great. The visuals are wonderful. The  love story and music make you care about what's going on, draw you in to  the sinking as if you are there. <br />It's true that Leonardo DiCaprio's  acting isn't quite up to par, but you only notice that if you've seen the  movie more than three times.<br />This is the best movie of all time. One  might as well buy it, since everyone else has or will.<br />Titanic is my  favorite movie. It definitely deserved all the Oscar nominations and awards  it recieved. James Cameron should be very pleased with himself. Thank you,  Mr. Cameron, for giving us all this movie.
630512065X|5.0|This was just amazing. I absolutly loved the video. I fell in love with the costumes, music, set design, and lighting. If you like theatre you must see this video.
B00000G3PA|4.0|Armageddon is a great movie. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is because of all the non-fitting Aerosmith songs (like &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; during the underwater training sequences) that seemed to be  there just because Liv Tyler is in this movie.<br />Ben Affleck is great,  Bruce Willis is great, Billy Bob Thornton rocks, Liv Tyler is so-so.  <br />When Bruce Willis' character hits the button at the end of the movie,  you kind of sit there in wonder because you just didn't think he was that  type of guy. <br />Go ahead and say that this movie is patronizing to  non-Americans. It isn't...who else has the kind of technology shown in use  in the movie? Nobody.
6305226296|5.0|The video was outstanding and I loved it everybody should buy it its worth the price.
0792151712|1.0|Never before in the history of the world has there been such an overhyped, overblown epic as &quot;Titanic&quot;. Why did they have to center the film around a  drippy love story about two people who would never be together in  the first place? Leo DiCrapio was so wooden as the lead he left splinters.  Why did James Cameron pick someone who looks like an anorexic twelve year  old? Now this movie is sitting on my shelf and collecting dust. It will be  there for a long time, I can assure you.
0374172897|5.0|I heard about this book on National Public Radio.  I ordered it from amazon.com.<br />I read it in one night and plan to read it again...and again...and again.  I can't remember reading such vivid and moving prose.  Although the three stories weren't truly connected, I never had trouble  making the transitions.<br />I liked this book more than any other I've read  this year...and I read a lot!<br />The characters are real and alive and full  of human foibles.  They're rich and introspective and full of  wonderment.<br />I look forward to more books by Michael Cunningham.
0790737345|5.0|i'm 74and i can remember the days when a movie was an experience. you came out of the theatre, and the movie had become a part of you for a time, and you couldn't tell enough people about it. Mr. Cage made a really, real  angel. the story was handled, with very tender care. i bought the tape and  a dvd  of this movie. i would most definitelynot want to forget it. you see  a movie  like this, and you watch it over and over, and so far as Miss  Ryan, for my money, she can do no wrong, she is always great. I can look at  this kid and i know her gift for acting didn't just happen, and you look at  those eyes and that funny little smile, means only one thing, she willbe  with us for a long time. at times i see a mischevious, young, Hepburn
B000002UZ1|5.0|One could conceivably create a better collection of songs than those assembled here, but such a collection would be too idealic to ever be realized in our less than perfect world.  Suffice to say, this collection  is astounding for how close it comes to such an ideal.  It is inevitable  that the die-hards amoung the Beatles fans will accept nothing short of the  original LP's themselves, but everything has its place.  Since the Beatles  are no longer on the radio, other vehicles are necessary by which people  can access the invaluable legacy the Fab Four endowed to this very grateful  world.  While I agree that this selection is in no way a replacement for  the albums themselves, as a collection of music, it is both remarkable and  useful.  If you want to know why the Beatles are the greatest rock band of  all time, this album provides a definitive answer.
0399143904|3.0|This is the first Tom Clancy book I've read (and I've read almost all) where I found myself looking forward to reaching the end.. They were a few too many &quot;these men were in the fraternity or warriors&quot;-type  comments rather than chapters which showed the depth of detail and research  in earlier books.   Althought there are some great passages, he book was  definitely longer than it needed to be.   I would reccommend Larry Bond  (co-author of Red Storm Rising) as another author.
6303443214|5.0|The book was awesome, and the movie definately did justice!  Most movies that come from books suck, but this movie is now one of my all times favorites.  It ranks right up there with the Silence of the Lambs and The  X-Files: Fight the Future.
6302797535|4.0|This movie had me rolling on the floor the first time I saw it. It has since become one of my favorites, and I can't wait to own it. I only give it four stars because, while the beginning and middle are excellent, the  ending leaves a little to be desired, and could have been written better I  suppose. Overall, I recommend this to anyone who has a sense of humor and  is amused by the strange and silly.
B000009RC2|5.0|McLaughlin spans the spectrum from the melodious tranquility of &quot;Lotus...&quot; &amp; &quot;Dawn&quot; to an almost eerie intensity on &quot;Meeting of the Spirits&quot; &amp; &quot;The Dance of Maya.&quot;   &quot;The Dance of Maya&quot; is a classic example of effortless  &quot;genre-hopping&quot; from 'rock &amp; roll' to 'blues' to 'ragas'  using the most subtle segues WITHIN a single composition.  Billy Cobham is  a veritable &quot;drum machine&quot; on this one and on &quot;Vital  Tranformations.&quot;
B00000ADG2|4.0|After listening to the Miseducation of Lauryn Hill, I understand why it was so highly anticipated!  She has one of the most mature, and soulful voices R&amp;B has had in a long time.  The lyrics are thoughtful,  intelligent and heartfelt.  As a  songwriter, she goes from hip-hop to  soul, to spiritual without missing a beat.     While a lot of attention has  been paid to tracks like &quot;To Zion&quot; and &quot;Doo Wop (That  Thing),&quot;  I enjoyed the two hidden tracks, including her cover of  &quot;Can't Take My Eyes Off You,&quot; the most, because she showcases her  great ability to interpret a song, a la &quot;Killing Me Softly.&quot;  Hopefully, Lauryn Hill will be recognized and rewarded for her incredible  work on this album,  and that other artists will follow suit and put more  of the &quot;soul&quot; back into soul music.
6303014100|5.0|One of the best films I've ever seen! The actor's did a superb job. Truly brought a slice of history to life. I felt drawn into the hearts of the characters. My husband and two teenagers also enjoyed this video very much.
6300216268|5.0|This movie is simply the funniest, most thoughtful, life-affirming film.  Sprinkled with political and spiritual maxims, it's one to watch again and again.
6302136105|4.0|I love the Doors especcially Jim Morrison, and if you are a fan like me, watch it.  But, just to warn you, don't let these exagerations about Jim take you over.  Mr. Morrison was not like Oliver Stone had written about  him, and it makes me sick that they make him look like such a bad guy, when  in reality, most of that didn't happen.  But, Val Kilmer was the best  choice the play Jim Morrison, and all together, the movie was GREAT!!!
6305165912|5.0|If you own Animal House, Vacation, Dumb &amp; Dumber, Fletch or Austin Powers----You will definetly want The Big Lebowski.  Its one that can be watched over and over and over and amuse you to no end.  It needs to be  seen at least 3 times to catch all the sacrastic humor that just kind of  skips by on the first go around.
B000002UB3|5.0|That the Beatles could have recorded this final Opus of perfection while they were nearing breakup  has always represented something special to me.  Towards the end of the album when they exchange fantastic guitar riffs over  Ringo's inspired shots I feel the music defines a final moment I shall  never forget.  This is my favorite album period.  I love jazz, studied  classical music and been a rock fan all my life.  I always come back to the  sounds on this album and I always will.
0767802470|5.0|While the content of this DVD is excellent, as I have noticed on several occasions with DVDs, the picture and sound become fragmented (picture stills, sound stops)when the movie approaches the end or when it goes to  the second layer on the disc. Is there any quality control in production?
6305232660|5.0|I only purchase a movie on DVD when I plan on watching it over and over again. Deep Impact fits that description. This is a very moving film about how different people deal with their own demise, or with surviving, knowing  that their loved ones will not. Summarizing it as &quot;A great big rock  hits the earth, and lots of people die&quot; is simply a cop-out by a  reviewer who doesn't like the type of movie Deep Impact represents and  doesn't possess the maturity to review it fairly.
6301236947|4.0|A true documentary of an Irish band in America.  I really enjoyed seeing the members of the band being interviewed and sharing their thoughts on different subjects.  I also enjoyed the scenes from the different concerts  around the United States from the Rattle and Hum tour. I own all the U2  albums and this was a great addition to my U2 collection.
B000002LOE|4.0|To answer my own question, I think not. No one would say the Beatles were bad [ well, I would, but that's another story. ] and all of their albums were big sucesses. Sure, Out Of Time does have the worst R.E.M. song ever  on it, &quot; Shiny Happy People &quot;, but the melody is fine. The lyrics  just stink. Anyway, this is a lush work, layered with strings and horns as  well as overdubs. The songs are lyrically interesting, and even though  almost all the songs are about love, they're diffrent enough to hold our  attention. &quot; Belong &quot;, for example, is a about a diffrent kind of  love and &quot; Country Feedback &quot;, which has the bleakest view on  love and relationships I have ever heard. The non-love songs are the best,  however. [ &quot; Low &quot;, &quot; Endgame &quot;, and &quot; Texarkarna  &quot;. ] The backing vocals, with liberal use of Mike Mills and Bill  Berry, add depth to all songs, and Mike gets a crack at singing two by  himself.[ proving he is an excellent singer. ] In short, don't buy this for  &quot; Losing My Religion &quot; but all of the wonderful songs on here.
6303430570|5.0|A bunch of 20 something kids in dead end jobs attempt to build themselves up, and create a sense of self worth.  This day in the life picture is something that stands out to people of that age.  <br />As you look at the way  Kevin Smith put all of this together it is very obvious that there were  items of interelatedness to it all.  He has created themes and stuck to  them so there is obvious continuity.  <br />The humor was great, and the  premise was strong.  The swearing was a bit much, but it was real.  All in  all this is a great film to see even if it is just so that you can see what  life is like for a bunch of bored kids.
B00000DGUG|4.0|This is one of those albums that, during the first listening, you think &quot;What the hell is this noise?&quot;. But, after the third of fourth time through, you'll love it! I know that I do. Don't make the mistake of  comparing it to Jagged Little Pill. It's a delightfully different album in  its own right; musically pleasing and lyrically adventurous. Listen to it  on headphones and enjoy the musical subtleties like the soft drums in  &quot;UR&quot;. My favourites include &quot;The Couch&quot;,  &quot;One&quot; and &quot;Joining You&quot;. Each song has its own unique  qualities, rather than being an album of all-alike material. Persevere, and  you won't regret purchasing this wonderful joy to the ear !
0899663036|5.0|Wonderful!Wonderful!Wonderful!I felt sorrow,I cried for the characters,I'll always remember Francie Nolan and her family!!
6304795254|5.0|I disagree with the first customer review, since I have now seen the film three times.  I was surprised that I wanted to see the movie again after knowing the ending, but it is such a compelling story that it transends the  'but only once' surprise ending dilemma.
B000002MG1|5.0|What can I really say about this CD that will do it justice?  It changed my life.  After buying this, music was more than just something to listen to. You could make it, meditate on it, laugh with it, and cry with it.   After playing this CD for the first time, all I said was: &quot; Whoa..  &quot;. These songs were so deep that I instantly stopped listening to all  the other CD's in my collection until I was completley immersed in AFTP. [  These CD's included R.E.M.'s most recent effort at the time, the also good  Monster. ] I picked up a guitar solely because of this album. As for the  songs, &quot; Drive &quot; kept me sane in a world of apathetic middle  school students. &quot; Try Not To Breathe &quot; gave me solace in  lonliness. &quot; The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite &quot; helped me laugh in  dark hours. &quot; Everybody Hurts &quot; brought me back from the brink of  suicide. &quot; New Orleans Instrumental No. 1 &quot; even helped, giving  me an introduction to instrumentals and the organ, which I had never heard  before. &quot; Sweetness Follows &quot; taught me a lesson about mourning  and family. &quot; Monty Got A Raw Deal &quot; showed me the ones with the  most things can be the most empty of all. &quot; Ignoreland &quot; was an  introduction to the world of politics. &quot; Star Me Kitten &quot; showed  me that people can write about sex and be honest about it. &quot; Man On  The Moon &quot; really made me want to play guitar with the awesome solo in  the middle. &quot; Nightswimming &quot; introduced me to a now sacred to me  activity, the one the song is named after. And &quot; Find The River &quot;  taught me to enjoy life and follow dreams - you don't know how long you  have to complete them. All of these good lessons. This album isn't a misery  trip. Rather, it is an evocation of life, and it should be in all music  lover's collectons.
6304925034|5.0|This movie is an absolute treat - one of the very best, if not the best, I have ever seen. Nicholson is excellent and very, very funny. Actually, Nicholson will have you laughing throughout, as the movie coils up to the  wonderful, eerie finale. For suspense and realism (if that's what it is  called) no movie is better.
B00000G3PA|1.0|I do believe this is the worst movie I have ever paid to see. Granted I could only stand the first miserable 2 hours, and just had to walk out of the theatre.  The first time that has ever happened.  Even if you could  ignore all the scientific inaccurasies and go along with the 'filmmakers'  own laws of physics, you are still left with a dismal cast of characters.  Half are not even fit to be in a Wednesday afternoon cartoon, and the other  half are bland and boring. Being obliterated by an asteroid would be a  waste of a good asteroid.
B000000OSW|5.0|This is a truly PROFOUND work, lyrically as well as musically.  I heard it first in 1992 and it spoke to the deep places in my heart.  In 1998 it is still a towering classic:  timeless.  The included artwork links to the  lyrics and the lyrics to the haunting music.  The feel and the texture of  the music touch the deep places in the soul where words alone cannot reach.   This is the story of the hunger for human relationships and the profound  search for LOVE: moving from the pain and confusion of &quot;Come Talk to  Me&quot; through the stuggle to discern the Truth about ourselves in  &quot;Digging in the Dirt&quot;; and then, miraculously, to USE the truth  we have struggled to discern to move us from the Pain to the Change in  &quot;Fourteen Black Paintings&quot;; from which our journey of  self-discovery leads to the re-birth of courage to again take a chance on  LOVE in &quot;Kiss That Frog&quot;.  Thank you, Peter, for speaking to my  own personal, intimate journey in your music, in your words, and in your  choice of artwork.  I listened first from the black hole, alone;  I listen  to it now, with my Precious Princess in my arms.  God Bless You, Peter  Gabriel.
B000002LFU|5.0|This is still the most upbeat album I have ever heard. All the songs are happy, cynical in an upbeat way, or start out sad but end happy-except for maybe &quot; The Wrong Child &quot;. [ is the child's friend in the song  real or imaginary, and are the kids at the end trying to play with the  child or tease them? ] Even in &quot; Orange Crush &quot; the soldier runs  away - to confirm this, get the lyrics and decipher that middle part with  the helicopter noises. Looking back at the time, it seems to be impossible  to make such an optomistic album, but R.E.M. did it. The songs begin  acoustic venturing and loud rock venturing that continue in later years.  R.E.M. would make better albums, but this is a real coherent whole that  begs a listen.
0792840054|4.0|you won't forget this character, Mildred Pierce,lonely, strong and naive altogether, who will fight to become an independant and self-sufficient woman in the America of the 40's..Joan Crawford, once again, is  unforgettable.
6305232660|5.0|How wonderful to see a disaster movie with heart. Deep Imact took a real look at how such a catastrophe would affect peoples lives and relationships.  How enjoyable to see a movie create an emotional response  other than &quot;Wow! cool explosion&quot;.  I find it incredulous that  viewers critisize the movie for it being 'sappy'.  If this  film didn't  stir you I question your humanity. It is hard to believe that, with the  same basic story &quot;Armageddon&quot; was the worst movie I have seen in  a long time, so bad that I walked out after the first silly, shallow,  unimaginative, bland, 2 hours, and regret that I did not leave sooner. If  you saw it (Armageddon), don't let that keep you from seeing &quot;Deep  Impact&quot;.  The characters are real, the emotion is intense, the effects  are thrilling.  It is perhaps best disaster movie in decades.
0374172897|5.0|Michael Cunningham's new book is breathtakingly beautiful, haunting, aching. It's full of life--its beauties and its many horrors, from social events gone wrong to plagues and bone-crushing despair. Gorgeously  imagined, observed with the eye of a scientist who loves nature as much as  himself, and as restrained as the best poetry or painting, THE HOURS is  proof positive that literature has its own kind of necessary intelligence,  without which we cannot hope for the survival of our culture. This is the  kind of book that has to humble anyone who even aspires to writing.
B000002I8D|5.0|Face Value is one of Phil's better albums. Although it is mainly known for &quot;In The Air Tonight,&quot; there are many other tracks that deserve respect. Two incredible instrumental tracks (&quot;Droned&quot; and  &quot;Hand in Hand&quot;) give the album a real 80's feel. Face Value has a  great mixture of up-beat songs as well as slow romantic ones. &quot;In The  Air Tonight&quot; still gives me goosebumps every time I listen to it. It's  too bad that this collection is so underrated. A &quot;Must Have&quot; for  any Collins fan.
0026009102|5.0|Have you ever wondered how we as a people could be so happily discarding good taste for bad? Has it ever occurred to you that there is a trend toward an ever lower common denominator in music, art, politics, ethics,  morals, and virtues? Perhaps you've always believed that this was  inevitable or just the sad &quot;way of the World&quot;. Read this book and  think again!
B00000DHTF|4.0|Collection is almost perfect. Hardcore fans will wonder why &quot;The Promise&quot; -- a song replaced by the title track of Darkness on the Edge of town is not  on it.  And why so many songs based on a version of  &quot;57 Channels&quot;? Where are the live versions of Prove it All Night  and Incident on 57th Street, showing the Boss at his best? <br />Otherwise an  excellent album, and baptism of Bruce into the Rock n' Roll hall of fame.
6305169187|1.0|This movie was terrible.  I am ashamed that I wasted my time watching it.  This &quot;film&quot; is a black eye to the entire movie industry, from writers all the way down to directors and actors.  The only redeeming  qualities in this movie were to be found in the special effects, but there  are too many negative qualities to list . . . oh, let me try anyway:  character development is non-existent, so when the film attempts to create  conflict between characters, no viewer is interested; blatant overuse and  employment of racial, cultural, and gender stereotypes--that is your  character development--I'm surprised they didn't have a drunken Indian (of  course, there was a drunken Russian); suspension of all laws of physics and  probabilities--especially the scenes on the asteroid; finally, since my  time is running short, the entire movie is a video for Aerosmith's  soundtrack.  Gee, how enjoyable.<br />Oh wait, one more comment . . . would it  kill them to do a little research on the script?  The Bible does not refer  to &quot;Armageddon&quot; as the end of the world.  The word means  &quot;Hill of Meggido,&quot; referring to the ancient city overlooking the  Jezreel Valley in central Israel, the scene of several battles throughout  history.  Just keep on feeding us trash, we'll believe it.  Maybe they  should have named the movie something more accurate, like &quot;Flaming  Pile of Junk.&quot;<br />I hated this movie.  It is typical summer blockbuster  trash, that insults even the most miniscule intellect.  Almost, but not  quite, as bad as &quot;Face Off.&quot;
0684843749|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read on bodybuilding. It contains valuable information for everyone, from begginers to professional bodybuilders. If you want to just learn how to get in shape or want to  learn more advanced  bodybuilding, this is the book to read.
0812550706|1.0|Okay, what is it about this book does everyone love?? I don't understand. It's boring, there's no action, and the kid beats people up (not that I mind that). It has GOT to be one of the most boring books I've ever read,  and the few actions scenes are not that well written.

B00000DHR0|5.0|This album is better than I expected it to be.  Most Christmas albums are very predictable in their sound.  This one, along with Vanessa Williams' Christmas album are terrific.  &quot;The Prayer&quot; that is done with  Andrea Bocelli is currently my favorite song.  I listen to it constantly.   The duet with R. Kelly is a close second.  I can definitely do without the  last two songs, but the rest of the album is so great that I can overlook  those two songs.  A definite buy.
0767811038|4.0|Starship troopers is an all-out action movie,don't think about the story-line, just watch &amp; enjoy the massive  firepower &amp; GFX. If you enjoyed the mili-tary-style action of Aliens(Alien II) you'll LOVE this  one!!!. If you are a Star Craft player this movie is a must!!! see the  movie &amp; play the game.
6303149200|5.0|Whenever I recommend this movie to a friend, and they actually find a copy to watch, I get one of two reactions.  Most find it a very disturbing film.  And it is.  Others like Britt Eklund prancing in the nude.  No question,  you need to have a well-honed sense of the absurd, a deep skepticism of  modern society, and an deep philosophical interest in life to enjoy this  film.  If you do, it is richly rewarding, intense, and, ultimately,  haunting.  I highly recommend it.
6300214753|5.0|This is truly a gem of the mid-80s, John Hughes genre and is a must see for every high school student or Generation Xer. Actually, it you are a parent, wait until after your high schooler graduates so they don't get  ideas. Matthew Broderick delivers a wonderful performance as do many of the  co-stars who have gone on to other popular roles. Unfortunately a sound  track was never released (a rarity for a Hughes moview) but there are  terrific flashbacks of 80's punk and alternative songs. So, sit back and  enjoy. Don't try to figure out how they did all that in one afternoon in  Chicago. Remember, &quot;Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look  around once in a while, you could miss it.
B000006OAM|4.0|The best decision Natalie Merchant eve made was to leave the \\"10,000 Maniacs.\\" Thats not to say that \\"10,000 Maniacs\\" wasnt a good band, but lets give Natalie her due. With her first solo album \\"Tigerlily\\" Natalie shocked the nation with its beautiful sound and its elegant style. Songs like \\"Wonder\\" and \\"Carnival\\" shot to the top of the charts like a John Glen's NASA project shot to the moon. But Natalie found a way to out due her debut. \\"Ophelia\\" is the kind of album you listen to straight through without skipping a song. Its the kind of album you leave in your cd player for weeks at time. Songs like \\"My Skin\\" sink into your skin and leaves behind a chill that only Natalies voice can instill. Is Natalie becoming amongst the elite? My answer is YES.

B000002AHM|5.0|By far the best album by this trio of guitar masters.  Distinctive styles that are highly complemtary.  You just know each has the highest respect for the others' artistry.  The players are having fun and the appreciative  audience hangs on every note.  If you're a fan of the jazz guitar, this  belongs in your collection.
B000001F45|5.0|Uriah Heep, five geniuses who run the gamut from fire to ice to lukewarm water, surpassed themselves with this masterpiece of classic rock. Graced with incomprehensible lyrics (save for the brilliant Happy Birthday  sequence), rudimentary instrumental chops (aptly demonstrated by Ken  Hensley's organ licks) and a demented sense of rhythm, The Magician's  Birthday must be heard to be believed. Astounded critics were at a loss to  describe this masterwork. Many of the popular music journals of the time,  failing to come up with words to describe Uriah Heep's unique blend of  cleverness and stupidity, simply didn't run a review. Those that dared to  try to capture in words what this album does were reduced to feeble  adjectives such as \\"pitiful,\\" \\"inane,\\" \\"bloated\\" and the ever popular  \\"utterly ridiculous.\\" Believe the hype - it's everything it's cracked up to  be.
6305169187|4.0|the movie itself was well-written but unrealistic...if there was a comet coming...what are the chances that all the astronauts would be from the us...it was more of a romantic movie...then the action movies that bruce  willis is so famous for.....but all the actors...especially steve buchelli  or something was hilarious...and liv was okay....any other actress could  have done that same thing she did....but bruce and ben were outstanding

He doesn't listen and goes to the space around the Earth and destroys the borg ship.  When Picard  finds out the Earth population is 100% borg he travels back in time to save  the human race.  He runs into some problems when the borg get on his ship  and start taking it over.
0446605409|5.0|Being a first time reader, I am now thoroughly hooked on DeMille's writing style. His portrayal of Detective Corey is wonderfully fresh and quite the opposite of what we are typcially given by authors. The story was great,  but this character was the story! I can't wait to read other books by  DeMille.
0399143904|5.0|This is one of th best books if have ever read. It shows so clearly that we don't have to frighten any more the atomic war. The chemicals and viruses are more dangerous. Tom Clancy describes this in his best book.
6305169187|5.0|Out of all the Movies this Year, Armagedon is the Best one I have seen. Not only from the Dramatic Scene's to the Action Packed Story line. But it really makes you think if something like this where to happen. How would we  stop a Astroid? Also, the Special Effects were Killer.  Not only was it  made by some of the Top 3D Artists, the put the throttle all the way down.  The show us what really can be done with just a computer and alot of time.   Simply put it is a must see for everyone.  It is a great movie for any  occation.  The sound track to the movie was also very good.  I Listen to  Country Music most of the time. But hearing Some of the Older Groups and  the Main Theme Music is just Great.  That is Why I think it is Worth 5  Stars.
6303212379|5.0|The Goonies is one of the best movies I have ever seen!!!  I want to watch it over and over again!!  When I was a kid I would run to the movie place to rent it at least 4 times a week!!  Now I can't find it anywhere!!!   Great movie!!!!  Must see!!!
079283965X|5.0|Sean connery is the best, but Pierce Brosnan is not far behind.  This is still one of the best Bond films of all times.  It goes right alongside Goldfinger and The Man With the Golden Gun.
B000002NJS|5.0|Definitely Madonna's best overall album since &quot;Like A Prayer.&quot;  This time around, Madonna and collaborater William Orbit put glossy melodies and Top 40 sensibility in the back seat and let the emotions and  the lyrics take control.  The title track is her strongest call to the  dance floor in years and easily ranks as one her best songs.  &quot;Frozen,&quot; &quot;Candy Perfume Girl,&quot; and &quot;The Power of  Goodbye&quot; are masterpiences unto themselves. This album establishes  Madonna as a true living legend and is a testament to her longevity in  music and pop culture.
B00000DGUG|5.0|From this moment on Alanis Morisette should be addressed simply as Alanis.  She has quickly aspired to the realm of greatness that Madonna and Janet dwell in.  She has created an album that is quite unparalleled.  Her hooks  have become nearly addictive.        The acoustics she uses on the  recordings give her voice so much more power and range that just makes the  songs so much more irresistable.  he choice of instruments and beats is  also quite interesting.      The high note for me is her use of the drums.   The single greatest moment of the entire album is the 00:31 second on Track  #3, &quot;Thank U&quot;, where he drums come in.  The song would be a  classic with just the background keyboard, yet the use of the drums raises  it to an entirely higher level.      However, the most astonishing feat to  me is how she managed to record a 17-track album without any fillers  (Janet's main downfall: pointless Interludes) or useless poor songs.  Each  song is full of thought, meaningful and best of all, good.      For me to  rattle on anymore about this album is pointless, so I just suggest you pick  it up yourself.  You won't (or shouldn't) be disappointed.
0606042210|5.0|This short, memorable book is one of Dahl's best. The cleverness of the fox in defeating the awful villains is superb. The feast at the end is a fine payoff. With its short chapters and fast-paced plot, it can lure in  reluctant readers. Note to the faint of heart: Dahl is often outrageous and  seldom politically correct. Kids love him!
B00000AFDW|4.0|I want to be brief.  The two best songs on the album are PsychoCircus and Raise Your Glasses.  Everything else is, at best, mediocre and will never see air-play.<br />Gene has a terrible voice.  It is raw without much  character.  His Solo Album back in the 80's was better than anything he has  put out since.<br />Paul is probably the greatest vocalist in rock and roll.   He can belt out rock like never before--and of course, the two best songs,  PsychoCircus and Raise your Glasses are a tribute to his vocal  strengths.<br />Ace and Peter do not add much other than their presence, but  I'm glad their back.  <br />It could have been a Powerhouse album. . .but Kiss  is now, unfortunately, relying on marketing ploys rather than what they are  supposed to earn their paychecks doing:  good rock and roll.<br />I give this  album 3.5 our of 5 stars.
B000002U82|3.0|This is certainly Pink Floyd's most accessible album, and their best post-Barrett work. While I repect the fine production techniques that went into the album (it's best with headphones), I've never been able to listen  to this methodical stuff from start to finish, all the way through. There's  nothing terribly radical about it either, except for the occasional  screaming woman. Still, &quot;Breathe&quot; and &quot;Brain Damage&quot;  are fine songs, especially for alienated young men.
B0000028RR|2.0|Rage Against the Machine is compelling and easy to become enamored with, but they ultimately fall short of most of their goals.  Their leftist rhetoric rings hollow when one realizes that they never seem to offer any  solutions.  Pointing out problems is only the first step.  Their fans are  also puzzling...they seem much more interested in partying and kicking @$$  then in making positive social change.  When I saw RAtM play live, it  seemed like more people were getting beat up than were actually enjoying  the concert.<br />RaTM also suffers from hypocritical tendencies.  Lead singer  Zach De La Rocha has a Latino/ghetto accent when he raps, but in interviews  talks with a typical California newscaster accent.  Why?  Does he fear not  being taken seriously if he doesn't talk like an O.G.?  And why is RAtM on  a major label (Sony, I believe)?  Exactly what machine are they raging  against?  Their rebellion has become a commodity, and every time some  disaffected white kid buys their album and chants &quot;yeah, take the  power back,&quot; Sony laughs all the way to the bank.  In the lyrics,  there are blatant ghetto misspellings (&quot;tha&quot; instead of  &quot;the&quot; is the most frequent) -- I thought RAtM wanted to encourage  education and self-improvement, not ignorance and linguistic  ineptness.<br />Musically, the album is good.  Tom Morello is a great  guitarist with a unique style.  The bass and drums are perfect and can hold  up the rhythm on their own during guitar solos.<br />However, if you listen to  the lyrics and what the group has to say, the album is ultimately  unfulfilling.
B000002GF8|5.0|This is the Police album that succeeds in being a coherent whole. It contains many hit singles, yet they all work together to conjure up a fascinating disturbed vision. &quot;Tea in the Sahara&quot; is downright  spooky. The Police were always a terrific musical ensemble, and these are  many of Sting's best songs.
078322608X|5.0|I am very surprised that this film was not better received in the theatres.  Based on the French short film &quot;Le Jette&quot; which is told only in still photos and voice-over narration, 12 Monkees is an  excellently made movie.  Bruce Willis is a lab rat who is sent back to  Earth before a deadly virus polluted its atmosphere and forced those  survivng human beings to live beneath the planets surface.  The story is  very unique and complex.  Moreover, the story is captiviating and you will  find yourself applauding at the end credits.  A definite collectors item  for sci-fi genre fans.  The film is well written, with excellent acting by  Willis and Brad Pitt.  Terry Gilliam's best work since Brazil. A must  see!!!
B0000025YL|5.0|Germany's premier metal band. This is the first recording of Accept that I ever heard. As soon as I heard the record scratch at the beginning of &quot;Fast as a Shark&quot;, I was hooked. If I had to choose a fave Accept  disk, if not this one then Balls to the Wall would be my fave. None the  less, it just KICKS BOOTIE. From high tempoed, fast paced, as the title  song &quot;Restless and Wild&quot; to more layed back kinda' in your face  thumpin' like &quot;Neon Nights&quot;, this will appeal to all serious  metal-heads. Udo's voice is quite rough on this one, but the intensity of  it fits the music to a tee. Wolf, Peter and Stephen are their usual tight  trio.
B000002GBD|5.0|More than 20 years passed when I heard this album first time. Now I bought it again and I can't stop listen to it. Just great music !!!
0783882963|5.0|The God of Small Things is the most wonderfull novel I have ever read, and I can imagine that all of you who gave it 1 or 2 stars are men. I simply can't imagine a man writing a novel like this. I find her  (A. Roy) much  better than Rushdie, in whose novel The Moor's last sigh there are  beautifull and &quot;unbeatifull&quot; women. Only a man could write  something like that! A. Roy is intelligent, sensitive, simply fantastic!  Even better than Garcia Marquez for magic-realism.
6305169187|4.0|I have to disagree with the idea that if you know anything about science you wont enjoy this movie...  That's like saying that you can't enjoy a Disney film because the animals are talking. I loved this movie! It was a  completely wild  ride and lot's of fun.  Yep, despite my degree in  physics  I managed to enjoy it.
B000003S5H|5.0|All the gushing blurbs you've heard about this cd, all the &quot;you've-got-to-get-it&quot; commands from friends and strangers alike -- its ALL true.  No joke, this CD is not so much of an incredible piece of  music, as it is an event, an important contribution to the sonic world.   Simply impossible to tire of, &quot;Moon Safari&quot; reminds the listener  why music matters (and why we post reviews to thousands of unseen readers).   Buy it, weep for waiting for as long as you did, and then once you've  pulled yourself together, pass the good word along.
079070546X|4.0|This movie is so funny.  You can see your own father stringing up lights like Chevy Chase.  You can see all of your grandparents as the actors portray them.  This is your own family in a way, you will definately be  able to relate to this hilariously funny 80's flick.  A must have!!!  Trust  me this sequel is not a flop like European Vacation.  It is really funny  and you'll want to watch it every year over and over again.
0790729644|3.0|I can't believe that Clint made such a bad transfer to DVD. I saw the film at the theater when it came out in 92 and was amazed at the cinematography, but it was definately not captured in this DVD. Really crapo! I don't know  how the VHS looks but stay away from the DVD unless you really have to have  it. The DVD almost looks like it was &quot;filmed&quot; onto the DVD, that  is, like a bootleg video. I was almost expecting to see people's heads on  the bottom of the frame.<br />Other than the DVD transfer quality, this is one  of the best westerns ever made. The characters are shades of grey or not  black and white like other films. Characters are very realistically  portrayed.
0783225733|5.0|Apollo 13 is in one word: stunning. Sure, I'm a space nut, but this movie goes to show you that movies aren't just about special effects, but an actual story. It was fascinating watching the astronauts work together to  solve their problems with the team at Houston down below. The middle scenes  left you gasping for more. What's so special about this DVD is a special on  the making of Apollo 13, and how it captures Apollo 13's wonderful  theatrical splendor. Apollo 13 is one of the world's most important movies,  along side with Saving Private Ryan. Don't miss this for the world!
B00000018N|4.0|The best music will inspire as well as entertain you.  Some music can change you; this album can.  <br />I am a religious sort and do not agree with most of Ian Anderson's lyrics.  But they challenge me to justify what I do  believe and keep me questioning the truth.  The second half of this album  will separate the pretenders from the faithful.  If you only listen to  people that agree with you, then you have surrendered your  individuality.<br />And if that wasn't enough, there is the music.  Today's  music is made up of new &quot;sounds&quot; that are good for one, maybe  two, songs.  Aqualung is not the one dimensional music we are accustomed to  today.  It will take you on an emotional roller coaster.  That is a big  reason for its continued success today.  This album almost seems to change  each time you listen to it.
0780622553|5.0|Despite the hype that came in the packaging, this is a work of art.  Art, which inevitably has its failings, does not fail to inspire, intrigue, and question.  Dark City does all of this well, drawing on those same  assumptions of reality we all have to create the tension that makes the  message all the more striking.  As a cinematic creation, this is a work  that deserves study, paying tribute to all that came before and deriving a  new genre as a result.  This is a movie about logic, logic in perception,  in expectation, and in conclusion.  For those of us who are fans of Bogart,  the Black Dahlia, British depression, Hellraiser, and Roger Rabbit, this is  the culmination of all of our obsessions.  I'm not usually surprised or  impressed.  I was both.
B000003RCY|5.0|...and we thought after &quot;Neue Deutsche Welle&quot; (Falco/Kraftwerk/Nena...) in the early 80s Germany's music scene had come to a standstill. Boy were we wrong!<br />We never heard this kind of music  played so exactly before. Everything crisp and clear.<br />Funny though to  listen to East-Germans pronouncing the &quot;r&quot; with a  South-German/Austrian accent.
0783221622|5.0|This is absolutely without a doubt the best movie to see if you are interested in the mob, or not for that matter. Robert Di Niro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone are all at their complete best. Never before has  such a  film been so realistic, so true and intense as casino. This film is not too  long, too boring, the only thing it is too much of is intensity.  It is a  true masterpiece.This movie will make your emotions run wild.  I love it!!!   You won't be disappointed, honest.
B00000DHRZ|4.0|This cd is wicked good. My favorite song is &quot;Have You Ever?&quot; I also like the comical side of the Offspring in their songs and videos. I also like the idea of making Americana&quot; a cd extra and having the  &quot;Gone Away&quot; video on there! Mad props to Dexter Holland and the  rest of the guys for making such great music!
B000001ELP|5.0|stuck with material like this. I really think that Paul Stanley's voice can be quite ethereal at times (listen to &quot;The Oath&quot; and &quot;Just A Boy.&quot; Music From the Elder is really a welcomed and quite  necessary evolution for KISS. Songs about underage chicks and rocking all  night can get old very quickly. I'm quite amazed that this KISS line-up  could come up with a product of this caliber, considering the fact that ACE  hated the &quot;new&quot; music and never showed up for the sessions  (supposedly). The Elder has inherent musicality and is dynamic. No other  KISS release before or since sounds quite like The Elder. Gene's &quot;A  World Without Heroes&quot; is truly haunting and pertinent. It almost  sounds like KISS was listening to too much Rush or Yes at time they  recorded this masterpiece. Music From the Elder, although conceptually  pretentious, really lacks the attitude that made previous KISS releases a  bit corny-sounding. &quot;I&quot; is a song that reaffirms individuality  and integrity. Ace's only vocal, &quot;Dark Light&quot; sounds somewhat out  of place and forced, no doubt due to the fact that he probably had to  change the lyrics at the last minute to get at least one of his tracks on  the record. The only real criticism of The Elder is that Eric Carr is not  utilized to full capacity. The guy is absolutely monstrous behind the  skins, but you could never tell by listening to The Elder. I also think he  has a decent voice, which remained vastly underutilized throughout his  tenure with KISS. -David Newman 1998
B000000WG4|5.0|I was first introduced to this album from the movie The Exorcist.  While only a short clip of the music was used in the film,  it got me hooked.  This music conjurs images and feelings that no other piece of music does.   Oldfield clearly proved his talent and creativity with his first record.  A  definite must have for every music lover.
B00000G3PA|5.0|Armageddon is one of best movies that I have seen this year. Some people have said the movie is nonsense, stupid, or pointless. It all depends on who you are, but I think close to 300 million somewhat support this movie  as being one of the best. Bruce Willis is one of the best actors because he  can be serious, funny, and sentimental. Billy Bob Thorton and Liv Tyler  were also outstanding actors as well. Some either like Armageddon or Deep  Impact (it seems like a two-way street). Well, I like them both, but I like  Armageddon better because it has more suspense and action, and it's a movie  that I would watch over and over again. Although the ending is not the way  we would want, it gives the movie more meaning. Definitely get this DVD!
B00000DGUG|1.0|I found this album dull and unmoving.  It completely lacks the emotion she demonstrated in her first release, and I found myself unable to pay attention long enough to finish listening to a single track.
0783226659|5.0|AMISTAD is one of Steven Spielberg's most compelling stories, treating a very hard and almost unspeakable subject in a very vivid, yet not morbid way. Morgan Freeman's performance is, as usual, astounding, even if his  role is not as highlited as the rest of the cast, who do a superb task at  characterizations. Matthew McConaughey, in the tradition of &quot;A Time To  Kill&quot; delivers a performance which is proper of the GREAT actors. not  to mention Pete Postlethwaite and nomine Anthony Hopkins. The story is for  hard stomached people and it's beautifully handled. A MUST SEE. I can't  believe it didn't receive more Academy Award nominations, but well, you  really need to see this one. John Williams music score is also worth his  name, it had been a while since he rendered such a beautiful score.
0783229526|1.0|Let me start by saying that I am a Gilliam fan, and that I have nothing against 'trippy' movies, but I couldn't stand this one. Even the dazzling effects couldn't hide the fact that there was no plot here, no story, no  character development - all I saw was the same stupid drug-jokes over and  over. Ha ha, look at the man in the funny hat stumble and force his way in  to see Debbie Reynolds. Whatever...
B000007OY0|5.0|I love this movie, and everything about it. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. It's one of those movies that could be 4 hours long, and you would not care or notice because it so well done. We've seen  movies in situations about jail life, but in my oppinion, no movie has ever  captured the moment like Shawshank Redemption. All the actors do there  finest work in this movie. Even the minor ones deserve awards for  performance. This is a movie for women and men. Besides the Star Wars  Trilogy, this is my favorite movie of all time.
B000009QB0|5.0|This movie is one of my families' favorites year round. Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) tries his best to have a nice family Christmas get together. But, everything thing he attempts from cutting down the family Christmas  tree, putting up the lights, getting them to light, spending his bonus he  never receives, hosting family members that don't get along, fails!<br />You  will watch this time and time again as we do.
B0000029GA|5.0|Nasir Jones, Nasty Nas, &quot;straight from the dungeons of rap where fake.....dont make it back.&quot; This album is a pure example of what hip-hop should be. Nine(excluding the intro) lyrically gifted tracks with  the beats to match, make the perfect album. Nas talks about his life and  things that he sees everyday. He takes you from a New York State of Mind to  a trip down Memory Lane. I dont think anyone can match the way he flows  over every beat, wether fast or slow, his performance is unmatched. No  album will ever be made to exemplify hiphop the way this album does.This  album has the  perfect mix of potent lyrics and the beats to provide the  mood for the song. This album is the epitome of perfection and is what all  other hiphop albums should be graded by. This is the true 5 mic classic,  the greatest album of all time.
0316926345|4.0|The melancholic mood of the book makes it perfect ot be read under the shadow of a tree or on dark rainy afternoons. The dissapearence of a time, of a family, a class, and a love is perfectly mixed in the same story. But  to feel it the book shall be read according to its inner pace. If you read  it all in one night somehow you will lose part of its beauty. Also you  shall not read this book if you are looking for action and fun.
6305232660|3.0|I thought that movie was well written and it had decent special effects, but it's lacking if you're are looking for a typical blockbuster-special effects movie. The story may seem similiar to Armageddon, but the focus is  more on what would happen if people became a victim of this disaster. The  movie has some the best actors (Freeman, Duvall), but just because you have  liked these actors' past films does not guarantee you will like this one. I  thought the acting was great. The only thing this movie suffers from is  jumping from one scenerio to the next in extremely fast manner. This can be  frustrating because you want to know more about each scene but you're left  blank, and some things are never answered. Armageddon may have been less  mature, but, hey, that what makes money. If you liked Armageddon, give  &quot;Deep Impact&quot; a try. You might like it.
B000005QH3|5.0|I saw this movie upon its original release and have been unable to locate it since. the chase scenesand soundtrack are classics. I must,I shall, have a copy for my library.this video will get as much wear as &quot; The Road  Warrior&quot;. THANK YOU Amazon for having it !!
6302518423|5.0|Greenaway's adaptation of the Tempest is a beautiful, lavish production. Narrated primarily by the magician Prospero, the events of Shakespeare's last play are dramatized as masques with beautiful Renaissance costuming  and musical scores. As the master of the word, Prospero with his library  creates and orchestrates the magic and poetry that is The  Tempest. Viewers with preconceived expections about the play or  narrow, Hollywood-dulled film tastes will not appreciate Greenaway's work.  Prospero's Books is best suited to people with broader  tastes, especially in European film.

B000002KOJ|5.0|Joni Mitchell's &quot;Clouds&quot; album is just beautiful.  It combines simple yet thoughtful melodies with very personal, moving lyrics.  In my opinion, although all of the songs on the album are exquisite, &quot;Tin  Angel&quot; and &quot;Roses Blue&quot; definitely stand out.  They are sad  and utterly beautiful.  I would recommend any Joni Mitchell album,  especially this one and Blue.
B00000G3CK|5.0|Illuminates the art of mathematics and numerology.  One of the best films released in '98.
B000002O2Y|5.0|This is one of my favorite records of all time.  Every song on it is cool.  The mood the band creates is sometimes somber, but on the whole it is uplifting and exciting.  Swan Swan H is beautiful.  Begin the Begin is a  great rock and roll song with an incredible guitar hook, and Superman is a  somewhat anthemic piece which practically begs the listener to sing along.   It's a musical treat!
0787117668|5.0|This book was written by John Kennedy Toole in 1963, while he was in his twenties serving in the U.S. Army.  It was published a decade after the author's death and won the 1981 Pulitzer Prize for fiction.  It is the most  original, the most satirical, and the funniest book I've read.  What John  Kennedy Toole observed in 1963 New Orleans resonates with the U.S.  thirty-five years later.  The protagonist is so poignantly described that  he can't be far from Toole himself. Bear with him for the first few pages  and you'll be hooked on this unlovable character to the finish, where the  story's perfect symmetry implodes on itself. I only wish that Toole had  endured life to share his perception, wit, and writing with us for at least  one more book.
B000001EAQ|5.0|I discovered u2 on this album and a year and a half later it still is one of the most important cd's to me.  I love how at first it seems lightweight on the surface but underneath has some of the most intense, pointed lyrics  ive ever heard on an album.  To me this album puts me in a place and frame  of mind and through that encourages me to discover what i feel is pretty  much the theme of this album...searching for spirit, love and god in the  wrong places...looking for transcendence in a club.  Mofo is a wonderful  example of this and a great interp to me of how club culture and  spirituality really intersect.  If god will send his angels is another  favorite of mine on this disk, and gone is great u2, period. Please is  heart-grabbing live and wake up dead man is one of the best descriptions of  the 20th century and our opinion, belief/disbelief in god that ive heard in  a long time.  I found Alot of redeeming qualities in this album and it  definitely changed the way i look at music and its power...u2 is simply a  great band and a thankful interruption of the 5th rate grunge and cynical  music that has seemed to plague most of the 90's...
B00000AFGM|5.0|I'm giving this album five stars for the simple reason that MM has managed to upset a very large number of people with the cover art.  I even knew a guy who said that he thought it was a real photo!  Thus, due to the fact  that people are idiots by nature, this album gets a five.  The content, on  the other hand... well, let's just say that if you want music by a man who  craves atttention, stick to Elton John.  Much more creative.
B000000XCK|3.0|Of Creedence Clearwater Revivals seven recordings of original material, this disc I would rate as the weakest.  However, it is not bad by any stretch of the imagination.  What makes is pale in comparison to their best  work is an overuse of organ sounds on many of the tracks.  And the last  &quot;song?&quot; Rude Awakening #2 is just a noise fest after the first  minute or two.  Outside of that there are several worthwhile tracks most  notably the beautiful &quot;Have You Ever Seen The Rain&quot; and the  spunky &quot;Molina&quot;.  Every now and then its a nice listen.
0156421178|5.0|In 1936 Orwell fell in love with worker-Anarchist controlled Catalonia. Of course, he was on the Loyalist side. But he did not realize, at first, the nature and extent of the conflict within the Loyalist side. The reactionary  press was saying the Loyalist's side was Communist. But the truth is that  the Communists originally had very little influence at the beginning. The  Communists were able to gain power because the Soviet Union was the only  country supplying the Loyalists with arms. In addition to his experience as  a memeber of the P.O.U.M (Workers Party of Marxist Unification) militia and  his nearly fatal shot wound through his neck, Orwell recounts the small  civil war--within the civil war--following the Communist action to take  over the Anarchist-run telephone exchange in Barcelonia in May 1937. He and  his wife escaped into France when the Communist-controlled police of  Barcelonia outlawed the P.O.U.M. But, most important, are chapters five and  eleven, where Orwell sorts out the politics on the Loyalist side.

6302424739|5.0|I am a book lover and a fan of Hopkins. When I saw the video introduction, I thought this might be a good movie, but after I watch this, I realized this is more than I anticipated. Idon't know much about the English book  world (I am Japanese), and this movie told me many things about books.
B000002E5J|5.0|In her first international record Shakira displays a flair for sincere song writing, and heartfelt singing. Mostly acoustic ballads with pop beats, a truly memorable set full of hits including &quot;Donde Estas  Corazon&quot;, &quot;Se Quiere Se Mata&quot;, &quot;Estoy Aqui&quot;, and  &quot;Antologia&quot;
0780622553|5.0|Where was this movie released?  <br />Literally this is one film that you have to have in your library.  When your grandchildren are talking about what created cinema from this decade they will mention this film.  It's in  a class with Citizen Cane.  <br />That may seem high praise, but it is very  difficult to find anything wrong with this film other than the fact that it  wasn't widely released.  That's probably because this isn't a simple  movie.<br />You can enjoy the graphics.  The story line is strong.  But as  Roger Ebert says in the first line of his commentary track that runs the  length of the entire film, it is &quot;Visionary&quot;.  If there is a  single transcendental film for this era, this is it.  <br />Others may win  Academy awards, but this film will be remembered in the future as what film  art can be.
B000002ADT|5.0|I first hear this album in college while doing jazz radio for the college station.  The format of the station was jazz, and I had no choice but to play it. I thought jazz was just noise, and then I heard this album.  I had  never heard anything like it and have yet to hear anything like it ever  again.  One of the greatest ever.

B0000042H4|5.0|More than enough perhaps has been written on the performance itself so more from me is probably not needed. The  major concern to prospective buyers might be the quality of transfer given the unimpressive early  individual issues on CD. The idea of noise suppression of any sort is  normally an instant no-no but in this case it works brilliantly. I have the  original(ish) vinyl and this boxed set has nearly all of the 'color' of the  original issues. Goose-bumps all over. Wonderful!    Quibble: Flimsy  packaging may not stay the course as long as the discs themselves.     Additional recommendation: Do yourself a favor and order a copy of the  Cooke guide to the Ring (see elsewhere in this listing) at the same time  for maximum enjoyment, particularly if coming to these works for the first  time.
6304539495|5.0|This movie to me represents an artistic , entertaining view at an ever perplexing question ;where does the soul reside in one's body? &quot;G.I.T.S&quot; presents the question that After extensive augmentation  , where is the room in the body  for the &quot; ghost &quot; In the  &quot;shell&quot; . This movie has ,I believe , set the standard for story  and art in anime.
B00000099Y|4.0|Tool's CD, Anemia, has many excellent tracks, like forty six and two, as well as Anemea.  They have a nice, flowing tune, while rocking with the great lyrics and base.  But, Hooker with a Penis, has no musical quality at  all.  All in all, this CD is a definite buy!
6302752337|1.0|I first saw this film when it was released in 1969 and thought the critics of the day had gone collectively mad. Everyone in the entire film, whether it's &quot;heroes&quot; Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper or their antagonists,  are annoying. Jack Nicholson is the only one that attempts to create a  character out of his role. There is no story and theneverending vignettes  are pointless and/or pretentious. The script, if there was one, consists of  Dennis Hopper saying &quot;man&quot; every fifteen seconds.This film was  dated when it was released. Today, it's laughable.
0800184327|5.0|I was told that this movie wasn't in the theater long because it wasn't that great. I saw it on a flight returning from Denver and I wanted to get up in the aisle and dance during the entire movie.  It was clean, funny and  GREAT dancing!!!
B000003TAR|4.0|When I first listened to this album I was surprised how unpleasant and harsh some of the songs were compared to their big hit album, Nevermind. But over time I've come to appreciate this CD what it is, a collection of  some good punk/grunge songs, and a reaction against the commercial success  of their second and most famous album. How typical that the radio songs on  this album are the worst, even though they're just the kind of Top 40 ear  candy people wanted from Nirvana's third major release. This CD takes some  getting used to, but it's definitely worth the effort.
630512065X|4.0|Having seen &quot;Cats&quot; live, only once , I was thrilled to be able to see it whenever I wanted. That live performance was from somewhere in the first 20 rows of a smaller theatre...seating less than 2500 people.   Even then, the performer protraying Grizabella, brought tears to my eyes  with her perfomance of Memory.  But being able to see Ms. Paige perform  Memory is rather like seeing Mozart conduct Eine Kleine Nachtmuzik.  Her  emotion even more visible with the camera close-ups. My next favorite  segment of the musical is still Macaverty.  The two female performers are  terrific.  I did not miss the portion of the musical where the siamese, I  believe, perform in a segment that brings to mind The King and I rather  than alleycats.. Hats off to the make-up team for their terrific work on  the various characters 'masks.'  Every feline character definitely had his  or her own look while remaining solidly feline.  I especially loved  Exotica, and the character (sorry the name escapes me), singing the duet  leading into Memory with Grizabella. Nothing captures the magic of live  theatre, therefore, the 4 star rating.  I did enjoy the close-ups and  different perspectives.  A little more full stage viewing to capture the  group as a whole, with the almost subliminal interaction going on off to  the side, would have rounded out the video production.
B000003TA4|3.0|The scary thing about some of the reviws here is their suggestion that there's something brilliant about *anything* in this album. Cobain was a mediocre guitarist (some of the first things I learned on guitar were from  &quot;Nevermind,&quot; like SLTS and &quot;Come as You Are&quot; -- the  only term in Cobain's guitar music vocabulary must've been &quot;power  chord&quot;) and vocalist. The opening riff to SLTS morphs several times  throughout the album, to the point where it really is hard to tell one song  from another sometimes. In fact, it consists of 95% of each song, with the  exception of the occasional pathetic solo. But most of these songs are  definitely catchy, and the sound is decent. Popping this CD in the player  for the first time in a couple years, I realized why I originally liked  &quot;Nevermind&quot; -- it's full of catchy songs from beginning to end,  but that's it. The music is incredibly straightforward and simplistic.  Nirvana's last studio album, &quot;In Utero,&quot; while less polished and  sometimes a bit irritating, has some much better songs than this one,  though of course the only ones you heard on the radio were Nevermind-esque;  the same old riffs and uninspired lyrics played over and over.
B000005ITX|5.0|this cd is years ahead of its time. the psychedelic/orchestra driven songs of arthur lee still hold up as melodiously today asthey did 30 years ago.<br />this cd is a must for any true music fan. no wonder the doors once  hoped that they could be as big as love.though the doors never made an  album this intricate and spellbinding.
0140277447|1.0|Like all atrocity stories, the events in Nanking are so horrific that they speak for themselves.  Unfortunately for the reader, Iris Chang doesn't believe this.  She keeps telling us that the actions of the Japanese were  barbaric! etc.  Starting with the introduction, she inserts herself into  the book in a self-congratulatory manner that trivializes the tragedy she  is writing about.  And then there is the bizarre structural problem -  history told Rashomon style.  Doesn't work here.<br />These comments may be  viewed as unduly harsh since Chang has indeed done a service in  resurrecting this story.  But simply because a book is about a worthy  subject does not mean that the book is inherently good.
B00000FCBC|4.0|I have to admit I was a little leary about getting this album after being bored to death with &quot;Load&quot; and &quot;Reload.&quot;  I was very disappointed in those and thought they were finished.  But I decided to get  it because of Garage Days disc two.  When I popped in disc one, I hear  &quot;Free Speech For the Dumb&quot; and realized that I hadn't heard them  rock like that since the Black album.  Then &quot;It's Electric,&quot; came  on and also rocked.  I was so happy with this cd set.  Although I like disc  two a little more because it reminds me of my younger years, I love it all.  I am so happy these guys still know how to rock.  &quot;Tuesday's  Gone&quot; was quite a different sounding song, but I liked it.  I don't  mind the mellow stuff as long as it isn't all slow.  You should get this cd  if you're a fan of the old or the new.

B000002UDV|5.0|Much praise has been heaped upon this album, and those who are unfamiliar with it may wonder why. There are many reasons, but some of them include: 1. the warmth and richness of the sound, Phil Spector-ish but not quite as  mushy. Each groove sounds like a canyon. The sheer variety of instruments  and timbres is boggling. 2. the intricacies of the vocal arrangements,  which are dazzling, especially in &quot;God Only Knows&quot; 3. the  cleverness of the bass lines, which do unexpected and influential detours  4. the hopeless sincerity of Brian Wilson, who by laying bare his inner  loneliness somehow manages to bestow upon us love and good vibes at the  same time. A must for any serious collector of pop music.

B000002NBY|5.0|This was one of the few albums that ever actually deserved its &quot;Album of the Year&quot; Grammy Award. Simon has found some of the funkiest music in the world in South Africa (plus New Orleans, New York, and L.A.) and  combined it with his own unique songwriting prowess. Simon's lyrics are  abstract yet powerful, and the musicians and singers he works with are top  notch. His musical briliance is well illustrated by one detail: the  deliberately sharp (as opposed to flat) acoustic guitar stabs in the  choruses of &quot;Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes.&quot; Astoundingly  new when it was released, it remains fresh today.
B00000G6TK|4.0|To save Mott the Hopple, David Bowie had to kill it. Bowie had the band do a couple of fashionable covers(Lou Reed), a handful of Ian Hunter originals and Bowie's own killer song(which Hunter made his own--check out the  original demo and compare the two). The album cleaned up the band's sound  and, while the Blonde on Blonde influences were buried, Hunter and Ralphs  found their mature songwriting voice.<br />The album sounds terrific--worlds  better than the muffled version issued by Columbia in 1988. While the  production is a little sterile and lacks some of the fire from their  earlier albums, the album's slickness is its salvation with some of the  weaker songs.<br />Bowie encouraged Hunter to take the leadership role in,  what essentially, had been a democracy. By taking a leadership role  Hunter  helped create the band's best album MOTT, and also, inadvertantly, managed  to push the band's other key member Mick Ralphs out(Verden Allen left as  well).<br />The follow up album, THE HOPPLE, would have been a stronger album  with the input of Ralphs, or even Mick Ronson if he had come on board a  little earlier. But, sadly, that was not to be. Still, this is a terrific  album and, although not up to BRAIN CAPERS or MOTT, has moments that stand  up to the best music by Mott and the best music in rock'n'roll.
B000002UAU|5.0|This is a great album for those of us who are big fans.  Someone who is looking for an introduction to The Bealtes should get a different album such as Magical Mystery Tour or Revolver.  For a real fan, this album is  amazing.  Even the cover is cool.  Any real music fan should own this cd.
B000005S2F|5.0|THERE IS A PERIOD OF TIME ( 1975 - 1980 ) THAT REPRESENTS THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE ATTAINEMNT OF BOWIE'S TALENT (ALBUMS INCLUDED: &quot;LOW&quot; &quot;HEROES&quot; &quot;LODGER&quot; AND &quot;SCARY MONSTERS&quot;).  THOSE OF YOU WHO WOULD CONSIDER THE ABOVE MENTIONED ALBUMS AS BOWIE'S BEST  SHOULD REALLY DIVE INTO &quot;EARTHLING.&quot; THOUGH AT FIRST  &quot;EARTHLING&quot; MIGHT SOUND TOO MUCH LIKE STANDARD TECHNO IT, OVER  TIME, REVEALS IT'S SELF TO BE ANYTHING BUT &quot;STANDARD&quot; IN ANY  CATAGORY.

B000002UZ1|4.0|Four stars is the lowest I can possibly go on any Beatles album and here is the reason why this album deserves that mark. I agree with the person who said that this album was made for Beatles novices. Not only does it  have almost the entire Magical Mystery Tour album on it, but it neglects so  many other great songs. The &quot;White Album&quot; is poorly represented  on this album which is its major downfall. If you want to get to know The  Beatles buy the &quot;White Album&quot;, it is arguably the best album the  band ever made, musically and creatively. The &quot;White Album&quot; is so  extremely emotional considering what the band was going through at the  time, and it really is the  first taste we get of The Beatles as  individuals. So if you want to listen to why The Beatles are the best band  there ever was, and ever will be; buy the &quot;White Album&quot;.
1558807381|3.0|As a long-time fan of fantasy films and classic mythology,I was both disappointed and enchanted by this little film. Starring a very young Tom Cruise, the storyline and acting are somewhat oversimplistic and sketchy.  Character development was not a priority for this story. On the other hand,  the film is saturated with a dreamy, surreal beauty that makes it easier to  overlook its acting flaws. Some of the makeup effects, in particular Old  Meg the swamp witch and Tim Curry as the Lord of Darkness, are breathtaking  even by today's standards. Don't go into this movie expecting a gripping  epic but overall it is well the worth the time it takes to watch.
B000002UAX|5.0|This album is the greatest work I think ever manufactured in this day and age of modern music. No band around these days can, or could have touched this band. Not even The Rolling Stones. I can't believe people even use the  two bands in the same sentence. In this album The Beatles branched out into  all different genres of music, from slightly heavy metal(Helter Skelter) to  a kind of country/folk song(Rocky Raccoon). And then along with those you  have some of the best classic rock songs ever written, While My Guitar  Gently Weeps and Revolution 1. You also have some of the best  Lennon/McCartney love songs ever written; I Will, Julia, and Dear Prudence.  It also has some of the best lyrical writing ever put down by The Beatles  with songs like; Happiness Is a Warm Gun, Sexy Sadie, Cry Baby Cry,and  Blackbird. If you love music in general then this is a must have, and if  you like The Beatles and don't have this album then you better get in gear  and buy this masterpiece of music excellence.

B000002KAT|3.0|I was always puzzled why many think this is Van's best album.  Yes, it is good--but not great. &quot;Sweet Thing&quot; and &quot;Young Lovers Do&quot; are the only classics on this record, others are OK but nothing  special compared to tunes on some of his other albums.  I much prefer  &quot;Moondance&quot;, &quot;His Band &amp; The Street Choir&quot; or maybe  &quot;Too Long in Exile.&quot; Go Van!
B000000WA4|5.0|mellon collie and the infinite sadness is THE most greatest and beautiful album i ever heared. to my opinion, these is the best album by my favourite band- the Smashing Pumpkins!!!! they have very interesting lyrics  like:&quot;maskera sure and lipstick lost...&quot; and two of there best  hits:&quot;tonight, tonight&quot; and &quot;1979&quot;. so does many other  great songs like:&quot;here is nowhere&quot;, &quot;purcelina of the vest  ocean&quot;, &quot;bullets and butterfly wings&quot; and more. thes album  has 2 CD's, 28 songs and more then 2 hours of great music that could be  only made by the graetest band ever: the Smashing Pumpkins!!!
079213690X|5.0|I believe this is the greatest movie ever made. The production easily equals GWTW, but slightly edges it out because of the rousing themes of true love, courage, self-sacrifice.   This movie should have sweeped the  oscars, but only won best picture and director because of the Hollywood  community's intense hatred of conservative moral themes.  The pathetic bias  is revealed by the fact that this literary masterpiece was beaten for best  original screenplay by &quot;The Usual Suspects.&quot; Puhleeeze. Anybody  see it? (didn't think so)

6304145438|4.0|This movie never interested me until I started watching once in the middle of it: the scene where Stewart storms away from Ma Bailey's Boarding House &amp; stares into the camera is spine tingling! So is the scene where he  lunges after Donna Reed! It's real film noir as family fare! By the way, to  see what actors mean by range, compare Lionel Barrymore's curmudgeonly Mr.  Potter in this movie with his Key Largo role a year later as the grieving  Mr. Temple.
0767802659|4.0|The movie bears little resemblance to Robert A. Heinlein's classic book. But that's OK, because director Paul Verhoeven finds more creative ways to gruesomely kill people than in this movie than in any other movie I've  seen. Bloody, intense fun! Those people who complain about the obliteration  of RAH's admittedly contoversial political philosophy missed the point of  this film. Verhoeven never said he wanted to pontificate about future  society...he just wanted to impale people really good!!! Oh yeah, and about  the removal of the robotic suits Heinlein fans seem so obsessed about:  Verhoeven ditched the robo-armor because the special effects required would  double the cost of the film. In my opinion, concentrating on the bug  effects was the right way to go. Go ahead and see this movie, but leave the  kids at home. Definitely worth renting, to buy it is up to you.

Heston once again displays a full  range of emotions -  Sophia Loren complements the stage with her radiant  beauty and turbulent emotional conflict which comes to a final resolution.  The bigger  the screen the better, folks, but I could never stop wondering  if there was about an hours worth of the movie that never made it to the  screen... Still worth watching, and I have, several times. Heston and Loren  fans - you can't miss with this.

B000000WFZ|5.0|I will never forget the day I heard a portion of The MISSION soundtrack the first time: I was a student at UCLA for the summer and happened to be touring various shops in Beverly Hills. A little nature store had it  playing and I was just so moved by the beautiful, yet haunting melodies. I  bought it on the spot, and have bought at least 6 copies since then and  given as gifts. EVERYONE loves it!!! A friend says he's been waking up to  &quot;Gabriel's Oboe&quot; every morning for 3 years and counting. It is  truly music which transcends one's soul. I've never seen the movie, but the  music has filled me with such emotion, time-and-time again. This is one  soundtrack I'd recommend without reserve to everyone.

6303855512|5.0|In an era where big budget glitz rules the film industry, a well crafted movie like Smoke is a breath of fresh air. Harvey Keitel, who plays the central character of Augie, is the one constant in an ever-moving stream of  humanity that is Brooklyn. Augie is both witness and participant,and  through the lens of his street corner perched camera, we  realize that the  world is made up of millions of stories, nearly all of which are in some  way compelling. William Hurt's character is one such story. Once a prolific  writer, Hurt's talent has been thwarted by life's brutality, one which we  are reminded of constantly thoughout the film. Finally, he is able to deal  with the grief of his wife's loss throught the selfless act of helping a  young runaway. The scene where Hurt spots his wife in one of Augie's street  corner photographs is one of the films many poignant moments. Great  performances are delivered without exception by all the actors, but as is  the case in so many of his films,Mr. Keitel steals the show. Probably more  so than any actor of his generation, Harvey Keitel has mastered the ability  to create characters who are both human, warts and all, yet also  sympathetic. The telling of his Christmas story to the faithful customers  of the smoke shop is probably the highlight of this film and is simply a  brilliant piece of story-telling. What makes Smoke so different from  mainstream movies is the fact that one can't help but feel that one is  watching a well acted play, in that every line of dialog is so crucial,  every character so meaningful.Not a scene could have been deleted without  seriously damaging the final product, and when was the last time you could  say that about a film? Smoke portrays Brooklyn convincingly as an exotic  stew of diverse cultures and personalities, and in at least some of these  personalities we must surely see a bit of ourselves.
0780622642|2.0|Sorry folks, having grown up during the era of Star Trek, Lost in Space, Land of the Giants, this remake movie bears some similarity to the series but unfortunately did not come anywhere near my expectations hopes or  dreams. Put me to sleep halfway through. Not worth the powder to blow to  hell. Hope there's no sequel.....that would be more of a tragedy than the  money spent  on Uncle Billy's lies on tape......save your money for  something else.
B000000OPU|5.0|I am gald that I am alive at the same time as peter gabriel is to hear his increadable music.  When I first heard So, I thought I was in some kind of dream. PG writes thought provocing, witty, insightful lyrics, that take  each listener on a journey that they will never forget.  The first track,  &quot;Red Rain&quot;, opens with the line, &quot;I am standing at the  waters edge of my dreams&quot;.  Only Peter can write such deep, amazing  lyrics that will make you break down each song until you can figure out  what the meanings are.  Each track is more than a song, it's a production.   This album is something that takes 45 mintues of your time but will last  you a lifetime.  If you don't have &quot;So&quot;, there is something worng  with you.

B000001FA4|4.0|U2 is probably my favourite band, if you only look at what they did in the 80's. I have long thought that the Joshua Tree is their best album, and I probably still do, but currently this one is my favourite. Pride and  Unforgettable Fire are two of the greatest songs of the 80's--stirring,  beautiful, bringing on chills down the spine. A Sort of Homecoming is at  the moment the U2 song which I find the most moving, almost unbearably so.  The only reason I give this four rather than five stars is because 4th of  July and Elvis Presley shouldn't really have made it onto the album. In all  other respects, a masterpiece.

6305089957|4.0|I loved the first Scream movie and the second one, in many ways, is even better. Because it has the first one to work off of, it can be even more witty and have more in-jokes.

Best sequence: Sidney's play rehearsal
0140277447|4.0|As someone who was born and grew up in Nanking (now spelled as Nanjing), I am very grateful to Iris Chang for her great courage to write this book. As it is always the case, the first book on an important subject may not be  the best-written one, but it is extremely important to bring up the subject  to the attention of the general public. Hopefully, better-written books on  the same subject will soon come along. I have never thought that this  massacre could have been such a best-kept secret in the English-speaking  world. There is at least as much to learn about why it was so as to know  more about the massacre itself. There is a great historical lesson to learn  in this case. We should ask ourselves why history has been distorted for so  long. We need to look around to see if any other period in history has been  misrepresented. For those who want to learn about what has really happened  to the city of Nanking after the massacre during the past sixty years, I  offer my own book, Thirty Years in a Red House, a Memoir of Childhood and  Youth in Communist China, recently published by the University of  Massachusetts Press. As we are now living in the Information Age, we should  not let our recent history be best-kept secret or misrepresented again. A  great history book is the one that has more or less changed the prevailing  views. For that reason, I salute to Iris Chang for a great job done.
6300268993|1.0|Although 'fantasy', the Superman mythos is pretty defined -- especially his powers. This movie felt entirely justified in altering the powers to fit the storyline, without any apparent need to do so. Superman teleports,  Superman has magic forgetful breath, Superman has a big cellophane shield,  Superman can be invisible, Superman can make multiple clones of himself.  Please. Very disappointing sequel, and it only gets worse in III and IV.  Did they ever even read the comic, or were they blinded by the pretty  primary colors?
B000001E2W|3.0|New frontman John Bush is not featured on this CD which captures the Anthrax of old.  Classic songs like Parasite, Antisocial, and Bring the Noise are found, but the recording is not of the highest quality.  Lesser  known tracks like I am the Law and In My World were recorded in a small  club and sound awesome.
B000002JSH|3.0|The above CD/record musicwise is of mereordinary value.  The group more or less repeats their slam bam thank you maam  formula from their debut recording with slightly less successful results.  Shooting Star is a really  beautiful song though and Deal With The Preacher, Feel Like Making Love and  a couple of others are interesting as well.  However, what makes this album  stand out is the cover of the red dice on a craps table.  The album jacket  is a winner too as there is a shot of the band from the rear in cowboy duds  and flip the jacket around and you see them dressed to the nines.  Throw in  the cover and album elevates to a 3 and a half rating.
6305161976|5.0|Start your classic movie collection with Casablanca.  All the amenities of laserdisc and no side breaks!  To the reviewer from Berkeley, this film has no widescreen version because it's original aspect ratio is 4:3, the same  as a TV.  Thus, the film is not a pan and scan.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|Definetly your money's worth. I recommended as top ten cd of all time. All the favorites hits on this baby. Buy it today. This is one of best CD's i own, And i listen to all kinds of music.
B00000DHR0|5.0|I believe this is her best album yet. Her voice makes you melt! You really feel the spirit of what Christmas is supposed to be about once you listen to her CD. It is absolutely beautiful!
B000005ALN|5.0|The entire CD is amazingly beautiful... The words and melodies are great...a great CD to listen while you are chatting with friends or just alone in your car...
B000001EIA|5.0|This is the way KISS was intended to be played.  Their songs sound so fresh on this album, lets hope they will be remembered as musicians rather then freaks.
B000000WF0|1.0|Is there something wrong with me? This CD is like the number one CD in Britian. It sucks! WARNING REAL MUSIC FANS: this CD can be summed up in two words: EASY LISTENING. Sure, you may buy it for Bittersweet Symphony, but  the rest of the CD is a total turn off. I don't understand a lot of things  from GB - the Spice Girls, Mr. Bean, Tea and Crumpets - and you can add  this band to the list.
6304083769|5.0|The story focuses around a woman cyborg named Motako.  She is part of an elite police force that inspects terrorists and hackers.  It seems that recently there has been many hackers who have penetrated government  computers but the hackers have been &quot;ghost hacked&quot;.  This means  that their memories have been erased and have been implanted with fake  ones, so the hackers don't really know what they are doing.  Along the way  we meet an elite hacker calling itself &quot;The Puppet Master&quot; which  Motako must investigate.  This is a fabulous anime that will have fans of  Cyberpunk and Shadowrun drooling over it's details.  Buy it don't just rent  it.  Then buy five more just to make sure you won't lose one! (joking)
6300248143|5.0|Well its the best science fiction movie in my book anyway. A James Cameron masterpiece. Usually sequels do not add up to the original, but this is different. The technical and special effects aspects of this movie have  made it a classic. The acting and story is also great. There is just  something about this movie that amazes me. I've seen it over 30 times and I  still can't get enough. James Cameron is a true visionary. Kick ass Vasquez  and all hail Ripley!!!
6304500831|5.0|The Jungle book was an absolute delight from beginning to end.  Rent it or buy it you can't go wrong.

6305095566|5.0|...so thank god for Dual PAL/NTSC videos!!<br />Rockin' movie - better then all the crap 'Tounge and Cheek' Horrors that we get these days such as Scream.<br />&quot;Joooiinnnn Usssssss!&quot;
6304366086|5.0|Truly one of a kind.  You get a real sensation of the speed and danger these guys put themselves through.  The first five minutes of the film where the driver's are firing up their engines is spectacular.  If it  doesn't send shivers up your spine, then you have no soul.<br />      -Brian
6300216500|5.0|brilliant, authentic, meticulous in details - costumes, furniture, etc.  Exciting, intriguing, wholly unpredictable. And unfortunately, all too true to reality.
B000001ED1|5.0|I found my jaded views of contemporary music to be pleasantly stirred with Osborne's most recent contribution.  Strong influences of soul, but perhaps moreso of blues, come across in Joan's superb delivery.  There were times  when I could swear I was hearing Big Mama Thornton, Etta James, Lou Ann  Barton, and Janis Joplin.      The songs are delivered with passion and  poetry delved from Osborne's life experience.  Do not miss this one and  wait, like the rest of us, for the next exciting album (perhaps now out)
B000002GHH|5.0|There was a time when I used to offer various friends of mine an absolute money-back guarantee if they bought -- and didn't love -- this record. Nobody ever asked for his money back. Hiatt's the best, and my friends  aren't so bad either...
B00000DHRZ|5.0|Offspring has songs many would like. They also like to put funny things in their songs and on cover. This one it's mostly showing what America is really like (kid with brace and cockroach, song where white guy tries to  act cool but he's not). Overall a great CD for all people (well mostly all)  and it will definetly keep you listening. Offspring Rocks!!!!!!
B00000DLUV|5.0|AFTER SEEING THIS HBO SPECIAL I IMMEDIATELY PURCHASED THIS CD.  IF YOU ARE A BEE GEE FAN THIS IS A MUST FOR YOUR COLLECTION
B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt.Peppers is the first true &quot;Album&quot; is the history of music.  It's set the standard for all music to follow it.  While the beatles had written good songs before this, that's all they were, songs.  This was the  first album.  All songs connected by either music or concepts and flow with  neverending beauty like nothing before or after it's time.  The amazing  thing about Sgt. Pepper is that it was recorded on a 4 track while music  today is recorded on 48 track.  It just shows how ahead of their time the  beatles were.  Only the beatles could hold a chord for two mintues at the  end of a song and make it work like no one else.  Only the beatles could  intertwine two B-3 organs into one on &quot;Being for the Benifit of Mr.  Kite&quot; and make it work.  Only the beatles could make an album like  this.  It will never be equaled.
0783204914|5.0|A moving story about doing what is right and wrong in ones life. Al Pacino gives one of his best performances yet and his final scene will long be remembered for its passion and inspiration. One to have at home.
B000002U82|5.0|I listen to this cd so much, over and over again. All of the songs on this album are increadible.  There are no bad songs on this album.  By far the best pink floyd album.
6305120706|5.0|As one of the worlds greatest musicals, &quot;Cats&quot; has to be seen to be believed.  &quot;Cats&quot; is still running in New York (since 1982), and London (since 1980). This DVD offers closeups of the characters which  you do not see at the theater.  The sound is excellent, with a wonderful  cast, and a suprise, Sir John Mills as Gus the Theater Cat. My only  disappointment, the Siamese cats were omitted. A resounding plus for the  DVD format, lets hope we see more current/recent Musicals put on DVD.  I  have sen the DVD's of &quot;West Side Story&quot;, and  &quot;Showboat&quot;, these are Movies, &quot;Cats&quot; is not, rather it  is a recreation of the stage performance, very, very well done.
0688158234|5.0|Waris Dirie has lived a life that all can gainfrom. The victory of the Human Spirit over someobstacles that few in the Western World haveever experienced, presented in a graphic andhumble manner, will bond you to her  forever. She started as a nomadic child of the Somaliandesert, and most  likely would have lived out her life in obscurity, but fate and her  strongspirit has transformed her into a valid heroinefor our times. This is  a must read! A book youwill hand-carry to your best friends and insistthat  they read it.
0767802470|5.0|A great movie, action , well acted, good story. What more can you ask? good music too.  Plenty of nail biting scenes.  I have both versions, the Laser disc and DVD, the sound on the laser disc is bad, the DVD a vast  improvement.  This really comes across as a &quot;true story&quot;, whereas  &quot;The Hunt for Red October&quot; and &quot;Crimson Tide&quot; seem more  like great adventure stories.  I guess I like these submarine stories, why  I am not sure, maybe they are better movies.  In any case &quot;Das  Boot&quot; is really good, buy it, you will not be disappointed.
6302000823|5.0|This heart warming and sometimes humerous story of  a man and friendship is not to be missed by anyone. Individuals who are familiar with Italian culture will experience a heightened enjoyment in this one. Subtitles are  not distracting and should not pose a concern.  A wonderful story of  passion, friendship and love. The ending is truly a moving one and will  undoubtedly capture your heart. A must see!!
079213690X|5.0|This is an emotionally stirring epic that lights the fire of pride in the belly of any Scot, or persons of Scottish blood. Finally the world over will realize what real men Scots are, and that kilts are not skirts, and  bagpipes are worth listening to. Sadly, it took a hollywood rendition to  make many realize it. Anyways, Mel Gibson proves there is more to him than  Lethal Weapon.  However, being a descendant of Robert the Bruce I was  dissapointed in the inaccurate portrayal of the mighty leader.  Upon a trip  to Scotland I discovered he is just as reverred as William Wallace.  For  those who don't believe me, read King of Scots.  This historically accurate  book will introduce the reader to a man with just as much passion and raw  courage as Mel Gibson's William Wallace.  Believe me, he was not the  &quot;wimp&quot; that Braveheart made him out to be. To make a movie about  the true Robert the Bruce would have been even more provoking.
0060923989|1.0|I initially read this book because I had heard so much about it and how great it was supposed to be. Halfway through, I was sorry.  The story didn't seem to have much of a point, and I just didn't appreciate the  humor.
B000002MU3|2.0|This alblum has too much of one thing that sounds old after awhile. Specifically, there are too many songs that sound alike, with loud/fuzzy guitars and all. Melodically it is weak too. BUT it does have what I think  is one of their best songs: &quot;Bang and Blame&quot; (which is depressing  in tone, but beautiul melodically and compositionally). Overall, it needs  more variety of sound, tone, and subtlety. This is by far REM's worse  alblum. Buy the singles to the hit songs instead of the alblum and save  yourself some money.
B000003BEV|4.0|If you like psychedelic music, you will love this mess. If you are looking for the more conventional sort of hard rock that has emerged since for the Stones, look elsewhere. I, it so happens, am into this sort of thing. I  like the Stones, and I liked them when they were trying to be the Beatles  too. It's fun stuff. We miss you, Brian Jones.
B0000025QC|5.0|Andreas Vollenweider spins an intricate web of music with his harp that will ensnare your soul yet release your spirit! My absolute favorite musician!
B000001EAQ|3.0|What happened? U2 reached another peak, then panicked. Since the success of &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; they have attempted to remain cutting edge by fuzzing up everything so it sounds like industrial trash. This is a  mistake; &quot;Achtung Baby&quot; was so carefully produced it couldn't  help but be magnificent, fuzzy or not. With Pop, they decided to try  something different, but hit upon two of the most unhip influences in pop  music: continental Europe and techno. Neither has ever cut it with  mainstream rock audiences, nor does this. With something like &quot;Staring  At the Sun&quot; they come out sounding like just another nineties band  with a whiny singer, instead of U2.
0380730405|5.0|&quot;Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley....&quot; Daphne du Maurier's haunting tale of a naive young woman who cannot escape the shadow of her wealthy, older husband's previous wife, Rebecca, who was adored by  all who knew her. But in trying to overcome her feeling of inadequacy, the  young woman (who is never given a first name) finds a terrifying secret  about her beautiful predecessor. One to add to your collection.
B000003BEM|5.0|&quot;Street Fighting Man&quot; and &quot;Sympathy for the Devil&quot; are quite simply the Stones' best recordings. For the first time, they actually got a producer on board who knew what he was doing (as opposed to Andrew  Oldham and the group themselves), and the result is a frightening,  intelligent collection of blues parodies and political commentary. The use  of cheap tape recorders to achieve certain sounds is masterful. Because it  was still the sixties, the lyrics had to be smart, and they were. The  Stones come into their own here, before so soon degenerating into a loud,  grinding repetition.
B000002NJS|3.0|I have never liked Madonna that much, but when i heard the song &quot;frozen&quot; i really liked it. The cd is good except for like 3 or4 songs but i think the it is not a waste of money and its for people who  like the wacked type of music. I listen to ska and punk and rock and all  other kinds of music except for country, and classical. So go buy the  madonna cd, you might be dissapointed but you might not.
B000002UDB|5.0|&quot;Magical Mystery&quot; is a collection of film music that far exceeds the film itself, with the most brilliant singles ever recorded tacked on for good measure. The last of the Beatles' great psychedelic ventures  should never be dismissed as merely trippy, for it is intelligent,  carefully renedered, and highly imaginative work that shows what levels of  art pop music can rise to. I miss this experimental studio attitude,  coupled as it was with accessible songs and lyrics chock full of double  meanings. And, in contrast to the rampant cynicism of today, &quot;All You  Need Is Love&quot; remains a triumph.
6304806426|5.0|Amazing acting, story, scenes, music and dialogue. The movie deserved all the awards it received and more. I found rating this movie reflects one's maturity.
B000001E7L|3.0|&quot;Zombie&quot; is a terrible vocal performance, but &quot;Ode To My Family&quot; is genuine magic. (Note to a previous reviewer: winning a grammy doesn't prove a thing these days, unfortunately. The grammies went  to hell a while back.)
0964385619|5.0|I must say, Rich Dad Poor Dad is one of the best books out there.  It is a phenomenal work.  It really opened my eyes to the reasons why there is a gap between the &quot;have's&quot; and the &quot;have not's&quot;.  It is  well written, easy to read and understand.  The information it contains is  invaluable.  The bibliography at the end is a very good component of this  bok.  The suggestions will help me, and everyone, develop their financial  intelligence.
6305177473|5.0|Unbelieveably, this is the best movie of the year. I'm what you call a film buff and I watch everything that's in the movie theaters and there is no movie filled with more laughter, poise, and an unresistable score like  The Parent Trap. I didn't expect to like this movie and I ended up seeing  it 4 times in the movie theaters. It's so good I've been watching it on  video every day since I bought it. A great Christmas gift for all ages!
6300183971|4.0|I have started to read Dune about 6 times and never could get started. However found the video to be one of the best that i have ever seen.
B000003S5H|5.0|An easy continental feel. Perhaps I havebeen listening to too much BBC being that I am American, but that describes Air's Moon Safari. &quot;All I Need&quot; tempts the shy with a mellow electronic beat and alluring  vocals. You almost float to the moon listening to &quot;La Femme  D'Argent.&quot; I'll leave it to the others to describe the groove of the  Moogs, orgues, and glockenspiels, but I must comment on &quot;Le Voyage De  Penelope.&quot; I was busy surfing the net allowing the sounds to fuse with  my thoughts and the last song began. The initial note stopped me. The same  thing happened when I first heard &quot;All I Need.&quot; No wonder radio  stations do not play Air. Can't be mellow can we? Guess not with another  war underway.
B000002KYK|5.0|The end title song isn't as powerful as the real soundtrack but nearly every other tune is awesomely the best that sci-fi has to offer.      This lovely futuristic music does not ever get boring. The album is an A-list  keeper.        The &quot;Love Theme&quot; has got to be the most beautiful  song of love there is.
0800141326|1.0|For those of whose intelligence wasn't insulted enough by 'Independence Day', here comes Godzilla. Yes, I'll admit, I bought the hype and rushed out to see it the day it opened. Why can't these people use the gazillion  dollars they use on special effects and come up with a script and a plot?  Sure, it made a ton of money but did you ever meet someone who said they  liked it? The one true highlight of the film is watching French actor Jean  Reno do a dead-on Elvis impersonation. The rest is total rip-off of  Jurassic Park and every other 'good' movie out there.
0140441409|5.0|The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius is the most insightful book I have ever read. I think that young people would especially benefit from Marcus's wisdom.  His advice about how to deal with life's trials is invaluable.  He teaches that the praise or censure of others is meaningless. This is so  important to teenagers trying to discover where they belong in the world.  He teaches people to have courage in the face of adversity and to always  live their lives by the highest standard.
1572523166|5.0|I have always been a fan of David Bowie's music especially his &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; phase. After seeing this movie I was quite surprised at how well an actor Bowie was. I found the movie to be entertaining and brought  your mind to a new place.I really think it was ahead of it's time.
6301969294|4.0|I'll admit it, after reading Rand's lengthy &quot;Atlas Shrugged&quot; I was, to put it mildly, thrilled to discover the &quot;Fountainhead&quot; was made into a movie. Granted I have become a fan of Rand's, but the movie  is lacking depth. I was suprised to see it is only an hour and fifty-four  minute movie and it shows. The acting is the best as can be expected with  the task undertaken. The sets are fabulous despite the age of the film.  Loved the lighting and camera angles, but the plot was a bit dry. The  portrayal of the only female character, except for a one-liner by a  secretary (thought executives had male secretaries back then), is  excellent. Watch Patricia Neal's eyes while in the throws of depicting  Dominique- fabulous. But Dominique, though in liking to Rand's female  characters, is a tad of a melodramatist. Gary Cooper as Howard Roak gives a  fine performance. But I was more enthralled with the acrhitecture, as  probably most were when the movie was first released in 1949. All and all a  competent movie for those who are interested in testing the waters of  Rand's Objectivism, but not wanting to read the book. A cliche' but it  works. =-)
6302468027|5.0|This is the best movie I have ever had the pleasure of watching. I am very critical and tend to prefer the black and white greats. This was exceptionally written, acted, photographed and directed. My husband, who  runs from &quot;girl movies&quot; absolutely loved this outstanding motion  picture. Fanny Flag is an incredibly talented human being. Don't go through  life without enjoying this wonderful story. I have watched it over and over  and will continue to do so, wanna bring the popcorn?
B00000DFRS|4.0|there has been much debate of the merits of whitney houston's &quot;first studio album in eight years&quot;. perhaps the first thing that should be cleared up is that a studio album is an album which the artist needs to  enter the studio to produce (as opposed, let's say, to a greatest hits or a  remix package which could conceiveably be created from existing tracks).  whitney was in the studio for _the bodyguard_, _waiting to exhale_ and _the  preacher's wife_ (and received grammy nominations for this work). and, yes,  this album does go in several different directions, but what do want, a  collection of songs that sound exactly the same? and who better to flex her  vocal muscle on a variety of genres than the very able ms. houston? the way  i see it, whitney has finally captured some of the funk that she's been  chasing after for years. from &quot;it's not right but it's okay&quot; to  &quot;if i told you that&quot; to &quot;in my business&quot;, whitney  stands out as one of the few artists that can work with darkchild and  misdemeanor and emerge with her own identity in tact. and though &quot;when  you believe&quot; didn't quite live up to all the hype, one has to give it  credit for far more lyrical depth than the average feature-length animation  film theme song. and there's no denying that &quot;i learned from the  best&quot; has the potential to become the next &quot;unbreak my  heart&quot; (not surprising considering that they were both penned by diane  warren. overall, this is a very strong album which is being villified by  the public simply because they had unrealistic expectations.
B000006NPY|5.0|i think adore is much more than the other four pumpkins albums combine. I t has something that i like about it. and i like the fact that Billy Corgan didn't use any swears in any of the songs in adore, this album is something  i would recommend to my friends to buy.
079073804X|5.0|This is THE scariest movie I have ever, ever seen. This video is very shocking, and gave me nightmares of seeing the little girl in my sleep. The story is decent, and what I liked best about the film is that they pulled  out all the stops. They didn't cut out anything because of &quot;bad  taste&quot;. This is a classic, and the 5 stars I give this one too is  directly related to the fact that this is too terrifying to watch. Ironic,  huh?
B000000ITU|5.0|Recorded largely in an Irish castle, Eno and Lanois experiment with the band at its chemical peak, and the results are breathtaking.  Who can deny the raw power and beauty of &quot;A Sort of Homecoming&quot;, &quot;The  Unforgettable Fire&quot;, or &quot;Bad&quot;?  This is the album from which  all future U2 success was forged.
0792151712|1.0|Anachronistic.  Weak Dialog.  Poor Acting.  Offensive. Disgusting.  Glad I didn't buy it.  Wouldn't ever recommend it.<br />Once again the industry shows us that the Oscar is worthless, hype not art!
6301963911|5.0|It would take much more than a 1000 words to decribe how good this movie is. It is without question, i believe the funniest comedy ever made. Nothing comes close. Nothing!  In my opinion i think it's the greatest work  of art in this century(i'm not kidding) I'm still in awe of the film every  time i see it, which is well over 250 times. The directing is absolutely  brilliant. This movie was years ahead of it's time. I hear constantly about  movies such as &quot;gone with the wind&quot; &quot;citizen kane&quot; and  other classics, being heralded as the greatest movies ever. Annie hall not  only belongs in that category, i think it was the greatest film ever made.  It's so creative, it's frightening. Not ever having the opportunity, or the  desire to see this is the equivalent of someone not wanting to see moses  part the red sea. Rent it, buy it, do what ever you have to do to see this.
B000001EL3|4.0|&quot;Beth&quot;, stupid &quot;Flaming Youth&quot;, and pretentious &quot;Great Expectations.&quot; I would have expected nothing less from a band that was/is mostly hype. Destroyer does really deliver the goods in  some respects- &quot;King of the Night Time World&quot; is pretty ferocious  for 1976 KISS. &quot;God of Thunder&quot; has a generic main riff but is  elevated by Gene's decidedly demonic persona. &quot;Do You Love Me?&quot;  is always a pleaser. &quot;Shout it Out Loud&quot; is such a blatant  attempt at reaching the charts that I now cringe when I hear it.  &quot;Sweet Pain&quot; could have been a much stronger track had Gene and  the guys gone in a heavier direction instead of the poppier sound that  plagues the track. &quot;Beth&quot; never meant anything to me. I suppose  it does mean something to all those dudes whose girlfriend was named Beth.  Other than that, blech. &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, on the other hand,  is a pleasant surprise with its complex (for KISS) orchestrations. It is a  subtle (not) tale of lust that recounts the tribulations of Gene's  groupies. (Oh how my heart aches). Anyway, the crowning acheivement of  Destroyer is the undisputed heavy weight rocker &quot;Detroit Rock  City.&quot; I just hate that minute plus intro where we hear stupid dishes  clanking, radio ga-ga, and that anticlimactic collision. What KISS fan does  dishes anyway? Sans the intro bit and the annoyingly childish &quot;Flaming  Youth&quot;, Destroyer is primetime KISS kraft, even if it isn't as  musically heavy as one would have liked, or expected for that matter.  -David Newman 1998
6303824382|5.0|This is a movie which is not ashamed of what it is - a rollicking, frenzied action adventure with a tangy dash of humor and irony. I got a rush just watching this movie on the big screen. Finally, we have here a  sequel as good (if not better) then its predecessors. If you like action  movies, do not miss this one.
B00000253N|4.0|I love to listen to this album when I am kicking back with some friends.  My particular favorite tracks include &quot;Idiot Wind&quot; and &quot;If You See Her  Say Hello&quot;.  Overall the whole album is one that you can  listen to the whole way through without ever wanting to stop it.
6305169187|3.0|I enjoyed this movie largely because I am fascinated with the subject of planetary exploration and I readily bought the whole premise of blowing up an asteroid. To be honest, there were quite a few thrills. Also, the cast  is superb. In particular, I liked the performances of Buschemi, Willis, and  Affleck. Action films have tradionally been designed for male audiences.  However, much like Titanic, this film seems intent on capturing female  viewership (no sexism intended) by incorporating sentimental elements  designed to get the tears flowing, instead of by actually adding more  thoughtfullness and reality to the premise. If only the director had  watched the excellent &quot;Contact&quot; before making this...
B000009VOL|4.0|A great disc.  One that grows on you with repeated listenings...haunts you to a degree...definitely a mood disc for moments when you want to wallow.
B0000027I6|5.0|In his darkly irreverent way, this unconventional artist smacks everyone who got their opinion out of a box upside the head yet again.  This album has many layers and surprises which beg us to dig into and with each flash  of insight we find what we thought he was approving he was infact  condemning and what we thought he was condemning he was in fact approving.   Wondefrul and innovative work - and yes, it is against the stream.... but  not in the way that makes mass media &quot;alternative people&quot; happy!
B00000F1D3|4.0|If I could talk to Cher right now, I would tell her I truely like this cd. I was reading something in a magazine recently and they were reviewing Cher's new cd. I was like really, I didn't know Cher had come out with a  new cd. I was at my local record store a few days after reading the article  and saw Cher's face. I said I have got to get this cd. The CD's were out so  I settled for the tape. Man on man, am I glad I didn't wait until the next  shipment of Cd's to came in. The cd is the bomb. I even have some video  concepts thought up....surely you don't think I'm going to share them right  now. ;) But seriously, Cher rocks, the music is infectious, it makes you  want to move and sing along; I especially enjoy the vocal machine Cher is  using on some of the songs. Cool Roger Troutman meets dance/club muisc. To  Cool! I love the 70's feel to the music and can't wait to go to the club  and dance up a sweat off of some of these songs. Some people think Cher is  making a comeback, I just think she's getting better with time and want I  everyone to know....Cher's cd should be in everyone's music collection.
0553108034|5.0|Finally read Clash of Kings (Had to have it shipped to me from Europe!) and I have to say it was an excellent read. Though I won't go on to say it was better than AGOT it was still MUCH better than any sequel I have ever  read and well deserving of 5 stars. I myself read everthing from sci-fi, to  fantacy, to horror to some classical, and I must say this impressed me very  much. I read alot of comparison to other authors like Donaldson, Jordan,  Tolkien, and let me tell you Martin belongs right up with them all. <br />One  big plus that &quot;A Song of Ice and Fire&quot; has over Jordan's WoT is  that Martin's work is already pegged to last 4 books, and will not swell  into the behemoth of WoT (At least I pray he sticks to 4). Also he seems to  be able to invent women characters with more than one kind of personality  (Unlike Jordan) No other series has close to the amount of suspence that  &quot;ASOIAF&quot; has. He is not afraid to kill off a loved character or  flip the whole plot around at any time so you never know what to expect.  <br />So many series have been so predictable its nice to have no idea how  this story will end. If you dont like LOTS of interesting extra details and  a cast of hundreds however stay away. But if you want the best of the best  in epic fantay, A Song of Ice and Fire looks like it will be a winner  unless he really goofs the last two.<br />So bring on &quot;A Storm of  Swords&quot; its going to be hard to find anything that comes close to this  while I wait...sigh..
0800116917|5.0|I regret that I first saw this film on network television after it had been hideously butchered by censors.  Seeing the complete and restored work for the first time, however, was almost like seeing a different  film.<br />Much has been written about the acting, cinematography, sound  track, production and direction of this film, all deservedly praiseworthy.  I believe that all of these, however, serve to accentuate the ambivalence,  and perhaps the amorality, of T.E. Lawrence.  This film was far ahead of  its time in its portrayal of the loathing and self-doubt experienced by a  classically educated, Western man in contact with elemental nature and with  the primal savagery of war.<br />The broadly hinted at homosexuality and  sado-masochism that Lawrence was never able to come to terms with in his  written works also recur throughout this film, not as grotesquery, but  rather as one further layer of misery and conflict added to the cauldron of  war in the desert.<br />Understated in many ways, this film maintains an  amazing humanity, filled with pathos and dignity.  It is deserving of a  considered viewing.
6300151379|5.0|Why it is out of print is a mystery. It is a must see Jim Henson film for ages 5 to 105. It even has a cult following on the net because it is that enchanting of a movie.
B000005JKH|5.0|I have been a Tang. Drm. fan for quite a while and when I discovered Ricochet some years ago I was totally caught by surprise. Incredible sound : acoustic drums, guitars, and synths. You wiill want to listen over and  over again, I have. A MUST HAVE.
1558216847|5.0|I read this book in 1968.  In 30 years, I have never forgotten it.  I haven't read it since then but I can remember the loving description of one prisoner as he described how his wife made a cake and how his listeners  were nearly driven mad from the want of it.  Late 20th century Americans  have no clue what deprivation means.
6305177473|5.0|This movie was really funny.Lindsey Lohan is great. I want it for Christmas so I can watch it again.
0783217048|5.0|This movie is funny, fresh, and fabulous!  I can watch this film over and over again.  There's no beating the music, the acting.  It's too, too fierce!  It's a comedy.  It was never made to impress reviewers.  It was  made to be light and funny - and it definitely succeeds.
B00000DHR0|1.0|This album is not of what we have come to expect from the prolific Dion.  I expected lyrics and music to be as powerful as &quot;Blame it on the Rain&quot; but was merely left with an emotional chasm.  This album has  removed any happiness that once was a part of my life.  Help me.
0767805712|4.0|Gattaca is one of the smartest sci-fi-movies of the year. It's also very stylish - and unfortunately sometimes pretty boring. But when you know that this is no 'Starship Troopers', you will have a great time. Jude Law is  fantastic!
B000005IS1|5.0|I first bought this album when I was 18 in 1969. This group was just part of the political unrest of the time and they were some of the loudest. This album really captures the raw sound of rock &amp;roll, not only of the MC5,  but also of that whole era. You just don't get this type of sound with  today's synthesized, overdubbed, digital sound.
6305166021|5.0|First saw this show on PBS. Had to have my own copy. My only regret is that I did not see this show in person. The energy of Michael Flatery and his group is a joy to watch.
0780624890|5.0|First of all I do not like Wesley Snipes films. In fact I have only seen one or two of them. Though I absolutely loved this film. Great Action but bad acting. Though you could dismiss the acting with the great techno music  pumping in the background to the action scenes. Cannot wait for it on DVD!!
0887307280|4.0|I have very mixed emotions about this book. The Technicial/Manager/Entrepreneur construct is useful for understanding the owner's interaction with the business, and should be must reading for new  business owners. So, too, is the advice about defining one's own objectives  in starting a business, and casting the evolution of the business to  achieve those personal objectives.  HOWEVER, he completely loses my vote  when it comes to the rigid definition of business operation in the form of  a &quot;franchise&quot; model. In a rapidly evolving marketplace, such an  attempt is anti-Darwinian, and Darwin usually prevails.  Read the first  part of the book, by all means, then shelve it.

B00000D9TK|5.0|I have all of Celine Dion's French CD's and none of her English ones.  It is very difficult to select  &quot;A Best&quot; CD.   But this is my favorite( but the rest are very close behind).   You do not need  to  understand French to enjoy Celine, her voice is like listening to a Great  Orchestra..
B000003S0K|4.0|I was scared to buy this album for a long time. But, like the first Stooges album (another album I was scared to buy for a while because of its cover), most of my fears were completely founded. This man is a freak! He  is also one of the most incredibly creative musicians [sic] out there. Take  a listen to &quot;Dead Finks Don't Talk&quot;, and you'll hear echoes in  everything from Ween to Frank Zappa to Sid Vicious' &quot;My Way&quot;. The  man is sick. And he still scares me. Listening to this record is like being  locked inside one of those over-furnished London flats with nothing but tea  and an endless supply of LSD, with our fair Brian slowly turning the  thumbscrews. The most claustrohobic genius recording since Syd Barrett's  entire ouevre. A must have for any music fanatic.
B00000DGUG|4.0|but Alanis Morissette does prove she's no fluke.  Lyrically and musically, &quot;One&quot; is one of the most haunting songs I've ever heard.
0800136586|5.0|For those of us that grew up singing the Broadway tunes from Annie with our siblings, this movie is as Classic as they come. Carol Burnett does a great job and the whole movie takes me back to my childhood.
B000002TPS|1.0|Megadeth was at one time one of the best metal bands on Earth.  This album killed that.  The songs are weak.  The edge that made them great is gone.
B0000017CA|5.0|This is my personal favorite acid bath cd. From the first song I heard (scream of the butterfly) i was hooked. I have had this cd since it came out and I listen to it every day. Definatly a cd that will get lots of use  for you true metal fans. Scream of the butterfly is by far my favorite song  on this cd and is most of my friends favorite. IF you like this one try the  other cd, but i think this one is the best
6304813759|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time.  I know many guys who don't want to see this movie because they are strippers but it is just so funny that I didn't care. If you haven't seen this movie before you  have to! The plot is interesting and its just hilarious.
B000005S27|5.0|Love them or loath them this is a timeless piece, with strong vocals and pure pop combined perfectly. Robbie Williams steals the thunder with I Found Heaven, Could It Be Magic, and Everything Changes. Their earlier work  is more dance directed, with Do What U Like aimed at the gay society. Sure  is a US style rap which is more enjoyable the more listened to. Relight my  Fire is an all time party classic, ,and well deserved.  Back for Good is so  simple and yet so effective. Never Forget is a masterpiece of pop and well  worth it.  An all time great band encapsulated on this excellent album. Buy  today, or now!
B000002BFZ|5.0|I bought this when it was first released a couple years ago, and after a couple listenings gave up like many others. When Yield was released I reluctantly bought it with the enthusiastic endorsement of PJ fan and fell  in love with it. I also decided to give No Code another chance. It was well  worth it. This album doesn't rock nearly as hard as previous releases, and  no matter what band had recorded it, it still would've taken some getting  used to, but listening to it from beginning to end for the first time in a  while, I came to appreciate how beautiful some of these songs are,  especially (my fave) &quot;Off He Goes.&quot; You don't get the adrenaline  rush of a lot of popular music nowadays, but if you have the patience, what  you get instead, thoughtful lyrics and great musical arrangements, is far  more satisfying in the end.
6302902010|5.0|This version of Porgy and Bess is NOT the one that circulated in movie theatres and included well known stars such as Sammy Davis Jr.<br />It is long, and contains other music than you were expecting, but is faithful to  the original Gershwin.<br />We're still looking for the other version.
B00000258P|5.0|This has got to be one of floyd's best productions. Certianly, it requires an objective retrospective view of the human condition. And, it is in that light that any willing individual can truley apprecieate the immensity of  this album.
0800177975|4.0|I haven't seen the DVD version yet but I enjoyed the theater release very much (saw it twice).<br />I thought it was one of Arnold's best movies, in fact. I couldn't understand why it got such bad reviews.<br />Maybe they  missed the point of all the self-mocking sarcasm? Arnold got a chance to  relax and make some serious fun of himself and his image.<br />It's a great  fantasy, where a kid is sucked into the movie screen, into the world of his  favorite action hero movie star. And then he tries to convince the hero  that the hero's world is just a fiction in the movies.<br />Like, the hero  gets someone's phone number and the kid points out, so if this is all real,  then how come everybody's phone number starts with &quot;555&quot;?<br />And  they're in a video store and they see a poster for a movie that starred  Arnold in real life. Only in the hero's world, it starred Sylvester  Stallone, and the hero says how much he loved Stallone's performance.<br />I  really think the naysayers just missed the whole point. It really stood up  to my 2nd viewing and I will check out the DVD version soon.
B00000DHR0|5.0|I know who Celine is primarily from her work on the Titanic soundtrack, but now I have a whole new perspective!  I watched her television special and was intrigued.  I determined that I would buy her Christmas album and  have been listening to it non-stop!  Such a beautiful mix of traditional  and non-traditional music.  She had us dancing in the kitchen to  &quot;Chrismas Eve&quot;, among others.  I will definitely buy more of this  Canadian song bird's music!  What a happy Christmas present to myself this  CD turned out to be!!!
6303921248|5.0|My friend and I are both in the Navy overseas.  We have Pride and Prejudice weekends when we force all our other friends to watch this movie.  We haven't had one unhappy viewer yet.  Outstanding movie, doesn't even  seem like 6 hours!!!
B00000G3PA|5.0|Best Movie ever out! Words can't describe the experience when watching it. Pure rush.
B00000G3PA|1.0|This movie was the absolute WORST of ALL time! Completely unrealistic and just down-right STUPID! I would have given it ZERO stars but Amazon.com allows the lowest of 1 star only. Buying this DVD will be the WORST  purchase of your life, I guarantee it!
B000002897|5.0|When I received this CD as a birthday gift in 1992, I loved it so much I listened to it every day for four months after which I was able to wean myself down to a few times a week.  I picked it back up last spring and it  was every bit as wonderful as I remembered.   The voice is a very sexy  barratone and the music never fails to put a smile on my face.  At some  point or another over the years, every song on the CD has been a favorite.   I highly recommend it.
6304795254|1.0|This has to be one of the most dreadful films I have even seen. The story is absurd, the charaters are completely repusive, and the ending is an insult to anyone with an IQ exceeding that of a turnip. The only conclusion  one can draw from this film is that the director, the writer and the actors  view humanity with absolute contempt.
B000000WJZ|5.0|tremendous album.  definitely my favorite album of all time.  i love the versatility it shows.  it goes from soft, sweet songs like &quot;sweet sweet&quot; and &quot;luna&quot; to hard, energy-packed songs like  &quot;geek usa&quot; or &quot;silver****&quot;.  the versatility can be  best seen in &quot;soma&quot;, i think, since the first half is soft and  the second half kicks you in the rear.  the biggest debate that this album  causes is, what's the worst song (least superb)?  it may never be answered.
079283318X|4.0|Goldeneye compares favorably with other Bond films.  Brosnan is far better as 007 than the dreadful Timothy Dalton, (although he is no Sean Connery.) The action sequences are first rate. Famke Janssen is the best villainess  since Pussy Galore in Goldfinger. The only problem with the film is the  painfully forced performance of Judy Densch as the 1990's  &quot;feminist&quot; version of M. While Bernard Lee kept his performances  as M dignified and low key, Densch and/or the director seemed determined to  make the audience notice her. Thankfully, in Tommorow Never Dies Ms. Densch  was scarcely noticable.
B00000DHTF|5.0|Tracks is a great review of the past twenty five years Springsteen has made music.  Any true Bruce fan would appreciate this magnificent collection of hits.  Disc 2 actually has the same song, Be True and Mary  Lou, the only difference is the chorus and the music.  All other lines in  the song are exactly the same.  You can find bits and pieces of lyrics all  over these CD's that are the same lyrics that made it to some of Bruce's  more popular songs.   A trained Bruce fan can you can hear each stage in  Bruce's career.  Of course Growin' Up, Saint in the City, and Does this bus  stop at 82nd street were from Greeting from Asbury park, but if your a fan  of Incident on 52 street, you'll love Zero and Blind Terry, Seadide Bar  Song and Thundercrack.  They all have that street kid style that many of us  Bruce fans have come to know.  Lion's Den, Where the Bands Are, and I Wanna  be with You, have the good time feeling of Glory Days.  Just about all of  Disk 4 has the Better Days, Lucky Town, Ghost of Tom Joad feel to it.  I  don't know what inspired When the Lights Go Out, but somebody did something  very bad to Bruce.  Happy almost seems like a dedication to Patti.  We all  know about his other marriage, which produced Tunnel of Love and was filled  with bitterness toward love. All together though, Tracks is exciting  new(old) songs that has made Bruce want to tour again with the E Street  Band.  The Tracks songs alone could be a four hour concert, which Bruce is  so famous for.   This set is 4 hours of pure enjoyment and any fan must buy  the set before going to see him in concert.  I'll be there in the parking  lot, blaring the music, with the barefoot girls, sitting on the hood of a  dodge, drinking warm beer in the soft summer night.  See you there.
B000001Y42|3.0|Not nearly as good as KoRn, but aggressive enough for me.  They need a little polishing.  I bet the next album will be better.  I have high hopes for them.
B000002KGT|5.0|I listen to music that's from right now.I thought this cd would be boring.But I loved it the first time I listened to it.No wonder it was one of the best selling albums ever.I recommend this cd if you like great  lyrics,great instrument playing;and if you have good taste in music.
B000001DYD|5.0|What the hell is with this perpetual Patti Smith comparison?  Sure, Patti was a good poet, but in the way of musicianship (as in: memorable melodies and skillful guitar work) I never found her particularly  compelling.<br />Polly Jean, on the other hand, is (arguably) the  &quot;best&quot; female rock solo-artist of the decade.  Who else can pack  one album with so many (what is it, fourteen?) simply astounding &quot;raw  power&quot; songs, songs that epitomize rock and roll as it was meant to  be?<br />Although I'm ordinarily reluctant to list opinions on each song, it's  often quite necessary to do so on such an album: an album that is filled  with fourteen incredibly different yet similarly themed songs.  Songs that  give an album an overall atmosphere rather than seeming a melange of  demos.<br />&quot;Rid of Me&quot; - What a fantastic opening.  Beginning with  sparse guitars and impatient chants, soon exploding into an assult of  spewing words, it seems to sum up the whole album.  Followed by several  (perhaps four) rockers that (to be honest) I can't really distinguish  offhand, it's a helluva strong beginning, soon interrupted by an eerie and  often overlooked, yet entirely enjoyable, &quot;Man-Sized Sextet&quot;  (which always sounded to me a bit like the score to a &quot;Jaws&quot;  parody).  <br />And now is Polly Jean's chance to entirely destroy a classic  Dylan song.  However, when I say destroy, I say it with no negative  connotations, because, in my opinion, Bob Dylan needs more insolence (if  you call it that) than an electric distorted punked-out version, a version  to just spit back in his face what he spit into the faces of his audience  when he himself disappointed his purist folkie fans by going electric.   (And anyway, whose voice really sounds better, PJ's or Bob's?)<br />And now  (applaud!) Polly blesses us with some of her most enormously (literally)  enjoyable songs of the album:  the booming and all-mighty &quot;50 Ft  Queenie&quot; and amps-turned-up-all-the-way &quot;Yuri-G&quot;.<br />Toward  the end of our journey through the psyche of this enraged young woman,  another coupla fabulous songs come along, including &quot;Me-Jane&quot;,  which I like alot for no particular reason, and &quot;Ecstasy&quot;,  perhaps my favorite song on the entire disc because of its simply lyrics  and thousand-decibel, overdriven/distorted flanger-full guitar celebration,  a song whose happy juxtaposition of the repeated lyric &quot;I'm in  ecstasy&quot; and the dark, crashing, and soaring guitars make it all the  more fabulous.<br />Get off the stage, Patti; go write us another book.  When  we want music, we'll call on PJ.<br />And I won't tack a pretentious and  blatant &quot;highly recommended&quot; or any of that bullshit onto the end  here; you read the description, you decide if such a record is worth the  fourteen bucks.
B000002I6V|5.0|A variety of song styles linked by thoughtful lyrics, Graham Nash's &quot;Songs for Beginners&quot; is pure poetry floating in musical clouds.  Every song is a glimpse of humanity - at it worst and best, and sung with a  rawness of youthfull yearning for truth and perfection.  All are elegant in  their simplicity.  Each song rips a hole into your brain and lingers there.   You'll want to fill that space again and again with this album.
B0000057C5|5.0|I almost got this CD like, 9 times. I listened to it a few months ago, and I knew I liked it, but I'm so glad to have finally bought it. It is so great. They are geniuses. I like &quot;Tier&quot; the best, and  &quot;Stripped&quot;.
B000002H6C|5.0|This is my favorite album of all time.  Very few bands can put it together like metallica can.  I know what you are thinking: Metallica can't write worth a damn anymore.  But you are wrong. They still can, but the chose to  sell out and write commercially acceptable music so they could line their  pockets.  In doing this, they turned away more fans than they will ever  know.    Now about the album.  This is some of the most technically  challenging music written by a metal band, period. Listen to the dual  guitar after the solo in &quot;One&quot; or the fast interlude in  &quot;Frayed Ends Of Sanity&quot;, and you'll know what I'm talking about.   And the solos are amazing.  There is really no other word for them.  And  the intense riffing behind them only heighten the whole feel of the songs.   Aside from the guitar work, the drumming is phenominal. I've never heard  drumming so fast, intense,  and just plain angry on an album.  And it  doesn't stck out, either.  It blends perfectly with everything else.  Aside  from the obvious (this album just kicks arse), the thing that really gets  me about it is the length of the songs.  They are all at least 5 1/2  minutes long (the longest being just under 10), and the don't get boring,  which is very hard to do. They put so many riffs into one song that it  would be wrong for the songs to be any shorter.    This is the finest  effort metallica has ever came forth with, and it is to bad tht they had to  succomb to the all mighty dollar, when continuing to write like this would  have brought them all the money they ever needed.
B000002HMH|1.0|The worst Metallica CD made until of course Re-Load.  Both of these CDs are not what true heavy metal / Metallica fans want to hear.  I am truely let down and don't know if I will ever buy another Metallica CD after this  major disappointment.
B000003TB6|5.0|This album should be dipped in platinum because this album is so hot! Black Thought is without a doubt one of the best lyricists ever to come on the scene.  Malik B brings great rhymes to the table as well.  The Roots  are definetely making a statement in hip-hop.

B000002UZ1|5.0|Greatest hits collections are akin to looking at coffee table art books: while they give you a sense of the painting, the pictures are just reproductions and can never capture the true impact of the original work,  nor  the textures, scope and feel of the painting.<br />That said, the Blue  album does make a decent attempt to capture the Beatles during one of their  most productive, influential periods. The sound isn't noticably better than  the previously issued cds, but on some of the Sgt. Pepper tracks this cd  allows for better isolation of the individual tracks without the  &quot;links&quot; or transitions intruding making it perfect for random  play on your cd player.<br />The cd booklet is better than most of the other  Beatles reissues as they feature photos not found with the original 1973  issue of the album. The lyrics are also provided duplicating the original  inner sleeves for the lp's.<br />Most of the albums and singles are pretty  well represented, although both THE WHITE ALBUM and ABBEY ROAD are short  changed compared to Pepper and MMT. Like the Red album, this cd could have  been better programmed; the additional running time of the cd isn't used to  any great advantage.<br />The addition of some essential album tracks would  have been welcome(particularly Lennon's loopy &quot;Hey Bulldog&quot; which  is still consigned to the oblivion of the YELLOW SUBMARINE soundtrack--the  Beatles album least likely to be owned by fans). Also, most of the medley  for ABBEY ROAD could easily have been included. To make this collection  complete(now that the anthology series has been issued)the next reissue  should include the flawed Beatles classics &quot;Free as a bird&quot; and  &quot;Real love&quot;.<br />The collection features  some of the best  collaborative and solo compositons by John and Paul. George is also very  well represented with some of his best compositions(including the tounge in  cheek b side &quot;Old brown shoe&quot;)<br />Altogether, a good album but,  like that coffee table art book, it'll never truly capture the essence of  the band's art. You need to have the albums for that.good album but,  like that coffee table art book, it'll never truly capture the essence of  the band's art. You need to have the albums for that.
1878424114|1.0|Chopra is a master of nice-sounding feel-good rhetoric that means absolutely nothing.  He paints a bright picture of the universe and tells people things they like hearing--which goes a long way toward explaining  his success--but when all is said and done Chopra has done little more than  make tons of completely unsupported claims.
0792839730|5.0|If you can accept that the good-guys don't always finish first, this is an epic WW2 movie. <br />Germans speak german, English speak english, Americans speak amer.... eh sort of english. Authenticity is the key for this movie,  German tanks are not Shermans painted over. <br />Video quality is good, sound  is lacking when compared to more recent movies. For the history or ww2 buff  this is one to definitely buy on DVD, Oh by the way, did I mention the  fantastic cast?
B0000057C5|5.0|I first listened to Rammstein in this year presentation of the MTV Europe Music Awards. I was astonished by their performance and their song. So I talked to a friend and he gave me a tape with some of their songs recorded.  I bought their 2 CD's the day after. I think Senhsucht is better then  Herzeleid, their first album, as the songs remind me more of the good old  Industrial bands, such as Laibach and Neubeuten. If you are an Industrial  fan or simply like music that really kicks ass, go ahead, give yourself a  gift and buy Sehnsucht and Herzeleid. You'll love it !
6305177473|5.0|It is by far one of the best movies I have ever seen!  It will make you laugh and cry guaranteed.  I found myself tearing up in several parts.  This is a movie to own for sure!
B000002UYZ|5.0|A fine collection that manages to capture the essence of the Beatles' songwriting craft in their singles, but short changes on the album tracks from their best album REVOLVER. This collection, not surprisingly, veers  towards the commerical side of the band. Surprisingly, Capitol didn't take  advantage of the extended time found on cds to include additional key album  tracks(both discs clock in at less than 70 minutes combined).<br />The  packaging is quite good(in fact better than most of the Beatles cd's  issued) with lyrics and photos. The packaging could have been more complete  with insights from the surviving band members about the overall mood this  collection evokes(everything else about these songs seems to have been  discussed, but the feeling the band has now listening to these tracks in  retrospect).<br />George, although he didn't have any a or b side singles  during this time, is not well represented. While John and Paul were the  driving force of the band early on, some of George's  compositions(&quot;Don't bother me&quot;, &quot;If I needed someone&quot;,  &quot;Taxman&quot;)are some of the finest album tracks on their respective  albums. <br />Emi if you're listening when you reissue this, I'd suggest the  additon of the previously mentioned tracks by George, &quot;And your bird  can sing&quot;, &quot;She said, she said&quot;, &quot;For no one&quot;(one  of Paul's finest songs)and &quot;Tomorrow never knows&quot;. Additionally,  a better selection from one of the band's finest albums, A HARD DAY&quot;S  NIGHT, would be appreciated. <br />Overall, not a bad collection but not the  best representation of the band(a similiar flaw exists with The Blue  album--The White album isn't represented as well as it should be).
0553213105|2.0|The common comment on this book, seems to be people's love for the ... &quot;love&quot; story. Mr Darcy, and Elizabeth, how great it is to see them together. Howevor Jane Austin is not a Romantic novelist. Her intent  was to criticize her generation. She was in a way, poking fun at people's  prejudice. This book is actual considered an &quot;ironic comedy.&quot; The  comedy I can not see, but the irony is definately blinding. The part of  this book that bothers me, is not so much within the book itself, but the  point of the book. If someone was truly in hatred of their society,  noticing the flaws relentlessly, why spend 62 chapters of their life,  writing about it? I personally felt that this book, could be summed up in  less than four pages, with the same amount of content being delivered, the  same lessons being learned.
B000002G26|5.0|I have been listening to Bryan Adams since his first record.  This CD of his his greatest hits is the best!!!
B00000D9TK|5.0|It appears that Celine really puts her heart into this work.  The music is addictive; the kind you want to listen to again and again and the lyrics are crisp and clear.  It seems she's in her element singing in French.  I  especially loved L'abandon and Je crois toi.  This is a must have for  Celine Dion fans.
B000002WPI|2.0|Wu Tang brings out the super honky in everyone.  I mean it is so fhat its bigger than a honkasaurus.  Once I started listening to this music I started drinking orange tang instead of kool aid. Yo man if you want to be  down with the king you got to buy this disco compacto, thats spanish for  I'm a honkey, and be prepared for the zangy, tangy super honk experience.  Peace out my Tangy Clan
630349255X|5.0|An absolute stunner.  Speaks in volumes of the beauty and the horror of the world around us without a word of dialogue.  I sat there speechless 5 minutes after it was over.  The 70 mm film produces crystal clear images,  combined with a lush soundtrack.  This film is cinematic LSD; completely  intoxicating, a tour de force on the senses.  Absolutely beautiful  filmmaking.
B000001E7T|3.0|I must admit that P.J. Harvey is a  talented lyricist and don't get me wrong,... I like her style.  But this CD is in my pile of trade-ins.  It had loads of potential but the poor sound quality and downright goofy  percussion make it sound like it was recorded in someone's poorly equipped  garage.  I thought I was going to love this CD but I was gravely  dissappointed.
6305232660|3.0|If you are looking for your typical disaster film, you may as well pass on Deep Impact. I am not trying to imply it is a bad film, because it is not. The character development is good considering the overall plot line of the  story. You will not walk away from this film raving about the fantastic  special effects; they were good, and what I perceived as quite realistic,  but not spectacular. The acting was quite good overall. Duvall, Freeman and  the rest of the cast provide believable rolls, and decent performances. It  does not provide tons of action and outrageous or bizarre heroic  personalities to keep fans of this genre totally satisfied. If you are  looking for a little more dramatic and interpersonal perspective, you will  not be disappointed. Deep Impact provides a more thoughtful view of how  people cope with disaster, not the disaster itself. It portrays people  dealing with their own impending demise as well as the rest of mankind. Who  and what means the most to them when the end is coming. That how you die  sometimes is equally as important as how you lived. This makes you think,  and that's more than most of the &quot;brain candy&quot; out there does.
B000002H48|5.0|I owned the original 3 record set on vinyl and wore it out. I have been waiting for this to be released on CD since they announced it a few years ago. I was worried that they had shelved the project. Many great  performances, but those who stand out are the Doobie Brothers, James  Taylor, Tom Petty, Crosby, Stills and Nash and of course what I consider  one of the greatest live performances ever recorded in the history of rock  and roll, Springsteen's \\"Detroit Medley\\". I think I have  seriously damaged my hearing by listening to this many times over at the  volume turned up to 11. I have a VHS copy of the movie too, and I wish  they would release it on DVD. In the movie, Bruce has a version of  \\"Thunder Road\\" with the E Street band going all out. If you  recall, the version released on his live box set was just vocals and piano.  Also in the movie is the great performance of Gary U.S. Bond's  \\"Quarter to Three\\" where Bruce \\"passes out\\" and has to  be revived by the band. Buy this CD now!!!!!!!
B00000DBXL|2.0|Was &quot;Fashion Nugget&quot; a fluke? This formulaic, food-processed followup sure makes it seem that way. What's more irritating than the mind-numbing repetitiveness of standard Cake ingredients (that thundering  bass, that echoey voice, those edgy staccato guitar riffs--all of which  worked so well on past albums) are the obnoxious &quot;Oh-Nos!&quot; and  &quot;He'yahs!&quot; that punctuate the trumpet solos on each song except  for the third. It's like sticking Twinkies in the middle of a Ho-Ho:  redundant and tasteless. This album is Cake extruded into a Dixie Cup, to  make a mock cupCake. What recipe were they following? How many cavities  will they cause? At least one--in my wallet. I wish I'd read my review  before I bought the album.
B00000DHR0|5.0|A true classic...to the pathetic few, who had no good to say, go back to your sad, empty negative lives, and don't bother to comment, ok?
B000003CMB|3.0|I began listening to this album in 1972 while was in the navy stationed in Sandiego, Ca. We would sit on the edge of the dock and listen for hours and hours.  Simply the best headphone music in the history of the world!<br />Now  27 years later Fillmore East is still my favorite of all of my 500+  albums.... I am a Northener who wishes he was &quot;American by Birth and  Southern by the grace of God&quot;. Long live the Bros....
6305127638|3.0|The Enterprise E is outstanding but the movie itself could have used a lot more work.  The graphics were good, but the plot and storyline were questionable.  Overall, It wasn't too good, and I would still rather see  Independence Day.
B0000067L2|2.0|Cream, why do think they called themselves Cream?  Because they were the &quot;cream of the crop&quot; musically speaking.  What else can be said of Clapton, one of the top 3 guitar players of all-time, but throw in the best  drummer ever without a doubt, Ginger Baker and great bass guitar player and  very good singer, Jack Bruce and you truely have perfection.<br />I had  &quot;Sunshine of your Love&quot; played as the first song at my wedding in  1986. If any of the non-talented musicians of the 1990's could even come  close to Disraeli Gears they would be bigger than Elvis! I have listened to  this album for 28 years and it still gives me goosebumps!!!!
0792836634|5.0|Really Good!  Great!  I loved it.  The plot was a little stretched but it was pretty good.
0399143904|5.0|When I first heard that there was a new Tom Clancy novel out, I was very excited. I have read all of Mr.Clancy's novels and have never been disappointed yet. Right from the start Rainbow grabs you and does not let  go. As usual the story paints a broad picture and is rich in detail. I lost  quite a bit of sleep because I refused to put it down. It has all the  hallmarks of a Clancy Classic. Bravo Mr.Clancy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002UW1|4.0|So it's not AFTP. It's still the CD that catapulted R.E.M. into the mainstream, and it's worth buying for that alone. Regardless of how you feel about that, Document is still a good CD. The guitar work on this album  is the best Peter Buck has ever done, [ On Monster there was noise, but on  Document there is finesse. ] and the horns on &quot; Exhuming McCarthy  &quot; and &quot; Fireplace &quot; add to the angry atmosphere of this  album. Make no mistake, the band is clearly angry at the events of the  times [ 1987 ]. After this, you feel energized. I have passed many a  tedious work day by humming the  &quot;Finest Worksong &quot; to myself.  Even the vocals feel delivered with spite, and it works. Not their absolute  best effort, but defiently worth a lot of listens.
B000002WPI|5.0|I've heard a lot of rap albums, and none come close to touching this one.  The fury, anger, musicianship, kung-fu interludes, and everything else this group brings to the table are unmatched.  I am a huge Wu-Tang fan, and I  had this album before most people knew they existed.  Now they hear Wu-Tang  Forever, and love it, but this is the real stuff!!!!  Buy it now, you won't  regret it!!!!!
630512065X|5.0|I have seen CATS performed in the theatre 3 times now, the last being this year in Seattle, WA., USA.  I love the performance and am so happy now that I can view an excellent version at home anytime I want!  This filmed, only  no-audience version is excellent, and while it can't replace the thrill of  being at the theatre, it does let you pause for snacks anytime you need to!   The price is right and costs much less than the $106.00 I paid for a pair  of tickets to the theatre!  GET THIS VIDEO, AND RELIVE THE MAGIC OF ANDREW  LLOYD WEBER'S WONDERFUL CREATION THAT IS CATS!  :]
B00000ADG2|5.0|I am a very conscious minded sister and when L-Boogie dropped the lyrics for &quot;That Thing,&quot; to me she just put it all on point for my brothers and sisters (black, green or white).  I don't have any kids, but  &quot;To Zion&quot; deeply touched my heart, as well as, many of the other  tracks on the CD.  The sister is undoubtley the BOMB in keeping it real and  putting it all in perspective.  I must give a big THANK YOU to Lauryn for  satisfing my hunger for the knowledge, wisdom and talent she projected on  this album. Because of her I have  learned to &quot;define my own  destiny.&quot;  But the last track (#16) is ultimatley my favorite.  Peace  and Blessings Lauryn to you and yours.
0792151712|3.0|I can agree with this movie getting the award for Best Picture.   The special effects were outstanding, the box office take was even better and, let's face it, something doesn't get that popular by people just wanting to  pay $8 for a small soda and some Junior Mints.  But it was...lacking.<br />If  a movie is going to be called &quot;The Best Film of All Time&quot; it has  to have all the elements.  Let's go down the list, shall we?<br />1.)  ACTORS/ACTRESSES: They have to be able to make you believe that they are  who they say they are.  Whenever I think of Humprey Bogart I think of him  as a gin-joint owner in Casablanca.  He's just that good.  I couldn't  believe that Leonardo DiCaprio was a homeless globetrotter.  I just  couldn't buy it.  Kate Winslet was much more believeable as the Poor Lil'  Rich Girl, but an American accent just doesn't suit her.  <br />2.) PLOT: Much  like &quot;Apollo 13,&quot; this is a difficult movie to make because the  audience already knows (or SHOULD know, God help us) what is going to  happen.  Cameron uses special effects to keep the audience's attentions  and, granted, he does this well.  Sweeping camera shots of the Titanic on  her maiden voyage are incredible, and well worth the price of admission.   But, like so many others have said, you have to have more than just a  sinking ship.  So Cameron pens this story of two star-crossed lovers, etc.,  etc., ad nauseum.  They were cute, but they just didn't have the appeal of  Hepburn and Tracy.  There was nothing in Rose that would make me believe  she would fall for Jack; likewise, there was nothing in Jack that would  make me believe he'd fall for Rose.  There was no spark.  No lightning  bolts.  No magic.  Just an iceberg, and that just isn't enough.<br />3.)  SCRIPT: &quot;Jack!&quot; &quot;Rose!&quot; &quot;Jack!&quot;  &quot;Rose!&quot; &quot;Jack!&quot; &quot;Rose!&quot;  I should be a  screenwriter.<br />So, while I was impressed with the movie as a whole, I  wasn't bowledover by it. There were to many &quot;buts&quot;--it has great  special effects, BUT the script was pretty bad.  The main characters were  pretty eye-candy, BUT they didn't draw me in.  Better luck next time...I  have to be going, &quot;Rear Window&quot; is on and I wouldn't want to miss  a REAL classic.
B000002MP2|5.0|This is green day's best album ever.  Nimrod is close but dookie is better.  Alter-punk-ska?? ROCK ON TODD! <br />PUNK IS NOT DEAD
B000002JAX|3.0|Peyroux is gifted, to be sure. Yet, like several other promising newcomers to this genre, she seems content to walk the beaten path. True genius doesn't lie in imitation; it demands risk. If Peyroux hopes to move beyond  the sounds-like-Billie comparisons and establish her own musical territory,  she'd best begin taking us on paths less traveled. We have Billie, and have  no need of another. After giving Dreamland a spin, I'm still waiting to  hear what Madeleine has to offer.
B000003Z12|5.0|Neal is the former JOURNEY guitarist! He has definitely matured since his JOURNEY days as have we all! This is one of my favorite CD's! You will not be able to stop yourself from jamming along on your &quot;air guitar&quot;  or imagining yourself watching the sun set over the ocean with this  powerful mood  setting CD.Once you hear any of these tunes you will  recognize the master guitarist NEAL SCHON. I can't tell you enough how much  I love this CD! Enjoy!
B000003TBP|5.0|1996 was one of the best years in popular music ever. The Smashing Pumpkins' absolute MASTERPIECE &quot;Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness&quot; was reaching it's peak. Everclear's &quot;Sparkle and  Fade&quot; amazed everybody (even though it's follow-up was even BETTER).  Of Squirrel Nut Zippers' &quot;Hot&quot; was realeased, a breath of fresh  air in a world of synth-techno crap and cheesy Bush and Nirvana rip-offs.    Then, of course, there was Beck's &quot;Odelay&quot;.   I didn't think it  could get any better (or funnier) than &quot;Mellow Gold&quot;, but it did!  This is about 50 years worth of popular (and unpopular) music and street  culture crammed onto one disc. Distorted, noise-drenched punk-rock guitars,  funky breakbeats and dusty turntable scratching, steel guitars, banjos,  ray-gun synthesizers, jazzy bass, assorted percussion, vintage 60s pump  organs, pounding drums, nonsensical, often funny lyrics (&quot;you can't  lose in your razor blade shoes&quot;), and the strangest samples you've  ever heard (who's sampled Mr. Cool and Haydn all in the same song?) are all  on this CD, just to name a few. You can breakdance, mosh, swing, or even  just relax with this album. It's the ultimate party record.
B00000DHTF|4.0|The songs span his entire career.  It's interesting to see how he has developed through the years.  I thought I had heard all Bruce had to offer; it's nice to know that after hearing this box set that now I have heard it  all and still love it.
6300183971|2.0|This movie did have some redeaming factors, but it isn't really worth the effort of sitting through it.  I've heard that you either love this movie, or you hate it, and I think I may be one of the latter. If you really want  an enjoyable experiance, read Frank Herbert's book, which is definately  more worthwhile than this!
6302413931|5.0|This film is my all-time favorite.  I've seen it dozenz of times and I still see something new each time.  A great cast, and a great director make a winning combo.  Even though it is set during the Vietnam war, it is not  actually about the Vietnam war.  It is Francis Ford Coppola's rendition of  Joseph Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; which is a look into a man's  soul.  It may be just for me, but after so many times, the bridge scene  towards the end actually becomes quite humorous.
0767802470|5.0|This film is presented in 1.85 anamorphic and letterbox. It is one of the best movies for 16:9 television demonstrations.  The 1.85 anamorphic side is very close to 1.78 (16:9).
6304675348|5.0|I great movie with everything that makes a horror movie worth seeing and jokes!  Neve Campbell is amazing
B000001EPB|5.0|I think that Michael and Ronan have done a great job on this soundtrack....the Video was great and the soundtrack is just as well done...a must have!!
0399143904|1.0|The story while rather mediocre and most unbelievable could have been told in 200 pages or less.
0790729377|4.0|The utter effulgence of Brando's portrayal of the brash, uncouth Stanley was somehow overlooked by the critics. His natural charisma and sexual magnetism is overwhelming. Other than this oversight, the film was richly  rewarded with many well deserved Oscars including Best Picture and a Best  Actress award for Vivian Leigh's wrenching and pleasingly theatric  submission as Blanche.  The primative environs of New Orleans set the  foreboding mood of the story well.
B000005JXG|5.0|I own every Pogues album and I have to buy this one again. . .this is by far my favorite.
6300181464|5.0|Ever wonder what the future holds for mankind at  the rate we're going?  For a movie made in 1972, this seems to me a frightening glimpse into a future we don't want to see.  Are we really that far from something like  this?  Storyline... excellent!!!  Special effects...WOW!!!   Not some dumb  space &quot;shootemup&quot;.  Along with Planet of The Apes, and FEW  others, this is a movie for people who really THINK about our actions and  the future consequences.
B00000AFFF|5.0|As with all Elvis albums I find this one  a delight. In the 1982 I heard EC sing &quot;I just dont know what to do with myself&quot; a Burt / Hal David song although In a 16 year search for a recorded version of that  song.I have repeatedly played the song in my mind. So when I heard thet EC  &amp;BB were working together it was a dream come true....The album is  entertaning as if  it was a pop album but the flip is the dsrkness and  dispar that Elvis brings to the words to make it oh so real. This album has  made me really apreciate the work of Mr Bacharac I realy only know him from  those &quot;Dry Sack &quot; comercials (with Angie Dickenson) I highly  recomend this album !!!!!!!!!!
0783229526|1.0|Hunter S. Thompson was a major figure in the  70's.  His original publications in Rolling Stone helped draw together a counter culture.  This film, however, is nothing.  Zilch. Zero.<br />If a 0 was a choice, then this  movie deserves a 0.  There is no redeeming value.  Social or otherwise.   <br />The man whose life became immortalized in Doonesbury, here turns into a  cartoon character drawn by a drunken idiot.  Perhaps that was Hunter's  life.  But as a movie it is unwatchable.<br />Save your money.  Chug a bottle  of booze.   And sit with your head in a toilet.  You'll be more highly  entertained than watching one moment of this film.
079073804X|5.0|WOW, this is my fav film and it will stay like this for ever! The tale of possesion that shocked millions. COOl but be careful a film like this can Fu** you up!
B000002KM6|5.0|There is really no better rock album that came out of the 1980's than this. Edward Van Halen makes it very clear, with one listen, that he is a true musical genius. When listening to songs like 'Dirty Movies',  'Unchained', and 'Mean Streets', it will definitely make you think, 'Man, I  wish I could play guitar like that!'
B000001ESF|5.0|&quot;2112&quot; is way up there with such classic rock opuses as King Crimson's &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man,&quot; Yes' &quot;Roundabout,&quot; Pink Floyd's &quot;Shine On You Crazy  Diamond,&quot; and ELP's &quot;Karn Evil 9.&quot; This is simply one of the  greatest classic rock albums ever. &quot;Passage to Bangkok&quot; is an  excellent follower, and the entire album is filled with the very best of  Rush. Lee, Lifeson, and Peart are an amazing trio of song-writing talent.  Epic lyrical storytelling with immense and powerful instrumentals that are  neither boring nor unnecessary. Ever note carries &quot;2112&quot; into the  pages of rock and roll history. Put simply, this is a masterpiece album  that anybody who loves good classic rock and roll should own.
6302541743|5.0|Everything everyone's said already goes double for me. Whenever I feel down, I can watch Fawlty Towers and it brings me up instantly. John Cleese should win the Nobel Prize for television.
B00000DATR|4.0|Maybe not quite as good as TB2, but still stunning. Mike's abilities never cease to astound.  Some Spanish influence here, with a beautiful keyboard interlude that's dreamy. The last track will send shivers up the spine of  any Oldfield fan.
6300246787|5.0|I loved Hello Dolly! Barbara did a fantastic job. But I'd have to disagree with a viewer from Drexel Hill,PA.  Tommy Tune never worked for Hoarce, it was indeed played by Micheal Crawford, as the tallest of the two workers.   Tommy Tune played the love interest of the niece.  The music and dancing  was awesome.
6303921248|5.0|I have always loved the older version of Pride &amp; Prejudice and read the book to get the full story.  When I saw this version, I felt that it followed the book nicely.  The actors do a wonderful job and I felt right  in with the story.  I even convinced my husband to watch it and that was a  miracle.  He felt that it was long but very much worth it when he  understood the language.
0553274503|5.0|I am 12 years old and I have just read flowers for algenon. This novel touched me like none other I have ever read. I recommend this book for all ages from 1-100. A very special story.
6303430570|5.0|From the characters to the jokes to what happens in the storyline, everything made me laugh until I thought I couldn't breathe anymore. I loved the characters such as Dante, Randal, Jay, and Silent Bob. The  storyline with Dante's love life had twists and turns that I found very  laughable. And Silent Bob's quote was the best. If you're in the mood for a  profound comedy, make Clerks your selection.
6304806434|5.0|Con Air was a really fun movie, it had violence, laughs, and pleanty of action. It is NOT a rascist like some other idiots may have said, and it isn't serious or realistic. If your just in the mood for a fun movie. . .   BUY THIS MOVIE
B00000BKJA|5.0|Magnifique album dans la ligne musical Belle et Sbastien avec peut-tre une zeste de John Lennon (probablement certain airs de Rubber Soul et une certaine similitude dans la voix de Jonathan Donahue),  de plus pour les  amateurs d'ditions collector, magnifique pochette acompagne de divers  surprises...Enfin j'ai trouver un lointain lien parent avec The pale  Fontain (album PACIFIC STREET)Enfin  vous de juger.
6301934229|5.0|Not for the faint of heart, this is one of the best suspense/psychological thriller I've ever seen.  A must have for devotees of Rutger Hauer, one of the most overlooked talents of the past few decades.  His performance as  John Ryder is utterly convincing.
0792151720|5.0|TITANIC is the best movie ever. I had a chance to go to the studio where the movie was made. I got to meet people who were in the movie. Go on the sets of TITANIC. I am a big fan of the TITANIC. I am mostly in the real  ship. I study it in books, and I got the newspaper from when the TITANIC  sunk.
B000001EAQ|2.0|I used to remember when U2 meant something, when their lyrics were inspiring and the music was innovative.  Sadly, it appears that they are more concerned with making fun of themselves and the music industry than  coming up with good music.  Though there are a couple of catchy tunes ('Do  You Feel Loved, If God Would Send His Angles'), I think this album pales in  comparison to their earlier work.  Hopefully they will get off this dance  kick.  So many other bands do it better.
6300182770|2.0|This movie is really stupid.  I bought it because I'm a huge fan of Debbie Harry's.  This movie is like, wicked slow.  I got soooooo bored, Debbie's not even on the screen 99% of the time.  If you like Cronenburg, I suggest  that you DO ADD THIS FLIM TO YOUR COLLECTION, for I think if you're into  blood, gore, and tons of nudidy, this is O.K.  If you're like me, and a  Debbie Harry, Sonja Smiths, or James Woods fan, I think you should just  rent it, and see how you like it.  But if you want it NOW, this movie is  alright to buy, I guess.  <br />RATED R, LOTS OF NUDIDY, and the movie revoles  around a new &quot;underground&quot; TV show, in which these men in black  leather, wipe and kill naked women, chained to a clay wall, so don't watch  this if you can't handle that WEIRD stuff.
B000002KBH|5.0|this album is the essence of The Dead. If you want  a Dead CD, buy this one. It is up at the very peak of Grateful Dead work.
076780421X|5.0|There is so much to this video.  The scenery shows a part of the beautiful town of Las Vegas that no one ever sees.  In addition the soundtrack is A+.
B000002GGO|5.0|All things arc.  Stars start as debris and end as debris, and somewhere in the middle they burn ever so bright.  Sparkle in the Rain is when Simple Minds are at their brightest.  It finishes what New Gold Dream started.   Just genius.  Plain and simple genius.
6303332609|5.0|I really love this movie, not because it is a very good movie but since it is so cool and unbelievable that it makes you laugh, a lot.<br />Buy it now, even though it is in Spanish.
B0000024JN|4.0|I have all five albums from the Beastie Boys, and all of them are great.  &quot;Hello Nasty&quot; is the CD of 1998.  However, if I had to pick the best of the five they've put out, &quot;Licensed To Ill&quot; is definitely  their best one.  On this particular one, the Boys knew how to rock, rap,  and roll from the beginning.  On top of that, they're loud and obnoxious  which is why this CD is a classic!
6300181464|3.0|This movie was made with the 1970's counterculture in mind.  An eco-science fiction film, Bruce Dern plays an ecological nut-case who present viewers with the fears that our world will end if we don't take  care of it.  The robots are cool, effects decent, but the songs by Joan  Baez are horrible, and have no place in this film.
0792153189|5.0|this movie was excellent!!!  It deserves all 5 stars.  It may not be as great as Armageddon, but the graphics and such were compelling.  I didn't even get up to go to the bathroom!
6305232660|2.0|for a blockbuster its marginal at best. more focus should have been paid to the comet.and its devastation after impact, duvall and freeman soild efforts. rest of cast forgetable!!!!!!!!!
0792151712|5.0|This movie is sooo good.  James Cameroon did an excellent job of recreating the Titanic.  I saw it 3 times and I cried everytime.  This was a really good movie.
B000002J09|5.0|The original album is the first Zeppelin CD I bought.  Plant, Page, Bonham, and Jones deliver some of their best stuff ever.  Jimmy Page's chords are magical as usual, Plant's lyrics are second to none.  He really  belts out the words that penetrate through the soul of the listener.   Bonham is his usual drum pounding self.  If I were to recommend any  Zeppelin CD this is the one to buy.  If an individual really wants to get a  sense of what Zepelin is like at the very hardcore.  Here it is.
6301790170|5.0|William Friedkin, the award-winning director of The French Connection and The Exorcist, saw his career plummet after making Sorcerer, arguably the best film of his career. Part of the problem was the studio's misleading  marketing of the film. The mass audiences that flocked to Friedkin's  earlier crowd-pleasers were dismayed by Sorceror's complex development --  the story moves from continent to continent, from one language to another,  and begins with a lengthy and mysterious prologue that makes sense only  much later. Sorceror has the feel of a foreign film, almost a documentary,  and was too demanding for impatient American moviegoers. Sorceror is even  better than Henri-Georges Clouzot's Wages of Fear, the excellent 1953  French film that inspired it. Friedkin's work is a masterpiece of cinematic  storytelling, with hair-raising crises, sensational visuals, and fine  acting all around. Much will be lost if you see this cropped on a small  screen; wait until you can get it in letterbox.
0380002930|5.0|This book is great fiction -- it takes you out of your world and transports you to the fictional one the author has created so well that you remember the characters for years afterwards ... and they're RABBITS!<br />My  dad read this book to me aloud when I was a kid (8-9 years old) and I liked  it because I loved rabbits.  Re-reading it as an adult, I picked up on the  philosophical commentary on life that the author weaves (skillfully) into  the story and enjoyed it even more.
0790736942|4.0|Twenty five years and countless reviews later, The Exorcist still has the power to de-stabilize most people who feel they have delt with the issues  that the film raises, namely demonic possesion. If you are of a nervous  disposition or are not sure if you believe in the forces of darkness  BEWARE!!!<br />          Natasha Osuna
6304510861|5.0|American audiences are so used to being spoon-fed the same crap in movies that movies like Lost Highway are rejected by audiences because they don't have a plot that a second-grader could understand. Yes, the plot in Lost  Highway is very difficult to follow, no matter how smart you are. You'll  definitely have to watch it several times to catch all the  intricacies.<br />Some problems with it.. the first hour of the film was  horrendously boring. David Lynch could have easily shortened the film by  30-40 minutes if he cut out all the scenes with Pullman staring blankly  into nothing.  <br />I was grateful for all the sex and nudity, too. Finally a  director has the guts to make a movie with *gasp* promiscuous sex in it.  <br />Don't let my glowing review fool you, though. Chances are you probably  won't like this movie. Oh, well.

0792151712|5.0|When I first saw Titanic on the night of December 27, 1997 (a date I will never forget), I was absolutely swept away by it more than any other film I had ever seen. I could not stop thinking about it and its love story for  months. After having seen it a second time at the theatre and having been  captivated even more, I was eagerly awaiting the release of this video. I  bought it the day of its released.<br />I have been having a hard time trying  to keep myself from pushing the play button and wasting more time when I  should be doing my homework. Again, I am completely obsessed with the  beauty, heartbreak, elation and tragedy. The love story adds a myth that  tries to capture its lost world.<br />Some of my favourite scenes include  Rose's inability to stay on the boat (\\"You're so stupid, Rose!\\"), the break  up of the ship and subsequent earth-shattering crash to the sea below and  that steamy car scene. Also, the water breaking through the overhead  windows, of course the kiss at the bow, drawing for a penny or a dime or  whatever that is and the final prayer on the deck. It also includes so many  devastating touches such as those unforgettable flares that while not  working as intended still light Jack and Rose, the ghostly finale walk up  the grand staircase, the hauntingly beautiful music and so much more.<br />I  think that all the people amazed by Titanic will be coming back many times.  I think that this film deservedly will forever be in the hearts and minds  of the millions who were enthralled when it first set sail.
630027179X|5.0|Excalibur left me speechless.  It portrays the legend of King Arthur in masterful detail and erotic sensation.  The love triangle of Artrhur, Lancelot, and Gwenevier is illustrated in great drama.  The vindictiveness  of Morgana and the mystery of the great wizard Merlin enhance the movie's  fantastic plot.  The only fault with the film was its confusing conclusion.   Perhaps Boorman will one day do a remake and create an improved  conclusion.  However, the film was still excellent through and through.

B000006NPY|5.0|Adore is not a conventional album.  Do not expect to be singing along after the first few plays - in fact, you may not even like the album after listening to it five times through.  What Adore does, when you give it the  time, is it grows on you.  With patience, I have come to love this album  more &amp; more with each listen.  A lot of brilliance &amp; technical  genious was put into this album, in my opinion, making it the best album of  the year.  Do not expect to hear anything similar to Mellon Collie or  Siamese Dream - this is a more quiet album, but &amp; if you will yourself,  it will demand your attention.  Some of the best tracks include:  Ava  Adore, Appels &amp; Oranjes, Pug, Behold the Nite Mare, &amp; (especially)  For Martha.  But really, there are only a couple songs that I would even  dare consider skipping.  If there is anything I could say to describe the  unique sound on this album, I would have to go with the words of Billy  Corgan:  archaic night music.   Adore is a beautiful &amp; addicting album  - but do not expect to appreciate it fully right away.  Be patient!!!  I  was, &amp; I haven't stopped listening to it since the day I bought it 5  months ago.  I have never tired of it...I love these new waters that the  Pumpkins have been brave enough to venture in.
B00000DGUG|5.0|I am Bipolar, new term for manic-depressive disorder.  Happy to a sad point or risk psychotic actions;  also sad side to the brink of suicide.  Alanis acts Bipolar and her lyrics may as well on &quot;Jagged&quot; have  come from me except for 3 of them.  I watch her and wish I were to have  known her at one time to be friends with one who understands.  I am  guessing that Kurt Cobain was Bipolar (a song &quot;Lithium&quot;?) pluse  lyrics in &quot;we are all alone&quot; hurts my heart, I swear I dont' have  a gun, later used it to kill himself. My favorite admitted voculist is a  very obviously often Manic Axl Rose of Guns n'Roses.  He admits the fact  and I am glad as there is no shame to be Bipolar.  His various songs and  albums tell of his extremes as well.  And one of my favorite actresses,  Linda Hamilton from the Terminator and T2 movies, is an admitted Bipolar  and was also one of my most favorite people to watch.  The intensity and  then expressions are somehow a way for me to guess and so far I have also  diagnosed myself and two friends then without mentioning it to doctors  found 7 yrs was my length of time before put on Lithium after diagnosis.If  Alanis hasn't been evaluated by a good mental health professional she  should consider doing so in case she is a diagnosis waiting to be and needs  stabalized.  She is more peaceful now but her anger in &quot;Jagged&quot;  said so much for me and &quot;Mary Jane&quot; is me.  Thank you Alanis for  being yourself.  I love the song &quot;Thank you&quot; off  &quot;Junkie&quot; and can feel your inner sigh of relief and understanding  of how you became who you were and are now.  Scream all you wish.   Expressing yourself helps me when I hear you saying my inner monologe.  If  you quit &quot;screaming&quot; wwhen you wanted to do so then the songs  weould no longer be yours or your expressions but rather someone elses old  songs of &quot;Happy Trails to You&quot; rather than emotion and feeling  being told to us about you and who you are and how you became the Alanis I  cannot believe is so true to my thoughts and the life I lived to get to  now.  If you, I doubt ever will see this, but if so or somebody in the know  does please tell me if She, Alanis, is Bipolar or any diagnosed emotional  or mental disorder if she is willing to help us to show we (Bipolars) are  NOT scary but have a mood disorder causing us to FEEL much deeper emotional  joy and then sorrow that can be so painful as to be life threatening  through suicidal idiation.  Infomation from the famous on ANY mental  illness helps those who have nobody to speak in their behalf.  Celebreties  are respected and listened too. Please forward this if helpful to getting  word out there.  Many celebrities and famous actors in history such as  Leonardo Devinci and Raphael were Bipolar as is most well-known star, Patty  Duke in severe form much like VanGough's was.  If Alanis isn't then I leave  you with a persons' name who WAS: ABRAHAM LINCOLN, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED  STATES of AMERICA!  We are your everywheres.  Please contact me if you read  this far.  I commend you. Tami
B00000897V|5.0|This is a superb follow up to &quot;Marriage of Heaven and Hell pt 2&quot;. David De Feis is in fine form with his voclas, songwriting and clever integration of keyboards. Ed Pursino's guitar has never sounded  better and this is 75 minutes of pure ecstacy. Sadly underrated in the US  and Uk Virgin Steele are massive all over Europe. Just buy this album now  and you'll know why.
6304119046|5.0|I have never seen a move with such intensity in my life.  You thought that Die Hard was intense.  This movie has it all.
B0000024V2|5.0|Every song on this CD is a gem--pure, honest blues, delivered in Johnny's unique style.  When I was 17 (1974) Johnny Winter was a hero to me and my guitar playing friends; when I listen to &quot;Second Winter&quot; today,  it only reaffirms what I once thought: Johnny Winter is one of the best  blues guitarists around.  It's inexplicible to me why he doesn't get the  acclaim that, for example, Stevie Ray or Eric Clapton receive. They've got  nothing on Johnny Winter.<br />This is Winter's best recording.  His versions  of Dylan's &quot;Hwy 61&quot; and Little Richard's &quot;Miss Ann&quot; and  &quot;Slippin' and Slidin'&quot; are superb, as are his own songs.  <br />Brother Edgar played on this recording--before anyone knew who he was.   His sax and keys give a nice R&amp;B feel to the groove that Johnny, Tommy  Shannon and Uncle John Turner lay down.
B000002U82|5.0|Dark side of the  moon just like most of Pink Floyd's work, is some of the greatest music of the century. It was made in the 70's and was great then has stood the test of time because it is still great today. This album also  goes along with the Wizard of OZ. If you've never heard Pink Floyd buy The  Wall, and if you like that buy Dark Side of the Moon
068484267X|5.0|Reading this book while in the west of Ireland, some of it near Limerick, I was both crying and laughing at McCourt's ghastly tale.  At last I'd found someone with a childhood like mine, and worse to boot! Only the Irish  could find humor and love amidst the wrenchingly painful poverty.  A true  tribute to the resilience of the human spirit - McCourt reveals the dark  side of what it means to grow up Irish Catholic and poor.
B00000ADG2|5.0|You don't have to be anything but a human with ears to feel the fire of Lauryn Hill. &quot;Lost Ones&quot; was incredible, as was &quot;Ex-Factor,&quot; &quot;Superstar&quot;, and &quot;...Zion&quot;:  that's an athem for mothers everywhere. And the title track? Perfection!!!  The interludes worked my last nerve (can you say &quot;fast  forward&quot;???), and I don't care for &quot;The Final Hour&quot; or  &quot;Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You&quot;, but otherwise, a classic. Treat  yourself to one of the best releases of the year. Keep flowing Miss Hill:  can't wait to see you in March!!!
0780622642|3.0|It was okay. not much of a story line and no memerable lines accept for &quot;If this is a dream where are the girls?&quot; Not a big screen movie.
B000001EUN|5.0|My second favorite album next to &quot;Virgin Killer&quot;. Favorite tracks are &quot;Hold Me Tight&quot;, &quot;Lady Starlight&quot; and &quot;Make it Real&quot;.  The guys were really playing lead guitar like it  really mattered and gelled on every track. Klaus Meine's vocals were never  better nor had he ever showed more range.  A truly great Scorpion album.
0784010188|5.0|We may not have Star Wars on DVD yet, but that does not mean there are no good Sci-Fi movies available for DVD. The &quot;Terminator 2&quot; DVD shows what a DVD player can do! The live action menus are the icing on the  cake. The sound is so beautiful which is digitally mastered in THX. This  film is done by the same guy that brought &quot;Titanic&quot;, only Arnorld  is the &quot;Titanic&quot;. The picture on this DVD is flawless since it's  anamorphic. Get this DVD for Christmas, I mean it!
B000001F45|5.0|Who could possibly explain where rock music went after it left the hands of Uriah Heep ?  This album is incredible and offers some of the most creative and influential metal ever made.  Oh, to play bass like Gary  Thain... such is the stuff dreams are made of. The guy is missed now that  he's gone. (don't the GOOD ones die first ?)  JUST LISTEN AND ABSORB the  guitar/drum solos on Magician's Birthday....most other modern guitarists  just don't get it do they ?  The smoothness of other tracks like  &quot;Echoes in the Dark&quot; are difficult to put into words. David  Byron's rendition of &quot;Rain&quot; is all too beautiful. Any of today's  rock fans should take note since the style and creativity of bands like  Uriah Heep is long gone..... Get out the headphones and enjoy it once again  !
0767800958|5.0|thank you for presenting such a beautifull art, it is a evergreen artfull sentiment
6305169187|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time. I think that with a combination af Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Bruce Willis and other wonderful actors that it couldn't have gotten any better. I am also a sucker for happy endings.  Things like the end of the world bewilder and amaze me. So all in all- a  great movie.
B0000027RL|5.0|Ten. A true classic ranked with Nevermind and ultimately just as classic, this debut of the provocative honesty of Eddie Vedder's voice and their sheer powerful sound still breathes on the radio. &quot;Even Flow&quot;  works its power as Vedder screams; his voice drills brutally into the soul  as he lulls the listener down in a heart-breaking  tale of love in  &quot;Black&quot;; &quot;Alive&quot; and &quot;Jeremy&quot; rank with its  other famous tales. The power that surged in 1991 is still present in Eddie  Vedder and his talented song-writing abilities.
B00000FCBC|5.0|All of the songs on both of the discs kick a**. Metallica is still kicking ass, even on covers.
B000003TA4|5.0|Released in late 1991, Nirvana's Nevermind created the grunge music scene and screamed truth in &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, which became the anthem for our generation. A new sound exploding from Seattle, they were  among the company of Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice In Chains who made  grunge popular. The songs of Nevermind are classics, songs like  &quot;Lithium&quot;, &quot;Come As You Are&quot;, and &quot;In Bloom&quot;  are all landmark songs still played on the radio.
6305181772|5.0|When I first heard that Brian dePalma had to direct a movie produced by Tom Cruise, I was a little bit astonished and when it appeared that the project was MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, I really expected the worse. How a  personality like dePalma would cope with those virtual chains ? As always  with dePalma movies, the critics were divided; the scale was zero to ten. I  think that we should see this movie by always having in mind that the  director didn't have the liberty he used to have in his precedent movies.  So, let's search Brian in this blockbuster. Tom Cruise receives, in the  first minutes of the movie, a few red and blue chewing gums whose function  is to help him to open rebellious key-holes. Cruise uses those tablets  twice in MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. To open doors ? Not at all, he uses them to  destroy glasses, mirrors. How curious isn't it ? And you begin to realize  there is very much glass in MISSION IMPOSSIBLE : screens of TV's, PC's,  glasses with incorporated cameras, etc... O.K. Brian, we've understood  you're here, behind the mirror, behind the masks, one of the other  recurrent theme of this movie. Then you can recognize SCARFACE and the hero  of RAISING CAIN in Jim Phelps, a man whose thirst of power reveals a  multiple personality. And there is this wonderful scene when Jim Phelps  tells Cruise what's happened in Kiev unknowing that his agent visualizes  the same scene, with an other point of view of course, during his  explanation. Isn't it a subtile version of the split-screen process, a  dePalma gimmick by essence ? No doubt about it, this movie is one of the  three best american movies of 1996. A DVD which is already a classic.
B00000DHR0|5.0|Carol Bayer Sager (That's What Friends are For) has written another beautiful lyric in &quot;The Prayer&quot;. This song makes the album outstanding.
0783211856|5.0|This is the most powerful movie I've ever seen.  It teaches so much about the holocaust, and human dignity.  It is incredibly well made.  Everyone should see it.
B00000F1D3|1.0|I have not been a fan of Cher since she was with Sonny. I actually accidently listened to the \\"Believe\\" album at a local music shop. The title track utterly amazed me coming from Cher. Is this her first techno album?  The arrangement and vocoder treatments are simply stunning. The rest of the  album has a few interesting instrumentations but the singing is disposable  chanting sap that Cher has become famous or ridiculed for. Resort to the  CD-single.
B000002UJQ|5.0|When I first saw the video for &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; at the start of the summer of 1997, I was stunned--never had a video (or music) so hypnotized me upon first listen.  The rest of the album has the same kind  of quality which makes it a truly great album.  However, I hestitate to  even consider whether it is the best ever.  To beat out albums which have  stood the test of time like &quot;Sgt. Pepper,&quot; The White Album,  &quot;Abbey Road,&quot; or  &quot;Revolver&quot; (as you can tell, I REALLY  like the Beatles), is hard to judge only a year and a half after the album  came out.  But if I listen to it in 20 years and it has the same effect on  me, then it will have stood the test of time, and I'll begin to consider if  it is the best album there is.
B000001FY5|5.0|This album is amazing. Marley really pulled it off in this one
0790736241|3.0|I enjoyed this movie and would have given it a higher recommendation had I felt that it followed Sagan's story more accurately.  In typical Hollywood-liberal fashion, it misses the point by painting Religion as the  villain.  Sagan, in contrast, successfully merged religion and science in a  gray tone, rather than the cliche-ic black and white that Hollywood  prefers.  Without giving away the book's ending (if you liked this picture,  you should DEFINATELY read the novel), let me just say that his brilliant  and incredibly thought provoking ending was completely ignored.  Big  mistake.  However, Jodie Foster's performance still saves this version.
B000001IPL|5.0|I think that with the originality of their punk style that made them so popular they should have stayed with it, instead they are now making songs of things that they see, not what they feel.  I guess thats what happens  when you get to be 32 and are writing punk.
B000002RAA|5.0|This is, quite simply, the best album Hawkwind ever made, and one of the greatest space rock albums of all time.  Every song is a mindblowing experience, especially with the aid of headphones and pharmaceuticals!  I  found this album in a cut-out bin in 1977, purchased it for the cover, and  haven't stopped listening since -- I own more copies of this record than  any other -- plus the CD!
B00000DMJF|3.0|As always, welll most of the time, The Beatles produced oustanding music. The problem is that this CD is NOT remastered. Just repackaged. Typical record label way of trying to make a buck. You also can't hold The Beatles  harmless in this. They should have more control of what is issued in their  name. Also not leading on the public to believe that this is remastered. I  would gladly pay more for a totally remastered catalog. Including alt.  mixes. Do it now before George Martin passes away.
630512065X|2.0|This ain't Live on Broadway where MAYBE this one-song-wonder might seem worth the price of your first born.  It's flat and fairly lifeless on video.  Elaine Paige and &quot;Memory&quot; are fine, but there isn't much  more than that.  Strictly for the kids.
6304712936|1.0|I don't think Warner Brothers could have found a poorer print to make this dvd from.  I couldn't even focus on the movie because of the amount 'specs' and 'flakes' present throughout the presentation.  I had to do a double  take to make sure I had a dvd on rather than a worn rental video tape.   There was also some of the worst digital video breakup around minute 98  that I have seen from a dvd.<br />Also, although not stated anywhere, the disc  is two-sided and requires you to flip it over at the end of side one.  I  wasn't aware of it and when side one was complete, it just went to the  menu.  No mention to flip the disc over or anything.  just unbelievably  bad.<br />I am extremely disappointed in this dvd and would strongly suggest  you not purchase it.  If you do, be sure you express your displeasure with  Warner brothers as I have.
038533348X|5.0|I read this book many years ago and it has remained my all time favorite book. Kurt Vonnegut is a brilliant writer. His best stories have a way of sparking the mind and lodging in the heart. Vonnegut is a one in a million  writer.
1572522089|5.0|Director Akira Kurosawa has fashioned a brilliant version of Shakespeare's &quot;King Lear&quot; entitled &quot;Ran&quot;. The story is simple. In the 16th century Japan aged Lord Hidetora (played by Tatsuya Nadakai, in a  tour-de-force performance) divides his kingdom among his three sons, Taro,  (played by Akira Terao) Jiro, (played by Jinpachi Nezu) and Saburo. (played  by Diasuke Ryu) Soon greed and rivalry take hold driving Hidetora insane  and destoying his empire and his family in the process. Terrific battle  scenes highlight the tragic nature of the film. Watch for scene stealer  Mieko Harada as the vengeful Lady Kaede who gets her just desserts in very  violent fashion. Watch for Peter as the entertaining Kyoami. Excellent  score by Toru Takemitsu. Superb cinematography by Takao Saito and Masuhara  Ueda. Costumes by Emi Wada took 3 years to make and won a deserved Oscar.  Kurosawa's finest, most glorious movie!!! A must see!!!
B000003BDJ|4.0|I have recently become a stones fan, and this was the first CD of theirs that I bought.  The entire 2nd side is fantastic, I think it sums up the best work of the best rock band.  &quot;Gimmie Shelter&quot;,  &quot;Symapathy for the Devil&quot;, and &quot;Wild Horses&quot; are 3 of  the best songs ever.  Still, this album doesn't give us all of their best  work.  To be a compleete &quot;Best Of&quot; album it would need songs off  of the later albums (i.e. Miss You, It's Only Rock and Roll, Beast of  Burden, and Start Me Up) and others to make this a compleete album.  Plus,  there is NOTHING off &quot;Exile on Main Street&quot;.  I know it wasn't a  huge album, but in my opinion, it is the best album of all time.  They  could have at least put on &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot;, the only hit.  All in  all, this is a great CD for new fans, but sooner or later, you'll have to  buy the real albums.
0425152251|5.0|Once started it was difficult to put down.  The questions put to Sophie made me wonder about my own origins whilst making me feel slightly insecure.  A great book.
B000002KKC|5.0|Just like the Beatles after Sgt Pepper, Fleetwood Mac produced an album of stunning diversity under the direction of Lindsey Buckingham, who was obviously riding on the crest of a creative wave. However, the other band  members also show off their songwriting prowess on this album, Chritine  Mcvie turning in some achingly beautiful songs.<br />The variety of styles and  the way that Buckingham produced this album make this for me one of my all  time faves - it's just a shame that the CD doesn't contain all of 'Sara'.
0767819179|5.0|This story looks past the academics of love and allows two hearts to become one . This is as it can be -- for those who may want to give up hope. And this is how it is for those who never knew how love could really  be. A movie for anyone who has &quot;Finally Found Someone&quot;.
6305166021|2.0|As I watched this video, I wondered what, if anything, this was supposed to have to do with Ireland.  At first, I thought that Flatley had created a new form of dance that had been adapted for the stage, and I was all right  with that.  Later, though, Ireland is blatantly exploited just to get more  cheers.  Really--a three-tier stage in white, green and orange?  As a  traditionally trained competitive Irish dancer, I can tell you that Flatley  is not the god he thinks he is.  I saw more impressive feats at my last  competition, and those by twelve-year-olds!  If Bernadette Flynn would  break away from Flatley and start her own dance troupe, I would be in the  front row every time.  Her technique and style are perfection itself.   Flatley, though, has gotten sloppy.  Most of the time he isn't even on his  toes, a must for Irish dance.  Another thing that very much bothered me was  the fact that he took a traditional Shaker hymn and turned it into a  Vegas-type theme.  Although I do not belong to that particular religion, I  happen to know that the song refers to Jesus Christ as the lord of the  dance.  Does Flatley think he's the Messiah?
B00000AFGM|5.0|I've practically memorized this whole cd!!! I love it, and completely recommend it to any  Manson fan. Ok, so he did change his look and the way the music sounds, but it's still great! His views are expressed in his  lyrics and man they totally rock!... So, don't be a dumb@ss and think  Manson's music sucks now just because of a change.... No! Change is  Good!.... and so is this cd, so go and buy it already!!! it should be  number 1 !!!! I don't know why it isn't!!! That angers me! grrrrr.... hee  hee.. :) I'm a complete Manson freak... I guess you can tell. heh heh...  ***Evil Grin***
0767819179|1.0|A limp production not large enough for Streisand's ego. This vehicle is so self-absorbing, you'd better have the barf bag ready as soon as you hit play on your VCR. The plot is so unrealistic, only the  &quot;sensitive&quot; Barbra could have endeavored to make this  film.<br />Alright, already Barbra! You're the greatest and only good-natured  person on the earth!
6304578482|5.0|Kudrow and Sorvino really shine in under-rated and solid comedic performances. They have the timing and chemistry of the best on-screen buddies and the film uses every bit of technicolor it can, showering each  situation with the kind of incandescent, subversive and ironic wit that  Hollywood needs more of.  While the plot is standard, credit should still  be given to a hilarious screenplay that is surprising and winning in it's  own kindhearted way, and perfectly captures the idiosyncratic cadences of  girl-talk circa 80's and 90's.  Not since Mary and Rhoda (or Laverne and  Shirley) have we had such a perfect example of how funny girl friends can  be.
079073639X|4.0|Crichton's idea will fascinate me until the day I die. The question raised by the subject matter, &quot;what if mankind [chosen men and women, necessarily], is given ultimate power..?&quot;, is a tantilizing one. The  novel is utterly and satisfyingly mysterious; refusing to answer any  questions it may raise, instead it raises greater and greater ones, until  the ending claims the greatest unanswered question of all.<br />This film,  while achieving nothing in terms of the mystery and nightmarish wonder it  should've, still excels as follows: the acting is perfect. Hoffman, Stone,  and Jackson are mesmerizingly intense. Maintaining their humanity despite  the terrors inflicted upon them from within and beyond, they entertain  completely. They do wonders. <br />I love the book, and consider this film one  of my favorites.
0800179501|5.0|This movie is not really about fighting and about karate. It is a movie about the relationship between a man and a boy. Not a gay relationship, but a really beautiful bond that develops between the two most unlikely people.  The man not only teaches the boy how to use karate to regain his honor and  self respect, but in the process, the boy learns how to love and respect  others.
B000002LMK|5.0|Of the umpteen-diddly releases from Neil Young, this one is, in my opinion, the most powerful and consistent.  This CD sounds like it was recorded from a garage session - feedback, fuzz, and gritty guitars combine  to produce a masterpiece that deserves to be cranked all the way up on the  stereo.  I've never heard his guitar chords sound as heavy and grinding as  on this CD.  It's especially rewarding to hear 'Ragged Glory' after  listening to his earlier releases.  Now you can see what he was building up  to.
0802130208|5.0|When I first picked this up at a used book place in Penn State, I read it, and read it, and read it, and I couldn't put it down. And being 13 (11 at the time I read it), the 405 pages were quite overwhelming to me but now it  has become my all-time favorite book and it hasn't changed since I read  &quot;Inherit the Wind&quot;, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and other  'classic' books these last two years! It follows the mishaps and escapades  of Ignatius J. Reilly, an intellectual thirty-year-old man who writes notes  and numbers of reports explaining the trials and tribulations of life,  constantly aggrivates himself with his pen pal Myrna Minkoff and her absurd  attempts at sex education, his antics at finding the perfect job in the New  Orleans area (with fate providing loads of misadventures in the Levy Jean  racket and hot-dog vending! Ignatius is constantly ending up in great  troubles (one with his eccentric mother who insists that he be put in the  nut house which is an idea she gets from her friend lively named Santa)and  having &quot;stimulating&quot; conversations with street derelicts. With  good humor and old-fashioned American know-how, this is the great American  novel that this country had been waiting for before Toole wrote it. Sadly,  he commited suicide after he had written the book and thus providing no  more novels of his satirical humorand cynical kicks.
079073639X|3.0|Sphere has a lot in common with BLADE RUNNER: both films deal with complex issues and themes that are not commonly found in science fiction films; both films had their budgets slashed just prior to filming; both underwent  extensive rewrites and editing to compensate for the reduced budget(hence  the adaption and screenplay credits).<br />SPHERE is an a flawed film that,  like BLADE RUNNER, might gain additional appreciation over time for its  intelligent treatment of a complex theme.<br />There was similiar carping  about BLADE RUNNER comparing the novel(DO ANDRIODS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP  by Phil Dick) to the film and similiar bad reviews. SPHERE deals out a  number of ambitious themes. Although the film doesn't have the best hand to  play, director Barry Levinson does his best with the material at hand.<br />Keeping in mind the crippling imperfections found in the film, SPHERE is  still worth owning. Although it doesn't sucessfully deal with all the  themes presented and the screenplay has a number of weaknesses, Levinson  deals with the material intelligently and the cast, with a few exceptions,  performs admirably.
B00000DR52|4.0|From this CD, I heard the classic style of Chinese music
0780622650|5.0|I loved it, because I saw the tv series. People would say the ending is lame, then instantly they jugde the film bad. Why : because it just suddenly end (not showing that they completed the mission they were sent  for in the film). They should have released it a bit later, working on the  parts of the movie they had to cut ,like the ending of the film (or was the  film to long originally, so they had to cut it ?). Great to se, I will buy  it in my next batch of movies
0067575315|5.0|This Book... Is The MUST GET for ANY Batman fan... It has everything you want, pictures and an inside look into what went into making the animated series. Plenty of cute comments by Paul Dini and Wonderful layouts by Chip  Kidd. Trust me it's worth every penny.
B00000DQSS|5.0|Perhaps the last gasp of the gorgeous British pop in the vein of the Beatles' Abby Road (where it was recorded), but stamped with her own very personal style.  Contains the minor worldwide hit Babushka. The album is  dark (the cover and the content) but very sweet.  Contains her first  experiments with the Fairlight sampler, and incredibly fun bass by John  Giblin on several songs.
B000002L5I|5.0|Nobody can ever match the brilliance of SRV, but Kenny has the makings of one powerful blues guitarist - each song on this album has a unique flavor, great melody and excellent guitar work.  Can't wait for his next CD!
B00000DCWQ|5.0|This album hearkens back to a long ago, very English, fantasy world.  Beautifully produced and performed, mostly acoustic (with notable exception of the psychedelic Pibroch (Cap in Hand)). I find a lot of JT kind of  annoying, but not this one.  Heavy Horses is also in this vein, and very  good as well.
6302877849|5.0|If you liked &quot;Aliens&quot; or &quot;Terminator&quot;, you HAVE to watch this movie.  I think you'll come to the same conclusion I did: &quot;The Road Warrior&quot; is the greatest action movie ever made.  You  ever hear people rave about the car chases in &quot;The French  Connection&quot;?  This movie puts them to shame.  It also has two of the  most memorable villains you're likely to come across, Wez and The  Humungous.  Check it out!
B000002C4J|5.0|Way too many critics (aka &quot;the lowest forms of life&quot;), seem to make it their missions to attack any artist who happens to be popular and HAVE TALENT. Ms. Dion is both, and both of those extrordinary qualities  shine through on &quot;Lets Talk About Love&quot;. Not only does Celine  have a voice that can cross hemispheres, but she is also willing to  experiment with all types of music without losing her contemporary rock and  roll style. There is a little bit of everything here, soaring rock scapes  like &quot;The Reason&quot;, &quot;To Love you More&quot; and &quot;Miles  to Go(Before I Sleep)&quot;, right down to the jazzy &quot;Treat Her Like a  Lady&quot;. And yes, Celine blasts the entire record with her amazing  voice, especially on the incredible &quot;Us&quot; and the extravagent  title track. Records like this show exactly why Celine is such a superstar,  as she has much broader appeal than most people think. Perhaps those who  are quick to judge her because of her success should try listening to the  music that has made her a modern legend, and then ask themselves why they  did'nt do so in the first place.
B000006N61|3.0|This film is the prequel to the amazingly good &quot;The Road Warrior&quot;.  I've read that &quot;Mad Max&quot; has the highest return on investment of any film ever made ($100K to make, $100M in revenue  generated); however, upon watching this movie, you will immediately be  struck by its very low budget look and feel.  If you've already watched  &quot;The Road Warrior&quot;, you may want to watch this one to see where  RW has its roots, but you really need to watch RW first.  Leonard Maltin  (in his RW review) states that Mad Max is at least as good as RW; he is  crazy.  MM is a great movie for having been made for $100K, but RW is a  GREAT MOVIE, period.   One more thing, this film is dubbed with American  voices because someone, in their infinite wisdom, thought Americans  wouldn't be able to understand Australian accents.  This was a big mistake,  as the American voice actors invariably overacted in their dubbing.
6305169187|5.0|Here, in Idaho, where I live, everbody I know loves this movie. So just for the two people who said they hated this movie, USE YOUR IMAGINATION, not everything in this world is REAL. Anyway this movie is great, and I  recommend it to everyone.
B0000025BL|1.0|The 70's produced a lot of horrid music and this is a shining example.  I read people here calling this &quot;classic&quot;. That makes me wonder if eithe A)the definition of the word has changed or B) the stats about  increased drug abuse by Americans are indeed true.  This an overproduced  silly and dated sounding mish mash of violins and bad guitar playing.  The  lyrics are utterly forgettable as well.  This disc can usually be found as  a super saver for $9.99.  Take your 9.99 and go see a good movie.  This is  a waste of time and money, even the cover is stupid....
B000001EKX|2.0|That just about describes this album.  Not much imagination or musical expertise shown here.  Kiss was always better live anyway.  The studio cuts of their best songs are usually far inferior to live versions.  While no  KISS album deserves 5 stars, better choices are the albums released when  they became a better band:  Double Platinum, Alive I and II, Destroyer  (their best), Love Gun and Rock 'n' Roll over.
6304467540|5.0|The first and second film are the statndard by which all films should be judged.  The third film is good but very weak at the end.  The line &quot;I keep trying to get out, and they keep dragging me back by Al Pacino has  stuck with me like nothing else
0201633612|5.0|Usefull for both beginners and seasoned designer who will learn:<br />- new solutions to their recurrent problems.<br />- a better understanding on the solutions they already know<br />- a standard name to refer a pattern.<br />Great  idea, the best OOT book I've read 'till now.
6305177473|5.0|Skeptical at first of a re-make of an old movie, I ran out of reasons to not rent it....my seven-year old was beyond nagging at this point.  I can't tell you what a wonderful movie this is....a timeless theme, that is as  touching now as it was in the original version of the 50s.  And, this movie  will stand on its own.  A wonderful performance by all, and a must-have for  any family video library.<br />When I came to my senses about buying a video,  it was too late.....not one store in Clarksdale, Mississippi had a copy  left!  In fact, they were sold out within 48 hours of arrival!  That should  be the best review any movie could ever hope to have!
B00000DFRS|5.0|Okay, so Whitney did not give her audience what they really wanted to hear.  I listen to more gospel than any other type of music.  But, being the age I am and having the chance to listen to a lot of music, Whitney  always will have one of the greatest voices.  Your talking about someone  who has done everything her career allowed and made a great path for others  to follow.  In so many ways youv'e got to give her credit, music, movies,  production.  Yes, she is the best.  Stop comparing her to other and younger  artist.  She's been around for a while and changed with the time.  Others,  should appreciate her  more for her career moves, not her personal moves.   Good job and keep up the good work. Don't worry about the comparisons  because you are in a CLASS all by yourself Whitney.  Older is better and  wiser.    One of the best that can be compared with the best.  WHAT DOES  SHE HAVE TO PROVE AS AN ARTIST?
0784011605|5.0|This movie has touched my soul. I cannot tell exactly why, but I 've seen it 4 times, and still want to see it again. I love piano, even cannot play it very well. In this movie, it is the feeling of Ada.She has such strong  expressions in the melodies she played, and her eyes, her movement......  It's nothing about New Zealand, and doesn't matter where and when it  happened, it's about woman's feelings, music, live and death. This is a  good movie, It will be remembered .
0684833395|5.0|This book is a lot deeper than it may seem if one gives it only a casual brush.  It concentrates on the evils of war (its absurdity) by creating a text with little concrete plot, shifting time, and characters who are as  senseless as war itself.  Heller makes his point very clearly, and this  novel deserves to be regarded as a classic. Comparisons with  Slaughterhouse-Five are almost certain to arise; Vonnegut's novel is the  stronger of the two, but Heller should not be underestimated in any way.   The message of this novel, which is developed slowly as Heller leads the  leader up to a spilling secret, is plain; for a lover of peace and wry  humor, this is an excellent piece to read.  For a lover of war and  conflict, however, this is a novel that should certainly be read; if  everyone could be lead to see Heller's point of view, maybe the world would  be a safer, better place for \\"nuts\\" like Yossarian.
0811821846|4.0|Even if you don't actually make anything out of this book, it is still a good buy.  The pictures are really funny and the recipes are for food the average person actually cooks/eats.  Nothing super fancy or complicated.  I  definitely recommend it for any Star Wars fans that you know.
6304308388|5.0|To set this straight i would like to say that in addition to this wonderful movie, i also regard It's a Wonderful Life, The Philadelphia Story and My Fair Lady as other movies that i thoroughly enjoyed. I love  romantic comedies, with their simple plots, witty scripts and feel good  endings. <br />i feel that romantic comedies are sometime the hardest movies  to pull off. most of the time a romantic comedy comes off as corny or  sacharine. however when a truly great romantic comedy is seen everything  seems plausible however implausible they may be! In The Apartment the  script is simple, the comedic timing is spot on, the dialogue is great and  the characters are engaging. Jack Lemmon's acting is truly wonderful and  Shirley Temple is suprisingly gentle - something that i would have never  expected of the old hag. <br />i recommend this movie to anyone who loves to  be immersed in a world with a constant smile on their face. what is so  amazing about this movie is its sheer ability to please on countless  occassions. unlike most comedies, the Apartment does not age with time and  the film continues to be a good watch after the third time (this is my  measure of a good romantic comedy). The Apartment is a truly excellent  romantic comedy worth being rated as one of the top 100 movies by AFI.
B000006NPY|5.0|The music here is not new, and that is what makes it great. Corgan and the pumkins stepped aside from popular culture with this album. Corgan uses repatition throughout this album, but it is used effectively. Corgan's  superior songwriting ability is presented in prime condition here. The  lyrics are sometimes unoriginal, to my disapointment. Musically though the  songwriting is great. This album is only a dissapointment to certain Pumkin  fans, who eagerly awaited an album of traditional Pumkin's tunes. I have  only recently became a Smashing Pumkins fan, and I love how each of their  albums have a different theme musically. Adore ranks right up there with  their previous releases. My favorite songs on the album are Pug and Tear,  also my two favorite SP songs. The music on Adore seems to takes you away  to a different time and place, somethimg rare in today's popular music.
B000002MP2|4.0|The CD, Dookie is very cool. It is almost as good as their newest CD, Nimrod. The song Longview is probably the best song on the CD. They do a great When I Come Around. Basket Case is awesome. After FOD, listen for  about one or two minutes. Billy Joe, The lead singer cept the the recorder  on. There is a very stupid song. Mike is singing it. If you like Punk Rock  get this!<br />P.S. Green Day rules!!!!
1573226521|4.0|Garland has created an extraordinary tale of Travel, adventure, and excitment.  People reading this book to get a view at Leo's next movie may be extremly disappointed.  This movie is more emotional and graphic than  the average twelve year old can handle.  It has the captivating sense of  the earlier travel tales of the beats, mixed with a much more modern  wanderlust appeal.  It is a great read for anyone who dreams of excape and  adventure.
630027179X|5.0|There is no substitute when it comes to King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table. This movie is simply the one to watch. The story truly captures the dirt and grime of medieval times and the fantastic legend of  the sword in the stone. It has an incredible cast and the chosen musical  score is superb, including Carmina Burana and excerpts of the funeral march  from Die Valkyre by Wagner (it has the best use of Carmina Burana I've yet  seen (the Doors is a close second)). Truly a must see, great film.
B00000AFFF|2.0|Elvis Costello saved my life when he burst on the music scene in 1977, but he's been mostly irrelevant for years. While this record seems to be making a lot of his fans happy, I fail to see why. The songs on this record feel  like forced genre exercises. The melodies are far too fussy; despite their  harmonic complexities, they lack little things like hooks. (This *is*  supposed to be a pop record, right?) The lyrics are overbaked as well.  Worst of all is how poorly Costello's voice fits the material. A good  singer (Marti Jones for instance) could make you overlook the flaws in the  material; Costello only calls attention to them.
078322608X|4.0|an incredible movie,  The story and plot are very interesting and change through out the movie. Action filled but still requires thinking
6302227127|5.0|Few people know of this movie but is a real jewel!  The over-viewed &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; pales in comparision to the wit, warmth and humor found in this uplifting Christmas Classic.  Cary Grant plays a  multi-talented angel that answers David Niven's prayer for guidance.  The  music, images of Christmas in the fourties and unique characters make this  movie a must-have for any classic collector.
6304873441|4.0|I enjoyed this somewhat entertaining family movie, but less then I had hoped that I would. The movie starts out rockily but picks up considerably when Anya goes out to seek her fortune in St. Petersburg. I loved the part  when she's wandering around the palace. I also thought that the bad guy was  really funny, but not very nessecary.
B000000OQ5|5.0|Modern Day Cowboy is an all-time favorite of mine.  Brings back amazing memories and I'll forever be indebted to Tesla for this song and this album as a whole.  <br />If you enjoy &quot;real&quot; rock music, excellent guitar  work and a lean sound this is the album to get.  The band seemed to be  hungry to prove themselves w/ this album and their efforts resulted in one  of the finest rock albums ever released.  <br />I agree with one of the  comments made herein: If I only could pick one album while stranded on an  island it would be this one with no doubt.  So, for all of us who loved  your music, thanks Tesla for producing a great album and showing everyone  what a real band sounds like.  <br />BTW, when I heard Tesla was coming to  concert many years ago w/ Great White I thought GW was the opening band  until I actually got to the stadium.  How could these pusses be the  headliners?  I was proved right of course when Tesla performed Cummin atcha  Live, amazing(!!) guitar work.  The band was 10x tighter than GW...
0790730960|4.0|I watched this movie on HBO one afternoon, expecting something like Batman Forever, and was shocked. It's so weird! The scene where Pfifer is pushed out the window, and then goes nuts, was actually scarier than most slasher  movies. The part when Peguin's parents throw him in the river is incredibly  haunting. And strangest is the end, where Penguin's burial at sea made me  sort of teary eyed.  All and all it's a good movie which could have spent  more scenes with Bruce Wayne and less scenes with Penguin eating raw food.   The film fits in well with the series, it keeps up a Batman tradition of  cool visual effects and parts where people fall from very high places and  somehow survive.
6305169187|1.0|Which was first,  Armageddon or Deep Impact? Almost identical stories demonstrates how the director's vision (and beliefs, sensibility and professionalism) can turn a movie into a pathetic waste of time. In Deep  Impact, we saw an incredible tale of the best and the worst of the human  being. Top scenes shows human, real, credible reactions and situations. In  Armageddon, screenwriters and director shows only one thing: their  &quot;deep&quot; conviction on public ugliness.The Best Scene: kids in  Sicilia (or like) celebrating with Space Shuttle toys 5 seconds after the  meteor's destruction.
6304466498|5.0|This is a great Mel Brooks comedy that makes fun of movies like Alien, Star Wars, and Planet of the Apes, just to name a few. It's also less offensive than most of Brooks' movies. John Candy and Rick Moranis are a  hoot! If you like comedies at all you've got to see it.
0399143904|3.0|Being an avid reader who reads about 3-4 books per month, I found this book to be interesting but way, way to long. There were many dead spots in the book where I would lose interest and even contimplated not finishing  it. Clancy could have gotten the same result in about 300 less pages. Too  much time introducing characters and setting the plots.
0783223676|4.0|I found this weird comedy to be one of the most entertaining films I've seen in a long time. The acting is great and Willis is ten times better as a nerdy plastic surgeon with a drinking problem than as the reluctant heroe  of Armageddon. However it's a little to weird, especcially at the  beginning.
6300181340|5.0|Full of the usual Hitchcock touches and magnetic performances from the sound department, special effects and photohraphy. The cast headed by Rod Taylor, Suzanne Pleshette, Jessica Tandy, Ethel Griffth are brilliant, but  is really outshone by the lovely and talented newcomer, TIPPI HEDREN. A  Classic.
B00000AFFF|2.0|THERE ARE A FEW GOOD TRACKS ON THIS, ESPECIALLY THE FIRST 2, ESPECIALLY &quot;TOLEDO,&quot; BUT OF ALL E.C.'S RECENT STUFF, THIS IS THE LEAST COMPELLING.  WHICH SURPRISED ME -- I HAD HIGH HOPES AND AM ALMOST ALWAYS  UNCRITICAL OF ANYTHING HE PUTS OUT.
0783113943|5.0|misleading in the thought that Gia was not always with her one lover but many others-great movie
B000005K23|5.0|This is the one album from Marillion that really can envoke true emotions everytime you play it.  The title track, Script for a Jester's Tear is the best song that Fish ever penned.  I don't think Marillion ever sounded  better than this!
B000002BFZ|2.0|Being a huge Pearl Jam fanatic, I was really disappointed with this c.d.  The songs almost put me to sleep.
0553108034|5.0|When I read the first book, &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; it  made many of my previous favourites look shallow.  Then to have to wait for the second installment! Now that I've read &quot;Clash of KIngs&quot; I guess I'll  have to wait some more for the next book - but as the adage goes - the best  things in life are worth waiting for - well something like that. I like the  style of writing where several narratives are strung together.  I've always  liked Julian May's Many Coloured Land series for that reason. The  characters all have depth and are quite believable.  No goody two shoes  here!  Even outright thugs like the Cleganes have depth to their character.  Other characters are complex - such as Catelyn, yearning for a return to  days gone by. The whole world is gritty and beliveably medieval - you can  almost smell the pervasive stench of raw sewage, sweat and death in Kings  Landing during the siege. The plot hangs together quite well and is  gripping in a way that many other fantasy books are not.  The one minor  irritation is the time scales quoted - for example the 'wall' is allegedly  8,000 years old!  This use of immense scales seems inappropriate especially  when one thinks of what has happened in the last few thousand years in our  own time. This was one book I found hard to put down and not because of any  publishers tricks with velcro either!
0060977493|2.0|I've read several wonderful novels about India, including Seth's &quot;A Suitable Boy&quot; and E.M. Forster's &quot;A Passage to India&quot;. This one, sadly, is the worst of the lot. The author shows some promise: she is  quite gifted at word play. However, she has not yet learned to to create  vivid, three-dimensional characters and her many literary allusions are  more than a bit pretentious; what do references to &quot;The Great  Gatsby&quot; or Vladimir Nabokov have to do with this story or with her  theme (if there is one)? Her self-consciously post-modern approach to  telling her (trite) story doesn't help matters.<br />To sum up: no characters,  thin plot, pretentiousness, and some good word play. This is an author in  desperate need of a good editor; with encouragement and a fine critical eye  she might one day produce a real novel.
0684833395|1.0|This is one of those books that everyone reads and pretends to like because everyone else has read it and says it's really funny.  It has its moments, but it's not a very good book--that is, if you believe an  interesting plot, interesting characters, and good writing style are the  determining factors of a good book.
B000002NJS|5.0|I have followed Madonna from the very beginning.  Before anyone else in the UK knew who she was, I was out there buying her records.  I knew way back then that this woman would go on to be one of the biggest stars in the  history of music.<br />I defended her to my friends and colleagues each time a  trashy newspaper report came out and said she was finished.  Each time they  said that, the stronger she became and the music went on to prove her  point.<br />I buy CD's from all over the world and have a vast collection.   But I can truly say that Ray Of Light is the most incredible CD I have to  date.<br />The music and emotional journey it takes you on is outstanding.   From the enlightening opening track (Drowned World) to the sadness of Mer  Girl, this album is nothing more than complete genius.  <br />Even I never  expected, way back in the early eighties that this woman would one day  produce such a masterpiece.  It is definately the CD of 1998 and the CD of  her career (so far!).  Nothing has come close to the emotion and clever use  of music and electronica that Ray Of Light offers.  Frozen is a  breathtaking song, lyrically beautiful and musically brilliant.  The Power  Of Goodbye is without doubt, outstanding and Little Star an insight into  the way Lourdes has changed her life.  The title track, Ray Of Light, is  nothing short of awesome. When I listen to this album I can't help but feel  moved.  The frenzied Ray Of Light and the haunting Frozen are two songs  that I find hard (even as a writer) to express how much I love them.<br />If  you read these reviews and see any comments from people saying they dislike  this CD or that it should not be bought... ignore them.  <br />As a music  lover and an advid CD/music collector I can honestly say (without biased)  that even if I weren't a Madonna fan I would be insane to not have this CD  in my collection.  Madonna has proved that she not only belongs in the  History Books of music, but to me, those History books were created so that  one day this CD could be listed in them.<br />Probably the most perfect CD you  will ever own.
6301790170|4.0|Leonard Maltin's review is off base regarding this movie.  A must see.  Before the Usual Suspects, this movie set the tone for the Anti-hero, heroes.<br />Roy Scheider gives a great performance and the supporting cast  fill in the shadows of what is a taught, action thriller about four  fugitives given a lasst chance at redemption.<br />Explosive!
B000002JS6|4.0|Back in Black is one of the greatest Hard Rock/Heavy Metal albums ever produced.  It contains energy and soul that few of their contempories possessed.   Although most noted for  &quot;She shook me all night  long&quot; and &quot;Back in Black&quot;, the true gems of the album are:  Hells Bells Shoot to thrill Have a Drink on me
B0000047CW|5.0|Stan Getz at his sweetest, Charlie Byrd is great, and best of all, all tunes are terrific tunes.  This is the best.  The percussion at the end of the end of the 3rd song \\"O Pato\\" is too much.  Every song is timeless.
B000002UA9|5.0|Gather round, my children, and I will tell you of a time when pop music was turning shmaltzy in America - until four heralds from Liverpool, of all places, brought rock back to rock n' roll, re-taught America its own game,  and invented wild chord progressions that sounded as natural as a walk in  the woods.  &quot;Please Please Me&quot; the song remains one of the  Beatles' most dizzying and fun compositions. &quot;There's A Place&quot;  and &quot;Misery&quot; are outstanding little numbers. &quot;Twist and  Shout&quot; is the greatest rock vocal of all time. Throughout is a  vivacity, a new energy, that would justifiably captivate the world.
B000000XCA|4.0|Now, at 50 years old, I still get out my CCR and marvel at most of the songs on this album. Sure, everyone's heard Proud Mary and Born on the Bayou, but who can sit still when it gets to that final track: &quot;Keep  On Chooglin'&quot;? And &quot;Penthouse Pauper&quot;!!! Awesome!!! Thank  God Mr. Fogerty is still with us and still rockin' as great as ever!!!
6304383827|5.0|If you like Empire-era comedies and dramas (like Sense and Sensibility) then you'll adhore Emma. It's a perfect companion piece to Sense and Sensibility, equally standing on its own two feet, and is surpassing in its  quality. The dialogue is top notch, and Paltrow is simply ravishing. A  notable performance by Ewan McGregor. If you've seen Clueless before,  you'll be surprised by how much it borrows from the story. If you didn't  like Clueless, then don't worry, this is an old fashion telling, and very  proper.. Its a win win situation!
B000002J09|5.0|No, I'm not going to rip on Zeppelin.  They are my musical heros, and have nothing but endless adoration for them.   NO BAND has yet to come close to this unique blend heavy, heavy blues, speed metal, folk music, and  pop  music. On Zep IV, Stairway to Heaven gets the most press, but the best song  on the album is &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot;.  This song's haunting  and powerful lyrics, driving drums, and soul wrenching harmonica is enough  to make one silently say &quot;Wow&quot; to yourself. If you love side 2 of  this album, I strongly suggest purchasing Page and Plant's &quot;No  Quarter&quot;, where an awesome remake of Four Sticks is present, as well  as the even better &quot;Gallows Pole&quot; and &quot;Kashmir&quot;.
6303430570|5.0|Clerks is a great movie, I love everything that Kevin Smith does.  But Clerks started it all.  This movie has great acting, and is true to life (with a little comedy added in).  Dante is the typical law abiding guy who  will do something wrong only once in a while.  While his sidekick is how we  all would want to be.
B0000024TQ|5.0|There was a kind of American loneliness emerging in 1968, which hasn't gone away since. Simon and Garfunkel captured it magically on this album. Side one is a superb suite, taking us through various life stages in  poignant vignettes. Side two is a collection of intelligent pop numbers.  This holds up very well. Excellent production and songwriting.
6303686745|5.0|&quot;Duck and cover&quot; was the phrase most baby boomers came to know as the signal that nuclear disaster was near.  After the Cuban missle crisis, America and her enemy--the Soviets--came to be on pins and needles.  In Fail Safe, those fears are played on to great effect. An American SAC  bomber is erroneously given instructions to carry out its well practiced  mission: proceed to target (Moscow) and drop its payload of hydrogen  weapons. The desperate moves by the American president to turn back the  bomber, his subsequent decision to place American populations at equal risk  to avoid all-out war, and the gut wrenching final moments which leave this  viewer literally in tears, all conspire to make this film experience one  you'll not soon forget.

630428540X|5.0|I have avoided seeing this movie for the past two years because I was under the impression it was about UFO's, telekinesis, and the like.  When a friend recommended it to me recently, I reluctantly watched it.<br />I found  it to be one of the most interesting movies I have seen in years.  The  &quot;magical&quot; events do not dominate the story as I thought they  would.  Instead, we see the reaction that  heightened peceptivity and  sensibility provoke in the general population when they appear in one  special person.<br />Travolta's abilities appear magical, but there is a  rational reason for them, and that plays a key role in the movie.  (I do  not want to give the plot away).  I noticed a key bit of dialogue involving  D.H. Lawrence and &quot;Lady Chatterly's Lover,&quot; making me aware that  the writer was very familiar with the essence of the novel.  In fact, the  movie reminded me of the perceptivity of D.H.L. and the reception his  novels, poems, and essays got from the general public. His sensitivity, I  am sure, was enhanced by his struggle with the dire circumstances of his  life, as is Travolta's.<br />The story is enhanced by the pairing of two  people who are hurting from the blows life has dealt them.  In a pleasant  change from the habit modern movies have of having lovers couple &quot;in  the first reel&quot; so to speak, this couple has first to work through  their problems and hesitations before they can become intimate. To me their  progress in getting to know each other slowly and trustingly was realistic  and inspiring.<br />Spectacular UFO effects and mind-bending tricks do not  dominate this video; in fact, they scarcely enter. What we have is a  fascinating study of a &quot;different&quot; human being and his convoluted  interactions with conventional society.
0684843749|5.0|This is a great book for all bodybuilders and indivuduals who are into weight training.  It has full details into workouts for all bodyparts, including pictures of the actual workout along with great details on each  body part and how each exercise works that body part.  I recomend this book  highly
6305232660|5.0|My wife and I recently purchased the DVD &quot;Deep Impact&quot;.As usual we looked @ the trailer first in anticipation for what was to come.To say that we were moved is an understatement.Deep Impact like Armageddon, took  us out of our seats and involved us in an experience we'll not soon forget!  Character development(Duvall, freeman and Leoni) was right on the  mark.Visually breathtaking special effects coupled with inescapable human  tragedy made this an indescribeabale event.  I can't imagine all of this  movie being tastefully edited on a pan and scan videotape!If you can get  the DVD, it's well worth the price.,just sit back and prepare for the ride!   If you can't get the DVD at least track down the widescreen version on  VHS.Truly one of the greatest cinematic efforts to date!
B000002NIW|5.0|Instead of promoting the hell out of Deftones and saying how much they rock, I was hoping to review this record for what it was meant to be.  Sure there's rage and intensity on this record, but that's only the obvious side  of &quot;Around the Fur&quot;, Deftones most recent release.  All of the  songs seem to have their own little place in this well rounded rock album.   The Deftones are beyond Korn and Coal Chamber and Fear Factory and Moster  Magnet...not saying that they're better, but they're taking their music to  a higher point on the scale.  &quot;Around the Fur&quot; retains the  heaviness of Adrenaline without losing the emotion of the first also...that  is why this record kicks it from both sides of the spectrum: the emotional  side and the heavy side: A must have for any fan of rock music
0784011796|5.0|I was skeptical of this film at first; my girlfriend (who likes independent films a lot more than I do) urged me to go.  I have to say it was probably the most excellent movie I have ever seen.  It was well-acted  and brilliantly-directed.<br />The soundtrack complements the movie better  than any I have ever heard.  The film was captivating, intriguing, and  thought-provoking.  If it weren't right now, i'd urge everyone  to buy it on the spot.
6300269639|4.0|The first half of the movie is slowly developing for a sensational second half.  I regret that a sequel was never made, I am sure it would had been a hit.  Just watch it and judge by yourself.
0385484518|5.0|I absolutely loved this book!  In fact, I've purchased six copies for friends and relatives.  The book is a wonderful account of the evolutionary and very profound relationship between a professor and his student.  The  book is the culmination of a series of topics dealing with the human  experience.  Morrie, the infirmed sociology prof is is dying of amyotrophic  lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's disease, and Mitch, his  undergraduate student who found his way back to his beloved professor  sixteen years later, prepare the syllabus for the last class that Morrie  teaches.  Topis dealing with the human experience were chosen, discussed,  and later published by Mitch after Morrie's passing.  The book, itself, is  perhaps the most moving and educating thesis that I have ever had the  opportunity to read.  Thank you Morrie and Mitch for sharing some of life's  greatest lessons of the human experience!
1572522828|3.0|In this movie Sylvia Kristel (Emmanuelle) comes to Hong Kong to discover her sexual fantasies.  There are enough nude scenes to get your mouth wet but there is always room for improvement.  She does some things that will  make your eyes open so this is not a terrible movie. I've seen Emmanuelle  4, and it is not good at all so all shoppers and collectors like myself  should look at the first versions.
B00000F1D3|5.0|THESE ARE SIMPLY THE BEST TRACKS CHER HAS PUT OUT. <br />BELIEVE
6305171769|5.0|Any movie that casts Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh (Curtis' real-life mother), Adam Arkin, LL Cool J, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt deserves five stars! This time the movie went for more plot and atmosphere instead of  having Michael Myers slaughter everyone in sight, and it works! This is the  best film in the series since the first one came out 20 years ago. It's  also nice to see that the makers didn't forget the late Donald Pleasance.  Watch it!<br />P.S. The car that Janet Leigh drives in this movie is the car  she drove to the Bates Motel in 'Psycho'.
0790729628|5.0|Blade Runner is one of the best written, best acted, most dramatic, and most thought provoking movies ever made.  In the Science-Fiction genre, it certainly has to rate near the top.  In terms of the realm of all movies,  there are a great many good films, but, I think, Blade Runner still ranks  near the top.  In a time when all too many movies (and especially  &quot;SciFi&quot; movies) are mostly about big noisy fiery explosions, we  can always fall back to a movie like Blade Runner that is about important  issues (how does humanity interact whith its environment, with other  humans, what is the value of human life, what does it mean to be human).   And Blade Runner presents those issues in a dramatic and thought provoking  manner.  I still think the original cut of the movie was better, but in  some ways it is a testement to the quality of the film that changing parts  of it does little to dull its quality.
B00000FCBC|4.0|With his new recording, Metallica showed me again why they are one of my favorites hard rock bands. Disc #1 is excellent, mainly the version of Sabbaths Sabbra Cadabra. Even though I already had the other Garages  tunes, disc #2 has its worth, because the Motorheadache and Breadfan are  pretty good. If you really like Metallica from the Puppets &amp; ...  Justice's times, you should consider the idea of having this CD set !
B000001IPL|5.0|Smash has got to be the 2nd best CD ever (Americana being the 1st). Why do I say this? Smash (no pun intended)hits like Come Out and Play[keep em' seperated] and Self Esteem (What Happened To You is another great one). My  reccommendation is: buy it!
6300151379|4.0|Well, having grown up on films like this (The Princes Bride and Neverending Story genre), I'm very disappointed to see it out of print and unavailable.  A motley crew of cute critters, evil monsters, and David  Bowie; combined with Jim Henson's directing charm make it very memorable.  Good score, too!
B00000DHRZ|5.0|The best CD ever (in my opinion)! If you like rock and humerous songs, buy it. Why? The combination of good music and humor makes this a must buy. Americana and Smash (another Offspring CD; read my review)are the only two  punk CDs I have, and they are among the very select few I actually listen  to! Pretty Fly is quite an awesome song and Get a Job is quite a funny  Beatle spoof, so if you ask me, buy it!
B000007XUQ|5.0|Of all the collections of Christmas songs available on the market, this one stands out as the clear leader.  The combination of Karen's unmistakable voice and Richard's smooth, flowing arrangements simply can't  be beat.
B00000099Y|5.0|This is the greatest hard rock album of all time. The music works on so many different levels. For those who just want to rock and scream there is plenty for you to work with here, and intellectually minded folks could  spend an eternity trying to interpret the Jungian interpretations of the  lyrics and the hidden meanings of the artwork. I would challenge anyone to  figure out all the possible meanings of the segues.  &quot;Third  Eye&quot; is one of the most epic songs ever penned by a metal band, and it  is my favorite song of all time. Music critics who call Tool's music  pretentious or too long are missing the point. This music is meant to  stimulate the mind and move the emotions. If you cry to &quot;Push It&quot;  at a Tool concert, you wouldn't be the first. Tool sees music as art, but  that doesn't mean they can't rock. This music takes a little Led Zeppelin  and a little Pink Floyd, Metallicizes it, and brings it up to date. This is  music for the next millenium. Now that Tool has its lawsuit settled, make  sure to look for a new album next year!
0780622553|5.0|I have to agree with almost everyone, its a great movie that will diffently be remember for years to come because of its effect that will rock your world!!!!!! I have watch the ending to this movie fifteen time  when I got it just a few days ago, and each time it blows my mind. The  powers that the Aliens and John have are great(It will make you wish you  had the power to tune). You also really feel for the characters in the  story and hope they come out all right. So get this movie!!!
6305120706|4.0|I've seen the live show 3 times, heard the soundtrack probably a hundred or more, but this DVD was still an exciting and thrilling experience.  A gorgeous 5.1 recording of an entirely new performance of the music.  The  editing and camera work reveal character interactions and nuances I had  never noticed before.  An excellent, tremendously talented cast. The  'making of' short feature is also great.<br />Just 2 quibbles: First, the  Growltiger sequence was omitted altogether.  Was I the only person who  liked that number?<br />Second: As my wife noticed (and I had to agree)  there's an almost laughable number of closeups of the female performers'  derrieres wiggling during various numbers.  Webber was just a bit too  liberal with the butt-cam.<br />Aside from this, it was teriffic.
B000002H97|1.0|It's so many years later, but I'm still bitter. Metallica, one of the original thrash metal bands, a pioneer in promoting technical excellence and superiority in music, decided to sell out. There is no better way of  putting it; our boys in black decided to simply stop the hard stuff and  write some watered-down putresence. The Black album had minimal soul, and  even that little was lost completely when &quot;Load&quot; was released  next. &quot;Load&quot; of #&amp;@! is what I say. There was definite  evolution for a time. &quot;Kill 'Em All&quot; had a youthful exurberence  that had solidified into some masterful writing by the time that  &quot;Master&quot; came out. &quot;And Justice&quot; showed definite  maturity in composition.  And the Black album? Shows just a tiredness. Sort  of a, &quot;I'm tired of doing this for myself; it's time to make some big  bucks.&quot; I'm not saying that they shouldn't have changed. Heavens  forbid; in order to improve, change is imminent. However, there are other  paths to travel other than just doing the easy thing. Pink Floyd being a  good example - their early works focused on being simply trippy, but they  grew and actually captured a pop audience while remaining true to their  sound. The simple fact that &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; has  consistently been on the Billboard Top 200 longer than any other recording  in existence is proof enough that you don't have to sell out to sell well.  There are a few bright spots here, though. &quot;Sad But True&quot; has a  nice, crunchy groove that demands bootage, and &quot;Where Ever I May  Roam&quot; conjures up some wisps of &quot;The Thing That Should Not  Be&quot; (their tribute to Lovecraft and Iron Maiden). All in all, though,  for most of us who followed Metallica through their formative years,  &quot;Metallica&quot; was a big let-down. And &quot;Load&quot; just sort of  let us go completely.
0446605409|5.0|I've read and liked 5 of Demille's novels.  The hero here is a thorough jerk, but loveable anyway.  The last 1/3 is hard to put down.  Lots of action and plot twists.  I'm gonna order Spencerville now.
B000001085|4.0|As a fan of Deep Purple in its many incarnations, I find Glenn Hughes to be one of Purple's most interesting voices.  This album allows Glenn to rock and not worry about playing bass.  Backed with two guitars, these  songs really rock.  (Just thing what Purple might have sounded like with  two guitars.)  This is a great live album that needs to be cranked up.
B000001Y5X|5.0|This is the first album I got by manson, and in my opinion it's the best.  Now I must warn you, when you first listen to it you wont have any idea what the hell there saying, but after you read the lyrics and get to no the  songs you wont want to stop listening.  I didnt think it could get any  better than this, when I started hearing how Antichrist Superstar was  mansons best yet, so I had to get it.  A few weeks later when I got it and  listened to it, I still liked Portrait better. Im not saying Antichrist was  bad, just that Portrait rocks more and is a little heavier.
B0000025CP|5.0|As a long-time metal fan (especially of Sabbath, Purple, and Dio), I have high standards by which I judge albums, and Stained Class is one of the greats...if you like intricate guitar work, top-notch songwriting, and  powerful vocals, this is for you.
6300218031|4.0|How can you lose?  You've got Stoltz, Masterson and Thompson, all before they became big stars.  The teen angst is genuine, the characters a little too cute, but the ending just what every heartsick high-schooler could  want.  Masterson serves every tomboy/unappreciated best friend just right.
B000001Y9I|5.0|Sometimes things happen which make the powerful case for the existence of god.  In the musical world during A.D. 1996, this happened when Deep Purple released Purpendicular.  I approached this album with trepidation at first;  after all, Ritchie Blackmore is my favorite guitar player of all time, and  I was going to take the kid gloves off whenever I got my hands on their  first album with his replacement, Steve Morse.  I guess I worried they  would get too  country or fusiony or alternative or whatever...it turns out  my fears were about as real as Chicken Little's. From the get-go, it's  obvious that this is not your father's Deep Purple.  Morse's guitar sound  is modern and very rhythmic--totally different from Blackmore's  blues-meets-Bach strat tone.  While Steve can lay on the harmonics and  chromatic runs a bit too heavy, he is a true virtuouso and a team player at  the same time, something Blackmore is not, even if Ritchie is more daring  in concert.  But I digress... Purpendicular explores so many styles.   There's the heavy, almost-rap of Ted The Mechanic, with its joyful way of  saying, &quot;This is who we want to be in the '90s, our past be  damned,&quot; the Bowie-esque moodiness of Loosen My Strings, Soon  Forgotten (which sounds like a more evil version of 1993's Nasty Piece of  Work), Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming (an emotional ballad which really  takes off), the Highway Star-like Bach-rock of I'm Not Your Lover (done  almost as if to remind the grey beards that this IS Deep Purple), the  acoustic Jethro Tull-like Aviator, the funky/bluesy Rosa's Cantina, the  social commentary backed by ferocious musicality of A Castle Full of  Rascals, another beautiful ballad called A Touch Away, the fast and  virtuousic Hey Cisco (go for it, Lordy!), the almost mosh-metal fun of  Somebody Stole My Guitar, and the harmonica and power chord gut-wrencher  called The Purpedicular Waltz.  After one listen this became my  third-favorite DP studio album, behind Burnand In Rock.
6300181286|5.0|This is the movie (along with the inferior &quot;Dracula&quot;) that launced the Universal Horror films of the thirties. A masterpiece of movie making which everyone should see once.  Masterfully directed by the great  James Whale with excellent performances from Karloff and Colin Clive as the  good Doctor. Not as terrifying to modern audiences, but still admirable in  all respects.
6300248569|5.0|It adds a face and a voice to the characters in the book instead of becoming a different story with the same name.  The cast is great.  The actors/actresses capture the feeling of the book without being dry.  Also a  wonderful video for anyone who just enjoys a good love story.
B000006TSC|5.0|It's a shame more people don't know about this album, because it is one of the gems of rock/pop music.  It's one of those rare instances where the songwriting and arrangement is just so damn good that it stands out as  something special and worthy of notice.  In addition to the quartet, Mel  Collins adds some flute and soprano sax parts, but the album never has the  'orchestral instruments for their own sake' syndrome that plague so many  other albums that try to incorporate these elements.  Rather, one can't  picture the arrangements as being nearly as complete without them ('Wing  and a Prayer' is a perfect example of this) and they fit into the ensemble  as naturally as Latimer's guitar or Sinclair's electric bass.  While I'm  not totally enamored of the instrumental that clutters up the second side  of the album, the overall product is so skillfully and tastefully conceived  and crafted that I can't help returning to it time and again, as I do with  other monumental records that--contrary to 'Breathless'-- have received  virtually universal acclaim and notoriety (such as &quot;The Lamb Lies Down  on Broadway&quot; or &quot;Going for the One.&quot;)  Permit a total  stranger to do you a service, and let me advise you to plop down twenty of  those new-fangled bucks to get a copy of what is surely one of the  undiscovered treasures of pop music.
6301768809|5.0|This film is so misunderstood. <br />It's not about violence, guns or knives. It's not even about Small Town narrow minds.<br />It's about one man and his struggle to re-enter a society which called on him in their hour of need  then forgot him in his - the violence is just background noise.<br />It's  unfortunate this film is grouped together with it's subsequent sequels.  Rambo II and III are of a different genre. <br />Where as they are all hack  and slash, First Blood is more subtle, more tragic.<br />Summed up when Rambo,  in tears, recalls how back in Vietnam he comanded multi million dollar  gunboats, tanks, helicopters, back home he can't even wash cars.<br />Not to  be missed. Brilliant stuff.
B000002UDB|5.0|Even though the album isn't sequenced as well as the other great Beatles albums, there are so many good songs on this collection that you just go with it.  It contains arguably the two best songs ever written  (&quot;Strawberry Fields Forever,&quot; &quot;I am the Walrus&quot;), and  many of the nearly greatest songs ever written (&quot;Penny Lane,&quot;  &quot;Hello Goodbye,&quot; &quot;All You Need is Love&quot;).  The three  weaker songs on the album (&quot;Flying,&quot; &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot; and  &quot;Baby You're a Rich Man&quot;) are dwarfed by the goliaths the  surround it.  It is a fitting end to the Beatles psychedelic era.
0385006896|5.0|Of all the books I have read, this is by far the best. The relationship between Holmes and Watson and at times, between Holmes and his clients is amazingly detailed. The single most enthralling fictional character ever  imagined IMO, this book is a worthy read for all ages, no time too soon or  too late to enjoy such a masterpiece. Myself being 16 and having read this  collection three times at present date
B00000AFGM|5.0|This is certainly the most mainstream release Manson has done to date. This is not to say that it is &quot;pop&quot;, only that it could appeal to a wider range of audiences. This CD has a much more coherent mix than  previous releases. Unlike the kick in the teeth of &quot;Portrait of an  American Family&quot; or the dark &quot;AntiChrist Superstar&quot;, this CD  has a stronger emphasis on blending the music into a somewhat harmonious  pattern. I certainly like this release, and think it is certainly worth  plunking down a few bucks for.
B00000APLB|4.0|I have listened to a lot of Rolling stones, but I was surprised with this CD, I popped it in, and after getting over my surprise at the lousy recording quality, I heard the most amazing blues music. I didnt' hear very  many Stones songs that I'm used to. But,I heard this great blues music,  excellent to say the least. If you're an audiophile, dont get this CD, it  is lame to say the least as far as quality, but for the music lover, the  blues enthusiast or Stones fanatic, this CD is a great selection.
6303832563|5.0|This film is about the beautiful world in which we reside, and our own inability to enjoy what it provides, or to live in harmony with nature.  I believe the title of the film means something along the lines of &quot;a  life in conflict with itself&quot;.  That certainly describes our daily  existence!  The film has no dialogue, but relies upon imagery to convey  meaning.  This is by no means boring or difficult to sit through.  The  filming is extraordinary and captivates the audience from the moment it  begins.  I walked away after watching this film astounded at the beauty in  nature, and at the banal existence of most of the world's population.  I  was so moved by the beauty of this film, that I am still searching for a  copy of it eight years after viewing it for a college course.
B000001FS3|5.0|The most amazing, wonderful, well constructed, terrific CD I have ever heard. I had to buy a second copy, because I wore out the first one. No band can create such an awe inspiring album like U2, this emotion packed  CD, presents songs that can tailor to any mood. The listener will gain new  insight into life, but the messages in the songs are different for every  person who listens. A most amazing experience to say the least. The best  selection of any music anyone could Choose.
6304938241|5.0|If you are looking for a sappy love story with a happy ending, find another movie.  The story was heartbreaking, the costumes wonderful, and the setting breathtaking.  I'm going to search for the soundtrack as soon  as I finish writing this review.
6305226296|5.0|I attended this concert in Lav Vegas last year, and have been able to see the video.  It was a wonderful concert, a treat for all Bee Gees fans, and a must have video!  I'm buying another copy today for a friend who just  happened to catch the concert on HBO and now is a die-hard fan!
B00000DHTF|4.0|The first time I listened to Tracks I was disappointed, but it may have been because I went through it chronologically. The set works much better on shuffle or random. Now, Iwonder what it will sound like with the rest of  his catalog mixed in...
B000002I27|5.0|I accidently left my copy of &quot;Strange Days&quot; at a friend's house and he doesn't want to give it back. I told him to go ahead and keep it - I don't want it back - that's because I'm gonna buy the &quot;GOLD&quot;,  master recording version! Doors fans may argue which album is the best. The  Doors, Strange Days, and L.A. Woman are usually the  top picks. All three  are five stars, but, depending on your mood, I would give Strange Days the  edge. I think this CD epitomizes the Doors. It brings out the magic of  Morrison's poetry and the musical synergy of the band. If Moonlight Drive  doesn't send chills up your spine, you, unfortunately, are paralyzed from  the neck down. &quot;Timeless&quot; is an overused description, but not in  the case of the Doors, and especially this album.  This music can be  listened to over and over -  it is an album that you will never give up -  unless someone steals it from you!
B00000DFSK|2.0|I usually would not take the time to review something I was not all that enthusiastic about, but as an ardent U2 fan I felt obliged to inform the potential buyer of the flaws of this CD.  My main problem is that the  producers mess with the originals to the point of irritating the listener  (i.e., me): a whole verse of &quot;New Years Day&quot; is chopped out, the  beginning and end of &quot;Where the Streets have no name&quot; are  shortened, a section of Bad is missing.  These things irritate those of us  who know and have loved this music for almost twenty years.  I also don't  think the inclusion of four songs from R and H was justified.  One surprise  - &quot;October&quot; appears unannounced at the end.  Anyway, buy the  originals.  They're all worthy of five stars.
B00000253N|5.0|There basically aren't any words to describe how beautiful this album is.  A more mature Dylan than mid-60s Dylan, no longer is the wordplay the most important thing (though it's still incredible), but the musicianship, the  stylistic shadings, the mood, and, also, Dylan's songwriting poetry.  This  album, along with Watergate, basically ended the &quot;sixties&quot; as  they were commonly understood, and everything after that led right up to  Reagan and our current day &quot;greedy, shallow, America&quot;.  Still,  this album is at the same time timeless, sounding just as great now as it  did then, proving once again just what a genuis Dylan was.
B000000WF0|5.0|I undoubtedly like many, bought this LP for 'BIttersweet Symphony', and was most disappointed with the rest of it, which I found flimsy and dull. Then I realized how to listen to this album, in a sense, with one ear. And  then the songs began to emerge, and I began to apperciate Ashcroft's  incantory approach to singing and writing lyrics. The band just doesn't  always bow down to verse/chorus/verse conventions, which is a refreshing  change, and if only there were more high-profile groups who could pull it  off as well as the Verve does.
B0000025VU|5.0|This is not Bob's best work.  But it is still absolutely mind-boggling.  Jokerman, the opening track, is a stunning lyrical display.  Anyone who thinks Dylan couldn't write songs in the 80s shouold listen to this.   Though I have big problems with the state of Israel as it currently acts,  Neighborhood Bully is a raging, brilliant song sung with a righteousness  only prophets possess.  The classics, to me anyway, are &quot;I&amp;I&quot;  and &quot;Man of Peace&quot;, both of which will seriously set your mind  spinning in all sorts of philosophical and religious speculation.  A very  &quot;Jewish&quot; album after 3 born-again albums, it also has an  excellent &quot;union&quot; song, &quot;Union Sundown&quot;, which a  previous commenter put down, but is still a fine song.  If you like Dylan  and have 10 bucks, buy this album.
6304383827|5.0|This was a wonderful movie with a brilliant plot and awesome actors.  Watch the movie Clueless (1995) and watch the parallels in it.  It is a hilarious spoof on a novel written in 1816.
B000005RS7|5.0|I can't say &quot;wonderful&quot; enough times for this fantastic, incredible, ***SUPERB*** album by Kate Bush.  Can you believe, Bill Whelan (of Riverdance fame, groan!) collaborated on this album with Kate?  But  trust me, the music you find here is a thousand times more WONDERFUL than  anything you'll find on the Riverdance CD.  I can't say enough good things  about &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;... if you don't have it already, buy it  NOW!
B0000025DV|5.0|Out of the Blue is a fantastic album. Especially following songs are beautifull compositions: Big Wheels, Steppin' Out, Sweet is the Night,  Believe me now, Wild West Hero and Across the Border. Unfortunately, most  people only remember ELO by its more simple songs like Mr. Blue Sky, Sweet  Talking Woman. ELO combines rock with classical music as no other artist is  able to do. When ELO broke up, I really was very sad. My favourite ELO song  is definitely &quot;Big Wheels&quot;.
B000000OSE|5.0|With the release of this double-set record, GNR produced one of the best music of all time. These albums are brilliant both musically and lyrically. Too bad that the band broke up. Oh, well &quot;Nothing lasts forever, even  cold November rain.&quot;
0553473050|5.0|Typical inexperienced kid goes up against the big corporation. That may be a negative comment; however, the getting there is what counts in this book. Even though you know what will happen in the end, the trials and  tribulations of the main character are what counts here. Read it and enjoy,  it is fairly fast paced and I found I was continually looking forward to  the next chapter/sub-chapter.
6300151379|5.0|See something different every time you watch it!  It's like Alice in Wonderland, Wizard of Oz, and Raiders of the Lost Ark all mixed together.  Fun, fun, fun.  Jim Henson's masterful talents are at their best.
0553502077|5.0|The daughter of a friend of mine gave him and I this tape to listen to while on a business trip. It was the first experience either of us had with books on tape and my first experience with Mr. Grisham. We found the tape  to be extemely exciting and when we would stop for gas or what not, we  couldn't wait to get back in the car. I thought this was an excellent book  and it has led me to listen to other Grisham books on tape (The Rainmaker  and The Street Lawyer) while commuting to work. Keep up the good work Mr.  Grisham

1559408898|5.0|I'm giving a 5 stars to this movie and still I have a little doubt in my mind. Not about the film in itself which is, in the science-fiction category, a must-have.<br />The problem lies elsewhere. In Robocop, you will see three different worlds pictured : a) The world of the leaders where iron (polished) and money reign. b) The world of the gangsters where iron (rotted) and guns reign. c) The world of the police related heroes where iron (Robocop) and friendship reign. And between or outside these worlds : nothing or almost nothing. A wife who disappears as soon as her husband dies, wars or tragedies you can only watch through controlled TV channels.<br />To try to pass from a world to another is nothing but safe. In fact, death waits for you in this no-man's land. Except for Robocop.<br />What the hell does Paul Verhoeven try to tell us by picturing this claustrophobic vision of the future ? That our future lies in a clear separation between economic or ethnic groups ? That only a charismatic and heartless leader will able to control the situation ?<br />Frightful perspective, isn't it ? Or rejoicing view of the mind, Paul ? O.K. I'm through. Let's just enjoy the show ! Action, good actors and beautiful gunfights. Who can ask for anything more ?<br />A DVD zone out of stock.
0790739909|5.0|I'd love any movie with Meg Ryan and Nicholas Cage, but City of Angels really got me!  It takes a refreshing angle on the old stand by theme, &quot;It's better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at  all&quot;.  Yes it's predicable, but in a beautiful way.  The  cinematography is outstanding!  Defintely one of my all time favorites!
1564428117|5.0|You CANNOT go wrong with this.  If you are looking for something creepy, evil, and disturbing, this is it.  No other horror movie can compare with this.
B00000DHR0|5.0|This Christmas CD is great. I would reccomend it to anyone young or old! I think it would deffinitly make a great first impression on any one who has never listened to Celine Dion before. Totally AWESOME!!
B000002A46|5.0|hi people, i own the Merry Christmas CD by Mariah and if u want a excellent CD for this season make sure to pick up your copy of Mariah Carey's Merry Christmas!!! if u need help at anytime pickin out any CD by  Mariah, Books, or just need info u can feel free to e-mail me anytime  at:amyRR@prodigy.net
6302000823|5.0|I've seen this film more than 3 times and each time is just as wonderful as before.  Easy to recommend as everyone that I've recommended it to has attested to it's excellence.  No sex, or violence, but nonetheless, it is  full of passion and excitement.  We watch as a young boy befriends the  projectionist and we easily get involved in the emotions of it all, as this  relationship grows through the years.  I've watched many a man shed tears  on this one.  The finale will appeal to all, and especially to those in  love or have loved before.    Some memorable scenes include the local  priest who screens to edit out sexual content of films to be seen by the  community. During the previewing, the ringing of a bell signals when to cut  and to watch the priest get agitated when he begins to see what will most  certainly lead to a &quot;sexual&quot; scene, albeit, only kissing, is  really humorous.  I enjoyed the acting as this film's characters were well  played and authentic. The music was excellent as was the photography.        It is easy to get involved in this movie, no matter what the gender or age,  although 2-7 yr. olds might not appreciate the subtleties.
6305232660|2.0|It is worth seeing but not worth buying. They tried to do too much in a short movie. It needed to be a three part mini series. The first day would have shown the discovery of the comet, the second showing the attempts to  stop it and the third showing the destruction and aftermath.<br />Well that is  my two cents worth....
0312853238|5.0|This book was excellent!  I had guessed correctly on what the ending was before I had read it, but it still was great.  I hope that the other books in the series can keep the story alive!
6305171769|3.0|I liked this one a lot.  It was creepy and had Curtis in it, but there was just that little something missing.  There was an element of &quot;Scream&quot; in it, and I didn't dig that.
0375701427|1.0|This story and character is too old, too white and too male...  It doesn't go anywhere, but down...  Leaving out the good parts and ruminating over the trivial parts of the main character's life, the book was a train going  nowhere...
B000001E18|5.0|Oh, how that hurts to admit. The Band You Love To Hate, uber-MOR schmaltz/sincerity kings somehow managed (on this *and* &quot;Achtung, Baby&quot;!) to pin one of the better takes on 90's media culture to the  mat. With a minimum of fuss, Bono et al. do Baudrillard one better (and way  more accessibly!) as they skate over the millimeter-thick surface of an  image-drunk culture, ponder what happens to love in a porn-dizzy  mediaverse, and make ironic faith seem like a valid alternative to sincere  doubt. For real! *And* you can dance to it!   Look, I found this hard to  swallow too, but it's ineluctable. Having copped Eno's trick of assembling  something real and beautiful from a dancing matrix of soundlets, this isn't  the down-by-the-River-Liffey minstrels of &quot;October,&quot; nor the  wanna-Beatles of &quot;Rattle &amp; Hum.&quot; This is an enormously  intelligent band at the height of their powers.  Shame they threw it all  away on &quot;Pop.&quot; Oh well.
B00000DHRX|5.0|George Michael has just gotten reaquainted with his fans with this album, and he has truly done us a favor by including the finest recordings he's ever made.  I must admit that I had given up on him as an artist.  Now,  however, I am simply waiting to see what's next from this phenominal star.
B000002H33|5.0|The songs on this album take you on a melodic journey, while banging your head with metal thunder the entire way! This is definitely my favorite Metallica album (although all of the others albums are tied for a close).  'Orion' is simply hypnotic, and 'Master of Puppets' is absolutely  incredible.  A complete must have for any person who ever thought about  buying a metal album!
B000002KD5|5.0|I knew this cd would be good in the first place because there were some songs I already knew from the reunion concert in '97(Rhiannon,I'm so afraid,Say you love me.)Now I like it even more because there are some new  songs that I like on it also.(Monday morning,World turning,Warm ways.)I  reccomend this cd if you like the Mac because it is truly one of the best  albums I've ever listened to,and I think you will like it too.
B00000FBRE|4.0|Phew!  I liked their last CD alright, but not nearly as much as the 3 that preceeded it.  Well this new 30 minute album (too short!) has the best elements from Double Plaidinum, and includes some of the best elements from  all their previous albums as well.. This has a little more pop/rock style  to it than anything else they've done, and it works really well.  This is a  must buy for all Lagwagon fans, even if you didn't like Double Plaidinum.
6302182530|5.0|The Golden Voyage of Sinbad is the best of the mythic science fiction movie genre.  The story and characters are creative.  The special effects are amazing.
B000002GQE|4.0|The post-Denny Laine Moody Blues have always been a bit somber and pretentious, and this highlight of the era is no different. Good songs with ponderous words mix with long, lightweight orchestral interludes and awful  poems. And yet, the whole thing is charming. It's easy enough to suspend  disbelief and go along for the ride.
6300184064|5.0|One of the best, most significant and atonishing films of all time.  It is dramatic, terrifying, as real as it gets, and absolutely plausible.  The American Film Institute should dig a hole and bury itself in shame for  putting movies like &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; in the 100-best list and  leaving master pieces like &quot;Brazil&quot; out.  There are no words to  describe this movie.  Unquestionably fantastic.  Get it NOW!!!
B000002VMD|2.0|This album won the &quot;Album of the Year&quot; Grammy award. &quot;ALBUM OF THE YEAR&quot;?! &quot;ALBUM?&quot; &quot;The soundtrack to 'the Bodyguard?'&quot;  Song of the year, sure. Vocal performance of the year,  sure. Female singer of the year, sure. But ALBUM?!? I'm sorry, but the  soundtrack to some silly exploitation flick in no way deserves such an  honor. Whoever decided to give it this award has no concept of the album  genre, or how artfully albums can be assembled.
B000007XUQ|5.0|In 1978, at the age of 12, I bought my first Christmas album, &quot;Christmas Portrait.&quot;  Since then I have over 30 christmas CD's and &quot;Christmas Portrait&quot; is still the best of them all.  Karen's  warm voice is the very essence of Christmas music.  Though there is not  enough of it on &quot;An Old Fashioned Christmas,&quot; the sound of true  Christmas music still resonates therein.  Standouts include Have yourself a  Merry Little Christmas, Ave Maria, I heard the bells on Christmas day, and  Little Altar Boy.  It has been a long time coming, but it is a joy to have  them both on CD.  Those of us who know the music much too well, will notice  a slight variation of Karen's voice in &quot;Sleigh Ride.&quot;  It sounds  as if to be an alternate recorded take that Richard substituted for this  CD.   Christmas is not Christmas without the music of Karen and Richard.
B000002UA0|4.0|Sloppy psychedelic jams meld with Syd Barret's innocent songs to create an interesting brew. &quot;Bike&quot; is the best Pink Floyd song of all time, old or new. I love the way it is edited together. Syd was a tragic genius,  after whom Pink Floyd went in a different, watered-down, more commercial -  yes, commercial - direction. Shadowy apprentice Waters contributes the song  with the worst title I've ever seen, &quot;Pow.R.To.C.&quot;
630518299X|3.0|The story idea was very original and unique. Carrey's acting is very understated compared to other roles. You really want to root for Truman.
B000002U8G|4.0|For my money, this is the best post-Barrett Pink Floyd album. They have some good riffs and jams, and some mello material, and they put together an almost jazz-like experience. Boring for some listeners, but really pretty  intense.
0790734850|5.0|I don't agree with many critics that L.A.Confidential deserved most of Titanic's oscars, but it definitively is a masterful film that is brilliantly acted (by Spacey, Basinger, Cromwell, DeVito and of course the  two Australians), well written and has a gorgeous art direction.  Goldsmith's music is a winner as well! A must see! Really!
B000002MI4|3.0|This is a noble and bold attempt on Costello's part. Unfortunately, it doesn't work. His voice and those sharp strings add up to a fairly grating experience when taken as a whole. &quot;Taking My Life in Your Hands&quot;  is a good song in any book, though.
0790738074|5.0|Impossibly good and absolutely timeless.  I'm no fuddy-duddy -- I've got everything Nirvana ever recorded -- but the quality here is light years ahead of anything produced today.  The script, casting and songs are  uniformly superb.  Every time I watch this or the Wizard of Oz, I wonder  why on earth they can't make comparable movies today.  A major hoot -- buy  it!
B0000025RI|3.0|Well-produced by Quincy Jones, soulfully sung, and with a number of hit songs, this album rose to become the biggest seller of all time, but mostly on the basis of hype and video images, at a time when idiots were watching  &quot;Alf&quot;, electing Reagan, and twiddling Rubix cubes. It seems dated  now, and it's hard for any album to deserve all the sales this one got.  Young listeners today who weren't around when it came out want nothing to  do with it, as much of it has not endured. I actually prefer &quot;Off the  Wall,&quot; which at least is funky.
B000006ZL4|5.0|If you are into progressive rock, then this CD is a must have for your collection! Several of the songs have Dream Theater-like quality to them while others have more of an Yngwie Malmsteen classical sound. It  definitely rocks! These guys are great musicians. It is a hard CD to get,  but it is definitely worth it. It is without a doubt one of my favorite  CD's of all time. I wish they come back to the U.S.
B0000087QO|4.0|While the lyrics are generally poor, the band can play. This is an exciting and energetic collection of guitar rockers, almost a sort of new wave British invasion style from New York. &quot;Hanging On the  Telephone&quot; &quot;11:59&quot; and &quot;Sunday Girl&quot; stand out for  me in particular, and the guitar/keyboard solo in &quot;Just Go Away&quot;  is a sublime pop moment. Very good fun, highly recommended.
B00000G3PA|4.0|This movie really takes a step past the regular cheesy action-adventure flick.  It has got a great plot, excellent special effects, and a hint of romance to it.  Liv Tyler absolutely makes the movie while Ben Affleck,  Bruce Willis, and the supporting cast do a terrific job of keeping the  viewer on the edge of their seat..
B000002GDJ|4.0|The Police's second album is a little slicker, a little more scintillating. &quot;Message In A Bottle&quot; is still perhaps my favorite Police song, and throughout the album the band kicks ass on some tight  reggae numbers and odd songs.
B0000017CA|5.0|This album is one of my all time favorites.  It displays AB's unique musical style.  Dax Riggs' vocals are absolutely amazing.  His howls are easily as intense as many vocalists in hardcore today and his singing is  somewhere along the lines of Maynard James Keenan from Tool and Layne  Staley from Alice In Chains.  The guitars are crushingly heavy, and AB's  drummer has a very unique approach to his instrument, especially in his  double-bass technique.  AB's late bassist complements the whole of their  sound with chillingly low textures.  Altogether, this is an excellent  album.
0783229321|5.0|Animal House is the best.  Those who have gone to college have lived it.  Who didn't know a Flounder?!  Now on DVD, I had never before seen such a clear picture of the gang.  On the collector's edition with widescreen, you  get to see a lot more of the movie.  However, I wish it also had a full  screen format option so the picture could be bigger (like the standard DVD  edition).  The reunion footage is nice; gives you a good behind the scenes  look at the making of it and you get to see how everyone aged over the  years.  Animal House is a must have addition to any video library.
6305090564|5.0|Action is fast paced and special effects are excellent.  Has the feel of an Indiana Jones adventure with likeble hero and sidekick.  Well worth the price of the DVD
6305169187|5.0|This movie appealed to all different emotions, it made you laugh and cry, it excited you and it frightened you. The movie was all-out wonderful, and soooooo much better than that dumb TITANIC. (Much fewer people die, and  this actually had a plot!)
B000002NHN|5.0|Not better than, but more moving, than Enya.  Gorgeous music.  Incredible lyrics.  Fantastic moods.
6305177473|5.0|This movie was cute for kids and funny for adults. It was actually better than the sixties version, and you can't say that about most movies.
B00000FCBC|5.0|Metallica have worked thier magic on series of already fine songs and made them better. Look out for Astronomy. Amighty fine album for any Tallica fan.
6305077630|3.0|Well ,  it's true : the subject , the title , everything AROUND the movie seem to tell you : &quot;If your 12 or older , don't even think about watching it&quot;. But you would miss something : Weird science is a crazy  movie : Of course , it's  highly unbelievable (2 teenagers create a dream  woman with their computer), but you can't help loving it because ,  exactly  like &quot;Ferris Bueller Day's Off' directed by Jonh Hugues too ,  it  makes you laugh and shows the best moment in life : when you're a teenager  and life's just a game...
0783225857|5.0|Charles Kiselyak has created an eloquent documentary on the making of &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; that begins with a quotation from William Blakes &quot;The Tyger&quot;. This documentary, on DVD, accompanies an  incredibly beautiful print of the film (in digitized form), production  notes, cast and film bios and theatrical trailer. A film buff who journeys  into this DVD with only a passing knowledge  and appreciation of TKAM will  emerge feeling as if he has received a PhD. in this magnificent Alan  Pakula-Robert Mulligan-Horton Foote-Harper Lee collaboration. Elmer  Bernstein's score has never sounded better. Henry Bumstead's meticulously  crafted sets have never been more evocative. The real surprise in this  package is the documentary - containing authentic voices of Monroeville and  scholar Claudia Johnson, as well as appearances from  most of the film's  principle actors. This most enlightening effort is able to perfectly mirror  the original work and its understated majesty. Charles Kiselyak and  Universal have turned the Mockingbird into a Tyger---and its song has never  been sweeter. If you love the novel and the film, you must have this DVD.
6303224644|5.0|I wait until Christmas time each year and sit down to watch it!  No one sings &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas&quot; like Judy! The first time I saw it was late one night when I was about 14 and I just fell  in love! Since then its been a tradition for my mom &amp; I to watch it  every Christmas!
0385040199|5.0|I have read the other reviews for this book. I was struck when I read what other people were saying. I am writing this review to set your thinking into a positive manner.  This diary is a true tale of courage on the  part of members of the Jewish community during one of the worst Anti-semite  rises. This is about Anne's Life, and the lives of six others in a  completely accurate description of Wartime Amsterdam. I was so caught up in  this book that I was awake until Eleven O'Clock every night reading this  Fascinating, inspirational book of Courage under Fire! P.S.- I am a twelve  year old Holocaust buff. This book was not!! found in a concentration Camp,  but in the Hiding annex. Her father Otto found it.
B000006EBK|5.0|No, I'm not getting any kickback from the band, but really, you should check this disc out.  Tommy Bolin really injected some energy into the old dinosaur, and this is coming from a major Blackmore fanatic.  Coverdale's  songwriting has never been so assertive, Hughes really gives up the funk,  and Lord is subdued but on the money nonetheless.  Standout cuts are Lady  Luck, Gettin' Tighter, Drifter, and You Keep on Moving.  Regardless of the  subsequent band dissolution, DP in the studio in '75 kicked more butt than  anyone besides Sabbath.
0060263857|5.0|My six year old grandson has read this so many times that the pages are taped together and I am now ordering a new copy for him.  He loves to read his favorite books over and over and Charlotte's Web is certainly one of  his favorites.
6304490399|5.0|Bruce Brown turns in another winner. Follow the late Steve McQueen through mud, dust and dirt on an unforgettable adventure!
B000000OQY|5.0|I must be the only person alive that fully enjoys this album as a whole.  No doubt that the acoustic B-side is musically fantastic.  But I have also endlessly enjoyed the high-energy roughness of the  live A-side.  Coupled  with Appetite for Destruction, you have a full picture of where these boys  were comming from.
0812550706|3.0|As with some of the other people reviewing this book, I think that the character development was good, especially of the central ones. The net/politics stuff in the middle was a bit weak as was the ending. However,  as Card mentioned in the intro, this title was written as a prelude for the  other books in the series. I think if there was no series, Card might have  spent more time fleshing out a better denouement. <br />I liked the Giant's  drink video game device he used as well as the introductory dialog among  the military commanders. I enjoyed reading the book, but found some of the  expletives and gore distasteful. <br />I think this is a good book to rent  from the library and read while working out, on a plane, etc. I don't think  I would read it again. As Card mentioned in the intro, he tried to make the  story clear enough so that anyone could understand it. To that effect, I  think he was somewhat successful. The result of his decision, however, is  for little replay value in this novel.
B00000FCBC|5.0|Dear Metallica, please don't stop here, more, more, please............ This two CD album is well thought of and put together. As soon as I put on either disc, I dare not stop as the music set-up puts me in a trance. A lot  of out there who don't like this album, stop being greedy. You've had a lot  of good stuff from Metallica over the years. Now sit back to either  appreciate the alternative stuff they are doing or shut up. MET ROCKS  ...........
B000005RSW|5.0|Perhaps this is the best Manowar production. This music is a marvellous gods song after battles into glory ride.
0517122707|5.0|This book is my very favorite book ever.  It makes me laugh so hard every time i read it.  For the people who don't like this book because the characters are obnoxious, I think that is weak criticism .  Most of the  people in great literature and most entertainers in general would not be  welcome in my house -- it's their broad and outlandish behavior that makes  them entertainers, not friends.  But their flaws often, as here, create a  hilarious comment on an individual's &quot;worldviews&quot;, as Ignatius  would say.  I have given this book to numerous people and almost everyone  thought it was absolutely hilarious.  Of course, there is no work of art  that is going to please everyone.
B000003TBP|5.0|I beg you for the love of eveything which is holy, just buy this damn cd and enjoy it.  Anyone that follows this recomendation--- there is no need to thank me.  Thank the enchanting wizard of rythm.
6305076626|5.0|RHPS is the best movie in creation.  Little Nell steals the spotlight in this movie like no one else can.  I must say that no person will get all this movie has to offer unless they go and see it live in a theatre with  other RHPS fans, but at home on video is still fun too.
B00000DHRZ|4.0|I really enjoyed the new Offspring album &quot;Americana&quot;.  I would have given it a rating of a 5 stars, but I do not believe that this is their best album.  Personally, I believe this is only the 4th best album  offspring has came out with yet.  For the people that thought this album  was hilariously comical should probably check all the songs on the cd.   Offspring, though silly at times, usually portray pretty strong messages  through their music.  Anywhere from 1-3 songs on all of their albums posess  some good humor on them.  Offspring's &quot;Inxnay on the Hombre&quot;,  &quot;Smash&quot;, and &quot;Offspring&quot; were all better albums than  this one.  Still, I cannot forget to give props to the best punk rock band  in the history of rock-n-roll, Offspring has done it again.  Offspring  still has many more years ahead of them if they keep up at the rate that  they're going.
6305229449|5.0|Although this movie may not be historically accurate, it certainly provides a high level of entertainment for the family.  It also shows that women need not take secondary roles in important historical events such as  war.  Mulan teaches us that we can achieve our dreams if we really want to,  provided that we have the determination and desire.
0446605409|4.0|This was my first Demille book.  It was seemed to be a little drawn out at first; however, that impression could have been due to the fact that I read it late at night.  Entertaining without heaviness--a good, unexpected  bedtime laugh. The characters were very entertainig.  The only trouble was  morning fatigue when the alarm sounded.
B000002BE9|5.0|This album is so extraordinary.  At first when you listen to it, it seems dark and dreary, but when the words and the meaning sinks in, you get a whole new perspective on the album.  It's something you could listen to  over and over and get something else out of it each time, and yet never get  tired of it.  It will be hard for Fiona Apple to top this album.
0767812417|5.0|Oliver! I saw this movie at a formative age and was moved on many levels.  Ron Moody's Oscar winning portrayal of Fagan, the seedy old rat of the pick pocket school, was superb. To see him singing and dancing across the sewers  of Dickens's London was worth much more than the price of admission.<br />The  song and dance number of \\"Who Will Buy\\" was truly inspired bit of  choreography. It somehow ineffably portrays the dance of life in almost  cosmic proportions.<br />A truly beautiful film.
6303109950|5.0|I'll admit I really enjoy westerns so perhaps I'm a bit biased, but this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  It has all the action you could ever ask for and a bit of humor as well.  I haven't met anyone who  didn't think this was a great movie.
B000000OSW|5.0|The most dissapointing thing about US is that UP (his next CD) has to follow it. I doubt he can succeed this CD.
6300181340|4.0|A film for anyone who grows tired of the normal &quot;blood everywhere/constant attack&quot; movies.  This Hitchcock masterpiece manages to frighten and terrify audiences without forcing it.  If you've  already seen Psycho and want some more, than this is the movie for you.   Though not the factual institute Psycho was, an easy second for Hitchcock's  best.
0451524985|5.0|One can learn so much from Lawrence's wonderful sense of feminine intuition about people, love, circumstance, politics, environment and the choices humans make, that one read of this book is simply not enough.   Personally, I have read this book eight or nine times (usually once a  year)and never tire of Lawrence's insight into human nature and why we do  the things we do.  Don't let the title fool you.  This book is much less  about sex than it is about us taking charge of our own destiny and not  letting the machinery of life bog us down.  If you are at a crossroads in  your life, you must read this book.  If not, you will still enjoy this  novel greatly.  It is highly recommended.  If I could, I would give it ten  stars!
B000002BYD|5.0|I got into Pearl Jam after the hype had started to die down (after &quot;Vs.&quot;) and this band continues to amaze me. Without exception, &quot;Yield&quot; is their best effort yet. I have not taken this CD out of  my player since it was released. They managed to evolve their style once  again and the sound is a little more fast and loose. And yes, even a little  bit of humor (albeit highly sarcastic) is found. I loved the Hallelujiah  chorus in &quot;Do The Evolution&quot;.  I buy PJ CDs the day they are  released becasue I never know what they will produce next (like thier  mentor Neil Young) and I am always willing to go in the new directions they  take. &quot;Yield&quot; was overwhelmingly good.
6305078564|5.0|Having seen this program on tv in Reykjavk, we could not wait until owning own copy. The book was excellent and this dvd disk gives it full credit. The story gives an insight into the live of the gentry on this  period and I belive catches the spirit of the times. I would recommend this  movie to anyone. The quality of the presentation on disk is superior to the  VHS and this is definately the future medium for home video library.
0517122707|5.0|Not since Vonnegut's &quot;Player Piano&quot; has there been such a dead on, satirical commentary on the American way of life.  Toole's New Orleans characters are deftly crafted; comically absurd but not cartoonish. His  masterpiece is Ignatius T. Reilly, a bloated, pseudo-intellectual gas bag,  who pontificates endlessly about the evils of society while consuming vast  quantities of junk food and pulp entertainment. Equally interesting is  Jones, a chain smoking, hip talking, black man struggling desperately to  stay on the right side of the jail cell door by maintaining a janitor  position in a seedy strip club.  Most entertaining for me was Jones' manner  of expression; a dialectic and animated version of street talk that  contained absolute nuggets of truth.
B000005HCM|5.0|Lee Morgan, Joe Henderson, Barry Harris, Bob Crenshaw, and Billy Higgins come together to help create one of Hard-bop's finest moments in time. With provocative phrasing and innovative technique Morgan shows why he is the  best in Hard-bop trumpeting. Picking up where he left off in the Jazz  messengers, Morgan continues to bring the blues influence back to the  foreground in Jazz. In the tracks &quot;Gary's Notebook&quot;, &quot;Boy,  What A Night&quot;, and &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; Morgan defines what was to  be known as the Hard-bop sound. Easily one the ten best Jazz albms of all  time. An essential album in every Jazz fan's collection.

0792151712|3.0|I was one of the few people in the world who did not see the movie in a theatre but on video.  Being a fan of science fiction and of James Cameron, (I love the Terminator 1 &amp; 2)I was not disappointed with the special  effects.  The Titanic sinking is the only thing that I mentally took away  from the movie.  Everything else was not &quot;GREAT&quot; as everyone  calls it.  The love story and acting was not enough to carry the film  which, thank God, James may have figured out which is why it has some great  special effects.  I definitely would not recommend this movie to true movie  lovers who value movies based on story, characters and the actors  performances.  After all, does anyone recall any of the actors winning an  Oscar or for that matter, the screenplay?
0399143904|1.0|If this book doesn't take you back to GI Action Series comics of the 50s, nothing will. This is about as 2-dimensional and dumb of story as you will find in your airport's bookstore. And that includes the romance novels.  Clancy's bad-boys tote the 10mm MP-10, which Clancy seems to have an infatuation with, and &quot;double-tap&quot; all the bad guys. Even when he  kills a little sick child at an amusement park, his macho boys write it off  as &quot;well, she was gonna die of cancer in a week anyhow.&quot; Give it  a rest. Do us a favor, make your testosterone overloaded characters do  somthing realistic, like turn the guns on each other, and remove the  woman-bashing prose.
0684830485|5.0|This was the first book by Hemmingway that I ever read.  I was enthralled at his style of writing and development of character.  He has a very plain, honest manner of stating the reality that is overlooked either  intentionally or unintentionally.  For Whom The Bell Tolls is a book to be  read and remembered.
B00000DC10|5.0|Those familiar with Refused will enjoy this.  It is a much more complex record than &quot;Songs to Fan the Flame of Discontent&quot;.  This disc has the familiar Refused rockers and then expands with some very new sounds  (as in New Noise).  At times, I wondered if I was really listening to  Refused, but that was a good experience for me.  Those familiar with the  Nation of Ulysses will make the conncetions between the concept of this  album and NOU's own style.  Those unfamiliar with NOU will find this a very  refreshing shape of punk to come.  It reminded me of NOU in terms of the  concept and writings, but the sound is wholly new and refreshing, an  excellent record.
B000006MV8|5.0|Produced by the likes of George Harrison and Todd Rundgren, this disc exemplifies the outstanding talent that Badfinger possessed, circa 1971-72 (at the band's peak).  One of the most telented (and tragic -- two suicides  of four members) bands of this era.  Too bad they never came out from under  the shadow of the Beatles, whose Apple Records first signed them in 68 or  69 (perhaps the media never let them do so).

0679457313|5.0|as ammu says....  people tend to like things they can identify with.<br />this excruciatingly beautiful tale seems so heartfelt that one cannot help but suspect that it is born from the dark recesses of the  author's closet.  it is hard to beleive that this book has been so  commercially successful in the west, for a large part of what is said can  only be felt and appreciated by someone native or one with an intimate  knowledge and feel of india, or rather the specific community and religion;  though the broad theme itself can be deemed universal.  A great number of  instances in the book are frighteningly similar to the brown stink that goes on in  my family in india; the character of rahel is someone whom i most certainly  can identify with- in the nature of her mom ammu, the boarding school i  went to, coming to the US, the floating around in architecture  school-brrr......( excuse me for bringing myself into the review). well,  the point is that this book is especially intimate and meaningful to  me.<br />the prose is stunningly refreshing(though it takes a few pages to get  used to) and manages to accurately and cheekyly capture the quirkiness of  spoken indian-english, not to mention the vivid potrayal of the landscape  and culture.  roy's first novel is  strong, bold, explicit, uncompromising  and engrossing. a fine work of storytelling ( not just for a first attempt)
B00000DHTF|5.0|If you have listen music from the Boss this is then a complete story of his music. Real relaxing to hear this.

0380973634|5.0|Captivating and realistic...almost had me believing that there really is a London Below...
B000001F6N|4.0|It's amazing so few people know about John Mayall.  All you need to look at is a list of famous musicians that have played in his groups.  This album has John McVie of Fleetwood Mac on bass for example.  If you like the  basic blues, then you have to like this recording.
0783228600|5.0|What is wrong with you lame people? Don't you understand what's going on? ANSWER ME!!! Leave this planet and go and watch Top Gun. You are obviously all puritans of the highest degree. We all know books and films are totally  different mediums and should be viewed without prejudice. It's no good  being elitist and dropping into the conversation 'Oh, it's not half as good  as the book'. Most people can read, so for all of those who haven't read  it, go buy it, then watch the movie and form your own opinion.
6300246787|4.0|For Streisand fans, this is probably her best comedy and singing work next to What's Up Doc w/Ryan O'neil. She plays Dolly Levi a bit &quot;Mae Westish&quot;, but it works beautifully with the rest of the marvelous  supporting cast.  The wide-screen version &lt;if you can find it on TV&gt;  is a bit more enjoyable as the musical numbers tend to fill the screen and  are virtually lost in pan-and-scan. Also, to correct the reviewer who wrote  that Tommy Tune worked for Horace Vandergeller&quot; (Matthau).  He did  NOT. Tune (Ambrose Kemper)played the love interest of Vandergeller's neice,  Ermengarde. The taller of Vandergeller's assistants (Cornelius Hackl) was  played by Michael Crawford, who later became the famous &quot;Phantom of  the Opera&quot; on Broadway.  It's facinating to see how much his voice  improved since 1969.  The CD has been digitally re-mastered and is a joy to  listen to now.  Most consider it the last big-budget musical from  Hollywood... it shows, too!
0783226063|5.0|Lynch turned an epic novel into an epic film. The special effects are truly amazing. I would say this is one of the 10 best sci-fi flicks of all time.
0399143904|2.0|The plot was a little too contrived and too far fetched to be belivable.  Some of the stuff sounded like it came from a Mac Bolan story.  I think Clancy is resting on his laurels.
B000002H33|5.0|Who can beat this masterpiece? Great!!!!!!! If you are a metal fan, buy this stuff, and then try Load, Reload. I bet you will hate the two garbageS.   Oh, Mr.Hetfield. Please, come back to your old-Metallica(TRUE  METALLICA) days.
B000001ZS8|5.0|This is Jarre's most innovative album. Although Oxygene and Equinoxe represent his true style Zoolook actually has real acoustic drums and a real bass guitar!! It's very funky, avant garde and brilliant. The sound  recording is as always top!
0399143904|4.0|Rainbow Six was altogether an awesome book, there were some problems though. The first team was always used, but when they used the second one something happened, but I can't say. I haven't finished the whole thing but  its filled with excitement page after page!
6304480415|5.0|The CinemaScope version (visually dark with no pep whatsoever) was used for general release and video release up until three years ago, when it was retired and a new process was able to convert the TODD-AO version to video.   This is the one that is now available for purchase - and there's a world  of difference.  This is far brighter, with far fresher and more exuberant  performances (remember, that the Scope version was filmed only after the  TODD-AO &quot;take&quot; was in the can - of course performers were tired  and the sun had gone in for most of the shots).   A world of difference  between this definitive version and the tired Scope version.   Main Title  is totally different for each version, plus there are a few different scene  set ups, one of two shots in the TODD-AO version not in the Scope version,  and some totally different line deliveries (Ado Annie's &quot;HELLo,  Will&quot; in the Scope and her &quot;heLLO, WILL&quot; in the TODD-AO.   This is a fine achievement, a classic musical play and a classic film. At  the end of its 2-1/2 hours, your face hurts from smiling.
B000002LKF|5.0|After recording several Brazillian drum tracks, themselves representing a lively mix of cultures, Simon went back to New York and added some West African guitars while he got around to the business of actually writing the  songs around what was already recorded. This is an unusually organic method  of creating, and Simon pulls it off. &quot;The Cool, Cool Water&quot; is a  monumental song, as are the title song, &quot;Spirit Voices&quot;,  &quot;Born at the Right Time,&quot; &quot;The Obvious Child&quot;,  &quot;The Coast&quot;... His lyrics muse doesn't fail him in this oddly  reflective, almost prayerful collection.
B000001FS3|5.0|It's almost all been said already, but I have to add my two cents' worth. This album is one of the soundtracks to my life, quite possibly my favourite album of all time, and U2's greatest. &quot;Streets&quot; is  maybe U2's most inspiring song, and it sends me insane with joy every time  I hear it. But the great songs just keep coming and coming--&quot;With Or  Without You,&quot; &quot;Running to Stand Still,&quot; &quot;One Tree  Hill,&quot; &quot;Mothers&quot;...It can be listened to from beginning to  end, over and over, and it never pales...in fact, the listener will  probably keep making new discoveries. I have a hard time believing that  there is anyone out there who loves music and who could not relate to at  least some of this album.
B000002UAR|5.0|There had never been an album quite like Revolver before, and there hasn't really been since. There is an electric thrill of discovery and studio experimentation about it, the likes of which is sorely missed today. The  sheer variety of styles and sounds is fascinating. The spiritual, the  silly, the serious, the fantastic, the happy, the melancholy, the sublime,  and the imaginative combine in a sparkling pageant of damn good songs, damn  good recordings, and well, what can I say? It's damn good!
0780624890|5.0|I got the Blade DVD on yesterday and was once again laid waste by all the extremely well choreographed fight scenes!  additionally, Wesley was just way too cooooool as the vampire hunter BLADE!  All in all a very good and  amusing romp through a generally stereotypical genre.  It's about time we  had a hero like Blade to root for!!
0783225199|5.0|Most of the humor in what could have been a low-brow plunge is actually quite sophisticated. Cameos by musical greats enliven this exciting story of two bad boys who try to save a church by making money with their band.  The car chase at the end is the best I've ever seen, and I'm none too fond  of car chases. Surprisingly good film.
0790729644|5.0|Eastwood after decades in the business still has staying power in the business. With a strong supporting cast of heavy weights and new talent, Clint Eastwood demonstrates that substance is still in style. Eastwood  plays the part of William Munny to perfection. The last ten minutes of this  movies lines have &quot;classic&quot; written all over it.
0792140923|4.0|This is actually quite a depressing story about what has gone wrong in America over the past few decades, but the agreeable Hanks survives it all somehow, with a few moments of humor. Mostly I feel drained after seeing  this.
6301963717|3.0|It's the 1920s in a big, corrupt city controlled by gangsters. Violence, stupidity, backstabbing and greed are everywhere. There are beatings, shootings, burnings, and broken glass. It's always dark, even during the  day. Anyone who doesn't end up dead ends up unhappy.
0792151712|2.0|Want to see sappy teenagers drown? Want to sit through hours of melodrama and then see terrible tragedies? Want to see how much a studio can spend?
078061755X|3.0|This is based on the life of David Helfgott, an Australian piano prodigy who escaped the stifling influence of his strange, domineering father to attend the Royal College of Music in London. Apparently he was always  eccentric, but his career was cut short by a mysterious seizure that turned  him into a chain-smoking, shuffling, manic-mumbling, confused person who  spent years institutionalized. Eventually he wandered into a piano bar and  was re-discovered.<BR>
B00000DGUG|5.0|I read another review by someone who is Bipolar and thinks Alanis is too. I don't know if she is or not, but I am and maybe thats why even at my advanced age of 53 I love her music. Something in in her music really moves  me. She touches me inside and expresses what I sometimes have a hard time  doing. I was eagerly awaiting this album's release and I have not been  disappointed. I love it and already have many favorites.
0156907399|5.0|Those of you interested in an engaging plot should, in general, shy away from Virginia Woolf. _Lighthouse_ is an exquisite novel that explores the minds of its characters. In fact, it is only through the thoughts of one  character that the reader learns about another. The culmination of this can  easily be seen during the dinner in the first section. Gorgeous, and as  Welty says &quot;ethereal&quot; prose throughout. Techniques like the flow  of time in the second section are what truly amaze me about Woolf's  writing.
B000001FI7|5.0|I wouldn't want every album to sound like this, but I find this one excels at what it does; placating that inner angster when it waxes restless in it's longing for companionable art.  Full of quirky, thoughtful twists, the  music is nonetheless highly restrained in order to allow Beth's thin, sad,  beautiful voice the prominent place in the mix.  This CD makes me think  vaguely of a more reflective 'Tool' or less dauntless 'Bjork'.  Conclusive  musical statements are not abundant, but the approachability factor is  correspondingly high.  This poisoned arrow is aimed at your heart more than  your cognitive centers.  Bull's eye.  I regard it as a cathartic  yearn-along which fills a void in my CD collection that I hadn't even  realized was there.
6305169187|5.0|I didn't want to see this movie at first becuase I find things like this very depressing. I mean it really could happen one day, but my best friend got me to watch it with since it has become her favorite movie. It started  out with immediate action that didn't stop until the very end. This movie  was as touching and action packed as a movie can be. If you don't have an  imagination don't watch movies at all. The fact that it was not always  realistic actually made it FUN. Since watching this movie with my friend it  has become my favorite. To all those out there that hated this movie. Get  an imaginatio and/or qute griping. It bad enough having (so-called)   &quot;proffesionals&quot; puting so many movies down that we don't need you  also.
6302038308|5.0|It's interesting to see how the Evil Dead series progresses from pure horror (Evil Dead 1) to slapstick humor (Army of Darkness.  Evil Dead 2 is a midpoint, and as a result is a perfect union of horror, comedy, and  brilliantly implemented one-liners.  If you don't own this video, buy it.  For eight bucks you can get one of the greatest cult flicks ever made.  Groovy.
B000002C1Z|5.0|Of all the Pink Floyd albums, this one seems to get the least amount of attention. &quot;Animals&quot; is a masterpiece musically and especially lyrically, showcasing Roger Waters' incredible cutting edge songwriting.  Though Waters wrote nearly all the songs, the entire band shines in their  playing. Richard Wright's eerry opening organ on &quot;Pigs ( Three  Different Ones ) &quot; sets the stage for a crunching guitar attack by  David Gilmour and a cracking drum beat by Nick Mason, all supporting the  firey bite of Roger Waters angry singing. Even more so than &quot;The  Wall&quot;, &quot;Animals&quot; best displays Waters' visionary writing  which sadly began to slip into the silly after &quot;The Wall&quot;.  Although the album has only five songs, every one of them is great,  especially the Gilmour-co written &quot;Dogs&quot;, which contains his best  ever guitar solo. Even if your only a moderate Pink Floyd fan, don't pass  up &quot;Animals&quot;, its one of their best.
080012166X|5.0|Well, what can I say about this film.....or let me put it another way, what can't I say.  Its got Gary Oldman (brilliant), Winona Ryder (very pleasant), Sadie Frost (phwoaaar!), that Keanu chap (errr, well) and the  rather good Anthony Hopkins as the baddie.<br />Its a love story of course but  with a difference and a real weepie.....I'm serious !!<br />Enough of the film  though, we all know how good it is.  This is the DVD review.  So, you  haven't got a DVD player yet ?  Well here is the best reason to get one.   This film just sparkles and the soundtrack is just amazing.  It won awards  for the sound, so go and listen.  You will be absorbed in such ambience and  feeling that you will want to watch again AND again AND....well you get the  message !<br />Buy it !!!<br />ps I didn't but someone special bought it for me  and that makes it even better :)
0380730405|5.0|This has been and will always be my favorite book of all time!  It is an incredible love story and is very suspenseful along with vivid descriptions and an amazing twisting plot.  I love it!
0790739909|5.0|This is one of the rare movies that I just couldn't stop thinking about.  This movie has it all---romance, tragedy, comedy, great acting and great directing.  Although I think Ryan and Cage could do pretty well on their  own direction.  I really didn't think I would like this movie when I rented  it.  Now I can't wait to own a copy.
6304675348|5.0|it was excellent with all the plot twists and the hip new characters its definetly a must see for any horror fans.it just proves that movies can create physcos and its not impossible for this sort of thing to happen its  very real and scary but as billy would say&quot;dont blame the movies  movies dont create physcos movies make physcos more creative&quot;so sit  down take a few notes have some fun.
B00000BKI4|5.0|Mercury Rev have decided to do something American bands (Beastie Boys not included) have not done since Nirvana.  They became &quot;creative&quot;...and the results are nothing less than perfect.   Never before has an album sounded so delicate, fragile, and  utterly...beautiful.  From the opener &quot;Holes&quot; to the final stomp  on &quot;Delta bottleneck Stomp&quot;, Mercury Rev take you on a melodic  journey through every stage of human emotion illuminated against a wall of  vintage American music.  Everything from christams carols to  neo-psychedelia is covered.  The album's only flaw is that it is way too  short.  Forty Five minutes does not cover it.  You are left like Pavlov's  Dog salivating for more.  If you buy one album this year make sure it's  Deserter Songs.  If not buy Jay-Z or the Spice Girls because that's what  you deserve to listen to.
6300151379|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Your fantasies and fears, dreams and hopes will all be played out for you in this innocent film.  The value of true friends and family ties are all beautifully illustrated,  often leaving the first-time viewer in joyful tears at the end.  A must  have for any movie collection.
B000002UVZ|4.0|This is not the best R.E.M. album ever, and anyone who argues otherwise is not thinking clearly. Still, that doesn't make it bad. It set up the band for their future success, and the album has its share of deliciously  sublime moments. [ My personal favorites are the delicate &quot; The  Flowers Of Guatemala &quot; and &quot; Swan Swan H &quot;. ] The album has  no real &quot; what were they thinking? &quot; songs, although &quot;  Underneath The Bunker &quot; toes that line and would cross it if it wasn't  treated the way it is. Don't ignore this album, but don't buy it if you  aren't at least fond of the rest of their work.
6305232660|4.0|OK...If you haven't seen Deep Impact or Armageddon, here's the criteria for deciding between the two (more than likely, you will like one and hate the other). Armageddon:  buy this if you have no concept of science or  current space technologies.  On top of that, if you like action but not  acting....this is your flick. Deep Impact:  buy this if you want a thought  provoking experience.  Sure, it has some faults but the movie works at many  levels for many different viewers.  It shows women in positions of power in  the media...it preaches the merit, wisdom, and resolve of older people  (Duvall), it addresses family relations, alcoholism, young love, and  foremost, they portray an African-American as president of the United  States (bravo).  However, as a devout follower of world unity and  consciousness....I don't know what to make about all the religious  references.  Steven Spielberg and his consortium at DreamWorks are  very clever and smart...is there an agenda at work here?  Pay attention.
B000002NJS|5.0|These new sounds of Madonna's are absolutely inspirational.  Rather than the usual pop cords we're used to listening to, this album is infused with potent beats that are the symbol of traditional Indian music.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This was the first radiohead CD I ever bought. Like all of their CDs I have bought since then, it took time to start liking it. AT first I was very disapointed. But after a few days I became obbsessed with it,  listening to it repeatedly. Finnally I got Pablo Honey and The Bends, and  now several bootlegs as well. This group is really amazing, and hearing  what they did before this masterpeice is really interesting too. In a  hundred years, people will remember Beethoven, The Beatles, and Radiohead.
B000002HPV|5.0|Although many fans may find that Bjork's lastest album a complete divurgence from her earlier works, Homogenic shows that Bjork has reached her pinnacle of musical maturity.  The first track, Hunter subtlely sets  the mood for the rest of the album with her eternal quest of the intangible  emotion that drives us to seek what we don't already have.  The second  track, Joga, fraught with melodious pain, serves as an excellent  introduction to the third track of lost love, Unravel (my favorite track).   The segue of Unravel flows into Bachlorette, a phenomenonal arrangement of  music, lyrics and Bjork's exquisite voice.  Alarm Call, the eighth track, a  fun and uplifting song is juxtaposed with the harsh yet enervating ninth  track, Pluto.  All the tension and discord is resolved in the last track,  All is Full of Love.  This album deserves a serious listen and my highest  recommendation.
B000002GG0|4.0|Foreigner has one of Cat's best and sexiest songs, Later, and the interesting Foreigner Suite,which has great melodies and great drumming, and also some over-emotional Cat wailing.  A must for any Cat fan, it is  not as hard-edged as Catch Bull, but not as sweet as Tillerman.
6300182193|5.0|Having never seen Langella's Broadway characterization, I cannot compare them.  Having seen every other movie version Dracula I possibly could, however, Langella is the embodiment of the attraction of evil.  He looks  the part, he acts the part.  Those eyes, those eyes....Bela finally met his  match. A supporting cast of his caliber would have been wonderful.  But for  me, the fiery love scene could not have been handled any better. The man is  totally sexy just as Dracula is totally sexy.  I have it in my library to  heat up those long and dreary winter nights.
B0000024SI|5.0|This is one of the difinitive rock albums.  If you can appreciate good music then you will love this album.  You cannot find a list of the greatest rock albums without this listed in the top 25.  Dylan is the  greatest songwriter of the era, and the fact that so many have re-made his  songs only pays tribute to his greatness.  If you are not intrigued by this  album, then you don't know the first thing about music.
B00000DMJF|5.0|Rock'n'Roll is still waiting for the next step
0790737302|5.0|THIS MOVIE TOUCHED MY HEART, MIND, AND SOUL. THE ABILITY TO RELATE WITH IT ON SO MANY LEVELS WAS INCREDIBLE. THIS IS MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF ALL TIMES. MY LIFE, MY LOVE, AND MY PAIN REFLECTED BACK TO ME THROUGH THIS FILM.  DEFINATELY A MUST SEE MOVIE FOR ANYONE WHO HAS BEEN, HOPES TO BE, OR IS IN  SEARCH OF THEIR TRUE LOVE AND SOULMATE!
6305232660|5.0|I agree with a recent reviewer, it should've been extended.  Some people might be saying, &quot;WHAT?!?&quot;, but it was too tight for just 2 hours.  It should've been about 1 hr. longer, but all in all, a great  action/drama!  I will definitely be getting this for DVD, 'cause I plan on  watching it over &amp; over again.  Maybe someone will write an addition to  the script so she can add extra footage to make it better.
B000006OAM|3.0|After being forced to listen to 10,000 Manics when my freshman college roommate played it over and over again years ago, I have since developed quite a devotion to them and Natalie Merchant solo. In fact, it changed my  music preferences entirely from R&amp;B to alternative/modern rock/lilith  fair-type of stuff.  I will forever love Merchant with 10K, with all the  rich varieties of instruments, rhythms, and subject matter. Ophelia,  however, lacks that creative variety in several ways; though she has  expanded the repertoire of instuments, the rhythms and subject matter have  tunneled. Previously, the subject matter held commentary and criticism of  our society on numerous issues such as unplanned pregnancies, child abuse,  racism, television, and even the California Gold Rush.  Now, there seems to  be only preachable material which I find more depressing than ingenious and  satirical as sung.<br />The album is good. Make no mistake in buying it, but I  believe it lacks the imbuming effect of In My Tribe, These Are the Days,  and even Tigerlily. However, I recently had the chance to see her perform  live, and the music from Ophelia is best presented and heard this way,  unfortunately.<br />And no lyrics in the jacket? Big mistake because though  Merchant continues to enrichen her voice like wine over the years, she  lacks the eloquent pronounciation of her earlier days.  I even had trouble  understanding her live performance when I thought this would be the best  opportunity to learn what she was actualy saying. (And I couldn't blame it  on the sound system either.)  I've seen her preformances on TV and I still  can't quite make out the lyrics, which is I think very important to the  appreciation of her music and artistry. Regardless though, her melodies are  still felt emotionally and even enough for me to enjoy the album, since I  never memorize the correct lyrics anyways.  But I think most people mind.   Please, Ms Merchant, I love your voice, your lyrics, andI would hang on  every word you sing/say if only I could decifer them.
0375403477|3.0|Tom Clancy has always impressed me with his attention to detail and what I thought was excellent research.  However I note (as many other fellow readers have) that his research is off somewhat in this book.  As far as I  know Hereford does not have a landing strip for aircraft and as a  shareholder in British Telecom I know it is not owned by the British  Government! I trust Mr Clancy's work will be more informed next time  otherwise I will have to look elsewhere for techno-thrillers.
0440219078|5.0|I really think this book is one of the finest Lois Lowery has written. She is an unbelieveable author who really puts it all into her work....you can tell.  This book was read to me in 5th grade  by my teacher and I have  fallen in love with it. And no, my teenage mind is not corrupt from &quot;  An adult book disguised as a children's book&quot; ( as in a previous  review)  I could handle the subjects in this book when I was 10, and I  think this book has made me realize how lucky we all are, and what we have  that makes this world so special. True, it's a little boring at the beginng  (I'll admit to that- I would fall asleep with my head on the desk), but  believe me, the reward of a good book you can't stand to put down is worth  waiting for.
B00000DD1S|3.0|When I saw these sessions had been reissued, I pulled out the 2-record set on which they had first been released, the 1978 ABC Impulse album The Dedication Series Vol. VII: The Village Concerts, and listened to it again.  While I love Ayler's quavery, gospel-tinged tone, his technical limitations  ultimately get in his way, and he ends up treading a very narrow stylistic  path. The songs never really develop, and when Ayler is not playing the  other musicians seem lost. For a better example of free tenor playing mixed  with a solid command of the instrument, check out Sam Rivers' trio release  in this same reissue series.
6305127638|5.0|After having been captured by the borg in one of the Star Trek: Next Generation TV episodes the Borg are after Star Fleet, and Captin Piccard, in this 8th installment of the popular film series. This film being the  highest grossing off all Trek movies is the directorial debut of  &quot;Number 1&quot; AKA Jonathan Franks. Who combines the intriging and  twisting story line with out of this world special effects and incredible  Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound. A must have for any Trekkie or those in  search of a high quality fast-past action movie.
0679460063|3.0|This was my first time ever reading anything by Patricia Cornwell. Being a high school student I thought that the book wouldn't keep my interest for very long...well I was right. The book in my opinion started off quite slow but as the plot progressed it became a little more interesting. I wish I  could say I read it in a matter of days, but the truth is it took me a  Little bit longer. I had to read the book in sections because some parts  just wasn't doing it for me. The ending was a little disappointing but did  provide some closer. Aside from the technical drivel and totally gruesome  descriptions, I'd say it was a book.
6304436408|5.0|Maybe my favorite part was the facial expressions in this movie.  Just a little subtle and sometimes not-so-subtle extra effect.  It was so well-acted and well-written that I have to buy my own copy, and I don't do  that with many movies... in fact 3 in my whole life!    Loved the story,  loved the casting, loved the costumes, loves the scenery, loved the  dialogue.  Guess you can tell it's one of my favorites.
B000002BQK|4.0|This CD is alright. &quot;Breakdown&quot;, &quot;The Roof&quot; and &quot;Honey&quot; are my favorite songs on the album, but I haven't even really listened to all the songs on the album.. I guess I don't really care  too.. anyway, the cd's alright. Smooth family out
0800184327|5.0|I saw this movie six times! I will definately buy the video and have already bought the CD.  It has everything: drama, romance, humor, delightful character acting, and all without violence, bad language, or raw  sex.  Treat yourself to a good movie experience!
0316743003|5.0|A wonderful story of Mr. Rich's experiences at the Skunk Works both as director and as an engineer under Kelly Johnson. <br />   Mr. Rich's respect for Kelly Johnson is obvious, but Mr. Rich also describes his strong  disagreements with Johnson, particularly the conflict over building the  Stealth fighter. <br />    This is the book that I had always hoped would be  written about the Skunk Works ever since I first saw an SR-71.
0449911357|5.0|I stayed up late finishing this book, usually something I only do for thrillers and mysteries.  What an incredible story.  This book touches so many subjects with wit and humor, and is so inspiring.  I haven't seen the  movie, but I can't imagine any movie doing the book justice.
6303617719|4.0|Critics who were lukewarm about French Kiss failed to place it as a Doris Day/Rock Hudson update.  Kevin Kline's combination of wit and vulgar good humor contrasts with the Rock Hudson emotional monotone.  Meg Ryan is  overtly sexy, compared with Doris Day's closet sex appeal, but both are the  nice-girl-nextdoor-you'd like to go out with.  It's the perfect straight up  Doris Day/Rock Hudson revision for the '90's.  (If you want an update with  Doris Day and Rock Hudson laughing at themselves and each other, then you  need John Cleese and Jamie Lee Curtis.)
0792835980|5.0|The Philadelphia Story is a fabulous filming of Katharine Hepburn's Broadway triumph, and was famous for several reasons; first, it returned Hepburn to Hollywood, after she had been declared 'Box Office Poison'; it gave Jimmy Stewart his only 'Best Actor' Oscar (albeit it was probably a consolation award for losing for Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, in 1939); and it further solidified the Cary Grant screen persona as a worldly and wise bon vivant (a move begun by directors Howard Hawks and George Cukor in the late '30s), playing a character which would fit Grant so well that he would continue playing variations of it for the next 25 years! In watching this sparkling comedy, note the wonderful supporting cast, particularly Ruth Hussey, as Stewart's partner (in an underrated performance...she is very good!) and Roland Young (the original 'Topper') as Hepburn's uncle. While the film is a bit static (and occasionally heavy with 'smart' dialogue that doesn't age well), there are so many comic gems that it's difficult to quibble. Hepburn is remarkably sexy as the 'once-and-future' bride, and it's easy to see why Grant, Stewart, and John Howard would all want her. While it's social classes subtext may seem a bit dated, today, the theme of a woman rediscovering the man who truly loves her is universal, and makes The Philadelphia Story a timeless joy!
6305169187|4.0|Bruce is not one of my favorites and the concept is a bit hokey. That said, prepare yourself for a pretty good film. Special effects are superb and there is a more than a few warm moments. The ending is predictable but  still very touching.
B000002OOY|5.0|I thought it was great music that everyone should hear! I give the score and the movie 5 stars! No wonder it won oscars!
0800184327|5.0|What a great clean entertaining movie.I really, really enjoyed it. I felt like dancing in the theater both times I saw it. Enjoyed the soundtrack and I'm impatiently waiting for the release of the video. FUN! Fun! FUN!
6303921248|5.0|jane Austen's masterpiece, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; is transormed into film beatifully.  Every performance is exceptional especially the actor who portrays Miss Benet.
8401426715|5.0|I have never read a book that was developed so perfectly.  Unlike, the great philosophers, Hesse has the ability to use simple language to express ideas that unfold the meaning of life, and the struggles we have in our  hearts and minds.<br />You may be surprised at what Siddhartha determines is  the most importnant thing in life.  Everyone should be able to relate at  some point to the various paths Siddhartha takes.<br />This book can challenge  and humble, yet it brings you to peace with yourself and the world around  you.<br />This book is quick to read and highly entertaining, but very though  provoking.  In my opinion, it is a must!
0451191153|5.0|The underlying philosophy of The Fountainhead, masterly conveyed by Ayn Rand through the plot-theme and her characters, showed me man and life as they ought to be.
B00000AFWW|4.0|but this album is still really cool. All of the songs are good - I just wish that every once in a while, Courtney would break out and start yelling. This album still has the goods though. All songs are good. Even if  you liked the rage of Live Through This and Pretty on the Inside, buy this  CD, even though it doesn't have that rage. Rating: A-
6302732778|3.0|While it's still a good flick, the director's cut can't hold a candle to the original version. Harrison Ford's world-weary narration makes the movie stand apart from the herd.  I would much prefer to have a copy of the  original myself.  Incidently, did you know that Dustin Hoffman was  originally slated to play Decker? Jeez.
6303985467|5.0|It has always been my opinion that horror is an underappreciated genre.  No matter how good the film is, it is pre-labeled &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;trash&quot; by so-called movie critics, whose job they feel is to  only heighten the movies that fall into either the musical, drama, or  comedic categories.  How sad that such people will miss such a fantastic  film as &quot;Carnival of Souls.&quot;  It conveys more mood and subtle  atmosphere than almost any film I have ever seen.  The story is intruiging,  and does not give away too much too soon.  Great performances from the  cast, a commanding use of light and film, Carnival of Souls is a chilling  Tour de Force.
0385474547|1.0|I was forced to read this for a college intro to lit class and it was terrible.  Not only is it written in a Juvenile manner, but the characters are annoying to read about.  This story could have been told in about 20  pages, but streches out into a full book that finally makes a point in the  very last pages.  Achebe's work needs some fine tuning.
0790729644|5.0|&quot;Unforgiven&quot; is a masterpiece, the achievement of Eastwood's career as director. I doubt anyone can direct a real western after this one. The whole american mythology created around the 1830-1890 period is  visited by Eastwood and exorcised. Heroes are no more than lousy  story-tellers, gunfighters must have glasses to shoot right and there  aren't good guys and bad guys anymore : there are only human beings like  you and me who kill for money or revenge. If the hero does survive in a  fight, it's only because he's lucky and not because he's the good one.  Eastwood created a crepuscular world much more impressive than Robert  Altman's movie about Buffalo Bill (with Paul Newman). If you should have  only one western in your DVD collection, buy &quot;Unforgiven&quot;. And,  of course, the others Eastwood's movies as well !
0780624890|5.0|Finaly they did it, the made a movie based on a comic book worthy to be on the big screen.  it has a solid story line. Snipes is the perfect actor to play Blade.
0553288105|1.0|Admittedly, Asimov is not often compared to Nabokov or Melville or Bronte, but if you've found yourself wondering why not, this book should clear up the matter in your mind.  If you're a lit fan and want to sample the best  of the SF genre, you'll do yourself a favor to look elsewhere (like maybe  Dune or The Martian Chronicles).  According to the forward, Asimov's  inspiration for the novel was essentially a self-imposed dare.  He inflated  it from a short story to convince himself he could still write a novel  after not having written one for 10 years and it shows.  Characterizations  and a story that barely would have sufficed for a short story have been  spread to complete transparency over 8th grade prose.  The whole thing  feels very forced.
B000002NHN|5.0|All her music is soothing and wonderful, with that international flavor.  She has a very nice video interview from the Mask + Mirror Era.  She also has a lot of stuff available only thru her Quinlan  Road website.  I was  hooked after Jade and Highlander.  I rewound those movies countless times  before I could read the music credits.
0767818040|4.0|First critique : This movie is the worse I have seen in years. Brian DePalma doesn't have any respect at all. He has used VERTIGO, REAR WINDOW and PSYCHO's plots in order to write the script of BODY DOUBLE. Shame on  him !!! Furthermore, there aren't any albanese subtitles on this DVD. I'm  not happy. Valentinu DIMITRIANOVTCHENKU ( Albania) Second critique : If you  want to have an idea of the movies Brian dePalma directed in his  beginnings, take a look at BODY DOUBLE. It contains all the director's  early obsessions : - A story in which you can easily trace the references  to Alfred Hitchcock's masterpieces. - The music of Pino Donnagio  (astonishingly audible in BODY DOUBLE). - Endless circular travellings  during the romantic moments of the movie. - Very sexy scenes involving a  sculptural actress ( Melanie Griffith here). Having been since the  seventies a DePalma fan, I 'm very fond of this movie. You can find here  themes one can recognize in MISSION IMPOSSIBLE, shot 12 years later, and  you can observe that the last scene of BODY DOUBLE is identical with the  first scene of DRESSED TO KILL. The circle is completed, no more Hitchcock  references, the second period of DePalma's career can begin. And it will be  a great period for movie history. A DVD for DePalma aficionados.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|I received this album as a birthday present (no, I won't tell you how old I am...) and being a Phil Collins fan for quite some time, I thoroughly enjoyed it, although I would have expected more songs on the album to  justify even more the title &quot;Hits&quot;. It is impossible to overlook  the &quot;creme-de-la-creme&quot; of artists contributing to the album, and  of course the maestro himself, adding his &quot;invisible touch&quot; to  make this yet another masterpiece in his already endless list of  masterpieces. May there be many more fruitful musical years for you, Phil,  and keep those tunes churning out, we love them and you!!!
B000000OPQ|4.0|At the time this CD was released (along with the movie) most of these artists were chuggin' along with their careers.  No one can doubt that each song on this album stirs different emotions from the grasping, almost  demonic Lunatic Fringe (Tom Cochrane's Red Rider) to the breakout John  Waite pop melody Change to the sultry swaying Crazy for You by Madonna.   This album is highly recommended as a true slice of the 80's pop/rock  genre.
0783229526|4.0|Most people won't like this movie. It is weird, at times shocking and offensive, and most definitely not for the general public. But I found it terribly funny, full of terrific catch-phrases, and more entertaining that  most of the movies I've seen this year. Depp is incredible, particularly  with his dead-on characterization of Hunter Thompson.
6301562925|2.0|Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers is a flick that has begun to exhaust the Michael Myers angle...While I felt that H4 was well done and an intelligent horror flick, H5 seemed boring at times and the storyline  could've been a lot better...the apparent &quot;psychic link&quot; between  Myers and his niece was cheesy; it brought down the entire Halloween series  from a horror icon to a Friday the 13th-like slasher series...If you  haven't seen any Halloween flicks, than I'd advise you to see the 1st, 2nd,  4th, and then not expect too much from the final 3, although H20 was better  than it's two predecessors.
B00000DLV1|5.0|I hate live albums as a rule.  Some bands never live up to their studio sound.  Some are lucky if they can even surpass their sound and reinterpret their songs into something better than the original.<br />Until  Portishead.<br />Here is one of the most under rated bands in the world going  above and beyond their studio sound.  Each song is wonderfully done.<br />&quot;Sour Times&quot; lives up to it studio version and goes beyond  into desperation bordering on bitterness.<br />&quot;Only You&quot;,  &quot;All Mine&quot; and &quot;Strangers&quot; showcase Portishead's meld  of jazz, trip hop and torch.<br />Beth Gibbons is a DIVA!
0800132335|5.0|Incredible retelling of life aboard a WWII German U-Boat.  As a submariner in the modern nuclear navy, it was incredible to see the attention to detail aboard submarine life that still applies today (cramped quarters,  lonlieness, etc.) **Note**: I own both copies of the director's cut  (widescreen &amp; adapted for television), and the widescreen is the  subtitled version.  The dubbing in the adapted for television version,  while usually on, is not as accurate as the subtitling, nor does draw you  as well into the atmosphere.
B000003TSP|5.0|Spellbing and hypnotic.  Jazz, trip hop, torch songs and a touch of errieness make this the ultimate album for those post-dawn soul searches. WHY DON'T YOU BUY THIS NOW?
0060977493|5.0|&quot;The God of Small Things&quot; is a faceted gem of a novel; using lush, haunting images, Arundhati Roy evokes a country--India--so far from our own, made vividly present through her emotionally charged storytelling.   A child's life is altered by violence and tragedy, yet the beauty and  intensity of Roy's language pierces us with joy even as it horrifies.   Highly recommended.
B000001FI7|5.0|Morose, soul baring lyrics, trip hop and funky jazz blend into a surrealistic vision of the broken hearted woman in us all.  Play it after a breakup.<br />Stirring!
1558908382|5.0|Grosse Pointe Blank is a really good, darkly funny movie, with a great soundtrack. You'll never again listen to &quot;99 luftballons&quot; the same as before! Kudos to Cusack who co-wrote the script.
6305076626|5.0|This movie is almoast like a dream.  It has many very memorable songs, and amazing acting.  It is very funny, but at the same time, very strange.  If you havent seen this cult film, it is definately worth getting.
B00000DF6O|5.0|I have every BB album and this one is by far his greatest work!!!  Like wine, he just gets better with age!!!!!!!!
B000000I0I|5.0|I was hooked on Mike Oldfield when I first listened to &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; in 1972. I purchased each album in succession until after &quot;Ommadawn.&quot; I loved &quot;Hergest Ridge&quot;, but when I  purchased &quot;Ommadawn&quot;, Mike Oldfield became my idol. This  masterful recording is put together so well, building up themes and  variations, sending you through a journey with climaxes that are  unbeatable. Ever since this album, I have been looking for one like this  one. &quot;Songs of Distant Earth&quot; is the only album that is a close  second to &quot;Ommadawn.&quot; Thank God that a CD of &quot;Ommadawn&quot;  was produced because I wore out two LP's throughout the years of  continually listening to the album. I can honestly say that I have listened  to &quot;Ommadawn&quot; over 200 times and I am not tired of it! Now I am  inspiring my music students to Mike Oldfield by example of this album and  others.  I am still looking for another album like it. I do think that with  the evolution of New Age Music, there will be a large clientele for it!
067158037X|5.0|I love this book.  When I read it my heart and soul are filled with every emotion.  Frank McCourt is an excellent writer.  Every person should want to and have to read this awesome and inspiring book.  Thank-you Frank  McCourt for touching my heart.
B000002BQK|5.0|Way to go Mariah! My faves are &quot;Breakdown&quot;, &quot;Honey,&quot; and &quot;4th Of July&quot;. Although the rest of the album is pretty good, I LOVE these songs!
0790725657|5.0|I love the movie.  I think is the best movie I ever seen in my life.  If you have a little girl at home you must watch this movie with her.  The story line is very simple but heart touching.  Is just great!!!
B000002OG5|3.0|We get 10 different versions of the Godfather theme but no &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.&quot;  I don't know where else to find that version of the song..
0783225547|5.0|Living in Western Washington, not far from Mt. St. Helens, I found this film to be very facinating. It reminded me of the actual 1980 news coverage of the St. Helens eruption. The special effects, acting and overall look  were extremely good. Both lead characters displayed excellent chemistry on  screen. It would be nice to see them together in a new film as I feel they  are both talented and portray very likable characters. The sets, visual  effects, chioce of &quot;on-location&quot; shooting and overall blending of  live action with special FX made this film truly believable. Maybe they  will produce some type of sequel - we can only hope. I was impressed with  the film in the theater as well as the DVD release. Living in the shadow of  Mount Rainier (only 50 miles away), I'm a bit concerned should Rainier ever  decide to become a real life Dante's Peak!
0790737973|3.0|An interesting concept that held my attention well throughout.  But, if you thought Dustin Hoffman was out of place in OUTBREAK, you'll have a hard time with SPHERE as well.  Forget about the fact that Samuel L Jackson,  Sharon Stone and Hoffman were wasted on this film.  None seemed to know how  to deal with their respective characters.  I suspect much of the total film  remains on the cutting room floor.  All of that now said, let the  exploration of the concept be your reason to see this film.  The gradual  realization of nature of the film's antagonist makes the process  worthwhile.  This film could have been very good with a LESS notable cast  and an ending that doesn't seem like a cop-out.
0684874350|5.0|I just finished Angela's Ashes and my mind compells me over and over again to think about Frank McCourt's astonishing triumph over an underprivileged childhood.  He makes me look again at a snapshot of my brother and me at  ages 6 and 3 in 1950.  I'm wearing his hand-me-down overcoat and his brown  shoes.  My brother's clothes made me feel special and happy not sad and  sorry for myself.  How little we need to be happy.  Mr. McCourt has made me  remember how good a warm soft boiled egg  with butter tasted when I was a  small child.  My parents had little to offer but love and I am greatly  honored to have had such a gift of dedication. Thank you Frank McCourt for  making me remember that the human soul can triumph over overwhelming odds  and be the better for it.  Thank you Mr. McCourt for a special book that I  will remember in my heart always.  Thank you Mr. McCourt for helping me not  visit the guilt of nonsense spread by supersition and ignorance.
0848808126|5.0|Fast-paced and hilarious from beginning to end, it's another in the huge line of greats by Georgette Heyer.  Horatia and the Earl of Rule are an unlikely pair who capture eachothers and the reader's heart by the end of  the book.
B00000253N|5.0|When my brother came home for Christmas, he brought my dad and I a copy of Blood on the Tracks.  I can't claim to know much about Dylan, but it didn't matter, the power and catchyness of the tunes was enough to keep me  listening.  And upon further review, I realized what a tresure I've been  missing all these years.  This album has gotten me through a near break-up  with my girlfriend, a trip to Scotland, and basically the past year.  It  has become my favorite album, and almost assureadly will be for life.   &quot;Lord knows I've paid some dues, gettin' through....&quot;
6300216748|5.0|Three Days of the Condor is the greatest conspiracy movie of all time.  If plot is of paramount importance to you - get this film. It is intricately woven and will keep you on the edge of your seat.  The star assasin, played  by Max VonSydow, is a deliciously crafted and played character.  You'll be  delighted that you won't be able to figure out what will happen next.  Enjoy:)
B000002KKC|4.0|This Fleetwood Mac album reflects the band's true talents.  After listening to it several times, I began to appreciate its bizzare nature. I think Fleetwood Mac was maybe 20 years ahead of its time with Tusk.  Even  so, Stevie's and Christine's music are not that far off the base of classic  Mac -- it's Lindsey that truly experiments, namely with the title track.  But if you enjoy Fleetwood Mac's classic sound you'll have plenty of it  with &quot;Think About Me&quot; &quot;Angel&quot; &quot;Sara&quot; and  &quot;Never Forget.&quot;  It's worth the investment.
B00000AOTZ|3.0|The instrumentals are high tech and very upbeat.  Joe Walsh does a good rendition&quot;In The City&quot; along with a new version of &quot;Nowhere to Run&quot;
B000002KD5|5.0|Even though Rumours ranks as their best selling album, this rather mellow CD should rank as their finest.  Christine McVie sounds &quot;Perfect.&quot; Stevie and Lindsey show their true talents.  This is  the album that started it all!
0792151712|1.0|I hate this movie. It is a horrid idea for a film. A love story on the Titanic? What's next? &quot;TWA Flight 800: A love Story&quot;? This movie is totally awful, and it proves that people have no shame. If it is such a  bad movie, you ask, then why did hords of people flock to see it? Simple:  People are fools (if teenage girls count as people). I'll take &quot;A  Clockwork Orange&quot; over this any day. I'll take &quot;Pulp  Fiction&quot; over this any day. I'll take &quot;Basquiat&quot; over this  any day. Hell, I'll take &quot;Ernest Saves Christmas&quot; over this any  day. This movie is truly disguisting and makes me want to hurl all over my  computer.  Later, Someone obviously better than you
B000002LFZ|5.0|This CD should be staple in most people's CD collections.  The album under-appreciates Lindsey Buckingham's contributions to Fleetwood Mac (it is missing Monday Morning and Second Hand News), but it's biggest plus is  that it contains most of Christine McVie's amazing hits.
B000001EGE|5.0|This deserves 5 stars for the first 5 songs alone.  Some of the others may be overwrought, but those five are incredible.  You can strut around the room with Honkey Cat, mellow out with Mellow, enjoy a little teenage  narcissism with Think I'm Going to Kill Myself (and enjoy some tap  dancing), get hot longing for Suzi, and blast off with the Rocket Man.   This is a MUST for any Elton fan!
B000002L9Y|5.0|This album is classy. It doesn't have that &quot;classic&quot; rock feel, but never fear -- it is still captures the amazing chemistry of Fleetwood Mac.  Stevie's &quot;Seven Wonders&quot; is one of her best performances  and her background voice on Christine's &quot;Little Lies&quot; is truly  unforgettable, but her other songs on the album lack excitement.  Lindsey  is still the most experimental of the band -- and he succeeds in sounding  different.  &quot;Tango in the Night&quot; &quot;Big Love&quot; and  &quot;You and I&quot; are powerful and fantastic, although &quot;Family  Man&quot; is a skip over.  As usual, Christine McVie wraps it all up neet  and sweet with her golden voice.  &quot;Little Lies&quot;  &quot;Everywhere&quot; &quot;Isn't Midnight?&quot; and  &quot;Mystified&quot; are the finest on the album.
B000001FY9|5.0|Fans new to Marley's music have a perfect introduction in Island's Legend compilation. Of course, his early (and, according to some, more important) music from the ska and rock steady era---essentially, the music he, Bunny,  and Peter made before they signed with Island in the early 70s---is absent  from this collection. Unfortunately, those tunes, while still popular, are  greatly overshadowed by his more &quot;international&quot; sounding reggae,  some of which appears on Legend. So by all means buy this album...only  don't stop there!
B000002KKD|5.0|I was too young to appreciate this album when it came out.  It is a must for any party, any punk rock fan, and for any hard core B-52 fan. Their sound is distinct from the late 80's Cosmic Thing or early 90's Good Stuff,  but nonetheless just as catchy.  &quot;Planet Claire&quot; &quot;Dance This  Mess Around&quot; and &quot;Rock Lobster&quot; are unforgettable classics.   This is a must buy!
6300216268|5.0|I have owned this movie since I was in the nineth grade and have since gone throught three copies. I have also been lucky enough to obtain a copy of the book which is no longer in print. This book and movie act like a  bible in my life. I have passed it on now to many people who have touched  my life as Maude touched Harolds.  Create memories and adventures, use the  quotes that you remember most in your life and pass them on to others, but  most of all and allow Harold and Maude enter into your life.
B000002KXO|4.0|While not the best Fleetwood Mac album, it still has some of the Mac's finest songs. Stevie's &quot;Gypsy&quot; is the best song on the album, and one of Fleetwood Mac's greatest.  Christine McVie still has the catchiest  songs.  &quot;Hold Me&quot; &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; and &quot;Love  in Store&quot; are classic McVie.  And Lindsey's &quot;Book of Love&quot;  sounds great.

0790729652|3.0|The original Batman film is certainly a decent movie, but it suffers from the facts that<br />a) Keetan is an awful batman.  He has a fat face, wears turtlenecks in the batcave, and his lips stick out every time he wears the  batsuit, which really ruins his serious acting.<br />b) I know this movie is  supposed to be dark, but there are times when you can barely tell what is  going on it's so dark!<br />There are some good parts, like when a swordsman  comes sumersaulting at him screating, but is easily beaten up.  However,  this one only rates second as the best batman movie, with batman 3 and 4  tied for first.
B000002IZM|5.0|Vangelis has succeeded in making a &quot;soundtrack&quot; that should redefine the word.  Indeed, his Blade Runner soundtrack does not contain all of the music from the film, but instead, adds other music that was not  originally included.  The result is a soundtrack that takes the listener  through the emotions of the movie, step by step, allowing you to evision,  and feel, everything all over again, without opening your eyes.  Vangelis  included some dialogue from the movie at the start and finish of the  soundtrack, which acts to set the mood and get the mind thinking about the  movie at the start (Main Titles), and wrap it up with the movie's main  point at the end (Tears in Rain).  The inclusion of &quot;One More Kiss,  Dear&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner&quot; was essential.  One More Kiss, Dear  brings the listner back to earth at the middle point, with its retro  fixings, reminding us that we are human, and as humans, little really  changes.  The Blade Runner track symbolizes the fury of the final  &quot;fight&quot; scene between Decker and Batty, and as such, is the  perfect precursor to Tears in Rain.  If only all &quot;soundtracks&quot;  were this good.
0790731002|4.0|For me, Batman Forever is tied with Batman and Robin as the best batman movie ever.  I think Val Kilmer does the best as Batman.  He is easily better than Michael Keetan(is that how you spell it?), who looks like he  couldn't fight his way out of a wet paper bag.  Jim Carrey really makes  this movie stand out though, esspecially with his hilarous lines.  (&quot;Your entrence was good-his was better.&quot;)  Tommy Lee Jones is  good also, but you barely notice because you can only pay attention to  Carrey.  (You also have to love it when Riddler says: &quot;Has anyone ever  told you that you have a SERIOUS IMPULSE CONTROL PROBLEM!?&quot;)  However,  it still suffers from the lack of lighting that Batman 1 and 2 had,  although it is a bit better.  Robin (Chris o'Donnell) is great too, and I  certainly hope he is permanant in the batman movies.  All in all, Batman  Forever is alot of fun to watch, with lots of great lines.
6300151379|5.0|I think that Labyerinth should be brought back to the theaters.  I think there should be a Laberinth 2, about where evrybody is right now( Sarah, Jerath, ect.). I'm also sorry to say that you cannot buy the movie anymore  due to the total lack of viewers in the public.  I've been a fan of  Laberinth sence I was 8 years old (currently 16). I love the way that the  whole movie was brought together with the music and actors.
0790730960|1.0|Batman Returns is just plain sick at times.  The Penguin, who used to be almost loveable in the original comics, is a homicidal nutball in the movie.  The catwoman (who is in herself at times very disturbing.) is blond  (she is supposed to be raven haired) and more of a pain to watch then  anything else. The only redeeming value is the occational funny line from  Penguin.
0440224764|3.0|I once said that I am not an avid fan of JG, and this book did not affect  that statement. I got through the first chapter, which is pretty good for a  high school student, and was quite impressed. I really thought that this  book was going to be really thrilling-I chalk that statement up to bad  taste and inexperience. The idea of a person getting away from his  pathtetic, dull life and stealing a truck load of money was really cool,  the way Grisham persued made it rather boring. Patrick was a really awesome  character with lots of tricks up his sleeve and was probably the only thing  that kept my attention. Despite popular opinion, I thought the ending was  hype
079073463X|5.0|This movie is timeless.  Every time I turn it on, it is as if I am seeing it for the first time.  The music, the actors, Michelle Pfeiffer, the scenery, the animals (especially the magnificant horses) = they all  contribute to this delightful movie.  I would recommend it highly, and have  to many friends, as a pure entertainment movie.  In this age of movies that  are all the same or are dominated by special effects, this movie is  refreshing.  A love story, an action movie blended together to create total  enjoyment.  If you haven't seen this movie, this is the one to add to your  collection.
B00000ADG2|5.0|I liked this album because it really was talking to you, you can actually feel the music talking to you. When I first listened to this album I wanted to cry, that just goes to show how much this album meant to me. It was the  best!
6304140711|4.0|This movie kept me in suspense most of the time.  It makes me have second thoughts about having a boyfriend.  It is a great movie and if you like sitting on the edge of your seat the whole time, this is the movie for you.
B000000IVW|5.0|...has a band returned rock from the abyss like Guns and Roses. I really don't think they get the credit they deserve. They weren't a metal or a punk band or even a punk/metal band to me. They were the spirit of rock  come back to kick your a** like no one had done in years. I mean if you  look closely at the lyrics you kinda start to say &quot;Axl what the ****  are you talking about&quot; but really if you take apart a lot of bands  that happens. But they rocked and they rocked hard. This record is amazing.  If you're tired of emo whining or hardcore crap and you're ready to rock  again come here. It'll be good to have you back
0780622650|2.0|This movie is incrediably dumb! The characters are cardboard( the girl is the worst, NO personality, except as a sulky brat). The plot is okay, but if there's no one worth rooting for, then what's the use of having a plot?  I gave this movie two stars because of good special effects and a cool  soundtrack  (I also sort of liked the beginning).
0060392584|5.0|Isn't it amazing that people bash Mr. / / anson even though he is only doing things like Alice Cooper, or even David Bowie have done in the past, just on a bigger scale?  Wether you love or hate him, this book is a great book.  There's a little something for everyone.  It also makes some of his  songs make more sense if you couldn't figure them out by listening to them.   This book is a lot like his music in many ways, you can take your own  meaning from it.  / / arilyn / / anson is definately the Rock Star he sings  of, the Antichrist Superstar.
0767802470|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made about life aboard a submarine under war time conditions. In this case we see what life is like thru the eyes of a U-Boat commander and crew during World War II. I wouldn't say  that the movie is making an anti-war statement but does depict the obvious  distaste that German Submariners in general had for the Furher and the  third Reich as witnessed in the nite club scene. Rather the movie depicts  what war is all about --- survival from day to day one hour at a time when  on a Wolf Pack mission.<br />The action is fast paced but at the same time  Petersen does not sacrifice realism to achieve ficticuous dramatic  affects.The tension gradually builds as the Captain and crew manage to  escape one harrowing experience after another during one mission as a  member of the Wolf Pack in the North Atlantic. It is certainly not  recommended viewing for anyone suffering from claustophobia. I have seen  both the original version (i.e. Director's cut in German with English ST)  and the dubbed English Version (The Boat) and found the original version  the best in terms of realism and emotion. <br />Royce Trenholm
B000001GBJ|1.0|I bought this CD on the strength of customer reviews.  Boy, was I sorry.  Easy listening it is, without complexity or depth, and depressing to boot.  I found it superficial and irritating.  The only use for it I can think of  is to calm a child. But there's more lovely and inspiring music out there  to do that job, Enya, for instance.  I actually bought an extra CD to give  my Dad as a gift, and I cannot think of one person I know who might like  it.
6300263673|5.0|That is the only way that I can describe my feelings about this movie.   Every time that I watch this movie I wish that I was Baby.  Not because she  is with Patrick but because I would love to have a romance like that in my  life.  The music, dancing, and enchanting story all lead to the odvious  sucess of this movie.  It is wonderful
0786880708|5.0|This is one of my favorite books.  Anyone could learn from it.  I can trust it to ground me when I'm stressed, inspire me when I'm down.  A very beautiful, very useful book.
0812550706|5.0|I don't normally read science fiction, but this book came highly reccommended by my cousin. I picked it up and in a matter of hours, I was done. The book was excellent--the development of Ender and his sibling was superb, as were the psychological twists. A must read for everyone who  enjoys a good book now and again.
630512065X|4.0|As the widely diverse comments posted here show, Cats is a show which polarizes people. Either people love it or hate it there's no middle ground.  As a theatre goer who loved the show on Broadway, I must state  that the video does very well in capturing the show on the whole. And if  you like this show's theatricality you'll like the video, but if you want a  plot, or can't stand the idea of dancers prancing around singing TS Eliot  poetry, what're you watching this for anyway, its no secret what its  about!<br />The presentation, with plenty of close ups of key moments of the  show works quite well, although nothing can truly capture the feel of being  surrounded by that huge set and having the show going on around you.  The  singing and dancing is top rate.  The sound is excellent.<br />But please  note, despite claims that this is &quot;definitive&quot; it isn't.  The  show has been cut significantly.  While some may not care that the numbers  like The Gumbie Cat, Mungojerrie, and Mr. Mistoffoles have been shortened,  I find it hard to accept the fact that the entire Growltiger's Last Stand  number has been completely eliminated.  This is not only the show's most  spectacular number, but is a key poem from Old Possum's Book of Practical  Cats on which this show was based.  Weber et als give no explanation of  this key elimination in the &quot;making of&quot; video.  The claim that this is  &quot;definitive&quot; or the whole show, is misleading.  Still a great  treat for Cats lovers, but the limitations should be clear.
6304773382|1.0|I enjoy sci-fi. I enjoy action/adventure. I enjoy dystopias. This film was garbage. Although I am GenerationX, maybe I'm too old for this.
6305120706|4.0|In the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway, Cats is an overwhelming experience, in which you are immersed in the &quot;world&quot; of Lloyd Weber's musical from the setting itself [the set encompases the whole  theatre] to the performances, which frequently move into the auditorium to  give a theatre in the round experience.  Needless to say a video of any  show can't really capture the entire theatrical experience [although some,  such as Nicholas Niclolby, Sweeny Todd, Into the Woods, etc try to show you  how the show was done on the stage].  The Cats video never gives you an  overview of the set, nor how the show is done with a live audience, but  otherwise it is excellently handled.  By showing close ups of numerous  little bits of business, the video gives a very comprehensive look at this  musical.  The singing and dancing is first rate all the way around.  The  video was filmed in a widescreen format of about 1.75:1 and the DVD is  letterboxed, this was not shown that way on PBS and I'd guess that the VHS  isn't shown that way either.  The compostions work far better in the  letterbox presentation, giving you more of the peripheral action which is  lacking from the pan and scan. The sound is spectacular.<br />All of this  makes this a treasure for fans of the show, but here's the downside....  Despite claims on the box and in the &quot;making of&quot; interviews with  Lloyd Weber et als. that this is the &quot;Definitive&quot; version of the  show, in fact it has been edited so that the whole thing will play in 120  minutes.  Certain dances, including the &quot;Gumbie Cat&quot; Mungojerrie  and Rumpleteaser, and Mr. Misofolees have been significantly shortened.  It  works quite well, but there are many spectacular moments missing.<br />All of  this pales however, over the unforgiveable elimination of the Growltiger's  Last Stand number.  Not only is this the most spectacular number in the  stage show, but it is one of the key poems in the TS Eliot collection: Old  Possum's Book of Practical Cats on which this is based.  In the interview  Lloyd Weber talks about paying homage to Eliot's poetry in the show.  Apparently he has decided that this key poem is now not worthy of showing.   The &quot;making of&quot; video is misleading in not mentioning or  explaining any of these elimations. You can tell that I like this video in  that I've given it 4 stars despite what I consider to be a fatal omission.   But without ALL of the numbers this simply isn't the entire  &quot;Cats&quot;.
0140277447|4.0|Iris Chang has done the world a great service by writing this, heretofore, forgotten history.  Although mentioned in the history books, the full impact of the Japanese atrocities have remained unrecognized.  How could a holocaust of such magnitude go under-reported? Modern society owes Ms.  Chang a dept of gratitude for forcing this issue to the front.  The even  greater mystery is how Japan has not been forced to admit to, and apologize  for, the unspeakable criminal acts committed by the Imperial Japanese Army  during the period 1937-45.  The US government, in conjunction with all of  the world's law abiding nations, must demand Japan own up to, and apologize  for,  the war crimes committed in WW2. Why Japan has escaped rebuke would  be an excellent topic for another book.  An excellent book, heartbreaking  in details.  A must for students of this era.
6304935803|5.0|What can I say?  From a historical standpoint, this is a perfect representation of the man that was Gen. George S Patton Jr.  Showing all his strengths and all his weaknesses.  Scott was born to play the role and  there is no denying the power of his performance.  My only regret is that  the opening speech was actually toned down from it's original version that  the real life Patton gave to his third army.  Not that I am an advocate to  such harsh language, but with Scott's commanding presense and fluence for  the role, there is no excuse not to pepper each sentence with the four  letter words Patton himself loved so dearly.  In the man's own words,  &quot;An army without profanity couldn't fight it's way out of a p***  soaked paper bag!&quot;
6303855512|5.0|It's a shame that more people don't know about this great film.  Watching this movie is an experience similar to reading a good book.  You feel like you are involved in the character's lives, and when it's over there are  layers and layers of meaning to explore. I've seen it four times and I will  see it again.
6304140428|5.0|One late night about 20 years ago, I was flipping  through the channels.  I luckily happened upon this movie, which I couldn't stop watching.  So powerful.   Elizabeth Taylor's talents are stunning.  It's both sad and  hilarious at the same time.  I love  this movie.  A true classic.
0790736241|4.0|If you are a SCI-FI fan and you like realistic stories, it is for you.  I was written more than 10 years ago, so the current SCI-FI concept we usually see is not present.  If you like action like The Rock it is not for  you.<br />Perhaps during the contact I would do a different thing if I would  write the story because it feels quite a bit common, but as I said it was  written years ago and the only one I would blame for it is Carl Sagan.<br />I  have not read the original book but those who read have told me that the  movie does not alter the story but simplifies it for time reasons.<br />I own  the video and I think that it worth the price and it is enjoyable.
B000000WFU|5.0|I don't have one specific genre of music I could call my favorite, but the music that I really enjoy is that which takes me places when I listen.  Adiemus is such a powerful CD because it takes a listener's imagination on  a jounrey through sounds and sensations, and it inspires the soul to such  heights and depths.
6300216209|5.0|What can I say about a movie that is simply suberb in all aspects - story, screenplay, acting, music and it true to its book?<br />Watch it (again &amp; again again &amp; again again &amp; again ...)
B0000021RB|4.0|This is Chicago with a few rough edges. Their first album with some excellent numbers.  I like this album because it is a rock album with a brass sound but not as over produced  or polished as their later albums (V  and up).
0790734435|3.0|All the Batman films have missed the mark, but by far, this one is the better one of them all.  The immediate eye-catcher on this one is Batman's costume.  It is the most logically built one.  Batman literally looks like  he's wearing armor plates.  That's realistic, that makes sense, and that  makes it more realistic.  The fact that this movie retains it's PG-13  rating amazes me due to the grotesque (and accurate) portrayal of the  Penguin.  The movie isn't good for its story.  In fact, like all the Batman  movies, the stories are totally unoriginal.  The rather odd and sometimes  goofy set construction in Batman Returns doesn't help add the realism the  film needs.  In fact, it becomes annoying as the film progresses.  Tim  Burton is a visionary...but not for Batman.  But, what does work is the  overall dark, brooding aura that pervaids in the film.  It's almost  claustraphobic and that's exactly how it should be.  The hostile  relationship between Catwoman and Batman works well, but not enough time is  devoted to it because the movie is crowded with too many major characters,  hence a bad and incomplete story.  The fight scenes are well executed and  exciting, but the animal (penguin) effects make you cringe a bit.  So, it  winds up being a mixed bag: there are some big flaws in the film, but there  are some solid extras which make it quite watchable.  The best of the  Batman films, but the best one of all has yet been made, nor will it ever  likely be made because the right people have not been assembled yet.  Kind  of like on the Superman films.
6300183211|5.0|This is one of the most treasured and classic gangster movies of all time.  Pacino at his best!!
0800139151|3.0|I found myself enjoying this film more than I thought.  It's so rare to get a film where a female gets to play the rugged hero, so when there is such a film, some leeway should be given.  Raimi utilizes some excellent  camera work and I rather thought the quiet moody close up shots of Stone  worked.  All in all, the movie has a lot going for it...except the dialogue  and some rather empty scenes.  Up against that, it's difficult to rank any  movie as great.  But, it's a fun watch and if you take into account you're  not going to see something grand, you'll enjoy yourself.
6305001200|5.0|This movie is very capturing and interesting.  The songs are catchy and they have a twist in them.  In my opinion, this movie should come out  in theaters again.
6300248143|5.0|This is by far one of the most unrelenting action films ever made.  It's amazing how much adrenaline your body can pump in a two hour time period just sitting on a couch.  The attention to detail, the solid storyline and  script, the exhilirating music by James Horner, and the beautiful alien  special effects by master Stan Winston make this a film not to be missed.   I know of no one who's been disappointed with this film.  Even Roger Ebert  liked it!
6300181251|5.0|Psycho is one of the greatest horror films ever made, a classic motion picture if there ever was one.  Even those who don't care for horror films but like classics can enjoy it, but if so WHY IS IT OUT OF PRINT?!  Someone  start a letter writting campaign for a reedition.
6305232660|5.0|It's just a very good movie, with lots of realistic details and very good ideas as to how to get the comet to explode.  A deffinate must-see for the whole family!!!
6303234844|5.0|When I first bought this video I watched it almost obsessively-- several times a week, usually. Now I watch it maybe once or twice a month, but it has not faded on me one bit. Filmed over the course of two nights in  Modena, Italy, Gabriel and his crew have edited the film (and this is a  FILM) so that the film crew is essentially invisible-- you never see a  single cameraman onstage with the musicians. And speaking of the musicians,  it is an incredible line-up and they are all in amazing form. Paula Cole,  in particular, is a visual and auditory feast. The concert staging is  spectacular, utilizing a basic repetoire of lights and moving stage  elements to extraordinary effect. The sound quality is excellent. Anyone  who has any affinity whatsoever for Gabriel's music should own this video--  believe me, you'll be doing yourself a great favor.

6301334523|5.0|One of the all time best movies I have seen as far as being able to draw the veiwer into it's world.  The acting by John Malkovitch and Glenn Close and their constant duel is breathtaking and intense.  The emotions of  Michelle Pfeiffer and Uma Thurman are profound and stirring.  And the skill  these actors use, expressing their characters through eyes and voice and  stunning facial expression, is some of the finest I have ever seen.  The  costume design is among the likes of Amadeus and Henry V (Branagh)...it  enfolds the viewer in a profound sense of the time and culture the  characters live in.  It is a sweet feeling of another time and place and  the great game that is played there is one of depth, intrigue, passion,and  the taboo.  Set in the heydey of Parisian Aristocracy, two nobles share an  intense passion of loveplay and manipulation.  They are the greatest of  this game, and their personal desires to beat the other fuel a private  battle like no other.  Supporting their consuming pranks are an innocent  wife of a religious leader, a young debutante fresh out of a convent  preparing to marry, and a brash young music teacher intent on forcing his  way out of the class system.  The way each of these people's own internal  passion struggles intertwines with the other is dizzying and so intense  it's tragic.  The surprises that seem to come from every corner in this  film give it a life and depth that instantly creates legend.  Top of the  line film with great cinemetography, score, editing, and historical  accuracy.
1560689986|5.0|While most Monty Python fans (including myself) cut their teeth on the Holy Grail, The Life of Brian offers a more interesting, thoughtful, and just plain funny brand of the British brats.  Trust me on this one . . .  check it out.
044651506X|4.0|This book is not just for men! Although, you have to find crude, sex crazed male behavior funny. The book started out fast paced but bored me to tears for 200 pages till the climax at the end. General's daughter and The  charm school were 5 star books, this is a 3.5 starer. It is more like an  Law &amp; Order episode than a Columbo episode. You know who the killer is  far before the end. Overall a good book, just don't expect it to be a  'charm school'.
6302824613|5.0|A rather rouguish film spoof about the funny side  of James Bond 007. Great actors and actresses abound in a movie on the same plane as Its a Mad   Mad Mad World. Peter Sellers is himself-actor extraordinaire- and Woody  Allen give superb performances. The soundtrack is my all-time favorite,  Burt Bacharach, Dust Springfield, Herb   Albert are gigantic. A must see  flick
0780624890|4.0|No need for me to go into a synopsis of the film, the previous reviews covered that pretty well.  You either really enjoy the film or you hate it--not too much in between.  Great POPCORN movie.  The DVD is worth the  purchase for the additional supplements alone.  Commentary with  star/producer, Wesley Snipes, you also hear from the production designers,  composer, and a bunch of other folks involved with the production. There is  even a brief history of the origin of the comic book character.   Also  included are extended and deleted scenes, alternate endings(with unpolished  effects), and a slew of interviews with various above the line crew  members, including the President of New Line Cinema. So if you bought your  DVD player mainly for the extra fun features you can't get with VHS, you'll  this DVD--even if you thought the movie was just &quot;Okay&quot;.
B000002ADT|5.0|The liner notes in this re-release of Kind Of Blue mention &quot;Heaven&quot; continuosly when talking about this album. The music on this is heavenly, and almost everyone (including none Jazz fans) loves this  music the minute they hear it. Specially though, musicians will love this  for the musical freedom &amp; beauty it has. You can't go wrong with a  lineup like the one on this album! Davis, Coltrane, Adderly, Kelly, Evans,  Chambers, and Cobb! The alternate take of &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot; is  wonderfull and a great bonus. Buy this album!!!(if you don't already own at  least 3 copies...)

B000002UJQ|5.0|... and I must say that I DO get them in a big big way.  Radiohead is not a band that you learn to love - they are inside of you. It's just a matter of time before their music and your soul begin to vibrate in tune.  You are  a Radiohead Person.<br />Then there are the people that Radiohead just doesn't  meld with - my girlfriend, in particular.  Some people love hooks,  throwaway lyrics, and speed.  Radiohead doesn't produce this.<br />If you are  a Radiohead Person,  OK Computer is the sound of your soul under  surveillance.  It is the itch between your shoulderblades when you know you  are being watched.  It is escaping into, or becoming lost within, the  machine.  It is life, and life is beautiful underneath the grit.<br />If you  are a Radiohead Person, there is no way to express your immense love to a  non-Radiohead Person without sounding trite, obsessed, or insane.  Play OK  Computer for them a few times and let it reverberate.  If they don't feel  it, just keep this treasure to yourself and don't bother explaining your  awe.  Just listen...<br />&quot;Idiot, slow down.&quot;
B00000AFDW|5.0|I have always been a fan of KISS, yet I'm pretty picky about their music. This album gets them back to what made them famous, straight Rock 'N Roll! But it's also much cleaner sounding thanks to Bruce Fairbairn's production.  I recommend this for anyone who has ever been a fan of the original KISS  lineup.

0026009102|5.0|A classic.  Literature in the true sense.  Mandatory reading for aspiring architects and impossible to put back down by anyone else who cracks it's cover.  That &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; is often ridiculed by today's architectural press for portraying an architect who stubornly stands alone  rather than being a &quot;team player&quot; is of little importance to this  architect reviewer.  The plot, characters, and undercurrents of  intellectual ideology are more than enough to induce fascination.  This  book remains relevant in any era.  Even better as a reread, &quot;The  Fountainhead&quot; when revisited after several intervening years will  awaken new understanding and meaning.  To enhance this understanding read  noted pshchologist Nathaniel Branden's biography of Ayn (ryhmes with  &quot;mine&quot;) Rand, &quot;Jugement Day&quot;, written around 1990. More  fascinating than the novel itself, her life story provides a sure footed  foundation upon which to build an understanding of this author and her  writings.  Learn the part that such noted architects as Richard Neutra and  Frank Lloyd Wright, not to mention present day economist Norman Greenspan  each played in her literary career.  Fascinating!
B00000AFWW|5.0|This is the best Hole record yet.  Despite being panned by Entertainment Weekly as the worst album of the year, both Rolling Stone and Spin chose it as one of their best. This record should propel Hole into superstardom.  It  reminds me a lot of Fleetwood Mac's Rumours--although I don't think this  one will get overplayed as much. Great album!
078062369X|1.0|The only thing I liked about this film was Snipes! As usual, he is the best thing in any movie he appears in.  Dorf is  really unbelievable as the bad guy.  But the whole vampire scenario is too weird for me.  Really the  only reason to watch this is to look at and listen to Wesley Snipes.
6305177473|5.0|My wife and I have four kids (ages 13-8).  I watched it with my 8 year-old daughter, and was caught offguard by how humorous, entertaining and heart-warming this movie was.  There were a few scenes where I had to choke  back tears! If there was one fault the movie had, it was its unrealistic  treatment of just how ravaging divorce and separation actually is in real  life.  Both daughters had only warm, fuzzy feelings about the parent they  never knew -- never dealing with or acknowledging any feelings of  abandonment or rejection. But the daughters' creative scheme to reunite  their parents was admirable and pulled off with much passion and dignity.  This was a well-updated remake of the classic, and I liked it much better  than the original. We're planning to buy it for our home collection.
0441172717|5.0|I am currently part way through the 6th book in the series.  I have read the entire series at least 6 times and will have to replace some of the deteriorating older books soon as I intend to read the series again in the  future.  I first read the the first book after seeing the movie 13-14 years  ago.  While the movie barely resembled the books, they did give faces to  the characters.  I rapidly collected the remainder of the series.  The  books teach us to look at the long view of things.  The characters in the  book look at centuries to obtain their goals like we would look at hours.  Many of the lessons taught by Frank Herbert through the characters bear  listening to.
6304675348|5.0|Wow, this has to be one of my all time favorite movies.  It has everything!  I mean if you want to be scared out of your mind I think this is a great movie.  And if you're frightened by gore that's fine because the  movie is mainly filled with suspense!  If you consider yourself a movie  watcher this is a must see.
6304779356|5.0|When Michael's family moves to Santa Carla, he gets swept up in the reason for the town's &quot;murder capitol of the world&quot; status.  Excellent performances by Jason Patric &amp; Barnard Hughes.  A vampire classic for  years to come.  Jason Patric's likeness to Jim Morrison is EERIE!
B000000W6F|5.0|I must say that this is, by far, my favorite album by the Pumpkins in addition to being one of my favorite albums ever. This is, in my opinion, the defining heart and soul of the pumpkins. Any of their new songs which  have been successful have some shared trait with the work on this album.  The powerful yet artistic drumwork by Jimmy Chamberland is. . .  beautiful.  Billy's voice and guitar is awsome. This entire album is just good music,  with my favorite, Rinocerous, serving as a pinnicle. The album is just raw  Smashing Pumpkins, and it is an amazing piece of work. I love it a lot.
0800141326|2.0|No plot, poor to mediocre acting, BAD editing, (Godzilla was anywhere from 50 to 500 ft tall). But that said, It was an action packed joy ride from begining to end. I'm embarassed to say I loved it.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|This CD captivated me, especially the songs &quot;Americana&quot; and &quot;Pay the Man.&quot;  The lyrics are original, fully mirroring the Offspring's opinions on issues we deal with today.
0792839846|3.0|The plot was interesting and the characters were well acted, but their seemed to be so little character development that despite that excellent actors, the charcters came off as two-dimensional people.
0783229526|4.0|The strange thing is that when I first viewed this DVD it was difficult sitting through it, but afterwards while away on vacation I couldn't wait to get back home to see it again.  It sort of has to sink in and I'm going  to watch it again right after I finish typing this.  I wonder what its like  to see it stoned, hmm...  :-)
0780020685|5.0|Lest anyone be dissuaded from purchasing this masterpiece because they believe it is not presented in its original aspect ratio, it should be known that THE 1:33:1 ASPECT RATIO ON THIS DVD IS CORRECT.  Akira Kurosawa  did not begin working with the widescreen format until later in the 1950s.   Anyone who asserts otherwise is mistaken.<br />This is a true 5 star films  that ANYONE will enjoy.  It's particulary recommended to those who would  never dream of watching a movie with subtitles.  Anyone looking for a great  action movie should take a chance on this.  Unlike that copy of Armageddon  you watched once and is now collecting dust on your shelf, this is  something you'll watch again and again.  For those who love John Ford-type  westerns, The Seven Samurai puts a marvelous spin on that classic genre.   Even if you don't like action movies, you'll respond to this movie.  It  offers genuine human drama with an insight into a different culture and  time that becomes increasingly fascinating with repeated viewings. <br />Of  course, it's also recommended to those who already know and love this film.   The picture on this DVD is much sharper and crisper than the one you're  used to seeing on that worn-out VHS tape.  As a bonus, it has a very  insightful secondary audio track with commentary from a Japanese film  historian that will help you develop a new appreciation for one of your old  favorites.
B000000I0I|5.0|Out of all of Oldfield's many releases (...and there are quite a few, folks!), this is by and far the absolute best of the best!  Falling right within the conceptual line of the &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; series releases  (i.e., one song per side on vinyl or cassette), this music upon first  listen is simply breath-taking!  Listening to it as a music-loving  teenager, it left a very delible impression upon my psyche and still  &quot;kicks&quot; today. So...I highly recommend this Oldfield release to  ANYONE who's interested in hearing his unique music for the first time.   (Trust me!  You WON'T be disappointed!!)
6301640659|3.0|I thought Pacinos Cop was convincing and the film showed a realistic picture of the gay-scene.
0783225857|5.0|A film that transcends the millenium. An almost forgotten time with unforgotten prejudices. To see the primary players three decades later still talking about the film and book with such love and emotion is a  tribute to Harper Lee.
0385484518|5.0|&quot;Tuesdays with Morrie&quot; was one of the most inspirational books I've ever read.  Morrie not only comes to terms with his death quite easily, but teaches Mitch some very important lessons along the way.  How  anyone could be so brave during death amazes me.
0790701251|5.0|Boot camp: organized, disciplined, harsh. Vietnam: Vague, strange, disorienting, incredibly dangerous. Veterans talk about Vietnam this way, starting with how you couldn't find the enemy. This movie brings the  dichotomy to life, with incredible performances.
6304044836|3.0|this movie is a remake of the original classic sabrina starring audrey hepburn --humphrey bogart--and bill holden---this movie has julia ormand in the title role of sabrina ---ormand is a good actress and does a nice job  but audrey hepburn was magical--harrison ford does a nice job potraying the  humphrey bogart character of linus larrabee--the elder larrabee brother who  plots to separate sabrina from his younger brother portrayed by david  kinnear---he does an outstanding job with his role of the younger larrabee  brother david originally portrayed by william holden---this was not a bad  movie but as soon as it was over i went and pulled out my copy of the  original sabrina movie and watched it--to me sabrina will always be audrey  hepburn---
0671015206|1.0|The problem with this book is that the authors take data about millionaires' spending habits and mold it into a recipe for acquiring wealth.  Of course, frugality is key.  But whether or not you choose Timex  over Rolex, or Buick over BMW is much less important than investing money  wisely.  And this book does not cover investment concepts like portfolio  management and diversification.  Furthermore, the reason many of the  so-called wealthy are frugal, middle-of-the-road spenders is that their  incomes are modest, five-figure salaries, and their net worth conists  largely of stocks and other holdings.  In other words, these individuals  often don't have enough disposable income to be considered truly wealthy  and spend voraciously.  If the authors at least discussed the  &quot;greatest invention of the 20th century&quot; (acc. to  Einstein-compound interest-the book might be useful for those looking to  start building a retirement nest.
6304032579|4.0|i really enjoyed the storyline of the movie goldeneye--it was action packed from start to finish--pierce brosnan is a very 90/s james bond--he had very big shoes to fill and did a great job--the only thing i take issue  with in this movie is the psychoanalysis of james bond and his dark side  --forget the psychobabble --james bond is bigger and better than that--i  want classic bond action and adventure--skip the freud--this was a good  movie but pierce brosnan does an even better job in tomorrow never dies  --he seemed much more at ease with the james bond character in that  movie---
0671015206|1.0|The whole premise of this book is that if you don't spend any money you will be rich. Duh. You also won't enjoy life. The authors never really even say why you would want all this money that you can't spend. There is  definitely one situation in which you should take the authors' suggestion:  don't buy this book. If you want a good book on personal finance, get Eric  Tyson's Personal Finance for Dummies.
B00000DHR0|5.0|This CD has touched me as no other this season.  I love &quot;The Prayer&quot; as well as all the other beautiful songs.  She is wonderful and brings the spririt of Christmas and faith into each of our lives.  ..  Thank you Celine for such a wonderful gift this year!
B00000GJ2B|5.0|Raging Bull is one of those rare films that shows life as it actually is: gritty and sometimes very ugly.  With this film director Martin Scorsese has dived deep into what makes us human and shown it to us very honestly.    The film follows the rise and fall of middleweight boxing champ Jake  Lamotta.  It begins and we see the kind of man Lamotta is.  He has a fight  with his wife and he even seems to enjoy it.   As the movie unfolds, we see  Lamotta for what he realy is: an animal who is only capable of expressing  himself through violence.  In the course of the film he alienates everyone  who loves him or could possibly love him.  In most films of the modern age,  the ending of an otherwise good movie is comprised and made happy. But this  is not the case with Raging Bull.  The characters are all real and Scorsese  knew this.  At the end Lamotta ends up as a two bit performer in a shady  night club.  And what makes this film so very good is that you thought that  was how he would end up.
6301161572|5.0|This production is the best published performance of Don Giovanni that I have seen.  The recording suffers a little from technical glitches, but the performances, direction, and meanings are all right on target!  How I wish  that this was available on DVD, with the technical glitches cured.<br />I  would not hesitate to purchase this video, especially since it seems like  it is getting harder to find.  How sad to lose this.<br />Imagine the  publishing studios thinking that one performance is as good as another!   Nothing could be farther from the truth.<br />Ruggero Raimondi is the only Don  Giovanni that can carry the role in the past 150 years.  Bravo to him.
630512065X|5.0|To anyone considering purchasing this video, understand that it is NOT a duplication of the live, on-stage viewing experience.  Nor is it intended to be.  While it lacks the excitement and the synergy added by a live  audience, it is in most other respects superior to the live performance.   You can hear and understand every word.  You can see close-ups and facial  expressions that would be missed from 100 feet away back in row 20.  Best  of all, you can pause, rewind, and replay the best bits over and over and  see all the things you missed the first time through - and believe me, you  won't see it all in one viewing.  You won't see it all in ten  viewings!<br />The makeup, costumes, choreography and music are all  extraordinary.  Superlatives hardly seem to do them justice.  After  watching the video a half dozen times, I can identify every performer by  name (stage name, that is...) Only one melody is memorable enough that you  can hum it afterwards... but memorability is only one (and not the most  important) of the many criteria that determine good music, and Andrew Lloyd  Webber's music is very good indeed.<br />High points of the video include the  solo performance by Rum Tum Tugger played by John Partridge; the three  appearances by Elaine Paige as Grizabella that absolutely steal the show;  John Mills as Gus the Theatre Cat; and the duets of Mungo Jerry and  RumpleTeaser, and Rum Tum Tugger and Mistoffeles.<br />To reiterate, this  video and a live performance are an apples and oranges comparison.  Enjoy  this video for what it is intended to be, and it will be one of your most  treasured possessions.
630516603X|5.0|Although seeing this show live would certainly be a treasured memory of any fan, this video perfectly captures the energy of the greatest dance show ever concieved. This immense production brought together, for the  first time, the two troupes that continue to tour Europe and North America.  The results have to be seen to be believed. There are also some wonderful  surprises, new music and dance routines, and a finale by Michael Flatley of  stunning raw talent. This video will literally leave you breathless at the  credits.
0792151712|1.0|It is a sad commentary on the tastes of the American public that a movie such as Titanic can be given such outstanding reviews, not to speak of the 11 academy awards.  The acting of the main characters was pitiful, the  story line created for the film was weak, and the movie gives new meaning  to the 60's term 'camp'. To reuse a somewhat hackneyed phrase &quot;No one  ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the American  public.&quot;
0670880728|5.0|shows how a single woman who doesn't see the world as the rest of the people around tries to stick to her ways. I totally share the difficulties of resisting to the 'ways' of the majority.. gives an excellent picture of  a young single woman who is just so confused &amp; trying to make it..  makes you laugh and makes you think...
B000001FAU|5.0|I always figured Ritchie was the absolute best riffmeister and soloist on the planet, but this is THE album to prove it!  His solos in &quot;Stargazer,&quot; &quot;Starstruck,&quot; and &quot;A Light in the  Black&quot; are genius!  Having a first rate frontman in R.J. Dio doesn't  hurt the cause here either! I only wish I could own one of those hard to  pin &quot;Elf&quot; albums, I heard there pretty much the hoot. C'mon all  you Blackmore fans... put your #@%*! cigarette lighters in the air and  let's hear ya make some noise!
B00000AFFF|4.0|There's a paradox in an album like this. Elvis Costello is a name eternally associated with the Punk movement, about rejecting conventional prettiness and production in favor of acerbic honesty. But this album is  built around pianos, set off with string sections, female backup singers  and honeyed horns. Is it a surrender, after all this time, to softer  sensibilities?<br />No, in fact. The &quot;easy listening&quot; audience will  be as uninterested in this collaboration as in the rest of Costello's  material. But even his own fans may have a little challenge learning to  love this.<br />I confess, I didn't, at first. I didn't understand. I was  looking for the driving guitar lines and literary sarcasm, the caustic  catharsis that I've come to expect...<br />But that's the whole point.  Costello is *good* at doing things we don't expect. And making them good.  The epiphany came as I watched a special on the music of Fred Astaire. The  reverie went something like this: Astaire's voice, I thought, was under  appreciated. It's very roughness makes it all the more interesting, more  sincere... Even singing Gershwin songs, and Irving Berlin.<br />And that was  the angle I needed. Elvis Costello sounding sincere and interesting on  music which is indeed pretty, beautiful in fact, like Gershwin... What a  fantastic idea. What a fantastic album. How very surprising and deliciously  pleasing, taken on its own terms...
B000001ELF|4.0|Space Ace was the only one out of the four original members that could come up with anything half-way decent on his own.  And that's saying quite a lot considering his reputation for drinking, etc.  Ace was obviously the  one who made KISS music move, with all those ahead-of-their-time solos and  experimental shifts (see Snowblind).  Yeah, his vocals do leave quite a bit  to be desired but you can really get past this after listening to the songs  and in particular Ace's guitar.  Gene, you don't need a million guest stars  on your album to make it good... and especially not Helen Reddy for God's  sake!
B00000DHRZ|1.0|I was hoping for something more creative that resembled music. Every song save &quot;Pretty Fly for a White Guy&quot; sounds like mechanized grinding - the likes of which could be concocted in most kitchens.  This is the  first CD I've heard by this group and it will certainly be the last. Maybe  I'm too &quot;mainstream&quot; but I will stick to music that is a bit more  melodic. I wouldn't recommend this CD to anyone who doesn't want to be  utterly irritated. Although, &quot;Pretty Fly&quot; is pretty funny. Wait  for the single!
B000002B82|4.0|One of the better '90's discs from a heavy metal oldie.  Oz shows that he can still get down and dirty with such bass-heavy plods as &quot;Mr. Tinkertrain&quot; and &quot;Hellraiser.&quot;  He shows a bit of humanity  this time around with open, honest, and even at times self-deprciating  lyrics!  Zakk Wylde ups the ante with some truly crunching riffs.  This is  the most highly recommendable Osbourne effort since &quot;Diary of a  Madman.&quot;
0780622553|5.0|Having seen Dark City in the theater and being aware of its murkey, netherworld like setting, I figured it was the perfect movie to test out the video cababilites of my new DVD player. I was right, while the plot may  be a bit weak at times the picture and sound quality were spectacular. The  DVD's ability to reproduce various dark and shadowy colors brought the disk  to life, to the point where the viewer couldn't care less about the plot  and focuses instead on the technology of the movie. The addition of full  commentary by various personalities and other additional material make Dark  City a needed addition to any DVD library.
B000000H57|5.0|October Rust is one of the great &quot;mood music&quot; albums of all time.  While artistically nothing like it, I often compare this album to Pink Floyd's &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; in its sheer intensity on  creating a realm with music.  The &quot;fuzzy&quot; sounding guitars do  start to wear a little after six or seven tracks, but this is a minor  complaint in the overall scheme of things.  This album is absolutely  incredible when driving down a winding road on a cloudy, crisp autumn day  while taking in the sounds and the sights... never fails to induce  goosebumps under these circumstances!   October Rust is great any time of  the year, but due to the gloom tones don't overplay it.  It's best  appreciated after listening to something light and basically  unconsequential. I'm not one that really loves thrash, hardcore, or death  rock... but this simply kicks!  If you enjoy bands like Kyuss, Life of  Agony or Trouble, you'll love this one!
B000003N7G|5.0|With A LOVE SUPREME John Coltrane reached a sort of zenith in his pursuitof his faith.This album in my opinion has to be on any great music fans list.ACKNOWLEDGEMENT starts with a solo byColtrane that if you really  listen is almost like a very moving prayer.If NASAever sends any more  probes out into spacein search of other life,A LOVE SUPREME should be  included on this missionas a symbol of Earth's culture.
B000001F27|2.0|I usually refer to this album as &quot;Difficult to CARE&quot; which pretty much sums up my opinion about it. &quot;Magic&quot; is a complete waste... the worst song ever performed by Rainbow.  I can only listen to  &quot;No Release,&quot;  &quot;Can't Happen Here,&quot;  Ritchie's  excellent solo in the middle of &quot;Freedom Fighter&quot; and  &quot;Difficult to Cure&quot; or Beethoven's 9th without having to flee.
0679781307|5.0|This short novel bears reading and re-reading.  Although translated from the German, there is never an awkward word or phrase.  How complex life really is:  love, sex, betrayal, the morality of one's decisions.  I  strongly recommend this book to anyone who appreciates good writing and is  interested in what lies beneath the surface.
B000001FBM|4.0|Back in '76 when I was 4 years old these guys ruled my world, and probably a lot of other (older) peoples' for that matter.  Just look at the cover art on the album... now that ROCKS!  The music here didn't even have to be  that good!  Luckily, it is VERY GOOD.  Detroit Rock City is a great wasted  youth anthem, and the way the end of the song ends crashing then slithering  its way into King of the Night Time World is perfect for the group's  excess.  Gene is a bit of a buffoon in Great Expectations (only a hint of  the goon he'd become during his '78 solo album) and Beth was really just a  sell-out single, but the rest of the album contains high octane, low  nutritional value stuff.  Look to God of Thunder and Shout It Out Loud for  further inspiration for mispending youth.
B000002JS6|5.0|What more has to be said about this album?  It will be eternally ringing down the halls of every dorm of every college and university on Friday and Saturday nights.  I can't image getting through college weekends without  this album!  This album is so packed full of energy and frenzy it's just  amazing!  Phil Rudd throws in the drum enforced hook on every song to back  up Angus' classic riffs.  Faves and often overlooked tunes here include  &quot;Let Me Put My Love Into You&quot; and &quot;Rock and Roll  Ain't  Noise Pollution.&quot;  If you don't own this album... where have you been  for the last 18 years?
B000002JK4|5.0|Here is one superior, complex and dynamic album!  If you are expecting Led Zep here you may be disappointed (as have been some of my friends).  But if you go into this one with an open mind, you'll be amazed!  Plant is not  afraid to experiment with odd rythms, sounds that jump like monkeys out of  a tree, and more smooth and assured vocals.  And the propulsive backing  band (including Phil Collins sitting in on drums) is equal to the  monumental task.  &quot;In the Mood&quot; is one of the most graceful,  effortless sounds to be recorded.  While more difficult songs such as  &quot;Wreckless Love&quot; &quot;Messin with the Mekon&quot; and  &quot;Stranger Here...&quot; benefit from the loose interpretation and  unpretentious demeanor Plant's purposely bestows upon them.  This album is  a jewel in the rough, highly recommended.  Top twenty single:  Big Log.
B000005RFQ|4.0|This is my favorite non-Ozzy Sabbath CD.  It is very difficult to come by but well worth the trouble of searching!  Gillan is mostly out-of- control on vocals but he articulates madness at its best!  Iommi comes up with some  great hard-hitting riffs and Geezer turns up the bass to bolster the bottom  heavy sound.  Classics here are &quot;Zero The Hero&quot; &quot;Born  Again&quot; and the underrated &quot;Hot Line.&quot;  The cover art on this  album certainly didn't do anything to improve the Sabs reputation, eh?
B000002JSV|5.0|Powerage is my favorite AC/DC disc with Bon Scott, and possibly my favorite, period!  I don't know why this album hasn't sold better over the years than it has with tunage such as &quot;Down Payment Blues,&quot;  &quot;Gone Shooting&quot; (featured in the Beavis and Butt-head soundtrack)  and one of my all time personal faves &quot;Riff Raff.&quot;  Bon is at his  mischievious best and Angus knows just where to solo, giving Bon the floor  at all the right times.  Check this one out!
B000002B7O|4.0|When I first heard &quot;Diary of a Madman&quot; I thought Oz might be chillin a bit and taking a scary walk down introspective lane.  But who am I kidding? &quot;Believer&quot; and &quot;Over The Mountain&quot; totally  kick! One of my all time metal faves is the rollicking &quot;Flying High  Again.&quot;  And who cares if &quot;You Can't Kill Rock and Roll&quot; and  &quot;Little Dolls&quot; don't rock out... they add to the gloom atmosphere  that is brillantly acheived throughout.  Definitely an album to sit down  and enjoy in its entirety.  Hey, Oz Nug, you're a walking hard rock/metal  encyclopedia!
B000002JOF|5.0|I would definitely have to agree with the sterling comments shared by other Rea fans here... &quot;The Road to Hell&quot; is a stunning commentary on modern day society.  Rea's imagery and use of symbolism to  convey his thoughts is nothing short of genius here.  He has rarely played  slide guitar more effectively and emotionally than he does here.  I have  owned this record for nearly five years and still play it often.  My  friends have asked to borrow it when I've been playing it on road trips and  they can't believe that with material like this, Rea isn't a better known  figure. Faves here include &quot;The Road to Hell,&quot; &quot;Texas,&quot;  (which sounds like a song written for Stevie Ray Vaughn) and &quot;Looking  for a Rainbow.&quot;  All and all, one of the late '80s/early 90's stronger  collections in the genre.
B000001ELD|2.0|Gene, what was going on in your head here?  I thought you liked to rock, I thought you spit blood and breathed fire!  But dueting with the likes of Donna Summer and Helen Reddy is beyond comprehendible!  What the heck are  those strings doing in the background?  A wah-wah guitar?  The only thing  that saves you from one-star shame here is.... I don't even know.
B000002KE2|3.0|I knew that Vol. 4 would receive rave reviews from pretty much everyone, so I had to put my two cents in here.  All my friends think this is the definitive Sab disc but I have know idea why.  Yeah &quot;Wheels Of  Confusion/The Straightener&quot; kicks things off nicely, but from there  the results are scattershot.  &quot;Changes&quot; is not one of my  favorites, not necessarily being a bad song but it just has no business  doing.  &quot;FX&quot; is filler at its most obvious, many people mistaking  this as feedback genius and &quot;St. Vitus' Dance&quot; is a limp noodle.   I do like &quot;Under the Sun...&quot; so at least the album is bookended  well.  Overall, I don't think this album has a thing on Master of Reality  or Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, call it about on par with Technical Ecstasy.  Classic cover art.
B000002L7V|3.0|Sacred Heart is not one of my favorite Dio albums.  He kinda tarnished his killer track record on this one.  I'm not sure why the recording sounds so prehistoric here, but the lack of treble on this album is down right  irritating!  Songs like &quot;Shoot Shoot&quot; and &quot;Another Lie&quot;  are right up there with the best of them though.
B000002KKS|4.0|I love Oz, but in the late '70's it was time for him to get out of Sabbath.  Their music was losing focus and getting more light with both late 70's releases (Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die!) Just in time,  Iommi brought in RJD to take over the mic.  The results are fairly  inspired.  I always kinda thought &quot;Neon Knights&quot; was a sub-par  tune but I know most of my fellow listeners will disagree.  Iommi sounds  like he had a light bulb go off in his head when coming up for the suburb  riffs in &quot;Children of the Sea,&quot; &quot;Die Young,&quot;  &quot;Lonely Is the Word,&quot; and of course the title track.  And Geezer  is playing his most creative bass since Sabotage.  I was sad to see Bill  Ward leave in the middle of the H&amp;H tour.  Perhaps this is why their  follow-up Mob Rules is comparatively flat.
B000000OPZ|3.0|Whitesnake finally hit paydirt in '87 with the release of their eponymous titled album.  This album has sold over an amazing 10 million copies in the last 11 years!  Unfortunately, for anyone familiar with earlier  blues-rooted Whitesnake, this album serves as a reminder of a dispointing  sell-out.  Coverdale seemed more interested in coping chics than making  well-constructed tunes with this album.  Although &quot;Still of the  Night&quot; and &quot;Crying in the Rain&quot; serve as powerful hard rock  anthems, the rest of the album contains deflated balladry in &quot;Is This  Love&quot; and &quot;Don't Turn Away&quot; and hair metal cliches with  &quot;Bad Boys&quot; and &quot;Children of the Night.&quot;  Of course, we  are all used to bad lyrics from Coverdale (the man has a one track mind).   This sits on the shelf most of the time, outplayed easily by &quot;Slide It  In&quot; and &quot;Ready an' Willing.&quot;
6305171769|4.0|Jamie Lee Curtis is a MOVIE QUEEN. She truly shows Michael who is boss. I have never seen any of the previous Halloween movies - but I will after seeing this one! A Must SEE!!! ALTHOUGH, it took a while for the movie to  get going...and once it did - it went too fast!!!
B000003PLZ|4.0|This is where Whitesnake came from: their roots were at bluesy, beat-driven hard rock.  This is the best representation of early 'Snake, after Coverdale ironed the ass-backwardness out of his music (see  &quot;Trouble&quot;) and before he became a shameless sell-out  (&quot;Whitesnake '87&quot;).  Great songs which range from the  reflectiveness of &quot;Ain't Gonna Cry No More&quot; to party-hearty  &quot;Black &amp; Blue&quot; are here.
0767816641|5.0|I'm always on the lookout for good family films, and I thought this was one of the best films of 1998, period.  Nothing offensive to the ear (except for one minor swear word) or to the brain, this treats its audience  as intelligently as it treats its wonderful source material.  A surprise  and a delight!
B000002B7S|4.0|Bark at the Moon was the first Ozzy album I owned, and it holds fond memories.  Oz seems to be wearing his heart on his sleeve with songs like &quot;You're No Different.&quot;  I couldn't bring myself to give this one  five stars because of the watery ballad &quot;So Tired&quot; and the goofy  &quot;Slow Down.&quot;  &quot;Waiting for Darkness&quot; is one of my all  time Oz favorites. Overall, this is a solid collection from his drunken  daze.  Note:  there is a kick-ass version of &quot;Bark at the Moon&quot;  on his 1993 Live CD.
630416923X|5.0|I'm writing this at Christmas 1998.  I put off buying this for two whole years because of the cost.  My wife finally bought it for me as a Christmas gift, and I can say that it was worth every penny!  For a Beatles fan, this  is manna from heaven.  It's completely in-depth but NEVER boring.  What a  blast from the past!
B000001EAQ|3.0|To use a baseball analogy, you can't hit a home run every time you bat and U2 gets at least a bloop single for &quot;POP.&quot; Although, the disk did stay in my CD Player for 5-6 months.  The best songs are Gone, Please and  If You Wear That Velvet Dress. Some of the songs are experimental and I am  ok with that, but, it's not what I want to hear from these guys.  The title  track and Mofo sound like The Edge is experimenting with chainsaws.  If you  are new to U2, buy The Joshua Tree or War and leave this one off.  But for  diehards like me, this one will be added to the collection, but, only for  looks.
0684800713|5.0|American expatriates and a spoilt English Upper Class woman in Europe in the 1920s, the gay life in Paris, fishing and bullfighting, the Fiesta in Pamplona - the ingredients Hemingway so brilliantly used to construct one  of the 20th century`s most famous and read novel. Here Hemingway`s  structure, his narrative style with the simple use of language really came  on display for the first time. A book that totally gripped me and  fascinated me. Excellent, brilliant, simply Ernest Hemingway!
6304106017|1.0|This movie at the begining was reminding me of Pulp Ficton but trailed of into a moranic tailspin. I just can't see who could enjoy a movie where when asked &quot;what do you these people are&quot;, and Clooney replies  &quot;Well there vampires.&quot;, in a tone as if vampires attack him every  day.
6302238331|1.0|I was disappointed with this film, having heard all the good reviews.  The chase scene really isn't that spectacular.  I could not believe it when I saw this garbage beat out A Clockwork Orange for best picture!  For a  better action flick, check out Dirty Harry; It has a much better chase  scene which involves Clint Eastwood riding on the roof of a school bus.
0792151720|5.0|Titanic was a movie that will be titled as a classic for years to come.  Aside from the wonderful screenplay, the actors performed well also.  This was one of the films starring Di Caprio that did not aggrivate me.   Personally, I think that he is a terrible actor and cannot make any of his  portrayed characters look believable.  Kate Winslet had an outstanding  performance.  This is the movie that will make Winslet a star.  The only  reason that she did not win the Oscar is because she is English and because  the Oscar winners are rigged.  All of the actors performed greatly in this  romantic-story that will be held in the hearts of moviegoers everywhere.
B000001FMQ|5.0|Unlike some commenters, I love this album for its pure music appeal. It IS ROCK! It is the beginning of Paul Stanleys Keyboard phase where he started to write songs on piano first then move it to the studio.  If you want some  excellent Post Makeup Kiss this is the second best beyond Hot In The Shade.   Thumbs Up Guys!
6305003882|5.0|Leo does a wonderful job. This is one of his better movies compared to some of the others. A great cast as well. Just an excellent movie!
0812550706|3.0|Ok, everyone loved this book.  The guy who recommended it to me loved this book.  But personally, I found it only &quot;OK&quot;.  I think a video-game-playing teenager would have liked this book a lot more than I:  it's very simplistic, heroic, and predictable.  Also, it contains some  physics flaws which always irk me in sci-fi books (e.g. in null gravity if  you try to punch someone, your body would NOT go flying backward as fast as  your fist goes forward: there's a mass difference!  This is why the Earth  doesn't go flying out of orbit when we launch rockets!)<br />Anyway, that  said, I still got some enjoyment out of the book.  But I don't think it  belongs in a list of all-time sci-fi greats.
B000002IQ9|5.0|Album matches tour of the same name.  Album recorded in Germany matched tour seen in New York City.  Music quality excellent.  Only shortcoming is there was some material deleted from the concert on the CD which you can  catch on the video version.
6304457391|5.0|Even with today's special effects, continuous action, and numbing &quot;entertainment,&quot; Seven Days remains equal to the task of grabbing a viewer and presenting a well thought-out scenario of intrigue, complex  maneuver, and outstanding flow. There is little &quot;action&quot; here.   Only excellent acting, superb plot, and careful direction.  The ending is  even well done (a rarity).  A must-see.
0792151712|5.0|As I watched this movie unfold, I felt as if we were almost looking over one of the passenger's shoulders as this tragedy unfolded.  James Cameron did an exceptional job.  It is too bad that &quot;some&quot; critics see  this movie as just another &quot;vehicle&quot; for DiCaprio to gain fame.   I do believe all of the actors in this movie did a great job.  Gloria  Stuart, as she was telling her story, gave me &quot;goosebumps&quot; she  was so believable.  I was amazed at the camera work in this movie.  At the  beginning of the movie when they are coming upon the wreck of the Titanic,  I felt so much emotion seeing it there on the bottom of the ocean floor -  it certainly set the mood of the entire movie.  In one shot, as the sceen  fades from the young Rose to the old Rose, by showing a close up of their  eyes, it looked like the same eye.  Also, when Rose is going below deck to  find Jack and she steps off of the steps into the cold sea water and it  takes her breath away, I could almost feel my chest restrict.       <br />I  own a video store and have been going to the show almost every week-end  since I was a child and this movie takes my breath away.  I have only seen  it 24 times, but I am sure I will watch it a &quot;couple&quot; more times.  <br />If you have not experienced this movie, I highly recommend seeing it,  you will certainly be glad you did.
0783222475|5.0|I think this movie was really cool.  It had a good plot, and some cool scences.  I recomend this to those who like action movies
0385486804|2.0|This is a lame book.  You can condense the whole thing into this:  A nut of a guy, travels around like a hobo; there are descriptions of other nuts cases; and the author tells a few of his climbing stories. This is a short  story that has been hyped into a book.  Waste of time.
0783229011|5.0|the talking mice are hilarious!The pig thinks he's a sheep pig!The movie is the best of pig movies! The puppies are so cute!!!!!!!
0062502174|5.0|Oh, come on now!!!! Are we so abysmally cynical that we cannot appreciate a story that unpretentiously illustrates one of the truly great things about being sentient beings: the ability to recognize our passions and then  (gasp) actually PURSUE them? &quot;The Alchemist&quot; is a profound  writing... all the more so due to its abject simplicity. The first time I  read it I was 26, it meant nothing but was a little amusing. I read it  again at 28, in the throes of a personal tragedy, then it was uplifting and  compelling. I re-read it this year, at 31, and it is like an old friend:  comforting, inspiring and even a little ridiculous. It is a joy to read,  and if nothing else, should remind one not to be so serious about all these  things we get so freaked out over in this life. A simple map to the  treasure is what so many want... here it is. Beware, though... it is so  simple and unadorned that one may be compelled to look for a more  complicated path. A good read!
0684874350|5.0|An excellent book. It is so moving and touching. I found myself crying and laughing at the same time. You could hear Frank's Irish accent throughout this heart-wrenching book. I would love to meet Frank McCourt someday.
0385471483|5.0|Es un libro lleno de pasion y magia. Es una historia encantadora, me facino como la autora te encierra en de tal manera que no puedes dajar de leer.
B000002GJH|5.0|This is a cd I have to order - as I've worn the tape to dust.  It is within the stack I'll take when retiring to a deserted island.
6305052158|1.0|This is one of those movies put out by a company that bought the rights but did not restore it.  Honestly, it looks worse than a version that you could record off of the television.  I would not recommend buying this  movie until it is released in a remastered version by Paramount.  It is not  worth the money.  &quot;One Eyed Jacks&quot; was and still is one of my  favorite all time movies, but after seeing this copy I returned it to the  store because of the poor quality.
0399143904|2.0|I have been trying to get through this book with two thoughts in mind - when will it get better and why is he just rehashing the last book.  If I had my druthers, I would have just listened to it on cassette.  The  specifics of the special ops unit has been the only part of the book that  has been interesting.
1558803602|5.0|Holly Hunter &amp; Richard Dreyfus were wonderful in this film.  John Goodman was the added ingredient that helped blend this into a funny romantic show.<br />The scenery and special effects were great.
6304817037|5.0|Well, any doubts about Clapton's ability to crank out awe-inspiring blues guitar are put to death here.  This video takes you through an entire Clapton concert from the summer of 1996, and EC is definitely on-target.   ALL of the songs are played terrifically, although the standouts to me are  &quot;Have You Ever Loved a Woman&quot; (for the solo), &quot;I Shot the  Sheriff&quot; (again, great solo), and &quot;Badge.&quot;<br />The set list  also includes &quot;Wonderful Tonight,&quot; &quot;Five Long Years,&quot;  &quot;Tore Down,&quot; &quot;White Room,&quot; and the acoustic version of  &quot;Layla,&quot; although when buying this video I had hoped it to be the  original version.  Still great, though.<br />I never tire of watching this  tape.  I'd be interested in how it compares to the 24 Nights video; I'm  sure they are very similar.  Hard to believe, though, how one man can play  the guitar so well for so long and still manage to come up with new and  inventive material for his solos show after show.  This is a must-have for  all EC fans.
B000002UDB|5.0|While this was not an intentional album ontheir part, this CD must rate 5 stars on the &quot;singles&quot; side.  &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; is one of the greatest songs ever written and along with  discmates &quot;Baby, You're a Rich Man&quot; and &quot;I Am the  Walrus&quot; three of the greatest B-sides of all time.  Throw in the #1's  &quot;Penny Lane&quot;, &quot;Hello,Goodbye&quot;, and &quot;All You Need  is Love&quot;, the unusual title track, the beautiful &quot;Fool on the  Hill&quot; and the avant garde &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot; and  &quot;Flying&quot; and suddenly you have a masterpiece.  O.K. &quot;Your  Mother Should Know&quot; is weak.<br />It's just strange that this wasn't  conceived as an album and is widely seen as a failure on the band's part,  but is still so wonderful.<br />One of my 20 favorite albums of all time.
B00000F1D3|5.0|Believe is by far Cher's best work in years!  I heard the title track at a club in San Diego and was mesmerized by the video!  She knows how to produce the music for the 90's!  I suggest to anyone who has ever even  listened to Cher, to buy this one!  For us Cher fans, she even re-mixed  &quot;We All Sleep Alone&quot;!!!!  BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT!
6305169187|1.0|I have never in my life seen a more formulastic, unorginal movie in my life and most of the movies they were copying were bad movies them seleves. This has a multiplying effect of making it the WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!.  most porn movies have better scripts. I spent most of my time either  wretching at the lame plot and characthers to laughing at the totaly ripped  off plot lines in the movie. It was like they had an outline or a formula  for an action summer movie and they just filled  in the story like an  equation being done in a blackboard, by the way i spent most of the time  cheering for the asteroid.
B000003CMB|5.0|This is simply the finest rock guitar you will hear.  There are some wonderful recordings by Jerry Garcia, Clapton, Richards, Alvin Lee, and Hendrix, but this album is far above any of them.  If you love electric  guitar, you must listen to Duane Allman and Dickey Betts at the Fillmore!   You will not hear better!
6304457391|5.0|though filmed in black and white,the story line is so seamless that you become riveted to the screen.
B000002I25|4.0|Wow, I can't believe how much you guys love this album!  The Doors started an unfortunate trend in rock music (the best album first).  While this is a truly great album, it is also not as original as doors fans want you to  think.  Morrison goes out of his way to talk about incest and anal sex and  I'm sure that keeps some of the people who like rock for its shock value  happy, most of this is just standard, average rock with organs.  Organs  don't make this band great any more than a flute made Jethro Tull great.   Again, it's a very good album, but worship of the Doors is not proscribed.   P.S.  &quot;The End&quot; is really quite terrible.
6301161572|5.0|A truly gripping and dramatic film.  This is cinematic opera at its best, bringing music and theatre exultantly to life on screen.  Enjoy the lustrous costumes and beautiful performances.  If anyone doubted that opera  still has a place in today's world of drama then this will truly show  them!<br />Magnificent!
B0000024SI|5.0|I bought this album because of &quot;It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry&quot;, a wonderful bluesy song -although I like more the Bangladesh version- and &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;. But the other  tunes are underrated. My other fave ones are &quot;Just Like Tom Thumb's  Blues&quot; and &quot;Queen Jane Aproximately&quot;. I prefer more the  works of Dylan starting from this album until Slow Train Coming. The  previous ones are excellent on their own, but this one, besides changing  the course of modern music history, is excitingly electrifying, loaded of  bluesy and singable tunes. Yes, I admit  I like the way it is sung; you  cannot take Zimmie's voice out of context. I mean what would this songs be  with another vocalist? There is an unforgetable mood in the recordings that  makes the instruments and the voice flow in a magical blend of notes and  sounds. Some jerks are expecting to hear the 3 tenors or the 5 divas, which  might be cool; but for the sake of the artistry I cannot imagine another  singer doin' &quot;...don't put on any airs when your down on Rue Morgue  avenuuuue&quot;, Pavarotti/ Carreras? &quot;..they'll really make a mess  outta youuu&quot;. Gimme a break, please. If a hundred stars would be  available, I'd rate this album at least 101 stars, along with &quot;Blonde  on Blonde&quot; and &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot;, the other couple of  Lucky's masterpieces. By the way, do not forget  that thanks to Dylan the  greatest guitarrist of all times decided to start singing.
0783226837|5.0|Tremors tells the classic story of a small community fighting for survival against underground monsters.  It's classic horror-movie stuff with a twist:  unlike most Hollywood horror flicks, the characters look and talk  like real people, and as the story progresses, you actually root for them  to win.  The last horror flick I saw where I didn't cheer for the monsters  was the original 'Night of the Living Dead' (1969).  The cast makes the  people of Perfection real to us, and the dialogue is as sharp and funny as  the best Mel Brooks movie.  The action is fast-paced, but the tone is  always positive.  This film is great fun; I never get tired of watching it.   Be sure to check out the &quot;Making of...&quot; feature and the original  ending; excellent documentaries from the film-makers.  You'll enjoy this  disk for years to come.
0964385619|5.0|Once I started reading this book at the local bookshop I couldn't put it down, so I bought it.  I was amazed at how simple Robert's principles are,they are things that everyone is capable of seeing through to the end.   The entire book is summed up by &quot;the No 1 rule, the only rule&quot;.   I now look at my possessions in a different light, that is worthless  devaluing pieces of junk.  Robert not only tells the reader what he/she  should be spending their hard earned cash on but how to do it.  The book is  very user friendly.  I felt as if I was talking to Robert on a one to one  basis.  After reading this book you will become an authority on it's  teachings.
B000002UB6|5.0|This album has been routinely bashed, yet I believe it to be a terrific work.  If any other band had been handed this material and recorded it, they would have been hailed as geniuses. &quot;Let It Be&quot;, &quot;The  Long and Winding Road&quot; and &quot;Get Back&quot; are, of course,  masterpieces(all Paul's), but &quot;Across the Universe&quot;, &quot;Two of  Us&quot;, &quot;I've Got a Feeling&quot;, &quot;Dig a Pony&quot; and  &quot;I, Me, Mine&quot; are also great.  The other songs are more or less  filler to my ears. <br />The Beatles played this without a whole lot of studio  gimmicks and Phil Spector's production didn't help any, but it stacks up  nicely against what bands like the Stones, The Who, and the Doors were  putting out at the time so I can't 4 star it.  It's gotta be 5.
0790729628|5.0|Every shot a perfect photo... shadows and light... Vangelis' best work... perhaps the best work of all main characters... violence that appropriately makes you feel sad... you must pay attention and think... every viewing  reveals new details. My all-time favorite movie.  Love both versions.  Didn't miss voice-over in director's cut until Rutger Hauer death scene.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|It has a very neat secret hidden in it!!!! Pop it in your CD-Rom drive  there are music video's hidden on it!!!!
0395759242|5.0|Well-researched and well-written, a long overdue look back at the holocaust of the Belgian Congo.  With care and perspective, Hochschild examines the colonization and decimation of the Congolese and comes up with  a scathing damnation of Leopold and his minions.  He places the saga  squarely in the social and historical contexts of Africa and Europe at  large, and gives credit where credit is due to the human rights advocates  who tried to put a stop to the enslavement.  <br />A hell of a book. Colonial  apologists and deniers will not be pleased.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road is quite simply the strongest album ever made.  Side one kicks off with &quot;Come Together&quot; which is a mean little romp through Lennon's perspective on his own life, and quickly leads into a beautiful  love song by George, &quot;Something.&quot;  This song leaves you thinking  that even though this guy's madly in love, something's just not wuite right  in the relationship.  Next come two fun tunes, &quot;Octopus's Garden&quot;  and &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot; (only the Beatles could pull off  either of these songs sucessfully) split by McCartney's vocal tour de force  &quot;Oh Darling.&quot;  A guitar jam follows (I Want You) and leaves your  adreneline pupmed for what is to follow.  Side two is a roller coaster ride  of textures, melodies and jams woven together in a magical tapestry with  hints of themes sticking with you just  barely.  When you think you've got  hold of one song you're on to another.  You can listen to this CD in the  worst of moods and when you're done you'll be in a good mood.  I promise.
B000002BSG|3.0|Just when you thought there was a single band in the world not fueled by greed. On &quot;Travelling Without Moving&quot;, Jamiroquai take their music to a new level: &quot;Commercial&quot;. Meaning you've probably scene  the video for &quot;Virtual Insanity&quot; countless times. Forget the  sincerety and quality of the previous albums and prepare for cars, women  and all the excesses that have preserved the longevity of bands like the  Rolling Stones.<br />This effort encorporates one song from nearly every genre  of black music. Disco, Reggae, Jungle to whiny &quot;Boyz II Men&quot; type  ballads and a bit of rock-ish influence but very, very little in the way of  Funk, Soul or Jazz from which the band won critical acclaim. The almost  non-existant range of Jason Kay's songwriting and lyrical structure seems  to remain.<br />Make no mistake, the album does have it's funky moments.  &quot;Do you Know Where You're Coming From?&quot;, the bonus track on the  US lp, is a worthy drum n' bass tune. But if you suffer from insomnia let  &quot;Virtual Insanity&quot;, &quot;Alright&quot; and &quot;Spend a  Lifetime&quot; be your cure. Several issues to which Jay would previously  object are executed quite easily. It makes one wonder if Sony was the  driving force behind this record.<br />This is not a fake plastic pop version  of the band. In fact, it's a revelation. Jay Kay no longer parades as an  eco-friendly man with a mission, but rather as himself. It shows us also  the future of Jamiroquai's music as being less interesting as time goes.  Thus, &quot;Travelling&quot; is deep in a shallow sort of way.
B000000W5N|5.0|As a young Beatles fan, I was quickly drawn to the Stones and after Hot Rocks, I bought this.  Wow, what a fantastic album.  It's the Anti-&quot;Abbey Road.&quot;  Every song on Abbey Road drives you to the  ultimate conclusion-happiness.  Every song on this album drives me to  depression.  It is easily one of the greatest albums ever made.  Not a  flaw.  If you're a casual fan then hear this.  &quot;Brown Sugar&quot;,  &quot;Wild Horses&quot; and &quot;Bitch&quot; are the WEAK songs.   &quot;Moonlight Mile&quot; is one of the greatest songs ever recorded.   &quot;I Got the Blues&quot; is wrist-slitting ecstasy.  &quot;Sister  Morphine&quot; makes me know what it's like to be strung out.  &quot;Dead  Flowers&quot; is a masterpiece of in-your-face relationship ending.   &quot;Sway&quot;, &quot;Can't You Here Me Knocking&quot; and &quot;You  Gotta Move&quot; are awesome.  AWESOME, I TELL YOU.  If you don't own this  one, you don't have a music collection.<br />This is the only album to rank up  there in my book with the Beatles quintet of albums, &quot;Abbey  Road&quot;, &quot;Pepper&quot;, &quot;The Beatles&quot;, &quot;Rubber  Soul&quot; and Revolver&quot; BUY IT NOW.
B000003NA4|5.0|I am a classic rock listener by heart and never heard of Diana Krall (jazz was for wimps). After listening to Love Scenes, my whole perspective on music changed. I now have all of Diana's albums, some Shirley Horn and  Holly Cole. Thanks to my special friend who showed me another dimension to  my music listening pleasure. Thank you A.
0792151712|4.0|I watched it 2 times on the big screen................. but the small- screen just don't seem the same.  Less tears, Less space, Less excitment. It didn't seem 2 have the same impact on me as the theater. Even the acting  didn't seem as good as b4 and Leo less cute.

6304480415|5.0|Oklahoma is a wonderful musical full of catchy tunes, rip stomping dancing and a comfortable mix of comedy and tragedy.  This movie makes a great first musical for anyone who thinks musical theatre is boring and  uninteresting.  With a healthy mix of cowboys, farmers, pretty girls, and  eye popping color Oklahoma is sure to be a hit with your family.  Reel the  boys in with the cowboys, fight scene and the hilarious antics of the  entire cast of Oklahoma.  Nobody can beat Rogers &amp; Hammerstein when it  comes to the movie musical. It makes you want to kick up your heels and  dance a jig.
B000002LIR|5.0|I've been a fan of Rod Stewart's for more than 20 years - he's a musician who has developed his talent to a truly &quot;one of a kind&quot; stage &amp; has surpassed a generation gap!!!  He has been with all of us  &quot;baby boomers&quot; through all of those difficult developmetal stages  - &amp; he has come out a winner!!!  Listen to him &amp; feel the growth!!!  Great guy - great talent - &amp; great spokesperson for us!!!  My kids love  him!!!
6303224644|5.0|Although this movie was set in 1904, the themes presented are timeless.  The movie deals with young love, life mistakes and choices, choosing between career desires or familial fulfillment and most importantly the  strength one can derive from family.  Nobody sings it like Judy and  Margaret O'Brien is at her best.  Make this movie a family favorite at your  house.
6304331185|5.0|this is a movie that you can not be watching while talking to friends or eating dinner. This is a movie that when paying full attention you still have to watch it 2 or 3 times to really understand Kevin Spacey's character
0783114222|5.0|12 one-hour stories that are both unified and separate that describe events surrounding the Apollo program.  Each one is a gem - together they are priceless.  I watched them 3 days ago and am still floored by what I  saw.  There are no let-downs and each is better than you'd expect.  Yes,  I'm gushing but - dang it - these are the real deal!  Lots of great  performances by lots of unexpectedly familiar actors.
0345350499|5.0|&quot;The Mists of Avalon&quot; by Marion Zimmer Bradley, is probably my most favourite book.  I first picked it up from a friend and was immediately captivated just from reading the first page.  Being a Pagan  myself, I found it fascinating to read what my religion was like in the  days of the legendary King Arthur.  Arthur himself is not nearly the center  of the book, away from the norm of Arthurian legends.  The book focuses on  the &quot;evil&quot; Morgan le Fey, Morgaine of the Fairies, whom doesn't  appear evil at all.  Morgaine is adopted by Avalon to become a priestess  where she flees after a fight with her Aunt Viviane, Lady of the Lake.  She  is then bounced from court to court, always feared and looked down upon for  being a strong female and a priestess.  The book is so amazing real and  fits in perfectly with all Arthurian legends, from the ravings of the  beautiful yet brain-washed Gwenhwyfar and her Christian priests to the  relieving open-mindedness of the ladies of the Goddess and the Druid bards.   I recommend every human to read this book, though most will probably not  be able to leaf through it's 800+ pages easily.  A beautiful story/
6300151379|5.0|This was my favorite movie when i was younger and i was looking for it for Christmas.... what can people possibly do to get the publisher to re-print it?
B000002HMH|4.0|My grandma bought me this album for christmas, just because she knew I liked Metallica. I own all thier older albums, and had written them off like a lot of other people. But, this isn't a bad album. Its not as good as  Master or the even the black album, but it has some good tunes and explores  issues closer to home the earlier albums. Because, after all, Songs like  Sanitarium and For whom the bell tolls may kick ass, but how often are you  thrown in a mental hospital or sent out on a battle field to die? Having  people lay thier problems on you (not my bitch) or dealing with people who  think they are the whole world (king nothing) are more common problems.  And, for all the people that say Metallica &quot;sold out&quot; with the  black album, how many of you actually heard of Metallica before that? If it  weren't for the balck album metallica would still be toiling in obscurity,  with far fewer albums sold, and therefore far less impact on the music  scene and society in general. So get of thier back, all you people can't  agree on when they sold out anyway. I heard a guy say they sold out after  Kill 'em All. THAT WAS THIER FIRST ALBUM!!! Some say the band died with  Cliff Burton. They didn't sell 25 million albums and most of you would have  never heard of them with him anyway. He was great, and Master is better  than load, but Jason is also a fine bass player. Others say they sold out  with the black album. Thats where they changed a lot, but have you ever  thought that it was because they were tired of touring thier asses off and  making great albums and not really being recognized for it? Metallica  started a new brand of Music, and nobody can ever forget that. And, if you  want to buy a rock album that was released after 1995, it's either  Metallica or Eve 6. I rest my case. Plus, my Grandma rules for buying an  album with sperm on the cover.
B0000025HU|5.0|I don't think it gets any better than this.  Every kind of music that falls into the category of 'rock' is represented here, and represented well.  After years of listening to this, I still laugh out loud at how GOOD  it is.  Music to drive by, get drunk by, and fight by.  I don't give out  many five star reviews, either.
B000002H33|5.0|This is the greatest Metallica album ever. With heavy riffs, heavy subject matter, and excellent song writing, Master of Puppets is the true king of thrash metal albums. Buy it, you won't be dissapointed.
6303921248|5.0|Never mind the romance, I never appreciated Jane Austen's wit until I saw A&amp;E's rendition of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. The stars Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth are perfectly cast but so are all the secondary roles.  The interaction between Mr. and Mrs. Bennett is portrayed with perfect  comic timing as is the role of the nerdy cousin, Mr. Collins.  If you can  take your eyes off the beautiful scenery, listen to the music as well.  The  leit-motifs for each character is distinctive and beautifully orchestrated.   Like &quot;Star Wars&quot;, you can tell which character is coming simply  by listening to the music.  My husband and I have watched this movie  several times.  Our two eldest daughters, a gifted seventh and gifted sixth  grader,  also enjoyed the movie very much and consider it one of their  favorites. I have recommended this movie more than any other.  It also  brought me back to the Austen novels which I enjoy more because I  understand them better.  Kudos to A&amp;E for this cinematic  accomplishment.
6305169187|5.0|This movie had it all, the sexy men and the action. Ben Affleck is soooo hottt!! The movie had lot of humor with serious stuff. The scary thing is it could really happen today. I want to see more Ben!!! Hey Ben, great  singing!!

B00000G3PA|5.0|Even though the story dips a few times the whole experience is spectacular with some of the most incredible effects I've ever seen. I can't wait to see the DVD and go single frame through the destruction of New York scene  which makes Godzilla look like a walk in the park.
0792139771|5.0|What hasn't been said about this glorious film event?  It has all the elements of the all-time great epic movies:  great scenery, great story, great action, great music, great direction and great stars.  Mel Gibson is,  quite simply, one of the finest storytellers in the film industry today.   Writer Randall Wallace (no relation to William Wallace) has the wonderful  ability to tell a portion of the history of Scotland without making us feel  small for not knowing about it ahead of time.  Very few people DO know much  Scotish history.  Sure, some of the story was a little farfetched, and some  of it was not quite true.  Then again, some of the things William Wallace  did just couldn't be shown on screen - they're too grossly gory for even  the most callous of late 20th century viewers.  The supporting cast was  excellent, believable and altogether Celtic in their enjoyment of a good  fight.  With touches of humor, life in the war-camps, the trials of  arrainged marriages in the Middle Ages and the foolish ambitions of  egotistical polititions, we could almost feel that this wonderful movie was  meant to be a documentary instead of the fabulous fictional story of a  truly great man.  Mel Gibson deserves all the accolades he has gotten for  his glorious brave heart.
630512065X|4.0|We saw the Broadway production several years ago, and this video rekindled those memories. No video can replicate the essence and intimacy of the stage production we saw where the &quot;cats&quot; climbed up into the  balcony and through the aisles.  We felt we were actually part of the  scenery! The electric energy of the performance stayed with us for many  years.   I was at first disappointed with the video, but after taking my  4and a half year old grandchild to the National Theater this December to  see Cats live  (I now have a stagestruck grandchild who wants to grow up  and be a CAT on stage!), I could compare the advantages of each. The stage  production gives you the whole picture, and you sense the engery. YOu can  look at the other cats during any solo, and they all respond in character!  THe video lets you see CLOSE UP the facial expressions and the depth of  character of each solo. YOu need BOTH!
1570425671|5.0|I have played Santa in a big-budget holiday review for 8 years, and really love it. One of my fellow actors brought this tape into my dressing room one night.  I laughed so hard I could hardly go onstage. Sedaris captures  perfectly what it feels like to be in the Holiday Business.  I'll share  this tape with all of my &quot;serious actor&quot; friends who must do  these shows just to make a living.  Its nice to know we're not alone.
6303027016|5.0|Robin Williams is exceptional (as usual) as the controversial radio disc-jockey Adrian Cronauer who is sent to Vietnam during the war to lift the military morale with his special brand of on-air banter.  Cronauer's  improvised, lightning-speed monologues keep getting him into strife with  his superiors, yet are adored by the soldiers who avidly listen to him.  While stationed in the war-torn country, Cronauer meets and gets to know  some of the locals intimately, and learns about the catastrophes and  disasters that lie beneath the airwaves through which his flippantly  humourous broadcasts are transmitted.<br />Cronauer's radio persona is an  accurate mirror of Williams himself, yet he also portrays well the man who  becomes more human and vulnerable as a result of his exposure to the  situation in his new  environment.<br />GMV is both side-splittingly  hilarious, touching and at times devastating, as we witness the horrors of  war contrasted against the light-hearted satirical entertainment of  Cronauer's on-air speeches.  There has also never been a more ironic use of  Louis Armstrong's &quot;What A Wonderful World&quot; than here, played as a  background to a heartbreaking montage of tragic images.<br />The soundtrack is  also excellent, blending some appropriately upbeat period tunes with  snippets of Williams funniest monologues.
0385486804|4.0|I don't know what to make of this story other than to say that Chris died a senseless death.Chris broke all the rules in his relentless search for peace. Was he looking for peace and quiet,or peace within his soul? Sadly  this book leaves many unanswered questions. While Krakauer does a  respectable job of telling this story, in the end we are still left with a  mystery. Did Chris go to the Alaska wilderness to die,or was his death a  result of his severe naivete about being prepared? I can understand wanting  to get away from a hurried, chaotic life; running off unprepared to  Alaska  shows a lack of common sense. I also have left the masses in favor of the  spritual release only wide open spaces provides. However, I would never go  unprepared. Chris played risk to an extreme and it tragically caught up  with him.     <br />We can learn a lot from Chris about ourselves.The fact  that we don't know everything leads to some very philosophical thoughts on  life,death, humanity,and the power of the wilderness and its proponent  authors to capture our minds. This book is great for helping to understand  ourselves even though we don't quite understand its main character.
6300216268|5.0|I have been raving about this movie for about 15 years now.  To see it once is to see it dozens of times.  I can recite it and still get something out of it every time.  It is by far, my favorite movie of all time.   Whenever you lack lust for life, see Maude in action. &quot;I feel that  much of the world's sorrow comes from people who are this.... allow  themselves to be treated as that.&quot;     Maude <br />I think we all have a  bit of Harold in us that is waiting for a Maude.<br />May you find it.

6300151379|5.0|It's a good movie for all ages, I mean we loved it! Everyone I know who's seen it says they liked it.It's a timeless classic, definately! It's a great combination of imagination, fantasy , humor and music! It should be  brought back, hey they did it for Star Wars and Grease. Why not Labyrinth,  if you see it I think you'll agree. Out of all of the great movies and  magic that the late Jim Henson brought us I think this was his best  creation!
B00000F1D3|5.0|One thing has always amazed me about Cher: despite having a very limited range and a set of vocal chords that pale in comparison to most female vocalists, she is still able to perform a song better than others more  physically capable.  With a singing career that now spans 3 decades, Cher  is no longer just the pretty face of a bland pop duo.  She's also no longer  17.  While growing older might be a disadvantage for other singers who live  in a youth-loving Pop world, Cher makes it chique to be wise.<br />Cher is  first and foremost a performer, and as she has grown as an actress, and  matured as a woman,so she has as a singer, and she uses her acting skills  and added experience to her advantage on every single track on BELIEVE.   Smart girl, huh?<br />Her last effort, IT'S A MAN's WORLD showed us a more  subdued, introspective Cher with an expanded vocal range.  It was some of  her best work in years, and although she showed that she knew her way  around a pop ballad, she lacked a certain amount of energy to make it  click.  The U.S. production of the album should mostly be to blame for  that, not Cher.<br />But BELIEVE is pure energy.  Not only is Cher's voice at  the peak of its performance style, she also attacks each song with an  exuberant power not seen since Tina Turner's PRIVATE DANCER. <br />This CD is  bathed in beautiful production values from start to finish, and all the  tracks have a wonderfully upbeat quality to them.  The title track,  &quot;Believe&quot;, is sheer, unadulterated dance floor fun. Cher's voice  is electronically altered on a couple of sections, for an amazingly  positive effect!  This is what 21st century music should sound  like.<br />&quot;The Power&quot; one of the few ballad's on the LP, is lifted  from mediocrity by Cher's mystic delivery.  Half-goddess, half-siren, this  is some of Cher's most mature singing.<br />&quot;All or Nothing&quot; is even  more danceable than the title track and should be her 2nd single from the  LP.  The more fun Cher has, the better her work sounds.<br />&quot;Dové  L'Amore&quot; works because Cher understands  that what makes her unique is  her ethnic/exotic qualities.  Although she is not from Italy, her rendering  of this song, and some of its Italian lyrics, is superbly latin in quality.   It's reminiscent of &quot;Gypsies, Tramps and Thieves&quot; in that it  captures her 'otherworldliness', but this time it's much more  sophisticated.  It's Madonna's  &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;, just less  contrived.<br />&quot;Takin' Back My Heart&quot; seems out of place on such a  strong album (which is strange, since Cher has had such good luck in the  past with Dianne Warren songs), and &quot;Taxi, Taxi&quot; suffers from a  bizarre song structure in the chorus that even Cher can't fix.<br />&quot;We  All Sleep Alone&quot;, Ritchie Sambora's metal ballad, that Cher originally  recorded in the 80's..should not have been redone.  This version adds  nothing but a bass back beat.  Like Bette Midler would say..&quot;Why  bother?&quot;<br />But perhaps the second half of the LP sounds less  interesting only because Cher has grown so much.  The second 1/2 of BELIEVE  is more like where Cher MIGHT have ended up if she hadn't taken voice  lessons, or grown as a performer.    Which explains why the Warren and  Sambora tracks sound so out of place.  Cher has outgrown Dianne Warren and  tacky metal ballads, she should leave those for Celine, Mariah and  Aerosmith.     As a 52 year old in the youth oriented Pop world..Cher needs  to play her own card game, and when she does, as is the case for most of  BELIEVE, she always has the upper hand.<br />As long as Cher keeps moving  forward and having fun, she will make me &quot;Believe.&quot;
0790725657|5.0|This movie is wonderful.  I have seen it at least 3 times, and finally I got it this Christmas.  Eventhough I am a teenager, I love this film. I think it is the imagination and magic that makes it rise above the rest.   Each time I have seen it, I couldn't help but cry towards the end.  This is  one of my favorite movies, and I highly recommend it for anyone.
0060977493|4.0|As an author ten years into her career with four novels of speculative fiction (search Mason, Lisa at Amazon.com) and two dozen short stories (search David Copperfield's Tales of the Impossible, Desire Burn, Immortal  Unicorn, Year's Best Fantasy and Horror Fifth Edition), I marvel at the  commercial success of this book, however brilliant at moments.  There must  be 10,000 manuscripts attempting word jazz/plot inversions that never make  it past a creative writer teacher, literary agent, or editor.  If you're a  new writer, don't even think about attempting such pyrotechnics.  And after  reading this book, cleanse your palate with something astringent--Double  Indemnity, say, or Night Train.  Also note that I find Rushdie unreadable,  Mistress of Spices enjoyable but weak in its fantasy elements, and explore  caste issues myself in my forthcoming fantasy epic PANGAEA, Book I (May,  1999) and PANGAEA, Book II (Oct, 1999), both from Bantam.  Two flaws  prevent Ms. Roy's book from becoming a major epic: (1) The untouchable who  is the moral heart of the personal tragedy and the larger politics isn't  explored vividly enough (for me).  What scenes there are of him are  wonderful, but somehow don't add up to enough.  Perhaps he should have made  his appearance much sooner.  The child molester in the theater is more  memorable!  Which I'm sure wasn't the author's intent.  (2) The political  maelstrom that ruins the family and their factory and stems from the  untouchable's heinous death is tossed off almost as an afterthought.  Roy  portrays so well the Communist leader's hypocrisy and the terror of being  trapped in a political demonstration, but shies away from showing the  ultimate storming of the capitalist bastion.  Which would have added a  deeper societal resonance and the sense of inexorable destiny.  Having said  all this, as a writer who enjoys word jazz (SUMMER OF LOVE) and plot  pyrotechnics (THE GOLDEN NINETIES and knowing full well that Roy can  justifiably say, &quot;Bugger out of my book,&quot; I found the twins  fascinating, the tragedy heart-breaking, and the irrational compulsion of  passion at the end erotic and deeply moving.say, &quot;Bugger out of my book,&quot; I found the twins  fascinating, the tragedy heart-breaking, and the irrational compulsion of  passion at the end erotic and deeply moving.
B00000DLVA|5.0|What a difference an engineer makes. They have always had an intriguing sound, but pure sweet pop. It's a little bit more of an indie sound this time. Cross Cocteau Twins with Sunscreem and I think you'd find this album  the outcome. Some dance, some Edge. Great sound.
B000001ABD|4.0|This is a WONDERFUL collection but it's missing two of my all-time favorite Stevie Wonder songs:  &quot;Isn't She Lovely&quot; (mentioned by another reviewer above) and &quot;Don't You Worry 'Bout a Thing&quot; (from  Innervisions).   If it just had these two songs on it I would call it a  perfect collection.

B000002H70|5.0|&quot;Fascination Street,&quot; &quot;Pictures of You,&quot; &quot;Plainsong,&quot; &quot;Untitled,&quot; and &quot;Lullaby.&quot; These songs are just classic Cure material. This is one band that is able to make  good music without being repetitively annoying. True, almost all of their  songs sound alike, but they are distinguishably the Cure (whoever heard a  Depeche Mode song and thought it was the Cure?). Robert Smith and crew pull  off a great album of intelligent songs with the regular trippy goth style  and bluesy rhythms. Get this album.
0790735172|5.0|If you are at all a Martial Arts fan see this film.  The best fight scenes ever recorded, beating anything Jackie Chan, Sammo Hung, and even anything else Bruce Lee ever did.  Sure the plot is hokey, but if Mortal Kombat  thought it was good enough to rip off completely, then it should be more  than good enough for any action fan.
B000002MIB|5.0|Loud, powerful, driven, and ass-kicking! &quot;Poundcake,&quot; &quot;Judgement Day,&quot; &quot;Ultra Bass,&quot; &quot;316&quot; (which I wish they would label &quot;316-Eruption...I mean the two are very  different songs...Eddie led in to Eruption real good, but come on!),  &quot;Jump,&quot; &quot;Pleasure Dome (Drum Solo),&quot;...all of them as  great as their album versions, if not better. Hagar's vocals actually sound  better on some songs (you gotta admit his voice is kinda annoying). His  interludes in &quot;Panama,&quot; &quot;Why Can't This Be Love&quot;  leading into &quot;Give to Live&quot;...at least it's funny and captures  the essence of the show. This is just a great live album.
6305127638|5.0|This is a dual threaded action/comedy Star Trek adventure. Up on the Enterprise orbiting the post World War III earth, the Borg are trying to take the Enterprise, which is heavy action and adventure of Picard versus  the Borg leader. While on the earth surface Will Riker, Diana Troi, and  Zephran Cocran (this character was introduced in the original Star Trek  series) are trying to get the first spacecraft with warp drive ready for  launch. They are under no big pressure so there are many jokes  interlaced... This is one of the best in the Star Trek Series.... a kind of  &quot;Star Trek: the Voyage Home&quot; humor mixed with &quot;Star Trek:  The Warth of Kahn&quot; action.
B0000029LG|4.0|Along with the greatest hits, the new material is not bad at all. This album really is somewhat disappointing (but how can MJ really turn out another album as good as Thriller?). &quot;Scream&quot; is a really good  techno rock song (and Trevor Rabin's one of my favorite musicians, so his  solos are great!). &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; is a typical MJ ballad,  while &quot;Stranger in Moscow,&quot; &quot;They Don't Care About Us,&quot;  and &quot;Earth Song&quot; are pretty good songs too. The cover of  &quot;Come Together&quot; is not bad (considering we all heard it on  Moonwalker). Basically your average MJ album, some good songs, but it seems  pretty clear that MJ will never regain the power and genius of Thriller.  What the hell, he does good work, and this album is worth the effort.

0790736942|2.0|Being an Exorcist fan for over 20 years, I had waited anxiously for The Exorcist 25th Anniversary Edition.  Unfortunately upon watching the tape, I found myself angered that Warner Home Video didn't care enough to place a  knowledgable team who completely knows this film in charge of the video's  production.<br />First of all, the &quot;3 original trailers&quot; boasted on  the video's packaging is incorrect.  The very first trailer (which yours  truly saw in 1973) isn't on the tape!  Furthermore, one of two (yes  &quot;two&quot; not &quot;three&quot;) trailers is actually a trailer from  the 1978/79 rerelease!  Additionally, there were television spots from  1973/74 which were different than the theatre trailers that Warner could  have used (I suspect they don't even know these TV spots exist), but did  not.<br />Secondly, when the film was rereleased in 1978/79 (I saw this  rerelease the day Dawn of the Dead was also released) it deleted what I  feel to be a crucial few seconds from the movie: the scene after Father  Merrin exits the cab and looks upon the house with light shimmering from  Regan's bedroom, you see the posessed girl's face morph into a chalk-white  vision seen only in Damian Karras' dream earlier in the film.  Originally,  this face contorted and showed the gastly vision for quite a few moments.   In the rerelease, the film cuts this scene down to just a brief  transformation before it quickly cuts into the next scene where Mrs.  Macneil opens the door for Merrin.<br />Perhaps the only positive aspect about  this video is the BBC &quot;Making of&quot; documentary.  Although quick  and concise, it doesn't go into specific detail on aspects like Lee J.  Cobb's death, other unused footage of background characters (servants Karl  and his wife had a drug addicted daughter in the novel; supposedly some of  this was filmed), and other tidbits for those who want to know  all-things-Exorcist.<br />Sadly,Warner even replaced the film's original,  black-and-red opening &quot;Warner Communications Company&quot;  introduction to its new &quot;Warner Home Video 75th Anniversary&quot;  design, robbing the initial sinister mood the original credits had  created.<br />Anyway, watching this as a regular movie is fine.  But to people  who are genuine Exorcist collectors, it is a disappointing effort.

Hearing her belt &quot;Memory&quot;  (which I have in person) is a thrill.  &quot;Cats&quot; has never been one  of my favorite shows, but this is a great memory of it.
B000002IO1|5.0|I really enjoyed listening to this album a long time ago - enough to replace my worn out tape with a CD. I like every track on it and its refreshing to find an album that lives up to the standard and the promise  of the first released track. If you're looking for a really raunchy rock  CD, this has to be it. All I can say is - what happened to Alannah Myles  after this?
B000002L5P|5.0|And it was the beginning for them and for me. Finally, after years lurking around, I found songs with lyrics that had to do with my life. Miserable lie is fantastic and any any album that contains the anthem Hand in Glove  must be rated 5 stars. Smiths: something else...
0385472951|4.0|This was an outstanding book.  It was very exciting, suspenseful, and  dramatic. I thought that it was not quite as good as The Firm but  definately up there with the rest of Grisham's books. Even though Patrick  had done a terrible thing I still sympathized with him, and I am not  usually with the 'bad guy', but I realy wanted Patrick to live in his  little dream world.
0446310786|5.0|To begin with, we should really rate this book more than 5 stars, but we can't.  It is the tragic story of unjustice in a small Southern town which is full of prejudices and mysterious secrets which are uncovered by the  heroine, Scout, her brother Jem and their friend Dill.  This is a wonderful  coming-of-age story, though it does not talk of the passage from  adolescence to adulthood, but shows how an 8 year old girl loses her  innocence.  We would strongly reccomend this book for young adults.  The  end succinctly wraps up the story, and the way the author puts the climax  in the beginning is wonderfully clever. In conclusion, this book shows so  much of our life, and we reccomend adolescents read this book because of  the insights of life it presents to the reader. Reader beware, To Kill A  Mockingbird will play upon your heart and soul and it will leave you  thinking about values you and others hold in your lives.  In short, we  loved it, and it is possibly one of the best books we will ever read.
6301942647|5.0|The winter of Kurosawa's life created this movie of eight dreams. These dreams transport us through many emotions by portraying tragedy, love, aloneness and beauty and end with a dream that appears to portray  Kurosawa's vision of heaven. It is an extremely beautiful and well crafted  film that invites revisiting from time to time because the themes it  contains are universal and timeless to the viewer; a sure keeper in my  video collection. It is a true work of art.
0792151712|5.0|Whatever one thinks of Leo's acting skills, or the  romantic plot line ( I know it's not in fashion to like sap), a viewer would have to be blind or obtuse to miss the awesome detail work that went into this movie.

B000002HHB|5.0|I really enjoyed this CD. Others that I know that didn't enjoy it critized the &quot;slowness&quot; and how it was not &quot;upbeat&quot; (Excluting Wonder and Jealousy) but it is the lyrics that really touch you.

0782008372|1.0|I love this movie and was excited that it was issued on DVD.  What a disappointment! The video quality was beyond terrible, rife with artifacts and breakup.  The resolution was worse than you'd see with a 20 year old  tape on a 20 year old VCR. The AC-3 was uneven with erratic volume levels  that rendered the dialogoue inaudible at times. Don't waste your money on  this bottom-of-the-heap DVD!

0446389234|1.0|A friend suggested this book to me. I have always been a great fan of DC comics, especially Batman. This account of the Dark Knight's earliest adventures completely disappointed me.  Even the binding of the book was  bad.  The pages ripped out of the book at such a rapid rate that I could  barely read it in order.  But even that didn't matter. The story was so  terrible that it was the same even if I read it backwards.  The art was so  bad, I didn't even know whether it was comic book art or a collection of  picassos(no offense to expressionist art).  I expected more from this  creative team.  but now I will never read any Batman story again.  Frankly,  I would rather watch an infomercial
0385484518|5.0|This one hit home and hard!  Well-written, and, more importantly, humanly written.  The feelings and emotions Mitch and Morrie shared are for real, believable and definable.  It's easy to feel the other characters as well,  even though they may only be referenced briefly.  As someone who has prided  herself on her &quot;childless by choice&quot; stance, I spent the weekend  wondering what was really at the root of those feelings.<br />If there isn't a  Morrie in your life, find one or be one.  Live life out loud.
0525457585|5.0|Perhaps the most telling thing about Ende's &quot;Neverending Story&quot; is the type of reader who seems to respond to it.  Just glancing at the other reader reviews, one sees children and adults, males and females.  In an age where films, novels, and music are targetted to specific gender and  age groups, this powerful novel stands out as appealing to all.   Using  simple prose elegantly translated from the original German by Ralph  Mannheim, Ende tells the story of a young boy searching vainly for his  identity.  Alienated from his widowed father and isolated from his  classmates, Bastian finds his sole solace in books.  The &quot;Neverending  Story&quot; is the story of Bastian's quest--through a fantastical world  contained in leather-bound volume.  Much like the reader, Bastian is slowly  drawn into the intricate narrative.   One of the few books written for  children which appeals equally to boys and girls, Ende's work is ultimately  an anagogical, luminous work.  Its appeal is that the novel stands on a  number of levels.  To the child, it is an exciting adventure tale; to the  adult, it is a powerful parable about the most fundamental and difficult  search--the search for self.  One of the most engaging works I've had the  pleasure to read.  Five stars seem woefully insufficient.
0790729628|4.0|The obviously contrived &quot;Hollywood ending&quot; of the original version (which I have and treasure) was its major (and, arguably, only) flaw.  The &quot;director's cut&quot; on this DVD eliminates THAT problem,  but, alas, also gratuitously drops Harrison Ford's voice-over, which I  (unlike the professional reviewers) admired greatly.  Of course, I also  liked &quot;Goodfellas&quot; and &quot;Casino&quot; -- go figure!
0385484518|4.0|A must read book for those who have become caught  up in the fast pace of today and the need to do it all  and have it all today.  Through his Tuesday conversations with Morrie, Mitch Albom is able to capture the  messages of life shared with him  by his friend and mentor.  While the  lessons shared through the weekly meetings are not new, the fact that they  are often ignored or forgotten is what makes  this book so powerful.

0767802659|5.0|Starship Toopers is the best sic fi-action movie to date bcause it gives a frighting view of the future.  It shows a world that is so caught up to be citizen that the goverment makes young people join the Army or Navy to show  that they are a higher class than the rest of the population.  It also  shows that doing something for the wrong reson doesn't pay off like Rico  found out in the movie. Besides these facts the special effects are the  best yet to make to the movies.
B000000WHX|5.0|My Music started off with the casual listening of local rock/ska/punk bands. I liked them for a while but I didn't find them to be quite enough for me. I bought Chemical Brothers album (Flick Yah self off yah self) and  then Exit Planet Dust (chemical bro's) I then moved onto Moby (I like to  score) I still love that album even after 1 1/2 years of listening. I then  bought my first Massive Attack album - Protection, I absolutally loved it  from the first time that I heard it! I just couldn't get enough, that was  about 3/4 of a year ago. I then got given Mezzanie for christmas (3 days  ago) I was absolutally outstanded by it! I then went and bought Blue Lines  today (on a special) and I am now listening to it at the moment.. I really  truely love it. The vocals of Shara Nelson in track 6 (unfinished Sympathy)  and the faint background scratching are fabulous... I could live with this  CD.. I don't think that I will be parting with this CD... ever. Thanks  Massive Attack.
B000001FI7|5.0|Nevertheless, an excellent debut album.  Portishead is right on the money with this one, an excellent display of musicianship and emotion. Track #6 is weak, but as a whole this is one of the best albums of recent memory.  Definately a keeper.
630512065X|5.0|What a great idea to put the much loved CATS musical on film for those who have never seen it, can't afford theater tickets or live too far away from a performance! I first saw it on PBS and was very impressed and saw it  again and again when I got it for Christmas. True a theater performance is  to be desired but if not settle for 2nd best! Kudos to the people that  played Victoria, Mr. Mistofflees, Old Deuteronomy, Jemima, Grizabella, Rum  Tum Tugger, and many more. They are terrific!!
6305265488|5.0|Drew Barrymore is my favorite actress.  She has an amazing talent and in this movie she proves that she can portray a modern-day Cinderella.  This movie was wonderfully done, and the scenery you witness is breathtaking.   It easily is her best film to date today.  Please, if you haven't already  witnessed this film for yourself, please see it when it comes out.  It  magically entertaining!!!!!!!1
0684874350|5.0|This is the best book that I have read in years. There is no end to the images that Mr. McCourt paints throughout Angela's Ashes.  I developed  a really good Irish accent while reading--so effective is his dialogue.  My  greatest fear about this book, however, is that someone will try to make it  into a movie.  That would be the greatest sin of all--far worse than many  little Frankie had to confess.
630237250X|5.0|The standard by which all &quot;rockumentaries&quot; are forever after judged.  Not only is the subject the most important artist of this century, the presentation is perfect.  No serious student of film or music can  ignore this work.  It defines brillance.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Possibly the best 'album' since Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot;, and not because it contains a number of #1 pop hits (we'll leave that to Michael, Madonna, and Men at Work), but because it's a great listen from start to  finish. Well written, neatly executed, and nicely layered, the songs from  start to finish are a roller coaster of emotion that leave you exhausted  and wanting another 60 minutes. Except for 'Karma Police', I can't even  name one of the song titles, and I don't care to be able to. This is an  album intended to be listened to from start to finish, as an album should  be. Nice work guys. And, oh by the way, they put on a great concert.
6305119961|5.0|This is the classic action movie, pitting Baldwin and Hopkins against eachother in the Alaskan wilderness. There's bears, guns, plain crashes, and of course the always great acting from Hopkins. I give this film a  perfect rating because that's what it is...... a perfect action thriller!
0688156819|5.0|I got this as a Hannukah gift. I didn't even know it existed. <br />I laughed out loud and then I reached the story from which the book gets its title. It was heart wrentching and yet, I still laughed out loud. <br />This book is  by far the sickest humor I have ever seen. Its pure magic.
6300271439|4.0|Mr. Maltin missed out on a good time with this off-the-wall romantic comedy/adventure in which Madonna is cuter than Cindy Lauper. Though she has a real-life tawdry image, her portrayal in WTG is bright and adorable.  Yes, it's silly. No, it's not deep drama. But it is a lot of fun.
B000002MY3|1.0|I have a hard time deciding which is worse, the leader or the follower - in this case the leader being Morissette herself, and the followers being the millions of mindless souls who buy, listen to, and enjoy this stuff.  Tiffany, Debbie Gibson, where are you?!? At least you didn't try to  misrepresent yourself - you both came off as the pop-diva simplistic  artists you were.  In Morissette's case, this big bundle of nothing is  trying to pass herself off as some angst-ridden goddess that will lead  millions to the promise land. Surprise, it's all record company and  industry hype - well, maybe Alanis herself even bought into it. She sure  can't sing, she's not an artist, and she's not even attractive. What a  waste of time. I'm ashamed of myself for even taking an hour of my life to  listen to this. Ten hail mary's for me...forgive me father, for I have  sinned!
6303426468|4.0|Junior was a funny movie to watch. Arnold plays a good part with Danny Da vetto.
6302000823|5.0|I love this movie.  I have yet to find a person who did not enjoy it.  Even those who are hesitant to watch foreign films have raved about how wonderful it is.  It is rare to find a movie that so many people with so  many different tastes enjoy.

B00000G3PA|5.0|I am not a big Bruce Willis fan, but I thought he did an excellent job on this movie.<br />Very dramatic and heart wrenching.<br />I was in tears.<br />5 STARS!!!
0767812417|5.0|It is a dramatic, yet touching film.  The songs will make you want to get up and dance along with Jack Wild, Ron Moody, and all the other actors and actresses.  My particular favoroite was Nancy's &quot; As Long as He Needs  Me.&quot;    It has  a sad yet tragic ending .    It is set in old London.   But take my word for it!  buy this Wonderful film and watch it over and  over and over and over again.

0316920045|2.0|&quot;Post-modernism&quot; is a reference to literature which has been produced after the discovery and artistic representation of strands of DNA (pertinent).  Thymonucleic acid tends towards the form of a helix in  construction.  (There's a peculiar concept beneath &quot;helix&quot; in  your dictionary, coincidentally).  Mr. Wallace would construct a genetic  novel, as it were.  Splicing and replacing your information, that he does.   He says, &quot;Take up your cross and follow me, and thou shalt inherit  infinite jest.&quot;
0684874350|5.0|A great read...funny, sad, heart-warming, and heart-wrenching.  Hard to put down.  Fantastic.
B000006N61|4.0|Do not, under any circumstances, get this movie dubbed if you have the same opportunity to get it in its original sound format, with the original voices.  The original is far superior to the dubbed version, no matter how  difficult the thick Australian accents of its actors may be to understand.   While it is a good movie even with the dubbed voicing, it is a far better  movie with all its original voices intact.
B000002BBY|5.0|Oasis is one of the few rock bands that has kept the sound of the Beatles' genre.  Fans of classic rock and roll will enjoy Oasis' music.  Champagne Supernova is my personal favorite song on this particular CD, along with  Wonderwall and What's the Story, Morning Glory.  This is a great CD, and it  belongs in your collection.
6302732778|4.0|This is truly a great movie, but I second the motion of those who want to see the original released version available again. Harrison Ford's voice-over narration gave it an extra bit of dreamy introspection that was  very beautiful. But I think that both endings - the original's happy escape  that the DC's sudden ending at the elevator - suck.
0553573403|5.0|I think I've probably read some of the most popular fantasies including Lord of the Rings, which in my opinion but not much others really sucked, Three and a half books in the Wheel of Time (I couldn't get through Shadow  Rising; all the guy did was sit on his butt and whine), The Sword of Truth  which was extremely fun though hard to believe at times and then my  favorite series: The cronicles of Thomas Covenant the Unbelievever which is  a brilliant piece of literature that any fantasy fan should at least try.  Anyway, this novel compares favorably to my favorites above.  This novel is  more literary.  The structure of constantly shifting points of view is more  complext than any of the other fantasies.  Good guys actually die.  Forget  Tolkien. Read this if you want some real fun and don't want to read a  hundred stupid elven and dwarwen and whatever songs in Lord of the Rings.
0870119435|5.0|This poetic, earlier novel by Murakami is also his most stark, humorous and romantic work.  It is only a shame this book is out of print and likewise very hard to attain.  Containing some of his most memorable lines  and characters, this highly allegorical novel take hold in the heart much  like a love would, tracing the development of one of the author's most  fully realized character through his college years.  Haunting, profound and  more romanctic than his other work, this novel, not unlike the Beatles song  of the same name, demands attention and thought - it is truly a beautiful  and rare work.
6300151379|5.0|I love Labryinth! I was soooo dissappointed that the video store carried the Dark Crystal (another great movie) and not this movie. This movie should be reprinted at the very least...maybe even re-released!
6303014100|4.0|Excellent screenplay of the battle.  some artistic license taken in the production.  It is sad that the regular version on sale, has the missing scenes, as people ask me, &quot;When does Gen. Ewell enter the  movie?&quot;. Unfortunately I tell them, that they must obtain the Turner  version, sold under seperate cover, usually through TNT when the movie is  shown on the TNT station, and it cost's 99.00 dollars.  Except for the fact  that the continuity of the directors cut is lost, the movie is very  factual.  Although &quot; Give them the cold steel boys&quot; is attributed  to Gn. Armistead, it was nice to see Gn. Garnett utter the phrase to soon  before the angle was actually attacked.<br />     We use the movie as a visual  aide in a Civil War Course taught by myself at a local college. also, did  you notice how Col. Chamberlain goes from a Lt. Colonel to a full  &quot;bird&quot; colonel in a matter of minutes?  It is the uniform, and  directors mistake, always watch rank.  Otherwise a top notch movie about a  sad experience in American history. My accolades to Ted Turner, and Robert  Maxwell.
B00000G3CK|5.0|The film a new word in cinematography.  Absolutely wonderful filming techniques in combination with off-this-earth soundtrack create an unforgettable show.  The ending is slightly banal for such a film (and this  is the only downside)
0385484518|4.0|This was a very enlightening book which just manages to escape becoming too preachy.  I think that Morrie's views on life were dead on, and we would all be in a much better place if we followed his examples.  As he  said, &quot;Love wins.  Love always wins.&quot;  How much happier we would  all be if that were always true...
0780624890|4.0|Not what everyone expects for a vampire movie. Blade is a solid movie and the extras to the DVD really add to this purchase.  Most action movie people will enjoy this flick
6305127689|5.0|I saw this in the theater when I was in third grade with two of my best friends.  When we left we all wanted to fighter piolts.  I can quote almost any line of this film to this DAY!  If you have a pulse, this movie is for  you!  This is the movie that defined the 80's for most men in America.  It  plays off of cold war, anti-russian sentiment as well as some good ol  action.  It's been over ten years since this movie was made and I still get  chills down my spine every time I hear the theme from this movie!  If you  own a DVD player (why else would you be reading this?) you owe it to  yourself to buy this movie!  It'll take full advantage of everything your  DVD player has to offer!!
0060926317|5.0|I bought this book on a recommendation from my history teacher.  We had spent the year learning about how indigenous people had/are losing their land and culture.  She said this book was a heart warming experience in  which you could learn from.  She was right! I was unable to put the book  down.  At the time I was living in Washington D.C.,  I read the book every  day riding the metro into the city. This book opened my mind to things that  I had forgotten about, to things I had no idea were possible and gave me a  new hope.  There have been many times in my life when I have thought about  this book and it has helped me through rough times.  I feel this book  teaches us a bit of historical culture (in fictional form) while learning  that the power that we feel we don't have is deep down inside of us all.
B000002UAU|5.0|This is an awesome album.  Listen to it with headphones.  Listen to how much bands like the Smashing Pumpkins draw upon it.  <br />It is not, however the Beatles best.  Throw out &quot;When I'm 64&quot; and &quot;Being for  the Benefit of Mr. Kite&quot; and add &quot;Penny Lane&quot; and  &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot; in their place(Originally intended  for the LP) and then you've got the Best album ever made.  As it stands I  rank it 5th.<br />1.  Abbey Road<br />2.  White Album<br />3.  Rubber Soul<br />4.   Revolver<br />5.  Sgt. Pepper
B000002MT0|5.0|This is a very good purchase and it's another and LAST chance for any who wants to explore the best of Prince's variery of musical mixtures, rhythms vocal skills and lyrics(as PRINCE). All the tracks are very good,  outstanding &quot;Letitgo&quot; and &quot;Race&quot; the former being   truly a declaration of Principles and the latter an anti-racist funk.Not to  mention the beautifully sad &quot;Solo&quot; here you could touch the sky  and the bottom all along Prince's priviledged voice.
B000006U44|4.0|A woman with a brain.  Kate was new age before new age.  She was alternative before alternative.<br />This CD is very unique in its feel.  I doubt you have another one like it in your collection.  &quot;The Man With  the Child in His Eyes&quot; and &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; are  masterpieces.  Kate is at her best when she slows things down and lets the  mood of her songs take over and she does that alot on this debut.  If you  don't know Kate, check this out.  It's important to any record collection  and you'll probably be surprised at how much she has influenced the current  crop of female singers.
0684833395|4.0|Catch-22 did everything that Joseph Heller wanted.  Moreover, it did exactly what a classic should do: it makes you think.  Why do we go to war?  Why do we kill?  Why did we follow the insanity of war that pervaded the  twentieth century? I admire Mr. Heller for this. However, what if Hitler  and the Nazi's overran the world because the allies did not find the  rational to destroy or stop them.  It is doubtful that any such book would  have ever been written, let alone even discussed.  There would be no free  speech, no freedom of assembly or of religion - among other liberties.   Yossarian would not be able to enjoy sleeping with Sheisskopf's wife  because he would most likely be sent to a prison camp to die. And because  the world still has a Saddam in control, killing will remain.  I enjoyed  the book because I am thinking about enlisting, and the book challenges me  to consider that which is usually ignored.  The author's reasoning forces  me to deal with the issue of killing another human and why I would follow  orders to do so.  In the US and other countries soldiers willingly vow to  defend their constitution to death.  Can anyone say that all those who had  ever enlisted were insane?  Thomas Aquinas grappled with the hypocrisies of  war, and derived reasoning on Just War in his treatise.  Yossarian reflects  what is very much prevalent in the twentieth century: the  'let-me-get-mine,' self-preserving disposition.  Heller underestimates  human character - intentionally or not.  His crack on leadership is  humorous, but not convincing. In reality, leaders  - whether in the  military of democracies or in democratic governments - for the most part  are sane and intelligent enough to make wise and justifiable decisions.   The book is excellent for its provocation.  However, one should also take  the other extreme.  James Webb's Fields of Fire is an excellent novel  depicting an USNA graduate as a Marine in Vietnam.  The character in the  end rebukes all the draftdodgers and protesters at an Ivy League school,  calling them cowards and hypocrites for not protecting the same freedoms  they were exercising and that other people were willing to die for.  In  all, Catch-22 either provokes praise or rebuke.  The style is its own, as  is the content. Whatever the opinion, enjoy the book for where it can take  you. (Five stars for content and aim; one star taken away for the laboring  style and uneasy transitions.)
B000002AVF|5.0|I truly admire Mariah Carey. I think she is an exceptional singer and have purchased every single album she ever made (o.k., so I didn't purchase Merry Christmas!). Her daydream album was absolutely stupendous. I gave up  my copy to a guy that I REALLY liked because it meant so much to me and it  showed just how much I did like him. Anyway, thats over with, but I was  given another copy of her album from my sister and that will never leave my  sight.

0684847817|5.0|This beautifully illustrated book teaches about mystical fairies from all over the world. Froud takes such legends as Morgana le Faye and the Sheela Na Gig and shows you their fairy equivlents. If you believe in fairies this is certainly a must. Though, I'm sure the non-believers will change their minds quickly after reading the fairy reasons to so many unknowns, such as why pens always disappear and why you find crumbs in your bed. With this book I was introduced to Froud's work and within the week of receiving it I purchased his \\"Fairies\\". They are truly exceptional!
B000002MTU|5.0|This record is perfect. Truly perfect. Clapton play like hell, like the old times but... better, and he sing like never, like a real blues-man. This is a record that you need to hear with no analisis, with no  pre-concepts. Becouse you are in front of Guitar God. And thats is really  nice for my spirit. Like U2 do with the sounds of traditional european and  american music and then from the modernity world culture, or The Police  with reggae tempos and jazzy lines, Clapton capture the blues into his  history an he did in this record (with 16 great olders) a sintesis of his  fantastic, incredible guitar sound.

He said, &quot;the people who love this album are a select club.&quot;  Foreigner Suite, although rockish, compares in  emotional intensity to the most stirring of Leonard Cohen's songs, Loreena  McKennit's and the music of that soul-mover par excellence, Richard Wagner.
630018403X|5.0|Classic 80's flick bringing together all of the &quot;brat pack&quot; who got their start in the 80's. A very realistic look into the trials and tribulations of being a teenager. Also one of the best soundtracks for 80's  music ever put together.
6303832563|5.0|One of the best films I've ever seen. Reggio's photography mixes perfectly with Philip Glass's scored to create an aura of complete magic. The Southwestern sequences (in particular the &quot;Ghost King&quot; rock art)  transport the viewer back to the pre-history of the Western US, the world  of the Anasazi.
0780622650|3.0|I'm an SF junke, and even though I was not born when the origional TV series was aired, I've seen a few of the reruns. This movie reminded me of the pilot episode (the best one IMO)and many of the clasic visual themes  are here, the Jupiter 1 looking like the origional ship, the Robot and even  the robot bay with the central lift to the bridge paid hommage to the  origional. Pity about the storyline though, but again, better than the TV  series. I love the Apollo 440 video though, just cant get the theme outta  my head.

0800132335|5.0|Das Boot is a movie about submarines involved in wartime conditions. The plot is based in a germans point of view, but it is about any sub in any war.  The actions and claustriphobic conditions aboard a submarine will  grip and shake the heart of a submariner that has ever been aboard a sub.  The most disheartnig scene in the whole movie is the last. It gives you to  wonder what is the real reason for war.
B00000G6QK|5.0|This record is probably the only documentation of this awesome act, which included John Scofield on guitar and Alphonso Johnson on bass--both at the top of their craft. This is true fusion: heavy on the funk and rock, but  chock fulla killer jazz changes and full-shred soloing. As usual with a  Cobham offering, there are moments of self-indulgence (Frankenstein Goes to  the Disco) and there are plenty of space noises. But this truly represents  the finest era of jazz/rock fusion--before the genre was nearly destroyed  by &quot;smooth jazz.&quot;

1567184855|5.0|Dr. Newton gives a logical argument for belief in spiritual reincarnation.  The writing is clear and the case studies are surprisingly credible.  Anyone with questions or doubts concerning the supernatural or metaphysical  will find solid, factual evidence to survey that requires no leap of faith  to comprehend.  <br />The writing remains free from all common religious  thought-paradigms while emphasizing the same strong personal responsibiliy  that, until now was almost exclusively taught by the major religions.

B000009VOL|5.0|Chan ('Shawn') Marshall has created a beautiful collection of songs here and the addition of Jim and Mick from the Dirty 3 is an excellent grouping, something that was bound to happen for sure someday. Chan shines the  brightest of all of her albums here, reaching deep into her psyche and  finding incredible wealths of imagination and spirit. This album grows  incredibly well on you and you will find it and her other albums becoming a  large part of your world almost immediately. I thought her version of  Dylan's &quot;Moonshiner&quot; was incredibly adept and unique. She is a  talent where the limits are endless. She will only get better (and she  ain't been in such a bad place so far). Georgia has produced some great  singer/songwriters in the past. Chan is from the same dark, gothic, strange  world as Flannery O'Connor, Vic Chestnutt and Faulkner. A Georgian by  birth, her southern roots run deep. I voted Chan's Moon Pix as my #2 album  of all of 1998 'You are soooooo beautiful'.
6305079811|4.0|This is a very campy remake of all those serials from early this century. It is always good for the amusement of sci-fi fans. After all the uptight space shows it is very good to laugh.
6302860253|5.0|The music is all it should be. Julia Migenes-Johnson plays an absolutely believable &quot;bad girl&quot;, entirely different from the traditional opera Carmen. Placido Domingo is a bit old to be so naive, but who cares.  Shot on location in hot and dusty Spain, the photography is absolutely  stunning.
B000003TA4|5.0|Nirvana was and still is through their albums, the greatest alternative band that ever strummed a guitar and this album exemplifies that.  Nirvana gave us the purest, non-sold-out sound and whipped the competition, if  there ever was any.  This album displays the way music should be played -  without keyboard-made noises or any annoying mixing.  It is, simply put,  down-to-earth rock 'n' roll.  Many bands try to imitate the pure rock 'n'  roll sound but they have all failed and Nirvana's music continues to be  unique and untouchable.  Nirvana's songs had a steady, easy to listen to  beat without strange &quot;jerks&quot; in the rhythm that today's R&amp;B  records force on us.  Not that all music except alternative is evil, it's  just that, given the choice, I would pick listening to Nirvana over any  other band.  Just some ramblings from a hardcore Nirvana fan.  (Like I  needed to tell you that.)
B0000041TD|5.0|I have returned to this recording, both on wax and on compact disc, for many years. Karajan displays an astonishing feel for the music of Puccini, and the ensemble of singers provides a delightful blend of voices which  never fails to touch the heart of the listener. Elizabeth Harwood is a joy  to hear as  Museta. Freni is in this recording a Mimi beyond compare. This  recording is an especially good display of the magnificent vocal gifts of  Luciano Pavarotti. His voice is ripe, full, yet easy in this recording.  There is, perhaps, no other recording of a complete opera which displays so  clearly the fact that Pavarotti's voice is unusually large for a lyric  tenor. Even so, his wonderful diction and phrasing make his Rodolfo truly  delightful. This is Pavarotti singing serious music with joy! His voice,  from the entrance in Act One is liquid sunshine. This recording is a must  for every lover of Puccini!
B000005S37|1.0|It's a double album of feedback and that's all.  A better bet is White Light/White Heat.
0399143904|1.0|Although not as awful as Executive Orders, Rainbow Six confirms that Clancy's basic formula is worn out.  I am left questioning whether or not we need a new cold war to get something tolerable out of this fellow.
6302529867|4.0|Much has been said about the &quot;stock&quot; characters and situations in this film, but don't let that stop you from viewing an adventure movie that really could have happened! The scenery is absolutely breathtaking,  both early in the film, when Taylor and Harold are &quot;prepping&quot; for  their K2 trip by doing some rock climbing in Alaska, and especially later  on, when they assault the ice-covered slopes of K2 itself. Director Franc  Roddam really makes you feel like you're there! Mountain climbers like this  have got to be the toughest athletes in the world.... just look at the  effort it takes these guys to get to the summit! And when things begin to  go wrong during the descent, you'll be biting your nails trying to figure  out who'll survive and who won't.  Also take note of the relationship  between Taylor and Harold.... a real &quot;guy&quot; friendship. And that  soundtrack! Chaz Jankel (formerly of Ian Drury &amp; The Blockheads) has  created a Pink Floyd-ish sound that adds to the suspense and sense of  wonder as this team attempts to beat the second- highest peak on earth. I  wish the soundtrack were available on CD; it's spectacular!
6303202004|5.0|Sentiment over whats ostensibaly the last of the Startrek films, nicely rounded off with the crews signatures. The film has everything, from excellent special effects to emotion. Not only do we see Klingon blood  hanging out in a gravity lacking environment, but we also see ourselves in  tears at the end of the movie, when the long and remembered friends leave  the big screen after 25 years of the Star Trek Saga.
6305127638|5.0|This was by far the most interesting of all the Star Trek movies I've seen (w/Next Generation cast).  DVD quality beats the hell out of VHS!
0812550706|4.0|A very entertaining read. This book got the author both the Hugo and Nebula awards. The story is about a very young boy, a genius, who, at the age of 6, is drafted into a world government/military training school in  order to defeat the &quot;buggers.&quot; Humanity had previously defeated  an unprovoked invasion by these aliens seemingly by sheer luck.  We go  through both strategic military training, and emotional, psychological and  sociological training, conditioning and development of Ender, the main  character, and suffer with him as he is pushed to his limits - which are  far greater than any other young child, teen, or adult that I know.  Ender  is always seeing the wheels within wheels of thinking of his nemesis, be it  school bullies, his sadistic brother, his teachers, or even his friends, or  his super-compassionate sister. I did find that I was getting too wrapped  up in this book, but perhaps this is the sign of a very involving  storyteller.  As Ender is pushed harder and harder, I found myself getting  more and more sick of this, angry almost.  I was quite releaved when it was  finally over and don't have plans to read the sequals for a while!
0446605409|5.0|This book was a great find!  One of my fav writers recommended it, so I deceided to give it a try...it was so worth it!!!  I am moving on to the Gold Coast, but don't miss Plum Island!!!  It was a well written story,  with a great main character!
0061053147|5.0|For those interested in science fiction, movie making, special effects, and even hollywood gossip, this book contains pleanty to satisfy. If you are a big fan of Philip K. Dick and his works, especially Do Androids Dream  of Electric Sheep and the movie version Blade Runner, it is of particular  interest. This book gets into the minute details of how Blade Runner was  conceptualized as a movie, how it was developed, and how eventually it was  filmed. Some of the details get a bit overwhelming at some points, like  when Sammon talks about the special effects for almost every scene in the  movie, but he appropriately forwarns the reader that there will be fairly  technical material and to skip it if this is not up your alley. There are  lots of interesting accounts from the actors themselves. Sammon did a lot  of reporting during the actual filming, but this book over 10 years  afterwards, so there are many interviews with the actors with the hindsight  and perspective that comes from this amount of time. All in all, an  extremely interesting read!
630026999X|4.0|An outstanding cast in a group of horror stories that will make your skin crawl.  A genuine example of the best in film style.  Really captures the spirit of the old comic books with great graphics and editing.  The E.G.  Marshall episode with the roaches is for strong stomachs, but it is a  delicious satire.  A really &quot;fun&quot; movie!
6302914191|5.0|This is an exquisite style of all aspects of the screen. Not only does Lynch make you feel like he is making a parody on modern day soaps and life, but he also makes it feel like each episode is a film for the silver  screen in themselves. The only thing that is lacking with the episodes is  the fact that you cannot get a hold of them in DVD format.
0792151712|5.0|Even though you know how the movie ends, you are on the edge of your seat throughout.  Magnificent scenery and special effects!
6302529867|4.0|I found this to be an excellent movie, although frankly the actors took a backseat to the cinematography.  I did find it rather hard to believe that none of the climbers used supplemental oxygen during this climb (except for  one older climber).  But if you know little or nothing about mountain  climbing, it makes for a nice armchair adventure.
6305265488|4.0|At first glance, Ever After appears to be a movie set up for disaster.  Set in a murky period of pseudo-history in which Frenchmen speak perfect English while spouting very modern political ideals, where Thomas More's  Utopia (published 1516) has been around for at least 10 years, yet Leonardo  Da Vinci (died 1519) is still alive and well and now functioning as a  matchmaker for the young prince of France, the movie threatens to grow  absurd and lose the audience's suspension of disbelief.      But before the  movie, shot in a number of lush period settings, is able to alienate its  audience, Drew Barrymore appears on the scene as Cinderella.  The movie  makers have expanded upon the Cinderella myth considerably, and Barrymore  is given a complex character to play rather than a one-dimensional fairy  tale heroine.  She pulls it off with aplomb.  She is both sweet and strong,  intelligent yet vulnerable, and it is her nuanced performance as Cinderella  which in the end makes the whole movie work as a charming little period  romance.
B000000I0H|4.0|Yes, it's one of Mike's most memorable and distinctive works, but I feel it suffers just slightly from 'blockiness', something overcome later in Islands and Amarok, the transition between segments is clumsy. But don't  get me wrong, the segments themselves are great.
B000002HAJ|5.0|This album will change your mind about goth music. Sure, Robert Smith tortured beyond help, but he is a spectacular craftsman of popular music. Since  buying this CD, it has become the soundtrack to my life. The ringing  guitars and surperior bass work are the perfect backdrop for any mood.  Smith is not a poet, just a very honest songwriter with a great voice and a  few (very true) things to say about life. Everyone should own this CD. I  can't speak  highly enough of it. P.S. &quot;High&quot;, &quot;From the  Edge of the Deep Green Sea&quot;, and &quot;Doing the Unstuck&quot; are  special treats!
B000005IZ8|4.0|Philip Glass' equivalent of a pop album. There's ballads, fast ones, IMPORTANT ones, fun ones, mean ones. Incredibly listenable.
0399143904|2.0|Well I hate to say this, but the companion computer game that followed the release of the book held my intrest and kept suspense more than this 800 page flatliner from Tom Clancy.  The book focuses on an international  anti-terrorist team that gets caught up in a corporate conspiracy to  destroy the world in the name of Nature.  The characters were dull and  boring and, unlike Clancy's previous work, the book didn't seem to keep  much suspense.  The way he tackled the pending doom of the planet seemed  dull and unimportant.  The weight of man's power to justify his own actions  as the right ones seemed to be lost.  The characters of John Clark and Ding  Chavez seem grosely macho and had that I-embody-every-virtue type feel to  them.  It almost seemed like I was reading a pamphlet praising the army,  like military propoganda.  By the time I reached page 500 I was ready to  throw it aside but found the will to finish it only because I wanted the  sense of accomplishment.  In the end, Clancy brings up a chilling  concept that seems real and devistatingly possible but destroys it by not  examining the other sides of the fanaticism that is quelled by the Rainbow  team.  I'd say this is an easy one to skip and definatly not up to the  standards of a decent Clancy read.
0399143904|1.0|I've read six or seven Tom Clancy novels, and this was by far the worst of the lot. I could barely finish it, and when I had, I donated my copy of the book to my local library. \\"Red Storm Rising\\" was great -  moderately plausible plot, interesting characters, shades between good and  evil, enough technical detail to keep one's interest. This book had a  totally implausible plot, a collection of cardboard characters (GOOD/BAD),  an absurd ending filled with shooting fish in a barrel... It is hard to  imagine that this would have been published if it had been written by an  unknown author. Very disappointing!
0780624963|5.0|It had great special affects and an OK story line. But all in all it was a great movie.
B00000DGUG|5.0|First of all i love her so much she is the coolest i was so happy when this came out i had to have it. please people e-mail me and tell me what you thought i want to hear it. If u are thinking about buying this cd i  would go ahead and do because it's the best....!!!!!!
B00000DHRZ|5.0|This is a super good cd.  it's really fun to play them on my guitar and Why Don't you get a job? is on eof my fav. songs on there.  I've heard pretty fly... too much now, walla walla is another good song.  The songs  are good to listen to while free- sooting at half time at my basketball  games.
B0000022WA|5.0|An extremely cute movie. I love it
0792151720|2.0|There's no doubting that this film will be remembered as a phenomenon. It loses a little of it's appeal on the transfer to the small screen, but it still carries more emotional weight than your average hollywood  blockbuster.  It could have been really awful with the poor script. It  could have been really wonderful with such an ingenious idea. Instead it is  simply an exceptionally well made, but run-of-the-mill story, it's well  worth a watch, but don't expect to be intellectually challenged.
B000002BFL|2.0|Bruce has been writng about the working man for a long time now.  However, for the first time, the  stories in his songs seem forced and artifcial.  Like he is writing experiences he's gotten second and third hand, rather  than lived.  He's moved his characters out of New Jersey and into the  southwest and it seems false. It dilutes the work and the message.
B000002UA0|5.0|Wow!  This is an incredible album!  It's hard to see why it's been so overlooked in favor of &quot;Dark Side&quot; because this is clearly the superior album. Whimsical childish songs, like &quot;The Gnome&quot; and  &quot;Bike&quot; have disturbing little intervals (and in the case of  &quot;Bike&quot; endings) which transform them into works of pure genius.   The instrumentals on here (&quot;Pow R. Toc H.&quot; and &quot;Interstellar  Overdrive&quot;) are the best I've ever heard.  And the rest, particularly  &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot; are incredible.  There is truly not a weak  song on here--not even a weak moment.  Syd Barrett (and Roger Waters for  &quot;Take Up Thy Stethoscope and Walk&quot;) write probably the best  collection of songs ever compiled.  It has a drive and energy unparalleled,  yet knows how to be quite amusing when it needs to be.  I'd tend to say  that this is better than my previous favorite &quot;Sgt. Pepper,&quot; but  that's quite a statement so I'd leave it as this album being at least as  good as the Beatles' masterpiece.
6305265488|4.0|Remember, it is a &quot;Cinderella story&quot;, but it's a joy to watch a strong female lead and to see the couple actually spend a few days together getting to know one another before they magically fall in love.  Framing  the story with the Brothers Grimm and making the whole thing more  &quot;real&quot; adds to the film's appeal.
B000002U82|2.0|I thought this album was just okay when I heard it (and I did give it several chances).  And then I heard the best Pink Floyd album there is--Piper at the Gates of Dawn, which absolutely crushes this attempt at  music.  Anyone who has heard Piper knows what I mean--that is an album that  is psychedelic music at its best.  So, don't bother with this one--get  Piper, the true Floyd masterpiece. Sorry about not talking too much about  Dark Side, but I thought I could get through to people who praise Dark Side  here better than when reviewing Piper--I don't know how many of you out  there have even heard of Piper.  Still skeptical?  Just try The Piper at  the Gates of Dawn.
0385493622|5.0|A marvelous thriller that races through the ages in quest of a non-solution! Singh brings to life brilliant mathematicians from antiquity to modern times and weaves an intriquing tale of each persons contribution  to solving the Theroem. The best part is that one need not be a  mathematician to appreciate the richness of the story. You must read this  book if you have any curiosity about anything!
0876855583|5.0|This being my first Bukowski novel I had no idea what to expect. His poignant and often hysterical observations of adolescent life will keep me up thinking most of the night. A phenomenol read that has inspired to me to  consume his other works. Henry's life was truly his own and conformity was  not a luxury (or demon) that he would allow himself to experience. His life  was harsh and on the edge, but it was 'his' life and as he grows he remains  true to himself.
6305229449|5.0|Although many recent Disney animated films earned more money than Mulan, in my opinion Mulan is the best Disney animated film period!  This film has some of the strongest and most dignified characters of any Disney film in  recent memory.  I did not leave the theater feeling sickly empty as happens  with Hercules, or the Lion King, but rather very satified seeing a story  well told about characters I would like to get to know.<br />An excellant  movie for the whole family!
B000002LFU|5.0|This album has always had a soft spot in my heart.  &quot;Green&quot; was released on Election Day in 1988 when I was a college freshman, which meant that it made a big impression in the pseudo-intellectual world I was living  in.  I had been an R.E.M. fan since their beginning, I remember eagerly  awaiting their major label debut since I did not see it as a sell-out,  although many others I know write it off as R.E.M.'s &quot;Fat Elvis&quot;  record.  But I disagree. R.E.M. is a band like few others in that they are  always willing to try new things and push the envelope a little to see what  they can get away with, and what they did with &quot;Green&quot; was to lay  the foundation for the big breakthrough that &quot;Out Of Time&quot; would  become.  Listen to songs like &quot;World Leader Pretend&quot; or  &quot;Stand&quot; or especially &quot;You Are The Everything&quot; and ask  yourself if that could be the same band that tore up the indie world in the  early eighties.  They somehow manage to combine intimacy with large-scale  concepts and make it sound completely listenable.  Besides, what's wrong  with stepping back a bit after you've begun to scale the heights?  The best  albums are often the ones that no one thinks of as containing artistic  merit or commercial appeal.  If you've dismissed this album before, listen  again and look harder.  If not, throw it in the CD player and enjoy the  ride.
6303148352|5.0|Absolutely fantastic film! Based on the book by Michael Crichton, Jurassic Park has just the right amount of suspense and action to play out the movie. Anyone who enjoys science fiction combined with excitement should  put this on their must see list.
B00000255F|5.0|Upon reading each of the other reviews of &quot;Born to Run&quot; here I played the CD again. As I did I asked myself if indeed it DID still stand the test of time, or as our friend in Winnipeg suggested, is it  &quot;failing the test of time?&quot;My conclusion is a simple, but  profound YES!  This CD STILL kicks a**!And yes, it IS the best rock record  ever produced.

B00000253N|5.0|More than any other person living today, Bob Dylan has earned the title of America's Poet.  Blood on the Tracks is one of the finest pieces of American music ever.  There isn't a filler song on the entire album.  In an  age when we applaud when a songwriter or band can come up with one good  song, Dylan rocks us out with many, many more.   The visual imagery in the  songs on this album are enough to make your head spin.  He uses words and  feelings to paint a most vivid picture of the turmoil and emotional rifts  he felt forming in his own life.  To turn his tragedy into a musical  triumph is amazing.  Long live the Poet King!
0793927501|3.0|This will more than do!  Pitting his slick city photographer against the dignified older millionaire played by Hopkins, The Edge is an edge of your seat thriller.
B000002AGN|5.0|...he would have had Take Five playing at the Last Supper.  This recording has such depth, such intensity, it's hard to believe that it's been captured on a CD.  As I sit here now, I am waiting to get home, decompress  and play the album in the background of my mind.  I won't get into the  technicalities with you, but take my word for it, this is a CD that will  never end up as a coaster.
0783226160|4.0|What Fast Times at Ridgemont High does for high school, this more than achieves for collegiate types.  Tom Hulce's first movie, John Belushi's best, this is an unbelievably funny film from start to finish.
0783221487|3.0|I have not read the book.  I own the video.  Photography is good but the soundtrack by Toto does make it somehow slow and boring.  I own the soundtrack too and it is not a must have.  A collection of short tracks  which are not good to listen as an entire masterpiece.<br />Also, David Lynch  *director* told Toto he wanted soft and slow music, they did their job.   Pop tracks are better than the other orchestra tracks.  Toto is a  recognized pop group but they are lack of experience in  soundtracks.<br />Since the music is half of the experience, this is half a  movie.  Dressing and background are excellent.  Sean Young performs great  as she did in Bladerunner or No Way Out.<br />If you are a Sci-Fi fan you may  get it or not.  I don't hate this movie, but I recognized it could be  better.<br />Anyway, I won't take the video to any trade center because it has  enough quality to be at home.<br />Also, it is not good for children or even  teens.  I saw that movie in 1984 when I still was a teen and it was  shocking due to discusting ways of violence.  I understand why that movie  was not a success.  Not a good movie, not a bad one.
078881172X|5.0|One of the best Disney films ever considering both story &amp; songs, and for its remarkable animation, Peter Pan is the story of the boy who wouldn't grow up.  Neverland is an inviting place for the Darling children,  until they meet the wicked Captain Hook.  Can Peter save them from his  sinister plan?  Can he save himself?  A great film!
B000006XXV|5.0|Whoever said this album is an MTV plastic chair whatever doesn't know this band as well as they think.  This is a typical album(later) of The Cure, and is just as good as any of their 90's albums.  It still has the same  feeling as any of theirs, such as Wish, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me,  ect..Only a true Cure fan will know the difference between this album and  their older stuff.

B00000DGUG|5.0|I remember when 'You Oughta Know&quot; cam out, Alanis was quickly labeled a one-hit wonder by most of my teenage peers.  After Ironic, she was labeled a annoying and whiny.  After she released nearly half the songs on  her album with no new album in sight, people wondered if she had what it  took to do it again.  &quot;Supposed Former Infatuaion Junkie&quot; proves  that she could.  But SFIJ also proved something else.  It proved that she  could use a entirely new sound and still create the same moving and  emotional music she had on &quot;Jagged&quot;.  Her new record, while being  not at all like her first, is still wonderful.  Some of my favorites,  'Front Row', 'Joining You', 'The Couch', 'So Pure', and 'Unsent' relate to  things I have gone through and continue to go through from day to day.   SFIJ is down to earth and easy to listen to.  TO ALANIS:  I dig the new  sound. ;)
6303422020|2.0|This is far from Romero's best. The predictable stories include a wooden indian coming to life, a  hitchhiker who dies and torments a driver, etc. The nudity in this film is pointless and unneeded. see it for &quot;the  raft&quot; which is the only decent story.
6305127689|3.0|This movie has great cinematography in the air dogfight scenes, and a great, loud soundtrack.  It also has one of the most embarrassing lines in filmdom when McGillis says, &quot;I was afraid they'd see that I'd fallen  for you.&quot;  It is clear that the character &quot;Goose&quot; will be,  as the movie parody &quot;Hot Shots&quot; named his counterpart, dead meat,  but Anthony Edward's acting is dead on for the spirit of this movie. Tom  Skerritt also brings good acting.  Otherwise, you can use the chapter skip  or fast forward features of your DVD player to bypass the very unlikely and  unconvincing romantic subplot and Cruise's prolonged crying scenes in the  last quarter of the film.
0425129586|5.0|After you get going, this is a really good book. It takes a lot for a book to impress me and this one did. The book starts out with 10 people who all murdered someone. They are all called to Indian Island (an island with a  mansion on it) for various reasons. When they arrive they all find out why  they are there. One by one they begin getting murdered and the point of the  book is trying to figure out who the killer is. You'll start trying to  guess who it is and be surprised at the end when you find out who it  actually is. This book really got me hooked on Agatha Christie books.
0790736942|5.0|I TREATED MYSELF TO OWNING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL EDITION FOR CHRISTMAS. I WAS UTTERLY FRIGHTENED AND AMAZED AT THE DOCUMENTARY, BEHIND THE SCENES INFO.

0553573403|1.0|I keep trying to like this book. The wordsmithing is excellent. But I just can't find anything beyond that to recommend it. The characters are flat, the plot is complex but meaningless. Lots of pointless violence and nothing  seems to be  resolved. The only really interesting part (the  north wall)  is never fully developed.<br />I don't see what the fuss is about. It just  isn't very good.
B000003TAR|5.0|This is a cry from hell. This album is right up there with &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; and &quot;Raw Power&quot;! As other reviews state, this was a really bold move to take after having such a huge  &quot;commercial&quot; success with &quot;Nevermind&quot;. Nirvana had  balls, and they stuck them out there as far as they could. <br />This album  harkens way back to the early days of &quot;garage rock&quot;. A time when  bands turned up thier amps to 11 and played. They didn't play to make a hit  single or some corporate B.S. like that, they played because it was fun.  Nirvana does that and more with this beautifully crafted PUNK album!<br />Buy  it now!

B000002KBU|5.0|I heard a couple songs off of &quot;Blue&quot; one night in a friend's apartment in Chicago and I couldn't get it out of my system for the whole weekend.  I had to go out and buy it.  The entire CD is musical genius and  soul poured out by one of the best musicians of all time.  Every song on  this album is a Joni Mitchell classic; its one of the best albums ever  made.  A lot of respectful musicians do covers of her songs like  &quot;River&quot;, &quot;California&quot;, &quot;All I Want&quot; and of  course....&quot;A Case of You&quot;.  However, nothing comes close to even  pursuading the listener the way Joni Mitchell does.  Get the original.
B000002BFL|4.0|Forget all the talk about how much this album is  a suicide soundtrack and drop the ten bucks, cut away everything but the title track, turn out the lights, hide any sharp objects from yourself, and immerse yourself in the  most gripping, gritty, transcendant,and perfect song Bruce has ever done. I  promise it will haunt you if you give it the chance. And if you'd allow me  to exaggerate perhaps a bit-call it The Great American Song as well.   <br />And the rest ain't so bad. Especially the last stanza of Youngstown,  perhaps his most poetic.

B000001Y2U|5.0|At first I thought Marilyn Manson's image was a lot more noteworthy than his music, but after hearing this album, I realized I was wrong: it is a great album, unless you're very narrow minded I don't see how you couldn't  get off on this stuff.
B00000AFHM|1.0|I can't believe the number of people tripping all over themselves to bow down before &quot;Arab Strap&quot;.  What a twee little record!  Rich, understated pop abounds these days -- give me Idaho, Low, the Dirty Three.   Hell, even Elliott Smith's Name That Influence game is more interesting  than this dreck.  People, people -- Belle &amp; Sebastian is flat out  boring, and they are musical thieves to boot (unless Lou Reed is collecting  royalties...) And perhaps most offensively, Belle &amp; Sebastian's fan  club members gather for picnics before their shows.  Picnics!  If that  doesn't tell you what kind of jelly-filled danishes gravitate towards Belle  &amp; Sebastian's music, nothing will...
B000000OSE|5.0|I got APPETITE for Christmas last year, and I was astounded by the music, it is simply the best album ever made.  So this year I got both CD's of the Use Your Illusion series.  I must say I was disappointed.  All the songs  (except for greats like &quot;November Rain&quot; &quot;Civil War&quot;  &quot;14 Years&quot; &quot;Coma&quot; &quot;You Could Be Mine&quot; and a  few others) sound the same, and they aren't even good.  One of the  highlights of the album is &quot;Get in the Ring&quot; when somebody starts  babbling on and swearing like a drunken frenchmen, it's hilarious.  Maybe I  liked APPETITE more because my hopes were high. My suggestion is get the  two UYI's first, and you'll love'em. Then get APPETITE, and you'll be  amazed!
B000003TSP|5.0|Have you ever found that music that just tears at your soul and shows you who you really are? this is it for me.  this is my soul, naked.  Mourning air is the best track, i think.  I love the whole f-in cd though, so buy  it. or i'll die.
0316152196|4.0|Connelly is one of those rare authors who can keep me up all night and not have me regret it in the morning. I have enjoyed all the Harry Bosch stories and this one is particularly well-crafted save for a climactic mob  scene near the end which I found both predictable and overdone. The murder  mystery is wonderful, though, and Connelly knows how to unravel the clues  without giving too much away. Sadly, it's going to be a very long wait now  until the next Harry Bosch story appears.
6304925131|5.0|This was a very interesting movie. It was a movie which really moved me. I could see this movie any number of times any day. I reccommend it to all who are willing to see it. The plot was interesting, the characters brave  and clever. I give this movie the best possible review!
0393312836|5.0|One of the best books have ever read.  The way that Alex spoke with Nadsat (read and you will understand) was just plain spooky.  Nowadays we always speak of the desensitizing of America's youth, but this book describes just  the opposite with the way they took away a young boys freedom of choice.
